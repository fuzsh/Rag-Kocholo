        "text": "Ferrocement or Ferro-concrete is a system of reinforced mortar or plaster applied over layers of metal. It consists of closely spaced, multiple layers of mesh or fine rods completely embedded in cement mortar. It has a wide range of uses including sculpture and prefabricated building components. Ferro concrete is relatively a new material and has good strength and resistance to impact. When used in house construction in developing countries, it provided better resistance to fire, earthquake, and corrosion than traditional materials such as wood, adobe and stone masonry. Depending on the quality of construction and the climate of its location, houses may pay for themselves with almost zero maintenance and lower insurance requirements. The main objective of this research is to investigate the possibility of using ferrocement concrete in different types of advanced construction. The current work presents the comparison between the performance of ferrocement and reinforced concrete under static load\n\nThe structure or a building is primarily defined by its form and material. The Catenary is a form defined by hanging chain which has been used over centuries to build arches, vaults etc by architects and engineers. A unique insight into this very innovative form has been provided by history as well as by present day construction techniques. Ferrocement has a long lineage from its discovery in the year 1848 A.D. to present times. The material, ferrocement today exists as a sustainable and ecofriendly material acting as a challenge and research area for designers. In this paper, a qualitative evaluation research method is used. The research methodology comprises of case studies, visual observation and data collection. This research presents history, properties and application of catenary shells and ferrocement structures. In this paper the basic concepts of catenary based ferrocement shell has been studied. The paper also emphasizes the reason for catenary shells as a 'form' and ferrocement as a 'material' combined together could provide economically viable and sustainable solutions to building structures. The study of thin shell structures is also validated and analyzed with five case studies around the world paper in this research paper.\n\nFerrocement is suitable for the construction of roofing/floor elements, precast units, manhole covers, and construction of domes, vaults, grid surface and folded plates. It can also be used for making water tanks, boats, and silos. It is concluded that the first crack and ultimate loads increase with the increases number of layer wire mesh. From the studies, it is observed that the load carrying capacities, deformation at ultimate load and energy absorption capacities are high in the case of increasing the number of wire mesh layers. Ferro-means iron although metal commonly used in Ferro-cement is the iron alloy steel. Today cement usually means Portland cement, Mortar is a paste of a binder (usually Portland cement), sand and water; and concrete is a fluid mixture of Portland cement, sand, water and crushed stone aggregate which is poured into formwork (shuttering) Prefabricated elements are used In construction industry as an alternative system to overcome the formwork problems in addition to getting better quality control. The prefabricated elements made of reinforced concrete are extremely heavy and difficult to transport, placing in position and to construct. Alternatively, fibrocement panels are being used in construction industry due to its good structural performance and low cost. This paper concludes that fibrocement can be a best suitable material in upcoming years with a large no of applications. In this paper review work is presented on fibrocement as a construction material and its properties. This paper also focuses on structural behavior of fibrocement when used along with different structural members.\n\nAn improved qualitative arrangement of wire mesh which is thought to reflect more realistically the behavior of ferrocement in flexure is arranged. The presence of wire mesh reinforcement in ferrocement improves bending strength and crack resistance. The objective of the study is to investigate the behavior of material reinforced with varying mesh layers and orientations and to evelove its material properties. Tension tests were also carried out on meshes. Bending tests is to be conducted for specimen under two point loading. The effects of the varying reinforcement arrangements would replicates its response on strength and bending characteristics of ferrocement characteristics under tension and simple bending which to be studied experimentally, and those results also will be discussed in the paper.\n\nFerrocement has the versatility that can be 'sculptured' or shaped into numerous fascinating structures and objects for very wide applications. The exposure of this technology to engineers in general is rather minimal in Romania and many are skeptical about it. The potential is not exploited for it being unconventional in nature. Its ability to compete or use as a cheaper alternative and yet a promising technology in ensuring improved living standard and environmental quality must not be neglected. The paper discusses about the applicability of ferrocement in the Romanian scene with respect to recreation and home use. The ferrocement elements can be used for outside or inside exposure, thanks to ferrocement's durability, resistence to impact and resistence to fire.\n\nFor nearly fifteen hundred years, Hagia Sophia is one of the most important and well-known monuments in the history of architecture and still the fourth biggest temple in the world. Moreover, according to architectural and engineering standpoints in the construction period, Hagia Sophia is an exceptionally innovative masonry structure which completed in the 6th century. Besides the collapse of the dome 20 years after completion and secondary damages and partial collapses, the structure stands for more than 1500 years. Many serious earthquakes happened in the history of Hagia Sophia and thanks to the high performance of outstanding against these events, providing the structural, engineering and material information in order to understand the innovations in the structure and vulnerabilities might be helpful for the initial steps for the innovations in Byzantine architecture. The paper explains the structure, architectural background of Hagia Sophia and the innovations by the collaboration of different material usage and experimental process of the construction. Within the framework of this paper, a series of analyses concerning the synthesis of structural improvements through innovations. Keywords: Hagia Sophia; masonary; dome; materials; inovation;"
