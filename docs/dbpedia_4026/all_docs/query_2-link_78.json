        "text": "Introduction\n\n1Alexandria has a rich history as a Southern Mediterranean multicultural hub (Halim. 2013), and has a Christian community that according to local tradition was founded by St. Mark the Apostle (Kamil. 2002:60). Beginning in the late 1800s, the city saw an influx of foreign groups that established their own churches. Following the revolution of 1952 and the Suez War of 1956, however, Alexandria underwent significant social changes, and most of these foreign communities have since seen a dramatic decline in local numbers. Meanwhile, Alexandria’s Cosmopolitan Era has become a subject of nostalgic romanticism that has been hailed by writers, reporters, and scholars as a beacon of tolerance, diversity, and multicultural hybridity, in contrast with a contemporary reality that is characterized by increasing cultural homogeneity, sectarian strife, and the rise of Salafi Islamism as the dominant social current in the city (Traub. 2014). This binary representation distorts both the city’s past and its present circumstances. On the one hand, it celebrates a kind of sectarian tolerance and co-mingling that may have been more limited and confined to elite circles than has been commonly assumed (Mabro 2004, Fahmy 2013), while on the other, a firm focus on Salafi-Islamism tends to overshadow the relative diversity that may be found in present-day Alexandria along regional, rural-urban, ethnic, religious and ideological lines.\n\n2This article will look at the remnants of these small, foreign church communities that still retain a modest presence in Alexandria. Rather than emphasizing experiences of loss and decline, however, I will look at some of the ways in which members of Alexandria’s smaller church communities have adapted to modern circumstances and endeavored to maintain their presence in the city.\n\n3It will first be argued that an earlier period of inter-confessional openness among local Christians was followed by a period of retreat and boundary maintenance within each denominational community throughout the second half of the 20th century. Later, I will contend that the last two decades have seen a new period of inter-confessional openness, partly in response to a new reality in which some communities are struggling to maintain a sustainable presence in Alexandria.\n\n5What kind of prospects for the future can be found among local Christians in present-day Alexandria? How does this inform social relations between members of various church communities in the city? How are these relations reflected in marriage patterns and social rules associated with inter-sectarian marriages among Christians in Alexandria?\n\n6Before these questions can be addressed, a few words on the Christian communities of Alexandria and their history are in order.\n\nThe Christian churches of Alexandria\n\n7Alexandria has a special place in the histories of Christianity, Egypt, and Africa at large. According to local traditions, it is the city where St. Mark the Apostle established the first Church in Egypt, in around 42 AD. It then became the start of the Coptic Church, which later spread to other parts of Egypt and the African continent. After the split between the Eastern Orthodox and the Oriental Orthodox Churches at the Council of Chalcedon (451 AD) and the Arab invasion of 641 AD, the Coptic Church emerged as the dominant church in Egypt, representing indigenous Christians in what would gradually become a Muslim majority society (Kamil. 2002:6-7).\n\n8Alexandria was then reduced to a backwater city of 8,000 people by a millennium of neglect until the rule of Muhammed Ali (1805–49), when it emerged as a prominent port city and trading center. Foreigners from various parts of Europe and the Levant settled in Alexandria on invitation from the rulers, establishing their own communities and houses of worship in the city (Awad and Maktaba. 2006:11).\n\nThe Cosmopolitan Era\n\n10Beginning in the 1880s, Alexandria was home to sizeable communities of Greek, English, German, Italian, French, Lebanese, Armenian, and Moroccan Jewish immigrants, each with their own houses of worship and schools that bolstered their cultural presence and standing in the city (Awad and Maktaba. 2006:10–11). These schools were funded by foreign governments and run in close association with various churches, and they soon became the preferred academic institutions for local elite families, both Christian and Muslim. Cosmopolitan Alexandria has been mythologized through the literary works of Lawrence Durrell, P. C. Cavafy, E. M. Forster and others as a city of tolerance, diversity, and intermingling across cultural and religious divides (Halim. 2013). To a large extent, however, this cosmopolitan experience was limited to a rather small, elite fraction of Alexandria’s foreign communities that never made up more than a quarter of the city’s population (Fahmy, 2013). The vast majority of local inhabitants, predominantly Egyptian Copts and Muslims, were excluded from this milieu, and the cultural openness associated with these foreign communities was rarely extended to encompass the local Egyptian population (Ibid.). This is well reflected in literary accounts of cosmopolitan Alexandria, in which the city’s Arab population, particularly its Muslim majority, is rendered almost invisible (Halim. 2013). Alexandria’s foreign communities, by contrast, were characterized with a cultural confidence that allowed for social interactions and even intermarriages unimpeded by any sense that the communities themselves were threatened. This confidence, and the seamless intermingling it seemed to enable, did not last.\n\nPost-1952: Decline and reorientation\n\n11A series of historical events – namely the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, the Suez War of 1956, and the expropriation of foreign properties and financial assets in 1961­ – spelled the end of the Cosmopolitan Era. Foreigners fled the country in droves, and within a few years, Alexandria’s foreign communities were reduced to a fraction of their earlier numbers (Awad and Maktaba. 2006:12). Since then, the smaller Christian communities of Alexandria have been in continuous decline. Though foreign nationals with attachments to various non-Coptic churches have left the city, thousands of internal immigrants, primarily Egyptian Muslims from villages around Alexandria and from the Delta region, have settled in Alexandria, as have thousands of Egyptian Christians from villages in Upper Egypt. This has further transformed the social makeup of Alexandria as a city (Ali Abdelmonem. 2016:9).\n\nOngoing emigration\n\n15While some, like Hany, have reconciled themselves to the dwindling of their own communities, others insist that their communities will grow and flourish again, even though they may never reach the numbers they had in the mid-1900s.\n\nA survival strategy: renegotiating social boundaries\n\n16Members of these communities have experienced a continuous decline since the 1950s, and yet they are not necessarily characterized with a spirit of defeat. Within these communities, one can find plenty of bittersweet nostalgia, together with a determination to evolve and adjust to changing circumstances in ways that allow them to hold on to their cultural heritage and retain socially sustainable communities. Historically, members of some communities have barely interacted with each other, while others have fallen out with each other for shorter periods of time. According to older members of their communities, relations between Orthodox and Catholic Greeks and between Orthodox and Catholic Armenians were severely strained during the first half of the 20th century, which is otherwise viewed as a time of cultural tolerance.\n\n21The same dynamics can be found among the Armenians. Since 2011, the Armenian Catholic Church in Alexandria has shrunk to fewer than 100 members. The church has also lacked a resident priest for several years, so services have grown less frequent over time. In 2014, according to members of the congregation, a Cairo-based priest visited Alexandria and held a church service roughly once every two months. Other Christians have viewed the church as being closed for some time, and the Armenian Orthodox Church has warmly welcomed Armenian Catholics who wish to attend Orthodox services. Informally, church-going Catholics now attend the Orthodox Church regularly, and are becoming increasingly involved in the social activities of the other congregation.\n\n22With this level of integration between congregations, marriages between Orthodox and Catholic members of the same ethnic communities are uncontroversial, and outside these communities, distinctions between the Orthodox and Catholic branches of the same ethnic groups are largely ignored. Joseph, a young man who formally belongs to the Greek Orthodox Church but volunteers at the Latin Church, described the situation in this way:\n\n15 Interview with Joseph, April 20, 2017.\n\nWhen you say “Greek Catholic,” I just think of them all as Greek Orthodox. Those who belong to the same national community are all the same; even their church rituals are almost entirely the same. It’s the same with the Armenians, even the Copts. The Coptic Catholics may have a big community, but as I see it, they are simply Copts. There’s no difference.\n\n23Joseph’s comments were informed by his intimate knowledge of two distinct church communities, as well as his social engagement with several other churches. Initially, this sounded like a rash dismissal of the importance of doctrinal differences. These sentiments were widely echoed by other local Christians, however: within a community of local Christians, ethnicity and language tend to outweighs denomination as a line of social division.\n\n25In contrast, interactions between members of the Greek and the Syrian and Lebanese Greek Orthodox churches are cordial but limited, and marriage unions are quite rare. When I enquired about these marriages, I was told that although they might not be controversial, they are not common. Members of the Syrian Greek Orthodox congregation could not recall even one example of such a union in the last three decades. No families from the Levantine community send their children to the Greek school, which primarily prepares its students for further studies in Greece. Instead, they send their children to the German school or to one of the French schools associated with the Catholic Church.\n\nThe Armenians\n\n26The Armenians of Alexandria are believed to number fewer than 400, including those who belong to the Armenian Catholic Church. Cairo, which is still home to some 5,000 Armenians, attracts some of the younger Alexandrian Armenians, but most leave Alexandria with the aim of building new lives for themselves in other parts of the world. Those who stay behind want to keep their own community alive and pass on their heritage to their children. At the same time, they realize that the community has passed the brink of sustainability, that many young Armenians feel compelled to leave the country altogether, and that those who stay behind must find partners either among the Armenians of Cairo or among non-Armenians in Alexandria.\n\n27Michael is a young engineer from a well-connected middle-class family in Alexandria. He is single and an only child, and at the age of 27, he has been accepted for emigration to Quebec, Canada. He plans to go to Montreal, where he has relatives who can help him. He will leave behind two aging parents, and he feels badly about this, but he is intent on doing well for himself financially and plans to take good care of his parents from Montreal to the best of his ability. His parents are not willing to leave Alexandria, and for him, the city has nothing to offer in terms of career opportunities or a social life.\n\n28His friend and former classmate, Peter, is also Armenian, and has just returned from three years of studying in Greece. Unlike Michael, he is determined to stay and start a family in Alexandria. Both men talked about their families’ desire to see them marry Armenian girls. In Alexandria, this is impossible because they either know the eligible girls too well or are closely related to all the girls of appropriate age. In Cairo, it is possible to meet someone, but finding a woman who is willing to settle in Alexandria is another challenge. To Peter, this poses a dilemma:\n\n17 Interview with Peter, May 15,2014.\n\nI would love to meet an Armenian girl who shares my culture and can raise our kids as Armenians. But finding someone in Cairo who is willing to move to Alexandria is hard... and I’m not moving to Cairo.\n\n30Father Gregory, the parish priest at the Armenian Orthodox Church, is himself a Yerevan Armenian, and spent many years serving as a priest in Russia. He is deeply skeptical of these unions. He argues that local Armenians are not aware of the significance of the cultural differences, which often leaves these couples trapped in miserable marriages.\n\n31In the local context, he is very accepting of mixed marriages between young Armenians and persons belonging to another church community. At the same time, he realizes that marriages such as these mean that Armenian culture and language will be lost for new generations:\n\n19 Interview with Fader Gregory, Alexandria, October 30, 2014.\n\nIf an Armenian girl marries a non-Armenian, she and her children will belong to another church community. She may teach them the language and pass on parts of our culture, but they will belong to another church, another set of traditions. They will be lost for us. On the other hand, if an Armenian man finds a non-Armenian girl, they will marry in the Armenian Church and the children will be a part of the Armenian Church, but they will not learn the language, they will not learn the culture, and they will not see the church as their home because this is something that passes through the mother. They will not learn the culture and history of the Armenians, and our community will not be home to them. Without an Armenian mother, they will lose the Armenian culture.\n\n32Within the Armenian community, the issue of cultural preservation is of particular urgency. Thus, older members of the community have struggled to come to terms with the fact that their children can no longer find partners who share their background. This struggle illustrates a broader development among the Christian communities in Alexandria: three generations ago, these populations accepted inter-sectarian marriages out of confidence. Today, they seem to accept these unions partly out of necessity.\n\n33More broadly, many young Christians have come to see themselves as part of one diverse Christian community rather than one distinct church. For various reasons, many young people find that their personal lives and networks span more than one church community, and they take for granted the notion that they can marry someone from another church.\n\n34Joseph, the young man who was quoted earlier, is in his late 20s and does a good deal of volunteer work for the Latin Catholic Church (from now on referred to as the Latin Church) in Alexandria. He organizes social events, and spends most of his spare time with other young people who belong to the church. Though his personal life revolves around the Latin community, he does not formally belong to the Latin Church: Joseph and his brother, like their father, were baptized into the Greek Orthodox Church, and their mother originates from the Coptic Orthodox Church.\n\n35Joseph’s maternal and paternal grandmothers, however, both belonged and were strongly committed to the Latin Church. Partly because of their influence and the encouragement of friends and relatives while he was growing up, Joseph become involved in the Catholic Church, which he now considers his social and spiritual home.\n\n37In one sense, Joseph’s situation is a common one. It is not unusual among local Christians who are not members of the Coptic Church to have a sense of belonging within more than one church based on family links. At the same time, marriages across denominational lines were much less common among his parent’s generation. As Joseph explained it, his parents married at a time when sectarian boundaries were being guarded, and mixed marriages were discouraged. Because they came from families that had always embraced diversity, however, their union was supported on both sides of the family. Joseph, like his mother before him, has made the Latin Church his own even though he is formally a member of the Greek Orthodox Church. His brother, in contrast, has drifted between Greek Orthodox and Latin social circles. The freedom to choose a partner independent of her church affiliation is also quite common for someone of Joseph’s generation. His circle of friends includes people who belong to several different churches and who in some cases have married interdenominationally.\n\n38While doing my fieldwork, I spent several evenings with Joseph and a group of his friends. Sitting at a café in Alexandria, I was surrounded by four men and four women, all in their mid-20s, who belonged to four different church communities. They are all single, but have reached an age when the social pressure to marry is mounting, and so the conversation drifts to social rules and expectations regarding whom it is acceptable to marry. Each one of them stressed that they are in no way expected to marry someone who belongs to their own church. Zara, a bubbly Catholic girl, dismissed this as an option altogether:\n\n21 Fieldwork notes, May 19, 2017.\n\nThey [her parents] would love that, but our community here in Alexandria is too small. I can marry anyone I want, as long as he is a decent guy with a good job, and he is a good Christian. I can even marry a Protestant!”\n\nChristian-Muslim relations\n\nThe socioeconomic divide\n\n41Although people interact and marry across denominational lines easily, socioeconomic boundaries seem to have a much more profound influence on relationships and choices of marriage partners. When talking with young people about marriage and what they look for in a partner, I found that many stressed the possibility of marrying someone from a different church, but also viewed socioeconomic equality as essential. Fadi, a young Coptic Catholic who was on the lookout for a suitable partner, emphasized the importance of being at the same social and economic level:\n\n24 Interview with Fadi, May 20, 2014.\n\nIf she’s from a wealthier background, she will not be satisfied with the kind of lifestyle you can provide for her. At the same time, someone poorer and poorly educated will make you think about what kind of mother she can be to your children.\n\n42In this context, the most important social divide is between those who attended private schools and those who had to settle for public, government-funded schools. Many old reputable schools in Alexandria are run by or in association with various churches. They are partly funded by foreign governments and thus can hire highly-qualified teachers and offer premier educations.\n\n43The public schools, in comparison, are critically understaffed and underfunded, and are often unable to provide a decent education for their students. Most of the private schools charge very high tuition fees that are financially beyond the reach of most Egyptian families. Church funds and other financial sources enable many Christians to secure private school educations for their children. Nonetheless, in most congregations, only a sizeable minority have access to private education, whereas the majority must attend public schools.\n\n44This creates a massive social divide, even within small church communities. Those who share the privilege of private education tend to band together and create their own social circles within the congregation. A few churches even offer separate church services for those with public school educations.\n\n45Under these circumstances, friendship ties and romantic connections emerge easily among Christians who attend the same types of school and in other ways identify as being at the same socioeconomic level even if they do not belong to the same church. Also, in a society where socioeconomic differences are viewed as highly important, young people face strong familial pressure not to marry below their station. As such, when young Christians talk about what they look for in a potential spouse, they tend to highlight the importance of economic standing and education rather than denominational belonging. This focus on economic standing is found among Egyptian Muslims as well, as is evident from much of the recent ethnographic work (Ghannam, 2013, Naguib 2015, Schielke 2015). However, among local Christians, this serves to dramatically reduce already limited pools of potential partners.\n\nPatriarchal privilege\n\n46When it comes to mixed marriages, the Christians of Alexandria follow the general rule of patriarchal privilege: they marry in the groom’s church, and the couple and their children belong to the same church. This principle generally allows mixed marriages to be negotiated smoothly: when the families involved meet, the most contentious issue has already been resolved.\n\n47On the one hand, this reflects a broad reverence for patriarchal principles and a social emphasis on patrilineal family ties. On the other, the justification for these rules and their social effects places broad emphasis on the powers women can possess within a patriarchal family structure. In families where the men are the main breadwinners and the women take care of the house and look out for the children on a day-to-day basis, the mothers are seen as the ones who shape the minds, identities, and characters of the children.\n\n48Ibrahim, a minister in an Evangelical church in Alexandria and the father of three girls, is very explicit about this structure. He recognizes that their own church community of some 300 members is too small to provide every member with a suitable spouse, so most members of the church must find partners outside their own community.\n\n49To him, this is quite natural and should not be seen as a loss. In Ibrahim’s view, the primary mission of his church is to instill Christian faith and values in its members rather than to promote an official identity as members of the church. As such, when a female member of his church marries a man from another church, he takes comfort in the idea that she will instill in her husband and children the faith and mindset she has developed as a part of his congregation and community. Sometimes, a wife even brings her husband and children to Ibrahim’s church on a regular basis, even though she now belongs to her husband’s church.\n\n51Similar arrangements have been described for intermarriages between members of the Armenian Orthodox and Latin Churches. This flexibility reflects a mutual recognition of equal standing between members of different churches and a wish to emphasize the couple’s commonalities as Christians rather than their differences.\n\nThe Coptic exception\n\n54This is one of several ways in which Coptic Orthodox Church leaders are seen as acting arrogantly in relation to other churches. According to other church leaders in Alexandria, the late Coptic Pope Shenouda III was notorious for his contempt toward other Egyptian Christian groups. Under his leadership, the Coptic Church shifted between ignoring smaller churches and actively trying to marginalize them in relation to the Egyptian authorities. According to several Alexandrian church leaders, this policy of domination changed significantly with the succession of Pope Tawadros II. Under his leadership, the Coptic Orthodox Church has begun to approach smaller churches with newfound respect and humility. When it comes to mixed marriages, however, the position of the Coptic Orthodox Church remains unchanged, and is viewed as especially offensive by members of the other churches, not just because it asserts the dominance of the Coptic Orthodox Church but also because it sets Coptic dominance above patriarchal privilege.\n\n55Fadi, a 25-year-old Coptic Catholic, recalled his own romantic involvement with a girl who belonged to the Coptic Orthodox Church. They spent a year getting to know each other before involving their families, and according to Fadi, they were both very committed to being with each other. Her family insisted, however, that he had to convert and that they had to be married in the Coptic Orthodox Church. As a deeply religious man with a strong commitment to his own church, Fadi could not bring himself to convert. Thus, he and his girlfriend believed they had no choice but to break up. Two years later, the girl married someone else, but Fadi is still not over her. At the same time, he insists that he made the right decision.\n\n57Aside from institutional factors, Egyptian Copts are widely perceived as being more socially conservative than other Christians in Alexandria. In some cases, the Copts are described as being “more like the Muslims”, among non-Coptic Christians. Joseph and his circle of friends, who come from five or six different churches, make frequent jokes about how the Copts are arrogant and socially conservative in ways that set them apart from other Christians.\n\nUnity in times of Darkness\n\n59While relations between the Coptic Orthodox Church and other churches can be contentious, points of mutual tension are swept aside in times of great adversity. The Spring and Summer of 2017 was a tough period among Egyptian Christians. In different parts of the country, Copts have been the targets of several brutal attacks by ISIS-Egypt, an Egyptian branch of the Levantine extremist organization, that have claimed more than 100 Coptic lives. These terrorist strikes included a Palm Sunday attack on St. Mark’s Cathedral that took the lives of eight local Copts. These developments have triggered a heightened sense of shared destiny among local Christians in general. On the occasion of Pope Francis’s visit to Egypt, ISIS directed threats toward Catholics, while undetonated bombs were found at non-Coptic churches in Alexandria and Cairo, reminding local Christians that they were all potential targets.\n\n60At times, Coptic Orthodox leaders are willing to show some flexibility in dealing with other church communities. For instance, in April 2017, St. Mark’s Cathedral was the scene of a wedding between a local Coptic man and a woman who belonged to a Latin family. The bride’s uncle was a brother in the Franciscan Order based at St. Catherine’s Cathedral in Mansheya, Alexandria. The wedding ceremony was a Coptic ceremony led by a Coptic priest. However, a number of monks from the Franciscan Order took part in the wedding ceremony alongside a Coptic Catholic priest, and they contributed by singing a hymn while the bride’s uncle recited the Lord’s Prayer. According to one of his colleagues, he was allowed to recite the Catholic version of the prayer, which deviates a little from the Coptic version. This was noticed and appreciated by the Catholic guests at the wedding as a gesture of generosity on the part of the Coptic clergy.\n\n61Members of Alexandria’s smaller churches are making efforts to establish new bonds of friendship and trust with other Christian sects based on mutual respect and a sense of being on an equal footing. With time, they hope the Coptic Orthodox Church will join them in these efforts.\n\nConclusion\n\n62Central Alexandria is dotted with large, beautiful, but mostly empty churches. These houses of worship serve as reminders of a time when Orthodox, Catholic, and Protestant communities of different national origins had a significant presence in the city. Today, these groups are struggling to survive. Whatever their motivations, members of these communities are looking beyond the confines of their own congregations to build friendships and establish marital bonds with members of other churches. Under new circumstances, they are returning to practices that are believed to have been more common a few generations ago, when marriages between people of different backgrounds were more broadly accepted. In the past, this openness may have been an expression of a certain communal confidence within communities, whereas today, the acceptance of marriage unions such as these may be seen partly as an expression of a ‘chosen openness’ under new circumstances, and partly as a strategy for survival. Rather than clinging to their own small churches as distinct cultural enclaves, Alexandria Christians are creating small social worlds in which members of different churches interact and see each other as part of a broader religious community. This movement can be seen not as a signal of defeat, but rather as a defiant adjustment to new realities, one that taps into values and ideals associated with a not-so-distant past."
