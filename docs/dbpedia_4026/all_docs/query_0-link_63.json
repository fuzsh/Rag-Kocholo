        "text": "You will be picked up by a professional guide, who will then drive you through the narrow lanes of Old Cairo to get to the southern fringes, where Coptic Cairo is located. Hanging Church of the Virgin Mary, located on top of the water gate. The church dates from the 7th century. It has magnificent dark interiors with cedar paneling, with wooden ark ceiling, and a marble pulpit supported by 12 pillars.\n\nDuration: 30 minutes\n\nThe Church of St. George is a Greek Orthodox church within the Babylon Fortress in Coptic Cairo. It is part of the Holy Patriarchal Monastery of St George under the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria and all of Africa. The church dates back to the 10th century (or earlier). The current structure was rebuilt following a 1904 fire, construction was finished in 1909. Since 2009, the monastery’s hegumen has had the rank of bishop with the title Bishop Babylonos.\n\nDuration: 15 minutes\n\nThe Monastery of Saint Simon, also known as the Cave Church, is located in the Mokattam mountain in southeastern Cairo. Seven churches and chapels are hidden within a series of caves inside the Monastery; the Virgin Mary and St. Simon Cathedral is the largest church. Inside the spacious caverns, beautiful engravings cover the walls, each representing stories from the Bible. St. Simon’s Hall, a large seating arena that accommodates 2,000 people for spiritual meetings, sits on the upper level.\n\nThe Monastery also includes an education center, an area for children, as well as a school for the deaf. Now considered one of the largest Coptic monasteries in Egypt, the grandeur of the churches hidden within the heart of the Mokattam Hills belie their relatively recent construction.\n\nDuration: 30 minutes"
