        "text": "The Patriarchate of Alexandria referred to the Synodal decision of 2016.\n\nThe Patriarchate of Alexandria commented on the decision of Metropolitan Serafim (Kykotis) of Zimbabwe to ordain Angelic Molen as a deaconess, which has sparked controversial reactions in the Orthodox world. The statement was published on the website of the Patriarchate of Alexandria.\n\nThe decision to reinstate the institution of deaconesses was made by the Synod of the Patriarchate of Alexandria back in 2016, but its implementation was postponed as further study of issues related to the attire, method of service, and liturgical role of deaconesses in the life of the modern Church was required.\n\nThe statement notes that the service of deaconesses is \"necessary for the mission in Africa, primarily for the fulfillment of pastoral duties and the baptism of adult women.\"\n\nRegarding the case of Molen, the Patriarchate of Alexandria notes that Metropolitan Serafim \"applied in practice the initial decision of the Synod\", which was not ratified because the study of all the issues necessary for making a final decision on deaconesses has not yet been completed, according to the statement.\n\nThe Patriarchate of Alexandria underscored that pursuant to church canons, deaconesses do not participate in the administration of the Church sacraments. However, in a photo published earlier, Molen is shown administering communion to parishioners.\n\nAs reported by the the UOJ, Metropolitan Seraphim of Zimbabwe stated that the deaconess \"is going to do what the deacon is doing in the Liturgy and in all the sacraments in our Orthodox services.\"\n\nIf you notice an error, select the required text and press Ctrl+Enter or Submit an error to report it to the editors."
