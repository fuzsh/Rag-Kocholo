        "text": "The Orthodox Church in Kenya was established from the beginning of this century. First Greek emigrants brought the Orthodox faith to this country and then the Africans themselves discovered it and have embraced it since 1930.\n\nThe people of Kenya were officially accepted under the jurisdiction of the Patriarchate of Alexandria in 1946 and since then there has been a close relationship with the Apostolic See of St. Mark. Through the Patriarchate of Alexandria the Orthodox African people of Kenya are recognised internationally.\n\nDuring the emergency period the Orthodox Church of Kenya played a leading part in the struggle for the Independence of the country. The Mau Mau movement had many leaders from the Orthodox faithful especially in Kiambu. It was during this time that Orthodox Schools and Churches were closed by the colonial government and many Orthodox priests were imprisoned.\n\nIn 1958, because of the rapid development of the Orthodox faith in East Africa, a Metropolitan was appointed to care for the Spiritual needs of the three East African countries. The name which was given by the Holy Synod of the Patriarchate of Alexandria was the Holy Archbishopric of Irinoupolis which means the “City of Peace“.\n\nThe late Archbishop and President of Cyprus Makarios III, a leading personality in the fight for the independence of his country was closely associated with the President and leader of the independence movement of Kenya, Mzee Jomo Kenyatta. Archbishop Makarios of Cyprus, on the invitation of the Mzee Kenyatta visited Kenya and was given the warm welcome of a national hero. His love for the African Orthodox people of Kenya is evident through the construction of a Technical School and a Theological Seminary for the education of the African people. The African Orthodox people of Kenya owe their spiritual growth in the Orthodox faith to the great generosity of the late Archbishop Makarios. The Orthodox Patriarchal Seminary today serves not only the needs of the people of East Africa but of Western Africa also.\n\nThe African Orthodox Church of Kenya under the canonical jurisdiction of the Holy Archbishopric of Irinoupolis is the only legitimate Church in the country. Today through the generosity of the Orthodox people from abroad (Greece, Finland, America, Cyprus) the Orthodox Church in Kenya is making a great contribution to the social, economic and educational development of the country, Many Secondary Schools, Clinics, Nursery Schools and hospitals are to be found throughout the country and hundreds of Scholarships are given to children of Kenya for their educational needs. The number of Orthodox faithful in Kenya is increasing daily\n\nTHE SYMBOL OF OUR FAITH\n\nEnglish\n\nI believe in one God, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible.\n\nAnd in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, begotten of the Father before all ages; Light of Light, true God of true God, begotten, not created, of one essence with the Father through Whom all things were made.\n\nWho for us men and for our salvation came down from heaven and was incarnate of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary and became man.\n\nHe was crucified for us under Pontius Pilate, and suffered and was buried; And He rose on the third day, according to the Scriptures.\n\nHe ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father; And He will come again with glory to judge the living and dead.\n\nHis kingdom shall have no end. And in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the Creator of life, Who proceeds from the Father, Who together with the Father and the Son is worshipped and glorified, Who spoke through the prophets.\n\nIn one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church.\n\nI confess one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.\n\nI look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the age to come. Amen.\n\nSwahili\n\nNasadiki Mungu Moja, Baba mwenyezi, Mwumba wa mbingu , na wa nchi, hata vyote vilivyoonekana na visivyoonekana. Tena Bwana mmoja, Yesu Kristo, Mwana wa pekee wa Mungu, aliyezaliwa na Baba kabla ya wakati wowote. Nuru toka nuru, Mungu kweli toka Mungu Kweli, aliyezaliwa, hakuumbwa, aliye wa asili moja na Baba, kwa yeye vyote vilifanywa. Aliyeshuka mbinguni kwa ajili yetu wanadamu na ya wokovu wetu, akapata mwili kwa Maria bikira na kwa Roho Mtakatifu, hata kuwa mtu. Aliyesulubiwa kwa ajili yetu wakati wa enzi ya Pontio Pilato, akateswa, akawekwa kaburini. Aliyefufuka katika siku ya tatu, kama Maandiko yanenavyo. Aliyepaa mbinguni; ndipo anapokaa kuume kwa Baba. Atakayekuja mara ya pili kwa utukufu kuwahukumu wahai na wafu; na ufalme wake utakua bila mwisho. tena nasadiki Roho mtakatifu, yu Bwana, Yu mpajiwa uhai, anayetoka kwa Baba, aliyesujudiwa na kutukuzwa pamoja na Baba na Mwana, aliyenena kwa midomo ya manabii. Tenab nasadiki Ekklesia moja, takatifu, Katholiki na Mitume. Naungama ubatizo moja kwa maondoleo ya dhambi. Natumaini ufufuo wa wafu, hata uzima wa ulimwengu utakaokuja . Amina"
