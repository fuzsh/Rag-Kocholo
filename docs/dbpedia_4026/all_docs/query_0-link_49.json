        "text": "Orthodoxy was a theme of King Charles of England’s Christmas speech to his nation and world. Orthodoxy in Africa Archimandrite Chrysostom Onyekakeyah of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria and all Africa, Rev. Giorgi Tskitishirli of St. Vladimir’s Orthodox Seminary in Yonkers, New York performed the liturgy on the “Sunday of Orthodoxy” with presbyter Rev. Andrew Cadieux of the Transfiguration Church. The priests conducted the liturgy and Greek, English, Nigerian and Georgian languages. An interest in Orthodoxy is widespread for many reasons.\n\nA friend gave me information on the Coptic monastery of the Virgin Mary at Al-Muharrag in Qosqam. Ancient sanctuaries were not only places of worship, but a physical location that had been consecrated by notable acts od holiness or sacrifice. Biblical scholar and attorney Dr. Jeannie Constantinou said in her podcast The Massacre of the Innocents and Flight to Egypt said “The gospel does not tell us where Mary, Joseph and baby Jesus lived in him Egypt. They went there for at least two years. The Coptic church has a tradition of where Jesus and Mary lived. I encourage all to visit these places because there are churches built on these sites. The memory of these place is kept alive. The Bible is a historical document written in the living memory of persons. They are all original, first-generation sources and not likely invented. The stories were written by persons who knew and most likely as historical sources.”\n\nOur family friend, whose identity is anonymous, gave us information and souvenirs of the Coptic monastery of the Virgin Mary at Al-Muharrag. It lies on the path of the flight of the Holy Family in Egypt, south of Cairo. It is not located in the desert. They left Egypt when Joseph in a dream was informed by an angel “”Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel; for they are dead which sought the young child’s life”. (Matthew 2:20 & 21).\n\nAs Christianity spread in Egypt, from the preaching by saying more of the hospital and evangelists, churches were built throughout its land. Among many the very same house with the holy family lived, as confirmed from Coptic tradition, led later became the church dedicated to the name of the holy Virgin Mary.\n\nThe Church of the Holy Virgin Mary (al-Adra), which lies next to the square tower, is the oldest church in the monastery and is believed to date to the first century AD. The Church of St. George was built in the 19th century in place of an older one that dated from the 18th century. The most notable characteristic is of this church is its two high steeples and Byzantine/Greek styled Iconostases. The library of the monastery is divided into two main sections: modern books and reference material dating from the 19th and 20th centuries of religion, science Coptic, Greek, Arabic, English and Amharic and hand-written manuscripts in Coptic and Arabic dating back to 13th century.\n\nThe Coptic icon art is not only a religious art. It is an authentic popular art that expresses the feelings of the people. In spite of terrible persecution, Coptic art is positive. It expresses joyful life filled with victorious spirit and power of soul prevailing of innocents, love, and the kindness and purity of soul. The icons in the iconostasis attracts the person to eternal glory.\n\nThe Church of the Holy Virgin Mary (known as St. George Church) became the destination of visitors through the generations. The needy and the sick found shelter and. Each year multitudes of pilgrims from every district continued to visit the monastery, as the location is well known for its science, wonders, and healing of many diseases.\n\nWarren Treadgold in his article “The Persistence of Byzantium” says “Ever since a population exchange in 1923 removed most of the Greeks from Turkey, few people have spoken Greek outside Greece and Cyprus. Yet a patriarch of Constantinople remains in Turkish Istanbul as head of the Eastern Orthodox Church. Eastern Orthodoxy remains the majority faith not only in Greece and Cyprus but in Russia, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Macedonia, Romania, Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia, and Belarus. Eastern Orthodox Christians remain significant minorities in Albania, Syria, and Lebanon–and in the United States, Canada, and Australia. Most Armenians and many Egyptians and Ethiopians remain Eastern Christians without formally belonging to Eastern Orthodoxy. All of these groups have inherited much of their culture from Byzantium. It is mainly people who are not Eastern Christians whom Byzantium still perplexes.”4In 2023, Eastern Orthodoxy is entering the consciousness of Western leaders, scholars and general public.\n\nArchimandrite Chrysostom Onyekakeyah of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria and all Africa,(right) conducting liturgy with Rev.
