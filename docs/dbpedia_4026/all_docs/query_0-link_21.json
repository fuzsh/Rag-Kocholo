Its primate is the Pope and Patriarch of Alexandria and All Africa, the successor to the Apostle Mark the Evangelist, who founded the Church of Alexandria in the 1st century. It is one of the five ancient patriarchates of the early Church, called the Pentarchy.\n\nHistory\n\nWhen Alexander the Great conquered Egypt about 332-331 BC he established the city of Alexandria, named after him, from which his Greek-speaking successors, the Ptolemy dynasty, ruled Egypt. Alexandria also had many Greek-speaking Jewish inhabitants, and it was here that the Old Testament scriptures were translated into Greek, the Septuagint version. During the first century BC the city, and Egypt generally passed under Roman rule.\n\nSt Mark, a disciple of St Peter evangelised Egypt in the middle of the first century. He probably arrived about AD 40, and met a martyr's death around AD 63. Little is known of the early history of the Church in Alexandria and Egypt, beyond a bare list of names of bishops. By the end of the second century, however, the church had begun to spread among the indigenous population, and the Scriptures and Liturgical texts were being translated into local languages.\n\nSince the schism occurring as a result of the political and Christological controversies at the Council of Chalcedon (451 A.D.), the portion of the Church of Alexandria loyal to Chalcedonian Christology has liturgically been Greek-speaking, the majority of its native (i.e., Coptic) population and their modern descendents becoming a part of the Coptic Orthodox Church (i.e., non-Chalcedonian).\n\nThe Church today\n\nIn recent years, a considerable missionary effort was enacted by Pope Petros VII. During his seven years as patriarch (1997-2004), he worked tirelessly to spread the Orthodox Faith in Arab nations and throughout Africa, raising up native clergy and encouraging the use of local languages in the liturgical life of the Church. Missions spread and thrived in Kenya, Uganda, Madagascar, Cameroon, and elsewhere across the African continent.\n\nParticularly sensitive to the nature of Christian expansion into Muslim countries, His Beatitude worked to promote mutual understanding and respect between Orthodox Christians and Muslims. His efforts were ended as the result of a helicopter crash on September 11, 2004, in the Aegean Sea near Greece, killing him and several other clergy, including Bishop Nektarios of Madagascar, another bishop with a profound missionary vision.\n\nToday, some 300,000 Orthodox Christians comprise the Patriarchate of Alexandria, the highest number since the Roman Empire. The current primate of the Church of Alexandria is His Beatitude Theodoros II, Pope and Patriarch of Alexandria and All Africa.\n\nThe Episcopacy\n\nThe Holy Synod\n\nHis Beatitude Theodoros II, Pope and Patriarch of Alexandria and All Africa\n\nHis Eminence Makarios (Tillyrides), Metropolitan of Nairobi and Kenya\n\nHis Eminence Seraphim (Kykkotis), Metropolitan of Zimbabwe-Angola and Southern Africa\n\nHis Eminence Alexandros (Gianniris), Metropolitan of Nigeria and the Gulf of Guinea\n\nHis Eminence Theophylaktos (Tzoumerkas), Metropolitan of Tripoli and Lybia\n\nHis Eminence Sergios (Kykkotis), Metropolitan of Good Hope and All Natal and Dependencies\n\nHis Eminence Ieronymos (Muzeeyi), Metropolitan of Mwanza and Western Tanzania\n\nHis Eminence George (Vladimirou), Metropolitan of Guinea and the African Coast\n\nHis Eminence Nicholas II (Antoniou), Metropolitan of Hermopolis and Egypt Primum\n\nHis Eminence Dimitrios (Zaharengas), Metropolitan of Irinoupolis and Eastern Tanzania and Seychelles\n\nHis Eminence Damaskinos (Papandreou), Metropolitan of Johannesburg-Pretoria and All South Africa\n\nHis Eminence Ignatios (Sennis), Metropolitan of Antananarivo-Northern Madagascar and Indian Islands\n\nHis Eminence Emmanuel (Kiagias), Metropolitan of Ptolemais and Upper Egypt\n\nHis Eminence Gregory (Stergiou), Metropolitan of Cameroon and Central Africa\n\nHis Eminence Gabriel (Raftopoulos), Metropolitan of Leontopolis and Augustamnica Secunda and the Red Sea\n\nHis Eminence Nikodemos II (Priangelos), Metropolitan of Memphis and Egypt\n\nHis Eminence Meletios (Kamiloudes), Metropolitan of Katanga and Mainland Africa\n\nHis Eminence Gennadios (Stantzios), Metropolitan of Botswana and the Kalahari\n\nHis Eminence Savvas (Heimonetos), Metropolitan of Nubia and All Sudan and Eritrea\n\nHis Eminence Ioannis (Tsaftaridis), Metropolitan of Zambia and Middle Africa\n\nHis Eminence Panteleimon (Arathymos), Metropolitan of Brazzaville-Gabon and Atlantic Africa\n\nHis Eminence Innocent (Byakatonda), Metropolitan of Burundi-Rwanda and Inner Africa\n\nHis Eminence Meletios (Koumanis), Metropolitan of Carthage and North Africa\n\nHis Eminence Daniel (Biazis), Metropolitan of Aksum and All Ethiopia\n\nHis Eminence Theodosios (Tsitsivos), Metropolitan of Kananga and Equatorial Africa\n\nHis Eminence Petros II (Parginos), Metropolitan of Accra and West Africa\n\nAuxiliary Metropolitans\n\nHis Eminence Athanasios (Kykkotis), Metropolitan of Cyrene and the Libyan Sea\n\nHis Eminence Theodoros (Dimitriou), Metropolitan of Heliopolis and Middle Egypt\n\nHis Eminence Narkissos (Gammoh), Metropolitan of Naucratis and the Egyptian Nile\n\nDiocesan Bishops\n\nHis Grace Neophytos (Kongai), Bishop of Nyeri-Mount Kenya\n\nHis Grace Agathonikos (Nikolaidis), Bishop of Arusha-Central Tanzania\n\nHis Grace Sylvestros (Kisitu), Bishop of Gulu-Eastern Uganda\n\nHis Grace Photios (Hatziantoniou), Bishop of Malawi\n\nHis Grace Prodromos (Katsoulis), Bishop of Toliara-Southern Madagascar\n\nHis Grace Markos (Theodosis), Bishop of Kisumu-Western Kenya\n\nTitular Metropolitans\n\nHis Excellency Porphyrios (Skikos), Metropolitan of Thebes\n\nTitular Bishops\n\nHis Grace Nicholas (Boulaxis), Bishop of Nitria\n\nHis Grace Theodoros (Dridakis), Bishop of Babylon\n\nHis Grace Germanos (Galanis), Bishop of Damietta\n\nRetired Bishops\n\nHis Eminence Panteleimon (Lampadarios), Metropolitan of Antinoe\n\nHis Grace Vasilios (Varvelis), Bishop of Arsinoe\n\nHoly Metropolises and Bishoprics\n\nBishopric Established See Jurisdiction Metropolis of Carthage 1st c.
