On June 18, 2020, Patriarch Theodore II of Alexandria and All Africa presided over Orthros and the Divine Liturgy at the Chapel of St. Joseph, located in the catacombs of the Holy Patriarchal Monastery of St. George in Old Cairo. Metropolitan Nikodimos of Memphis, Metropolitan Nifon of Pelusium and Bishop Germanos of Tamiathus accompanied the Patriarch.

Prior to the dismissal of the Divine Liturgy, the Patriarch ordained and enthroned the new Abbot of the Holy Monastery of St. George of Old Cairo, Archimandrite Damaskinos Alazrai.

After the Divine Liturgy, the Patriarch consecrated the Holy Chapel of Saint Parthenius of Lampsacus.

Finally, the Patriarch went to the catacombs of the Monastery, accompanied by the Bishops and the clergy, where all the Patriarchs of Alexandria are buried. He offered a Trisagion service to the late Patriarchs Parthenius, Nikolaos and Petros.

The Patriarch stressed, “I lay these flowers on the tomb of the Patriarch who ordained me thirty years ago. May God repose his soul and may their bright examples be a role model for all of us. Every Patriarch’s tomb is a link, like a Byzantine chandelier, which illuminates the dome that is called the Patriarchate of Alexandria and All Africa. May their souls rest in peace. I want to thank them.
