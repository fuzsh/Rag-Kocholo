        "text": "I love the public‚Äôs interest in music in prisons. üéµ HOWEVER!‚Äîas a board-certified music therapist who worked in a California state prison for years, I wish NPR (or anyone writing on this topic) would also include info about music *therapy* programs that exist(ed) in some CA state prisons. Most important, given how much this topic moves the public, I wish there would be more light shed on how many of these programs have been gutted/shut down, despite research supporting their efficacy and organized efforts from music therapists to advocate at the capitol for equitable access to music and music *therapy* (as a research-based mental health treatment) in prisons. Public advocacy in support of music therapy in prisons would help increase equitable access both to music AND music therapy for incarcerated folx. üîî UPDATE: I decided to write an article (‚ÄúMusic Behind Bars: Confessions of a Former Prison Music Therapist‚Äù) on my experiences as a music therapist in a CA state prison to help describe what it was like and how/why many of these programs were de-prioritized by CDCR and what I think we can do about it. I hope you‚Äôll read it here: https://lnkd.in/grrM3NmJ #music #prison #musictherapy #mentalhealth\n\nüé∂ The Transformative Power of Music Behind Bars üé∂ I stumbled upon an article on NPR that struck a chord in my heart. It's about Joe Garcia, an inmate who found solace in Taylor Swift's music while serving his sentence. His story resonates deeply with me and, I suspect, with many others in similar situations. The introduction of tablets in our facility has been transformative. Suddenly, we have a world of music at our fingertips. And it's not just about entertainment; it's about maintaining our humanity, our connection to emotions, memories, and hopes that seem so distant now. I listen to music daily, letting melodies and lyrics transport me to different places and states of mind. The mindfulness meditations available are particularly powerful. They help me find a sense of peace and grounding amidst the chaos and noise of prison life. Music has become one of the major factors in helping me get through my time here. It's a source of comfort, a reminder of the beauty in the world, and a tool for maintaining my mental health. I've discovered artists and genres I never knew before, and each song feels like a new friend, a companion on this journey. I share this because I want to highlight the importance of access to music and mindfulness resources for those incarcerated. It's not just a luxury; it's a necessity for mental and emotional well-being. As we continue to advocate for better conditions and rehabilitative resources in prisons, let's not forget the power of music and meditation to heal, to inspire, and to connect us to the part of ourselves that this environment can never take away. To those on the outside: next time you listen to your favorite song, remember that somewhere, behind bars, that same melody might be helping someone get through their toughest days. https://lnkd.in/gzUMAWmU #MusicHeals #PrisonReform #Mindfulness #Rehabilitation #IncarcerationStories Televerde"
