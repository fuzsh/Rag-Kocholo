        "text": "Brooklyn based Israeli guitarist Yosi Piamenta, affectionately nicknamed The Hasidic Hendrix, and Sephardic Santana by members of the NY press, continues \\'Bridging The Gap\", between peoples of different cultural backgrounds through the music of his \\'Heavenly Jams Band\\'. Mr. Piamenta, who was discovered, and brought to America, by Jazz legend Stan Getz 30 years ago, is a major star in the world of religious Jewish music. The Piamenta Band, featuring Yosi and flutist brother Avi Piamenta, are an extremely popular live act. The frenetic fusion of Judeo-Arabic Oriental scales, with it's quarter-tones and wild spiraling improvisations, blended together with classic rock wha-wha guitar riffs and manic flute interplay has helped reshape the landscape of popular Jewish music. In June of 2004 Yosi, & Oteil Burbridge, bassist of The Allman Brothers Band, came together in NYC for a loose jam jokingly billed as the \"Heavenly Jams Band\". The well received show led to a number of different collaborations with American born musicians, all sharing Yosi\\'s passion for musical improvisation and exploration. \"Bridging The Gap\" continues the HJB vision of opening listeners up to different genres of music. Joining Yosi on this release are Yonrico Scott, Kofi Burbridge, and Todd Smallie of the Derek Trucks Band, Shai Bachar, Kenwood Dennard, and other renowned musicians from the worlds of rock, blues, and Jazz."
