        "text": "Kaliver Rebbe Sings Sol O Kokosh Mar At Danube River\n\nMore then 200 rabbis on Monday March 24th 2014 commemorated the 70th anniversary of the extermination of Hungarian Jewry by the Nazis, during a memorial in Budapest.\n\nThe commemoration was organized in the framework of the two-day annual conference of the Rabbinical Center of Europe, (RCE), an organization dedicated to assist rabbis across the continent. The conference brought more then 200 rabbis from across Europe and Israel in the Hungarian capital in order to discuss issues relating to assimilation and communal attrition. The Rabbis marched several blocks along the banks of the Danube River to the Shoes on the Danube Promenade, a Holocaust memorial site. The memorial is the site of a massacre by Hungarian fascists who lined Jews up along the river, made them remove their shoes and shot them, allowing their bodies to land in the Danube.\n\nAccording to Yad Vashem in Jerusalem, some 568,000 Hungarian Jews were murdered during the Holocaust.\n\nHolocaust survivor Chief Rabbi Menachem Mendel Taub, the ‘’Kaliver Rebbe’’ were also in attendance. The Kaliver Rebbe, who was born in Transylvania, returned on Monday to the country that expelled him and his family to Auschwitz, which he left alone at the end of the war after serious torture. \"The SS took us from the bunker, 20 people,\" he said. \"They didn't bring us any food or drink for two days. We had a small pocket with breadcrumbs, and each of us took our the crumbs and put them on the floor, so that if someone was already starving to death, they would still have something to live on.\"\n\nRebbe Isaac Taub of Kalov, zy\"a, (1751-1821) overheard this Hungarian song being sung by a gentile shepherd boy. He recognized the tune to be from the ancient Holy Temple in Jerusalem. He \"bought\" the song from the boy, and the boy immediately forgot the song once the Rebbe learned it. He added the words in Hebrew about Temple, recognizing the story of the bird to actually be a parable of the exile of the Jewish people, and the importance of waiting for God to take us home, and not to take matters into our own hands.\n\nClick Here for More Videos of this Event\n\nYaancha by Yosi & Avi Piamenta Feat: Naftali Kalfa\n\nUpon learning of Yossi Piamenta’s current medical situation, Naftali Kalfa composed the song “Yaancha.\" When Naftali went to visit Yossi in NY, they soon found themselves in familiar settings, a recording studio making music.\n\nThis song is produced & arranged by Yosi Piamenta, may he merit a long life until 120!\n\nThe song is dedicated to the speedy recovery of “Yoseph ben Genia” (Yosi Piamenta) and all the sick amongst Israel.\n\nThe brothers Piamenta first started their careers back in the 70’s when they were the first pioneers of their genre and created a rock band with heavy Chasidic and Middle Eastern influences which swept up the youth of that generation and ours. Since then they have been collaborating with big names in music and have performed all over the world.\n\nNaftali Kalfa has released 2 albums. The first was a joint project with the Piamenta brothers, “Yehyu Leratzon”. The second album, released in 2013, “The Naftali Kalfa Project” is a double album. In it Naftali hosts Yosi Piamenta among others\n\nYaancha by Yosi & Avi Piamenta feat: Naftali Kalfa\n\nComposed by Naftali Kalfa\n\nArranged by Yosi Piamenta\n\nProduced & directed by Moni Piamenta\n\nVocals :Naftali Kalfa & Avi Piamenta"
