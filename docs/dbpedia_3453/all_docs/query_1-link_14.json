        "text": "By COLlive reporter\n\nMusician Yosi Piamenta, one of the most beloved and veteran voices in the Jewish music scene, woke from a medically induced coma this past Friday night.\n\nPiamenta, who is battling cancer, underwent surgery at Tel HaShomer Hospital in Israel on Thursday from which he had not woken by Friday morning. Prayers were said for him around the world, including over 100 readers on COLlive committing to recite Tehillim in his merit.\n\nOver the course of Friday night – the exact time was not provided – Piamenta awoke, to the joy of his family.\n\nSpeaking on Sunday with the Israeli COL website, the musician credited the many prayers on his behalf.\n\n“After I woke up from the surgery, I heard that so many people from so many places were saying Tehillim and praying for me,” he said in a phone conversation.\n\n“I simply don’t know how to thank all the people, that without me knowing and without me being there to thank them, are praying for me,” he said. “There is no question that the prayers helped my recovery and helped my healing. It is clear to me that all the blessings and prayers help me directly.”\n\nPiamenta added, “I am grateful to everyone and wish blessings to each one who prayed for me. May Hashem repay them with all they need and fulfill their heart’s wishes for good.”\n\nPiamenta, a guitar virtuoso, is known for his duos with his flutist brother Avi Piamenta. Playing rock and roll tunes, often infused with heavy rock licks and extended guitar solos, all while keeping true to his faith, has inspired many over the years.\n\nHis brother Avi Piamenta told COLlive that Yosi awoke late Friday night, and continued to gain strength as the day continued. “He will be staying in the hospital over next few days to recuperate, and the doctors will determine when he will be released based on his condition,” he said."
