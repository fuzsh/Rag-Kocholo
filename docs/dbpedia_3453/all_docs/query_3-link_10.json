        "text": "Chabad singer-songwriter Barak Grossberg (30) is a converted singer, guitarist and rocker, and will soon release a new and third single from the upcoming album, this time hosting world flutist and Chabad singer Avi Piamenta (65) in honor of the Hanukkah miracle.\n\nThe story of the two is interesting and unique, on the one hand – Barak‘s father, the legendary rock producer Shaul Grossberg produced Piamenta in the 70’s, and on the other hand – Barak first came to the Chabad house following Avi‘s flute playing from outside, on King George Street In the center of Tel Aviv. That evening, Barak‘s view of the ultra-Orthodox world changed significantly and he began the process of repentance as a result.\n\nThe new song “OMG” is an exciting light rock ballad, much like Barak‘s previous songs. The content of the song together with the impressive video clip produced by the Chabad photographer Yanki Elharar, tells the story of the two while actor Yishai Yedida Barry plays Barak before his repentance.\n\nThe hymn, performed by two Chabad followers, was written with the aim of breaking down barriers between the sectors through the popular slang “OMG” which is associated with the non-religious world.\n\nRecently, Barak received media coverage in a variety of programs in the ultra-Orthodox and religious press about his personal cross-border story. Only recently there was a major cover story published about his shared story with Piamenta in the newspaper “Mishpacha” including a cover story in the corresponding newspaper abroad.\n\nAbout the two:\n\nAvi Piamenta is a well experienced and valued musician and flutist who has written many songs, some of which are popular and played to this day. He is known in Israel and abroad mainly from the band “Piamenta” (conducted by Barak’s father at the beginning of their careers). In the 70s he started playing music with his brother, a well known guitarist – Yossi Piamenta, of blessed memory. They started off their career playing with Zvika Pik, the world saxophone player Stan Getz, in military bands, and later when repented, played in huge performances in America with Avraham Fried, Matisyahu, Mordechai Ben David, Yishai Ribo, Ariel Zilber and more.\n\nBarak Grossberg is a fascinating combination of the sacred and the profane, repentant for about 10 years. Born in Tel Aviv into an unoccupied home where rock’n’roll was his second language. His father, Shaul Grossberg, founded the Israeli Rock Club in the 1970s with the best shows, at the beginning of many artists’ careers. He started playing music when he was 12, and at the age of 15 he performed on big stages at various events produced by his father, even then he met the flutist and singer Avi Piamenta.\n\nAfter the two moved, each separately, to the ultra-Orthodox world, they met by chance at the Lubavitcher Rebbe’s seminary, Building 770 Eastern Parkway in New York and from there continued on a common path that led to this very special single, a particularly original love song for the Creator."
