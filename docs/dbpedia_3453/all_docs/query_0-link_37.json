It seems worth passing on the info:\n\nCome join the mailing list for Yosi Piamenta, the Israeli born rocker. Concert info and band happenings!\n\n\"Yossi Piamenta and the Piamenta band jam with frenetic abandon, creating a psychedelic haze of classic rock, jazz, and Oriental Hebrew music. Critics have compared Piamenta's fret magic to the likes of Jimi Hendrix, and Carlos Santana, though Piamenta's style is truly his own.\"\n\n\"Spiritual music never sounded so good!\""
