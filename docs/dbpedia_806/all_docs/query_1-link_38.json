        "text": "Fans of 'Nashville' may not have recognized many of the seven songs played during last night's (Nov. 7) episode, titled 'Move It on Over.' Original songs dominated, with many providing more than just background music for the drama that developed during Episode 5 of the ABC hit.\n\nGunnar, Scarlett and Avery's performance of 'Loving You Is the Only Way to Fly' may be the scene fans are most buzzing about on Thursday, because the long-simmering feud between the two men finally boiled over, costing the duet an opportunity. Connie Britton's Rayna James was the featured voice on two occasions, including 'Buried Under,' which set the stage for next week.\n\nOnly two songs from non-'Nashville' characters were featured, including one by a country group that opened for Brantley Gilbert and Dierks Bentley in 2012, the Cadillac Black. Many tracks featured on the show are available on iTunes.\n\n'Nashville' Season 1, Episode 5 Song List:"
