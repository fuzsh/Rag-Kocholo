        "text": "Gather ‘round children and listen closely as we croon “The Ballad of Rayna James and Deacon Claybourne.” It’s a love song that spanned five seasons of the musical drama Nashville, and — like so many country tunes — ends in tragedy. On the Feb. 23 episode, Rayna departed this earthly plain, survived by her longtime lover (and relatively recent husband), Deacon, as well as their two daughters, Maddie and Daphne. She also left behind a just-completed 16-track album, co-written with Deacon, that told the story of their long, complicated romance. No need to wait for that record’s posthumous release, though. You can recreate their history on with this 16-episode playlist culled from the show’s archive on Hulu. Turn down the lights, crank up the volume, grab some tissues and give this greatest hits album a spin.\n\n“Pilot” (Season 1, Episode 1)\n\nNashville’s first-ever episode is still its best, promising a knowing peek behind the country music industry curtain that the series ultimately wasn’t able to deliver. It also sets in motion a storyline that the writers have since strongly encouraged everyone to forget about: Rayna’s rival Juliette pursuing, and eventually bedding, Deacon. Nashville’s central power couple is otherwise in a strangely subdued place in this introduction: their romance is ancient history, but they continue to sing together onstage, after which Rayna goes home to loser hubby, Teddy, and Deacon wallows in self-pity. It’s almost as if they decided to get divorced before they got married.\n\n“I’ve Been Down that Road Before” (Season 1, Episode 12)\n\nDeacon and Rayna are on tour together just like in the old days! Unlike the old days, though, he’s playing lead guitar for another singer–Juliette. On the other hand, he’s totally into the idea of some elevator nookie, which probably did happen a lot in the old days. And his skulking around has the added benefit of finally convincing Teddy to throw in the towel on his passionless marriage to Rayna, paving the way for a Claybourne/James match…four seasons later.\n\n“Take These Chains From My Heart” (Season 1, Episode 18)\n\nDeacon and Rayna are both in the midst of trying out one of several substitute lovers. He’s making time with earnest (and boring) veterinarian Stacey, while she’s macking on rugged (and boring) producer Liam. But they wind up falling into bed together anyway, starting a fling that ends with a literal crash.\n\n“I Fall to Pieces” (Season 2, Episode 1)\n\nDeacon demonstrates his loyalty to Rayna by going to prison for her, falsely claiming that he was driving their car when it swerved off the road. Flashbacks fill in the last time that alcohol got in the way of their happily ever after, and confirm that her eldest daughter Maddie should be calling Deacon “Daddy” rather than Teddy. Back in the present, Rayna’s hospital bed account of the accident exonerates her lover, but lowers the temperature of their relationship back to “ice cold.”\n\n“I’m Tired of Pretending” (Season 2, Episode 9)\n\nRayna sees Deacon in a new light when he starts spending some quality father/daughter time with Maddie by giving her private guitar lessons. (Free of charge, of course.) He comes off looking especially good when compared to Teddy, whose jealousy bubbles over into a near-brawl. Deacon’s already shown that he can be a caring lover — this episode shows he’s got the makings of a decent dad.\n\n“On the Other Hand” (Season 2, Episode 22)\n\nLucky Rayna gets to choose between two proposals. First, country powerhouse Luke Wheeler successfully requests her hand in marriage in a very public fashion. But then Deacon turns up on her doorstep with a ring of his own. His timing gets better later, we swear.\n\n“Two Sides to Every Story” (Season 3, Episode 9)\n\nConsider this the Christmas ballad: Rayna invites Deacon to be part of her and Luke’s one big happy family for a down home country TV special. But he’s got a sizeable chip on his shoulder thanks to some ill-advised comments Rayna made about their romantic history in a Rolling Stone interview. Her gift to him is to try and set him free, but he simply doesn’t wanna go.\n\n“I’m Not That Good at Goodbye” (Season 3, Episode 11)\n\nLike pretty much everyone anticipated, Luke and Rayna’s peppy love song ends up as a dirge as she ditches him right before the wedding. Luke takes his anger out on Deacon, but the guitarist has bigger concerns than a jilted groom. He’s got liver cancer, which puts a possible expiration date on any Deacon/Rayna love connection.\n\n“Time Changes Things” (Season 3, Episode 20)\n\nAfter three seasons, it’s “When Rayna Met Deacon” time! Flashbacks transport us to the early ‘90s and give us a peek at rising star Rayna checking out Deacon (while he checks her out) as he and his sister Beverly perform a set at the Bluebird. Back in the present, Rayna is trying to give an embittered Beverly reasons to save her brother’s life by donating her liver. Liver, schmiver. Give us more ‘90s Rayna!\n\n“The Slender Thread that Binds Us Here” (Season 4, Episode 4)\n\nDeacon works through his grief over Beverly’s passing, which doesn’t leave a lot of time for expressing affection for Rayna. But then, she’s distracted anyway with new client, Markus. While it may not make for the most romantic episode, this hour represents an important step on Deacon’s path back to physical and emotional health.\n\n“Can’t Get Used to Losing You” (Season 4, Episode 7)\n\nDeacon adds “bar owner” to his résumé, which revives the issue of his alcoholic past with Rayna. That’s precisely the wedge that’s driven them apart before, but this time around they’re both sober enough to be able to work through it without calling the whole thing off. That’s a clear sign of maturity right there.\n\n“We’ve Got Nothing Left But Love to Prove” (Season 4, Episode 10)\n\nFeel free to needle drop ahead to the last five minutes, when Deacon floats his latest proposal to Rayna and this time, she accepts. It’s a “Yes,” four years and 75 episodes in the making.\n\n“Forever and For Always” (Season 4, Episode 11)\n\nRayna and Deacon’s storybook wedding begins more like a Stephen King story, with the groom roughing up a paparazzi shutterbug Sean Penn-style, causing Maddie to freak out about her dad’s violent streak. A last minute relocation, plus Deacon’s pointed tardiness, adds another layer of tension to what’s meant to be a happy day. But good things come to those who wait, so rings are exchanged, knots are tied and lips are locked as this on-again, off-again couple finally arrives at the altar.\n\n“The Wayfaring Stranger” (Season 5, Episode 1)\n\nHe may have been a nervous groom, but Deacon proves himself a stellar husband in the Season 5 premiere, catching a last-minute flight out to California when Rayna develops a sudden fear of flying back to the East Coast. “‘Cause my girl’s in trouble,” is his version of Han Solo’s immortal “I know.”\n\n“Hurricane” (Season 5, Episode 7)\n\nRayna and Deacon sit down to start work on their relationship-encompassing record, and dredge up some old, less-than-romantic memories in the process. It’s an episode that encompasses the joys and challenges of maintaining a creative partnership, not to mention a loving marriage.\n\n“If Tomorrow Never Comes” (Season 5, Episode 9)\n\nIt’s the end of the road for Nashville’s biggest power couple, as Rayna succumbs to injuries sustained in a car accident. Going forward, Deacon is going to be a solo act, but you can bet that every song he writes will be dedicated to his lady love.\n\nSeasons 1-5 of Nashville can be streamed on Hulu."
