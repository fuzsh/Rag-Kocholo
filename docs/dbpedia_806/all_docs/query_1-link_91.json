        "text": "Ten Nashville, Tennessee based singles will embark on a journey to meet the love of their lives during this 23-episode season, where they'll marry a complete stranger, travel to their honeymoons and then move in together as husband and wife. After the 8-week social experiment concludes, each newlywed will have to come to terms with the hard truth of their marriage status and make a life-changing decision - continue to stay married and start a future together, or get a divorce and go their separate ways. This season, there will be even more romance and intense stakes, including a shocking twist where one bride's husband decides to make an indecent proposal to another man's wife."
