        "text": "The last week of October, on autumn school break, I brought my husband and two daughters, 9 and 13 years old, to Nashville. We had the most fabulous vacation, somewhat unexpectedly, and I thought I’d tell you how we ended up there, and how a TV show can impact lives, my life!\n\nI’ve always been a TV and movie buff, but I must admit, the number of hours spent in front of a TV or in a movie theater had seriously decreased the last couple of years. I lost a bit of interest in movies, and although TV was getting better and better (and more and more), since the TV and only laptop always seemed to be occupied by the kids, I found myself watching less and less.\n\nSo it was really by accident, in January 2013, I saw a TV panel discuss new shows coming the Swedes’ way. One in particular caught my interest, since it had Connie Britton in it, whom I loved from the fantastic Texas football drama Friday Night Lights. Hayden Panettiere, who was the most adorable, unbreakable cheerleader in Heroes, and Eric Close, the most handsome guy from Without a Trace, was also in it. That it was a drama, set in Nashville and told the story of the world of country music, seemed just like so much fun.\n\nI set the recording to the digital box for the first episode, but then forgot about it (or maybe the TV was occupied) and forgot to record the next episode. Then after a couple of weeks I noticed that TV3 would air the first five episodes in a row on Saturday afternoon. After episode two I was hooked. After episode four I was obsessed. The show was great in many ways, one of those was the fantastic music performances, but the reason for the obsession was a couple called Rayna and Deacon. If you have seen it, you know what I mean.\n\nThe next episode couldn’t air soon enough and I started searching the internet to find out more about the show. In the US it had premiered in October 2012, and they were already on episode 12, and I was watching YouTube clips, reading reviews and spoilers, as well as joining the Facebook fandom! In May when spending a long weekend at our internetless summerhouse, I was so desperate rewatching scenes from the latest episode, I quickly volunteered to go grocery shopping, so I could sit in the parking lot outside the store watching scenes on my phone over and over again. Yes.\n\nAfter weeks of trying to calm down after a crazy season finale, when home alone, I decided to try this thing called twitter. I created my account, followed the Nashville creator, the actors and other things related and then spent weeks feeling ridiculous with zero followers. Then boom, three Nashville fan accounts followed me back, and I dared to start! Twitter fandom is fabulous, just start writing a few tweets, comments and answers and things will come to you. Six months later I had twitter friends from Israel, Netherlands, UK, Argentina and of course the US, with whom I was discussing and doing serious fangirling, sharing our love of Nashville, but sometimes also other topics.\n\nSo why is this show so special? Of course it is not only Rayna and Deacon, although the chemistry between the actors, Connie Britton and Charles Esten, is unreal. (They are also super hot and in their late 40’s!!!) It’s the fantastic music, written by local songwriters, and always fitting the stories of the different characters so well. The characters – ranging from young diva Juliette (played by Panettiere), the accidental artist, Scarlett, and wannabe songwriter Gunnar, to big country music stars like Rayna and Luke – might seem stereotyped at first, but no, they rise above that becoming all so full-fledged, complex and relatable – annoying, adorable and flawed – all at the same time. It is just a very well-written show taking place in a truly authentic music environment.\n\nNo wonder I got inspired to go to Nashville, to see where all the scenes were filmed, and to experience the music and atmosphere of that town. I had somewhat hard a time convincing my family to go, or as my 13yo daughter told me. ”I’m not even that into music.” Well, maybe they wouldn’t enjoy it, so I kind of gave up on the idea, but then I saw a tweet from the Ryman Auditorium – who everyone who’s seen the show know is the Mother Church of Country music – that First Aid Kit, our favorite Swedish band, would play on October 29, which was the exact week of the school break! It was a sign! Tickets for that show, and tickets for the trip, was bought quicker than anyone could say ‘country music’! (First Aid Kit song Emmylou is featured in ep 1×12. Yep, after the elevator scene!)\n\nI was nervous for sure about bringing the family on an expensive vacation overseas, just because I happen to love a TV show, not knowing if they would enjoy it at all. But I needn’t have worried. Everyone loved it! We were walking along downtown Broadway, stopping at every boot shop and debating with our 9yo daughter if she should have boots with heels or not (she got one pair of each). We went to see an NHL hockey game (yes, this was a concession I made and the Predators lost unfortunately), visited Nashville Zoo (kids loved it, the clouded leopards became favorites), had breakfast at the famous Loveless Café (blueberry pancakes of course) and visited the Country Music Hall of Fame, where the kids got the task to find different instruments, the oldest, the weirdest etc. And yes, there was one weirder and more innovative than the other. Fantastic really! My appreciation for country musicians just exploded.\n\nWe did the the backstage tour at the Ryman Auditorium, took the ABC Nashville bus tour to see where different scenes took place including a visit to the famous Bluebird Café. We went on a day trip up in the mountains, visited the fantastic Dutch Maid Bakery & Café and nearby Foster Falls, and of course did our fair share of shopping. Music is everywhere and anytime in Nashville, at 11am a Saturday morning and late nights on weekdays. On top of some nice lunch and dinner music performances, we saw two marvellous shows, First Aid Kit at the Ryman, and then finishing off the week at the legendary Grand Ole Opry, listening to, among others, Vince Gill.\n\nIf you’re living in Sweden and have not watched Nashville I don’t blame you. It started out on Mondays 8pm on TV3 with very little advertising. Since nobody watched it, they thought better to move it to Saturday afternoons, not telling anyone of course, and then to Saturday mornings. You didn’t catch it then? No? Well finally, they put it on their streaming service and Nashville is now available on Viaplay, all 53 episodes. Season 3 is now on winter break, but will be back on US TV February 4. That hopefully means that Viaplay will have it available for streaming no more than one week later. So a little bit of time for y’all Swedish guys and gals to catch up on the first two and half seasons.\n\nNot all TV critics have understood how good Nashville is yet, they see it as soap opera, and a soap opera cannot be that good, can it? Well, it can, and one critic who does get it is TVdags.se editor-in-chief, Kjell Häglund, who is one of not so many people in Sweden having discovered Nashville. He also happens to appreciate it, a lot! When naming the best TV drama of 2014 he put Nashville on top, above True Detective. Just like me and many fans, he sees just how very well made this music drama is by creator Callie Khouri and her team."
