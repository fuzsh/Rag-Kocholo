The dazzling Joyce Yang performs Rachmaninoff’s fiendishly charming variations for piano and orchestra. Giancarlo also revisits Mahler’s Symphony No. 5, a celebration of the virtuosity found within the orchestra, with its triumphant fanfares, stormy drama, and heart-achingly despairing Adagio.\n\nProgram\n\nSergei Rachmaninoff: Rhapsody on a Theme of PaganiniGustav Mahler: Symphony No. 5\n\nNashville Symphony | Enrico Lopez-Yañez, conductor | The Lone Bellow\n\nA Nashville Symphony Debut Engagement!

It became a hit and the most sought-after property since Rocky. This is the original one-man show he wrote that made him an in-demand character actor and served as the basis of the acclaimed movie and Broadway musical. This powerful one-man stage play depicts Palminteri’s bruising childhood, which included witnessing a gangland killing when he was nine years old. Palminteri plays 18 characters and brings them all to life. In the past 35 years, Chazz has appeared in over 60 films.\n\nPresented without the Nashville Symphony\n\nNashville Symphony | Lidiya Yankovskaya, conductor | Simone Porter, violin\n\nReflecting her passion and advocacy for Slavic masterpieces, operatic gems, and contemporary music, Lidiya Yankovskaya’s Nashville debut covers all the bases and then some. “I love the incredible palate of orchestral colors in Missy Mazzoli’s music,” she says, complementing the opening work with jewels from the classic repertoire: Prokofiev’s provocative violin concerto with the incomparable Simone Porter, Wagner’s reverent “Liebestod,” and Dvořák’s rousing Seventh symphony.\n\nPeri and Luanne Widener Women Artist Fund Concert\n\nProgram\n\nMissy Mazzoli: Orpheus Undone\n\nSergei Prokofiev: Concerto No. 1 for Violin & OrchestraRichard Wagner: “Liebestod” from Tristan und IsoldeAntonín Dvořák: Symphony No. 7\n\nNashville Symphony | Giancarlo Guerrero, conductor | Gil Shaham, violin\n\n“The Nomad Concerto broods, floats, and glimmers in its opening movement, ultimately alighting on something poignant for both orchestra and violin,” wrote the Philadelphia Inquirer upon the Mason Bates premiere with violinist Gil Shaham, for whom it was written. Giancarlo, Shaham, and the Nashville Symphony record it live, for posterity. Noted historian Michael Steinberg called Stravinsky’s score to The Firebird “one of music’s great showpieces of orchestration—often astonishing and everywhere beautiful,” and a “remarkable tour-de-force\" of the symphonic repertoire.\n\nProgram\n\nGiuseppe Verdi: Overture to La forza del destino\n\nMason Bates: Nomad Concerto for Violin and Orchestra | Live RecordingIgor Stravinsky: The Firebird Complete version\n\nNashville Symphony | Enrico Lopez-Yañez, conductor | Tower of Power\n\nFor over 55 years, Tower of Power has delivered the best in funk and soul music.

The band has supported many national touring acts including The Avett Brothers, Don Henley, Darius Rucker and Willie Nelson.\n\nEllie is no longer a touring member of “The Neighbors,” and has found success in a solo career as a Christian singer/songwriter as a 3x Dove Award winner as well as a best selling author.\n\nDrew Holcomb still tours nationally with Drew Holcomb and The Neighbors, and their most recent album, Strangers No More, is their most critically acclaimed release yet, notching a #1 Americana single, “Find Your People.”\n\nDrew and Ellie Holcomb’s Neighborly Christmas is a special engagement event, allowing the Holcombs to collaborate once again.\n\nPresented without the Nashville Symphony.\n\nNashville Symphony | Giancarlo Guerrero, conductor | Nashville Symphony Chorus | Tucker Biddlecombe, chorus director | Emanuel Ax, piano\n\nIt’s always a delight when the charismatic Emanuel Ax, a frequent and favorite guest artist, makes an appearance. He returns to perform one of Mozart’s most beloved and enduring concertos before Giancarlo embarks on Ravel’s epic Daphnis et Chloé, a true symphonic showcase. Originally written as a ballet, Ravel’s impressionistic score, full of lush orchestrations and a full spectrum of colors—including a wordless chorus—is considered by many to be the composer’s crowning achievement.\n\nProgram\n\nWolfgang Amadeus Mozart: Overture to Cosí fan tutte\n\nWolfgang Amadeus Mozart: Concerto No. 20 in D minor for Piano and Orchestra, K. 466Maurice Ravel: Daphnis et Chloé\n\nNashville Symphony | Giancarlo Guerrero, conductor | Bang on a Can All-Stars\n\nOne of the hallmarks of Giancarlo’s tenure has been the relationships he has developed with composers, inviting them to Nashville to make definitive recordings of their work. Julia Wolfe is one such composer: she describes her Flower Power, inspired by the 1960s counterculture movement, as “about optimism, idealism, psychedelia, breaking with convention, and a little bit of love and peace.” Beethoven self-proclaimed his Seventh Symphony as one of his best works—we couldn’t agree more.\n\nProgram\n\nRichard Wagner: Overture to The Flying Dutchman\n\nJulia Wolfe: Flower Power | Live Recording\n\nLudwig van Beethoven: Symphony No. 7\n\nNashville Symphony | Nicholas Hersh, conductor | Nashville Symphony Chorus | Tucker Biddlecombe, chorus director | Gabriella Reyes, soprano | Jennifer Johnson Cano, mezzo soprano | Alek Shrader, tenor | David Leigh, bass\n\nConductor Nicholas Hersh’s inaugural Nashville Symphony series concert brings together a leading American composer and two classic works. Inspired by an entry in Beethoven’s journal, Carlos Simon composed Fate Now Conquers to evoke the unpredictability of fate through musical gestures. Ravel’s inspiration for his song cycle Shéhérazade came from the Sinbad episode from Arabian Nights, where the heroine/narrator spins out tale after tale to save her life. And Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony, one of the most frequently performed symphonies in the world, is considered by critics to be one of the supreme achievements in the history of music.\n\nProgram\n\nCarlos Simon: Fate Now Conquers\n\nMaurice Ravel: ShéhérazadeLudwig van Beethoven: Symphony No. 9 (“Choral”)\n\nNashville Symphony | Jason Seber, conductor\n\nWatch this iconic film, winner of ten Academy Awards®, including Best Picture.
