        "text": "The country music soap Nashville is about to ride off into the sunset with their sixth and final season. The cast and crew recently shot their final episode which is set to air on CMT on July 26 and the gang took to social media to commemorate the event with fond farewells, kind words, throwback photos, and pictures from the set.\n\nLennon Stella, who plays Maddie, posted a photo from her first day on set saying that working on the show has been “magic” and adding “No words could possibly express my gratitude.” Chris Carmack took to Instagram to post a video of the spot that once served as Gunnar and Will’s house. Sam Palladio posted a selfie of him and co-star Hayden Panettiere on set of the final day of taping saying, “Blessed beyond belief to have been surrounded a cast and crew that I can call family.” Show creator and executive producer Callie Khouri kept it short and sweet saying, “that’s a wrap.”\n\nNashville has been on quite a journey since it premiered on ABC in 2012. It was canceled suddenly in May 2016 and then moved to CMT for its final two seasons. Nashville follows country stars Juliette Barnes (Hayden Panettiere), Deacon Claybourne (Charles Esten) and the Highway 65 family as they strive to keep Rayna Jaymes’ dream alive and pursue their music while juggling relationships, family and the ever-changing industry. Jonathan Jackson, Clare Bowen, Sam Palladio, Kaitlin Doubleday, Rachel Bilson and Lennon Stella also star. Connie Britton played Jaymes for the series’ first four-plus seasons.\n\nThe final eight episodes will air on CMT starting on June 7. Read more of the farewell tweets and Instagram posts from the cast and crew below.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BhX3YFnFNWV/?taken-by=lennonstella"
