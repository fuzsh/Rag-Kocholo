        "text": "Boonville’s Clayton Philip will open\n\nWarner Music Nashville recording artist Walker County will headline the Lincoln Amphitheatre’s “Emerging Artist” event this Saturday, August 10.\n\nThis special event is partly being presented by MasterBrand Cabinets with local radio support provided by 100.9 FM WBDC.\n\n“This is our fourth season of hosting an emerging artist night,” said Marc Steczyk, Lincoln Amphitheatre’s director. “2021’s artist, Samantha Fish, just opened up for the Rolling Stones and last year’s artist, Southern Avenue, is currently on tour opening for Willie Nelson, Bob Dylan, and John Mellencamp on their Outlaw Music Festival tour. Historically, the talent of this annual event has been fantastic and their ongoing success is a testament to that. We fully expect great things from Walker County in the future and hope many come out to catch this up-and-coming band.”\n\nThe winner of a July contest to open for Walker County, Boonville native Clayton Philip, is set to kick the evening off at 6:30 p.m., and Walker County will take the stage at 7:30 p.m. All times are central.\n\nWalker County is led by sisters Ivy and Sophie from Sulphur Springs, Indiana. They have captured the hearts of fans and earned millions of streams with fan-favorite tracks such as “Bits & Pieces” and “Drag It Out.” The sister duo has appeared on CMT and opened for country music legends Willie Nelson, Martina McBride, Dwight Yoakam, and Old Dominion.\n\nGeneral admission tickets are $21.95 per and VIP tickets (early admission, premium seating, and a free drink voucher good for Pepsi products or beer/wine) are $26.95 per and are available at ~www.lincolnamphitheatre.com~ or at the ~direct ticketing page link~ or by calling the Lincoln Amphitheatre box office at 812-937-2329.\n\nThe Lincoln Amphitheatre’s 2024 performance series is presented by the Spencer County Community Foundation & the Perry County Community Foundation."
