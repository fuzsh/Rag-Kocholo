        "text": "Having recently watched all 76 episodes of NBC's five-season Friday Night Lights (\"Texas forever,\" indeed) without once developing a pang of interest in the heavily armoured, stop-start intricacies of American high school football, I hereby testify that you needn't dig country music to dig Nashville. All that's required is a soft spot for Dynasty-grade feminine rivalry and interlocking love triangles, not to mention endless, twang-accompanied establishing shots of tourist-brochure Tennessee.\n\nUnlike most chattered-about long-form US drama, the first season of ABC's Cuban-heeled re-boot of Rock Follies aired not on Sky or Fox or Netflix but More4, on yer actual Freeview. Indeed, the channel created a \"magic three hours\" for satellite-deniers on Thursday nights in spring, stacking Nashville between The Good Wife and Boss. It's not HBO or AMC: the sex is chaste, the language is safe, and, unlike Breaking Bad, you won't be expected to join any \"Aristotelian dots\" between a fly swatted in season three and an air-freshener bought in season five.\n\nAlso unlike Breaking Bad, it's all about the women. Its star is flame-haired supermum Connie Britton, who in Friday Night Lights fleshed what might have been a supporting role as the coach's wife into a starring one. Able to carry over her southern drawl, y'all, to \"Music City\" to play \"Queen of Country\" Rayna James, Britton shares top billing with former Heroes cheerleader Hayden Panettiere, who stars as Juliette Barnes, the Taylor Swiftian pretender to Rayna's throne. As Rayna's commercial crown slips, Juliette's MTV-friendly star rises, such that their magpie-eyed record company boss suggests they co-headline a tour for the ultimate in unit-shifting, career-enhancing osmosis. This sets them up as Crystle and Alexis with an age difference – and a tendency to burst into downhome song.\n\nNashville is a musical in the sense that is punctuated by numbers – specifically produced by T-Bone Burnett for the show by the likes of Elvis Costello, the Civil Wars' John Paul White and Trent Dabbs – all creditably belted out by Britton and Panettiere, who have definitely got the chops. Handily, viewing via the box set will relieve you of the task of frequently fast-forwarding through adverts for The Music of Nashville: Season 1 Volume 1.\n\nWhile the jazz and blues in HBO's Treme are intrinsic to a full understanding, it's what happens offstage that keeps all but the schmaltz-intolerant hooked on Nashville. The show is pure network soap – Brothers and Sisters turned up to 11. It's broad, narratively concertinaed, and clearly signposted. But so, in a sense, was creator Callie Khouri's 1991 landmark anthem to fem-powerment, Oscar-winner Thelma and Louise. Nashville is about sitting back and enjoying the fallout as Juliette sleeps with Rayna's guitarist and ex, while the married Rayna sleeps with a new producer, her husband sleeps with an ex, a guitarist's aspirant-musician niece breaks up with one co-writer to take up with another, and so on. And that's just in one episode.\n\nBy the end of 21 episodes, every possible romantic configuration has been road-tested – even, shock-horror, a gay lunge, at which point that other essential country element, tragedy, heaves into shot. And every episode is named after a tune by the doomed Hank Williams – the ominous finale title is I'll Never Get Out of this World Alive.\n\nI have tired of far more fashionable US dramas than this grand old opera, whose second season can't come too soon. Maybe we're all a little bit country after all."
