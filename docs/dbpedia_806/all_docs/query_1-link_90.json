        "text": "Fans have been waiting, and Duck Dynasty star Missy Robertson has finally offered an update on her daughter Mia's recent surgery.\n\nMia, who is the daughter of Missy and Jase Robertson, underwent her sixteenth cleft lip surgery last week. Thankfully, it went perfectly — in fact, Missy says it has been \"one of the best\" recoveries to date.\n\n“Mia’s recovery has been one of the best ones ever,\" she writes in an update on social media on Tuesday (Aug. 6).\n\n\"She is moved in for her Junior Year in college at @lipscombuniversity and will be ready for the first day when it comes,\" Missy further shares. \"Thank you so much for your continued prayers for her during this cleft journey.”\n\nThe caption comes along with a photo of her daughter, arms stretched wide and a big smile on her face.\n\nMany have followed Mia's cleft lip journey since the beginning, showering words of praise on the family in the comments sections of their posts, including this most recent.\n\n“What a great blessing,“ one fan writes. \"Mia you truly are a warrior in the physical sense and spiritually!! I know how excited you must be!! Have a terrific academic year.\"\n\nThe fact that Mia gets to start her junior year of college on time is something she doesn’t take for granted. She missed the beginning of sophomore year due to another surgery. Thankfully, her attitude was positive in the midst of deep disappointment.\n\nIt's not clear how many more surgeries she will need to undergo, if any.\n\nAdison Haager is the host for Taste of Country’s popular social media platforms. She brings the latest interviews with artists such as Jelly Roll, Ashley McBryde, Lainey Wilson and more, producing them to Taste of Country’s YouTube, TikTok, podcasts and website."
