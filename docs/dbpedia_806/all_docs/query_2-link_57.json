When journalist Cornelia Rowe unexpectedly returned to her hometown of Nashville, she began looking into the strange death of a former schoolmate named Leigh Terry. Those close to Leigh immediately raised questions about the circumstances surrounding her death, as she had become involved with a group of powerful local men known for their money, influence and rich history of scandals and corruption. Upon investigating, Cornelia quickly discovered a darker, more complicated side of Music City. With a vibrant setting and cast of eccentric characters, Once Upon a Time in Nashville is a story of a suicide and its shocking ramifications, as well as a story about the city of Nashville–how a rough-and-tumble small town on the Cumberland River has become a big, shiny city that is still heavily influenced by an old guard and Southern secrets. Beginning Thursday, May 23rd, you can listen to weekly episodes of Once Upon a Time in Nashville wherever you subscribe to podcasts.NEW EPISODES EVERY THURSDAY.",
