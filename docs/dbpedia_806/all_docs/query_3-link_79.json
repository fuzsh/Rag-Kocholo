        "text": "Country songs were once again a supporting character in the plot of this week's second episode of 'Nashville' on ABC. During 'I Can't Help It,' fans watch as many of the lead characters struggle with feelings they shouldn't be feeling. The Deacon and Rayna romance seemed ripe from the start of the pilot episode, but another character let a song pull her heart away from a man.\n\nRayna (Connie Britton) and Deacon's (Charles Esten) duet of 'No One Will Ever Love You' at the end of the show is the performance fans are talking about on Thursday morning. That song is not available at iTunes like so many of the other 12 songs from this episode of 'Nashville.' The first official single is 'Telescope' by Hayden Panettiere, and as it turns out, it's one she's not crazy about. Once again, the famed Blue Bird Cafe is the backdrop for much of the show's best musical action.\n\nAside from the live performances, songs from Elvis Costello, Ray Price and Danielle Peck were inserted between scenes. The songs used during the second episode of 'Nashville' don't comprise quite a modern greatest hits list like the premiere, but there was still plenty to enjoy between the drama.\n\n‘Nashville’ Season 1, Episode 2 'I Can't Help It' Song List:"
