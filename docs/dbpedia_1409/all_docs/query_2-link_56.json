McDermott scored a brilliant hundred during the course of the innings.  Tasmania lost an early wicket in the form of Caleb Jewell when the team score read 13 but McDermott along with Charlie Wakim then steadied the ship for the side as the two batters put 75 runs for the second wicket.  But Tasmania were then pushed onto the backfoot as WA scalped a couple of quick wickets to reduce the side to 88/3. McDermott was then joined by Macalister Wright in the middle and provided the resistance that the side required.  Both the players chipped in with a stand of 136 runs that certainly brought the team back on track. While Wright was eventually undone for 55, McDermott went on to score a ton. Before getting out for 133.  But his dismissal didn’t really have much impact as Tim David and Bradley Hope made sure that there were no more fall of wickets and the two batsmen took the team over the line.  Earlier, in the day, WA rode on fifties from Whiteman and Cartwright to put 294/9 in 50 overs on the board.",
