        "text": "MAY 11, 1912. CRICKET : A WEEKLY RECORD OF THE GAME. 129 Overseas Cricket. Our South African exchanges grow dull. Cricket is over for the season in the sub-continent. On the other hand it is waking to new life across the Atlantic, and the Australian and N.Z. papers are still full of interest. Wil­ liam Carlton, the Melbourne pro. who is doing such good work in Christchurch, N.Z., has scored four centuries for his club this seasonâ the last two on successive Saturdays. An effort is being made by the mid-week associa­ tions of New Zealandâ Invercargill, Dunedin, Timaru, Christchurch, Palmerston North, Napier, Wanganui, and Auckland have all been asked to co-operateâ to get a Melbourne Club team to visit the Dominion next season. But if the notion is that the team from Australia should play against sides selected from these associations, and not against provincial teams, one fails to see how much profit, in any sense, will accrue from this visit. L. McMahon, of Gisborne, has had a misfortune. On March 9th he got o u t ! This brought down his average at one fell swoop from 652âno decimal points, Mr. Printer, pleaseâ to 349. He had some consolation in taking 7 wickets for 49, which, with his score of 46, did not make a bad afternoonâs work. W. Gibson has now made 1486 in 18 completed innings, which the Press Associationâs man makes an average of 78'21. I prefer 82'55, but am not bigoted. It should probably be 19 innings. The first match of the season in British Columbia was played as early as April 2nd, when a United Service X I. met Mr. C. C. Tunnardâs side. Lieut. Morrell, playing his last game in the colony, ran up 64 not out for the naval and military side. The scratch team included men from the Victoria and Albion clubs, and others from as far afield as Oak Bay, Kelowna, and even Edmonton. C. A. L. Payne, the old Carthusian, Middlesex man, and Dark Blue, was the best all-round player of the Van­ couver C.C., British Columbia, in 1911. He scored 437 runs with an average of 33â61, took 39 wickets at 13'33 each, and made 14 catches. P. A. Barrs (is not this the Derbyshire amateur of a few years ago), L. F. Murphy, F. W. Sterling, and F- J- Peers also averaged over 30, and Barrs took 19 wickets at under 12 each. Peers, Barrs, and J. Crane scored centuries for Vancouver. Payne is the secretary of the club. Philadelphia has hopes of entertaining either the Australian, South African, or a M.C.C. team in Septemberâ most probably the last. In any case the Australians, having fixed up additional matches in Scotland, are almost out of the question. An attempt is being made (says the American Cricketer) to arrange a triangular tournament in Bermuda for February or March next, the probable contestants being Bermuda, the Gentlemen of Philadelphia, and the Toronto Zingari. Stuart R. Saunders, of Belleville, Ont., and John H. Mason, of Philadelphia, have the matter in hand for their respective localities, and Bermudan support is certain. The Belmont C. C. of Philadelphia, with which Barton King, E . M. Cregar, A. M. Wood, and the Graham brothers are all associated, looked in danger of going under altogether a short time back ; but later news is distinctly more hopeful. The Rosedale C.C., of Toronto, will visit the Quaker City in July, playing two-day matches v. Philadelphia, Germantown, Merion, Frankford and Moorestown combined, and All Philadelphia. In June Toronto University are expected, to play Philadelphia, Merion, and Germantown. Under its new Editor, Mr. A . J. Henry, the American Cricketer is very bright and interesting. One wonders that more people in the United Kingdom donât get it. There is no difficulty. C r ic k e t is ready and willing to fix up subscriptions for its transatlantic brotherâ its older brother, by the way, for the A .C . was established in 1878. The West Indies want another English team early next year, but to save expense suggest that it should be purely amateur. Remembering the difficulty Mr. A. F. Somerset had in 1911, one fancies that this is scarcely possible, though of course there were complications caused by the mail contract trouble then. The Australian Team played a match with All Ceylon at Colombo on April 11. The full score will be found on another page. Some of the colonials preferred sightseeing ; but ten of them turned out, and Dick Arnst, the sculler, completed the side. Bardsley played a nice innings of 52, and MacLaren took 5 wickets for 28. Frank Crawford was the only one of the earlier Ceylon batsmen to do any­ thing ; but after Gregory had kindly taken off the Queens­ land express Siedle and DeRozayro, hitting finely, added 84 for the ninth wicket. The game, of course, was not taken very seriously, and, as the analysis of the Ceylon innings was defective, only the bare score is given. No full score of the match played by the team against Western Australia has yet reached us. The East Launceston team, for which E. A. Windsor plays, won the Northern Tasmanian Associationâs pennant for the season. Colin Newton, the Tasmanian schoolboy referred to last week, scored 85 on March 23 for East Hobart v. North Hobart. Another schoolboy, J. Barnett, also made 85, and the two added 146 together for the second wicket. It is rumoured that J. L. Hudson, one of Tasmaniaâs best bats, will give up serious cricket at the end of this seasonâa pity, if true ! The First=CIass Season in Australia. Fourteen first-class matches were played by the English Team. For results of these see page 63. SHEFFIELD SHIELD MATCHES. November 3, 4, 6 and 7.â S o u th A u s tr a lia v .
