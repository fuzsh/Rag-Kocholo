        "text": "Nov. 28, 1907. CRICKET : A WEEKLY RECORD OF THE GAME. 455 his state may he set out chronologically, as follows :â 88*, v. Vietoria, Launceston, 1892-3. 20 and 55, and 5 wickets for 94, first innings, v. Victoria, Melbourne, 1893-4. 116 and 112*, v. Victoria, Hobart, 1894-5. 12 wickets for 63, v. Victoria, Melbourne, 1895-6. 43, and 13 wickets for 139, Southern Tasmania v. Queensland, 1896-7. 12 wickets for 161, v. Victoria, Melbourne, 1897-8. 92 and 30, and 12 wickets for 129, v. Victoria. Hobart, 1898-9. 64, and 9 wickets for 197, Southern Tasmania v. New Zealand, Hobart, 1898-9. 5 wickets for 144 (in an innings of 448), v. N.S.W., Hobart, 1S99-1900. First innings of 81, and 7 wickets for 229, v. Victoria, Melbourne, 1S99-1900. 104, second innings, and 9 wickets for 137, v. Victoria, Launceston, 1900-1. 11 wickets for 98, v. N.S.W., Hobart, 1904-5. 61 and 26, and 13 wickets for 185, v. Victoria, ! Hobart, 1906-7. This last entry seems to show that his powers are not seriously impaired by the advance of time. When he was over here his strokes were almost all in front of the wicket, and his fast bowling looked rather plain, but he has developed both as bat and bowler since then. People in the north of the island-state are inclined to look upon E. A. Windsor as at least his equal. It is seventeen years ago since Windsor first appeared for Tasmania. Some of his best performances are as follows: 19 and 40, and 6 wickets for 160, v. Victoria, Laun­ ceston, 1892-3. 5 wickets for 72, first innings, v. Victoria, Hobart, 1894-5. 45, and 6 wickets for 36, second innings, v. Victoria, Melbourne, 1895-6. 90 and 83*, v. Victoria, Launceston, 1896-7. 43 and 34. v. N.S.W., Sydney, 1898-9. 27 and 69, v. Victoria, Hobart, 1898-9. 181 and 22, and 4 wickets for 83, Northern Tas­ mania v. New Zealand, Launceston, 1898-9. 89 first innings, 5 wickets for 60, second innings, v. N.S.W., Hobart, 1899-1900. 62 and 24, and 8 wickets for 1S9, v. Victoria, Mel­ bourne, 1899-1900. 76, first innings, and 6 wickets for 160, v. Victoria, Hobart, 1903-4. J. H. Savigny appeared as far back as 1888-9. It was not until ten years later, in 1898-9, that he ever got past 40 in an inter­ colonial match, however. In that season he ran up 60 v. Victoria at Hobart. In the succeeding one he played an innings of 77 v. N.S.W. at Hobart, and made 44 and 28 v. Victoria at Melbourne. In 1900-1 he scored 63 v. Victoria at Launceston. Strangely enough, he has not played in an inter-state match since then (the Northern and Southern Associations of Tasmania are not always on the best of terms, and while Savigny is a northerner, the southern people generally manage the big matches, and those facts may have something to do with his standiug out), but at Launceston against the M.C.C. team in 1903-4 he played the innings of his life, a splendid 164 not out; and he has scored very heavily in club cricket during the last few seasons. Reginald Hawsonâs first appearance in a match of importance was in 1898-9, when he made his debut against Victoria with a score of 40, and a little later scored 76 for Southern Tasmania v. New Zealand. Since then he has m-tde 56 (Launceston, 1900-1), 74 and 35 (Melbourne, 190*2-3), 79 (Hobart, 1903-4), and 45 and 90* (Hobart, 1906-7) against Victoria, and has been a very big scorer in smaller cricket. Given a more extended sphere, he would probably force his way to the forefront. On the whole, he may be regarded as the best batsman in Tasmania to-day. A few words will suffice as to the rest, though some of them are men who might have done well with better chance?. N. DodJs is a useful wicket-keeper and a free bat. He scored 36 v. Victoria at Hobart in 1898-9, helping \"Ward (97 not out) to add over a hundred for the last wicket, 30 and 29 at Launceston in 1900-1, 48 v. the M.C.C. team at Launceston in 1903-4, and 43 v. Victoria at Hobart last season. D. Paton is a player of some all-round ability, whose best performance thus far is 58 for once out, and nine wickets for 112 v. Victoria at Melbourne in 1892-3. O. Douglas, a stonewall bat, scored 59 v. the M.C.C. team at Launceston in 1903-4, helping Savigny to send up 202 before a wicket fell. He has also played two or three useful, steady innings in the matches with Victo:ia. At Hobart in 1903-4 F. Chancellor took eight wickets for 142 v. Victoria. At Mel­ bourne in the following season he hit up an innings of 92. On this form he ought to be of great use in the future. Harold Hale, the Cantab of twenty years or so ago, still plays for the state, and L. A. Cuff, at one time a crack Near Zealand bats­ man, is sometimes included in the team, but neither of these has done anything notable for Tasmania. Here, for what they are worth, are the averages of the leading Tasmanian players who may possibly represent the island-state in one match or the other against the M.C.C. team:â Batsman. Inns. N.O>.

Claxton, Pellew, Jennings, Wright and Oâ Connor, of South Australia; Ransford, Mackay, McAlister and Carroll, of Victoria; Career, Diamond, Garnsey, MacCartney, the Waddys and Charles Gregory, of New Wales; Hartigan of Queensland; Selk and Chrisiain of Western Australia; Eady, Windsor and Hawson of Tasmania ; any of these, each at his best, might be worth a place. But there will be few places to fill if Darling, Hill, Gehrs, Armstrong, Saunders, Noble, Trumper, Duff, Hopkins and Cotter are all in form and available. Of these and other notabilities of English tours no detailed accounts have been given, since their deeds are pretty well known over here. My aim has been to offer information as to the less well-known players, who have never been the lions of an English tour. T he E.vd.
