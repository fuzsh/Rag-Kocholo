        "text": "A four-wicket haul from quick Darcie Brown has earned Australia a T20 World Cup warm-up win. (Dan Himbrechts/AAP PHOTOS)\n\nAustralia have won their first women's Twenty20 World Cup warm-up match, beating India by 43 runs.\n\nSubscribe now for unlimited access .\n\nor signup to continue reading\n\nAll articles from our website & app\n\nThe digital version of Today's Paper\n\nBreaking news alerts direct to your inbox\n\nInteractive Crosswords, Sudoku and Trivia\n\nAll articles from the other in your area\n\nPace bowler Darcie Brown took 4-17 in three overs as the bowlers made up for a disappointing batting display, dismissing India for 86 with five overs to spare.\n\nThe South Australian took three wickets in her first two overs to leave India reeling at 4-22 as they chased Australia's 8-129 in Cape Town.\n\nAsh Gardner (2-16), Kim Garth (1-12), Ellyse Perry (1-22) and Jess Jonassen (1-2) were also in the wickets while Annabel Sutherland bowled two overs for five runs and Meg Lanning effected a run-out\n\nIndia, who were variously also 3-12, 6-44 and 9-61, were never in the hunt with only Deepti Sharma (19no) and Harleen Deol (12) making double figures.\n\nSkipper Harmanpreet Kaur chose not to bat.\n\nAustralia's innings was indebted to a late flurry from No.9 Georgia Wareham, who top-scored with an unbeaten 32 off 17 balls, and No.10 Jonassen (22no off 14).\n\nTheir unbroken ninth-wicket partnership of 50 off the last 26 balls gave the bowlers enough to defend.\n\nWith each side using 15-player squads, with 11 players allowed to bat and 11 to field, Monday's outing was not an official match, but it was a useful exercise in gaining experience of the conditions in South Africa, and examining form.\n\nThat was a test Australia largely failed with the bat.\n\nHaving elected to have first dig, Australia made a disastrous start, reeling at 3-10 off four overs. They also suffered a mid-innings collapse losing 5-25.\n\nIn the second over Lanning was caught behind for a third-ball duck, part of a 14-ball spell without a run off the bat.\n\nTwo overs later Tahlia McGrath and Perry were sent back to the sheds in the space of three balls.\n\nMcGrath was caught and bowled for a seven-ball two, then Perry run out for one as Mooney attempted a single.\n\nMooney (28) and Gardner (22) rebuilt the innings while also picking up the pace but in the tenth over their 44-run, 34-ball partnership ended when Gardner was caught.\n\nThat prompted another clatter of wickets with Mooney going in the next over followed by Grace Harris (four), Sutherland (four) and Heather Graham (eight) as Australia slid to 8-79 before the late recovery.\n\nBatters dominated a far more high-scoring warm-up in Stellenbosch with England and South Africa scoring 476 runs between them in a match of 24 sixes.\n\nIn the group stage Australia face New Zealand, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and South Africa.\n\nAustralian Associated Press\n\nDAILY\n\nYour morning news\n\nToday's top stories curated by our news team.
