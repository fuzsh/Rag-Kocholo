        "text": "Is this one of those MCG wickets that offers two sessions of assistance and then flattens out like crazy? There was a test a couple of years back that did the same. Steketee should not be the second top run scorer.\n\nI'm really perplexed at Tasmania's declaration. There are no bonus points after the first innings so all that declaring does is give SA a shot at winning. There is no advantage at all possible for Tasmania. And Doolan didn't get a shot at the double ton.\n\nI'd say Daniel Hughes has done enough this Shield round to get the nod as test opener.\n\nMight as well hey if Bancroft and Harris are the front runners.\n\nI don't know if you were joking, but I actually totally agree. Joe Burns isn't going to happen, Usman won't happen, Marsh better not happen. Let Daniel Hughes happen.\n\nSA probably said they'd set them a total. Given NSW is dicking WA, Tassie probably think they can leapfrog into 2nd if they chase it down. If they don't chase it, then bat out a draw and they're still within easy reach of second.\n\nNot how I'd approach it, but they'll have some sort of plan behind it no doubt.\n\nMight as well hey if Bancroft and Harris are the front runners.\n\nI don't know if you were joking, but I actually totally agree. Joe Burns isn't going to happen, Usman won't happen, Marsh better not happen. Let Daniel Hughes happen.\n\nPrefer your call of Solway. Would be epic.\n\nDo it. At this point given Joe Burns has once again failed to produce runs when he needs it, its basically like having monkeys throwing rancid **** at a plaster wall cheering to see which pile of feces sticks to the wall for the longest.\n\nSolway doesn't know the taste of mediocrity yet, he's powerful. Let him taste glory.\n\nI'm really perplexed at Tasmania's declaration. There are no bonus points after the first innings so all that declaring does is give SA a shot at winning. There is no advantage at all possible for Tasmania. And Doolan didn't get a shot at the double ton.\n\nSurely they are thinking SACA will declare and give Tassie a 300 run chase off 70 or so. SA really need the win."
