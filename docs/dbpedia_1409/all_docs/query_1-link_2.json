        "text": "Skipper's unbeaten 84 guides Tasmania to a four-wicket win over Queensland after an extraordinary Clayton century gave the hosts hope\n\nAAP\n\n05-Feb-2024\n\nTasmania 219 & 228 for 6 (Silk 84*, Sandhu 2-47) beat Queensland 282 and 160 (Clayton 102, Bell 6-39) by four wickets\n\nJordan Silk has struck a classy unbeaten 84 to lead Tasmania to a four-wicket Sheffield Shield victory over Queensland inside three days at the Gabba.\n\nChasing 224 for victory after Jack Clayton made an extraordinary 102 out of Queensland's total of 160 in the second innings, Tasmania slumped to 13 for 2 and 99 for 4 on Monday, before Silk held the innings together with a match-winning captain's knock.\n\nSilk was on track for his 12th first-class century, only for teammate Mitchell Owen (29 not out off 15 balls) to strike some lusty blows at the death to secure victory for Tasmania just before stumps on day three. The win keeps Tasmania on top of the Shield table, while Queensland are last with only one win and two draws from seven matches.\n\nSilk struck 13 fours in his unbeaten knock, but he paid special tribute to Tasmanian paceman Gabe Bell, who claimed player-of-the-match honours after returning figures of 4 for 40 and 6 for 39.\n\n\"He's going fantastic, career-best figures and a 10-wicket haul,'' Silk said. \"We don't have that sort of [gettable] chase without his effort.\n\n\"I'm really rapt with how everyone approached it. It was a good collective effort.\n\n\"It's not often we come here [to Brisbane] and get the points.\"\n\nQueensland captain Jimmy Peirson was among the Bulls to struggle with sickness in the intense Brisbane heat. Clayton was physically ill during his epic 181-ball knock. Ben McDermott was the only other batter to reach double figures having fallen for 16 yesterday.\n\n\"I'm feeling better today, but I was on my deathbed yesterday to be honest,\" Peirson said.\n\n\"It's not fun, gastro. Unfortunately, we couldn't get the win today, but [if we can get] three wins in our last three games, we'll give ourselves a chance.\"\n\nTasmanian opener Caleb Jewell was the first wicket to fall in Tasmania's chase when his wild slash resulted in an edge through to the keeper. The Tigers were in early trouble at 2 for 13 when Tim Ward's attempted hook off a rising Mark Steketee delivery gave Peirson his second catch.\n\nCharlie Wakim (36) and Silk helped steady the ship with a 60-run stand. But when Gurinder Sandhu trapped Wakim lbw before finding the edge of Jake Doran's bat 10 overs later, Tasmania were looking wobbly at four down and still needing 125 more runs to win.\n\nSilk and Beau Webster (28 off 41 balls) led the counter-attack as Tasmania got their run chase back on track. Webster struck three fours and a six, but his bid to keep the runs flowing came undone when he inside-edged Liam Guthrie onto his stumps.\n\nBradley Hope added some handy runs, before Owen struck three fours and a six to shut the door completely on Queensland."
