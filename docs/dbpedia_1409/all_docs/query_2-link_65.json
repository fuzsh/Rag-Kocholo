        "text": "Swansong for Jones and Hitchcock\n\nAfter years of service at the club seam bowlers Paul Hitchcock and Phillip Jones, will play their last game for the club and probably the most important games of their careers for the Colts in the Cup Final. With the Colts likely promotion from Div 3 in FC, the club is starting to change its focus from One Day specialist to a more FC focused side. This focus means that the services of Hitchcock and Jones are no longer needed at the club and are likely to be put on the transfer market at the end of the season.\n\nGoing into the season Paul Hitchcock was 9th on the all time wicket tackers list in WCC with 83 wickets. Hitchcock was looking to finish the season with 100 career wickets, but after only taking 11 wickets this season, may only have a couple more games to take the other 6 wickets to reach 100, before he leaves the club.\n\nPhillip Jones has been a salwart to the club for the last couple seasons, leading pace attack in OD and even FC prior to this season. Know at the club for his never say die attitude he will be surely missed. Young Colts fast bowler Upul Gordon has this to say, \"Phillip has been a great mentor for me this season, even though he was struggling form and I was pushing for his OD spot, he was always willing to give us young guys some help.\"\n\nThe side for the cup final included:\n\nKenny Andrews, Ashraf Ali (vc), Andrew Tweedie, Pradeep Chawla (wk), Farhan Abbasi, Shikhar Dhawan, Salman Butt, Lennox Cush (c), Jim Troughton, Paul Hitchcock, Phillip Jones. 12th man : Andrew Symonds\n\nFirst of all I’ll like to congratulate Tasmania for making the final and the excellent performances your boys put in during the final. You guys never gave up and kept pushing for that extra wicket or extra run to make us work even harder for the win. We have some pretty close games in FC this season and Alex you seem to always get the best out of your boys. Your easily one best manager in WCC and it was an honour to come up against you in my first ever final in WCC history.\n\nWe to my boys, what can I say it’s been an up and down season in ODs, with some massive wins and tough losses. There is no doubt that we haven’t played to our potential, but none of that matters now. We got the title and no can take that away from us.\n\nNot sure if Age still read this section of the forum, but I think a lot of the credit for this tile, the club first since Season 2. You put together one of best One Day side you could ever think. It’s made my job so much having such a talent group of players to work with. You took this side a long way and I merely just put on some finishing touches, but there is still a long way to go.\n\nIt’s been a tough season for my inexperience middle and it was a massive gamble to bring all three to the club (Dhawan, Chawla and Abbasi). They may not have performed as well I like, but their performances in the cup have been amazing. In final Dhawan and Chawla innings were amazing, showing maturity belong their years. But it was all started by Ashraf Ali with his classy 46, the club in great hands for future and I’m really looking forward to him taking the captaincy for next season.\n\nAli smacks another four\n\nBut the real credit has to do to our two bowling all rounders James Troughton and Paul Hitchcock. Their lower order batting was just amazing; some of those hits were just scary. Like all bowlers for the Colts this season has been tough, but like quality bowlers they stepped up when need to back batting heroic. Hitchcock was just amazing swing it all over the place to get his first 5-fer for the season and it couldn’t have come at a better time. Troughton has been the pick of our bowlers all season and once took some vital scapes to finish with 3/59.\n\nTrougton unleaches a massive six\n\nHopefully this is just stepping stone, to bigger and better things. Well enjoy this victory with a few schooners of Ceylon Bitter when we get back home. But with the Four Day Division 3, within our sights must of the celebration will be at the end of the year. And to Queensland get ready for next season as we’ll be gunning for that Division One Title.\n\nColts' Team with the Cup\n\nColts Captain Lennox Cush receiving the winners cheaque"
