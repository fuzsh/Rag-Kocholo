        "text": "Despite losing the toss and being sent to the field first, the Tigers relished the opportunity. Scorpions openers Bridget Patterson (34 off 71) and Tahlia McGrath (20 off 33) started well, if not conservatively. Samantha Bates was the first to get a breakthrough, when McGrath was caught behind by keeper, Emily Smith. From here, the Tigers were on somewhat of a roll.\n\nScorpions debutant, Josie Dooley, was the next to go for just two runs, and it was this wicket that instigated a series of LBW dismissals for Scorpions debutants. Nicola Carey trapped Dooley LBW, before captain, Sasha Moloney, claimed the wickets of former Tiger, Courtney Webb, for 20, and Jemma Barsby, for three.\n\nIn the end, the Tigers dismissed the Scorpions for 174 after 47.3 overs, setting themselves an achievable target of 175 to win. Moloney (3-23 off eight overs) and Carey (3-26 off nine), whilst Heather Graham also chimed in with two wickers to her name; her first in Tigers’ green.\n\nIt was a slow start to the Tigers’ innings with the bat as well. Rachel Priest’s wicket was the first to fall in the seventh over, which saw her side sit at just 1-12. Moloney followed three overs later, unable to get a start making just two runs despite facing 25 deliveries.\n\nGraham and Carey settled things in the middle however, putting on 45 runs for the partnership. Carey was unfortunately run out by Barsby for 20, but Graham was joined in the middle by another second-gamer for the Tigers in Naomi Stalenberg, and the two picked up where Graham and Carey had left off. Another 42-run partnership ensued until Scorpions’ captain in Megan Schutt claimed the scalp of Graham for 31.\n\nStalenberg was then joined at the crease by Corinne Hall, and the two built another handy 43-run partnership, before Stalenberg was dismissed heartbreakingly short of a maiden half century for the Tigers, on 47. Hall continued in fine form, going on to make an unbeaten 31 runs off 35 balls, and was joined for a brief cameo by Emma Thompson, who made a run-a-ball 13; the only player to make multiple runs at a strike rate of 100+.\n\nIn the end the Tigers reached the winning total in 45.5 overs, with Hall and Emily Smith at the crease.\n\nStalenberg was named Player of the Match for her knock of 47 runs off 66 balls, in an innings that included five boundaries.\n\nThe Tigers now sit clear atop the WNCL standings, having won two games from as many matches.\n\nThe team will return to Hobart tomorrow with the next lot of WNCL matches due to take place in two weeks’ time."
