        "text": "Kilvidi Seshachari in 1906 (Image: Cricket, 21 June 1906)\n\nAlthough the most obscure old cricketers from England and Australia have received extensive coverage from historians, players from other countries have not been so fortunate. This is particularly true for cricketers from the Caribbean and India who played before the First World War, many of whom have been forgotten. A prime example is Kilvidi Seshachari, the wicket-keeper for the first representative Indian team that toured England during the 1911 season. Seshachari was unquestionably the best wicket-keeper in India at the time and was later judged to be one of the finest to visit England from overseas before the First World War. However, almost nothing is known about him today, even though he was relatively well-known in England during his career. His playing record is statistically unremarkable, reflecting the difficulty of assessing wicket-keepers except by seeing them firsthand. Despite this, at least one odd myth built up about him in later years, very possibly driven by the stereotypical view at the time that only Indian cricketers who had been “taught” by the English could ever have been successful.\n\nFirst we need some context because Indian cricket in the late nineteenth century was far from straightforward. In Seshachari’s youth, sport in India was dominated by white Europeans, part of the colonial elite and cricket was sharply demarcated. Initially, Indian cricketers had been dismissed as inferior by the ruling British, who had formed their own, racially exclusive cricket clubs. But the Parsee community had been playing cricket — very successfully — since the 1840s; the first successful Indian teams comprised Parsees and two such teams toured England in the 1880s. The first Hindu teams emerged in the 1860s and the first Muslim teams in the 1880s. The tendency of the British to keep their own clubs exclusive was to some extent mirrored and therefore Indian cricket remained segregated along religious as well as racial lines. For example, when Lord Harris was the governor of Bombay in the early 1890s, he allocated separate plots of land for the local Parsee, Hindu and Muslim clubs. And other cities followed this model in later years, leading to a series of tournaments across India featuring teams styled “Europeans”, “Parsees”, “Hindus” and “Muslims”. It was far from a smooth or harmonious separation but that is a story for another time.\n\nThis was the world into which Kilvidi Seshachari (the English press sometimes recorded his name as Sesha Chari) emerged when he was born in Madras (known today as Chennai) on 2 January 1875. Nothing is known of his early life or upbringing; even if he later became a subject of interest to newspapers, they never delved too deeply into his youth. Possibly he learned the game at school. But to understand this, a little context is needed. Seshachari was Hindu; a profile in Cricket in 1906 described him as “a Brahmin by birth”. Ramachandra Guha, in A Corner of a Foreign Field, his 2003 history of Indian cricket, says that Seshachari was “a Tamil Iyengar … that most exclusive and arrogant of Brahmin sub-castes.” Prashant Kidambi — in Cricket Country, his 2018 study of the 1911 Indian tour of England — notes “the alacrity with which Brahmins had taken to Western education in colonial India. In the light of their numerical preponderance in schools and colleges, one would expect to find Brahmins well represented in an Indian cricket team.” But we know nothing of Seshachari’s education. Later writers have picked up a suggestion (which has even appeared in a Wisden anthology) that he was educated in England at Dulwich College. This was not the case: neither Dulwich nor its Preparatory School nor the associated Alleyn’s School have any record of Seshachari ever having attended there, and the explanation lies later in Seshachari’s story.\n\nA little more is known about Seshachari as he rose to prominence. An article in the Madras Weekly Mail in 1902 stated: “Seshachari began his cricket career when quite a lad. An habitual visitor to the [Madras Cricket Club] ground at Chepauk, the venue of many an exciting contest, he must have been struck by the charm of European [i.e. English] wicket-keeping which he has been emulating by only too readily giving his shoulders to the wheel, carefully and strenuously studying the art, of which he is a master today. Ere long, Seshachari found himself a member of the Madras Native United Club [probably the Madras United Cricket Club], which institution by the way, is the first of its kind in Southern India.” Already there was the suggestion that any brilliance from Seshachari arose from his association with English cricket; despite the success of Ranjitsinhji in England from the mid-1890s, there remained a stubborn refusal among the British to accept that an Indian could excel purely through his own skill.\n\nK. Seshachari in 1911 (Image: Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News, 3 June 1911)\n\nThe 1906 profile in Cricket expanded slightly on Seshachari’s background. According to the writer, by the time he was a teenager Seshacahri loved keeping wicket and quickly distinguished himself in that role. After excelling in local club matches, he was elected to the “Premier Hindu Club”, based in southern India; perhaps this was the Madras club mentioned in the Madras Weekly Mail. Playing a higher standard of cricket, Seshachari continued to improve and appeared regularly for the Hindu Club at Madras. Part of his practice regime, according to Cricket, included having “balls thrown indiscriminately at him, and it was this method that gave him the power and quickness for which he is so remarkable.”\n\nSeshachari’s debut in important cricket came in January 1894 and he gradually established himself against the leading clubs in the area. He also produced some good batting performances. This led to his selection for “Combined Native” teams, one of which defeated a European team in Madras; his wicket-keeping was a vital factor, as it would prove throughout his career. As a result, his reputation grew across India until he was recognised as the best wicket-keeper in the country. A story printed in Cricket in 1902 stated that when he lived in Bombay, Seshachari was “a constant guest at the Ordnance Cricket Club”. When in one match, the Ordnance club faced strong opposition in the form of the team of an army regiment, their wicket-keeper was injured and could not continue. Seshachari was asked to substitute, and the opposition — who were unfamiliar with his abilities — agreed. He made six dismissals, “to their chagrin and discomfiture”.\n\nIn 1900, he moved to Ootacamund in southern India where he began to play alongside “European” cricketers, including the England Test batter C. T. Studd, in mixed teams. Exposure to a higher standard of cricket improved his batting considerably, but his wicket-keeping impressed immediately. According to the Madras Weekly Mail: “In his first venture at Ooty in 1900 during the Liardet League Competition, playing for the Army Headquarters against the Nilgiri Volunteers, he scored 70 not out, which was the highest individual score. This performance was, however, eclipsed when Seshachari took charge of the gauntlets, and for exceptional work behind the sticks he received considerable kudos. It was in fact this match that secured him the confidence of his European confreres who never failed to appreciate his services whenever the opportunity presented itself.” It would be interesting to know what stories might have been concealed behind the mild statement “secured him the confidence of his European confreres”.\n\nCricket noted that, during this period, “his batting, which at one time was scarcely mediocre, had improved enough to enable him to score a hundred or two, while his wicket-keeping was considered by many good critics of the game as quite first-class”. He played several important innings in 1901 for Ooty, and given his aggressive style was promoted to open the batting. The Madras Weekly Mail observed: “Seshachari is a fine bat, not only playing in an attractive style, but piling up his score particularly fast. He is very strong on the leg side, being an adept at the ‘pull’ stroke; and of late he has developed an off-stroke by which he sends the ball with great force and rapidity past extra cover.” In 1902, he even began bowling and had several successes, although his wicket-keeping was too valuable to the team for him to progress with the ball. The Madras Weekly Mail concluded at the end of the season that he would be a certainty in any team chosen to tour England.\n\nAround this time, Seshachari came to wider prominence and his name even became known in England. For example, one of the European cricketers whom he faced at this time was E. H. D. Sewell, shortly before the latter moved back to England to begin a prestigious journalistic career in which he more than once spoke favourably of Seshachari’s wicket-keeping. Even more importantly, in 1902–03, a team of former Oxford University cricketers, the Oxford Authentics, toured India. For their game against the United Hindus at Bombay, the home team was selected from across India rather than just regionally. Therefore Seshachari was chosen as wicketkeeper. The visiting team were impressed by Seshachari’s wicket-keeping, considering him the best they had played against in India. He also saved the game with the bat, being given a gold watch and chain in recognition of his cricket in that match. From that point on, his reputation was assured. One writer in 1903 even classed him above European wicket-keepers, noting that he “nearly came up to the standard of first-class wicket-keeping at home [in England]”. Again, the desire for writers to make qualifications and comparisons was irresistible; they projected a sense of mild bewilderment that a “non-European” could be so successful.\n\nAfter this, we enter one of those periods about which we know nothing. Seshachari did not play much in 1904–05; Cricket noted that “his attention had to be given to business”. A later article in the Advocate of India suggested that he had “for the last few years … been planting on the Nilgiris [and] has nowadays no opportunities for practice.” Perhaps this indicated that he was in some way involved in the tea plantations there, presumably in some administrative capacity on behalf of the British (a 1907 report in the Lahore Civil and Military Gazette previewing the Presidency v Hindus match said that Seshachari was “stationed” in the Nilgiris and again had not been able to play much cricket); he could also have been associated in some way with the British administrators who spent the summer months there owing to its cooler climate. But quite simply we don’t know what he was doing in this period when he was not playing cricket. However, he had not been forgotten.\n\nJ. G. “Jungly” Greig (Image: Hampshire Cricket History)\n\nIn terms of the record books — which are largely meaningless for an Indian cricketer at this time owing to the rather arbitrary nature with which later historians have assigned first-class status to matches in India — Seshachari made his first-class debut in February 1906, playing for the “Hindus” against the “Europeans” in the annual Bombay Presidency Match. This game cemented his reputation owing to his crucial contribution in the fourth innings: Seshachari made a sensational stumping off J. G. Greig, a key batter who had played first-class cricket for Hampshire, to the delight of the crowd. As a result, the “Europeans” were defeated and Seshachari was the hero. The following year, the “Hindus” won again; this time Greig was bowled for a duck but he betrayed how much Seshachari had got into his head: he initially refused to leave the crease as he thought that the wicket-keeper had deliberately disturbed the stumps.\n\nFrom then, Seshachari was a fixture in the “Hindu” team for the Bombay Triangular Tournament (between teams representing “Europeans”, “Parsees” and “Hindus”), playing in six successive competitions between 1907 and 1912 (the latter being a Quadrangular as the “Muslim” team competed). But as a wicket-keeper, his undoubted skill was not reflected statistically in the scores. But this was not the limit of his achievements because he was part of a team assembled by the Maharaja of Natore that defeated the Calculta (now Kolkata) Cricket Club (an all-white team) in 1906. The incensed English team, in the person of their captain, criticised the Maharaja, asking how many “gentlemen” he had picked; the implication was he had paid a team of professionals to defeat an amateur team. Fifty years later, Romesh Ganguly wrote about the match, recalling “the cricket colossus, Seshacahri, dark and forbidding, in his stand in close vicinity behind the stumps. The fastest ball would not remove him from his place of operation so near to the batman’s citadel. He crouched low and I wondered if the bails would not be disturbed from their cradle on top of the stumps by the volume of air let out by his lungs which I thought had the capacity of bellows. He reminded me of the sinister hill that hangs over the edge of a plain. I noticed some of his fingertips were somewhat crooked. What made them so? The question intrigues me even today!”\n\nAt the height of his fame in this period, Seshachari was the subject of several newspaper features, which was how he came to feature in Cricket. From these articles, we get a sense of the style of cricketer that he might have been. The Advocate of India described his wicket-keeping: “Seshachari is in the very front rank of stumpers, and both by his skill and his style reminds one very much of H. Martyn, the famous Oxford University and Somersetshire keeper. He takes the ball with consummate ease and lack of unnecessary movement, and whips off the bails with invisible speed.” Cricket noted that he stood up even to fast bowlers, “taking the ball with consummate ease on either side.” It concluded: “He is both quick and neat at the same time, and what he does he does with pluck, determination, and skill, leaving absolutely nothing to chance. His wicket–keeping is quite first class and brilliant enough for any county; in fact, many people think that he is one of the best wicket–keepers in the world.” The Madras Weekly Mail in 1902 singled out his ability to stop “fast, wide balls on the leg-side” (which it attributed to a tendency for Madras bowlers to use leg-theory) and noted that he made wicket-keeping look easy. In short, Seshachari was without question one of the best wicket-keepers in the world even though he had not played outside of India at the time.\n\nThat was to change in 1911 when his skills were revealed to a wider audience when, after many aborted attempts, an “All-India” team (i.e. a team comprising all the different groups) finally toured England. Earlier proposals, inspired by the successful tours of England by West Indian and South African teams at the turn of the century, fell through largely for a want of finance. Some tours progressed further than others in the planning stage. For the 1904 season, a programme was organised and a team selected: Seshachari was one of those invited. But the tour collapsed in January when insufficient funds could be raised. And for a proposed tour in 1907 which never materialised, the Bombay Gazette listed players who had been invited, once again including Seshachari. There was little doubt that he was a certainty for any representative Indian team.\n\nThe idea of a tour was revived in late 1909 in response to a difficult political situation after an Indian student in London, Madan Lal Dhingra, assassinated Curzon Wyllie that July. There was a backlash against India in Britain, and therefore a group of men planned a tour to reinforce the “bonds of Empire” — a common notion at the time — and perhaps reduce prejudice. The main impetus came from J. M. Framjee Patel, who had also been involved in the aborted earlier tours; perhaps most importantly, he was able to secure financial backing for his latest plan. It was notable that the majority of those behind the tour were Indian rather than European, a sign of the shifting control of Indian cricket. Contact was made with the MCC and the tour was arranged for the summer of 1911 (after a South African tour was cancelled to allow for the Triangular Tournament to take place in 1912). And when the team was selected, it was inevitable that Seshachari would be invited, although in an interview in October 1909, the well-known cricketer M. E. Pavri suggested that Seshachari — like several others who had been selected for the abandoned tour — had been “completely out of form” and would owe his potential selection to his former reputation alone. Nevertheless, that reputation preceded him and was mentioned in several previews of the tour in England. E. H. D. Sewell was particularly keen to emphasise his effectiveness as wicket-keeper.\n\nSewell also met the team when they practised at Lord’s upon their arrival in England and was able to write an article for the Sheffield Daily Telegraph which gave more details about the individuals in the side. He told his readers that Seshachari (he accurately recorded his personal name as Kilvidi) was 5 feet 11 inches, and that he also enjoyed tennis and billiards.\n\nThe Indian team at Inverness in 1911, when Seshachari was captain. Seshachari is seated third from the left in the second row. This was one of the few published team photographs which identified the Indian players. (Image: Cricket, 12 August 1911)\n\nThe tour was not especially successful, and the “All-India” team had an underwhelming record: they lost ten and won just two of fourteen first-class matches (there were six wins and fifteen losses in all matches). By some distance the best player was Palwankar Baloo, who took 75 wickets at an average of 20.12 with his left-arm spin. Baloo and Seshachari had played together frequently, although they were at extreme opposite ends of the social scale, and had established an effective partnership as bowler and wicket-keeper. As for Seshachari, he attracted little attention. He played in ten first-class games but managed just 47 runs at 4.70; he missed some games through injury and Syed Hussain kept wicket in his place. The only time he was especially noticed was when the tour reached Scotland and he captained the team in all three of the matches played there — including the first-class game against Scotland — and in two matches in Ireland. In this capacity, he was interviewed for the Dundee Evening Telegraph (which remarked that he “speaks English fluently”, as if this was a matter of some surprise) but had little to say other than expressing admiration for the Scottish scenery and suggesting that the Scotland team was at least the equal of some of the English county teams (as the examples that he gave were Somerset and Leicestershire — the teams that finished in the last two places in the County Championship in 1911 — it might have been a mixed compliment from the acting captain). He had nothing to say about himself or about his team. When the team returned home, he had done little to increase his reputation although there were comments in the press about the soundness of his wicket-keeping. However, he had made some useful acquaintances, including J. N. Pentelow, who became the editor of Cricket shortly after.\n\nAfter 1912, it is possible that Seshachari moved on from Ooty; his final appearance in the Bombay tournaments came that year. He had played 19 matches which are today judged to have first-class status, scoring 138 runs at 5.75; he completed 20 catches and 16 stumpings. Something must have changed because he spent time in 1913 travelling in Europe. During this trip, he visited England, when he called on Pentelow socially. The latter reported this in the pages of Cricket, describing Seshachari as one of “the best wicket-keepers who have ever represented overseas teams in England”; Sechachari had told him that he intended to play as much cricket as possible while in England. And he was true to his word, playing some games for Dulwich Cricket Club. On his way home, he wrote to Pentelow from Paris expressing gratitude at his warm welcome there. However, this episode caused a little confusion in later years; at the time of Seshachari’s death, the Madras Mail garbled the story and reported that he had been educated at Dulwich College. As we have seen, this was picked up in later years and stated as fact; very possibly those who saw him guessed (incorrectly) that he could only have learned to be such a good wicket-keeper if he had been educated in Britain. But there is no record of Seshachari ever having been educated at Dulwich and the confusion almost certainly arose from his time playing for Dulwich Cricket Club in 1913.\n\nSeshachari’s last match recorded on CricketArchive was played over New Year 1914, for the Maharajah of Natore’s XI against a European team.\n\nLittle else is known of Seshachari’s life; we don’t know if he continued to work on the Nilgiris, nor how he was able to afford time travelling in Europe in 1913, although it would suggest that he was independently wealthy. Nor do we know if he married or had children; other than the meagre facts of his cricketing life, he is something of a mystery. He died suddenly of pneumonia at the Medical College Hospital in Calcutta in 1917. There was a brief Wisden obituary, which called him the “best wicket-keeper India ever produced” but otherwise one of India’s most accomplished pre-Test cricketers was forgotten.\n\nAn idyllic cricket scene, photographed at Ebernoe on the Sussex Downs in 1938. Reality was rarely as picturesque. (Image: Tatler, 3 August 1938)\n\nIn the popular imagination, cricket fields of the past were tranquil places. The lingering — albeit largely nonsensical — notion of the local vicar bowling at the blacksmith on the village green remains appealing for many who yearn for a mythical past. But even in the dim and distant past, the sport had a hard edge. Some men depended upon it for their livelihood; others used it for their own advancement. And there were cricketers — even former public schoolboys — who drifted into lives of crime. However, occasionally it was the cricket field itself that was the scene of a crime or the place of its resolution. There have been a surprising number of arrests made during cricket matches, some of which were quite high-profile, such as the arrest of the captain of a Canadian touring team. But others were much more low-key, only attracting press attention through some passing detail such as a suspect appearing in court still dressed in their cricketing clothes. While this might sound like the beginning of a whimsical trawl through pleasant cricketing anecdotes, many stories contained a much darker element; cricket fields were not immune from the problems of the real world.\n\nCricket matches were sometimes an opportunity for arrests to be made simply because policemen were taking part. For example, in 1913, an off-duty policeman, Constable Theed, was playing in a match near Hitchin when he spotted the 53-year-old Llewellyn Howard Davies, who was wanted by police, walking past the ground and confronted him. Despite futile denials of his identity, Davies was arrested and taken to a police station by Theed, who was still dressed in his cricket whites. Davies was quite a colourful character: a former Church-of-England clergyman turned conman. He had been unfrocked by the Church twenty years earlier after he had a child with a servant: not only did he try to persuade her to conceal the birth, he demanded that she marry another man in order to explain away the child and absolve Davies of responsibility. After this, he drifted towards fraud; he served a one-month sentence in 1909 for “false pretences” but that did not provoke a change of course. In 1911, he was sentenced to eighteen months’ hard labour for his part in a scheme — carried out with two of his sisters — in which he took lodgings with twenty-four different women but left after a week without paying any rent. Upon his release, he was required to report to the police regularly, but had failed to do so in fifteen months when Theed spotted him at the cricket ground. Davies first claimed that the bag that contained his licence had been stolen but he later changed his story to say that he thought he was supposed to the Church Army authority rather than the police. In any case, he was sentenced to a further month in prison. He was imprisoned again in 1916 for unlawfully obtaining credit. In 1918, he was declared bankrupt, but by 1923 he was once again attempting to defraud, this time in hotels.\n\nA similar case of police making an arrest at a game in which they were taking part occurred in 1926 when the former Surrey professional Ronald Lowe attempted to steal money from the pavilion of a match in which he was the scorer; he rather unfortunately chose to do so during a game between two police teams and was promptly arrested.\n\nJ. W. H. T. Douglas in 1926 (Image: Wikipedia)\n\nA very different arrest at a cricket ground took place during a first-class match in August 1924, when an attempt was made to defraud a famous player. On the first day of the game between Essex and Northamptonshire at Leyton (on which no play took place owing to rain), the Essex captain J. W. H. T. Douglas received a phone call from a man called Hill whom he initially believed he had played cricket with previously. He asked for a favour — that Douglas advance him £2 to pay for the repair of a motor lorry that had broken down. Douglas quickly became suspicious and informed the police, and when “Hill’s” representative, Holman Arthur Kerry (a 39-year-old accountant of no fixed abode) arrived at the Leyton ground to collect the money, he was questioned by police. Unable to explain satisfactorily the route his lorry had taken before breaking down, he was arrested and later admitted his subterfuge.\n\nOn other occasions, it was a participant in a game who was arrested. In 1925, George Stephens was arrested by police while taking playing in a match at Willesden. Taken immediately to the police court, he appeared in the dock still wearing his cricket whites. He was charged with stealing a gold watch from the house in which he was lodging; the arresting detective noted that he had previous convictions for theft and had also deserted his wife (and had planned to marry again bigamously). Stephens had also been discharged from the army during the First World War for bad conduct. Although he had no job, he had lodgings in several different places. He was sentenced to three months’ hard labour.\n\nHorsham Cricket Club in 2009 (Image: geograph.org.uk)\n\nAt more well-attended games, police were often present to guard against potential pickpockets or opportunist thieves. In 1931, at Horsham Cricket Ground, a man called James McDougall from Great Yarmouth attracted the suspicion of two policemen at the game by his strange actions. Over a period of half an hour, he was observed lurking between cars parked at the cricket ground, looking inside them. He then went and stood behind a group of men watching the cricket and was seen to tap the pocket of one, and then move along the line and stand between two others. After returning to the cars, he again went to tap the pocket of one of the group. He entered one of the drinking booths, before returning to the parked vehicles and leaning into an open touring car. At that point, he realised that he was being watched. He tried to leave, but was arrested and 1s 5d was found on him. He appeared at Horsham Police Court charged with “loitering with intent to commit a felony”, where the two policemen reported that he had not watched any of the cricket while they observed him. It emerged that McDougall had a string of convictions stretching back to 1921 for, among other things, loitering and stealing money. McDougall claimed to have turned his life around since his last conviction in 1927, marrying and joining a showman’s business in Great Yarmouth. He claimed to be in London on business and had taken a holiday at Horsham for the day, and had no intention of stealing. But he was found guilty and sentenced to a month in prison.\n\nOne of the more horrific arrests connected to a cricket ground came in July 1931, involving a 23-year-old man called Arthur James Faraday Salvage (who was named as a grandnephew of the scientist Michael Faraday in some press reports). A twelve-year-old girl called Ivy Mary Godden had disappeared from her home a few days previously; after a two-day search, her body was found buried at Ruckinge, near Ashford in Kent. She had been killed by several blows to the head, but there was no apparent sexual motive to her murder. The police used bloodhounds to trace who was responsible, and these led investigators to the house which Salvage shared with his mother. When the police visited the house, a friend ran to find Salvage; he found him keeping wicket in a cricket match on Ruckinge sports field. After a hurried conversation, Salvage left with his friend and was later arrested by police and charged with murder. Salvage eventually confessed to the police, but withdrew the confession at his trial in September 1931. He was nevertheless found guilty and sentenced to death, but he was subsequently declared legally insane and committed to Broadmoor. Around this time, he also made a confession to the murder of an 18-year-old woman called Louisa Maude Steele that January, but police concluded that he had nothing to do with that case.\n\nAnd sometimes, very rarely, a cricket ground was itself the scene of a crime. One strange tale took place in Doncaster but it tells us more about the uses to which cricket grounds were put outside of sporting hours than it does about the sport. Although the town was never a cricketing powerhouse in the same way as Sheffield or Leeds, there were a few notable players associated with the area and big cricket occasionally came to Doncaster at the Town Fields Cricket Ground, whether it was an appearance by the All-England Eleven in 1862, or the annual visit of Yorkshire teams in the 1920s, when they played early-season warm-up matches against Doncaster Town Cricket Club. However, in 1924 the ground became nationally notorious for events unconnected to cricket, after a strange case which involved an illicit meeting place for couples, a “peeping Tom” and a stabbing.\n\nJames Doyle (Image: Leeds Mercury, 11 December 1924)\n\nAround 10:30pm on Saturday 6 December 1924, the police were called to the Town Fields ground, located, close to Doncaster Racecourse, on Bennetthorpe. When they arrived, they discovered a dead man who had been stabbed in the lower abdomen, lying in a pool of his own blood, near a footpath close to the Hyde Park entrance to the ground. He was taken to the local mortuary but there was no sign of any weapon; medical examiners concluded that he had been kneeling when stabbed. The man was Albert Needham, a 38-year-old who had worked in South Kirkby Colliery, ten miles from Doncaster. If people questioned why he was so far at home so late at night, they did so quietly at first. A friend of Needham, a 33-year-old Doncaster labourer called Wilfred Thurstle, had been with him when he was stabbed, and reported to the police that he had been involved in an altercation with a couple shortly beforehand. The following Tuesday, a 23-year-old man called James Doyle (a miner from Armthorpe Colliery) — accompanied by his fiancé, the 17-year-old Doris May Wilford — attended a solicitor’s office in Doncaster and made a statement, after which he was advised to go to the police. He did so, and was arrested. He was charged with murder and remanded in custody.\n\nAt the inquest on 22 December, the full story began to emerge. Needham and Thurstle had been at the cricket ground to spy on “courting couples” — in other words, men and women who were using the ground as a secret meeting place at night. To watch, they used a lamp and had a type of knee-pad (presumably so they could remain kneeling for a long time), and although Thurstle consistently denied that the two men had attempted to blackmail the couples they found, it seems very likely that they were doing so (as there would have been no need for a lamp if they intended to remain concealed). According to Thurstle’s account, they had been in the cricket field when Doyle, who was with Doris Wilford, climbed over a gate to challenge them, and after a brief altercation stabbed Needham. The latter managed to stagger away some distance before collapsing. Thurstle claimed that Doyle then attacked him, but he broke free and followed Doyle for a time until he lost sight of him and his fiancé. When he later appeared in court as a prosecution witness against Doyle, Thurstle claimed that “hundreds of people” spied on couples regularly in Doncaster. However, he did not attempt to justify his actions, and suggested that it was Needham who had introduced him to the practice, in which they had been engaged for six months. There were even hints in court that he was part of a larger, organised gang involved in “peeping Tom” blackmail. He also admitted trying to hide evidence that Needham had been spying on couples after his death.\n\nDoyle’s version, supported by his fiancé, was that he had been attacked by the men, and only produced the knife — which was a Boy Scouts’ dagger — to frighten them away. He said that they attacked him after he challenged them, and he merely used the knife to defend himself after they had thrown him to the ground and kicked him; he claimed to have drawn the knife when getting up. Doyle said that he had been unaware of the severity of Needham’s injury, and when he saw Wilford the next day, he discounted as rumour news that a man had been stabbed to death; Doyle even thought he had seen Needham alive and well that day. Thurstle, by contrast, said that while he was following Doyle and Wilford from the ground after Needham’s death, Doyle turned to brandish the knife and when Thurstle said “Do you know you have killed that man?” Doyle replied, “Yes and I’ll kill you.” Doyle’s account was broadly supported by his fiancé, who said that the pair had been watched previously while at Doncaster Cricket Ground; she said that Doyle had leaped over the wall of the ground to confront them. She did not see the struggle, except for noticing a pair of feet in the air and hearing a groan. Doyle’s biggest problem was that he was carrying a knife: his father told magistrates that he had remonstrated with Doyle for doing so on previous occasions. It had also been his father who convinced Doyle to make his statement to the solicitor, when he told him what had happened.\n\nAlthough everyone who spoke about the circumstances was appalled at the actions of Needham and Thurstle (even the prosecutor at Doyle’s eventual trial for murder expressed his distaste), it seemed quite straightforward; an inquest jury returned a verdict against Doyle of “manslaughter under great provocation”, although they were highly critical of Thurstle. Remanded in custody, Doyle appeared before magistrates in January 1925, and was committed for trial, charged with murder (although there was some debate whether the charge should have been murder or manslaughter) at Leeds Assizes. In the interim, a public subscription raised £100 for his defence funds, which might indicate where the sympathies of the public lay. The trial took place at Leeds Town Hall in March 1925. Thurstle and — oddly — Wilford were the prosecution witnesses, but the defence did not call anyone. The prosecution claimed that Doyle had killed Needham in an unprovoked attack, and asked for murder or manslaughter as the verdict. Doyle’s barrister argued that the jury either simply had to choose whether to believe Thurstle — in which case it was murder — or Doyle — in which case it was self-defence because he was attacked by two men. In summing up, the judge remarked that Doyle’s story might be considered to receive some corroboration, because Wilford’s evidence contradicted Thurstle, and suggested that the police suspected he was not telling the truth (presumably about the blackmail element). After deliberating for around ninety minutes, the jury found Doyle not guilty of both murder and manslaughter, and he was set free. He and Wilford married later that year. Doyle died in 1940; his wife remarried and lived until 2000.\n\nThe “Peeping Tom” case, as it became known, is perhaps not a cricket story, even if a cricket ground featured heavily. Nor is it too certain what to think of the outcome: if Doyle attacked Needham out of anger when he realised that he and his fiancé were being spied upon, that was hardly a proportionate reaction even to something as seedy as public voyeurism. And it was his word against Thurstle as Wilford did not actually see what happened. On the other hand, it is not impossible that two men engaged in a blackmail plot might attack someone who challenged them. In any case, it casts a very different light on the romantic ideal of a cricket field. Instead of wily parsons bowling off-spin, we have unfrocked vicars convicted of fraud; instead of enraptured spectators watching romantic sixes being hit into neighbouring fields, we have murderers being arrested and furtive couples being watched by probable blackmailers. Real life very rarely matches up to fantasies, not even historical ones.\n\nGeorge Hirst (Image: Wikipedia)\n\nInnovation in cricket has — until fairly recently — usually made the establishment throw up its hands in horror. Elements that have become key parts of the game — over-arm bowling, the googly, reverse swing, the switch-hit — were initially greeted with hostility and suspicion. Some innovations, such as bodyline bowling or the largely vanished doosra, were altogether too much and disappeared. Such hesitancy was usually rooted in the fear that cricket would be changed for the worse, that it would become unrecognisable, that the best elements would be lost. For example, fear of the googly (apart from the fact that it made batters look rather silly) was based on the notion that it would make batters reluctant to play shots on the off-side, but this never happened. Some changes to the rules — like the legalisation of overarm bowling, the incorporation of boundaries into the playing field or the covering of pitches — undoubtedly did make an enormous different to the sport. But it was swing bowling, a discovery made at almost the same time as the googly, which has perhaps had the biggest impact on cricket in the last 120 years. The modern red-ball game still largely respects the conventions established in the first years of the twentieth century: keep the ball shiny as long as possible; bowl with the seam upright; treat the new ball with respect (both as a bowler and as a batter); beware the full-pitched ball; and be careful driving when the ball swings. Even today in T20 cricket which is dominated by batters, just for a brief over or two at the start of an innings, armed with a new ball, a swing bowler can command some respect and might nick out one or two of the opposition before the carnage can commence.\n\nFor all its impact, swing bowling never had the mystique that surrounded other bowling innovations. For example, the invention of the googly by was the object of fascination for decades. The romanticised story of how Bernard Bosanquet supposedly invented it while playing a table-top game became part of cricket’s history, not least as it was promoted by Bosanquet himself. The origin of swing bowling was far murkier; George Hirst, the person who is generally credited with its discovery, never really spoke about it or revealed how he came to develop the technique. And cricket being cricket, not everyone accepted that Hirst had in fact been the first to bowl it; some argued that it was far older, and had been around since the days of Alfred Mynn. Whether or not that is true depends entirely on how swing bowling is defined.\n\nMatters were complicated by the fact that it took cricketers and journalists quite a while to identify swing as a deliberate phenomenon, and distinct from what today would be described as drift. Both were known in the early twentieth century as “swerve”, but were achieved via distinct methods. Two of the leading “swerve” bowlers before the First World War were Australia’s Monty Noble and England’s Sydney Barnes, but neither would be classed as swing bowlers in the modern sense. They achieved movement through the air by spinning the ball while delivering it above medium-pace, which made it “swerve” in the direction of the spin before breaking back in the opposite direction after pitching. In the modern game, this phenomenon — known as the Magnus effect — is the reason that spin bowlers achieve “drift”. The concept of medium-paced spin as practised by Noble and Barnes has been lost from the game since the 1920s, but at the time that swing was discovered, most medium-pacers spun the ball (although few as successfully as Noble or Barnes).\n\nIt is not quite clear how or when swerve-drift came into cricket, but most historians have suggested that it came from baseball. The historian Ray Robinson, in On Top Down Under (1975) suggested that Noble acquired the technique from playing baseball in his youth: “Instead of pressing two or three fingers on the ball’s seam, like a spinner, Noble held it between his thumb and his strong corn-studded forefinger. On the truest of tracks all he needed was some sort of headwind for this spin-swerve to be difficult.” In turn, Barnes learned from Noble how to make the ball break in the opposite direction to its drift. Barnes later wrote: “[Noble] said it was possible to put two poles down the wicket, one 10 or 11 yards from the bowling crease and another one five or six yards from the batsman, and to bowl a ball outside the first pole and make it swing to the off-side of the other pole and then nip back and hit the wickets. That’s how I learned to spin a ball and make it swing. It is also possible to bowl in between these two poles, pitch the ball outside leg stump and hit the wicket. I spent hours trying all this out in the nets.”\n\nBut others had used this “baseball technique” before Noble, in order to make the ball move through the air. Writing in 1898, George Giffen singled out John Harry as “a useful man in any team …he can bowl with either hand (his puzzling baseball curves have often severed a long partnership)”, and noted that when the 1896 Australian team returned home from England via the United States, the Philadelphian bowlers “upset our batsmen” with their “baseball curves”. One of these Philadelphian bowlers was a man sometimes credited with the invention of modern swing bowling.\n\nThe case of Bart King is a tricky one. He was a fast bowler from Philadelphia who played between 1893 and 1912, but his reputation has grown over time. It is possible to get a little over-excited about King’s ability — several historians have done so — and call him the greatest bowler of all time, but most of his cricket was played against substandard opposition in the United States. His fame rests largely on his achievements during three tours of England with the “Gentlemen of Philadelphia” in 1897, 1903 and 1908. On the latter tour, he headed the first-class bowling averages for the season with 87 wickets at 11.01 (when, despite later hype, the Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News suggested at the end of the season that “possibly he has lost a little of his former command over the ball in bowling, but the pace is still there, and on occasions he swerves in quite his old style”). There was no doubt that King could move the ball through the air at pace. But there was confusion in the following years over how he achieved it. For example, in an interview with Cricket in 1897, he himself noted: “The out-curve is of very little use except as a change, especially against American batsmen, who generally score off it. The out curve is bowled with a lower action than the in-curve, but you have to put so much spin on the ball that it won’t come off the pitch quickly enough to be generally effective. On the other hand, the ball from an in-curve will often break in from the off as well as curl in the air, and it breaks in very quickly.” In other words, he was achieving movement with spin rather than what would today be called swing. Otherwise, he noted that: “It seemed to come natural to me from the time that I first began to bowl, but, of course, I found out things as I went on. For instance, I found that the in-curve—or, as you might say, the curve from the off to leg—could not be bowled, except with a very fast ball.” But he dismissed any suggestion that he had learned the technique from baseball. He noted: “I used to pitch at baseball at one time, but I have given up that game”. He further suggested that his ability with the ball had not arisen from baseball as pitching was a very different skill.\n\nBart King (Image: Wikipedia)\n\nOverall, it seems almost certain that King was a “spin-swerve” bowler rather than a swing bowler. For example, in 1911, after swing bowling had become commonplace, Pelham Warner (in one of his innumerable books) grouped King’s bowling with that of W. T. Greswell, a Somerset bowler who spun the ball to create “swerve”. And other writers, all of whom acknowledged King’s ability to “swerve” did not suggest that this was dependent on the new ball, something that was quickly recognised as a key element in “swing-serve”. The only unusual feature (noted for example in a Leeds Mercury article in 1904) about King’s bowling noted by contemporaries was that he moved the ball into the right-hander, at a time when most right-arm bowlers moved the ball the other way. Therefore King must have bowled a leg-break as well as an off-break, to account for the ball moving both ways through the air, a skill later mastered by Noble and Barnes.\n\nIf King was highly regarded (his Wisden obituary gave him the doubtful praise of being “beyond question the greatest all-round cricketer produced by America”), and Warner at one time or another called him “one of the finest bowlers of all time”, it is notable that he made little impact in England as the three tours by Philadelphian teams were not successful on or off the field. Nor did his Wisden obituary make any link with swing bowling except to note: “King made the ball swerve late from leg, demonstrating that what could be done with the ball by a pitcher at baseball, at which he was expert, could also be achieved with a ball half an ounce heavier”. There was no suggestion at that time that he invented modern swing bowling.\n\nKing’s name often emerged during discussions about swing bowlers, when writers attempted to pin down when the phenomena had first emerged in cricket. Few made the distinction between spin-swerve and swing. In 1903, C. B. Fry recalled that when he first played cricket ten years earlier, there were no deliberate “swervers”, although he named J. T. Rawlin of Middlesex as one who made the ball move. He also suggested that Walter Wright of Kent (who was also mentioned by Altham) could make the new ball swing by accident: which might indicate that he sometimes made the ball swing in the modern sense. And it is doubtless true that over the years, many bowlers accidentally swung the ball without every learning how, or managing to deliberately control it. Others identified proto-swing bowlers, but again did not distinguish between the methods used to make the ball move. Harry Altham, writing about the history of “swerve” in the Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News in 1924, noted that round-arm bowlers in the first half of the nineteenth century (most notably Alfred Mynn) made the ball “curve”. He also noted several bowlers, such as W. G. Grace or C. M. Cunliffe, who made the ball swerve enormously from leg. He also noted that Fred Allen, a left-handed bowler in the 1878 Australian team, swerved the ball. Altham, however, noted: “But we must in fairness admit that these early swervers were isolated portents; with them it was a natural gift, unanalysed, and not to any marked extent controlled nor were they, in all probability, sufficient in numbers to exercise any effect on the general methods of first-class batsmen.” He credited King with being the first to swerve deliberately, and attributed this to baseball techniques; he suggested that the success of Albert Trott, Frank Laver and Monty Noble in the late 1890s was also attributable to “baseball influence”. In fact Altham entirely overlooked the change that came over cricket when it was discovered that the ball would swing without spin being applied.\n\nThe first man to bowl deliberately what would today be recognised as swing — depending on the new ball, atmospheric conditions and not lasting throughout an innings — was undoubtedly George Hirst of Yorkshire. The man himself rarely spoke about it, and was (understandably) reluctant to reveal too much about his discovery. The contrast to Bernard Bosanquet’s romanticisation of his own legend is striking. Possibly Hirst was less of a self-publicist than Bosanquet, but equally possibly class prejudice played a part: Bosanquet was an amateur, Hirst was a professional.\n\nGeorge Hirst showing his grip of the ball (Image: Wikipedia)\n\nHarry Pearson, in First of the Summer Wine, his 2022 study of Hirst, Schofield Haigh and Wilfred Rhodes, summarised the facts: “What we know for certain is that George Herbert ended the 1900 season as what [the Yorkshire wicket-keeper] David Hunter called, ‘A little man who bowled fast and straight, nothing more’ and whose best years [as a bowler] seemed to be behind him. He returned in May 1901 bowling a delivery that nobody had ever seen before — a booming late in-swinger that Hunter estimated could move as much as 4ft between the wickets. Batsmen were baffled and alarmed by [Hirst’s] new-found swerve. Its impact was revolutionary, more profound even than Bernard Bosanquet’s unveiling of the googly in 1900.”\n\nHirst — not entirely convincingly — always claimed that it was a mystery how he did it. For example according to Pearson, he once said: “The ability to do this seemed to come to me gradually — almost unconsciously in fact … With a new ball the swerve is most in evidence; why this should be I cannot explain. Then some days the swerve is more pronounced than others. I cannot explain that either, except on the theory that on some days a man is in better form than others. Sometimes a cross wind will help the swerve considerably. It is very difficult to explain how the swerve is brought about, or why it is more evident on some days than on others.” Pearson observes: “As to what made the ball swing, well, he seemed as baffled as the batsmen who faced him.” This might suggest someone who had no conscious influence over the path of the ball: wild, uncontrolled swing. Yet Hirst was able to control his bowling extremely precisely; it was no fluke, but carefully calibrated and deadly to batters who had never seen anything like it. Sammy Woods once said (according to A. A. Thomson) of facing Hirst: “How the devil can you play a ball that comes in at you like a hard throw-in from cover-point?”\n\nPearson believes that Hirst copied drew inspiration from King in 1897 and Albert Trott in 1897–98. And he describes how Wilfred Rhodes specified what made Hirst’s bowling different from other “swervers”, who made the ball move as soon as they released it: “George’s swerve was a different ball entirely… It used to go straight at the start, and, sometimes, it looked like it was going wide. Then, when it was just past the highest point in its flight, it would dip and swerve inwards.” In other words, it was the late movement that was devastating. It transformed Hirst from a batter who bowled, and whose average had steadily climbed as his number of wickets fell (62 first-class wickets at 26.90 in 1900), to a bowler who was second in the averages behind Rhodes in 1901 (183 wickets at 16.38). And despite his increasing age and heavy workload as a top-order batter, Hirst maintained that kind of level for the next ten seasons. There is little point in listing the incredible bowling figures he returned when conditions were in his favour, but it is worth noting that Wisden enthused about his “terrific” bowling in 1901, and that his two best performances that year were seven for 23 in an innings against Lancashire (who were all out for 44), and match figures of twelve for 29 against Essex (who scored 30 and 41). Lord Hawke later wrote of that match: “Some experienced competent spectators and the powerful batting side against him declared they had never witnessed anything like it.”\n\nGradually, opponents (and his own baffled team-mates) began to untangle what was happening. For example atmospheric conditions made a difference, and a new ball was required as the swing wore off as an innings progressed. Keeping the ball shiny for as long as possible (rather than roughing it up to help the bowlers’ grip as had previously been common) became vital, which gradually ended the long-standing practice of opening the attack with a spinner. The best deliveries were fast ones that moved late as they reached the batter, which meant that the bowler had to pitch the ball up far more than would have been considered wise a few years earlier. In fact, the most dangerous delivery was almost on a half-volley length that would previously been dispatched for four; now a drive was dangerous because of the possibility that the ball might swing. But confusion persisted. For example a book on the mechanics of ball swerve in various sports written by P. A. Veile in 1905 (Swerve. Or the Flight of the Ball: Cricket, Lawn Tennis, Golf) rubbished the idea that a new ball was required for swerve. In this, he was enthusiastically supported by the reviewer in Cricket, who added: “We have known bowlers who could and did always make the ball swerve, whether it was new or worn by a month’s practice, whether there was absolute calm or a high wind. There have been bowlers who could not help making the ball swerve if they tried, although few of the men who swerve can say ‘I will make this ball swerve, while the next one shall not swerve,’ and carry out their intention in such a way as to convince a sceptic.” In other words, their ability to swing the ball owed more to luck than intent. The reviewer singled out King and Noble as two of the few men who could swerve at will, although he did not discuss their technique. Veile went into more technical discussion about the possible mechanics of swerve in various sports. But according to Veile, Hirst was on record as saying that when “the seam is off, the swerve is off”; Veile took issue with this, saying that he could make a tennis ball and an old cricket ball swerve, but the Cricket reviewer was unconvinced.\n\nOthers quickly took up Hirst’s technique, which might raise a few questions about how secretive he was actually was, or if he acquired the skill from another (unknown) person who also shared it with other early pioneers. An article in the Leeds Mercury in 1904 noted that G. W. Beldam (more famous as a pioneering cricket photographer) and C. J. Burnup were just two of the bowlers “whose success is entirely dependent on the swerve”; Beldam rarely bowled until he discovered swerve. The author said: “[It is] plain what a revolution in the methods of cricket has been effected by the swerve; and its development is undoubtedly the most interesting feature in the progress of the game during the last twenty years.” C. B. Fry, writing in June 1903, also believed that swerve was “a fine field for experiment”; he noted that rather than the customary requirement of a bowler to control length and break, the “artificial swerve” made it difficult for batters to judge, in a similar way to a flighted ball from a spinner. He observed: “Now every county almost has its server, who is of set purpose put on first to snick a wicket or two before the ball loses in seam, or gloss, or whatever is the special swerving virtue of a new ball. Hirst’s swerve is a by-word.” Even within two years of Hirst’s discovery, Fry noted several “swervers”. And he had clearly spotted the distinction between the phenomena of swing and drift, observing the need for a new ball.\n\nOver the next few years, more was learned, such as the influence of atmospherics, and how the ball swung far more in England than in the rest of the world (as Hirst discovered during a tour of Australia in 1903–04). But especially in England, swing was soon massively influential; leading bowlers of the next two decades, such as Frank Foster or Johnny Douglas, utilised the technique with great success. Noble and Barnes tended to be classified alongside the other swing bowlers, even if theirs was the more old-fashioned “spin-swerve”. And after the First World War, medium-paced spin faded out of the game apart from a few short-lived exceptions simply because swing bowling (and by the mid-1920s, modern “seam” bowling where the ball moved off the pitch as well as through the air) was more effective and easier to master. By the 1930s, “swerve” had been renamed as “swing”, but discussion about the scientific principles behind it, and the mechanics of what was actually happening, continued well into the 1980s and beyond.\n\nThe impact on batting was long-lasting. Batters opened their stance (facing more towards mid-on, a technique disparaged as a “two-eyed” stance) to counter late swing, to the outcry of purists who decried the aesthetic loss. Pads became used as a second line of defence to stop the ball if it beat the bat, again causing purists to splutter in rage. Neville Cardus, who often lamented how cricket was not as good as it had been, wrote in 1925 (in the Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News) how modern bowlers were too dependent on the new ball. He wished for a return to the days of medium-paced spin and those who could make the old ball swing (which he seems to have attributed to the spin-swervers) and complained how it had transformed batting into a back-foot, “two-eyed” and on-side practice. Around the middle of the twentieth century, when cricket in England was anaesthetised by medium-paced inswing bowling aimed at packed leg-side fields that reduced run-scoring to a crawl and drove away spectators, swing bowling was blamed (alongside changes to the lbw law) for the ruin of the sport.\n\nThe changing role of opening batters gives the clearest idea of the impact of swing bowling. Once upon a time, openers were often the best players in the side and operated aggressively. While there were stone-walling openers in the nineteenth century such as William Scotton, Louis Hall or Frank Barlow, it was more common to see attacking batters such as W. G. Grace, Archie MacLaren, Jack Brown or C. B. Fry at the top of the order. Victor Trumper, one of the best of all, batted with brilliant effect as an opener, regularly decimating bowling attacks in the early stages of an innings for Australia; Jack Hobbs (at least before the First World War) did the same for England. But after 1914, a new type of opener emerged: the defensive expert whose job was to see off the new ball and its dangerous swing. This was perhaps exemplified best by Herbert Sutcliffe and Len Hutton, but the template laid down in this period was followed right up to the present day (particularly in English cricket), although there have been an increasing number of openers who have played in a much freer style that few modern fans would have realised is actually something of a throwback.\n\nMaybe the last word should go to Hobbs, one of the first batters to successfully adapt to the new style of “swing” and “googly” bowlers who emerged around the time he made his debut in first-class cricket. Writing in Wisden after his retirement in 1935, he summarised the changes he had seen across his thirty-year career: “One of the most notable changes in cricket with regard to bowling has been the introduction of ‘swing’ or ‘swerve’. No doubt long before my time bowlers were able to, and probably often did, make the ball swing, but it was not known then how this was brought about and quite likely when it occurred bowlers put it down to an extra strong current of air or some outside influence of a similar kind. The secret of being able to make a ball move about in the air was acquired during my era and at the present time almost anybody with any knowledge of bowling can send down swingers of one sort or the other.”\n\nClaude Makaula-White photographed in 1915 (Image courtesy of John Charlesworth and Kent College)\n\nAs the 1928 tour of England by the West Indies cricket team drew to a close, some of the visiting team played a one-day match that wasn’t part of the official programme. On 28 September, a team styled the “West Indies” played a Bolton Cricket League team at Piggott Park in Farnworth, a town near Bolton. The game was organised to raise money for the Social Circle Club by a man called Dr Lucas. The match was not taken too seriously by anyone — Learie Constantine scored 65 in 18 minutes (with eight fours and five sixes) in the West Indies’ brief second innings, when they scored 102 for four in eight overs — but the crowd of fewer than 2,000 was a disappointment. Nevertheless, although the game received hardly any coverage in the English press, it represented something unusual because only the non-white members of the West Indies team played, and the side was captained by Constantine. To fill the vacancies in the eleven, local players were recruited, but it is possible that they were not white either, implying some form of conscious decision by either the team-members or the organisers. For example, one of the reinforcements was a man called K. Narayansingh, about whom no information is available except that he took part in a tour of Scotland organised by Constantine the following year, when the press referred to him as a West Indian cricketer. Another recruit was a man listed as C. A. V. Makaula; he scored a duck batting at number eight and took three for 21 with the ball. More is known about Makaula than Narayansingh. He was actually South African and although he never quite made it as a cricketer, he played professionally for a time. And his story — and that of his family — is a remarkable one.\n\nTo understand the story of Claude Makaula, it is necessary to begin with his father, the man who came to be known as Albert Makaula-White. He had been born in what is today part of South Africa in 1865. His father — Claude’s grandfather — was Chief Makaula, Inkosi (ruler or king) of the Bhaca people who lived in Mount Frere, today part of the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. When Albert was a baby, he grew seriously ill; his mother, one of Chief Makaula’s wives, suggested taking him to a nearby Methodist mission to see if he could be cured. The minister of the mission was a British man called the Reverend Charles White, who lived there with his wife; they had no children. Chief Makaula said that if his son recovered, the Whites could keep him; otherwise they could bury him. In something that sounds like it belongs to the realms of fiction, the baby recovered, was adopted by the White family and renamed Albert Makaula-White. As a result of this unusual background, Albert spent part of his youth in South Africa among the Methodist community but also spent time in England. Certainly he was there around the time his adoptive father died in 1888 but returned to South Africa in 1890 when his adoptive mother was dying.\n\nWith both of his parents dead, Albert relocated to England where he began to study theology and followed in the footsteps of Charles White by becoming a Methodist minister. From October 1890 to October 1891, he attended the Richmond Theological College in Surrey. During that time, he appears to have travelled extensively around Britain, speaking to various Wesleyan groups, and lived at several addresses. His studies ended, according to the records of the Theological College, when he was “recalled” by the South African Methodist Conference. The historian Marika Sherwood, who has written about Albert Makaula-White, suggests that the conference was reluctant to continue funding the studies of an African, certainly after the death of Charles White. Therefore, Albert had to begin making arrangements to return home. In December 1891, he married Eleanor Botting, a dressmaker and the daughter of a carpenter, in Strood, Kent. The marriage certificate describes Albert as a Wesleyan Minister and described his father as a “native African chief”. Curiously, Albert’s address was in Pudsey, Yorkshire. Sherwood has tentatively identified a possible connection with that location through the Reverend Faraday, based at Pudsey’s Wesleyan Chapel, who was a former missionary in Africa and had lived in Kent for a time; perhaps he knew Albert from one or both of those locations and had invited him to stay with him after leaving the College.\n\nQuite how a mixed marriage would have been received in 1891 is hard to say, but it is extraordinarily unlikely that reactions would have been positive. Racism was widespread in Britain and other marriages between white English women and black Africans generated hostile reactions in newspapers. This might have been the explanation for a very strange and apparently false story printed in a local newspaper at the time of Albert’s marriage, which suggested that he had failed to arrive for the wedding. But the event certainly took place; there is just a hint that Eleanor Botting’s family either approved of the relationship or had at least accepted it, because two of their number were listed as witnesses on the marriage certificate. Perhaps there was social cachet in having the son of an “African chief” in the family.\n\nNot long after the wedding, Albert returned to South Africa; he was followed a few months later by his wife. They found a country changing rapidly and perhaps already becoming unrecognisable from the one in which Albert was raised by the White family. An influx of speculators and investors from Britain, chasing the newly discovered gold and diamonds of South Africa had changed the demographics and accelerated a hardening of racist attitudes, such as the denial of votes to non-white residents the passing of laws that restricted the rights of the native population. Mount Frere, renamed KwaBhaca, had grown, filled with white settlers such as lawyers, traders, government officials and a detachment of soldiers. It would have been a very different life for Eleanor Botting; according to Sherwood: “On arrival, the couple were housed in one of the ‘rondavels’ (a round one-room ‘hut’ with thatch roofing) in the Chief’s ‘Great Place’, with fresh water in the nearby stream and certainly no electricity.” Nor would Eleanor have been too popular with the white population owing to her marriage to Albert.\n\nSoon after, Albert and Eleanor moved around fifty miles, to a town called Idutwya, where he worked an Assistant Clerk and interpreter, receiving a salary of £120. When Cecil Rhodes visited Chief Makaula in 1894, Albert was the interpreter. And it was during this period that he and Eleanor had their three children: Irene Dorothy Frances (1893), Charles Frederick Clifton (1897) and Claude Albert Vivian (1898 or 1899). All three were born in Idutwya, but in 1899 Albert was promoted to “chief constable” and the family moved to Libode. Albert’s new role meant that he was the interpreter for a local magistrate and a kind of pseudo-valet who was also responsible for collecting “hut tax” for the government. In August 1901 he again acted as an interpreter for his father when the Duke of York visited Cape Town. But that December, Albert was charged with seizing goods from a hut-tax payer who had been unable to pay cash; he pleaded “guilty under provocation” and lost his job. An appeal was unsuccessful and he turned down an offer of work around 60 miles away that would have separated him from his family. Sherwood suggests that racism was at play in both his dismissal and the refusal of the appeal. But the loss of his job was the likely motivation for his decision in 1904 to take his family back to England.\n\nTherefore Claude moved to England around the age of five; although we do not know if he ever returned to South Africa, he certainly remained in England for the rest of his life. It is unclear what the family’s intentions were, but Albert soon began working as a farmer, despite a lack of previous experience. Nor is it clear whether Albert immediately worked on his own account or was employed by someone else, but by the time of the 1911 census — when the family lived at Stubble Hill in Harrietsham, Kent — he was listed as an “employer” (i.e. other people worked for him) and worked as a “small farmer”. Soon after, the family moved to Rose Lawn in Margate. Albert lived a quiet life as a farmer until early 1928, when the RSPCA took him to court for neglecting the pigs on his farm; there appears to have been a misunderstanding over who would feed the pigs in snowy weather, and he was fined £10. However, the story ignited interest in him and he was interviewed about his life in the local newspaper; the resulting article appeared in abbreviated form around the world, telling of how the “Zulu [sic] chief’s son” was working as a farmer in Kent. In later years, he suffered financial difficulty and noted rising prejudice on account of his race. He died in 1937.\n\nCharles Makaula-White in an undated photograph (Image courtesy of John Charlesworth and Kent College)\n\nIt is possible to trace Claude and his brother Charles after they settled in England. They are listed as being at (an unnamed) school on the 1911 census under the surname Makaula-White (Irene was visiting the family of William and Harriet Day, and was listed as Irene White). But from around 1913, possibly a little sooner, the two brothers attended Kent College, a Methodist school in Canterbury. We do not know if they attended as boarders (although this is quite likely), nor if they joined the school at the same time, nor precisely when they left. Whether through their choice or that of the school, the “Makaula” part of their name was dropped on school records and they were simply known as “White”.\n\nWhere the two boys finally become more than simply names on a page is on the sports field. By 1914, both featured in the first eleven of the school cricket team; both were bowlers, although Charles was more of an all-rounder, possessing a solid defence. Yet Claude, according to the school magazine, was at times devastating: “His bowling figures hardly do him justice, and at times he has bowled with wretched luck”. It described him as having “the makings of a good fast bowler”, “a very sound field, sometimes brilliant” and being “responsible for much of our success in boys’ matches” (i.e. games against other schools). If Charles improved with bad and ball in 1915, Claude suffered something of a falling off with the ball, losing some of his accuracy, but improving as a batter. It was at this point that both Charles and Claude seem to have left school, so we hear no more about their progress. But both seem to have excelled in at least one other sport; there is a photograph of Charles in what appears to be the school football team, and of Claude in the school hockey team.\n\nThe Kent College cricket team in 1915.

Horrell. On floor: E. A. Coleman, W. E. Watson, A. R. Skinner. (Image courtesy of John Charlesworth and Kent College)\n\nIt is worth dwelling a little longer on Charles. In later years, he played local cricket for Eythorne as a batter, but also played football for Dover United in 1928. Also that year he played one match for Kent Club and Ground; this might imply a trial for the county groundstaff rather than any suggestion that he was on Kent’s books. Did he want to play sport professionally? It is likely that he was talented enough; did reservations about his colour hold him back? Or perhaps his ambitions never lay in that direction because in later years he worked as a shepherd, according to a local obituary, and won prizes at county shows. He wanted to be a farmer but was never able to own a farm; he eventually became a miner until retiring in his sixties. One who worked with him recalled how he was “very popular with his workmates and in more lighthearted moments would tease them about his chieftain father”. He continued to play cricket for his local village. His son John was killed in an accident, aged just 25, in May 1950 while taking part in practices for the Isle of Man TT, and Charles was never quite the same afterwards. He died in 1976.\n\nAs for Claude, it is not entirely certain, assuming that he left Kent College in 1915, what he did for the next few years because the next certain trace of him comes in 1919, when he began to work for an auctioneers, Honeyball and Finn, in Deal, Kent, while continuing to live with his father. He was an articled clerk and responsible for handling large amounts of money but after failing to pass his examinations, he remained with the firm as an “improver” at a nominal salary of 25 shillings per week in order to study for another attempt. In July 1920, he chose to join another firm in Canterbury. But an audit of the Honeyball and Finn finances revealed that Makaula-White had been taking money from the firm. When confronted by a police officer, Claude not only admitted the charge but confessed to stealing a total of around £375 between August 1919 and May 1920. He used some of the money to buy a motorbike, but lost other amounts through stock investments and the purchase of pigs. His arrest and adjourned initial hearing in January 1921 was reported in the local press; the Thanet Advertiser used the headline “Sportsman Arrested” and called him “a well-known Thanet sportsman”. He was bailed until a hearing before the Recorder (which received no press coverage) in March 1921. He pleaded guilty to five counts of larceny (charges of “making false entries” were dropped) and was sentenced to five months imprisonment. He served his sentence at HMP Canterbury, and was listed as an inmate there on the 1921 census. This revealed that he had lost his job as a managing clerk after his imprisonment, and was a British resident but did not have British nationality.\n\nBowling Old Lane Cricket Ground in an undated photograph (Image: Bradford Sports History)\n\nIt was after his release that Claude seems to have decided to attempt a career in cricket. He spent the 1922 season in Bradford, playing for Bowling Old Lane, a club in the Bradford cricket League. At the time, the Bradford League was one of the most prestigious in England. Through being the only cricket league to continue employing professionals during the First World War, it had attracted some of the biggest names in English cricket. For a time in the early 1920s, alongside the Lancashire League, it was a serious counter-attraction to county cricket until the counties increased their wages beyond a point with which the Bradford League — a declining attraction by then — could compete. Nevertheless, some of the professionals in 1922 included the England Test cricketer Sydney Barnes and several players on the fringes of the Yorkshire cricket team. Claude — having dropped “White” from his name and listed as C. A. V. Makaula — seems to have only been with the club for one season. An article in The Athletic mistakenly called him “the Old Laner’s West Indian recruit” but he was successful, playing regularly and although his overall figures are not known, he took at least five wickets in an innings on three occasions. He was almost certainly playing as a professional — his family continued to live in Kent and there was no obvious other reason for him to be in Bradford. And if there is no indication of how he came to join Bowling Old Lane, perhaps there was some connection with his father’s acquaintances in Pudsey (a town with two clubs in the Bradford League); or maybe he had simply offered his services to a range of clubs because his school record would have been appealing to prospective employers, particularly if he was still a fast bowler.\n\nWe can be fairly sure that Claude was the only non-white player in the Bradford League at the time; there had been black and Asian players in club and county cricket before the war, but they were a rarity in the professional leagues. Only Charlie Llewellyn, who had appeared for Undercliffe during the war and who might have been mixed race (although he always denied it, and despite the suggestion in later years that there were rumours about his ethnicity, he generally seems to have “passed” as white), had appeared in the Bradford League or its main rival the Lancashire League. In the late 1920s and 1930s, the growth of West Indian cricket inspired several clubs to sign black players, but when Claude was playing for Bowling Old Lane, there had not been a West Indian visit to England for sixteen years.\n\nCharlie Llewellyn (Image: Wikipedia)\n\nDespite Claude’s apparent success, he was not retained at Bowling Old Lane, nor does he seem to have ever played for any other Bradford League clubs. Although he had not given up on his ambitions to be a professional cricketer, he returned to the family home in Kent, where he was tangentially involved in another criminal case in 1923 when his father prosecuted a man called William Samuel Barnard for stealing a bicycle and eleven silver spoons that belonged to Claude. The man had come to know Albert Makaula-White during the war, when Barnard was based at Manston Aerodrome, and he had visited the family home several times. In court, Barnard claimed to know nothing of the spoons, to have only borrowed the bicycle and to have left a note explaining such. He also claimed that Claude’s sister, Irene Makaula-White, had ordered him to leave the house and threatened to kill him (he unsuccessfully requested a protection order). Even though Barnard was found with pawn tickets for spoons, and had left the bicycle in at a garage for repair, and despite his apparently openly mocking and jocular tone in court, the case was dismissed. Barnard also claimed that he had been heading to Harrow School to work as a cricket coach, and that he had been in hospital until recently “with a serious breakdown”. This latter suggestion might explain why no further action was taken as he might not have been a well man.\n\nAround this time, Irene had begun an unusual career of her own. During the war, she had performed songs at Manston Aerodrome (where she might have met Barnard) and by 1920 she was advertising as a dance instructor, listing herself as a pupil of Mrs Leslie, the President of the London Teachers’ Dancing Association, By 1928, according to a report in a South African newspaper, the Daily Dispatch, she was performing in the London Pavilion as part of the chorus in Ol’ Man River. The report said that she had entered the theatre after “a recent heavy financial loss in the family.” But she had something of a talent for publicity. She — or someone on her behalf — also advertised as “Princess Irene”, the daughter of a “Zulu king” who supposedly sent her to Europe for her education. In the 1930s, she also spent time in France working as a “theatrical artist”. By the mid-1930s, she was claiming in the People newspaper that she could cure rheumatism with the touch of her hands. Although we do not know how successful any of her ventures were, she seems to have achieved a minor celebrity status. In later years, her path would cross once more with that of Claude.\n\nAs for Claude, after leaving Bowling Old Lane he seems to have returned to farming. He is listed on the Electoral Register at Godhead Farm in 1924, and in 1925 Poverest Farm in St Mary Cray, is listed as ‘Makaula-White & Son’. But this might only have been a stop-gap because he seems to have moved into cricket coaching; the same 1928 report that described his sister as appearing on stage in the Daily Dispatch said that Claude was a “well-known cricket coach in Dublin”. His daughter believed that this was a role at a school, and certainly becoming a school coach was an attractive option for professional cricketers who could not make it at the top level, or who could not find a well-paying club. Around the same time, he made a serious attempt to break into the Lancashire League, by that stage the premier club completion in England. In May 1927, still playing under the name C. A. V. Makaula, he was given a trial by East Lancashire Cricket Club during their match against Bacup after their usual professional, Ralph Whitehead, was absent with a torn muscle. According to the Athletic News (which mistakenly called Claude an Anglo-Indian), “the crowd was interested in his league appearance, and in his short stay he did well.” He scored 11 not out, batting at number four, before rain washed the match out. In 1928, he played twice in July for Rishon (one of many professionals the team tried that season) and did fairly well: he took four for 60 (and scored a duck) against Church and scored 26 and took three for 70 against Rawtenstall.\n\nThese appearances attracted some notice in the press. For example after the first match, the Accrington Observer and Times said: “Makaula, a West African, who has recently held a coaching engagement in Ireland, was engaged as professional, [which] invested the game at Rishton. on Saturday, with no little interest … In the professional for the day, however, one was not disapointed. A powerfully built man, he was obviously the most conspicuous man on the field, but his whole demeanour was pleasing.” The writer continued:\n\n“A right arm medium to fast bowler, he is the posessor of a very easy action, and he swerved the ball beautifully into the wickets. Though he only took four wickets at a cost of 60 runs he ought to have had six, for two catches were dropped. Unfortunately he did not shine as a batsman, being out to his fifth ball without scoring, but one got the idea from his stance at the wickets that he would indeed be a powerful hitter if he got going. I understand that the idea of bringing Makaula over from Ireland was that he should be given a trial with a view to being signed on as professional for the rest of the season. Although one would not like to commit oneself after seeing his one performance, one might easily say that the Rishton officials could go much further and fare worse.”\n\nA follow-up feature written before his second match noted that he was engaged at Sallins, a town in County Kildare, Ireland, but that the Rishton committee had not yet made an offer (although a suggestion a few sentences later that “no agreement was arrived at” could be interpreted to say that Makaula-White had not accepted the terms offered). This is the only indication of where he had been based in Ireland, and there is no explanation of what drew him there.\n\nAfter the second match, the same newspaper noted: “Chief interest in the match [against Rawtenstall] from Rishton’s point of view, lay in the appearance and performance of Makaula, a West African, who has recently held a coaching engagement in Ireland, and although his debut was not of the most favourable kind he gave ample indication that granted the opportunity to accustom himself more to Lancashire League Cricket he will certainly improve the Rishton side. What the committee think, however, regarding the appointment of a new professional remains yet to be seen.” He had another two catches dropped but played “some lovely strokes” in his 26. Ten days after the Rawtenstall match, the Todmorden and District News noted that Rishton were still seeking a professional but that their financial worries restricted what they were able to do, even though they were at the bottom of the league. It appeared that the club were still attempting to sign Claude, but nothing further was done.\n\nAlthough this was the limit of Claude Makaula’s Lancashire League experience, like he had been in the Bradford League, he was one of the first non-white players in the competition; Llewellyn had preceded him there, as he had in Bradford, and even while Claude was playing for Rishton, the Nelson Committee were in pursuit of the signature of Learie Constantine. Perhaps Claude’s novelty was what brought him to the attention of those who organised the match between the touring West Indies team and the Bolton Cricket League. The game was the idea of Dr Vincent St Claire Lucas, a Trinidadian doctor who lived in Bolton. Whether it was Lucas or Constantine who invited Makaula-White is uncertain. Nor do we know if Makaula-White played professionally for any other teams; there were several lower profile leagues, such as the Central Lancashire League and the Bolton League, but it is likely that the novelty of a “West African” playing would have attracted local press attention and there is no evidence of that.\n\nAfter this, Claude disappears from the records until his entry on the 1939 Register, taken on the outbreak of the Second World War. It listed him as living at Tenterden, Kent, with his mother and sister (“studying for professional singer”; she gave her birthday as 6 August 1903, taking around nine years off her age). The record gave his date of birth as 7 April 1897 and he was listed as a “feeding stuffs salesman”. All three family members had dropped the “White” part of their surname and were listed purely as “Makaula”.\n\nAt Maidstone in 1942, Claude married Iris Hadlow, a 33 year old woman who lived with her parents and worked in the local post office. The following year, their only child Joan was born (registered as Joan Makaula). They lived on St Luke’s Road in Maidstone from 1945 until 1967, and Irene lived with them until 1949, perhaps after their mother died in 1944. During the war, Claude worked as an ambulance driver and served in the ARP service. After the war, Joan recalled that he had “various jobs”, usually involving driving lorries, until he began working as a mechanic in a garage. She also recalled that he had an “abiding interest” in cricket and played until not long before his death. An obituary in the Kent Messenger said that he had worked “for 20 years as a servicing operator for Miles of Maidstone”, which was a distributor for Leyland Light Commercials. And, after Irene had become a naturalised British citizen in July 1962, Claude followed suite, receiving his certificate of naturalisation in June 1963.\n\nClaude died in Maidstone, aged 68, in October 1965. Three years later, his sister Irene died. His wife lived until 1988. The extraordinary story of him and his family was largely forgotten until Marika Sherwood (assisted by Gillian Rickard) began to research Albert Makaula-White around 2000, resulting in a book published in 2012, The Life and Times of Albert Makaula-White, an African Farmer in Kent 1904–1937. But the story of Claude’s connection with cricket, briefly mentioned by Sherwood, was never followed up. Which is unfortunate because it is a story that touches on many issues, including that of the restrictions placed on non-white cricketers in South Africa in this period and the country’s all-white Test team. His sadly unrecorded experiences growing up in England and attending a Methodist school in the mid-1910s would be a fascinating topic even had he never picked up a cricket bat. His family experienced racism, and his father was one of the few people to speak out about it. And Claude became one of the first non-white cricketers to appear in league cricket, just before the explosion of interest in black cricketers inspired by the success of Learie Constantine (whom Claude must have known). Ironically, had he tried again a few years later, the desire to emulate Nelson Cricket Club’s initiative with Constantine might have allowed him to pursue the professional career in the sport that he so clearly wished for.\n\nNote: Thanks to Marika Sherwood who kindly provided a copy of her work on Albert Makaula-White, without provided invaluable background for this article.\n\nGilbert Laird Jessop by Albert Chevallier Tayler, after a photograph by George William Beldam\n\nlithograph, 1905; 14 3/4 in. x 9 3/4 in.

And countless times it has been suggested that he would have been ideally suited to modern cricket: during times when cricket was played in dour, defensive fashion, there were frequent assertions that another Jessop would have broken the shackles; when first one-day and then T20 cricket became increasingly important, those of a historical disposition were quick to point out that Jessop had been playing that kind of cricket long before it was fashionable and would doubtless have excelled in the more frenetic formats. While this kind of speculation is always interesting, it can never be definitively settled and anyone trying to prove or disprove that Jessop would have been a success had he played in 2023 is deluding themself. However, owing to Jessop’s fame and the impact he had on cricket during his career, we know an enormous amount about how he played the game.\n\nA short summary makes it clear that Jessop would in many ways have been an ideal T20 cricketer. Aside from his batting feats, ludicrously fast scoring and ability to hit the ball to (and over) the boundary, he was an outstanding fielder and a serviceable fast bowler in his younger days. It is easy to imagine IPL franchises being desperate to secure his services. Yet he was the product of a different age: a schoolteacher turned stockbroker whose ambition to enter the Church of England was foiled by his lack of schooling. And he was an amateur who would never have countenanced professional sport; while happy enough to play alongside professionals, he had no desire to become one. Like most of his amateur contemporaries, he would have been appalled by the modern cricket world.\n\nBut in many ways, Jessop was ahead of his time in a cricketing sense; there had been hitters before him but none who even remotely approached his level of success. For example George Bonnor of Australia averaged 21 in first-class cricket and Charles Thornton averaged 19; Jessop’s average was just short of 33, which was more than acceptable for any batter in that period. Not that he would have cared, as he once wrote that “statisticians are anathema to me”. For all the risks that he took, he was extremely successful: to achieve an average over forty in an English season, as he did four times between 1900 and 1911, was extremely difficult and the mark of a quality batter. And if his style meant that he inevitably endured fallow periods (and throughout his career, his spectacular innings were often followed by a run of poor scores), when in form he could be extremely consistent. For example, he scored nine fifties in 15 innings in 1900.\n\nGilbert Laird Jessop (‘Men of the Day. No. 816.’) by Sir Leslie Ward\n\nchromolithograph, published in Vanity Fair 25 July 1901\n\n14 1/8 in. x 9 1/2 in. (359 mm x 242 mm) paper size\n\nReference Collection; NPG D45076\n\n© National Portrait Gallery, London\n\nNo other top players in this period batted like Jessop; lesser cricketers, such as Ted Alletson, might achieve a one-off success through slogging, but few built a career on big hitting and none as successfully as Jessop. Even relatively fast scoring batters from later periods such as Jack Hobbs, Donald Bradman or Viv Richards — all of whom were undeniably superior to Jessop — never approached Jessop’s scoring rate, although unlike him they were capable of batting in more than one way. It has only been over the last twenty years that it has become customary for Test and first-class batters consistently to score quickly as the default tactical choice. However, even if comparisons across history could ever be meaningful, we do not have enough data to make reliably comparisons between Jessop and modern batters. All we can do is to examine how he played.\n\nGerald Brodribb, in The Croucher: A Biography of Gilbert Jessop (1974), looked in great detail at the statistics available for Jessop’s career. According to Brodribb: “His fifty-three centuries were scored at an average rate of 82.7 runs an hour, while his 127 scores of 50 to 99 were made at an average rate of 76.32 runs an hour. Together his 180 scores of 50 or more were scored at an average rate of 79.08 runs an hour.” His fastest fifty took just 15 minutes (something he achieved in 1904 aginst Somerset and in 1907 against Hampshire) and is fastest century came in 40 minutes against Yorkshire in 1897 (he scored a a 42-minute century for the Gentlemen of the South against the Players of the South in 1907). Fifteen of his first-class hundreds were scored in under an hour. And in 1903, he scored 200 in two hours against Sussex (and in 1905 he managed 200 in 130 minutes against Somerset). He rarely batted for a long time. In first-class cricket, he batted 855 times but according to Brodribb: “Only once did he bat for more than three hours, only ten times for more than two hours, and only thirty-five times in all did he bat for more than 90 minutes.”\n\nGilbert Jessop batting (Image: Wikipedia)\n\nHe often dominated the scoring while he was at the wicket: for example, in 1901 he scored 66 out of the 66 runs added to the team score while he was batting against Sussex; in 1895, he scored 63 out of 65 against Yorkshire; in 1900, he scored 109 out of 120 against Middlesex; in 1908, he scored 75 out of 80 in the first innings against Nottinghamshire and then 78 out of 86 in the second. But such records rapidly become meaningless so often did Jessop dominate: 92 out of 106 (v Sussex in 1903); 110 out of 122 (during his 126 against Worcestershire in 1902); 171 out of 206 (for Cambridge against Yorkshire in 1899); 191 out of 234 (for the Gentlemen of the South against the Players of the South in 1907); or his highest score of all, 286 scored out of 355 against Sussex in 1903. Brodribb calculated that he made around 72 per cent of the runs scored by his team during his centuries.\n\nFor a modern audience, the only measurement of significance is the batting “strike rate” — the number of runs scored per 100 balls in an innings. The number of deliveries that Jessop faced is only known for a handful of larger innings as it was not customary to report this statistic until long after the Second World War; any evaluation of scoring rate was instead based on time at the wicket. Yet something about Jessop inspired journalists and spectators sometimes to keep track of how many deliveries he had received — something rarely done for any other player until the 1920s and 1930s. Brodribb recorded the most notable of Jessop’s innings for which we know how many balls he faced:\n\nFigures collated by Gerald Brodribb; their origin in usually uncertain and might not always include the delivery from which Jessop was dismissed.\n\nPerhaps some of these innings were scored against weaker counties on smaller grounds; but until 1910, a ball had to be struck out of the ground, not just over the boundary, to be awarded six runs. A hit into the crowd — worth six today — only counted as four. Under modern rules, some of Jessop’s innings would have been quicker and larger.\n\nSuch was Jessop’s fame that his career record attracted a great deal of analysis, most notably by Gerald Brodribb. Just a couple more points will suffice. During his first-class centuries, he reached three figures in an average time of 72 minutes and scored at an average rate of 82.7 runs per hour. The only batters from before the Second World War who matched or surpassed this rate in longer innings were out-and-out hitters — such as Jim Smith or Charles Thornton — whose average was considerably lower than Jessop. By Brodribb’s calculation, the “average” rate in cricket in this period was around 30 runs per hour; he worked out that of the leading batters who played before the Second World War, Frank Woolley and Victor Trumper averaged around 55 runs per hour; Charlie Macartney and Ranjitsinhji managed around 50 runs per hour; Donald Bradman, Archie MacLaren, Denis Compton between 45 and 50. While such statistics must be treated with caution — it is unclear how Brodribb reached these figures and slower (and smaller) innings would probably have been excluded from his calculations — they give an indication of how Jessop scored atypically quickly for the period in which he played.\n\nPerhaps more importantly was the perception that he scored quickly. Whenever he came out to bat, a ripple of excitement passed through the crowd. After his 93 against South Africa in 1907, one journalist spoke to the spectators: “‘I’d give up a day’s work to see Jessop,’ said a man with a dented bowler hat. ‘That’s what I call cricket!'” An innings by Jessop was guaranteed entertainment; he often aimed his shots at the largest buildings. His fame drew crowds of spectators and attracted headline writers and advertisers. One story might best illustrate this. Shortly after he had scored a double century for Gloucestershire, he appeared for a team representing the Daily Mail in a match against a club in Sutton. His first ball was bowled by a “gardener’s boy” who — according to Brodribb — bowled him with a shooter. The boy “yelled out a delighted ‘Hurrah!’ as he saw how he had got rid of the great man … and he proceeded to do a series of cartwheels all around the ground until such unseemliness was put an end to.” And everyone knew that the crowds came to see Jessop. On the last day of a match at the Hastings Festival in 1899, Jessop came down the pitch to a lob from Digby Jephson and missed, to be stumped. But the umpire Bob Thoms gave him not out, saying: “‘Not out … not out — sixpenny crowd — Saturday gate — can’t disappoint ’em — near thing — near thing — but not near enough for the occasion.” Jessop went on to score 68-minute century as the game rifted to a draw.\n\nHow was Jessop able to score so consistently quickly? He adopted his batting stance early in his career so that he was bent low over the bat in order to allow him to run down the pitch faster (adapting the idea from when he ran in sprint races). As a result, he was given the nickname “The Croucher”. He crouched so low that in 1904, he was given out lbw when hit on the head by the ball. But Jessop wrote in 1921: “I have had small reason to regret taking up a stance which a writer once graphically described as a position whereby the aroma of the pitch could be sampled to the best advantage.” At the same time, he also adopted an unusually low grip on the bat to allow him to switch his stroke at the last moment if the bowler saw him advancing and altered his length. His success was based on his strength, quickness of hands and feet, and depended on watching the ball very closely. Although he told his son never to premeditate a shot before the ball was delivered, he often predetermined when he would run down the pitch. A relative of his "
