Top-order batsman and wicket-keeper who has relished the responsibility of leading the BDCA’s latest power side.\n\nBDCA first XI career: Runs: 3501. HS: 209. Wickets: 1. BB: 1-0. Age: 29.\n\n• Daniel Barber (Kangaroo Flat) - given the chance to open the batting for Kangaroo Flat this season and has made half-centuries against two of the top teams – 78 against Golden Square and 59 against Eaglehawk.\n\nBDCA first XI career: Runs: 514. HS: 78. Wickets: 8. BB: 2-23. Age: 20.\n\n• Isaac Conway (Sandhurst) - top-order batsman and wicket-keeper who has a bright future, having already had a taste of Premier Cricket with Essendon this season.\n\nBDCA first XI career: Runs: 394. HS: 56. Age: 16.\n\n• Nathan Fitzpatrick (Bendigo) - an up-and-coming young gun of the BDCA, who is one of the players the Goers will be hoping to build their side around for years to come.\n\nBDCA first XI career: Runs: 387. HS: 84. Wickets: 17. BB: 3-24. Age: 16.\n\n• Jake Higgins (Golden Square) - bats, bowls leg-spin and also wicket-keeps. Is averaging 64 with the bat this season to go with eight dismissals behind the stumps.\n\nBDCA first XI career: Runs: 180. HS: 34. Wickets: 2. BB: 2-33. Age: 17.\n\n• Rhys Irwin (White Hills) - bowling all-rounder who enjoyed a career highlight earlier this season when he took 7-46 off 22 overs against Strathfieldsaye.\n\nBDCA first XI career: Runs: 375. HS: 44. Wickets: 34. BB: 7-46.Age: 19.\n\n• Cameron McGlashan (Eaglehawk) - all-rounder capable of opening the bowling and batting in the top order. Showed he can be a match-winner with both bat and ball last season with his double of 91 and 5-37 against Bendigo United.\n\nBDCA career: Runs: 330. HS: 91. Wickets: 31. BB: 5-37. Age: 19.\n\n• Jack Neylon (Strathdale) - made his first XI debut earlier this month, scoring 28 n.o. in an impressive showing against White Hills. Great to see the Neylon name back in the Strathdale side, with Jack the son of Suns’ great John Neylon.\n\nBDCA first XI career: Runs: 28. HS: 28*. Age: 15.\n\n• Miggy Podosky (Bendigo United) - opening bowler who is working hard to obtain all-rounder status with his improved batting. Already closing in on 150 wickets in just his sixth season in the first XI. One of the characters of the BDCA.\n\nBDCA first XI career: Runs: 232. HS: 44. Wickets: 141. BB: 7-25. Age: 24.\n\n• Hamish Schumacher (Strathfieldsaye) - top-order batsman who showed his class earlier this season with 70 against Strathdale-Maristians in the Jets’ best win of the past decade.\n\nBDCA first XI career: Runs: 304. HS: 70. Wickets: 2. BB: 1-6. Age: 17.\n\n• Cameron Taylor (Strathdale) - one of the star all-rounders of the BDCA who opens the batting and bowls leg-spin. Is a BDCA Cricketer of the Year winner and ticked off a milestone last weekend when he took his 100th career first XI wicket for the Suns.\n\nBDCA first XI career: Runs: 1873. HS: 127. Wickets: 101. Age: 27.\n\n• Harry Whittle (Huntly-North Epsom) - young all-rounder who dominated with the bat in the under-17s last season and is now working hard to make his mark in senior cricket. He certainly did that last weekend with 133 in the second XI against Bendigo.\n\nBDCA first XI career: Runs: 89. HS: 42. Wickets: 0. BB: 0-17. Age: 18.\n\nAUSTRALIAN CRICKET ASSOCIATION MASTERS XI\n\n• Terry Alderman – a smiling assassin who bowled lethal outswingers and off-cutters. Hopefully, some of the Bendigo batsmen can provide more resistance to Alderman than England’s Graham Gooch did in 1989 – an Ashes series in which he took 41 wickets.\n\nInternational career: Runs: 235. HS: 26*. Wickets: 258. BB: 6-47. Age: 57.\n\n• Greg Blewett – top-order batsman who burst onto the scene with an unbeaten 102 against England at the Adelaide Oval in 1995 – one of four Test centuries. Two years later he pummelled 214 against South Africa in Johannesburg when he and Steve Waugh batted the entire third day.\n\nInternational career: Runs: 3103. HS: 214. Wickets: 28. BB: 2-6. Age: 42.\n\n• John Davison – batsman best remembered for his 2003 World Cup innings for Canada against the West Indies when he made 111 off 76 balls in a knock that included six sixes. That innings was the fastest World Cup century at the time.\n\nInternational career: Runs: 843. HS: 111. Wickets: 40. BB: 3-15. Age: 43.\n\n• Matthew Elliott – left-handed opening batsman whose career highlight for Australia in 21 Tests was making 199 against England at Leeds during the 1997 Ashes Series. Played a season with Bendigo three years ago, helping the Goers end their BDCA finals drought.\n\nInternational career: Runs: 1173. HS: 199. Age: 42.\n\n• Brett Geeves – former Tasmanian speedster who toured South Africa with the Australian team in 2009, where he dismissed one of the world’s best batsmen, Jacques Kallis, during a one-day match in Cape Town.\n\nInternational career: Runs: 10. HS: 10*. Wickets: 5. BB: 2-11. Age: 31.\n\n• Murray Goodwin – batsman who played 90 international games for Zimbabwe and in 1998 scored a second innings 166 n.o. against a Pakistan bowling line-up including speedsters Waqar Younis and Shoaib Akhtar and spinner Saqlain Mushtaq.\n\nInternational career: Runs: 3232. HS: 166*. Wickets: 4. BB: 1-12. Age: 40.\n\n• Wayne Holdsworth – pace bowler whose career highlight was 7-41 for New South Wales against Queensland in the 1992-93 Sheffield Shield final – a season in which he took 53 wickets. Didn’t play any Tests or one-day internationals, but was a member of the 1993 Australian team that toured England, where he took a hat-trick in a warm-up game against Derbyshire. Age: 45.\n\n• Jimmy Maher – left-handed batsman who scored 223 for Queensland in the 2005-06 Sheffield Shield final against Victoria – one of his 27 first-class centuries - while he was also part of Australia’s 2003 winning World Cup squad in South Africa.\n\nInternational career: Runs: 438. HS: 95. Age: 39.\n\n• Graham Manou – wicket-keeper who played the Edgbaston Test on the 2009 Ashes tour to England, scoring 8 and 13*, as a late call-up after Brad Haddin broke his finger in the warm-up. Also played four one-day internationals on the 2009 tour of India.\n\nInternational career: Runs: 28. HS: 13*. Catches: 8. Stumpings: 0. Age: 34.\n\nTHE SORCERER OF SWING: Terry Alderman bowls in 1989.\n\nInternational career: Runs: 2468. HS: 130. Wickets: 118. BB: 5-103. Age: 53.\n\nTOP KNOCK: Matthew Elliott during his innings of 199 at Leeds in 1997.\n\nInternational career: Runs: 0. HS: 0. Wickets: 4. BB: 3-18. Age: 36.\n\n• Peter Sleep – an Australian leg-spinner before Shane Warne burst onto the scene. Helped win the 1987 Ashes Test against England in Sydney when he took 5-72 in the second innings to bowl Australia to a 55-run victory – the home side’s only win of the series.\n\nCLASS: Jimmy Maher bats during the 2003 World Cup.\n\nInternational career: Runs: 483. HS: 90. Wickets: 31. BB: 5-72.
