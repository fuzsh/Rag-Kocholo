        "text": "2 8 CRICKET : A WEEKLY RECORD OF THE GAME. F e b . 24, 1 9 1 0 . matches to be played this season between the States. The first match is due to commence at Hobart to-morrow. N . D o d d s and A. 0 . Facy have been nominated by the Tasmanian authorities for inclusion in the Australian team to visit New Zealand. O f the latter, â Nat L ee,â who contributes the cricket notes to the Tasmanian Mail, recently said:â A. C. Facy put up another fine bowling performance on Saturday, his figures for the afternoon reading eight wickets for 46 runs. On the opening day 34 runs were scored off him, and he failed to get a wicket. In the additional play 17 runs were knocked off him before he got a wicket, but once his arm found its swing there was a procession of batsmen from and to the pavilion on the New Town ground. He bowled at a great pace, kept a beautiful length, and his break­ ing back badly beat several of the suburb­ anites. With the exception of Dodds, who was bowled by Jones, every wicket which fell on Saturday went to Facy, and seven of his eight victims had their timbers knocked back. Facyâs bowling figures this season deserve to rank with the many splendid records put up by the leviathan C. J. Eady, and in view of the fact that his name has been mentioned in connection with the forthcoming ,tour of an Australian team through New Zealand, his fine successes cannot be lightly passed by. Facy is a young and most enthusiastic cricketer, and goes into a game with a whole­ heartedness that might well be emulated by others. He can also wield a vigorous bat, and is just the type of hitter to create uneasiness amongst opposing bowlers. He has so far this season captured 41 wickets at a cost of 296 runs, which gives him an average of 7'21 runs per wicket. His figures are so good that they are given in fu ll: Against.

At the end of January, too, he played at Sydney in C. T. B. Turner's match and bowled Noble without a run with a ball which sent a bail nearly 50 yards. E. B. F a c y , a younger brother of A.C.F., played his first A grade match on January 8 th, for East Hobart against North Hobart. H e went in tenth and, making only six singles, scored 94 out of 187 in 44 minutes. From the Tasmanian M a il :â â Out at Goorangoola, 24 miles from Singleton (N.S.W.), there are some sturdy Australians. On Saturday week (December 18th) a cricket match was played at Singleton between Goorangoola and another team, and one of the Goorangoola players, as his morn­ ing's work, milked 17 cows, brought in a load of hay and placed it in a shed, shod his horse, and rode into Singleton. During the afternoon he assisted his club to victory, and rode home the same night. Two other members of the Goorangoola team milked 35 cows before going into town.â I n the last week of 1909 the South of Tasmania beat the North, at Launceston, by the narrow margin of 13 runs, Harold Hale and A. C. Facy sharing the chief honours of the victory. Other close finishes in the series of matches, which dates back to 1850, have been as follows :â Margin. Won by. Ground. Season. 12 runs ..

A t Christchurch (N.Z.) on December 11th St. Albans made 449 during the afternoon for the loss of only four wickets. The score was as under :â B. B. Wood, c A. Nor­ man, b Caygill ...201 A. E.Ackroyd,runout 13 H. A. Bishop, b Bain... 15 E. E. Crawshaw, lbw, b Bain ...................91 T. W. Reese, notout... 33 H. C. Wilson, not out 75 Byes, &c...............21 Total (4 wkts) 449 Wood batted three hours and a-half and hit a five and twenty-six 4âs. H is stand with Crawshaw for the third wicket realised 212. The innings was declared closed first thing on the following Satur­ day, and Biccarton were dismissed for 183. St. Albans then went in again and made 69 for three wickets. The Weekly Press remarked :â â The official score of the St. Albans first innings gives Wood's total as 201, and not 198 as chronicled previously. On totting up the figures, one score book made him 203 and the other 200. The two captains thereupon agreed to record it as 2 0 1 .â A t Auckland on December 11th a schoolboy named Westbrook, playing for Devenport School v. Ponsonby, scored 209 not out in 90 minutes out of a total of 280 for five wickets, innings declared closed. He hit four 7âs (hits out of the ground), six 6 âs and three 5âs. On the same date Frank Shaddockâpresumably the old Nottinghamshire player of that nameâmade 162 not out in a total of 190 in 80 minutes â in a match played at a township on the North Island Main Trunk route.â He also took six wickets for 41 runs, performing the hat-trick. F r o m The W eekly Press (Dec. 29th) of Christchurch (N .Z .):â â A curious cricket accident occurred in a Hutt-Welliogton Central junior match at the Hutt Recreation Ground recently. Gourlay, a bowler for Central, sent down a fast ball, which struck Kobertson, the Hutt batsman, in the face, driving one of his teeth right through his cheek. Then, as if to add insult to injury, the ball fell and struck the wickct.â But it would have been oven harder lines for the batsman if it had been his tooth which fell on the wicket and removed a bail. A r e m a r k a b le accident occurred in the Otago-Southland match at Dunedin in the first week of January. The last ball of the innings S. Callaway drove straight back to the bowler, Scott, striking him on the forehead. The ball went about 60 feet in the air and was caught by Irwin at square-leg. Scott was able to walk off the field. The match, by the way, was won by Otago by an innings and 448 runs, Southland being able to score only 71 and 74 against a total of 593. Siede- berg made 162 and C. G. Macartney, who also took five wickets for 16 runs in the first innings, 118. The match quite failed to attract the public, and the takings for the two days amounted to ^£28 only. T h e Ceylon Sportsman records th at' A. J. Grant Cook, playing for Colombo C.C. A. v. Kalutara Cricket and Sports Club, at Kalutara on January 23rd, took all ten wickets in an innings o f 160 for 34 runs. T h e West Indian Inter-Colonial Tour­ nament opened at Trinidad on January 19th, and resulted in Trinidad carrying off the Cup. Owing to great pressure on space the scores are held over until the March issue. It may be said, however, that Trinidad beat Demerara by an innings and 180 runs and Barbados, who held the Cup, by 215 runs. Constantine scored 116 in the former match and N. Hart 100 not out in the latter. L a u n c h e d with a membership of five of the most substantial clubs in the New York district, and each the possessor of a private ground, there came into existence this month the New York and New Jersey Cricket Association at a well attended meeting of prominent cricketers held at the Hermitage, on Forty-second Street, Manhattan. This new move in the cricket world was the result of dissatisfaction, chiefly on the part of the Staten Island Cricket and Tennis Club and the New York Veterans Cricket Association, with conditions prevailing at the Prospect Park Parade Grounds, where many of the championship games o f the Metropolitan District Cricket League were contested, and where play was frequently interfered with by encroaching crowds. As a result of the formation of the new organization, the clubs at the Parade Grounds, hitherto regarded as the head­ quarters of the game in Greater New York, are practically isolated. The Staten Islandâs team is the only one, however, to withdraw from participation in the League competition, though the Club may retain its membership. The New York Veterans Cricket Association did not play League cricket heretofore, but will remain in the fold. T h e five clubs affiliated with the new Association are the Crescent Athletic Club and Bensonhurst C.C. of Brooklyn, the\n\nRkJQdWJsaXNoZXIy NDg4Mzg="
