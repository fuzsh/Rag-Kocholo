        "text": "Western Australia is in the box seat to snare a third-straight Sheffield Shield title after winning hosting rights in a crazy final round which included an upset in Tasmania which cost them home ground advantage.\n\nAfter ladder-leaders Tassie were beaten on their home deck by South Australia early on Wednesday, the WA bowlers rolled through Victoria for a second time in three days to seize an amazing 138-run win at the Junction Oval and set up a WACA decider in search of a three-peat.\n\n“It’s pretty amazing, today’s result, you could either miss the final or host one,” WA captain Sam Whiteman said.\n\n“It felt like the game was swaying one way or another every half-hour. There’s a pretty good feeling in the group right now”.\n\nWatch every match of the 2024 IPL Season LIVE on Kayo. New to Kayo?

You have to look to the batting for this game.\n\n“We’re on a journey, still a young group, so there are elements of that there. But this one does hurt quite a bit, maybe more than making the final and losing. It’s frustrating.”\n\nSutherland was in tears at the beginning of his post-match interview on the broadcast.\n\nAll the drama unfolded as rising NSW star Ollie Davies pounded out his third century of the season in Brisbane to propel his team towards an eight point haul against Queensland.\n\nDavies smashed 14 fours and a six in his innings of 131, off just 147 balls, taking his season run haul to 645, the most of any batters at NSW in a breakthrough red-ball season having made a name for himself as a T20 gun.\n\nHis effort pushed the Blues to 316 in their first innings, a lead of 172, having also picked up 2.16 bowling and batting bonus points which would rise to 8.16 points for the match should they win. It won’t however, be enough to challenge for a spot in the final.\n\nQueensland slumped to 4-42 in response before fight came from Jimmy Pearson (64) and Jack Wildermuth (47) who pushed their team’s lead to 115 runs, reaching 8-287 at stumps with one day to play."
