        "text": "TASMANIA is the new pole position owner in the WNCL after the Tigers defeated Queensland by 44 runs to dislodge the Fire from the top of the ladder.\n\nAfter Tasmania made 4/294 from its 50 overs, the Tigers then bowled the Fire out for 250.\n\nThere were plenty of big partnerships in the Tasmanian innings. Tassie began with a 63 run opening stance, which set the tone for what was to come. That was then followed by an 80 run second partnership, before the Fire were able to reel them in a little.\n\nIt did not last long though as the Tigers accelerated again in the back end of the innings.\n\nIt was all started by Lizelle Lee, with the star South African smashing 17 fours on her way to 97. Later in the innings Emma Manix-Geeves chipped in with seven fours on her way to 70 not out.\n\nMeanwhile for Queensland it was young quick Grace Parsons who was the pick of the bowlers with two wickets to her name.\n\nIn reply Queensland did not get off to a start as strong as Tasmaniaâ€™s, and as the wickets started to fall things really started to fall apart for the Fire, going from 2/67 to 5/95 in the space of about seven overs.\n\nThings did not really improve from there, with the visitors not able to put together a partnership of more than about 45 runs, with most partnerships closer to single figures.\n\nMikayla Hinkley topped the runs tally for Queensland with 49, while Georgia Redmayne made 45.\n\nMeanwhile for Tasmania the wicket taking duties were shared very evenly, with Hayley Silver-Holmes, Molly Strano, Nicola Carey, Sasha Moloney and Lauren Smith all picking up two wickets each.\n\nQueensland does not have long to wait to exact revenge, with the teams set to do battle again tomorrow."
