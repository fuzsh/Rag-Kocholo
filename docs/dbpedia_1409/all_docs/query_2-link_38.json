(Cricket Australia - Darren England/AAP PHOTOS)\n\nAll-rounder Jack Edwards has starred with bat and ball as NSW crushed Tasmania by six wickets in the one-day competition.\n\nCreate a free account to read this article\n\n$ 0/\n\n(min cost $ 0 )\n\nor signup to continue reading\n\nEdwards blasted 92 from 63 balls in the run chase after earlier taking two Tasmanian wickets during miserly spells in Melbourne.\n\nTasmania, with Beau Webster top-scoring with 65 and Edwards taking 2-24 from nine overs, were all out for just 198 in 49.5 overs.\n\nIn reply, Edwards led an early run-scoring rout and the Blues cruised to 4-202 and victory with a whopping 93 balls to spare.\n\nEdwards thumped 11 fours and four sixes in his aggressive 63-ball innings, dominating a 137-run partnership with fellow opener Daniel Hughes.\n\nHughes made a polished 58 from 71 balls while left-arm spinner Paddy Dooley (2-60 from eight overs) was the only multiple wicket-taker.\n\nEarlier, Tasmania's batsmen apart from Webster were collectively stifled by a disciplined NSW bowling line-up.\n\nBlues pacemen Edwards, Jackson Bird (2-27) and Hayden Kerr (2-40) were among the wickets while curtailing the run rate.\n\nTasmania lost opener Caleb Jewell for a third-ball duck to set a grim tone and they plunged to 6-75 in the 27th over.\n\nWebster then found an ally in No.9 Dooley, the pair putting on 90 runs for the seventh wicket.\n\nWebster struck six fours in his 80-ball knock and Dooley made 39 from 63 balls.\n\nBut after both were dismissed in a two-over span, Tasmania's innings soon ended with two run outs in the final over.\n\nAustralian Associated Press\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAd\n\nGet the latest Lismore news in your inbox\n\nSign up for our newsletter to stay up to date.\n\nEmail address\n\nWe care about the protection of your data.
