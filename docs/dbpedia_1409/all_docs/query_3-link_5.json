A team could already be chasing a revised target because of an earlier interruption when a terminal interruption occurs, necessitating a further recalculation.\n\nAdjusted highest scoring overs[]\n\nCompare the maximum runs scored by team1 in any set of overs (not necessarily consecutive) equal to the number of completed overs received by team2 factored down by 0.5% per over lost against team2 in those completed overs. So if team2 received 36.3 overs in a 50-over match, their score after 36 overs is compared to the highest scoring 36 overs of team1's innings (so could be any 36 of the 50 overs) factored down by 7%.\n\nExample: https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/benson-hedges-world-series-1993-94-60948/new-zealand-vs-south-africa-7th-match-65512/full-scorecard\n\nNew Zealand scored 256/7 from 50 overs. South Africa had scored 19/0 from 5 overs when play was halted. When play was able to resume, there was time for South Africa to receive 39 overs, so their target was revised to 229 as the highest scoring 39 overs of the New Zealand innings yielded 242 which was reduced by 5.5% for the loss of 11 overs.\n\nBirmingham League method: New Zealand's run rate is 5.12 per over. 11 overs are lost. South Africa's required run rate is (100 + (11 x 1.2)) x 5.12 ÷ 100 = 113.2 x 5.12 ÷ 100 = 5.80. Then 5.80 x 39 = 227 (rounded up).\n\nDLS method: The target for South Africa in 39 overs is 224.\n\nD/L method: New Zealand's resources = 100%. Resources (45 overs remaining, 0 wickets lost) = 95.0%. Resources (34 overs remaining, 0 wickets lost) = 81.3%. Resources lost = 95.0 - 81.3 = 13.7%. South Africa's resources = 100 - 13.7 = 86.3%. Target = 256 x 86.3 / 100 = 220.928 = 221 (rounded up).\n\nHighest scoring overs: The target for South Africa in 39 overs is 243.\n\nICC rain rule: Target = 256 x 89.3 / 100 = 229 (rounded up).\n\nICC rain rule (modified): Target = 256 x 89.24 / 100 = 229 (rounded up).\n\nLancashire League adjusted target: New Zealand scored 5.12 runs per over. 75% of this equals 3.84. South Africa lost 11 overs; 3.84 * 11 = 42.24. Target = 256 + 1 - 42.24 = 214 (rounded down).\n\nRun rate: The target for South Africa in 39 overs is 200.\n\nVJD method: The target for South Africa in 39 overs is 219.\n\nUnnamed method #1: New Zealand's run rate is 5.12 per over. Target = 5.12 x 39 + 11 = 210 (rounded down).\n\nBirmingham League method[]\n\nThe target run rate shall be calculated by using the following formula: (100 + {B x 1.2}) x C ÷ 100\n\nB = difference in the number of overs received by each team.\n\nC = average run rate per over achieved by the team batting first.\n\nAverage run rate per over = Innings total / number of overs allocated.\n\nNote 1: The run rate of both the first and second innings shall be calculated to two decimal places.\n\nNote 2: After any interruption during the first innings and time is lost, the formula shall be applied, and the adjusted run rate shall be agreed by the umpires and both scorers before the start of the second innings. Once agreed, it shall be final unless there is a further interruption and time is lost during the second innings.\n\nNote 3: If there are any interruptions to play during the second innings and time is lost, the formula shall be re-applied and the run rate for the innings shall be re-calculated on each occasion.\n\nNote 4: After any interruption during the second innings and time is lost, the adjusted run rate shall be agreed by the umpires and both scorers prior to the re-commencement of play and, once agreed, shall be final unless there are any further interruptions.\n\nExamples from https://www.birminghamleague.org/Download/Handbook_2021.pdf\n\nSituation Birmingham League method Factored run rate Lancashire League adjusted target Run rate Unnamed method #1 First innings score 222/7 (55)\n\nSecond innings reduced to 35 overs. 176 155.4 162 142 161 First innings score 222/7 (55)\n\nSecond innings reduced to 25 overs. 138 116.0454545 132 101 130 First innings score 222/7 (55)\n\nSecond innings reduced to 20 overs. 115 92.83636364 116 81 115\n\nClark curves method[]\n\nFor any interruption there are tables based on Clark Curves which give the revised target figure. In some types of interruption there is a calculation that involves a ratio of final score to wickets remaining to give a second figure and then using the lower of the two in the calculation.\n\nExample: https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/standard-bank-international-one-day-series-1996-97-60998/south-africa-vs-india-final-66078/full-scorecard\n\nRain between innings after South Africa had scored 278/8 from 50 overs resulted in an adjusted target for India of 251 in 40 overs.\n\nBirmingham League method: South Africa's run rate is 5.56 per over. 10 overs are lost. India's required run rate is (100 + (10 x 1.2)) x 5.56 ÷ 100 = 112 x 5.56 ÷ 100 = 6.23. Then 6.23 x 40 = 250 (rounded up).\n\nDLS method: The target for India in 40 overs is 247.\n\nD/L method: South Africa's resources = 100%. India's resources (40 overs remaining, 0 wickets lost) = 89.3%. Target = 278 x 89.3 / 100 = 249 (rounded up).\n\nICC method: 278 x 90.7 / 100 = 253 (rounded up).\n\nICC method (modified): 278 x 90.48 / 100 = 252 (rounded up).\n\nLancashire League adjusted target: South Africa scored 5.56 runs per over. 75% of this equals 4.17. India lost 10 overs. 4.17 * 10 = 41.7. Target = 278 + 1 - 41.7 = 237 (rounded down).\n\nVJD method: The target for India in 40 overs is 242.\n\nUnnamed method #1: South Africa scored 5.56 runs per over. Target for India = 5.56 x 40 + 10 = 232 (rounded down).\n\nConsecutive overs or run rate[]\n\nTeam2 had to exceed both the score achieved by team1 in their last number of overs received by team2 and also team1's overall runs per over through their complete innings. The latter was to allow for a team slowing down after a fast start to their innings. So if team2 were to receive 36 overs in a 50-over match, they had to exceed team1's total runs for overs to 15 to 50 and also team1's runs per over for their 50 overs (still based on 50 overs if bowled out).\n\nExample: https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/rothmans-cup-triangular-series-1989-90-60902/new-zealand-vs-australia-6th-match-65938/full-scorecard\n\nPlay was halted when New Zealand had scored 115/1 against Australia's 239/6 from 47 overs. When play resumed the New Zealand innings was reduced to 40 overs and the target revised to 204 as Australia had scored 203 in the last 40 overs of their innings. New Zealand then reached 167/2 from 34.5 overs when play ended.\n\nActual result: The target calculated was 178. Australia won by 10 runs.\n\nBirmingham League method: Australia's run rate is 5.09 per over. 12.1 overs are lost. New Zealand's required run rate is (100 + ((12 + 1/6) x 1.2)) x 5.09 ÷ 100 = 114.6 x 5.09 ÷ 100 = 5.83314. Then 5.83314 x (34 + 5/6) = 204 (rounded up).\n\nICC method: 239 x 83.7 / 97.8 = 205 (rounded up).\n\nICC method (modified): 239 x 83.51 / 97.70 = 204.28751279426 = 205 (rounded up).\n\nLancashire League adjusted target: Australia scored 5.09 runs per over. 75% of this equals 3.8175. New Zealand lost 12.5 overs. 3.8175 * (12 + 5/6) = 48.99125. Target = 239 + 1 - 48.99125 = 191 (rounded down).\n\nUnnamed method #1: Australia's run rate is 5.085106383 per over. Target = 5.085106383 x (34 + 5/6) + (12 + 1/6) = 189 (rounded down).\n\nCountback to score at equivalent point of team1[]\n\nCompare the team1 score after the exact number of overs received by team2.\n\nExample: http://static.espncricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1960S/1969/ENG_LOCAL/SUNLG/DERBY_ESSEX_SUNLG_18MAY1969.html\n\nDerbyshire batted first and scored 68/9 from 16 overs. Essex had reached 40/3 from 10 overs when play was halted, so their score was compared to the Derbyshire score after 10 overs of their innings (38).\n\nBirmingham League method: Derbyshire's run rate was 4.25 per over. 6 overs are lost. Essex's required run rate is (100 + (6 x 1.2)) x 4.25 ÷ 100 = 107.2 x 4.25 ÷ 100 = 4.56. Par score = 4.56 x 10 = 45 (rounded down).\n\nICC method (modified): Par score is 68 x 30.48 / 46.26 = 44 (rounded down).\n\nLancashire League adjusted target: Derbyshire scored 4.25 runs per over. 75% of this equals 3.1875. Essex lost 6 overs. 3.1875 * 6 = 19.125. Par score = 68 - 19.125 = 48 (rounded down).\n\nMaidens ignored run rate: Derbyshire scored 68 runs from 16 overs of which there were no maidens (4.25 per over). Essex scored 40 runs from 10 overs of which 1 was a maiden (4.44 per over).\n\nRun rate: Derbyshire scored 68 runs from 16 overs (4.25 per over). Essex scored 40 runs from 10 overs (4.00 per over).\n\nUnnamed method #1: Derbyshire's run rate is 4.25 per over. Target = 4.25 x 10 + 6 = 48 (rounded down).\n\nCountback to score at equivalent last completed over of team1[]\n\nCompare the team1 score after the number of completed overs received by team2, i.e. ignoring an incomplete over in the team2 innings.\n\nExample: http://static.espncricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1970S/1970/ENG_LOCAL/SUNLG/NORTHANTS_HANTS_SUNLG_10MAY1970.html\n\nHampshire scored 172/7 from 28 overs. Northamptonshire had reached 108/4 from 17.4 overs when play was halted, so their score after 17 overs (105) was compared to the Hampshire score after 17 overs of their innings (90).\n\nBirmingham League method: Hampshire's run rate was 6.142857143 per over. 10.2 overs are lost. Northamptonshire's required run rate is (100 + ((10 + 2/6) x 1.2)) x 6.142857143 ÷ 100 = 6.904571429. Par score = 6.904571429 x (17 + 4/6) = 121 (rounded down).\n\nFactored run rate: Hampshire scored 6.142857143 runs per over. 10.2 overs were lost, so 5.166667% is added. The adjusted run rate is 6.142857143 * 105.166667 / 100 = 6.460238095. Then 6.460238095 * (17 + 4/6) = 114.130873 (115 is a win, 114 is a loss).\n\nICC method (modified): Par score = 172 x 50.30 / 72.14 = 119 (rounded down).\n\nLancashire League adjusted target: Hampshire scored 6.14 runs per over. 75% of this equals 4.605. Northamptonshire lost 10.2 overs. 4.605 * (10 + 2/6) = 47.585. Par score = 172 - 47.585 = 124 (rounded down).\n\nRun rate and maidens ignored run rate: Hampshire scored 172 runs from 28 overs (6.14 per over). Northamptonshire scored 108 runs from 17.4 overs (6.11 per over). There were no maidens in the match, hence the results from the two systems are the same.\n\nUnnamed method #1: Hampshire's run rate is 6.142857143 per over. Target = 6.142857143 x (17 + 4/6) + (11 + 2/6) = 119 (rounded down).\n\nDuckworth-Lewis-Stern method (formerly Duckworth/Lewis method)[]\n\nFor any interruption there are tables which give the revised target based on the resources left at the time of any interruption. Unlike most other methods, the Duckworth–Lewis–Stern (DLS) tables take account of the number of wickets a team had left at the point of interruption. The tables have been revised over the years to follow trends in scoring rates in matches, and in early years a tie was not usually a possible result which it is now that the par score is rounded.\n\nExample (D/L method): https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/carlton-series-2000-01-61080/west-indies-vs-zimbabwe-7th-match-65607/full-scorecard\n\nPlay was halted when West Indies had scored 235/6 from 47 out of their allocated 50 overs. When play was able to resume Zimbabwe's target was adjusted to 253 in 47 overs, the higher score being to compensate the West Indies for Zimbabwe having to bat for three less overs but still having their full 10 wickets to use.\n\nActual result: Zimbabwe were bowled out for 175 in 40.2 overs. West Indies won by 77 runs (D/L method).\n\nDLS method: The target is 255.\n\nMaidens ignored run rate: West Indies scored 235 from 47 overs of which 2 were maidens (5.22 runs per over). Zimbabwe scored 175 from 47 overs of which 2 were maidens (3.89 runs per over).\n\nVJD method: The target is 251.\n\nEast League Calculator Method[]\n\nFor a terminal interruption, there are tables which give a revised par score based on the resources left when the match had to be ended.\n\nFactored run rate[]\n\nThe required run rate of team2 at the beginning of their innings is calculated by increasing team1's run rate by a percentage factor per over lost. The required run rate at the start of the innings is unaltered if there is a subsequent interruption including the case where the team batting second's innings was still 50 overs. A tie is only possible if the calculation leads to an integer.\n\nFor example, team1 score 225 in 45 of their 50 overs when rain stops play and prevents a resumption until 40 overs remain. Team2's required run rate is 102.5% in the case where each over lost is an increase of 0.5% (5 overs lost) so (225 x 40 / 45) * 102.5 / 100 = 205 (exactly).\n\nBirmingham League method: Team1's run rate is 5.00 per over. 5 overs are lost. Team2's required run rate is (100 + (5 x 1.2)) x 5.00 ÷ 100 = 5.30. Target = 5.30 x 40 = 212 (exactly). The target is 213.\n\nICC method: 225 x 90.7 / 96.0 = 213 (rounded up).\n\nICC method (modified): 225 x 90.48 / 95.90 = 213 (rounded up).\n\nLancashire League adjusted target: Team1 scored 5.00 runs per over. 75% of this equals 3.75. Team2 lost 5 overs. 3.75 * 5 = 18.75. Target = 225 + 1 - 18.75 = 207 (rounded down).\n\nUnnamed method #1: Team1's run rate is 5.00 per over. Target = 5.00 x 40 + 5 = 205 (rounded down).\n\nHighest scoring consecutive overs[]\n\nCompare the maximum runs scored by team1 in any consecutive set of overs equal to the number of completed overs received by team2 against the team2 in those completed overs. So if team2 received 36.3 overs their score after 36 overs is compared to the highest consecutive 36 overs of team1's innings (so that might be overs 1 to 36, 2 to 37, ..., 15 to 50). An incomplete team2 over was counted if there were more runs scored in it than the corresponding extra full over that would have been counted for team1. Any further interruptions resulted in a target being calculated on the average runs per over derived from the first interruption.\n\nHighest scoring overs (aka Most Productive Overs method)[]\n\nCompare the maximum runs scored by team1 in any set of overs (not necessarily consecutive) equal to the number of completed overs received by team2 against team2 in those completed overs. So if team2 received 36.3 overs, their score after 36 overs is compared to the highest scoring 36 overs of team1's innings (so could be any 36 of the 50 overs).\n\nExample: https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/benson-hedges-world-cup-1991-92-60924/england-vs-south-africa-2nd-sf-65155/full-scorecard\n\n(1992 World Cup semi-final between England and South Africa)\n\nEngland scored 252/6 from 45 overs when innings ended early due to slow bowling by South Africa. South Africa had scored 231/6 from 42.5 overs when play was halted. When play was able to resume, there was time for South Africa to receive only one more ball (43 overs in total), so their target was revised to 252 by discarding the two worst overs in the England innings (0 and 1).\n\nAdjusted highest scoring overs: England's highest 43 overs totalled 251. 2 overs were lost, so 1% is deducted. 251 * 99 / 100 = 249 (rounded up).\n\nBirmingham League method: England's run rate is 5.60 per over. 2 overs are lost. South Africa's required run rate is (100 + (2 x 1.2)) x 5.60 ÷ 100 = 102.4 x 5.60 ÷ 100 = 5.73. Then 5.73 x 43 = 247 (rounded up).\n\nD/L method: Resources (45 overs left, 0 wickets lost) = 95.0%. England's resources = 95.0%. Resources (2.1 overs left, 6 wickets lost) = 7.1%. Resources (0.1 overs left, 6 wickets lost) = 0.6%. Resources lost by South Africa = 7.1 - 0.6 = 6.5%. South Africa's resources = 95.0 - 6.5 = 88.5%. Target = 252 x 88.5 / 95.0 = 235 (rounded up).\n\nICC method: 252 x 94.2 ÷ 96.0 = 248 (rounded up).\n\nICC method (modified) : 252 x 94.06 ÷ 95.90 = 248 (rounded up).\n\nLancashire League adjusted target: England scored 5.60 runs per over. 75% of this equals 4.20. South Africa lost 2 overs. 4.20 * 2 = 8.40. Target = 252 + 1 - 8.40 = 244 (round down).\n\nUnnamed method #1: England's run rate is 5.60 per over. Target = 5.60 x 43 + 2 = 242 (rounded down).\n\nICC rain rule[]\n\nIf the innings of team2 is delayed or interrupted and it is not able to receive its full quota of overs, the target score shall be calculated as follows: the score of team1 shall be multiplied by the percentage factor for the number of overs to be bowled to team2, as set out on the Target Score Calculation Chart. Fractions shall be rounded to the next higher whole number.\n\nThe percentage factors have been derived from a detailed mathematical analysis of a database of one day matches with the object of establishing \"normal\" performance.\n\nOvers % Factor 25 66.7 26 68.4 27 70.2 28 72.4 29 74.2 30 76.0 31 77.8 32 79.1 33 80.9 34 82.2 35 84.0 36 85.3 37 86.7 38 88.0 39 89.3 40 90.7 41 92.0 42 92.9 43 94.2 44 95.1 45 96.0 46 96.7 47 97.8 48 98.7 49 99.6 50 100.0\n\nFor example, team1 score 188. The innings of team2 is limited to 37 overs:\n\n188 * 86.7% = 162.996\n\nTarget score = 163 runs\n\nNote: This gives absolutely no indication of how a match should be treated when the first side does not face 50 overs, and the second side faces even fewer overs. For example, in the 1995/96 India-Pakistan match in Singapore:\n\nIndia: 226/8 off 47.1 overs\n\nPakistan target: 187 off 33 overs\n\nHere is how I made it work:\n\nTarget = 226 * ( 33 over factor / 47.1 over factor ) = 226 * ( 80.9 / 97.9 ) where 97.9 is an estimation of the 47.1 factor (47 ov = 97.8%) = 186.75587 = 187\n\nActual result: Pakistan made 190/2 from 28 overs. Pakistan won by 8 wickets (with 30 balls remaining).\n\nBirmingham League method: India's run rate is 4.79 per over. 14.1 overs are lost. Pakistan's required run rate is (100 + ((14 + 1/6) x 1.2)) x 4.79 ÷ 100 = 117 x 4.79 ÷ 100 = 5.60. Then 5.60 x 33 = 185 (rounded up).\n\nCountback to score at equivalent point of team1 and Countback to score at equivalent last completed over of team1: After 33 overs, India were 151/3.\n\nDLS method: The target for Pakistan in 33 overs is 199.\n\nD/L method: Resources (2.5 overs remaining, 8 wickets lost) = 6.9%. This was lost, so India's resources = 100 - 6.9 = 93.1%. Resources (33 overs remaining, 0 wickets lost) = 79.8%. Target for Pakistan = 226 x 79.8 / 93.1 = 194 (rounded up).\n\nFactored run rate: India scored 4.791519435 runs per over. 14.1 overs were lost, so 7.08333% is added. The adjusted run rate is 4.791519435 * 107.08333 / 100 = 5.130918728. Then 5.130918728 * 33 = 169.320318 (170 is a win, 169 is a loss).\n\nICC method (modified): 226 x 80.70 / 97.84 = 187 (rounded up).\n\nLancashire League adjusted target: India scored 4.71 runs per over. 75% of this equals 3.5325. Pakistan lost 14.1 overs. 3.5325 * (14 + 1/6) = 50.04375. Target = 226 + 1 - 50.04375 = 176 (round down).\n\nMaidens ignored run rate: India scored 226 off 47.1 overs of which 1 was a maiden (4.90 runs per over). Pakistan scored 190 in 28 overs of which 1 was a maiden (7.04 per over).\n\nRun rate: India scored 226 off 47.1 overs (4.79 runs per over). Pakistan scored 190 in 28 overs (6.79 per over).\n\nVJD method: The target for Pakistan in 33 overs is 187.\n\nUnnamed method #1: India's run rate is 4.791519435 per over. Target = 4.791519435 x 38 + (9 + 1/6) = 191 (rounded down).\n\nBelow is a modified version based on the original. Using the original version, I found that a quadratic formula best fitted the original. This version is a ball-by-ball version from 0 to 50 overs, and the % factor is rounded to 2 decimal places.\n\nOvers % Factor 0 0.00 0.1 0.55 0.2 1.10 0.3 1.65 0.4 2.20 0.5 2.74 1 3.28 1.1 3.83 1.2 4.37 1.3 4.91 1.4 5.44 1.5 5.98 2 6.52 2.1 7.05 2.2 7.58 2.3 8.11 2.4 8.64 2.5 9.17 3 9.70 3.1 10.22 3.2 10.74 3.3 11.27 3.4 11.79 3.5 12.30 4 12.82 4.1 13.34 4.2 13.85 4.3 14.37 4.4 14.88 4.5 15.39 5 15.90 5.1 16.40 5.2 16.91 5.3 17.41 5.4 17.92 5.5 18.42 6 18.92 6.1 19.42 6.2 19.91 6.3 20.41 6.4 20.90 6.5 21.40 7 21.89 7.1 22.38 7.2 22.87 7.3 23.35 7.4 23.84 7.5 24.32 8 24.81 8.1 25.29 8.2 25.77 8.3 26.24 8.4 26.72 8.5 27.20 9 27.67 9.1 28.14 9.2 28.61 9.3 29.08 9.4 29.55 9.5 30.02 10 30.48 10.1 30.95 10.2 31.41 10.3 31.87 10.4 32.33 10.5 32.79 11 33.24 11.1 33.70 11.2 34.15 11.3 34.60 11.4 35.05 11.5 35.50 12 35.95 12.1 36.40 12.2 36.84 12.3 37.29 12.4 37.73 12.5 38.17 13 38.61 13.1 39.04 13.2 39.48 13.3 39.91 13.4 40.35 13.5 40.78 14 41.21 14.1 41.64 14.2 42.06 14.3 42.49 14.4 42.92 14.5 43.34 15 43.76 15.1 44.18 15.2 44.60 15.3 45.01 15.4 45.43 15.5 45.84 16 46.26 16.1 46.67 16.2 47.08 16.3 47.49 16.4 47.89 16.5 48.30 17 48.70 17.1 49.11 17.2 49.51 17.3 49.91 17.4 50.30 17.5 50.70 18 51.10 18.1 51.49 18.2 51.88 18.3 52.27 18.4 52.66 18.5 53.05 19 53.44 19.1 53.82 19.2 54.21 19.3 54.59 19.4 54.97 19.5 55.35 20 55.72 20.1 56.10 20.2 56.48 20.3 56.85 20.4 57.22 20.5 57.59 21 57.96 21.1 58.33 21.2 58.69 21.3 59.06 21.4 59.42 21.5 59.78 22 60.14 22.1 60.50 22.2 60.86 22.3 61.22 22.4 61.57 22.5 61.92 23 62.28 23.1 62.63 23.2 62.97 23.3 63.32 23.4 63.67 23.5 64.01 24 64.35 24.1 64.70 24.2 65.04 24.3 65.37 24.4 65.71 24.5 66.05 25 66.38 25.1 66.71 25.2 67.04 25.3 67.37 25.4 67.70 25.5 68.03 26 68.35 26.1 68.68 26.2 69.00 26.3 69.32 26.4 69.64 26.5 69.96 27 70.28 27.1 70.59 27.2 70.90 27.3 71.22 27.4 71.53 27.5 71.84 28 72.14 28.1 72.45 28.2 72.76 28.3 73.06 28.4 73.36 28.5 73.66 29 73.96 29.1 74.26 29.2 74.55 29.3 74.85 29.4 75.14 29.5 75.43 30 75.72 30.1 76.01 30.2 76.30 30.3 76.59 30.4 76.87 30.5 77.16 31 77.44 31.1 77.72 31.2 78.00 31.3 78.27 31.4 78.55 31.5 78.82 32 79.10 32.1 79.37 32.2 79.64 32.3 79.91 32.4 80.17 32.5 80.44 33 80.70 33.1 80.97 33.2 81.23 33.3 81.49 33.4 81.74 33.5 82.00 34 82.26 34.1 82.51 34.2 82.76 34.3 83.01 34.4 83.26 34.5 83.51 35 83.76 35.1 84.00 35.2 84.25 35.3 84.49 35.4 84.73 35.5 84.97 36 85.21 36.1 85.45 36.2 85.68 36.3 85.91 36.4 86.15 36.5 86.38 37 86.61 37.1 86.83 37.2 87.06 37.3 87.29 37.4 87.51 37.5 87.73 38 87.95 38.1 88.17 38.2 88.39 38.3 88.60 38.4 88.82 38.5 89.03 39 89.24 39.1 89.45 39.2 89.66 39.3 89.87 39.4 90.08 39.5 90.28 40 90.48 40.1 90.68 40.2 90.88 40.3 91.08 40.4 91.28 40.5 91.48 41 91.67 41.1 91.86 41.2 92.06 41.3 92.24 41.4 92.43 41.5 92.62 42 92.81 42.1 92.99 42.2 93.17 42.3 93.35 42.4 93.53 42.5 93.71 43 93.89 43.1 94.06 43.2 94.24 43.3 94.41 43.4 94.58 43.5 94.75 44 94.92 44.1 95.09 44.2 95.25 44.3 95.41 44.4 95.58 44.5 95.74 45 95.90 45.1 96.05 45.2 96.21 45.3 96.37 45.4 96.52 45.5 96.67 46 96.82 46.1 96.97 46.2 97.12 46.3 97.27 46.4 97.41 46.5 97.55 47 97.70 47.1 97.84 47.2 97.97 47.3 98.11 47.4 98.25 47.5 98.38 48 98.52 48.1 98.65 48.2 98.78 48.3 98.91 48.4 99.03 48.5 99.16 49 99.28 49.1 99.41 49.2 99.53 49.3 99.65 49.4 99.77 49.5 99.88 50 100.0\n\nJayadevan's system (aka VJD method)[]\n\nFor any interruption, there are tables which give the revised target based on the resources left at the time of any interruption. Unlike most other methods the VJD tables take account of the number of wickets a team had left at the point of interruption. The tables also take account of the number of overs for which fielding restrictions apply.\n\nA new method for the computation of target scores in interrupted, limited-over cricket matches: https://web.archive.org/web/20230226031449/https://jayadevan.yolasite.com/resources/Firstarticle.pdf\n\nan improved system for the computation of target scores in interrupted limited over cricket matches adding variations in scoring range as another parameter: https://jayadevan.yolasite.com/resources/secondarticle.pdf\n\nExample: http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/85/85164.html\n\nKleiber method[]\n\nThis method is designed for T20 cricket, and its construction is based on the analogy between a team's run-scoring propensity and the metabolism rate in animals. The latter is governed by Kleiber's three-quarter power law, which states that the metabolic rate (B) varies with the mass (M) as B ∼ M^(3/4). If the resources of a team, which consist of the overs remaining and wickets in hand, are considered analogous to the mass, then the run-scoring ability of the team can be regarded as the analogue of the metabolism rate. Motivated by this analogy, we define the utilisable resource percentage of a team (on which the run-scoring depends on) as:\n\n[ ( O 20 ) ( 1 − e W − 10 W + 1 ) ] 3 4 {\\displaystyle [(\\frac{O}{20})(1-e^{\\frac{W-10}{W+1}})]^\\frac{3}{4}}\n\nwhere O are the number of overs remaining and W are the number of wickets lost at the stage of the innings when the calculations are carried out.\n\nThis specific construction of the resource percentage formula is primarily driven by the requirement that the resources must diminish as the innings progresses and more wickets are lost. This model does a reasonable job of mimicking the progression of a typical T20 innings, thereby providing the confidence to employ it as a rain rule. It must also be noted that unlike the DLS and VJD methods, this model does not employ data from past matches in its construction, which is a unique aspect of the proposed model.\n\nThe determination of revised targets in interrupted games is simple and requires only the calculations of the resources of the two teams. If B1 is the resources utilised by Team1 in scoring S runs and B2 is the resurces available for Team2, then the par score (to tie the match) is simply S*B2/B1 and the target is one added to the par score (both rounded off to the nearest integer). The effective resources for the teams are calculated by subtracting the resources lost, such as those due to multiple interruptions in either innings, from the resources available at the start. Since the Kleiber mathematical rule forms the basis of the resource calculations, the target obtained is referred to as the Kleiber target and the rain rule as the Kleiber rain rule.\n\nT20 Overs remaining 0 wickets lost 1 wicket lost 2 wickets lost 3 wickets lost 4 wickets lost 5 wickets lost 6 wickets lost 7 wickets lost 8 wickets lost 9 wickets lost 20 100.00 99.17 94.75 86.66 76.43 65.21 53.59 41.82 29.83 17.13 19.5 99.37 98.55 94.15 86.12 75.96 64.80 53.26 41.56 29.64 17.03 19.4 98.75 97.93 93.56 85.58 75.48 64.39 52.92 41.29 29.45 16.92 19.3 98.12 97.30 92.96 85.03 75.00 63.98 52.58 41.03 29.26 16.81 19.2 97.49 96.68 92.37 84.49 74.51 63.57 52.25 40.77 29.08 16.70 19.1 96.86 96.05 91.77 83.94 74.03 63.16 51.91 40.51 28.89 16.60 19 96.23 95.43 91.17 83.39 73.55 62.74 51.57 40.24 28.70 16.49 18.5 95.59 94.80 90.57 82.84 73.06 62.33 51.23 39.98 28.51 16.38 18.4 94.96 94.17 89.97 82.29 72.58 61.92 50.89 39.71 28.32 16.27 18.3 94.32 93.54 89.36 81.74 72.09 61.50 50.55 39.44 28.13 16.16 18.2 93.68 92.90 88.76 81.19 71.60 61.09 50.21 39.18 27.94 16.05 18.1 93.04 92.27 88.15 80.63 71.12 60.67 49.86 38.91 27.75 15.94 18 92.40 91.63 87.55 80.08 70.63 60.25 49.52 38.64 27.56 15.83\n\nLancashire League adjusted target[]\n\nThe adjusted target for team2 is calculated by taking the number of overs by first computing the run rate of team1 from runs scored divided by overs received (a part over is counted as a full one). If all out, then full allocation used for overs. Round the figure to two decimal places. 75% of this runs per over is then computed. The runs adjustment is then calculated from the adjusted runs per over multiplied by the number of overs lost. The target is the team1 total minus the runs adjustment, then truncate, then add 1.\n\nMaidens ignored run rate[]\n\nCompare the runs per over of team1's complete innings against that of team2 for the number of overs they received but ignoring maiden overs.\n\nExample: http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/47/47948.html\n\nPlay was halted when Pakistan had scored 155/6 from 43.5 overs of which 6 were maidens (4.096 runs per over) against West Indies 196/7 from 50 overs of which 7 were maidens (4.558 runs per over).\n\nBirmingham League method: West Indies run rate is 3.92 per over. 6.1 overs are lost. Pakistan's required run rate is (100 + ((6 + 1/6) x 1.2)) x 3.92 ÷ 100 = 107.4 x 3.92 ÷ 100 = 4.21 . Then 4.21 x (43 + 5/6) = 185 (rounded up).\n\nDLS method: At 43.5 overs, the par score is 162.\n\nD/L method: West Indies' resources = 100%. Resources (6.1 overs remaining, 6 wickets lost) = 16.7%. This was lost, so Pakistan's resources = 100 - 16.7 = 83.3%. Target for Pakistan = 196 x 83.3 / 100 = 164 (rounded up).\n\nICC method: 196 x 94.95 / 100 = 186.102 = 187 (rounded up).\n\nICC method (modified): 196 x 94.75 / 100 = 185.71 = 186 (rounded up).\n\nLancashire League adjusted target: West Indies scored 3.92 runs per over. 75% of this equals 2.94. Pakistan lost 6.1 overs. 2.94 * (6 + 1/6) = 18.13. Target = 196 + 1 - 18.13 = 178 (rounded down).\n\nRun rate: Pakistan scored 3.54 runs per over. West Indies scored 3.92 runs per over.\n\nVJD method: At 43.5 overs, the par score is 160.\n\nUnnamed method #1: West Indies' run rate is 3.92 per over. Target = 3.92 x (43 + 5/6) + (6 + 1/6) = 177 (rounded down).\n\nParabola (or norm – normal performance) method[]\n\nThe revised target for team2 is based on a parabolic equation based on the number of overs and team1's score (called the normal method as the equation was intended to simulate the norm in a particular situation).\n\nExample: http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/65/65621.html\n\nA sandstorm during the interval reduced the number of overs for India to 46 in reply to Australia's 284/7 in 50 overs. The parabola equation has the factor for a reduction to 46 overs to be 96.7% so the target was adjusted to 276.\n\nBirmingham League method: Australia's run rate is 5.68 per over. 4 overs are lost. India's required run rate is (100 + (4 x 1.2)) x 5.68 ÷ 100 = 104.8 x 5.68 ÷ 100 = 5.95. Then 5.95 x 46 = 274 (rounded up).\n\nDLS method: The target for India in 46 overs is 272.\n\nD/L method: Australia's resources = 100%. Resources (46 overs remaining, 0 wickets lost) = 96.1%.
