        "text": "1.6 to Wells, Caught! Length ball on leg stump, it just stopped in the wicket a fraction, Wells tried to turn to leg, got a leading edge that ballooned to wide mid off and Pomersbach moved forward to take a comfortable catch. 10/1\n\n5.2 to Cowan, Caught! Superb by Beaton. It was a half volley, Cowan opened the hip lofted a drive to cover, Beaton reached up with the right hand it ricocheted onto his shoulder, floated up again and Beaton held on as he fell to ground. Great composure. 39/2\n\n3.1 to Swart, LBW! Swart might be unlucky here. Swart shuffled across to length ball and was hit in front but Faulkner isn't swinging the ball and it pitched outside leg! Not a great decision that. 14/2\n\n13.2 to North, Caught! Krejza hangs onto this. North gets another slower ball, swungs hard and mistimes it high to long on, Krejza with his heart in his mouth swallowed the chance 79/5\n\n8.3 to Pomersbach, Bowled him! Pomersbach got down on one knee and tried to heave this over midwicket, it slid on the with arm, went through the gate, and clean bowled him! Wicket claimed thanks to preesure. 37/4"
