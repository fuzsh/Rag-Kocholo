A reply being received. a\n\npublic meeting was convened, and Mr.\n\nJohn Davies, the proprietor of the \"Ho\n\n\"ba.rt Town Mercury,\" was requested to\n\n.proceedl to 1etlbourne to effeect the ne\n\ncessary arriatgemients for a game to be\n\nlilayed in Hobart. 'Mr. Davies proceeded\n\n'to lIelbourne, and the \"Argus\" a few\n\ndays aftert stated:-\"Our Tasmanian\n\nreaders will be glad to learn that Mr.\n\n'Davies, of the 'Hlobart Town Mercury,'\n\nhas succeedtld in effecting an arrange\n\nment with Messrs. Spiers and Pond, for\n\na visit of the All-England Eleven to\n\nTasmania.\" The Englishmen arrived cc\n\ndLaunceston fromt Melbourne by the\n\nstetuner Royal Shepherd on 'WVednesday,\n\nvFebruary '11, 1602.\n\nThe itatch against 22 of Tasmania\n\nwas played on February 21, 22, and 24.\n\nThe Tasuanian team consisted of the\n\n'following players:--'. -Westbrook, l)Du\n\nmaresq, Walker, Perry, Spicer, Brooks,\n\nStill, Tabart, T. Whitesides, Taylor, Cox,\n\n:i. Watson, Mlace, Boon, Patterson, Side.\n\nbottom, Dargarville, H. Lette, Marsha.ll,\n\nJamitson, B. IWatson, and Orford. Th'e\n\n'English team consisted of lddison, E.\n\nStephenson, Priflith, Caffyn, H. 1. Ste-.\n\nphentson .(captain), ,Hearne, Bennett,\n\nSewell, Wells, Mfortlock, and Mudie. Tilhe\n\nEnglishmen won by four wickets, the\n\nscores reading:---Tasmania, 107 and 141;\n\nEnglandd.17-6 and 7'5 for six wickets.\n\nEven in those days our Ibowlers had some\n\nidea of \"off\" theory-very much \"off\"\n\nus lhere were no fewer than 20.. wides\n\nsent down-'1 in the first and 4 in the\n\nsecond innings. In the first innings of\n\nIEngland, E. 'tophenson top-scored with\n\n00, and in the second Griflith was high.\n\nest with 36. Taobart, in the first innings\n\nof Tasmania, was the leading rungetter\n\nwith '15, and in the second innings T.\n\n'Whitesides made- 60 before he .was\n\nbowled by II. I. Stephenson. The ac\n\ncount of 'Tasmania's second innings stat\n\ned that \"Tabart and dumaresq maide\n\nvery fair scores, but it was owing to\n\nthe cool and cautious play of W'Whitesides\n\nthat the score of the Twenty-two for\n\nithe second innings presented such a re\n\nspectable number. His - batting and de\n\nfence were splendid. Caffyn,' lddison,\n\ntand Bennett in vain tried to strike his\n\nwicket, and it ivas not until he had kept\n\nhis post four hours that he at last suc\n\ncutembed to a terrific ball from H. -1.\n\nStephenson. As lie left the wicket le\n\nwas loudly cheered by his fellow-cricket\n\ners and the spectators. The All-Engliind\n\nEleven, with chiralric feeling, gave most\n\n'unnmistakable demnonstrations of (their\n\nadmiration of his play. To this Tasma\n\nnian plater belongs the proud distinc\n\ntion of having made the highest score\n\neffected by any colonial player in any\n\nof the matches which have as yet been\n\nphsyed with the All-England Eleven.\"\n\nWhitesides hit three 4's, one 3. seven 2's,\n\nand twenty-one singles.\n\nIn the bowvling department the work\n\nfor Tasmania was chiefly done in the\n\n'first innings by Still, one for 37 (eight\n\n-wides); Spicer, five for 60 (three wides);\n\nand the captain, W. V. . Walker, one for\n\n43. In the second innings Spicer, three\n\nfor 30 (four wides), and 'Walker, three\n\nfor 30, were the successful Tasmanian\n\nbowlers. England's bowlers in the first\n\ninnings were Caffyn (round arm), five\n\nfor 37. and Iddison (slow underhand),\n\neight for 32. In the second innings Caf\n\ndyn took three for 39; Iddison,. eleven\n\nfor 63; Bennett, one for 13; Sewell, one\n\nfor 13 ;and H..I. Stephenson, one for 2,\n\nMr. T.

Butler were thie only ones who\n\ngot into double figures in the first ini.\n\nnitgs. Butler played free and good cric.\n\nket for 1.

The home players\n\nsncored 105 and 198. and the English\n\nrepresentotives 308 and 25 for two wic\n\nkets. In this matochl G. F.

Kendall, who sent down 200 balls for\n\n21 maideis,- 70 runs, 7 wickets; his vie\n\ntims being..Grace, Abel; Maurice Read,\n\nRadcliffe, Bean, Attewell. and Sharp.' It\n\nwas in this innings that John Watt\n\nbowled his \"donkey-drops\" to Geeo. Loh\n\nmann, who deliberately played the ball\n\nwith his 'pads, but eventually the re\n\nsourceful WVitt sent down one 'that broke\n\nround Lohmann's legs, and knocked down\n\nthe middle stump. Some people. .who\n\nsaw this mnatch have. been heard to say\n\nthat Stoddart . hit Watt out of the\n\nground for six (ine fact, ,the bowler him\n\nseclf thinks this was 'thile case), but the\n\nrecords of the play show that Stoddart\n\nmade \"the finest hit of the match, driv\n\ning Watt right over the boundary rail\n\nat the northern end for five, following\n\nit up with another of a similar descrip\n\ntion to leg in the next over.\" ' Watt\n\nbowled 150 balls for seven maidensi; 63\n\nruns, 2 wickets, Lolnnann and Peel being\n\nhis victims. The Tasmainians made a\n\npoor display in their first innings, scoring\n\nonly 76' off the blt, and with 10 sun\n\ndries, the total was 85. W. Ii. Savigny\n\nwas the highest scorer, with 15, the other\n\ndoubles being J. Bingham and J. Watt,\n\nwhib each made 10. Lolimann had quite\n\na feast of wickets, taking twelve for 50,\n\nthe other five going to e4ittevell at an\n\nexpense of 25 runs. The second batting?\n\nessay of our representgtives showed\n\nsome improvement, 137 being on the\n\nboard when the last wicket fell, which\n\ngave the victory to the Englishmen by\n\nan innings and 21 runs. J. H. Savigny\n\nled the way with 35; and was closely fol\n\nlowed by K. E.. Biit wi th 31. Gee.\n\nVautia got 190; and 'C:'W. Butler con\n\ntributed a dozen. Lohmann put up an\n\nother remarkable bdwling record in tak\n\ning thirteen wickets for 53 runs. Atte\n\nwell obtained three for 38, and Sharpe\n\none dor 21. Johnnie 'Briggs (whose clever\n\ncatching of Burn is not likely to be for\n\ngotten) also bowled, but failed to secure\n\na wicket. A testimonial of five guineas\n\neas made to Tom Kendlall for his line\n\nbowling against the Engolishmen.\n\nWhen Lofd Shleffield's team met Nor\n\nthern Tasmansia at Launceston on 7darch\n\n10, 11, and 12 the hlome side were as\n\nsisted by irve Southelcrners, namely G.\n\nGatehouse, C.

Most of the wickets were\n\nsec'red by IH. (\"Blundell'') Wilson, six\n\nfor 109. Windsor took one for 78, Ken\n\ndall one for 86, N. Reeock two for 45, and\n\nW. LI. Sidebottom one for125. The Tas\n\nmanians niade 131 (W. L. Sidhbottom 33,\n\nGeo. ITH. Bailey 25, G, Vautin 22, O. Doug\n\nlas 10, N. Rock 10), and in the follo---on\n\nsmade 135 feor six wickets (G. Vautin 38,\n\nHII.

Ford (nine for\n\n56) and 'Brockwell (four for 50).\n\nStoddart's 1S9 team, like some of ito\n\npredecessors, halted at Iaunceston for\n\na match before fulfilling their IIobart\n\nenggeomments. They played at the\n\nnortliern capital on March 9, II, and 12,\n\nand the umatchc 'was left ursfinished. The\n\nnorthern 18 scored 178 (N. I. West\n\nbrook 5), W. ll.Saevigny 22, J.

T.EAM.-1904.\n\nThere was an interval of nine years\n\n,before another English teami visited Ta.s\n\nmania, namnely, the Marylebone U.C.\n\nteam, c.ptained by P. F. WYarner. They\n\n,played,. for the first time on record, an\n\neloven of Tasnmania at Hobart on Janu\n\nary 25 and 26, 1904. The islanders\n\ngained a lead on the first innings by six\n\nruns, scoring 101 against 185. In their\n\nsecond innings the -Englishmen dealt\n\nrather severely with the bowling, Bosan\n\nquet, who made 124 not out, being con\n\ntemptuous in his treatment of it, hit\n\nting four fives and eighteen fours. Tas\n\nmania lost one wicket for 63 runs in\n\ntheir second essay, and the maitch was\n\ndrawn. The Englishmen closed at 354\n\nfor four wickets. Lilley 35, R. E. Fos\n\nter 43 and 23, Tyldesley 4 and 85, Knight\n\n10 and 45 not out, Bosanquet 35 and\n\n124 not out, Relf 24, Wrner 20- and\n\n(14, did the scoring for England. R.\n\n-1lawson 29 aInd 37 not out, O. Douglas\n\n38, N. Dodds 24 and 2 not out, 0. ;J.\n\nEady 16, K. Burn 23 not out and 24, D.\n\nR. Smith 113, and D. Paton 18, were the\n\nchief scorers for Tasmania. Arnold\n\nfour fo ,44, Fielder one for .18, Relf one\n\nfor 20, Bosanquet one for 55, and Rhodes\n\ntivo for 52, did the bowling for England.\n\nThe regular bowlers were not tried in\n\nTasmania's second innings. Bady (three\n\nfor 40 and none for 80), Smith (three\n\nfor 42 and one for 97), Windsor (three\n\nfor 6S and three for 00), were the suc\n\ncessful trundlers for Tasnlania. At the\n\nconclusion of the matelh the English cap\n\ntain ('Mr. P. F. 'Warner) spoke in high\n\npraise of the umpiring, iand, personally\n\naddres.ing the two honorary officials\n\n(,Messr.. John VWatt and Charles 'tMAl:\n\nlen), said \"lie wished the utitpiring\n\nthroughout Australia had been as good\n\nas, it had been at Hobart.\" The two\n\nolleials, it unmay be added, are amongst\n\nthe finest judges of the. game to be\n\nfound in Australia.\n\nThe retprn inatch played at Launces\n\nton by Warner's team will be ever\n\nmemoraole in the annals of cricket in\n\nTasmania. It is closely associated with\n\nthe names of J.41. Savigny and 0. Doug\n\nlas. In their first innings the Tasma\n\nnians were dismissed for 141, Dodds\n\nplaying fine, free cricket for 48. Wind\n\nsor batted nicely for 33, and there was\n\nnothing wrong with N. i. Westlbrook's\n\nscore of 26. Hirst, five for 37; 'Fielder,\n\nthree for 44; and Arnold, two for 10,\n\ntook the wickets for the visitors. Thei\n\nEnglishmen's first innings total of 353\n\nincluded a fine 134 by Hayward. Hlirs,\n\ngot 51, Rhodes 39, Lilley 37 not out,\n\n1\"iclder 23, and Strudwick 21. Smith,\n\nfour for 'H11; Windsor, four for 106, and\n\nAddison, one for, 04;, were tlhe-successful\n\nTasmanian trundlers. In their second\n\nessay with the bat the Tasmanians ut\n\nterly surprised the Enoglishmen by scor\n\ning 259 for three wickets. J. H. Sav\n\nigny; (who did not score in the, first\n\ninnings). made 464 not out, and 0. Doug\n\nlas (whose first innings score was only\n\na single) totted up 59. Writing of the\n\nTasmanian tbur, and of this match in\n\nparticular, P. F. WÃ½Vrner, in his book,\n\n\"How we Recovered the Ashes,\" says:\n\n\"Hayward played a superb innings of\n\n134, but the most noteworthy batting\n\nwas by Savigny, 'whose 51i4 not out was,\n\nexcept for a comparatively easy chance\n\nto Lilley at mid-off, quite faultless. He\n\nhad strokes all round the wicket, being\n\nespecially strong in the off drive, and he\n\nwatched the ball closely. Hirst, -who\n\nuhad a good bowl at him, told me lie was\n\na really high-class batsman. Our long\n\nlead on the first .innings gave hopes of\n\na victory, but Savigny and 'Douglas quite\n\nupset all our calculations by putting on\n\n202 for the dirst wicket--a feat which\n\nnot even that famdus pair, Trumper and\n\nDuff. dpproached. iDouglas,' a left-hand-.\n\ned batsman, with all the virtues of a\n\nScotton or a Barlow, was batting over\n\nfour hours. LHis defence was magnilf\n\ncent, but lie entirely ignored the slow\n\nlong-lop. (His ltience was invaluable,\n\nIbut it was, to say the least of it, mono\n\ntonous . . Tasnmania can boast of\n\nmany good 'cricketers, and the form\n\nshown in the two miatches we played was\n\na great deal better than' we had been\n\nled to expect. Orieketers like Windsor,\n\nSavigny, Dodds, Hlwson, and Douglas\n\nwould strengthen almost any eleven.\n\n-Most enjoyable in every 'way was our\n\nstay in the lovely island,, and future\n\nteams to Australia should take care to\n\ninclude Tasmania in their programme.\""
