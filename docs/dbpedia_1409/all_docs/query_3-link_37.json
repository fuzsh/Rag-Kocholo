        "text": "Nathan Lyon finally secured his 400th Test wicket after almost two years stuck in the nervous 390s, with the historic moment sparking an England collapse of 8-74 on Saturday.\n\nAustralia went on to secure a 1-0 series lead after chasing down the required 20 runs for the loss of just one wicket.\n\nWatch England’s 8-74 collapse in the video above\n\nKnow the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today\n\nLyon had gone wicketless through 33 overs across the first three days of the first Ashes Test at the Gabba.\n\nBut on Saturday morning he had Dawid Malan, who admitted he should have been out to Lyon on Friday, caught by Marnus Labuschagne at bat pad for 82 runs.\n\nLyon sits third for Australian bowlers behind Shane Warne (708) and Glenn McGrath (563) and is just the 17th man in Test cricket to crack 400 wickets.\n\n“What a magnificent personal milestone that is,” Ricky Ponting said on Channel 7.\n\nLyon’s quest proved a talking point throughout 2020-21, when Australia failed to bowl India out at the SCG and Gabba.\n\nThe tweaker was stuck on 399 wickets after his 100th Test proved unforgettable for all the wrong reasons, with India storming to a series victory in Brisbane in January.\n\nA postponed Test tour of South Africa meant Australia were forced to wait almost 11 months for a chance to don the baggy green again.\n\nLyon admitted last month the milestone had been on his mind for a “fair amount of time”.\n\nThe 34-year-old has charted a remarkable path to the top of world cricket, famously working as a curator in Adelaide when given a chance to shine in Australia’s domestic Twenty20 competition at the start of 2011.\n\nLater that year, Lyon made his Test debut in Sri Lanka.\n\nLyon’s big wicket sparks collapse\n\nMalan’s dismissal before he could reach his century brought Ben Stokes to the crease, with England still in a reasonable position at 3-223 despite trailing by 55 runs.\n\nYet the tide suddenly turned, perhaps for good, when England skipper Joe Root missed out on his own ton just moments later.\n\nThe star batsman surpassed his previous best Test score on Australian soil and promptly edged a Cameron Green delivery to wicketkeeper Alex Carey to be out for 89.\n\n“That’s a beautiful delivery,” Ponting said.\n\n“This is just a classical outswinger, just enough movement. Root hasn’t missed the middle of the bat - there it goes, just swings a fraction.\n\n“Root, lured into the shot, a little feather. Up go the Aussies. Things can change very quickly in these Test matches.”\n\nLyon struck again with the old ball, due to be changed in less than three overs’ time, when Ollie Pope cut the ball to Steve Smith at first slip.\n\n“We were debating whether it was weighing on his mind,” former Australian bowler Damien Fleming said.\n\n“The way he’s bowled since he’s got his 400th wicket, it definitely was.”\n\nAs England lost their last eight wickets for 74 runs, Lyon (4-91) led the way for Australia from Green (2-23) and Pat Cummins (2-51).\n\nInjury fears for Josh Hazlewood (1-32) were officially put to rest when the Australian quick took the new ball and chimed in with the wicket of Jos Buttler.\n\nHe had only bowled eight overs on Friday and none in the final session during England’s rearguard.\n\nHazelwood bowled six overs straight on Saturday morning in a good sign ahead of the second Test in Adelaide starting on Thursday.\n\n- with AAP"
