        "text": "C. L. BADCOCK MAKES BRILLIANT\n\nCENTURY, CREATING NEW RECORDS.\n\nAustralians Bowling Not Particularly\n\nImpressive : Fleetwood-Smith\n\nMost Successful.\n\nLAUNCESTON, Saturday.\n\nTHE first century against thc 1934 Australian Test Eleven was\n\nscored by Tasmania's champion batsman C. L. Badcock on the\n\nLaunceston Cricket Ground this afternoon, when the Australians\n\nmet a State side. Badcock set the seal to the high opinion\n\nwhich has been held of him for some seasons.\n\nTASMANIA, winning the toss and batting on a perfect wicket, in\n\noppressively hot weather, occupied thc crease all day to com\n\npile 336 for nine wickets, offering unexpected resistance to the\n\nTest men.\n\nTHE Australian team was without Bromley, Bradman, Ponsford,\n\nand O'Reilly.\n\n'flMIE Australians found it hurd to dis\n\nlodge Bndcock. Tho attack of\n\nthu tourists, which vus mostly perform-\n\ned by Wall, Elcctwood-Smith, Grim-\n\nmett and Darling, was not particularly\n\nimpressive, and nono of the bowlers got\n\nmuch help from tho' splendid wicket.\n\nElootwood-.Sinith secured tho best fig-\n\nures. Ho came in for torrid treatment\n\nat tho hand» of Hornsby, whoso 41 in\n\n50 minutes was tho titbit of tho day.\n\nTho nttendnnco and takings were a\n\nrecord for any ono day of a cricket\n\nmatch in Launceston. A crowd of 4422\n\npersons paid for admission, tho gato\n\ntakings amounting to £334/12/. The\n\nprevious record was that of tho first\n\nday of tho match between tho English\n\nEleven and Tasmania in 1929. On that\n\noccasion ilOlfi persons paid for admis-\n\nsion, and tho gato takings woro\n\n£3:14/10/3. Many of tho men doffed\n\ntheir coats, an unusual occurrenco in\n\nLaunceston in March. Tho wicket was\n\nthe finest that has been prepared in\n\nLaunceston, being fast und true. The\n\ncurutor (Mr. A. Hill) came in for\n\nmuch praise. Tho wicket shows no\n\nsigns nf cutting up. Ebcling was made\n\n12th man of tho Australian side, and\n\nO'licitly stood down.\n\nNEW RECORDS.\n\nliushforth, winning tim toss, lind no\n\nliositntiou in taking udvantago of thc\n\nprivilege. When Badcock had scored\n\n39 he established a new record State\n\naggregate, eclipsing his record of inoti\n\nlast season, mid when he compiled his\n\ncentury, his fourth in first-class cricket\n\nthis season, he beeamo thc first Tas-\n\nmanian to score a century against a\n\ntouring Australian side, thc next best\n\nscore being 93 by L. .T. Nash in Ho-\n\nbart last year.\n\nTho second-wicket partnership\n\nbetween Badcock and Ferrall,\n\nwhich resulted in 108, is also tho\n\nbest stand made for the second\n\nwicket by Tasmania against Aus-\n\ntralia.\n\nBadcock has scored centuries in bet-\n\nter style, but his innings to-duy was\n\nchanccless, and thc outstanding feature\n\nwas his wonderful defence. Tho bright-\n\nest hand of tho day was Morrisby's.\n\nHe opened with Badcock. He was\n\nconfident from thc start, and made his\n\nwristy off shots in grand style, his 44\n\nbein!; compiled in len minutes under\n\nthe flour.\n\nA GRUELLING DAY.\n\nThe Australians had a gruelling day\n\nin the field, Wall plugging away-hero-\n\nically to send down 15 overs, lie was\n\na tired man at the conclusion of play.\n\nOrinimett nighted his deliveries well,\n\nhutj iii conjunction with Fleetwood\n\nSmith, was rather relished by Morrisby,\n\nwho is partial to slow bowling. Barnett\n\ngave a fine display of fielding. . His\n\nanticipation, judgment and fleetness of\n\nfoot saved many boundary hits.\n\nTho Australian fielding 'was 'sound\n\nwithout being brilliant, all tho chances\n\nmissed being very hard ones. The\n\njnntch will bo continued at noon on\n\nMonday, and tho State sido for thc\n\nmutch at Hobart will bo selected on\n\nMonday evening.\n\nApart from the substitution of\n\nGreen for Rushforth, who will bo un-\n\navailable it is expected thnt thcro will\n\nbo little alteration to the team which is\n\nplaying in Launceston.\n\nTHE TEAMS.\n\nAustralia.\n\nW. M. Woodfull C. V. Grimmett\n\n(capt.) A. F. Kippax\n\nW. A, Brown T. W. AVnll\n\nA. F. Copperfield B. A. Barnett\n\nS. .T. M' Cabo W. A; Oldfield\n\nh. S. Darling H. I. Eliding\n\nL. 0'B\" Fleet- (12th)\n\n? wood-Smith\n\nTasmania.\n\nA. W. Rushforth lt. Morrisby\n\n(capt.) M. J. Walsh\n\nG. James (v.c.) J. Bothwell\n\nC. N. Parry A. Pearsall\n\nC. L. Badcock C. Jeffrey\n\nlt. V. Thomas G. Lothborg\n\nH. A. Ferrall (12th)\n\nThe Play Described.\n\nBadcock took striko to tko bowling of\n\nWall at 12.5 p.m., and an uppish shot,\n\ngavo him a single. Darling took up\n\ntho attack from tho southern end, scud-\n\ning down a maiden.\n\nMorrisby turned Wall nontly round\n\nto leg for two to open his account.\n\nWall loft tho Held after bowling two\n\novers to hnvo his boots attended to.\n\nFlcctwood-Smith took Wall's place at\n\ntho northern end, and both batsmen\n\nscored with leg glances. Tho Tas-\n\nmanians were showing n wholcsomo re-\n\nspect for tho fielding of tho Austral-\n\nians, however, and wcro subject to a\n\nlittle barracking for their caption.\n\nBadcock was applauded for prettily\n\nsquaro-cutting Darline for two, iinji\n\nthen Morrisby, who was playing enter-\n\nprising cricket, hooked Flcctwood\n\nSmith to tho fenco.\n\nThere was npplouso when Grimmett\n\nrelieved Darling at tho southern end,\n\nand Morrisby welcomed him by jump-\n\ning into his third delivery and smash-\n\ning it through tho covers to tho chains.\n\nMorrisby reached 21 in 25 minutes with\n\na well-run threo for a back-cut. Wall\n\nthen returned to tho field.\n\nMorrisby continued to play cntortnin\n\ninir and confident cricket, square-ent\n\ntig Flcctwood-Smith for two and then\n\nstraight-driving him to tho long boun-\n\ndary. Badcock lacked tho sureness of\n\nhis partner.\n\nFAST SCORING-.\n\nTho first 30 minutos produced 35\n\nruns. Morrisby darted down tho\n\nwicket to covcr-drivo Grimmett, the\n\nstroke giving his his fourth four. Bad-\n\ncock had not .Vet reached, double fig-\n\nures, but a strcakisli snick gave him\n\ndouble figures in 35 minutes. Morrisby\n\nran to -10 with a straight drive to thc\n\nlong-on fence and a- pull\" to the square\n\nleg boundary olï Flcctwood-Smith,\n\nbringing up 50> in 3(i minutes.\n\nWall relieved Flcctwood-Smith at thc\n\nnorthern end. Badcock scored hi» first\n\nfour when he hooked a high-kicking de-\n\nlivery to the s(|iiare-leg fence, almost\n\nscoring a six. Grinning broadly, Wall\n\nagain left the field, holding thc heel of\n\none of his boots' in his hand.\n\nDarling went on at the northern end,\n\nand Badcock twice square-cut him to tho\n\nfence. Morrisby trbid to turn his fifth\n\ndelivery to leg,' but thc ball skipped\n\nin ami bowled him. Ile had batted for\n\n50 in'nntcs for his 44, and hit seven\n\nfours.\n\n.Fe mi ll .joined Badcock, who was\n\nthen 33, and punched the last ball of\n\nIhn over to the fence. Badcock\n\nulaniuicd an over-pitched delivory from I\n\nGrimmett to (lio lop; boundary, und\n\nneut tho noxt bull through tho covers\n\nto tho fence.\n\nBABCOCK'S \"LIFE.\"\n\nAfter play had been in progress\n\nfor au hour 05 runs,were on the\n\nboard. Ferrall, showing a par-\n\ntiality for Darling, brought up 100\n\nin lil minutes by cover-driving a\n\nshorter-pitched ball to tho chums. ¡\n\nBadcock reached 50 in fifi minutes I\n\nby sweeping an over-pitched ball\n\nfrom Grimmett ' to the square-leg\n\nfence.\n\nFlcctwood-Smith went on again at\n\ntho northern end nt 112. His length\n\nwas better than Grimmett's, Badcock\n\ntreated him with respect.\n\nAn unfortunate misunderstanding be-\n\ntween Fcrrull and Badcock nearly cost\n\nTasmania a, wicket. Badcock turned\n\none near Woodfull at short leg and\n\nstarted to run. The batsmen changed\n\ntheir minds ut mid-wicket, hesitated,\n\nand Badcock scampered buck to his\n\ncrease just in time.\n\nThe »all was returned wide to Old-\n\nfield, and the keeper had a back-throw\n\nat tho wicket, but missed.\n\nFerrall had a narrow escape off tho\n\nsecond last ball from Fleetwood-Smith\n\nbefore tho udjournnicnt. Ho snicked\n\nit, und Oldfield went for a catch, but\n\ncould .not reach it, and Chippcrfield, at\n\nfirst slip, dropped it.\n\nBADCOCK APPLAUDED.\n\nTho crowd increased considerably\n\nlifter lunch, and Badcock received well\n\nnieritcd applause for delightful\n\nsquare cut off Grimmett to the fence,\n\nbut the young bntsmnn snicked ono\n\ndangerously close to M'Cabe in the\n\nslips in tho next over. Ferrall, us-\n\ning his feet nicely, picked a ball from\n\nWall from off his toes and sent it to\n\nthe square-leg fence.\n\nFerrall was fruitlessly trying to\n\nhook some rather high deliveries from |\n\nWall, and narrowly escaped being\n\nbowled on ono occasion. Forrnll, who\n\nhad been inclined to flick at Wall's\n\nflyiug deliveries on the off, snicked\n\none hurd to Darling at second slip, and\n\ntho fieldsman, after juggling with tho\n\nball, dropped a vcrj- hard catch.\n\nBadcock reached 7S and brought up\n\n150 in 118 minutes with another square\n\ncut off Dulling. Grimmett rapped\n\nBadcock's pads twice in one over, and\n\nthere was an appeal for lbw each time,\n\nbut each was disallowed by Umpiru\n\nKnight.\n\n? A FINE PARTNERSHIP. .\n\nBadcock punctuated thc appeals with\n\na square cut to tho fence. Ferrall ran\n\nto 37 with successive fours off Fleet\n\nwood'Smith, though ho had previously\n\nbeen uncomfortable against thc slow\n\nbowlr^ When Ferrall drove Flcet\n\nivood-Smith powerfully through tho\n\ncovors he made thc partnership with\n\nBadcock worth 100 in SI minutes. .\n\nThe partnership had realised 108\n\nwhen Pcrrall was bowled by Grim-\n\nmett by a ball which came in\n\nsharply from the off and kept very\n\nlow. He had batted for 92 min-\n\nutos for his 47, including six\n\nfours. His stand had beon invalu-\n\nable to Tasmania.\n\nBadcock was 93 when he was joined\n\nby Thomas. Thomas opened his ac-\n\ncount by straight-driving Grimmett to\n\nthc fence. Ile turned the next ball\n\nto tho square-log fence. Ho roached\n\n12 in quick time, lind brought up 200\n\nin 150 minutos when it run was taken\n\nfor nn overthrow. Tint Just- 50 had\n\nbeen scored in 32 minutes.\n\nBABCOCK REACHES CENTURY. |\n\nBallcock roached 00 with a two oft\n\nFleotwood-Smith and a sweeping shot\n\nto tho leg sido gavo tho Tasmanian\n\nchampion his century, which was scor-\n\ned in 152 minutes. Ho was given u\n\nvociferous round of applause which\n\nlusted for sovoral minutes. Woodfull\n\nshook him warmly by the hand. His\n\ninnings hud been chnneclcss.\n\ni Thomas was eying tho -long bundle,\n\nbut was not connecting with Urim\n\nI mott's well-flighted dohvorios. Bud\n\ncock's Ano innings ended when ho tried\n\nto turn n well-pitclicd delivery on lim\n\nleg, mid spooned it softly to Woodfull,\n\nwno was standing 20 yarus from thc\n\nbatsman at square leg. Klcveii boun-\n\ndaries were included in Badcock's to-\n\ntal of 105, which was made in 103 min-\n\nutes.\n\nThomas (15) and Rushforth were\n\nthou associated, but play was hem\n\nup for a few seconds wliilo Wood\n\nluil carried otc tho field a small\n\nciiild who lina wandered half-way\n\nto tho wicket from the fence.\n\nRushforth opened his account with u\n\nsquaro-cut for four off Uarling, but thu\n\nscoring ruto slackened till tho after-\n\nnoon icu interval, when three wickets\n\nHerc dora for 235, Thomas being 25\n\nand Rushforth 10.\n\nDULL PLAY.\n\nRusliforth, after a poriud of ' dull,\n\nplay, brought up 250 iu 211 minutos by\n\nturning Flcotwood-SinitU to tho lino leg\n\nlonco, and after a furthor dull period\n\nRushforth plnyod a straight delivery\n\nfrom Grimmett with his puus, and was\n\ngiven out. His 20 runs had taken 51\n\nminutes to compilo, and included four\n\nfours.\n\nThomas, who had occupied the crease\n\nfor 82 minutes, had boon giving a ra-\n\nther tedious display during tho half\n\nhour, uftor tea. He went for a big\n\nhit off Flcctwood-Smith, but tho bull\n\nwhipped under his bat .iud scattered\n\ntho uails. There were four fours in\n\nhis total.\n\nTho Southern colts Rothwell and\n\nPearsall became associated, but Pear\n\nsalt did not last long, for iu reaching\n\nforward to a bull, which he missed,\n\nfrom Flcctwood-Smith, he lifted his\n\nfoot and Oldfield stumped him smartly.\n\nSix wickets had then fallen for 200.\n\nJanies, with successive four» off\n\ni'leetwood-Simth, brightened Ibo scor-\n\ning considerably. Ùliipperfield, whu\n\nhud not bowled since before lunch, re-\n\nlieved Grimmett (2 for 01) at tho\n\nsouthern cud, after drinks had been\n\nlaken, -and both batsmen run into\n\ndouble figures, Rothwell swept Fleet\n\nivood-iSmiih to thc leg fence, but the\n\nnext ball was cockell up on the on side,\n\nand Woodful), running in from mid-on,\n\nsplendidly caught tho ball close to\n\nthe ground.
