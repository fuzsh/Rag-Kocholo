De-\n\nfeat for South would havo left it within\n\neasy striking distance of Sandy Bav and\n\nNew Town, but Putman. Richardson,\n\nT.imb and Hay batted with such deter-\n\nmination that tho team was pulled out\n\nof an awkward situation, and placed on\n\nthe highway to the premiership! South's\n\nposition was Improved further by tho In-\n\nability of Sandv Bay to force a victory\n\nagainst North-West, and, with only two\n\nmatches remaining, tho leaders' pros-\n\npects are indeed bright.\n\nTwo rounds of home-and-home matches\n\nhave been completed, and thc draw for\n\nthe first of the,remaining two matches,\n\nwhich will begin to-morrow, has brought\n\nSouth and Kingborough together again,\n\nthis timo on thc South Hobart ground.\n\nDespite the advantago of playing at homo,\n\nSouth will find Kingborough a more\n\ndifficult proposition\n\nthan last week, as\n\nthe country team will\n\nbe reinforced by tho\n\nreturn of the Combes\n\nbrothers and ? Pear-\n\nsall, It was most\n\nunfortunate for\n\nKingborough that lt\n\nshould bavo lost Its\n\nthree leading play-\n\ners for two games at\n\na vital stage In tho\n\npremiership contest.\n\nThe match to-mor-\n\nrow, In view of its\n\nImportance, will no\n\ndoubt create much\n\ninterest, though en-\n\nthusiasts will be dis-\n\nappointed that Mor\n\nrisby has decided not\n\nto nlav.\n\nA. O. Burrows. Help\n\nHis appearance after his Indian tour\n\nwould have drawn a largo crowd.\n\nThe meeting of Sandy Bay and New\n\nTown, on the ground of the latter, will\n\nbo in the nature of a knock-out contest.\n\nIt is still possible for either team to win\n\nthe premiership, and, however dim their\n\nprospects may be. while there Is life there\n\nls hope. Defeat tor South would keep the\n\nwinning team at New Town well in the\n\nfight, and the play ? between two such\n\nevenly-matched teams ls sure to be keen.\n\nThe remaining game, between North-\n\nwest and Glenorchy, at Glenorchy, will\n\nhaye only local interest.\n\nThe second and third grade competitions\n\nalso are at a most interesting stage. In\n\neach grade Kingborough holds the lead\n\nfrom New Town, with South Hobart also\n\nIn the running in second grade. Tho,\n\nmeeting of New Town and Kingborough\n\nIn the last matches of the roster appears\n\nlikely, to decide tho premiership in each\n\ngrade. The same teams also hold tho\n\nstrongest positions In the club champion-\n\nship, and tho successful clubs, therefore,\n\n(are not likely to be known until the last\n\nday of the season.

O. Burrows.\n\nFew players have given Tasmania bet-\n\nter service in the past 10 years or so\n\nthan A. O. Burrows, the New Town all\n\nrounder. When he first came under no-\n\ntice he was played chiefly as a medium\n\npaced bowler, but he developed his bat-\n\nting to such an extent that he became\n\natf opening batsman for the State. A\n\nplayer who ' combines a sound defence\n\nwith ability to hit the loose ball power-\n\nfully, he ls usually Interesting to watch at\n\nthe wickets. For Tasmania he has made\n\nmore than 1,000 runs and lins taken SO\n\nwickets. In 1929 he was chosen to play\n\nfor Woodfull's team in a Test trial -in\n\nSydney and, in an innings of 6S0, secured\n\nMcCabe's wicket at a cost of 75 runs. Ho\n\nis credited in Wlsden's \"Cricketers'\n\nAlmanack\" with having knocked a ball\n\nfurther than any other player. At the\n\nNew Town ground In November, 1925,\n\nplaying against North-West Hobart, he\n\nsent a ball 83 yards; 1 foot, 9 Inches.\n\nBurrows began his career with Clemes\n\nCollege, where he was cricket captain\n\nfor three years, in each of which the\n\nschool won the premiership. Ho played\n\nA. O. Burrows. Help\n\nA. O. Burrows.\n\na season or two with\n\nWellington-until the\n\nreintroduction of dis-\n\ntrict cricket In 1923\n\n4, led to his associa-\n\ntion with New Town,\n\nto which ho has\n\ngiven Invaluable ser-\n\nvice. Ho has won\n\nthe club batting\n\naverage nearly every\n\nseason, and has been\n\na mainstay of the\n\nbowling. His best\n\nperiod with tho ball\n\nwas seven or eight\n\nyears ago, when he\n\ntook 71 and 09 wick-\n\nets in consecutive\n\nseasons.

Tho bat has been more or less In\n\nthe experimental stages, though Cooper\n\n(New South Wales) used It In a Sheffield\n\nShield match with Victoria, and Robin-\n\nson, another State representative, used\n\nlt In a first-grade match. During the\n\ndemonstration there was some big hitting\n\nby Kippax, Easton, Robinson and other\n\nprominent players, all of whom seemed\n\nvery favourably impressed. . Robinson\n\nwas definite that the steel shafts give\n\ngreater power and distance.\n\nA cross-sectional view of the construc-\n\ntion of tho. bat was shown and explained\n\nby the inventor. Mr. E. J. Brookes, of\n\nSlazengers (A) Ltd. Tho handle of tho\n\nbat ls centred on two steel-shafts which\n\nare forced, side by side, under great pres-\n\nsure, into fibre sockets, which penetrate\n\nabout 0 Inches into the blade of the bat.\n\nTho shafts are slightly tapered from bot-\n\ntom to top to prevent withdrawal, and\n\nmechanical tests, using pressures up to\n\n25 tons, have failed to move them without\n\nthe blade being broken. To prevent any\n\ntwist, tho shafts are electrically welded\n\ntogether at the top find, to avoid jarring,\n\ncork packing is placed between them from\n\ntho join down. -With this construction\n\nthe only bend In the handle is along the\n\nbatting plane, so that tho bat is absolutely\n\nfirm laterally. Under strenuous mechani-\n\ncal tests the bat shows unusual strength\n\nand, given blades of the same quality, lt\n\nseems certain that the steel-shafted handle\n\nwill offer greater power and less likeli-\n\nhood of slip catches.\n\nAnother feature ls the grip, a composi-\n\ntion ot cork and rubber which gives a\n\nbetter grip, as it cannot twist or work\n\nloose. According to official opinion there\n\nIs nothing to prevent a player uBlng thc\n\nsteel-shafted bat, as tho only law In\n\ncricket dealing with the bat rules on the\n\nsize, without any restriction as ? to the\n\nmake.\n\nEXTRAS.\n\nTwo lessons learned from the recent\n\nmainland tour, which should be borne In\n\nmind by future Tasmanian selectors, are\n\nthat men should not be chosen solely on\n\nclub form, because some are better suited,\n\ntemperamentally and otherwise, to the\n\nbig occasion, and that players should not\n\nbe included unless they are at least reason-\n\nably smart and sound in the field.\n\nGreen, after a lean-time last year, has\n\ncarried the weak North-west batting side\n\non his shoulders this season. He has made\n\n475 runs at an average of almost 60.\n\nbatsman of his solidity would havo been\n\nInvaluable in tho Tasmanian team on the\n\nmainland.\n\nFitzpatrick has had many useful per-\n\nformances for New Town to his credit this\n\nseason. Time after time a vigorous in-\n\nnings, or a good bowling feat, has turned\n\nthe tide for his side. He has made 186\n\nruns In 10 Innings, and has taken 27\n\nwickets at a cost of 17 each.\n\nBradman's 369 against Tasmania was\n\nhis 24th score of moro than 200 In first\n\nclass cricket. He thereby surpassed the\n\nrecord of Hammond, wno has made 23\n\nsuch scores. Bradman also has played the\n\ngreatest number of innings of more than\n\n300-five.\n\nPutman. in tho last match at Kingston,\n\nbecame the first Southern bowler. to\n\nsecure 60 wickets for the season. He\n\nhas now taken 55 at an average of 14.\n\nA. Combes secured his 50th wicket in\n\nAdelaide. His average is 12.7.\n\nCOMPULSORY CLOSURE\n\nAfter First Day Y Play\n\nConsideration by Committee\n\nA meeting of the pennant committee of\n\nthe Tasmanian Cricket Association was\n\nheld at1 Hobart last night. Mr. H. C.\n\nSmith was in the chair.\n\nMr. J. Pratt suggested that considera-\n\ntion should be given to the Introduction of\n\nthe New South Wales Cricket Associa-\n\ntion rule whereby at the close of the first\n\nday of play In a 2-day match, provided rio\n\nweather circumstances Interfered, tho cap-\n\ntain of a side which was still batting should\n\nbo compelled to declare the innings closed.\n\nMr. Smith said that, whereas a large\n\nnumber of matches In New South Wales\n\nhad previously resulted in draws, only one\n\ndraw had resulted since tho Innovation.\n\nIt was resolved to defer consideration\n\nuntil the next meeting of tho committee.\n\nIt was decided that the T.C.A. would\n\ngive its sanction to the second and third\n\ngrade premier teams arranging matches\n\nwith northern second and third grade pre-\n\nmiers, at their own cost.\n\nMr. Pratt said he believed the umpires\n\nconsidered they would do better if they\n\ndrew up their own roster.\n\nTho matter was referred to the umpires'\n\ncommittee.

Four rounds will be played this\n\nseason, and the first series of gaines in\n\ntho fifth round will bo commenced. The\n\nseason, as far as pennant games aro con-\n\ncerned, will conclude on April 4, which is\n\na week before the Easter programme of\n\nmatches commences, ,.\n\nGAMES TO-MORROW.\n\nNorth and South Launceston, tho two\n\nleading teams will be opposed in tho prin-\n\ncipal match to -morrow. Tho game will bo\n\nplayed on tho Cornwall ground, and if\n\nSouth defeats the formidable North Laun-\n\nceston side, tho other clubs, and South,\n\nwill have a new lease of life as far as the\n\npremiership ls concerned. South has a\n\nfew doubtful starters, however. It ls\n\nhoped that Rushforth will be back from\n\nMelbourne in time to lead South, but if\n\nho is, Room will probably have a spell\n\nfor the match. West and East Laun-\n\nceston will meet on the Association\n\nground. East will be weakened by the\n\nabsence of Scott, Dulling and Dwyer. It\n\nls rumoured that Dulling will not play\n\nagain this season. West will probably be\n\nwithout Frank Davis, but will otherwise\n\nbe at full strength.\n\nEASTER MATCHES.\n\nThe Northern Association has arranged\n\na heavy, but interesting programme of\n\nmatches for Easter. The main attrac-\n\ntion will be the return North v. South\n\nmatch at Launceston. This will ba\n\nplayed on tho Association ground on Eas-\n\nter Saturday, Monday and Tuesday. On\n\nEaster Saturday and Monday a second\n\nNorthern Tasmanian eleven will play the\n\nNorth-West Coast at Latrobe. Two \"B\"\n\nGrade games have been arranged. A \"B\"\n\ngrade team will play the North Tamar\n\nAssociation at Launceston on Easter Sat-\n\nurday,, and a \"B\" grade, team will play\n\ntho Scottsdale Association on Easter Mon-\n\nday at Launceston. An interesting game\n\nwill be that betweon a combined Northern\n\n\"C\" grade team, and the Hobart rubik\n\nSchool Old Boys' Association team. This\n\nwill be played on Easter Saturday. A\n\ndate has not yet been fixed to select\n\nNorthern teams for these games.\n\nLEASE Ol' CRICKET OROUND.\n\nBuring the Winter months, for many\n\nyears, it has been the practice of the\n\nNorthern Tasmanian Cricket Association\n\nto let the cricket ground to the Northern\n\nTasmanian Football Association. For\n\nmany years senior football matches were\n\nplayed on the cricket ground, but since\n\n1S2B, when York Park came into use, tne\n\ncricket ground has been used, in the\n\nmain, by the junior footballers. The\n\nusual application for the use of the ground\n\nduring .the Winter has come before tho\n\nNorthern Tasmanian Cricket Association,\n\nbut the football authorities have pointed\n\nout that, owing to gradually dwindling\n\nsupport for football, lt cannot pay the £75\n\nrental asked by the cricket association,\n\nand suggests that the ground be let for\n\n£00 this year. The cricket authorities\n\nappear to be decided on the sdm of £75,'\n\nand the football interests re-Iterate that\n\nthey cannot, and will not pav that sum.\n\nThe question now arises, whether the\n\ncricket association will agree to the pro-\n\nposal, or adhere to its previous decision,\n\nwhich, apparently, will mean that the\n\nground will not be used by the Football\n\nAssociation this season. Should the latter\n\nalternative prevail,.it will be interesting to\n\nsee what does become of the ground, lt\n\nis too good as a sports ground to lie Idle\n\nduring the Winter months, and the Cricket\n\nAssociation obviously depends on the\n\nrevenue received during the Winter. lt\n\nls known that other sporting organisations\n\nure anxious J.o lease thc ground, and there\n\nappears to be a strong feeling among foot-\n\nballers and cricketers that, should the\n\nCricket Association decide against letting\n\nthe ground to the Football Association at\n\na rental lower than £75, it should not al-\n\nlow the ground to go to another sporting\n\nbody at a lower sum. Cricket and Aus-\n\ntralian rules football go hand-in-hand in\n\nAustralia, as sports, and the Football As-\n\nsociation ls an \"old client\" of the Cricket\n\nAssociation. If the ground is leased to\n\nanother body at a sum lower than that de-\n\nmanded of the Football Association, lt\n\nwill be felt that an Injustice has been\n\ndono to the footballers.\n\nTASMANIAN PERSONALITIES.\n\nNo. 18-N. W. Davis.\n\nThough Neil Davis has not always done\n\nthe big things expected of him in first\n\nclass cricket he has, for 20 seasons, prov-\n\ned one of the most attractive and enter-\n\ntaining batsmen in club cricket in Northern\n\nN. W. Davit. Help\n\nN. W. Davit.\n\nTasmania. Davis\n\nlearned hts cricket\n\nat tile Launceston\n\nChurch Grammar\n\nSchool and. when In-\n\nterviewed this week,\n\nhe attributed all lils\n\nsuccess to the\n\ntliorough grounding\n\nwhich he received\n\nfrom tho late J. H.\n\nSavigny, whom he\n\ndescribed as the\n\n\"prince of coaches.\"\n\nHe first turned out\n\nlu pennant cricket\n\ngames in tho 1914-15\n\nseason, with the Esk\n\nClub, at the age of\n\n15. He played for\n\nNorthern Tasmania"
