        "text": "Facts:\n\nThe last clash between the sides last season was won by Tasmania by 6 wickets.\n\nIn the last five clashes between the sides, QUN leads the tally by 3-2.\n\nTasmania vs Queensland Chance of Winning\n\nThe points table has shaped up quite well after almost every team has finished playing four games in the competition.\n\nTasmania had a disappointing start in the competition since they lost the first two games but bounced back in their last outing with a win against South Australia. With that, they are placed fifth in the table standings with 4 points and a net run rate of -0.696. They will be pumped after their last victory and look to earn another set of points in the upcoming game.\n\nThis season did not start in the favour of Queensland. They faced a loss in their initial game while their next game was abandoned due to rain. So far, the team has managed to win a single game while losing on two occasions. They are placed 4th in the points table with 7 points and a net run rate of -0.027.\n\nQueensland's chance of winning: 62%\n\nTasmania’s chance of winning: 38%\n\nBest Bookmakers for Sports Betting in India\n\nRank Rating Bonus Link #1\n\nParimatch\n\n5\n\n★★★★★\n\nWelcome bonus\n\nINR 30,000\n\nPromocode\n\nSCAFE30\n\nJoin ParimatchRead review #2\n\nMelbet\n\n4.9\n\n★★★★★\n\nWelcome bonus\n\nINR 20,000\n\nPromocode\n\nSCAFE30\n\nJoin MelbetRead review #3\n\n1Win\n\n4.8\n\n★★★★★\n\nWelcome bonus\n\nINR 145,000\n\nPromocode\n\nSCAFE145\n\nJoin 1winRead review\n\n‌\n\nTasmania vs Queensland Betting Tips\n\nQueensland to score higher before their first dismissal (1.727 @1XBET)\n\nUsman Khawaja has taken a seat while Sam Heazlett replaced him in the opening line-up alongside Ben McDermott for Queensland. Heazlett and McDermott average at 34.66 & 54.33 respectively in the competition. QUN has posted 39, 30 & 37 runs before their first dismissal in the three games. This indicates consistency in the opening duo. Whereas things look pretty fragile for Tasmania. They posted 17, 0 & 124 runs for the first wicket in three games. They have Caleb Jewell & Jake Weatherald, averaging at 34.33 & 24.00, as openers. Moreover, the Tasmanian bowlers have not been much efficient with the ball. The team conceded 12, 137 & 172 runs in three games before picking their first wicket in the game. This will be exploited by the Queensland openers who already look in good form.\n\nTasmania vs Queensland Toss Prediction\n\nBellerive Oval, Hobart, is a small ground, and the short square boundaries offer many scoring opportunities to the batsmen. The wicket offers early assistance to the fast bowlers, who have done well here. There is little on this surface for the spinners, and they have gone for runs. Most teams have preferred to chase totals in this tournament, which has worked well for them. The pitch will assist the bowlers early on during the game. Hence, the side that wins the toss in this game will likely opt for bowling first.\n\nWeather Report\n\nThe skies will remain mostly cloudy on the match day with a high of 17 degrees Celsius in Hobart on the match day.\n\nQueensland Player List\n\nXavier Bartlett, James Bazley, Max Bryant, Joe Burns, Jack Clayton, Blake Edwards, Liam Guthrie, Aryan Jain, Usman Khawaja, Matthew Kuhnemann, Marnus Labuschagne, Ben McDermott, Michael Neser, Jimmy Peirson, Matthew Renshaw, Gurinder Sandhu, Mark Steketee, Bryce Street, Connor Sully, Mitch Swepson, Jack Wildermuth.

They needed to do better with the ball as they let their opponents score 349 runs in the previous game.\n\nTasmania Player List\n\nGabe Bell, Iain Carlisle, Paddy Dooley, Jake Doran, Nathan Ellis, Jarrod Freeman, Brad Hope, Caleb Jewell, Riley Meredith, Lawrence Neil-Smith, Mitch Owen, Sam Rainbird, Jordan Silk, Billy Stanlake, Matthew Wade, Charlie Wakim, Tim Ward, Jake Weatherald, Beau Webster, Mac Wright, Nick Davis, Nivethan Radhakrishnan\n\nPredicted Playing XI\n\nCaleb Jewell\n\nWicket-keeper\n\nJake Weatherald\n\nBatsman\n\nJordan Silk (c)\n\nBatsman\n\nMac Wright\n\nBatsman\n\nBeau Webster\n\nAll-rounder\n\nBradley Hope\n\nAll-rounder\n\nMitch Owen\n\nBatsman\n\nBilly Stanlake\n\nBowler\n\nPatrick Dooley\n\nBowler\n\nSam Rainbird\n\nBowler\n\nMitchell Owen\n\nBowler\n\nTasmania Recent Form\n\nAfter having a disastrous campaign last time around, Tasmania’s campaign this season began with two consecutive defeats. They scored pretty high in the previous game and won it.\n\nTasmania vs Queensland Head-to-Head Record\n\nIn the last five meetings between the two sides, Queensland has won three of those outings whereas Tasmania only won two.\n\nQueensland Won: 3\n\nTasmania Won: 2\n\nNo Result/ Abandoned: 0\n\nTasmania vs Queensland Betting Odds\n\nTasmania went against South Australia in their last outing and scored 435 runs batting first. It was a tremendous batting effort from the team with top-class innings from Jordan Silk (116) & Caleb Jewell (90). TAS bowlers did not have to do much while SAU concluded their innings at 398. Tasmania won the game by 37 runs while Mitchell Owen got the most wickets (3) for Tasmania.\n\nQueensland lost their last game against Victoria in a failed attempt to chase a high target. They conceded 349 runs while Jack Wildermuth picked 3 scalps for QUN. However, there were only a few batters in the team who stood tall in the game. Matt Renshaw (102), Ben McDermott (86) & Max Bryant (62) led an impressive innings in the game but the team fell short by 19 runs by the end, hence, losing the game.\n\nTasmania vs Queensland Top Batters\n\nBeau Webster to be the top batter for Tasmania\n\nAll-rounder Beau Webster has been terrific in the competition so far. After a splendid last season, he went on to post 83, 65 & 42 runs in his three games in the three games of the current competition. He has 190 runs in 3 games at an average of 63.33.\n\nBen McDermott to be the top batter for Queensland\n\nBen McDermott scored two fifties for Queensland in three games. He has scored 52, 25 & 86 runs in the three games and averages at 163 runs in 3 games at an average of 54.33. He will be expected to score a bundle of runs in the upcoming game considering his explosive form.\n\nTasmania vs Queensland Top Bowlers\n\nMitchell Owen to be Tasmania's top bowler\n\nMitchell Owen took 3 wickets in his last game for 46 runs. He has played 3 games and picked 4 wickets so far. He will be looking to maintain his good momentum in the next game.\n\nJack Wildermuth to be the top bowler for Queensland\n\nJack Wildermuth is a terrific bowler and picked 5 wickets in 2 innings that he bowled in. He has an economy rate of 6.42 in the competition and picked 3 wickets in his last game. He looks in good form and should trouble Tasmania batters in the next game."
