        "text": "TASMANIA will host NSW in its first home Pura Cup final after an astonishing final round in which three teams had a chance to cement their place in the decider and none of them took it.\n\nOnly three days after making NSW's lowest total — 53 — and despite their second-innings revival still resulting in a seven-wicket defeat, the Blues somehow held onto second spot on a congested table to qualify for the five-day final, which will start at Bellerive Oval next Monday.\n\nThey survived, on 28 points to Tasmania's 38, thanks to third-placed Victoria and fourth-placed Western Australia also failing to grasp their opportunities to make the title match, both losing to sides which effectively had nothing to play for.\n\nVictoria finished on 26 points after managing to lose to Queensland on Saturday despite dismissing the Bulls for just 119 in the first innings of the match. Victoria made 165 in reply, then when set 224 to win collapsed to be all out 122.\n\nWA would have backed itself to beat wooden spooner South Australia in Adelaide, especially after taking a 75-run first-innings lead. But while a win would have put WA into the final, instead the Redbacks scored their only victory of the season, by 61 runs. Set a generous 292 to win in 78 overs, WA slumped to 4-14 and never recovered. It also ended on 26 points, level with Victoria and Queensland but ultimately placed second-last on games won.\n\nMaking its first-innings capitulation all the more remarkable, NSW hit back from 2-25 in its follow-on innings on Friday afternoon to be all out 498 yesterday, with debutant Ben Rohrer making a superb 163, and stand-in captain Dominic Thornely 138.\n\nThis set Tasmania the target of 182, providing hope of a famous victory for the Blues, but the Tasmanians achieved it for the loss of three wickets in 43 overs.\n\nThornely said NSW would draw a lot of confidence from its second-innings fightback. It can also look forward to the returns of Simon Katich from injury and paceman Matthew Nicholson.\n\n\"We're pretty excited by the way we got back into the game and the character the blokes showed,\" Thornely said.\n\n\"Yes, we'll walk away with the lowest score the state's ever recorded, but also with a lot of the blokes confident about next week. We had blokes playing their first, second, third or fourth games, so to come back the way we did is a real achievement.\n\n\"Momentum's a great thing in cricket. We got ourselves geared up to bat all day Saturday, and while we were doing that, word came through that the Vics had gone down. Then we hear WA were 4-14. All of a sudden things started happening for us.\"\n\nRohrer was called up from Fairfield-Liverpool for his debut due to Katich's unavailability with a cut thumb. Peter Forrest, in his second game, made a responsible second-innings 61 in a stabilising third-wicket stand with Thornely of 144, but may have to be dropped for Katich's return in the final, since fellow newcomer Rohrer clearly cannot.\n\nSimilarly, paceman Mark Cameron may have to make way for Nicholson despite taking 5-116 in Tasmania's first innings of 370 in only his third match.\n\n\"Rohrer and Forrest were just revelations,\" said coach Trevor Bayliss. \"All our batsmen are in form. We've had five different century-makers in two games, so we're feeling pretty good about the final.\n\n\"We've had a remarkable turnaround from one of our worst-ever days on Friday to one of our best ever on Saturday. The 53 was almost like an illusion, in that none of us can work out how and why it happened.\""
