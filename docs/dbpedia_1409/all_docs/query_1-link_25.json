        "text": "Glenn Phillips may be known primarily for his batting but it was his bowling display that took cricket fans breath away on day three of the first Test between New Zealand and Australia. The part-time spinner made history by taking the first five-wicket haul in a home Test for the Black Caps in 16 years.\n\nThe all-rounder tore through Australia's batting line-up in the second innings, taking 5-45 off 16 overs. He is the first New Zealander to to take five wickets in an innings on home soil since Jeetan Patel in 2000.\n\nUNWANTED RECORD: Nathan Lyon's heroics fail to free him from unwanted history\n\n'NEVER IN AUSTRALIA': Cricket fans blown away by sight in New Zealand\n\nIt was also Phillips's maiden five-wicket haul in first-class cricket. With the fifer, the 27-year-old has raced to 16 wickets in six Tests at an impressive bowling average of 16. It is also his second four-plus wicket haul after claiming 4-53 against Bangladesh last year.\n\nPhillips ran riot through Australia's middle order, removing Travis Head (29) and Mitch Marsh (golden duck) in consecutive balls to set up an unlikely hat-trick attempt. Alex Carey left alone the hat-trick ball but he was dismissed by Phillips shortly after, popping one up to Tim Southee.\n\nThe all-rounder also dismissed in-form opener Usman Khawaja (28) and completed his five-wicket haul by removing dangerman Cam Green. \"It’s a dream come true,\" Phillips said during the innings break. \"It’s a surreal moment.\"\n\nThe 27-year-old was also the best of the Kiwi bats in their first innings, scoring 71 and said at the close of play on day two that New Zealand would be in the contest with a chase under 400. After Phillips' heroics with the ball, New Zealand are left with just that, needing 369 to register an unlikely victory. Success for the Black Caps would require their best-ever run-chase.\n\nNew Zealand fielders slammed after missed chances on day three\n\nEven with Phillips' five-for, New Zealand could have headed into their second innings with a more achievable total to chase down if they had held onto their chances. The Black Caps made a host of errors on simple catches, handing numerous Aussie batsmen a lifeline.\n\nScott Kuggeleijn, Henry Nicholls and Tim Southee (twice) all dropped regulation chances in the second innings. Cricket fans were quick to point out that the poor fielding display was similar to that of Pakistan's against the Aussies. Pakistan were left to rue a host of fielding errors earlier in the summer against Australia after they lost the Test series 3-0.\n\nAustralia take control of the first Test\n\nChasing a 369-run target for victory, New Zealand were left stunned after Nathan Lyon snagged two early wickets for the Australians. He removed New Zealand opener Tom Latham for 8 and dismissed captain Kane Williamson, the world’s No.1 Test batter shortly after for 9. Latham was caught behind after edging a cut shot, while Williamson was caught at leg slip. New Zealand have a mountain to climb if they are to register a first home success over Australia in more than three decades."
