        "text": "Mitchell Starc has sent a clear message to national selectors, claiming 10 wickets in New South Wales' Sheffield Shield victory over Tasmania in Sydney.\n\nStarc picked up the final Tasmanian wicket on day four to give him five in each innings, with New South Wales requiring less than nine overs to reach the victory target of 45.\n\nIt's the second ten-wicket haul of Starc's Shield career, and comes at the perfect time as he presses for a Test recall.\n\nAfter a slow start to the Shield campaign – he claimed just one wicket in the Blues' opening match in Brisbane – Starc has now ensured his name will very much be in the selectors' minds when the squad for Australia's first Test against Pakistan is named next month.\n\nThe 29-year-old finished with 5-40 and 5-20 against Tasmania, leading New South Wales to an eight wicket victory, their second win from as many games this season.\n\nWith Starc's economy rate often cited as one reason the national selectors looked elsewhere in England, New South Wales coach Phil Jaques says the big left-armer did everything right at Drummoyne Oval.\n\n\"Towards the back end of the match at the Gabba Mitch started to bowl really well, and he looked great at training before this game,\" Jaques told Wide World of Sports.\n\n\"He really let the handbrake off this game and went back to doing what he does best, he was fast and aggressive and his economy and consistency was the best I've seen it.\n\n\"It bodes really well for the Australian summer if he can keep bowling like that.\"\n\nStarc played just one of the five Ashes Tests in England, even as selectors rotated James Pattinson, Josh Hazlewood and Peter Siddle as support for Pat Cummins.\n\nOnly Nathan Lyon has taken more Test wickets in Australia this decade than Starc, and Jaques believes the return to home conditions will be a big factor in the coming months.\n\n\"We got it reversing in both innings which was fantastic and Mitch is probably the best reverse swing bowler in the world. He showed his class and he was so consistent with the areas he hit, every ball it looked like something might happen for us,\" Jaques said.\n\n\"He's a world class performer and his record backs that up.\n\n\"The selectors went in a different direction in England, given the conditions over there, but I reckon in Australian conditions he's someone you just can't leave out.\"\n\nDavid Warner was unable to repeat the form he showed in Brisbane, where his first innings 125 was the difference in a low-scoring game. Scores of 1 and 15 not out against Tasmania represented a lean return, although his century in Brisbane last week makes him a near-certain pick for the Pakistan series, despite his horror run in England.\n\nJaques though, believes another big score is just around the corner.\n\n\"He batted beautifully in Brisbane, he had superb intent, he moved his feet really well and played an outstanding innings on a tough wicket,\" the former Test opener said.\n\n\"There's certainly nothing wrong with the way he's hitting the ball, he batted nicely again in the second innings here at Drummoyne.\n\n\"I don't think there's any issues with his form, obviously he'd love another big score, but from what I saw in Brisbane and in the nets, he's looking world class.\n\n\"I'm obviously not a selector but he's definitely in Australia's best eleven, 100 percent.\"\n\nAnd while there's plenty of names being bandied about as Warner's possible opening partner for the Brisbane Test, one name who might slip under the radar is Daniel Hughes.\n\nThe 30-year-old left-hander made two centuries in the domestic 50-over competition, as well as a vital second-innings 66 not out that guided the Blues to victory over Queensland.\n\n\"Dan's been a very good performer for a long time, but he's in red-hot form right now,\" Jaques said.\n\n\"He was outstanding in the one-dayers, and then played a critical innings at the Gabba. In the context of the game that was worth 100.\n\n\"It was a fantastic knock. He's showing a real maturity and if he gets a chance he certainly wouldn't let anyone down.\n\n\"I'm a little bit surprised he hasn't been looked at before, because he's one of the most well credentialed players going around.\""
