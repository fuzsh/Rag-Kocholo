        "text": "Facts:\n\nTasmania leads the tally by 2-1 in the last five meetings against South Australia.\n\nCurrently, Tasmania are placed at the first place of the table whereas South Australia are placed at the 5th place.\n\nTasmania vs South Australia Chances of Winning\n\nTasmania have dominated in the competition. They have only lost a single game whereas the majority of the matches ended up in their favour. They are coming after a win against Victoria here. With five wins and a loss, Tasmania is placed at the top of the points table with 46.36 points. The team will look to assert dominance in the next game as well.\n\nSouth Australia, on the contrary, are not having a pleasant time in the competition. They have won two games while losing on six occasions in the competition. It has been a while since the team tasted any success. They are coming from a draw against New South Wales here. They are placed at the 5th place of the table with 25.78 points. With a few games left in the competition, there is very little hope for the team to win the title.\n\nSouth Australia chance of winning - 32%\n\nTasmania chance of winning - 68%\n\nBest Bookmakers for Sports Betting in India\n\nRank Rating Bonus Link #1\n\nParimatch\n\n5\n\n★★★★★\n\nWelcome bonus\n\nINR 30,000\n\nPromocode\n\nSCAFE30\n\nJoin ParimatchRead review #2\n\nMelbet\n\n4.9\n\n★★★★★\n\nWelcome bonus\n\nINR 20,000\n\nPromocode\n\nSCAFE30\n\nJoin MelbetRead review #3\n\n1Win\n\n4.8\n\n★★★★★\n\nWelcome bonus\n\nINR 145,000\n\nPromocode\n\nSCAFE145\n\nJoin 1winRead review\n\n‌\n\nTasmania vs South Australia Betting Tips\n\nSouth Australia to score low before 1st dismissal\n\nSouth Australia has a decent batting unit in the team. They have several batting options in the team and have Henry Hunt & Jake Carder opened for the side earlier but could not deliver any impactful results. Currently Jake Fraser-McGurk and Kyle Brazell open for the side and average at 21.21 & 11.25 respectively in the competition. The team has posted the scores of 6, 7, 1, 0 & 19 runs before 1st dismissal in the 1st innings in their last five outings. New South Wales do have a talented bowling order and will be making things harder for South Australian batters. South Australia scored 30 runs before their first dismissal in the 1st innings of the game against Tasmania. Henry Hunt and Kelvin Smith opened earlier for the team before but the openers have changed in the current games. That said, South Australia will lose an early wicket in the next game against TAS.\n\nTasmania vs South Australia Toss Prediction\n\nThe pitch at the Bellerive Oval is a really good one for batting that stays true throughout. The bounce here is good, but it won’t really trouble the batters unless the ball is new. Spinners will find some help from the surface too, and their middle overs can be extremely crucial. While there is no clear advantage in favour of the team batting first, we reckon, chasing will not be easy in a high-pressure game especially if the target is quite competitive.\n\nWeather Report\n\nThere will be no rain during the game. The temperature will remain around 23 degree Celsius on March 11. The skies will be partly cloudy.\n\nTasmania Players List\n\nGabe Bell, Iain Carlisle, Paddy Dooley, Jake Doran, Nathan Ellis, Jarrod Freeman, Brad Hope, Caleb Jewell, Riley Meredith, Lawrence Neil-Smith, Mitch Owen, Sam Rainbird, Jordan Silk, Billy Stanlake, Matthew Wade, Charlie Wakim, Tim Ward, Jake Weatherald, Beau Webster, Mac Wright, Nick Davis, Nivethan Radhakrishnan\n\nPredicted Playing XI\n\nCaleb Jewell\n\nBatter\n\nJake Doran\n\nWicket Keeper\n\nJordan Silk (c)\n\nBatter\n\nTim Ward\n\nBatter\n\nBeau Webster\n\nAll-rounder\n\nCharlie Wakim\n\nBatter\n\nKieran Elliott\n\nBowler\n\nBradley Hope\n\nAll-rounder\n\nIain Carlisle\n\nBowler\n\nRiley Meredith\n\nBowler\n\nJarrod Freeman\n\nBowler\n\nTasmania Recent Form\n\nTasmania has a well rounded line-up of batters and a good quality of bowling. They are coming from a win against Victoria here. The batters were extremely good in scoring runs in the last game.\n\nSouth Australia Player List\n\nDaniel Drew, Harry Matthias, Henry Hunt, Issac Higgins, Jake Carder, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Jake Lehmann, Kelvin Smith, Thomas Kelly, Aiden Cahill, Kyle Brazell, Liam Scott, Harry Nielsen (wk), Brendan Manenti, Brendan Doggett, David Grant, Harry Conway, Jordan Buckingham, Lloyd Pope, Nathan McAndrew, Wes Agar, henry Thompson\n\nPredicted Playing XI\n\nKyle Brazell\n\nBatter\n\nJake Fraser-McGurk\n\nBatter\n\nJake Lehmann (c)\n\nBatter\n\nBen Manenti\n\nAll-rounder\n\nHarry Nielsen (wk)\n\nWicket-keeper\n\nNathan McSweeney\n\nAll-rounder\n\nWes Agar\n\nBowler\n\nBrendan Doggett\n\nBowler\n\nLiam Scott\n\nBowler\n\nNathan McAndrew\n\nBowler\n\nJordan Buckingham\n\nBatter\n\nSouth Australia Recent Form\n\nSouth Australia have lost four games in a row. They are coming from a draw here. They batted decently but their bowling order was extremely expensive and were unable to pick wickets in the game.\n\nTasmania vs South Australia Head-to-Head\n\nIn the last five clashes between the sides, Tasmania leads the tally by 2-1.\n\nT20 Head-to-Head Records\n\nTasmania - 2\n\nSouth Australia - 1\n\nNo Result/Abandoned - 2\n\nTasmania vs South Australia Betting Odds\n\nTasmania clashed against Victoria in their last outing.

He has scored 840 runs in 15 innings. He averages 70.00 in the competition. He scored 9 & 167* runs in the last game and is expected to score high in the upcoming fixture.\n\nTasmania vs South Australia Best Bowlers\n\nNathan McAndrew to be South Australia’s Best Bowler\n\nNathan McAndrew is the best bowler from South Australia right now. He has picked 37 wickets in 14 innings of the competition. He has an impressive economy rate of 2.83 in the competition.
