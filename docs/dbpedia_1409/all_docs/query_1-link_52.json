        "text": "West Indies debutant Shamar Joseph has dismissed Steve Smith with his first ball as a Test cricketer to put a dampener on the Aussie's much lauded move to opener. All eyes were on Smith on Wednesday after Australia dismissed the West Indies for 188 after Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins ripped through the batting line-up.\n\nFor the first time in his illustrious career, Smith opened the batting having taken over from David Warner after his retirement earlier this month. Smith has been keen for the new challenge and the opportunity to carve out more history at Test level, but his much-hyped shift came crashing down at the hands of debutant Joseph.\n\n'SAME EXCUSES': Glenn Maxwell and Shane Warne called out in ugly drama\n\nGOOD TO SEE: Cricket fans delighted by Meg Lanning development\n\nSmith was on 12 runs when the fast bowler took the ball after the opening spell. And Joseph delivered with his very first ball. Smith chased the offside delivery and the extra bit of speed prompted him to edge it to second slip.\n\nThe West Indies erupted with joy for Joseph having taken a dream debut wicket of one of this generation's best batters. \"That will go down in the record books for that young man,\" Brendon Julian said in Fox Sports commentary. Ian Bishop described the wicket as a 'fairytale' for the young bowler.\n\nJospeh is just the second West Indian debutant to take a wicket with their first ball in Test cricket since Tyrell Johnson in 1939. Jospeh then took the wicket of Marnus Labuschagne with a classy bouncer caught on the boundary. For Smith, it marks a poor start to his new challenge as opener after still only scoring one half-century this summer.\n\nSmith's average has now fallen below 58 for the first time since 2016. Smith deserves plenty of time and respect for his decision to move up the order to allow Cameron Green to slot back into the starting XI at No.4. However, many fans felt Smith's struggles might continue up the order after his first experience against the new Kookaburra.\n\nMatt Renshaw development stuns cricket fans\n\nMeanwhile, the decision to allow Matt Renshaw to leave the squad and play for the Brisbane Heat in the Big Bash League this Friday has confused fans. Renshaw was selected to join the Aussie squad for the series against West Indies as the reserve batter.\n\nWhile many felt Cameron Bancroft should have been in the squad, his selection did cause backlash. And now, Renshaw confirmed he will be leaving the squad on Friday to play the game against the Adelaide Strikers. Cricket Australia later confirmed the news and said Renshaw would return on Saturday morning.\n\nThis will leave Australia without a recognised batter in the squad in case they need a concussion substitute. Australia have needed to use two substitute concussions in the past, one in which saw Labuscghange come in for the injured Smith against England in the Ashes. This kickstarted Labuscghange's long-run in the Test side."
