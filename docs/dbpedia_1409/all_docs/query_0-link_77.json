        "text": "Well Ricky Ponting has finally declared here in Hobart with the Tigers scoring 8/465 off 109 overs. The Bushrangers will have a difficult 20minute session tonight before commencing tommorrow. Defence and preservation will be the order for the rest of the day.\n\nAttachments\n\naaaa.jpg\n\nbbbbb.jpg\n\nccccccccc.jpg\n\nStumps on Day 2\n\n1st Inn TAS 123\n\n1st Inn VIC 45\n\n2nd Inn Tas 8/465 dec\n\n2nd Inn Vic 0/11\n\nVictoria require 532 runs to win\n\nMoss 4 (16) no\n\nElliott 6 (20) no\n\nVictoria have survived a trying last 20 minutes here without loss and have overnight to consider if they will risk it all and go for outright points or shut up shop and play defencive and conceed a first innings loss. We had a excellent days cricket here that saw three batsmen reach centuries with Michael DiVenuto going on to make a double century. Well tommorrow morning Tassie will be looking for early wickets to try and get a crack at this fairly long Victorian tail. Looking foward to tommorrows play and i hope you will join us then.\n\nHopaWhitey said:\n\nWOW great bowling then awsome batting from the tigers. WELL DONE\n\ncheers mate.... hope your enjoying the story.\n\nIf anyone has suggestion for me to improve the storey or presentation please post comments..\n\nShould be another update very soon.\n\nStart of play Day 3\n\nWelcome to Hobart for the start of the third days action. The home side are in the box seat here with Victoria needing a hefty 532 runs for victory. However the Victorians are yet to loose a wicket and batted very well late yesterday afternoon to survive the last session without loss. The batsmen are making there way out to the centre, with Elliott on 6 and Moss on 4.\n\nEarly wickets will be the order of the day here for the tigers let see how they go.\n\nAttachments\n\n1.jpg\n\n2.jpg\n\n3.jpg\n\nLunch Day 3\n\n1st Inn TAS 123\n\n1st Inn VIC 45\n\n2nd Inn Tas 8/465 dec\n\n2nd Inn Vic 2/64\n\nVictoria require 479 runs to win.\n\nElliott 38 (108) no\n\nMoss 18 (92)\n\nDownton 1/12\n\nBrown 1/2\n\nA slow first session here today with the Victorians shutting up shop really before the day even begun. The Bushrangers playing very safety cricket leaving anthing off line and defending the good balls. Mathew Elliott has so far been the shineing light, in a gloomy match, for the Vics. Tassie will be on full attack here in the second session of the day and hoping to put a big dint in this Victorian defencive armour.\n\nAttachments\n\n1.jpg\n\nEnd of the match\n\n1st Inn TAS 123\n\n1st Inn VIC 45\n\n2nd Inn Tas 8/465 dec\n\n2nd Inn Vic 97\n\nTasmania win by 446 runs\n\nMan of the Match: Anton Brown\n\nWell the tasmanians have completly smashed the Victorians here in the opening pura cup match of the season. Young American Anton Brown was named man of the match in his first class debut. Michael DiVenuto also deserves a special mention for his double century. Ponting also scored an important hundred in a vital captains knock and as we have just seen here in the last session Buttersworth has taken a match wining 5 wicket haul.\n\nThats all we have here from Hobart we look forward to joining you again shortly for what looks like going to be a super summer of Australian domestic cricket.\n\nAttachments\n\n22.jpg"
