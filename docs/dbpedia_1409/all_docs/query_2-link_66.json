        "text": "Mens\n\nCoach: Paul Woodford\n\nCaptain: Jack Clayton\n\nHome Ground: WEP Harris Oval\n\n2023 Placing: 12th\n\nThe students are never far away from being one of the top sides, so don’t expect their mediocre 2023/24 campaign to be repeated. They welcome back Jack Carty from Ireland and Will Sanders from Tasmania, both as recruits. Carty is a hard hitting all-rounder and will look to take down opposition bowlers with the Sydney Thunder’s scintillating Oliver Davies. Renegade David Moody joins to create a fearsome bowling unit with Matt Willans, Callum Henderson and former Valley bowler Don Whyte. Angus Lovell, Alecz Day, Bryce Street, Max and Jack Clayton will provide the bulk of the students scoring.\n\nPlayers to Watch\n\nBrayden Meegama is his side’s only front line spinner and will have an enormous job to do. The leg spinner is an emerging talent, playing in the Queensland U19 side last year, and this year’s KFC T20 Max could be his to own.\n\nWhile he has played Big Bash, Jack Clayton has never locked down a spot and will use the campaign to show selectors he can perform in the format. Able to anchor an innings, Clayton will steer his side through both captaincy and batting performance. Expect plenty of time at the crease from the UQ captain.\n\nWomens\n\nCoach: Anthony Clarke\n\nCaptain: Anlo van Deventer\n\nHome Ground: WEP Harris Oval\n\n2023 Placing: 3rd\n\nSemi finalists last year, the University of Queensland again loom as a competition heavyweight. Queensland Fire and Brisbane Heat star Nicola Hancock will again lead the students bowling, while former Kath Smith medallist Tara Wheeler will roll out her leg spin and provide middle order security. Experienced English all-rounder Laura Marshall will look to make her mark down under. They welcome up and coming Kiwi Emma Black, who last year represented New Zealand A as a medium pacer. 18 year old South Australian Eleanor Larosa will provide a point of difference as a left handed all-rounder. UQ will be looking to use the first innings momentum to help win games with their all-rounder heavy roster.\n\nPlayers to Watch\n\nCharli Knott announced herself last season as a premier player at state level, and will look to take her abilities to another level this year. Fresh off playing in The Hundred in the UK, Charli’s a triple threat very capable of winning matches nearby herself and inspire her side to silverware.\n\nMaddie Penna will again bring championship confidence after back to back titles with the Strikers. Still only 23, Penna has a wealth of experience and is one of the competitions premier all-rounders. She finished last year’s T20 Max inside the top 10 for runs, wickets and catches. Expect a similarly exceptional output from her this campaign."
