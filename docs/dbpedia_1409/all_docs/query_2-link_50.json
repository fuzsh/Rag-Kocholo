        "text": "NSW have taken a 49-run first-innings lead over Tasmania in their Sheffield Shield clash at Blacktown.\n\nThe Tigers' tail wagged thanks to some big hitting from Luke Butterworth (49 from 76) and solid support from No.11 Sam Rainbird (16 not out).\n\nTasmania were eventually bowled out for 239 early on day three, chasing the Blues' total of 288, but the visitors importantly added 44 runs to their overnight score for the final wicket.\n\nNathan Lyon finally ended the innings for NSW when the Australian spinner had Butterworth caught and bowled in the 98th over.\n\nBlues fast bowler Doug Bollinger was the star for the home side, finishing with figures of 6-62 after a stellar performance on day two.\n\nThe left-armer can bring himself back into Test contention with a strong start to the season, given Australia's fast-bowling injury dramas.\n\nThe wicket is tipped to deteriorate over the final two days, meaning Tasmania will need to restrict NSW in the second innings to prevent a big chase on the final day.\n\nAAP"
