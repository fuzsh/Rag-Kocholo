        "text": "There's a glow about Shane Warne. It's in his snowy mane, his evenly-tanned face, eyes of devilment and all the way down to the tips of his nicotine-bronze spinning fingers. As he nears the end of his remarkable career, Warne is a phenomenon waiting to be cast in gold for posterity.\n\nThe boy from Fern Tree Gully is not quite ready for the plinth just yet, though. All wit and mischief, he's a flesh-and-blood Aussie who likes a punt, a drink and making good batsmen look stupid. He has misbehaved and he has charmed. He has broken down four times in his career, survived self-doubt, scandal and disappointment. He was even dropped once. And he's 32. We should enjoy him while we can.\n\nWhen Warne passed 400 Test wickets in the fifth Ashes Test in August, he fairly laid claim to being recognised as the finest leg-spinner in the history of the game, whatever the judgment of Donald Bradman, who couldn't find a place for him in his all-time XI - at least according to a widely-discussed book published this summer after his death.\n\n'I can't bowl better than that,' Warne said of his second-innings performance against England, a hint that there might not be much left to achieve, or to prove. Still, you suspect that if he gets within a series or two of 500 wickets, he will stroll up to the stumps in those awful flares for a few more grunts and puffs. He doesn't rule it out. And he hinted he might even come to live in England, winding down his career with a second spell in county cricket with Hampshire. The day the rest of the Australians were packing up to fly home after another route march through England, Warne relaxed in the team's London hotel, happy to reflect on the career journey so far, his haul of 31 wickets in the series and to ruminate on where cricket might take him yet.\n\nAny tiredness that stilled his bounciness might have had more to do with the publication of his second book - during the last days of the tour, he spent his off-field hours pre-signing 30,000 copies - than his exertions at The Oval a few days earlier.\n\nOr maybe it was the celebrations that followed. As my colleague John Reardon moved about to snatch a relaxed profile of him, Warne noticed out of the corner of his eye a whisky glass from the night before (one presumes) sitting on the window ledge beside him. Cigarette butts floated on the liquor in an ugly mess, and, as if drawing a batsman on to a false shot, Warne manouevred the glass out of camera shot. As open and friendly as he can be, he is sensitive about how he is perceived. 'My life is a like a soap opera,' he said in a rare interview two years ago, since which time he has added a few episodes.\n\nIt was his Ferrari-driven image and the allegations, since dismissed, that he was on the take from Asian bookmakers that ruined his hopes of captaining Australia at Test level. The Australian cricket establishment is as reactionary as they come, and the wild colonial boy from Melbourne knew he didn't have much rope to play with.\n\n'Your whole life is getting judged every day by different people,' he says. 'That's why I wanted to do an autobiography, to set the record straight and give the public who've supported me - and even the people who don't like me - an opportunity to say, \"Ah, is that what happened?\"' It's a rosy thought. More likely, people will still think what they like. Take Warne's published version of how he took a gift of $5,000 from a total stranger in a Sri Lankan casino in 1994. Warne says he had just dropped that amount at roulette when Mark Waugh introduced him to a man called 'John', who made up the loss 'as a token of appreciation' and 'with no strings attached'. There followed the usual sucker phone calls from 'John', inquiring about pitch conditions etc. Warne still had no inkling of a sting, he says.\n\nA few months later, the Pakistan batsman Salim Malik asked Warne and Waugh to throw a Test match. Warne says even then he struggled to make a connection between the two incidents. What followed was either farce or conspiracy - we will probably never know. The Australian Cricket Board, to their eternal shame, secretly fined the players then covered it up until the papers prised the story out of them.\n\nDiplomatically, perhaps, Warne is charitable in letting the board off the hook for 'keeping it in-house', as the euphemism goes. Much good it did him. The old board went; the new administration took the vice-captaincy off him. Many Australians - as hardened to the ways of the punt as Warne himself has been since his tearaway teens - did not believe Warne's account of the affair then. Some still don't.\n\nSo, when he fetched up at Hampshire in 2000, it was with the carefree gait of a man having a holiday from the pressures of being an Australian superstar, a 'tall poppy' swaying beneath the scythe of public suspicion at home. He bowled brilliantly, taking more wickets than anyone in division one of the county championship, and scored nearly 500 runs, but the team didn't do well. For Warne that's unfinished business.\n\nOne anecdote, though, is worth repeating before we sit down with the master spin bowler of his era. It started when Australia were fielding during the second Test against Pakistan two years ago in Tasmania, and pitch microphones picked up a voice saying of the Queensland fast bowler Scott Muller: 'Can't bowl, can't throw.' When it was replayed on the nationally televised show The Panel, Warne was accused of sledging his teammate. 'Everyone,' said a source close to the team at the time, 'wanted to believe it was Warnie.'\n\nWarne was distraught. He rang Muller to clear the air and the fast bowler told him to 'Fuck off'. 'I just happened to be bowling,' Warne says, 'and got the blame for something that someone else said. Most of my life people want it to be me. It was huge in Australia. It's a pretty ugly sort of time when one of your teammates doesn't believe you.'\n\nA sound technician working on the broadcast of the Test owned up to making the remark. It didn't convince everyone. During the following Test in Perth, Malcolm Conn, the chief cricket writer of the Australian, demanded of his colleagues in the press box: 'Right, hands up those who don't think it was Warne who said it.'\n\nMartin Blake, covering the Test for the Melbourne Age, Warne's hometown paper, put his hand up.\n\n'You're a goose,' Conn said.\n\nBlake, said by those who know him to be a placid man, leapt to his feet and grabbed Conn by his credentials. As he snapped the chain holding Conn's plastic ID, he shouted, with no doubt unintentionally comic gravitas: 'Don't ever call me a goose.'\n\nConn, not normally someone quick to take a backward step, according to colleagues, saw Blake's raised fist and apologised. Conn's paper subsequently employed a voice specialist to analyse the tape, and he determined the voice was not Warne's. Conn remains unconvinced to this day. But he and Blake are still firm friends.\n\nSuch passion over a trivial matter describes many things about Australians and sport, not the least of them being the poor opinion held of the common goose. And it showed how Warne can divide opinions, whatever his iconic status on the field.\n\nFor a sportsman of such undeniable talent, he is viewed with ambiguity in his own country. His many fans (not all of them Victorians) are ardent in their admiration of cricket's most interesting renegade. Older Australians consider him 'a two-bob mug lair', all bleach and trousers. No wonder he likes coming to England.\n\nYet what emerged more than any other impression during our conversation was Warne's love of his craft. He doesn't care for the spotlight or the controversy, as he knows they will pass soon enough. What cannot be erased are his skill and achievements with a cricket ball. He reserved his most animated exchanges to talk about his zooters and flippers and sliders, his strategy and philosophy on leg-spin, his dedication to an art that was dying until, thankfully, he came among us a decade ago.\n\n'I enjoy touring this country,' he said, 'it's just a great place to play cricket. I could easily live here, I love it. The crowd really get behind you. Sometimes in Australia they look for the negatives, the bad things. Over here it's a bit more positive.'\n\nWarne acknowledges what everyone knows: domestic cricket in Australia is better, but the county game is more demanding. He and his Hampshire teammates worked out that they'd play something like 50 games, compared to 15 in Australia. 'So that's three seasons of cricket packed into one less month!'\n\nWarne believes - as do most players - that this workload, 'breeds people who pace themselves. Fast bowlers can't run in and bowl fast every day. A lot of players are comfortable just playing county cricket, with the sponsored car, good salary, all the perks.' It is not the way he grew up. 'In Australia,' he says, 'everything you do is about attitude. The attitude is simple: you want to be the best cricketer you can be, and everyone's aim - everyone's - is to play for Australia. Over here, from an outsider looking in, I just don't think that's everyone's ambition, playing county cricket.'\n\nWarne wasn't always besotted by cricket. A reserve-team player with St Kilda, his dream was to be an Aussie Rules footballer. But, after a surprise call-up to the Test team in 1991, his life changed.\n\n'Once I had a taste for it, I thought, \"Right, this is my life.\" I tried to become the best player I could. I spoke to a lot of people: Ian Chappell, Terry Jenner, Rod Marsh, Jack Potter, Bob Paulsen. And I trained my butt off. \"If I'm not good enough,\" I thought, \"I'm not good enough.\" And in those early days I didn't think I was good enough. Then, Boxing Day in '92 against the West Indies I got seven for 52 and helped us win the game. Since then, the last nine years have been¿'\n\nPretty good?\n\n'Pretty good, yeah. Haven't been too bad.'\n\nWarne says he has had his happiest times against England. Yet you felt he was sorry the oldest enemy let themselves down this summer. 'They didn't play their best, although we didn't allow them to get involved in the game too often. They had their opportunities in the first couple of Tests, but they dropped too many catches, crucial catches. They dropped Damien Martyn on 10 at Edgbaston. They dropped Adam Gilchrist maybe five or six times. They lost wickets just before breaks, like 10 or 15 minutes before lunch or tea, say. They'd expose a new batsman. That really hurt them a lot. As soon as there was a moment, we would up a gear and really drive it home.'\n\nMaybe he'd seen a young English spinner worth following, I wondered. Maybe not. 'At the moment?¿ Hmm¿ There's a young kid at Durham, I saw on the TV the other week. A little fellow. He bowled very, very well. Can't remember his name [Graeme Bridge]. Left-arm spinner. [Ashley] Giles is economical, I just don't know if he's a matchwinner, if he's going to come out and take seven-for. He's a good foil for Gough and Caddick, though, so he's an important part of their team. Uhm¿ England are lacking a real good spinner and another quality batsman.' He thinks the full and healthy return of Craig White will make England a 'very good, balanced side'. What, though, of his fellow leg-spinners, Ian Salisbury and Chris Schofield? He was as kind as he was fair.\n\n'Salisbury, unfortunately, just hasn't been able to crack it. He's a good bowler. But he hasn't been able to make that step up, I don't know why, I don't know him well enough. And he bowls the wrong'un as his control ball - which people are going to pick. You've got to have different ways of getting people out. Schofield, from what I've seen, bowls too many loose balls, but the ball leaves his hand pretty well. He's only young, so it could be worth sticking with him. Handy batter. Good fielder. Pretty confident sort of bloke.'\n\nSounds familiar.\n\nWarne famously survived a stormy introduction to the big-time at the Australian Cricket Academy, an institution now regarded as the template for all schools of learning. He thinks the poaching of the academy's Rod Marsh by England was a coup that might even rebound on Australia in the future.\n\n'It's a huge loss for Australian cricket. He's just been fantastic. I'm not sure who's going to fill his spot but, for England, it's a huge positive. I was disappointed to hear that a few [English] players were not happy that he was going to come here. My first thought was, \"Well what do they think of having a Zimbabwean coach already?\" Whoever got Rod Marsh to agree to be English academy coach - I think it was Hugh Morris - pulled something out of the bag, let me tell you.'\n\nIt is interesting to hear a reformed rebel extol the virtues of the disciplinarian Marsh. But they are more similar than is obvious at first glance. Both bring commitment and passion to their cricket. Marsh, a former schoolteacher who grew up understanding - even sympathising with - the larrikin tendencies of boisterous Australians, will not, however, cut England's young academy students much slack in Adelaide this winter.\n\n'If anyone wants to muck around or think they're going out there on a bit of a holiday,' advises Warne, 'they'll be on a plane, coming straight home in a week. You've got to be prepared to work hard, be on time, disciplined and all those sort of things. If you're not, he won't tolerate it.' But, he says, it will be worth the sacrifice. 'I'm telling you, there'll be half a dozen cricketers who come out of that academy who'll play for England, for sure.'\n\nWhat Shane Warne really loves talking about is his art, his wonderful wrist-spin. I asked him about his walk-up bowling action, his huge shoulder rip and how this slightly pedestrian, inelegant method sets him apart from other leg-spinners. It is the secret to his genius. 'I didn't have to think about it. Your run-up is just you. You have to feel comfortable with it. Some people like to run in, some like to bound in. I like to walk in and build my momentum through the crease.'\n\nHe agrees that Stuart MacGill, who will surely inherit his place eventually, spins it even more sharply than he does. 'He's a lot more round-arm, bowls a lot flatter. He gets big turn, which is good. The advantage I've got over most other leg-spinners is my drift. That's what plays on a batsman's mind as he's playing the shot, the drift. Shahid Afridi gets the drift, but there aren't too many other leg-spinners who do. It floats away, and they have to second-guess the shot. They think it's there but it's not.'\n\nInternational cricket (England apart) is blessed with a crop of wonderful spinners and Warne revealed how they are constantly trading secrets.\n\n'Myself and Saqlain Mushtaq have swapped quite a few bits of information; myself and Mushtaq [Ahmed] have as well. Mushy showed me one of his wrong'uns, and I showed him how to bowl my flipper. Saqlain showed me how he bowls his \"other one\", and I showed him the flipper too. So he's trying to develop a flipper and I'm trying to develop an off-spinner, also one that can go the other way.'\n\nThis is Saqlain's mystery ball, unpickable by many.\n\n'It's like a genuine off-spinner. So I bowl my leggies and wrong'uns, and then bowl an off-spinner, and then bowl this \"other one\" that looks like an off-spinner but goes the other way.' Ask him how many deliveries there are in the Warne repertoire at the moment and it's like listening to a kid describing the contents a box of chocolates.\n\n'You've got your leg-spinner, your wrong'un, your flipper, your top-spinner, slider, zooter. Six main deliveries and there are variations of each. You can bowl more over-spin on your leg-break [for extra bounce], you can try to turn the ball more - or less - you can bowl it flatter, slower, with more loop, wide of the crease, close to the stumps, middle of the crease, around the wicket¿ so there's lots of variations.'\n\nEasy for you to say, mush.\n\nWhile we look on in amazement at his wizardry, Warne realises top-flight batsmen can 'pick him' from the hand. 'Yeah, I've played against them long enough. Generally, the good batsman will pick everything you bowl to him, but then he's got to play it - and nobody knows how far it's going to spin, or how it's going to bounce because you've got the in-built variation of playing on grass, which is one of your biggest advantages. So you throw in a bit of drift, a bit of natural variation off the wicket¿ sometimes I'm not sure.'\n\nThere is one batsman above all others he enjoys matching wits against.\n\n'Sachin Tendulkar is the hardest bloke I've ever had to bowl to, because he picks up the length so quickly. If you're a fraction short, he'll hit you for four, if you're a fraction full, he'll run down and hit you for four as well. Your margin for error is nowhere near as much as it would be with lesser batsmen.'\n\nBut no individual exists alone in cricket. There is the catching, the team effort, the sense of common purpose. Despite occasional bust-ups (the most recent coming at the end of the Ashes tour, when Warne's mate, Michael Slater, was dropped for general carousing), this Australian team have it in abundance. And they owe much to Steve Waugh, who beat Warne to the captaincy after Mark Taylor's retirement.\n\nWarne is closer to Steve's twin, Mark, and he has not always agreed with the captain - but you will not winkle an ounce of dissent out of him. When Waugh, en route to the Ashes, took the Australians to Gallipoli, the site of Anzac heroics in World War I, Warne overcame any natural cynicism about it being an exercise in naffness.\n\n'I didn't really know much about Gallipoli. I knew the basics, from school, but I was never a very good listener at school. I never really understood. Then, actually being there, standing there and seeing how far they had to run with their backpacks through the water, dark at night, through the grass¿ And walking among the graves - seeing 17 and 18-year-old kids, when you've got young children of your own. It's just unbelievable to think what they¿ standing in some of those ditches, with their mates just falling on top of them, and they know they've got to go out there and die. If you asked someone to do that now, it would be, \"Stick it, mate. I'm not doin' that.\" It showed you what Australia meant to them. It made us understand a lot more what Australia means to all of us.'\n\nAs for personal glory, he's always said bowling landmarks mean little to him. But he must be tempted to play on to the point where his claim to being recognised as the finest bowler of them all is unassailable. He's not sure.\n\n'One of the sacrifices that we make is our time away from home. We had a full Australian summer. I was in Melbourne for about 10 days. We then had one day at the end of the one-day series, a medal night, one day off. The next day we left for India for 10-and-a-half weeks. Four weeks off, then we came to England for four-and-a-bit months. We get back and we start in October again. I didn't see my son until he was six months old.'\n\nWarne's mobile rings. It's playing 'Waltzing Matilda'. Like all international cricketers, he hates hotel rooms, and he misses his family. 'But the good side is not everyone can spend so much time doing what they love doing. I love playing cricket. Never used to. I'm lucky that I get well paid for it. I'm very grateful.'\n\nAnd he'd like to finish up at his second home, Hampshire. 'I couldn't see myself with another county. Obviously, if there was a super offer, I'd have to consider it. But they've become great mates.'\n\nGiles White and Will Kendall spent some of the last Australian summer with Warne at his Melbourne home. Robin Smith, the Hampshire captain, he describes as 'the nicest guy I've met in cricket'.\n\nSo, the Rose Bowl beckons.\n\n'Maybe that's at the end of my career. But I'd never hang around if I felt I'm not good enough, or not enjoying it. I'd like to go out on my terms. I think I've earned that. If it means leaving probably a little bit earlier than I should, I'll take that. It will be a sad day because it's been my life since I was 18.'\n\nHe's spoken to retired friends in the game, Merv Hughes and Allan Border, and agrees with them that what he will miss most will be 'the dressing room, the camaraderie. Not the spotlight, not at all.'\n\nThe spotlight shone slightly to the side of him when the Bradman team was announced. Was he upset at being omitted? There is a pause. I've clearly touched a nerve and Warne is careful with his response.\n\n'Look, it doesn't worry me if I've been left out or not. But¿ I'm just a bit sceptical about it. I don't know if it's actually Bradman's team. I just don't see it. Bradman was the greatest cricketer ever, and he picked Don Tallon in the so-called Bradman team batting at six, averaging 18. With four specialist batsmen! I don't think Don Bradman would pick that sort of team. If he did, he did¿you never know. I've got my doubts, that's all. Also, he's on record as saying Jack Hobbs is the best batsman he's ever seen. Yet he didn't pick him.' Warne met Bradman, along with Tendulkar, at his Adelaide home on the great man's ninetieth birthday. He speaks with reverence about the experience. 'I'm sure you'd put Don Bradman in any team now and he'd still kill everyone.'\n\nAs we finish up, John gives him a ball to spin for the camera. He wants to get a few more shots outside. Warne sighs. They're already queuing up for him at an Oxford Street bookshop. But he does it, smiling and bronze. Besides, he's got an autobiography to push. This is part of the gig. I remind him of a time four years ago when he was due to give a clinic to some kids at a school near Headingley.\n\n'God, yeah. Well, as we were leaving the hotel in London to go up, someone from Buckingham Palace rang up and said the Queen wanted to invite us around for a cup of tea. You could hardly say no. So we went¿ Still, we made it up to Headingley in the end, a couple of hours late.' When he arrived, they were still waiting. The big kid with the gunslinger's name twirled and chatted away into the twilight, over after over, his floppy blond head as shiny as the little kids gathered around him, every one a disciple.\n\nTo order a copy of Shane Warne: My Autobiography for £15.99 plus p&p (Hodder & Stoughton, £18.99), call the OSM book service on 0870 066 7989."
