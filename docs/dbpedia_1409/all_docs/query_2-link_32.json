(Matt Turner/AAP PHOTOS)\n\nPowerhouse Western Australia have stamped themselves Australian cricket's premier team of the 2020s after securing their third straight Sheffield Shield with a 377-run dismantling of Tasmania in a lopsided final.\n\nSubscribe now for unlimited access .\n\nor signup to continue reading\n\nAll articles from our website & app\n\nThe digital version of Today's Paper\n\nBreaking news alerts direct to your inbox\n\nInteractive Crosswords, Sudoku and Trivia\n\nAll articles from the other in your area\n\nAfter setting the Tigers a near-impossible target of 537 at tea on day four at the WACA Ground on Sunday, veteran seamer Cameron Gannon (5-23) led a lethal bowling performance for WA, who took 10 wickets in an extended third session to rout the visitors for just 160.\n\nWA officially extended their dynasty - sealing an unprecedented 'triple double' with their hat-trick of titles complemented by their three straight Marsh Cup one-day trophies - when Tasmanian tail-ender Iain Carlisle fell to a diving screamer by Joel Paris at gully off a Gannon bouncer.\n\nCaptain Jordan Silk offered the only real resistance with a counterpunching 46 for the Tigers, whose unlikely pursuit of the mammoth target started horribly when they nosedived to 3-26 through the losses of Matthew Wade (3), Charlie Wakim (15) and Caleb Jewell (8).\n\nSkipper Sam Whiteman was named player of the match for his enterprising first-innings 104, which set up WA's 347 after being sent in by the Tigers, who fell well behind the eight-ball when they replied with 186.\n\n\"I feel incredibly lucky just to be a part of this group,\" Whiteman said.\n\n\"What we've achieved over the last few years has been just amazing.\n\n\"Long may it continue.\"\n\nFormer Test wicketkeeper Wade, who has announced his retirement from first-class cricket, walked off to generous applause after enduring a forgettable swansong.\n\nThe 36-year-old made one in the first-innings and was dismissed cheaply again in the second, charging Gannon but only succeeding in nicking to WA gloveman Josh Inglis.\n\nSilk also edged one to Inglis before Hilton Cartwright took a pair of catches to dismiss Jake Doran (31) and Shield player of the season Beau Webster (19).\n\nGannon trapped Jarrod Freeman plumb in front for a second-ball duck before Corey Rocchiccioli spun through the tail, following his first-innings 4-48 with 3-55.\n\nTaking match figures of 8-61, Gannon also played a role with the bat with his lusty 42 at No.10 lifting WA to 376.\n\nHilton Cartwright (94) top-scored in the second innings for the hosts, who continued to grind Tasmania into the ground.\n\nAustralian Associated Press\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAd\n\nGet the latest Wollongong news in your inbox\n\nSign up for our newsletter to stay up to date.\n\nEmail address\n\nWe care about the protection of your data.
