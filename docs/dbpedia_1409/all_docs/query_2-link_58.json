        "text": "A Coach?s Blog\n\nArticle by Jono Choie\n\n1 November 2010\n\nHello and welcome to the first of hopefully many blog entries which I will be posting as I continue through my first season as coach of Tasmania. Thanks to PlanetCricket for letting me use this space to post details about my life as head coach at Tasmania.\n\nA bit of background first: My name is Jono Choie, known by my nickname ?Chewie?, and earlier this year I was appointed as the new coach of the Tasmanian Tigers following the stepping down of long time coach Tim Coyle. I had been a long time cricket follower back in New Zealand, supporting the Northern Districts Knights. When I learnt that the Central Districts coaching job had been vacated by Dermot Reeve, I said to myself that it couldn?t be too difficult coaching a domestic team and applied for the job. This was all despite me having no coaching experience at all. While I didn?t get the job, Tasmania were looking for a coach at the same time, saw that I had applied and decided that I must have been half decent if I had been trying for the Central Districts role. They signed me up without looking into my background at all, and so I packed up and moved to Tasmania.\n\nWorking with players such as Tim Paine, Travis Birt, Ben Hilfenhaus and Ricky Ponting especially has been an incredibly rewarding experience so far. They have aided me in coaching the rest of the team on how to improve their game, so that we can become a successful unit. Ponting and Hilfenhaus bring a lot of experience to the side, when they?re not away on international duty, and in the months since I was signed up and the season began, we have worked together to achieve a good team spirit.\n\nAs you probably are aware, we haven?t had the best start to the season. My first game in charge was a Sheffield Shield match against South Australia, who are often called the worst team in the tournament. It was only thanks to George Bailey and Brett Geeves we managed to escape that match with a draw. Our first one day match was a close one, which we lost due to some inspired bowling from Shaun Tait in the dying overs of the match. Our second Ford Ranger Cup match was a huge improvement, though at the innings interval it seemed like we were bound for a massive loss. Once again Geeves saved us, scoring 49 in the first innings, and then backing that up with his best one-day bowling effort as we left the match with maximum points. I would have posted a blog earlier, but I felt that it would be blasted with disapproving comments from Tasmanian supporters due to my poor efforts as coach. Now that we have won a match, and in such convincing style, hopefully the comments will be on a more positive note.\n\nOur next match of the season is a Sheffield Shield match against Queensland. We will be looking to carry forward our momentum from the one-day match against them through into this game and take advantage of their weak batting attack. I have named a few changes from our last first class match, due to Ponting and Mark Cosgrove being away on international duty. In their places, Steven Cazzulino and Jonathan Wells get their opportunity to shine, while Gerard Denton takes Adam Griffith?s place. I expect them to keep the same side as the last match, and if we play as well as our last game, we should be able to walk away with a win. Wish us luck!\n\nâ€‹\n\nQueensland v Tasmania, Sheffield Shield, The Gabba\n\nCarseldine and Cutting Ruin Great Start by Tasmania\n\nNovember 2, 2010\n\nTasmania 274/9 (Bailey 76, Birt 63, Carseldine 3-38)\n\nTasmania struggled again to play a comprehensive innings with the bat as they finished the first day of their Sheffield Shield match against Queensland on 274/9. Butterworth and Hilfenhaus are still at the crease, but with Hilfenhaus? skills with the bat unknown, it should only be a matter of time before Queensland are batting. In the first two sessions it didn?t seem like Tasmania would struggle to make a competitive total, being 225/4 at once stage. Cutting and Carseldine bowled superbly to instigate a middle order collapse.\n\nHaving won the toss, Queensland decided to chuck the Tasmanian batsman onto the crease in overcast conditions. Cazzulino played a number of graceful shots, with Cowan playing a much more defensive innings at the other end. Cazzulino was eventually bowled by Feldman with the stumps being splayed everywhere.\n\nCazzulino is bowledâ€‹\n\nBailey entered to the crease and got off to an impressive start, fluently striking the ball, while Cowan continued to be content playing defensive strokes and leaving the ball. Bailey soon overtook Cowan in the run scoring column as Cowan?s strike rate hovered around 25. On the stroke of lunch however Cowan was caught behind off Harris, leaving the score at 73/2. On his return from lunch Bailey wacked a six over the top of silly mid on?s head. He then hit a straight drive down the ground to bring up his 50. His good run of form couldn?t last forever however, caught at first slip on 76 from only 109 balls.\n\nBailey hits a six\n\nBailey is caught at first slipâ€‹\n\nMeanwhile, at the other end Birt had been matching Bailey stroke for stroke, as he too brought up his half century, two balls before the tea break. He had played more defensively than Bailey overall, but was just as good to watch. At the other end, Wells was attempting to impress the selectors as he smashed a six off Feldman. Birt was caught at the beginning of the last session, but Tasmania looked in a strong position at 225/4.\n\nBirt plays a drive down the ground\n\nBirt gets caught by a fielder facing the wrong way\n\nâ€‹\n\nDoolan came in, but was dismissed immediately, lbw off Feldman, Wells fell shortly afterwards, out LBW, and Paine followed them both, caught behind to a great catch by Hartley. Tasmania had collapsed to 233/7.\n\nDenton out LBW\n\nPaine caught behind to a great catchâ€‹\n\nBrett Geeves, the saviour of the innings many times before came to the crease, but was dismissed for two, while Denton managed only one. Hilfenhaus and Butterworth managed to survive to the end of the day however, putting on 31 for the last wicket at the close of play. Tasmania will be hoping that the last partnership continues for a while, before the Queensland batting lineup get bowled over by Geeves as in the Ford Ranger Cup match.\n\nâ€‹\n\nSorry for the size of the images, I forgot to resize them down. I probably won't include too many images next time, it makes the page take a while to load, and it uses up a lot of my time. The pictures also mean that I write less, and as it's a story, I don't feel that the images should take precedent over the writing.\n\nAlso sorry for the lack of updates. Been a bit busy with uni work, as well as the Worcestershire story, and I'll be starting the Champion's League soon which will also take up time. I've also been doing a lot of stuff in the ICC2010 subforum which has been taking my time."
