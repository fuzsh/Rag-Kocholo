It is such a shame Swan is having a Barry Crocker in the Shield, because he's dynamite in the limited overs stuff. Good contributions from all the batsmen but Carseldine and Philipson set up a good score. Swan then ripped through their middle and lower orders and would have had a hat trick had I given him a slip to Geeves. As it was he snared three in four balls.\n\nWe sit second after three games, but our NRR is massive so if we can get level with Victoria we'll be on top.\n\nBad news, though.

If WA win they'll jump above us, so it'll be on SA to beat NSW to save our blushes.\n\nWA went on to beat NSW and then Victoria to win the final. The Vics posted 4-182 off their 20 overs thanks to Hodge's 69 and McDonald's 48*. WA chased it down with eight wickets in hand and 16 balls to spare as Marsh cracked 93* off 55.\n\nA McDonald 3.2-0-43-0\n\nNice Ronny.\n\nSheffield Shield: New South Wales vs. Queensland\n\nNew South Wales\n\nPhil Jaques\n\n*Simon Katich\n\nBen Rohrer\n\nDominic Thornely\n\nPeter Forrest\n\nDavid Warner\n\n+Brad Haddin\n\nNathan Bracken\n\nStuart Clark\n\nDoug Bollinger\n\nBurt ****ley\n\nQueensland\n\nNathan Reardon\n\nWade Townsend\n\nLee Carseldine\n\nChris Lynn\n\n+Chris Hartley\n\n*James Hopes\n\nJason Floros (FC debut)\n\nChris Swan\n\nRyan Harris\n\nCameron Boyce\n\nScott Walter\n\nIN: Floros, Reardon, Swan, Walter\n\nOUT: Broad (omitted), Cutting (omitted), Dunk (omitted), Feldman (injured)\n\nWholesale changes here. Broad has had too many chances and is in danger of being cut next year, while Reardon opens up on the back of some good T20 performances and a dearth of options.

Basically Swan, Feldman and Boyce are all contributing, but Harris and Walter aren't taking wickets. I might bring Rimmington back into the fold because he's taking wickets elsewhere.\n\nTownsend and Hopes held the batting together which is good because considering Carseldine failed we made a couple of good scores. I'll go back to just four bowlers next game so Dunk will probably come back in. Hartley failed at the top, but he'll have to stay there until Reardon is fit.\n\nRyobi One-Day Cup: Tasmania vs. Queensland\n\nTasmania\n\nMark Cosgrove\n\nEd Cowan\n\nRicky Ponting\n\n*George Bailey\n\nTravis Birt\n\n+Tim Paine\n\nLuke Butterworth\n\nBrett Geeves\n\nGerard Denton\n\nBen Hilfenhaus\n\nTim Macdonald\n\nQueensland\n\n+Chris Hartley\n\nWade Townsend\n\nLee Carseldine\n\nChris Lynn\n\nCraig Philipson\n\n*James Hopes\n\nChris Simpson\n\nJason Floros\n\nChris Swan\n\nBen Cutting\n\nLuke Feldman\n\nNO CHANGE\n\nQueensland 9 for 235 (50 ov)\n\nPhilipson 68 (71)\n\nTownsend 54 (75)\n\nHopes 51 (50)\n\nDenton 5-45 (10)\n\nMacdonald 2-38 (10)\n\nGeeves 1-49 (10)\n\nTasmania 207 all out (44.5 ov)\n\nCosgrove 43 (54)\n\nButterworth 35 (47)\n\nBailey 26 (38)\n\nPonting 0 (2)\n\nHopes 3-43 (10)\n\nFloros 2-21 (6)\n\nSimpson 2-30 (6)\n\nQueensland won by 28 runs\n\nMan of the Match: James Hopes\n\nHopes WAG. He and Philipson were great for 103 for the fifth wicket and set up a competitive total, though fairly low. They dug us out of the 4-103 hole at the thirty over mark, though.\n\nTassie started off well with fifty for the first wicket between Cossie and Cowan before Feldman removed Cowan and then Ponting in three balls. Feldman nailed Ponting for a duck second innings of the Shield game and again here, so that's pretty sweet.\n\nThe win is all for nought, though, as with a game to play we sit seven points away from WA and NSW who are 1 and 2 respectively. The final game vs. Victoria is to deny them a spot in the final and to finish outright third. We cannot finish lower than fourth regardless of the result.\n\nAlso, Luke Feldman has been picked for Australia for the World Cup! A very worthy inclusion, I must say. He's been a standout this year with 16 wickets at a touch under twenty and will be a solid backup option.\n\nRyobi One-Day Cup: Queensland vs. Victoria\n\nQueensland\n\n+Chris Hartley\n\nWade Townsend\n\nLee Carseldine\n\nChris Lynn\n\nCraig Philipson\n\n*James Hopes\n\nChris Simpson\n\nJason Floros\n\nChris Swan\n\nBen Cutting\n\nBen Laughlin\n\nIN: Laughlin\n\nOUT: Feldman (Australia)\n\nVictoria\n\nChris Rogers\n\nNick Jewell\n\n*David Hussey\n\n+Mathew Wade\n\nAaron Finch\n\nAndrew McDonald\n\nRob Quiney\n\nDamien Wright\n\nJames Pattinson\n\nMark Cleary\n\nDirk Nannes\n\nVictoria 240 all out (48.3 ov)\n\nQuiney 52 (64)\n\nMcDonald 38 (48)\n\nWright 36 (21)\n\nSwan 4-30 (8.3)\n\nSimpson 3-50 (10)\n\nHopes 2-61 (10)\n\nQueensland 7 for 241 (46.4 ov)\n\nPhilipson 94 (115)\n\nTownsend 80 (101)\n\nHartley 17 (13)\n\nMcDonald 3-52 (10)\n\nWright 2-33 (10)\n\nNannes 2-56 (10)\n\nQueensland won by three wickets (Qld 4, Vic 0)\n\nMan of the Match: Chris Swan\n\nPretty much a two man show in our chase as Townsend and Philipson put on 147 for the fourth wicket. Townsend has been a revalation at the top of the order in the Ryobi Cup this year. His strike rate has been a bit low, but he's made four fifties from eight innings and been a rock. Philipson came back from an awful start to average over 40 with six fifties from 10 innings. Just needed to convert a few more to make this a massive couple of years for the vet.\n\nSwan completes another great limited overs year and I hope he can grab a few wickets in the Shield to end the season. We end up in third with 5 wins, 4 losses and a tie - same as 2009-10 - and I'd say it has been pretty successful after an awful start.\n\nRyobi One-Day Cup: Queensland vs. Victoria\n\nQueensland\n\n+Chris Hartley\n\nWade Townsend\n\nLee Carseldine\n\nChris Lynn\n\nCraig Philipson\n\n*James Hopes\n\nChris Swan\n\nRyan Harris\n\nCameron Boyce\n\nLuke Feldman\n\nScott Walter\n\nIN: Cutting, Floros\n\nOUT: Feldman (Australia), Harris (omitted)\n\nHarris has been a joke this season and had to go!\n\nVictoria\n\nNick Jewell\n\nRob Quiney\n\n*David Hussey\n\n+Mathew Wade\n\nAaron Finch\n\nAndrew McDonald\n\nMichael Hill\n\nRobin Kitson\n\nDamien Wright\n\nMark Cleary\n\nBryce McGain\n\nVictoria 1st innings 542 all out\n\nHussey 241 (446)\n\nJewell 65 (219)\n\nWade 59 (126)\n\nSwan 4-107 (40.5)\n\nWalter 2-85 (26)\n\nBoyce 2-114 (33)\n\nQueensland 1st innings 286 all out\n\nFloros 150* (219)\n\nCutting 35 (88)\n\nHopes 27 (65)\n\nMcGain 4-88 (28)\n\nWright 4-98 (29)\n\nJewell 1-11 (1)\n\nQueensland 2nd innings (following on) 321 all out\n\nTownsend 145* (371)\n\nHartley 61 (78)\n\nCarseldine 32 (117)\n\nCleary 4-72 (26.1)\n\nWright 3-74 (32)\n\nMcDonald 2-62 (23)\n\nMatch drawn (Vic 2, Qld 0)\n\nMan very few positives here. The big one was obviously Jason Floros who, in just his third FC innings, cracked 150* from seven having come to the crease at 5-39. An utterly amazing knock from the young man who also picked up his first FC wicket (Jewell). Townsend also played a fantastic rearguard, but watched as we collapsed from 3-264 to 321 all out. Didn't matter, as we were all out last over of the day.\n\nAfter 8 matches we sit far behind in last with 0 wins, 4 losses and 4 draws. Awful Shield season."
