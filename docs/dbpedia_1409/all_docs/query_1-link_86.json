        "text": "Jaques nicked a delivery from Tasmanian quick Gerard Denton so loudly it could be heard on Merewether Beach. Tasmanian wicketkeeper Tim Paine swallowed the ball with his gloves and the visitors conjured up one of those we-know-he's-out appeals, but Jaques attempted to delay the inevitable. Much was at stake.\n\nHe looked at the crease as if nothing untoward had happened. His heart must have stopped cold. He went so far as to mark his crease as if he were preparing to face another ball. He will get to do so, but it will be in another match. Jaques trudged off again for another worryingly low score and, in his absence, the young whippersnapper Hughes followed his first-innings century with a polished and unbeaten 82.\n\nThe Blues are dominating, even if Tasmania provided nuisance value on day three at Newcastle's No.1 Sportsground. Replying to the Blues' first innings of 4(dec)-521, the Tigers scraped together 328. Test spin hopefuls Nathan Hauritz and Jason Krejza are also having their own showdown, and the New South Welshman has him trumped, taking 4-86 off 43 overs.\n\n\"If I go to South Africa, fantastic, if not, I'm still here playing four-day cricket,\" Hauritz said, adding that he hoped Hughes and Jaques made the trek to South Africa.\n\n\"'Hughesy' has had a fantastic season. He's not doing anything wrong, is he? A great young cricketer. 'Jaquesy' got a hundred in his last Test match, but it's his first game back [from injury] in so long. I think he has got enough experience to go.\"\n\nTasmanian Brett Geeves was left stranded on 99 not out for the second time this season - by the same teammate. Tim MacDonald was the last wicket to fall. He walked off sheepishly.\n\nAfter MacDonald left him one run short of a century against Victoria in November, Geeves wrote on his internet blog: \"Can I start this blog by apologising for Tim MacDonald's woeful display of playing short-pitch bowling? Yes, I'm angry. 99 no and the number eleven gloves a short ball from a guy who is into his 50th over of the match … \"DUCK THE BALL, TIM!! Instead, Tim plays the ball as if someone had inserted a stick of dynamite up his 'Speedy Claxton' [bottom], jumping high into the air and letting out a little squeal, ballooning the ball to first slip. I'm left stuck on 99. One run short of my maiden first class century. One run!\"\n\nGeeves used an analogy to explain his feelings: \"You are one piece away from finishing the 20,000 piece jigsaw puzzle your grandmother brought you for Christmas … Where the (expletives) is it!!??\n\n\"What have I done to deserve this? … Why does the MCG catering staff continue to give us these Macadamia Nut low-fat muffins? Where are the chocolate ones?\"\n\nGeeves's next blog should be a must-read for everyone, except MacDonald. NSW finished the day on 5-157, a lead of 350, and likely to declare this morning in pursuit of outright victory."
