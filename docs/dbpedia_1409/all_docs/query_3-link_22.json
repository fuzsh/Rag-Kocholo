        "text": "Name Location Built Size Notes Image Big Ant Broken Hill 1980 A bull ant sculpture designed by artist Pro Hart, which was erected in 1980 and originally stood at the Stephens Creek Hotel.[10] It was moved to its current location, next to the Tourist Information Centre in Broken Hill, after being donated to the city in 1990. Big Apple Batlow Located in the middle of an orchard about 3 km north of Batlow, without public access. Only its top is visible from Batlow-Tumut Road, as it is largely blocked by apple trees.[11] Big Apple Tallong Located on Caoura Rd at Jim Watling Park. Tallong is home to the big apple and host to the award-winning annual \"Apple Day\" festival. The Big Apple made its return at the 2016 Apple Day festival. Big Apple Yerrinbool\n\nVisible from the Hume Highway Big Avocado Duranbah Located at Tropical Fruit World. The Big Axe Kew 1979 8 m (26 ft) Located alongside the Kew Visitor Information Centre. The original sculpture was replaced in 2002 as a result of ant induced damage. The Axe was remodelled and a new one was displayed on 26 January 2017.[12] Big Ayers Rock North Arm Cove 1990 This 1:40 scale model of Uluru was formerly an attraction at Leyland Brothers World, and later formed the roof of the Rock Restaurant. Technically not a \"Big Thing\" (as it was substantially smaller than the item it is modelled on), the Rock Restaurant was loosely grouped with the big things as an object of roadside art. It was destroyed in a fire on 31 July 2018.[13] Big Banana Coffs Harbour 1964 13×5 m (43×16 ft) Sometimes incorrectly claimed to be the first Big Thing in Australia.[14] (The Big Scotsman in Adelaide was built over a year earlier).
