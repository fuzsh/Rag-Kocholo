        "text": "Is Australia’s 50-over domestic tournament JLT, a proxy practice for next year’s World Cup ?\n\nLast year Western Australia won the JLT trophy convincingly. They had a great start to the tournament and never lost their momentum. However this year, inspite winning more games than any team, Western Australia didn’t qualify in the finals. Interestingly it was Victoria who had won less games than WA, won the tournament beating Tasmania by 110 runs in the finals.\n\nI was not able to cover ball 2 ball data – but over-by-over data of all games was updated. Hence individual batsman’s performance will be missed out.\n\nHowever we can look at bowler’s analysis – It would be interesting reflection if we were to compare these domestic performance against One Day Internationals for Australian bowlers.\n\nThis year the tournament was played with one less team- viz 6 teams.\n\nLast year seven teams took part in this tournament, CA (Cricket Australia) was the seventh team, which was omitted this year. Hence only 6 state teams participated in 20- game tournament (including finals)this year. This format was played with each team playing one game against each other in 7 allotted venues.\n\nTeam Batting\n\nFrom data I collected – I felt in first innings teams were trying very hard to score big total in less overs. In doing so, 60%(12/20) of them were not able to bat out(all out)quota of 50-overs, including 2 teams who lost their 10th wkt on last ball of their innings. Victoria, this year’s winner were involved in 5 games in which they lost all 10 wickets(all out).\n\nFor the record, last year only 3 teams(3/23= 13.04%) were all out (10 wkts) in first innings !.\n\nOf 20 games, 19 had results and one was abandoned.\n\nWin-margin – 19 matches (one-sided)\n\nFrom Win-Margin one can easily say there were no close games. and result in 13 games had huge margin, with one game was decided by Duckworth and Lewis.\n\nBelow is Win-Margin in 19 successful games (one was abandoned)\n\nWinning by > 50 runs : 31.58%( 6/19)\n\nWinning by > 5 wickets : 36.84%(7/19)\n\nWinning by > 10 overs remaining : 31.58 (6/19)\n\n1st Batting – 19 Matches (slipping by 40th over)\n\n> 275 scores – 9 times – 5 wins\n\n> 300 scores – 6 times – 4 win\n\n< 250 scores – 8 times – 2 wins\n\nMargin of win – Winning by > 50 runs : 31.58%( 6/19)\n\nMargin of win > 5 overs remaining : 21.00% (4/19)\n\nEnd of 40th over (1st batting)\n\nTeams lost their way in last 10 overs.\n\n47.37 %(9/19) times teams lost > 6 wickets at end of 40th over.\n\nAnd, only 53% of the times teams were over the 200 run mark at end of 40th over.\n\nBoth point suggesting teams didn’t have enough wickets to bat-out their quota of 50-overs.\n\n2nd Batting – 19 matches (No close chase)\n\nWhile chasing 45% (9/20) were bowled out either before or on the last ball of the stipulated 50-overs. Which is very high compare to last year.\n\nChasing target range successfully\n\nTarget between 200-225 : 2 times – 2 wins (100.00 %)\n\nTarget between 226-250 : 5 times – 3 wins (60.00%)\n\nTarget between 251-275 : 2 times – No win\n\nTarget between 276-300 : 3 times – 3 wins 100.00%\n\nTarget between 301-325 : 2 times – 1 win 50.00 %\n\nTarget between 326-350 : 2 times – No win\n\nTarget beyond 350 : 2 times – No win\n\nOvers Remaining – games got over before stipulated 50th over\n\n52 .63 % (10/19) times games got over with > 5 overs remaining, of which 6 were successful run-chase!\n\n10 times(10/19) teams were asked to chase score of 275 or above(4 wins). Of which 5 matches got over with > 5 overs remaining, with 2 successful chase.\n\n8 times teams were asked to chase score of less than 250(6 wins), of which 5 matches got over with > 5 overs remaining, with 4 successful chase.\n\n7 times(36.84%) teams won with > 5 or wickets remaining, featuring 3 games that were 275 plus targets!.\n\nToss factor\n\n9 teams(47.37%) won their match after winning the toss (either batting or bowling first)\n\nWin toss and bat\n\n9 teams opted to bat after winning the toss – 4 won their games.\n\n9 teams opted to bat after winning the toss – of which 4 scored > 275 runs (3 wins, 1 loss)\n\nWin toss and bowl\n\n10 teams opted to field after winning the toss – 5 won their games.\n\n10 teams opted to field after winning the toss – of which 5 conceded > 275 runs!. (2 wins, 3 loss\n\nBowling (1st bowling -19 Mts)\n\nAverage score – 275, and nine times(19) they conceded > 275 score!.\n\n10 wins / 9 loss -1st bowling – 12 times teams bowled out their opponent.\n\n2nd bowling (19 matches)\n\n9 wins for teams that defended (2nd bowling)\n\n8 times teams were asked to defend score of < 250, of which they won 2\n\n10 times teams were asked to defend a score < 275 of which they won 4\n\nBelow is comparison of 2 year’s performance of JLT\n\n(2017-18 v 2018-19)\n\nAn analysis comparison from two seasons(2017-18 & 2018-19)\n\nI have used few key indicators that reflects some change in these 2 years.\n\nNSW – This season they have batted poorly. Not once they were able to post 250 plus score while batting first- in 3 games they were bundled out before the 50th over with highest score of 241- hence frequency of wicket per balls faced is very low @ 31 – though it didn’t not have major effect on their run-rate\n\nQLD (this season) – apart from first and last game they had excellent batting performance. They were able to reach big score in either innings.\n\nSA- last year’s finalist were not able to perform the same way with the bat. Not a single 300 score this year(last year they had four 300 score while batting first)\n\nTAS – a much balance batting performance this year. However batting folded meekly in the finals.\n\nVIC- this year 6 times they batted first(only once last year) and posted some decent score. Interestingly this year they were the only team to lose all 10 wickets in every game, and there were none last year.\n\nWA -like last year only lost one game - yet could not qualify in the finals. In comparison to last year, they lost too many wickets in first 20 overs – 17(69) compare to 8(40) last year. Always prefer to chase, only they batted first this year. There is great dip in their general indices(Avg Balls/wkt) but their run-rate has been high along with boundary rate, and big overs!!."
