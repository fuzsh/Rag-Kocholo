BALLARAT.\n\nFIRST DAY.\n\n:The match between the first Eleven of Ballarat\n\nand Eleven of the Tasmasniau team, selected for\n\nthe Inter-colonial match inDlblbeourne, began on\n\nthe Eastern Oval on 14\"h ntas. Mr. WV. H. Wat\n\nson, of the Ballarat Club, who is himself a Tas.\n\ntanian, negotiated the match with the islanders\n\nsome time ago, and thus it is the local cricketers\n\nhave the pleasure of welcoming in Ballarat the\n\nfirst inter-colonial batch of players that has ever\n\nplayed elsewhere in Victoria than at Melbourne.\n\nThe Tasmanians are nearly all quite young mean,\n\nall but one of the Eleven pitted against the Balla\n\nrat players being, as we are told, natives of Tas-.\n\nmania. They all have the look of ericke:ers, and\n\ntheir ploy on Monday showed that they unlder.\n\nstand what they have come to Victoria to do.\n\nMr. WV. I. Welker has captained the island teatm\n\nwith credit. lie is a good all round cricketer,\n\nthough a little oat of practice just now, and in his\n\ncompany he has a right capable set of fellows who\n\nappear, so far, to have the best of the Blallarat\n\nplayers as to batting, but apparently\n\nare not better off. If so well olf,\n\nin the matter of bowling as the local\n\nclub. The 'Tasmanians play well together, and\n\nyesterday they fielded cleverly, and batted stea\n\ndily. The umpires were llr. C. Artthur for\n\nrasmania, and Mr. T. Watson for Ba-larat, the\n\nscorers being respectively Mr. 11. Cowell and Mr.\n\nIt. M. Walker.\n\nJ Thh play bega? n'thalf-post eleven o'clock, the\n\n'Tasmanians winninu the Jtoss and sending in the\n\nBallarat players. The rgroundrwas in splendid\n\no der; ,and a finer wicket no cricketer need ever\n\nexpect to havea'at leat not In'these latitudes, if\n\nindeed, in any place.' The weather was warm,\n\nnot to any hlot. Captain Sweeney and W. M\n\nWVatson went first to the wickets.\n\nHogg opening the ball with swifteah\n\nround - banders, the second ball\n\ntaking Sweeney's stump before he had made a\n\nrun. Scates took the captain's place, and he and\n\nWantsonegan to score at once, making ones and\n\ntwos cautiously.. till Watson was caught for 8 by\n\nCollins at point off Ilogg, two wickets being down\n\nfor 13 runs. \"W. Oldhani as the next in; and\n\nwhen one 'or two more rune had, been made,\n\nSoates, tempted : into danger by be of. Walker's\n\nslows, hit his wicket and went out for 7. J. H.\n\nFiggil look the bat then, and drew for one off his\n\nfirst ball from Walker, but in his next from\n\nHogg was nearly out at point, where Collins gave\n\nhim\"a life for that time. He then drove to on for\n\n8, and cat'for 2, while Oldham atole a single or\n\ntwo. Then Figgis put one of Walker's slows\n\ninto Hogg's hands at mid-wicket, after a score of\n\n6, Morres then went to theawicket, and made\n\nthe highest score of the eleven, - 'or some time\n\nbe .and Oldham scored slowly' ones nod twos,\n\nOldham having a reprieve at point 'o one occa.\n\nalon, only to be driven soon after.to the same\n\nstrait thlat Scates got into, hitting his wicket for\n\na total of 4., J. Cox took his place, and was\n\nnearly eaught by Walker from one of uis own\n\nslows, Morres also spooning a ball up at mid.\n\nI wicket, to be spared \"for that occasion only\" ,by\n\nMIerry. Morres then drove one of tee Thsmanian\n\ncapisin'd slows clean over the pavilion for 6-tl:e\n\nchief slogging feaet of the day. \" le cuat again for\n\nt. 2, and Cox drew for 1, both ofl the slows, and\n\nthen Cox died of the slows, and Evans, having\n\njust escaped 'the cggabhorred, of batters. Six\n\nwickets were now down for 40.runs. : irsttook\n\nCoxe place, and both bate bhd- scored isome\n\nsingles whon Morres was ran out by trying to.\n\n.take a ran off ;n tip at alip,l Hirst and he: not p.,\n\npeering to understand each; other :qoite welli\n\nenough just,then, and Dslay improving the meo\n\nment of hesitation by quick ly fielding the billi'\n\nMurray succeeded and had a short but merry'life,'\n\nscoring'aoone and a'two, and then telnog caught\n\nby.Evans off Hogg at mid.wicket on, eight\n\nr wickets having now fallen for .o runs. O. Csza\n\nly was, the next man, Iliret hitting the balls\n\nabout for a single or two, and a three by a pretty\n\nleg-bit when he was caught by Barclay off one of'\n\n.the slows.at.off midwickeit, with a score of 9..Gay\n\nthen went to the wicket and scored a .three by\n\ndriving his second ball to the grand stand,: most\n\nSBallarat onlookers wondering at the inserotable?\n\nwisdom which had kept the player to the last.\n\nGay made another 3 Iy driving one of Walker's\n\nslows; over the bowler's h?ad, and then ho' put 'a\n\na ball into Dumarosq's hands at leg, Cazily carry.\n\ning his bat oat, and the innings having been played\n\nfor a total of 64 all off the bat, for there was not\n\n1 a single bye or loigbye recorded. i, s,.\n\nThe Tasmanians then sent H. Barrett and H.\n\nDomaresq to the wickets to the bowling ol Morres\n\n0 and Figgie. Both bowlers were .\" dead on,\" and\n\nthe batters either could not or would not do any...\n\nthing with it, over after over of the virgin sort\n\nbeing bowled after the first, which had given a\n\ntwo to Barrett off Morres.\n\na Luncheon now liad to be attended to.\n\nPlay having been resumed, the third ball from\n\nMorrea took Barrett's stomps. T. Whtitesides\n\nnext took the bat, and both bats began after a\n\na while to score a little freely, when J. Cox was\n\nput on to bowl slows, the 'next death being Du.\n\nmoresq at point, where Cox caught him off\n\nMorres. D. Barclay, the mtost celebrated of the\n\nTasmanian bate, then went to the wickets and\n\nremaioned there till the last man thad been in for\n\nsome time, but he eventua ly fell a victim to on.\n\nof Cox'selows, Sweei.ey stamping him after be\n\nhad ruot up a score of 40, the highest score of the\n\nday. He batted prettily and carefully, end seemed\n\nit to do all he did-even -the running-with cool\n\nnoes and ease. WL?iehitdes ahd Barclay scored\n\nsteadily for soene time, till, when the foroler had\n\nmaIe a doz?en rune, he was stuemped by Sweeney\n\noff one of Cox's slows. Walker'(captain) then\n\nit went in, and in tho second over was caught by\n\nFiggli at longfield on, ofl one of the slows, after\n\nmaking one run. Four wickets were now down\n\nbt for 24 runs, the gatee being even as yet, as the\n\nsaenme number of Ballarat wickets had fallen for\n\nonly one run less. , V. Collins succeeded the\n\n- captain, and after le anod Barclay had scored\n\nsingles for a time, Collins slogged for a two and\n\na four, and then one of Cox's. teazers took\n\nhis wicket for a total of six. J. Arthur\n\ne was the next bat, Barclay still' warily\n\nmaking singles, and occasionally a doable, and\n\nArthur getting a three by a pretty hit to leg and\n\nSa coulle of singles besides, when he was caught\n\nby' Cezaly off Watson who'had began to bowl.\n\nSC. Perry thou went to the wicket and Figgise took\n\nSthe bowling at Morrea' end.' Perry. and Barclay\n\na took a few singles, and Perry hit to leg for 3 and\n\ntheln 'drove to the ofl for afoar-oil Mlorres, 'Bar\n\nclay following sult off onsof O0x's alowsafor a\n\nthree, and then a four .by. a, s.uare leg hit off\n\nrM eIorres. Some byes weroe'alo loade now, and a\n\na- little quiet barney between.the field and the;\n\numpire, who would not give Perry out 'when\n\nSweeney claimed to have stumped him off one of\n\nthe slows from Cox. In Cox's next over, how\n\never, Perry's wicket was unmistakably vietimlsed\n\nby a slow after tihe bat had scored ten: and' the\n\ntotal ihad reached to 67. -T. Hogg .then.took the\n\nof bat, and Gay bowled one over, a rather remark.\n\na. able one, and' then wvis'retired.t Hoegg's life was\n\n'n spared by Oldham at long field, and he soon' after\n\ncat one of Figeiso balls to the pavilion for four,\n\nBd Barclay driving the same bowler to the' off for\n\nthree. Some sinogles followed, the bowling was\n\nbeing collared, and the field ,got a little wild at\n\na times, whereby some more runs were.,made.\n\nIs Barc!ay at this time being missed by Watson at\n\nor mid-wickbt off,-nd thcen gettieg a three -by a\n\na, very spirited overthrow.' Ilogg a time, however,\n\nhad 5Iuw come, for he was caught by Scales ff\n\nCox fur 8, the telegraph now reading 9D. T.\n\nDalev succeeded at the wicket, and had made\n\no lour whlen Figgis took his wicket, and lI; Evans,\n\nthe last man was sent to the .wicket Barclay\n\nkept quietly' ot, making now a single,' now a\n\ndouble or a treble score, till at length Cox\n\ntempted him out of his ground, and Sweeney had\n\nat h!a bails in a moment, after the batter had made\n\nor the top score of the day. Evans had lost but\n\nin little time, to! he had made a two, a three, and\n\ntwo snlogles, when the fall of Barclay's bails\n\n' ended the play for a total of 115.

VICTORIA.\n\nTIBST DAY.\n\nThe iqtorcolonial cricket match between eleven\n\nVictorian. and sixteen Tasmanlan cricketers, I\n\nwhich has been looked forward to for some time\n\npast with a considerable degree of interest, Com- ]\n\nmenced on Friday on the around of the Mel\n\nbopreo Club. The attendance in the early part I\n\noftb''d?y was 'extremely meagre, but the num-.\n\nborf spectators increased as the day wore on,\n\naud at four o'clock there were about 500 persons\n\non the ground.\n\nCricket in Tasmania has received a good deal I\n\nof attention for some years past, particularly since 1\n\nthe visirtofStephenson's All England Eleven to r\n\nthat Island, and it is somewhat remarkable that I\n\nalthough _Victorian cricketers have more than\n\nonce tried conclusions with Tasmanians on their\n\nown ground with varying success, that colony has\n\nnever before been represented by a team in Vio\n\ntoria. The team selected by the Victorians,\n\nwhich was particularly strong in batting, was one\n\nwith'which the colony could reasonably be con\n\ntent to rest its reputation, and the Victorian\n\nplayers found in their opponents foomen worthy\n\nof their steel. The performances of the Tasma\n\nnlans since their arrival in the colcny had given\n\nsufficient evidence of their abilities in the cricket\n\nfield to. make their opponents aware that the\n\ncontest would be no one-sided Affair, and the\n\nmatch was not commenced with, any feeling of\n\nover confidence on either 'side. One fuatore to\n\nthis match will always make it distinct trom pro\n\n-ceding intercolonial imeetings of tboi kind, vlz.\n\nThe first appoarance of aboriginal natives in the\n\nfield on tbehalf of the colony. The absence of\n\nMinolagb, who like several other members of the\n\naboriginsl team is suffering from measles, was felt\n\nas a serious loss by the Victorians. His pi.cre\n\nwas supplied by Itollocky, the emergency man,\n\nand Cozens was the other aboriginal who took\n\npart in the match.\n\nThe Tasmanians, having won the toss, sent\n\ntheir opponents to the wickets, wheore Gibsen and\n\nHIIoran appeared shortly after eleven o'clock, to\n\nface the bowling of Hogg and Daly-medium.\n\npaced round arm bowlers, the former having a\n\nvery peculihr delivery. Walker, the Tasmanian\n\ncaptain, kept the wickets, and Whitesides did duty\n\nas long stop. Horan lost his partner by a good\n\n:ball from Daly when a unit had been scote d, and\n\nthe vacancy was filled by R. W. Wardill, who\n\nsoon got two for a hit to long leg, followed by a\n\nsingle, bat the batsmen evidently bad great dim.\n\nioully in getting the ball away from the wickets,\n\n, the ground being rather dead, and ,the sixteen\n\nfielding very carelully. Stewart shortly disposed\n\nof Wardill by a smart catch at mid off, and\n\nBullocky (aborlginal) joined Horan. The latter,\n\nby careful play, had scored five, when he was run\n\nout in attempting to ran two, tihe ball being re\n\nmarkably well taken in the field. Three wickets\n\nwere now down for eleven runs. Fowler and\n\nBullocky were next in company, and these two\n\nwere playing the bowling extremely well,\n\nthe latter causing much amusemeot\n\nby his singular style of fencing off\n\nthe balls, when Walker went on to\n\nbowl slows in the place of Daly. The first slow\n\nSpuzzled- IBllocky, and ,the second took \"his\n\nwicket. Itobertson supplied the vacancy, and\n\nWalker having finished the over, gave way to\n\nDaly,. Robertson and Fowler. kept the field\n\npretty busy for some time, and, on the telegraph\n\nshowing forty runs, Stowart went on to bowl in\n\nplace t Daly. But the batsmen still had com\n\nrmond of the bowling, and another twenty runs\n\nwere soon obtained. Walker then tried his slone\n\nagain. In the next over, .Fowlr spooned,up a\n\nball from Hogg, and was .caught'by the wicket.\n\nIkeeper. \"'He - retired' with twenty.four ?well\n\nearned runs to his credit. V. Cameron having\n\ntaken \"his'place,' Robertson way stamped to\n\nstepping out to a slow. Ills score was twenty.\n\nsix, all made in 'plendid style, only one chance\n\nIlving been given in the innings by running for\n\na abort ruan, and the number included two ifors\n\nfor bits over the chain fence.\n\nAfter a brief interval for lunch, the game was\n\nresumed with Conway and Cameron at the\n\n. wickets. These two played the bowling very\n\n- - successfully for a time, and Cameron had begun\n\nto score rapidly, when his partner lost his\n\nwicket in attempting'a very hazardous run, the\n\nball being beautifully taken in the field. Wills\n\nhaving joined Cameron, the latter brought\n\nup his score to twenty-one, inclusive of two hits\n\nfor four, and was then run out, owing to the quick\n\nfielding. Wilkie followed, and lost his wicket to\n\nHogg the trstjball. Cnzens (aboriginal), the last\n\n,man, played a very fair innings for four, and was\n\nthen run out in locautiously attempting a run.\n\nSWis, who had made seven, carried out his bat,\n\nand the innings closed, with tyes and wides, for a\n\ntotal of ninety-nine.\n\n.Tbe Tssmanians commenced their first innings\n\nfull ofconfidence, and soon obtained a mastery of\n\nthe bowling. Barclay, who made the high score\n\nat Ballarst, anl Domaresq, a left.handed bateman,\n\nwere the first at the wickets. Conway aud Wills\n\ntook up the bowling. Fowler officiated at the\n\nwickets, Horsn did duty as long.stop, and Cuosens\n\nplayed poilot-a position In which hedistinguibshed\n\nbimoelt. One or two stolen runs hIaving been\n\nseored, Conway in his third over took Barclay's\n\nmiddle stsmp. Whitesides thebn appeared at the\n\nwickets, and the score rose rapidly. lilts for two\n\nfollowed each othier in rapid succession. and four\n\nracs were obtaiued for a bye, when Whitesldes\n\nwould have been run out had the wicket.keeper\n\ntaken'\"'the bell, The telegraph now\n\nshowing twenty runs for one wicket.\n\nWills and Conwriy changed, ends, but\n\nwithout avail. Thirty runs were up; nod Wilkie\n\nwas put on to bowl slows inplaco of Wills, but\n\nthe batsmen only scored the more rapidly.\n\nCazens at length succeeded in catching White\n\nsides (who had made twenty in fine style) at\n\npoint, off Conway. Two wickets were now down\n\nfor forty runs. Arthur, who next handled the\n\nwillow, proved himself even a more formidable\n\nbatsman than bis predecessor. He soon brought\n\nfifty up on the board, and this was the signal for\n\nWlkle's retirement in favor of Cuzens. The\n\nletter bowled extremely well, nod very few runs\n\nwere made off him. Dumaresq, who had played\n\na long and cereful innings for thirteen, was now\n\ncaught by Wardill. The third wicket fell for 62\n\nruns, giving a remarkably high average, but the\n\nspell was soon to be broken. Collins, the next\n\nman, was caught by Horan without scoring; and\n\nWalker. was the only remaining man in the\n\nteam who made a stand. The fielding\n\nat this point, however, was very loose, and\n\nArthur continued to score. Robertson, who had\n\nbeen fielding extremely well throughout the day,\n\nat this stage missed an -easy catleb from Arthur.\n\nWardill having gone on to bowl in place of Con\n\nway the lack changed, and Walker, H. Barrett,\n\nStewart, Pedder, and T. Barrett were rapidly\n\ndisposed of; but the average was still very bigh,\n\nthe tenth wicket falling for 1105 rans-six more\n\nthan the Victorians had made. Wills and Con\n\nway then again took the ball, and did great\n\nexecution, especially the former, with lise slows.\n\nArthur succumbed to a ball from Wills, after\n\nplaying a fine innings for thirty-nine, and the\n\nremaining wickets fall for three runs. The\n\niunlnogsclosed for a total of 108, inclusive of\n\neleven byes. -\n\nThe fielding of the Tasmaniaus was extremely\n\ngood ; but so much cannot be said for theY Vi.\n\ntorians. - Fowler at the wickets did not appear\n\nto be at all in his old form.\n\nThe umpires were:-For Victoria, Mr. J.

Their\n\ncaptain, Mlr. Walker, is a thorough cricketer, and\n\nhe handled his men In a most masterly manner\n\nthe changes of the bowling were made joliciously,\n\nand the field posted in the best position for saving\n\nruns ; he was ably backed up during the day by\n\nDomnrerq, S ewart, and Whitesides, all of whom\n\ndistinguished themselves by some smart fielding.\n\nThe 'Tasmaulans appeared to as to field better\n\nthan our eleven, and our bowling was anything\n\nbut up to the mt rk. tloran's long?stopping was\n\nlikewise very shy ; II byes are tar too many\n\nfor an intercolonial match, and Fowler at tihe\n\nwickets was not nearly up to his usual form.\n\nOn the other hand, Coazns's point was excellent,\n\nand Bullocky made a fine cathel at long-field.\n\nWilkie's slows were completely collared, acd he\n\ndid anything but tistinguish himself in the match\n\nas Is his wont.\""
