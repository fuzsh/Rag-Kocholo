        "meta_description": "Todd Pinnington made his first grade debut for North Hobart Cricket Club during the 1990/91 season to become the clubs first grade player 353.He is a Life Member of North Hobart and in 2019/20 was inducted into Cricket Tasmania Premier League Hall of fame.As a wicket keeper batsman Todd played 2 first class and 7 one day games for Tasmania.He scored 6,243 first grade runs at 38.78 and took 394 dismissals behind the stumps.Todd also played in 5first grade premiership for North Hobart between 192/93 and 2001/02Let’s find out more about Todd’s journey in the game  What year you were born?1973Can you remember you first game of cricket?I remember my very first major introduction into a cricket match at my old primary school and it was a game between my school house colour and another team house. I don’t recall doing anything with the bat but remember my first over as I got 5 wickets. To be honest the guys batting (Ricky and Graeme) weren’t much chop as a batters. It was a game each pair batted for 3 overs and a wicket equalled minus runs.Tell us briefly about your cricketing journey?OK! Well I always played in my neighbourhood with kids in the area, in cul-de-sacs, driveways, backyards with taped up tennis balls and all variations of bats and varying conditions. But I really got started at some form of serious level St Virgils College in grade 7. A couple of my team mates were at North Hobart Cricket Club. One of those was one of Tasmania’s finest players in Michael Di Venuto. He and a couple of others said I should come along and play there…..so I did.North Hobart Cricket Club was then my home until I retired at 28 in 2002 and move to the USA.I started in 4th grade playing with a lot of the older club stalwarts which was what a young bloke learning his craft needed. What is lacking today. I progressed in my wicket keeping pretty quickly and went through the grades.In which grade and at what age did you make your debut in grade cricket?I started in 4th grade and I am pretty positive I was 13 or 14 years old.At what age did you make your first grade debut in grade cricket and can you remember how you performed in debut?I was 17 making my debut for North Hobart Cricket Club and I recall being told by my skipper that I was batting at 10 and keeping and that I was the engine room and had to constantly be talking up the boys all day but I was not to sledge, not to say anything to the opposition period. Not until he gave me the all clear to. So that said I think I got a couple of catches and don’t think I made any runs. In fact I may not have even been required with the bat. I didn’t make any notable impact, just a run of the mill game.If you can share with our audience, how would you describe yourself as a cricketer?Wicket Keeper Batsman, although I think I was more a Batsman Wicket Keeper! Aggressive opening batter. Loved the ball coming on and loved the battle.What were your strengths as a player?I am sure there would be many differing and varied opinions on this from past team mates and opposition players but as a batsman I never feared pace and I just wanted to get out there and bat and bat and bat and bat. I loved batting and wanted to do it all day. I was always hungry for runs which is a strength. I was never afraid to take on the bowling attack no matter the situation, however I learned to also be determined to not lose my wicket in tough situations. I never wanted to let my team down.As a wicket keeper I tried to always be as technically correct as possible. I know I wasn’t but I tried to work hard on my keeping all the time.What was your highest score in senior cricket?237 for North Hobart v Clarence District Cricket Club at my home ground, the TCA cricket groundWhat were your best bowling figures in senior cricket?Ha, I think I only got 2 wickets bowling leg spin after we had stitched the game up. It was for North Hobart against Kingborough at their home ground.You played 2 first class games for Tasmania, can you share with us how you found out you’d been selected to play for Tasmania, who did you play and what do you remember about your first class debut?Yes 2 Sheffield Shield g and 7 One Day games in the Mercantile Mutual Cup.I recall being given a bit of a heads up at state training later the prior week of the Shield game that there was a chance I would be coming into the side due to the possibility that the incumbent keeper (Mark Atkinson) gaining selection in the Australia A game. The shield game was the following Thursday and I think I was told by Greg Shipperd at my club game on the weekend prior. I was quite surprised and extremely elated and found it very hard to focus for the remainder of my club game.We played Victoria at the MCG, so to say I was extremely excited and nervous to be making my debut for my state at the G was an understatement.I remember several things about the game. All Australian players were back playing State Cricket. Victoria were bosting Matthew Elliott, Dean Jones, Brad Hodge, Damien Fleming and Shane Warne and we had David Boon back captaining the side. I remember meeting David Boon for the very first time at Melbourne Airport as we got on the bus. He flew in from Launceston and we came in from Hobart and he was on the bus and came to the front and stood at the door and with his steely straight face just looked at me, reached out to shake my hand and said quite literally “Todd, well done” and on the bus I went trembling with nerves.I recall being out there behind the stumps at the hallowed turf of the “G” and taking it all in and then my childhood batting idol, the late “Dean Jones” strode to the crease and churned out an easy century. He actually congratulated me on my debut and a couple of times complemented me on my soft hands when taking the ball when up to the stumps, I was a little proud.I wasn’t required with the bat in the first innings, but when I came out to bat in the second I recall my first ball was from Spin King, Shane Warne and I was the most nervous I’d ever been. I had Darren Berry in my ear saying “what will it be, leggie, toppy, wrong un, flipper”? I survived that over and was determined not to get out to Warnie and to play out for the draw. I didn’t get out to him but was not able to make the draw unfortunately.Dean JonesCan you remember your first dismissal in first class cricket?My first dismissal behind the stumps wasn’t a memorable one. A rudimentary caught behind by Shaun Young who bowled a nice outswinger that caught a fine nick into my gloves. The batter was Troy Corbett, Victoria’s no 11 bat.Who were the best three fast bowlers you have played against?I will keep this to grade bowlers because I didn’t consistently play against the same first class bowlers. In saying this I did play against Brett Lee on a few occasions when he was younger and his run up was pushing off the sight screen and he was express and through your rib area consistently.Grade CricketMark Colegrave - Clarence Cricket Club legend. Not fast but he could put it on the spot over and over, ball after ball. He could swing both ways and his slower balls always made batting difficult. He would change the length of his run up to put you off or give you less time to think. He would be my all-time grade cricket hardest bowler to face but I revelled facing him because of the challenge. After the game he would be the first to have a beer with you.Roger Hughes - Glenorchy Cricket Club. I was his bunny for my first couple of years and he told me so himself. That what I like about Roger, honest, play hard, give you some jip and follow it up with the ball. He could swing it both ways with ease and sometimes big hoop, sometimes late. You could never know which way it would go. He trapped me LBW many a time.Mark Ridgway, Clarence Cricket Club, A deceptively quick and very aggressive bowler. Bowled of a short run and had strong upper body and bowled a hard ball that got on you really quick. He could move the ball off the deck and if the wicket had anything in it he got the most out of it. A funny and good bloke to play against as well.Mark RidgwayWho were the best three spinners you have played against? Shane Warne, no surprise in this one. It was my very first Sheffield Shield game. His presence daunting and to have Darren Berry behind the stumps sledging and chattering about what was coming next really didn’t make it any easier to face him.At grade cricket:Josh Bean from University Cricket club was always hard to pick. He was a leggie but an unorthodox one in that he all but bowled with a sort of a wrong footed action and resembled Rashid Khan. Bowling more wrong-uns than leggies and his leggies were his variation.Tony Judd, when he moved from North Hobart to New Town. I thought it would be easy to face him given I wicket kept to him for many years but I found his left arm darts hard because I liked to use my feet and hated being stuck on the crease, which he made you do. Plus I knew he so wanted to get me out stumped down leg side because that is what he and I did a lot of as team mates.Who were the best 3 batsman you’ve played against?Definitely have to say Dean Jones in my first shield game. Scored 127 effortlessly. Was my idol and I just soaked up every ball he faced.At grade cricket:In my earlier years, Roger Woolley, former Tasmanian First Class Keeper Batsman. Playing at the end of his club career for Clarence Cricket Club. He was wily, could pick gaps effortlessly and before you knew it he was knocking on the door of a 100. When he crossed the boundary onto the field he was there for business.Andrew Dykes also from Clarence Cricket Club was a tenacious, hard worker and always managed to score runs against us. If you didn’t get him knicking off early in his innings he would spend a long time out there.Roger WoolleyWho played the best innings you’ve seen firsthand playing with or against?I recall early in my first grade career playing New Town Cricket Club at their home ground and our captain at the time and opening bat Damian Green score a big double ton against a fair paced bowling attack without a helmet. No fear of bouncers just pulled them to the fence every time.Was there any batsman in particular who whatever reason always you to cause you a few problems?As a wicket keeper I never found batters to cause me any problems, I dare say I probably annoyed them!!!! But I think it was more my role to be giving the bowler as much info as I could to help the bowler execute a plan.Can you recall a time when you thought, wow, this is a step or two up from what you were used to in grade cricket?Absolutely. Every time. I think having the second wicket keeper role at the time I played meant that I was always training to prepare to play 1st class cricket but having fleeting appearances I lacked the consistent exposure to that level. I always went into every game nervous and questioning myself. I think that showed that I cared and that I gave a $#%@ about what I was there for.Who was the best wicket keeper you’ve seen firsthand playing with or against?I played against Adam Gilchrist for NSW in the National U19 Championships at Bowral Oval and he stood up to the stumps to his quicks after the ball lost its shine. He took something like 4 or 5 stumping’s and a couple of catches. I remember returning home and telling my mate that there was this bloke from NSW that had the best hands I’d seen and he’d play for Australia one day.?In terms of wicket keeping which catch and stumping still brings a smile of satisfaction – if you could describe a catch and a stumping, the bowler and why it’s a special memoryStumping’s, every one of them gave me a smile. I loved taking them and I spent a lot of time up to the stumps to pace for that reason as well as to limit the batters stroke making ability. Leg side stumping’s in particular.A funny story that probably brings back the funniest memory was playing University CC and Mike Graeme-Smith a now Australian umpire was batting. Tony Judd bowling and whipped a left arm dart down leg side because Mike was susceptible to the leg side stumping all the time. It was literally his first ball and I clanged it and missed the stumping. Several overs later I clanged another chance. I missed 7 leg side stumping’s while Mike was batting and I recall him saying something to the effect that I just couldn’t get it together today and my response being that he’d look bloody ridiculous if he got out that way given we gave him 7 chances.Literally the next ball or two he fell to a leg side stumping and I just threw the ball to the ground and hearing Tony Judd scream “ABOUT TIME”. I think it was partly aimed at me for finally getting the stumping and finally getting Mike out. Luckily Mike didn’t damage us runs wise and I think Tony may have let him know that on his way to the pavilion.Todd Pinnington batting for TasmaniaWho are the two players you admired most in terms of skills and competitive spirit in the competitions you played?Shaun Young. When he played at North Hobart he gave everything. His effort with the ball was 100% and made batting look so easy. I liked batting with him because sometimes when we met in the middle at the end of an over he’d say nothing but his look on his face told you what you needed to do. But he was always great at advice in the middle when batting with him.Mark Colegrave from Clarence Cricket Club. His ability to land the ball in the same spot over and over and just be so consistent for so long. He wasn’t quick but he presented himself as a fiery quick and that in itself was daunting. You knew you were always up for a battle with him and he’d bring it to you every ball.Shaun YoungWho was the best captain you had the good fortune to play with?Dan Marsh, good thinker, calm under pressure and trusted his team mates. His faith in his team and their processes to get the job done showed he was a good leader.Graham Astley, my former 2nd grade captain Coach. He was a mentor and role model. He was a first class player for Tasmania. He saw the potential in me and 2 mates and knowing he was going to have us coming through took us under his wing, took us for off season fitness training and weight sessions. He instilled in me the understanding of playing for your team and being a positive team mate.Dan MarshWho has been your funniest team mate?Tony Judd, smart, witty, story teller and good banter man. I was at the receiving end of several practical jokes of his.Can you recall some banter or an exchange on the cricket field that still makes you laugh today?Roger Hughes from Glenorchy used to give me a decent go over. It wasn’t that it was nasty, well sometimes maybe but he would follow through after a delivery and make an effort to end up almost in your face and just look at me and flare his nostrils and let me know I was his bunny. For my first couple of seasons I was his bunny and he’d let me know asking me if I could pick his in-swinger after 3 or 4 play and miss shots to his out-swingers.Roger HughesWhat was your most embarrassing dismissal in senior cricket?If were talking when I was batting then I look back and see this as just pure bad luck. Playing at the TCA ground against Clarence in a 2 day game and I was on 237 not out batting with Ben Donaldson (on about 120 or so) and we’d put on just over 300 for the partnership. I was at the non-striker’s end. Ben Donaldson hit a nice straight drive back at the bowler Ben Puzny and unfortunately for me it deflected off his hand and onto the stumps and I was left standing there. I backed up a tad too far and just couldn’t get back. The bowler just looked and said sorry Toddy and for one moment I wanted to just lose it because I wanted to keep batting.Who was your childhood hero?I had a few:Wicket KeepingRod Marsh, diving ability and just pure toughness.Jack Russell, Not for technique but his hands were exquisite. Soft, fast and reflexes were divine.Ian Healy, Purely technically correct. Probably the most technically correct keeper ever..BattingDean Jones, Aggressive Class and confident.Alan Border, Tenacious and gritBowlingDennis Lillee, competitor and toughAll-RoundersIan Botham and Kapil DevIan HealyWho are the three sports people in the world you’d most like to meet?Don Bradman, I just want to know what went through his head every time he went out to bat.Roger Federer, Just to understand his calmness under pressure.Babe Ruth.Who’s your favourite cricket commentator?Nothing beats some of the originals, Richie Benaud, Bill Lawry and Tony Grieg during the halcyon days of cricket.What was your favourite ground to play at?Hands down the TCA Oval, the home of the North Hobart Demons. Ex first class and international ground. Value for your shots, hard wicket, bog oval and picturesque. History also.Was there a particular team you especially looked forward to playing against?Always Clarence Cricket Club. They always came ready to battle hard. They were always consistent and I knew I was always up with a fight. If I got runs I had to earn every one of them.What’s been your most memorable moment in cricket?Getting the opportunity to play first class cricket for my state. But I don’t have any one defining moment to be honest. I think all of it, playing the game I loved at a high level, playing professionally and having a good playing career at a great club where I got to be around amazing people, to learn and grow as a result.What’s the best win you’ve been involved with?I’ve never been one to isolate one victory for any one reason. I think every victory gives you something positive but losses taught me far more and for that reason I am going to a loss that taught me how to appreciate winning and the importance of being a valuable team mate, contributor and positive influence.Grand Final Loss to Clarence Cricket Club in the 1997/98 season. Clarence scored a monster 348 thanks to a big century by Clarence Legend Andrew Dykes. I knew for us to chase down such a total one of us had to score big and I didn’t want to leave that to anyone else. I couldn’t sit by and leave that burden on one of my team mates so from walking out to bat I took it as my responsibility to be there all day. I opened and batted through the innings ending up on 211 not out and only falling about 30 short. It wasn’t my score that was the defining moment. I learned that if you give yourself to the end goal you bring your team mates along as well. It takes one person to inspire and ignite to the common goal, even if you fall short of the goal. If you give it everything and leave nothing behind, it’s still worth all the effort.Who are the three players from your playing days at the top of the list for a Saturday afternoon barbeque?Tony Judd. There from the start of my 1st grade career, a captain, a mate, sometimes a pain but a genuinely funny and kind bloke. Always full of banter and you know where you stand. Funny and a good cricket brain. He and his left arm spin (more like swinging darts) was the reason I snagged as many stumping’s down leg side as I did.Paul Collins, good mate from my playing days, great clubman and just a genuine and funny guys. Always a good laugh having a beer with.Ben Donaldson, had many innings with this bloke. Nicest bloke you’d ever meet.Stuart Cobern, my old opening partner. Another funny and genuinely nice bloke. Spent a lot of time in the middle with him starting our innings off. We never had to force anything, he was one of those batting partners you could drop the ball and run without saying a word, and you just had that understanding of each other.What are your hobbies?I still coach cricket, quite heavily involved in my club and in the youth space and I privately coach so that I really enjoy.I am a keen gardener and I am trying to get more into mountain bike riding with my boys. Slow process but getting there. I still like to exercise as much as possible.What’s the best advice you’ve received?I have been very lucky to have had many wise players, coaches or mentors guide me and I think it would be remiss of me to not make mention to a couple of them:Jack Callinan Sr: He was my 4th grade captain. He just was a wise man in the game, knew all the little tricks (some not so cosher) but he always told me to be aggressive and confident but be humble.Graeme Astley: My 2nd Grade captain. He saw the potential in me and knew I could be a good player BUT I had to work harder and be strong mentally as well as physically. He put lots of time and effort into myself my off-season fitness and strength and helped me to achieve my goal of being an opening batter. What’s your occupation?I am a very proud Teacher’s Aide at Rokeby Primary School. I love it, it has been the best career change I have ever made. I love working with kids, helping them develop and building positive relationships with them to help them grow.I also do private cricket coaching for boys and girls (and adults) who want to grow in confidence and improve.Are you still involved in cricket and if so, in what capacity?Definitely! I love giving back. I have had many roles in the past few years starting back coaching my eldest son from his entry into cricket to now helping coach his U17 team. I had a stint as Head Coach of North Hobart’s Women’s Program and coached in various capacities in Youth Pathway Programs, Tasmanian Tigers Academies at Cricket TasmaniaNow I am involved with my eldest son’s U17 club team and coach my young 10 year old’s team in the coming U13 season. I am also working with my club (North Hobart) in the batting coaching space.I also privately coach batting and wicket keeping.If you were running a state cricket association what would your 2 priorities to ensure cricket in the state remained strong and successful on and off the field?Everyone has their opinions good and bad and it is not for me to critique, criticise or judge.I would like to see a greater link between clubs and the overarching governing body working together. Particularly in the female cricket. But it applies to both men’s and women’s. Clubs are under-resourced to appropriate the level and quality of coaching needed to help develop grade cricketers.",

It was for North Hobart against Kingborough at their home ground.\n\nYou played 2 first class games for Tasmania, can you share with us how you found out you’d been selected to play for Tasmania, who did you play and what do you remember about your first class debut?\n\nYes 2 Sheffield Shield g and 7 One Day games in the Mercantile Mutual Cup.\n\nI recall being given a bit of a heads up at state training later the prior week of the Shield game that there was a chance I would be coming into the side due to the possibility that the incumbent keeper (Mark Atkinson) gaining selection in the Australia A game. The shield game was the following Thursday and I think I was told by Greg Shipperd at my club game on the weekend prior. I was quite surprised and extremely elated and found it very hard to focus for the remainder of my club game.\n\nWe played Victoria at the MCG, so to say I was extremely excited and nervous to be making my debut for my state at the G was an understatement.\n\nI remember several things about the game. All Australian players were back playing State Cricket. Victoria were bosting Matthew Elliott, Dean Jones, Brad Hodge, Damien Fleming and Shane Warne and we had David Boon back captaining the side. I remember meeting David Boon for the very first time at Melbourne Airport as we got on the bus. He flew in from Launceston and we came in from Hobart and he was on the bus and came to the front and stood at the door and with his steely straight face just looked at me, reached out to shake my hand and said quite literally “Todd, well done” and on the bus I went trembling with nerves.\n\nI recall being out there behind the stumps at the hallowed turf of the “G” and taking it all in and then my childhood batting idol, the late “Dean Jones” strode to the crease and churned out an easy century. He actually congratulated me on my debut and a couple of times complemented me on my soft hands when taking the ball when up to the stumps, I was a little proud.\n\nI wasn’t required with the bat in the first innings, but when I came out to bat in the second I recall my first ball was from Spin King, Shane Warne and I was the most nervous I’d ever been. I had Darren Berry in my ear saying “what will it be, leggie, toppy, wrong un, flipper”? I survived that over and was determined not to get out to Warnie and to play out for the draw. I didn’t get out to him but was not able to make the draw unfortunately.\n\nDean Jones\n\nCan you remember your first dismissal in first class cricket?\n\nMy first dismissal behind the stumps wasn’t a memorable one. A rudimentary caught behind by Shaun Young who bowled a nice outswinger that caught a fine nick into my gloves. The batter was Troy Corbett, Victoria’s no 11 bat.\n\nWho were the best three fast bowlers you have played against?\n\nI will keep this to grade bowlers because I didn’t consistently play against the same first class bowlers. In saying this I did play against Brett Lee on a few occasions when he was younger and his run up was pushing off the sight screen and he was express and through your rib area consistently.\n\nGrade Cricket\n\nMark Colegrave - Clarence Cricket Club legend. Not fast but he could put it on the spot over and over, ball after ball. He could swing both ways and his slower balls always made batting difficult. He would change the length of his run up to put you off or give you less time to think. He would be my all-time grade cricket hardest bowler to face but I revelled facing him because of the challenge. After the game he would be the first to have a beer with you.\n\nRoger Hughes - Glenorchy Cricket Club. I was his bunny for my first couple of years and he told me so himself. That what I like about Roger, honest, play hard, give you some jip and follow it up with the ball. He could swing it both ways with ease and sometimes big hoop, sometimes late. You could never know which way it would go. He trapped me LBW many a time.\n\nMark Ridgway, Clarence Cricket Club, A deceptively quick and very aggressive bowler. Bowled of a short run and had strong upper body and bowled a hard ball that got on you really quick. He could move the ball off the deck and if the wicket had anything in it he got the most out of it. A funny and good bloke to play against as well.\n\nMark Ridgway\n\nWho were the best three spinners you have played against?\n\nShane Warne, no surprise in this one. It was my very first Sheffield Shield game. His presence daunting and to have Darren Berry behind the stumps sledging and chattering about what was coming next really didn’t make it any easier to face him.\n\nAt grade cricket:\n\nJosh Bean from University Cricket club was always hard to pick. He was a leggie but an unorthodox one in that he all but bowled with a sort of a wrong footed action and resembled Rashid Khan. Bowling more wrong-uns than leggies and his leggies were his variation.\n\nTony Judd, when he moved from North Hobart to New Town. I thought it would be easy to face him given I wicket kept to him for many years but I found his left arm darts hard because I liked to use my feet and hated being stuck on the crease, which he made you do. Plus I knew he so wanted to get me out stumped down leg side because that is what he and I did a lot of as team mates.\n\nWho were the best 3 batsman you’ve played against?\n\nDefinitely have to say Dean Jones in my first shield game. Scored 127 effortlessly. Was my idol and I just soaked up every ball he faced.\n\nAt grade cricket:\n\nIn my earlier years, Roger Woolley, former Tasmanian First Class Keeper Batsman. Playing at the end of his club career for Clarence Cricket Club. He was wily, could pick gaps effortlessly and before you knew it he was knocking on the door of a 100. When he crossed the boundary onto the field he was there for business.\n\nAndrew Dykes also from Clarence Cricket Club was a tenacious, hard worker and always managed to score runs against us. If you didn’t get him knicking off early in his innings he would spend a long time out there.\n\nRoger Woolley\n\nWho played the best innings you’ve seen firsthand playing with or against?\n\nI recall early in my first grade career playing New Town Cricket Club at their home ground and our captain at the time and opening bat Damian Green score a big double ton against a fair paced bowling attack without a helmet. No fear of bouncers just pulled them to the fence every time.\n\nWas there any batsman in particular who whatever reason always you to cause you a few problems?\n\nAs a wicket keeper I never found batters to cause me any problems, I dare say I probably annoyed them!!!! But I think it was more my role to be giving the bowler as much info as I could to help the bowler execute a plan.\n\nCan you recall a time when you thought, wow, this is a step or two up from what you were used to in grade cricket?\n\nAbsolutely. Every time. I think having the second wicket keeper role at the time I played meant that I was always training to prepare to play 1st class cricket but having fleeting appearances I lacked the consistent exposure to that level. I always went into every game nervous and questioning myself. I think that showed that I cared and that I gave a $#%@ about what I was there for.\n\nWho was the best wicket keeper you’ve seen firsthand playing with or against?\n\nI played against Adam Gilchrist for NSW in the National U19 Championships at Bowral Oval and he stood up to the stumps to his quicks after the ball lost its shine. He took something like 4 or 5 stumping’s and a couple of catches. I remember returning home and telling my mate that there was this bloke from NSW that had the best hands I’d seen and he’d play for Australia one day.\n\n?In terms of wicket keeping which catch and stumping still brings a smile of satisfaction – if you could describe a catch and a stumping, the bowler and why it’s a special memory\n\nStumping’s, every one of them gave me a smile. I loved taking them and I spent a lot of time up to the stumps to pace for that reason as well as to limit the batters stroke making ability. Leg side stumping’s in particular.\n\nA funny story that probably brings back the funniest memory was playing University CC and Mike Graeme-Smith a now Australian umpire was batting. Tony Judd bowling and whipped a left arm dart down leg side because Mike was susceptible to the leg side stumping all the time. It was literally his first ball and I clanged it and missed the stumping. Several overs later I clanged another chance. I missed 7 leg side stumping’s while Mike was batting and I recall him saying something to the effect that I just couldn’t get it together today and my response being that he’d look bloody ridiculous if he got out that way given we gave him 7 chances.\n\nLiterally the next ball or two he fell to a leg side stumping and I just threw the ball to the ground and hearing Tony Judd scream “ABOUT TIME”. I think it was partly aimed at me for finally getting the stumping and finally getting Mike out. Luckily Mike didn’t damage us runs wise and I think Tony may have let him know that on his way to the pavilion.\n\nTodd Pinnington batting for Tasmania\n\nWho are the two players you admired most in terms of skills and competitive spirit in the competitions you played?\n\nShaun Young. When he played at North Hobart he gave everything. His effort with the ball was 100% and made batting look so easy. I liked batting with him because sometimes when we met in the middle at the end of an over he’d say nothing but his look on his face told you what you needed to do. But he was always great at advice in the middle when batting with him.\n\nMark Colegrave from Clarence Cricket Club. His ability to land the ball in the same spot over and over and just be so consistent for so long. He wasn’t quick but he presented himself as a fiery quick and that in itself was daunting. You knew you were always up for a battle with him and he’d bring it to you every ball.\n\nShaun Young\n\nWho was the best captain you had the good fortune to play with?\n\nDan Marsh, good thinker, calm under pressure and trusted his team mates. His faith in his team and their processes to get the job done showed he was a good leader.\n\nGraham Astley, my former 2nd grade captain Coach. He was a mentor and role model. He was a first class player for Tasmania. He saw the potential in me and 2 mates and knowing he was going to have us coming through took us under his wing, took us for off season fitness training and weight sessions. He instilled in me the understanding of playing for your team and being a positive team mate.\n\nDan Marsh\n\nWho has been your funniest team mate?\n\nTony Judd, smart, witty, story teller and good banter man. I was at the receiving end of several practical jokes of his.\n\nCan you recall some banter or an exchange on the cricket field that still makes you laugh today?\n\nRoger Hughes from Glenorchy used to give me a decent go over. It wasn’t that it was nasty, well sometimes maybe but he would follow through after a delivery and make an effort to end up almost in your face and just look at me and flare his nostrils and let me know I was his bunny. For my first couple of seasons I was his bunny and he’d let me know asking me if I could pick his in-swinger after 3 or 4 play and miss shots to his out-swingers.\n\nRoger Hughes\n\nWhat was your most embarrassing dismissal in senior cricket?\n\nIf were talking when I was batting then I look back and see this as just pure bad luck. Playing at the TCA ground against Clarence in a 2 day game and I was on 237 not out batting with Ben Donaldson (on about 120 or so) and we’d put on just over 300 for the partnership. I was at the non-striker’s end. Ben Donaldson hit a nice straight drive back at the bowler Ben Puzny and unfortunately for me it deflected off his hand and onto the stumps and I was left standing there. I backed up a tad too far and just couldn’t get back. The bowler just looked and said sorry Toddy and for one moment I wanted to just lose it because I wanted to keep batting.\n\nWho was your childhood hero?\n\nI had a few:\n\nWicket Keeping\n\nRod Marsh, diving ability and just pure toughness.\n\nJack Russell, Not for technique but his hands were exquisite. Soft, fast and reflexes were divine.\n\nIan Healy, Purely technically correct. Probably the most technically correct keeper ever..\n\nBatting\n\nDean Jones, Aggressive Class and confident.\n\nAlan Border, Tenacious and grit\n\nBowling\n\nDennis Lillee, competitor and tough\n\nAll-Rounders\n\nIan Botham and Kapil Dev\n\nIan Healy\n\nWho are the three sports people in the world you’d most like to meet?\n\nDon Bradman, I just want to know what went through his head every time he went out to bat.\n\nRoger Federer, Just to understand his calmness under pressure.\n\nBabe Ruth.\n\nWho’s your favourite cricket commentator?\n\nNothing beats some of the originals, Richie Benaud, Bill Lawry and Tony Grieg during the halcyon days of cricket.\n\nWhat was your favourite ground to play at?\n\nHands down the TCA Oval, the home of the North Hobart Demons. Ex first class and international ground. Value for your shots, hard wicket, bog oval and picturesque. History also.\n\nWas there a particular team you especially looked forward to playing against?\n\nAlways Clarence Cricket Club. They always came ready to battle hard. They were always consistent and I knew I was always up with a fight. If I got runs I had to earn every one of them.\n\nWhat’s been your most memorable moment in cricket?\n\nGetting the opportunity to play first class cricket for my state. But I don’t have any one defining moment to be honest. I think all of it, playing the game I loved at a high level, playing professionally and having a good playing career at a great club where I got to be around amazing people, to learn and grow as a result.\n\nWhat’s the best win you’ve been involved with?\n\nI’ve never been one to isolate one victory for any one reason. I think every victory gives you something positive but losses taught me far more and for that reason I am going to a loss that taught me how to appreciate winning and the importance of being a valuable team mate, contributor and positive influence.\n\nGrand Final Loss to Clarence Cricket Club in the 1997/98 season. Clarence scored a monster 348 thanks to a big century by Clarence Legend Andrew Dykes. I knew for us to chase down such a total one of us had to score big and I didn’t want to leave that to anyone else. I couldn’t sit by and leave that burden on one of my team mates so from walking out to bat I took it as my responsibility to be there all day. I opened and batted through the innings ending up on 211 not out and only falling about 30 short. It wasn’t my score that was the defining moment. I learned that if you give yourself to the end goal you bring your team mates along as well. It takes one person to inspire and ignite to the common goal, even if you fall short of the goal. If you give it everything and leave nothing behind, it’s still worth all the effort.\n\nWho are the three players from your playing days at the top of the list for a Saturday afternoon barbeque?\n\nTony Judd. There from the start of my 1st grade career, a captain, a mate, sometimes a pain but a genuinely funny and kind bloke. Always full of banter and you know where you stand. Funny and a good cricket brain. He and his left arm spin (more like swinging darts) was the reason I snagged as many stumping’s down leg side as I did.\n\nPaul Collins, good mate from my playing days, great clubman and just a genuine and funny guys. Always a good laugh having a beer with.\n\nBen Donaldson, had many innings with this bloke. Nicest bloke you’d ever meet.\n\nStuart Cobern, my old opening partner. Another funny and genuinely nice bloke. Spent a lot of time in the middle with him starting our innings off. We never had to force anything, he was one of those batting partners you could drop the ball and run without saying a word, and you just had that understanding of each other.\n\nWhat are your hobbies?\n\nI still coach cricket, quite heavily involved in my club and in the youth space and I privately coach so that I really enjoy.\n\nI am a keen gardener and I am trying to get more into mountain bike riding with my boys. Slow process but getting there. I still like to exercise as much as possible.\n\nWhat’s the best advice you’ve received?\n\nI have been very lucky to have had many wise players, coaches or mentors guide me and I think it would be remiss of me to not make mention to a couple of them:\n\nJack Callinan Sr: He was my 4th grade captain. He just was a wise man in the game, knew all the little tricks (some not so cosher) but he always told me to be aggressive and confident but be humble.\n\nGraeme Astley: My 2nd Grade captain. He saw the potential in me and knew I could be a good player BUT I had to work harder and be strong mentally as well as physically. He put lots of time and effort into myself my off-season fitness and strength and helped me to achieve my goal of being an opening batter.\n\nWhat’s your occupation?\n\nI am a very proud Teacher’s Aide at Rokeby Primary School. I love it, it has been the best career change I have ever made. I love working with kids, helping them develop and building positive relationships with them to help them grow.\n\nI also do private cricket coaching for boys and girls (and adults) who want to grow in confidence and improve.\n\nAre you still involved in cricket and if so, in what capacity?\n\nDefinitely! I love giving back. I have had many roles in the past few years starting back coaching my eldest son from his entry into cricket to now helping coach his U17 team. I had a stint as Head Coach of North Hobart’s Women’s Program and coached in various capacities in Youth Pathway Programs, Tasmanian Tigers Academies at Cricket Tasmania\n\nNow I am involved with my eldest son’s U17 club team and coach my young 10 year old’s team in the coming U13 season. I am also working with my club (North Hobart) in the batting coaching space.\n\nI also privately coach batting and wicket keeping.\n\nIf you were running a state cricket association what would your 2 priorities to ensure cricket in the state remained strong and successful on and off the field?\n\nEveryone has their opinions good and bad and it is not for me to critique, criticise or judge.\n\nI would like to see a greater link between clubs and the overarching governing body working together. Particularly in the female cricket. But it applies to both men’s and women’s. Clubs are under-resourced to appropriate the level and quality of coaching needed to help develop grade cricketers."
