        "text": "Australia needed just a single session to complete a comprehensive 172-run victory over New Zealand in the first Test at Wellington's Basin Reserve.\n\nNathan Lyon took 10 wickets for the match, including 6-65 in the second innings as New Zealand meekly succumbed from what had been a competitive position at the close on day three to be all out for 179.\n\nOnly Daryl Mitchell offered meaningful resistance for New Zealand, his dogged innings of 38 from 130 balls his slowest by rate of scoring of any innings in double figures.\n\nCameron Green was named player of the match for his match-defining score of 174 in the first innings â€” which ended up being the difference between the two sides.\n\n\"It was a really good game, I thought,\" Pat Cummins said.\n\n\"It never felt like we were too far in front on that wicket, but overall really happy.\"\n\nThe match was somewhat delicately poised coming into the final day, with Australia needing seven wickets and New Zealand an unlikely 258 runs to earn a surprise victory.\n\nAnd New Zealand resisted for close to half an hour in front of another sold out crowd. But it was only half an hour before the inevitable pressure was turned on by the Australians.\n\n\"I think it was a beautiful bowling innings from us,\" Green, who was hailed as \"the difference\" by his skipper, said.\n\n\"I think Gary [Nathan Lyon] bowled beautifully that last day, he's always under pressure in the fourth innings and he always stands up and performs.\"\n\nIt took a change of ends for Lyon to find a way through the stubborn Rachin Ravindra-Mitchell partnership, which had defied Australia through to stumps on day three.\n\nBut Ravindra sparked the collapse with a poor dismissal, cutting a short and wide Lyon delivery straight into the hands of Cameron Green at point.\n\nWith that partnership broken, Lyon set about ripping through New Zealand's middle order.\n\nTom Blundell departed for a duck, getting a feather on a ball that popped up off his pad and safely into Travis Head's hands at short leg.\n\nNext to go was Glenn Phillips, who missed a straight one while playing deep in his crease and was out LBW for Lyon's fifth wicket.\n\nThat run of three wickets in 10 balls from Lyon tore the heart from New Zealand and the crowd at Basin Reserve, with victory now only a matter of time for the tourists.\n\nScott Kuggeleijn put a disappointing Test behind him with an entertaining cameo of 26 run from 28 balls before he fell victim to Green's excessive pace and bounce to top edge to Alex Carey.\n\nThat introduction of Green, who was not required to bowl in the first innings after his heroics with the bat, highlights the scale of the task facing New Zealand in this series, with Australia deploying its extraordinary number of attacking options with the ball in hand.\n\nGreen, who also used his extra height and pace to strike Mitchell on the head with a vicious bouncer, was only given three overs in the end before handing over the Josh Hazlewood, who promptly found Matt Henry's outside edge for 14.\n\nTim Southee decided hitting out was the best way he could make an impact, managing one six off Lyon before holing out to Starc at long on for 7 to give Lyon his fifth 10-wicket haul in a Test match.\n\nWill O'Rourke, who left the field with a hamstring injury on day three, came out to bat and was protected by Mitchell to an extent, who turned down runs before skying a top edge back to Hazlewood.\n\n\"Like every game we will reflect and look at ways we can be better in the next one,\" Southee said.\n\n\"We obviously didn't think it would turn as much as it did,\" he added on the way the pitch played and whether the Black Caps got their selections right."
