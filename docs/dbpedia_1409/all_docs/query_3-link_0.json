        "text": "27411424.2212320111\n\n102.1 to PM Nevill , Caught at first slip! Eventually! Hilfenhaus strikes firat ball and no surprise he bags a right-hander. It was back of a length swinging away, Nevill follows it, nicks and Cosgrove took two bites to hang on to the waist-high chance.. 354 / 7\n\n106.1 to SNJ O'Keefe , Caught by third slip! What a beauty from Hilf! This reared nastily off a shorter length, O'Keefe tried to get on top of it but couldn't. It caught the shoulder off the bat and ballooned high t Bailey at third slip. That was a brute of a ball.. 362 / 8\n\n3069423.1314014100\n\n89.5 to PJ Hughes , Caught at slip! Grat reward for Butterworth. This was another beauty that squared up Hughes on the crease, Hughes got a edge this and it flew waist high to Cosgrove at first slip who pouched it. Wonderful innings from Hughes.. 308 / 5\n\n118.5 to TA Copeland , Caught in the deep! Copeland's cameo ends. High bouncer from Butterworth, Copeland hooked high but not well enough to clear the rope. Faulkner moved to his left at deep square and caught it easily.. 428 / 9\n\n1837204.00781000120.546733.21956300\n\n19.5 to DA Warner , Bowled him! Brilliant from Doherty. He tossed it up again, enticing the drive from Warner, it gripped and spun back through the gate and crashed into middle. Well bowled. Doherty delivers.. 88 / 1\n\n25.5 to UT Khawaja , Caught at short leg! Well bowled. Doherty delivered the perfect length, Khawaja stretched forward but couldn't combat the turn, it came off inside edge and Cowan was sharp at short leg staying low and moving left to take the catch.. 112 / 2\n\n121.5 to PJ Cummins , Caught! Cummins tries to slog sweep Doherty, he gets a top edge that flies to point and Butterworth swallows a comfortable catch. Doherty gets his third. NSW are all out for 440.. 440 / 10\n\n2267633.4510613100\n\n30.2 to PA Jaques , LBW! Well bowled. Faulkner delivered the inswinger to the left-hander, Jaques falls over with his head, is struck infront half forward playing the wrong line and Simon Fry raises the finger. 121 / 3\n\n86.6 to SM Katich , LBW! Faulkner finally rewarded! This was a full inswinger, Katich shuffled across and playing the wrong line, it hit him just on off stump and Simon Fry raised his finger after a desperate appeal. The end of a great innings.. 306 / 4\n\n98.6 to SJ Coyte , Caught in the gully! Tasmania break through. This was a good length wide of off and Coyte just guided it in the air to gully's left and Kruger took a good catch. It was relatively straight-forward but he held it well. Coyte's cameo ends. 348 / 6\n\n401102.7514000056.21712442.2027916001\n\n35.2 to AJ Doolan , Caught behind! A mistake out of nowhere. Innocuous delivery back of a length wide of off, Doolan tried to cut but got a thin edge instead and Nevill accept the easy catch behind. Perhaps a bit more bounce than expected.. 85 / 2\n\n49.1 to GJ Bailey , Caught behind! Something had to give. It was 119kph good length just leaving Bailey a fraction, the captain pushed at it, nicked it and Nevill accepted the chance gleefully.. 107 / 3\n\n93.6 to MJ Cosgrove , full down leg, swinging in, big shout for caught behind and given. Shocking decision, missed that by four or five inches. Cosgrove is perplexed but has to depart and what a breakthrough it is for NSW before lunch. 223 / 4\n\n178.2 to BW Hilfenhaus , dances down the wicket and gets a good piece of a hoik shot to deep mid wicket, picks out O'Keefe perfectly. 453 / 10\n\n481411832.4523819000\n\n7.1 to NJ Kruger , LBW! Cummins breaks through. This was full and straight, Kruger falling over with his head caught on the crease was hit on the shin in front of middle. The only query was if it pitched outside leg. Paul Reiffel said n. Half a ball was inline.. 7 / 1\n\n154.1 to JP Faulkner , rank full toss on off, drives it straigh to mid off. How does that always happen, the shocking deliveries get the breakthroughs? Well batted Faulkner, a very mature knock. 391 / 6\n\n166.2 to TIF Triffitt , got him, big inswinger nips back off the deck, Triffit doesn't offer a shot as it wraps him on the pads, the umpire takes his time but gives it out. 419 / 7\n\n28410203.64124160003496431.881697000\n\n113.3 to EJM Cowan , there it is, that's the breakthrough they needed! Uses his feet, comes down the track and gets an inside edge onto the pads and up to Jaques at silly mid on. 275 / 5\n\n173.5 to XJ Doherty , well flighted outside off, lures him into coming down the wicket, doesn't connect and Nevill is quick to take the bails off, well bowled and Doherty is livid with himself for that mistake. 436 / 8\n\n177.2 to LR Butterworth , short of a length on off, rocks back and goes for the big pull shot, doesn't bounce much at all and he gets a bottom edge onto the stumps to deny him his hundred. 453 / 9\n\n311003.33142000701201.7131000020703.5081000"
