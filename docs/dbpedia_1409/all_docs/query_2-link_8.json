        "text": "Powerhouse Western Australia have stamped themselves as Australian cricket’s premier domestic team of the 2020s after securing their third straight Sheffield Shield with a 377-run dismantling of Tasmania in a lopsided final.\n\nAfter setting the Tigers a near-impossible target of 537 at tea on day four at the WACA on Sunday, veteran seamer Cameron Gannon (5-23) led a lethal bowling performance for WA, who took 10 wickets in an extended third session to rout the visitors for just 160.\n\nWA officially extended their dynasty – sealing an unprecedented “triple double” with their hat-trick of titles complemented by their three straight Marsh Cup one-day trophies – when Tasmanian tail-ender Iain Carlisle fell to a diving screamer by Joel Paris at gully off a Gannon bouncer.\n\nCaptain Jordan Silk offered the only real resistance with a counterpunching 46 for the Tigers, whose unlikely pursuit of the mammoth target started horribly when they nosedived to 26-3 through the losses of Matthew Wade (3), Charlie Wakim (15) and Caleb Jewell (8).\n\nFormer Test wicketkeeper Wade, who has announced his retirement from first-class cricket, walked off to generous applause after enduring a forgettable swansong. The 36-year-old made one in the first-innings and was dismissed cheaply again in the second, charging Gannon but only succeeding in nicking to WA gloveman Josh Inglis.\n\nSilk also edged one to Inglis before Hilton Cartwright took a pair of catches to dismiss Jake Doran (31) and Shield player of the season Beau Webster (19). Gannon trapped Jarrod Freeman plumb in front for a second-ball duck before Corey Rocchiccioli spun through the tail, following his first-innings 4-48 with 3-55.\n\nTaking match figures of 8-61, Gannon also played a role with the bat with his lusty 42 at No 10 lifting WA to 376. Cartwright (94) top-scored in the second innings for the hosts, who continued to grind Tasmania into the ground.\n\nSkipper Sam Whiteman was named player of the match for his enterprising first-innings 104, which set up WA’s 347 after being sent in by the Tigers, who fell well behind the eight-ball when they replied with 186."
