        "text": "by Cricbuzz Staff • Published on\n\nGurinder Sandhu returned figures of 5 for 41 © Getty\n\nQueensland vs Tasmania\n\nGurinder Sandhu picked up a five-wicket haul as Queensland thrashed Tasmania by an innings and 172 runs. Queensland were favourites after dominating the opening two days with both bat and ball. Beginning the third day with a lead of 210 runs, Queensland managed to add another 101 runs to their tally with overnight batsman Jimmy Peirson completing a century. Riley Meredith finished with five wickets for the bowling side.\n\nTasmania, who were already bowled out for just 147 in their first innings, had a huge task in front of them to make Queensland bat again. Even though the openers patiently added 41 for the opening wicket, Sandhu opened the floodgates by breaking the stand as Tasmania lost three wickets for the addition of just six more runs at that stage. The procession continued as Sandhu picked up the key wickets of Beau Webster and Ben McDermott before removing a couple of tailenders to give his side an innings victory. Tim Paine, who made a comeback to first-class cricket, was left stranded on 29 in Tasmania's innings.\n\nBrief scores: Tasmania 147 (Jarrod Freeman 44; Mark Steketee 4/43) & 139 (Tim Paine 29*; Gurinder Sandhu 5/41) lost to Queensland 458 (Marnus Labuschagne 127; Riley Meredith 5/96) by an innings and 172 runs\n\nSouth Australia vs Victoria\n\nA breezy century from skipper Peter Handscomb has given Victoria a chance to push for a win on the final day against South Australia. Resuming the third day's play with a lead of 86 runs, Victoria did lose Will Pucovski early. But Handscomb ensured his side was on top of the contest by finding the boundary on a regular basis. Even though South Australia didn't allow Nic Maddinson and Matthew Short to flourish, Handscomb found support from the likes of Marcus Harris, Sam Harper and Will Sutherland.\n\nHandscomb's partnerships with Harper and Sutherland completely put South Australia on the backfoot before the skipper departed for 132 off 183 balls. Sutherland, who already scored a hundred in the first innings, was the next man to fall for 40 following which the declaration arrived. With a huge target of 425 in front of them, the South Australia openers got through a tricky little period before stumps to knock off 38 runs.\n\nBrief scores: South Australia 230 & 38/0 need another 387 runs vs Victoria 310 & 344/7d (Peter Handscomb 132, Marcus Harris 42; Jordan Buckingham 4/78)\n\n© Cricbuzz\n\nShareTweet\n\nTAGS\n\nRELATED STORIES"
