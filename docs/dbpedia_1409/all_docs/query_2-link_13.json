        "text": "Peter McPhee was a right arm fast medium bowler who played first grade cricket in Brisbane before moving to Tasmania and making his first class debut in 1989/90.\n\nPeter played 27 first class games for Tasmania capturing 89 wickets at an average of 33.16. His best bowling figures was 6 for 36 and he took 5 wickets in an innings on 4 occasions and picked up 10 wickets in match in one game.\n\nA character of the game who knew how to enjoy himself\n\nWelcome Peter,\n\nHow did you get into cricket?\n\nMy Dad was a great fan and Marist Brothers Ashgrove were very encouraging. Jack Eales (John Eales dad, coached me in Grade 5, Massive man with Massive Hands\n\nWhat are your memories of your junior cricket days?\n\nLoved playing as many days as we could, memories of terrorising batsmen in the front yard on dodgy lawn wickets. Under 18’S on Sundays at Valleys, good times.\n\nWhen did you start playing grade cricket In Brisbane?\n\nMarist brothers were right next to Valleys Yoku Rd ground, I used to ride my bike home through their training nets. I signed up for third grade when I was 16.\n\nHow did you progress through the grade ranks?\n\nI made Valley First by the time I was 17 and Australian Under 19 the year after.\n\nDid you have any mentors or coaches who were assisted your cricket?\n\nNot really, the bowling coaches were pretty hopeless back then. No video and no Bio-Mechanics and the State Squad training environment was not conducive to players helping each other.\n\nWhat were your cricketing ambitions?\n\nI wanted to play for Australia like most young blokes.\n\nDid you move to Tasmania to pursue cricketing opportunities? What were the circumstances around your move from Brisbane?\n\nTasmania made me an offer in 1982 during the Under 19 Youth Test Series v Pakistan, but my girlfriend wasn’t keen. When we got married she said we could give it a go.\n\nPeter McPhee playing for Australia Under 19 v Pakistan in Hobart\n\nDescribe the circumstances the led to your first-class selection?\n\nOver too many red wines, I told one of the Selectors that the blokes he was picking were hopeless and I would take 3 times as many wickets as any of them. Boonie won the bowling average one year!! Next thing you know I’m in!!\n\nWhat do you remember about your first-class debut?\n\nBowling Mark Taylor with my first ball!\n\nWhat were the challenges of playing first-class cricket and how did you deal with them?\n\nNot really that many challenges, apart from getting selected. I probably could have done better political work when I was younger, but I’m kind of glad I didn’t kiss arse.\n\nWhat was your best performance with the ball and what do you remember about it?\n\n6 for 36 v Queensland at the Gabba. I remember beating them there twice and thinking how much the wicket suited my bowling and regretting that the Queensland selectors wouldn’t give me a game. I also remember winning a trip to Fiji as the player of the year taking a record 43 wickets for the Season. I also remember Colin Miller smashing that record by taking 70 odd in one season a few years later!\n\nColin Miller\n\nHow did your first-class career end?\n\nI decided it was time to start a business career and a family so I retired at 29.\n\nWhat do you think looking back on your first-class career?\n\nThink I could have done better if I stayed off the beer and cigarettes, but they were fun too!\n\nWhat preparation went into your game?\n\nLots of bowling in the nets, so I could perform in the middle.\n\nWho were the teammates you particularly admired?\n\nFunky Miller (good bloke), Nick Courtney (good bloke) Glenn Hughes (funny man, unusual housemate).\n\nWho were the opponents you particularly admired?\n\nThe Waugh Brothers, talent and application. One had both, the other too much talent.\n\nWhat would you do if you were running Australian Cricket?\n\nStart again and only employ people have played at some level for a long time and who love cricket.\n\nWhat advice would you give to yourself as an 18-year-old?\n\nGo full time and don’t worry about a career until after cricket, study externally whilst you’re playing.\n\nAre you involved in cricket now and in what capacity?\n\nNo, would like to, but too busy working running our business - Natures Fresh at Rocklea Markets\n\nYou were selected in the Prime Ministers XI\n\nYeah I played in the Prime Ministers XI back in 1992 when Paul Keating was the Prime Minister against West Indies. We won by 3 runs."
