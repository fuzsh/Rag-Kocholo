        "text": "Next Article\n\nPHOTO: STU GIBSON/BRAND TASMANIA\n\nHobart’s Blundstone Arena created a slice of state history in January when it hosted an Ashes Series match for the first time in its 33-year Test history\n\nMarcus Pamplin’s thoughts were turning to the fourth day. With England seemingly cruising shortly after Tea on day three of the fifth Ashes Test in mid-January, the Blundstone Arena head curator was working over in his mind what needed to be done to the ground the following morning. With his plans sorted, he told three of his crew – apprentices Kelsey Lovell, Justin Galeotti and casual Aza NicholHawkes – to head home as they were rostered on to come in for the early shift the next day.\n\nChasing 271 for the win, it was finally looking like things were coming together for England after what had been nothing short of a miserable Ashes campaign to that point. 3-0 down in the series, heading into their final innings of the Tour they looked in a strong position to salvage some credibility in Hobart before the long flight home.\n\nAs day time turned to night time on day three, openers Rory Burns and Zac Crawley had put on 68 runs, England’s best opening partnership of the series, before Burns chopped on a Cameron Green delivery shortly before Tea. First drop Dawid Malan then came to the crease, taking the score along to 82, and with nine wickets still in hand all seemed\n\nCricket Australia’s decision to hand\n\nHobart the fifth Ashes Test could\n\nnot have been scripted any better, with plenty of drama and theatre as Australia completed an emphatic 4-0 series win over England. ATM editor Brett Robinson catches up with Blundstone Arena head curator\n\nMarcus Pamplin to look back at the history-making match.\n\nto be going well. But this was England…\n\nAs English quick Mark Wood had done to the Australians in the second innings where he claimed 6/37, Australian all-rounder Green started bowling short of a length. Having collected the scalp of Burns, Green would dismiss Malan in similar fashion. Nine balls later, 2/82 became 3/83 with Green collecting his third wicket, this time Crawley nicking behind as he attempted to drive at a fullish delivery. The rot had set in.\n\nIn what would end up being one of the most dramatic collapses in Test match history, England would go on to lose all their last nine wickets in that night-time session. They were skittled for just 124, losing the match by 146 runs and the series 4-0. Losing 10 wickets for just 56 runs, there were two moments in particular that were symbolic of the shambles that was England’s 2021/22 Antipodean campaign.\n\nThe first came when English captain Joe Root was clean bowled by a Scott Boland ball that seemingly must have struck something on the pitch. Sneaking under the toe of Root’s bat, it ploughed into his off stump and effectively sealed England’s fate that evening. Even Boland couldn’t hide his disbelief.\n\nThe second moment, which provided an exclamation point for the whole tour, saw tailender Ollie Robinson back away from a Pat Cummins full toss on middle and off stump, before throwing his bat helplessly at the ball as it cannoned into the stumps. As the English tabloid newspaper headlines screamed the following day, it was a complete surrender on England’s behalf.\n\nAnnouncing a new partnership that will benefit every sports ground in Australia\n\nPHOTO: CRICKET TASMANIA\n\nThe Blundstone Arena crew (from left) David Burk, 2IC Samantha Butler, Angus Vear, head curator Marcus Pamplin, Justin Galeotti and Kelsey Lovell\n\nLike every other spectator that night in Hobart (and around the world), a bemused Pamplin could not quite believe the manner in which the match had concluded so abruptly in those last 18 overs. Having already planned for the next day, Pamplin quickly found himself ringing up the staff who he had just sent home to tell them it was all over and to come back in to celebrate. It was an extraordinary end to an extraordinary few weeks for Pamplin and his team and one that will forever be etched in their memory banks.\n\nTHE ASHES COMES TO HOBART\n\nJanuary’s Test was Pamplin’s sixth of his tenure at Blundstone Arena and not surprisingly the pinnacle of a turf management career that has spanned more than three decades. After 13 years at Kardinia Park in Geelong followed by nearly four years as head curator at Manuka Oval in Canberra, Pamplin took over at Bellerive in May 2008.\n\nHis first Test came in January 2010 when Australia played Pakistan in the third Test of that series, with the home side winning by 231 runs. Pamplin recalls that match vividly, in particular Australia’s first innings of 519/8 declared. After being dropped for naught on the boundary, Australian captain Ricky Ponting ended up posting a remarkable 209, with Michael Clarke complementing that with a knock of 166. Ponting then hit 89 and Simon Katich a century in Australia’s second innings of 219/5 declared, before the Aussie bowlers dismissed the tourists for 206.\n\nThat match would be followed by Tests in 2011 (New Zealand), 2012 (Sri Lanka), 2015 (West Indies) and 2016 (South Africa). That latter match, won by the tourists by an innings and 80 runs, was just Australia’s second loss in Hobart in 14 Tests (Australia has won on 10 occasions and drawn twice).\n\nAfter five years’ absence from the Test schedule, Blundstone Arena was due to re-enter the spotlight last November when it was announced they would be hosting a one-off Test match between Australia and Afghanistan. However, the dramatic events surrounding the Taliban re-taking control of Afghanistan and their negative stance on women playing cricket, Cricket Australia postponed the match just three weeks before the first ball was to be bowled.\n\nWhile disappointing to lose that match, hopes that Hobart would hold a Test weren’t off the agenda by any stretch. With an Ashes Series fast approaching, the fifth and final Test had been scheduled for Optus Stadium in Perth, but due to the Western Australian Government’s strict border policy, that fixture was increasingly being put in jeopardy.\n\nSure enough, just before Australia went 1-0 up in the series at The Gabba in Brisbane, Cricket Australia confirmed that Blundstone Arena had won out over heavyweight rivals the MCG and SCG to host the relocated Test. The day-night affair, Hobart’s first pink ball Test and the second of the series, would be held from 14-18 January. Pamplin had prepared in hope of such an eventuality and now those plans were about to be put into action.\n\n“We were absolutely rapt to get it,” says Pamplin. “The whole place was abuzz and it was certainly all the talk among the staff. It was especially exciting for the apprentices – it’s not every day you get to prepare for an Ashes Test. I still vividly remember my first Test being very nervous as you’d expect. But there’s nothing quite like preparing for an Ashes Test – the tradition, up against the old enemy – so it’s definitely a unique experience.”\n\nPHOTO: JESS OAKENFULL/BRAND TASMANIA\n\nPACKED FIXTURE\n\nThe Ashes Test was the high point of what was a remarkably busy and challenging season for Pamplin and his team. Being the state’s premier cricket venue as well as doubling as the home base for Cricket Tasmania’s state teams, not to mention local cricket as well, Blundstone Arena’s cricket facilities are in use pretty much year round, even in winter. And that’s before you even factor in the football season where it is the home ground of Tasmanian State League side Clarence as well as the Tasmanian base for North Melbourne in the AFL.\n\nThe main Blundstone Arena wicket block comprises 10 ryegrass decks (variety Premier 3) while the outfield is a blend of Derby Extreme and RPR ryegrass. Blundstone boasts two practice facilities – 25 wickets behind the hill on the eastern side of the ground and another 16 on the western side adjacent to Derwent St. Since 2018, every winter a giant marquee measuring 60m long and 25m wide\n\nThe Ashes Test was the high point of what was a remarkably busy and challenging season for Pamplin and his team\n\nOne week out from the first ball being bowled, Blundstone Arena copped an unseasonal 50mm in just 30 minutes\n\nis erected over the practice pitches next to the hill to enable training to continue through the winter months.\n\nAt the time of the Ashes announcement, Pamplin and his team had already experienced a busy spring and start to summer. In September, Cricket Australia confirmed that Tasmania would become a hub for the start of the seventh season of the Women’s Big Bash League (WBBL). The first 20 games of the competition featuring all eight teams would be played between Blundstone Arena and Launceston’s UTAS Stadium and Invermay Park. Between 14 and 20 October, Blundstone hosted the first nine games of the competition, including four double headers.\n\nIn addition to the centre wicket requirements, having eight teams using their practice facilities threw another logistical spanner into the works as it meant that Pamplin and his team couldn’t do their usual renovation on the practice wickets. Combined with a very wet couple of months, the challenges were starting to mount, especially with the rotation and recovery of the practice facilities.\n\nWith all nine WBBL matches successfully completed and the Tasmanian hub moving up to Launceston, Pamplin’s next focus was on preparing wickets for two Marsh Sheffield Shield matches. Tasmania took on South Australia from 10-13 November and Western Australia from 21-24 November. The former was a rain-impacted draw, while the latter saw the home side chase down 315 across the final two-and-a-half sessions to win by four wickets. That last Shield encounter was then followed two days later by a Marsh One Day Cup 50-over match between Tasmania and WA.\n\nFor the next two weeks the centre wickets continued to be used for women’s practice matches as well as the 5 December final of the Tasmanian Premier League Women’s 1st Grade (T20) and a sponsor’s T10 game on 12 December. Blundstone then went into the BBL11 season, kicking off the first of five games on 14 December. Their next BBL game was on 20 December, a rescheduled game due to WA’s hard border, but in between they also hosted Tasmania’s opening two matches of the rescheduled Women’s National Cricket League (WNCL) 50-over competition. That meant four games in seven days, with further BBL games held on Christmas Eve, 27 December and 1 January.\n\n“The workload was huge and, to be honest, even before we found out that the Ashes Test was coming we were already pretty fatigued,” reflects Pamplin. “That’s what happens when you are both a training venue and a match venue and have an ever-changing schedule. And it wasn’t just out on the centre wicket, but managing all the practice wickets as well. By the time the Test came around all the practice wickets had doubled up.\n\n“We deliberately kept a set of practice wickets fresh and unused just in case we got the Test. With all the BBL practice sessions we had to make sure they were scheduled away from those Test practice wickets so they wouldn’t get damaged. Also, with the Derwent St practice wickets, there’s only 12 metres in between the two tables, so the bowlers have to start their run ups in the middle of the other pitches which we had to factor in.\n\n“We also had a lot of rain in October and November, so much so that they had to scrub out the first five or six rounds of local cricket. As well as covering the centre wicket, we also had to cover both sets of practice wickets to prevent any damage which hampered our preparations a little. So there were a lot of little things that we had to take into consideration which meant a lot of extra work for the staff.”\n\nCOVID HITS…\n\nWith the 1 January BBL match out of the way, Pamplin was looking forward to getting a good two-week lead-in to dial in the surfaces for the Ashes Series finale. Just a few days later,\n\nDespite a shaky start in the opening session, the Pat Cummins-led Australians cruised to a 4-0 Series win in dramatic fashion\n\nhowever, and any thoughts of an uninterrupted build-up were soon dashed as Pamplin’s preparations were thrown into a tailspin.\n\nTen days out from the Test, on 4 January, three of Pamplin’s crew tested positive for COVID. They were immediately forced into isolation for seven days, while crewmates Lovell and 2IC Samantha Butler (who had only started the role a month before) were also told to isolate as they had been working alongside the trio and were deemed close contacts. By a stroke of good fortune, Pamplin was away from the arena that day as it was his son’s 15th birthday, leaving him as the only member of the crew to start getting the practice wickets underway for the Test. Thankfully, Lovell and Butler were deemed safe to return after missing just a day.\n\nFacing the prospect of being three staff down, Pamplin needed reinforcements immediately and after some quick ringing around his numbers were soon bolstered. Former 2IC Oliver Beswick, who departed the arena midway through last year after nine years, returned to lend a hand and ended up staying on until the end of the Test. John Kedey, a qualified groundsman from UTAS Stadium in Launceston, dropped everything\n\nIn one of Test cricket’s greatest collapses, England lost nine wickets in the night-time session on day three\n\nPHOTO: RICK SMITH/CRICKET TASMANIA\n\nand headed down on 6 January for four days. He was followed on the 11th by UTAS crewmate Chris McKenna who worked through until the second day of the Test. (McKenna was already scheduled to join the team before the COVID situation flared up). Pamplin was also able to secure casual Aza Nichol-Hawkes who started on 7 January.\n\n“We were so fortunate to have those guys come in and help, and experienced guys too,” says Pamplin. “Oli had his own work but was able to put that off and give us a hand and because he knew the run of the joint that experience was good to call upon. It was brilliant that John and Chris could come down too and I’m really grateful to Adam Spargo (UTAS head curator) and Robert Groenewegen for letting them help us out. John had worked with us before so he knew what we do and both he and Chris fitted in really well.\n\n“Even though it was a headache, we were kind of in a good position. We had really worked hard getting all the little extra things – the gardens, general facilities and the nets – in a good place before all this hit. That meant we could just concentrate on the centre wicket, practice wickets and the outfield and the finer aspects of our preparations – fertiliser programs, getting the watering and rolling right. If there was a curveball thrown at us we were kind of ready for it, but we never thought it would be COVID. We thought maybe bad weather, but I guess it’s just part of the world we live in these days.”\n\nJanuary’s Test was Pamplin’s sixth of his tenure at Blundstone Arena and the pinnacle of a turf management career that has spanned more than three decades\n\nPHOTO: STU GIBSON/BRAND TASMANIA\n\n… THEN THE WEATHER\n\nDon’t worry, the weather did conspire to add to Pamplin’s headaches. With an annual average rainfall of just over 600mm, Hobart is officially Australia’s second driest state capital behind Adelaide. Looking at the long-term averages, Hobart normally receives anywhere between 25-50mm for the entire month of January. Not this year, however.\n\nLate on Friday 7 January, a week out from the first ball being bowled, Blundstone copped an unseasonal 50mm in 30 minutes. As the photo on page 20 taken by Pamplin shows, the arena resembled a lake.\n\n“What more could go wrong,” laughs Pamplin. “We had already started on the practice wickets and were in the process of watering the wicket for the Test match. We knew there was some bad weather coming, so we put the big cover down on the centre wicket. A month before we had a massive thunderstorm and it washed away a lot of the black soil from the crown of the grass and caused a lot of ruts in the surface. So we put the big cover down and I’m glad we did because it just poured.\n\n“I’ve never seen it that heavy in Hobart before. The wind was whipping the rain across the oval and it looked like there were waves across the surface. The wind would push the water into the LED screens and it would bounce back, it was that hard. We had a river going down into our sheds, the indoor centre got flooded, as did our storage area under the grandstand. By the end of the day we’d had 72mm. It was just bizarre.\n\n“One of the practice pitches was damaged, but we were able to repair that easily. The ground drained well and the water disappeared within 30-40 minutes. It did stuff up our watering on the centre wicket a little, but we ended up getting the amount of water that we wanted into the Test pitch.”\n\nGREEN TINGE\n\nTwo days before the start of the Test, Pamplin breathed a palpable sigh of relief when he welcomed back crew members David Burk, Angus Vear and Justin Galeotti who had been isolating. Speaking to the media throng that week, Pamplin alluded to the challenges that his team had been through. That was of little concern to the journalists, however, who were more interested in how the wicket would present.\n\n“It’ll have a tinge of green on it, for sure,” Pamplin told them. “There’ll probably be one or two millimetres of grass left on it, just to keep the shine on the ball so they can get that swing. I expect it to be a good contest. Especially first day, there’ll be a bit in it.”\n\nWith day-night Tests, the pink ball doesn’t stay as hard as a red ball would in a normal day-time Test. Worried that it will become a boring contest dominated by the bat, Cricket Australia instructs curators to leave a bit more grass on the pitch to enable the pink ball to keep its shine longer. When the covers were taken off, there was certainly a green tinge to the Hobart wicket and the first session proved to be anything but boring.\n\nThanks to some poor shot selection and the English bowlers landing some good areas, Australia slumped to 3/12 from 9.5 overs after being put into bat. But as Travis Head (100), Cameron Green (74) and Marnus Labuschagne (44) would demonstrate later in the day, once the early session had been navigated there were runs to be had.\n\n“We only had one real sunny day leading into the Test,” recalls Pamplin. “Ryegrass is always going to hold its colour a lot more than couchgrass and you need a lot more direct sunlight to take the colour out of it, which we didn’t get. So, yes, there was a definite green tinge to it, but no different to a lot of the wickets we prepare for Sheffield Shield games.\n\n“The night before the game I was pretty nervous – you always are – but this was heightened because it was an Ashes Test. You start playing out scenarios in your head – is there too much grass on it, should I have done this or that. But at the end of the day you just back yourself and what you have always done and it’s really up to the players to how well they bat and bowl.\n\n“I saw match referee David Boon on the first day and in his typical low, gruff voice commented, ‘Looks like a good cricket wicket Marcus. It looks great, you should be happy with it.’ So that gave me a good lift. The English always looked like they were going to bowl. I knew it was going to be tough in that first session, but also that there would be runs once they had got through that. What I didn’t expect was it to be all over in three days!”\n\nDespite the earlier than anticipated conclusion and all the long hours in the leadup, Pamplin was delighted with how the pitch played and how his team rallied around. Who knows when an Ashes Test will likely return to the Apple Isle, but the drama and theatre that Blundstone provided certainly left an indelible mark. For Pamplin though, the most pleasing aspect was watching his team throughout the event and witnessing them being part of sporting history for the state.\n\n“The highlight for me was seeing how well our team worked together and their enthusiasm for it,” says Pamplin. “We wouldn’t finish our work until 10.30pm each night, but we would all still have a beer afterwards instead of getting out of there. I think the guys and girls enjoyed the whole feel and atmosphere of the Ashes. We were working hard and pulling some long hours, but just because it was an Ashes Test everybody was up and about for it.\n\n“It was terrific for the state and cricket in Tasmania and put a real spotlight on Hobart. We’ve been asking for an AFL team for years, but we got an Ashes Test instead! It was just fantastic to be involved and for the staff it was reward for many years of hard work. You don’t expect something like the Ashes to come along and all the hype that comes with it. It will be something that every staff member here won’t forget, that’s for sure.”"
