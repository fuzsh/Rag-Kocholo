        "text": "Faces to watch in the domestic rounds\n\nWith performances meaning everything at the moment, we have picked out the most likely contenders for a spot in the test side this summer. At this point only Warner, Smith, Hazlewood and Starc have guaranteed places, so the Matador cup and following two rounds of fc cricket will be crucial into the makeout of the Australian Side. We will list the current players first and the hopefuls after.\n\nOpening Batsmen\n\nJoe Burns-A poor SL tour resulted in both his average and his place in the pecking order drop. Some solid shield performances are needed to show he is up to international level against all sides in all conditions\n\nShaun Marsh-After a painstakingly unsuccessful international career, Marsh seems to have finally hit his stride. However, youth and past performances are not on his side so he will need to back up the god form shown in his most recent tests. Will likely be picked over Burns for the first test if he performs in the domestic scene\n\nTravis Dean-An unproven opener with a world of talent and grit yet has not played quite enough to prove he can succeed consistently. Another shield season averaging above 40 will heavily increase his chances\n\nMatthew Renshaw- Same as Dean however showed class against South Africa A. Likely the selectors will favour him over the aforementioned Victorian opener Dean if they are put head to head\n\nCameron Bancroft-Was rated a high chance of claiming a test cap a year ago but a drop off in form has seen his chances slide. Needs to show he can consistently perform\n\nTop and Middle Order\n\nUsman Khawaja- Was brilliant last summer but faltered against spin. Will cause him problems coming into the India tour. Should regain his place for the first test however more failures will cost him his place\n\nAdam Voges-Age is not on his side and neither are his past pressure performances. Has cashed in on roads and missed out when Australia needed him. Should keep his place but if he drops in form he won't be coming back into the side\n\nJake Lehmann-Superb last year but they often say the second year is the hardest. Unlikely for selection unless he really steps up like he did last year\n\nCallum Ferguson-Has been great for South Australia in his entire career and remained consistent however he is not really the fresh start the selectors are looking for. Expect him to replace Voges if selectors want to keep an experienced head in the middle order\n\nPeter Handscomb- After a poor start to his career he has really stepped up in recent years. Also as a fantastic player of spin he will likely get a sniff in before or during the Indian tour\n\nGeorge Bailey-Has proven he is not as successful in fc cricket but is a good player of spin. May come in handy for India\n\nChris Lynn-Unlucky with injuries however he has been the most consistent 20/20 player for the last couple of years. Amazing how little international cricket he has played but this may be his summer if he continues to show he can bat\n\nKurtis Patterson-Has really matured lately and consistently picks up runs but he needs to really push his case if he wants to be picked. Needs more runs than the rest if he wants to stand a chance\n\nNick Maddinson- X-factor player but hasn't shown great consistency through his career. Would be a big risk to play\n\nAllrounders\n\nMitch Marsh-Was better in the SL tour but his batting still hasn't been up to test standard. May get the first test but after that if he can't perform he won't be picked\n\nMarcus Stoinis- Great talent with the bat and useful with the ball but with a stacked Victorian team it is hard to stand out. He needs to do just that to get a game in this summer\n\nJames Faulkner- Not a number 6 batsman but really good with the ball. Would be a fantastic asset for the India tour but he needs some red ball cricket before he can be considered\n\nHilton Cartwright- Up and coming batting allrounder, would be a gamble but he is definitely a future star. A big domestic summer would lock him in the selectors minds for next year. It is heard that Giraffe highly rates him however so a callup may be quicker than that even\n\nTravis Head-More of a batter who can bowl a bit, but he would likely replace M Marsh in the team. Had a brilliant last year but has been hit and miss before that. His ODI career is off to a good start and he will definitely get a test at some point in the coming years\n\nMoises Henriques- Didn't do enough in his test vs SL and neither his batting or bowling is quite up to test standard.\n\nAshton Agar-Bowler who can bat 7 or 8, he has youth on his side but he hasn't proven himself capable of taking wickets consistently. Also in competition with O'Keefe and Holland with the SLA spot\n\nGlen Maxwell- Another X-factor, his playing of spin will land him a chance for the India tour. Depends on the performance of others more than anything as to what the selectors need\n\nWicketkeepers\n\nPeter Nevill- SL was the first time he has been under pressure to perform and he couldn't stand out. Needs to bat like a test batsman to keep his place\n\nMatthew Wade- His keeping is sub-par to Nevill's but his batting is more profitable for the side. Will likely be the next choice if Nevill falters\n\nSam Whiteman- The young gun, hasn't proven consistently yet but is definitely the future for Australian keeping. Will be selected if they want youth over past performances\n\nPace Bowlers\n\nJackson Bird- Really good return to test cricket and should be the third seamer\n\nChad Sayers- Always in the mix for SA and is capable of tearing teams apart. Not fast but swings a lot and may be a good option for the Adelaide test.\n\nJoe Mennie- A more consistent option who doesn't do much with the ball but with Hazlewood in the team he isn't as necessary. May be an alternative to Bird\n\nJames Pattinson- If he can stay fit for the first half of the summer he should come roaring into the team unless everyone is in impeccable form\n\nPat Cummins- Already proven at test level however he has unfortunately only played 8 fc games. More games will make him almost an automatic selection\n\nNathan Coulter-Nile- Was in the SL squad but didn't get a match and is still awaiting his first test match. Injuries have held him back and he now needs some good red ball form to prove his case\n\nPeter Siddle- Always there and reliable however with Bird and Mennie already available, his place is down the pecking order. Unlikely to play\n\nChris Tremain- Like Mennie, he was brilliant against South Africa A but poor in the one day series. Not the first pick but bad form and injuries could let him slide into the team\n\nSpin Bowlers\n\nNathan Lyon- Still unproven outside of Australia. Needs to show he fits in with more wickets in the upcoming test series. Will likely play the first 3 tests\n\nSteve O'Keefe- Only injuries have held him back so far and should get a look in the side before India. Will be almost a certainty for the Indian squad\n\nJon Holland- Poor start to his test career but good form could help him get to India\n\nFawad Ahmed- Will be fighting with Holland for a place in the Victoria team. His sub-continent experience will be crucial for India if he gets chosen however which will play into his favour\n\nMitch Swepson- Young and inexperienced yet proven to be a class leggie. May be called up for India for experience but will be unlikely to play\n\nAdam Zampa- Proven white ball cricketer yet to transform that form into red ball matches. Needs to show he can do that before being selected\n\nExperts break down sheffield shield teams ahead of huge first round\n\nQueensland\n\nBig name: Usman Khawaja, had the golden touch last summer and if he can pick up that form it will set the bulls on the front foot from the start\n\nMr Reliable: At just 21, it is hard to believe that Matthew Renshaw can be considered for this pick. Yet, his gritty mindset ensures that even if he does fail to score big, he has worn down the opening bowlers\n\nX-factor: Mitch Swepson may not have Warne's figures, yet he has the capacity to change games. The young gun can pull a wicket from anywhere and will be a huge key to the bull's success\n\nQuiet achiever: Chris Hartley. The best wicketkeeper in Australia currently and is more than handy with the bat. He is so good with the gloves that it comes as a shock to his teammates if he gives away a bye\n\nYoung gun: Jack Wildermuth can get big hauls of wickets...and swing the bat too. If he fires he will be the complete package this year so expect big from him\n\nWhat they need: Their bowling attack to step up. It has been their downfall of past times and unless they can contain the opposition it will come to be again\n\nCrystal ball: 4th\n\nNew South Wales\n\nBig name: We tried to look past their collection of current international players for this one but couldn't beat the Aussie captain himself, Steve Smith. When Smith is batting well, he is unstoppable, and it is that which will terrify opponents\n\nMr Reliable: Ed Cowan. The ex-test opener moved here this season and will hope to consistently get the side off to a solid start. Expect plenty of frustrated opening bowlers at the end of a Cowan knock\n\nX-factor: Nick Maddinson. The kid can quite literally blow a game apart in a session and if he is allowed to go free he will\n\nQuiet achiever: He may not be known for his big hitting or fast scoring, but Kurtis Patterson is always amongst the runs. While he is often overshadowed by a blazing ton, his knocks won't go unnoticed to the opposition\n\nYoung gun: Pat Cummins may have already played a test match, but only has 8 fc games to go with it. If he manages to stay fit however, he will be more than a handful for everyone who faces him. A strong summer may even land him back in the test side\n\nWhat they need: To get off to a flying start while they have their internationals. They will lose a great amount of talent after round 3 so they need to win games early\n\nCrystal ball: 2nd\n\nSouth Australia\n\nBig name: Travis Head lit the world alight last year with his massive innings and needs to do so again this year. Tipped widely as a future Australian star, the young captain will be a key role in the runners up's campaign\n\nMr Reliable: Chad Sayers is always taking wickets, but also has the capacity to break teams apart with big hauls. Don't expect to see no wickets next to his name often this year\n\nX-factor: Jake Lehmann has won games before, and will do it again this year. With an appetite for big scores, and getting them fast, his explosive batting won't be easy to handle\n\nQuiet achiever: Joe Mennie rolls in and bowls the same ball over and over. Yet, he still manages to consistently take wickets without grabbing the spotlight.\n\nYoung gun: Jake Weatherald hasn't done too much yet at fc level, but has shown plenty of potential. A confidence building score may be all he needs to be let loose from his shackles\n\nWhat they need: To work as a team. Too often last year either their batting or bowling fell apart and lost them the match. If everything clicks, they won't be easy to beat\n\nCrystal ball: 5th\n\nVictoria\n\nBig name: James Pattinson is making his return to cricket and everyone will know about it with his lightning fast bowling. After losing his test place through injury, he will be desperate to bounce back into the baggy green\n\nMr Reliable: Peter Handscomb has improved dramatically through the last few years and now is the backbone of the batting lineup. It is not easy to beat the young Victorian so don't be expecting an easy wicket when he strides to the crease\n\nX-factor: It can't be anyone but Glen Maxwell. Nicknamed \"The Big Show\", he can win games on his own with his big hitting and more than useful off breaks.\n\nQuiet achiever: Cameron White has been around forever, yet still manages to churn out runs. No longer the star of the team, he still consistently manages to top run scoring charts and will hope to continue this season\n\nYoung gun: Matthew Short may have only played two games, but has already looked a class bat. While he may struggle to crack into the side, when he does he will be sure to make the most of his opportunity\n\nWhat they need: For the selectors to choose the right team. With so many options, it will be a real struggle to fit them in the same team. It does however give the non-chosen a chance to work harder for a spot\n\nCrystal ball: 1st\n\nTasmania\n\nBig name: George Bailey has been a crucial member for Australia's ODI team for some years now and has performed consistently for Tasmania even after his test axing.\n\nMr Reliable: James Faulkner is consistently a threat with his slow mediums and is more than handy with the bat. As a player who has the capacity to turn the game like he can, he is surprisingly consistent.\n\nX-factor: When Ben Dunk its them, they stay hit. While his beenormous success in limited over cricket hasn't directly translated into shield form, he has the ability to hit devastating knocks\n\nQuiet achiever: Beau Webster may not be a household name but the young allrounder has already proved his credentials as a starter in the lineup\n\nYoung gun: Simon Milenko is an up and coming bowling allrounder. He has already to proven that he can take wickets and keep and end tight which has secured his place in the side for the immediate future, however has yet to show off his batting talents\n\nWhat they need: The veterans to show up. Doolan, Bailey, Dunk, Bird, Paine, Faulkner and Doherty are the only players with international experience in the squad and only Bird has played more than five test matches of them. Even so, the young squad will look up to these players to lead from the front.\n\nCrystal ball: 6th\n\nWestern Australia\n\nBig name: Mitch Marsh. The big hitting allrounder may be dropped from the test side unless he can improve, but that is nothing but gain for WA. His bowling is good enough to be selected as a bowler alone but he can tear teams apart with his big hits as well.\n\nMr Reliable: Michael Klinger is one of the unluckiest cricketers to not play for Australia. He consistently plys his trade either opening or at first drop game after game and will continue to do so this season.\n\nX-factor: Hilton Cartwright may be young, but has already proven himself as a classy bat. Paired with his more than useful bowling, he will be a handful to deal with every game\n\nQuiet achiever: Nathan Rimmington has always been a top level bowler and while he may not even make the side, when he will you know he will do what he does, which is take wickets and build pressure\n\nYoung gun: Ashton Agar may not be the teenager making 98 on debut anymore, but is still younger than most players in the league. While his batting is still not top 6 worthy, it is a work in progress. It is his bowling, however, that completes him as he is a deadly slow left armer. Expect plenty from him this year\n\nWhat they need: For their batsman to perform. Especially when injuries and international call up come into play, it will be crucial for the likes of Klinger and Bancroft to perform. Their squad also noticeably lacks depth in batting so it will be up to players to step up\n\nCrystal ball: 3rd"
