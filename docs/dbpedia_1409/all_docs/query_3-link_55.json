        "text": "History\n\nAustralia’s written history extends only a few centuries into the past, from the time of initial European contact. However, the ancestors of Australian Aboriginal peoples first arrived tens of thousands of years ago and developed a rich legacy of complex oral histories. They told (and tell) of spiritual accounts of the creation of the world, of ancestral heroes, and of religious connections to the landscape. Although there is not enough space in this article to discuss these oral histories in depth, it is important to acknowledge that the history of Australia can be told in many ways. For example, it can be told from the differing perspectives of Aboriginal and European historians, as well as through the evidence from Western science. This history section begins by making use of evidence from archaeological excavations at Aboriginal sites; for more recent events, it relies heavily on written histories. (See also exploration of Australia and the Pacific Islands.)\n\nIndigenous Exploration and Settlement\n\nAboriginal Dreaming stories tell that spirit beings created the Aboriginal peoples along with the landforms and places that now make up Australia. By contrast, scientists using radiocarbon and thermoluminescence dating techniques believe that the ancestors of the Aboriginal peoples canoed to Australia from Southeast Asia some 40,000 to 60,000 years before the present, when sea levels were lower. They had settled most of Australia and Tasmania by 30,000 years ago. At that time, most of the continent was wet and green. They could depend on a huge variety of foods, including meat from the giant mammals that roamed the forests and grasslands.\n\nBetween 22,000 and 18,000 years ago, however, conditions were colder and drier. Aboriginal peoples probably abandoned the center of the continent as the desert core expanded, and sand dunes covered parts of Victoria and Tasmania. It is likely that various Aboriginal groups also adapted to the changing environment by altering key aspects of their culture, including social networks, trade, art, and new technologies. They were using curved throwing sticks called boomerangs and barbed spears more than 10,000 years ago.\n\nThe last Ice Age ended roughly 10,000 years ago. The waters around Australia slowly rose hundreds of feet over a period of several centuries. Water eventually separated mainland Australia from New Guinea and Tasmania. Afterward the Aboriginal peoples of Tasmania lived in complete isolation. However, maritime trade continued between New Guineans and the inhabitants of the Torres Strait Islands, just north of Australia’s Cape York Peninsula. Aboriginal peoples reoccupied central Australia as conditions there improved. However, most of the continent’s larger animals had died off by this time, whether as a result of the climate changes, overhunting (by the successful Aboriginal peoples), or some combination of factors.\n\nEither Aboriginal peoples or groups trading with them brought the dingo, a type of wild dog, to Australia about 3,000–5,000 years ago. About the same time, Aboriginal groups began to use small, flaked stone tools. Within the past 1,500–3,000 years, their population seems to have increased as they exploited new lands and established far-ranging trade networks.\n\nAboriginal peoples in those days were hunter-gatherers who lived a partly nomadic lifestyle. They moved from place to place within their traditional territory to ensure a steady food supply. They typically built temporary shelters from bark and brush (called gunyahs or mia-mias). Some groups who lived close to water and abundant food sources built more-permanent shelters that they used for months at a time. Different peoples had different kinds of hunting weapons, including nonreturning boomerangs, specialized spears, and woomeras, or hooked spear-throwers. They also used fire on the grasslands to drive game animals in their direction. To fish, they used string nets, stone traps, and tined spears.\n\nA large percentage of the Aboriginal diet depended on the use of digging sticks to supply yams, witchetty grubs, and honey ants. Edible native plants included epacrids (a family of small trees and shrubs), geebungs, and lillypilly. Women, as highly respected members of society, were often responsible for food-gathering activities. Aboriginal peoples respected and protected the land, using natural resources in a sustainable way to ensure their existence for generations to come. (See also Indigenous Australians and the environment.)\n\nTwo groups of seafarers and explorers began trading with northern Australia hundreds, or perhaps even thousands, of years ago. Melanesians (mainly Papuans) crossed the Torres Strait in the northeast. They traded from their dugout canoes all along the Cape York Peninsula. The Melanesians brought with them fishing equipment, bows and arrows, drums, and other items. From Indonesia in the northwest, fleets of the Macassans (including Makassarese, Buginese, and other peoples) arrived to harvest trepang (sea cucumber). They also traded tobacco, iron, and glass to Aboriginal peoples of the coast. These visits were recorded in Aboriginal art, ceremonies, and songlines.\n\nThere is no way to know precisely how many Aboriginal people inhabited the continent before the arrival of Europeans. Most scholars have estimated that the population was between 300,000 and 750,000 people, and some suggest that the population was as high as 1,000,000. Between neighboring groups, territorial boundaries were known and respected without recourse to fences or permanent housing. As far as is known, wars over property were therefore unnecessary. In addition, relationships between family members and clans were of major importance. Thousands of people would travel hundreds of miles to participate in ceremonial gatherings with distant relatives.\n\nThe Torres Strait Islander peoples have inhabited their homeland for at least 2,500 years. They are of Melanesian descent. Traditionally, Torres Strait Islander peoples were seafarers who relied on fishing and trade with other islands and villages along the south coast of Papua New Guinea. Their economy was based on fishing and cultivating private gardens. They traded items such as feathers, turtle shells, pearl shells, tools, and canoes.\n\nLike the Aboriginal peoples, Torres Strait Islander peoples had a close connection with their traditional lands (Country) and waterways and with nature. Torres Strait Islander culture and spirituality were closely linked to the stars and the stories of Tagai, a great fisherman and spirit being whom the Torres Strait Islander peoples believe created the world. Tagai is represented by a constellation of stars in the southern sky. Torres Strait Islander law, customs, and practices were shaped by the Tagai stories. The Torres Strait Islander peoples’ deep knowledge of the stars and sea provided them with valuable information regarding changes in the seasons and when to plant gardens and hunt for turtles or the dugong. This knowledge also helped them navigate the seas.\n\nFirst Contact with Europeans\n\nFor several centuries, Europeans had hypothesized that the landmasses of Europe and Asia might be counterbalanced by land in the Southern Hemisphere. They thought that this balance of landmasses kept Earth spinning at an even rate. Eventually Europeans sent navigators to find the Terra Australis Incognita (meaning “Unknown Southern Continent”) that they imagined. By 1509 Portuguese and Spanish navigators had found an ocean route around Africa to India and the Spice Islands (the Moluccas). European explorers then “discovered” other islands north of Australia. These islands included New Guinea by 1526 and the New Hebrides (now Vanuatu) by 1606.\n\nThe Dutch vessel Duyfken, under master Willem Janszoon (also spelled Jansz), made the first European sighting of Australia in 1606 in the Gulf of Carpentaria. From bases on Batavia (now named Jakarta) on the island of Java, the Dutch sought “new” lands and trading partners throughout the East Indies (now Indonesia). Sailing ships bound for Batavia soon found that they could run east from the Cape of Good Hope with the brisk Indian Ocean westerlies (winds coming from the west). They would then cut north at the last possible moment. But not all turned north in time. Dirck Hartog, Frederik de Houtman, and other Dutch navigators thus “discovered” the wreck-littered western coast of Australia between 1616 and 1628.\n\nIn 1642–43 Abel Tasman sailed for the Dutch East India Company. He traveled eastward across the Indian Ocean at latitude 50° S. Shifting course to avoid bad weather, he arrived at the stormy west coast of Tasmania. Tasman named the island Van Diemen’s Land after the governor-general in Batavia. He then went eastward and charted New Zealand.\n\nNavigators long avoided the better-endowed east coast. They were fearful that the prevailing westerly winds would not blow on the eastern, lee side of the continent. James Cook charted the east coast in 1770. He quickly learned of the hazards of the Great Barrier Reef and strove to avoid puncturing his ship’s hull on it. Cook was arguably the greatest European explorer of his time, because of his navigational skill and his ability to keep his crew healthy. He also seems to have had honorable, largely peaceful interactions with Aboriginal groups. However, some Australians now decry Cook as the harbinger of doom for the Indigenous peoples.\n\nEuropean contact with Aboriginal groups was a painful and tragic tale of incomprehension and rapacity. Many European explorers reported contact with hostile “natives.” However, blame for the violent welcomes could often be placed on Europeans. Many of the Europeans believed that it was their right to take prisoners, slaves, and treasure whenever they desired. The earliest British settlers did not recognize Aboriginal rights to the land. They instead reported that the continent was terra nullius—a land unoccupied and unclaimed by prior inhabitants. They saw Aboriginal peoples as uncivilized relics of the Stone Age lacking agriculture, permanent habitations, written languages, and the use of metal.\n\nMany Aboriginal groups were physically or culturally exterminated, uprooted from land which held for them sacred, ceremonial, or hunting significance. The Europeans employed massacres, food poisoning, rape, and punitive expeditions. European diseases also took a heavy toll because the Aboriginal peoples had no immunity to them. Meanwhile, the settlers cleared large areas of land for farming, destroying the habitats of native plants and animals that Aboriginal peoples relied on for food. In addition, some of the animals that the Europeans brought with them escaped and multiplied in wild herds. The animals further damaged the natural ecosystems that Indigenous Australians had sustained for many generations before.\n\nSome Aboriginal peoples initially welcomed the new arrivals. They even believed, on occasion, that the light-skinned invaders were the returned ghosts of their ancestors. But in most areas Aboriginal groups responded to the invaders by fighting vicious guerrilla wars. White farmers and police responded with unmatched savagery and cruelty. They sometimes slaughtered Aboriginal men, women, and children in response to Aboriginal attacks or raids on sheep and cattle. Among the most notorious events were the Myall Creek Massacre in New South Wales and the Pinjarra Massacre in Western Australia. Eventually the settlers even set Aboriginal people against each other, ordering their newly trained and equipped Native Police to terrorize populations on the fringes of European settlements. They committed several atrocities, but the Europeans and their police often believed that they were only “defending” innocent people—and civilization itself—in a strange land.\n\nEuropean contact also brought great disruption and distress to the Torres Strait Islander peoples. Europeans began settling in the area in the 1860s. Soon, large quantities of pearl shells were discovered in the Torres Strait region. This led to the establishment of the pearling industry, which attracted many more foreigners. Pearlers of European descent forced Torres Strait Islander people to gather pearls in dangerous—and often deadly—conditions. Sea-cucumber fishing also drew many outsiders and led to abuse of Torres Strait Islander people. To control the lawlessness of the region and to regulate the marine industries, the colonial government of Queensland annexed the islands in the 1870s. Restrictive laws introduced by the government denied Torres Strait Islander peoples their land rights and freedom for many decades.\n\nThe arrival of Christian missionaries had a profound impact on the Torres Strait Islander peoples’ way of life. In the late 19th century, Christianity was widely adopted throughout the Torres Strait Islander communities. Torres Strait Islander peoples are still mainly Christian today. (See also Indigenous and European contact in Australia.)\n\nA New British Penal Colony\n\nCaptain James Cook’s first landfall in 1770 had been named Botany Bay to celebrate the large number of unfamiliar plants found there. The bay was recommended as suitable for a British penal (prison) settlement. For that reason the commander Arthur Phillip led the First Fleet to Australia from Portsmouth, England, in 1787. Phillip was the first governor-designate of New South Wales. The 11 ships set out with a complement of 443 seamen, 586 male and 192 female convicts, 211 marines, and officials, wives, and children. They arrived 250 days later, minus those who had died en route.\n\nFinding Botany Bay too exposed and lacking drinking water, Phillip investigated the next inlet north. There he “had the satisfaction of finding the finest harbour in the world, in which a thousand sail of the line may ride in the most perfect security.” It was Sydney Harbour. He selected a deepwater cove with a freshwater stream and named it Sydney Cove. He officially started the settlement on January 26, 1788, which is now celebrated as Australia Day.\n\nThe penal colony at Sydney was initially unable to feed itself. The people often lived on starvation rations. The colony offered only the most dismal prospects for economic development. For the first 30 years, its tiny population occupied an economic backwater as remote from the markets, finance, and technology of Europe as any place on Earth. But settlers finally managed to cross the Blue Mountains (an encircling knot of sandstone canyons) after 1813. Beyond the Blue Mountains they discovered the fertile inland plains—a vast area suitable for grazing livestock. Large-scale agricultural export trade then became possible. Stockmen drove their sheep and cattle inland, leaving behind a brutalized penal colony.\n\nExile to overseas convict settlements—the so-called “transportation” system—was a British punishment for more than 200 crimes. Conditions belowdecks on convict ships were appalling until surgeon-superintendents were assigned to all voyages after 1815. Once in Australia, prisoners found themselves 15,000 miles (24,000 kilometers) from their home country, to which most could never hope to return. Of all the convicts transported until 1868, when the system ended, 137,000 were males. They were mostly young and poor men from the industrial cities, and often thieves. Some 25,000 exiles were females. Not more than 1,000 were political prisoners, some 600 of them from Ireland. Another 4,000 Irish were transported for rebellious “land agitation.” For the first few decades, convicts outnumbered free settlers in New South Wales. Satellite penal stations were established, among them Port Arthur (in Tasmania), Norfolk Island, and Moreton Bay (now Brisbane).\n\nClergy in Britain eventually began questioning the “transportation” policy. They thought it might not be effective as a deterrent—that is, in preventing people from committing future crimes. They also wondered if, as a punishment, it might fail to reform criminals. In Australia the growing proportion of free settlers resented the stereotyping of all Australians as convicts, or the “convict stain.” The free colonists also feared competition from cheap labor. Only the wealthier rural landholders wanted to prolong “transportation.” They benefited from this system, which placed many convicts in private service. With good conduct the convicts could obtain a “ticket of leave” entitling them to work for wages, or even a conditional pardon—the condition being that they never return to Britain. Only about 15 percent of convicts were sentenced to chain gangs or actual prisons.\n\nMany escaped convicts, called bolters, became bushrangers, the Australian counterparts of Europe’s 19th-century highwaymen or the outlaws of the American West. Their crimes included stock thefts (cattle rustling), robbery of banks and mail coaches, and murder of policemen. Many bushrangers in New South Wales and Victoria roamed in well-organized gangs, often with the support of local residents. The most hardened criminals were sent to Van Diemen’s Land (now Tasmania), at Port Arthur and Macquarie Harbour. That is how many bushrangers became known as Vandemonians.\n\nBushrangers personified the antiauthoritarian aspects of the Australian character and the comradeship of the bush. They also became a symbol of the transplanted hatred of Irish Catholics for English Protestants and of the rivalry between immigrants and the native-born. They symbolized, too, the disorderliness of settlement itself, for all its rules and regulations. Bushrangers thus became part of Australian folklore. Among the most notorious were Jack Donohoe (the original “wild colonial boy”), Captain Thunderbolt, Mad Dog Morgan, Ben Hall, and the armor-clad Ned Kelly. Kelly’s exploits have since been portrayed by several Australian artists and writers, notably in a series of paintings by Sidney Nolan and a novel by Peter Carey.\n\nInland Conquest and Colonization\n\nThe map of inland Australia—as seen from a European perspective—was gradually and arduously compiled by the explorers who crossed its length and breadth between 1815 and 1939. White settlers who followed them pushed the pioneering frontier as far as they could into the arid center and the tropical north, first from the southeast and then from the southwest. Explorer John Oxley found only marshes but hoped they were the edges of a vast inland sea. That vision of a well-watered interior led other explorers astray. For example, Charles Sturt traced the Murray River to its outlet, but he later went half-blind in the blazing heat of the Simpson Desert.\n\nOthers forged overland links between the coastal ports. In 1824 Hamilton Hume and William Hovell were the first to traverse the 540 miles (870 kilometers) between what are now the cities of Sydney and Melbourne. In 1840 Edward John Eyre set out to find a land route between the colonies of South Australia and Western Australia. After heading north from Adelaide, he traveled west across the Nullarbor Plain and reached Albany in mid-1841. Ludwig Leichhardt discovered a route across reliable rivers from Brisbane to Darwin in 1844–45. He vanished without a trace on a second expedition. And while all these European adventures were being conducted, Aboriginal trade routes and connections between clans were being severely disrupted, even destroyed in some places.\n\nThe race to cross the continent from south to north pitted Robert O’Hara Burke and William John Wills against John McDouall Stuart. Burke and Wills left from Victoria, while Stuart started in South Australia. Burke and Wills reached the Gulf of Carpentaria first, but they died of starvation on the return journey. Stuart crossed the very center of the continent to reach Darwin.\n\nGovernors were generous in granting land to free settlers, marines, military officers, and freed convicts. Actual sales of land began in 1825, but many stockmen became wealthy by taking over unsold land as squatters. So uncontrolled was the spread of settlement inland that the government drew an artificial cordon around an area surrounding Sydney called the Nineteen Counties. Settlers were forbidden to trespass outside that area. By 1836 this unworkable arrangement had to be abandoned. Grazing rights were permitted in these remote squatting districts for an annual fee of 10 pounds sterling. However, these land grants and sales to Europeans were simultaneously land robberies from Aboriginal peoples.\n\nWool and Gold\n\nThe economy of Australia developed around two key activities: agriculture and mining. The most valuable agricultural product was wool. By the 1830s, settlers had discovered that Australia, with its vast fertile plains in the east, was well suited for producing fine wool. The most notable among the founders of Australia’s wool industry was John Macarthur. He set up a grazing estate in New South Wales and studied the wool market in England. Macarthur’s estate became the dominant force in Australia’s wool trade. He established the practice of importing Merino sheep, which would become the basis of the industry. The export of wool to Europe helped fuel the growth of Australia’s economy as a whole.\n\nThe first significant mineral discovery was that of copper in South Australia (1842 and 1845). Much more remarkable, however, were a series of gold discoveries made from 1851 onward, first in east-central New South Wales and then throughout Victoria. The gold rushes that followed these discoveries had profound and far-reaching impacts on Australian development. The colonial governors had suppressed reports of gold discoveries between 1823 and 1844 for fear of rampant disorder. They reversed this policy when the great California Gold Rush of 1848 lured many Australians to the United States.\n\nThe first officially acknowledged gold discovery was that by Edward Hargraves in 1851 at Ophir. Other finds attracted such an influx of miners into New South Wales that Victorians, already suffering from a labor shortage, were galvanized into offering a reward for the first discovery of payable gold in that state. It was won by James Esmond at Clunes. Much richer finds were made later in 1851 at Castlemaine, Bendigo, and Ballarat—which at the time boasted the richest alluvial goldfield ever discovered.\n\nVictoria’s richer goldfields were also more compact and accessible than those of the other eastern states. During the 1850s, Victoria produced 87 percent of the total Australian gold and 35 percent of world production. Its population boomed from 97,000 to 539,000, an increase larger than that of the entire previous population of Australia. Victoria became the most populous colony, and “marvelous Melbourne” the continent’s largest city.\n\nThe gold rushes of the 1850s tripled Australia’s population. They also created a demand for suffrage (voting rights) and empowered the cities to challenge what had previously been a rural monopoly in capital and government. Gold also cast aside the “convict stain” and pumped wealth into a diversifying economy. The economy entered a long boom from 1860 to 1890.\n\nGold also brought social and political strife to some areas. Grievances over the licensing of mining claims gave rise to violence at Ballarat. There, rebellious miners built a fortification called the Eureka Stockade in 1854. The police and the miners, led by Peter Lalor, traded deadly shots. After the incident, the government redressed most of the miners’ grievances. These rebels are sentimentally credited with the first call for an Australian democracy.\n\nIn addition, some European-descended settlers began to resist the flow of gold-induced immigration, particularly when Chinese miners began to arrive in Australia in 1853. By 1858 the Chinese constituted one-fifth of the mining population of Victoria and 11 percent of its total population. Racially motivated riots broke out. Restrictions were placed on Chinese immigration in Victoria (1855), South Australia (1857), and New South Wales (1861). These were the ripening seeds of the White Australia Policy.\n\nOther gold rushes helped populate north Queensland, at Rockhampton (1858), Gympie (1867), Charters Towers (1872), and Mount Morgan, the “mountain of gold” (1882). But many ghost towns and “moon” landscapes of mine tailings were created as deposits were exhausted. Victorian production had slumped by the 1890s. Then, in Western Australia, Paddy Hannan picked up what he thought was a stone to throw at a crow, only to discover that it was a gold nugget. Thus began the 1893 rush to Coolgardie and the genesis of the fabled Golden Mile at nearby Kalgoorlie. The area’s mines declined in the early 20th century. However, their revival in the 1980s helped make Australia one of the world’s leading producers of gold today.\n\nThe Industrial Revolution\n\nThe Industrial Revolution—the transition from mostly agricultural economies to those dominated by machine-based manufacturing—began in Britain in the late 18th century. From there it spread to other parts of the world. The Industrial Revolution had a strong impact on the Australian economy in the 19th century. The technology that originated in Britain would enable Australians to improve the productivity of their industries. It also allowed them to deal with the vast distances between their colonies and to ease the export of goods from their remote continent.\n\nThe driving force behind new Australian inventions in the 19th century was the steam engine. Its potential to increase Australia’s productivity was recognized by early colonists. John Dickson, an engineer, had manufactured steam engines in London before emigrating to Sydney in 1813. There, using an engine he brought with him, he built Australia’s first steam-powered flour mill.\n\nSteam power played a valuable role during the gold rushes of the 1850s. After miners exhausted the supplies of gold near the surface, gold became much more difficult to reach. Miners who had come from Britain used the knowledge they had acquired back home to introduce steam-powered machinery for mining gold that was deep underground. One such device was the steam pump, which was used to remove water from deep mines.\n\nAgriculture also benefited from advances in technology. Before the Industrial Revolution, farmwork was done almost entirely by manual labor, with the aid of horses and bulls. New inventions made during the 1800s began to reduce the burden on laborers while also increasing productivity. In 1843 a horse-drawn machine for harvesting wheat was introduced in South Australia. The invention is generally attributed to John Ridley, though John Wrathall Bull designed a similar machine around the same time. Another invention to come out of South Australia was the stump-jump plow. It was introduced in the 1870s by the brothers Richard Bowyer Smith and Clarence Herbert Smith. This new type of plow was able to glide over tree stumps and rocks rather than get stuck on them. By making it much easier to cultivate cleared scrublands, the stump-jump plow greatly expanded the land available for planting crops.The Australian wool industry—by then the world’s largest—was revolutionized by the replacement of manual clipping tools by a sheep-shearing machine in 1887. Invented by Frederick Wolseley, the steam-powered shearing machine led to a rapid increase in wool production.\n\nThe technology of the Industrial Revolution also transformed transportation in Australia. These improvements were crucial to economic growth because farmers needed efficient and affordable ways to ship their products across vast distances both within Australia and overseas. The first steam-powered ships in Australia were launched in Sydney in 1831. In 1853 paddle steamers navigated the Murray River for the first time. Over the next 60 years, about 300 paddle steamers operated on the Murray-Darling river system. The ships provided access to inland farming regions and cattle and sheep stations of southeastern Australia. River transport also encouraged the expansion of settlements by carrying passengers and supplies to previously isolated areas.\n\nAt the same time that river transport was expanding, Australia experienced a railroad boom. The first railway in Australia was opened in Victoria in 1854. From then on, construction proceeded remarkably quickly, especially in the 1880s. Between 1875 and 1891 the total track length rose from 1,600 miles (2,600 kilometers) to more than 10,000 miles (16,000 kilometers). Tracks reached as far as 500 miles (800 kilometers) inland. By then, railroads had replaced steamships as the primary means of transporting goods within Australia. They boosted agricultural industries, especially wheat production, by giving farmers a more efficient way to move their products to cities and to the coast for export. The railways also provided a much faster means of overland passenger travel, which until then had depended on horse-drawn vehicles. Towns sprang up and prospered around the railway lines.\n\nThe development of oceangoing steamships encouraged immigration to Australia as well as international trade. Speedy clipper ships cut the length of the journey from Australia to England almost in half. The opening of the Suez Canal (between the Mediterranean and Red seas) in 1869 also dramatically reduced the time it took for a ship to sail between Europe and Australia. The clipper called the SS Great Britain, the largest ship in the world at the time, carried more than 15,000 passengers between England and Australia from 1852 to 1876. In the 1880s, clipper ships began to be fitted with refrigeration machines. Australia had been exporting canned meat since 1847; now it could ship perishable meat as well. By the early 1900s Australia had emerged as one of the world’s major food exporters.\n\nCommunications expanded at an unprecedented pace during this period. By the 1850s there were post offices in most Australian towns. Telegraphy became widespread in the 1860s. The completion of the Overland Telegraph Line in 1870–72 was a remarkable feat. It was a line some 2,000 miles (3,200 kilometers) long that ran across the deserts from Adelaide to Darwin and then underwater as cable to the island of Java, which was already linked to Europe. Telephone exchanges were established in the major cities during the 1870s.\n\nSome of the new links with the rest of the globe brought tragedy rather than prosperity, however. In the 1800s and early 1900s, Australia saw the arrival of pandemics of measles, smallpox, Asian flu, and bubonic plague. Quarantine regulations were put in place to protect both agriculture and human health. In addition, Australia was affected by a global economic depression in the 1890s.\n\nFederation and Independence\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century, some Australian politicians raised the possibility of uniting the colonies into one country. This idea is called federation. Australians feared invasion from the north by Europeans or Asians or both, and one motive for federation was the need for a united defense. Another motive was that a united Australia would be able to restrict immigration from Asia more effectively. Advocates also argued that federation would encourage free trade and thereby improve the Australian economy.\n\nThe federation movement received a boost in 1889 with a famous speech delivered by Henry Parkes, the premier of New South Wales. A longtime advocate of federation, Parkes urged the colonies to create “a great national government for all Australia.” The speech, delivered in the town of Tenterfield, became known as the Tenterfield Oration. Parkes is remembered as the Father of Federation.\n\nIn 1891 Parkes led the National Australasian Convention in Sydney. Each of the colonies, along with New Zealand, sent representatives to the convention. The convention drafted a national constitution. The document was inspired by the federal system of government adopted by the founders of the United States, who had also had the task of uniting colonies into a single country. It laid out a federal system in which a national parliament shared power with state parliaments. Though the convention approved the draft constitution, the colonial parliaments were less enthusiastic. While they dealt with an economic depression, they put the idea of federation aside.\n\nAmong the Australian people, however, support for federation was growing. Federation leagues were formed in most colonies, and in 1893 they gathered for a landmark conference in the New South Wales town of Corowa. The key figure at the Corowa Conference was John Quick, a legislator from Victoria who proposed that Australian citizens be allowed to elect representatives to a second constitutional convention. The draft constitution created at the convention would then be subject to approval by voters in a series of referendums.\n\nQuick’s plan was adopted by a majority of the Australian colonies. In 1897–98 the second constitutional convention was held. All of the colonies except Queensland sent representatives to the convention, which approved a draft constitution in March 1898. Voters in Victoria, Tasmania, and South Australia soon approved the document. However, those in New South Wales rejected it. Queensland and Western Australia did not hold referendums at all. After the colonial leaders met to revise the constitution, every colony except Western Australia held new referendums in 1899. This time the constitution was approved. The British Parliament passed the Constitution Act in 1900. Soon after, Western Australia finally voted in favor of federation.\n\nThe Commonwealth of Australia officially came into existence on January 1, 1901. The six colonies then became six states. Interstate customs barriers and tariffs fell, and a phase of integration and economic growth began. The federal government began to plan the development of a national capital at Canberra. In the states, the constitutions, legislatures, and laws continued to operate as before, though federal laws now took precedence. The new country’s population included about 3.8 million Australians of European ancestry and an unknown, or at least uncounted, number of Aboriginal people.\n\nEarly Economic and Social Policies\n\nAustralia’s government initially protected local industries from competition with foreign competitors. This economic strategy is now called import substitution industrialization. The government carried out this “protection” mainly by using high tariff barriers (taxes on imports) to raise the prices of foreign-produced goods. This encouraged Australians to buy locally manufactured goods instead.\n\nThe government sought to use tariffs not only to protect Australian industries but also to benefit workers. The early 1900s were a time of disputes between business owners and their employees, who demanded better pay and safer working conditions. Australians generally believed that workers should share in the country’s growing prosperity in the form of better living standards. Under the Australian constitution, the government did not have the power to regulate wages or working conditions. In 1906, however, the government of Prime Minister Alfred Deakin tried to influence wages indirectly by passing a tax on goods manufactured in Australia. The government exempted companies that paid their workers “fair and reasonable” wages.\n\nThe tax passed by Deakin’s government became the subject of a landmark court case in 1907. Hugh Victor McKay, whose Sunshine Harvester Works produced a hugely successful machine for harvesting grain, challenged the tax by applying for an exemption. The case was heard by Justice Henry Bourne Higgins, president of the government’s Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. Higgins listened to testimony from both workers and their wives in determining fair pay for those supporting a family. He ruled that a fair wage for an unskilled worker was seven shillings a day—considerably higher than what Sunshine Harvester Works was paying. McKay appealed the ruling, and the High Court ruled in 1908 that the Harvester judgment was unconstitutional. Nevertheless, the ruling was a milestone in Australian labor law because it introduced the idea that businesses should consider not only profit but also the needs of their employees. The Harvester judgment became the basis of Australia’s minimum wage system.\n\nOther new laws extended social services. In 1908 Parliament passed the Invalid and Old-Age Pensions Act. Under the act, weekly payments were made to elderly and disabled Australians who met certain income and residency requirements. In 1912 the government introduced a maternity allowance act. It provided a onetime payment to women who gave birth, to cover medical care for themselves and their babies.\n\nIndigenous Australians were not able to receive any of those payments, however. Asians and Pacific islanders were likewise ineligible to receive those government benefits. Their exclusion reflected the strong anti-immigrant sentiment of the time. Parliament had already demonstrated the government’s goal of maintaining Australia’s British heritage by passing the Immigration Restriction Act in 1901. The act effectively stopped all non-European immigration into the country. It was the hallmark of the White Australia Policy, which would remain in force until the mid-20th century.\n\nWorld War I and Gallipoli\n\nThe newly created Commonwealth of Australia remained a staunchly loyal ally of the British Empire. After Britain declared war against Germany on August 4, 1914, Australia quickly formed the Australian Imperial Force (AIF), an expeditionary army of 20,000 men. New Zealand soldiers joined the AIF to form the ANZACs (Australian and New Zealand Army Corps).\n\nIn April 1915 the ANZACs were shipped to the Dardanelles, Turkey’s narrow strait between the Mediterranean and Black seas, near Istanbul. The plan was to capture the Gallipoli Peninsula from the Ottoman Empire, which was an ally of Germany’s. However, the date of the ANZAC’s dawn landing, April 25, is still remembered solemnly as Anzac Day because of the eight months of slaughter that it initiated. The Turks were prepared, entrenched, and determined to withstand the invasion. By the time the British and ANZAC forces withdrew, they had suffered heavy casualties. More than 8,700 Australians died. Despite the bloodiness and futility of the campaign, the ANZAC survivors came home as heroes. Military recruitment boomed amidst waves of sympathetic patriotism.\n\nOf the more than 330,000 Australians who served in World War I, more than 60,000 died, including many thousands in battles near Ypres, Belgium. Australians suffered the highest ratio of deaths to total national population of any country in the British Commonwealth. In addition, the deadly flu pandemic of 1918 arrived on Australian shores, partly because of the troop massing and movements associated with the war.\n\nWorld War I boosted Australians’ sense of nationalism. It also began a tradition of fighting in foreign wars in the expectation that grateful allies would in turn defend Australia. However, the war left the Australian government with a massive foreign debt. (For a detailed account of Australia’s involvement in the war, see Australia in World War I.)\n\nBetween the Wars\n\nAustralia became increasingly connected to Europe and North America. The first direct flight from England reached Australia in 1919. Charles Edward Kingsford Smith later piloted the first flights across Australia (from Melbourne to Perth) and across the Tasman Sea to New Zealand.\n\nMany economic changes took place after World War I. Australians built more factories and unionized more factory workers. Broken Hill, the “Silver City,” was built on the world’s richest lode of lead and zinc. Its labor unionists created the militant Barrier Industrial Council. Its members walked out on strike for 18 months in 1919–20 until they won major concessions. Socialist trade unions fought for benefits for injured workers and limits to the length of the workday. Their successes angered right-wing, paramilitary reactionaries, who established the Who’s for Australia League in 1929 and the New Guard in 1931. The novelist D.H. Lawrence anticipated their extremism in Kangaroo (1923).\n\nRailway construction steadily carried the agricultural frontier inland, peaking in 1941. However, the use of three different rail gauges (widths) of track complicated these efforts. Sprawling port cities were consolidated with the opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge in 1932 and of Brisbane’s Story Bridge in 1940.\n\nMeanwhile, the Aboriginal peoples continued to fare poorly. Brutal frontier violence against them persisted in some places, and their numbers continued to drop. The state governments had begun to move Aboriginal groups to large reserves, typically in isolated arid areas. By 1930 only about 67,000 Aboriginal people remained in Australia.\n\nAustralia, like most of the world, was struck by the economic calamity called the Great Depression of the 1930s. Prices for wool and wheat fell until Australian export income was half what it had been in 1928. Australian currency was devalued. By some estimates, unemployment rose to as much as 29 percent. Many Australians suffered from extreme poverty. In New South Wales the state treasury exhausted its reserves and could not pay public servants for two months. The state governments created jobs for the unemployed by starting massive water supply and sewerage projects, building roads, and providing services to rural areas.\n\nHappier economic times returned by the late 1930s. This gave white Australians an additional reason to celebrate their land’s 150th anniversary in 1938. Yet, Aboriginal people observed it as a day of mourning. By World War II the major Australian industries included iron and steel, building products, engineering, electrical goods, clothing, printing, and motor assembly.\n\nWorld War II\n\nAustralia entered World War II on September 3, 1939, the moment that Britain declared war on Germany and its allies. Australia sent troops to fight in Greece, Crete, Syria, and North Africa, among other places. In Libya the Australian “Rats of Tobruk” withstood a siege for many months until relief arrived. The Royal Australian Air Force made several dangerous raids against Germany.\n\nThe British Royal Navy was Australia’s first line of defense. However, the British seemed powerless to stop the Japanese from capturing Singapore and from bombing Darwin—both of which happened in February 1942. Of the 130,000 prisoners taken at Singapore, more than 15,000 were Australian. At Darwin the Japanese sank or damaged 16 ships, destroyed 20 aircraft, and killed 243 people. This was the first assault on Australia since 1788. The Japanese also bombed the northern coastal towns of Broome, Wyndham, Derby, Katherine, Port Hedland, and Townsville. Australians knew that Perth was closer to Singapore than it was to the Royal Australian Navy in Sydney Harbour, but most showed Britain their fervent support.\n\nThe Japanese were then in control of virtually all of Southeast Asia and most of the critical Pacific islands. They next set their sights on Port Moresby, the principal town of New Guinea (now in Papua New Guinea). The Japanese also planned to seize the United States base in the Midway Islands. At this point, during the first half of 1942, the tide of combat began to turn against Japan. In the Battle of the Coral Sea, United States and Australian warships defeated Japanese invaders. In New Guinea—at Milne Bay, Rabaul, and along the Kokoda Track—Australians helped repulse the Japanese, hounding their retreat into the Solomon Islands and Borneo. Australia became a major United States base for Pacific operations. By 1943 there were 120,000 United States troops stationed there, under the command of General Douglas MacArthur.\n\nThe war brought great demand for Australia’s minerals and industrial products. Many industries were moved inland, away from coastal targets. In addition, Prime Minister John Curtin instituted the rationing of food, gasoline, and some clothing. He curtailed travel and investment and extended conscription (the draft). The volunteer Women’s Land Army boosted food production, and 9,000 women became nurses. Uniform taxation was introduced in 1942. The federal government became, and has remained, the sole levier of income tax. Its Commonwealth Bank became a central bank, and its Treasury Department took over national economic policy.\n\nVictory in Europe came in May 1945. Japan surrendered on August 15, 1945, after the United States dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. By that time, Australian enlistment had totaled nearly 1 million men and women. Among them there were more than 35,000 war-related deaths. Of the more than 22,000 Australians taken prisoner by the Japanese, more than 8,000 died in captivity. Many of them died from starvation in such camps as Singapore’s Changi or from forced labor on the Burma railroad.\n\nPostwar Developments\n\nAbout 766,000 immigrants arrived in Australia between 1947 and 1955. Some European-descended Australians reacted to this in discriminatory ways. Meanwhile, others underscored Australian identity and accomplishments rather than the European culture and history that had once been regarded as paramount. Debates emerged regarding the future of Australian society. Would the Australia of the future become a multicultural, multiracial society because of the small but growing number of Asian immigrants? Or would people attempt to resist further ethnic and racial changes?\n\nIn the past, Australia’s universities had never offered courses in Australian literature. They had regarded Australian history as a primitive subspecies of British history. After World War II, however, the universities found themselves enthralled by Australian studies programs. Soprano Joan Sutherland, writer Patrick White, publisher Rupert Murdoch, and the country’s sporting heroes and heroines made the world their stage and Australia its spotlight. Such “ethnic” soccer teams as West Adelaide Hellas, Marconi Fairfield (now Marconi Stallions), and Melbourne Croatia (now Melbourne Knights) changed the nature of sporting rivalries. Japanese surpassed French, Italian, and German as the most commonly studied foreign language in Australian schools.\n\nIn the realm of international politics, Australia maintained the strong ties that it had forged with the United States during World War II. The two countries established a firm alliance during the Cold War. Australia eagerly signed the ANZUS Treaty with New Zealand and the United States in 1951. Unfortunately, under that treaty Australia committed to an ultimately worthless policy of “forward defense” by sending troops to fight in Korea, Malaysia, and Vietnam from the 1950s to the early 1970s. Australia also joined the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) in 1954 after French Indochina disintegrated. (See also Vietnam War.)\n\nThe Cold War was not only an issue in foreign affairs—it had a major impact on Australia’s domestic politics as well. The event that brought the Cold War into Australian politics is known as the Petrov Affair. Vladimir and Evdokia Petrov were Soviet spies who came to Australia in 1951. They fell out of favor with the Soviet government. however, and in 1954 they defected to Australia. Liberal Prime Minister Robert Menzies, a strong opponent of communism, named a commission to investigate. Vladimir Petrov’s secret documents implicated staff members of Herbert Vere Evatt, leader of the opposition Labor Party. Evatt accused the Menzies government of forging the documents to damage the Labor Party leading up to the 1954 election. Evatt’s conspiracy theory led anticommunist members of the Labor Party to break away and form the Democratic Labor Party. The split drastically weakened the Labor Party, which would not regain power until 1972.\n\nDuring the 1950s and ’60s Britain, with the approval of the Australian government, used Australia as the site of a nuclear testing program. The program included 12 detonations of nuclear weapons along with hundreds of other experiments involving weapon components. The British tested their first atomic bomb at the Montebello Islands, off the coast of Western Australia, in 1952. They went on to detonate two more devices at Montebello and nine in the Outback of South Australia: seven at Maralinga and two at Emu Field. Almost all of the other experiments took place at Maralinga. The testing program ended in 1963, but the Maralinga site in particular remained contaminated long after. Local Aboriginal peoples suffered lung disease and other illnesses that have been attributed to the tests. The British government carried out two ineffective cleanup operations in the 1960s. Conditions improved after a larger cleanup effort in the 1990s, though many continued to believe that the area was unsafe.\n\nDespite the cooperation on nuclear testing, Australia generally shifted away from its 200-year connection with Great Britain during the postwar period. Meanwhile, Britain turned more toward the rest of Europe. Britain later hurt Australian agricultural exports by joining the European Economic Community (the forerunner of the European Union, or EU) in 1973. To symbolize the growing distance from its old mother country, Australia changed its monetary unit to the Australian dollar in 1966. It replaced traditional British pounds, shillings, and pence with easily calculated dollars and cents.\n\nUntil the oil crisis that was engineered by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in 1973, the Australian economy boomed. Unemployment remained quite low—below 2 percent of the workforce. A materialistic modern consumer society emerged. Home ownership rose from 50 percent in 1945 to 70 percent by the 1960s.\n\nAfter 1973 Australia’s traditional exports suffered because of serious fluctuations in the prices of basic commodities such as wool, minerals, and foodstuffs. Synthetic substitutes for wool and other raw materials also hurt Australia’s exports. As a result, Australia’s inflation rate rose and economic growth slowed. However, this situation was changed by a mining boom, mainly because of deposits of hematite (iron-ore crystals) in Pilbara. Initially financed by American and British interests, the Pilbara region was developed with new ports, railroads, and highways, and new housing spread across the formerly open landscape. Australia became a leading exporter of iron ore. The huge Pilbara mines at Mount Tom Price, Newman, and Paraburdoo became household words. Mineral exports surpassed those of agricultural products by 1980. Significant economic growth also came from developments in the oil and gas fields of Bass Strait and the desert interior, the Snowy Mountains hydroelectric scheme, and the tourist islands of the Great Barrier Reef.\n\nThe decade of 1975–85 brought major economic uncertainties. Oil prices rose, and the commodities markets were erratic. There were two recessions during that period. It was also the heyday of corporate raiders. Unemployment peaked in 1983 at 10 percent. When the traditionally socialist Labor government won federal office in 1983, it startled the business community by deregulating the financial system (exposing it to world market forces and corporate raiding). The government also allowed a 10 percent devaluation of the Australian dollar to offset reverses in the terms of trade. Beginning in the 1980s, Australia followed an international trend toward lower tariffs. In the 1990s it signed onto major agreements as part of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and other “free trade” confederations.\n\nReorientation Toward Asia\n\nAlthough it remained a firm ally of the United States, after 1980 Australia took a more independent stance internationally. The country began to focus on economic and diplomatic issues affecting the Pacific Rim rather than embracing the old militaristic and white-supremacist attitudes. The pace of modernization quickened, and Australians increasingly viewed themselves within the context of Asia. This shift was also aided by conversion to the metric system by 1981. Between 1983 and 1989, foreign investment in Australia grew, especially from British, American, and Japanese sources. Australia phased out import tariffs on industrial goods. Such government enterprises as Qantas, the Commonwealth Bank, Telecom, and Australian Airlines seemed ripe for privatization. Overseas visitors arrived in swelling numbers, up from 23,236 in 1925 to 2.4 million in 1991.\n\nBob Hawke was first elected prime minister in 1983, and he became the first Labor Party leader to serve more than two consecutive terms. He was called the most popular prime minister in Australian history. However, in December 1991 he was undone by a steep recession. The unemployment rate rose to more than 10 percent, and several major banks failed. His party voted him out of the leadership post, and Paul Keating—his former treasurer—succeeded him. The recession would later be seen as part of a worldwide economic downturn.\n\nThe sudden end of the Cold War in 1991 accelerated the Australian reorientation toward Asia. This brought new opportunities for profit and jobs. The economies of East Asia, from Japan and South Korea in the north to Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore in the south, became dynamos of productivity. They also became vital trading partners for Australia.\n\nKeating cemented relationships with Japan, Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea. But he played on nationalist sentiment by alienating the British on several issues. These issues included a demand for a new Australian flag and accusations that Britain had failed to defend Commonwealth countries adequately during World War II. Controversy still surrounds the national anthem and flag because of their obvious symbolic attachments to Great Britain. Liberal Party leader John Howard succeeded Keating as prime minister in 1996.\n\nA New Australia\n\nBy the end of the 20th century, Australian society had matured to a level that would be almost incomprehensible to the early colonizers. In many ways it had become an Americanized consumer society. The country was under the influence of powerful corporations, and its people were increasingly addicted to electronic media and fast-food restaurants. Yet the state had also developed several welfare programs to protect its citizens. Among these protections were a 40-hour working week since 1939, a pharmaceutical benefits plan since 1950, and a national health plan since 1975. The federal government instituted universal health care with the Medicare program in 1984.\n\nBy the late 1900s, Australia was attracting a large amount of international attention. Brisbane was the site of World Expo 88, which drew more than 18 million visitors. Australia’s lavish 200th anniversary celebrations in 1988 were another tourism sensation. However, the anniversary was also marked by demonstrations. Aboriginal peoples protested against past abuses by European colonists and their governments as well as ongoing discrimination in Australian society.\n\nFor much of the century, growing numbers of non-Aboriginal Australians, including scholars, politicians, and individual citizens, were concerned with Aboriginal problems. The federal government finally granted Australian citizenship and the right to vote to all Aboriginal people in the 1960s. Many Australians, however, continued to marginalize and condemn Aboriginal peoples—effectively blaming them for their overall high levels of poverty and alcoholism, low levels of education, and other problems. The vexing question of Aboriginal land rights remained unresolved.\n\nState and federal government policies had been designed to assimilate Indigenous Australians into the dominant (white) society. Official policy had included taking Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children—especially those of mixed Indigenous and white ancestry—away from their parents. The children were placed in orphanages and forced to undergo European-style education. These children later became known as the Stolen Generations. The governments enforced these types of policies from 1939 until the 1970s, when they were replaced by a policy of integration marked by tolerance of diversity. Aboriginal communities have gained legal recognition since then. Debates continue, however, regarding reparations for past abuses and compensation for lands that were taken from their ancestors.\n\nIn 1992 the High Court issued its famous “Mabo decision.” It ruled that Eddie Mabo and other members of a group of Torres Strait Islander people owned customary title to their land. This established a legal precedent for other Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples who were seeking rights to their traditional lands. Some farmers, mining companies, and business investors objected to the ruling. They argued that they could no longer sign farming contracts, prospect for minerals, or make other vital financial decisions—all because land ownership was now unclear. These groups were joined in their opposition by some politicians. Nevertheless, Australia’s Parliament put the Mabo decision into law in 1993 by passing the Native Title Act. The act opened a new era of Indigenous land-rights claims. It also helped make Aboriginal descent a matter of pride. By the early 21st century, the number of Australians affirming themselves to be Aboriginal was more than a half million.\n\nIn 1998 Australia’s Parliament voted to turn the country into a fully independent republic by severing Australia’s last, largely symbolic ties to the British crown. In a public referendum in 1999, however, 55 percent of Australians voted to retain some ceremonial ties with the British monarchy. They also voted to keep the parliamentary system of government rather than changing Australia to a republic headed by a president.\n\nDuring the early 2000s, Australians faced several environmental concerns. Among them were the thinning of Earth’s protective ozone layer and the conservation of natural resources and parks. Other issues included droughts and threats to coastal areas and vegetation due to global warming, including the risk that rising temperatures could fuel increasingly destructive storms and El Niño events. Australians also faced concerns over race relations and ethnic tolerance. Yet there were great reasons for optimism, too. The economy was strong and diversified. And people were mostly looking to the justice system and political process to resolve grievances (such as the Aboriginal land disputes) rather than turning to extremist violence.\n\nIn international affairs, the United States called for assistance in its “war on terrorism”—particularly in the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 and the controversial invasion of Iraq in 2003. Australia eventually contributed logistics, air transport, ships, and military advisers for both those wars. In addition, Australia continued to provide military and civil personnel to its neighbors. They included the young republic of East Timor (formerly a part of Indonesia), the Solomon Islands, and Papua New Guinea, where corruption and crime were major problems.\n\nPolitical Developments\n\nPrime Minister John Howard headed a coalition government of the Liberal and National parties from 1996. He won reelection three times. Howard became known for taking a hard line against illegal immigration. His refusal to allow boat refugees to seek asylum in the country in 2001 proved popular among many Australians. His sending troops to help fight the U.S.-led war in Iraq ultimately proved much less so. Howard also introduced several controversial reforms to labor laws, such as limiting the ability of workers to sue their employers for being unfairly fired.\n\nAfter more than a decade of conservative government, Australians voted the Labor Party into power in the elections of 2007. Labor Party leader Kevin Rudd became prime minister. Howard lost not only that post but also the seat he had held in Parliament for more than 30 years. The new administration soon began reversing several policies of its predecessor, notably by ratifying the Kyoto Protocol on climate change and by withdrawing Australia’s combat troops from Iraq. In an attempt to bring about a new “healing of the nation” in its race relations, on February 13, 2008, Rudd made a historic formal apology to the Stolen Generations and other Indigenous Australians for past abuses they had suffered under the Australian government.\n\nDuring the global economic downturn of 2008–09, Rudd introduced large economic stimulus packages. Australia was one of the few developed countries that managed to avoid entering a recession. Nevertheless, Rudd’s popularity declined rapidly in 2010 owing to policy setbacks. His carbon emissions trading scheme to combat climate change had failed to gain passage. When Rudd withdrew the legislation, which was the centerpiece of his environmental program, some criticized him as being too timid. He also faced vocal opposition from business groups to a large proposed tax on mining.\n\nIn June 2010 Rudd stepped down when his deputy prime minister, Julia Gillard, challenged his position as party leader. Gillard became both the Labor Party leader and Australia’s first woman prime minister. Shortly after taking office, Gillard called for a new election, which took place in late August. The results were extremely close, and neither Labor nor the Liberals won an outright majority in the House of Representatives. Labor ultimately secured the backing of several independent and Green members of Parliament, allowing Gillard to form a minority government in early September.\n\nGillard’s term as prime minister yielded mixed results. She was praised for her handling of the eastern Australia floods in 2010–11, yet she failed to produce major policy successes on immigration and climate change. Gillard did not fare much better as the Labor Party leader. Her term was clouded by Rudd’s numerous unsuccessful challenges to her position. Her tumultuous reign led to a decline in both party and personal popularity. In June 2013 Gillard called for a leadership vote in the Labor Party, and she was defeated by Rudd. Gillard then resigned as prime minister and was succeeded by Rudd. Labor Party infighting, a slowing national economy, and controversy over the Australian government’s immigration policy contributed to Labor’s continuing slippage in public approval. Rudd’s tenure as prime minister lasted only a matter of months. In the general election of September 7, 2013, the Liberal-National coalition, led by Liberal party chief Tony Abbott, was swept to victory.\n\nAs prime minister, Abbott instituted several policies that proved to be popular with many Australians. These policies included turning away boats carrying asylum seekers and giving approved refugees only temporary, three-year visas. He also repealed taxes on greenhouse-gas emitters and on profits from iron-ore and coal mining. As his administration went on, however, his other economic policies and his social conservatism drew criticism, and his administration’s approval ratings fell. A party leadership challenge from Malcolm Turnbull in September 2015 resulted in Abbott’s defeat and Turnbull’s rise to prime minister. In the 2016 federal elections, the Liberal-National coalition retained power by a narrow margin, and Turnbull was returned to office.\n\nTurnbull, as a moderate, faced challenges from conservatives within the coalition. One issue that divided the government was same-sex marriage. Turnbull was a strong advocate of legalizing the practice, but many conservatives disagreed. In November 2017 the government held a national poll in which Australians voted 62 percent to 38 percent in favor of legalization. In the following weeks both houses of Parliament approved a bill that made same-sex marriage the law of the land.\n\nOpinion within the ruling coalition was also divided on energy and climate policy. In August 2018, responding to opposition from conservatives, Turnbull scrapped his proposal to set a target for reducing Australia’s carbon emissions. Following that defeat, a weakened Turnbull faced a challenge for leadership of the Liberal Party from Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton. Turnbull survived by a vote of 48 to 35, but the Liberal Party held another vote just days later. This time Turnbull was ousted as party leader in favor of Scott Morrison, the country’s treasurer. Morrison was sworn in as Australia’s new prime minister on August 24, 2018.\n\nUnder Morrison’s leadership the Australian economy continued to prosper, though the housing market worsened. The Labor Party argued that the benefits of the robust economy had not been shared across Australian society. Labor was also critical of the Liberal-National coalition’s energy policy and approach to climate change. The Labor Party was favored to win the May 2019 federal elections, but Morrison and his Liberal-National coalition scored a stunning victory to maintain power.\n\nMany observers blamed the effects of climate change when hugely destructive bushfires raged throughout Australia beginning in September 2019. Record heat, prolonged drought, high winds, lightning, and scattered incidences of arson all contributed to the widespread bushfire outbreaks. The fires affected every Australian state and continued into early 2020. By the first week of January, nearly 18 million acres (7 million hectares) of land had burned countrywide, and more than two dozen people had died because of the fires.\n\nIn the two years that followed, climate change also appeared to have intensified the effects of the La Niña weather pattern, which led to destructive flooding. In years when this pattern occurs, it typically increases rainfall in eastern and northern Australia. Prolonged, unusually heavy rainfall caused devastating flooding in New South Wales in March 2021 and in Queensland and New South Wales from February to May 2022. The record-breaking floods forced tens of thousands of people from their homes.\n\nMeanwhile, like other countries around the world, Australia had to contend with a pandemic of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. The Australian government took aggressive steps early on to try to contain the spread of the virus. It enforced strict lockdown and social-distancing measures. It also introduced widespread testing and carefully coordinated contact tracing. Because of these efforts, Australia weathered the public health crisis much better than most other countries. Far fewer Australians died of COVID-19 than did people in other large countries, such as the United States and Brazil.\n\nThe rollout of the national campaign to vaccinate people against the virus was relatively slow. In July 2021 Morrison announced a four-phase plan aimed at returning the country to normal life. The plan tied the removal of quarantine requirements and international travel restrictions to the achievement of a series of vaccination targets. By January 2022 more than 90 percent of eligible Australians had been vaccinated. As the pandemic wore on, however, and more-contagious variants emerged, public support for Morrison’s handling of the pandemic declined sharply.\n\nIn the federal election of May 2022, Morrison’s main challenge was to come from Anthony Albanese. Albanese had become leader of the Labor Party in 2019. In many ways the election unfolded as a personality contest between Morrison and Albanese. Morrison’s forceful governing style had come to be seen by many Australians as inflexible. Albanese shifted his longtime left-leaning orientation toward the center. He also avoided expressing support for any controversial policies. Yet, as polling day approached, neither candidate enjoyed high approval ratings. The public appeared to be increasingly dissatisfied with the major parties. A groundswell of local activism produced a host of independent candidates, many of whom were women. They campaigned on several issues, including in support of gender equity, government accountability, and especially an aggressive response to climate change. This so-called “teal wave” of candidates posed a particular threat to Liberal membes of Parliament in suburban districts.\n\nWhen the votes were counted, Labor had displaced the Liberal-National coalition from power. Albanese became prime minister. Winning an absolute majority of the seats, the Labor Party was able to form a government without a coalition."
