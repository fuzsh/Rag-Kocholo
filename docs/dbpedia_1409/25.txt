Tasmania's in-form opener Ben McDermott hit his second one-day cup century in four innings to help his side to a hard-earned three-wicket win over South Australia on Thursday.

Tasmania batted judiciously over the course of their innings to pass South Australia's 7-236 with six balls remaining on a Bankstown Oval wicket that proved challenging for fast run-scoring.

The Tigers seemed to be on target for victory until a run of late wickets and dot balls saw a run-a-ball scenario in the latter stages.

McDermott batted throughout the innings and ended unbeaten on 102 in a mature 120-ball knock as SA reached 7-238.

With two centuries and a half-century already this season, the 23-year-old is now comfortably the leading run-scorer in the competition.

For the second match in succession opener Matthew Wade - who opened the season with a century - was out for a duck in the first over of the innings.

But McDermott and Jordan Silk put on 123 for the third wicket to take the match away from the Redbacks.

It took something special to break the pair's stranglehold and Kane Richardson delivered with a superb long-range throw from near the boundary to run out Silk for 71.

McDermott was dropped on the rope by Alex Ross when the opener was on 39 and it proved a costly miss.

South Australia bowled with accuracy but missed the wicket-taking ability of the absent Chadd Sayers.

Jake Weatherald was the mainstay of South Australia's innings, scoring 79 off 82 balls, including three sixes.

But South Australia struggled to build momentum for much of their innings, although Redbacks' skipper Jake Lehmann added some crucial late runs with an unbeaten 58 off 63 balls.

The win leaves Tasmania well placed in second with three wins from four outings, while South Australia are likely out of the running for a top-two finish after a third defeat in succession.
