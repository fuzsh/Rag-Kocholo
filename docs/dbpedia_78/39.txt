Östersunds skidstadion

Oestersund, Sweden’s fifth-largest city, sits on the shore of idyllic Lake Storsjoen, said to be the home of a legendary serpent-like monster. Situated on a hillside dominated by the shining Arctura Tower, the Swedish National Biathlon Arena traditionally hosts the opening weekend of the BMW IBU World Cup season. This modern compact stadium, and the Arctura, on the edge of the pine forest shine brilliantly over the city during evening competitions. Just 2 kilometres from the stadium is the quaint city centre, lined with small shops, restaurants and traditional Swedish bakeries perfect for a quick warm-up snack on a cold winter day.
