        "text": "Sir Bobby Robson, Terry Venables and Steve McClaren are three of a very select number of English coaches who were courageous enough to leave these shores and ply their trade in another country. They did so with varying success but the career of Graham Potter has added a new dimension to the achievements of English managers abroad.\n\nWe should all watch with keen interest Arsenal’s Europa League tie with Östersund, not necessarily to see how the Premier League team perform but how Potter – the manager in the opposition dugout who has based all of his success with his team on being outside their comfort zone – fares. Potter, who had a decent if not glittering playing career mainly in the lower reaches of our English leagues, has won three promotions in the last six years with his club, culminating in winning the Swedish Cup in 2016-17 and therefore qualifying for this season’s Europa League.\n\nPotter has a degree in social sciences and a master’s in leadership and emotional intelligence and took the brave step after coaching football at university level to accept his first role in management at a fourth-tier Swedish club with an average home attendance of 200 people in the middle of nowhere.\n\nNow look at them, playing European football against illustrious opponents in Arsenal, and they will travel to compete in front of 60,000 fans at the Emirates Stadium in the second leg. The transformation of the club is the stuff of miracles but, when you look deeper into their success, you see the turnaround was achieved through being different, having a clear, consistent footballing identity and concentrating on the overall human culture within Östersund.\n\nThe method has been built by a coach who knew from his studies that success on the football pitch is guided by people first and players second. Take, for example, the introduction of the Östersund “cultural academy” where it is compulsory for players, coaches and staff to collaborate and perform songs, dances and theatrical productions for the public every year.\n\nWhat has that got to do with football, many people would understandably ask, but the overarching coaching philosophy of Potter is that taking people out of their comfort zone is an effective way to promote personal growth, increase players’ abilities to work together with empathy for each other and elevate confidence and self-esteem in the individual, all huge qualities needed when performing on a football pitch in front of tens of thousands of people.\n\nThe human element in football is too easily overlooked but I know from my years of experience in the game that the more empathy and the stronger the bond between team-mates, the more chance you have of reaching your goals. Potter’s and Östersund’s achievements have been built on a culture of improvement, focusing on all of the processes and with a foundation based around long-term success instead of only the short-term result; it is a combination of values, identity, realism and sustainable growth, something increasingly difficult to find not only in the English Premier League but in every league in our football pyramid.\n\nWe all look at Sir Alex Ferguson – and rightly so – as the best ever manager within our game but it was the foundations and improvements he put in place not only at the very start of his tenure at Manchester United but at Aberdeen and St Mirren too. The introduction of improved grassroots development and scouting of young players, the change in professionalism and culture and his influence and diligence in building each club from the bottom up secured him support at Old Trafford when results were not going his way early on but bore fruit in the long-term when the Class of 92 burst on to the scene, creating unprecedented and consistent success for years to come.\n\nWe have discussed for years where the next Ferguson may come from and the fact that opportunities and time to implement cultural and footballing philosophies are becoming harder to attain because of short-term thinking and the pressure to share in the financial rewards on offer for success now and not later.\n\nSo the fact that Potter has taken the brave route to leave this country and his own personal comfort zone in order to build something to be proud of in an unknown part of Sweden is something to be celebrated and respected. He may be the trailblazer of many frustrated, innovative coaches who, with the door shut firmly in their face here because of a “lack of experience” at first-team level, will look abroad to follow their passion and perform their own miracles all over the world.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how his career progresses and whether in time an English club owner will be “brave” or “crazy” enough not only to employ a man who has proved successful with his ideas in Scandinavia but to give him the time and patience needed for consistent, long-term success. For our own game to improve and grow we need coaches whose first thoughts are the processes in improvement and growth, like Potter now and Ferguson decades before him."
