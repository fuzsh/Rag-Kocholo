        "text": "Malmo will entertain PAOK at Eleda Stadium in the first leg of the UEFA Champions League third qualifying round on Tuesday. The hosts last played in the group stage of the competition in the 2021-22 season while the visitors have not qualified for the group stage thus far.\n\nThe hosts booked their place in the third round with a 6-4 win on aggregate over KI. They won the first leg 4-1 at home and suffered a 3-2 loss in the second leg. Midfielder Hugo Bolin scored in both legs.\n\nThe visitors won their second qualifying round meeting against Borac Banja 4-2 on aggregate. Konstantinos Koulierakis bagged a brace in the first half and fellow defender William Troost-Ekong scored in the second half in their 3-1 win in the first leg.\n\nInterestingly, the hosts have suffered defeats in their last two games, including the loss in the second leg of the second qualifying round last week.\n\nMalmo vs PAOK Head-to-Head and Key Numbers\n\nThe two teams will meet for the first time in a competitive match.\n\nThe hosts have met a Greek team twice thus far, with both meetings coming against Olympiacos in the group stage of the 2014-15 Champions League. They registered a home win and suffered a loss in the away game.\n\nThe visitors have met a Swedish team twice, with the two meetings coming against Ostersund in the 2017-18 UEFA Europa League qualifying playoffs. They suffered a defeat on away goals in those meetings.\n\nMalmo have won two of their three home games in all competitions this season, conceding one goal in each game.\n\nPAOK have just one win in their last five away games in the Champions League qualifiers.\n\nThe visitors have seen conclusive results in their last seven games in the competition, with four wins and three losses.\n\nMalmo vs PAOK Prediction\n\nThe Blue Ones have suffered three defeats in their last five games in all competitions, with just one of these losses coming at home. They have just one win in their last five games in the Champions League qualifiers, suffering three losses.\n\nThe White-Blacks are unbeaten in their last three competitive away games, recording two consecutive wins, and will look to build on that form. They have just two wins in away games in the Champions League qualifiers.\n\nConsidering the current form of the two teams and record in Champions League qualifiers, a draw is likely to ensue.\n\nPrediction: Malmo 2-2 PAOK\n\nMalmo vs PAOK Betting Tips\n\nTip 1: Result - Draw\n\nTip 2: Goals - Over/Under 2.5 Goals - Over 2.5 goals\n\nTip 3: At least one goal to be scored in the second half - Yes\n\nTip 4: Kiril Despodov to score or assist any time - Yes"
