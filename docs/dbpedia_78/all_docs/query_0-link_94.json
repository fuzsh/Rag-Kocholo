        "text": "LEICESTER are close to appointing Graham Potter as their new manager.\n\nPotter, 49, has been out of work since being sacked by Chelsea in April last year.\n\nHe has already rejected a number of opportunities to return to the dug-out.\n\nHowever, the former Brighton and Swansea manager has held positive talks with the Leicester ownership.\n\nAnd now he is keen to return to management with the newly-promoted club.\n\nThe Foxes won the Championship last season but were left without a manager after Enzo Maresca joined Potter's former employers, Chelsea, earlier this month.\n\nLeicester held talks with ex-Nottingham Forest boss Steve Cooper as well as West Brom manager Carlos Corberan.\n\nBut now they have decided on Potter as their preferred choice.\n\nThe club are facing financial issues, however, and could still start the season with a points deduction after breaching profit and sustainability rules in recent years.\n\nAnd that would hand Potter a tough start to life in the Midlands.\n\nCASINO SPECIAL - BEST CASINO WELCOME OFFERS\n\nPotter recently held talks over taking the Ajax job, while Brighton considered offering him a return to The Amex to replace Roberto De Zerbi.\n\nThe Seagulls could be causing Potter problems in his new role too.\n\nBrighton have long standing interest in Leicester's Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall and are considering a move this summer having been knocked back in January.\n\nMeanwhile, Leicester’s transfer embargo has been lifted by the Premier League.\n\nThat is despite the club suing them after being charged with breaking FFP rules.\n\nThe £10million received in compensation from Chelsea for Maresca will be booked as pure profit for accounting purposes.\n\nThis will make it the equivalent of selling a £50m player when it comes to FFP calculations.\n\nLeicester are now confident that a fire sale of players will not be needed to avoid an FFP charge.\n\nMeanwhile, the promotion winners have discovered who they will face on their return to the Premier League as the 2024/25 season fixtures came out today.\n\nThe Foxes host Tottenham on Monday 19 August before travelling to Fulham the following Saturday."
