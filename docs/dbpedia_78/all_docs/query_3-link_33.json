        "text": "Developments under the first project included construction of 20 ski waxing cabins, permanent stands for 2 200 spectators and commentary booths; upgrading of track lighting and toilet facilities; adjustments to tracks and earthworks; and asphalting of the biathlon penalty loop.\n\nHatches over lane marker holes were replaced and ammunition collectors were installed at the shooting range. The snow-making system was modernised with the building of a pond for cooling water and a pipe linking it to the arena. This allows for hosting of early-season winter sports meetings and preseason training.\n\nMedia centre, drug-testing facilities\n\nThe second project entailed the construction of a media centre, which also contains drug-testing facilities. Both of these are required by many international sporting federations. Outside the winter sports season, the building can be rented out for activities such as conferences organised by local sports associations.\n\nFurther features of the project were rebuilding the shooting range; changes to the stadium layout to provide more flexibility for biathlon and cross-country skiing courses; levelling out of the surface of the arena; and construction of a tunnel to improve access for journalists, event organisers and competitors. Work related to connections to public utility infrastructure was also carried out.\n\nIn all, 65 people – 25 women and 40 men – were involved in the projects, which created two new jobs.\n\nThe first project ran from July 2008 to July 2011, the second one from January 2013 to September 2014.\n\nA venue for everyone\n\nÖstersund ski stadium was built over several phases, with no long-term plan regarding the type of events it was intended to stage. A key challenge for the two projects was thus to develop a venue that, on one hand, would meet the requirements for international competitions and, on the other, would be suitable for use by local residents and associations when no competitions were taking place. Östersund’s status as a well-established host of large events made it easier to discuss requirements for the upgrades with the relevant sporting bodies.\n\nThe arena’s location in a nature park presented an additional challenge given the development restrictions related to use of water for snow making, saving of snow from one winter to the next, and laying of an asphalt track for roller skiing.\n\nThanks to the two projects, the stadium has been transformed from a cross-country skiing-only venue into Sweden’s national biathlon arena. Moreover, it is regularly chosen to host global sporting contests such as the annual premiere of the Biathlon World Cup and meetings within the Cross-Country World Cup, as well as the 2019 World Biathlon Championships, the 2021 Special Olympics World Winter Games and para-sports competitions.\n\nThe projects have helped make it possible for Östersund’s Mid Sweden University to offer study opportunities to athletes and to set up the Swedish winter sports and sports tech research centres. Finally, the stadium’s commercial viability has been enhanced and it has joined with other nearby sports facilities to create a village for big events."
