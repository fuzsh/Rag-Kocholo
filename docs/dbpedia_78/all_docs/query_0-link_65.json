        "text": "Does it feel a bit like the FA Cup third round?\n\nIn some ways I know where you are coming from in terms of the small team against the big team, absolutely. For us in this type of game, as we have approached all the games in Europe, we have tried to play as well as we can, be ourselves in the game and use the opportunity to to show what we are about.\n\nNormally in the third round of the FA Cup you have not beaten Galatasary or PAOK or Hertha Berlin. But in terms of the size of the two teams, absolutely.\n\nWe are obviously all excited about the game and the visit of Arsenal, a Champions League club.”\n\nWhat have you prepared for?\n\nWe have prepared for us to be as good as we can be against whoever we play. Whoever we play will be a top team as far as we are concerned.\n\nWe finished our domestic season in the first of November and then we finished the Europa League in the first week of December, so we have come out of a phase that is a bit of a close season for us so we have had to concentrate on us, making sure everybody is at the right level to train and play, and to give everybody a chance to come to this moment in the best way possible for them.\n\nYou can spend a long time second guessing the opposition but things have changed for them. Whatever happens, we know that we are playing against a top team and we know that we have to play well. The environment, the external factors don’t really matter unless we play well ourselves.”\n\nConnection with the community?\n\nI think we are all aware of it. From my perspective it’s totally positive. I don’t see any burden at all. We are proud of what we have done and we are proud to have created a team that people are proud of.\n\nI think that is the most special thing with what we have achieved on this journey. Our responsibility then is to try to be ourselves in the games, as much as we can.\n\nWe want to be brave and we want to try and be ourselves on the pitch. We want to represent Ostersund and ourselves in as positive a way as we can.”\n\nHow’s the team looking?\n\nYou never fully know because we have had one competitive match since the start of December. All I can judge is how the players are day by day, and how they are in training and in terms of their application.\n\nWe had big game in the Swedish cup last week, two games while we were away. I am really happy with how preparations have gone.\n\nWhen I look back I think we have done quite well to get to this point. Still, it’s a completely different thing when you go and play Arsenal, who are looking to win the competition in terms of their path into the Champions League.\n\nWe recognise it is a big step up but that is our challenge when you come in the Europa League against the last 32. When you are from Scandinavia the season does not match up totally for this opportunity, but we will probably get some advantages maybe earlier in the competition.\n\nYou can’t complain, it is what it is and we will be ready come tomorrow night.”\n\nWill beating Arsenal be your biggest achievement?\n\nWell I’ve never got through to the last 16 of the Europa League so of course it will be the biggest. Because that is where we’re at, that’s the competition.\n\nEverything we’ve done, every stage we’ve got to is now is a new to us. That’s why I’m so proud of the players and so impressed by them because it’s not easy to do something that’s never been done before.\n\nWe’d never won a major trophy before, we won that. We were never in a Europa league qualification before, especially against a big team like Galatasaray and we coped with that really well.\n\nWe had never been in the Europa League before and we coped with that, so I have complete faith in the players in terms of their ability to deal with the challenge and the opportunity. But it goes without saying if we are successful it’s a huge moment for everybody connected with the club. Not just mine, but the players and the chairman I imagine.\n\nOn the conditions\n\nI’m not sure (how Arsenal will approach it). I think every club in Europe wants to try and use their home advantage as best they can. that’s normal.\n\nOur advantage is an 8,000 seater stadium in the north of Sweden. Their advantage will be a slightly bigger stadium in a slightly bigger city. But it doesn’t really matter, we have to play well. The cold or the pitch doesn’t win you a game, the players have to play well, we have to do the things that we are good at.\n\nThat’s the challenge for us.\n\nAre you disappointed it’s not colder?\n\nNo. I’m not disappointed at all. The thing you don’t want is it to be a farce the conditions.\n\nA couple of weeks ago it was minus 23, that was cold. And that wouldn’t be pleasant for anybody, those conditions don’t suit anyone.\n\nNow it’s quite pleasant. It’s like a spring morning for us. I think Arsenal will adapt, they are top players, top professionals. it’s not the conditions that are a factor, it’s how well we play.\n\nOn Arsene Wenger and the criticism he receives\n\nIt not for me to say how Arsenal fans should act.\n\nFrom a personal perspective, he’s done an incredible amount for British football. More so I think than anybody, he’s up there with anyone in terms of the influence he’s had.\n\nI remember playing in the 90s when we were just coming out of the European ban and it was a bit like the dark ages. He is part of the reason why English football has changed in terms of its approach, in terms of its professionalism.\n\nWhen you talk about on a human level, to be able to stay at the top, to deal with the scrutiny, the setback, the pressure, the defeats, the criticism and still operate at the highest level, I have the utmost respect for him. He’s an inspiration for me.\n\nOn injuries\n\nNo, everybody is okay, Johan is the only one who will miss from an injury-perspective he is still recovering from the knee problem he had but he is making really good progress. Everyone else is okay."
