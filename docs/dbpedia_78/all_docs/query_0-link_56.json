Merino to Arsenal imminent; Solanke to Spurs fee; Todibo medical; Zubimendi to Liverpool\n\nMeet the fitness influencer defying stereotypes about ageing\n\n15 February 2018\n\nSpeaking on BT Sport Wenger has been addressing the challenges of playing on the 'plastic' pitch Ostersund will have on show tonight:\n\nYou have to play more to feet, less long balls. The technical accuracy is more important. How well technically you play is important, we're used to that.\n\n\"There's no other way to play on a plastic pitch than to play.\"\n\nLuckily for Arsenal they have recent experience with 4G surfaces, an FA Cup fifth round tie with Sutton just about a year ago.\n\n15 February 2018\n\nThe Arsenal armband sure does get around:\n\n15 February 2018\n\nNot the most salubrious of away dressing rooms for the Gunners, who you might notice have made one numerical change. Mkhitaryan can't wear his actual No.7 because Alexis Sanchez wore that before Christmas.\n\nWenger has been complaining about the rule that forbids Arsenal from registering Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang for the competition but surely this is a bigger problem? Awful numbering.\n\n15 February 2018\n\nThere's a lot of excitement to see Maitland-Niles in his natural midfield role tonight after impressive stints as a left-back so far this season. Indeed part of Wenger's logic for allowing Francis Coquelin to join Valencia last month was to give that first-team spot to the U20 World Cup winner.\n\nHere's what he told Standard Sport after the draw with Chelsea at Stamford Bridge last month:\n\nHe’s a defensive midfielder basically, what he’s doing at the moment will help him as well to develop as a player because he plays in a different position.\n\n“But at some stage, I’ll play him in there... There will be an opening for him in midfield.”\n\n15 February 2018\n\nNo Mertesacker. No Koscielny. No Cazorla. No Cech. No Wilshere. No Ramsey. Tonight's captain then... is reserve goalkeeper David Ospina.\n\n15 February 2018\n\nTEAMS IN FULL\n\nOstersund XI: Keita; Mukiibi, Papagiannopoulous, Pettersson, Widgren; Edwards, Nouri, Mensah; Sema, Ghoddos, Gero\n\nSubs: Andersson, Tekie, Bergqvist, Hopcutt, Aiesh, Sunderberg, Islamovic\n\nArsenal XI: Ospina; Bellerin, Chambers, Mustafi, Monreal; Elneny, Maitland-Niles; Iwobi, Ozil, Mkhitaryan; Welbeck\n\nSubs: Macey, Holding, Kolasinac, Xhaka, Willock, Nelson, Nketiah\n\n15 February 2018\n\nArsene Wenger insists he is not the sort of man to break a contract amid speculation his Arsenal reign could come to an early end this summer, writes James Benge.\n\nWenger was handed a new two-year contract at the end of last season by majority shareholder Stan Kroenke after months of pressure over his future, with a rancorous atmosphere engulfing a club that appeared to lack a structure to cope without their manager of 21 years.\n\nChief executive Ivan Gazidis has moved to address that this season, hiring a new recruitment chief, head of football relations and experts in contracts and player fitness.\n\nWith Arsenal showing few signs of moving forward on the pitch speculation has mounted that Wenger could leave at the end of the season, with the manager himself confirming in October that his position would be reviewed at the end of the season.\n\nBut Wenger takes pride in never having broken a contract during his two-decades in north London and, in an interview on beIN Sports, hinted that that would not happen this summer.\n\n“I have always respected my contracts,” Wenger said. “I would like to remind you I said no to all the biggest clubs in the world to respect my contract so that’s always what I try to do.\n\n“After that we have as well to accept in our job that the future is the future but for me that’s to win the next game. We have to perform better in every single game and show until the end of the season a complete hunger to win every single game. That’s what it’s about for us.\n\n“The players who came in, have they the quality to give us something special? Yes. But it is about proving that on the field.”\n\nLast month brought an overhaul off the pitch comparable with that conducted by Gazidis of the corridors of power, with Wenger’s strikeforce undergoing significant renovation.\n\nFormer Borussia Dortmund team-mates Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Henrikh Mkhitaryan arrived as Alexis Sanchez, Theo Walcott and Olivier Giroud moved on, with Wenger convinced that his squad is stronger now than it had been on December 31.\n\n“That’s all to prove now,” he added. “I say yes but we lost a game at Spurs 1-0. What is in front of us is what we have to show until the end of the season.”\n\n15 February 2018\n\nArsene Wenger is frustrated that he will not be able to call upon club-record signing Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang in tonight's game against Ostersund.\n\nArsene Wenger has called on Uefa to abolish the rule that renders Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang ineligible for Arsenal in the Europa League this season.\n\nThe Gunners head into Thursday night’s last-32 tie here in Ostersund with Danny Welbeck as their only fit senior striker after Alexandre Lacazette joined Aubameyang on the sidelines with a knee injury.\n\nAubameyang moved to north London for a club-record £56million last month, but cannot play in Europe as his former club Borussia Dortmund are also in the first knockout round after dropping down from the Champions League.\n\nHenrikh Mihitaryan is set to make his Arsenal debut in the competition with Manchester United in the latter stages of the Champions League - something which means Alexis Sanchez, who moved the other way in that swap deal, can feature for Jose Mourinho’s side.\n\nAnd Wenger said: “Unanimously, I believe that all the clubs agree now this rule has to disappear in Europe - especially because for example he played Dortmund, Dortmund has been reversed in the Europa League and he cannot play.\n\n“When you look at the transfer amounts you spend now, that you have to spend £50m, £60m, £70m in the middle of the season, that the players cannot play doesn’t make sense. Unanimously everywhere in Europe now the clubs are against this rule.”\n\n12 February 2018\n\nTEAM NEWS\n\nArsene Wenger has vowed to play a full-strength side as Arsenal target a place in the Europa League last 16, writes James Olley.\n\nThe Gunners boss is refusing to give up on a top-four finish in the Premier League despite Saturday's 1-0 defeat to Tottenham, which leaves them in sixth place and seven point adrift of their north London rivals with 11 games to play.\n\nWenger has played a weakened team in Europe's second tier competition this term, but will abandon that policy in Sweden this week as Arsenal do not have a weekend game after being knocked out of the FA Cup at Nottingham Forest.\n\nInstead, they play the return leg at Emirates Stadium on Thursday week.\n\n\"I will play the normal team because it’s one of the opportunities we have, especially because we don’t play in the [FA Cup] this season,\" he said. \"There’s no reason why I should rest players.\"\n\nWenger must contend with one enforced change as club-record £56million record signing Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is ineligible due to the possibility of Arsenal still being able to face his former club Borussia Dortmund in the knockout rounds.\n\nThat means Alexandre Lacazette is likely to be handed his first start since Aubameyang's arrival; the 26-year-old wasted an excellent late chance as a substitute at Wembley and Wenger suggested Lacazette, who only joined the club from Lyon last summer, is suffering as a result of the increased competition for places.\n\n\"He’s a good goalscorer who has gone through difficult periods before,\" said Wenger.\n\n\"He works hard in training, he works on his finishing.\n\n\"I don’t know what happened [for that late chance], whether he didn’t touch the ball well, but it can happen in the fraction of a second.\n\n\"Maybe his confidence is not at the highest because he has seen a competitor coming in for him.\n\n\"Are people writing him off too soon? Yes, because he created two chances [against Tottenham], so that shows his quality as well.\n\n\"He will score goals. He’s a goalscorer who has scored goals throughout his whole career. He will score again.\"\n\n12 February 2018\n\nWelcome to Standard Sport's LIVE coverage of Ostersunds vs Arsenal.\n\nLatest updatesOlder updates\n\nMORE ABOUT"
