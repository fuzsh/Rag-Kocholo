        "text": "Arsenal fans have been told they can stay in \"camping cottages outside the town\" after it was revealed all Ostersund hotels are fully booked for February.\n\nThe Gunners will play FK Ostersund in the first leg of their Europa League last-32 clash in Sweden on February 15 before hosting them at the Emirates a week later.\n\nTickets for the first leg will not be released until mid-January, but already all hotels in Ostersund are fully booked.\n\nSome accommodation is believed to have been booked by English fans anticipating that they will get a ticket for the hotly-anticipated match.\n\nHowever, according to Elisabeth Richardsson, the Marketing Manager at Visit Ostersund, most hotel rooms have been booked by Swedish fans.\n\nDiscussing ways around the problem for Arsenal supporters travelling from the UK, Richardsson said: \"There are solutions. You may be able to stay in a camping cottage outside the town.\"\n\nRichardsson is also anticipating cancellations when fans who have put down deposits on places fail to secure themselves a ticket, meaning hotel rooms could be up for grabs closer to the date.\n\nAround 500 tickets will be made available to Arsenal supporters for the first leg tie, which will take place at the 8,466 capacity Jamtkraft Arena.\n\nDiscussing the issue, FK Ostersund chairman Daniel Kindberg told osdsport.se: \"We could have sold out Jamtkraft Arena five times, but now we cannot.\n\n\"We have chosen to play the match here on Europa League's smallest arena. But people do not have to worry, we will go a long way in the final game. There will be more matches after this\"."
