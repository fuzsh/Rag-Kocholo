That’s not the only thing today’s additions have to offer. Welcome to three new Swedish stadia!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJämtkraft Arena\n\nThe new stadium in northern Östersund was opened in July 2007 along with its side pitch. Two fully covered stands accommodate over 5,000 people. The larger one, to the east, also boasts a restaurant overlooking the pitch and all the sporting infrastructure needed.\n\nIn 2013 first expansion took place as Östersund were promoted to the Superettan (2nd tier). New wooden terrace was built to the east, managing to bring capacity to over 6,000.\n\nRosvalla Stadion\n\nLocated near the eastern bypass of Nyköping, the stadium is part of the Rosvalla sports and leisure centre. Its east stand holds 1,000 people under cover, while the grassy embankments around can fit up to 5,000 more people.\n\nJernvallen\n\nThe initial Jernvallen stadium was built before the WWII outbreak, in 1938. It was among Sweden’s host venues of the 1958 World Cup, but record crowds were reported already a year before the FIFA tournament, at local Sandviken IF game.\n\nThe current stadium dates back to 1993 and is a lot smaller than its predecessor. The covered stand holds 700 people, while almost three times more can easily fit onto the grassy slopes on remaining three sides. Record home crowd for the new stadium is 2,700."
