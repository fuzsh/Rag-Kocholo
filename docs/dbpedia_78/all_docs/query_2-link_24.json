        "text": "Best restaurants near Jamtkraft Arena?\n\nWith the arena being ideally located from the city centre, visitors to Ostersund can access the wealth of restaurants on offer. Jazzkoket offers local tastes with a South-American twist, Tre Rum is an atmospheric haunt – ideal before or after the match. Whilst Chaowpraya River offers amazing Thai cuisine for those looking to spice things up a little.\n\nHow do I get to the Jamtkraft Arena?\n\nThe Jamtkraft Arena is located on the northern edge of the town of Ostersund at just over 2 kilometres from the town centre. Ostersund's main railway station lies a kilometre further away just south of the town centre and the walk from the city hall to the ground takes about 30 minutes. On match days, a special service of line 14 runs to the stadium and buses depart from the bus station in Ostersund's centre at 60 minutes and 40 minutes before the start of the game.\n\nBest Insider tip at Jamtkraft Arena?\n\nTickets for Ostersunds tickets can be bought online or at the OFK club shop in Ostersund's city centre. Tickets can also be bought at the ticket booths of the Jamtkraft Arena from two hours before the start of the match.Expect to pay either SEK 260.00 or SEK 300.00 for a covered seat at one of the sides or SEK 150.00 for a ticket for the uncovered terraces behind the goal – be aware tickets can be hard to come by for big games so book early.\n\nBest Food and Drink at Jamtkraft Arena?\n\nHot Dogs are the food of choice for any Swedish football fan followed by Mazarin (cake filled with almond paste) – ideal fayre for footy. Ostersund's northerly location influences the choice of drink on offer with tea and coffee being very much the order of the day for the freezing fans but Spendrups can be acquired for any fans needing something stronger.\n\nSafety at Jamtkraft Arena?\n\n0\n\nJamtkraft Arena parking?\n\n0\n\nJamtkraft Arena seating?\n\nThe Jamtkraft Arena was built in 2007 to provide Ostersunds FK with a new home. The stadium initially consisted of three stands but in 2016 an extra terrace was erected when OFK got promoted to Sweden's top division, increasing the capacity to 8,500. Almost half of the stadium is standing only – which is something to consider when visiting – but all seats/standing places offer intimate views of the game.\n\nWhat to expect from the Jamtkraft Arena crowd?\n\nThe 8,500 seater stadium at the Jamtkraft Arena is purpose built to create as much atmosphere as possible. Ostersunds have gone from Swedish obscurity to the Europa League in the last 6 seasons and their fans are full of cheer as a result – meaning the atmosphere at the Jamtkraft can often belie the minimal attendance numbers.\n\nBest Bars near Jamtkraft Arena?\n\nThe Jamtkraft Arena is located on an office park on the edge of the city and Ostersund's ice hockey arena and ski stadium are on the same site. The nearby Arctura tower has a skybar and restaurant with some gorgeous views of the city but most drinking is done in the town centre of Ostersund with Jane Doe Bar, The Bishops Arms and Allstar all being popular drinking haunts for fans.\n\nThings to check out around Jamtkraft Arena?\n\nOstersund is quite a prominent city in Sweden and offers plenty for visitors. Frosotornet offers some amazing views over the Storsjön Lake which is frozen over for many months of the year. Jamtli is a popular museum that gives visitors an interactive journey through Swedish heritage and find out about the Ostersund region."
