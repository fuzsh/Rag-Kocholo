Editors’ Preface dis purpose of this volume, the publication of which is a part of the New Sweden Tercentenary celebration, is to recall by summaries and representative examples the roles played by Swedes as American pioneers and citizens. It is a review of deeds and influences in many fields of endeavor, the value of which we shall leave to the judgment of the reader. Some of the material has long been known in a general way, but it has been widely scattered and often of an indiscriminate character. In the following pages the alert student will discover, we trust, many new and interesting details. Obviously, SwEDEs in America makes no claim to completeness—not every deserv- ing name could even be mentioned. Our collection of articles, though written by the best authorities available, constitutes only a beginning which we hope will prove an incentive to fur- ther research and evaluation. Under the limiting circumstances of time and space, the lit- erary and historical modus operandi has been one of selection and condensation, each author being generally responsible for the contents of his own chapter. For the final form of the book as a whole, however, the Editors alone are accountable. Since each article is intended to be a unit by itself, and since several people have merited recognition in two or more fields of activity, some names will appear in more than one chapter; but an at- tempt has been made to reduce unavoidable duplications to a minimum. Painstaking efforts have been made, also, to check all important facts and to bring these up to date, but in a compilation of this kind mistakes are bound to creep in. We hope they are few and minor ones. At all events, the Editors will welcome corrections and notices of serious omissions, for, if the work meets with sufficient encouragement, it will be followed immediately by a revised edition and, in the not too distant future, perhaps by an enlarged one. The Swedish American Tercentenary Association hereby wishes to express its appreciation to the contributors and edi- tors of this book and’ to Mrs. Hannah Nicholson Benson of New Haven, Connecticut, for compiling the index.

In this capacity he has done pioneering work for a better appreciation of Northern culture in the United States and for more friendly inter- national relations. He lives in New York and is Editor of the Forum. IS Royal Highness Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf of Sweden will be very welcome when he returns to New Sweden this Tercentenary year. He is a worthy succes- sor to Gustavus Adolphus the Great, who conceived the dream of a Swedish colony in the New World. The earlier monarch was a leader of Europe in the arts of war; his namesake is a leader in the still more difficult strategy of peace. Now, for more than a century, Sweden has kept the peace and demonstrated her right to be called one of the most civilized of modern na- tions. The Crown Prince is a distinguished spokesman for a race that three hundred years ago, and again more recently, has vitalized the blood stream of America and given us many of our most impressive symbols of progress. The earliest contribution of the Swedes to America was the log cabin. The Swedes came from a land of great forests to an- other land of vast woodlands. In New Sweden, on the banks of the Delaware in 1638, they rejected the wigwams of the Indians and erected, instead, by applying their inborn engineering skill, strong dwellings made out of roughhewn timber. From New Sweden the log cabin design spread wherever American colo- nists moved into virgin country. Ever since 1638 the Swedes have continued to make signal contributions to the New World in research and in the applied sciences, in construction, engineering, and mechanical wonders. The Monitor which, more than any other single “miracle” ex- cept Gettysburg, helped to preserve the Union is, of course, the 2 Swedes in America outstanding symbol of Swedish mechanical genius in America. But today no great bridge is planned, no important dam con- structed, no skyscraper erected, no aeroplane factory completed in the United States without somewhere in the process the em- ployment of Swedish brains. Today Swedish inventions radiate from our lighthouses and highway beacons. Swedish separators prepare the cream for our butter. Swedish “controlled heat” stoves cook our food. Silent Swedish chemical refrigerators cool our drinks. Swedish ball bearings reduce the friction of our modern living. Swedish inventions add not only to the efficiency but also to the beauty of our mechanical life. Did anyone ever see a Swed- - ish separator or highway beacon that did not look graceful and streamlined? This is the characteristic of the Swedish mind that makes Sweden one of the most intelligent of modern nations: the equilibrium between the esthetic and the mechanical, be- tween the ideal and the real, between happiness and achieve- ment. Mens sana im corpore sano—with a flower in the working- man’s buttonhole! | | Of all words in the Swedish dictionary, the one that appeals most to Americans is levnadslust—“joy of life.” This word, made famous by the Swedish poet Tegnér, expresses to us Americans the poise, the joyousness, the smiling intelligence, the rhythm of Swedish personality and living. A person of English descent, meeting a group of typical Swedes, is impressed with four characteristics: their love of physical culture, their appreciation of art, their facility in sci- ence, their codperative instinct. In the home country practically every Swede is proficient in some form of athletics, and it was Swedish gymnastics which first made us Americans conscious nationally of the culture of the human body. What William Penn said of the Swedes whom he found on the Delaware is true of our Swedish population today. “They have fine children and almost every house full; rare to find one of them without three or four boys and as many girls; some six, seven and eight sons. And I must do them right—I see few young men more sober and laborious.” Penn took over the Swedish courts and system of law which he found planted on the Delaware. A century later it was a Introduction 8 Pennsylvanian of Swedish descent, John Morton, it is reputed, who cast the deciding vote in his own delegation for the Dec- laration of Independence; and another Swede, John Hanson of Maryland, presided over Congress for one year after the Revo- lution. This tradition of statesmanship has been followed by the leaders of our more recent Swedish immigration. The roll of Swedish governors of our states, of Swedes in the Senate and Congress, is impressive. In politics the American of Swedish descent is likely to be a conservative. In Sweden the typical Conservative is not a re- actionary, but one who feels a high responsibility for the coun- try and is ready to legislate, if it be proved good, any reform, no matter how radical its source. Like the American, the Swede is an individualist; but he has a high appreciation of economic and social balance, and for this reason labor unions are a mat- ter of course in Sweden, and the consumers’ codperatives pros- per. Some of their codperative principles have been transplanted satisfactorily in American farm districts where Swedes have settled. Swedish-Americans have distinguished themselves in science and in the learned professions, and our universities appreciate the contemporary progress of science in Sweden, as evidenced by the honorary degrees bestowed on Swedes at the recent Ter- centenary of Harvard University. Two hundred of our institu- tions of learning, this year of the Tercentenary of New Swe- den, are inviting some of the leading scientists of Sweden to lecture here. The first of these lecturers was Nobelprizeman The Svedberg, inventor of the ultracentrifuge, who distinguished the dedication of the new Chemistry Building of the University of Delaware. Among these lecturers are architects, economists, and physicians. A close relation exists today between the great surgeons and medical scientists of Sweden and America. In the arts, the contribution of Sweden to modern literature has been reflected, not only by the circulation of translations of Swedish authors, but by American authors of Swedish ancestry emerging from Swedish-American farms and industrial centers. Some of our leading American painters are proud of their Swed- ish ancestry. Swedish song has enriched the esthetic life of our nation. Choral societies of Swedish-Americans are welcome 4, Swedes in America everywhere. Visiting prima donnas from Sweden contribute fully as much as Italians to raise American opera to its present high level of quality as well as popularity. The magnificent debt of the United States to the Swedes is reviewed in detail by the eminent writers who have contributed in this book to a symposium on the Swedes in the United States. May the New Sweden Tercentenary turn the attention of America in the future, even more than in the past, to the suc- cess of the experiments of that smaller friendly country in northern Europe which, in its imaginative realism, is solving so many matters essential to progress and to civilization, that can be translated for use in our larger, but more inchoate na- tion. Colonists AMANDUS JOHNSON Dr. Johnson, born in Sweden, was educated at Gustavus Adolphus Col- lege, the University of Colorado, and the University of Pennsylvania, where he received the Ph.D. degree in 1908. He also holds honorary doctorates from his Alma Mater, Gustavus Adolphus College, from Augustana College, and the University of Gothenburg. For a number of years he taught Scandinavian languages at the University of Penn- sylvania; for two years was director of an educational expedition to Africa; and, since his return, has devoted his time to the study of the Swedes in America. He is now President of the American Swedish His- torical Foundation, Philadelphia. His work, The Swedish Settlements on the Delaware, in two volumes, is the authoritative publication on the subject, while The Swedes on the Delaware, 1688-1664 is a more popular version in one volume. He is also the author of Instruction for Johan Printz and has translated and edited Peter Lindestrém’s Geo- graphia Americe and The Journal and Biography of Nicholas Collin. Besides writing other books, he has contributed numerous articles and reviews to various newspapers and journals. N the early seventeenth century Holland established far- [ies settlements in North and South America, and soon England founded colonies on the James River and at other places on the North American coast. Denmark likewise aspired to a share in the colonial enterprise, and sent an expedition to the Hudson Bay district in 1619, but nothing came of it. Some- what later Sweden decided to join in the movement that was now becoming general. The first impetus toward Swedish transatlantic trade and colonization came from Holland. Willem Usselinx, the great Dutch promoter of the seventeenth century, persuaded Gus- tavus Adolphus to found, in 1626, a commercial company called the South Sea Company, for trade and colonization in Asia and America. Shares in the corporation were bought by the King and the nobility, and even by the people at large. Many of the cities in the Kingdom also subscribed relatively large sums; an American trading company was considered a sure road to wealth. Capital was scarce in Sweden at this time, however, and the 6 Swedes in America sums gathered from all sources were insufficient for the great plans conceived by Usselinx. In 1634-35, Samuel Blommaert, a Dutchman in Swedish service, proposed a new scheme for a Swedish colony in the Dela- ware region of North America. He knew a man well acquainted with these parts, Peter Minuit, for some years Governor of New Amsterdam. Minuit was now without employment, having been dismissed by his Dutch employers, and he was looking for a new sponsor. Through Blommaert he was introduced to the Swedish Chancellor, Axel Oxenstierna, and after considerable discussion a practical plan was evolved. A company was to be formed of Swedish and Dutch stockholders. Two ships were to be sent to the Delaware region, where land should be bought from the Indians. The colony should be called New Sweden. Forts were to be erected and trade carried on with the Delaware Indians, largely in beaver skins. Large cargoes were purchased in Holland and sent to Goth- enburg where two ships, the Kalmar Nyckel (“Key of Kal- mar’) and the Fogel Grip (“Bird Griffon”), were prepared for the journey. The Kalmar Nyckel, furnished by the old South Sea Company, corresponded somewhat to the auxiliary cruiser of our day. The Griffon was supplied by the Govern- ment. It was a fast-sailing warship, corresponding somewhat to a light cruiser of today. The two ships, with Peter Minuit as director of the expedi- — tion, left the harbor of Gothenburg about November 20, 1637. Encountering terrible storms in the North Sea, they were obliged to put in at Texel in Holland for repairs and more supplies. Contrary winds delayed their departure from there, but at last, on December 31, the two little vessels left the shores of Europe on their historic voyage across the Atlantic. Almost three months more elapsed before they reached Delaware Bay, and, sailing up the Delaware River to the mouth of the Chris- tina River on the left and up the latter stream for a distance of about two miles, they finally cast anchor before a ledge of rocks at the site of present Wilmington, Delaware, about March 25, 1638. Presently Peter Minuit explored the land for some miles along the Christina River—then called Minquas Kill—to estab- lish the fact that no white people were then in possession. Colonists 7 In the meantime Indian chiefs with their retainers appeared at the “Rocks,” and on the twenty-ninth of March (N.S. April 8) five sachems, Mattahorn, Mitatsimint, Erupacken, Ma- homen, and Chiton, entered the cabin of the Kalmar Nyckel and sold as much “of the land in all parts and places of the river, up the river and on both sides, as Minuit desired.” The deeds, drawn up and explained to the Indians, recited that for “‘value received in merchandise the Indians ceded and transferred the title of the land with its jurisdictions and rights to the Swedish Florida Company under the protection of the Great Princess, Virgin and Elected Queen of the Swedes, Goths and Wends.” The Indians traced their sprawling totem marks on the docu- ments; Peter Minuit, Mans Kling, Hendrick Huygen, Andreas Lucassen, and Jacob Evertssen Sandelin signed their names be- low, and thus the western shore of the Delaware River from Bombay Hook to the Schuylkill River, extending westward in- definitely as far “as Minuit desired,” became the legal posses- sion of the Swedish Crown. The Swedish coat of arms was erected on a pole “and with the report of cannon, followed by other solemn ceremonies, the land was called New Sweden.” The river was called Christina in honor of the young Queen, and the fort, which was erected back of the rocks about thirty or forty feet from the water’s edge, was also called Christina. Some dwellings were built within the fort as a shelter for the garrison. Small tracts in the neighborhood were planted with vegetables, and patches were sown with rye and barley and per- haps with some wheat and other grain, for “two barrels of wheat and two barrels of seed corn” were brought over on the ships. T'wenty-one men were stationed in the fort as a garrison, under the command of Mans Nilsson Kling. Hendrick Huygen was put in charge of the storehouse, and William Laury was provost marshal. About the middle of June, Minuit left the colony in charge of Kling—who thus became the first acting Governor of New Sweden—and departed on the Kalmar Nyckel. The ship put into Vlie in Holland for repairs in October, but without Minuit, who had been drowned during a storm in the West Indies while visiting the captain of a Dutch vessel at the island of St. Chris- topher. 8 Swedes in America In May of 1638 the Griffon left New Sweden in search of Spanish treasure ships, but practically nothing is known about this expedition. In the early part of 1639 the vessel returned to Fort Christina, and near the end of April set sail for Sweden with a cargo of skins, arriving at Gothenburg about the begin- ning of June, a record journey for those early days. The first expedition was a financial failure. The total value of the cargoes—pelts and tobacco—was 23,849 florins, while the expenses amounted to more than 46,000 florins. In the spring of 1638, Klas Fleming, an admiral in the Swedish Navy who had become enthusiastic about the colonial venture, proposed that several ships should be prepared for a new voyage. When, therefore, the reports, the Indian deeds to the land, and other papers arrived on the Kalmar Nyckel, Flem- ing’s enthusiasm was increased, and preparations for a second ~ expedition to the Delaware were begun in earnest. The trusty Kalmar Nyckel was again fitted out. Fleming and the other Swedish stockholders apparently decided that the colony should be not only a trading post, as the Dutch stockholders had con- ceived it, but an agricultural establishment as well. Accord- ingly, laborers, colonists, horses, cattle, fodder and provisions, farming implements, ammunition, as well as supplies for the Indian trade, were taken on board. Peter Hollender Ridder went on the ship as the second governor of the colony. The Reverend Reorus Torkillus was appointed pastor in New Swe- den, and Gregorius van Dyck, a Dutchman, but a faithful ser- vant of the Swedish Crown, was sent out as assistant commis- sary. | On its second voyage to New Sweden, the Kalmar Nyckel left Gothenburg in the beginning of September, 1639, but on the way encountered all manner of difficulties—crew trouble, storms, and prolonged repairs—so that the people and cattle suffered severely, and the vessel did not arrive at Fort Christina until April 17, 1640. Governor Ridder now took charge of the colony. The keys of the storehouse were delivered to Joost von Langdonk. Gregorius van Dyck became assistant commissary, and Géran Olsson was made provost marshal, while Per Anderson was guard and skip- per on the yacht. The Kalmar Nyckel set sail for Europe about Colonists 9 the middle of May. Mans Kling and Hendrick Huygen returned to Sweden on the vessel. The financial losses of the second expedition were even greater than those of the first, and the Dutch shareholders were thor- oughly dissatisfied. The Government at Stockholm therefore “found it expedient to release the Dutch participants in the New Indian or Florida Company, as they are a hinderance . .” and in February, 1641, 18,000 riksdalers were paid for their shares. From now on the New Sweden Company was op- erated entirely by Swedish money. The Company was reorgan- ized and several new officers were appointed. At this time a plan was on foot to establish a group of Dutch settlers in New Sweden. A ship was chartered for the purpose, _ and in the autumn of 1640 the emigrants, fifty in number, es- tablished themselves a few miles above Fort Christina. The colony, however, soon disappeared, and we do not know what became of it. A fourth expedition of two ships, the faithful Kalmar Nyckel and a new vessel, the Charitas, was prepared in the spring and summer of 1641. The Kalmar Nyckel carried most of the set- tlers, who now consisted of Swedes and a few Finns from the northern part of the Kingdom. Horses, goats, cattle, sheep, and farming implements, as well as seed corn of every kind, were loaded onto the Charitas. 'The two vessels sailed in July. The voyage was unusually stormy. Some cattle and two passengers died on the journey, and when the ships finally cast anchor at Fort Christina on November 7, 1641, “the . . . people were very weak and powerless.” A new clergyman, Pastor Christopher, came on this expedi- tion. Mans Kling returned as commander of the fort, and a tailor, a millwright, a blacksmith, and other skilled laborers, as well as some freemen or colonists, arrived on the vessel. Five horses, eight cows, five sheep, and two goats were landed alive, but two horses and one cow died soon after they had been brought ashore. New Sweden was now firmly established as a colony. The ships departed from New Sweden about the end of No- vember, carrying a detailed report from Governor Ridder and one or two returning soldiers, but no cargo. Before the ships 10 Swedes in America reached Sweden, Admiral Fleming had begun preparations on a large scale for a new expedition—three ships were to be sent. The arrival of Ridder’s report at Stockholm in the late spring or early summer of 1642 stimulated the preparations, and it was decided to dispatch the vessels at the earliest possible mo- ment, even though supplies for the Indian trade could not be procured. : It was resolved to establish Swedish authority on the Dela- ware even more firmly. A new governor was to be appointed and the civil as well as military authority was to be placed on a stable and more businesslike basis. Lieutenant Colonel Johan Printz, who had gained success in the Thirty Years’ War, but who for some time had been in retirement, was appointed gov- ernor. Printz had had a varied career. In his youth he studied theology, expecting to follow in the footsteps of his paternal ancestors, who had been pastors in the Swedish church for gen- erations. However, circumstances made him a soldier of fortune and he served under many masters, In many armies, and in many countries before he entered the Swedish ranks. Printz, as stated above, was recalled from his retirement and appointed Governor of New Sweden at a salary of 800 riks- dalers a year. A famous “Instruction,” which has been called the “First Constitution or Fundamental Law of Delaware and Pennsylvania,” was issued to him. The “Instruction,” dated August 15, 1642, contained twenty-eight articles regulating the religious, civic, legal, military, commercial, agricultural, and manufacturing activities of the settlement, and defining the powers of the governor and his relation to the natives and the neighboring colonies. | As in the case of previous expeditions, emphasis was placed on the development of the colony and the settlement of the country. No cargo was purchased for the Indian trade. Great efforts were made to obtain settlers. Soldiers were engaged to persuade people to migrate, and governors of the northern prov- ices were instructed to prevail upon their subjects to go to America, those of good standing to take their families with them. But persuasive methods failed to arouse enthusiasm for a journey to the New World. Even in those days news traveled fast, especially bad news, and the voyages to New Sweden were Colonists 11 in bad repute. The Council of State decided that soldiers guilty of desertion and poachers should be sent to the colony for some years as a punishment, but even these measures proved inade- quate. It was then resolved that Finns, who had settled in the northern and central provinces of Sweden and were reputed to have destroyed valuable forests, should be sent to the Delaware with their families. It was also ordered that citizens unable to pay their debts, but suitable as colonists or workers, should be taken to the Delaware. At no time, however, were criminals who had committed grave offenses deported to New Sweden. A mining expert was engaged to look for minerals, and skilled laborers and workmen were hired to serve on the plantations and in the forts. Additional soldiers and officers were enlisted for garrison duty, and two new pastors, the Reverend Johan Campanius and the Reverend Israel Fluviander, accompanied the expedition. The Company was reorganized in August, 1642, and “the Royal Government and their respective participants resolved to furnish a capital stock of 36,000 riksdalers in the New Swe- den Company,” the various entries being made in the Journal of the Corporation on August 28, 1642. The preparations dragged on throughout the summer, and not until the end of October were the ships ready to depart. On the first of November, 1642, the Swan and the Fama, the two ships selected for the expedition, left Gothenburg harbor, and by the end of January, 1643, arrived in Delaware Bay. As they were about to enter the river, a terrible storm broke. The Fama tore away from her three anchors and was cast ashore with heavy damage, losing her mainmast and spritsail. The anchors of the Swan held, but the ship suffered heavily and part of her cargo was ruined. The Fama was refloated with the rising tide and temporary repairs were made. On February 15, the ships arrived before the Rocks at Fort Christina. The ships left the colony about the middle of April, 1643, with large cargoes of pelts. Peter Ridder, Johan Papegoja, and some soldiers and workmen departed on the vessels, which reached Gothenburg about the end of July. Johan Papegoja, and perhaps Ridder and the others, went overland to Stock- holm, bringing letters and the first report of Governor Printz 12 S'wedes in America from New Sweden. The documents arrived in the Swedish capi- tal on August 1, the ships with their cargoes making their ap- pearance some weeks later. Even before the ships reached Stockholm, preparations had begun for another expedition. Two ships were fitted out, and this time trade with the aborigines and commerce in the West Indies were to be the main purposes of the voyage. Large sup- plies of merchandise were procured in Holland and in Sweden. Colonists, however, were not forgotten. In the autumn Pape- goja enlisted some soldiers and, as emigrants did not appear voluntarily, the Government decreed that timber thieves and game poachers should be sent to New Sweden. Two or three colonists came from Finland, and two noblemen, Knut and Per Lilliehoék, were among the passengers. Johan Papegoja also made arrangements to return to his new home. The Fama, which had just returned from the fifth of the Company’s expeditions, and the Kalmar Nyckel were selected for the voyage. The Kalmar Nyckel made a trading voyage to the Caribbean Islands, and only the Fama went to Fort Chris- tina on the Delaware, arriving there on March 11, 1644. In her cargo were, among other supplies, the following: three large saws for a sawmill; eight grindstones; one pair of stones for a hand mill; one pair of large millstones for a gristmill; five anchors; five pumps with necessary repairs and a hide of pump leather; twelve small and eight large augers; four compasses; thirty-six blocks; two hundred and fifty copper kettles; sev- eral barrels of lime and pitch; a few thousand bricks; two hun- dred barrels of flour; twenty barrels of “Spanish salt;” ten hogsheads of French wine; one hogshead of brandy; several hundred yards of cloth; ten gilded flagpole knobs; three hun- dred pairs of shoes; and two hundred pairs of stockings. About June 20, 1644, the Fama set her course for Europe with a large cargo of skins and tobacco. She and the Kalmar Nyckel (the latter returning from the Caribbean Islands), hav- ing put into Harlingen on their homeward journey, were seized by order of the Dutch West India Company, but were finally released through the efforts of Peter Spiring, the Swedish Am- bassador to Holland. The Fama brought an earnest request from Printz and Pa- Colonists 13 pegoja for more colonists and more supplies. But Admiral Klas Fleming, the driving force in the New Sweden Company, was at this time engaged in a task of far more importance to Sweden than the fortunes of the little settlements along the Delaware. A war with Denmark was in progress and Admiral Fleming pressed every ship into service. The Swan and the Charitas, which had made journeys to New Sweden, fought in the battle of Femern, and when the Kalmar Nyckel and the Fama arrived at Gothenburg, they were refitted and added to the fleet. The war not only prevented the dispatching of aid to Governor Printz at this time, but inflicted an irreparable loss on the Company and the colony. In July, 1644, Fleming was killed by a stray bullet from a Danish battery. Axel Oxen- stierna, the Swedish Chancellor, became the head of the New Sweden Company, but since he was deeply engrossed in peace negotiations with Denmark, he did not find time even to peruse the letters and reports which Governor Printz dispatched to Sweden. Eventually the documents were sent to Hans Kramer and Johan Beier, officers of the Company, who made every ef- fort possible to comply with the requests of Printz; but nothing was, nor could be, accomplished, since final decisions in the mat- ter had to be made by the Government. On August 13, 1645, the Danish war came to an end, and now ships could be spared for commercial voyages. A new ex- pedition on a large scale was to be sent as soon as ships could be prepared. Four hundred women, four hundred men (half of them soldiers), and two hundred children were to be dispatched to Governor Printz. So large a project, however, could not be realized. It was found that but two vessels could be sent. A new ship, the Golden Shark, fully rigged, was purchased in Holland for the journey, and the official documents state that the Fama was to sail also. For some unknown reason, however, the Golden Shark sailed alone in May, 1646. She had a perilous and stormy voyage and did not reach Fort Christina until October 1, lacking most of her sails and her topmast. “The master of the ship, the mate and all the crew, except one man, were ill, so that according to their reports, they would all have perished, if they had not reached land when they did.” The sailors recovered but slowly, 14 Swedes in America and the repairs on the ship were not completed until December. As the winter was hard, the river froze over and the ship could not begin its homeward journey until March. She arrived safely at Gothenburg in June, 164'7, with a cargo of tobacco, and reached Stockholm in the autumn. In the meantime a new expedition was prepared. Provisions for the needs of New Sweden and merchandise for the Indian trade were loaded into the holds of the Swan, a veteran in the colonial service, and in September she was ready to sail. Johan Papegoja, the great traveler to and from New Sweden, en- deavored to obtain passengers. He was but moderately success- ful and few colonists came to the Delaware on the vessel. This was probably the most successful and most fortunate expedition to New Sweden during the existence of the colony. The Swan left Gothenburg harbor on September 25, 1647, and arrived at Fort Christina in the late autumn without casualties and with- out mishap, an unusual experience for a ship in those days. On May 16, 1648, the Swan spread her white sails for the return voyage. She was a lucky ship, as mariners would say. On the nineteenth she rounded Cape Henlopen for the open sea and on the thirteenth of June she was off Plymouth, having crossed the Atlantic in twenty-five days! On June 17 the ship was ap- proaching the Scandinavian shores and, without touching at Gothenburg, proceeded directly to Stockholm, where she ar- rived on July 3. The Reverend Johan Campanius, Mans Nils- son Kling, and other officers and men were passengers on the vessel. Preparations for a new expedition were on foot at the Swed- ish capital before the Swan returned, but these made little progress, and not until the following summer was a ship, the Cat (Kattan), ready to sail. By now, rumors of fabulous op- portunities for colonists in New Sweden were abroad in old Sweden, circulated by letters and reports, and after 1648 emi- grants in abundance were willing to brave the dangers of the long voyage to the Delaware; but soldiers and officers still had “a great dread of New Sweden” and looked upon it almost as a penal colony. It was, therefore, necessary to draft some sol- — diers needed for service in the forts along the river. Hundreds of prospective colonists apparently applied for Colonists 15 passage on the ship. About seventy of these were selected, in- cluding many women and some children—not counted, however. Joachim Lycke and Hans Amundsson were sent as aides to Governor Printz. In accordance with the request of Printz, cannon and a large quantity of ammunition were loaded on the ship and provisions for twelve months were taken on board. After long delays the Cat finally got under sail on Monday, July 3, 1649. But it was the ship’s fate never to reach her des- tination. Wrecked on a reef near the island of Puerto Rico in the West Indies, over one hundred of the passengers and crew succumbed from subsequent exposures and ill treatment by Spaniards and Frenchmen on Puerto Rico and the neighboring island of Santa Cruz. Only nineteen of the passengers and a few soldiers and sailors, including the clergyman, Matthias Ner- tunius, the barber-surgeon, Timon Stidden, and Johan Rud- berus, who wrote an interesting journal of the voyage, made their way back to their native land. The cargo and provisions of the Cat were confiscated by the Spaniards and the vessel was ordered burned by the Spanish Governor of Puerto Rico. The shipwreck was an irreparable blow to Printz and his colony. It was one of the links in a chain of misfortunes which finally overwhelmed the colony and forever put an end to Swed- ish power on the Delaware. Had the cannon and other munitions of war, as well as the soldiers and colonists, reached New Swe- den, it is quite likely that the Dutch would have sat quietly on the Hudson in 1651 and later, and left New Sweden alone for years to come. | As soon as the officers of the Company in Stockholm heard of the shipwreck, they decided to send aid to the colony from Hol- land, and money was assigned to Peter Spiring, Swedish diplo- matic agent at The Hague, for the purchase of a cargo. But the activity of the Company was hampered by the inactivity of the Government, and the resolutions and orders of the Council of State, necessary as a stamp of approval of anything the offi- cers of the Company decided, were not forthcoming. Preparations were also begun for a new expedition from Swe- den. The Golden Shark, which had been riding at anchor for months and months, was repainted and generally repaired, but for some unknown reason the activities subsided. The officers of 16 Swedes in America the Company, who realized the condition in the colony, must have been desperate, but they lacked authority to do anything. Oxenstierna was old, and Queen Christina was more interested at this time in pageants, court festivals, and philosophical dis- cussions than in matters of State and colonial affairs. In the autumn of 1651, however, the Government seemed to bestir itself about its colony on the South River. On March 16 the following year (1652), the Queen was actually present in the Council Chamber to discuss the requirements of New Swe- den. It seems that the reports of Governor Printz about the in- vasion of the colony by the Dutch, the “outrages”’ of Governor Stuyvesant, and his disrespect of Her Royal Majesty’s au- thority finally awakened the Swedish Government to a realiza- tion of its obligation to its forsaken settlement on the Delaware. A second meeting was held on March 18. Again the Queen was present. It appears that some member of the Council advised that a sufficient force be dispatched to New Sweden to drive the Dutch from the river, but “Her Majesty’s idea was that the States General [of Holland] should be approached for a settle- ment.” A few days later the Queen ordered the Admiralty to make the Swan ready for ‘‘a new journey to the West Indies.” It was found, however, that the ship was unseaworthy, and the Com- pany made new repairs on its own vessel, the Golden Shark. But the summer and fall of 1652 came and went and nothing was done. The winter of 1652-53 and the summer of 1653 fol- lowed, and still nothing was done. Queen Christina had impor- tant personal matters to consider at this time—she was plan- ning her abdication. In the late summer of 1653, new ethers from Printz were re- ceived by Per Brahe and Axel Oxenstierna. New life was put into the preparations. The Commercial College, or Board of Trade, which had previously been instructed to manage the af- fairs of the New Sweden Company, was ordered by Queen Chris- tina to take charge of the situation. This was fortunate for the colony. Eric Oxenstierna, son of the great Chancellor, was Chairman of the College, and he possessed much of his father’s ability. Intensely interested in the colonial enterprise, he as- sumed the direction of the preparations in 1653, and they im- Colonists 17 mediately began to take definite shape. As the Government was in arrears to the Company for several thousand riksdalers, the Queen ordered the Admiralty “‘to fit out a ship for a voyage to New Sweden.” Three hundred colonists and a large cargo, in- cluding munitions of war, were to be sent to the South River “in order that New Sweden should not go to ruin.” The Orn (‘Eagle’), a Government vessel, was selected for the journey, and Jan Bockhorn, first mate on the shipwrecked Cat, was made captain of the ship. Great efforts were made to enlist soldiers and to find colonists and skilled workmen. The soldiers and passengers from central Sweden—many came from Vasteris—boarded the ship at Stockholm. The Orn left the capital on October 8, 1653. She had a rough journey from Stockholm to Gothenburg, ran on banks in the Sound “through the negligence of the sailors,” and encountered other misfor- tunes, but after a month of sailing arrived safely at Gothen- burg. Admiral Anckerhielm, who was in charge of the prep- arations at Gothenburg, built cabins for the passengers and made other arrangements for their comfort. New supplies were also loaded on the ship. The various requests of Printz were now to be granted. Johan Rising, the Secretary of the newly established Commercial Col- lege, was appointed assistant to Printz and director of the colony, in case Printz should leave. Johan Rising was a man of outstanding ability and of wide training, the first economist of note in Sweden, a generation or more ahead of his time. He had traveled widely on the Continent and in England, and had studied at first hand the economic and commercial theories and activities of the great mercantile nations of Europe. Like all educated Swedes of his day, he was intensely patriotic and de- voted his energies to the furtherance of Swedish interests. Peter Lindestrém, a young nobleman who had specialized in “mathematics and the art of fortification,” was appointed for service in New Sweden as a military engineer; and Sven Skute, an officer who had returned to Sweden in 1650 bringing reports from Governor Printz, was now sent back to the colony as “Cap- tain of the landspeople.” Lindestrém has left us a detailed account of the preparations at Gothenburg and the voyage of the Orn to New Sweden. No 18 Swedes in America criminals, other malefactors, or people of generally evil report, he informs us, were permitted to sail. Moreover, about one hundred families, good honest people, who had fine rec- ommendations and a splendid reputation, had to remain [behind | in the [old] country with their wives and children, unable to get on the ship for want of room for such a great number, and [ these | increased more and more daily. These people were very much to be pitied because they had sold all their household articles, cattle, and all their [real] property, and all that they possessed, turned it into money and necessary commodities [for the voyage], sup- posing it could not by any means fail them to go along on the ship. On January 27, 1654, all of the people who had been fortu- nate enough to secure passage on the Orn took the oath of alle- giance to their Queen, their Fatherland, and the “Royal South Company,” and on February 2 the ship weighed anchor and sailed for New Sweden. The expedition encountered storms, contrary winds, and other misfortunes of many kinds. The vessel was searched by English warships and attacked by Turkish corsairs. The pas- sengers and sailors, for lack of fresh water and food, were tormented by various diseases, particularly dysentery and inter- mittent fevers, and many died at the Canaries and on the cross- ing of the Atlantic to the West Indies. And, as if not enough afflictions had tried the souls of the brave voyagers, violent storms off the American coast almost sent the battered ship with the remaining passengers and sailors to the bottom of the sea. With a great deal of difficulty, and only after the mainmast had been cut loose so as to right the ship in one storm, did the Orn finally reach ““New Sweden Bay” (Delaware Bay) and cast anchor before the ruins of Fort Elfsborg on the evening of May 20, 1654. It may be explained at this point that the Dutch, in 1651, had erected a post on the site of present New Castle, Delaware, which they had named Fort Casimir. This post made the Swed- ish post, Fort Elfsborg, across the river, untenable, and hence it was abandoned by Printz in the same year. Now Rising, hay- ing learned that Governor Printz had left New Sweden, re- solved to capture Fort Casimir forthwith. Consequently, on Colonists 19 Trinity Sunday, May 21, he sailed from the vicinity of old Fort Elfsborg across and up the Delaware River a short dis- tance and, without any difficulty, dispossessed the Dutch of their post, renaming it Fort Trefaldighet (Trinity). The Orn then proceeded to Fort Christina, where it arrived the next day, May 22. The Orn left New Sweden on July 15. Its return voyage was long and dangerous and it did not reach Stockholm until late September. The Golden Shark, which was to have sailed in company with the Orn, was greatly delayed by repairs and by the incom- petence of its crew. Captain Amundsson, a survivor of the un- fortunate Cat expedition, was placed in command of the vessel, but was removed, and Swen H66k appointed in his stead. Some of the emigrants who could not find room on the Orn went on the Shark, and a few soldiers and laborers also took passage on the ship. “But some of the people were bad,” and the mate was incompetent and “a rascal”—not a good omen for a successful journey. The ship was to go by way of Puerto Rico to collect damages from the Spaniards for the Cat and its cargo, and lengthy instructions were given to Hendrick von Elswick, who was appointed to succeed Hendrick Huygen as commissary of the colony, and to the other officers in New Sweden. On April 15, after three months of delay, the ship finally set sail “with a good wind.” It encountered the usual storms, the usual hardships and dangers. The water supply and the provi- sions became exhausted long before it reached its destination, making it necessary to touch at the Azores as well as the Carib- bean Islands, and the vessel did not reach Puerto Rico until June 20. Elswick, who had been especially charged with the task of collecting the Cat damages, was unsuccessful. After a month and a half of almost constant effort, he found the case hopeless and Swen H6ék ordered the ship to proceed to New Sweden. The Golden Shark left Puerto Rico on August 15 for the South River. By mistake she passed Delaware Bay and, prob- ably through the treachery of the mate, she was run in “behind Staten Island,” where she was seized by the Dutch. The ma- jority of the colonists and the crew were persuaded to remain 20 Swedes in America in New Amsterdam. The name of the ship was changed to Die- men and it was used “for the West Indian trade.” The addition in men and material which Rising was expecting thus miscar- ried. This was the last expedition sent from Gothenburg during the existence of the Delaware colony as a Swedish possession. The officers of the Company planned to send another expedi- tion shortly after the sailing of the Golden Shark in April, 1654, but the treasury was empty and the money which the Government owed the Company could not be collected. In June, Queen Christina delivered her scepter into the hands of her cousin, the more forceful Charles X. Immediately new life be- gan to animate the various departments of State. The New Sweden Company was reorganized and its capital stock in- creased. Several of the old stockholders paid up their subscrip- tions, and the tobacco monopoly of the Kingdom was assigned to the Company by royal proclamation. The reorganized cor- poration was officially called the American Company, but the old name was retained in the journals and account books. In the beginning of 1655 it was decided to buy a new ship in Holland for a journey to the Delaware, but no new ship an- swering the requirements could be purchased. Therefore an old one, the Mercurius, was bought instead, and was “rebuilt anew entirely.” A cargo was also procured in Holland and sent to Gothenburg on the vessel. The usual difficulties—contrary winds, nonarrival of sup- plies and ammunition, deserting sailors—delayed the expedi- tion. Some efforts were made to obtain colonists, but this was unnecessary. When the Mercurius was ready to sail, only 110 passengers were taken on board (making 130 souls, including the crew, on the ship) : A hundred persons or more were left behind [writes Papegoja] . It is a pity and shame that they cannot all go along. Here was seen such a lamentation and weeping, for the unfortunate ones have sold all they possessed, yea [they have] done away with home and ground for half of the value, journeyed such a long way at their own expense and are now compelled to take up the beggar’s staff, the one going here, the other there. After two or three futile starts, the Mercurius finally got Colonists 21 under sail on November 25. She was nearly four months at sea, but apparently she had a rather pleasant voyage, and about the middle of March, 1656, sailed up the Delaware River. In the meantime the colony had been captured by the Dutch (1655), and the Mercurius was ordered to New Amsterdam without disembarking her passengers or unloading her cargo in former New Sweden. When the Indians heard about it, they went down to the vessel in great numbers and threatened to destroy all the white people in the river, Swedes and Dutch alike, unless the ship remained. Accordingly the Mercurius, with some savages on board, sailed up to Tinicum Island, where the passengers and cargo were taken ashore. The ship returned to Sweden some time during the summer. It is proper, at this point, to transfer our story to the settle- ment which was founded on March 29 (N.S. April 8), 1638: the present Wilmington, Delaware. When Peter Minuit left the colony in the summer of 1638, the soldiers and workmen con- tinued their daily routine, clearing ground for future farms, improving the fort, building new houses near the river, trading with the Indians, fishing, and hunting to provide fresh provi- sion for the table. The primitive dwellings which they erected here were, ac- cording to archeologists, the first log cabins of their type ever constructed in the United States. From the Swedes on the Dela- ware, according to these authorities, came this important con- tribution to early American life. Mans Kling with his little garrison expected a ship from Sweden in 1639, but none came. The visit of the Griffon in the late winter and early spring of that year, before her return to Europe, broke the monotony of their isolated lives, and we may assume that the commander of the vessel promised to hurry reinforcements. The Swedes, under the leadership of Hendrick Huygen, car- ried on a brisk traffic with the Indians, and Governor Kieft of - New Amsterdam complained bitterly that the Dutch-Indian trade “had fallen short fully thirty thousand [florins], because the Swedes, by underselling, depressed the market.” We know nothing about the internal life of New Sweden during the first two years, except a report from Dutch sources 22 Swedes in America that the garrison of Fort Christina was about to desert on April 17, 1640, and repair to the Dutch, having been invited to do so by the Dutch governor. The report seems improbable. At any rate the Kalmar Nyckel cast anchor before Fort Chris- tina on April 16, bringing new supplies, additional colonists, a pastor, the Reverend Reorus Torkillus, and a new Governor, Peter Hollender Ridder. Ridder was a man of great energy. He had been employed in Swedish services for many years and had proven himself a faithful and dependable officer. When he arrived in the colony | he found much to improve, but his first concern was to mend the walls of the fort, which were dilapidated, to build new houses, and repair the old ones. He cleared new tracts and had fences erected for the “two horses and a colt.” Some of the pigs which had been brought on the first expedition, or purchased from the neighbors, escaped into the woods, where they in- creased rapidly “and became wild.” Ridder made several proposals for betterments in the settle- ment and sent detailed reports to Stockholm. Huygen, assisted by Van Dyck, continued the Indian trade with splendid results, making it possible to dispatch the Kalmar Nyckel to Sweden on May 14, 1640, with a large cargo. , The Dutch, who had a fort (Nassau) on the eastern bank of the Delaware River, on Big 'Timber Creek opposite Philadel- phia, had protested vigorously to Minuit, and now protested to - Ridder, about the presence of the Swedes on the land that the Dutch claimed by first discovery and purchase from the In- dians. When the Swedes sailed up the Delaware above the Dutch stronghold, the commander tried to stop them, and did what he could with his limited means to keep the Swedes in check. Shortly after his arrival, Ridder increased the limits of New Sweden considerably by purchases from the Indians. One tract was bought on the western side of the river from the Schuylkill up to the Falls (present Trenton), a second tract on the same side of the river from Bombay Hook southward to beyond Cape Henlopen, and a third tract on the Jersey side, extending north and south from the present Salem. The English from New Haven came into the Delaware in Colonists 23 1641, and bought land, first on the eastern side above and below Varkens Kill, and second, on the western shore at the Schuyl- kill River. Several English settled at Varkens Kill (now Salem, New Jersey), where they built their dwellings in the English fashion and cleared land for plantations. Ridder reported their presence to Stockholm, but did not interfere with them. From English sources we learn that “sickness and mortality befell the Swedes in 1642,” but Swedish records are silent on the subject. There were two pastors in New Sweden before the coming of Printz: the Reverend Reorus Torkillus, arriving in 1640, and the Reverend Mr. Christopher, who arrived in November, 1641, but we know little about their labors. A chapel was probably erected near or inside Fort Christina in 1640. It is likely that Torkillus served in the fort and that Mr. Christopher minis- tered to the Swedes on the near-by plantations. Reorus Torkillus became the pioneer of Lutheranism in the New World, and the first Lutheran clergyman to serve within the present territory of the United States. He learned the In- dian language and tried to instruct the aborigines in the truths of Christianity, thus becoming the first Lutheran missionary among the American Indians, and the first Protestant clergy- man in the Delaware River Valley. 'Torkillus died on September 7, 1643, at the age of thirty-five. Johan Printz, as we have seen above, arrived at Fort Chris- tina on February 15, 1643, and assumed the management of the colony. He took his duties seriously and entered upon his work with all the energy at his command. In a letter to Oxen- stierna, the Swedish Chancellor, written on April 14, 1643, about two months after his arrival, he says: And I cannot humbly withold from Y[our] Excell[ency] in what manner I, with utmost diligence, have passed through the country New Sweden, firstly from Godin’s Bay, from Cape Henlopen unto Bomshuuk [Bombay Hook], and then from there way up to San- kikan [Trenton]. He found that it was “a remarkably beautiful country, with all the glories that any human being on earth at any time can de- 24 Swedes in America sire. . . . And this I wish to repeat,” he exclaims in a letter to Per Brahe, April 12, 1643, “that such a splendid country as this, which is endowed with all kinds of wonderful things, I have never seen, and nothing is wanting except means, diligence and seriousness to continue this work.” He found it fertile and well suited for agriculture, and he was certain that in time it would develop into one of the jewels of the Swedish Crown. We may be certain that the Swedish settlers were also im- pressed with the country. The climate was very different from that of their native land. The summers were long and extremely hot and the winters were short—or there was no winter at all— compared to those in Sweden. The settlers were undoubtedly impressed with the long days in the fall and winter. From No- vember until early spring they had been used to only a few hours of sunlight, while here more than half of the twenty-four hours were light, even on the shortest days. In his “Instruction” Printz was ordered to fortify the coun- try against the neighbors of New Sweden. Fort Christina was located far from the Delaware and could not command the river. Printz therefore selected a more convenient spot on the eastern shore, on an island (at present Elsenburg Fort Point, New Jersey), as the location for a new stronghold, which would be “the key to the Delaware River,” and would “keep out all intruders.” When this stronghold was ready, some time in the autumn of 1643, Printz had complete control of the Delaware, as the cannon of Fort Elfsborg could prevent any ship from sailing past. Printz also selected a place for his residence at Tinicum Island, and established another stronghold here, which he called Fort New Gothenburg. On the Island he erected a mansion for himself, beautiful and well built, says a contem- porary, with orchards and pleasure gardens. This was the first Statehouse of Pennsylvania, and from 1643 to the autumn of 1653 'Tinicum Island was the capital of New Sweden. During his administration in New Sweden (1643-53), Printz erected three forts—the two mentioned above, and “New Korsholm” in 1647, on Province Island in the Schuylkill; and six blockhouses: “Upland,” 1643 (at present Chester) ; “New Vasa,” 1643, at Kingsessing (West Philadelphia) ; a block- house on Province Island in the Schuylkill, 1643; “MéIndal,” Colonists | 25 1645 (at present Blue Bell Tavern, where Woodland Avenue crosses Cobb’s Creek in West Philadelphia) ; ““Torne,” in 1647; and a blockhouse on the east bank of the Schuylkill within pres- ent Philadelphia. Printz assigned plantations to the colonists who arrived with him, and during 1643 several new tracts were cleared alorig the river and creek. Printz had been advised to plant corn on most of the land, as it was said that corn would yield the largest crops; but the planting did not turn out according to expecta- tions. Besides, it was found that Indian corn could be bought cheaply from the aborigines. Printz, therefore, planted tobacco and sowed grain on the new lands the following year. The In- dian trade in New Sweden was lively at certain periods, when a ship came in or when merchandise had been bought from the English or Dutch traders; but New Sweden soon developed into an agricultural community rather than a trading colony, and the beaver trade was never large. Some years, the crops in New Sweden were so plentiful that large quantities of grain could be sold, but other years there were crop failures and pro- visions had to be purchased from the neighbors. Several trad- ing expeditions were sent from New Sweden to New Amster- dam, to New England, and to Virginia. Cattle, horses, and other domestic animals were purchased on these journeys, as well as merchandise of various kinds. The Swedes also sold to their neighbors considerable quantities of goods manufactured in Sweden, such as brushes, and tools made of Swedish steel and iron. Printz was greatly handicapped, not only by lack of sup- plies but by the absence of skilled laborers and sufficient colo- nists. ‘The work at first was slow and tedious on account of the few workmen, but Printz was a hard taskmaster and kept the people constantly at their jobs. Printz purchased two or three vessels from the English and Dutch and also built his own boats. He asked for a warship from Sweden to remain in the river as a protection against in- truders and, as such a ship was not furnished, he built a vessel himself of about two hundred tons burden, a very large ship for those days. It was completely ready in 1652, except for tackle, cannon, and other equipment. The equipment never 26 Swedes in America arrived from Sweden, and the ship finally decayed and fell to ieces. “ The first flour mill in New Sweden was erected on the Rocks in the present Wilmington. It was a windmill that ground the flour for the colonists for several years. In 1645 the mill be- came inadequate to serve the increased population. Accord- ingly, Printz erected a water mill on Cobb’s Creek near present Blue Bell Tavern, about two hundred feet above the bridge on Woodland Avenue that crosses the creek. The place was called Mélndal, ‘‘as the mill was there,” and a miller had charge of “the factory” and ground the flour of the colonists for a certain toll. This mill served for generations and is often mentioned in the records throughout the seventeenth century. It was the first “factory” in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. After the arrival of the large expedition in 1643, the total male population of New Sweden was 135, but 26 officers and _ men died during the year and 4 returned to Europe, leaving only 105 adult male inhabitants in the colony in June, 1644. We do not know how many women and children there were, but the total population of the settlement at this time could not have been over two hundred souls. Most of these were Swedes. At least nine were English. One of the settlers, Lars Andersson, came from Aland. There were at least two Germans, Rother Tyck and Johan Hartman, both from Hamburg. There were very few Finns in the colony at this early date (1644). Only two are definitely mentioned in the lists, although there were undoubtedly a few more: “Mar- tin Tomasson, the Finn from Osterbotten,” and “the freeman, called Johan the Finn, [who was] drowned at Upland.”* Finns came here on later expeditions, but at no time did they make up a predominant element in New Sweden. A district south of Upland (present Chester) is actually called Finland on Lindestrém’s map. This place was first settled in 1641, but apparently it was not called Finland until the arrival of Rising in 1654. Governor Printz does not call the place Finland in his list of cultivated districts in 1644, nor in his inventory of 1653. The fact that he called the blockhouse at Kingsessing (present 1. See Amandus Johnson, Swedish Settlements, II, 699 ff.; Instruction for Johan Printz, 42-44, | Colonists 27 Philadelphia) Vasa, after a town in Finland, may indicate that the place was settled by “Swedish Finns.” In 1648, the total adult male population was only about ninety. These were also mostly Swedes. There was at least one Dane, one Negro slave, three or four Dutchmen, about four Germans, and probably a dozen Finns (only six, however, are definitely mentioned on the list of this year’ as Finns). The fact that some were singled out and called “Henrik, the Finn,” “Mans, the Finn,” etc., proves conclusively that the Finns were in the minority ; that they were very few in number. It is likely, however, that no distinction was made between Swedish Finns and citizens from Sweden proper. Most of the 110 colonists that arrived here on the Mercurius in 1656 were Finns from Varmland, who in some cases spoke no Swedish, but all of whom had Swedish names.® The first dwellings erected here by the Swedes and Finns were primitive, one-room log cabins, probably about 12 feet by 14 feet in size, and this room served as workshop, dining room, bedroom, and everything else. A primitive fireplace was set up in one of the corners. These earliest dwellings were built of round logs laid close together, with their ends cut into each other. Log cabins of this character are still found in the Dela- ware Valley. As time went on, more pretentious dwellings were erected. Some of these were built of square logs with flush cor- ners. At least one dwelling of this type still survives in New Jersey. The diet of the people was greatly changed after coming to New Sweden. They could not always obtain the provisions to which they had been accustomed and were often compelled to adopt new dishes from the Indians. Indian corn bread was one of these adaptations which the Swedes seem to have relished. Fish and venison were at times plentiful. The Swedes used nets and fishhooks for catching fish, and fowling pieces, as well as - snares, for larger game. It is also quite likely that in hunting, 2. Johnson, Swedish Settlements, II, 710 ff. In the Férklaring we find “Clemet” and Lars called Finns, and we may take for granted that Johan and - Anders mentioned in connection with “Clemet” and Lars are also Finns. See idem, I, 462 ff. 8. Idem, II, 634, 724 ff. 28 Swedes in America many of the settlers used crossbows, which were common in Sweden at this time and were very efficient in the hands of a skilled marksman. The relations between the Indians and the Swedes were nearly always friendly. Only one or two minor incidents oc- curred. In the “Instruction” for Governor Printz it was stated that the Governor must treat the Indians in a friendly manner, never do them any injustice, and try to convert them to Chris- tianity. This policy was followed throughout the history of New Sweden. As a result, the Indians called the Swedes Ne- tappi; i.e., “our kind,” or “our people.” The English and Dutch were foreigners, an entirely strange race, but the Swedes were different. This friendship continued for many genera- tions; and long after New Sweden had been absorbed by the Dutch, and later by the English, the Indians looked upon the Swedes as their particular friends. On June 8, 1654, ten Indian chiefs came to Tinicum Island to renew the friendship with the Swedes. Governor Rising, who was in charge, has given us an interesting account of this con- vention. After presents had been delivered to the Indians the leading chief spoke somewhat as follows: See how good friends these are who have given us these gifts. We shall be as one body and one soul. If in the time of Governor Printz, the big belly, we were friendly, we shall now be as a cala- bash without a crack or crevice and we want to make a pact of perpetual friendship with you. If someone should attack you, _ though it were in the middle of the night, we will come to your aid, and if someone should attack us, though it were in the middle of the night, you must come to our aid. William Penn has been praised for his peaceful relations with the Indians and he deserves this commendation. But if it had not been for the attitude of the Swedes long before Wil- liam Penn came to America, it would not have been possible for him to carry out his policies. The Indians would not have had confidence in the white man, had they been treated by the Swedes as they were treated by the English and the Dutch. William Penn’s interpreters were Swedes, and the Indians re- Colonists — 29 lied on their word when they assured them that William Penn was honest and would treat them justly. Johan Printz has been called the first judge in the Delaware Valley. That is not true. Law courts were held here before Johan Printz arrived, but it is a fact that justice and order were more firmly established after his arrival. We have several records of law courts held within the present limits of Pennsyl- vania during the existence of New Sweden. It is also an inter- esting fact that the jury was first introduced into this territory by the Swedes and not by the English, as is usually stated. The jury system had been prevalent in Sweden from time immemo- rial, and Johan Printz was instructed to follow the customs and usages that obtained in the mother country. The seventeenth century was a religious age. Prayers and religious exercises were conducted on all occasions, and religion, although not regarded in the same way as it is today, occupied a very important place in the daily lives of the people of Swe- den. Special paragraphs in the various instructions to the gov- ernors of New Sweden are devoted to religion and religious exercises, and Printz was especially enjoined to see to it that churches were erected, and that the strict Lutheran doctrine was taught according to Swedish church laws and usage. During the governorship of Printz, four pastors served in the colony. These clergymen were also farmers, and raised do- mestic animals for their own needs. The most important of these was Johan Campanius who came here, as we have seen, with the Governor, and served until 1648. He was a man of unusual attainments, a scientist and scholar as well as a theolo- gian, and has been called the first meteorologist in America. He translated Luther’s small catechism into the Indian language (164448) and did considerable missionary work among the aborigines. Printz erected a chapel on Tinicum Island in 1643, but this _ was destroyed in the great fire two years later. In the spring of 1646, Printz made plans for the erection of a church at Tini- cum Island. It was built of logs with a roof of clapboards bought from the English. It was fitted out and decorated in Swedish fashion and a burial place was laid out near the church. “The Handsome Church,” as it was called, was ready in the autumn, 30 S'wedes in America and was dedicated on September 4 by Johan Campanius and Israel Fluviander. The Swedish Lutheran order of services was followed closely in New Sweden and the three principal holidays, Christmas, Easter, and Pentecost, were strictly observed. The services on these holidays began very early in the morning—about four or five—and lasted until eight or nine. Sometimes services were conducted in the afternoon also. Other holidays, such as New Year’s, Epiphany, and Candlemas Day, were likewise observed, as well as two or three solemn prayer days during the week. — Services were conducted on Wednesdays and Fridays, probably alternately at New Gothenburg and Christina. Prayers were offered every morning and evening, accompanied with psalm singing, in the forts as well as in the private dwellings of the settlers. During the first few years of the governorship of Printz, peaceful relations existed with the Dutch, but there was much trouble with the English. Several people from the New Eng- land colonies came into the river to trade, and especially one George Lamberton, from the colony of New Haven, trucked with the aborigines without respect for the Swedes and without paying any attention to Swedish protests. As a consequence, Lamberton was arrested by Governor Printz, tried at Fort Christina, and fined heavily. On Lamberton’s return to New Haven, he complained bitterly of the treatment he had received in New Sweden. Out of this grew an interesting correspondence - between Governor Winthrop and Governor Printz. Finally, the _ matter was settled amicably. Other attempts were made by the _ English to establish themselves along the Delaware, but these _ efforts were frustrated by the Dutch and the Swedes. The small — English colony, now Salem, New Jersey, was allowed to re- main, however, for there the English swore allegiance to the _ Swedish Crown. They raised tobacco and probably corn and other grains, and they were able to sell several thousand pounds of tobacco to the New Sweden Company for one of the cargoes. The relations with the Dutch took a turn for the worse in 1645, when Andreas Hudde replaced Jan Janssen as com- mandant at the Dutch post of Fort Nassau. From now on, we read of constant disputes, protests, and counterprotests be- Colonists - 31 tween the two peoples. Finally, in 1651, Peter Stuyvesant him- self came to the South River, since none of his inferiors could make an impression on Governor Printz. Stuyvesant arrived with a strong force against which Printz could do nothing. He bought from the Indians large tracts of land, which the Swedes had purchased years before, and finally erected, as has already been noted, a fortress at Sandhook (now New Castle, Dela- ware), calling it Fort Casimir. This fort commanded the river and made the Dutch masters of the valley. Printz wrote often to Sweden asking for aid, new supplies, new colonists, and more soldiers; but Queen Christina was, as noted above, more inter- ested at this time in philosophy, pageants, and balls than in the little settlement on the Delaware, and Printz was left more or less to himself. The Cat expedition, which would have relieved the distress, was wrecked, as we have seen. Printz also had internal troubles to contend with. An insur- rection arose against the Governor, and some of his people de- serted him. ‘“The rebels,” as the Governor called them, pre- sented a written supplication of eleven articles, signed by twenty-two settlers. The Governor was accused of avarice and brutality, and of ill-treating the settlers on many occasions, making it almost impossible for them “‘to find their sustenance.” The petition kindled the wrath of the Governor, who used strong measures. He had the ringleader, Anders Jénsson, ar- rested and, after trial, executed on a charge of treason. A few days after the execution, which took place on August 1, 1653, the Governor made a written reply to the charges, denying everything he had been accused of and explaining the various points of difference. Printz was now finding his position unten- able, however, and made preparations to return to Europe to hurry the dispatching of ships and aid to the sorely tried Swed- ish settlement. Delivering the government of the colony into the hands of Johan Papegoja, Printz left New Sweden with his ’ family about the beginning of October, 1653, and reached old Sweden shortly after Rising’s expedition had left Gothenburg. When Rising arrived in the Delaware in May, 1654, and took over the management of the colony, he settled at Fort Christina, which thus again became the capital of New Sweden. Rising was a man of great energy and much learning, but he 82 Swedes in America was undiplomatic; and by his unwise capture of Fort Casimir — on Trinity Sunday, 1654, he called forth the storm which | finally destroyed Swedish power in the New World. Shortly after his arrival, Rising assembled the settlers, first at Fort Christina, and (eee at 'Tinicum Island. He admon- ished them to be true and faithful citizens and to live up to the laws and regulations of the Swedish Government and of the Swedish Company. The old difficulties with Printz were aired and discussed; but not even a compromise could be effected— the feelings ran too high. The new arrivals were given farms and plantations to culti- vate, most of them between Fort Christina and Fort Trefaldig- het, and by fall a great many new dwellings had been erected. Rising paid much attention to agriculture, cattle raising, and even forestry. He drew up rules and regulations for every form of activity, and the outlook for a prosperous period was bright. By the summer of 1655 the tillable area of New Sweden had increased greatly, and the settlers were prosperous and con- tented. There was activity everywhere, and a new spirit ani- mated the people. But in the autumn the merchandise in the storehouse at Fort Christina became low. The Golden Shark, whose cargo would have supplied every want, ran into New Amsterdam and was captured by Stuyvesant. Soon the entire stock of cloth for undergarments and other clothes was con- sumed. It became necessary to sew shirts out of sailcloth for the soldiers and servants. But this material also gave out, and the plight of the people was great. In August the Dutch Governor came to New Sweden with a large force of ships and soldiers, ravaged the farms, and seized the Swedish posts. On September 15, Rising signed articles of capitulation. When this had been done, Governor Stuyvesant made a gen- erous proposal to his defeated foe. He offered to return the colony and the forts (except Fort Casimir) to the Swedes and let bygones be bygones, on condition that the Swedes and the Dutch would live together as friends and work for their mutual benefit. Rising could not accept this offer, as he felt that the matter was too grave and could be passed on only by his supe- riors at Stockholm. Stuyvesant, of course, did not make this Colonists - 833 surprising offer out of the goodness of his heart. The fact was that the Indians, true to their treaty with the Swedes, had fallen upon the Dutch and threatened to destroy the settlement of New Amsterdam. Those in authority there frantically called upon Stuyvesant to return as quickly as possible and defend his own colony against the savage foes. In Stuyvesant’s opin- ion, it was dangerous to leave the Swedish farmers as enemies in the Delaware River Valley. Thus New Sweden as a political unit came to an end. Rising and about thirty other officers and soldiers returned to the fatherland, but the rest remained. According to the articles of surrender, the Swedes were allowed to keep a pastor of their own confession among them. The Reverend Lars Lock, who had come to New Sweden in 1648, remained, but the other pastors returned to Sweden. After 1655, the Swedes and Finns began to clear lands and to build homes on the Jersey shore, and by 1682 (the coming of Penn) the eastern side of the Delaware was dotted with home- steads for a considerable distance from Salem northward. One of the settlements was called Stockholm, indicating that the colonists came from the Swedish capital—the date of the settle- ment, however, is uncertain; and another place became known as Sveaborg (present Swedesboro). On the western side of the Delaware River, the Swedish settlements at the time of Penn’s arrival were, of course, greater in number and larger in area. They extended roughly from a point between New Castle and Wilmington, on both sides of the Christina River, in the pres- ent State of Delaware, northward beyond Philadelphia, almost as far as Bristol in the present State of Pennsylvania. The Swedish colony as a social unit did not disappear with the capture of its forts. The Swedes dominated the Delaware Valley until the coming of Penn. Several new additions arrived from Sweden and Finland, and a few Dutch and English who came to live here were compelled to learn Swedish in order to be able to trade with their neighbors. As a result, Swedish was the everyday language along the Delaware for more than a gen- eration. With the coming of William Penn in 1682, the situation changed. The Swedes lost their ascendancy and English be- oe \\ , ver > i P boa Oe tr yaa wre | ‘ SS ORE Ore ; Fy i ab wee CAL”) Ae oe 34 S'wedes in America came the dominant language. It has been said that William Penn founded Pennsylvania. When he came here, he found a fully established community with churches and schools and law courts, and all the other elements of civilization. He changed the name of the colony, as well as the name of some of the cities that existed before he came—as, for instance, Upland to Ches- ter. He did found the city of Philadelphia and some other places, but not the colony as such—he merely changed its name. A C ba St P24 narks GEORGE H.

LL aboard,” cries the guide, as eager groups of tourists from the East, the Middle West, and the Far West, as well as from Sweden itself, hurriedly enter gaily be- flagged omnibuses to be off on a tour of northern Delaware, southeastern Pennsylvania, and southwestern New Jersey—a territorial area which once upon a time comprised the ancient colony of New Sweden. The occasion of all the commotion, of course, is the celebra- tion of the three-hundredth anniversary, in 1938, of the landing of the Swedes at the “Rocks,” located in what is now Wilming- ton, Delaware; for, naturally enough, people of Swedish birth and descent throughout the United States, as well as people in Sweden, are much interested in the place where the representa- tives of their race first set foot upon American soil. They are also eager to see the other places in the Delaware River Valley where the Swedes of the seventeenth century once settled, and, so, the tour of New Sweden is herewith presented. 86 Swedes in America The “Rocks” at Fort Christina State Park Brecinnin¢ our tour at Rodney Square, the civic center of Wil- mington, and proceeding southward on Market Street to Sev- enth Street, we turn east at that intersection, and continue on our course directly past “Old Swedes” Church (to be described later) until we reach the entrance to Fort Christina State Park, the site of which was recently acquired by the State of Dela- ware. Here we are treading upon sacred soil; for here, at the farther end of a walk bordered by trees, we come upon the fa- mous landing place; a ledge of rock jutting out upon the Chris- tina River and forming a natural wharf for the seventeenth- century Swedish pioneers. Beside the Rocks the Swedes built a fort which they named “Fort Christina,” after their youthful Queen. They also named the river “Christina River,” and the hamlet, which eventually was built beside the fort, they called “Christinehamn.” There are no remains of these human habitations, to be sure, but there will soon stand near the Rocks a magnificent monument, exe- cuted by the world-famous Swedish sculptor, Carl Milles. This monument, which will be unveiled on June 27, 1938, will depict in Swedish black granite the arrival of the Kalmar Nyckel, the ship that brought the first Swedish settlers. It will consist of a column twenty-one feet high, with a representation of the ship at its top, and will be a gift from the people of Sweden to the people of America, expressing the good will of the Swedish people toward the people of our country. The fort which the Swedes built at the Rocks was not only a military stronghold but also a trading post. Here the Swedes purchased furs from the Indians, and here the furs were stored in a warehouse until such time as they could be transported to Sweden to be sold. As more Swedish settlements were established to the north, in what is now Pennsylvania, and across the. Dela- ware River, in what is today New Jersey, Fort Christina as- sumed the greater dignity of being the capital of the little colony of New Sweden. It retained this dignity until the arrival, in 1643, of Governor Johan Printz, who transferred the seat of government to the island of 'Tinicum near present-day Phila- delphia. Fort Christina, in point of fact, was the first perma- ——— Colonial Landmarks 87 nent settlement, not only in the State of Delaware, but in the whole Delaware River Valley as well. Here, too, were conducted the first religious services (the Swedish Lutheran), the Rever- end Reorus Torkillus, who came in 1640, being the first or- dained clergyman in the valley to preach the Christian Gospel and to administer the Christian sacraments. | Fortunately, the plan of Fort Christina was preserved for posterity by a Swedish military engineer, Peter Lindestrém by name, who arrived in this country in the company of the last Swedish Governor of New Sweden, Johan Rising. The original drawing is deposited in the Royal Archives in Stockholm, Swe- den, but it has been reproduced in several publications, notably in Dr. Amandus Johnson’s work entitled The Swedish Settle- ments on the Delaware. Lindestrém assisted Governor Rising in the defense of Fort Christina in September, 1655, and de- scribed in detail in his Geographia Americe its investment by the Dutch and its surrender to Peter Stuyvesant, the Governor of the colony of New Netherland. Back in 1903, the Delaware Society of Colonial Dames of America erected a large fragment of the Rocks, with one side highly polished, and with an inscription that reads as follows: This stone is a portion of the Rocks on which landed the first Swedish Colonists in America, 29 March, 1638. On this spot stood Fort Christina. Here the Swedes held their first Civil Courts and in the Chapel of the Fort celebrated their first Christian Worship in the New World. When Peter Kalm, the Swedish naturalist, visited Wilming- ton in the fall of 1748, the local Swedish pastor, the Reverend Peter Tranberg, informed him that during the previous sum- mer, when Wilmington residents built a fort to guard the town against French and Spanish privateers, they erected it on the site of Fort Christina, and in making excavations had come upon old iron tools such as axes and shovels, and a Swedish silver coin which had been minted in 1633 or during the reign of Queen Christina. Not very far from Fort Christina Governor Rising built a governor’s mansion where he entertained many visitors, Eng- lish and Dutch as well as Swedes. 88 Swedes in America Swedish farmsteads were to be seen on both sides of the Chris- tina River, tobacco and Indian corn being important staples. Orchard trees were likewise planted, and cattle and hogs were raised. The present Brandywine River, which empties into the Christina River, the Swedes named “Fiske Kill” or Fish River, and a creek that flows into the Brandywine near its confluence with the Christina they named “Skoldpaddekill,” or Turtle Creek. With the coming of the English, this name, like so many other Swedish and Dutch place and family names in Delaware, was corrupted. Nowadays Sk6ldpaddekill is known as Shellpot Creek, giving no indication of its first Swedish form. Site of T'ranhook (Cranehook) Church ALTHOUGH the Swedes in all probability built a chapel within the walls of Fort Christina during the days when Torkillus was chaplain, and continued to worship there after the capture of the fort by the Dutch in 1655, as well as before that event, they decided in 1667, after the establishment of English authority which followed the fall of New Netherland in 1664, to build a house of worship at ““Tranhook” (Cranehook), on the south side of the Christina River, near its confluence with the Delaware River. This was to accommodate the Swedish farmers living southward along the Delaware as far as Sandhook (called by the English, New Castle), the Swedish farmers in New Jersey on the east side of the Delaware River, and those living north of the Christina River in the direction of Upland (Chester) and 'Tinicum—settlements now within the boundaries of Penn- sylvania. 'This church was evidently of modest dimensions and built of logs. To reach the site in these modern days one can go down the Christina River by boat a distance of two miles or so, debark at the modern Marine Terminal, and then walk a half- mile to the south; or one can drive over the bridge which crosses the Christina River just above the Wilson Boat Line wharf at Fourth Street and Christina Avenue, go thence along Christina Avenue to the vicinity of the Marine Terminal, and turn south- ward to the site. Although this site is marked by a modest stone erected by the Historical Society of Delaware in 1896, nothing remains of the church building. Even the farm lands are now Colonial Landmarks 39 deserted, only abandoned roads indicating that formerly a population lived here large enough to support a church and a preacher of the Christian Gospel. Site of Fort T'refaldighet at New Castle By driving from the site of Cranehook Church about five miles to the south, one reaches the quaint old town of New Castle. This place was founded by Peter Stuyvesant, the Dutch Gov- ernor of New Amsterdam, when, in 1651, he built Fort Casimir in an attempt to secure from the Swedes the control of the Dela- ware River. Although, before his return to Sweden in 1653, Governor Printz took no steps to dislodge the Dutch, his suc- cessor, Johan Rising, with the aid of his military engineer, Peter Lindestrém, seized Fort Casimir on Trinity Sunday, 1654, and renamed it “Fort Trefaldighet,” or Fort Trinity. The site of the fort is at the shore of the Delaware River, immediately be- side the present New Castle ferry landing. Lindestrém said, in his Geographia America, that the Dutch had permitted the fort to decay and that he rebuilt it from its foundations. The Swedes, however, held the fort only until September, 1655, when Peter Stuyvesant came into the Delaware River with a large force and conquered New Sweden by taking both Fort Trinity and Fort Christina. The Dutch hamlet that grew up beside Fort Casimir was called New Amstel, and when the Eng- lish seized control of the place in 1664, they renamed it New Castle. Heliga Trefaldighets Kyrka (Old Swedes Church) im Wilmington RETRACING our route to Wilmington, we shall stop at the inter- section of Seventh and Church Streets, to visit the far-famed Swedish church which was dedicated on Trinity Sunday, June 4, 1699, and called by the Swedes “Heliga Trefaldighets Kyrka” (Holy Trinity Church). Our attention is immediately attracted to the beautiful bronze tablet which the Historic Markers Commission of Delaware placed on the wall beside the entrance to the churchyard in the year 1933. The inscription on its reads as follows: 40 Swedes in America Holy Trinity Church (Heliga Trefaldighets Kyrka) In 1638 a colony from Sweden landed at ‘The Rocks” nearby. There they built Fort Christina, worshiped therein until 1667, and then built a log church at Cranehook on South side of Christina River. In 1698, inspired by their pastor, Erik Bjork, they erected Holy Trinity Church. The tower was added in 1802. The Church of Swe- den withdrew in 1791 and was thenceforth succeeded by the Prot- estant Episcopal Church. When Swedish sovereignty over the colony of New Sweden came to an end in 1655, the Swedish settlers were left for a period of forty-two years without any supervision of their spiritual needs by the State Church of Sweden. To be sure, one of the Swedish pastors, the Reverend Lars Lock, who had ar- rived in 1648, remained in the country until his death in 1688. At first he served the Swedes on 'Tinicum Island and at Fort Christina, and, when the church at Cranehook was built in 1667, he preached there as well. In the year 1697, however, three new Lutheran clergymen arrived from Sweden, with instructions from the Swedish church authorities to revive the church work among the Swedes in America. These ministers were Andreas Rudman, Erik Bjérk, and Jonas Aurén. Since Rudman elected to serve the people in what is now Philadelphia and its vicinity, Bjork entered upon his duties as pastor of the Cranehook church. Very soon Bjork perceived that the thirty-year-old log church would not accommodate an expanding congregation, if success should attend his efforts. Moreover, he regarded its location as rather disadvantageous. Consequently, he lost no time in sug- gesting that a better site be obtained and a new church building erected. The old Swedish graveyard, only a stone’s throw from old Fort Christina, was fixed upon as the site of the new building, and to accommodate the members on the New Jersey side, in what is now called Pennsneck, as well as the people living south of the Christina River, a ferry service was arranged for.
