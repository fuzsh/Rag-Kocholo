Because if you have Harry Kane in your team, you feel stronger, for sure. Conte: Liverpool are template for success Tottenham have produced a stark upturn in form since Antonio Conte took the reins last month, but how will the Italian approach his toughest test yet when his side host Liverpool in front of the Sky cameras this weekend? He will have no shortage of lucrative options should he indicate he is ready to go this summer. His contract ends in 2023 but he has an option to extend it by another year. In terms of goals, the only other WSL player that can compete with their goalscoring form since the start of last season is record-breaking Arsenal striker Vivianne Miedema, but even she has struggled to keep up with the free-scoring Kerr. Allegri has, thus far, demonstrated a distinct lack of faith in Kulusevski, but even if he were to deem Federico Bernardeschi or Cuadrado better options out wide, it still seems unlikely that he would now sanction Kulusevski's sale.

The Hammers have two weeks to prepare for the first leg of their semi-final against Frankfurt, in London, with the away leg taking place one week later. Manchester City pulled no punches against a confident Fulham who scared them early through Fabio Carvalho, but Pep Guardiola overcame Marco Silva for a ninth time as City ran out 4-1 victors: a brace from Riyad Mahrez supplemented John Stones and Ilkay Gundogan's strikes. Trippier flew into Tyneside on Wednesday in a private jet following the conclusion of smooth and positive talks between the two clubs on Tuesday. We didn't cheat or do anything unsportsmanlike. The result sees Liverpool back within a point of leaders Manchester City. Midfielder Filippa Angeldal has also featured in 10 of City's 12 league fixtures this season, although was an unused substitute at the weekend. How has it come to this, how has Balotelli fared in recent years and is this a gamble which could pay off?

Both the top two have been willing to promote players from their academies to either make up the numbers on the bench or, in some cases, start key matches, but Tuchel has been reluctant to do so despite the strength of the Chelsea youth system. Millwall will fancy doing the same against Palace, and I've been impressed by the team Lions manager Gary Rowett has built with pretty limited resources. I still think Palace will win but, if they rest too many players, they might regret it. Under no circumstances should Josh Koroma have been on the pitch. The tackle is knee-high on Taylor. Carrick's caretaker reign got off to the best possible start on Tuesday night, and it has been reported that he could remain at the helm until the end of the season, if he continues to deliver positive results. So who could Wales and Scotland get in the semis? That said, will any of those sides fancy a trip to Cardiff or Glasgow? He was in with us, he's a brilliant character, a really nice lad and helped us a lot in the pre-season and now we decided to work together with him. Goalkeepers: Aly Keita (Ostersund, Sweden), Ibrahima Kone (Hibernians, Malta), Moussa Camara (Horoya, Guinea). There's a lot of good girls in the group and I feel well taken care of. Of course, manager Jonas Eidevall is Swedish too. Marco Asensio's goal coming off the bench ensured there was not a repeat of last year's Real Madrid's shock Copa del Rey defeat to Alcoyano. I am so happy to have him. There is genuine trust and I'm happy he can show it because he is absolutely ready to show it. The home supporters flooded onto the pitch in their thousands at the sound of the final whistle and the German side can now look forward to their first appearance in a European final in over four decades. But are Arsenal really the league's dirtiest team? Or are they being unfairly targeted by officials because of a perceived propensity for ill-discipline? According to Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf, Ten Hag did not communicate on the United subject with Ajax chief executive Edwin van der Saar - a former United number one goalkeeper - neither did he with his staff and the players.

Dortmund's directors don't hate Raiola, and they were glad to do a deal with him back in December 2019. But now they want clarity on the situation. The humiliating departure of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer from Manchester United begs the question whether he should have been given the job in the first place.
