        "text": "There's a feel of the FA Cup about the Europa League last-32, as an underdog English manager gets his time in the spotlight at the Emirates.\n\nArsenal have been pitted against Swedish minnows Ostersunds FK, who are led by former York defender Graham Potter.\n\nThe 42-year-old, who made one appearance for England Under-21s in 1996, took over Ostersund in 2011 and has not looked back since.\n\nPotter has overseen a remarkable rise, taking the Jamtland region side all the way from the fourth tier to European football - and they don't want to stop at the Europa League.\n\nHere is all you need to know about Arsenal's next Europa League opponents...\n\nOstersunds FK profiled\n\nFull name: Ostersunds Fotbollsklubb\n\nFounded: October 1996 - after Arsene Wenger was appointed Arsenal manager!\n\nGround: Jamkraft Arena, Ostersund\n\nCapacity: 8,466\n\nChairman: Daniel Kindberg\n\nLeague: Allsvenskan\n\n2017 finishing position: 5th\n\nWho is Graham Potter?\n\nPotter's playing career was nothing of note.\n\nIn England, he represented 11 different teams in the Football League, including Birmingham, Stoke, Southampton and West Brom.\n\nHe appeared for Southampton in the infamous 6-3 win over Manchester United in 1996, coming off the bench and replacing Simon Charlton.\n\nBut it was at York City where he was most renowned, making 131 appearances in all competitions at full-back.\n\nHis spell at Ostersund is his first foray into club management and he has gone from strength-to-strength, earning three promotions on the way to European football and domestic cup success.\n\nWith three wins out of six, only three English managers have more Europa League victories (excluding qualifiers) than Potter: Roy Hodgson (10 out of 21), Steve McClaren (six out of 18) and Alan Pardew (four out of 12).\n\nHe has become known locally for his unorthodox managerial techniques, which include making players take part in drama productions. The team performed Swan Lake in a local theatre in late 2015.\n\nHow did Potter end up as Ostersund?\n\nPotter signed a three-year contract as Ostersund manager back in December 2010, becoming the club's third English manager after Neil McDonald and Lee Makel.\n\nWhile studying a degree in leadership and emotional intelligence, Potter was put in touch with the club by former team-mate Graeme Jones, who was Roberto Martinez's assistant at Everton.\n\nSpeaking to the Daily Mail in 2016, Potter recalled his appointment: \"When I consider giving up my job, my wife's business and our family, it was bordering on insanity I guess!\n\n\"But it was also believing in the project. To make it all happen has made me very proud.\"\n\nDo they have any English players?\n\nCurtis Edwards, who only last year returned to English 10th-tier side Thornaby for a third spell, is one of two English players in Ostersund's current set-up.\n\nThe 23-year-old has also represented Darlington and Spennymoor Town since 2013 - but will now step out at the Emirates in European competition.\n\nJamie Hopcutt, who has previously represented York, Whitby Town, Stokesley, Ossett Town and Tadcaster Albion, has been playing with Ostersund in Sweden since 2012.\n\nHe is still only 25 years old.\n\nWhat are the clubs ambitions?\n\nOstersund are determined to reach the Champions League group stages, just as their compatriots Malmo did two seasons ago.\n\nSpeaking of the club's ambitions, Potter said: \"My chairman (Daniel Kindberg) is an ambitious guy. He wants to win the Allsvenskan and then get into the Champions League. That's the end goal.\n\n\"Six years ago when we were in the fourth tier of Swedish football that sounded like he needed to go to some institution.\n\n\"It's still the aim. That's what we want to try to do and work towards.\"\n\nWhen are the Europa League ties being played?\n\nArsenal will visit Ostersund on Thursday February 15, with the kick-off time yet to be decided.\n\nThe return leg at the Emirates will be one week later on February 22."
