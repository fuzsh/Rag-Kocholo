POPULAI t PICKS 0 F THE WEEK TWIST wrm BOBBY DARIN & e n-,' 'i;t fmmmf ddahI Comedy Night atjhe, Apollo \"StfOMS^saABLBY BBORm mm “TWIST WITH BOBBY DARIN”— Atco 33 138 Cashing in on the twist craze, Atco has come up with an album of some big Darin hits delivered with an effective dancing b^eat. Young songster’s performance is professional and mature as he reads “Early In The Morning,” “Queen Of The Hop,” and “You Must Have Been A Beautiful Baby.” Set includes two new Darin single hits in “Multiplication” and “Irresistible You.” Disk looms as a sure-fire chart item. “$1,000,000 WORTH OF TWANG, VOL. 11”— Duane Eddy — Jamie JLP 70 3021 Coming back with plenty of zip, Duane Eddy shows that he still has the same success ingred- ients that helped his first “Twang” session score in the coin department. Eddy reads a group of his previous hits including “Pepe,” “Gidet Goes Ha- waiian,” and “Theme From Dixie,” with his dis- tinctive. original style. LP seems a sales natural. “WOODY WOODBURY’S SALOONATICS”— Steroddities MW 4 Laughman Woodbury offers more of his usual gags and stories in this disk recorded live in Fort Lauderdale’s Bahama Hotel. Comic’s risque humor has had a large audience in the past and this new edition should prove equally successfuL A plus factor here are the sounds of Woodbury’s admiring audience. LP looms as a top-drawer seller. “THE ANDREWS SISTERS GREATEST HITS” —Dot DLP 3406 The Andrews Sisters offer a package of sturdies that were the biggest hits of their career. These are the tunes that one automatically associates with them. Their clear, bell-like voices are top form as they read “Beer Barrel Polka,” “Hold Tight,” and “Bei Mir Dist Du Schon.” Billy Vaughn has added modern instrumental back- grounds to the old, familiar vocal arrangements. Set should attract the trio’s fans in droves. “THE COLORFUL PERCUSSIONS OF AR- THUR LYMAN”— Hifirecords L 1005 Arthur Lyman shows his stuff in this potent fol- low-up disk to “Yellow Bird,” his recent hit LP. Lyman and his boys kick off with a dramatic ver- sion of “Exodus” and move quickly into other favorites such as “Blue Hawaii” and “Never On Sunday.” An interesting band contains the group’s jazz version of “Moanin’.” Disk should score on the charts. “COMEDY NIGHT AT THE APOLLO”— “Moms” Mabley and George Kirby — Vanguard VRS 9093 The Mabley humor is beautifully showcased in this album recorded live at New York’s Apollo Theatre. Moms display superior material and a first-rate delivery. George Kirby is also on hand as are the Keynotes, a group of singers who premiered the Theatre the night this disk was cut. Kirby’s bits are filled with yocks and a per- fect match to the Mabley wit. Unfortunately, much of the humor here is visual and lost on the record. However, the infectious spirit of this Vanguard offering makes it a sure noise-maker. “TRIBUTE TO 6”— Ray Allen— Blast BLP 6804 Ray Allen and the Upbeats have come up with a musical tribute to six late r&r stars in this at- tractive package from Blast. The boys shine as they render superb interpretations of Ritchie Valen’s “La Bamba” and “Donna.” Their form is tops as they read Johnny Horton’s “Battle Of New Orleans” and “North To Alaska.” Other artists given musical eulogies are Buddy Holl^ Jesse Belvin, Big Bopper and Eddie Conhran. LP has plenty of built-in sales appeal and should score in the coin department. 1 < M’THE MKwr illil SAM BUTB«* ANO THE WITHS6SES T8E TWBT • TSST TWiSTif 081B m waEsm twist* war twist TTIE ‘Lirs TWIST km MftlBE>*LS8S1,8IST.y(i Wi-WE ffl mi nusis * gi8w woiM . mi bt m LEO FUCKS rntmm sciif S88 Mfmmmmmmm MCSTTtX A. “BALLET WITH A BEAT” — Hal Mooney — Mer- cury PPS 6017 The swinging sounds of Hal Mooney skillfully at- tack a group of classical, semi-classical and popu- lar ballet themes. Mooney and his ork put an exciting, electric flavor into the standard pieces that they read. Orkster turns in excellent rendi- tions of “An American In Paris,” “March Of The Toys” and “Sleeping Beauty Waltz.” LP’s original arrangements make it first-rate listening fare. “DOIN’ THE TWIST WITH LOUIS PRIMA”— Dot DLP 25410 Jumping feet first on the twist bandwagon Louis Prima teams up with Sam Butera and the Wit- nesses for a swinging disk geared for dancing pleasure. The Prima sound is as distinctive as ever as he reads “The Twist,” “Marie,” and “Side By Side.” The Horace Ott arrangements seem perfectly suited for the rockin’ Prima voice. LP should score with both teens and their parents. ■KWAMINA” — Original Cast Capitol W 1645 Cut by Capitol after the show failed, African- based “Kwamina” had many Richard Adler num- bers well-worth an original-cast LP. The most noteworthy are the lovely, folkish “Nothing More To L(mk Forward To,” the “The Sun Is Begin- ning To Crow,” the comic “One Wife” and the strictly Schubert Row ballad, “What’s Wrong topped by Sally Ann Howes (Adlers wife), Terry Carter and Brock Peters. “BEI MIR BISTU SCHOEN”— Original Cast— Decca 79115 The sound of Second Avenue refuses to give in to the hard-boiled economics of today’s theatre. One 01 the biggest Yiddish musical successes of re- cent years is “Bei Mir Bistu Schoen,” whose original-caster will delight many a Yiddish mu- sical fan whose heart is still in the right senti- men^l and nostalgic place. Sholom Secunda, the vet, deft hand at Yiddish musical scores, has writ- ten a number of varied, tuneful numbers (mostly sung in Yiddish) — and included, of course, is oecunda s title favorite. Leo Fuchs, Jacob Jacobs, who also wrote the lyrics, Miriam Kressyn and Leon Liebgold head the reliable cast. DANCING THE BIG TWIST” — Ray Bryant and His Combo — Columbia CL 1746 Ray Bryant has come up with an unusual LP that combines both good jazz and music for twist- ing. The 88’er plays with dexterity as does his ac- complished crew. The boys turn in rousing ver- “Twist City,” “Big Susie,” and “Twist On. There s enough here to attract both twist- ers and jazz buffs. “SING SING SING-ALONG”— A1 Alberts Jubi- lee JGM 2040 Jubilee dishes up an extremely funny collection of evergreen melodies with new satirical l3ndcs. The whole thing is a take-off on sing-along disks. A1 Alberts and the Lifers Chorus read prison- oriented lyrics with style and charm. Half the fun, is the absurdity of the words set to tune of standard melodies. Many laughs to be had here. “STRING BAND STRUM-ALONG”— Tony Mot- tola — Command RS 828 SD Tony Mottola, on the electric guitar, heads up a hand-picked group of string musicians in this excellent collection of evergreens from Command The arrangements here are fresh, exciting, and vibrant. The band starts things off with a rousing version of “Happy Days,” and launches into equally swinging renditions of “Carolina In The Morning” and “Twelfth Street Rag.” Disk pro- vides first-rate listening pleasure. ... To All of You . . . From All of Us . . . For A F ^ry Successful Year LAWRENCE And The Champagne Music Makers Current Albums: “MOON RIVER\" Dot DLP 3472 “NORMA ZIMMER SINGS TRUE LOVE” / Dot DLP 25404 Cash Box — December 30, 1961 33 ALBUM REVIEWS mmn enTOTait alls “HAVE A GOOD TIME WITH JOE WILLIAMS” — Roulette R52071 Joe Williams is in his usual top form as he reads a group of Ernie Wilkins-arranged sturdies in this Birdland series LP from Roulette. The re- laxed, easy Williams style perfectly captures the mood of “Old Folks,” “A Blues Serenade,” and “Moonlight In Vermont.” Harry “Sweets” Edison and his ork provide a well-molded musical back- ground for the songster’s vocal talents. Disk should attract attention with Williams’ fans. “MARTYN GREEN SIGNS THE GILBERT & SULLIVAN SONG BOOK”— MGM E 3980 The magnificent impish quality of Martyn Green brings a touch of genius to this fine collection of melodies from the light operas of Gilbert & Sul- livan. Perhaps no other singer in the world today is more closely associated with G & S than Green. His steadfast devotion to his craft has earned him an endless string of laurels and this disk must rank as still another honor for the talented Britisher. The Green reading of “I Am The Very Modern Of Modern Major General” is the high- point of the album and must be classed as super- lative lung work. Jane Bronhill and Andrew Gold assist in other selections. Disk should attract mobs of Green and Gilbert & Sullivan fans. “15 COUNTRY GREATS BY 8 GREAT ART- ISTS”—Hickory LP M 105 Hickory has, in this album, a first-rate group of favorite tunes that should appeal to all appreci- ators of country music. The cast is all-star includ- ing Margie Bowes, Roy Acuff, and Rusty & Doug. The tunes are sturdies with proven records of pub- lic acceptance. LP should draw attention in coun- try circles. “THE SOUND OF FOLK MUSIC”— Various Art- ists— SRV 125 Vanguard has produced a splendid album that will delight all folk tune fans. Disk offers a taste of the top folk stars including Odetta, the Weav- ers, Leon Bibb, Joan Baez and Ronnie Gilbert. The songs come from a worldwide catalog of folk favorites with “Michael Row The Boat,” “East Virginia,” and “Down On Me,” standing out as highlights. LP could become hot item with folk music followers. “JUSTIN TUBB”— Starday SLP 160 Justin Tubb comes through on this Starday offer- ing with a fine collection of his past hits. The Grand Ole Opry chanter displays an original style and professional delivery as he reads “I’d Know You Anywhere,” and “One For You — One For Me.” Songster has more than enough coun- try authority and sincerity to attract a slew of his fans to the LP. “THE GOLDEN COUNTRY HITS”— Warner Mack— Kapp KL 1255 For his first Kapp album Warner Mack offers a fine collection of country winners tastefully ar- ranged and read. The sincere Mack voice has plenty of hillbilly authority as he delivers “A Sat- isfied Mind,” “Don’t Worry,” and “Room Full Of Roses.” LP should catch on with all of Mack’s admirers and win him a new flock of devotees. “PLAY AND SING ALONG TOO!”— Clyde Sech- ler — Ad Lib A224 Ad Lib has a clever idea in this kiddie album that is being released with three tinfoil hand wind instruments for the children to play along as well as sing. Clyde Sechler leads a children’s chorus through the paces of some popular folk songs in- cluding “Who Put The Farmer In The Dell” and “I’ve Been Working On The Railroad.” Set seems a perfect way to introduce kids to music. JAZZ PICK OF THE WEE K “SE'TTIN’ THE PACE”— John Coltrane— Pres- tige 7213 Cut during his exclusive days with Prestige, this disk provides a superb portrait of the swinging brand of jazz associated with John Coltrane. The selections here are extremely varied including “I See Your Face Before Me,” “Little Melonae,” and “Rise And Shine.” Kudos also go to Red Garland, who turns in a first rate job on the piano. Disk has strong sales potential. a “BASH” — Dave Bailey Sextet — Jazz Line JAZ 33-01 Starting off with an impressive version of Sonny Rollins’ “Grand Street” Dave Bailey and his boys give proof positive of their stature as noteworthy jazz artists. The group turns in admirable jobs on “Like Someone In Love” and “Just Friends.” This Rudy Stevenson arranged disk could make some noise with Bailey devotees. “LET ME TELL YOU ’BOUT IT”— Leo Parker- Blue Note 4087 For his first Blue Note disk Leo Parker’s bari- tone sax is teamed up with a fine group of musi- cians with John Burks on trumpet. Bill Swidell on tenor sax, Yusef Salim on piano, Stan Conover on bass, and Purnell Rice on drums. All the tunes here are originals and delivered with professional artistry and control. Notable selections are “Glad Lad,” a catchy uptempo number with Parker tak- ing the opening solo, and “Vi,” a swinging, free- flowing thing with the group turning in a top- notch performance. LP rates as excellent jazz listening. “WHITE GARDENIA” — Johnny Griffin — River- side RLP 387 Johnny Griffin offers his personal tribute to Billj Holiday in this album of tunes that the late thrush made famous. There is one Griffin original in “White Gardenia,” a Holiday-like tune that could well have been one of the lark’s songs. An accomplished group of jazz musicians accompany the Griffin tenor sax in readings of “Gloomy Sun- day,” “No More,” and “Don’t Explain.” Top-flight arrangements by Melba Liston and Norman Sim- mons give the set a polished free-flowung touch. CLASSICAL PICK OF THE WEEK CHOPIN: Sonata in B-Flat Minor, Op. 35; Sonata in B-Minor, Op. 58 — Artur Rubinstein, pianist — RCA Victor LD 2554 The nimble fingers of Artur Rubinstein treat Chopin as an old friend in this brilliant disk from Victor. Pianist has put exactly the right amount of expression into the ‘Funeral March’ to appeal to even the most discriminating audiences. The Rubinstein approach to the “Sonata In B-Minor” comes from a firm understanding of the music coupled wdth superb artistry and skill. Set should make some noise with classical collectors. TCHAIKOVSKY: The Nutcracker, Op. 71 Utah Symphony Orchestra conducted by 3Iaurice Ab- ravnel — V'anguard SRV 123 4 SD Maurice Abravanel and the Utah Symphony Or- chestra have turned in an adroit, beautifully-read performance of the complete “Nutcracker Ballet” in this two-record set from Vanguard. Conductor has captured the bright, lyrical spirit of the im- portant interwoven rhythms of this most difficult piece. All the color and festiveness that the music demands is reproduced. The Chorus of Utah adds an extra charming touch. Disk ranks as a superb rendition of “The Nutcracker.” “KEYBOARD GIANTS OF THE PAST\"— Vari- ous Artists — RCA Victor LM 2585 Reaching as far back as 1923, Victor has produced a varied collection of some outstanding piano pieces. Although this album only gives a taste of the various artists, and at times the fidelity is only passable, it ranks as a truly remarkable etching. Here the genius of Paderewski, Pach- mann and Lhevine are preserved for music lovers to appreciate and marvel at. The technical faults are completely overlooked in this memorable LP. ! t ; 1 34 RECORDS is proud to congratulate LAWRENCE THE NATION S NUMBER T and THE NATION S NUMBER T ORCHESTRA (IP S) (from the CASH BOX Year-End Survey) Casli Box — December 30, 1961 35 BIOS OF 1961'S LEADING ARTISTS r-, Bill Anderson — Decca Born in Columbia, S.C. and bred In Decatur, Ga. Bill Anderson completed his B.A. in Journal- ism, from the School of Journalism of the Uni- versity of Georgia. His first success in the music business was early in his high school career, when, as leader of his own high school band, he won the Avondale High School Talent Show, the band of course playing a song that Bill had writ- ten. He has a considerable amount of radio credits, on such stations as WBGE in Atlanta, WEAS in Decatur, and WQXI television in Atlanta. He has played many one night stands and dances throughout the country, and has been met every- where with tremendous enthusiasm. He has, in addition, been a DJ on various southern stations, and worked os sports writer for the DeKalb New Era, in Decatur and the Atlanta Constitution. His success as a songwriter was cemented when four different recording artists all had notable success with a Bill Anderson original, \"Xity Lights,\" and when, in 1958 the same song re- ceived the BMI award for the best song in the C&W field for 1958. As a recording artist, he has been enjoying hit after hit, starting with his first Decca release, \"That' What It’s Like To Be Lonesome.\" Others include \"Ninety Nine,** \"Walk Out Backwards,\" and \"Po’ Folks.\" His hobbies include song-writing, baseball, foot- ball and collecting records. Paul Anka — ABC-Paramount In 1960, when Paul Anka turned 18 and was of legal age to appear in nightclubs, an exciting and most important new phase of his young but sensational career was launched. Debuting his act at Las Vegas' Sahara to tumultuous acclaim, he moved on to New York’s Copa and came away with a record-breaking engagement. Dates In a Miami Beach hotel and other famed niteries are now permanent stops in his constant travels. Born on July 30, 1941 in Ottawa, Paul's big break came when he approached Don Costa, then A&R head for ABC-Paramount Records, with four songs he had written. Among them was \"Diana,\" which Costa and other AmPar execs felt Anka should record for them himself. It became a mil- lion-seller and launched the career of the young- ster. He has composed almost all of his hit sin- gles, is o solid LP seller and has an international acceptance with his recordings second to none. Ernest Ashworth — Decca Ernest Ashworth, made his first personal pro- fessional appearance in 1948 on Radio Station WLAC in Nashville, and has been going strong ever since. Born in Huntsville, Alabama, Ernest is one of five children. He decided on a musical career early in life, and taught himself to play the guitar at fifteen. He has appeared on practically all the major radio and TV stations in the South, and has made many appearances on the \"Grand Ole Opry\" and Ernest Tubb’s \"Midnight Jamboree.\" Besides sing- ing, Ernest is a prolific song writter, and his songs have been recorded by such top country artists os Carl Smith, Jimmy Dickens and Wilma Lee Cooper. The artist lives happily with his wife Elizabeth and three children in Huntsville, where he also works for Redstone Arsenal, in missile develop- ment work. He hopes someday to devote all his time to music and to become a regular member of the \"Opry.** In his spare time he enjoys hunting and fishing especially, and is constantly writing new songs. His Decca chart credits include \"You Can’t Pick A Rose In December,\" \"Forever Gone\" and \"Be Mine Again.** Hank Ballard & Midnighters — King The Midnighters, featuring Hank Ballard in the lead slot, rank as one of the most consistent, long- running hit-makers on the wax scene today. The fellas, who began as favorites in the rhythm & blues dept., have become equally as important in the pop category. Their fantastic string of King dual-mart chart winners includes \"Work With Me Annie,** \"Finger Poppin* Time,\" \"Sexy Ways,\" \"Annie Hod A Baby,\" \"Let’s Go Again,\" \"Let’s Go, Let’s Go, Let’s Co,\" \"Hoochie Coochle Coo,\" \"Teardrops On Your Letter\" and the coupler which was the very first version of today's dance sensation, \"The Twist.\" In addition, the fellas have turned out a host of money-making LP’s. Ballard, who makes Detroit his home town, is a baseball enthusiast and is quite prolific as a songwriter and arranger. Personal manager for the group is Ben Bart while the booking office is Universal Attractions. Harry Belafonte — RCA Victor Horry Belofonte has become one of the world’s best known artists as well as one of the world’s most dynomic and magnetic entertainers. He has that something extra that makes him a favorite of the masses. Born in N.Y.C., Harry moved to Jamaica, B.W.I., while a young boy. Then he returned to N.Y. to attend George Washington High School. After his discharge from the Navy he became a member of the American Negro The- atre Workshop and later joined the Dramatic Workshop where he developed his acting talents. Monte Kay heard Belafonte sing at a Workshop meeting and asked him if he would do the same “just for laughs\" at the Royal Roost, a club which Kay owned. Belafonte did and Kay signed him to a contract which ran 20 weeks. From this engagement, Harry went on to become a fairly successful pop singer. But not satisfied with crooning he quit the field and opened a restau- rant in N.Y.’s Greenwich Village. During informal songfests at his eatery, Harry discovered a love for folk songs, sought out his friend Millard Thomas (now his accompanist) and together they built a repertoire of folk songs and ballads. He signed a Victor contract and has since had one success after another. In films he starred in \"Bright Road,\" \"Carmen Jones\" and \"Island In The Sun.\" In 1955 he took Broadway by storm with \"Three For Tonight.\" His albums are con- tinually programmed by jockeys around the world. He has set attendance records everywhere and his TV appearances attract the highest ratings. There are few recording artists who rank with Bela- fonte. Brook Benton — Mercury To songster Brook Benton belongs the invalu- able asset of versatility. He can express himself with equal authority on material ranging from rhythmic teen-market numbers to ligit ballads, and, recently proven, to folk-like items (e.g. \"Boll Weevil\"). Benton’s career, two years as o hitmaker began in Camden, South Carolina, in a church choir di- rected by his father, and today he declares: \". . . of all the songs I’ve written and recorded, I’ve derived the most satisfaction from my album of spirituals, ‘If You Believe’.’’ At 17, he came to New York to seek his fortune as a songwriter, not a singer. Though success wasn’t sudden in story-book fashion, he eventually clicked through his association with publisher- writer Dave Dreyer, now Benton’s manager. To- gether, they wrote \"Looking Back,\""
