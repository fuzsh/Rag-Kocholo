        "text": "Ainsley Maitland-Niles was given an opportunity to impress in his natural position in the heart of midfield on Thursday night as Arsenal saw off Ostersund in the Europa League.\n\nHaving been used as a makeshift left-back on several occasions this season, Arsene Wenger gave the youngster the chance to play centrally alongside Mohamed Elneny in the heart of midfield.\n\nOur Arsenal writer Charles Watts kept a close eye on the 20-year-old at the Jamtkraft Arena - Here’s how he got on.\n\n0-15mins\n\nMaitland-Niles’ first real involvement was when Elneny was brushed aside by Saisu Gero in the the first few minutes. It looked threatening for a moment but Maitland-Niles showed good strength to get in front of the Ostersund forward who eventually brought him down, giving Arsenal the free-kick.\n\nThe young midfielder had clearly been given a bit more licence to roam than Elneny and was often up on the support of the forwards during the opening quarter of an hour.\n\n15-30mins\n\nOn 17 minutes Maitland-Niles drove forward out of midfield and looked like he was about to get a shot away. He opted for a pass, however, but slightly overhit the ball forcing Danny Welbeck wide.\n\nBut it was positive piece of play from the youngster who was looking very confident with the ball at his feet.\n\nArsenal were 1-0 up at this point and absolutely dominant, but on 25 minutes they had a slight scare when Shkodran Mustafi was closed down quickly by Gero deep inside the Arsenal half.\n\nMaitland-Niles was alert to the situation, however, and showed excellent recovery work to get back, win the ball and then give it back to Mustafi who cleared his lines.\n\n30-45mins\n\nThe first bad moment for Maitland-Niles came just after the half hour mark during Ostersund’s first real spell of pressure. He was caught napping by Samuel Mensah who robbed him of possession before racing towards the Arsenal area.\n\nBut Maitland-Niles did superbly to recover from his mistake, track Mensah down and win the ball back before the Ostersund man could get a shot away.\n\n45-60mins\n\nMaitland-Niles showed all his physical attributes with one exceptional run early in the second half, racing away from the Ostersund midfield who were trying to chase back.\n\nBut the midfielder had little support so when he got towards the penalty area he opted to turn back and his attempted pass for Ozil was poor and was cut out.\n\nIt was a passage play that demonstrated his strengths, but also a weakness when it comes to distribution and picking the right ball in the final third.\n\n60-75mins\n\nAfter Ozil had made it 3-0, Arsenal switched on cruise control for the final half an hour.\n\nMaitland-Niles just sat in the middle of the park, moving the ball around nicely and breaking up play when Ostersund attempted to break.\n\nHe produced one dart into the box which looked like it might result in a penalty, but the home side’s defence stayed on their feet and cleared the danger.\n\n75-90mins\n\nWith the game winding down, Arsene Wenger began to make some changes, with Kolasinac, Nketiah and Nelson coming on.\n\nMaitland-Niles will have been delighted by the fact he stayed on the pitch despite the substitutions, meaning he completed the full 90 minutes.\n\nHe cruised through the closing stages, completing a decent night’s work.\n\nThe verdict\n\nThis was a big night for Maitland-Niles, who has been desperate to get a chance in his natural position.\n\nGrant Xhaka has been struggling of late and the youngster will believe he has a chance of muscling the Swiss international out of the side if he can perform when given an opportunity.\n\nAnd he had some really good moments, demonstrating his impressive physical attributes on several occasions with some driving runs forward.\n\nOne of Maitland-Niles’ big attributes is his his ability to recover and win the ball back - his pace over the first five yards allows to him to chase down an opponent quickly.\n\nThat’s why Wenger has preferred him to Kolasinac at left-back this season and he showed how useful that asset can be in the heart of midfield.\n\nThe one thing he will need to improve, however, is decision making in the final third when he does get into attacking positions. His final ball was poor on occasion having got himself into a decent position.\n\nBut other than it was a good all round display from the midfielder."
