        "text": "Arsenal face a potentially tricky Europa League tie away at Ostersund on Thursday night.\n\nHere, Press Association Sport looks ahead to the main talking points ahead of the tie at the Jamtkraft Arena:\n\nBigger game for Wenger than he would have hoped\n\nArsenal eased through the Europa League group with little difficulty as Wenger utilised his squad in a competition that was seen as inferior in their targets compared to the Premier League and FA Cup.\n\nNow, however, the Gunners are a massive 27 points behind leaders Manchester City in the league and are struggling to make the top four while their ambitions of defending their FA Cup ended with a shock third-round exit at Nottingham Forest.\n\nThat means the Europa League now offers the most likely route back into the Champions League for Wenger and Arsenal, which is why a strong squad will be present on Thursday.\n\nPotter attempting to conjure up more magic\n\nThere has been much written about Ostersund's manager since the draw was made late last year.\n\nGraham Potter, a Midlander who played in defence for the likes of Birmingham, Stoke, Southampton and West Brom, has turned the Swedish side from lower-league minnows to top-flight cup winners.\n\nTheir Europa League adventure has included victories over established names such as Galatasaray, PAOK and Hertha Berlin and now they can add Arsenal to their ever-growing list of scalps.\n\nCan Gunners cope on the slopes?\n\nFreezing conditions will greet the Arsenal squad when they disembark from their aircraft at Ostersund Airport.\n\nAlthough not quite the -23oC of last month, it will still be a shock to the system - as will the compact stadium and artificial pitch.\n\nWenger is expected to bring some of his top names out to this Swedish outpost and their ability to adapt could prevent any embarrassments.\n\nHome boys given a chance to shine\n\nJamie Hopcutt and Curtis Edwards are not household names in their native England but the pair have become integral to Potter's plans at the Jamtkraft Arena.\n\nHopcutt, a 25-year-old midfielder, had unspectacular spells at York, Whitby, Ossett Town and Tadcaster before making the move to Scandinavia.\n\nMiddlesbrough-born Edwards had a similar adventure in England's lower leagues as he turned out for Darlington, Spennymoor and Thornaby.\n\nNow the duo can show they can cut it with the best that the Premier League has to offer as they aim to play their part in a major upset.\n\nWelbeck to be given rare opportunity to impress\n\nWith club-record signing Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang cup-tied and summer recruit Alexandre Lacazette injured, the chances are that Danny Welbeck will lead the line for Arsenal.\n\nThe former Manchester United man has struggled with injuries since his move to the Emirates Stadium but could now play his part in making sure the Gunners advance in Europe.\n\nWith Theo Walcott, Alexis Sanchez and Olivier Giroud leaving in the January window, Welbeck is now one of Arsenal's established attacking players and the England international will be desperate to grasp his opportunity if it arises."
