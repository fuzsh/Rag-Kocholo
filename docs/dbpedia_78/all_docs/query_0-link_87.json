We will be in St Pete for between the 4th until till 11th of July and are planning to see a Devil Ray game.\n\nThey are playing against both the Red...",

        "text": "Well, you may have lots of competition for tickets if you want to see the Devil Ray's play either the Red Sox or the Yankees; they are the hardest visiting teams to see and get good seats for. Either team will be good to see, but it will be a matter of getting tickets at all and they will cost you more money (premium games they are called).\n\nYes, you can sit in the outfield, but you won't be able to see much from there. If you can get tickets on the first or third base side, those will be better. You'll be less likely to be hit by batted balls in the outfield, so if that's a concern, you may choose there anyway. However, you will need binochulars to see the game well.\n\nYou may have no choice in your seating, but look at a seating chart on the internet at the address below:\n\nhttp://tampabay.devilrays.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/tb/ballpark/seating_pricing.jsp\n\nGet cheap seats on 'the beach' - you wont get hit there. Look for the coupons in the local Tampa Tribune or the St Petes paper. pParking is free on Trop this year.\n\nDo NOT worry about getting hit by the ball I have tried since they got the franchise to take home a ball that I have fielded -- but so far I have not been within 5 rows of the bloody things landing. The outfielders always throw the balls to the annoying little kids who already have about twenty of em. I follow every game, travel thousand of miles, wear the magnificant kit with pride - and pesky little Kyle from Wisconsin always get there before me.\n\nI put my Welsh Dragon flag over the seat and they asked me what part of Canada I came from.\n\nBeing married to a life-long member of the Red Sox Nation(born and raised in Boston), I have to go with the Red Sox games. :-) I don't think I'm even allowed to type the name of that other team you mentioned. ;-)\n\nI think your boys would like the outfield best because they can see the whole game field and might even catch a ball! If you get to the game while they are warming up, you can let the boys wander over near the dugouts and see if they can get an autograph.\n\nHave a great time!\n\nP.S. You also might want to check the score of last nights game of the Red Sox vs the you-know-whos....I won't gloat but WE WON!!! We smacked the you-know-whos butt last night...Hee Hee\n\nif you wait until you are in Tampa you can get the coupons out of the locals papers. The Rays to a 2 for 1 offer on Tuesdays out of the Tampa Tribune. It's best to have a look online or go to the rays web site to check out the offers. We have always got in on an offer even the big games like red sox and nyy.\n\nWe went to see them play Toronto it was a poor attendance and in the right field there only looked to be about 250 people spread thru all the seats.\n\nThat night I had to get a ball. Anyway every fly ball went to the other side of the arena for hours on end. Then Aubrey Huff smacked one towards me. I immediately went into slow motion as this thing hurtled towards me at a thousand miles per hour. Do I try to catch or dive for cover. I throw down the drink and programme and go for it. No glove of course - I am a Brit. The ball rockets towards me and goes just over my head into the vacant seats. I see that it is a race between me and 'Kyle the kid'. Now I am not a brit who enjoys coming second in anything so I will use anything, any dirty cheating trick to get that ball. Kyle is dead meat. I am going to look like a monster in front of these sports fans and beat this nine year old to the ball.\n\nOf course he went like a rat up a drainpipe along the back of the seats and seemed to go underground as the ball came out of the pin ball machine that was the plastic seating and straight into his huge Wilson Glove. I applauded him like the rest of the crowd and would also cheerfully wrung his Wisconsin neck."
