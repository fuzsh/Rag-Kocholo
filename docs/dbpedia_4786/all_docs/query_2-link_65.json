        "text": "We're less than 90 days away from the start of the 2024 Football season! Washington will host Weber State on August 31st, and to count down the days to kickoff we've decided to take a look at the players that have worn the jerseys of each day in question.\n\nWhen he was playing tight end for Washington, Joe Toledo wore the number 83 and represented it well. Coming out of La Costa Canyon High School in Carlsbad, California, the 6'5\", 250 pound prospect was a great athlete, lettering in three sports (football, baseball, basketball) and finished his prep career with 75 receptions for 1,792 yards and 19 touchdowns as a tight end on offense and 51 tackles and five sacks as a defensive end.\n\nHe had offers from most of the Pac 12 and several other schools in the west, but chose Washington and went on to play in 32 games with 23 starts after redshirting in 2001. He played his first 26 games as a tight end and totaled 27 receptions for 291 yards and two touchdowns, but he struggled with injuries, including bulging discs, that limited his effectiveness.\n\nToledo eventually made the move to tackle for his senior season and started six games (three at left tackle and three at right tackle) after bulking up to over 300 pounds.\n\nEven though he had only played six games at the position, his athleticism and size were too much for the Miami Dolphins to pass up and they selected him in the fourth round (114th overall) but again injuries limited his effectiveness and he bounced around the league for five seasons, playing with six NFL clubs during that time.\n\nDevin Culp wound up as one of the key components of Husky teams that went 25-3 (2022 and 2023), won a conference title, two bowl games, including the only Sugar Bowl in program history, while also playing in the National Championship Game. In 2021, Culp was the primary backup behind starter Cade Otton and then he shared reps with Jack Westover his final two seasons and finished his career with 66 receptions for 711 yards and four touchdowns.\n\nHe had several memorable catches throughout his career including a key catch in a narrow win at Arizona, but none were bigger than this one against USC in a thrilling 52-42 late-season win in 2023.\n\nCulp was selected in the seventh round (246th overall) by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the 2024 NFL Draft.\n\nMarlon Wood was an explosive receiver and kick returner coming out of Pasadena Junior College and he made a quick impact at Washington although it took until the the end of his second season on campus before he found the endzone.\n\nAs a kick returner, Wood had three kick returns for over 85 yards during his time at Washington, but didn't score. He also had a 69-yard catch and run against Notre Dame, but also didn't find the endzone.\n\nHis lone score was his acrobatic 40-yard grab on a hail-mary pass from Carl Bonnell that helped Washington tie their game against Cal, in Berkeley, as regulation expired in 2006. Unfortunately, Cal scored and the Huskies were unable to match and that's when Cal tailback Marshawn Lynch famously hopped in the field cart and drove around celebrating following the game."
