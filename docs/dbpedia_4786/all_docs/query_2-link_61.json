Currently, only seven judges handle all of the state’s civil and criminal trial-level cases. Despite the growing number of Coloradans, Congress has not increased the number of judges since 1984, the op-ed says. The understaffed, overloaded District Court may face a greater change if the number of full-time judges drops to six. According to the op-ed, U.S. District Judge Robert Blackburn announced he will be taking senior status starting in April 2016. The op-ed was written by Dave Montez, executive director of One Colorado Education Fund. He notes that Colorado’s two U.S. senators “have each created separate screening committees that do not appear to be planning to work together.” Montez also advocates for diversity on the bench, saying the judicial vacancy “provides an opportunity for our senators to select candidates who reflect the diversity of our state.”\n\nEDUCATION\n\nCategorize the news article into one of the 17 categories: COMMUNITY & LIFESTYLE CULTURE & ARTS EDUCATION ENTERTAINMENT ENVIRONMENT & ANIMALS FASHION & STYLE FINANCE & BUSINESS FOOD & DRINK LAW & CRIME MEDIA OTHERS POLITICS RELIGION SCIENCE & TECH SPORTS TRAVEL WORLD NEWS\n\nThe first phase of the Penang Transport Master Plan (PTMP), involving the construction of the LRT project,” is scheduled to take off in the first half of 2017. State local government, traffic management, and flood mitigation committee chairman Chow Kon Yeow said the design and the alignment of the LRT would be finalised next year. He was stressing on the issue during the Penang Master Builders & Materials Dealers Association (PMBBMDA) 138th anniversary celebration. Chow said the Gamuda-led SRS Consortium would submit the plan which included the reclamation aspects of the project to the local authorities for approval. “The consortium would also be applying to the Federal authorities for the licence to do the LRT in Penang. “No licence means the LRT project will not take off,” he said. The SRS Consortium is a triumvirate joint venture of Gamuda Berhad, Ideal Property Development Sdn Bhd and Loh Phoy Yen Holdings Sdn, appointed as the Project Delivery Partner (PDP) for the RM27bil Penang Transport Master Plan (PTMP) projects. On the request from PMBBMDA to obtain jobs to be generated from the PTMP implementation, Chow said he would arrange a dialogue between SRS Consortium and PMBBMDA on the matter. The PTMP is a massive effort to create new road networks, improve present carriageways and the pedestrian ecosystem. This also includes significantly upgrading the public transport system by introducing new transport options including trams, a mass rapid transit (MRT) system and water taxis. - By The Star\n\nOTHERS\n\nCategorize the news article into one of the 17 categories: COMMUNITY & LIFESTYLE CULTURE & ARTS EDUCATION ENTERTAINMENT ENVIRONMENT & ANIMALS FASHION & STYLE FINANCE & BUSINESS FOOD & DRINK LAW & CRIME MEDIA OTHERS POLITICS RELIGION SCIENCE & TECH SPORTS TRAVEL WORLD NEWS\n\nJudge orders Kim Davis to jail for holding up marriage licenses: \"The Kentucky county clerk citing religious reasons for refusing to issue marriage licenses was jailed for contempt of court.

(Possibly* half of this fell in one deluge on 24 August when the town centre flooded quite notably from intense rainfall falling in a few hours (see post below)). [gallery size=\"large\" type=\"square\" ids=\"10879,10876,10870\"] [caption id=\"attachment_10988\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"660\"] South East England rainfall August 2015: 177% of long term average[/caption] Across SE England the MetOffice official records showed the rainfall total of 103mm was 177% of the August 1961-1990 long term average, so nearly double the usual totals (100% being the average monthly total for August in this case). Don't forget that August is often a wet month and that August 2014 had 84mm. If you think our Summers are getting cooler and wetter then, well, yes you'd be right! Read on to find out more. [gallery type=\"rectangular\" ids=\"10954,10955,10956\"] The mean 500mb pressure pattern for August above shows a deep trough in the Atlantic, dug unusually far to the south for the time of year, and a continuation of the dominant high pressure over Europe from July, nudged further east maintaining the heat wave in Europe. This looks like it should have promised a hot August with an average upper flow from the south and a surface mean flow from the SE. Unfortunately this pattern did not deliver any heat of note, but it did deliver occasional heavy showers and some thunderstorms. Despite the average southerly and SE flow bringing occasional thundery Spanish Plumes, the real heat stayed stubbornly on the continent and only fleetingly wafted temperatures exceeding 25C across the SE. While France regularly baked in 30C+ daytime heat, Reigate and the SE could only struggle to Tmax temperatures of 25C and only once nudged 30C. Notably, the mean temperature was a tad below the 1981-2010 average but above the 1961-1990 average, showing how recent decades have been warmer. So August was either above or below the long term average, depending on what LTA you choose. This is a small example of how weather statistics can be presented by the media to suit any argument regarding climate change. [gallery type=\"rectangular\" ids=\"10959,10958\"] The August monthly Central England Temperature (CET) came out at 0.1C above the long term average but this hides the cooler than average Tmax attained in a disappointing month. This again illustrates how headline figures hide many subtle interpretations of weather statistics. Overall, August was nearly average from the perspective of long term Central England Temperatures, with the East coming out slightly above average compared with a cooler West. Maximum temperatures were widely lower than usual for August. [gallery type=\"rectangular\" ids=\"10957,10962,10973\"] At 116.4 hours, sunshine was also only average or a tad below the 1961-1990 average. [caption id=\"attachment_10964\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"607\"] sunshine duration August 2015[/caption] On average the greatest rainfall totals experienced in Reigate are brought by southerly winds. This makes sense because mean southerly winds are from warm source regions, travelling across Biscay and the Channel, and are frequently associated with humid warm sectors that precede fronts where heavy thundery showers can occur. [gallery size=\"large\" ids=\"10983,10981,10982\"] Our more frequent prevailing Westerly / SW winds associated with frontal rain often peters out before reaching the South East as they dump most rain in the western hills of the UK, whereas warm southerly winds containing more water vapour arrive laden with precipitable water (PWAT) ripe for torrential downpours across the SE. The Downs (North and especially the South Downs) can also have a marked orographic effect enhancing this southerly rainfall pattern, whereas they have little impact on frontal rain from the west. [gallery type=\"rectangular\" ids=\"10960,10963,10972\"] Finally, research shows that UK Summers have got cooler and considerably wetter since 2000. Cooler by just 0.4C (this despite some warm years) but total summer precipitation has increased by some 50mm over the last 15 years. [caption id=\"attachment_10980\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"660\"] Reigate summers have got cooler and wetter since 2000[/caption] *Rainfall totals are proving tricky to verify at the moment. We use three sites for measuring rainfall locally: an automatic tipping bucket rain gauge at RGS, a manual CoCoRaHs rain gauge at the same site and a local sister site in town. Unfortunately they rarely agree and sometimes vary quite considerably. Also, the manual rain gauge is used to measure monthly totals because emptying it everyday (during the holidays for example) is not always possible. Calibration of the AWS and regular rain gauge measurements is therefore an immediate target. Meanwhile, all rainfall figures are available on request and posted in these summaries.

Aside from studying, you can find Bahreini practicing to maintain his reputation as one of the most successful runners to ever attend OCU. “It’s great to know I’ve set a high bar for the OCU program,” Bahreini said. Bahreini wasn’t always a runner. Bahreini started out playing soccer as a child and as he began middle school his mom signed him up for cross country to help his endurance. He ended up winning a medal in his first race and participated in both sports until high school. As high school began, Bahreini had to make a choice between soccer and cross country. “I fell in love with running,” Bahreini said. “The endorphin rush from running or seeing the self-improvement.” Choosing cross country opened a lot of doors for him, Bahreini said. He’s met some of his best friends, bettered himself and has even had the chance to travel to Jamaica and represent the junior USA team competing against other countries. Bahreini had no offers to run cross country at the college level until his senior year when he ran a 5K, in 15 minutes and 42 seconds. Bahreini now prefers to run anything above a 5K. Bahreini chose OCU due to the small class sizes, scholarship opportunities and his coach, Conor Holt. “Aside from being a good runner, he is a big leader of our team,” said Reno Blum, exercise science senior and team captain. “He’s probably the hardest working person I know.” Bahreini and the OCU cross country team hope to make both OCU and NAIA history this year by becoming three-time national champions.

It is not at all clear to me what \"sustainable\" or \"less than 20% chance of debt-distress\" really mean. The interest-rate configuration now is so weird that I do not see how debt sustainability benchmarks constructed for what we used to see as normal times can be useful. READ MOAR The German ten-year bund rate has been below the eurozone's inflation target for more than four years now. The U.S. thirty-year Treasury rate has been below projected U.S. nominal GDP growth for more than eight years now. It is usually the case that, as the late Michael Mussa used to say, debt sustainability analyses are of the nature of: \"if... if... if... as they would say where I grew up: 'if my grandmother had wheels, she would be a bus'.\" That is overwhelmingly the case now. So I think we need to go back to basics. Rather than picking up sustainability benchmarks built for a different global macroeconomic situation. I want to see what is assumed with respect to: what the yield premium over the German benchmark is. when the German benchmark is expected to normalize. what the German benchmark is expected to normalize to. how fast the real principal is expected to be paid down. what share of GDP can be expected to be devoted to debt service and amortization.\n\nEDUCATION\n\nCategorize the news article into one of the 17 categories: COMMUNITY & LIFESTYLE CULTURE & ARTS EDUCATION ENTERTAINMENT ENVIRONMENT & ANIMALS FASHION & STYLE FINANCE & BUSINESS FOOD & DRINK LAW & CRIME MEDIA OTHERS POLITICS RELIGION SCIENCE & TECH SPORTS TRAVEL WORLD NEWS\n\nIt was a Tuesday Morning I was outside the book store where Tiny Tot Story Time happens A lovely lady came to also wait, the store was a little late opening.

Maybe having a democratic republic begins to sound a bit better... But I believe that the main reason that there was a revolution against the new king just a few days after Ahmad died – on this date in 1962 – is because Ahmad had made Yemen an enemy of Egypt. It was Egyptian soldiers who fought alongside nationalist forces to overthrow the king. Sigh. I SO wanted Yemen to be a bit of democracy on the Arabian Peninsula, but in actual fact, the Republic of Yemen has seen civil war, corruption, abductions, torture, terrorist attacks, and rebellions! It's pretty much a mess... We are warned NOT to travel to Yemen right now because of all the violence. So let's, instead, enjoy the beauties of the country in the comfort of our own homes: The Shahara Bridge was created in the 1600s to connect towns at the tops of two mountains. It's super scary – but locals cross it often every day. These weird-looking “umbrella” trees seep red sap and are therefore called dragon's blood trees. They are found on Socotra Island, which belongs to Yemen. Also on Socotra Island, this tree is pretty ugly...for a tree! But if you get an entire group of the “ugly” trees – and they look pretty darned cool. I love this “rock palace,” found in Wadi Dhar.

Orbit House was built on the site in the 1960s before it too was demolished and replaced by Will Alsop’s Palestra building. I recently came across a photograph of a family eating a meal outside the broken shell of Sayer Street School, which was bombed during the blitz. It stood out, because Sayer Street no longer exists. This was once a long road of shops – a fishmonger, cat-meat dealer, grocer, saddler, bookbinder – and solid, five-storey tenements in Elephant & Castle. When the blitz began, the street was hit by several bombs. What happened next to Sayer Street encapsulates several aspects of the waves of development that continue to shape London – and the central role played by the bomb sites of the blitz 75 years after the first explosions. In the immediate aftermath of the war, Sayer Street was used as a car park. This was a popular use for bomb sites: indeed, the NCP car park empire began with the £200 purchase of a bomb site on Red Lion Square. Then, in the 1960s, the remaining residents were turfed out as Sayer Street was demolished, chewed up by the Heygate Estate – a council housing development that was originally conceived as one of three gigantic estates stretching from Elephant to Peckham, linked by walkways and ramps for two miles. “These plans were incredibly radical, sweeping away neighbourhoods irrespective of damage and replacing them with high-rise towers nobody wanted to live in,” says Peter Larkham, professor of planning at Birmingham School of the Built Environment. The Heygate was bleak, poorly built and badly maintained, but it housed many of London’s poorest.

The 2016 Competition Edition stands for exceptional individuality, paintwork colors, BMW Individual components made of high-tech carbon fiber, fine leathers with coordinated contrast stitching and a range of unusual details. Limited to 100 units in the US, the Competition Edition is available exclusively for the BMW M6 Coupe with the further honed Competition Package and with a BMW M Performance Driving Center Experience Voucher. The 2016 Competition Package has also been released for three model variants: 2016 BMW M6 Coupe, BMW M6 Grand Coupe and the BMW M6 Convertible. Defined by outstanding performance, the three model variants are powered by a 4.4 liter V8 BMW M TwinPower Turbo technology producing 600 bHP with a power boost increasing peak torque from 500 lb-ft to 516 lb-ft delivered between an extremely wide rev band of 1,500 and 6,000 rpm. The increased power, dynamics and handling is owed to the same principles applied to BMW M vehicles: the chassis technology is tuned precisely to the performance characteristics of the powertrain. Firmer tuning of the springs, dampers and anti-roll bars increase stability, reduce roll and result in a higher level of steering precision. The BMW M6 Coupe Competition Edition model comes with a choice of two exterior paintwork colors: dazzling Alpine White and luminous Austin Yellow metallic. In Alpine White, the BMW M6 Coupe Competition Edition features striking decorative bodywork stripes in the trademark BMW M colors, as will also be displayed on the new BMW M6 GT3 race car. Forming an attractive contrast, customers can choose between 20-inch light alloy Double Spoke M wheels with performance tires and 20-inch light alloy Double Spoke M wheels with forged black with performance tires. An M Performance Exhaust with carbon fiber tailpipes compliments the sportier design. Along with the BMW kidney grille, door handles and side gills in black chrome and the carbon-fiber exterior mirror caps, they accentuate the extraordinarily sporty and powerful presence of the car. The carbon-fiber M rear spoiler and rear diffuser optimize airflow for increased dynamics. In the interior, BMW Individual fine-grain Merino full leather in black with contrast stitching – available in Opal White with Alpine White paintwork and in Yellow with Austin Yellow metallic paintwork – highlights the car’s exclusive sporty ambience. “M6 Competition” lettering in metal on the door sills and in the side gill elements, along with the lettering on the cupholder lids, is a further signature feature of the Edition model. The interior trim strips, gear selector and M sports steering wheel spokes are made from fine, lightweight carbon fiber, while the steering wheel rim is lined with elegant Alcantara leather. M multifunction seats for the driver and front passenger, the BMW Head-Up Display and Harman Kardon Surround Sound System or High-End Surround Sound System by Bang & Olufsen with 16 speakers and output of 1,200 watts are also part of the equipment range. To experience the special BMW M vehicle performance dynamics on the track, M6 Competition Edition customers will receive a Performance Center Voucher upon delivery. The coupon provides each owner with a special opportunity to visit the BMW Performance Center Driving School of their liking for an exclusive half-day instructor led driving experience. Limited to 120 units worldwide and 100 in the U.S., the BMW M6 Competition Edition is available at selected retailers for $164,900 plus Destination and Handling.

You can figure out latitude with a sextant, but not longitude. Early clocks used pendulums that don't work on a rocking boat. So in the 1700's the British government offered up £20,000 for a reliable clock that would work at sea. John Harrison designed a really accurate ocean-worthy clock after 31 years of effort and was snubbed for the prize which would be £2.8 Million at today's value.

When I wrote today’s Post subtitle, I immediately had two thoughts, a) Readers are going to misunderstand and respond by saying, ‘aww, don’t feel bad, we all think you’re doing great’ and 2) I really need to get back to this kind of post, one that is written to the clarks who are encountering the Wakefield Doctrine for the very first time. And, of course , c) my own re-appreciation of how much things have changed since I first started writing this blog… not the content and nature of the Doctrine, rather the nature of the readership and, even more germane, the changes the Wakefield Doctrine has wrought in my own self. So, what say I give it try?) When I was young(er), I retained an unshakeable faith in two things: a) my friends and b) my capacity to endure and survive. Now I am no longer younger. More to the point, (of this post), I am now possessed of an understanding of my predominant worldview ( clark /Outsider) and that enables me to see a lot more of the ‘why’ of my behavior and beliefs, actions and responses to the people and the world around me. This is an improvement. This knowledge, this insight into the way that ‘I relate myself to the world around me’, does not, in and of itself, change anything. It does, however, make any desired change much more attainable and sustainable. That is the good of the knowing of the Wakefield Doctrine. The title today? (And the introduction above, that suggests that perhaps writing a Post to appeal specifically to the brand new clarklike Reader, might be more difficult than I think?) All of what underlies, and thereby giving rise to the sentiment manifested in the subtitle remains true in me, in all clarks . I still have the …. er …. not so positive self-concept that is the initial premise shaping the worldview of the Outsider, and I still, very much value the friends that I have. Most of us, (including rogers and scotts ), will recognize, in the second half of the sub-title an implication, a… ‘yes but’, a ‘hedge’, if you will, on the claim to being valued by others. There is something to the way the statement sounds that is a hallmark of the clarklike personality type. It’s necessary to a clark, this ‘hedging’ of a claim of self-worth or value (to others), a pre-defensive defensive, if you will. You want a physical example of what I’m trying to convey? (It’s also a primary characteristic of clarks .) Watch a clark smile. Most of time, especially when ‘in public’ or not in a totally secure environment, which is pretty much everywhere except bed or the bathroom, clarks will smile by compressing the lips, putting a slight upwards motion to the corners of the mouth, while watching the other person very carefully. Hedging their bets. Being careful. Keeping the escape route viable. You know, as an Outsider, we’re all about interacting, all while keeping an eye on the door. Find me a classroom, I don’t care if it’s First Grade or Grad School, if the individual student is allowed the choice of seats, you will find a preponderance of clarks in the back row. Near the door. And while one might think that this choice is simply to avoid being noticed, one would be almost correct. It is, in fact, to provide the option to escape, to not be forced into the focus of attention. That’s part of what the clark personality is like. Tomorrow we may look at scotts, ( ‘ I think, therefore I scream ‘) or perhaps rogers (‘ there is no ‘i’ in herd, there’s only me and everyone like me’ ) Since I’m doing kind of a old-style Post, I thought I’d include a music video, well, just because.* Click here to view the embedded video. *excuse me!! excuse me!! because, well, holy shit!! (lol) you want to know the real, totally-honest-to-god reason why I find writing Doctrine Posts so ….so incredible? Ok, so I’m finishing up the final edit and I decide… sure, lets keep the music vid, because I love the song. The last thing I needed to do was to find the ‘cover photo’, you know, the Post’s thumbnail that shows only on the landing page. Well I think, ‘lets look for an image associated with Grieg and ‘the Hall of the Mountain King’, (today’s vid)…at the top of the results page is a link to the wikipedia, so naturally I go to read it ( I’m a clark , remember?) anyway, here’s what jumped out of the screen at me, it made me laugh: The piece is played as the title character Peer Gynt, in a dream-like fantasy, enters “Dovregubben (the troll Mountain King)’s hall”. The scene’s introduction continues: “There is a great crowd of troll courtiers, gnomes and goblins. Dovregubben sits on his throne, with crown and sceptre, surrounded by his children and relatives. Peer Gynt stands before him. There is a tremendous uproar in the hall.” The lines sung are the first lines in the scene. Grieg himself wrote “For the Hall of the Mountain King I have written something that so reeks of cowpats, ultra-Norwegianism, and ‘to-thyself-be-enough-ness’ that I can’t bear to hear it, though I hope that the irony will make itself felt.” The theme of “to thyself be… enough” – avoiding the commitment implicit in the phrase “To thine own self be true” and just doing enough – is central to Peer Gynt’s satire, and the phrase is discussed by Peer and the mountain king in the scene which follows the piece .( italics added) ( wikipedia.com ) …no!! really!! lol man! do I love this Wakefield Doctrine!

If that happens, it will be a multi-level failure for each of the parties. At the top -- the leaders. If none of them ultimately move the needle it will mean that each of them is a failure when it comes to retail politics. The next level responsible will be the campaign. Badly thought out, and even executed worse than that. And finally, the war room crowd who are supposed to define quickly the enemy and more importantly, make it stick. If they remain bunched up come election day, this campaign will leave us with failed candidates, strategists and assorted operatives. Out of that mess, some way, somehow, will come Canada's next government. Remember that all of them are only as good as their last win.\n\nPOLITICS\n\nCategorize the news article into one of the 17 categories: COMMUNITY & LIFESTYLE CULTURE & ARTS EDUCATION ENTERTAINMENT ENVIRONMENT & ANIMALS FASHION & STYLE FINANCE & BUSINESS FOOD & DRINK LAW & CRIME MEDIA OTHERS POLITICS RELIGION SCIENCE & TECH SPORTS TRAVEL WORLD NEWS\n\nWith experience, great designers and top minds, motorbikes and machinery. Encapsulating Italian-made goods in a single piece of work is no easy task. Three Italian companies – Ducati, Odone Marmi and Breton – have come together to create “Fortitudo mea in levitate” (“Lightness is my strength”). Ducati (Ducati Motor Holding S.p.A.) Italy’s most world-famous motorcycle manufacturer. A company that still amazes us, even after 90 years, with its products of peerless style and performance. Design Uniqueness Craftsmanship Attention to detail Technology Italian verve Odone Marmi Master stone and marble workers since 1950, from planning and design through to production and installation. Breton Research, innovation and technology in machines for working marble, granite and natural and engineered stone. What is “Fortitudo mea in levitate”? It is a sculpture in white Carrara marble designed by Gianandrea Fabbro, Chief Designer at the Ducati Style Centre, depicting one of the company’s most recognisable models, the Panigale. His refined designer’s pencil has given the world the Panigale 1199 and 1299 and now this splendid marble sculpture, an award-winner at Milan Design Week 2015. It was made by Odone Marmi using a Breton Shapemill. The work was displayed in central Milan for over a week in April, drawing huge admiring crowds outside Audi City Lab in Via Monte Napoleone, at the pulsating heart of the city’s fashion district. Many people wondered how this gem of technology and craftsmanship could have been made. Today’s machining centres with 5 interpolated axes can create highly complex forms with different materials, including marble and granite, to bring designers’ creativity to life. The most innovative Italian workshops, such as Angelo Odone’s, choose this kind of machine to turn marble and granite blocks into unique objects, avant-garde furnishing pieces, and veritable works of art. The Vercelli-based company produced the sculpture for Ducati. “Fortitudo mea in levitate” could only have been made using a Breton Shapemill, the \"Ducati\" of 5-axis machining and shaping centres for marble and granite, the queen of speed and precision. This machining centre’s impressive performance supports multiple work processes that would otherwise require several machines. Working with various tools, it can mill, turn and perform routing through its shaped tools. Here is the official video: The Ducati designer and his design, the Odone Marmi factory’s trademark craftsmanship, and Breton technology are the ingredients in a breathtaking work that emphasises the contrast between the lightness of the forms and the weight of the hefty Carrara marble blocks. In other words, it is a true celebration of Italian-made excellence. That’s all for today. Thank you for reading. Until next time. Bye-bye.

Nikki chose this one for us, and it's perfectly timed with Spring starting this week. I love Spring. I'm a bit rusty as it's been a good six weeks since I played in my craft room (packing and moving house and all that). What I had in my head didn't really come out on paper the same way. I white heat embossed a bunch of PTI flowers and coloured them with my Zig Clean Colour Real Brush Markers. The colours were really vibrant and bright whilst wet. Unfortunately once dry they had toned down quite a bit. Still pretty but not as bright as I'd planned. A little sponging, some spritzing and a few sequins and blingy bits.... It's been pouring rain here again the past couple of days, not complaining as I put a few tomato plants in the garden yesterday. I'm thinking it's going to be a good day to play with some of my new goodies from the Holiday Catalogue. Have you seen it yet? If you go to the right hand sidebar you'll find a link. If you'd like to join the JAI challenge this week, here is the inspiration pic for you. Need a little direction? Pop over to look at the design team inspiration and let your imagination run wild. We're off to a mad hatter/steam punk themed 40th birthday party tomorrow night. Good grief! Yep I had to google the latter...obviously I don't get out much because steam punk seems to be quite popular, and I really had no clue. More on the party next post :) Have a great weekend!\n\nENTERTAINMENT\n\nCategorize the news article into one of the 17 categories: COMMUNITY & LIFESTYLE CULTURE & ARTS EDUCATION ENTERTAINMENT ENVIRONMENT & ANIMALS FASHION & STYLE FINANCE & BUSINESS FOOD & DRINK LAW & CRIME MEDIA OTHERS POLITICS RELIGION SCIENCE & TECH SPORTS TRAVEL WORLD NEWS\n\nInternational Journal of Information Technology, Modeling and Computing (IJITMC) ISSN : 2320-7493 (Online) ; 2320 - 8449 (Print) http://airccse.org/journal/ijitmc/index.html Scope & Topics The International Journal of Information Technology, Modeling and Computing (IJITMC) is an open access peer-reviewed journal that publishes articles which contribute new results in all areas of Information Technology, Modeling and Computing.

The best we could achieve was parity, a ratio of one pound sown to one pound harvested, and we were almost celebratory about that pathetic achievement, seeing it as a hopeful sign. Most efforts failed even this slight measure of hope. The adzuki in the field. Indigenous to tropical Africa and Asia, this genus of legumes has a complex of vernacular names, including field peas, cow peas, chickpeas, southern peas, mung, dal, gram and adzuki. They have a distinct gamy flavor relative to the garden beans. They were also one of the original \"beans,\" along with the fava, of southern Europe—a character in Annibale Carracci's classic 'Mangiafagioli' (~1585) was tucking into a bowl of black-eyed peas, not the American garden beans we associate with Italians today. Fresh adzuki. Many plants have highly sensitive biochemical chronometers which trigger various functions such as growth, dormancy and flowering according to the dark period of the day. Plants with this requirement are called photoperiodic, and field peas possess that characteristic. In some crops agricultural cultivars have been selected for a very tight photoperiod. For example, onions and cabbage are not useful if they go to flower, or bolt, willy nilly. In Oregon, crops adapted to southern latitudes do not set flower until the nights lengthen in August or September, and there is not enough time to set and ripen their fruits. This is why okra, limas and field peas are not successful at this latitude, and as yet have no commercial cultivars suitable for Oregon. We have wasted a great deal of time and treasure on all three; hope springs eternal. Experimenting with other crops gave us an appreciation of the challenges farming at the 45th parallel. One of the fascinating entries in the Tokyo Foundation is about Longfellow flint corn originating in New England that is grown on the island of Hokkaido. The northern part of the island lies on the 45th, which is why that variety grew well. We realized we needed to understand the crops of the island better, and that led to our Hokkaido Project. Both soy and adzukis are grown on Hokkaido, so we started trying varieties from the prefecture. Adzukis are the one Vigna, or field pea, that has commercial potential here in Oregon. We are also working on two traditional soy varieties, more on that later. Fresh adzuki ready for market. Initially, adzukis didn't sell well. We had licked the biology only to confront a marketing challenge. Despite the hesitant reaction, four customers gave us the spine to plant more. Mio Asaka (Mio's Delectables) and Naoko Tamura (Chef Naoko) used them in a traditional Japanese way as red bean paste. Last winter, David Sapp of Park Kitchen asked us if we could suggest one of our beans as a substitute for black-eyed peas in Hoppin' John. A light bulb lit up and we suggested using the adzukis. We warned him they are different, but of a kind, whereas the other beans we grow are definitely not of that kind. He was happy with the result, and encouraged us to plant more. Sarah Minnick was the other person who brought them into her kitchen with a variation on their traditional use in sweets; at Lovely's 50/50 they ended up ice cream. A couple of weeks ago we got the idea that perhaps adzukis would be tasty as fresh shelled beans. We asked people who might know and poked about a bit online, but no one seems to share our idea. Then again, no one had ever suggested grinding popcorn and cooking it for polenta, or steeping it in slack lime for hominy, so there is no harm in trying an unshared notion. Bear in mind there are a host of ideas that have been discretely buried and forgotten in the Ayers Creek compost pile as well. As it turns out, fresh shelled adzukis make a tasty dish, just like one of the southern peas. Not quite the perfection of a Lady pea, but up there with next tier field peas. We will have some at market this week, a one-time event, and then you all will have to wait for the dried adzukis.\n\nFOOD & DRINK\n\nCategorize the news article into one of the 17 categories: COMMUNITY & LIFESTYLE CULTURE & ARTS EDUCATION ENTERTAINMENT ENVIRONMENT & ANIMALS FASHION & STYLE FINANCE & BUSINESS FOOD & DRINK LAW & CRIME MEDIA OTHERS POLITICS RELIGION SCIENCE & TECH SPORTS TRAVEL WORLD NEWS\n\nheyyy~ive been researching the different naked eye palettes and I still can't decide which one to get.I'm asian, with double eyelids and fairly big eyes.

The total time needed to play the entire game, from the first blow of a whistle to the final buzz of the scoreboard, came in at less than two hours, and that included a full-length halftime break. The Bulldogs, who improved to 3-1 on the season, were utterly dominant on the night of Sept. 18, scoring seemingly at will on their opponents while amassing just 12 yards shy of four times as much total offensive yardage as the host squad. Though Freeport went on to blank the Buccaneers 26-0, the visiting squad didn’t run up the score and instead adopted a strategy of getting out ahead with the starters before switching in some JV players to get valuable on-field experience in the fourth quarter. Freeport’s individual players didn’t need to put up huge numbers to make significant contributions, but some players usually reserved for special roles got their chance to shine in the one-sided contest. Austin Vinson, typically relied on when the team needs to bulldoze a way through the opposing team’s defense, led the Bulldogs with 53 rushing yards on five open-field carries, while freshman Ashton Saults got one heck of a varsity debut, adding 45 yards and a touchdown to his résumé. For all that eventual show of force, Freeport got off on the wrong foot. North Bay Haven’s Grant Lord snatched down an interception when Bulldog quarterback Zack Seay was making a pitch from the 14-yard line near the start of the game. The Bucs had the ball on their own 3, but the Freeport defense halted them nine yards up the field, forcing a punt that got off late, giving Freeport the ball on the 17-yard line. The Bulldogs wasted no time capitalizing on the favorable field positioning, and Chris Decker (seven carries, 44 yards) ran in a touchdown on the first snap from scrimmage, though the point-after kick failed. North Bay Haven had possession of the ball through the end of the first quarter, and made its first and only scoring threat in the first play of the second. Justin Bayless, who led the Bucs in rushing with 71 yards on nine carries, put Cooper Lovett in position for a field-goal attempt on about the 30-yard line, but Freeport’s Aaron Parker easily swatted the ball aside. From then on Freeport controlled the action, scoring on a nine-yard touchdown from Seay and an extra point kick from Zack Johnson to make it a 13-0 ballgame with 6:26 left in the half. Both sides gained some ground, though Freeport didn’t score again with its JV players on the field, and they both kicked the ball around until the intermission. Freeport scored twice in the third quarter, first when Decker intercepted a pass from Steven Padot and caught the Buccaneer offense going the other way, leaving him with plenty of open ground. He returned the ball for a TD from 52 yards out and Johnson’s point-after kick was good for a 20-zip lead with 10:46 still to play in the period. North Bay Haven muffed the punt after they got the ball back and after being held to their own 37-yard line on the ensuing possession, giving Saults the stage upon which to make his mark. Freeport took over on the 27, and though Saults was at first forced back to the 30, he then took the handoff to run in a 33-yard touchdown on second and 13. The kick came up short, but Freeport still got the 26-0 winning margin out of the brief possession. The remainder of the game, including the entire fourth quarter, was scoreless on both sides, as either team either punted or turned the ball over on downs while the clock ran down. North Bay Haven very nearly put together a scoring drive late in the game, but Freeport recovered a Joe Dunn fumble on the 16-yard line with 1:15 left to play. Sault was pushed back to the 9 before taking a knee to let time run out for the win.\n\nSPORTS\n\nCategorize the news article into one of the 17 categories: COMMUNITY & LIFESTYLE CULTURE & ARTS EDUCATION ENTERTAINMENT ENVIRONMENT & ANIMALS FASHION & STYLE FINANCE & BUSINESS FOOD & DRINK LAW & CRIME MEDIA OTHERS POLITICS RELIGION SCIENCE & TECH SPORTS TRAVEL WORLD NEWS\n\nHealth As-it-happens update ⋅ September 21, 2015 NEWS Provider tax good way to expand Utah's health insurance Deseret News The state's leaders have chosen premium assistance as the preferred route to further expanding health insurance and ensuring access to health care for all Utahns.

Their only child, Kevin Jr., died in 2011 after he was punched in the face during a fight the night of July 4 on the shores of Lake Michigan in Long Beach, Ind. Kevin, 17, died in a hospital two days later. The brutal punch took his life but won't claim his memory or his legacy, his father said. This week, the couple, who live in Chicago's Beverly community, announced that most of a $1 million settlement of their lawsuit over their son's death will be given to charity, including $500,000 to Mount Carmel High School, where Kevin Jr. attended. \"This is something we have to live with for the rest of our lives. But doing this, giving money away, it makes us feel pretty good that something good came out of Kevin's time on this earth,\" his father said. Legal costs, mostly attorney fees, in the three-year court fight, amounted to about $350,000, leaving the couple with $650,000. The Kennellys decided to donate it all to Mount Carmel; St. Barnabas School, where Kevin went to grade school; a church and the scholarship fund named for their son. \"It wasn't our money,\" Kevin said. \"It was the price they put on Kevin's life.\" At Mount Carmel, where Kevin Jr. played baseball and soccer and would have been a senior in September 2011, the Rev. Tony Mazurkiewicz, the school president, said the use of the generous gift has not been determined. The other $150,000 will be split between St. Barnabas School, where Kevin graduated in 2009; St. Rita High School, in appreciation of a kindly priest, the Rev. Tom McCarthy, who counseled the parents after Kevin's death; tiny Sacred Heart Church, 11652 S. Church St., Chicago, a favorite of the Kennelly family for Mass; and to the Kevin F. Kennelly Jr. Memorial Scholarship Fund. The couple's generosity stunned their attorney, Bryan O'Connor. \"Wasn't that amazing? I've been doing this job for 38 years, and I've had many (wrongful) death cases. Never once did the beneficiary donate everything to various charities,\" O'Connor said. \"They were totally devoted to their son. Their lives revolved around him.\" Life has been hard for Kevin and Jean since they lost their son. They think of him every day, Kennelly said. When asked how he and his wife are coping, he said, \"Not very well, but it's not anything you heal from. It doesn't go away.\" Kennelly, 60, is a Chicago Fire Department captain. He plans to work as long as he can, in part because it keeps his mind off their loss. The lawsuit took about three years to resolve after the criminal case was decided against Jake Malecek, of Chicago, the man who punched Kevin and who pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter, O'Connor said. He said Malecek \"did a couple months in jail and also did home confinement wearing an ankle bracelet.\" An autopsy by the Lake County, Ind., coroner determined that Kevin died from the blow to his head and ruled it a homicide. O'Connor said the family \"had just bought and renovated a summer vacation home up there, and that was the first weekend for their son to have friends up there. And he winds up dead after just an unbelievable chain of events.\" The couple has sold the vacation home in Long Beach, they said. \"It wasn't that we were ashamed of being there,\" Kennelly said. \"That was our own personal stations of the cross — 'this was the place we saw Kevin last. That was the door Kevin walked out the last time,'\" Kevin had mentioned following in his father's firefighting footsteps, but Dad was \"dead set against that. \"It's not a safe thing to do. He was a very bright kid. He would've thought of something else,\" Kennelly said. \"He was 6-foot-2 and 160 pounds, skinny. He hadn't even started shaving yet. Who knows where he'd be now?\" Kennelly said. \"He wanted to go to Spring Hill College in Mobile, Ala., a Jesuit school. Three of his friends went there because he wanted to. They did it to honor him.\" Kevin was so popular with his classmates that his visitation was held at the Mount Carmel Convocation Center. The Kennellys announced their donation to Mount Carmel at the school on Wednesday. Eileen O'Connor, Bryan's daughter who practices law with him, called it \"very emotional.\" \"When the family came to us four years ago, they said it was never about the money. They did this for their son,\" she said. At Mount Carmel on Thursday, Mazurkiewicz said he can \"still see where Kevin sat\" in geology class, calling him \"one of the nicest, most generous young men I ever taught. And now there's the incredible generosity of the family.\" Kennelly said Kevin was a dedicated fan of the Blackhawks and White Sox. \"He would have had a hard time with the Cubs this season,\" his father said with a laugh. A golf outing will be held Oct. 3 at Gleneagles Golf Club near Lemont to raise money for the scholarship fund, he said.\n\nOTHERS\n\nCategorize the news article into one of the 17 categories: COMMUNITY & LIFESTYLE CULTURE & ARTS EDUCATION ENTERTAINMENT ENVIRONMENT & ANIMALS FASHION & STYLE FINANCE & BUSINESS FOOD & DRINK LAW & CRIME MEDIA OTHERS POLITICS RELIGION SCIENCE & TECH SPORTS TRAVEL WORLD NEWS\n\nBut why'd you have to steal a sista's cat, tho?

For instance, there might be different departments with their own HR system and there might be separate sources for customers or business partners. In this article I’ll discuss 4 options to manage multiple sources and prevent issues like double identities. I will also present a use case to explain how to configure Oracle Identity Manager to use multiple sources. Use Case Swift&Safe Inc. is an organization that specializes in logistics. Swift&Safe Inc. uses Oracle Identity Manager to provide employees and customers with appropriate access to company resources. They use two different HR systems: one for employees who work in at the office (mostly administrative staff, but also some who work the logistic processes), and one for employees on the road. Let’s call these systems HR1 and HR2, both will be used by Oracle Identity Manager for importing identities. In addition, the company uses a third system (CUST1) to register customers and Oracle Identity Manager will also import identities from this system. Figure 1: Swift&Safe Inc. In this case people can have several positions within the company concurrently and can therefore exist in both HR1 and HR2, but Swift&Safe Inc. only allows one identity in Oracle Identity Manager per employee, so that any entitlements a particular person has can be checked against segregation of duties (SoD) policies. In addition, an employee can also be a customer and in that case needs a separate customer identity because access to customer facing resources is managed separately. Swift&Safe Inc. is working on connecting Oracle Identity Manager to these three sources so employees and customers will have the correct identities in Oracle Identity Manager. How does it work? First I’ll tell you a couple of things you need to know about how the importing of identity information works in Oracle Identity Manager. After that, we can look into possible implementation options. Source systems are integrated with Oracle Identity Manager by use of connectors. A connector is installed for every source and holds information about the format of the data in the source system (meta data), and a mapping table specifying which attributes of entries in the source correspond to which attributes of an identity in Oracle Identity Manager. The meta data and mapping table tell Oracle Identity Manager how to interpret the flow of data coming from a source so Oracle Identity Manager can build identities with the provided information. Figure 2: Example of attribute mapping. Oracle Identity Manager uses its reconciliation engine to handle the process of importing information. Reconciliation can be done in trusted mode and target mode. In trusted mode the imported identity information is used to create, update and delete identities in Oracle Identity Manager. In target mode, the imported data is regarded as information about accounts that are present in the source system. These accounts are assigned to identities in Oracle Identity Manager. The reconciliation engine first uses the information of an entry in the source to try to match the entry to an identity in Oracle Identity Manager, based on matching rules. Depending on the result of this matching process, an action is then assigned to handle the imported entry, based on action rules. The matching and action rules are defined at connector level so these are specific per source. The entry and assigned actions (for example “create identity”) are stored in an event that is placed in the event queue. Items in this queue are then processed in so called orchestrations, which are workflows that take care of the job at hand. Figure 3: Action rules define actions for each type of matching results Implementation options Integrating HR sources One way to prevent issues, is to make sure only one system is authoritative for the lifecycle of identities. A trusted reconciliation is set up with this source. Additional target reconciliations can be set up with any number of sources to augment Oracle Identity Manager identities with additional attributes that are not present in the trusted reconciliation. In the case of Swift&Safe Inc. this option requires the consolidation of identity information at HR system level, because information from all three systems must be present in the trusted source defined in Oracle Identity Manager. Using a staging area This option involves setting up a system that acts as a staging area between the HR sources and Oracle Identity Manager. This may be in the form of a database or directory where information from multiple sources is combined (and maybe scrubbed, enriched or anonymized) in order to create a single trusted source for Oracle Identity Manager. In some situations this may be an option because of the complexity of the data, the amount of changes in meta data, the skill set of the support team or responsibility for data sanitation. But it may not be technically possible or too costly to maintain an extra system. Allowing multiple identities per person Technically you can use multiple trusted sources in Oracle Identity Manager, and these sources will be authoritative for the lifecycle of ‘their’ identities. In this case multiple identities will be created for a person if this person is registered in more than one trusted source, and this results in multiple accounts on target systems. This can be useful for keeping accounts related to different job functions separated. Having multiple accounts on the same company resources can also be confusing to end users while perfoming their daily dutties and when they review information in request or review processes. Or maybe only one identity will be created and creation of subsequent identities for the same person will fail, depending on the configuration of Oracle Identity Manager for instance regarding the uniqueness of attributes. Consolidating identity information in Oracle Identity Manager Using Oracle Identity Manager to consolidate identity information. This is the option that Swift&Safe Inc. will be implementing. They will use the capabilities of Oracle Identity Manager to combine identity information and centrally manage accounts and access rights. In part 2 of this article we’ll take a look at the basic configuration that is needed to achieve this. Conclusion There are several options for managing identities in an environment where multiple sources for identity information are used. Which one fits best in your organization depends on several factors such as technical feasibility, costs, maintainability and reliability, and data quality responsibility. Swift&Safe Inc. decided on option 4 because they need to keep their HR systems separated and do not want the burden of maintaining an extra system needed for a staging area. Oracle Identity Manager provides them with an excellent option by providing a central platform with configurable connectors, reconciliation options and workflows which allows them to accommodate the flow of identity information. In part 2 of this article you’ll find more information on how to set up Oracle Identity Manager in this scenario.

Sergi and I are such huge fans of breakfast foods for all three meals of the day, not just in the morning. Not only does this place have the most amazing beignets that taste remarkably like Russian Ponchiki , but they also have so many entree options. This omelet is my favorite. I tweaked it a bit to suit my taste more. The caramelized onions and golden brown mushrooms are so filling and hearty, the roasted peppers, tomatoes, spinach and fresh herbs bring so much brightness and fresh flavors. The feta cheese and shaved Parmesan cheese are the finishing touch that are so creamy, tangy and nutty. So many vitamins and nutrients are packed into one omelet. You will start your day right from the very beginning. You can make this for an indulgent breakfast on the weekend, as well as a quick dinner any day of the week. I’ve been making it over and over again and every time I savor every bite, trying to get every single ingredient on the fork before it goes in my mouth. It’s the perfect combination for my palate. Ingredients: 4 eggs 2 Tablespoons half n half (or milk or heavy cream) salt, ground black pepper 2 Tablespoons butter or oil, divided 1 very small onion, sliced 2-4 oz fresh mushrooms (baby bella, button or any other kind of mushrooms), sliced 1 large handful baby spinach 1/4 cup roasted red peppers, julienned 1/4 cup cherry tomatoes, sliced 4 Tablespoons feta cheese, crumbled 2 Tablespoons Parmesan cheese, shaved or grated 1 Tablespoon fresh basil and parsley, chopped Instructions: Whisk the eggs, half and half, a pinch of salt and ground black pepper until the eggs are evenly mixed. (Half and half is a dairy product that is basically half milk and half heavy cream. You can use milk or heavy cream instead also.) In a 10 inch nonstick skillet, heat up 1/2 Tablespoon of butter or oil. Add the onions and cook until tender, about 3 minutes. Add the mushrooms, season with salt and ground black pepper and cook for another 5 minutes or so. The mushrooms and onion should start to turn golden brown. Take them out of the skillet and set aside. Wipe out the skillet. Add 1/2 Tablespoon of butter and melt it on medium heat. When the butter stops sizzling, pour in half of the egg mixture into the skillet. You should hear it sizzle gently. Swirl the eggs around the pan. As the eggs set on the bottom, gently push them towards the center of the pan and swirl the pan so the liquid eggs will flow to the sides. Keep pushing the set eggs toward the center and swirling the pan, until most of the liquid eggs are dispersed evenly over the surface of the omelet. This is a very quick process and shouldn’t take long at all. When the bottom of the omelet sets but the top is still runny, add half of the mushroom mixture to the center of the omelet, top with half of the baby spinach, half of the roasted red peppers and half of the tomatoes. Using a small, very thin spatula, fold the first side over the middle of the omelet. Fold the other side over the middle also, to make a neat omelet. Slide the omelet out of the skillet and onto a plate. Top with half of the feta cheese and half of the Parmesan cheese. As the cheese settles into the hot omelet, it will start to get soft and melted. Repeat with the rest of the ingredients. Garnish both omelets with fresh basil and parsley. Serve immediately.
