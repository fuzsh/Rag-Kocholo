        "text": "I mean, is it okay to release state championship predictions less than a few hours after the release of the Florida High School Athletic Association’s 2024-2026 football classifications (We know they’re tentative, relax)?\n\nEh, why not?\n\nOn Friday morning, at exactly 10 a.m., the FHSAA introduced its tentative new classifications/districts for the next two years and there’s a lot of mixed reactions coming in from across the Sunshine State.\n\nTo join in the fun, we want to give you our ‘way too early’ state championship predictions based on the classifications released and hear from the fans on who you think will reach the 2024 FHSAA state championships?\n\nTake a look down at the classification matchups we’ve cooked up.\n\nClass 7A\n\nColumbus vs. Venice: Seems like the easy pick, right? Both teams lose their respective starting quarterbacks, but something tells us each team will have capable signal callers at the position. Columbus’ Dave Dunn always finds a way to maximize the talent on his teams. Venice brings back Power Five talent Jamarice Wilder in the backfield. Now watch out for teams like DeLand, Sanford Seminole and Western to be in the running in this classification as well.\n\nClass 6A\n\nArmwood vs. Mandarin: One of these teams reached their respective state championship games and will have a chance to get back in 2024. If you’re Mandarin, you’ve got to like your chances with Florida State commit Tramell Jones and Alabama commit Jaime Ffrench both returning on offense. The Hawks seemed on the cusp of getting back to the old days, but fell short. With Girard Pringle in the back again, Armwood will be a state title contender. Bartram Trail, Homestead, Monarch and West Boca Raton are teams to watch.\n\nClass 5A\n\nLakeland vs. St. Thomas Aquinas: The old foes meet once again. These two programs have met six previous times in state championship games, so why not predict a seventh? Both are coming off state championships in 2023 and nothing is telling us they couldn’t do it again. The Dreadnaughts’ backfield will be stacked, with Zander Smith back at quarterback. Though the Raiders are losing some Power Five level talent, they always end up reloading. The Dreadnaughts lead the series 5-1 over the Raiders.\n\nClass 4A\n\nPlantation American Heritage vs. St. Augustine: Now this classification isn’t easy to predict by any means, with many central and northern Florida teams being worthy of making a run to the state championship game. It’s a quarterback-eccentric game and we went with the two teams that will have their guys back. Dia Bell will be one more year wiser and with running back Byron Louis and wide receiver Malachi Toney in the fold, this Patriots’ offense will be tough to stop. For the Yellow Jackets coming off a tough loss in Class 3S, Locklan Hewlett (Wake Forest commit) returns and will be one of the state’s best passers. Definitely could see Jesuit, Jones, Naples and Miami Norland in the mix here.\n\nClass 3A\n\nBishop Moore vs. Miami Central: The entire northern part of this classification is tough to call, whether you’re evaluating Bishop Moore, Eau Gallie or Raines, as to who would be the representative to face the mighty Miami Central Rockets. We’ll go with the up and coming Hornets of Orlando to make a state championship appearance against a Rockets team that will be looking to make an example out of whomever they face. Not being able to complete the 5-peat this past season definitely has to be bothering Miami Central head coach Jube Joseph. It just has to be. Now not having to face another South Florida power (I.E. Miami Norland), the Rockets return to start another possible string of state championships.\n\nClass 2A\n\nBerkeley Prep vs. Miami Booker T. Washington: Yes, give us the 813 versus 305 again in 2024. Miami Norland wasn’t able to bring a trophy back to Dade County, so it will be Ice Harris and his Tornadoes this time around trying to slow down the Buccaneers’ running back duo of Dallas Golden and Joseph Troupe. Booker T. Washington should have one of the more talented defenses in all of South Florida, but it will need everyone defensively to corral these two. Other teams that could make a run in 2A are Bolles and of course Cocoa with Brady Hart under center. We know this is some bulletin board material type of stuff, but it’s hard to choose between Berkeley Prep and Cocoa. Either way, Buccaneers vs. Tornadoes or Tigers vs. Tornadoes would be a very fun state championship game.\n\nClass 1A\n\nClearwater Central Catholic vs. Chaminade-Madonna: Some things never change do they. Yes, we know there’s an up and coming The First Academy team out of Orlando, Edison and some others, but 1M just parallels to 1A. CCC versus Chaminade-Madonna one more time. Jershaun Newton is back for his senior season for the Marauders and may not have to face the generational talent the Lions attained the last two seasons. Can CCC head coach Chris Harvey cook something up? We know Chaminade-Madonna won’t be down and they’ll make another run towards states. But do they continue their dominance post-Jeremiah Smith/Cedrick Bailey/Joshisa Trader?\n\nRural\n\nHawthorne vs. Madison County: A rematch, again? Now we thought of Fort Meade and Blountstown as well here, but with what both Hawthorne (CJ Ingram back at quarterback) and Madison County are returning, it’s hard to not imagine these two facing each other once more."
