        "text": "TAMPA, Fla. — Keon Keeley got to work Monday afternoon, a position group of one in the northeast corner of Berkeley Prep’s football field. Training with an assistant coach, the five-star defensive end worked his right arm punch. He talked through his rip move with the swim finish. He pounded tackling dummies and trained his footwork. His gray Nike cleats barely held up, slipping and sliding on the hot turf. He took every rep because there was no one else at this position to split them up.\n\nIt was work without an immediate reward, his senior season four months away. This was the kind of afternoon where Keeley could blend in, which was sort of the point around here. Yes, a prospect committed to Notre Dame and hearing from Alabama, Georgia and Ohio State can’t get lost in a crowd. Not at 6-foot-6 and 240 pounds with a pterodactyl’s wingspan.\n\nTo watch Keeley practice on a high school football field in early May is to understand why Notre Dame pushed so hard for him before he committed last June and why the Irish have kept it up ever since despite changes at head coach, defensive coordinator and defensive line coach. Marcus Freeman, who was in Tampa for an alumni event Monday night, understands what a first-round pick looks like after attending the NFL Draft last month with Kyle Hamilton. And Keeley has the makeup to get there.\n\nIt’s just that nobody around Berkeley Prep wants Keeley to rush the journey, which is part of the reason why head coach Dominick Ciao made his star off-limits to media this week as the recruiting process had begun to wear on the defensive end. It’s not that Ciao is holding Keeley back. It’s just that he wants to help push him forward on the original path, through his final high school season and then on to Notre Dame.\n\nThe first All-American Ciao coached as a high schooler was Gary Godsey, the former Notre Dame tight end who now volunteers on the Berkeley staff. Keeley will be next, following 2022 third-round pick Nicholas Petit-Frere (Ohio State) and seven-year NFL receiver Nelson Agholor (USC). Notre Dame likely finished runner-up for both.\n\n“It’s funny, those guys were never the ones that were like trying to get interviewed, waving a hand when getting media opportunity. They’re still like that today,” Godsey said. “I remember thinking Nelson and Nick would fit in well at Notre Dame as well.\n\n“I think the school and the culture at Notre Dame will be perfect for (Keeley). I think he’ll fit in. If you try to silo yourself off and be an athlete type of guy, it’s not going to be a good fit for you. I think he needs the school, and I think the school will do wonders for him.”\n\nThere’s no question Notre Dame believes Keeley can pay that back, part of the reason it has gotten him to visit four times, including multiple visits with friend and teammate Tre Reader, who will be a preferred walk-on linebacker for the Irish next year. Younger brother Troy Reader, who is in Keeley’s class, is committed to Notre Dame’s baseball program.\n\nFreeman was introduced as Notre Dame’s new head coach on Dec. 6. He spent the next two days trying to hold together the recruiting class that signed last winter. On Dec. 9, he was in the Berkeley Prep locker room doing a FaceTime call with Godsey and sitting down with Keeley. A day later, Berkeley Prep lost in the state championship game. And almost immediately, the college programs that have proven talent wins national titles began to circle.\n\n“With all the attention, it’s become a little overwhelming,” Ciao said. “He wants to scale that back. Wants to focus on spring, school, senior year. That’s what we want him to focus on. The recruiting can be overwhelming.”\n\nThese days Ciao serves as a gatekeeper for coaches and media. Some coaches still contact Keeley directly, but his mother Janicke said the downshift in phone calls, texts and attention has helped her son have something close to a normal spring. He doesn’t have to wait until 11 p.m. to start doing his homework.\n\nNot that anything is completely normal about Keon Keeley. He’s unique beyond his height, weight and build, all of which would make him stand out at Notre Dame right now.\n\nDepending on the traffic, it can take Keon Keeley almost an hour to get to Berkley Prep from home with Janicke. As worldly as Janicke may be — she’s from near Oslo, Norway, and Keon has visited Scandinavia multiple times — her knowledge of the college football recruiting industry was not extensive. Before Keon began to be recruited, the family had a habit of attending spring games at Florida, about a two-hour drive.\n\n“I never thought Keon was going to leave the state to play anywhere else,” Janicke said. “It never even came to my mind that he’d go anywhere else than the Gators. As time went by, I realized people do go to different states. The only thing that I told him, don’t go to Oregon. Too far for me! And they really wanted him.”\n\nFormer defensive line coach Mike Elston helped start Keeley’s recruitment, and Freeman pushed it forward. Janicke didn’t want to blow the budget on recruiting trips during his sophomore year, so she told Keon to pick one visit that required a flight. He chose Notre Dame. He came back telling family and friends that South Bend might be the move.\n\nThen came the hard part, comparing Notre Dame to schools Keeley had never seen. That uncertainty began to eat at Keeley. Either he’d visit other programs and it would confirm how he felt about Notre Dame or he’d visit other programs and realize he’d made a mistake. This was a tough message to convey to Notre Dame. And Keeley is known as a goofy kid and a pleaser by friends. He might look like a five-star, but he doesn’t act like the stereotypical one. He sings in the school choir. He put on the school’s Buccaneer mascot suit and walked around the elementary building. He loves eating at Tacos Las Californias near Berkeley Prep. Even better, Waffle House.\n\n“Waffle House, if you’re into NIL, that’s your guy right there,” Tre Reader said. “That’s the guy you should be talking to.”\n\nUltimately, Keeley visited Florida State, Florida, Alabama and Ohio State. He saw the Gators a couple of times. While only Keeley can answer for what impression those trips had on him, those who know him believe they separated Notre Dame from the pack more than pulling the Irish back into a recruiting dogfight.\n\nHe passed on the Florida spring game this year. Keeley returned to Notre Dame for the Blue-Gold Game on April 23. It helped. But a spring practice visit a month earlier helped, too. Whatever the timeline, there’s little uncertainty among the people who know him best about where Keeley will sign next December, with the caveat eight months is a long time in college football.\n\n“The other day he said out of the blue, ‘I miss Notre Dame. I wish I was there. I could go past the Dome and go to my dorm.’ Out of the blue,” Janicke said. “He never talks like that usually. I feel like he feels he fits in there. “\n\nKeeley is ranked as the No. 3 overall prospect nationally on On3, No. 9 on 247 Sports, No. 14 on Rivals and No. 23 on ESPN. According to 247Sports player ratings, he’s behind only Jimmy Clausen, Jaylon Smith, Manti Te’o and Sam Young as the highest ranked Irish commits of the internet rating era. He’s the highest ranked recruit in a decade to commit to Notre Dame. He’s the highest rated defensive lineman in more than 20 years, or at least since that that stuff started to get tracked.\n\nThat timeline doesn’t stretch back to Godsey’s own Notre Dame career, when he played with Anthony Weaver, Justin Tuck and Grant Irons.\n\n“Grant got big and was thick. Keon is a much more athletic version of Grant,” Godsey said.\n\n“Kind of a younger Justin Tuck. Tuck was so good at getting separation with the tackles when coming off the edge. Keon is similar to that. His lower half, you may see where he might be able to put on a ton of weight. When he hits the weight room up there, he’s going to turn into a super explosive person coming off the edge.”\n\nKeeley finished his junior year with 16.5 sacks, 34 tackles for loss and 61 total tackles. Notre Dame fans are already sending Keeley pictures to autograph and mail back.\n\nWhen Keon Keeley craves normalcy, there’s always a slice of it down the street from Berkeley Prep at the Reader home. Janicke and Keon have celebrated holidays there. The families have traveled to Notre Dame together. Plenty of weekends include Keeley on the family’s couches. Sometimes they’ll head out to dinner with the youngest Reader son, Ty, or maybe catch a movie. Even at nine years old, Ty is part of the Notre Dame gang enough that he has a picture with Marcus Freeman announcing his commitment.\n\nTheir father Nick Reader, the former CFO of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, sees a little bit of his happy-go-lucky personality in Keeley. He also played for Ciao back in his days at Jesuit. Now he tries to help mentor Keeley when the defensive end needs it. He knows Ciao is doing the same because the coach did that for him, too.\n\n“Keon’s not a hothead, won’t get mad. He’d get tears in his eyes before he’d yell back,” Nick said. “He’s a big kid with a grin on his face wondering what great things are gonna happen today.”\n\nAmong the older Reader sons, Troy committed to Notre Dame first. Then Keon, then Tre, who chose a preferred walk-on spot with the Irish over the same opportunity at Michigan or a shot in the Ivy League. It’s hard to know how much the Reader connections to Notre Dame helped Keeley maintain his own. But it couldn’t hurt as Keeley sorted through a potentially confusing recruitment.\n\n“The more he goes into these other locker rooms, the more he sees football cultures, the more he realizes Notre Dame is a place he can go and the guys are going to love him like a brother,” Tre said. “Honestly, you don’t get that anywhere else. I’ve had some friends that have gone off to play college football a year ahead of me and they can’t say the same. I think every time he goes somewhere else and looks somewhere else. I think he really understands that just a little more.”\n\nIf Notre Dame can get Keeley back for a fifth time during the official visit weekend of June 11, that point should be driven home again. He wouldn’t be the only five-star prospect expected in town. But, as Ciao likes to point out, all that can wait. Notre Dame isn’t going anywhere. And Keeley doesn’t seem to be going anywhere else.\n\nInside the Berkeley Prep program, Ciao has a few mantras for players to remember. Heart power. Character. Expect nothing, do something. After talking it over, he might add another:\n\nDistraction is the enemy of greatness.\n\nYes, there is ample greatness around Keon Keeley. There’s plenty of potential distraction, too, at least if Keeley and his support network let it penetrate.\n\n“You gotta cut that stuff out because you have such a short window for greatness,” Tre said. “Such a short opportunity to maximize what time you have.”\n\nThat’s what Keeley tried to do on Monday afternoon. He has tried to do the same every other day since he figured out how to manage all the extra stuff that comes with being five-star Keon Keeley.\n\nMaybe there’s nothing else to say.\n\n(Top photo courtesy of Pete Sampson)"
