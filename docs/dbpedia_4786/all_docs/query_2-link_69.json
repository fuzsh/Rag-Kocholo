        "text": "All games 7:30 p.m. Friday.\n\nClass 2A, Region 3\n\nNo. 4 Admiral Farragut (8-3) vs. No. 3 Seffner Christian (9-3) at Strawberry Crest\n\nHow they got here: Admiral Farragut defeated No. 5 Keswick Christian 52-10, No. 1 Cambridge Christian 24-13. Seffner Christian defeated No. 6 Zephyrhills Christian 35-6, No. 2 Northside Christian 49-21.\n\nUp next: Hialeah Champagnat-Moore Haven winner in state semis\n\nOutlook: Both teams started the season slowly but have picked things up at the right time. The Blue Jackets have won six straight, including a forfeit win over Village Academy. They also avenged a regular-season loss to Cambridge Christian last week. The Crusaders have played even better, winning nine straight after losing their first three. Admiral Farragut plays good defense, which will be key Friday night. The Seffner Christian combination of quarterback Isaiah Knowles and tight end Mike Trigg has caused fits for teams ever since Knowles came back from injury in the fifth game of the season. The duo hooked up for five touchdowns last week. The Blue Jackets platoon Ty Vongvenekeo and Tonio Shavers at quarterback, and have a running attack of Uriah Jenkins and Raymond Walker. Both teams are balanced, which should result in a close game. “It’s going to take a complete team effort in all phases of the game to beat an extremely talented Farragut team,” Seffner Christian coach Travis Puleo said. “We must play turnover-free football and run the football when we need to. It’s very important to be able to get off the field on third down on defense. It’s a huge challenge for us against a team that is coached extremely well.”\n\nRodney Page prediction: Seffner Christian 45-35. In a game that will feature two good offenses, the Crusaders have a little bit more to pull out the home win.\n\nBob Putnam prediction: Seffner Christian 28-21. This one will be close. The Isaiah Knowles-Michael Trigg passing combination might be the difference.\n\nClass 3A, Region 3\n\nNo. 5 Clearwater Central Catholic (9-3) at No. 2 Fort Myers Bishop Verot (9-2)\n\nHow they got here: Clearwater Central Catholic defeated No. 4 Calvary Christian 49-28, No. 1 Berkeley Prep 34-28 (3OT). Fort Myers Bishop Verot defeated No. 6 West Palm Beach Benjamin 28-7.\n\nUp next: Hollywood Chaminade-Fort Lauderdale Calvary Christian winner in state semis\n\nOutlook: The Marauders can become the first Pinellas County team to win a region title after three straight victories on the road. A win would also clinch CCC’s seventh region title in the past eight years and mark the third straight season with double-digit victories. Those are just the latest in a series of milestones the Marauders have set in the postseason. Running back Jordan Niles already has the school record for touchdowns in a season with 25 and needs just 65 yards rushing to set the single-season record with 1,917. Defensive lineman Johnny Newton has already set the school record for sacks in a season with 14. This is the fifth time CCC has faced Bishop Verot in the playoffs. The Marauders went 3-1 in the previous four, all at home. “Bishop Verot is a solid team,” CCC coach Chris Harvey said. “We have to try to make them one-dimensional on offense. And we have to keep relying on our offensive line and running the ball, which is what we do best.”\n\nRodney Page prediction: CCC 28-20. Normally, this would be a difficult game for the road team. But CCC has been there, done that and will run its way to a win.\n\nBob Putnam prediction: CCC 34-17. The Marauders are already road tested and that should help them reach the state semifinals — again.\n\nClass 4A, Region 3\n\nNo. 3 Tampa Catholic (7-5) at No. 1 Lakewood (11-0)\n\nHow they got here: Tampa Catholic defeated No. 6 Lemon Bay 35-6, No. 2 Delray Beach American Heritage 33-16. Lakewood defeated No. 5 Clewiston 35-0.\n\nUp next: Miami Booker T. Washington-Fort Lauderdale Cardinal Gibbons winner in state semis\n\nOutlook: There is a buzz around Lakewood football. So much so that the school is bringing in extra bleachers to hold what is expected to be an overflow crowd. The Spartans are healthy and basically rested after earning a bye in the first round of the playoffs. The Crusaders are confident after two impressive offensive performances in the first two rounds. Something has to give. This has been a special season for the Spartans. They have worn teams out with an offense that features a dual-threat quarterback in Greg Spann II, two dangerous receivers in Artez Hooker and TJ Tampa and running back Derrel Kelley III. And they have frustrated offenses with a shut-down defense that includes two Miami commits, Tre’von Riggins and Cortez McKenzie. Tampa Catholic can put up points thanks to the arm of quarterback Dylan McCain and the hands of receiver Marcellus Crutchfield. If the Crusaders can stay patient on offense and disciplined on defense they could have a shot. “We’re at the point of the year where everybody is good,” Lakewood coach Cory Moore said. “We just want to make sure we don’t make dumb mistakes. We want to win the penalty game. We want to have a very limited amount of penalties. We’re very healthy right now. Practices have been good. It’s a great time for us right now.”\n\nRodney Page prediction: Lakewood 35-10. If the Spartans can score early, it could be a long night for the Crusaders.\n\nBob Putnam prediction: Lakewood 28-6. The Spartans’ defense, especially the interior line, will be tough for the Crusaders to handle.\n\nClass 5A, Region 3\n\nNo. 4 Jesuit (10-2) at No. 2 Lake Wales (12-0)\n\nHow they got here: Jesuit defeated No. 5 Melbourne Eau Gallie 45-9, No. 8 Chamberlain 30-7. Lake Wales defeated No. 7 Sebring 22-21, No. 6 Port Orange Atlantic 36-21.\n\nUp next: Miami Northwestern-Plantation American Heritage winner in state semis\n\nOutlook: Tigers coach Matt Thompson thought his team had one of its best defensive efforts of the season last week against Chamberlain. They need to repeat that on the road this week. The Highlanders average 45 points per game. Quarterback Eric Williams has thrown for nearly 2,000 yards and running back Johnny Richardson has run for more than 2,000 yards. Jesuit hopes to get running back Nick Spurlin back. Quarterback Kiael Kelly can run and pass, and the Tigers have several quality backs, especially Ricky Parks. Jesuit is trying to get back to the state semifinals for the second straight season. “Offensively (Lake Wales is) formidable,” Jesuit coach Matt Thompson said. “Their running back (Richardson) has over 2,000 yards. Their quarterback can take it and they have a big-time receiver (Norman Love). They aren’t 12-0 for nothing. We definitely have to be balanced on offense and defense. We have to run it when they think we’re going to throw it and throw it when they think we’re going to run it. On defense, if we don’t give up the big play we’re going to be okay. But we’ve got our hands full.”\n\nRodney Page prediction: Lake Wales 28-26. The Highlanders offense is difficult to contain for four quarters.\n\nBob Putnam prediction: Jesuit 27-21. Lake Wales beat Sebring twice by a combined eight points. Sebring lost to CCC by 13. Advantage, Tigers.\n\nClass 6A, Region 2\n\nNo. 3 Lake Minneola (9-3) at No. 1 Gaither (11-1)\n\nUp next: Jacksonville Lee-Pensacola Escambia winner in state semis\n\nOutlook: The Cowboys are in the region final for the third time and are trying to reach their state semifinal. Lake Minneola is in the region final for the first time. Both teams have prolific offenses with contrasting styles. Gaither quarterback Tony Bartalo leads the state in touchdown passes with 39. He built up his numbers by spreading the ball around. Six receivers have double digits in receptions, 200 yards and at least two touchdowns on the season. Hawks running back Kyeandre Magloire leads the state with 2,416 rushing yards and touchdowns with 34. “We can’t beat ourselves,” Gaither coach Kirk Karson said. “We can’t have too many turnovers on offense and undisciplined penalties on defense.”\n\nRodney Page prediction: Gaither 42-35. There should be touchdowns galore with these offenses. The Cowboys get one more than the Hawks and move on.\n\nBob Putnam prediction: Gaither 34-30. The Cowboys have yet to see a running back back like Magloire. But the Hawks have not seen a quarterback like Bartalo, who ends up producing more in this one.\n\nClass 7A, Region 2\n\nNo. 2 Lakeland (12-0) at No. 1 Armwood (11-1)\n\nUp next: Niceville-Orlando Edgewater winner in the state semis\n\nOutlook: This is the most anticipated game of the season. Lakeland is the defending Class 7A state champion. Armwood went to the 6A finals the past two seasons before moving up one classification. Both rosters are loaded with four- and five-star recruits. Perhaps the biggest matchup is the Hawks’ defense, which has posted seven shutouts this season, going up against Dreadnaughts running back Demarkcus Bowman, who has already committed to Clemson. “To win, we need three things to happen,” Armwood coach Evan Davis said. “We can’t turn the ball over. We have to minimize penalties. And we have to slow down Bowman as much as possible.”\n\nRodney Page prediction: Lakeland 17-14. The Hawks have never beaten the Dreadnaughts. Bowman makes sure it stays that way.\n\nBob Putnam prediction: Armwood 21-20. The Hawks’ defense will keep them in this one. It is up to the offense to produce. I think they wake up for the most important game of the season.\n\nClass 8A, Region 2\n\nNo. 4 Steinbrenner (11-1) at No. 3 Kissimmee Osceola (10-1)\n\nHow they got here: Steinbrenner defeated No. 5 Newsome 49-20, No. 1 Sarasota Riverview 27-24. Kissimmee Osceola defeated No. 6 Riverview 58-21, No. 2 Orlando Dr. Phillips 20-7\n\nUp next: Apopka-Sanford Seminole winner in state semis\n\nOutlook: This is the Warriors’ first region final appearance. They got this far thanks to a balanced offense and an opportunistic defense. Quarterback Haden Carlson has thrown for 2,016 yards and 30 touchdowns. Running back Deon Silas needs just 43 yards to reach 1,000 for the season. On defense, Matt Durrance has four interceptions, two forced fumbles, two fumble recoveries and three blocked punts. The Kowboys, who have won nine straight, are led by a defense that has posted five shutouts this season. “It’s going to take physicality, discipline and a relentless effort to win,” Steinbrenner coach Andres Perez said. “At this point, with eight teams left in the state, everyone has great schemes. Now it comes down to which team does the little things right the most consistently.”\n\nRodney Page prediction: Steinbrenner 24-21. It’s been a memorable season for the Warriors and a late field goal keeps it going. Besides, can’t take a team that spells its mascot with a “K.”"
