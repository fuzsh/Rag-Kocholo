        "text": "The school was purchased by Ms. Mary Harley Jenks in 1930, who later founded College Preparatory School (CPS) in the 1960s. In the 1930s the school moved to Benvenue Avenue in Berkeley. It was at this point that the name changed from “Margaret Bentley” to “Bentley School,\" which included grades Kindergarten through 12th grade, with approximately 60-70 children, five per class. The school was coed through 3rd grade, and all girls 4th-12th grade.\n\nIn 1940, Mrs. Esther Hudson Branch, who had been teaching at Bentley since 1934, purchased the school from Ms. Jenks. The two women were lifelong friends and remained so until the death of Mrs. Branch in 1980. Mrs. Branch, in partnership with members of her family, remained proprietor of the school until 1969 when the school was incorporated as a non-profit institution by the State of California. By the late 1940s, the high school grades had been eliminated and the school operated as a K-8 school.\n\nThe building on Benvenue Avenue was limited in size. On June 5, 1969 the decision was made by the first Board of Trustees to incorporate the school and raise the capital necessary to purchase the four-acre Stanley Hiller Estate in Oakland to allow for future expansion. The buildings were modified and the school opened on the new campus in the fall of 1970. The school expanded from under 80 to 150 students. Esther Branch retired as Principal in 1972 but remained as President of the Board of Trustees until her death in March of 1980. Helen Sale was Principal of the school from the time of Mrs. Branch’s retirement until her own retirement in December of 1978. Robert A. Munro became Headmaster in April of 1979, a position he held until 2000. During Mr. Munro's tenure the school flourished on its current site and plans were made to develop the Upper School. Dr. Timothy Burns joined Bentley as interim Head for two years, followed by Head of School Rick Fitzgerald's six year tenure.\n\nA plan to double the size of the school was approved by the Board of Trustees in 1981. This plan called for the establishment of two classes at each of the K-8 grade levels by recruiting a second Kindergarten class in the fall of 1982 and each fall thereafter. As that first large class moved through the school, the enrollment reached 18 classes in the fall of 1990."
