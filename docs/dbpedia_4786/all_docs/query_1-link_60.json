        "text": "(ran TP edition)\n\nTampa's Berkeley Preparatory School finds it's marching to the beat of lots of different drummers _ and pipers, too.\n\nMarvel not at the dogged bagpipe.\n\nIf you catch the Berkeley Preparatory School Pipe and Drum Corps reeling out Scotland the Brave during morning convocation, or see Centro Asturiano piper Frank Dumont playing Asturias Patria Querida for a ceremony at that historic Ybor City social club, don't be surprised.\n\nThe bagpipe gets around. Even to Tampa.\n\nThe bagpipe has rafted up the Volga River in post-Rome Europe, stowed away in the sacks of returning European crusaders, and struck terror into the hearts of English soldiers on Scottish glens.\n\nHeck, it has even made its way on to an AC/DC song. So seeing it in the hands of high schoolers wowing their peers on their Town 'N Country campus, or tucked under the arm of an Ybor City native is just another aspect of the instrument's odyssey.\n\nWhy are we telling you about bagpipes when it's not Robert Burns Day in Scotland? Wasn't the Dunedin Highland Games and Festival last week? St. Patrick's Day last month? Well, there's bound to be some other folksy holiday coming up soon in France, or Sweden, or Poland, or Macedonia, or Turkey, or Tunisia for which the bagpipe would make a fine accompaniment.\n\nIt happens that those and many other countries lay claim to at least one kind of bagpipe. Beside the most famous of the bagpipes, the Scottish Highland pipe, there's also the Irish uilleann (\"ill-uhn\") pipe, the English Northumbrian smallpipe, the Czech Bohemian bock, the French grand cornamuse, the Hungarian duda (\"doo-dah\"), the Croatian surle, the German dudelsack, the Swedish sackpipa, the Tunisian zukra, the Polish koza, the Turkish tulum (\"too-loom\"), the Macedonian gaida (\"guy-da\"), the Russian volynka, the Iranian nay amban and the Indian mashag, to name a few.\n\nIf the bagpipe now seems more remote than ever, the Spanish gaita (\"gah-EE-tah\") is a pipe that you can hear in person.\n\nCasselberry resident Frank Dumont is the official gaitero, or gaita player of Ybor City's Centro Asturiano. It's the historic Tampa social club for descendants of Spain's Asturias region; therefore, Dumont plays the gaita asturiana. Other Spanish pipes include the gaita galleg of Galicia and the cornamusa of Catalan.\n\nDumont is occasionally summoned by the club for official functions, such as last October's Fall Verbena. He also plays in the city's SantaFest and Illuminated Holiday Parade.\n\nThe broad cultural legacy of the instrument sometimes inspires the 56-year-old optical engineer to become a roving bagpipe duelist. He travels to Highland games _ Scottish cultural festivals that feature bagpipe music, dancing and strongman sports _ around the country in his free time.\n\nAt games in Albany, N.Y., he encountered a uilleann-equipped pipe band from the New York State Highway Patrol. \"They were a bunch of Irishmen, so I started playing Irish tunes for them, and they just got totally devastated by it,\" he said laughing. \"I suddenly became their mascot.\"\n\nSince the gaita has a greater melodic range than Scottish Highland pipes, Dumont also relishes performing his bagpipe fusion to the bemusement of Scot-o-philes at festivals. \"When you talk to Scottish pipers they don't admit that anything else exists,\" Dumont said. \"What I do is my Spanish fingering on my Scottish pipes, and I get beautiful Scottish tunes out of it which are totally unique.\"\n\nThe Berkeley Preparatory School Pipe and Drum Corps doesn't have time for funky bagpipe remixes. At least not yet. The three-year-old unit had only four pipers until a year ago.\n\nThough still considered an extracurricular group, it's now a 39-member corps complete with 20 pipers, seven dancers, keyboardist, conductor and 10 drummers who supply the distinctive, crackling staccato snare rolls and booming bass and tenor drum accents synonymous with Highland piping.\n\nOne student's parents donated money for Highland uniforms, and now musicians play school functions and local parades decked in kilts, white shirts with epaulets, sporrans (leather pouch hanging from chain with horse hair), blue hose (knee socks), light and navy blue shoulder tartans, flashes (red ribbon hanging from hose) and belts with buckles.\n\n\"This is a group I want to get in parades,\" said corps director and Berkeley computer teacher Patrick Fisher. \"This is a group I want to take to Disney World. Which we did last year. (I wanted to) do a halftime show, which we did this year. I just kept putting in front of them things that I wanted them to do to encourage their friends.\"\n\nAs a first-grader, Fisher was stunned by the haunting reediness of the Highland pipes while watching the Dunedin High School pipe band at the Clearwater Sun 'N' Fun Parade. He went on to attend that school in the Pinellas town rich with Scottish heritage, and learned to play the pipes there.\n\nNow he marshals his students after school on Tuesdays and Fridays and works with individuals as needed to improve proficiency and legitimacy.\n\n\"When they go out,\" Fisher explained, \"people don't recognize that they don't have five years of experience, like an average high school (marching band) student. These kids have an average of five months of experience, and they're out there doing the same thing. They are stunning me. They are just totally stunning me.\"\n\nSenior piper Stephanie Jones, 17, gets no guff from her peers for being in a bagpipe band. \"It's not, like, an uncool thing to do. Definitely,\" she said during a recent practice.\n\nSame goes for senior pipe major Lisa Cohen's friends. \"They think it's cool,\" said the 17-year-old. \"I've always loved bagpipes. I've always thought their music was just beautiful.\"\n\nFisher is currently petitioning the school administration to make the band a part of Berkeley's music program. A gig they were invited to play last month is his strongest argument yet for the band's worthiness: the St. Patrick's Day parade in Boston.\n\nPipe In\n\nYou can learn about bagpipes from around the world on bagpipe historian Sean Folsom's Website at www.mcn.org/2/oseeler/bagpipes/\n\nTo contact Spanish bagpipe player Frank Dumont, e-mail him at fdumontdigital.net"
