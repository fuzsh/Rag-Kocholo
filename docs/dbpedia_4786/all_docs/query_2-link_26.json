        "text": "Private school in Mercer County, New Jersey, United States\n\nThe Peddie School is a college preparatory school in Hightstown, in Mercer County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It is a non-denominational, coeducational boarding school located on a 280-acre (110 ha) campus, and serves students in the ninth through twelfth grades, plus a small post-graduate class. The school has been accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Elementary and Secondary Schools since 1928.[7]\n\nFor the 2023–24 school year, the school had an acceptance rate of 22%.[9]\n\nAs of the 2021–22 school year, the school had an enrollment of 532 students and 83 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 6.4:1. The school's student body was 41.0% (218) White, 35.0% (186) Asian, 11.3% (60) Black, 7.3% (39) two or more races and 5.5% (29) Hispanic.[2] Peddie had 62% of students in residence. The student body represented 26 states as well as 29 foreign countries. Peddie had an average class size of 12.\n\nPeter Quinn succeeded John Green as head of school in 2013.[10]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nWhat is now The Peddie School was founded in 1864 as the Hightstown Female Seminary, an American Baptist school. Later that year, boys were admitted and it changed its name for the first time, to New Jersey Classical and Scientific Institute. In 1872, it became the Peddie Institute in honor of philanthropist and politician Thomas B. Peddie, who gave the school $25,000 (equivalent to $636,000 in 2023).[11] In 1923, the school was formally renamed The Peddie School.\n\nPeddie remained coeducational until 1908, when, for social and economic reasons, it decided to begin admitting only boys. This decision was reversed in 1970 when girls began to be admitted again. The following year, Peddie's first female African-American student enrolled in the fall term.\n\nBeginning in the 1930s, Peddie began to attract students from other countries including China and Central America. As of 2022, 21% of Peddie's students identified as international, with top countries including China, South Korea, and Canada.\n\nIn 1983, Walter Annenberg, class of 1927, made a gift of $12 million (equivalent to $36.7 million in 2023) to Peddie, the largest donation to a secondary school at the time. Ten years later in 1993, Ambassador Annenberg topped his gift when he made the groundbreaking donation of $100 million (equivalent to $210.9 million in 2023), allowing it to expand its facilities, financial aid, and teachers' compensation and housing; prior to the Annenberg donation, the school's endowment totaled $17 million.[12]\n\nAs of 2022, Peddie's endowment remains at over $450 million.\n\nHeadmasters\n\n[edit]\n\nHeads of school include:\n\nEdgar and Edwin Haas (1865–1868)\n\nHiram A. Pratt (1869–1875)\n\nLaroy F. Griffin (1875–1876)\n\nE. P. Bond (1876–1877)\n\nE. J. Avery (1881)\n\nJohn Greene (1882–1889)\n\nHerbert Ellsworth Slaught (1889–1892)\n\nJoseph E. Perry (1892–1898)\n\nRoger W. Swetland (1898–1934)\n\nWilbour E. Saunders (1935–1949)\n\nCarrol O. Morong (1949–1964)\n\nAlbert L. Kerr (1964–1977)\n\nF. Edward Potter Jr. (1977–1988)\n\nAnne L. Seltzer (1988–1989)\n\nThomas A. Degray (1989–2001)\n\nJohn F. Green (2001–2013)\n\nPeter A. Quinn (2013–present). Announced in February 2024 that he plans to retire in June 2025.[13]\n\nAcademics\n\n[edit]\n\nPeddie uses a trimester program, with the academic year being divided into Fall, Winter, and Spring terms, each consisting of roughly 10 weeks. Classes run from Monday to Saturday, beginning at 8:00 am and ending at 3:10 pm. Wednesdays and Saturdays are half days with students ending at 1:45 pm and 12:15 pm, allowing for more time to contribute to athletics, volunteer work, clubs, and independent studies.\n\nMany courses offered at Peddie are full-year courses, running from Fall to Spring term. Many electives run for one to two terms, allowing students to take multiple different courses throughout the year. The majority of students take five courses each term. A select few students take six or seven courses at a time. Students at Peddie are required to take multiple courses in English, foreign language, mathematics (through precalculus), history, social science, laboratory science, art, and music. Additionally, Peddie students are required to participate in after-school activities throughout the year, including sports, theater productions, volunteer opportunities, and clubs. Students can request to have a course formed if they have a faculty representative and have demonstrated interest in the subject.\n\nPeddie offers 34 subjects for Advanced Placement (AP). In the 2020-2021 school year, 124 students participated in AP classes and exams. The average score on AP exams for a Peddie student is 4.4; 94% of Peddie students scored above a 3 on their AP exams.\n\nSignature Experience\n\n[edit]\n\nPeddie offers a signature experience to all students. The signature experience allows students to pursue their in-depth academic and co-curricular passions. Students begin to design their program during their sophomore year, with them conducting research and traveling during the summer between their junior and senior years. The program allows students to conduct research in any subject they are interested in, including STEM, English, Language, history, writing, and the arts. Many students focused on STEM conduct research in large, university labs, including University of California, Berkeley and Princeton University. Each year, students who participate in STEM-EXP present their research to students in a research fair during their senior year.[14]\n\nAthletics\n\n[edit]\n\nAll students must participate in theater, be on an interscholastic team, or be in one of the elective physical-education classes after school.\n\nThe Ian H. Graham Athletic Center houses a swimming pool; three basketball courts (surrounded by an indoor Tartan track); a wrestling room; an indoor soccer and lacrosse facility with Astroturf, a 2,000-square-foot (190- m²) fitness center with state-of-the-art equipment; a room housing thirty ergometers; and a fully equipped 6-bed training room and sports-medicine center. Outdoor facilities include fourteen tennis courts, eight multipurpose fields, a specially equipped varsity football and lacrosse training field, a softball field, an Olympic-caliber ¼-mile all-weather track, a varsity football and lacrosse field, three baseball fields. The Hovnanian Fields added another six fields, dedicated seasonally to the freshmen and junior varsity soccer and lacrosse teams.\n\nThe Athletic Center holds a replica of the Heisman Trophy donated to the school by Yale University lineman Larry Kelley (Peddie class of 1933), who won it in 1936, the second year in which it was given.\n\nPeddie has its own 18-hole golf course, where the boys' and girls' golf teams compete. The course is a private facility of the Peddie Golf Club, but students and faculty have free access to the greens.\n\nThe school competes in the Mid-Atlantic Prep League, a sports league with participating institutions from preparatory schools in the New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania area.\n\nPeddie is a member of the New Jersey Independent School Athletic Association (NJISAA), competing in the \"Prep 'A'\" division with Lawrenceville School, Hun School of Princeton, Blair Academy, Saint Benedict's Preparatory School and other New Jersey preparatory schools depending on the sport. Peddie has graduates competing at the collegiate level in swimming, wrestling, basketball, track, crew, baseball, softball, soccer, lacrosse, golf, and tennis. The school mascot is the falcon.[3]\n\nThe girls track team won the New Jersey indoor track Non-Public / Prep state championship in 1928 and 1929.[15]\n\nPeddie's arch-rival is Blair Academy, and the two schools compete every year during the second week of November for the Potter-Kelley Cup.[16] The day of the football competition, which alternates yearly between campuses, is known as Blair Day at Peddie (and Peddie Day at Blair). The game between the two schools is the oldest football rivalry in New Jersey and ranks among the oldest in the country.[17][18]\n\nCrew\n\n[edit]\n\nPeddie's crew team was first recognized on the national stage in 1993, when the men's midweight 4+ won a Youth National Championship title in Occaquan, VA. This feat was nearly repeated three years later, with Peddie coming in second in the same event by less than half a second. In 2006, the Peddie Girls' Varsity Four won the United States Youth National Championship, a regatta hosting the strongest club and scholastic teams in the nation. They won again in 2007, defending their U.S. Youth National Regatta title. In 2008, Peddie's Girls' Varsity Four placed third in their division at the Head of the Charles Regatta and returned to the Youth National in Ohio, placing second. The men's varsity four also traveled to Ohio, placing twelve in the Varsity Lightweight Four event. In 2009 the girls and boys returned to the National Championships. The girls regained their first place position, and the men placed sixth in the Petite Final of the Heavyweight Varsity Four. The women then continued on to the Henley Women's Regatta in England, setting a course record on their way to the final and eventually placing second.[19]\n\nSwimming\n\n[edit]\n\nPeddie also boasts a nationally-acclaimed swimming program. Peddie School swimmers (students or alumni) have represented their nations in every Olympics since 1992. The team has won the Swimming World Mythical National Championships eight times, including the inaugural boys' and girls' independent-school titles in 1977 and 1982. The teams in the early 1990s were among the most-dominant high-school swimming programs in history, winning back-to-back boys' and girls' Mythical titles in 1990 and 1991. The 1994-95 team was the only team ever to lead the nation in all six relays. In 2007 both the girls' and boys' teams claimed first place at the Eastern Interscholastic Swimming and Diving Championships held at La Salle University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. During the 2007 championships, Peddie broke three national independent-school records in the girls' relay events. In 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2016 and 2017 the Peddie's boys swim team won the Eastern Interscholastic Swimming and Diving Championships, continuing their success.[20]\n\nThe boys swimming team won the New Jersey Non-Public state championship in 1951.[21]\n\nBasketball\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2010, the girls' basketball team won the ESPN National High School Invitational, defeating Oak Hill Academy by a score of 60-44 in the tournament final and finishing the season with a 25-2 record.[22] From 2000-2010 the girls' basketball program has been ranked one of the top 25 teams in the country seven times. During this same time period, three McDonald's All-Americans played for the Falcons including: Crystal Goring '05 (Richmond), Bridgette Mitchell '06 (Duke) and Haley Peters '10 (Duke).\n\nNotable alumni\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Category:Peddie School alumni\n\nWalter Annenberg (1908-2002; class of 1927), former U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom and founder of TV Guide and Seventeen magazines[23]\n\nRoberto Arias (1918–1989), former Panamanian Ambassador to the United Kingdom[24]\n\nB.
