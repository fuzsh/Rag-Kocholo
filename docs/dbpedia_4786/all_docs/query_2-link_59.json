        "text": "The Oregonian’s resident Duck expert Kevin Goe characterizes U of O’s football season as a disappointment with blood on the hands of its porous defense and an offense that uses lots of smoke and mirrors to hide its deficiencies. Statistics reveal a different story about how Oregon closed out its 2015 campaign.\n\nBy Andrew Pridgen\n\nNine wins a failure?\n\nSix straight to end the season, four of them against ranked teams, not satisfying?\n\n“This Oregon team doesn’t belong in a New Year’s Day bowl game,” Oregonian beat writer Ken Goe postulates in his latest column.\n\nBut the team that barely squeaks by 3-9 South Carolina is a shoo-in for a number-one ranking? The team who beat the team who beat Notre Dame Saturday should be facing 6-6 Indiana instead of 9-3 Michigan?\n\nThe team that walloped the two entrants in the Pac-12 championship game should be watching from home New Year’s Day?\n\nWhate the fucke, Goe?\n\nGoe’s thesis is the Ducks are not worthy to face tier-one bowl competition. I say it’s the opposite: The Ducks are the team nobody wants to face in tier-one bowl competition.\n\nIt’s likely Goe, a Ducks’ football and track beat writer, sunk his incisors into the Ducks Saturday to troll for views. Six hundred-plus comments and 900 shares…not to mention this response by Sunday morning = mission accomplished.\n\nGoe’s Kevin Smithing of his latest column (half-assing it and not giving a shit whether he gets called on it) is disturbing not because I expect a home state columnist to be an apologist, but if he is going to argue against the reason he has a job, he should at least base it on what took place on the field—not the fact that he’s got New Year’s Eve Bingo (<–actual thing) booked at Chinook Winds Casino this year.\n\nWhether he’s guilty of Smithing, Goe certainly did not write like someone who covers the Ducks for a living or has watched much college football, especially Oregon’s brand of it, over the last half-decade.\n\nHe points out that Oregon State, double-digit losers of Friday’s Civil War game at the hands wings of the Ducks, came into Autzen last in the Pac-12 in scoring offense yet managed to put up 42 points. He goes on to expand this argument to a “what if” Oregon were to get a bid to a January 1 bowl against top programs like Baylor, Notre Dame or Michigan.\n\n“Perish the thought,” he wrote.\n\nThough he didn’t go on to write exactly why said thought should be perished.\n\nSo I went ahead and did a little research.\n\nThe Ducks right now are the Adele of college football. Nobody is inexplicably hotter. They are also more fun to watch this time of year than Last Christmas (set to surpass 100 million views this holiday season btw).\n\nThey finished six games over .500 and one game out of national title contention because they play a brand of football that is predicated on uptempo offense. Just as the Golden State Warriors still draw unbelievers because a jump-shooting team isn’t supposed to be sustainable in the NBA, the Ducks draw ire—even from their own backyard beat writers, apparently—for featuring a style of play predicated on rhythm and movement. And when one key set piece goes down and that beat skips a beat, bad things can happen.\n\nIn that respect, Vernon Adams is more jazz drummer than quarterback. When he’s healthy and the offense is clicking they will outscore the opponent, period. When he’s not, the rest of the team seems to be running around off-key unable to find their spacing, pace and tone.\n\nThe effects of Adams’ absence were no more apparent than in the Duck’s three losses:\n\nMichigan State 31, Oregon 28: In East Lansing, Oregon lost by a field goal to the current odds-on favorite to win the CFP championship trophy in January. Adams, who was playing with a broken index finger on his right throwing hand, threw two interceptions but still went 22-of-39 passing for 309 yards. Adams missed Byron Marshall on a wide-open route on the team’s last drive and the game was over. Oregon’s defense surrendered fewer than 200 (197) yards on the ground while limiting likely no. 1 overall pick Connor Cook to 20 of 32 passing for 192 yards with two touchdowns and an interception. Cook was also three-and-out during Michigan State’s last two possessions.\n\nUtah 62, Oregon 20: The nadir of the alt uniform-era Ducks football program and Oregon’s worst loss in a decade. Adams, who started, was playing with that same broken finger. After a couple series he was pulled and backup Jeff Lockie looked confused about which color jersey to pass to. Combined, they finished just 14 of 30 for just 178 yards. Lockie threw a pair of picks and each quarterback had a touchdown. Oregon’s offense never sparked and because of that the defense’s soft targets were exploited by the Utes, especially in the run game. Utah set the pace with 273 yards and two touchdowns on the ground.\n\nWashington State 45, Oregon 38: Oregon suffered a double-overtime loss to Washington State. The Cougs went on to an 8-4 season in spite of a disappointing Apple Cup loss to Washington Friday. Wazzu quarterback Luke Falk threw for season-high 505 yards and five touchdowns as the Cougs vanquished an eight-game losing streak to the Ducks. Adams was out entirely with both Lockie and Eugene native/walk-on Taylor Alie rotating. Lockie looked slightly better than against Utah and threw for 123 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nThe next week, Adams got healthy and Oregon pulled out a victory at Washington and the rest…well, you know.\n\nThe common denominator here isn’t the defense, it’s having a healthy and athletic play caller under center. Goe addresses this, noting the Ducks are 9-3 thanks to “an escape artist at quarterback who can ad-lib a broken play into a ‘SportsCenter’ highlight, and some lucky bounces.”\n\nThis throwaway line is not only disrespectful to Adams’ seamless execution of Scott Frost’s offense, but I’m sort of stuck on the fact that Goe put air quotes around SportsCenter. Is it a euphemism? Like when I’m staying at a Courtyard by Marriott and someone calls me and I say I’m “laying on the bed watching the ‘Golden Girls’.” That’s code for let me call you back in five minutes, I’m about to jerk off before I go down to the lobby and figure out where the nearest PF Changs is.\n\nGoe scribbled this on his Shoebox Christmas Card to Oregon QB Marcus Mariota this time last year: “I believe Mariota is the best college player this season and one of the best I’ve seen in more than three decades in the business. He also is humble, team-oriented, studious and has been a public credit to his university.”\n\nDid Mariota come over and water his plants and pick up his mail while he was on vacation too?\n\nLast year, a healthy Mariota threw for 3,461 yards to Adams’ 2,446 of 2015. That’s about a thousand more. Now consider Mariota had more than 200 more attempts and didn’t nurse a broken hand for seven weeks. Otherwise, the quarterbacks’ stats are strikingly similar: Mariota’s completion rating last year was 68.3 to Adams’ 64.6. Mariota’s rating, touted as among the greats in college football history, was 181.7 to Adams’ 179.6.\n\nNot a very big margin to separate “one of the best in more than three decades” from an “escape artist.”\n\nLook below for a sample of what else the Ducks’ offense, led by a grad transfer Houdini, managed to accomplish this season against a Pac-12 which featured eight ranked teams at one point and five ranked to end the season:\n\nPac-12 offensive leaders:\n\nQuarterback Rating:\n\nVernon Adams – 179.6\n\nRushing Yards:\n\nRoyce Freeman – 1,706\n\nTotal Offense:\n\nOregon – 6,578 (548 yards/game)\n\nRushing:\n\nOregon – 3,473 (6.1 per carry)\n\nFirst Downs:\n\nOregon – 313\n\n“That there are a million things to fix on this defense should be disconcerting for a team with one game left to play,” Goe wrote, building off head coach Mark Helfrich’s comment that there are a “million things” the Ducks can clean up before their late-December appearance, likely to take place in the basement of the Alamo.\n\nBut are there? Or was Helfrich overdoing his usual overdone self-deprecation act? A closer look reveals Oregon’s defense was more transitioning and inconsistent than bad enough to pillory. Oregon finished the regular season seventh in the league in solo tackles but first in sacks; near the bottom of the league in passes defended (35) and near the top with interceptions (13). Deforest Buckner was one of the dominant D linemen in the country and a midseason overhaul featuring a quartet of young DBs still learning on the job defined the secondary: Tyree Robinson moved to cornerback after starting the first five games at safety. Charles Nelson moved from wide receiver to safety. And first-year starter sophomores Juwaan Williams and Arrion Springs improved steadily in the season’s second half.\n\nAt this point, I agree it does seem like an unfair fight against the Baylors, Michigans and Notre Dames. To paraphrase Rod Tidwell, Oregon smokes all these fools.\n\nIf Goe’s column was anything, it was premature anointing those three week 13 losers before their time.\n\nBut that’s not where Goe’s position ultimately fails. As the Ducks’ beat writer for the largest publication in the state of Oregon, he has a responsibility to report the truth—or at least base his opinions on it. Nobody in any other part of the world is going to study and critique the Ducks with more veracity. And nobody is better qualified to tout the strengths of a program that overcame early season inconsistency and injuries to finish on such a high note.\n\nNobody has the kind of platform Goe has.\n\nSo to waste it on knee-jerk opinion over fact; to favor hand-wringing over high fives, just doesn’t seem an appropriate way recognize a team that started 3-3 and got better every game from there.\n\nOr to put it another way: Would a SEC, B1G or ACC beat writer critique their representative institutions using the same kind of platitudes? No.\n\n…Maybe that’s why they’ll will be working tier-one bowl games in January.\n\nImage: Oregon Daily Emerald\n\nWhen I went to sleep Sunday all my friends were in Dallas. When I woke up Monday I was still at home and they were all having breakfast beers on Facebook and smiling with their mouths wide open the way people do in pictures now.\n\nWhen I got out of bed game day morning, I forgot to pack my work laptop so I got halfway out of town before I had to turn back to get it.\n\nBy mistake, I dropped my highlighter yellow Oregon sweatshirt in a puddle while getting my son out of the car for daycare and I couldn’t wear it to work. And I always wear my highlighter yellow Oregon sweatshirt on big game days.\n\nI could tell it was going to be a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad game.\n\nWhen I was eating my Clif bar at my desk a co-worker walked by with a sausage McMuffin with egg and even though I don’t like those, the whole room started to smell like delicious McDonald’s breakfast which is what 1994 smells like and that was a good year. I decided I would go to McDonald’s and get one but instead a meeting reminder email popped up on my computer and it was a meeting I hadn’t even prepared for—which is why I took my laptop home in the first place the previous night.\n\nI think I’ll move to Dallas.\n\nIn the meeting, Candace let Bob and Natalie sit close to the phone in the middle of the conference table so the client could hear them and they didn’t even have anything to say. I was scrunched in the back next to a couple engineers who were there only because it was on the way to the kitchen. I said the client wouldn’t be able to hear me if I was so far away but nobody, not even people in the room, heard me at all.\n\nI could tell it was going to be a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad game.\n\nBack at my desk, I posted a picture of me from a game I went to in October drinking beer and wearing my highlighter yellow Oregon sweatshirt. But Sam and Dan and Rick and Mike posted pictures of themselves wearing shorts and flip flops drinking beers in a giant parking lot outside the actual stadium before the actual game. So people liked those pictures a whole lot more and could tell mine was old. My mom liked it and someone I didn’t even know I was friends with the name Raj liked it, but that’s it. I took it down. Sam and Dan and Rick and Mike’s pictures got like almost 100 likes each.\n\nWhen the coffee truck rolled up outside work they said the credit card machine was broken. Matt only had enough cash for himself and Jonathan and he already owed Jonathan a coffee so I didn’t get any.\n\nI could tell it was going to be a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad game.\n\nBack at my desk, I turned Facebook off but then my phone started blowing up with texts. In movies, most friend texts say encouraging things or at least things like “what’s up” or “thinking of you xo.” But my friends’ texts say stuff like “you’re a fucking asshole” and “hope you’re having fun at work and not being at the game you piece of” and then an emoji of poo by it.\n\nThis happened over and over and over again. And over and over and over again and Sam and Dan and Rick and Mike kept running into more people and drinking more beers and posting more pictures and so I said in a group text next time you take off work and leave your families behind I hope someone shakes up your beer and it explodes in your face.\n\nI was going to go to Taco Bell for lunch because I still had a fast food craving from the morning but I had pizza leftovers in the fridge from last week that needed to get eaten and 10 minutes between meetings so I ate that instead and got a stomach ache which resulted in me having to get up during the meeting to go to the bathroom. And everyone knows if you have to get up during a meeting, especially one right after lunch, it’s to go number two.\n\nIt was going to be a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad game.\n\nThat’s what it was, because after work the game was starting at 5:30 and I got home plenty early to help change the baby and get his food ready because he has to eat baby food instead of wings and onion rings. But getting him ready takes forever. So long that I could’ve flown to Dallas and back.\n\nWhen we finally got there, Oregon had already scored (good!) but then Ohio State scored a bunch right back and their running back who was wearing a half-tee like Stan Gable in Revenge of the Nerds was going everywhere and Oregon receivers were deciding to get nervous for the first time all season and drop passes like I drop groceries coming out of Trader Joe’s. My buddy Jerry turned to me and said maybe this isn’t their year.\n\nNext year, I said, I’m going to Dallas.\n\nBy halftime I started crying and trying to make myself feel better by making fun of other people at the bar. The baby and his mother decided they’d heard enough so they packed up and went home and left me there to cry and try to talk shit some more. My buddy Mark texted me to tell me to take a shot and I said I don’t want to take a shot but he said take a shot and I said I shouldn’t and he said he did and I should because it’ll be good luck.\n\nSo I took a shot and told the bartender that I was having a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad game. But she didn’t listen.\n\nIn the second half, Ohio State kept scoring and the stadium full of Ohio State’s fans kept roaring and everyone who didn’t go to school with me in Oregon kept texting me asking if “white and camo” were Oregon’s school colors when I went there and I didn’t think it was funny. Not at all.\n\nI walked home from the bar during the fourth quarter because I remembered everyone was mad at me and I wanted to say sorry before bed and maybe catch the last 10 minutes on my couch because I’m undefeated when the Ducks play and I’m watching from the couch and maybe I could catch the Rose Ceremony too—but it was too late.\n\nFour Weddings and a Funeral was on instead and Hugh Grant looks really young, surprisingly fresh as if he’s not yet done with school, in it and it was the funeral scene where the WH Auden poem is read by the guy who looks like he’s in the Pet Shop Boys and that all just gets me. So I watched the score pile up against the Ducks online while I got drunk-sad during the funeral part of the movie and drank water because I knew I’d have a headache in the morning.\n\nI didn’t even want to watch the game anymore because the whole time the stadium made me dizzy and queasy because it looked like the inside of a giant airport terminal or a Best Buy but with dim lighting and all I could think of was all the people who’d be soon leaving and how empty it would be on Tuesday, This big, empty, giant shell where passes get dropped and half-tees come back and the bets I made for Oregon to win by seven and more than 73 points get scored combined go to die.\n\nIt was a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad game.\n\nWhen I went to bed I was already having a headache and nobody liked my sad Facebook post about how teams who don’t wear their own colors don’t deserve to win national championships and the nightlight in the bathroom went out so I stubbed my toe on the scale when I went to pee.\n\nI forgot to brush my teeth and I had bar burp breath. It was a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad game.\n\nMy mom says some games are like that. Even in Dallas.\n\nIn a blind mad rush to further commoditize and professionalize amateur sport, we’ve taken college football, destroyed it with the BCS and then shit all over those ruins with the playoff system.\n\nPrior to the playoff system, bowl games were decided by the Associated Press and UPI polls, an assemblage of writers and coaches. Bowl games were set with the rankings and tradition in mind. Each year, without controversy, a national champion was crowned.\n\nFrom 1936 to 1997 the two polls at the end of the season didn’t mesh 11 times—an 85 percent success rate over six decades. So what if there were multiple champions crowned? That just meant more than one team had a really great bowl game and claim to a share of the title.\n\nIn the decade and a half of the BCS, there was controversy over the eventual taker-homer of the big giant football crystal ashtray EVERY year of its existence.\n\nThat’s a 100-percent failure rate.\n\nThis year’s four-team College Football Playoff™ playoff with the new upside-down-unicorn-horn-which-blooms-into-a-football-vagina-on-top trophy is merely a re-branding of the BCS’s unfulfilled wishes.\n\nThe playoff’s participants are all 10 conferences, as well as the FBS Independents (yes, they capitalize the ‘i’—whatever, they’re not the College Football Grammarians™) like Notre Dame and BYU. The new entity which represents the schools is called the CFP Administration, LLC. Nobody knows much about this corporation other than that it’s based in Irving, Texas and it’s a company that makes money off college football; so they’re kind of like a bookie, but legal.\n\nThe College Football Playoff™ site (which I think my cousin registered in like 1998) also lists a Board of Managers, Management Committee, Counsel and College Football Playoff staff as deciders in “the execution of the playoff.” Spoiler alert: apparently they kill the playoff at the end.\n\nThe computer which helps tally the results is pretty much the same—think of the BCS as the Craigslist of rankings devices: Janky, yet the only thing out there pretty much. The key voters/committee members also make up the Board of Managers and the Management Committee and the Counsel and College Football Playoff staff are pretty much the same. See: sexagenarians whose wealth of experience is likely only matched by present-day inefficiencies and hang-ups (Tom Osborne? Check. Mike Tranghese? Check. Pat Haden? Check. Tom Jernstedt? Check. Archie Manning? Check.) Oh, and Condi Rice is in too so the class photo isn’t all Haggar slacks and Cialis bathtubs.\n\nAnd the format is the same. Only now, the two finalists get a pair of marquee bowl match-ups instead of one = $$$ for those schools along with the LLC.\n\nThe number four-ranked team will face number one and number two will face number three at the Rose Bowl and Sugar Bowl on Jan. 1. The final will be Jan. 12 at the Dallas Cowboys’ AT&T stadium and then Arizona the next year then Tampa then back to Texas or whatever.\n\nA look at the brief and tortured history of the BCS reveals the problems never arose from the teams in bowl games from the one through four slots—they came from everywhere else: Bowls skipping over worthy schools and bidding others with more money, bigger alumni bases or a conference cache; big-program coaches launching campaigns for their schools to leapfrog or upend smaller-conference challengers with better records; coaches forced to run up the score to mesh with the computer’s algorithm for purported excellence and idle schools leapfrogging schools who lost their conference championships—penalties for playing in to a playoff.\n\nThat’s exactly what’s happening this year, but with potentially more big players getting left out.\n\nIf the final four were announced today, it would go something like this: No. 2 Oregon would play no. 3 Florida State and in a please-wake-me-when-its-over moment for the entire nation save for one very red region east of Biloxi, no. 1 Alabama would play no. 4 Mississippi State. At least this prohibits an all-SEC final and the ratings Hindenburg of 2012: Alabama 21, LSU 0 …thirteen people watched the game in its entirety and that’s because the hotel bar remote at the Shreveport Homewood Suites was broken.\n\nThis leaves out one-loss TCU, Baylor and Ohio State—all of whom deserve to be dancing as much as the current top-four (we’re especially looking at you Florida State and the rest of the ACC’s ability to supremely fold in the second half). Small-conference but can-play-with-anyone Colorado State with one loss and undefeated Marshall would also prove the new LLC includes all conferences in name only.\n\nBut then it gets more complicated from there.\n\nWhat if, say, UCLA—who’s playing the best football in the country over the last five games—were to beat Oregon in the Pac-12 championship on Dec. 5? With two-losses, should QB Hundley and his ability to put up 250 yards passing on anyone in a half plus a maturing O-line and stifling D, be left out? Should Oregon and the eventual Heisman winner automatically drop from relevance and never be heard from again, cancelled out by a division rival they couldn’t take two from on the road?\n\nHow about if Ohio State lost to Wisconsin in the B1G championship game Dec. 6? Both teams would end up with two-loss seasons and similarly drift into college football’s abyss because they didn’t have schools like Southern Miss, UAB, South Alabama, Kentucky, UTM or Vanderbilt (Mississippi State) or Florida Atlantic, Southern Miss or Western Carolina (Alabama) on their tough-as-nails SEC dance cards.\n\nWhat if two-loss Georgia, Georgia Tech, Michigan State, Kansas State, Arizona, Arizona State, Boise State and Missouri were to win out? Georgia and Missouri are SEC schools and yet they don’t seem to command the same respect as Alabama, Mississippi State, Auburn, Ole Miss or LSU. What if Bama loses to Auburn and Mississippi State loses to Ole Miss to deliver four two-loss SEC teams?\n\nHell, what if Missouri beats Arkansas at home in the season finale and wins the SEC championship by taking down Bama at the Georgia Dome Dec. 6? Should there be an ALL SEC final four? Surely Clay Travis who fake goes to tailgates and fake talks about football while he fake writes a blog for Fox would think so.\n\nWould anyone else?\n\nPlayoffs aren’t about who’s on the cover of SI at the beginning of the season. It’s not about who won last year. It’s not about Nick Saban. It’s about who’s healthy and dealing the hot hand at crunch time. It’s the separation between who’s exhausted and falling asleep at the wheel and who’s going to ride with the gas light on for four more exits or until there’s a McDonald’s at the same off-ramp. Who can, in the course of a single drive, one big play, one step on the secondary, change the events as they should be written and re-write (if not re-right) the course of history. Playoffs are wild cards and underdogs and Cinderella breaking it down in front of the DJ booth, both arms in the air, make-up running and feet blistered and bleeding as she screams along with Violent Femmes Taylor Swift into the morning light.\n\nBut a two-game playoff is none of that. It is a semi-final and a final. It’s the Williams sisters walking into Wimbledon and drawing one another in the first round. It’s Michael never having to face Isiah to get to Stockton. It’s Tiger and Lefty roshambo’ing for the first three rounds and teeing off in sudden death. It’s nobody showing up to claim the bronze in pairs figure skating. It’s being left off the e-vite because the former Secretary of State caught tails instead of heads (how do you think we went to war with Iraq?)\n\nI’m not the only one thinks a two-game playoff can’t hide an at-best unsustainable and at worst criminally flawed system that colludes the NCAA with its biggest football brands. There are others. “If we’re going to go anywhere,” former Big 12 commissioner Dan Beebe told the New York Times at the start of the season, “I’d rather go back to the old bowl system.”\n\nUntil there’s one representative from each of the 10 conferences plus two at-large wild-card teams for a 12-team, four-week playoff, (the one through four seeds get a first-round bye) the old bowl system and its 85-percent success rate is still the undisputed champion of college football.\n\nEach week DPB’s Kyle Magin and Andrew J. Pridgen will pour on the prose with Pints and Picks™. Who to wager and what to drink while doing it. Here then, is their point-counterpoint for Nov. 8, 2014. Or, if you’re in the car, simply scroll down for the recap (they may be verbose, but it’s better than clicking through a slideshow).\n\nAJ: Whoooooa Boy KM, big weekend ahead.\n\nBefore I get into my picks on possibly the best match-up weekend of the 2014 season and the only one with any influence on this fake semi-final/final four-team ‘playoff’ thing—I will tease with the fact that all my match-ups will be of the marquee variety (not the Magin dregs betting) this week.\n\nI will feature:\n\nBama and LSU\n\nOregon and Utah\n\nTCU and K State\n\nNotre Dame and ASU\n\nand\n\nMichigan State and OSU\n\nTo kick things off, however, I’m going to (surprise!) take a detour down a more personal road.\n\nSaturday is my ‘return to racing.’ I know this sounds very Armstrongean or Bondsean, but it’s not meant to be.\n\nI’ve been on about a 9-month hiatus from throwing a bib on and trying to get after it as an angry and ever-so-noticeably above varsity weight age-grouper. I’m not one of those guys who’s all sinew and likes cutting pro women off on the road bike, rooty trail or open water to make myself feel like I’ve got more hair on my shaved head than the crop circles that are left.\n\nBut there’s something about race day. About the weight-shifting interminable time in line for the port-a-potty and the glorious pre-race deposit. The cold sweat that collects on your palms and fingertips as the starting line is toe’d. That expectant but shrill and surprising clap of the gun and those initial steps, all nerves and knobby knees and “I’m not only not going to put up a personal best, but I’m not going to finish.”\n\nGetting excited for something difficult, something that pushes out of the comfort zone, out of sleep, out of conformity, is certainly an underrated experience in today’s spiffy culture. If you can’t swipe it with your index finger, why bother?\n\nI’m not the only one who feels this way. American’s spending on organized road and trail runs, triathlons and endurance races has increased more than 10-fold over the last decade. The largest road race, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution Peachtree 10k, drew almost 56k participants last year. That’s a small city of runners. The ING New York City Marathon eclipsed 50k last weekend and that’s turning away more than 80 percent of the applicants.\n\nSo there is something there in all of us. Something that says we’re looking to push—just a little bit—and see what happens. Something we need to share with a group taking the hard road to Point B.\n\nThis weekend I’m making an easy entrance back into my age group in the Santa Barbara half-marathon. It’s a seaside course that’s relatively flat and fast. Earlier this year, it became pretty clear I wasn’t going to eclipse my Santa Barbara Marathon time from two years ago (I blame the six-month-old who sleeps in the room next to me and can say “Da!” a bunch of times in a row), so I decided why not make it back with a fast half. (Technically my ‘return to racing’ was codified at this year’s Squaw Mountain Run, but that was more an off-the-couch effort in the wake of getting up 4x/night for feeding; my mulligan.)\n\nThis is the first time I’ve felt at least somewhat race-ready in more than a year. And I just want to give a quick shout out, because I rarely use this space to thank her, to Robin Sims, who was sliced in half six months ago and could not get out of the hospital bed for three days while she tried to cope with the stress of not only being a new mother, but having to handle me as a new father. Trust me when I say the latter was certainly the most disconcerting.\n\nShe has been patient and relaxed and, above all things, dedicated to getting back on the road and the trail as life screamed and cried and pooped around us. She has stuck to a feeding and training and work schedule that would take three of me to ponder and four to fail at, and has done so with strength and ease and nary a breakdown. I don’t tell her ever how proud of her I am. A mother and a runner, and damn good at both. When we race, we all race as individuals, but I am so so very lucky to be on her team come Saturday.\n\nOk KM, this means I will have a race recap next week, but till then, I pass the baton to you and ask, will you accept the week 10 marquee-pick challenge?\n\nKyle: AJ, I’ll join you on most of those picks, but I’m far too fond of rooting around through forgotten leagues and sports in search of gems to give up on the Okie-style noodling that informs my weekly choices. One man’s trash.\n\nThat said, you’re exactly right that this is as meaningful a weekend in the CFB season as we’ve yet seen. I’ve left this conversation once or twice thinking we’ve put lipstick on a pig, but this week I’m trying to keep myself from pre-game hype video-level platitudes. I’m going to break down the following:\n\nOSU and MSU\n\nK. State and TCU\n\nBama and LSU\n\nUtah St. and Wyoming\n\nand\n\nB. Hopkins vs. S. Kovalev\n\nFor people who haven’t been paying attention, OSU-MSU is a real, proper grudge match.\n\nWhen I was a kid OSU was a bit of an anomaly in the Big Ten. Even more than Michigan, which was just as (arguably more from year-to-year while John Cooper was in Columbus) nationally relevant at the time. The Buckeyes had a bit of cool about them. They recruited Florida guys, had some of the biggest badasses on the block (see Boston, David), and by the time the millennium turned over were a coast-to-coast style superpower in a way that nobody else in the league was. It bred an arrogance even the turned-up noses in Ann Arbor didn’t deign to show: We’re above you, our peers are Miami and USC and Notre Dame. Fuck your rust belt.\n\nIronically, under Urban Meyer, the Bucks feel a little more home-grown. Whether it was the sanctions or the pantsing administered by the Spartans in the B1G title game last year to thwart their march toward the title, OSU has turned their animosities inward. Side-light rivalries against MSU and Penn State have taken on added significance for the crimson n’ cream crowd. They suddenly seem cognizant of the search for respect everyone else in the league is constantly going through–sorta like the hot chick who stayed behind while everyone else left for college and began to realize her insights into the latest Kardashian news wasn’t so valuable to a peer group who no longer worshiped at the altar of her feet.\n\nThis new awareness has manifested itself nicely in a rivalry between Meyer and Michigan State’s Mark Dantonio. Meyer entered the league stealing everyone’s recruits—Dantonio’s included–and it felt like sweet payback when Dantonio upended Meyer’s 2013 season in Indianapolis. Suddenly the Bucks had to deal with the locals again. With an early-season loss to Virginia Tech that looks worse by the week, Ohio State has been forced to find its salvation within the conference, and that combination of desperation and levity is making for a much more intriguing match-up. It’s about kids from my side of the Toledo strip against kids from your side getting into the trenches (and what will likely be some freezing-ass weather Saturday night in East Lansing) and going toe-to-toe. I’m excited.\n\nAlright, I’ll dig into the number on this and the rest after throwing it back to you, AJ.\n\nAJ: KM, since we’re giving props all over this entry’s face this week (and really the readership on PNP is a loyal quorum so basically, especially after the second graph, anything goes; see: Week 9’s Pat Burrell story not causing any semblance of a kurfuffle), I want to kind of focus on the Oregon/Utah match-up before I check down the rest.\n\nI was living/working in the Beehive State when Utah received a fistful of tokens to run free in the Pac-12 arcade in 2010. At the time, I knew the U of U as a commuter school where all the kids from South Jordan or Sandy or Centerville Wards tried hard not to drip their zit cream onto your Jimmy John’s and call it dressing. It’s a dry campus with a salty pizza parlor and the best burger joint ever. And a lot of blond girls who are just not, um, discriminating enough to want to go to BYU.\n\nI made it pretty clear to my U of U alum friends, all drunk off three 3.2 beers at The Republican (or the Tavernacle—actual bar, just a half block from the big Mormon thingy where hot girls from all over the world approach you and try to get you to join and wear their special underwear) that BYU should’ve gotten the invite. Better sports history, period. Prettier campus and, well, Provo is the one true level playing field for visiting teams with no, um, temptations at night (or are there?) …In fact, I think the Cougs would’ve paired perfectly with the still-dormant Colorado Buffalo, while the U was not quite ready for prime time.\n\nThankfully, I was proven wrong as the Utes have blossomed into a football and potential basketball powerhouse and are drawing athletic and academic talent from the West Coast. Who wouldn’t want to go to school 20 minutes from the best stashes (not ‘staches) in the West. Yes, Utah is the greatest snow on Earth™ (apologies to your Sierra backyard KM).\n\nAnyone who’s thinking that there’s not enough fun to be had on a 36-hour SLC smack down for a visiting team is w-r-o-n-g. Sure SLC’s best bar still has dueling pianos and you have to drink old and poorly stored Deschutes out of a bottle if you want to cop a buzz before your fifth trip to the baño, but there’s so so much to do, including:\n\n• Red Iguana. Think you’ve had a good mole, think again—yes, it’s worth the wait. Believe the hype.\n\n• Epic Brewing. High-point beer but made with care. Not just the big, hoppy IPAs they shove down your gullet in the Bay Area or Pac NW. Ditto Uinta for better-than-good local craft brews.\n\n• Decades Vintage Shop. Sure you’ve been to Haight Street and DUMBO and you’ve passed up every ironic shirt (or paid $75 for a vintage PBR Beefy Tee). Go check out Decades. It’s like going back to the ’90s thrift stores (when they actually had vintage clothes from the ’70s). Their buyers are discerning and since much of Utah cleans its closets out only once every three decades, you’ll be the benefactor. Last time I stopped by, I got a Western shirt that would make a Cash roadie cry, a Leisure Suit fit for a Furley and a vintage Rambo: First Blood T-shirt (size XL which fit me like a child’s medium—but oh well) for under $40. Hipster bliss.\n\n• The Depot or Kilby Court. LOTS of bands have to stop and get gas and a burrito in SLC en route from SF to Denver or Denver to Portland. Take advantage of these incredible little venues. You’ll be able to say you saw ______ with 18 of your closest maybe-Mormon friends when they’re headlining the second stage at Coachella or Outside Lands in two years.\n\nIf you go, please also look up my favorite Utahn Jeremy Pugh. Jeremy grew up Mormon and then decided against it and has been drinking and writing and pontificating with erratic vengeance to make up for it ever since. He’s down to go out and to talk about physics or Louis CK’s first show (the one on HBO nobody remembers but was genius) or cats or karate or the time he blacked out during a Dylan show at Deer Valley and woke up making snow angels in a sand trap four miles away on a Park City golf course. He gets whatever movie reference you throw at him but isn’t the annoying bro who has to quote it back, though he can quote Gilmore Girls. He has incredible stories about terrible women and their violent exes that are compelling enough to make you want to buy him another round as his voice goes up an octave and hiswordsruntogetherfornoreason. He gets really hungover and still goes skiing. He shaves and grows his beard back in a day. He’ll show up with an extra Egg McMuffin for you. He writes beautifully but only when he’s not trying and, like most good writers, his best stuff comes out in conversation and you can see him trying to remember it as he’s saying it—but he never does. He moved to Hawaii and got too tan and too relaxed and not frustrated enough, so he had to move back to Utah. He underestimates his value but has never, ever made life less fun when he’s in the room. All this and he finds time to tweet about Yurts—fuck yeah.\n\nIn other words, he’s 100 percent Utah. More Utah than Johnny Utah. And I like that. And yes, 100-percent Utah means hospitality. You could knock on Jeremy’s door this Saturday and say you read about him here and 12 hours later …in Wendover, he’d still be bleary-eyed asking you if you want him to buy another round.\n\nOK, as far as the game goes, the Utes, who I believe could still take it to three of the top four SEC teams (looking at you Mississippi, Auburn and Bama) at home, showed a chink in their armor against P-12 South rival ASU and that is, they can play fast (Fresno State) or they can play physical (Michigan), but they can’t play fast and physical.\n\nLast week the usually venerable Utes offense was held to 241 yards against ASU’s strong and tough D. Oregon has shown their front five is just as hungry and their DBs are slightly quicker than the Sun Devils. The ground game went missing from the Utes playbook in early October and unless Devontae Booker can establish himself quickly, it’s pretty much going to come down to see how long it takes for the pocket to collapse on Mariota. With three seconds, he can do a lot of damage in the air or on the ground as he’s poised to re-iginte the Olympic torch and break 200 rushing yards and 1,500 passing at Rice-Eccles.\n\nTake the Ducks -8 and remember, Brighton and Solitude are already turning and @saltlakeeditor is always down for whatever. Win. Win. Win.\n\nKyle: AJ, I work in a BYU-alum owned-and-operated 9-5. Yours are the only positive words I hear about the U on a regular basis–I think its position in Utah’s ‘gentile belt’ may malign its reputation in these parts. I find that my BYU acquaintances only really get riled about three things—the president, basketball and the Utes. The prez trounced their boy, Jimmer Fredette can’t get good NBA minutes even though he’s as effective as Ray Allen any more, and Utes fans say awful things to the Cougars faithful when the Holy War is in Salt Lake. That’s the sum total of their gripes with the world, and while I really appreciate the lack of complaining, they really put their all into those slights.\n\nUtah State, out in the boons of Logan, seems to escape their ire. It’s where you go when your old man isn’t in tight with a bishop, it’s not always an athletic equal to the programs in Provo, and it’s apparently constantly 10 degrees there, so I guess the cold encourages piousness. (Freshman receiver Gregory Weichers—the product of a BYU alum–may have blown up that end of the narrative yesterday, though.)\n\nAnyway, I like to check in on the Aggies from time to time because they play some of the stoutest defense in the west and have been known to throw serious kinks in the Utes and Cougs’ seasons. This year, though, they’re playing a sort of front-runner instead of spoiler narrative.\n\nUtah State -6.5 @ Wyoming\n\nThe Aggies (6-3, 3-1 MW) take on the Pokes (4-5, 2-3 MW) in hopes of staying alive in the MW’s Mountain division. The top three teams on that side of the bracket–it’s the class of the league–all have one loss; USU, Boise St. and Colorado St. USU still has Boise in its sights and while it lost head-to-head against the CSU Rams–who have a pretty cake schedule from here on out–they’re still very much in the hunt for the league’s title game. With gametime temps expected to be just about freezing in Laramie (I suspect it’s always just about freezing in Laramie. That Matthew Sheppard movie looked like the coldest goddamn cinema experience since The Day After Tomorrow), I’d look for the Ags’ top 25 defense to bottle up any Cowboys attack and give their offense a short field to work with all night. USU to cover.\n\nKansas State +6 @ TCU\n\nKSU’s Bill Snyder is probably the last really wily sonofabitch in college football. He has zero polish with the media and appears to win recruiting battles nobody else is fighting with him. Yet, year-in-and-year-out, he’s a thorn in the Big 12’s side and a darkhorse national contender. His offense isn’t overly impressive when it comes to yardage totals in either the rushing or passing games, but they seem to always have a short field to work with and have converted 100 percent of their Big 12 chances in the red zone for scores this year. They convert 50 percent of their third downs overall but manage to hold their opponents to just 39 percent. To top it all off, Snyder’s bunch is 2-0 against the spread on the road this season. TCU is good, if not great, at everything. But, the Horned frogs are giving up an average of more than 40 points over their last five games, and had a hell of a time last week with a West Virginia squad that doesn’t have nearly the defense that’ll step off the bus from Manhattan this week. I like Snyder’s boys to keep it within a touchdown.\n\nBernard Hopkins 5/2 by decision vs. Sergey Kovalev\n\nVegas again likes Bernard Hopkins just a little less than it likes his opponent, Sergey Kovalev (7-2 by decision). A bet the Krusher’s way probably isn’t terrible–you can actually get some fairly good numbers on him knocking out the Alien. But, if this thing goes the distance and it’s close, the cards are most definitely going BHop’s way. He’s the name. The Atlantic City crowd will be heavily behind the Philly boxer’s campaign Saturday. And, almost nobody knows how to make a round look like it’s going his way than Hopkins, who couldn’t knock out one of those fainting goats but can connect with enough of his light blows to register on a judge’s scorecard.\n\nAlabama @ LSU +6.5\n\nThe Bayou Bengals’ defense is truly, truly filthy. Opponents have reached LSU’s end zone just 17 times this season and convert less than 30 percent of their third down tries. #3 Ole Miss was abused two weeks ago in Baton Rouge, managing just a touchdown, and the Tigers are 6-1 against the spread at home, 7-2 overall this season. True enough, at 7-1, the Tide are still firmly in the playoff hunt and not likely to pull any punches Saturday. That said, I’d look for Les Miles’ squad to keep it close.\n\nOSU @ MSU Under 56\n\nIt’s going to be bone-chillingly cold and probably wet in East Lansing Saturday night. The Spartans’ defense isn’t quite what it was last year, but almost all of the dings against it have come on big plays through the air. The Buckeyes’ passing attack is far from vaunted which’ll keep this thing on the ground at Spartan Stadium. The Spartan defense hasn’t given up more than 22 points at home this season. I look for a low-scoring affair.\n\nAlright AJ, get your bad luck out of the way pre-race…\n\nAJ: Oh, me again? Sorry, I was dreaming of Crown Burger.\n\nWe’re in novella territory here so I’ll be giving you the rest my picks in a voice inspired by the writing of James Franco.\n\nAlabama @ LSU +6.5\n\nI think Dennis Quaid in that movie about LSU (with Jessica Lange and John Goodman) and the points are enough for me to take the Tigers over the Crimson Tide. Crimson Tide reminds me of Prince of Tides, even though I know they’re two different things.\n\nKansas State +6 @ TCU\n\nThese are two places I’ve never been and will probably never go. I bet when you watch porn that’s supposed to be in a dorm room but is really in an abandoned Quiznos near Torrance, it’s inspired by one of these schools. Why is there a Kansas State? Did someone actually not get in to Kansas? Take them and the points to find out.\n\nASU -1 vs. Notre Dame\n\nYou know those ads that look like hot chicks in mugshots that always pop up? Arizona State has most of those girls. They’ll win by three touchdowns on Saturday.\n\nMichigan State -2 vs. OSU\n\nI can’t tell if this is a game between two important one-loss teams or one important one-loss team and just another team. I think it’s the second one. If that’s the case, Michigan State has already won.\n\nThe PnP Recap:\n\nLast week:\n\nAJ: 2-4\n\nKyle: 3-4\n\nOverall:\n\nAJ: 18 for 31\n\nKyle: 16 for 23\n\nThis week:\n\nAJ:\n\n• Oregon @ Utah -8\n\n• Alabama @ LSU +6.5\n\n• Kansas State +6 @ TCU\n\n* ASU -1 vs. Notre Dame\n\n• Michigan State -2 vs. OSU\n\nKyle:\n\n• Utah State -6.5 @ Wyoming\n\n• Kansas State +6 @ TCU\n\n• Bernard Hopkins 5/2 by decision vs. Sergey Kovalev\n\n• OSU @ MSU Under 56\n\n• Alabama @ LSU +6.5\n\nEach week DPB’s Kyle Magin and Andrew J. Pridgen will pour on the prose with Pints and Picks™. Who to wager and what to drink while doing it. Here then, is their point-counterpoint for Oct. 25, 2014. Or, if you’re in the car, simply scroll down for the recap (they may be verbose, but it’s better than clicking through a slideshow).\n\nAJ: Two words for you this week KM: Hunter Motherfuckingstrickland.\n\nThat guy, man. He’s the Nuke LaLoosh in real-time just blowing up all over the mound like a soaking wet piñata in game two of the world series. Not ONLY did he give up an MLB-record fifth bomb in the postseason Tuesday but he did it with such passion that he had to start jawing …at that guy who’d just roped a double off him. By the time the guy who went yard crossed the plate, he was out of the game. Talk about premature extrapolation.\n\nBut I really don’t care that he talked a little (a lot) of smack. He’s 26 and I did a lot of stupidly awesome stuff when I was 26 (swimming out to the Pirate Ship in Las Vegas’ Treasure Island moat comes to mind—I had a weird rash on my side for months). It’s an age of passion and testosterone and bad decisions especially when dollar beers and a game my buddies made up called “dare darts” is involved. So, that’s cool. I get it.\n\nAll I can say, is thank god camera phones were invented in my 30s (actually, boo for no camera phones till my 30s).\n\nWhat I do have a problem with is Strickland trying to get that 97mph/no movement Babe Ruth stuff over the plate expecting Junior year results. Again and again and again and again …and again. Shaking off Buster and ignoring Rags is not the way to engender yourself to the franchise. I’d almost rather throw the actual Danny McBride out there and take my chances. At least it’d be funny haha not sad/funny.\n\nSo HS, if you want to pound six Buds at a time like your team’s ace, then earn it on the field. Till then, bite that lower lip and take it out on your iPad in the hotel room.\n\n*Deep breath*. Now, because I’m gonna save the rant for someone who’ll listen (meaning, I’ve got some long training runs coming up this weekend and am going to try to keep my internal dialogue just that) and come at you with a couple of six packs this week.\n\nThe (first three) of my six-pack:\n\nBYU +6 @ Boise State:\n\nBYU’s been on the skids since week three, but Boise State, even on the Smurf turf is a shadow of its former self. I think instead of the over/under being 56.5 it should be 88 percent Mormons in the stands. It’ll be the fake-nicest game in the West. But I do believe BYU has the speed and the secondary to pick of BSU this time. Take the Cougs and the points.\n\nOregon @ Cal (at Levi’s Stadium) O/U 77:\n\nI’m back on my Cal-and-the-over train. Cal’s secondary is worst in the Pac 12 and with a healthy left guard, Marcus seems to be spreading the Aloha around again. I would take Oregon -16 but Helfrich has shown he closes worse than your best friend from high school at 1:40 a.m. So, Cal will cinch it up in garbage time.\n\nOregon State +13.5 @ Stanford:\n\nWhy is Stanford getting a bigger benefit of the doubt than JK Rowling pitching a story about clowns in prison? Moneyline here. OSU is faster and better than their record suggests and the Cardinal is a half-step slower and two wins better than theirs.\n\nOK KM, before you take your turn, I just want to say you’ve been sneakily and disarmingly hotter than Lily from the AT&T ads of late. What’dya got this week?\n\nKyle: AJ-Three is really the perfect place to take a break from a sixer. Problem is, I can’t ever seem to stop right there. During the workweek, I tend to pick them off one at a time. If you’re pursuing that method, by No. 6, you feel like a real asshole for having that much cardboard surrounding one measly bottle and taking up room in the fridge. But what, am I supposed to toss that thing before all the bottles are gone? If you get caught up watching a game and down four, the remaining two beers do you no good. You’re again left with the packaging dilemma, plus you can only exacerbate it by drinking one at a time. That means you have to down both, which will only make you a little more tired and a little less likely to read, like you should. Instead you watch the same Family Guy episodes you already own (without commercials) on some third-rate syndication belcher taking up space between the networks and the home shopping lineup on your TV package.\n\nJust buy a 12’er and start saving for cirrhosis treatments.\n\nWith all that said, here’s my attempt at self-restraint:\n\nOklahoma State vs. West Virginia, O/U 66:\n\nThe Big 12’s quarterbacks essentially play the sport of football on easy mode, thanks to the Big 12 defenses. Saturdays action between the two 3-1 league runners-up features bottom-50 defenses against offenses that combine for about 70 points per game. Take the over.\n\nOle Miss -4 @ LSU:\n\nThis is easily the undefeated Rebels’ biggest road game this year. All due respect to the folks at College Station, but a night game crowd in Baton Rouge is going to be tuned up on hurricanes and will blow those brown-shirted fascists out of the water when it comes to creating a hostile environment. I like the Bayou Bengals to beat the spread, even if their team is a bit young.\n\nMichigan @ Michigan State O/U 48.5:\n\nDue to a B1G scheduling fluke, the Wolverines have to visit East Lansing for the second straight year. They’re bringing in a coach knocking on death’s door and an offense that turns the ball over against ranked teams nearly as frequently as it scores. Sparty makes hay and UM’s Devin Gardner gets in on the scoring with a few sixes the right way and these guys clear the over, easily.\n\nAJ: KM, have you caught wind of this new four-pack phenomenon? It may go a way to solving your problem (four beers in a post-workout/pre-go-out/Magnum PI on Netflix sesh mostly doesn’t make you look/feel too too bad with no hangers-on in the fridge) but the problem is, you’re still paying six-pack (or more) prices: Yes, I’m looking at you Dogfish Head, Uinta and Odell.\n\nAt first I thought I was paying $11 for really special brews, till pretty much downed the foursie and decided that I’d paid $11 for two fewer brews than I should’ve gotten.\n\nThen again, if you’re fresh off the trail or the pool and you need something to get you through the news the the SEC bounces on a Pac 12 home and home matchup …because, you know, who wants the West Coast to hang a loss on ’em week two, which lends credence to (my) notion none of the current ‘top-four’ SEC programs could hang at altitude in Utah. That’s right folks, an upper-middle-tier Pac-12 team dominating a Mississippi State, Ole Miss or Bama …Ab-so-friggin-lutely (and they know it too) …then four to the dome may be just the thing.\n\n*Crack* is the sound of the first pick in the second half of my six-pack:\n\nUtah -10 vs. Southern Cal:\n\nSince I’m bringing it with the Utes, I better put it on the line at 4,500 feet. If someone’d told you that USC would be getting double-digits in Salt Lake in mid-September, you’d have gone ahead and polished your root beer, checked on the Mrs(s) to see how the canning’s going and said ‘Oh My Heck’ (they actually say that) and then take a swig of Mountain Dew out of your flask. Yes folks, my biggest worst-kept secret/weekly go-to to beat the spread Utes have now been outed. What the hey though, give SC the ten (Utah will win by a dozen) and put a sawbuck on the over (55.5) while you’re there.\n\nAlabama -15 @ Tennessee:\n\nAlabama ain’t that good. Tennessee ain’t that bad. But Bama still has something to prove and has been beating the spread like Candy Crush lately. Tennessee will feature a second- and third-string QB under center (Nathan Peterman and Josh Dobbs)—starter Justin Worley still questionable—with an offensive line that springs more leaks than me after said four-pack, you can bet it’s going to be a long day in Knoxville.\n\nOhio State -12 @ Penn State:\n\nWhen this grande dame of mid-season fall football splendor become the purplish ’96 Ford Expedition on blocks in your two-doors-down neighbor’s driveway? While both schools, the Buckeyes at 5-1 and Nittany Lions at 4-2 are still very much in the conversation (kinda) yet, they’re treated like a layover at Midway where every restaurant has those airport weird metal shutters things except for Let Them Eat Cake …No. 13 Ohio State will win to stay barely in the conversation but also take the W at Beaver by 20 (or more). Nittany Lion Christian Hackenberg has lived up to his surname thus far in his sophomore campaign. That doesn’t mean he can’t change… but change doesn’t come quickly against this year’s Buckeyes.\n\nKM, please tell me you’re popping open an Icky and laughing at this four-pack business.\n\nKyle: AJ-Four packs are an affront to 50-plus years of American male tradition.\n\nJust imagine this exchange:\n\n“Hey Al, come on over and watch the game.”\n\n“Gee, thanks Will. Should I bring over a four-pack?”\n\n“Delete this number and don’t fucking ever call me again, you got it!?”\n\nI’m sent into spasms of anger every time I buy a four of Guinness cans to make Irish stew during football season. Why can’t those potato heads package just two more beers together so I can pass out with the Crock Pot on at 4 p.m. only to be awoken after some shitty Mountain West game is at the half by the alluring aroma of burnt starch and the sounds of my girlfriend calling for takeout?\n\nAs a corollary, every time I decide to make this meal, yeah AJ, I go with the sixer of Icky in addition to overpaying for the Guinness family’s wares. It’s my adopted state’s most consistent brew–also the only canned beer you can get in the Silver State after the Great Recession wrecked a few hopes and dreams here in Kaepernick origin-story country. I’d tell you a bunch about the IPA, but I really don’t know shit about beer. It tastes great lukewarm, which has to be worth something, right?\n\nHere’s the back end of my sixer:\n\nFlorida Atlantic @ Marshall -28:\n\nThe 7-0 Thundering Herd are quietly putting together a statistically jaw-dropping season against just a shit sandwich of a schedule. They’re 5-1-1 ATS this season including five straight wins vs. Vegas. They score 47.4 per game (2nd best in the nation) and give up just 16.6 per game (7th best). FAU is 2-1 in Conference USA, so standings-wise this is a halfway interesting matchup. But I’m looking for the Herd to make it six straight agains the wise guys.\n\nTexas Tech +23 @ TCU:\n\nThe 3-4 Raiders are abjectly horrible this season. Kliff Kingsbury kan’t koach defense or find a very good koordinator. But, 5-1 TCU got pantsed on D two weeks ago in its shootout loss to Art Briles’ Baylor squad 61-58. That defensive backfield stumbled frequently on the short passing game, which is something Kingsbury, a Mike Leech disciple, can coach against. Oh, the Raiders will lose, but they’ll keep it inside the spread.\n\nUMass @ Toledo O/U 70.5:\n\nHow about a little #MACtion to seal the deal for me this week? Toledo and UMass are both hitting the over more than 70 percent of the time this year. It’s going to be clear and 68 tomorrow in Toledo for probably the last time in the next 8 months, so I think we’ll see some real crisp offense in the strip tomorrow because nobody will be in a hurry to the run the ball and face the soul-crushing humanitarian crisis that is a Midwestern winter any more quickly than necessary. Take the over.\n\nAJ: Boy Kyle, I haven’t been this thirsty since I helped tar the roof of Shawshank (It’s a Tim Robbins kind of week). On to the recap!\n\nThe PnP Recap:\n\nLast week:\n\nAJ: 0-3\n\nKyle: 2-3\n\nOverall:\n\nAJ: 12 for 22\n\nKyle: 9 for 16\n\nThis week:\n\nAJ:\n\n* BYU +6 @ Boise State\n\n• Oregon @ Cal (at Levi’s Stadium) over 77\n\n• Utah -10 vs. Southern Cal plus over 55.5\n\n* Oregon State +13.5 @ Stanford\n\n• Alabama -15 @ Tennessee\n\n• Ohio State -12 @ Penn State\n\nKyle:\n\n• Oklahoma State vs. West Virginia over 66\n\n• Ole Miss -4 @ LSU\n\n• Michigan @ Michigan State over 48.5\n\n* Florida Atlantic @ Marshall -28\n\n* Texas Tech +23 @ TCU\n\n* UMass @ Toledo over 70.5"
