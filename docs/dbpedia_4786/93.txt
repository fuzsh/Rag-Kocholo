On Jan. 6, 2017, all the student of Berkeley Preparatory School gathered for a pep rally in the Straz building prior to Headmasters’ Challenge at Berkeley the following day. All sports participating had their captains come down and the students practiced different cheers for Saturday’s games. The Jolly Rogers promised a surprise on Thursday and they delivered with blue and white pom-poms for all in attendance.
