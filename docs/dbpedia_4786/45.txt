Heading into Friday night's Class 2M state semifinal between the visiting Berkeley Prep Buccaneers and Plantation American Heritage Patriots, to many it seemed more like a coronation for the latter.

In the end, it became a return to the state championship for the former.

The Buccaneers relied on a steady ground attack and tenacious defense as they upset the Patriots 17-14 to advance into next Saturday's Class 2M state championship against Miami Norland, a 28-7 winner over Bolles.

What seemed impossible became reality behind a determined Berkeley Prep team looking to upend SBLive Sports/Sports Illustrated No. 16th ranked team in the country heading into the night.

Berkeley Prep started off the scoring on the defensive side of the ball as defensive back Dion Cooper picked off Plantation American Heritage quarterback Dia Bell and took it back to pay dirt for the early 7-0 lead.

The Patriots would answer back not too long later when running back Byron Louis scored on a 4-yard touchdown run to tie the game up at 7-all. The Buccaneers re-took the lead with a safety in the second quarter to go ahead 9-7, but it would be Louis again answering the call on a 3-yard touchdown run to put the Patriots up 14-9 just a few minutes before halftime.

Throughout the third quarter, it was a defensive battle between the two teams and score would remain the same going into the final period. It ended up being just a touchdown early in the fourth quarter that made the difference in the game.

4-star athlete Dallas Golden scored what would be the go-ahead touchdown for Berkeley Prep, putting the Buccaneers up 17-14 with 10:11 remaining in the game. It would be on the Buccaneers' defense from there and they would never look back.

The Buccaneers reaching the state title game is the second time in three years they've made it. Berkeley Prep will face Norland at 10 a.m. on Dec. 9 at Bragg Memorial Stadium in Tallahassee for the 2M crown.
