Student Demographics

Student Enrollment

The total enrollment at Ernest Righetti High School is 2099 students, making it a large high school, in the top 25% of all California high schools by size.

Attending Ernest Righetti High will feel like attending a small college. You'll have a few hundred students in your class, enough to provide an interesting set of activities, sports, and classes to try. But compared to the largest high schools in California, the student body size won't be overwhelming.

Growth in Student Body Size

Is Ernest Righetti High School growing or shrinking? This will help you see trends in where the school is headed.

From our calculations, the enrollment at Ernest Righetti High has decreased over the past few years. We calculate this by comparing enrollment in grades 9 to 12.

Male Students Female Students All Students 9th grade 267 249 516 10th grade 283 276 559 11th grade 256 240 496 12th grade 265 263 528

As you can see in the table above, the senior class is 12 students larger than the freshman class. This suggests that Ernest Righetti High is shrinking in size and taking on fewer students.

There are a few reasons this can happen. The population of Santa Maria could be decreasing, thus sending fewer students into Ernest Righetti High. Alternatively, other schools (like charter or private schools) might be appearing, drawing students away.

Gender Split

Are there more boys or girls at Ernest Righetti High School?

From our statistics, Ernest Righetti High has a 52:48 split between male and female students in the high school grades.

Ernest Righetti High has a balanced male-female ratio that's largely representative of the general population in Santa Barbara County. Since the student body is roughly half and half, it should feel like there are equal numbers of boys and girls in your classes.

This usually means that Ernest Righetti High doesn't strongly select for either males or females, unlike other schools that have a large majority of males or females.

Ethnicity Breakdown

What's the racial diversity at Ernest Righetti High School? Does one ethnicity make up most of the student body, or is it fairly balanced?

From our statistics, Ernest Righetti High has a somewhat homogenous student body, with the majority of students identifying as one ethnicity, but not representing over 70% of the student body. Most schools in California fit this profile, so Ernest Righetti High isn't out of the ordinary. Most students attending class with you will be of the predominant ethnicity, but there will be meaningful diversity from other races.

The majority of students at Ernest Righetti High are Hispanic. In California, Hispanic students make up the majority of all students at 51.5%, and are thus the most common ethnicity. Predominantly Hispanic schools are the most common type of homogenous school, and Ernest Righetti High fits within this category.

Percentage Number American Indian/Alaska Native 0.4% 10 Asian 3.4% 73 Hispanic 58.2% 1222 Black 1.6% 35 White 31.6% 665 Hawaiian Native/Pacific Islander 0.0% 2 Two or more races 4.3% 92

High schools usually reflect the population in the surrounding area, so the ethnicities of students likely resembles those of Santa Maria. If you'd like to see how other nearby schools look in diversity, just google "[name of school] prepscholar" to find our guide to that specific school.

Income Level of Ernest Righetti High Families

What are the family incomes of students at Ernest Righetti High School? To determine this, we look at the number of students who qualify for free or reduced lunches, a classification by the US federal government.

To qualify for a reduced price meal, family income needs to be below 185% of the federal poverty guidelines. For a family of 4, this means an income of around $45,000 or below.

To qualify for a free meal, family income needs to be below 130% of the federal poverty guidelines. For a family of 4, this means an income of around $32,000 or below.

The lower the percentage of students who qualify for free or reduced price meals, the higher the income levels are likely to be.

At Ernest Righetti High, 11.5% of students qualify for reduced-price lunches, and 35.9% qualify for free lunches.

This means Ernest Righetti High has a below average level of poverty. With most students not qualifying for free or reduced price lunches, Ernest Righetti High is below average among California schools in poverty level. The income level of families in Santa Maria is thus likely to be relatively high.

Number Percent Reduced-price lunches 242 11.5% Free lunches 754 35.9% Do not qualify for reduced-price or free lunches 1103 52.5%

As with ethnicity, this likely reflects the surrounding community in Santa Maria and doesn't speak much about the school itself.

Ernest Righetti High is in the middle 50% of schools by income level. Generally, higher income level schools are better-funded and have a higher quality range of classes and activities. Ernest Righetti High is likely in the middle of the pack in this regard and will give you a good set of options to try.

If you have any interests that Ernest Righetti High doesn't cover, look to your local community for activities, or to the Internet for self-study AP classes.

School Safety

How safe is Ernest Righetti High School to attend? Can you expect a lot of conflict as a student here?

To study this, we look at disciplinary data for two types of incidents at Ernest Righetti High: referrals to law enforcement (when incidents are reported to police), and arrests.

These are the most serious disciplinary actions available to school administration and are more severe than suspensions or expulsions. Suspensions are often discretionary and can be given just for being disruptive in class. In contrast, law enforcement referrals and arrests often indicate incidents that put the safety of other Ernest Righetti High students at risk.

With this record, is Ernest Righetti High School significantly different from other schools in the area? It could be that Ernest Righetti High has an especially bad record, or it could be that the local area shows a pattern.

Academic Performance

Now we get to a major aspect of assessing a high school: academic performance. How good of an education will you get at Ernest Righetti High School? Will you be competitive for college? Will you have access to advanced classes?

We've compiled everything we could find about Ernest Righetti High's academics here.

Graduation Rate

To start off, an important benchmark of academic achievement is graduation rate. For all students who start high school at Ernest Righetti High, the state of California wants as many students to graduate as possible, since a high school diploma can mean a big difference in getting a job.

Note: This data comes from a few years back, but the trends are likely to stay the same, since schools don't get significantly better or worse within a short period of time.

Standardized Testing

Next, we'll look at another major piece of high school academics: standardized testing performance for Ernest Righetti High School students. These are tests that are administered to large populations of students for comparison purposes.

Letâ€™s start by taking a look at the data for nationally administered standardized tests.

SAT Scores

As you probably know, the SAT is a critical test used for college admissions. The higher the score you get, the better your academic performance compared to students nationwide, and the easier it is to get into top colleges.

We did in-depth research and found the average Ernest Righetti High School SAT scores.

Here's a breakdown of SAT scores by section:

Advanced Placement (AP)

Advanced Placement (AP) classes are college-level courses that are an additional academic challenge may give Ernest Righetti High School students credit for college.

Here's what we're looking for: high average AP test scores as well as high AP passing rates.

AP Scores

Every year, roughly 216 students in grades 9-12 at Ernest Righetti High take 444 AP exams. It's important to understand how students score on the AP - earning a 3, 4, or 5 on the AP test means passing the test and often earning college credit.

We have specific data on how many students got a 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 (out of 5) on AP exams in the chart below:

AP Test-Taking Statistics

Another way to gauge the quality of a school's AP program is to see how many AP students actually took AP exams at Ernest Righetti High School. If a lot of students enroll in AP courses but don't actually take the AP tests, it can be a sign that students don't feel adequately prepared to take the test, or the school isn't encouraging students to take the exams enough.

Note: The most recent data we have available is from 2012, so the statistics may have changed since then. Most likely, however, the trends are likely to continue - above average schools are likely to stay above average, and below average schools are likely to stay below average.

AP Passing Rates

For AP students at Ernest Righetti High School who take the exam, it's important to know how they do. Here we have specific data on how many students got a passing grade (a 3 or above) on all, some, or none of the AP exams that they took.

To find out the passing rates for specific AP courses at Ernest Righetti High School, you'll have to talk to your guidance counselor (who can then help you find that information). For instance, one AP Calculus teacher may have an above-90% passing rate, while another might only have a 50% passing rate. If you can, you'll want to take the class with the teacher who has more students get a 3 or above on the AP exam.

State Tests

As of 2014, eleventh graders attending Ernest Righetti High School must take standardized tests in English/Language Arts and Math as part of the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress (CAASPP). These align with the new Common Core standards and are called the "Smarter Balanced" tests.

If Ernest Righetti High students meet or exceed state standards, they're academically prepared to graduate high school and go to college. Specifically, we care about the percentage of students who meet or exceed state standards. The larger this number, the higher the preparation of students at Ernest Righetti High.

Academic Offerings

In addition to the standard high school curriculum, many high schools like Ernest Righetti High School offer advanced coursework as part of the Advanced Placement (AP) or International Baccalaureate (IB) programs.

Brief Intro to AP/IB

In some cases, you'll be able to skip introductory-level classes and move to more advanced classes. In other cases, you'll be able to avoid having to take required courses and might even be able to graduate earlier than the standard 4 years. Often this will require you to pass the AP test, getting a score of 3 or above.
