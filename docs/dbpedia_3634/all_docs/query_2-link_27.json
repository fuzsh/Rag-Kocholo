        "text": "In the early morning of December 20th, 2022, a magnitude 6.4 earthquake struck a few miles off the coast of Northern California, followed by at least a dozen smaller aftershocks. The quake was about 10 miles southwest of Ferndale, California, in Humboldt County.\n\nTwo people were killed and seventeen injured. The strong shaking damaged roads, homes, and utilities, according to the Humboldt County Office of Emergency Services. The quake was widely felt, with reports of weak shaking being felt hundreds of miles away.\n\nThis area, known as the Mendocino Triple Junction, has a long history of earthquakes. There have been over 40 earthquakes at or above magnitude 6.0 in the last hundred years within the region of this quake. \"This area is the most seismically active part of California,\" said Keith Knudsen, Deputy Director of the USGS Earthquake Science Center.\n\nMajor quakes like this are a reminder that California is earthquake county, and it's important to be prepared. Learn how personal preparedness and practicing critical steps to safety can help you be ready. And if you own your home, one of the best things to do before the next big earthquake strikes is to strengthen it with a seismic retrofit.

The quakes were a result of normal faulting and strike slip faults near the Antelope Valley fault, which runs north-south along the Sierra Nevada range front. The largest, a 6.0 magnitude, occurred along the eastern edge of the Sierra Nevada, a major physiographic boundary along the California-Nevada border.\n\nThe magnitude 6.0 earthquake was widely felt, with reports as far away as the San Francisco Bay Area and Sacramento in California, and Carson City in Nevada. Aftershocks continued to be felt into the night, with a magnitude 4.5 aftershock reported around 10:30 p.m. Damage from the earthquakes on July 8 was minor and included a rockslide in Coleville and items falling from shelves in nearby stores.\n\nEven quakes that don’t cause major damage are a reminder that California is earthquake county, and it’s important to be prepared. Learn how personal preparedness and practicing critical steps to safety can help you be ready. And if you own your home, one of the best things to do before the next big earthquake strikes is to strengthen it with a seismic retrofit. Get started at StrengthenMyHouse.com.\n\nWhat is Your Earthquake Risk?\n\nA swarm of hundreds of small earthquakes south of the Salton Sea caused thousands of local people to feel “strong” shaking. The first quake on September 30, striking in the late afternoon, was a M3.0. The largest, a M4.9, struck at 5:31 p.m. The swarm lasted for several days, stabilizing at a low rate by Oct. 3. There were no reports of damage, but the swarm is a reminder to be earthquake ready.\n\nAccording to USGS, this earthquake swarm is in an area of diffuse seismic activity between the San Andreas fault to the north and the Imperial fault to the south. Past swarms in this area include the 1981 Westmorland swarm, where the highest magnitude was a 5.8, and the 2012 Brawley Storm, which included a M5.4 quake. In August of 2020, a swarm of earthquakes had also struck in the same area, the largest being a magnitude 4.6 at Bombay Beach.\n\nWhat is Your Earthquake Risk?\n\nA magnitude 4.5 earthquake struck in Los Angeles, about 10 miles east of the Los Angeles Civic Center, late at night on September 18. It was widely felt across the region, even as far south as San Diego, and was followed by several aftershocks.\n\nThe area is seismically active—this quake was not far from the epicenter of the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake, which caused extensive damage. In 2014, the La Habra quake struck along the Puente Hills thrust fault, displacing residents. The thrust fault is considered especially dangerous as it runs along a dense urban area (downtown Los Angeles).\n\nLuckily, there were no reports of serious injuries or damage from this quake, but it’s a reminder that when there is shaking, you should practice personal preparedness and Drop, Cover, and Hold On until the shaking stops.\n\nWhat is Your Earthquake Risk?\n\nAfter a foreshock with a magnitude of 4.6 two days earlier, on June 24, a magnitude 5.8 earthquake struck about 12 miles southeast of Lone Pine, in Inyo County. People felt the shaking as far away as 350 miles northwest in San Francisco and 230 miles east in Las Vegas. People reported feeling shaking as far as Sacramento and Los Angeles, too. Campers at Mount Whitney were evacuated after a rockslide—which was triggered by the shaking—caused “truck-sized boulders” to fly off the mountain, with one landing on the trailhead. CEA had approximately 150 policyholders in the affected area.\n\nAccording to the Los Angeles Times, a quake of this magnitude “may cause slight and moderate damage in well-built ordinary structures and considerable damage in poorly built or badly designed structures and may break chimneys.” If you own an older home, it is recommended to retrofit it to make it more resistant against shaking.

Residents in the area expressed anxiety about this new shaker, noting they never know if it is an aftershock or a sign of a larger quake to come. Learn how to be better prepared to survive and recover from an earthquake by reading about what to do before an earthquake strikes.\n\nWhat is Your Earthquake Risk?\n\nA magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck 10.5 miles north-northwest of Ridgecrest in the Mojave Desert on Friday, July 5, 2019, at 8:19 p.m., on the heels of a magnitude 6.4 earthquake that struck about 7.5 miles southwest of the Searles Valley in the Mojave Desert on Thursday, July 4, 2019, at 10:33 a.m.\n\nMultiple aftershocks occurred after both, one as large as magnitude 5.5. The 7.1 earthquake was stronger than any earthquakes in the region in about 20 years.\n\nRead more about the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquake sequence in our blog post: The Recent Earthquakes near Ridgecrest, California\n\nWhat is Your Earthquake Risk?\n\nIn the early morning of August 24, 2014, a magnitude 6.0 earthquake a few miles northwest of American Canyon caused injuries and damage in Napa County and Solano County. In Napa County, the quake killed one person, injured at least 208 people, and caused severe damage to 150 buildings and moderate damage to more than 1,000 buildings. In Solano County, it injured at least 49 people, caused severe damage to 10 buildings and caused moderate damage to more than 30 buildings\n\nThe quake also damaged roads, water mains and gas lines in these counties; disrupted utility services in Sonoma County; and caused fires in Napa County. The total economic loss was estimated at $400 million. This earthquake was felt as far north as Arcata and as far south as Bakersfield. It was also felt in numerous cities in Nevada.\n\nRead more from our Press Release: A Year After South Napa Earthquake, Damage Proves Widespread and Costly\n\nWhat is Your Earthquake Risk?\n\nA little before noon, on July 29, 2008, a magnitude 5.4 earthquake occurred about five miles northeast of Yorba Linda, shaking buildings in downtown Los Angeles. It was felt as far away as Las Vegas.\n\nWhile the quake caused no deaths, the shaking was strong enough that Disneyland, Knott’s Berry Farm and other amusement parks in the area reportedly evacuated and temporarily closed rides. Notable damage to some structures in the area included buildings at California State University, Fullerton; Placentia’s public library; the Nixon Presidential Library and Museum in Yorba Linda; and Chapman University. There also were minor injuries, power outages and transit disruptions, and a fire began in a movie theater in Santa Ana as a result of a damaged light fixture.\n\nWhat is Your Earthquake Risk?\n\nTwo earthquakes occurred in 1995 in the same general area, about 10 miles north of the town of Ridgecrest, just about a month apart. The first, on August 17, was a magnitude 5.4 quake. It produced more than 2,500 aftershocks in the five weeks that followed. The second significant shock was on September 20, with a magnitude of 5.8. The second quake produced close to 2,000 aftershocks! The first quake in August has been described as a “major foreshock” to the September 20 \"mainshock.”\n\nWhat is Your Earthquake Risk?\n\nOn the early morning of June 28, 1992, a magnitude 7.3 (Mw) earthquake—the largest Southern California earthquake in 40 years—struck, rupturing five different faults! Although its epicenter was in a sparsely populated area, it was said to have been felt throughout the Los Angeles area, Arizona, Nevada, and Idaho.\n\nThat same morning, a magnitude 6.5 (Mw) earthquake occurred in Big Bear and was considered to be the largest major aftershock of the Landers quake. This quake caused considerable damage in the Big Bear area, causing a 44-mile-long fault rupture and landslides that blocked and damaged roads in the San Bernardino Mountains.\n\nBetween the two quakes, at least 400 people were injured, one child died from a fallen chimney, and two others died of heart attacks.\n\nWhat is Your Earthquake Risk?\n\nOn November 8, 1980, a magnitude 7.0 (ML) earthquake, known as the Gorda Basin or Humboldt earthquake, occurred off the coast of Humboldt County. Six people were injured, and aftershocks were felt for days. The earthquake was felt in parts of California, Oregon and Nevada.\n\nConsidering the size of the quake, damage was light, although structural damage did occur. Chimneys fell and, in Fields Landing, at least four wood-frame houses were shifted off their foundations, with two falling partly to the ground. Also, Tompkins Hill Road overpass suffered partial collapse, and there were a few minor landslides, areas of liquefaction, and ground cracks.\n\nWhat is Your Earthquake Risk?\n\nOn May 25, 1980, around 9:30 a.m., an earthquake of magnitude 6.0 occurred east-southeast of Mammoth Lakes. In the next 16 minutes, five shocks between magnitude 4.1 and 5.5 occurred.\n\nWithin 48 hours of the initial quake, 72 magnitude 4.0 – 4.9 events, six magnitude 5.0 – 5.5 events and three events of magnitude 6.0 – 6.3 struck. There were also thousands of shakes under magnitude 3.9.\n\nDamage in the Mammoth Lakes area was estimated at around $2 million and included damage to roads, buildings (including schools), water mains, merchandise and personal property. There were also widespread landslides and rockfalls.\n\nWhat is Your Earthquake Risk?\n\nA magnitude 5.7 earthquake on August 6, 1979, injured 16 people in the towns of Hollister and Gilroy and caused an estimated $500,000 in property damage in these towns. This included damage to chimneys in older houses, broken glassware in stores, and structural damage to five buildings in the town of Gilroy. For example, in Gilroy, a wall cracked in the City Hall building, and a ceiling caved in inside a room within the Municipal Courthouse. In Hollister, a real estate office’s roof caved in, and a department store sustained damage to beams.\n\nThe earthquake damaged a fire station at Pacheco Pass, and a nearby lookout station was vacated because of damage, as well. This earthquake was felt near Bakersfield and Sacramento, and at least 312 aftershocks were recorded.\n\nWhat is Your Earthquake Risk?\n\nOn February 9, 1971, a magnitude 6.5 (Mw) earthquake, also called the Sylmar earthquake, struck in the northwestern part of Los Angeles County in the San Gabriel Mountains, just after 6 a.m.\n\nAlthough the area was sparsely populated, there were 65 deaths, most of which were caused by the collapse of the Veteran’s Administration Hospital. More than 2,000 people were injured. Several other hospitals were also damaged, and newly constructed freeway overpasses collapsed. Had the quake struck at a busier time of day, loss of life would have likely been even greater.\n\nWhat is Your Earthquake Risk?\n\nThe magnitude 7.5 (Mw) earthquake that occurred on July 21, 1952, was the largest earthquake in Southern California in more than 80 years. It was felt over a large area, including in Nevada, San Francisco and San Diego—and even caused damage in these locations.\n\nIt caused 12 deaths, 18 injuries and at least $50 million in property damage. At least 20 of this quake’s aftershocks were of magnitude 5.0 or greater. Hundreds of buildings in the Kern County area were damaged, and at least 100 buildings had to be torn down as a result of this earthquake. There was extensive damage to a railroad section, and to land used for agriculture and irrigation.\n\nThe quake occurred on the White Wolf fault, which was not previously considered a major threat.\n\nRead what CEA had to say on the 65th anniversary of the Kern County earthquake.\n\nWhat is Your Earthquake Risk?\n\nOn December 4, 1948, a magnitude 6.0 (Mw) earthquake occurred about five miles east of Desert Hot Springs, north of Palm Springs. Fortunately, no lives were lost. It was felt as far north as Bakersfield, as far west as Catalina Island, as far east as Central Arizona and as far south as Mexico.\n\nIn Los Angeles, about 100 miles away from Desert Hot Springs, a 5,800-gallon water tank split open. Water pipes broke in Pasadena and at the University of California, Los Angeles, and a water main broke in San Diego. Walls and buildings cracked in Escondido, Corona and Pasadena.\n\nLandslides and ground cracks occurred closer to the epicenter. In Palm Springs, two people were injured, buildings were damaged or collapsed, and thousands of dollars of merchandise was destroyed when it fell from shelves.\n\nWhat is Your Earthquake Risk?\n\nOn May 18, 1940, a magnitude 6.9 (Mw) earthquake struck about five miles north of Calexico, along the Mexico border. It was the strongest earthquake ever recorded to strike in the Imperial Valley and was felt far away, in Los Angeles and even Tucson, Arizona.\n\nIt caused at least eight deaths, seriously injured at least 20 people and caused at least $6 million in direct damage (not including lost crops because of irrigation system damage). It caused a water tank to collapse in Imperial, damaged railroad bridges in California and Mexico, displaced roadway and railroad segments in many areas, swayed tall buildings in Los Angeles, collapsed buildings closer to the quake in Brawley and El Centro, and caused extensive damage to irrigation systems.\n\nThe Imperial fault had surface rupture of at least 25 miles, most likely much longer.\n\nWhat is Your Earthquake Risk?\n\nAround dinnertime on March 10, 1933, a magnitude 6.4 (Mw) earthquake occurred on the Newport-Inglewood fault zone, causing 120 deaths. It is estimated that about two-thirds of these deaths occurred because people ran out of buildings and were hit by falling debris. There were also more than 500 injuries reported in Long Beach alone, and the quake caused more than $50 million in property damage, mostly to poorly built structures and unreinforced buildings.\n\nFatalities would have been even higher if the quake had struck during school hours: 70 schools were destroyed, and 120 were damaged. This earthquake led to the California Legislature enacting the Field Act, which gave the State Division of Architecture authority and responsibility for approving design and supervising construction of public schools. Building codes were also improved.\n\nSince the passage of the Field Act, no school in California has collapsed as a result of a seismic event.\n\nRead what CEA had to say on the 85th anniversary of the Long Beach earthquake.\n\nWhat is Your Earthquake Risk?\n\nOn June 29, 1925, a magnitude 6.8 earthquake occurred near Santa Barbara. Shaking was felt in Paso Robles in San Luis Obispo County in the north, in Santa Ana in Orange County in the south, and to Mojave in Kern County in the east.\n\nThe quake killed 13 people and caused property damage estimated at $8 million in Santa Barbara, other coastal towns, and towns within the Santa Ynez Mountains and Santa Maria River valleys. Because portions of Santa Barbara were built on landfill, many structures were demolished. Additionally, this earthquake caused landslides in bluffs adjacent to the ocean, as well as damage to railroad tracks in the area.\n\nStrong aftershocks were felt throughout the month of July 1925.\n\nWhat is Your Earthquake Risk?\n\nOn April 21, 1918, a magnitude 6.8 (ML) earthquake occurred near the town of San Jacinto. It was a Sunday, which meant business districts in San Jacinto and nearby Hemet were empty, so the number of fatalities and injuries was lower than it might have been on a weekday, with only a few injuries and one reported death.\n\nThis earthquake was felt in Arizona and Baja California, as well. The amount of damage in the business districts was significant, and many large masonry structures collapsed. The quake also caused landslides, which resulted in at least one car accident, and blocked roads, including the road from Hemet to Idyllwild. Near Winchester, two miners were trapped in a mine temporarily. Additionally, the shaking caused cracks in the ground, roads and irrigation canals.\n\nWhat is Your Earthquake Risk?\n\nOn June 22, 1915, two separate earthquakes occurred about an hour apart near El Centro. The first, a magnitude 6.1 (ML) earthquake, occurred around 7 p.m. and weakened many structures in the region. The second, a magnitude 6.3 (ML) earthquake occurred around 9 p.m. and caused many of the structures weakened in the first quake to collapse.\n\nThe first shock had caused many people to exit buildings and move into the streets, and because many of them had not yet returned to the buildings when the second quake occurred, severe injuries were limited.\n\nHowever, in Mexicali, Mexico, less than 20 miles south of El Centro, dance halls and gambling halls had been busy before the first quake and continued to operate afterward, so many people returned to them. As a result, six deaths and many injuries occurred in Mexicali when weakened structures collapsed with patrons inside them or when materials inside the structures fell.\n\nWhat is Your Earthquake Risk?\n\nOn January 9, 1857 an earthquake with an approximate magnitude of 7.9 (Mw) ruptured about 75 miles northwest of Bakersfield. Fortunately, our state was still developing, and the area with the strongest earthquake activity was not well populated. Relative to the size of the quake, the loss of life was small: two people died.\n\nStill, the effects of the quake were dramatic: the Kern River current was turned upstream, and the waters of Mokelumne River, the Los Angeles River and Tulare Lake were thrown on their banks—with the latter stranding fish miles away from their lake bed. New springs were formed, cracks appeared in roads, and the mission in Ventura sustained major damage. Damage at Fort Tejon was most severe.\n\nReports from all around Southern and Central California state that the shaking lasted for at least one minute, with suggestions that it could have lasted up to two or three minutes!\n\nWhat is Your Earthquake Risk?\n\nOn December 21, 1812, a magnitude 7.2 earthquake occurred in the Santa Barbara Channel, believed to have come from a fault under Santa Cruz Island. It damaged or destroyed several missions, damaged the Santa Barbara Presidio, and damaged some Native American villages.\n\nThe quake also caused a tsunami, reported as far north as San Francisco and with waves washing inland three blocks in Ventura. One theory is that the tsunami was caused by a nearby submarine landslide triggered by the earthquake.\n\nAftershocks continued for almost four months.\n\nWhat is Your Earthquake Risk?\n\nThis midmorning earthquake occurred on December 8, 1812, with an estimated magnitude of 7.5 (Mw). The location is uncertain but probably on the San Andreas fault near Wrightwood in San Bernardino County.\n\nThis quake is remembered, and named after, its death toll: forty Native Americans attending mass at San Juan Capistrano were killed when the church collapsed due to the mortar in the walls failing. Records from this time are poor, but it is likely that there was also damage at Mission San Gabriel and in San Diego.\n\nWhat is Your Earthquake Risk?"
