Standardized Testing Reports and Learning Support Plans). We developed a solution to leverage queries in Veracross to export student data from a few clicks, generate documents in bulk using the exported data, as well as generating the veracross-mapping-file.csv to import and attach those generated files to students’ records in Axiom. This greatly increased the speed and accuracy at which we are able to generate documents for our students and store them in Axiom and/or share them with parents via the Parent Portal.\n\nPresenter: Victoria Muradi\n\nAddt’l.
