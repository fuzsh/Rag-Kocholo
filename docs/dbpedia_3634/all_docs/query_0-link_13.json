        "text": "Results:\n\nA total of 599 participants in grade 8 were enrolled with two years of follow up. The median age at enrollment was 13 (range 12–15). Most participants were Latinx (n=566, 94.5%) and of Mexican origin (n=531, 88.6%), were U.S. born with immigrant parents (n=422, 70.4%) and had a mother with educational attainment of less than high school (n=255, 42.6%) or high school (n=177, 30.0%) ( ). Approximately half the sample was female (n=316, 52.7%). Most participants lived with their mother (n=448, 74.8%), 14.5% had at least one parent move for work during the year (n=87) and measures of family context were relatively high for family cohesion (mean score 3.3 of 4), and maternal communication (mean score 2.8 of 4). At enrollment, about one fifth (n=126, 21.1%) of participants had a close friend or someone they hung out with who was in a gang, 9.2% had a partner in a gang (n=55), and the mean score of exposure to 5 types of neighborhood disorder events in the previous year (range 0–11).\n\nTable 1:\n\nBaseline sociodemographic characteristicsN (%)Age, years – mean (range)13.7 (12.3, 15.2)Male283 (47.3)Female316 (52.7)Immigrant Generation 1st: born outside of the US71 (11.9) 2nd: US born/immigrant parents422 (70.4) 3rd+; US born and parents US born97 (16.2) US born; generation unknown9 (1.5)Mother’s education level Less than high school255 (42.6) High School177 (30.0) More than high school149 (25.9) Unknown18 (3.0)Latino origin (at least one parent/grandparent)566 (94.5)Country of origin- Mexico (at least one parent/grandparent)531 (88.6)Food insecurity/hunger in past 6 months46 (7.7)Had boyfriend/girlfriend in past 6 months291 (48.8)Ever drank alcohol in past 6 months78 (13.0) Family context Living situation Live with both parents448 (74.8) Live with mother only132 (22.0) Other19 (3.2)At least one parent moves for work during the year87 (14.5)Maternal communication, 1–4: high – mean score (range)2.8 (1.5, 3.6)Family cohesion, 1–4: high – mean score (range)3.3 (1.8, 4.0) Social environment characterized by risk factors for violence Partners affiliated with or in a gang in past 6 months55 (9.2)Close friends or people spend time with are in a gang126 (21.1)Neighborhood disorder, number of events – mean (range)5 (0,11)\n\nshows the average trajectories and individual longitudinal patterns of emotion regulation and non-violent problem-solving skills over two years in the study (8th-10th grades for nearly all participants). As depicted, average patterns for both outcomes were relatively stable over time and, for the majority, scores were high overall ( and ). We identified four trajectories of emotion regulation based on model fit statistics (BIC=−6583.93; AIC=−6548.78; Smallest group n=25; Entropy 0.78; Appendix A). The largest group, which comprised 48.8% of the population (group 3), had a stable mid- to high- trajectory, followed by a stable low emotion regulation group (Group 1=25.4%) and a stable high emotion regulation group (Group 4=21.4%). Only an estimated 4.3% (Group 2) belonged to an increasing trajectory from low to high emotion regulation over the time period ( ). As presented in the second set of trajectories in , there was more variation in individual longitudinal patterns over time with the largest variations in the larger low and middle trajectories.\n\nWe identified three trajectories of non-violent problem-solving skills (BIC=−6575.26; AIC=−6551.08; Smallest group n=41; Entropy 0.80; Appendix table 1). As depicted in , the largest group had a stable mid-level trajectory (Group 2, 57.8%), followed by a stable high (Group 3, 34.8%) and stable low trajectory (Group 1, 7.5%). Again, there was more variation in individual longitudinal patterns for the high and middle groups, which had the largest number of participants ( ).\n\nTrajectories of emotional regulation and problem solving overlapped in the same direction but were not completely identical ( ). Among the low problem-solving skills trajectory group most participants had low (50.0%) or mid-to-high (49.0%) emotion regulation with very few in the high group (4.9%). Among the high problem-solving trajectory group, most participants had mid-to-high (47.8%), or high (31.0%) emotion regulation with fewer in the low group (14.5%).\n\nTable 2:\n\nEmotional Regulation Trajectory GroupLow (25.4%)Mid-to-High (49.0%)High (21.4%)Increasing (4.2%)TotalPercent (SE)Percent (SE)Percent (SE)Percent (SE) Problem Solving Trajectory Groups Low (8.0%)50.0 (10.0)45.1 (10.1)4.9 (4.2)0.0 (0.0)100 Middle (58.6%)28.3 (3.9)50.2 (4.1)18.1 (3.0)3.4 (1.6)100 High (33.5%)14.5 (3.9)47.8 (5.1)31.0 (4.2)6.6 (2.5)100\n\nshows the results from a multinomial logistic regression model examining baseline family context, and social environment characterized by risk factors for violence in relation to trajectory group membership (full results in Appendix B). Compared to low emotion regulation, the odds of membership in the highest trajectory group decreased for each increase in neighborhood disorder events (Odds Ratio (OR) 0.79; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71, 0.89) and increased for each one-point increase in maternal communication (OR 2.57; 95% CI 0.97, 6.81) and family cohesion (OR 3.20; 95% CI 1.45, 7.07). Compared to low non-violent problem solving, the odds of membership in the highest non-violent problem-solving skills trajectory group were lower in those who had a partner in a gang at enrollment (OR 0.11; 95% CI 0.02, 0.48) and who had friends in a gang (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.11, 0.84). The odds of membership in the high problem-solving skills group increased with higher family cohesion scores (OR 3.10; 95% CI 1.12, 5.29). Females were less likely to be in the high emotion regulation group (OR 0.22 95% CI; 0.21, 0.41) but were more likely to be in the high nonviolent problem-solving group (OR 2.32; 95% CI: 1.02, 5.29), showing that competencies may vary by biological sex but that overall associations with exposure to violence and family context remain strong after controlling for sex.\n\nTable 3:\n\nEmotion RegulationNon-violent Problem SolvingTrajectory GroupOR95% (CI)OR95% (CI) Low (Referent)(Referent) Middle Social environment characterized by risk factors for violence Partner in a gang0.73(0.29,1.81) 0.30 (0.11,0.8) Close friends or people spend time with are in a gang0.78(0.39,1.56)0.53(0.21,1.33)Neighborhood disorder event count 0.88 (0.8,0.97) 0.92(0.79,1.06) Family context Maternal communication, mean score1.44(0.68,3.04)0.77(0.24,2.54)Family cohesion, mean score1.89(0.98,3.65)2.14(0.82,5.58)At least one parent moves for work during the year0.87(0.44,1.73)1.53(0.47,4.98)Biological sex (reference=male) 0.38 (0.22,0.65) 1.45(0.66,3.17) High Social environment characterized by risk factors for violence Partner in a gang0.36(0.08,1.73) 0.11 (0.02,0.48) Close friends or people spend time with are in a gang0.67(0.28,1.64) 0.30 (0.11,0.84) Neighborhood disorder 0.79 (0.71,0.89) 0.88(0.76,1.02) Family context Maternal communication, mean score 2.57 (0.97,6.81) 2.42(0.69,8.46)Family cohesion, mean score 3.20 (1.45,7.07) 3.10 (1.12,8.57) At least one parent moves for work during the year0.89(0.39,2.01)1.80(0.53,6.17)Biological sex (reference=male) 0.22 (0.12,0.41) 2.32 (1.02,5.29)\n\nDiscussion:\n\nEmotion regulation and non-violent problem-solving skills appeared generally high in this sample of 8th grade predominantly Latinx youth, with most (75%) classified within the moderate to high trajectory groups on these two measures of social emotional development. For most trajectories, the average scores did not change over the two-year follow-up period, although there was substantial variation in individual patterns within the trajectory groups. As anticipated, emotion regulation and non-violent problem-solving skills were related to one another. Trajectories for these measures nonetheless were distinct over time, reflected in the finding that membership in the high trajectory group for one factor did not necessarily align with high trajectory membership for the other. Likewise, they had slightly different associations with social environment characterized by risk factors for violence. Those reporting lower neighborhood disorder in 8th grade had higher emotion regulation skills over the period of early to middle adolescence. Youth without interpersonal exposure to gangs through peers and partners in 8th grade reported higher non-violent problem-solving skills that persisted over time. Family context, and stronger family cohesion, reporting support and emotional closeness with family, in 8th grade, in particular, was associated with both higher emotion regulation and higher problem-solving skills over the subsequent two years.\n\nWe had anticipated that we would see greater change in the trajectories of these two social emotional competencies during this period, given participants’ shifts from middle to high school alongside the cognitive changes and identity development that accompany growth in early and middle adolescence (Dahl, 2004; Dahl et al., 2018). The group-based trajectories, however, suggested that the levels remained consistent, on average, over time. Nonetheless, in our exploration of individual patterns within the trajectory groups, we found that even though the groups were consistently high or low, for example, there was still considerable variation within group. This movement signals the opportunity for interventions to support improved behavioral outcomes and underscores continued potential for school-based delivery of universal group-based trauma-informed interventions (e.g., Second Step (Moy & Hazen, 2018); Project POWER (Mendelson et al., 2015, 2020), which integrates education on the effects of stress, emotion regulation skills taught through mindfulness, and cognitive behavioral therapy and is currently being evaluated in a randomized controlled trial) during the early and middle adolescent years. Given the association of these social emotional competencies with multiple health outcomes (Bornstein et al., 2010; Denham et al., 2009; Hanson et al., 2015; Hessler & Katz, 2010; McMahon et al., 2013; Yurgelun-Todd, 2007), strengthening skills and the capacity to sustain high levels consistently may be important to realizing the positive benefits they afford. In particular, the middle group for both factors, which constituted approximately half the sample, showed considerable variation in emotion regulation and non-violent problem-solving skills over the two-year period. While our analysis focused on identifying multi-level factors at baseline that distinguished average trajectory groups, quantifying changes within these trajectories and additional examination of short-term effects that may be underlying individual changes using growth-mixture modeling could inform intervention strategies that address proximal exposures.\n\nThe two factors measured are different social emotional competencies (emotion regulation and non-violent problem-solving skills). The predictors that characterized trajectory groups differed for these two measures, suggesting mechanisms of influence and effective approaches to strengthen these competencies may vary. Neighborhood violence exposure, as measured by a neighborhood disorder index, was associated with emotion regulation trajectory, with increases in exposure to neighborhood disorder associated with lower emotion regulation. In contrast, exposures through peers and partners were influential to non-violent problem-solving skills. Bandura’s social cognitive theory (Bandura, 1971; Edberg, 2007), a widely-used behavioral theory that underpins the development of numerous evidence-based health interventions for adolescents, conceptualizes behavior change as occurring through reciprocal relationships between personal, behavioral and environmental factors. In the context of environmental and personal barriers tied to and exacerbated by community violence, social cognitive theory posits that individuals can learn to adopt healthy behaviors. At the personal level these include increasing knowledge, favorable attitudes, and outcome expectations that address the perceived value and consequences of, for example, use of non-violent strategies to resolve peer conflict. At the behavioral level these include increased skills and self-efficacy to practice healthy behaviors. As social cognitive theory recognizes the importance of environment on individual behavior, the findings here highlight the potential to engage peers to leveraging positive social influence and address social norms as targets of change in the social environment. Likewise, the strong protective influence of families – particularly embodied in the support and emotional closeness achieved through high family cohesion, found to support sustained higher levels of both social emotional competencies, underscores the opportunity for dyadic interventions with parents and youth to buffer environmental exposures that shape adolescents’ ability to practice protective social emotional behaviors (Gonzales et al., 2014). We found that family cohesion was associated with both outcomes and maternal communication was associated with emotion regulation, highlighting the importance of parents in setting norms related to expression and communication. These measures of family context may be more amenable to intervention than factors such as neighborhood disorder and should remain an important target (Gonzales et al., 2014)for future interventions to promote resilience and well-being. Research with Mexican-origin adolescents and their parents, for example, has elucidated a relationship between emotional coregulation, that is, connection in daily emotions of happiness and distress, tied to how well the parent-adolescent dyads got along, signaling mechanisms of effect for family-based intervention. (Mercado et al., 2019)\n\nWhile group-based trajectory models are an informative way to examine longitudinal patterns over time, it is a data driven approach and therefore the trajectories that emerge are dependent on the time period of the study and sample size. Our study includes information from the period between 8th grade to 10th grade. It is likely that emotion regulation and non-violent problem-solving skills are still developing during this period and are affected by social context that may also be changing over time. The brain regions involved in these competencies undergo significant structural and functional development during adolescence and changes in these competencies vary with both sex and age and should be considered in future research (Ahmed et al., 2015; Bender et al., 2012; Theurel & Gentaz, 2018). Furthermore, the two-year follow-up period, while aligned with shifts from middle school to high school and growth in the importance of peer relationships and social identity, may have been insufficient in duration to observe large changes in competencies and skills. While we anticipated the social transition between middle and high schools might have been accompanied by more substantial changes for adolescents, we may have seen more dramatic changes had we followed adolescents later into high school and early adulthood. Some of the trajectories that were identified may have also begun at earlier ages or could vary with earlier exposure to violence and other social determinants of health.\n\nAdditionally, measures of family violence were not included in the study and measures of social environment exposure to risk factors for violence do not capture directly violence victimization, perpetration or witnessing violence directly. Maternal communication should be expanded upon in future work to better account for family structure and gender. Future studies should also examine additional parent-adolescent relationship qualities such as closeness, warmth, and conflict and other protective peer influences which were not included in this study. Lastly, our sample was primarily second-generation adolescents whose parents immigrated from Mexico or other Central American countries. Thus, we did not have sufficient variation in the sample to integrate these factors into this analysis. This remains an important area for further work.\n\nGroup-based trajectory models are a function of sample size; hence, with a larger sample, we may have identified subgroups with potentially more changes over time. The within-group movement observed for some of the trajectory groups that, on average, appeared relatively consistent over time, signals this possibility. Future analyses could use methods like growth mixture modeling to better understand variations within trajectory groups. Lastly, the group characterized as moving from low to high emotion regulation was quite small, precluding analysis of factors associated with this trajectory in our sample.\n\nIn conclusion, emotion regulation and nonviolent problem-solving skills were both associated with family context and being in a social environment characterized by risk factors for violence. Nonetheless these measures had slightly different associations with distinct exposures within these two domains, indicating that mechanisms of influence and approaches to strengthen these competencies may vary. Emotion regulation was more strongly associated with neighborhood disorder illustrating how chronic stress through environmental exposure can lead to aggressive reactions. Conversely, those with higher non-violent problem-solving skills were less likely to have interpersonal exposure to gangs through peers and partners. The association between problem solving skills and interpersonal exposure shows potential to engage peers to address social norms as targets of change in the social environment. Lastly, family context, family cohesion most prominently, was associated with both higher emotion regulation and higher problem-solving skills over the subsequent two years. This evidence supports the promise of dyadic interventions with parents and youth to buffer environmental exposures that shape adolescents’ ability to practice protective social emotional behavior."
