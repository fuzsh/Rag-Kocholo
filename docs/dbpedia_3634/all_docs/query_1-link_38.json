The most common panels used are a 5 panel, 10 panel and 12 panel drug tests, (panels specify how many drugs will be screened) however customized screeningings are available as well.\n\nWhat is a Drug Test?\n\nA drug test is a technical analysis of a biological specimen, for example urine, hair, blood, breath, sweat, and/or oral fluid/saliva-to determine the presence or absence of specified parent drugs or their metabolites. Major applications of drug testing include detection of the presence of performance enhancing steroids in sport, employers and parole/probation officers screening for drugs prohibited by law and police officers testing for the presence and concentration of alcohol (ethanol) in the blood commonly referred to as BAC (blood alcohol content). BAC tests are typically administered via a breathalyzer while urinalysis is used for the vast majority of drug testing in sports and the workplace. Numerous other methods with varying degrees of accuracy, sensitivity (detection threshold/cutoff), and detection periods exist. A drug test may also refer to a test that provides quantitative chemical analysis of an illegal drug, typically intended to help with responsible drug use.\n\nDoes passive smoke inhalation cause a false positive for marijuana?\n\n\"Passive\" smoke inhalation from being in a room with people smoking marijuana is not considered valid, as the cut-off concentrations for lab analysis are set well above that which might occur for passive inhalation.\n\nOther abnormalities in the urine screen may indicate that results may be a false negative or that there was deliberate adulteration of the sample. For example:\n\na low creatinine lab value can indicate that a urine sample was tampered with; either the subject diluted their urine by consuming excessive water just prior to testing, or water was added to the urine sample.\n\ncreatinine levels are often used in conjunction with specific gravity to determine if samples have been diluted. To help avoid this problem, the testing lab may color the water in their toilet blue to prevent the sample being diluted with water from the toilet.\n\nsubjects may also attempt to add certain enzymes to the urine sample to affect stability, but this often changes the pH, which is also tested.\n\nHow long do drugs stay in your system?\n\nThe window of detection or often times referred to as look back period of a drug test depend on several factors. Some of the factors impacting how long a drug will stay in your system are:\n\nThe amount of the drug taken\n\nThe frequency of the drug taken\n\nThe type of drug taken\n\nAn individual's body metabolic rate and general health\n\nThe amount of fluids consumed since ingesting the drug\n\nThe amount of exercise since ingesting the drug\n\nOther genetic variations that would impact an individual's response to a specific drug\n\nWhy choose Accredited Drug Testing in Santa Maria, CA?\n\nOur staff is prepared to assist you with any questions you may have in a friendly and confidential manner and providing exceptional customer service and being available when you need us for drug testing in Santa Maria, CA is our #1 Priority and we look forward to serving the needs of employers and individuals who need any type of test.\n\n(800) 221-4291\n\nSchedule Your Test\n\n\"When You Need a Test, Choose the Best\"\n\nAccredited Drug Testing\n\nTesting Centers Nationwide\n\n(800) 221-4291\n\nFor more information regarding the effects of drug abuse - Click Here\n\nFor more information on a drug free work place - Click Here\n\nLocal Area Info: Santa Maria, California\n\nSanta Maria is a city near the Southern California coast in Santa Barbara County. It is approximately 65 miles (105 km) northwest of Santa Barbara and 150 miles (240 km) northwest of downtown Los Angeles. Its estimated 2018 population was 108,470, making it the most populous city in the county and the Santa Maria-Santa Barbara, CA Metro Area. The city is notable for its wine industry and Santa Maria-style barbecue. Sunset magazine called Santa Maria \"The West's Best BBQ Town\".\n\nThe Santa Maria Valley, stretching from the Santa Lucia Mountains toward the Pacific Ocean, was the homeland of the Chumash people for several thousand years. The Native Americans made their homes on the slopes of the surrounding hills among the oaks, on the banks of the Santa Maria River among the sycamores, and along the coast. They had unique plank-built boats, called Tomol, which they used for ocean fishing.\n\nIn 1769, the Portolá Expedition passed through the Santa Maria Valley during the first Spanish land exploration up the coast of Las Californias Province. Mission San Luis Obispo de Tolosa was established just north of the valley in 1772, and Mission La Purísima Concepción was established near present-day Lompoc in 1787. Rather than rich soil, white settlers were attracted here by the possibility of free land. In 1821, after the Mexican War of Independence, the mission lands in Santa Maria Valley were made available for private ownership under a Mexican land grant called Rancho Punta de Laguna. At the end of the Mexican War in 1848, California was ceded to the United States."
