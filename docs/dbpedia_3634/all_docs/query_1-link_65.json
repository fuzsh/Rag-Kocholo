We tried everything and couldn't get him past the fear. In one session Brian got him to go under and he loves going under water now and is swimming great ! It's like a different kid.\n\nBlake was a very good instructor. She was patient, encouraging, professional, timely and caring. The company was very responsive to our needs and professional. The lesson plan was well organized and thought out.\n\nMy daughter has taken lessons for few summers at a different swim school and I feel she has progressed more in a shorter amount of time with Instaswim lessons. Jennifer is great with the kids, I would highly recommend this program for kids of any age!\n\nWe used Instaswim for lessons for our 2 year old and our instructor, Danielle was great! She was able to engage him through various games and activities and he looked forward to his time with her every week! Would definitely recommend!!\n\nReagan was phenomenal! Both of my boys enjoyed him and learned so much from him. Within 12 lessons (three times a week), my 5 year old can now swim on his own without any help or floaties and my two year old is able to flip onto his back and float. Reagan was very patient with the kids (especially my two year old), but taught them the life saving skills they needed. He was very punctual and professional! We definitely recommend Reagan and InstaSwim to everyone and anyone!\n\nWe did 12 one-on-one swim lessons with our 1 year old daughter and her progression from lesson 1 to lesson 12 was impressive. At the end of 12 lessons, she could hold her breath for approximately 20 seconds, find the side of the pool on her own and \"monkey crawl\" to a stair to get out. We highly recommend InstaSwim, specifically Veronique, who was our wonderful instructor.\n\nPrevious\n\nNext\n\nOur private Swim Lessons Programs in Santa Maria, CA\n\nThey say the earlier the better!

There are several key reasons why taking private swim lessons is important.\n\nFirst and foremost, private swim lessons provide a safe and controlled environment for individuals to learn how to swim. When taking private lessons, individuals have the full attention of the instructor, who can provide personalized instruction and immediate feedback.\n\nThis allows for a more efficient and effective learning experience, as the instructor can make adjustments to the lesson plan and teaching methods based on the individual’s needs and progress.\n\nFurthermore, in a private lesson, the student is less likely to be intimidated by other students, which can be a barrier to learning.\n\nPrivate swim lessons offer flexibility and convenience. Unlike group lessons, which often have a set schedule and class size, private lessons can be scheduled at a time and frequency that is convenient for the individual.\n\nThis allows individuals to fit swim lessons into their busy schedules and to make the most of their time in the pool.\n\nPrivate swim lessons can help individuals to achieve specific goals. Whether it’s learning a new stroke, improving technique, or preparing for a triathlon, a private instructor can tailor the lesson plan to the individual’s specific needs and goals.\n\nThis can help individuals to achieve their desired level of proficiency more quickly and efficiently than in a group setting.\n\nPrivate swim lessons can help individuals to build confidence in the water. Many people are afraid of the water or have had a traumatic experience in the past, which can prevent them from learning to swim.\n\nA private instructor can provide a supportive and encouraging environment, which can help individuals to build confidence and overcome their fears.\n\nFinally, private swim lessons are an excellent way for individuals to stay active and healthy. Swimming is a low-impact form of exercise that can provide a full-body workout, improve cardiovascular fitness, and help to maintain a healthy weight.\n\nBy taking private swim lessons, individuals can learn how to swim properly and safely, which can help them to reap the many benefits of swimming for years to come.\n\nIn conclusion, private swim lessons are an important way for individuals to learn how to swim, or to improve their swimming skills, in a safe and controlled environment with a trained instructor.\n\nThey offer flexibility, convenience, tailored instruction, a supportive and encouraging environment, and an excellent way to stay active and healthy.\n\nFurthermore, they can help individuals to achieve specific goals and build confidence in the water. Overall, private swim lessons are a valuable investment in one’s personal and physical development.\n\nHow To Ensure Safety During Private Swim Lessons\n\nWhen it comes to private swim lessons, safety should always be a top priority. Here are some tips to ensure safety during private swim lessons:\n\nChoose a qualified instructor:\n\n1. It’s important to choose an experienced and qualified swim instructor who is certified in CPR and first aid. This will ensure that the instructor is equipped to handle any emergency situation that may arise during the lesson.\n\n2. Maintain appropriate pool depth: Private swim lessons should take place in a pool with the appropriate depth for the swimmer’s ability. Shallow water is recommended for beginners, while deeper water is suitable for advanced swimmers.\n\n3. Use proper swimming gear: Swimmers should wear proper swimming gear such as swimwear, goggles, and swim caps, as well as floatation devices if necessary. This helps to prevent accidents and ensures maximum comfort while swimming.\n\n4. Stay hydrated: Swimming can be physically demanding and it’s important to stay hydrated before, during, and after the swim lesson. Instructors should encourage students to take frequent water breaks and to bring a water bottle with them.\n\n5. Keep pool area clear: It’s important to keep the pool area clear of any potential hazards such as toys, floats, or other objects that could cause tripping or slipping. This helps to prevent accidents and creates a safe environment for swimming.\n\n6. Follow pool rules: Swimmers should be familiar with and follow all pool rules, including those related to diving, jumping, and horseplay. Instructors should also enforce pool rules to maintain a safe environment for everyone in the pool.\n\n7. Establish a clear communication system: Private swim lessons often involve one-on-one instruction and it’s important to establish a clear communication system between the instructor and swimmer. This helps to ensure that the swimmer understands the instructions and is able to ask questions if necessary.\n\nIn conclusion, ensuring safety during private swim lessons is important for preventing accidents and ensuring that everyone has a fun and enjoyable experience. By following these tips, you can create a safe environment for swimming and make the most of your private swim lessons.\n\nWe Travel To You\n\nOur swimming instructors travel to your provided location to teach swimming lessons!\n\nFLEXIBLE Scheduling\n\nYou and your provided swim instructor can work out a plan that works around your busy schedule!\n\nExperienced Instructors\n\nInstaSwim swimming instructors are highly skilled, certified and provide excellent service to our clients!\n\nPersonalized Lessons\n\nOur swimming instructors give our students a one-on-one personalized experience that you don't receive in camps!\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\nWe do not have locations, our instructors travel to any pool near you.\n\nPlease call us to find out more information about swim instructors in your area!\n\nInstaSwim hand picks the instructor for you based on the information you provided to us in your registration.

We will send over an invoice to your email address once you are matched with your instructor.\n\nOnce you complete your 6 lesson package, you have the option to upgrade to the 12 lesson package. You will have to contact our office and let us know that you would like to upgrade. We will then send you a new invoice with the difference owed.\n\nInstaSwim LLC and our swim instructors are fully insured under our multi-million dollar general liability insurance policy.\n\nOnce you submit payment and sign our policy waiver, we recommend looking into a “bubble swim trainer backpack” which you can purchase (here)\n\nWe also highly recommend a puddle jumper if you are taking lessons as a group. Accidents can happen at any time, that is why we require all of our participants to be wearing a water safety flotation device while the child is waiting for his/her turn for lessons.\n\nOur instructors and lifeguards bring a variety of different equipment such as diving ring, a kick board, toys, and potentially a water barbell if needed.\n\nAll of our contracted swim instructors and lifeguards carry CPR/First Aid certifications by accredited courses such as the American Red Cross and the American Heart Association. Alot of our Instructors also have competitive swim backgrounds or are also lifeguards. We require a minimum of 2 years experience working with all ages in swim instruction.\n\nIn a case where you and your instructor is not a good match for you and your family, we will switch that instructor out with another one who will be a much better fit for you. You will just have to contact our office and let us know. 888-610-2656\n\nOur main focus is to teach our students life saving skills and water safety. Specifically back floating and building arm and kick strength so that our students can successfully swim to the side of the pool for safety or float on their back in an emergency situation. Our goal is to have our students be able to save themselves if they were to ever fall into the pool on their own. Since we offer lessons to all ages, our instructors create custom lesson plans based on what that student’s specific goals are including stroke development, water comfort, treading water, diving, etc.\n\nWe always suggest starting with the 6 lesson package first to see if it’s a good fit with your instructor. Once the 6 lesson package is complete, you have the option to upgrade to the 12 lessons, you will just have to pay the difference owed.\n\nThe 30 minute class is for 1 student only. If you have 2 students in a class, we recommend going with either the 45 minute or 1 hour class. We break down group classes into 1 on 1 increments so that this way each student will have undivided attention with the instructor.\n\nWe do not believe in a “learn to swim guarantee” especially without observing the performance of our students. Some students may need more lessons than others and every child is unique and different. Children all learn at their own pace so we cannot say that we guarantee you will learn in “X” amount of lessons. However, we have AMAZING 5 star reviews from many of our clients and students of all ages which you can view (here)\n\nWe are happy to further assist you with any questions you may have.
