        "text": "On January 1, News Channel 12 (CBS) changed frequencies and now originates from Broadcast Peak in southern Santa Barbara County. The signal now also transmits in San Luis Obispo County from Cuesta Peak and from a tower west of Paso Robles. In all locations, the over-the-air digital signal now displays as Channel 3.2.\n\nNews Channel 12 is working with cable and satellite systems to minimize any impact for viewers. Program guides may show KEYT-DT2 instead of KCOY-TV for News Channel 12 programming. Over-the-air viewers in southern Santa Barbara County are now able to see CBS programming on channel 3.2 because of the change. (The NOW Channel is now on 3.3.)\n\nIf after January 1 you don't see News Channel 12 over the air on Channel 3.2, you may need to rescan your digital TV.\n\nHere’s how: from your TV menu select 'SCAN' or 'AUTO TUNE.' You can find it by pressing the 'MENU' or 'SETUP' button on your remote. If you are a Cable or Satellite customer, you will likely not have to do anything as these changes will be done by most providers.\n\nTo improve your signal, point your antenna in the direction of your nearest transmission source. If you use an indoor antenna and have difficulty, consider an outside antenna pointed toward your nearest transmission source."
