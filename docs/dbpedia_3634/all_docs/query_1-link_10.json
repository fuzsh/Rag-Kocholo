        "text": "The best parts of this high school are the majority of teacher's willlingness to help students who ask for help. Another great part of Pioneer Valley is how easy it is to make friends through sports and clubs and how available these extracurriculers are. Some of the worst parts could be the frequency of fights and dangerous substance use. It has even created problems for students who simply wish to use the restroom. There is also the topic of the rare occasion of a teacher who may sometimes neglect the students' and seemingly abuse their position over students. Despite this, the atmosphere between students and bewtween students and a majority of teachers make this a great school for students focused on their studies and own life and not on high school drama.\n\nThe school itself isn't bad. There are many opportunities here and the staff is very helpful when you ask for it especially when it comes to college. Teachers are also really good at their jobs. There are a few problems however: food isn't great, there is only 1 restroom open for students to use at any given time, and the students tend to misbehave (pulling fire alarms, breaking school property, etc.). Another main problem is drug use. We have had quite a few people overdose in the past year. Security while nice, seems to be lazy and doesn't care if students leave or cut class at any given time. Seems too lenient at times. Overall, I have not had a bad experience here when it comes to clubs, academics, or the staff. Glad to have been a Panther."
