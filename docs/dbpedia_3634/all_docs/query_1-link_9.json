        "text": "Now for the first time, 15 years after Shawn Miner and I started compiling this list, we have a source of official information. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) license database for transmitters located in California was at one time available on the Internet via telnet at tcomeng.com; log in as \"fcc\" (it does not appear to be currently available). More than 300,000 records throughout the state are on file. Even this huge database is not complete, however. For example, information on licenses held by federal government agencies is considered confidential and is not included.\n\nI searched this list for licensee names that included the words \"Santa Barbara,\" \"Carpinteria,\" \"Goleta\" and a few other names. I also search by frequency for those that we had not been able to identify and found more identifications. Thanks very much to David Carmean for bringing this wonderful resource to our attention.\n\nThis list is now expanded to include more than 800 scanner frequencies reported to have been heard locally. Of that number, 62 are newly added because of the availability of the FCC database and many others have been identified. Those licensees listed in the FCC database that we have identified to date are marked with an asterisk (*).\n\nBecause of the FCC database, I have pruned the list to eliminate frequencies that met all three of the following conditions: (1) Not included in the FCC database; (2) unidentified transmitters; and (3) no receptions reported. The following six frequencies were eliminated below: 152.520, 152.810, 158.895, 170.250, 319.300 and 931.050.\n\nThis list also includes the frequencies of local cells for cellular telephone communications. They are included so you can avoid listening to them, since it is illegal to evesdrop on cellular calls.\n\nThe list below shows the frequency first, followed in parentheses by the number of hits in a three-day period, and then a description of the service. Shawn loaded sets of 50 frequencies in his scanner and let it run for at least three working days. Shawn lives on the Ventura side of Carpinteria, and though he's using a \"long wire\" antenna, your results may vary. Also some frequencies, such as those for emergencies, may not have a high count but are very active during a fire or other emergency for which they were designed.\n\nHis scanner recorded the number of times that it stopped on each frequency, up to a maximum of 99 counts. For one reason or another some frequencies were not counted at all:\n\nThose reasons are:\n\n(LC) = locked out for noise, continuous\n\n(LI) = locked out for noise, intermittent\n\n(OB) = out of range of scanner\n\n(DC) = data channel\n\n(MP) = mobile phone constant tone\n\n(CO) = continuously active\n\n(LF) = local frequency (like cordless phones).\n\nSome abbreviations used for ham repeaters:\n\nARA = Agoura Radio Association\n\nCMRA = California Microwave Relay Association\n\nGRA = Gibraltar Repeater Association\n\nLPARG = Los Padres Amateur Radio Group\n\nPL = Private Line\n\nRACES = Radio Amateur Civil Emergency Service\n\nSBARC = Santa Barbara Amateur Radio Club\n\nSBCRA = Santa Barbara Council of Radio Amateurs\n\nSMRA = Sulphur Mountain Repeater Association\n\nSMUG = Six Meter Users Group\n\nSome other abbreviations:\n\nATIS = Automatic Terminal Information Service\n\nCLEMARS = California Law Enforcement Mutual Radio System\n\nHEAR = Inter-Hospital Emergency\n\nUNICOM = Uncontrolled Airports Advisory Channel\n\nI started working on this list in 1983, when I became manager of the Carpinteria Radio Shack store and began expanding a list that had about 30 frequencies. Since that time literally hundreds of people have contributed to developing what may be the most comprehensive list for any area. It's not finished--it never will be. I will appreciate any additions, corrections, and suggestions you can make.
