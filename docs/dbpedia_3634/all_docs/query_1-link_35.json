        "text": "Location: Santa Maria, CA\n\nAre you a student or parent at Ernest Righetti High School? Want to understand how to get the most out of high school?\n\nWe've written the best guide to Ernest Righetti High available. Here we'll cover:\n\nBreakdowns of student ethnicity, gender, and family income\n\nHow safe Ernest Righetti High is to attend\n\nSAT/ACT/AP scores earned by Ernest Righetti High students\n\nWhich AP/IB classes you can take at Ernest Righetti High\n\nEvery sports team you can join at Ernest Righetti High\n\nLet's get started!\n\nBasic Information\n\nErnest Righetti High School is a public school, supporting grades 9 to 12 . It's located in Santa Maria, CA in Santa Barbara County.\n\nBased on its location, Ernest Righetti High is classified as a school in a midsize suburb. Here's the location on a map:\n\nContact Information\n\nMailing address:\n\nErnest Righetti High School941 E. Foster Rd. Santa Maria, CA 93455-3318\n\nPhone number: 8059372051\n\nErnest Righetti High School homepage: http://www.righetti.us/\n\nPrincipal: Karen RotondiEmail the principal: [email protected]\n\nStudent Demographics\n\nStudent Enrollment\n\nThe total enrollment at Ernest Righetti High School is 2099 students, making it a large high school, in the top 25% of all California high schools by size.\n\nAttending Ernest Righetti High will feel like attending a small college. You'll have a few hundred students in your class, enough to provide an interesting set of activities, sports, and classes to try. But compared to the largest high schools in California, the student body size won't be overwhelming.\n\nGrowth in Student Body Size\n\nIs Ernest Righetti High School growing or shrinking? This will help you see trends in where the school is headed.\n\nFrom our calculations, the enrollment at Ernest Righetti High has decreased over the past few years. We calculate this by comparing enrollment in grades 9 to 12.\n\nMale Students Female Students All Students 9th grade 267 249 516 10th grade 283 276 559 11th grade 256 240 496 12th grade 265 263 528\n\nAs you can see in the table above, the senior class is 12 students larger than the freshman class. This suggests that Ernest Righetti High is shrinking in size and taking on fewer students.\n\nThere are a few reasons this can happen. The population of Santa Maria could be decreasing, thus sending fewer students into Ernest Righetti High. Alternatively, other schools (like charter or private schools) might be appearing, drawing students away.\n\nGender Split\n\nAre there more boys or girls at Ernest Righetti High School?\n\nFrom our statistics, Ernest Righetti High has a 52:48 split between male and female students in the high school grades.\n\nErnest Righetti High has a balanced male-female ratio that's largely representative of the general population in Santa Barbara County. Since the student body is roughly half and half, it should feel like there are equal numbers of boys and girls in your classes.\n\nThis usually means that Ernest Righetti High doesn't strongly select for either males or females, unlike other schools that have a large majority of males or females.\n\nEthnicity Breakdown\n\nWhat's the racial diversity at Ernest Righetti High School? Does one ethnicity make up most of the student body, or is it fairly balanced?\n\nFrom our statistics, Ernest Righetti High has a somewhat homogenous student body, with the majority of students identifying as one ethnicity, but not representing over 70% of the student body. Most schools in California fit this profile, so Ernest Righetti High isn't out of the ordinary. Most students attending class with you will be of the predominant ethnicity, but there will be meaningful diversity from other races.\n\nThe majority of students at Ernest Righetti High are Hispanic. In California, Hispanic students make up the majority of all students at 51.5%, and are thus the most common ethnicity. Predominantly Hispanic schools are the most common type of homogenous school, and Ernest Righetti High fits within this category.\n\nPercentage Number American Indian/Alaska Native 0.4% 10 Asian 3.4% 73 Hispanic 58.2% 1222 Black 1.6% 35 White 31.6% 665 Hawaiian Native/Pacific Islander 0.0% 2 Two or more races 4.3% 92\n\nHigh schools usually reflect the population in the surrounding area, so the ethnicities of students likely resembles those of Santa Maria. If you'd like to see how other nearby schools look in diversity, just google \"[name of school] prepscholar\" to find our guide to that specific school.\n\nIncome Level of Ernest Righetti High Families\n\nWhat are the family incomes of students at Ernest Righetti High School? To determine this, we look at the number of students who qualify for free or reduced lunches, a classification by the US federal government.\n\nTo qualify for a reduced price meal, family income needs to be below 185% of the federal poverty guidelines. For a family of 4, this means an income of around $45,000 or below.\n\nTo qualify for a free meal, family income needs to be below 130% of the federal poverty guidelines. For a family of 4, this means an income of around $32,000 or below.\n\nThe lower the percentage of students who qualify for free or reduced price meals, the higher the income levels are likely to be.\n\nAt Ernest Righetti High, 11.5% of students qualify for reduced-price lunches, and 35.9% qualify for free lunches.\n\nThis means Ernest Righetti High has a below average level of poverty. With most students not qualifying for free or reduced price lunches, Ernest Righetti High is below average among California schools in poverty level. The income level of families in Santa Maria is thus likely to be relatively high.\n\nNumber Percent Reduced-price lunches 242 11.5% Free lunches 754 35.9% Do not qualify for reduced-price or free lunches 1103 52.5%\n\nAs with ethnicity, this likely reflects the surrounding community in Santa Maria and doesn't speak much about the school itself.\n\nErnest Righetti High is in the middle 50% of schools by income level. Generally, higher income level schools are better-funded and have a higher quality range of classes and activities. Ernest Righetti High is likely in the middle of the pack in this regard and will give you a good set of options to try.\n\nIf you have any interests that Ernest Righetti High doesn't cover, look to your local community for activities, or to the Internet for self-study AP classes.\n\nSchool Safety\n\nHow safe is Ernest Righetti High School to attend? Can you expect a lot of conflict as a student here?\n\nTo study this, we look at disciplinary data for two types of incidents at Ernest Righetti High: referrals to law enforcement (when incidents are reported to police), and arrests.\n\nThese are the most serious disciplinary actions available to school administration and are more severe than suspensions or expulsions. Suspensions are often discretionary and can be given just for being disruptive in class. In contrast, law enforcement referrals and arrests often indicate incidents that put the safety of other Ernest Righetti High students at risk.\n\nWith this record, is Ernest Righetti High School significantly different from other schools in the area? It could be that Ernest Righetti High has an especially bad record, or it could be that the local area shows a pattern.\n\nCompare this school with other high schools in the same school district, using the following table:\n\nSanta Maria Joint Union High School District Safety\n\nSchool Name Total Referred Total Arrests Enrollment Delta High 4 2 187 Santa Maria High 4 6 2283 Pioneer Valley High 0 0 2648\n\nAcademic Performance\n\nNow we get to a major aspect of assessing a high school: academic performance. How good of an education will you get at Ernest Righetti High School? Will you be competitive for college? Will you have access to advanced classes?\n\nWe've compiled everything we could find about Ernest Righetti High's academics here.\n\nGraduation Rate\n\nTo start off, an important benchmark of academic achievement is graduation rate. For all students who start high school at Ernest Righetti High, the state of California wants as many students to graduate as possible, since a high school diploma can mean a big difference in getting a job.\n\nNote: This data comes from a few years back, but the trends are likely to stay the same, since schools don't get significantly better or worse within a short period of time.\n\nStandardized Testing\n\nNext, we'll look at another major piece of high school academics: standardized testing performance for Ernest Righetti High School students. These are tests that are administered to large populations of students for comparison purposes.\n\nLet’s start by taking a look at the data for nationally administered standardized tests.\n\nSAT Scores\n\nAs you probably know, the SAT is a critical test used for college admissions. The higher the score you get, the better your academic performance compared to students nationwide, and the easier it is to get into top colleges.\n\nWe did in-depth research and found the average Ernest Righetti High School SAT scores.\n\nHere's a breakdown of SAT scores by section:\n\nAverage SAT Scores (2013-2014)\n\nSource Critical Reading Math Writing Composite Ernest Righetti High 490 495 482 1460 California 498 510 496 1504 United States 495 511 484 1490\n\nNote that the SAT has since changed to a 1600 scale, but the trends above for your high school are likely to continue. Just use this guide to convert between the old 2400 scale and the new 1600 scale.\n\nTo learn more about SAT percentile rankings, read our guide on what SAT percentiles really mean.\n\nHow good is 1460 as an SAT score? Find out with our complete 1460 SAT score guide, including which colleges you can get into with a 1460 or any other SAT score!\n\nACT Scores\n\nIn California, the ACT is less popular than the SAT. Fewer students take the ACT, and typically these students are more motivated and academically prepared for college. Therefore, it's harder to compare Ernest Righetti High School ACT scores with the rest of the country.\n\nHere are the average English, Math, Reading, and Science scores for Ernest Righetti High compared to California and the US:\n\nAverage ACT Scores\n\nSource English Math Reading Science Ernest Righetti High 22 22 23 22 California 21.8 22.8 22.3 21.7 United States 20.3 20.9 21.3 20.8\n\nScores provided are for the 2013-14 school year.\n\nFind out more about percentile rankings and the ACT in this article.\n\nEvery individual is different. What counts as a good ACT score for you? Learn more with this article!\n\nAdvanced Placement (AP)\n\nAdvanced Placement (AP) classes are college-level courses that are an additional academic challenge may give Ernest Righetti High School students credit for college.\n\nHere's what we're looking for: high average AP test scores as well as high AP passing rates.\n\nAP Scores\n\nEvery year, roughly 216 students in grades 9-12 at Ernest Righetti High take 444 AP exams. It's important to understand how students score on the AP - earning a 3, 4, or 5 on the AP test means passing the test and often earning college credit.\n\nWe have specific data on how many students got a 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 (out of 5) on AP exams in the chart below:\n\nAP Test-Taking Statistics\n\nAnother way to gauge the quality of a school's AP program is to see how many AP students actually took AP exams at Ernest Righetti High School. If a lot of students enroll in AP courses but don't actually take the AP tests, it can be a sign that students don't feel adequately prepared to take the test, or the school isn't encouraging students to take the exams enough.\n\nNote: The most recent data we have available is from 2012, so the statistics may have changed since then. Most likely, however, the trends are likely to continue - above average schools are likely to stay above average, and below average schools are likely to stay below average.\n\nAP Passing Rates\n\nFor AP students at Ernest Righetti High School who take the exam, it's important to know how they do. Here we have specific data on how many students got a passing grade (a 3 or above) on all, some, or none of the AP exams that they took.\n\nTo find out the passing rates for specific AP courses at Ernest Righetti High School, you'll have to talk to your guidance counselor (who can then help you find that information). For instance, one AP Calculus teacher may have an above-90% passing rate, while another might only have a 50% passing rate. If you can, you'll want to take the class with the teacher who has more students get a 3 or above on the AP exam.\n\nFind out more about the average score for each AP subject here.\n\nState Tests\n\nAs of 2014, eleventh graders attending Ernest Righetti High School must take standardized tests in English/Language Arts and Math as part of the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress (CAASPP). These align with the new Common Core standards and are called the \"Smarter Balanced\" tests.\n\nIf Ernest Righetti High students meet or exceed state standards, they're academically prepared to graduate high school and go to college. Specifically, we care about the percentage of students who meet or exceed state standards. The larger this number, the higher the preparation of students at Ernest Righetti High.\n\nEnglish/Language Arts\n\nEnglish/Language Arts Test Results (2015)\n\nRead more about what’s measured in each ELA area score here.\n\nMath\n\nThe other major test taken for state assessments is Math. Across the state, Math performance is generally lower than English/Language Arts performance, so it's natural for this number to be lower.\n\nMath Test Results (2015)\n\nRead more about what’s measured in each Math area score, go here.\n\nAcademic Offerings\n\nIn addition to the standard high school curriculum, many high schools like Ernest Righetti High School offer advanced coursework as part of the Advanced Placement (AP) or International Baccalaureate (IB) programs.\n\nBrief Intro to AP/IB\n\nAP and IB courses are designed at the difficulty level of college introductory classes. There are several important benefits to taking advanced coursework at Ernest Righetti High. First, taking more advanced classes shows colleges that you're committed to challenging yourself academically, and that you're one of the more advanced students at Ernest Righetti High. Taking AP/IB classes also raises your weighted GPA and makes you a stronger college applicant.\n\nFurthermore, many colleges will accept your Ernest Righetti High AP/IB coursework as college coursework. In some cases, you'll be able to skip introductory-level classes and move to more advanced classes. In other cases, you'll be able to avoid having to take required courses and might even be able to graduate earlier than the standard 4 years. Often this will require you to pass the AP test, getting a score of 3 or above.\n\nSo what advanced courses does Ernest Righetti High School offer?\n\nAP Courses\n\nErnest Righetti High School offers AP courses in 17 subjects.\n\nThis is an impressive number of AP subjects, putting Ernest Righetti High School in the top 25% of California schools in AP offerings. You'll likely have all of the most popular AP courses available to you, as well as some broader interests.\n\nThe total number of AP subjects is 38, so Ernest Righetti High is missing a good number of subjects, but these are likely the least popular subjects, like less popular foreign languages. If there are any AP courses you want to take that aren't being offered at Ernest Righetti High, ask your counselor for other options.\n\nOf course, keep in mind that quality matters even more than quantity - it's important that your AP courses are taught well by engaging teachers. But the strong AP program at Ernest Righetti High likely means you'll be in good hands.\n\nThe following AP courses were offered at Ernest Righetti High during 2015-2016:\n\nCourse Title Biology Calculus AB Calculus BC Chemistry English Language and Composition English Literature and Composition Environmental Science Microeconomics Physics 1: Algebra-Based Spanish Language and Culture Spanish Literature and Culture Statistics Studio Art: 2-D Design Studio Art: Drawing United States Government and Politics United States History World History\n\nSports Teams\n\nFinally, we'll cover which sports teams are available at Ernest Righetti High School. Sports are an integral part of many students' high school experiences.
