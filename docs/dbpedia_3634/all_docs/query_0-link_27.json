We employ deep immune profiling and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing and examine proliferation to assess how ART impacts T cell homeostasis. In PWH on long-term ART, lymphocyte frequencies and phenotypes are mostly stable. By contrast, broad phenotypic changes in natural killer (NK) cells, γδ T cells, B cells, and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are observed in the post-ART window. Whereas CD8+ T cells mostly restore, memory CD4+ T subsets and cytolytic NK cells show incomplete restoration 1.4 years post ART. Surprisingly, the hierarchies and frequencies of dominant CD4 TCR clonotypes (0.1%–11% of all CD4+ T cells) remain stable post ART, suggesting that clonal homeostasis can be independent of homeostatic processes regulating CD4+ T cell absolute number, phenotypes, and function. The slow restoration of host immunity post ART also has implications for the design of ART interruption studies.\n\nKeywords: human, homeostasis, T cell receptor, HIV, antiretroviral therapy, latency, mass cytometry, TCR sequencing\n\nHighlights\n\n•\n\nAlmost all immune lineages are dysregulated in people with HIV (PWH)\n\n•\n\nAntiretroviral therapy (ART) rapidly controls HIV and initiates immune restoration\n\n•\n\nRestoration of frequency, function, and phenotype of immune lineages takes years\n\n•\n\nRemarkably, dominant T cell receptor clonotypes are stable in the post-ART window\n\nIn this study, we demonstrate the widespread immune dysregulation wrought by HIV infection and show that, while drugs can control HIV levels within months, many facets of our immune system take years to restore. This study has direct implications for how we design studies aimed at curing HIV.\n\nIntroduction\n\nImmune homeostasis is a broad term that describes processes that maintain equilibrium within and between immune compartments. This can include maintenance of immune cell numbers, phenotype, function, and immune memory.\n\nHuman immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV), which mostly infects CD4+ T cells, profoundly impacts immune homeostasis. HIV viremia increases levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines1 and cell cycling and drives chronic cellular activation across multiple immune lineages (e.g., CD38, Human Leukocyte Antigen [HLA]-DR, PD-1),2,3 which contributes to dysregulation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells,4,5,6,7 γδ T cells,8,9 natural killer (NK) cells,10,11,12 B cells,13,14,15 and monocytes.16,17\n\nDysregulation of T cell homeostasis in HIV infection is associated with altered levels of the homeostatic cytokines interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-7, and IL-15.18,19,20 IL-7/IL-7 receptor signaling, which increases expression of anti-apoptotic proteins that include Bcl-2, is particularly important for the generation of long-lived virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in humans and animal models.7,19,21,22,23,24 The IL-7 receptor is comprised of the common γ chain and an α chain, CD127. In HIV infection, long-lived T cells expressing CD127 are lost,19,25,26 contributing to loss of immunological memory, evidenced by poor responses to vaccination.7\n\nModern combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) blocks multiple stages of HIV replication and rapidly decreases HIV viremia within weeks to months of treatment whether individuals are in acute or chronic stages of infection.27,28 People with HIV (PWH) on ART now enjoy near-normal life spans.29,30 Sustained ART has been documented to allow broad immune restoration, though in individuals who initiate ART in the chronic stage of infection, the CD4:CD8 ratio often does not restore.31,32,33 Individuals with poor CD4+ T cell reconstitution and/or sustained low CD4:CD8 ratios experience higher rates of HIV co-morbidities despite durable virus suppression.32,34,35\n\nART does not prevent CD4+ T cells already infected with HIV from entering latency. These latently infected cells reactivate stochastically and drive HIV rebound following ART interruption.36,37 HIV sequencing has identified identical or near-identical HIV proviruses in a person many years apart.38,39,40 These observations support a model where decay of the reservoir of latently infected cells is slowed in PWH through homeostatic maintenance of long-lived CD4+ T cells.\n\nHIV entry into latency can occur at all stages of infection, though, on average, the majority of the CD4+ T cell HIV reservoir is derived from cells infected in and around the time of ART initiation.41,42,43 These studies suggest that changes wrought by ART initiation facilitate stabilization of infected cells entering latency. Moreover, these studies suggest that targeted therapies near the time of ART initiation could block HIV reservoir stabilization, decrease overall reservoir size, and accelerate HIV cure strategies.42,44 Other approaches to HIV cure include therapies and vaccines to increase circulating innate and adaptive immunity against HIV.45\n\nAltogether, these studies suggest that the post-ART window is critical for the restoration of immune homeostasis, health in PWH, and entry of HIV-infected cells into the stable reservoir. Here we used a combination of mass cytometry, T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing of CD4+ T cells and functional proliferation assays to document the kinetics of immune restoration in PWH in the first 500 days following ART initiation. Overall, we found that immune restoration occurs with variable kinetics across lymphocyte lineages, including T cell subsets, and continues well after virus suppression has been achieved. Most surprisingly, over this period, dominant CD4 TCR clonotypes retained their overall frequency and rank order, suggesting that clonal homeostasis of dominant TCRs is independent of homeostatic process that regulate CD4+ T cell numbers, phenotype, and function.\n\nResults\n\nStudy cohorts\n\nWe compared the phenotype and function of blood immune cells over a 17- to 26-month window of two HIV-seropositive cohorts ( A and 1B). In the first cohort, A5248, participants, all diagnosed in the chronic stage of HIV infection, were sampled up to 12 times in the 504 days from ART initiation. ART, which included an integrase inhibitor, resulted in rapid decreases in viral load (VL) and full suppression within 12 weeks in all participants (day 84) of treatment ( C).46\n\nAll but one participant, 611172, experienced ART-mediated CD4 T cell recovery (CD4 count ≥ 400 cells/mm3 on day 504) ( C). Overall CD8 T cell counts decreased over the study window; however, the differences in means on day 0 and day 504 were not significant ( C; p = 0.3750, Wilcoxon signed-rank test).47,48 The CD4:CD8 ratio increased but, relative to ratios reported in healthy individuals, remained inverted ( C; Table S1).49 While the A5428 follow-up window was limited, 611172 exhibited both a low frequency of naive CD4+ T cells (611172 1.9%, cohort average 9.2%, n = 10) and high PD-1+CD4+ T cells (611172 70.6%, cohort average 39.6%, n = 10), suggesting he was an immunological non-responder (INR).50,51,52 Notably, 611172 was not an outlier for other measures of immune reconstitution or T cell proliferation, as detailed below.\n\nThe second cohort comprised PWH also diagnosed with chronic HIV infection and who have been on ART for an average of 6.7 years (range, 1.8–20.1). All participants were durably suppressed and had stable CD4:CD8 ratios ( D). Throughout this paper, we refer to the ART initiation cohort as A5248 and to the long-term ART-suppressed cohort as LT-ART. Both cohorts were predominantly male with comparable pre-ART VL and pre-ART CD4+ counts (Table S1).\n\nART initiation elicits time-associated changes across leukocyte populations\n\nWe first performed unbiased metaclustering of 31-marker mass cytometry data using the PhenoGraph algorithm.53 PhenoGraph identified phenotypically similar CD45+ cell populations shared across participants and time points in each cohort (Figures S1A–S1D). Annotation of the metaclusters was based on expression of 25 proteins (Figures S1B and S1D, “cell types”). For A5248, all but two metaclusters (C10 and C15) were confidently annotated. C10 and C15 were CD45+ but otherwise lacked identifying lineage markers (Figure S1B). The successfully annotated cell populations included naive and memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets, γδ T cells, NK cells, and B cells and classical, non-classical, and intermediate monocytes.\n\nWe trained a penalized linear regression model, elastic net (EN), to ascertain whether changes in metacluster-derived features were predictive of the CD4+ T cell count from each participant ( C), but no features were predictive (median R2 = −3.241; Figure S2). Additionally, no correlation was detected between activation marker frequency on CD4+ T cells and baseline CD4 count or pre-ART VL (Figures S2B and S2C). EN model training did identify immune features in A5248 participants that were predictive of time on ART.54 This analysis focused on expression patterns within annotated clusters of protein markers (CD127, Bcl-2, PD-1, CD57, Ki-67, CCR5, CD38, and HLA-DR) that are dysregulated in T cells following HIV infection.2,23,55,56,57 Changes across multiple leukocyte lineages were associated with the time following ART (median R2 = 0.466 across cross-validation folds; A). Notably, several protein markers showed similar expression changes across different lineages. We add that caution must be taken with interpretation of monocyte subset data given that monocyte frequency may be impacted by the freeze-thaw process.58\n\nIn the LT-ART cohort, no features were predictive of time (median R2 = −0.169), suggesting greater stability of leukocyte populations when individuals had been durably suppressed (Figure S1).\n\nFixed-effects model identified consistent phenotypic changes in immune lineages following ART initiation\n\nTo quantify trends observed in the EN model analysis ( A), we used quasi-binomial fixed-effects (QBFE) regression for analysis of %frequencies (Figures S3–S5). Note that, while higher-frequency cell populations were identified using unsupervised and supervised (manual gating) methods, we found improved discrimination of lower-frequency T cell subpopulations using manual gating (data not shown). Therefore, manual gating was used for all subsequent analyses. In QBFE regression analysis, changes over time are denoted as the average percentage point increase (+) or decrease (−) per 30-day window. Study numbers were too small to subdivide post-ART data and separately calculate changes in slope within this study period.\n\nTotal T cells\n\nIn A5248, the frequency of CD4+ T cells (day 0 range: 10.5%–41.4%) increased, on average, +0.68 percentage points (%pts) every 30 days post ART initiation (day 504 range: 20.1%–56.4%), consistent with increases in absolute CD4 T cell counts within most participants ( D). The relative frequency of CD4+ T cells continued to increase in the LT-ART group (+0.17%pts). This suggested, consistent with other reports, that, even after years of virus suppression, CD4+ T cell absolute numbers continued to restore.59,60 CD8+ T cell frequencies concomitantly decreased (−0.59%pts), and smaller but significant decreases were observed in the LT-ART cohort (−0.22%pts; ).\n\nTable 1\n\nLineageAnnotationManual gatingA5248a,b(%pts/30 days)LT-ARTa,c (%pts/30 days)CD4+ T cellsCD4+ T cellsCD3+ CD4++0.68+0.17CD8+ T cellsCD8+ T cellsCD3+ CD8+−0.59−0.22B cellsmemory B cells (total)dCD19+ CD27+ CD38−−0.15–plasmablastsCD19+ CD27+ CD38+−0.08–B cellsCD19+ CD27−+0.20–Ki-67CD19+ Ki-67+−0.17–CD38CD19+ CD38+−0.29–PD-1CD19+ PD-1+−0.25–Bcl-2CD19+ Bcl-2++0.95–CD127CD19+ CD127+––NK cellscytotoxic NK cellsCD3− CD14− CD19− CD56lo CD16++0.48–pro-inflammatory NK cellsCD3− CD14− CD19− CD56bright CD16−––CD56− NK cellseCD3− CD14− CD19− CD56− CD16+−0.52–Ki-67CD3− CD14− CD19− CD56+ CD16+ Ki-67+−0.06–CD38CD3− CD14− CD19− CD56+ CD16+ CD38+−0.62–PD-1CD3− CD14− CD19− CD56+ CD16+ PD-1+−0.23–Bcl-2CD3− CD14− CD19− CD56+ CD16+ Bcl-2++1.03–CD127CD3− CD14− CD19− CD56+ CD16+ CD127++0.36–γδ T cellsγδ T cellsCD3+ TCRγδ+−0.05–Ki-67CD3+ TCRγδ+ Ki-67+−0.21–CD38CD3+ TCRγδ+ CD38+−1.57–PD-1CD3+ TCRγδ+ PD-1+−0.35−0.12Bcl-2CD3+ TCRγδ+ Bcl-2++0.59–CD127CD3+ TCRγδ+ CD127++0.31–\n\nB cells\n\nIn A5248, B cell frequencies significantly increased over time (+0.20%pts). This was consistent with an observed increased frequency of Bcl-2+ B cells (+0.95%pts), altogether suggesting greatly improved B cell survival following ART ( A and 2B; and S2). Cell cycling, measured by Ki-67, which is expressed in all active stages of the cell cycle,63,64 and activation markers, CD38 and PD-1, also significantly decreased in B cells. We lacked markers to comprehensively assess B cell subpopulations, but, consistent with previous reports, we observed post-ART decreases in frequencies of plasmablasts.65,66 Increases in resting memory and naive B cell frequencies and decreases in frequencies of immature transitional and mature activated B cells have been described previously ∼12 months post ART.67 Here, total memory CD27+ CD38− B cells increased post ART initiation, but we were unable to discriminate between mature, activated, and resting memory B cells ( ).\n\nNK cells\n\nCD56 is a canonical marker of NK cells. However, in HIV infection, dysfunctional CD56−CD16+ NK cells have been described.10,62 Accordingly, changes in CD56 frequency were resolved into CD56bright and CD56lo expression as well as CD56− NK cells and examined.68,69 Consistent with previous descriptions of ART restoration of NK cells, frequencies of cytotoxic CD56lo NK cells, which mediate strong cytotoxicity in response to receptor engagement, increased significantly following ART (+0.48%pts),70 offsetting comparable decreases in dysfunctional CD56− NK cells. Similar to B cells, significant increases in the frequency of Bcl-2 frequency (+1.03%pts) as well as decreases in Ki-67, CD38, and PD-1 frequencies (−0.06%pts, −0.62%pts, and −0.23%pts, respectively) were observed following ART in total NK cells ( B; ). While no changes in the frequency of CD127+ B cells were detected, strong and sustained increases in CD127+ NK cells were observed.\n\nγδ T cells\n\nOverall γδ T cell frequencies exhibited a minor but significant decrease post ART ( B; ). Similar to the changes observed in other lymphocytes, ART initiation resulted in significant decreases in cell cycling (−0.21%pts) as well as CD38+ (−1.57%pts) and PD-1+ (−0.38%pts) frequencies and increases in Bcl-2+ (+0.59%pts) and CD127+ (+0.31%pts) populations in γδ T cells.\n\nThese dynamic and broad post-ART changes contrasted with longitudinal studies in the LT-ART cohort, in which minimal changes across B cell, NK cell, and γδ T cell populations were observed over 17–26 months ( ; Figure S1).\n\nIn summary, modern ART regimens induced profound and parallel immune restoration across multiple leukocyte lineages, impacting expression levels of multiple survival and activation markers.\n\nART initiation induced dynamic changes in CD4+ T cell subpopulations\n\nWe next focused on the impact of ART on 35 CD4+ T cell subpopulations in our study cohorts. Different models were used to examine changes in %frequency of cell subsets (QBFE regression) and in mean signal intensity (MSI) of proteins (γ-fixed effects [GFEs]) over time ( and S3–S5). Phenotypic changes were observed in CD4+ T cells in the A5248 cohort, coinciding with strong, early decreases and initial VL suppression by day 84 ( C). For the Ki-67+ and CD38+ CD4+ T cell populations, we observed significant differences in %frequency between day 0 and day 84 (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test; A) that continued through the 500-day study window ( ). For CD38 and other markers associated with cellular activation (HLA-DR, PD-1, and CCR5), significant decreases in MSI were also observed from day 0 to day 84 (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test; B). In contrast, Bcl-2+ CD4+ T cells increased by day 84 and continued to increase over the full study window ( A; ), coinciding with an increase in MSI of Bcl-2 ( B).\n\nTable 2\n\nAnnotationManual gatingCD4+ T cellsCD8+ T cellsA5248a,b (%pts/30 days)LT-ARTb,c (%pts/30 days)A5248a,b (%pts/30 days)LT-ARTb,c (%pts/30 days)SenescentCD57+−0.28–+0.32–ActivatedCD25+––––ActivatedCD38+ HLA-DR+−0.34–−0.93–ActivatedCD38+−0.65–−2.45–ActivatedHLA-DR+−0.40–−0.71–ActivatedCCR5+−0.21–−0.60–ExhaustedPD-1+−0.64–−1.35–Cell cyclingKi-67+−0.11–−0.11–CytotoxicCD56+NDND+0.11–SurvivalBcl-2++0.37–+0.74–LongevityCD127++0.57–+0.91–RTECD45RA+ CD31+–ND//d//RTE CD127+CD45RA+ CD31+ CD127++0.33ND////NaiveCD45RA+ CCR7+ CD28+ CD95−+0.33–+0.32–Naive CD127+CD45RA+ CCR7+ CD28+ CD95− CD127+––––Stem cell memoryCD45RA+ CCR7+ CD28+ CD95+––+0.02+0.05Stem cell memory CD127+CD45RA+ CCR7+ CD28+ CD95+ CD127++0.27+0.10+0.40−0.09Central memoryCD45RA− CCR7+ CD28+ CD95+––+0.10+0.07Central memory CD127+CD45RA− CCR7+ CD28+ CD95+ CD127++0.63–+1.22–Transitional memoryCD45RA− CCR7− CD28+ CD95−−0.13–+0.08+0.06Transitional memory CD127+CD45RA− CCR7− CD28+ CD95− CD127++0.65–+1.56–Effector memoryCD45RA− CCR7− CD28− CD95−−0.27–−0.93–Effector memory CD127+CD45RA− CCR7− CD28− CD95− CD127+––+0.59+0.17Terminal effectorsCD45RA+ CCR7− CD28+ CD95−−0.03–+0.26−0.15Terminal effectors CD127+CD45RA+ CCR7− CD28+ CD95− CD127+–+0.25+0.29+0.14CD99hiCD99hi––––CD99hi CD127+CD99hi CD127++0.57–+0.73–Th1CXCR3+ CCR4− CCR6− CCR10−––NDNDTh2CXCR3− CCR4+ CCR6− CCR10−+0.12–NDNDTh17CXCR3−CCR4+CCR6+ CCR10−––NDNDTh17.1CXCR3+ CCR4− CCR6− CCR10−−0.07–NDNDTh22CCR4+CCR6+CCR10++0.01–NDNDTh9CCR4− CCR6+−0.10–NDNDTregCD25+ CD127− FoxP3+−0.08–NDNDTfhCXCR5+ PD-1+CD45RA−––NDND\n\nOver the full 500-day study window, a wider number of phenotypic changes, including many highly significant, were observed across CD4+ T cell subsets ( ; ; Tables S3 and S5). We observed that the %frequency of activation and cell cycling CD4+ T cell populations (HLA-DR+, CD38+, CCR5+, CD57+, PD-1+, and Ki-67+) decreased, consistent with a decrease in MSI of these proteins over the first 500 days following ART ( B; ).\n\nMSI changes in CD95 and CD28, which mark the transition from naive to memory T cells,72 were consistent with observed increases in naive CD4+ T cells and decreases in transitional memory, effector memory, and terminal effector CD4+ T cells subsets ( ). No change in the frequency of recent thymic emigrants (RTEs), stem cell memory, or central memory CD4+ T cells was detected. In total and multiple memory CD4+ T cell subsets, the %frequency of CD127 increased ( C; ). CD127+ recent thymic CD4+ T cell emigrants also increased significantly ( ). Notably, the proportion of CD127+ CD99hi CD4+ T memory cells also increased.73 Altogether, increased CD127 frequencies are consistent with improved memory maintenance in CD4+ T cells following ART.24\n\nRelative to other changes, CD4+ T cell helper subsets, defined by surface expression of chemokine receptors that have been linked to function,74,75,76,77 exhibited modest changes following ART initiation. Frequencies of Th1, Th17, and Tfh cells did not change, but we observed modest but significant increases in Th2 (+0.12%pts) and Th22 (+0.01%pts), whereas T regulatory (Treg; −0.08%pts), Th17.1 (−0.07%pts), and Th9 (−0.10%pts) populations decreased ( ). These changes reflected changes in the MSI of population markers post ART. CCR4, used to gate Th2, significantly increased, whereas the Treg cell lineage marker FoxP3 decreased ( B).\n\nOverall, 500 days of ART produced sustained recovery of naive CD4+ T cells but had modest effects on frequencies of major memory and helper CD4+ T cell subsets. Within RTEs and less differentiated memory subsets, significant increases in the proportion of CD127+ cells were observed. ART induced early and sustained reduction of activated and cycling markers while increasing Bcl-2+ CD4+ T cells, altogether consistent with ART-mediated immune reconstitution of CD4+ T cells.\n\nCD4+ T cell populations were highly stable in LT-ART individuals\n\nIn contrast to A5248, in the LT-ART cohort, CD4+ T cell memory subsets, helper subsets, and activation markers on CD4+ T cells were stable over 17–26 months with no significant changes detected over time in the frequency of measured populations, except CD127+ memory T cells ( ). Frequencies of CD127+ stem cell memory and CD127+ terminal effector CD4+ T cells increased over time (+0.10%pts and +0.25%pts, respectively) ( C; and S3; Figure S1).\n\nTo examine the level of restoration of CD4+ T cell population frequencies post ART, we compared means between A5248 day 504 and the average across time points 1–3 in the LT-ART cohort. In total CD4+ T cells, CD38 as well as CD38/HLA-DR frequencies were significantly higher on day 504 compared with the LT-ART cohort. We note that %HLA-DR+ and CD38+ correlated with time on ART in the LT-ART cohort (Figure S2D). Conversely, the CD127 and Bcl-2 frequencies were significantly lower ( D). We further examined CD127 expression in memory CD4+ T cell populations, again finding that frequencies of CD127 were significantly lower in naive, central, transitional, effector, and terminal effector memory populations ( C). We further noted, in the LT-ART cohort, that CD127+ frequency on effector memory and terminal effector CD4+ T cells directly correlated with years suppressed (p < 0.05, Spearman rank; E). Altogether, this suggests that normalization of cellular activation and recovery of CD4+ T cell memory maintenance post ART is ongoing but slow, occurring over years.\n\nCD8+ T cells exhibit more rapid memory restoration post ART than CD4+ T cells\n\nWe observed significant changes in frequencies of 22/25 CD8+ T cell populations in A5248 post ART ( A; ) that were coupled with highly significant changes in MSI ( B).\n\nEarly decreases were observed in the proportions of CD8+ T cells expressing the activation markers Ki-67, CD38, HLA-DR, and PD-1 by day 84 (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test; A) that continued across the 504-day study window (QBFE regression; ). Other cellular markers of activation, CCR5 and CD38/HLA-DR, also decreased over the full study window.\n\nIncreased frequencies of Bcl-2+ CD8+ T cells were detected by day 84 and continued to increase across the full study window ( ), consistent with increased Bcl-2 MSI ( B) and previous studies.23,78 Similar to CD4+ T cells, no early changes in the frequency of CD127+ CD8+ T cell were detected ( A and 4B), but over 500 days, the percentage and MSI of CD127 increased significantly on CD8+ T cells ( ; B; Table S4). Many other phenotypic markers showed either highly significant increases (CD45RA, CCR7, CD28, and CCR4) or decreases (Ki-67, CD38, HLA-DR, PD-1, CD95, and CCR5) in cellular expression following ART initiation. Notably, the percentage and MSI of CD56, which has been associated with regain of lytic capacity in CD8+ T cells,79 increased strongly over the 504-day study window ( B; ).\n\nNaive, stem cell memory, central memory, transitional memory, and terminal effector CD8+ T cell frequencies significantly increased, whereas the frequency of effector memory CD8+ T cells strongly decreased post ART initiation ( ). These changes in memory subsets reflected highly significant changes in expression of memory markers (CD45RA, CCR7, CD95, and CD28) in CD8+ T cells over the study window ( B).\n\nWhen comparing the changes across time of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, we noted the same trends (increases or decreases) between CD4+ and CD8+ T cells subsets; however, CD8+ T cell subpopulations exhibited more rapid changes than CD4+ T cells. CD8+ T cells showed a steeper average increase in Bcl-2 (+0.74%pts) and CD127 (+0.91%pts) compared with CD4+ T cells (+0.37% and +0.57%pts, respectively) as well as steeper average decreases in expression of activation markers (CCR5+, PD-1+, CD38+HLA-DR+) ( ). The frequency of CD127 in memory CD8+ T cell subsets also increased more strongly than in CD4+ T memory cells ( ). The one exception between CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was the activation/senescence marker CD57, which significantly increased in CD8+ T cells but decreased in CD4+ T cells ( ). Overall, the patterns of CD127 and CD57 expression in CD8+ T cells post ART complement previous in vivo labeling studies finding that HIV infection results in the loss of two long-lived CD8+ T cell populations, CD127+ central memory and CD45RA+CD57+ effector memory CD8+ T cells, in PWH.80\n\nWe next compared CD8+ T cell subsets 504 days following ART in A2458 with the LT-ART group. We note first that, similar to CD4+ T cells in the LT-ART group, only small changes in CD8+ T cell subsets, mostly memory subsets, were observed over time. Average frequencies of CD38+ and HLA-DR+ but not CD38/HLA-DR+ CD8+ T cells in A5248 participants were significantly higher than in the LT-ART cohort ( C). Frequencies of Bcl-2+ and CD127+ CD8+ T cells did not significantly differ ( C). Within memory CD8+ T cell populations, CD127 frequencies also did not significantly differ between A5248 day 504 and LT-ART ( D), though we note, similar to CD4+ T cells, an ongoing increase in CD127+ CD8+ T cell frequencies with time on ART in the LT-ART group (Figure S2). Altogether, while our data suggest elevated CD8+ T cell activation 500 days post ART, markers of CD8+ T cell memory and survival were largely re-established.\n\nCytolytic NK cells restore more slowly than CD8+ T cells post ART\n\nCD56lo NK cell frequencies on day 504 in the A5248 group (average 16.1%, 1.5%–47.6%) were significantly lower than in the LT-ART cohort (average 43.7%, 24.6%–70.4%, p = 0.0003, Mann-Whitney U test), suggesting that, similar to CD4+ T cells, cytotoxic NK cells are slower to restore than CD8+ T cells post ART ( E).\n\nVL decrease did not impact dominant CD4+ T cell clonotype frequency\n\nOur phenotyping had shown that, in addition to absolute increases in CD4+ T cell counts ( D), CD4+ T cell populations post ART were undergoing significant immune reconstitution, albeit at slower rates than other immune lineages. Given these observations, we hypothesized that CD4+ T cell immune restoration would result in dynamic changes, likely expansion, of CD4+ T cell clonotypes post ART.\n\nWe sequenced the TCR of 105 CD4+ T cells 0, 7/10, 21, 84, and 504 days post ART initiation from the A5248 (n = 4) cohort and 0, 4–5, and 17–19 months after time point 1 in the LT-ART group (n = 3). Morisita-Horn analysis showed no overlap between participants across both cohorts (Figure S6A). Of note, day 84 of 363043 exhibited lower similarity to the other four time points from this participant, suggesting a skewing of the TCR repertoire, possibly caused by an intercurrent infection.\n\nWe next compared the first and last visit in both cohorts ( A–5G, left column). Unsurprisingly, the majority of clonotypes sequenced (>85% across participants in both cohorts) were detected at only one time point. This reflects sample depth (105) relative to the overall theoretical maximal TCR diversity of 1011−15 and estimates of within-person diversity of 106–108.81,82,83,84 For clonotypes detected at both time points, two distinct populations were observed. Higher-frequency clonotypes (≥0.1%) showed strong rank-order correlations, and lower-frequency clonotypes (<0.1%) showed a weaker, albeit strongly significant, correlations. We next examined whether dominant clonotypes (≥0.1% at the first and last visit) were stable over time and whether clonotype hierarchies were maintained ( A–5D, second column; Table S6). A Spearman’s rank correlation matrix was generated for frequencies of dominant clonotypes at all time points. All correlations were positive, producing significant r values between 0.684 and 0.991, except the day 0–504 comparison for participant 291374 (r = 0.714, p = 0.06, n = 8 clonotypes) ( A–5D, third column; Table S7). It is notable that, while the absolute number of dominant TCRβ clonotypes in each A5248 participant was relatively small (8–30 of tens of thousands of clonotypes), their cumulative total was substantial, contributing between 12.5% and 18.9% of all clonotypes per participant across all time points (Table S7).\n\nData from the three LT-ART participants were similarly plotted and analyzed ( E–5G). Similar to A5248 participants, dominant clonotypes in LT-ART participants were stable and largely maintained rank order over time ( E–5G; Tables S6 and S7).\n\nWe analyzed the diversity and evenness of all clonotypes, using Shannon entropy and Pielou’s evenness. Measures were similar between A5248 and LT-ART participants and did not exhibit any consistent trends, either increasing or decreasing, over time (Figure S6B). In summary, longitudinal TCR sequencing suggests that ART initiation has minimal impact on shifts of clonal homeostasis of CD4+ T cells.\n\nSpecificity of CD4+ T cell TCR clonotypes\n\nWe examined the VDJ database, which houses TCR sequences for unique human epitopes (1,080 TCRs at time of search) to determine whether dominant TCRβ clonotypes (≥0.1%) matched known clonotypes.85,86 While human cytomegalovirus (HCMV)-, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-, and influenza-specific TCR clonotypes were detected in all participants, and HIV-1-specific TCR clonotypes were detected in four of seven participants, all clonotypes were low frequency (0.00044%–0.0072%) (Figure S6C).\n\nHIV-specific CD4+ T cell proliferation was undetectable in the first year post ART\n\nWe next investigated the proliferation capacity of CD4+ T cells (n = 8/group). Our aim was to examine whether proliferation better reflected the dynamic phenotypic changes observed in CD4+ T cells post ART or, the relatively stable clonotypic structure of CD4+ T cells. Over the first year following ART initiation, strong CD4+ T cell proliferation was observed in response to the mitogen phytohemagglutinin (PHA) ( H). This suggests that total CD4+ T cells harbored proliferation capacity. HCMV-specific but not HIV Gag/Nef-specific CD4+ T cell proliferation in the first 14 months post ART was detected. By contrast, HIV-specific CD8+ T cell proliferation was detected in all participants and exhibited early kinetics similar to PHA- and HCMV-specific CD8+ T cells ( H).\n\nIn the LT-ART group, and as reported previously, both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells proliferated to HIV peptides, HCMV peptides, and PHA and were stable over time ( I).87,88 Notably, in this group, the levels of HIV- and HCMV-specific proliferation in CD4+ T cells were comparable ( I). The significant differences in proliferation between the A5248 (420 days post ART) and LT-ART groups ( J) suggested a time-dependent restoration of HIV-specific CD4+ T cell proliferation capacity. We note that HLA-DR expression in the post-ART window ranged between 54% and 98% on monocytes and B cells, suggesting that peptide presentation to HIV-specific CD4+ T cells was not rate limiting in A5248.\n\nDiscussion\n\nChronic HIV infection causes extensive dysregulation of immune homeostasis.89,90 In this study we documented the early kinetics of ART-mediated immune restoration, comparing data with LT virus-suppressed PWH. In A5248, first-line ART decreased HIV viremia rapidly across all study participants, producing a greater than 1-log decrease in virus loads within 10 days.46,91 In all but one participant, absolute CD4+ T cell counts increased over 500 days, and CD4:CD8 ratios improved but remained inverted.\n\nAgainst this background of changing absolute T cell numbers, ART produced broad changes in the frequencies and phenotypes of circulating leukocytes. Within 7 days of ART initiation, decreases in cell cycling were detected across NK cells, B cells, and γδ and αβ T cells. Cell cycling continued to decrease across all lineages over the first year of ART, after which minimal variation was observed. ART also induced early, albeit more gradual, decreases in cellular activation, most notably decreases in PD-1 and CD38 expression across B cells, NK cells, and γδ and αβ CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. CD38, which can mediate pro-inflammatory cytokine production,92 showed dynamic changes, with the percentage of CD38+ cells decreasing between 11.3% (CD19+ B cells) and 40.7% (CD8+ T cells) in leukocyte populations over the first 500 days following ART. For CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, the frequency of CD38+ cells was significantly higher 500 days post ART compared with PWH who had been suppressed, on average, for 6.7 years.\n\nStrong and sustained increases in Bcl-2 expression, which induces anti-apoptotic signaling,93,94 were observed across all lymphocyte lineages, specifically B, NK, and αβ and γδ T cells. The frequency of T and NK cells, but not B cells, expressing CD127 increased following ART initiation. In T cells, CD127 expression is necessary for the maintenance of LT T cell memory.95 The frequency of CD127+CD8+ T cells was comparable with the LT-ART group 500 days following ART, whereas CD127+CD4+ T cell frequencies remained significantly lower for total CD4+ T cells as well as multiple memory subpopulations. Additional analysis of the LT-ART cohort showed ongoing increases in the proportion of CD127+ effector memory and terminal effector CD4+ T cells over time on ART. Altogether, this suggested that full reconstitution of LT CD4+ T cell memory takes years.\n\nART-mediated immune restoration occurred more slowly in CD4+ than in CD8+ T cells, consistent with ongoing inverted CD4:CD8 ratio observed in many PWH on ART.31,32 Low CD4 counts and an inverted CD4:CD8 ratio are strongly associated with significantly elevated co-morbidities in PWH.32,34,35 T cell populations compete for IL-7 and other homeostatic cytokines.96,97 The relatively higher numbers of CD8+ T cells at ART initiation may out compete CD4+ T cells, slowing their recovery. Other mechanisms could contribute. CD4+ T cells also restore more slowly than CD8+ T cells following myeloablation and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), suggesting intrinsic differences between CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.98,99,100 HCMV seropositivity has also been associated with maintenance of elevated CD8+ T cell frequencies in ART-treated individuals.31,47,101\n\nWe observed that HIV-specific T cell proliferation was profoundly impaired in untreated HIV infection, as reported previously.102,103 HIV-specific CD8+ but not HIV-specific CD4+ T cell proliferation was detected in the first 500 days following ART and was stable in LT-ART participants.104,105 Detection of HIV-specific CD4+ T cell proliferation in LT-ART participants suggests that HIV-specific CD4+ T cell clonotypes were present but functionally unresponsive in the early post-ART period.106 Again, these proliferation data are consistent with the slower restoration of functional phenotypes, including CD127+ T cell memory observed in CD4+ versus CD8+ T cells post ART.\n\nTCRβ clonotyping of CD3+ T cells in HIV infection has been reported previously, describing modestly increased clonotypic diversity following ART.107 Here we performed a longitudinal analysis of CD4+ T cell TCRβ clonotypes pre and post ART treatment. Our results were surprising. At the pre-ART time point, we observed individual dominant TCRβ clonotypes ranging from 0.1%–11% of all CD4+ T cells sequenced that together contributed between 16.2% and 23.6% of all clonotypes at this time point. These dominant TCRβ clonotypes were stably detected with similar relative frequencies over the following 500 days post ART initiation. This pattern mirrored detection of stable CD4+ T cell clonotypes in LT-ART participants in whom CD4+ T cell phenotypes and function were mostly stable over time. Across all participants studied, pre/post ART and LT-ART, the rank order of dominant TCRβ clonotypes was strongly maintained over time, suggesting that clonal homeostasis of dominant clonotypes is maintained independent of dysregulated CD4+ T cell absolute numbers, T cell memory, helper frequencies, and function. We note, that because of sampling depth, we cannot draw similar conclusions regarding lower-frequency clonotypes (<0.1%).\n\nAn important question is what maintains the rank order of dominant CD4+ T cell TCRβ clonotypes over time. While we were unable to identify the specificity of dominant clonotypes using the VDJ database, several studies have reported dominant clonotypes specific to persistent viral HCMV and EBV antigens.108,109,110 In PWH cohorts, dominant clonotypes could include HIV-specific clonotypes that are maintained during ART following stochastic reactivation and antigen presentation of HIV-infected cells. Persisting HIV-specific CD4+ T cell clonotypes would be consistent with our observations that HIV specific proliferation, while undetectable in the year post ART, was detectable years later. Our current studies are investigating alternative approaches to define the specificity of these dominant clonotypes as well as their transcriptomic profiles at different stages of immune restoration.\n\nStable expanded TCR clonotypes have also been reported in a range of immune conditions, including individuals in good health,111,112,113 individuals with autoimmune systemic lupus erythematosus,113 cancer patients undergoing myeloablation and HSCT,114,115 and even non-human primates following CMV infection.116 While these studies did not perform deep immune profiling, they represent a broad range of immune states consistent with a model where clonal homeostasis is independent of other facets of T cell homeostasis and suggest that our observations in PWH have broad application.\n\nThis study has several implications for therapeutic strategies targeted against HIV. Longitudinal sequencing of the HIV provirus has identified identical or near-identical HIV provirus years apart in ART-treated individuals.38,39,40 Given the very high mutation rates of HIV,117,118 these observations are best explained by LT survival or homeostatic maintenance of the latently infected CD4+ T cells. Other HIV sequencing studies have shown that HIV reservoir virus can reflect virus archived throughout infection but that, on average, most virus is archived in and around the time of ART initiation.41,42,43 Here, high-frequency CD4+ T cell clonotypes were observed at ART initiation, in agreement with a previous study describing expanded HCMV-specific CD4+ clonotypes in HIV-viremic individuals.108 We speculate that, despite the absolute loss and dysregulation of CD4+ T cells in untreated HIV infection, CD4+ T cells, particularly those expressing dominant clonotypes, are maintained over time. HIV infection of even a small proportion of these CD4+ T cells would be consistent with observations that the HIV reservoir virus can date from early infection.\n\nThe overrepresentation in the HIV reservoir of viruses circulating in and around the time of ART initiation is also consistent with restoration of CD4+ T cell longevity observed in our phenotyping studies. We have proposed that this early post-ART period may be a therapeutic window during which to destabilize and decrease the HIV reservoir,42,44 particularly by targeting CD4+ T cell immune reconstitution, blocking the transition of CD4+ T cells from more short-term to long-lived cells. Our data, which show slow CD4+ T cell immune reconstitution occurring over years, suggests that a therapeutic window may be wide. In addition, CD4+ T cell-targeted therapies will likely impact multiple leukocyte lineages that also undergo immune reconstitution in the post-ART window.\n\nA direct translational implication of these data relates to the design of antiretroviral treatment interruption (ATI) studies in PWH. These studies examine whether therapeutics, small-molecule inhibitors and immunotherapies, can delay time to virus rebound in PWH following ATI. We show that, even when CD4 counts have restored to greater than 400 within 1 year, CD4+ T cell phenotype and function exhibit persistent dysregulation. Therefore, interrupting ART in the first year post ART initiation may slow this restoration even further. Second, approaches that improve cytolytic activity of CD8+ T and NK cells and even γδ T cells are being investigated to target and clear HIV-infected cells and to cure hepatitis B in PWH in the post-ART window and during treatment interruption.119,120,121,122,123 Here, we show clear differences in the rates of immune reconstitution in terms of frequencies and phenotypes of cytotoxic cells post ART. Most notably, the frequency of CD56lo NK cells that mediate cytolytic NK cell activity recovered more slowly than CD8+ T cells. These differences in kinetics of immune reconstitution will help inform the timing of immune interventions for HIV cure. Altogether, these studies suggest that harnessing endogenous immunity may be more effective when phenotypic and functional homeostasis has been re-established following several years of ART.\n\nLimitations of the study\n\nIn this study, we show the global changes wrought by HIV infection and that host immunity likely takes years to restore post ART, akin to reforestation following a fire. To inform ATI design, additional post-ART studies, specifically 2–6 years post ART, that include more detailed phenotyping of leukocytes are needed to fully document recovery of host immunity. Last, participant numbers limited our ability to examine changes in slope of immune populations within the post-ART period. However, the highly consistent changes observed between participants underscores the global immune dysregulation caused by uncontrolled HIV viremia and the robust, albeit slow and steady, effect of modern ART regimens to restore immune homeostasis.\n\nSTAR★Methods\n\nKey resources table\n\nREAGENT or RESOURCESOURCEIDENTIFIERAntibodiesCD45 HI30 111CdStandard BioToolsCat# 3111001BCCR6 11A9 141PrStandard BioToolsCat# 3141014ACD19 HB19 142NDStandard BioToolsCat# 3142001B;

Participants received raltegravir and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate plus emtricitabine (#{\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT00660972\",\"term_id\":\"NCT00660972\"}}NCT00660972).91 At each visit, viral loads were assessed by Amplicor HIV-1 Monitor, version 1.5, UltraSensitive protocol (≤50 copies/mL; Roche Molecular Systems, Branchburg, NJ), CD4+ T cell counts collected and self-reported adherence assessments submitted. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and plasma were isolated from blood collected at days 0 (pre-ART), 2, 7, 10, 14, 21, 28, 56 and weeks 12, 16, 20, 24, 36, 48, 60 and 72 (Table S1; A).\n\nLT-ART, durable viral suppression group: Adults (≥18 years) who initiated ART in chronic HIV infection were enrolled through the UNC Chapel Hill HIV-1 Clinical Trials Unit or the Women’s Interagency HIV-1 Study (WIHS) UNC Chapel Hill Site. HIV infection was defined as a positive licensed HIV ELISA test confirmed by either Western blot (WB), multispot HIV assay, HIV-1 RNA, or two documented plasma HIV-1 RNA >1000 copies/mL. For this study we investigated participants who met the following additional criteria: i) a stable ART regimen for ≥12 months defined as one or more nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors plus a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, integrase inhibitors, or a protease inhibitor without interruption ii) missing no more than 2 consecutive days or no more than 4 cumulative days of ART doses in the 24 weeks prior to the first study timepoint ii) plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL for ≥12 months prior to sample collection as defined by a minimum of two tests (limit of detection determined by assay employed). For each study participant that had met these criteria, PBMC had been collected at three time points over a 17-26-month window (Table S1; B). Average time on ART at time point 1 was 6.7 years and at time point 3 was 8.6 years.\n\nStudy approval\n\nA5248\n\nThe institutional review board at each of the participating clinical research sites approved the study protocols, and all subjects provided signed informed consent.91\n\nLT-ART\n\nReview and implementation of all protocols utilized for the collection of samples for this analysis were approved by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Biomedical Institutional Review Board (IRB) (ethics numbers: 14–0741, 11–0228, and 13–3613, 15–1626). All participants provided written informed consent.\n\nMethod details\n\nCulture media\n\nR10+\n\nRPMI (Corning, MT10040CV) + 10% FBS (VWR, 97068-088, Lot# 079K16) + 10mM HEPES (Corning, 20-060-CL) + 2mM L-glutamine (Corning 25005CL) + 1mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco 11360-070) + penicillin-streptomycin (Sigma, P0781).\n\nRAB10\n\nRPMI (Corning, MT10040CV) + 10% Human AB Serum (Gemini Bio, 100–512, Lot# H121059) + 10mM HEPES (Corning, 20-060-CL) + 2mM L-glutamine (Corning 25005CL) + 1mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco 11360-070) + penicillin-streptomycin (Sigma, P0781).\n\nMass cytometry staining\n\nOptimization and standardization of the mass cytometry panel was detailed previously.126 PBMC were thawed and rested overnight in R10+ at 37°C with average viability of 89% (71–97%). 107 cells/mL PBMC suspension was prepared in Ca2+ Mg2+ free PBS (Rockland, Cat# MB008) and cell-ID Cisplatin 195 (Fluidigm Cat# 201195) was added. Staining was quenched with Maxpar Cell Staining Buffer (CSB) (Fluidigm Cat# 201068) and PBMC then incubated with Fc blocking antibody for 10 min (Biolegend Cat# 422301). Surface antibodies (see key resources table) were added to PBMC, incubated at 4°C for 30 min and then washed. PBMC were fixed and permeabilized using a FoxP3 Fixation/Permeabilization kit as per manufacturer’s protocol (Thermofisher Cat# 00-5523-00). Intracellular antibodies (see key resources table) were added and PBMC incubated at 4°C for a further 30 min. PBMC were washed then incubated in 1 mL 2% paraformaldehyde in CyPBS (Fluidigm Cat# 201058) for 10 min at room temperature. Cell intercalation solution (Fluidigm Cat# 201192A) was added and each sample gently mixed. Cells were kept overnight at 4°C and the following day washed with CSB and then cell acquisition solution (Fluidigm Cat# 201240). Samples were acquired on the Helios (Fluidigm). 700,000 events were acquired for each sample (on average 380,000 Live+ DNA+ cells) that enabled acquisition of at least 10,000 CD4+ T cells/sample including participants with absolute CD4 counts of less than 100 cells/mm3. 10,000 CD4+ T cells enabled detection of CD4+ T cell subpopulations at a frequency of 1% with a coefficient of variation of 10%.127\n\nManual gating of data\n\nCytobank (9.3) was used to manually gate cell populations. Plots were ArcSinh transformed with a co-factor of 5 and then gates were set using either unstained or antibody backbone-stained controls.126 The unstained tube was used to confirm there was no environmental metal contamination and to appropriately identify CD45+ cells. The antibody backbone tube which consisted of all major lineage markers (CD45, CD3, CD4, CD8, TCRγδ, CD19, CD14, CD56 and CD16) was used to set gates downstream of these lineages markers. We report %frequencies and MSI, the latter being the equivalent of mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) in flow cytometry.\n\nFlow cytometry proliferation assays\n\nPBMC were rested overnight then incubated with 5μM of Cell Trace Violet (CTV) (Invitrogen Cat# {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"C34571\",\"term_id\":\"2370712\",\"term_text\":\"C34571\"}}C34571) for 20 min at 37°C and washed with 40mL of 2% FBS/PBS. PBMC (2 x106/mL) were then stimulated with pools of peptides spanning either human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) proteins pp65/IE1 (15-mer overlapping by 11 amino acids, 1 μg/mL), HIV Gag/Nef HIV (18-mer overlapping by 10 amino acids, 1 μg/mL) or phytohemagglutinin (PHA, 3 μg/mL) in RAB10 and cultured for 5 days at 37°C. Cells were washed then stained with viability dye (Zombie NIR Biolegend Cat #423106) and CD3 AF488 (Biolegend Cat # 300415), CD4 BV650 (Biolegend Cat # 317436), CD8 BV510 (Biolegend Cat # 344732), CD14 PerCP Cy5.5 (Biolegend Cat # 325622), CD19 PerCP Cy5.5 (Biolegend Cat # 302230), CD56 PerCP Cy5.5 (Biolegend Cat # 318322), and CD16 PerCP Cy5.5 (Biolegend Cat # 302028). Cultures acquired at day 5 had at over 90% viability of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and at least 10,000 CD4+ T cells were acquired on BD LSRFortessa. Data were analyzed with FlowJo (version 10.8.1). The fold-change in CTVlo cells of PHA/antigen-stimulated cells over mock stimulated cultures was calculated, then log2 transformed. A positive proliferative T cell response was defined as 3-fold over mock (1.58 when log2 transformed).\n\nCD4+ T cell isolation\n\nCD4+ T cell isolation was performed per manufacturer’s instructions (Miltenyi Biotec Cat #130-096-533). In brief, PBMC were washed in PBS +0.5% Bovine Serum Albumin + 2mM EDTA and incubated with CD4+ T cell Biotin Antibody Cocktail at 4°C. Then, CD4+ T cell MicroBead Cocktail was added and incubated at 4°C. Cells were then put through a magnetic column (Miltenyi Biotec Cat #130-042-401). Average CD4+ T cell purity was 96% (91–99%) and viability was 90% (83.5–96.1%).\n\nTCR sequencing\n\nAfter isolation, CD4+ T cells were stimulated with CD3/28 beads at 1:1 to increase transcription (Thermofisher Cat# 113.31D) for 4 h at 37°C. Note: The 4-h stimulation is not long enough for CD4+ T cells to divide.128 Stimulated CD4+ T cells were then washed with PBS, lysed and total RNA extracted using the RNeasy Plus Micro kit (Qiagen 74034). RNA was quantified using a Qubit fluorometer (Qubit RNA Assay kit, Invitrogen {\"type\":\"entrez-protein\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"Q32855\",\"term_id\":\"75280862\",\"term_text\":\"Q32855\"}}Q32855), and quality was assessed with the Agilent TapeStation using High Sensitivity RNA ScreenTape (Agilent 5067–5579) to measure the integrity of the extracted RNA. All samples had a RIN score >8. Extracted RNA was stored at −80°C.\n\nLibraries were prepared for TCR sequencing using the SMARTer Human TCR a/b Profiling Kit v2 (Takara Bio USA, Inc., Cat# 634479). Typically, 30ng total RNA was used as input for cDNA synthesis using Takara’s oligo dT primers (TCR SMART UMI Oligo). β-chain repertoire of the TCR variable region was targeted for library construction. Library quantity, purity and size selection were assessed using Qubit fluorometer (Qubit DNA Assay kit, Invitrogen {\"type\":\"entrez-protein\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"Q32854\",\"term_id\":\"75280861\",\"term_text\":\"Q32854\"}}Q32854) and an Agilent Bioanalyzer (D5000 ScreenTape, Agilent 5067–5592) with acceptable library size distribution between 600 and 1150bp. Sample TCR libraries were pooled with 10% PhiX control v3 (Illumina, Cat# FC-110-3001). Sequencing was performed on an Illumina NextSeq2000 sequencer with 2 × 150 base paired end read chemistry through the UNC High-Throughput Sequencing Facility.\n\nTCR repertoire analysis\n\nTCR inference from TCR amplicon sequencing FASTQ files was performed with Mixcr (v2.1.9–6),124,125 where paired-end reads were subject to alignment in default mode, followed by contig assembly and export. Sample diversity metrics were calculated using the Python package scikit-bio (v0.5.6). The process of FastQC (v0.11.7) quality checks, MiXCR inference, and diversity metric calculation was facilitated by the in-house tool FASTMixcr (v0.5) running on Python (v3.6). Following FASTMixcr, further analysis was run using the outputs of Mixcr. Morisita-Horn Overlap Index was used to measure the similarities between samples.\n\nTCR clonotype frequencies were transformed by adding 0.00001 to each clonotype frequency (%) and then plotted on log10 scale.\n\nQuantification and statistical analysis\n\nQuantitative analyses\n\nStatistical analyses were performed using R (v 4.2.2) to fit the fixed-effects regressions (see fixed-effects regression), Python (v3.6) to fit the elastic net regressions (see elastic net regression), and GraphPad Prism Version 9 for all other analyses. Non-parametric approaches were utilized for unpaired and paired comparisons between cohorts (Mann-Whitney U test, Wilcoxon signed rank test) and for correlation analyses (Spearman’s rank). All tests were two-sided, and no adjustments were made for multiple testing.\n\nUnsupervised analysis data preprocessing\n\nAll mass cytometry samples were first preprocessed by gating on live, singlet cells, then ArcSinh transformed with a co-factor of 5 prior to analysis. To identify a limited subset of representative cells for more efficient computation, an equal number of cells (n=2500) were selected from each profiled sample using kernel herding sketching and then vertically concatenated into a single matrix for clustering.129 Kernel herding sketching performs principled downsampling to select cells across all major populations by approximating the kernel mean embedding of the original dataset. The approach selects prototypical cells that are representative of the original distribution of cell type frequencies, while ensuring rare cell types are sufficiently sampled.\n\nPhenoGraph\n\nTo partition cells into biologically cohesive cell populations in an automated manner, computation-efficient metaclustering was implemented using the PhenoGraph algorithm53 with Leiden clustering130 (PhenoGraph v1.5.7 (k = 30 neighbors in the k-nearest neighbor graph, resolution parameter = 1.5)) in a two-step process. First, cell populations were identified in each profiled sample based on the expression of 25 cell surface proteins (see Table S7, highlighted in blue). To identify cell populations shared across patients over time within a cohort, sample-specific cell populations were subsequently grouped into metaclusters using the PhenoGraph algorithm on the cluster centroids from each sample based on the median expression across all features.\n\nEngineering mass cytometry immune features from unsupervised clusters\n\nFollowing metaclustering, four categories of descriptive features were computed for each profiled patient sample. First, cell type frequency features were defined for each metacluster as the proportion of the profiled sample’s cells assigned to a metacluster under the PhenoGraph metaclustering approach (analogous to frequency features defined through manual gating). Next, to quantify changes in cell type abundance over time, the difference in the total number of cells within a metacluster was computed between the initial (t=0) and subsequent (t>0) samples collected from a patient. Per cluster functional features were defined as the median expression of the following protein markers: PD-1, Bcl-2, Ki-67, CCR5, CD38, HLA-DR, CD57, and CD127. Lastly, to quantify changes in signaling responses, the difference in the median expression of a functional protein was computed between the initial (t=0) and successive timepoints (t>0). The four categories of metacluster-derived immune features were then horizontally concatenated into a N×4C feature matrix, where N is the number of profiled samples and C is the number of metaclusters.\n\nElastic net regression\n\nTo ascertain immune cell phenotype and functional changes associated with initiation of antiretroviral therapy or durable suppression, a predictive elastic net regression model was trained on the metacluster-derived features from each patient cohort. The elastic net is a regularized linear regression model that uses L1 and L2 penalties to constrain the coefficients to ensure that the model is sparse, while also allowing for correlated features.54 Given a matrix of metacluster-derived immune features for patients within a cohort, X, and a response vector corresponding to the time since receiving antiretroviral therapy, y, elastic net regression was used to estimate the vector of coefficients, β, that minimize the sum of squared error between the time following therapy and the predictions.\n\nL(β)=‖y−Xβ‖2+λ1‖β‖1+λ2‖β‖22\n\n(Equation 1)\n\nTo test the generalizability of the elastic net regression model and account for dependencies between samples acquired from the same patient over time, a leave-one-out cross validation procedure was used. For each cross-validation fold, all samples collected from one patient were excluded to train the model. Elastic net regularization parameters, λ1 and λ2, were then tuned over a grid search with leave-one-out cross validation prior to estimating the coefficients for immune features and predicting the time following antiretroviral therapy for the excluded patient. Model fit was subsequently assessed by computing the coefficient of determination, R2.\n\nFixed-Effects regression\n\nQuasi-binomial to quantify changes in percent frequency\n\nTo examine longitudinal changes in the proportion of different cell populations (e.g., CD4 cells) expressing certain biomarkers (e.g., CCR5+) or a combination of biomarkers (e.g., CCR7+CD45RA+), quasi-binomial fixed-effects regression models131 were fit separately for data from each cell population and each cohort (LT-ART and A5248). Specifically, for the ith timepoint in the jth patient (j=1,…,m), the counts Yij of cells in the population expressing the biomarker(s) were modeled as\n\nlog⁡{pij/(1−pij)}=β1Monthsij+α1I(PIDj=1)+α2I(PIDj=2)+…+αmI(PIDj=m),\n\n(Equation 2)\n\nwhere E(Yij|Monthsij,PIDj)=nijpij and Var(Yij|Monthsij,PIDj)=φnijpij(1−pij) are the mean and variance of the counts conditional on time (in months) and participant ID. In these formulas, pij denotes the proportion of the cell population having the biomarker, nij denotes the total number of cells, and φ denotes the dispersion parameter. The parameter φ reflects additional variance that may be present in the data that could not otherwise be described by a simple binomial regression. In Equation 2, β1 represents the change in the log odds of the cell expressing certain biomarker(s) for every month increment (30 days), the α parameters represent the patient-specific intercepts for m total patients, and the indicators are such that I(PID=m)=1 if participant ID is m and 0 otherwise. Notice that there are as many indicators as there are patients (m total), so an overall intercept is not included to avoid overparameterization. Based on the fitted model, the average marginal effect of the Months variable was estimated (using the margins package in R132 and reported as a percentage point (%pt) change (i.e., the difference between two percentages). The average marginal effect quantifies the average change in the outcome per unit change in the predictor variable (in this case, Months). For example, if the estimated %pt change was 0.5, this would imply that the proportion of cells in population expressing the biomarker(s) increases by 0.5% per month on average according to the fitted model.\n\nGamma to quantify changes in mean signal intensity\n\nLongitudinal changes in proteins expressed on the cell surface and intracellularly as measured by mean signal intensity (MSI) were also examined. Since values of MSI are positive and continuous, a gamma fixed-effects regression with log link and indicators for PID was fit separately to the data from each expressed protein and each cohort (LT-ART and A5248), and deviance residuals were inspected for normality. Specifically, for the ith timepoint in the jth patient (j=1,…,m), MSIij was modeled per expressed protein as\n\nlog{μij}=β1Monthsij+α1I(PIDj=1)+α2I(PIDj=2)+…+αmI(PIDj=m),\n\n(Equation 3)\n\nwhere MSIij∼Gamma(kij,θij), E(MSIij|Monthsij,PIDj)=μij=kijθij and Var(MSIij|Monthsij,PIDj)=φμij2=kijθij2 are the mean and variance of the MSI conditional on time (in months) and participant ID. In these formulas, kij and θij denote the gamma shape and scale parameters, respectively, and the variance is a function of the mean, so any shifts in the mean will impact the variance. The remaining covariables are as described after Equation 2. The estimate that we derive from the model in Equation 3 is expressed as a percent change. For example, if the expression of the protein XYZ as measured by MSI is 200 one month and 210 the next month, then there is a 5% increase in expression of protein XYZ. This value is calculated as (210-200)/200 × 100%, and the model in Equation 3 is used to estimate this average percent change (e.g., 5%) for each protein.\n\nThese analyses were chosen over mixed-effects models for two reasons: 1) fixed-effects models have been shown to be less susceptible to bias for a small number of clusters (in this case, patients),133 and 2) variation between individuals from the random effects can introduce confounding bias in the coefficient estimates if key time-invariant covariates are omitted from the model.134 Fixed-effects methods, which rely only on variation within individuals, control for all unmeasured characteristics as long as those characteristics do not change over time.135\n\nNotes\n\nPublished: November 9, 2023\n\nFootnotes\n\nSupplemental information can be found online at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xcrm.2023.101268.\n\nSupplemental information\n\nDocument S1.
