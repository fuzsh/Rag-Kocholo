Primary Contact Staff (PCS) are deployed through Regional Resource Centers as well as local option offices to help with identification of local issues and development of chapter programs aligned with CTA’s Long-Term Strategic Plan. PCS and regional department staff assist with membership engagement/promotion, chapter bargaining, contract monitoring, grievance representation procedures including arbitrations, and identification and processing of unfair practice charges.\n\nRegional programs include trainings to promote leadership development; networking and coordination between chapters; enhancement of internal and external communications systems; and development of community engagement plans to connect parents, teachers, business and community leaders around issues affecting children and public education. Regional support also includes assistance with accessing Legal Services Programs for chapters and members; chapter recognition status; consultation to the Service Center Councils; and coordination of CTA/NEA Retired Programs."
