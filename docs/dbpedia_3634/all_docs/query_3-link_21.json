        "text": "In todayâs world, the path to high school graduation no longer has to be a straight line from the neighborhood elementary school to your local school districtâs brick-and-mortar high school. As students grow and change, so do their learning needs, causing students to explore other options, including private, charter, and virtual schools, to continue their learning journey.\n\nAs students and families explore their school choices, they are often left wonderingÂ how to earn a high school diploma online for free.Â Â\n\nOne way is at a publicÂ virtualÂ highÂ schoolÂ likeÂ Connections Academy. Just like in a public brick-and-mortar school, where students donât pay tuition and receive theirÂ high school diplomas for free, students at publicÂ virtualÂ high schoolsÂ donât pay tuition and earn theirÂ high school diploma online for free.Â Â\n\nÂ\n\nThe Benefits ofÂ Online High SchoolÂ\n\nChoosing the right school is one of the hardest decisions that parents have to make. There are many reasons why parents may want to explore different school options for their student, and many find that virtual school fits their specific needs. Virtual school offers:\n\nFlexible daily schedules, allowing studentsÂ toÂ complete their dailyÂ lessons on their schedule, leaving time for family obligations or extracurricular activities and sports.Â Â\n\nA safe,Â inclusive learning environmentÂ where everyone is welcome.Â\n\nAccredited curriculumÂ â¯Â\n\nTeachersâ¯who are specially trained to teachâ¯online.â¯Â\n\nSocialâ¯experiencesâ¯likeâ¯live classes and onlineâ¯clubs.â¯â¯Â\n\nReadÂ some of theÂ stories from online school studentsÂ about their journeys to earn a high school diploma online and see how online school benefits each studentâs individual needs.\n\nÂ\n\nGraduationÂ Requirements to Earn aÂ Free Online High School DiplomaÂ Â\n\nHigh school graduation requirementsâ¯forÂ accreditedÂ online high schoolsâ¯are set by the state where the schoolâ¯isâ¯based and mirror the stateâs brick-and-mortar schoolsâ graduation requirements. Students enrolled in both types of public schoolsâ¯typically do the same number of credit hours, attend school the same number of hours/days, and must pass the same or similar state competency tests to graduate and receive their online high school diploma.\n\nVirtual high schools have guidance counselors who help guide students in their course selection to ensure they meet the state guidelines to receive their high school diploma. Many virtual schools also offer solutions to support students who may be missing credits. â¯\n\nMany virtual schools also offer in-person graduation ceremonies where students are presented with their high school diploma. Students can celebrate their achievement with friends and family!\n\nÂ\n\nCosts for PublicÂ VirtualÂ SchoolsÂ\n\nPublic virtual schools are tuition-free, but there are some things families are responsible for. Depending on the grade, technology can play a significant part in the online school experience.â¯Manyâ¯virtual schoolsâ¯provide computers to their students at no cost. Virtual schoolâ¯familiesâ¯often find having a working computerâ¯helpful toâ¯haveâ¯near the studentâsâ¯learning spaceâespecially if their student is enrolled in middleÂ schoolÂ or high school online.â¯â¯Â\n\nRequired texts and instructional materials, which can be either digital or physical depending on your studentâs grade level and state, are also provided at no cost. Virtual schoolâ¯students need most of the same supplies as brick-and-mortarâ¯publicâ¯school students, which must be purchased by the family. This includes school supplies like pencils, erasers, and notebooks.â¯\n\nPublic virtual schools donât charge fees to earn a high school diploma online. To graduate, students must simply meet their stateâs graduation requirements.\n\nÂ\n\nApplication Process forÂ Online School\n\nItâs never too late toÂ transfer toÂ online schoolÂ and get your student on the path to earn theirÂ free high school diploma online. You can join one ofÂ Connections AcademyâsÂ information sessionsÂ to learn more about publicÂ virtualÂ schoolsÂ and the application process.Â Â\n\nLearn moreÂ aboutÂ howÂ virtualÂ schoolÂ can help your studentÂ earn aÂ high school diplomaÂ onlineÂ for free.Â\n\nread more"
