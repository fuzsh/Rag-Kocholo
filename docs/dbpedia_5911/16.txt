The 1.1 update also gives users additional software support for Trilian’s multichannel soundsources, release layers, round robin samples, and special legato articulation triggering. Omnisphere 1.1 also adds new Memory Management, Sample Thinning and the “Lite Version” feature also found in Trilian for faster loading and auditioning of sounds.

Omnisphere version 1.1 also includes various interface improvements found in Trilian as well as RTAS support for any number of processors on Pro Tools systems.
