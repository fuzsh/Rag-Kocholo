Don't know how many of you have the spectrasonics intruments Stylus, Atmosphere, and Trilogy, but they have a new module STYLUS rmx with S.A.G.E technology. http://www.spectrasonics.net/news/StylusRMXpreview.html

I purchased all three original intruments a while back under the impression they were going to be expandable, more libraries added. This does not seem to be the case as there is no mention of an upgrade from the original ones.

I hope this is not the case though :confused:

All in all, I'm very happy with all three, especially Trilogy, the total bass module.

Anyone using these?

:p:
