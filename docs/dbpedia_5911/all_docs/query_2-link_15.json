        "text": "Simon - I'd start with [email protected] . Sounds to me like they were taking orders and sorting out links over the weekend, but for anything more complex they were saying to wait til Monday, so hopefully you'll get a reply today when they start in the morning California time.\n\nFor all the other general issues, As fitzo said, install instructions are in the PDF. Once I had the right installer (which was a huge source of confusion on Thursday, happily now resolved), the install was a piece of cake for me, I'm really surprised to see all the posts about authorisation issues, admin rights and can't find STEAM etc etc.\n\nMy own STEAM folder has always been on a separate SSD drive, and in general I run the computer as an administrator in W7. I just ran the installers in numerical order as said in the instructions (no running it in any unusual mode), pointed it at my STEAM folder when requested and the dll in their correct folder and that was it. Everything works, including Moog and Trilian.\n\nInitially I was confused about what I was downloading via their downloader, perhaps they could be a bit clearer in saying you are downloading an installer and it doesn't matter where you put it. But I guess the mere fact that it doesn't matter means that it, well, doesn't matter.\n\nRe: Omnisphere 2 Upgrades: FRANCE FAST-TRACK ADDED!\n\nSpectrasonics products in France (Omnisphere 2 upgrade packages) 1/5/2015\n\nwww.casawave.fr\n\nwww.audiosolutions.fr\n\nACS Production\n\nAlain Champagne\n\n1er étage 3, rue de Téhéran 75008 - Paris France\n\n+33 1 40 760624\n\n[email protected]\n\nwww.homestudio.fr / www.stars-music.fr (will follow soon)\n\nwww.musikia.fr (will follow soon)\n\nbest regards\n\nThanx imusic. it looks like it's also possible to upgrade from Spectra site - I went as far as Paypal's \"pay now\" page - or whatever is called the thrilling page where you actually press the trigger a split sec before your bank account goes bunker, banging your bucket's bucks big time.\n\nErik\n\nIf you are having trouble with the upgrade Omni Serial Number.\n\nUsed the link and got stuck last night with my upgrade serial number. The continue button wouldn't work. About twenty minutes of frustration. Played with the sn entry some and noticed that the continue button become active if I added one more digit to the number which I was pulling from my account. Took a wild guess and added a 0 to the front and voila!. So if you are having trouble, you might need to add that 0.\n\nSo tonight is phase two. The installation since the download took awhile last night. Can't wait to dig in.\n\nSo here's a question if anybody knows - I own Omnisphere v1 but I'm setting up a new computer and haven't bothered to install it on the new machine. If I purchase an upgrade will I be able to do a \"clean install\" on this new machine or do I need to install the older version first?\n\nJust in case you haven't gotten your answer.\n\nI assume you bought and downloaded the upgrade.\n\nIn that case you have to have omnisphere 1 installed and authorized first...\n\nsee also last line in this post:\n\nhttps://www.vi-control.net/forum/viewtop ... 32#3868432\n\nrsp\n\nFor 2 days I have been trying... at my office with monster connection (I got bandwidth to spare).\n\nIt downloads for a couple of hours, sometimes it gets as high as 92% (one meager Gb left!) and then... \"download stalled, attempting to resume\" which it never does. About 5 min. later the \"remaining\" number starts to get bigger until it goes back to the beginning... rinse, repeat.\n\nI could understand it failing to complete, but the fact that it \"forgets\" everything that was downloaded is just silly and infuriating - could't you just use Continuata or give us a direct download link?"
