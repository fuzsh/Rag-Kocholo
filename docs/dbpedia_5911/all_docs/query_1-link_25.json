        "text": "I have recently set up a new studio using Logic Pro X . Ive installed lots of software including native instruments and Spectrosonics Omnisphere, Trillion and Stylus.\n\nWhen i trigger instruments through my midi keyboard, everything works but not any of the Spectrosonics software.\n\nFor example, if i click on screen the play button on Omnisphere, it will play the sounds but if i try to trigger it through the keyboard, it doesn't play, on Omnisphere, trillion or stylus.\n\nI am thinking that maybe it has something to do with the fact that all the Spectrosonics software is on an external hard drive but I cant be sure that is the reason for it not working correctly??? Im sure its just a settings problem but I cant get it to work.\n\nCan anyone help.\n\nThanks\n\nColin\n\nFirst step...\n\nCheck that your Midi keyboard is sending on Midi Channel 1\n\nNext step..\n\nTo eliminate the possibilities from being a Midi Channel/keyboard/settings issue.. try using the Musical Typing Keyboard in LPX and see what happens.. (LPX menu bar:View:Show Musical Typing)\n\nIf that plays notes in Omni.. then you know the Omni itself is working fine... and you have something else going on...\n\nif it doesn't then you have some issue with Omni and it's installation."
