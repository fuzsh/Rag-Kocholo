        "text": "Acclaimed sound design artist, composer and performer Diego Stocco creates eclectic musical experiences with his amazing custom built instruments and experimental recording techniques. As a key artist for Spectrasonics for over 20 years, he's one of the principal creative sound designers of Omnisphere. Diego has become legendary for creating musically playable sounds out of ordinary objects like light bulbs, sampling a piano set on fire, building his own Custom Built Orchestra and many other imaginative contraptions. His exploration for new sounds doesn't stop there - Diego has become well-known for extracting evocative sounds from elements of nature in his original music videos “Music From Sand” and “Music from a Tree” - and performances with his innovative custom built instruments like the “Experibass” and “Bassoforte”. One thing is for sure - Diego's limitless passion for creativity is always an inspiration!\n\nTwisted Space\n\nThe extraordinary “Twisted Space” effect unit is a hybrid ambience processor with a completely unique sonic signature. Based on over 100 natural element recordings Diego Stocco made from animals, trees, streams, caves and forests - as well as rich dsp algorithms - this effect truly puts you out there “into the wild”. Try blending in a sub octave of the natural elements…there's simply no other verb like this on the planet!\n\nUpright\n\nMarimbula\n\nBell Flowers\n\nGamelan\n\nLiquid Nylon\n\nAir Kalimba\n\nDinosaurs\n\nWoodpecker\n\nTamboura\n\nStrummer\n\nRolling Delay\n\n115 Natural Elements:\n\nIce Excavation, Bark Friction, Blizzard & more…\n\nHybrid Ambience processor - convolution+\n\nAmbience Types include:\n\nReverb, Inverse, Echo, Multitap, BPM Delay\n\nVariable Ambience/Echo Modulation\n\nClassic Analog regeneration buildup\n\nSub Octave Blending of Natural Elements\n\nContinuous Stereo Spread of Ambience\n\nColor, Low Cut, High Cut tone controls\n\nMultitap mode for scattered diffusion FX\n\nInverse mode for backwards reverb FX\n\nWorks in any Omnisphere Patch!\n\n115 Natural Elements:\n\nLiquid Woods, Ice Excavation, Bark Friction, Blizzard and more…\n\nHybrid Ambience FX unit based on convolution & algorithms\n\nAmbience Types include:\n\nReverb, Inverse Reverb, Echo, Multitap Delay, BPM Delay\n\nAdd movement with variable Ambience/Echo Modulation\n\nClassic Analog regeneration buildup with killer extremes\n\nMassive Sub Octave Blending of Natural Elements\n\nContinuous Stereo Spread of Ambience Time\n\nColor, Low Cut and High Cut tone controls\n\nMultitap mode for scattered diffusion FX\n\nInverse mode for backwards reverb FX\n\nWorks in any Omnisphere Patch!\n\n115 Natural Elements: Liquid Woods, Ice Excavation, Bark Friction, Blizzard and more…\n\nHybrid Ambience FX unit based on convolution and algorithmic processing\n\nAmbience Types include: Reverb, Inverse, Echo, Multitap, BPM Delay\n\nAdd movement with variable Ambience/Echo Modulation\n\nClassic Analog regeneration buildup with killer extremes\n\nMassive Sub Octave Blending of Natural Elements\n\nContinuous Stereo Spread of Ambience Time\n\nColor, Low Cut and High Cut tone controls\n\nMultitap mode for scattered diffusion FX\n\nInverse mode for backwards reverb FX\n\nWorks in any Omnisphere Patch!\n\nTwisted Root\n\n“Twisted Root” is a special multi-band subsonic enhancer effect that adds massive girth, size and sheen to any sound you run through it. Each of the four bands has controls for the sustain and the level of each frequency independently.
