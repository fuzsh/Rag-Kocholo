I tried msging Ed Anderson but his mailbox is full!\n\nAny tips on these? I know they still offer a \"refurbishing\" program but wouldn't mind tackling this myself if I knew what components/caps needed replacing... I would guess the electrolytics just based on the age.\n\nThanks\n\n-Kristian\n\nkdawg said:\n\nAny tips on these?

It has some schematics and calibration etc in it.\n\nDo we have the schematics or are they vaporized?\n\nI just added it to the tech docs section:\n\nhttps://groupdiy.com/threads/spectrasonics.45521/#post-1042442\n\nYes there are - towards the end - explaining how to put together a handful of spectra modules, with glueing logic explained..?\n\nThe modules, on the other hand, are separate schematics\n\n/Jakob E.\n\nJakob that's the thing. I'm looking for modules 601 and 101. Long ago one of our members reversed engineerd it. That's the one I'm searchîng.\n\nJakob that's the thing. I'm looking for modules 601 and 101.

It is full of Spectra schematics including the 101, 601, 110, etc.\n\nStupid me I didn't look at the rest of the thread. That's the disadvantage of a tablet as apposed to a full screen. Thanks a million! Also you Rob. Your foto has more of the edges. Stange that it was never completely discussed here. Any idea what \"to G03\" means? Must be the gain cell/fet."
