        "text": "I installed Omnisphere 2.0 about 3 years ago and have never updated it. I installed all of the recent updates, but when I open Omnisphere it says 'This patch library requires a new version of Omnisphere' even though I've installed the software update. The program says I still have version 2.0\n\nI appreciate any help!\n\nAttached Files:\n\nUntitled.png\n\nFile size:\n\n373.7 KB\n\nViews:\n\n40\n\nmine goes like \"the patch library requires a newer version of omnisphere \"\n\nI downloaded the software update of 2.6.1 and I used to have the same version of yours 2.0.3d ( i didn't update too :D )\n\nI'm stuck too bro.\n\nand also sometimes that I want to load a preset it says this was created with a newer version and may not load properly\n\nwe are morbid bros I guess\n\nWith Software update 2.6.1e you need Library Patch 2.6.0c or higher. Spectrasonics products need to be completely updated to avoid problems like the ones you are facing.\n\nmine is exactly like this but i dont understand why it doesnt recognize the software update that i install\n\nshould i install it in C:\\Program Files\\Steinberg\\vstplugins or i should choose D:\\STEAM cause i installed other stuff there\n\n@The Pirate\n\ni just did the software update again and installed that everywhere xD (Omnisphere_Software_Update_Win_2_6_1e)\n\nand my 2018 key generator doesnt work now , dunno what to do tbh ! HELP !!!\n\nchallange code is: Sm@cRkn5xVJK Y55GcJPBUkqT ??A6\n\nand i enter : C5aGEUf%+JBawzdFnjkpLnq:XtoK%GCPZGGMNBB8SRv6NeLCM3KUY:cbfTnBRgoJcwBjfb@:TF9o5JVm+/zw6We:RsbWEsCZkdi67T:+rf?t9gtvC:+p2yAf8q:od5+xdx:gvc7Ue+c3haJ8@YdgXSDbJHi?yk==JodTfkeHhx/PzXuT=uqCKyUueYrB2LyjZ5AHY3/CEehxv+9dr9JXXRCBxVABAYxyn2Lyt%NPR?bXXDL6qN?3xAUtqok/PGqh/:NA5LJePDf@bZmLThKegAy:7wfyzHz6icSEYHhe6jBqPSF5i=TCeu7M5Cs+XDsP=n5+aPEPvbKUHSoZ9d4WCw\n\nI have also tried patching it with the keygenerator shit but it doesnt work help me plz\n\nthe important files for Omnisphere (and Trilian Keyscape and Stylus) are in c:\\programdata\\spectrasonics for Windows!\n\nThere should be this file: \" STEAM.lnk \"which shows Omnisphere where the librarys are installed.\n\nIn your case it searches for D:\\\n\nOpen with rightclick and change the path in case the actual library is on C:\\\n\nhere is a screen shot how this looks like http://prntscr.com/nu4res mine is on J:\\ in this screenshot\n\nThere are Omnisphere.dll files in Vstplugins AND in C:\\ProgramData\\Spectrasonics\\plug-ins\\64bit ( i use 64 bit only).\n\nAnd an exe file + AUDIO16.DAT in root to start the standalone version of Omnisphere.\n\nI never \"install\" Omni. Just paste and copy the whole C:\\ProgramData\\Spectrasonics directory and add the DLL to Vstplugins by hand. Done!\n\nI am also a legit owner. So i reacitvate it afterwards via Spectrasonics.\n\nthank yoouuu soo much ! <3 i just dont know what to do with the keygen sh*t atm!\n\nthe same procedere as i do as legit owner. i mean the generated code and the response! copy and paste !\n\nBUT i think there is a patch to modify BOTH omnisphere.dll files which must be used on both before. I onced used the crack because Spectrasonics doesnt like to send new keys 5 times a month. I experiment a lot with 4 different PCs i own and WIn 7 and WIN10. And believe me i have so many backup Disks,,, i cant even count. The FIRST Omnisphere install out of the box took me 6 hours with DVDs! and one DVD had Read errors... so no Spectrasonics, i wont do this again and again.\n\nauthorization is fuckin me up really. i cant find a way to pass this... it made me feel like a baked potato\n\nOf course he needs to patch BOTH DLLs. He needs to close Omnisphere. Run the KG as Adm, make he has full permission to the folders where the dll are located and patch BOTH. If patching doesnt work he can move the dll to desktop and after patching put it back where they belong.\n\nLike x 1\n\nList\n\nBro in order not to break the rules of the Forum I told you to check your email.\n\nYou can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink\n\nstill brings up that authorization page ((((( guess my keygen is too old (for version 2.)\n\ncould you please hook me up with a new one"
