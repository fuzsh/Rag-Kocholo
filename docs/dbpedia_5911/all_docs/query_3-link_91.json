I know thousands, but how many are just noisy ones you might never realistically use?\n\nI had the same reservations. I mean, the Omnisphere people don't even had a freaking audio demo on their website! I wrote them an email about that actually, and they have no plans to make any (retards). Anyway, I searched youtube and found some people had posted demos and there were some sounds I liked, so I got it.\n\nI am very happy with the sounds. Yes, there are a bunch of tinkly/bubbly (useless) and overly dramatic sounds (only for horror movies and CSI shows), but there are a whole bunch of great ones I can actually use.\n\nThere's a bunch of great analog-sounding stuff for techno/pop, even some of the arpeggiator stuff is useful. I was going to get a Virus to replace my old TDM version but now I don't need it with this.\n\nAlso a lot of warm pads with lots of movement. As well as some very choice synth-string sounds. They really run the gamut from cheesy to super warm strings, all of which are useful. They really collected the best of the gamut of synth string history and added their own twist.\n\nAnd some really great bass sounds.\n\nAnd some delicious vocal-based sounds, too.\n\nIt's definitely worth the price musically, if you do pop/dance/electronic. Or even rock since there's some grungy stuff on there, too.\n\nAnd if you do any film/TV scoring, then it's pretty much a mandatory purchase. Even for the stuff I do (no CSI/horror/action crap thankyouverymuch). If you do do the CSI/horror/action crap, then it'll cut your workday in half. Plus the checks for those shows clear for sure!\n\nThe interface is pretty good, and easy to tweak the sounds. I found one bass sound that was perfect except for a little too much DX7 style bite in the attack, and I was able to change the envelope quickly -- and without looking at the manual (yay!).\n\nThe sounds load pretty quickly, and the categories and descriptions are helpful. They wasted their energy on useless items like telling us who programmed the sound and creating a visualizer screen that makes patterns like your iTunes does. Waste of resources. But this company is into serious self-affirmation. If you look at their website, they have like 7 videos about the Omnisphere BUT NO AUDIO DEMOS. Just videos of some egotistical tard who runs the company gushing about the product plus some other random dweebs telling us how much they love it. sigh No one cares how you made your product...we only care what it sounds like and how much it costs.\n\nAs for CPU hit, I have 7 instances running now and the hit is negligible on my machine.\n\nI haven't even got through all the sounds yet. I wish I could push a button that would automatically delete anything based on a reverse or burning piano. (Seriously. Like anyone could every use any of those sounds. Ooops, I forgot about bad horror movies.)\n\nHey, I'm always opinionated but always accurate ðŸ™‚\n\nYes, I'm glad I got it. Tons of super useful sounds. I'm only using Kontakt 3 and the stock Logic sounds and Omnisphere, and I have more than enough to do what needs to be done. Search youtube and you'll hear what it can do.\n\nLink"
