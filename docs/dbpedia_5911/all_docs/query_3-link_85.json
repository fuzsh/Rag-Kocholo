        "text": "Post by ragan on\n\nI just got a new machine and have been downloading and installing things for days to get all my audio and school stuff up and running. I want to give a little mention to two great customer service experiences I had in the process.\n\n1. Spectrasonics - I rely on Keyscape a lot. Went to download the software and libraries and found a sort of confusing situation where there weren't installers in my account and there was an option to generate a fresh install for $10. I sent them a mildly snarky email about it and got an almost immediate response from Brayden in their tech support. He (gracefully) reminded me that when I bought Keyscape I had opted for the physical copy and wondered if I still had it. I had totally forgot and sure enough it was all sitting in my studio closet. Had Keyscape up and running in no time.\n\n2. GForce - one of my other all-time favs is MTron Pro. I use it a ton. GForce's website has been down for days and I was getting really frustrated because I wanted to use it on something this weekend. Sent them a somewhat snarky email about it too and got a fast response from Graeme apologizing for the inconvenience and pointing out that GForce had sent several emails warning customers that they'd be migrating to a new website and the old site would be down for a few days right now. Sure enough, the emails were right there in my inbox and I'd just ignored them thinking they were run of the mill promotional/marketing messages. But Graeme took my info and manually generated a download link for the libraries and software I needed as well as retrieving my license info so I could register it.\n\nAll of this took place on a weekend when I wouldn't expect to necessarily get a response at all and in both cases it was my own carelessness that led to my needing support help. I just want to give both companies a shoutout for great service on products I bought years ago.\n\nwww.spectrasonics.net/\n\nwww.gforcesoftware.com/"
