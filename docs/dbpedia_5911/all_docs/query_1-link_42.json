        "text": "Hey! So I recently had to do a clean install of everything on my M1 laptop and now for some reason I'm having trouble with Spectrasonics and Kontakt in Logic Pro. They work in Pro Tools and Ableton, but they are not receiving midi in Logic. I've seen some articles awhile back where people had problems with multi out type of synths in Logic. Does anyone know of a solution?\n\nJust to explain exactly what's happening... I open Omnisphere/Kontakt, pick a sound, play my keyboard and nothing happens. Open up any Arturia synth and everything works great.\n\nThanks as always for the help!\n\nSo after messing around some more, when I open up the track parameters and change the midi out to '1' instead of 'All' it works. I've never had to do this before. Is there maybe something I've clicked or messed up in the process of installing/setup?\n\nThanks!\n\nYour keyboard is transmitting on some other MIDI channel than 1, so the first part, that in multitimbral instruments like Omnisphere and Kontakt, responds only on channel 1, won't play.\n\nThis is why rechannelising all incoming MIDI (eg, from your keyboard transmitting on channel 3 for example), to 1, now works.\n\nIt's best to leave your keyboard transmitting on MIDI channel 1 for a generally easier life.\n\nEdited November 22, 2022 by des99"
