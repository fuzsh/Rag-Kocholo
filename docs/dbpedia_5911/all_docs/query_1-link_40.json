        "text": "Bought KS on cards thinking this would make installation quicker, but the url that came on the cards doesn't work. When I try to copy paste it into a browser it leads me to a help page that says \"click the url\"- with no other options.\n\nWhen I add the serial to my Spectra account it gives me links to updates and authorization, but no install. I've emailed them twice but no response. Emailed the place I bought it from, no response.\n\nDoes anyone have any other ideas besides the brilliant links that all lead me to \"click the url link\" that doesn't work?\n\nReally, really frustrating.\n\nFinally got it to work by:\n\n1) right clicking the link, select \"Open with...\",\n\n2) change \"recommended applications\" to \"All applications\",\n\n3) open with a browser OTHER than Safari,\n\nit gives me a blank page with a long link starting with:\n\n[InternetShortcut]\n\nURL=https:...\n\n4) Select just the https: part with everything else after it. Copy it (command C)\n\n5) Paste the address into the browser page location (command V) then hit return.\n\nIt should bring you to a page where you can:\n\n1) log into your account, then\n\n2) download the installer.\n\nI've only gotten this far in what will probably be a many step process to install it off a card that I bought to make the installation easier. Wow. Seems like they could put the 181Mb installer on the bloody card, but no. Got to have internet access AND the cards to make this work. Crazy.\n\nThanks Spectrasonics! Could you at least document this somewhere? Pretty crazy just to get through Stage 1. Hopefully the other 8 stages will be more obvious.\n\nPerhaps I'll be able to hear my expensive purchase before Christmas. Ok, I'm done whining.\n\nhttps://vi-control.net/community/threads/spectrasonics-keyscape-the-samplecast-review.57351/\n\nRuben mentions the issues of downloading on his webinar on Keyscape Kurt. I think he called it a pain in the bum.\n\nAfter watching, I bought it today from T&S in stick form. I'm driving down there to pick them up when the weather gets better, but if anyone has used the sticks as opposed to internet download, I would sure like to know if there were any issues.\n\nThanks Baron, unfortunately mine IS the usb cards (stick form). The samples are on the cards but you can't download them until you sign in online to your spectra acccount and get to an install page where you download the install app (181MB) in order to install off the cards. I suppose it's so you have to sign on before installing, but it would have been kinder to give us the install app on the cards then have us sign in to authorize it. They give you a 3 day demo before you have to authorize, but you still need to sign in to get it installed, silly and unnecessasarily complicated.\n\nTook many more steps to install, and for me it didn't finish properly (didn't get the final \"installed properly\" screen) but it seems to work fine. After installing (which will take an hour or two OFF THE CARDS) then it all needs to be updated, but that only takes another 5 minutes or so (samples don't change). I assume the update fixed whatever errors might have been in my install. Either way it will tell you when you open the plugin what version you have.\n\nI'm sure I'll eventually forget all this trouble (the B card even stuck to the box it was in when I was trying to get it out- I had to tare it out -very weird). But it will be a while before I update to Omni 2.\n\nHey! I just purchased Keyscape from Spectrasonics own website and tried to open the download link that was sent to my outlook account. I tried, I tried & I tried but nothing was working for me and i could not find a way to download the installer. I was so frustrated because it seemed like nothing was working, but eventually I solved the issue ;'D. The reason i couldn't open it and why it gave me the \"Error Page\" was because i tried to open it through my built in E-mail program on my PC. I tried going on my internet browser and open it via Outlook.com instead and I am now in the process of installing it.\n\nAlso, @kurtvanzo. Your comment about being able to hear your expensive purchase before Christmas made me laugh a little inside . Hope this helps somebody, because the feeling of frustration is insane when shit like this doesn't flow smoothly. Thanks!\n\nNow it's (late) 2022 and I decided to start using Keyscape I got some time ago. Opened the sealed box, registered the serial, then inserted the first of two usb drives, showing up empty.\n\nNothing on drive A, while the second card drive (B) holds a Steam folder.\n\nAn empty usb drive, really Spectrasonics? Of course, impossible to activate or even transfer files from an empty drive. And I don't wish to download Keyscape, which is why I got the boxed version. Moreover, if I were to download from their site, and wanted to use the 30GB lite version, I would have to download the full 80 gigs first. Figure that.\n\nExpensive box, yet unworkable. Anyway, I wrote support, but maybe someone else here had the same problem?"
