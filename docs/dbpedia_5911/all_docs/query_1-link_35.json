Which version of Trilian do you reinstall? If I reinstall an update, the app just stays registered, so I still can't get challenge code. and which keygen do you use?\n\nInteresting x 1\n\nList\n\nI am assuming you are talking about updates on sister site November 13th by someone with a name similar to a hated music style?\n\nMy questions is:\n\nIf this is causing problems for people, (with all due respect) why is it still there to be downloaded?\n\nActually I saw a comment saying at least one of these is just the same as on the website, which everyone ought to know to keep away from unless someone with knowledge says it is ok.\n\nAnyway, it is one thing if people don't follow instructions, but this just seems like a trap.\n\nDoes this have anything to do with it being Friday the 13th?\n\nNo!! Don't download the links!! Don't download the links you fool!! Ahhhhh!!\n\nThe r4e updates work great on Windows.\n\nI did not need to even reauthorize Keyscape or Omnisphere, but I did need to do reauthorize Trillian.\n\nThe only \"tricky\" thing with that is to click on the blue 'click here' at the bottom of the Authorization screen...\n\nThat copies the Authorization URL to clipboard and then to run the appropriate \"xxx Challenge Code Decoder\"\n\n( Trilian 1.5.0d Challenge Code Decoder in this case).\n\nThen you paste in as usual.\n\nSo how do you find trilian, working ok?\n\nIt seems r4e confirmed that 1.5 trilian is buggy, missing gui stuff, resources were batch exported from omnisphere etc. basically trilian 1.5 is unreliable and unfinished\n\nOmni and keyscape updates seem all OK\n\nHmm .. I am looking ..I usually use Omnisphere interface.\n\nTrilian is looking ok so far but i am not used to looking at it.\n\nThanks for the info - I will keep checking it.\n\nOh, now I see what he is saying in the comments:\n\nsomeone said: \"Anyone having issues with the presets not being saved? On about every third restart of logic, Trillian won't recall my saved preset and I'm presented with an empty default GUI.\"\n\nr4e replied,\"Trilian is quite buggy in v1.5, we should wait for another update.\"\n\nYea preset issue, fx GUI stuff missing, crashing even before being cracked: i think ill skip this trilian update..\n\nbut, i think the others are good\n\nUseful x 1\n\nList\n\nYou were reading something wrong and didn't continue reading to the solving comments.\n\nMissing GUI elements only appear when you don't update the patch library.\n\nAlso resources weren't \"batch exported\" from Omnisphere, Trilian now is just based on Omnisphere as I could see.\n\nYes, sometimes it crashes (on windows only) but most incidents appear by incorrect usage.\n\nNope it's not. You just have to use the software updates and the patch library updates. Thats it.\n\nThe keygen is currently not able to patch further updates besides Omnisphere. That's why I added the patches manually\n\nto the post on the sister site.\n\nLike x 2\n\nList"
