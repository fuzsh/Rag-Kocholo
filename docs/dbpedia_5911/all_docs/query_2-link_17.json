        "text": "I see a big swing for this program. Generally at places like Sweetwater and Musicians Friend the price is in the 479.00 range.\n\nSome vendors though have it for a lot less like this one.\n\nAm I missing something? Since the vendors are not as well known I question some of it. Do you know of any better known vendors who offer this product at this price?...and why is it so much less at this vendor? Thanks.\n\nExactly. It's why it almost seems legit to me. The internet bots are really coming down on pirate sites now and bots take those sites down almost immediately. That place has been around for year.\n\nFrom what I've seen pirated software has mostly gone to private bit torrent servers that you pay a fee to be a member of and then you download whatever you want. It's how the torrent site's get around being responsible for what is posted. I discovered this when I was trying to find ways to download digital copies of movies I own and it led me down that rabbit hole. In the end it was easier to just buy a cheap disc drive and use a tiny free utility and do it myself.\n\nThere is enough free stuff out there that I see no reason for pirated software. Between Gimp, Blender, and Open Office and the plethora of free plug-in's for both I waved goodbye to Adobe and Microsoft a very very long time ago. And there's more free DAW's, VST's, VSTi's, and samples of every size, shape, and genre you could ever want or use in a lifetime.\n\nBut again, before totally writing this site off, I would seriously check with Sweetwater or the company who makes it. It could be returned software. Who knows. It's legal to transfer licenses. That's what BiaB was when I got it from Sweetwater. It was a return that they used for demo's at shows and then I got it. I know it was a return because it still had Christmas wrapping paper on the bottom of the box. They all do that stuff all the time.\n\nThe only reason my scale is tipping toward it being a legitimate site is the fact they've been around so long. But I could be wrong.\n\nOne thing I haven't done so far is a license transfer. To me that would seem legit if I knew the person or was familiar with their site. I don't think I would deal with a site like this with no reputation along with all of the other shady things mentioned about it.\n\nSome financial services like Paypal have certain protections a customer can fall back on. Most credit cards have protections in the event of fraud. I wouldn't order in the first place, but if I thought I might be getting into something I could regret, I would at least check my credit card company's protective measures beforehand so the \"just in case\" the deal goes sour you can get your money back.\n\nI only had an issue once and it wasn't online. I traced it back to a hotel I stayed at. I immediately called the cc company and got it cleared up.\n\nI love this guy's videos, he really knows how to play scam telemarketers-\n\nScammer Payback"
