        "text": "All positive with Spectrasonic\n\nI went out of my way to make sure a left a positive review because I’ve had 2 great experiences with Spectrasonic’s customer support.\n\nSpecifically an fellow named Alex helped me out, always seeming genuinely happy to help. Responses were quite prompt, and he solved my problems in short order.\n\nNever dismissive, he’d always let you know he’s a quick email away. Credit where credit is due, their customer support seems about as good as you can ask for!\n\nDate of experience : January 20, 2021\n\nBrilliant customer service!\n\nI had a problem with Trilian, a Spectrasonics bass plugin. After it looked like it was too complicated for email discussion, one of their guys (Alex) actually called me in the UK from LA, where they're based.\n\nHe really knew his stuff and using screen-sharing, and patiently sorted it all out for me.\n\nNow that's what I call customer service!\n\nDate of experience : January 15, 2021\n\nSpectrasonics is an unbelievable first class music software company\n\nThis is a first class company that goes way over the top with their service in helping a person using their software. The integrity of the people that work there is (once again) over the top. No wonder Spectrasonics has grown Worldwide. When a fantastic sounding software appears such as Spectrasonics and is backed up with superior service, how could you possibly go wrong.\n\nThanks to Brian, Technical Support Specialist\n\nRocky James Tatarelli\n\nDate of experience : May 01, 2019\n\nAbsolutely amazing!\n\nAbsolutely amazing!\n\nInsanely good quality support. I had problems upgrading and registering Omnisphere 2 when it came out. After a few mails (with quick response by Spectrasonics.) a support guy called me and solved the problem. I might add that there's a 10 hour time difference from me to Spectrasonics in Burbank, CA but they called me after my country's business hours and sorted it out. How's that for service?\n\nSpectrasonics make the best plugins in the business and their support are just as good. Well done!\n\nDate of experience : July 04, 2019\n\nnah...fix that\n\nuntil they give you full access to re-download the program without getting permission through email or paying $10..ill keep it 1 star.. doesn't feel like a secure lifetime purchase for $500..\n\nDate of experience : September 09, 2020\n\nI've never experienced such amazing…\n\nI've never experienced such amazing customer support and service. I had issues with Omnisphere and was guided for 45 minutes until it was fixed. Braden (the guy helping me) was cool, calm and very good at directing me trough the process. Amazing company!\n\nDate of experience : May 09, 2019"
