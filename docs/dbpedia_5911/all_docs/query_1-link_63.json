        "text": "Re: Roland Scat Voice sound\n\nUnless you have a sample of the Roland sound itself, you are not\n\ngoing to get an “exact” duplication of it on the XS, from anywhere.\n\nThe “Treasure” collection was provided by Yamaha on a CD that shipped with the Motif ES, I believe. Yamaha has a\n\nstrict policy of not using samples from other manufacturers workstations. This can lead to legal trouble for them. Technically, a sample is a “recording”, and the same criteria applies for samples from other workstations as it does for samples on music tracks. So what the “Treasure” collection provides is something that sounds “similar” to the Roland sound.\n\nThe above replies are correct - if you really want a particular sound from a Roland product, you need to have the Roland product.\n\nHere’s some advice from kindly “Uncle Dave” - don’t get too\n\nfixated on a novelty sound from another product. There are\n\nplenty of other sounds “in the same genre” from other sources. I had a Roland Fantom X6 for quite awhile, the “dooh” scat sound was in that workstation, and frankly I never found a use for it in any music production.\n\nRe: Roland Scat Voice sound\n\nDave, all\n\nyes, agree...it’ Roland that has Roland sounds.\n\nHowever, I cannot find ANY “scat” type of choir / voice ( like e.g this Roland one,or the Kurzweil Take 6), etc.. for the XS.Is there something out there of that kind? ( Google did not help in this case, and searching this forum (for “scat”, not for “Roland\") got me into this thread.\n\nThanks, Carth\n\nRe: Roland Scat Voice sound\n\nStart here:\n\n[url=http://www.ilio.com/spectrasonics/vocalplanet/index.htm]http://www.ilio.com/spectrasonics/vocalplanet/index.htm [/url]\n\nTake 6 library here:\n\n[url=http://www.kurzweilmusicsystems.org/Product.php?product=183]http://www.kurzweilmusicsystems.org/Product.php?product=183 [/url]\n\nI beleieve Translator includes Kurzweil format translation.\n\nThere were some libraries put out in the Roland format, back in the 90’s, however, the old Roland S-770 sampler is long gone, and these days it isn’t a format that new libraries are available in. I believe “Vocal Planet” itself is in Akai and Roland formats, both of which can be opened in Kontakt, Halion, EXS24, and MOTU Mach 5.\n\nAnyway, there’s a ton of stuff on “Vocal Planet”, but you’ll have to translate it to Motif native format with Chicken Systems Translator and use the sample waveforms to make your own new voices with. Or you can load the “Vocal Planet” library into a software sampler such as Kontakt2/3, Halion One, Logic’s EXS24, or MOTU Mach Five.\n\nBTW, Spectrasonics’ Eric Persing was the guy who did the bulk of Roland’s sampling years ago."
