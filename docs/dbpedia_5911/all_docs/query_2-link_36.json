        "text": "Yes I'm on Mac and I have so many great keyboard libraries, I have no desire to cause Omnisphere to self destruct for me to have another another Rhodes or Clavinet.\n\nAgree x 1\n\nList\n\nHi guys, first of all, thank you all for your comments, this post saved my sanity!\n\nStill have a problem to solve though\n\nBasically I have an external HDD with all my plugins, including the dreaded \"STEAM\" folder. I run my libraries on 3 separate systems, 2 of which as Windows 10 based. On these, everything runs fantastic! Trilian, Keyscape and Omnisphere 2 run all perfect and all instruments can be accessed/selected from the Omnisphere 2 browser.\n\nMy issue is the 3 system, which runs OSX on a Mac Pro. Everything is updated to the latest version BUT when \"checking for updates\" within Omnisphere 2, I can see that all the patches version are shown as v0.0. Then when loading from Omnisphere I get \"soundsource not found\", database incomplete, etc.\n\nAs far as I can guess it must be either:\n\n- The fact that the external drive is formatted in NTFS and I used Paragon NTFS+ on the Mac to read/write on the HDD itself\n\n- Maybe the zmap created in Windows is not good enough for OSx\n\nI mean, I know the structure of the STEAM folder itself has to be right because the other 2 PCs are not complaining about it. Yet, it must be something to do with the STEAM folder because when I tested the official Omnisphere 2 authorisation (I own that one) it still came up with the same errors, so it can't be the VST or Software side of things. The only thing that makes sense is the HDD format.\n\nI'm going to run a test using a completely separate HDD formatted for Apple OSx, but before I mess around with 170GB of data, does anyone have any similar issues or experience with this problem?\n\nThanks\n\nUseful x 1\n\nList\n\nHi Mottel, sorry my English ...\n\nwhen you say you have the correct versions of Omnisphere, which versions are you referring to?\n\nI also had the same problem, but I solved doing all the right updates.\n\nIf by chance you had not read, I attach the links of the forum, where I explain how I did it!\n\nThere are images where you see the before and after the cure!\n\nhttps://audiosex.pro/threads/keyscape-not-loading-sound-source.31130/page-3\n\nHi, if you have the version of omnisphere installed and it is version 3.2.1,\n\nall you need to do is upgrade your version to 3.2.2, creating an account for yourself on the Spectrasonics website and downloading all the updates you need to bring the software along with its satellites to work properly ...\n\nI paste the links kindly posted by Pinkman:\n\nhttps://www.spectrasonics.net/support/ua-omnisphere2-updates.php\n\nhttps://www.spectrasonics.net/support/ua-keyscape-updates.php\n\nhttps://www.spectrasonics.net/support/ua-trilian-updates.php\n\nhttps://www.spectrasonics.net/support/ua-stylusrmx-updates.php\n\nUse the [LEGACY DOWNLOAD AREA] for the older revisions.\n\nin addition I also paste the link of the forum where I posted the images that highlight\n\nomnisphere before and after updates:\n\nhttps://audiosex.pro/threads/keyscape-not-loading-sound-source.31130/page-3\n\nI hope I have been helpful\n\nbelow all the files I downloaded to update everything:\n\nOmnisphere_Software_Update_Win_2_3_2h\n\nKeyscape_Patch_Library_Update_1_1d\n\nKeyscape_Software_Update_Win_1_0_2c\n\nKeyscape_Soundsource_Library_Update_1_0_2\n\nI have the 2.4 version and everything thing is updated Iâ€™m still getting the soundsource for keyscape error"
