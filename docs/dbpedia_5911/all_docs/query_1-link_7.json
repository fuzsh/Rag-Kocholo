If you have already made an account, you don’t need to make another. Just make sure to continue using the same one.\n\nRegister the serial number\n\nTo get access to your Spectrasonics installers and updates, you first need to create an account and register the serial number. Follow the steps below to get your software registered.\n\nInstall and Authorize\n\nOnce you have the serial number registered to your account, the next step is to install it then authorize it.\n\nInstall the software\n\nOnce you have the serial number registered to your account, the next step is to install it. This is a two-step process as you first need to download the installer files, then run the installation and data update files. We recommend installing them to a dedicated external hard drive and creating a folder with a unique name such as Spectrasonics Library or Spectrasonics Content to install your library to. Follow these steps to get your software installed.\n\nAuthorizing the libraries\n\nThe final step in activating your Spectrasonics library is to authorize it to your computer using the unique response code generated. You will need an internet connection to complete the authorization. Follow the steps below to authorize your library.\n\nPaste the challenge code on the Authorization page.\n\nRelated Content"
