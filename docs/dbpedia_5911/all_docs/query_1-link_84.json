That's the beauty of this library, the presets are really fantastic and useable on a wide scale. Expertly programmed stuff to begin with...not a lot of need to futz, and the programmed controls do great things to the sounds to keep them dynamic.\n\nI've never really been a dial up the presets guy but this library felt like it needed a get to know you project as the sounds have a simple but cutting edge quality about them, something that lacks from most preset sets (always overdone I feel like).\n\nDaniel I dunno but probably if you recognize it!! Awesome work if you were responsible for some of the sounds! Thank you and thanks for your contribution!!\n\nYep just went to air.\n\nAnd in all honesty I didn't do a ton of processing besides eq and compression, a smidge of simple things like delays and verbs, and perhaps some creative audio slicing here and there.

Thank you and thanks for your contribution!!\n\nDon't be afraid or ashamed to use presets, thats what they are created for :D a preset is kinda like writing a tremolo for strings, its a predetermined effect that the composer chooses to use in a creative way as part of a whole.\n\nGreat work again mate.\n\nDan"
