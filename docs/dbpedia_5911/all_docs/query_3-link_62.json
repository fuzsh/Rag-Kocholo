        "text": "xCalibre Mon May 25, 2009 8:12 am\n\nI have created Automap Mappings for Omnisphere (AU only).\n\nHere's the link for the novation website - [url=Omnisphere]http://www.novationmusic.com/community/file?id=21[/url]\n\nI have uploaded it there.\n\nIt has 2 files inside.\n\n1. Omnisphere.automap, and\n\n2. Omnisphere.midiLrn (I'm sure u can use this file even if you have a VST omnisphere)\n\n1. Load the Omnisphere.automap through automap and then select it to be the default control map for the client (you can do that through the file menu).\n\n2. Copy the Omnisphere.midiLrn file to either :\n\nHD/Library/Application Support/Spectrasonics/STEAM/Omnisphere/Settings Library/Presets/MIDI Learn/\n\nOr\n\nUser/Library/Application Support/Spectrasonics/STEAM/Omnisphere/Settings Library/Presets/MIDI Learn/\n\n(This depends on wherever you installed your Omnisphere library).\n\nNow the most important part (also the most irritating) is to load Omnisphere.midiLrn file in every instance of omnisphere in every project that you might work on. (This you can do by right-clicking on omnisphere and then going to 'Midi Learn' and then by selecting 'Load MIDI Learn Template'.) If you copied the Omnisphere.midiLrn file correctly, then doing this should take you directly to the file.\n\nThere are five pages of mappings. I've tried to divide the sections to diff pages:\n\n1st is for the Multi page in omni.\n\n2nd for Filter\n\n3rd for Oscillator\n\n4th for LFOs (only first 4)\n\n5th for Envelopes\n\nThere are a few random mappings: like Arp On/Off is on page 3 and Layer A and B levels are on page 2. So do check it out fully to know of other random maps.\n\nIve only added mappings of Aux 1 for each of the 8 multis. Would request you to add the rest yourself.\n\nIts very easy.\n\nFirst select the crosshair at the bottom of the omni (next to the Red A) so that it becomes red and you are in Automate Once mode on the automap window.\n\nNext right-click on the knob or slider on omnisphere that u want to map and select 'Enable Host Automation'.\n\nNext move the knob or slider on omni.\n\nfinally move the knob or slider on the SL that u want to map it to.\n\nNow u have to move the knob or slider on SL fully in both directions till you see the corresponding knob or slider move in omni.\n\nThat should do it.\n\nI have done these mappings with my new Novation Remote SL 37 Limited Edition (UV Green) - Infact my first ever Midi Controller. And its just f*&%$#g amazing.\n\nHave fun with this kick plugin and your sweet novation.\n\nRe: Omnisphere Automap Mapping\n\neops Mon Jun 08, 2009 6:31 am\n\nOh that is just the sort of thingI was hoping to find on this forum - thanks!"
