        "text": "Actually, for keyboard players and non - keyboard players that write music for money, or play live, Keyscape is one of the most important libraries that has come out for quite a while. Useful is not even close to what this library will be over the long term, especially when you put it through Omnisphere 2.\n\nIMO, this is an incredible piece of kit that will repay itself over and over again. The second this library was mooted, I became very interested because it was apparent what this library was going to be capable of very quickly, provided it was playable: which it is. A lot if single keyboard libraries at anything from $99 to $200 plus, are not playable, requiring too much investment in time and effort and generally sound like crap.\n\nSome people buy every library that comes out and others buy libraries only after they make an educated judgement that it will give them a better than even chance to make a good return.\n\nI could wax lyrical about Eric and his team. But I don't need to.\n\nThis is a testament to the sound of keyscape:\n\nI'm working on a film that is a glee-style \"musical\" feature with on-screen production numbers and have already done the bulk of production for the songs, was pretty happy with where they were, going into post. This week about to start the score.\n\nJust got keyscape and now I want to replace ALL the pianos/keys in the songs and I've already found several patches that are definitely going to be heavily featured in the score.\n\nInstantly useful\n\nActually, for keyboard players and non - keyboard players that write music for money, or play live, Keyscape is one of the most important libraries that has come out for quite a while.

But I don't need to.\n\nI agree. I will definitely pick this up when I'm back on it writing and recording Rock and Pop stuff again. I need to pick up Omnisphere 2 first though. \"Need\".\n\nMaybe, but I don't see that at this time, maybe I'm missing something very unique here ? Isn't this just a bunch of classic Keyboard/Pianos/Electric Pianos ? what's so special about it compared to other libraries, VSTs, Hardware, ..etc. ?\n\nThe atmospheric patches are outstanding. There's also all the clanks and clunks in the more arcane keyboards as far a physical movement of the hammers against strings or tines that give a unique sound I've never heard before. As k mentioned earlier, it feels like a real instrument rather than a VI. Plays extremely well with Omni 2 as well.\n\n@ dcoscina , Thanks for the feedback. (Although doesn't Omnisphere offer enough of that ? Plus, I have a lot of other tools to create atmospheric sounds).\n\n@ Patrick de Caumette, Thanks. I will watch the videos.\n\nIt will also depend how much I might need to use it, and the fact that it also needs a considerable amount of disc space is another important detail to factor in. But, I guess it is worth checking out further, to see if it clicks with me.\n\nCheers,\n\nMuziksculp\n\nPut STEAM Folder anywhere you want.\n\nI prefer NVMe M.2 SSDs.\n\nNot a big fan of yellow progress bars.\n\nOn a big less lean PC I have TBs of samples, basically my hardware cloud.\n\nDecided to use Keyscape in Omnisphere....WOW.\n\nGranular FM Pianos and Celestes are sick...\n\nWe're only just seeing the concept of brilliance.\n\nCan't wait to see what patch GuRu's come up with.\n\nUntil then I'm having a blast doing old Bill Evans voicings.\n\nI have hurt my back from standing so long since Keyscape came out.\n\nTime to see the Masogynist....\n\nMaybe, but I don't see that at this time, maybe I'm missing something very unique here ? Isn't this just a bunch of classic Keyboard/Pianos/Electric Pianos ? what's so special about it compared to other libraries, VSTs, Hardware, ..etc. ?\n\nThe recording quality, flexibility and the PRESETS!! You don't see this in the official video but there is a ton of presets per instrument that give you a whole range of great sounding versions of the same instrument with the typical spectrasonics sound quality.\n\nLook, there's always a lot of talk about what this piano and that piano library sounds like in sample land right?\n\nForget all that shit. Why? Because pianos aren't like strings, drums, certain woodwinds, brass etc. They fall apart most of the time when they're exposed. They're thin and lack body. That's not to say your Granny would notice anything other than its something that sounds like a piano. Any piano player that's Grade 6 and above will tell you there's no comparison in the way they play, sound and many other nuances. It takes way too much time to get a sample piano to sound anywhere near good. If you want a really good sounding exposed piano, hire good studio time.\n\nTherefore, Keyscape based just on playablilty is going to make life much easier for many users based on the 'sound' and various hybrid and treated patches. We know it's not a real piano sound but it's going to be so much easier to get a good 'sound' fast, that Granny is still going to like."
