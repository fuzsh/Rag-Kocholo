        "text": "Thank you for purchasing Essential Omnisphere.\n\n1. Check if your version of Omnisphere is up to date (Spectrasonics Website).\n\n2. Keep a backup of this bundle and other products for easy later reinstallation or possible troubleshooting.\n\n3. For Windows/Mac users, locate the Steam folder, then, copy the folder called “Edgar Mantilla” into the directory: Steam/Omnisphere/Settings Library/Patches\n\nHow to Locate the Steam Folder:\n\nFor Windows Users this is the file directory (Windows Vista, 7 and 8):\n\nC:\\ProgramData\\Spectrasonics/Steam\n\n(For Windows XP users):\n\nC:\\Documents And Settings\\All Users\\Application Data\\Spectrasonics/Steam\n\nFor Mac Users this is the file directory:\n\nMacintosh HD/Users//Library/Application Support/Spectrasonics/Steam\n\nIf you can’t see your Library Folder on Mac:\n\nIn the Finder, choose Go > Go to Folder.\n\nIn the Go To Folder dialog box, type ~/Library\n\nClick Go.\n\nAfter this, launch your DAW, run Omnisphere and press the button “Refresh” (Next to Play and Sort buttons).\n\nImportant\n\nIf this is not your first time purchasing my patches, only copy the content inside the folder into the previous Edgar Mantilla folder in your computer. Do not replace or remove the previous folder.\n\nTip\n\nYou can use the LPF and HPF Master Filters in your Omnisphere instance for different results with your patches. This could make your sound brighter or darker."
