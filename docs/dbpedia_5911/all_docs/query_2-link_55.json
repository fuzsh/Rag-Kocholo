        "text": "So you want to delve into the world of Spectrasonics instruments, and Omnisphere has taken your fancy, but the price tag is a bit too high. And now you’re thinking: “Does Omnisphere ever go on sale?”\n\nIn this article, we’re going to answer that question, and give you some resources to check, so you can get the best deals on music plugins, and Spectrasonics software.\n\nDoes Omnisphere Ever Go On Sale?\n\nFrom what we can see, Omnsiphere has never been on sale on Spectrasonics official website.\n\nThere are constant promotions going on at music software resellers though, so it’s wise to check these retailers for potential discounts on Omnisphere.\n\nA good time to check for Omnisphere sales is on Black Friday.\n\nFor instance, Musicians Friend had a sale on Omnisphere that took it down to $357 back in 2017. So, keep an eye out on your favourite music retailers’ sites.\n\nYou may also be able to get an EDU discount, depending on your situation.\n\nDoes Omnisphere Have A Student Discount?\n\nThese licenses are only available for use in Schools, or Universities. They can only be purchased by an important, high-level staff member.\n\nThis would include:\n\nMusic Tech Head of Department\n\nProgram Director\n\nCourse Instructor\n\nTechnical Administrator\n\nHead Professor\n\nAnyone who is a high-level staff member, of a Music Technology, or Music related course can apply for the EDU program.\n\nIs Omnisphere Actually Worth Buying?\n\nThe capabilities of Omnisphere are endless, and it’s one of the best synths to use for sound design.\n\nThere’s a reason so many TV & Film producers use Omnisphere (alongside Kontakt), to produce their songs. It has incredible built-in presets that sound out of this world, and is fully equipped to make in-depth, intriguing sounds, that capture an audience.\n\nAnd, it doesn’t stop there.\n\nOmnisphere gives you the ability to open 7 instances of itself, in one patch. Giving you the ability to mix each patch using the mix window, and also allowing for an incredible array of 50+ FX to be applied to the master & controlled via automation.\n\nIf this doesn’t entice you enough, Omnisphere builds on that, offering an exceptional arp that can act as a step sequencer, play chords, add slides to playing, strums, and a plethora of interesting additions that make it the best arpeggiator we’ve ever used.\n\nYou can also record the MIDI played by Omnisphere’s arp, meaning that if you come up with a great melody, you can use that MIDI from Omnisphere and apply the same pattern to a different VST instrument to accompany Omnisphere.\n\nIt’s 110% worth the money, and you won’t regret having Omnisphere in your collection of VST plugins.\n\nDoes Omnisphere Come With Keyscape?\n\nWe’d recommend getting both (if you can).\n\nOmnisphere is great by itself but doesn’t have the best Piano sounds on its own. Keyscape however, is the best Piano VST plugin we’ve ever used. The sounds included are some of the most accurately modelled Pianos ever.\n\nYou get access to Rhodes, Grand Pianos, Upright Pianos & a tonne more acoustic and Electric Piano sounds.\n\nPersonally, we prefer it to Kontakt for Piano sounds and think Keyscape has the edge in terms of sound quality. The added functionality to Omnisphere makes Keyscape a must-have for any Omnisphere user.\n\nCan You Run Omnisphere On An External HDD?\n\nIt’s recommended to have a 7200RPM HDD for music production because it requires reading a lot of audio files. 5400RPM HDDs simply aren’t fast enough and will cause problems with your workflow.\n\nI personally use a 5400RPM HDD for Omnisphere, but it really does slow things down a lot.\n\nWe recommend that you get an SSD for music production and, if possible, get an external SSD too. However, if it’s not in your budget a 7200RPM HDD will do just fine.\n\nI use an SSD for my applications/samples and another internal 5400rpm drive for my user folder. Then the external is 7200rpm/FW400. Works fine for me. I definitely wouldn’t use a 5400rpm drive for anything audio-related, though.\n\ngearspace.com\n\nDoes Omnisphere Have Free Upgrades?\n\nOnce Omnisphere 3 is released, you will have to purchase an upgrade. This comes at a reduced rate than buying the software outright, but will still cost you money.\n\nIt works a lot like DAW software upgrades: for instance, if you buy Ableton 11, you’ll have to purchase the Ableton 12 upgrade when it comes around, but will receive updates until that day comes."
