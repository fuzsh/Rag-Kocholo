        "text": "Frequently Asked Questions\n\nSALES, UPGRADES, DELIVERY:\n\nWhere can I purchase Omnisphere 2?\n\nDownload sales and Upgrades are now available for purchase in our Webstore/Techshop. Physical sales (boxed with USB drive) are handled exclusively through our Authorized Resellers.\n\nIf I already own Omnisphere, is there an Upgrade to Omnisphere 2?\n\nYes! If you already are an Omnisphere customer, you are eligible for the Omnisphere 2 Upgrade - available now in the Webstore/Techshop.\n\nIf I already own Atmosphere, is there an Upgrade to Omnisphere 2?\n\nYes! If you already are an Atmosphere customer, you are eligible for the Omnisphere 2 Legacy Upgrade - available now in the Webstore/Techshop.\n\nIs there a DEMO version of Omnisphere 2 I can try?\n\nBecause of the size of our instruments, we don't offer Demo versions. However, you can contact one of our local dealers in your area in order to arrange a live demo of Omnisphere 2. To find a local dealer in your area, please contact your local Authorized Reseller.\n\nHow are Spectrasonics Instruments delivered to new users?\n\nAll Spectrasonics instruments are available in two different editions: Boxed and Download. The physical boxed editions now contain high quality USB drives and are sold exclusively to new customers through our Authorized Resellers. The download editions are now available and sold exclusively through our Webstore/Techshop.\n\nAren’t Spectrasonics Instruments delivered on DVD-ROMS?\n\nThey used to be, but this is no longer the case. All our physical boxed versions have now been revised with high-quality USB drives. For convenience, we now also offer download sales of new Spectrasonics Instruments direct to customers from our Webstore/Techshop. Both of these new delivery platforms offer much faster and more reliable installations than DVD discs.\n\nIf I buy the Boxed version, will I also be able to get a download in the future? If I buy the Download Edition, will I also be able to get a drive? If I have the DVD-ROM edition, will I be able to get the drive or future downloads if I need them?\n\nYes to all of the above! We are happy to announce that there are now alternative forms of installation available optionally to registered users - no matter which edition you have originally purchased.\n\nSpectrasonics is keenly aware that many users no longer have computers with optical drives and there are numerous scenarios when the convenience of downloading or the speed of a USB drive would be a preferred form of installation for different types of users. To address all the various user needs and scenarios, Spectrasonics has a new Support Services area that offers Alternative Installation USB Drives and Additional Download Installations for optional purchase. These services are available for purchase in our Webstore/Techshop for registered users.\n\nHow is the Upgrade delivered? Is it downloadable? How big?\n\nThe Omnisphere 2 Upgrade package is a 60GB download which you can order through Webstore/Techshop.\n\nIs the Omnisphere 2 Upgrade available as a physical product?\n\nNot at this time. Our download service is highly reliable though... even with slower connections.\n\nCan I download the upgrade?\n\nYes. The upgrade is now exclusively available as a download in our Webstore/Techshop.\n\nDoes an Omnisphere 1 license need to be registered and authorized in my Spectrasonics User Account in order to qualify for the Omnisphere 2 Upgrade?\n\nYes.\n\nDoes Omnisphere 1 need to be installed on my computer before purchasing and installing the upgrade to Omnisphere 2?\n\nNo. Upgrading to Omnisphere 2 will supply the complete 60GB Omnisphere 2 sound library, which includes the sounds from Omnisphere 1. If Omnisphere 1 is already installed, you will not lose any custom user-created sounds or third-party libraries.\n\nDo I need to have Atmosphere installed before purchasing the upgrade to Omnisphere 2?\n\nNo, but if you are an Atmosphere user you will need to have it authorized and registered to qualify for the Legacy upgrade.\n\nIs there a student discount price for Omnisphere 2?\n\nSpectrasonics doesn't offer student discounts, however qualifying schools and institutions can participate in our EDU program.\n\nDoes Spectrasonics allow for used sales/license transfers of Omnisphere 2?\n\nPlease see the License Transfer FAQs area of the Knowledgebase for more info on our License Transfer Policy.\n\nCan I upgrade if I bought a used copy of Omnisphere v1?\n\nYes, but only if that copy of Omnisphere has been properly license transferred through Spectrasonics.\n\nCan I upgrade if I bought a used copy of Atmosphere?\n\nYes, but only if that copy of Atmosphere has been properly license transferred through Spectrasonics.\n\nIf I upgrade my Atmosphere to Omnisphere 2 can I later resell and transfer the license of either instrument used to someone else?\n\nNo. Customers who participate in a special upgrade program for any Spectrasonics virtual instruments are not eligible for license transfers either for the original instrument or its subsequent upgrade. For example, if an original owner of Atmosphere takes advantage of our special “legacy” upgrade program to Omnisphere 2, the owner is not permitted to resell either instrument and no license transfer will be granted.\n\nIf I upgrade my Omnisphere v1 to Omnisphere 2 can I later resell and transfer the license of either instrument used to someone else?\n\nSince it is the same original license, Omnisphere 2 would still be eligible for a future license transfer. However, Omnisphere 1 cannot be transferred as a separate product.\n\nBASIC CONCEPTS:\n\nAre Omnisphere 1 and Omnisphere 2 different instruments/products?\n\nNo. Omnisphere 2 is simply the next major version of Omnisphere.\n\nIs Omnisphere 2 a Stand-alone app or a Plugin?\n\nOmnisphere 2 includes a standalone application and VST/AU/AAX plug-in platforms that work in all the major DAWs and hosts.\n\nWhat is the STEAM engine?\n\nSTEAM™ is our in-house core technology that is the foundation of Omnisphere, Trilian and a new generation of Spectrasonics instruments.\n\nSo does Omnisphere replace Atmosphere?\n\nYes, Omnisphere is Atmosphere's successor.\n\nCOMPATIBILITY/REQUIREMENTS:\n\nWhat are the minimum system requirements for Omnisphere 2?\n\nYou can view them HERE.\n\nIs it compatible with xxx?\n\nCheck our Compatibility FAQs in the Knowledgebase which we keep up to date with the latest info.\n\nWill Omnisphere 2 replace my Omnisphere plug-in?\n\nYes. Omnisphere 2 is the next version of Omnisphere. When installed, the Omnisphere 2 Upgrade contents (20GB) merge with the existing Omnisphere 1 library and become one product, replacing Omnisphere 1 as a plug-in.\n\nWhen opening older projects which use sounds from Omnisphere 1, will they load the same?\n\nAbsolutely - it is still Omnisphere! Version 2 is fully backwards compatible with version 1 projects.\n\nWill custom saved patches/multis be negatively affected when upgrading to Omnisphere 2?\n\nNo. They will open and operate the same as always.\n\nWill third party patches be negatively affected when upgrading to Omnisphere 2?\n\nNo. All third-party Omnisphere v1 libraries are fully compatible with Omnisphere 2.\n\nDoes Omnisphere 2 use Copy Protection?\n\nYes, please see the Copy Protection FAQs area of the Knowledgebase for more information on our system.\n\nDoes Omnisphere 2 include a manual?\n\nAll our instruments include a comprehensive online Reference Guide, which is accessible directly through the plug-in. The integrated Reference Guide is searchable and we can keep it up to date with the software releases. You can check out the Reference Guide HERE.\n\nHow fast of a computer will I need to run Omnisphere 2?\n\nAs with all virtual instruments - the faster the better. Omnisphere 2 is designed to run optimally on modern computers. See the System Requirements for more information.\n\nDoes Omnisphere 2 need more CPU power than Omnisphere v1?\n\nNot significantly more. Some newer patches require more resources than older ones. However, many new patches do not require more resources.\n\nDoes Omnisphere 2.5 need more CPU power than Omnisphere 2.4?\n\nNot significantly more. Some newer patches require more resources than older ones. However, many new patches do not require more resources.\n\nIs Omnisphere 2 compatible with 32-bit and 64-bit systems?\n\nOmnisphere 2.4 and earlier are compatible with both 32-bit and 64-bit systems. Omnisphere 2.5 and higher are compatible exclusively with 64-bit systems.\n\nCan I easily switch back and forth between Omnisphere 2.5 and Omnisphere 2.4?\n\nYes! We have a rollback installer that’s easy to use for this purpose if you are unsure if you are ready for 2.5 or not.\n\nDoes Omnisphere 2 use streaming?\n\nYes! Omnisphere 2 streams from the drive for quick loading of the sounds. Drive streaming is configurable as well.\n\nCan I selectively install parts of the Omnisphere 2 library since it is so large?\n\nBecause of patch compatibility, Omnisphere 2 must always be installed with the complete library. However, you can install the 60 Gigabyte library to a secondary or external drive if you wish.\n\nWill Omnisphere 2's streaming benefit from a faster hard drive?\n\nFast drives are a smart way to go of course. There's a chapter in the Reference Guide devoted to optimizing Performance with Omnisphere 2.\n\nCan I install Omnisphere 2 on a different drive?\n\nYes, you can definitely install the library to a secondary or external drive.\n\nUSER AUDIO:\n\nCan I Use My Own Audio in Omnisphere 2?\n\nYes! You can now use any WAV or AIFF audio files in Omnisphere as soundsources for creating your own amazing sounds! Omnisphere 2 supports bit depths up to 24-bit files and sample rates up to 192kHz.\n\nWill the audio import in Omnisphere 2 be for single audio files or multi-samples?\n\nOmnisphere 2 supports one audio file of any length per soundsource. You can layer up to four soundsources in a patch and 8 patches in a multi. Keep in mind that Omnisphere's focus is as a synthesizer and will never be a sampler with multiple velocities, key-mapping, round-robin, etc. - there are other instruments out there that do that very well.\n\nOmnisphere 2 allows you to easily turn your audio files and even your audio tracks/mixes into synthesis source for Omnisphere 2's powerful oscillators. It's remarkable how much you can creatively mangle one sound and transform it into something awesome!"
