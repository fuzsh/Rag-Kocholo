        "text": "Recently marking its 50th Anniversary, Alejandro Jodorowskyâ€™s surreal and visually stunning avant-garde odyssey has been fully restored in a lavish 4K restoration which takes viewers on a mesmerising journey through a series of bizarre and symbolic vignettes, exploring themes of spirituality, enlightenment, and the quest for transcendence. The film follows a character known only as \"The Thief,\" played by Horacio Salinas, who encounters an enigmatic alchemist, portrayed by Jodorowsky himself. The alchemist leads The Thief on a spiritual pilgrimage to the Holy Mountain, where a group of powerful and eccentric individuals seeks immortality and enlightenment. With production partly funded by John Lennon and Yoko Ono, the film's rich, surreal, visual style is complemented by a haunting and evocative score, composed by Jodorowsky himself. A deeply symbolic and allegorical exploration of the human condition and the quest for transcendence and enlightenment, THE HOLY MOUNTAIN challenges audiences to question their perceptions of reality."
