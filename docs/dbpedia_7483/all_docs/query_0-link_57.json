        "text": "[For immediate release] Eureka Entertainment to release Arnold Fanck's THE HOLY MOUNTAIN, the greatest of the German 'mountain films' and the film which launched the career of Leni Riefenstahl, digitally restored in 2K and presented on Blu-ray for the first time in the UK as a part of The Masters of Cinemas Series from 17 June 2019.\n\nGerman filmmaker Arnold Fanck made this beautifully photographed Bergfilm, or 'mountain film', in 1926. Written in three days and nights - especially for Leni Riefenstahl - The Holy Mountain took over a year to film in the Alps with an entourage of expert skiers and climbers.\n\nOstensibly a love triangle romance - between Riefenstahl's young dancer and the two explorers she encounters - Fanck relishes the glorious Alpine landscape by filming death-defying climbing, avalanche dodging, and frenetic downhill ski racing.\n\nDigitally restored in 2K, The Holy Mountain is a visual feast - and a fascinating look at the origin of a genre.
