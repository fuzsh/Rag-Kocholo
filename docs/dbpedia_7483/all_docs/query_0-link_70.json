        "text": "A pioneering 'berg' film from the silent days of German cinema starring Leni Riefenstahl, later made famous or infamous as the documenter of Nazi Germany in 'Triumph of the Will' (the 34 Nuremburg rally) and 'Olympiad' (the 36 Olympics). This was her first acting film and she does a lot of dancing (quite good) and some over-acting, (quite bad) waving her arms in the air and rolling her eyes, taking her cue from Mae Marsh, no doubt.\n\nThe eternal triangle story is so simple I still can't believe Fanck took 1¾ hours to tell it. However to give him his due a lot of the film is taken up by scenery shots some of which are quite spectacular. A downhill ski race is also a feature although Fanck clearly plays fast and loose with times and locations so don't expect anything to make a whole lot of sense during this section. If they had had continuity girls at that time this one would have been looking for another job in real short order.\n\nThe climax of the film comes when 'The Mountaineer' sees his fiancée (Riefenstahl) being groped by some man. He is furious but in true public school style attempts to sublimate his anger in a daring mountain climb much like Riefenstahl sublimated her excessive emotion in a dance earlier in the film. (Quite clearly at the time violent exercise and a cold shower in the morning was thought to be a cure for everything.) Half way up they have stopped for a rest on a narrow ledge when a chance remark by Vigo, the companion, makes 'the mountaineer; realise that it was the guy he is now roped to who was groping his fiancée. He is so furious that forgetting the floor space is somewhat restricted he makes a threatening gesture towards Vigo who instinctively steps back and ..whoops! (An earlier comment on this site stated that he planned to murder Vigo but Fanck makes it clear that he did not, it was an accident.)\n\nAn interesting comparison can be made between Fanck's movie and the recent mountaineering drama documentary 'Touching the Void' in which fact virtually duplicates the fiction of 'Holy Mountain'. Watching the two in close proximity is very illuminating for the ethos of both films. I think the earlier movie has the edge when it comes to cinematography despite the fact that fixed camera position is the rule though I expect in some of the locations even actors' movements must have been a problem. The shooting of the film itself was plagued by weather problems, ice kept melting, snow turned to slush and the whole project was nearly thrown out by UFA. This is not a great movie but, especially with the comparison with 'Touching the Void', it is a fascinating movie from a historical perspective as well as worth watching in its own right if you are a fan of silent movies.\n\nHave given this mixed feelings rating with regret, would never rate or review anything with malice or any kind of bias. Leni Riefenstahl was not a bad actress at all but was an even better director (the latter of which she is perhaps better known for and her personal life), and when it came to films centered around adversity in the mountains it didn't get much better than Arnold Fanck when it came to direction at that particular point in film history.\n\nSo it did sadden me that 'The Holy Mountain' didn't connect with me completely, being somebody that really did want to like it as Riefenstahl's directing efforts and her other mountaineering-oriented outings with Fanck have much to admire. Visually 'The Holy Mountain' is a triumph and there is some inspired direction, but it is far from exceptional story-wise and Riefenstahl went on to do much better things when her acting style matured and became more subtle and comfortable (neither of which evident here).\n\n'The Holy Mountain' has a good deal of good things. Visually it is masterly. The scenery is beautiful and atmospheric but even better is the cinematography. Not only are there some truly breathtaking images, but the moving camera and time lapse photography are so well used and make what happens raw and moving and the points of view interesting. It is a hauntingly scored film again and written with sincerity and good intentions.\n\nFanck's direction has a lot of impressive parts, especially when capturing the intensity of the action and emotional impact of it. As there are intense and moving moments here.\n\nOn the other hand, the story tends to be very dull and not particularly eventful, which may be down to that there is not a lot to it structurally and the film tried to pad it out. It is also excessively melodramatic, especially later on when it got very overwrought. The characters are underdeveloped and quite sketchy even.\n\nGenerally, the acting is nothing special and Riefenstahl herself went on to much better after. Here she overdoes it quite dreadfully and Fanck's direction of her is all over the shop.\n\nIn conclusion, watchable but underwhelming. 5/10\n\n\"Der heilige Berg\" or \"The Holy Mountain\" is a German silent film in black-and-white from the year 1926, so this one has its 90th anniversary this year already. It was written and directed by German filmmaker Arnold Fanck, a man who is mostly known for his mountain-themed films from the first half of the 20th century. The cast includes Ernst Petersen, a regular in Fanck's films, Leni Riefenstahl before her days as a propaganda filmmaker, and Luis Trenker, a famous mountain climber who turned to acting. The film runs for 100 minutes approximately, but I have to say that in terms of the story and the plot 50 minutes would have been more than enough. The story is not the greatest strength here about a pair of climbers and a woman who stands between them, but this is a common problem with Fanck's works. However, his biggest strength also keeps this film from being a really boring or disastrous watch. Visually, it is way ahead of its time, no doubt about it. The snowy landscapes are a joy to watch and I can see why this film still appeals to people today. There are some genuinely beautiful shots in here. However, this is not enough to make up for the deficits in terms of story-telling and my overall verdict for this movie from between World Wars I and II is a negative one. Thumbs down and I do not recommend the watch. The good thing for foreign audiences is that this film also exists with English intertitles if they really want to see it. But I cannot really support this decision."
