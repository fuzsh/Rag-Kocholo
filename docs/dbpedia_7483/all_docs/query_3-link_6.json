        "text": "This was the third film I saw in the IFI’s Alejandro Jodorowsky season (or the fourth if you count Jodorowsky’s Dune (Frank Pavich’s documentary about Jodorowsky’s failed attempt to adapt the Frank Herbert novel). After not liking Fando y Lis at all and being somewhat ambivalent about El Topo, I was getting a bit worried about this whole Jodorowsky season, but fortunately The Holy Mountain is a complete classic. It sees Jodorowsky himself playing The Alchemist, who leads a series of characters, each representing one of the astrological planets, on another mystical quest, this time to reach the summit of the titular Holy Mountain, where they hope to learn the secret of immortality from the sages who dwell there. It looks amazing (bright colours of a kind no longer seen in cinema, what was it with the early 1970s?) and manages to retain a coherence despite its weirdo plot and endless use of symbolism. If you were to see one Jodorowsky film, this is the one. In fact, if you have any interest in art house cinema and haven’t seen it then you need to rectify that pronto. I don’t think I really have much more to say about this amazing work, one I am greatly looking forward to rewatching.\n\nHowever, one thing I was struck by with both The Holy Mountain and El Topo is the way Jodorowsky is one of few film-makers who frequently has disabled actors in his films. One of the characters in this one is a man possessed of only stumpy arms and legs, while El Topo has the dwarf woman of the second half plus in more supporting roles the other troglodytes (played by people of varying disabilities). An earlier part of El Topo famously features a man with no legs travelling around on the shoulders of a man with no arms. To some extent Jodorowsky is a director of excess, so you can imagine him just wanting to throw in these people for shock value, and yet it does not really feel like that, with the differently abled characters presented as people with agency and not as objects of pity or disgust. The films are also an interesting reminder of how rarely we see people with disabilities or bodily imperfections in films. Such is life.\n\nImages source (Taste of Cinema – 10 Reasons Why “The Holy Mountain” is The Best Surreal Movie Ever)"
