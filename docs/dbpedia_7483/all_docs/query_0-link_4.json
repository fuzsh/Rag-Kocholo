        "text": "Part of 30 Countries 2018. Today: Germany!\n\nI'm a big fan of Siegfried Kracauer's From Caligari to Hitler, but it doesn't have to be the lens through which all German silent cinema is seen. Nosferatu has elements which lend themselves to Kracauer's critique - the portrayal vampire as a stateless, physically repulsive immigrant who brings plague with him is fairly close to how Nazi propaganda depicted Jews, but it seems hard to imagine Murnau intended that. In any case, the movie is more commonly watched nowadays as a landmark in the horror genre, rather than anything specific to its time and place.\n\nThe Bergfilme, or mountain film, is harder to divorce from its historical moment. It's not just that, unlike…\n\nThe Holy Mountain (Der heilige Berg) is a German mountain and melodrama film written by Hans Schneeberger and Arnold Fanck.\n\nDiotima is an inspiring dancer, she meets the engineer and skier Karl in his cottage in the mountains and they fall in love and have a love story. When Karl Vigo's young friend meets the dancer after a performance, she gives him her scarf with a smile, which Vigo mistakenly believes she is in love with him or at least she has some interest.\n\nWhen Karl sees Diotima innocently fondling Vigo he thinks Diotima is betraying him with his friend. Karl decides to carry out his suicide plan and invites Vigo to climb the dreadful mountain with him during the…\n\nDid Arnold Fanck just change my life?\n\n(The film itself is incredible in many ways, but this text will be more about the insights it gave me in my own practice!)\n\nIf you've been a follower of mine for a while, I'm sure that you've managed to gather that I'm a filmmaker. Not a filmmaker in the sense that I make my living from it, but in the sense that I think about how make the next projekt every single day!\n\nI'm almost done editing my first ever feature length film, called Hälsö. Hälsö is the name of the small island outside Gothenburg I grew up on, and also where the film takes place.\n\nNow, how does all this talk…\n\nThe mountain films (Bergfilme) are a mostly forgotten subset of Weimar Germany's rich cinematic legacy, a short-lived movement spearheaded by director and keen outdoorsman Arnold Fanck whose adherence to realism and authentic outdoor photography is starkly at odds with the distorted fantasticism of his expressionist peers. The two could also be interpreted as opposite responses to the rise of fascism—the shadowy, nightmarish visions of Lang and Murnau are harbingers of psychological dread and foreboding—both would leave for America, whilst Fanck, who would go on to join the Nazi Party, whose alpine landscapes conjure up an idyllic portrait of Aryan perfection, seems to be celebrating the courage and physical excellence of the people, who are able to overcome adversity and conquer…\n\nGrüß Gott! It’s Oktoberfest again, which means it’s a good day for some homemade sauerbraten, some Hacker-Pschorr, and an echt-German film. It doesn’t get much more echt than this foundational Berg [mountain] film, which catapulted Leni Riefenstahl and Luis Trenker to stardom and established director Arnold Fanck’s reputation. It’s a triumph of style over substance, with the remarkable cinematography and stunt work (performed mostly by the actors themselves) outshining a fairly standard, if unexpectedly downbeat, love triangle. It also demonstrates Fanck’s influence on Riefenstahl’s later directorial style: expressionistic use of slow motion and rapid editing, commitment to difficult on-location filmmaking, etc.\n\nTrenker and Ernst Petersen are a pair of athletic friends. Each (unbeknownst to the other) falls in love with professional dancer…\n\nFilmed in and around the German Alps, director Arnold Fanck’s The Holy Mountain, self-described as “a Drama Poem with scenes from nature”, pits the flames of human desire against the icy forces of nature, as well as loyalty and faith against the ugliest parts of human nature (jealousy and rage), and it is truly a sight to behold. The overwhelming power of nature’s majesty consumes Fanck’s earliest (accessible) “mountain film”, and it nearly makes the players and their plight almost insignificant, like they are merely ants buried in the snow. But then again, one of the players in none other than controversial actress/director Leni Riefenstahl, whose career was basically shaped and molded by Fanck’s hand, so no matter how you…\n\nThe philosophy behind bergfilms is a bit lost on me. The endless beautiful alpine vistas can't quite disguise the fact that this is a simple story told at excruciating length. If you share the characters' spiritual devotion to the windswept peaks and treacherous crevasses, this may not be a problem. For me, the concept of expressing your love for a woman by wandering off to find the best mountain is an alien one.\n\nAnnoyingly, it picks up after about an hour. Fanck directs the skiing action well and injects a lot of tension into the big climactic climb. With that and the gorgeous scenery on display, I found myself warming to it towards the end. It definitely could have lost…"
