Maybe you know of a movie?\n\nI'm sure this isn't just an American thing... but nature doesn't seem to be stressed as much as American movies, where it's sometimes central to the movie, or at least constantly there, in the background of discussions between characters. Bergman was interested in Faro Island, but I can't think of any movies.\n\nPost by Prime etc. on\n\nThere are Euro Gothic films with an emphasis on Nature.\n\nI think people define gothic in the sense that they think of castles but actually Nature is very important in gothic atmosphere.\n\nI watched a giallo recently MY DEAR KILLER which used a lake and abandoned house as a setting--that has a really strong gothic atmosphere. The setting feels like a character--that is an element of gothic.\n\nI am not a fan of Atwood's literary theories but she said something once about the US is thematically guided by the frontier, and Canada was guided by survival (not sure that makes sense because the US also has to worry about survival)-I can't recall her mentioning Europe--I imagine places with colder temperatures have more of a Nature-focus than the places where there is so much infrastructure.\n\nPost by manfromplanetx on\n\nEmberek a havason , People of the Mountains (1942) Hungary Dir. István Szőts\n\nPeople of the Mountains is the story of a woodcutter and his family who relocate to live high in mountains of Transylvania. A wonderful lyrical portrait of a long-vanished way of life, of living in harmony with the natural environment. Creeping closer and threatening the community is the devastating impact of modern industrialization.\n\nShot almost entirely on location in harsh mountain conditions, using mostly non-professional actors, with a devotion to realism and the details of daily life, this was a groundbreaking Hungarian film and is still considered to be one of their best...\n\nPost by manfromplanetx on\n\nThere are Euro Gothic films with an emphasis on Nature.\n\nI think people define gothic in the sense that they think of castles but actually Nature is very important in gothic atmosphere.\n\nMedieval masterpiece...Marketa Lazarová (1967) Czechoslovakia Dir. František Vláčil. Set in the middle of 13th century in medieval Bohemia at a time when Christianity was pushing to replace the nature worshipers the Pagans. The bitter conflict between Christianity and Paganism, the conflict between the clans and central authority, is a major theme of this stunning film.\n\nPost by manfromplanetx on\n\nThe Edge of the World (1937) Written and Directed by Michael Powell\n\nThis marvelous film is the story of the depopulation of one of the isolated outer islands of Scotland, one by one, the younger generation are leaving for greater opportunities being offered on the mainland.\n\nFilmmaker Michael Powell gathered together a cast and crew who were willing to take part in an expedition to what was a very isolated part of the UK. They had to stay there for quite a few months and finished up with a unique film which not only told the human story but also captured the raw natural beauty of the location.\n\nThe area now contains Scotland's six World Heritage Sites with a mixed status for both its natural wonder and cultural qualities.\n\nPost by spiderwort on\n\nThe Edge of the World (1937) Written and Directed by Michael Powell\n\nThis marvelous film is the story of the depopulation of one of the isolated outer islands of Scotland, one by one, the younger generation are leaving for greater opportunities being offered on the mainland.\n\nPlanet, I saw this film decades ago, and I loved it.

The only film I could think of that meets your criteria is Kurosawa's DERSU UZALA (1975), but I don't think one can consider Siberia as Europe (maybe?).

A beekeeper in Macedonia provides for herself and her elderly mother by following the ancient traditions of beekeeping. Her motto is \"Take half, leave half\"--always respecting the importance of keeping nature in balance in order for it, as well as herself, to survive.\n\nWhen her territory is disrupted by a loutish, greedy group of nomadic beekeepers who refuse to follow her philosophy, it proves disastrous.

It's like the movie, \"Come and See\".. But I love many Eastern European movies, but they are dramas, without the melodrama.. Mostly movies about people, interactions, hopefully not too predictable.\n\nI'll check that first one, too, since I'm sure this movie in English would be easier to find.\n\nThanks!\n\nPost by london777 on\n\nThe Edge of the World (1937) Written and Directed by Michael Powell\n\nThis marvelous film is the story of the depopulation of one of the isolated outer islands of Scotland\n\nAnother 'Michael Powell in Scotland' movie which would qualify is I Know Where I'm Going! (1945), where the underlying theme is the tug-of-war between life in the countryside and in the city, and where nature, in the form of landscape, seascape and weather, strongly influences the protagonists' actions and choices.\n\nPost by london777 on\n\nIn the years immediately after WWII there were a number of British movies in which fugitives fled to the countryside to avoid apprehension. These contained extensive landscape sequences, at a time when the English countryside was deemed to contain therapeutic properties to heal the nation after violence endured.\n\nI can only now think of:\n\nHunted (1952) dir: Charles Crichton\n\nThe Clouded Yellow (1950) dir: Ralph Thomas\n\nThe 39 Steps (1959) dir: Ralph Thomas\n\nbut there were many others.\n\nPost by london777 on\n\n... a time when the English countryside was deemed to contain therapeutic properties to heal the nation after violence endured.\n\nOf course, by far the greatest of such 'countryside as therapy' films is A Canterbury Tale (1944) dir: Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, but this was made and set when the war was still raging. It sees the war as just an unusually large eddy in the stream of English culture and history.\n\nPost by london777 on\n\nFor my money, Thomas Hardy is second only to Dickens as an English novelist, and there have been some good films and TV series based on his work, in which nature played a dominant role.\n\nThe best of these is probably Far from the Madding Crowd (1967) dir: John Schlesinger, but the one which best exhibits Hardy's natural religion is the TV movie The Return of the Native (1994) with Catherine Zeta-Jones on top form. Who agrees that she would have been a better Bathsheba Everdene than Julie Christie? In this film the landscape is more rugged, and the locals' occupation of it seems more precarious.\n\nPost by manfromplanetx on\n\nThroughout Europe many bewitching cinematic tales have been adapted from traditional folklore. Centuries of superstition and folklore arose from the wonder, the mystery, the dynamic forces of the natural world.\n\nSome impressive films that come to mind...\n\nDivá Bára (1949) Dir. Vladimír Čech. Set in the East Bohemian village of Vestec. Bára is the only child of the local shepherd, whose wife died shortly after giving birth during a fierce electrical storm.\n\nDifferent from all the other local girls, Bára likes to walk barefoot and is not afraid of entering the dark woods or of thunderstorms, she swims naked and has great strength. Tanned from the sun and battered from the wind, Bára is an innocent child of nature. Superstitious villagers talk of her as a wild woman, believing that Bara is a child ‘forged by a midday'…\n\nValkoinen peura , The White Reindeer (1952) Set in Lapland in a spectacular natural environment this unique film is, based on pre-Christian Finnish mythology and Sami shamanism. Turning to the local Sharman, newlywed Pirita is given a potion that mistakenly turns her...\n\nThe village men are drawn to her and pursue her in the snowy landscape, where reindeer herds abound, with tragic results...\n\nLeptirica aka The She-Butterfly (1973) Yugoslavian/Serbian horror film based on Slavic mythology. Say no more, Excellent !\n\nZlaté kapradí, Golden Fern (1963) Czechoslovakia. A classic adult fairy tale film that tells of a Bohemian woodcutter who finds deep in the forest a magical alluring golden fern whose seed turns… Recklessly he does not appreciate his wonderous gift from nature and is led astray...\n\nBased upon Germanic folklore dating back centuries Die Nibelungen (1924) is still an exciting, epic adventure, from Fritz lang…\n\nImpressive is the enchanted forest ‘Wood of Woden’\n\nPost by manfromplanetx on\n\nIn the 1960s, DEFA the state-owned film studio of the German Democratic Republic produced the first of their \"Ostern films\" (Red Western), beginning in 1966 with The Sons of the Great Bear, directed by Josef Mach. Filmed in spectacular natural environments, this very popular film had a number of sequels and was notable for inverting tired old worn Western clichés. Very much in tune with their natural environment and the resources that sustain them, the films portray the native Americans as the \"good guys\", and the white settlers as the antagonists with little respect for the existing harmonious order of natural world...\n\nBlauvogel (1979) East Germany, Dir. Ulrich Weiß. This fabulous adventure film opens in the year 1755. This is a period of war between England and France for the expansion of colonies in the south of America. The Iroquois Indians while important allies to both parties in the conflict, are driven far into the mountains, staunchly preserving their traditional tribal way of life.\n\nSeven-year-old English boy George is snatched from his parents, new English settlers who consider themselves lords of their remote domain.\n\nGeorge is initiated into the tribe and given a new name 'Bluebird', slowly he fully adapts to his new way of life. As he matures George witnesses first-hand the exploitive practices of the colonialists, towards the Indians and to the natural world... After some years, at the end of the war, George is able to return back to his parents and the world of white people or will he choose to stay where his heart now lies, in the natural world of the Iroquois...\n\nThe film beautifully opens in a forest canopy, alive with bird song.\n\nGeorge's English family, new settlers eager to exploit an abundance of natural resources, read from the Bible."
