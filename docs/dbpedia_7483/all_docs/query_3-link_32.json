        "text": "directed by Alejandro Jodorowsky\n\n“Zoom back camera…Goodbye to the Holy Mountain. Real life awaits us.”\n\nThe legacy that Alejandro Jodorowsky left us in cinematic form of his 1973 production The Holy Mountain is one of the best examples of pop surrealism in movies. Described by most as the “weirdest movie they’ve ever seen,” Jodorowsky intended on making “a film that could be seen as a sacred text.” In the film, we follow an alchemist’s journey with his nine pilgrims on a quest to find the gods that inhabit a mystical “holy mountain” that holds the key to immortality. During the length of the film, however, we’re shown absurd depictions of excessive violence, sex, religious and sacrilegious imagery, each scene more dense than the last with abstract sound effect work (by noted SFX maven Gonzalo Gavira).\n\nIt’s difficult to put this film into words, as difficult as it is to review it. While some watch the film and find it boring and overkill on obvious symbolism or pretentiousness, others find the depth and imagery intriguing, especially towards the end where you find that Jodorowsky (who plays the role of The Alchemist) is really asking the audience to find the key to real life not in the cinema watching his movie but rather outside witnessing it firsthand. I found the random scenes of jarring scenarios to show how diverse the world can actually be, almost as if Jodorowsky as trying to desensitize the audience so that nothing in the world would be shocking or a surprise to see after witnessing this movie.\n\nThe film predicted the future decades’ obsession with materialism and excessive living with synthetic solutions to everyday problems or desires. It envisioned a world where machines produce more and more Christ-like replicas as we entertain ourselves with absurd distractions (such as an entire battle scene between frogs and lizards dressed as knights). And after enduring the hallucinations and dependence on the systematic ways of living, we’re introduced to the guru who will guide you to the path of understanding as a way out of the system.\n\n“The elements of chemistry are many but finite. So are the techniques of enlightenment. To reach it more quickly, we will combine the techniques. With the correct formula, any human being can become enlightened. The mortals are a group. If we are to succeed, we must cease to be individuals and become a collective being.”\n\nAs much as The Holy Mountain serves to bring the audience to enlightenment, the film also acts as “a cynical satire of hippie new age beliefs.” It examines the ludicrousness of social constructs and ceremonies that we perform for any given belief system by which we live our lives. One minute we’re obsessed with money, and the next we’re discovering how free we are without it, for example.\n\nI enjoyed this film, although most of it was difficult to sit through in one viewing, for me. It was like the film version of a 21-course meal, after which you’re expected to digest and reminisce on your favorite parts. For some, the answer is to see it for what it is in certain scenes. The insanity that is the scene where an old man with leopard tits shoots milk at a weary traveler is one example of deliriousness you can witness if you so choose to watch this. But really, if you get the film and skip to any chapter and watch for five minutes, you’re greeted by so many visually arresting, inventive scenarios that shows the power of film-making. This one influenced so many future directors and cult film fans, which is why it deserves praise. Jodorowsky just filmed what he wanted then left the definition of this film to its varied audience. If you like new avant-garde experiences and are tired of Michael Bay cut/paste filmmaking, you should definitely start with The Holy Mountain to shake some of those unresolved cinema-watching desires from your brain.\n\n8/10 plaster casts of naked actors on fire"
