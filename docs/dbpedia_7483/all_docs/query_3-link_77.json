        "text": "Chilean filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky is sometimes credited as being the “inventor” of the cult midnight movie. When his acid trip spiritual quest western El Topo played, it became one of the first veritable hits of the midnight cult circuit.\n\nJohn Lennon was so blown away by El Topo he got his manager, Allen Klein, to finance Jodorowsky’s next movie (and possible masterpiece) Holy Mountain (which we’re also screening tonight).\n\nEl Topo follows a mysterious gunslinger (played by Jodorowsky) “El Topo” (which means “the Mole” in Spanish) through a hallucinatory desert as he battles villains both external and internal. The more enemies he vanquishes, the more spiritual, strange, sexual, mysterious becomes his journey until the western genre fuses with the satiric and the spiritual to become something you’ve never seen before.\n\nThis feels like a movie that could only have been made in that window of the late 1960’s, early 1970’s when cinematic, artistic, musical expression suddenly broke out from the societal parameters that had bounded it for decades.\n\nJodorowsky, who got his start as a clown and mime, has always been determined to use cinema as a means of artistic expression. And El Topo is exhibit one in a movie that compromises for no one. It is, for better and worse, pure artistic vision.\n\nThere is controversy as well however and the audience should be aware that El Topo is plagued with concerns that there may be a scene of non-consensual sex. Jodorowsky himself asserted there was when the movie was released but later issued an apology and retraction explaining he had made up the story for “surrealist” publicity. Please follow your own counsel here. And do your own research.\n\nWhat’s important to assert right here though is that like David Lynch’s movies, Jodorowsky’s cinema has a there there. They aren’t just weird for weirdnesses sake. They are potent, meaningful, works of cinematic art.\n\nIt is in fact their spiritual and thematic ability to explore topics like societal hypocrisy, sexuality, spiritual journeys, politics in a singular mind-blowing cinematic style that makes Jodorowsky’s movies marvels.\n\nJodorowsky followed up El Topo with what may be his ultimate masterpiece, The Holy Mountain.\n\nHere Jodorowsky plays (he would star in almost all his movies) the “Alchemist” who gathers a group of people with singular abilities to make a journey to try to get to the top of the “Holy Mountain”. Call it the Avengers of midnight cult spiritual sexual satire cinema.\n\nBased on an unfinished novel, Holy Mountain shows Jodorowsky’s near preternatural ability to balance comedy, mind tattooing imagery, deeply earnest spiritual investigation, sexuality, and cinematic experimentation. He may have trained as a mime but he may be an even more talented juggler and tightrope walker.\n\nJodorowsky’s invented ending for the unfinished novel actually manages to stick the landing, providing a resolution that feels deeply true to the inner logic of the movie itself. And true to Jodorowsky’s own lifelong commitment to the merging of the sexual, physical, and spiritual.\n\nTwo of the greatest works of surrealist cinema (in a lineage that includes Bunuel and Lynch), El Topo and Holy Mountain are mind-expanding works of cinema. And we’re showing them both on rare 35mm prints.\n\nBest always,\n\nCraig Hammill\n\nSecret Movie Club Founder.Programmer\n\n*Please note that though we strive to always show titles on 35mm film if advertised, we may have to screen digitally if the print we receive is in such bad shape or if we don't receive the print in time because of a shipping delay.
