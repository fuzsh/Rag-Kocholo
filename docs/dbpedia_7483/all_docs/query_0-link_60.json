Written in three days and nights especially for Leni Riefenstahl The Holy Mountain took over a year to film in the Alps with an entourage of expert skiers and climbers.\n\nOstensibly a love triangle romance between Riefenstahl s young dancer and the two explorers she encounters Fanck relishes the glorious Alpine landscape by filming death-defying climbing, avalanche dodging, and frenetic downhill ski racing.\n\nDigitally restored in 2K, The Holy Mountain is a visual feast and a fascinating look at the origin of a genre.
