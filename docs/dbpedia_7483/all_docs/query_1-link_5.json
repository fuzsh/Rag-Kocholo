        "text": "Alejandro Jodorowsky’s “The Holy Mountain” is utterly wild surrealism mixed with mescaline trip, aesthetics of Viennese austerity, and esoteric practices. I don’t try to interpret such things-it’s a real mess. I think you have to take them in their pure form, without trying to parse them out, to find references, logic, and meaning. It’s a performance that is almost two hours long.\n\nNevertheless, unlike many similar experimental films, “The Holy Mountain” still retains some sort of narrative: Jesus returns to earth in the seventies, confronts corrupt and fallen humanity again, eventually denies Christianity and turns to a certain sage guru who introduces Christ to the mortal world as well as the rulers of that world — the patrons of the various planets of the solar system — and then they all go together, combining their talents as superheroes, to the Sacred Mountain to overthrow the nine Immortals, learn their secret and gain immortality for themselves. All this is accompanied by revealing satirical scenes about human vices and a great deal of eroticism — as, after all, the main driving force behind the world of sexual energy.\n\nThe abundance of futuristic sets and designs and bizarre, out-of-this-world images prompted me to read about the production and everything became immediately clear to me: the film was made on John Lennon’s money, and the actors were forced to sleep for four hours and fed LSD.\n\nDespite its surrealism, “The Holy Mountain” is nonetheless cinematic, and because of that it is quite watchable and, moreover, an unforgettable spectacle. It is, after all, a product of its revolutionary era, full of experimentation, play and freedom. The characters themselves in the final scene remind the viewer of this and of the illusory yet corporeal and real nature of cinema."
