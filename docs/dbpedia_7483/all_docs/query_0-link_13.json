        "text": "The Masters of Cinema Series\n\nThe Holy Mountain\n\nEdition no. 2\n\nBuy Physical Copy At:\n\nStreaming Options\n\nDirected by: Leni Riefenstahl, Arnold Fanck\n\n\"A Heroic Song from a Towering World of Heights\" — German filmmaker and doctor Arnold Fanck (1889-1974) made this beautifully photographed Bergfilm, or 'mountain film', in 1926. Written in three days and nights — especially for Riefenstahl — The Holy Mountain took over a year to film in the Alps with an entourage of expert skiers and climbers.\n\nOstensibly a love triangle romance — between Riefenstahl's young dancer and the two explorers she encounters — Fanck relishes the glorious Alpine landscape by filming death-defying climbing, avalanche-dodging, and frenetic downhill ski racing.\n\nAfter learning the ropes from Fanck, Riefenstahl's own Bergfilme flowered at UFA during the 1930s, and Fanck became her editor. This restoration is a visual feast — a fascinating look at the origins of a genre. Extras include the 3hr documentary The Wonderful, Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl (by Ray Müller) on disc 2.\n\nTechnical Specifications\n\nFormat: DVD\n\nAspect Ratio: 1.33:1\n\nAudio: Musical Score 2.0 Dolby Digital Surround , Musical Score 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround\n\nResolution:\n\nSubtitles: English\n\nRegion: 2\n\nDiscs: 2 Discs | DVD-9\n\n* some specifications may reference a film that is included as a special feature\n\nSupplements\n\nThe Wonderful, Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl (1993) by Ray Müller\n\nNew 2002 score by Aljoscha Zimmerman (Dolby 2.0 Stereo & Dolby 5.1)\n\nBooklet containing new essay by Doug Cummings\n\nForum Member Statistics"
