German filmmaker Arnold Fanck made this beautifully photographed Bergfilm, or mountain film , in 1926. Written in three days and nights especially for Leni Riefenstahl The Holy Mountain took over a year to film in the Alps with an entourage of expert skiers and climbers.

Ostensibly a love triangle romance between Riefenstahl s young dancer and the two explorers she encounters Fanck relishes the glorious Alpine landscape by filming death-defying climbing, avalanche dodging, and frenetic downhill ski racing.

Digitally restored in 2K, The Holy Mountain is a visual feast and a fascinating look at the origin of a genre. The Masters of Cinema Series is very proud to present this landmark film in its UK debut on Blu-ray.
