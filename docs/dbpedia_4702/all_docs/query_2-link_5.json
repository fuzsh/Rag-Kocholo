        "text": "K1 Speed is proud to offer all-electric indoor go-kart racing in Sacramento! Whether you attend UC Davis or live in the communities of Roseville, Rancho Cordova or Citrus Heights, our indoor karting location is the destination to Golden State capitol, Sutter’s Fort State Historic Park, Golden 1 Center. In addition to our track, our Sacramento location features a museum-quality collection of authentic racing memorabilia, including signed race apparel, full-size racecars, and collectible artwork. When not perusing through our collection, guests can relax in our spacious lobby, purchase food and refreshments at our Paddock Lounge, play video games in-between races, or stay abreast of the on-track action with our plasma screen televisions, which display live telemetry from each race. Our aim is for our guests to have almost as much fun off of the track as they do on. The real reason to visit K1 Speed, however, is the racing. Take everything you know about go-karts and throw it out the window – if you haven’t raced the high-performance electric karts at K1 Speed, you haven’t gone go-kart racing. Our location is open seven days a week and we invite you to come in to K1 Speed Sacramento today! There’s never a bad time to experience indoor go-kart racing!\n\nOne of the best indoor go kart tracks in Northern California!\n\nOur Sacramento indoor karting location is open to everyone, young and old.* We want everyone to be able to experience the thrill and excitement of wheel-to-wheel racing, and at K1 Speed, we pride ourselves on providing a genuine racing experience. In fact, some of our most loyal customers are professional racecar drivers, who visit whenever they can to satiate their adrenaline needs and have some fun behind the wheel. You don’t have to be Ken Block or Juan Pablo Montoya to enjoy a race at K1 Speed, however. In fact, you don’t even need a reservation. Our most popular racing option is our Arrive & Drive racing package, which allows individuals to come in any day of the week, any time of day to test their mettle and skills against up to 11 other drivers in a race against the clock.\n\nThis fun, thrilling event pits up to 12 individuals at a time in a timed race. With equal machinery, the key to victory is not track position, but rather strategy, skill, and consistency. This provides an even playing field as your chances for victory aren’t arbitrarily determined by where you start out in line. To monitor the performance of each racer, every kart is outfitted with advanced data loggers which wirelessly transfer live telemetry to a screen over the track. This allows racers to monitor not only their performance in real time, during the race, but to monitor the performance of their competitors as well! At K1 Speed Sacramento, we treat indoor go-kart racing with the respect it deserves, and understand that karting is the gateway to professional motorsports for many people. At K1 Speed, you’ll be on the right path! And all you have to do is show up.\n\nIn addition to our Arrive & Drive racing package, groups of 9 or more can also reserve race packages for exclusive use of the track and reserved race times. These packages are ideal for special events, private parties, celebrations, corporate events, and more. If you have a group of 9 or more people and are interested in planning one of the following, we encourage you to explore our racing packages.\n\nBirthday Parties\n\nAdult Birthday Parties\n\nBachelor Parties\n\nBar or Bat Mitzvahs\n\nCorporate Events and Planning\n\nTeam Building Exercises\n\nWe can assure you that you will not be disappointed in your experience, nor will your guests! In fact, it will likely be one of the more memorable parties they have attended in quite some time. If you are interested in a private party, we have meeting rooms that will satisfy your needs, and we can arrange catering should you be interested in feeding a large group of people during your event. So what are you waiting for? Stop reading and start racing! Our indoor go-kart racing packages are perfect for nearly any event – contact K1 Speed Sacramento today to arrange a reservation."
