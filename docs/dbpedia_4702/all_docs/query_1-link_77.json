        "text": "Check out K1 Speed’s New Paddock Lounge\n\nWritten By: Kristin Kellams K1 Speed Paddock Lounge\n\nDo you have the need for speed? Most of us OC locals know to head straight to Irvine’s K1 Speed in order to get that adrenaline rush going, but now there’s even more of a reason to make it part of your plans. K1 Speed is now introducing their new Paddock Lounge, which features a sophisticated on-site café that has delicious refueling options for racers of all ages.\n\nThere are also several flat screens in the Lounge so you can tune in to your favorite sports game! “We’ve really upgraded our dining experience with the Paddock Lounge. We were mindful to offer food and beverage selections that satisfied racers across the board in terms of age—from hot dogs and sodas to pulled pork sliders and beer,” Ryan Jurnecka at Irvine’s K1 Speed states. “It certainly doesn’t look like any other karting establishment’s concession stand either. Ours is professional enough from business professionals to kids, and we know visitors have been really impressed by it all!” K1 Speed does have a strict “no drinking, no driving policy,” so for everyone 21 and over, head over to the biergarten-style tables after your race where you can enjoy a wide range of beer and wine that are kept at the perfect temperatures for your convenience.\n\nAside from the new Paddock Lounge area, K1 Speed offers several other forms of entertainment for a small extra cost. To keep the action going, check out the Virtual Reality area. The VR area features two bays that include a variety of different types of games—from ping pong to first-person action games. “With our VR bays and arcade in Irvine, visitors can have an adrenaline-pumping experience without even stepping foot in our go-karts,” says Jurnecka. “And since we have two meeting rooms on site as well, companies and families alike really enjoy going to K1 Speed for their events. When you think about it, K1 Speed really is a great all-around entertainment destination, regardless if you’re a racing fan or not.”\n\nK1 Speed was first established in 2003 in Carlsbad. They introduced the 100 percent electric go-kart, which means that there are no noxious gas fumes that circulate their indoor venue. Also a plus, these karts are faster than the gas-counterparts on acceleration. Over the last 15 years, K1 Speed has been so successful with the general public that they have expanded to over 40 different locations across the globe, 30 of them being in the United States. K1 is also currently constructing their first outdoor go-karting track, called K1 Circuit which will be located in Southern California and features a 1.1-mile track. We can definitely continue to expect great things from this one-of-a-kind company!"
