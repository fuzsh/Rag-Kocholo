        "text": "K1 Speed in Clovis had its soft opening Tuesday in the former space of MB2, which closed in the fall. K1 photo\n\nThe thrill of maximum momentum received the green flag to return to Clovis this week with the opening of K1 Speed, marking the world’s largest indoor go-kart racing operator’s 16th California location.\n\nLocated at Sierra Vista Mall at 1200 Shaw Ave., in Clovis, K1 Speed held its soft opening on Tuesday, filling the void left by MB2 Raceway, which closed its doors permanently in the fall.\n\nK1 Speed Clovis invites adults and teenagers 4-feet, 10-inches or taller to try out their “Superleggero” go-karts, the industry’s fastest go-karts capable of reaching speeds approaching 45 mph. Additionally, children 48 inches or taller can try out junior karts, capable of traveling up to 20 mph.\n\nGo-karts featured at K1 Speed are zero-emission karts that outperform their gas-powered competitors, according to the company’s website. European-style, 100% electric go-karts do not suffer stalls or loss of power in the corners and help to facilitate wheel-to-wheel racing for competitors.\n\nGuests can also enjoy a full arcade featuring games, prize machines, and pool tables, and will soon be able to dine at the Paddock Lounge. The lounge will feature a wide variety of non-alcoholic beverages and will soon offer beer and wine for adults.\n\nK1 Speed Clovis is also home to two private event rooms for meetings, meals and events, inviting guests to schedule their next birthday party, team building exercise or corporate event at the track.\n\nThe largest indoor go-kart racing operator will soon have 73 locations throughout seven countries and 23 states operating under U.S. and international franchise agreements.\n\nRyan and Amy McGuire are the local franchise operators."
