        "text": "CARLSBAD, Calif. (KGTV) - The Carlsbad City Council Tuesday denied a request by the owner of a go-kart race track for a permit to serve alcohol on the premisis.\n\nDavid Danglard, the owner of K1 Speed, had asked the Council for a permit to sell liquor. The Carlsbad location was his first track, and Danglard has 34 others.\n\n10News found a liquor menu on K1's Chicago website, complete with everything from wine and beer to hard liquor.\n\nMany parents were concerned that having alcohol served at the track would change the environment, especially with many kids visiting frequently visiting the location.\n\nDanglard said the two Chicago locations were used as a test pilot for the past four years without any issues. He added no liquor would be served before racing, and drinking and driving would not be allowed. A wristband would be given with a straight message: Don't drink and drive.\n\nThe North Coastal Prevention Coalition fought the proposal, and results from its online survey showed 70 percent of people do not support alcohol at K1.\n\nThe Carlsbad Planning Commission approved the liquor permit 7-2 prior to the City Council rejecting it in a final vote."
