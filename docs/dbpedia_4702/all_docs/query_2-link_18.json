        "text": "Our K1 Speed San Francisco location brings indoor go kart racing to the Bay Area. If you live in Oakland, Berkeley, San Jose, San Mateo, Millbrae, Burlingame or a nearby community, it is a short driving distance from San Francisco International Airport, Golden Gate Bridge, Oyster Point or Marina, making it one of the best indoor event venues.\n\nOur indoor karting location is a state-of-the-art entertainment venue featuring a professionally designed racetrack, spacious lobby with snack bar, extensive collection of authentic racing memorabilia, and meeting rooms perfect for special events or business functions. However, what truly separates K1 Speed apart is our collection of high-performance, zero-emission, environmentally friendly all-electric go-karts. We live in a changing world and we recognize that we must all do our part – our aim is to deliver an authentic, genuine racing atmosphere while maintaining as small a carbon footprint as possible. With our European electric karts, we can do just this. Not only are they more eco-conscious, they offer superior performance to their gas-powered cousins. If you want to experience the thrill of wheel-to-wheel racing action, and become the best go kart racer you can be then try indoor go-kart racing at K1 Speed San Francisco today! Residents from Oakland and the Greater Bay Area are welcome.\n\nOne of the best indoor go kart tracks in Northern California!\n\nOur Arrive & Drive racing program is perfect for both novice and veteran enthusiasts. Competitors hit the track with up to 11 other racers to race for the fastest lap time. The clock never lies and winning the heat requires skill, natural talent, consistency, and sound strategy. Should you try to follow the line of the racer in front of you or should you create a gap in traffic so that you have the track all to yourself? These decisions will impact your on-track performance and your chances at setting a fast lap time. By racing against the clock rather than for position, competitors don’t have to worry about being blocked or having the unlucky fate of being stuck behind a slower driver who just won’t get out of their way!\n\nDuring each race, competitors can monitor their performance in real time, thanks to our live telemetry system. Every time a competitor crosses the start/finish line, his or her lap time and overall position will be displayed on a projection screen. This allows racers to keep track of their lap times, make adjustments on the fly, and gauge their performance in comparison to friends, family members, or strangers. This live data stream makes the race an immersive experience and gives the racer a sense of the stakes at hand. Don’t be surprised if the nerves are tingling at the end of your heat – the feeling of speed and competition can become addictive! If you want to experience this feeling yourself, the Arrive & Drive go-kart racing option at K1 Speed San Francisco is for you. Barring private closures and our monthly Challenge GP events, our Arrive & Drive package is available every day of the year.\n\nFor parties of 9 or more, we recommend reserving one of our many racing packages. This guarantees the party exclusive use of the track during its races and allows friends, family members, or co-workers to race head-to-head against each other for position. Our racing packages are tremendous fun and provide a genuine racing experience. Whether you opt for our Mini Grand Prix – a sprint race that affords no mistakes and requires fast learning – or our Le Mans Endurance event, you’ll walk away with a smile on your face. Our race packages feature qualifying heats, standing-start races for position, and podium ceremonies for the winners, complete with trophies and a photo session. These racing packages are perfect for:\n\nKids Birthday Parties\n\nTeen Birthday Parties\n\nAdult Birthday Parties\n\nBachelor Parties\n\nBar or Bat Mitzvahs\n\nCorporate Events and Planning\n\nTeam Building Exercises\n\nIf you are interested in our race packages, we can also provide you with a range of local catering options as well as meeting room rentals. We want your experience to be pleasant and memorable, and would be happy to tailor your reservation around your specific needs.
