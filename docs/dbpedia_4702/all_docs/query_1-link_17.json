        "text": "All junior racers will need to be at least 48” (4’) tall to race on track. All teen/adult racers will need to be at least 58” (4’10”) to race our larger, faster go-karts.\n\nIMPORTANT: Meeting the height requirement is not a guarantee you’ll be able to race our karts. Drivers will be measured at the location and must be able to safely operate all elements of the kart. Final approval will be at management’s discretion.\n\nHow long is a race at K1 Speed?\n\nArrive & Drive races are up to 12 laps at most K1 Speed locations. Once someone completes 12 laps, the checkered flag will fly for everyone on track. This means some racers may get fewer than 12 laps, but will have the same amount of track time as everyone in their race.\n\nNo, all karts at K1 Speed are single-seaters. If your child is not at least 48”, they will not be able to race on track. We do, however, have a small arcade to keep the little ones entertained.\n\nYou will need to purchase an annual license if you are looking to race at K1 Speed as an Arrive & Drive racer. If you book a party, you and your guests will have the license requirement waived, however you will need to purchase one if you return for Arrive & Drive racing.\n\nThe K1 Speed Annual License is valid for one full year after purchase (e.g. if you purchase your license in March, it will remain active until March the following year). After the license has expired, you will need to purchase an additional one if you want to race, that will last for another 365 days.\n\nIf you don’t know when you last purchased your K1 Speed Annual License, a simple trip to your local K1 Speed is all you need to do. The cashier at the front desk will be able to pull up your information and let you know if your license is still active or expired.\n\nK1 Speed is NOT like bumper cars. Our go-karts are much quicker, more responsive, and more expensive! That’s why we discourage any sort of contact with our karts out on the track. If we find someone intentionally bumping, they may be ejected from the race.\n\nWhile racing has its inherent risks, K1 Speed takes every measure possible to ensure all customers enjoy an authentic racing experience in a safe environment. All go-karts are routinely checked and serviced, our PROTEX barriers are the safest in the industry, and any driver found to not be racing responsibly can either have their go-kart speed decreased remotely by a member of our track staff or can be ejected from competition to ensure the safety of others. Prior to each race, every driver is given a safety briefing that goes over track safety, rules, flag and sign meanings, and kart operation. In addition, each racer is required to wear a current DOT approved helmet with a full-face cover and equipped with a visor or goggles (provided for every racer).\n\nAll drivers must wear closed-toe shoes at K1 Speed. Sandals or any other open-toe shoes are not permitted on track and you will not be able to race. Loose-flowing garments such as dresses should not be worn. We recommend dressing casually in a shirt with pants/shorts. Shoes are required for all guests inside the locations. No bare feet allowed.\n\nIt may be hard for K1 Speed to allow everyone in your group to race together during busier periods, as we will fill any vacant race positions with the next racers in the queue. However, during slower times you may always ask the front desk cashier to see if they can accommodate your request. If you have a group size of 8 or more, we recommend booking an event with us which will provide private racing for your group. Just note, Junior and Adult karts are never mixed on-track.\n\nYes, K1 Speed serves alcohol at most of its locations. However, K1 Speed maintains a strict anti-drinking and driving policy at all of our locations. If you wish to enjoy an alcoholic beverage, you must do so only after you have finished racing for the day – not in-between races. BRINGING IN OUTSIDE ALCOHOL AND/OR DRINKING IN THE PARKING LOT IS STRICTLY FORBIDDEN. If we have reason to believe you are under the influence, you will not be allowed to race on track.\n\nYes, typically all go-karts in a race will be similar in almost every way and are regularly maintained and serviced by our in-house mechanics. There are various power settings, however, so those who are more experienced at K1 Speed may have a slightly higher power setting than those first starting out.\n\nK1RS is K1 Speed’s proprietary scoring system that is used at all of its locations worldwide. The system rewards points based on each racer’s performance and how often that racer races at K1 Speed. Here’s the specific breakdown of points rewarded, based on category:\n\nEvery racer starts at 1200 K1RS points at the beginning of the calendar year and receives points for the following:\n\n2 – points for each race\n\n2 – points for each racer you beat\n\n2 – bonus points if you had the fastest lap in your race\n\n2 – bonus points if you had the fastest lap average in your race\n\nTo check on the current K1RS Points Championship leaderboard, please visit our National Leaderboard.\n\nThe price of a group event is typically slightly higher per person than our Arrive & Drive pricing, but that’s because you receive a VIP experience when you choose to do an event with us. It starts with a reserved time and date, so you don’t need to worry about an excessive wait time – you will start racing precisely at that time you’re scheduled. Your racing is also private for your group – you’re not mixed in with the general public out on track, just you and your buddies!\n\nThen the racing format is different as well. Instead of the time trial-style format that you get with A&D, when you do a group event, you get a miniature pro-race weekend format with a qualifying race, and an actual race where you’re ranked by position on track, not lap time. At the end of the race, we even throw a podium ceremony where the top three receive medals or trophies depending on the package you go with. The Annual License fee is also waived for the day. You really get a lot more for your money with a group event!\n\nAt K1 Speed, we offer both physical Gift Cards shipped out via USPS or e-Gift Cards that can be emailed to you. Just select your preferred method when checking out. e-Gift Cards take up to 24 hours for activation, while physical Gift Cards require 1-3 business days for processing, and up to 5-7 days for shipping.\n\nSince 2003, K1 Speed has made strides to give back to the community through support and in-kind donations to local organizations. To request a donation, please fill out our donation request form. Please keep in mind that submitting a request does not ensure a donation, however we do carefully consider each one. If you are approved for a donation, you will hear from us in time before your event. We recommend submitting donation requests at least one month out from its preferred receipt."
