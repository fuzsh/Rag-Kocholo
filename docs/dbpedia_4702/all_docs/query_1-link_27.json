        "text": "Bring your team to K1 Speed Carlsbad for the most fun corporate team building activities & events near Escondido! Our experience is a unique program that is not found anywhere else. With excitement both on and off the kart track, participants work together to score maximum points for their team and claim the top step on our podium. And without thinking about it, they’ll also gain some valuable team building benefits while having fun.\n\nWhen you arrive at K1 Speed Carlsbad, you’ll split into three even teams (either random or predetermined – your choice). Next, you’ll elect a team captain and create a name for your team that will be used throughout the experience. Thus, instilling unity at the very beginning.\n\nEach experiences includes three unique team building activities designed to improve employee morale, team connectivity, and their overall effectiveness. And while each activity is immensely fun, we do allow you to customize your itinerary for your group. So if you think one activity is benefitting your team more, we can remove one of the other activities and increase your time with your preferred activity.\n\nEvery team member participates in a practice and qualifying race session. The fastest racers in each team will then advance to a main event final race to score as much points for their team as possible.\n\nBENEFITS: Great ice-breaker: promotes communication both on and off track, and boosts morale\n\nThree members from each team competes in a relay challenge that’s unlike anything they’ve ever done before. Each team races around the track with a soccer ball loosely attached to the front of the kart. Because the ball is not secured, it requires plenty of patience and skill to navigate through the circuit without the ball falling off. If the ball falls off the kart, your team will lose valuable time. The team that crosses the finish line first with all three members and their ball wins.\n\nBENEFITS: Promotes focus and concentration, team spirit, communication\n\nFour members from each team participate in this exiting racing-inspired challenge. Each team member is assigned to one wheel/tire on the kart. Each wheel/tire is then removed and exchanged with the team member adjacent to them. They’ll then re-attach that wheel/tire to the kart. The crew that finishes this challenge in the shortest time wins!\n\nBENEFITS: Boosts communication skills, team spirit, and encourages problem solving\n\nAll participants come away from the Ultimate Team Building & Bonding experience with a renewed energy that translates to improved morale, interpersonal skills, and increased effectiveness.\n\nAnd be sure to pick up some physical mementos to take back to the office. Check out our wide selection of stylish t-shirts that are offered to your group at the discounted rate of $19.99 – nearly half-off our retail price! These make attractive gifts that can be worn on your next casual work day to remind everyone of the fun you had with us.\n\nThe entire experience takes a full two hours to complete and is designed for a maximum group size of up to 30 participants. The pricing for our team building is at a flat rate, regardless of group size. Please contact our group sales department today for information about pricing.\n\nSo if you’re looking for a really fun, engaging team building program in Carlsbad, make sure you book it at K1 Speed!
