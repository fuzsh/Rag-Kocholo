        "text": "K1 Speed venue featuring Italian-made go-karts coming to Noblesville\n\nAn elite go-kart facility featuring Italian-made, electric karts is eying a prime Noblesville location.\n\nCalifornia-based K1 Speed, with 18 locations nationwide, is proposing opening the indoor facility in the Saxony development, 14395 Bergan Blvd.\n\nThe building, which is nearly 72,000 square feet, is the former home of Helmer Labs.\n\nA public hearing on the proposal is set for the Aug. 19 Noblesville Plan Commission meeting.\n\nOn its website, the company boasts that its go-karts are “highly advanced with low environmental impact and an absence of noxious exhaust fumes,” due to being electric rather than gas.\n\nThey feature 20-horsepower DC motors that produce more flexibility in twists and turns, the company says. The go-karts can reach high speeds, but the company limits how fast drivers can go to 30 mph with electric sensors.\n\nK1 Speed venues typically feature two tracks that are one-third of a mile long, pit cafes, meeting rooms, pool tables and racing memorabilia for sale.\n\nThe facility caters to both juniors and adults, often booking private parties for companies and their employees.\n\nOnce on the track, drivers can race against the clock, a friend or a stranger. When finished they receive a result sheet that allows them to compare and rank times against other drivers, as well as a chance to go online and compare their times to other racers throughout the month.\n\nCall Star reporter Dana Hunsinger Benbow at (317) 444-6012.
