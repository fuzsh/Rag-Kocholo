No requests will be considered after the February 28th cut off date. We no longer accept sponsorship requests via email due to the threat of viruses and email attachments that cannot be opened. Please send sponsorship requests via mail only. Phone calls will be directed to this website information.\n\nSPONSORSHIP TIPS\n\nKnow more about us than we know about you. Do your homework. Sponsorships are a mix of business and relationship building. This takes effort on your part, as well as time, but showing genuine interest in the company and brand is respected and rewarded. Patience and loyalty to a brand scores HUGE points whether or not you are sponsored this season. There is always next season, and persistence pays off. For example, what if your proposal “knocked it out of the park”, but we didn’t have the budget to move forward with a partnership this year? With sponsorship budgets depending on how well a company does financially the year before resulting in sometimes fewer sponsorships instead of more, the old adage rings true, “Try and Try again.”\n\nCommunication is key -The best way to get on our radar for sponsorship consideration is to communicate with us. Tag us in racing updates, product use photos in your race vehicle or just an occasional shout out via our social media channels like Facebook, Twitter or Instagram. If you haven’t liked any of our social media, go do it now, it’s the best way to stay updated on what is going on at K1 RaceGear."
