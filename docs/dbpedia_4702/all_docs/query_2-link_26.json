        "text": "Our go-kart racing location in Dublin, California is the place for entertainment in the greater East Bay area. Residents of Northern California will find that K1 Speed is much more than a simple go-kart track. Conveniently located near Livermore, Pleasanton, Fremont, and Walnut Creek, K1 Speed Dublin is the ideal destination for your next thing to do, birthday party, corporate function, or team building activity.\n\nWhen not racing on track, competitors can relax in our spacious lobby, or grab a snack or beverage from our Paddock Lounge. We even have a museum-quality collection of authentic racing memorabilia. Make no mistake though – for the best go-kart racing in Dublin, there is no other choice but K1 Speed! Our all-electric karts offer superb performance and our locations are designed to be world-class entertainment venues.\n\nCome in today and see for yourself!\n\nOne of the best indoor go kart tracks in Northern California!\n\nWe offer racers a number of different options to meet their needs. Rest assured, there’s an option that is right for you and your group. These racing options include:\n\nArrive and Drive – One of our most popular race options is our Arrive & Drive package. Come in, any time of day, any day of the week, and take part in a heat with timed laps. With up to 11 other competitors on track at the same time as you, the racing action can become intense!\n\nParty Packages – For groups of 8 or more people, we offer several different party packages. With reserved race times, exclusive use of the track, separate qualifying and standing-start races for position, and a final trophy ceremony for the winners, these packages are great for parties of all kinds!

No reservation is required for Arrive & Drive races, and discounts are available when purchasing multiple races at once!\n\nAt K1 Speed, we pride ourselves on doing things differently. At our Dublin go-kart racing location, you won’t find any used tires or dusty picnic tables, and you won’t be racing on a worn-out and cracked track either. Further more, our karts aren’t powered by tired, old lawn mower engines, and your refreshment options aren’t limited to a broken vending machine in the corner, as is often the case at outdoor tracks. At K1 Speed, we do things differently.\n\nFrom environmentally-friendly electric karts that offer superior performance to gas-powered alternatives to an advanced timing and scoring system that allows you to monitor your performance and lap times in real time, our goal is to provide you with a racing experience like no other. Try K1 Speed and you will forever be hooked! Believe us, our Dublin go-kart racing location will redefine what you come to expect from a go-kart track!"
