No mixed Adult and Junior races.\n\nIMPORTANT: Meeting the height requirement is not a guarantee you’ll be able to race our karts. Drivers will be measured at the location and must be able to safely operate all elements of the kart. Final approval will be at management’s discretion.\n\nThe K1 Speed E-World Championship pits you against the best drivers from K1 Speed locations in the US and internationally for one of the biggest karting prize purses found anywhere on the planet.\n\nOne of our most popular events! Drift Night is for those who either love drifting, want to learn how to drift, or just want to try something new."
