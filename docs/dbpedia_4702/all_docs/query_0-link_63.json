        "text": "K1 Speed\n\nIt’s summertime, a time to relax a little and have some fun. A problem that some of us face during this time is that it sometimes seems choices are limited when it comes to entertainment. Here’s the good news: a brand new experience has made its way to Utah in the form of K1 Speed.\n\nK1 Speed has just opened its doors to the public at their newest location in Sandy. K1 Speed was created to offer enthusiasts and amateurs alike an authentic and genuine racing experience in a safe, comfortable, accessible, and unique environment. Using advanced European electric karts and indoor asphalt tracks, K1 quickly developed a reputation as being fun and exciting, and their growth has been continuous since they first opened the doors of their original location in Carlsbad, California in 2003.\n\n“[We are] the most exciting thing to come to Utah,” says Uli Perez, who has worked for K1 for nine years out of the corporate office in Irvine, California. “We are the place for people with the need for speed.”\n\nIn addition to the “Arrive and Drive” racing option, which allows individuals to visit the indoor karting center anytime and experience the thrill of racing, K1 also offers racing leagues and a variety of packages for corporate events and group parties. In addition to racing, K1 Speed of Sandy also has private meeting rooms, a spacious lounge with video games and leather couches, a fully stocked snack bar, and a large collection of racing memorabilia. It’s hard not to have a good time, on or off the track.\n\nK1 Speed is a world-class entertainment venue that is open to people of all ages. If you have yet to experience what it’s like to race at speeds approaching 45mph, K1 is the perfect place to do so. Come in to K1 Speed at 725 East 10600 South in Sandy today, and see for yourself what all of the hype is about."
