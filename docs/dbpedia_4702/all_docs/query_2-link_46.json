        "text": "Their go-kart racing venue in Dublin, California, is a spot of entertainment in the greater East Bay area. Northern California residents will find that K1 Speed is far more than just a go-kart track. Conveniently located near Livermore, Pleasanton, Fremont and Walnut Creek, K1 Speed Dublin is the perfect destination for your next venture, birthday party, corporate or team building operation.\n\nIf you’re not running on the track, competitors can relax in their spacious lobby or take a snack or a drink from their Paddock Lounge. They also have a museum-quality collection of real racing memorabilia. But don’t make a mistake – there’s no other choice but K1 Speed for the best go-kart race in Dublin. Their all-electric karts offer superb performances, and their locations are designed to be world-class entertainment venues.\n\nThey pride themselves on doing things differently at K1 Speed. At their Dublin go-kart racing spot, you’re not going to find any used tires or dusty picnic tables, and you’re not going to race on a worn-out and broken track either. Furthermore, their karts are not operated by tired, old lawn mower engines, and your refreshment options are not limited to a broken corner vending machine, as is often the case on outdoor tracks. They do things differently at K1 Speed.\n\nFrom environmentally friendly electric karts that provide superior performance to gas-powered alternatives to an innovative timing and scoring system that allows you to track your performance and lap times in real time, their mission is to give you a racing experience like no other. Try K1 Speed and you’re going to be hooked forever. Believe them, their Dublin go-kart racing location will redefine what you’re expecting from a go-kart track.\n\nRacing Packages\n\nThey offer racers a number of different options to meet their needs. Rest assured, there’s an option that is right for you and your group. These racing options include:\n\nArrive and Drive – One of their most popular race options is their Arrive & Drive package. Come in, any time of day, any day of the week, and take part in a heat with timed laps. With up to 11 other competitors on track at the same time as you, the racing action can become intense.\n\nParty Packages – For groups of 8 or more people, they offer several different party packages. These include our Mini Grand Prix, Grand Prix, and Le Mans race package. With reserved race times, exclusive use of the track, separate qualifying and standing-start races for position, and a final trophy ceremony for the winners, these packages are great for birthday parties and other special occasions."
