        "text": "For nearly 20 years, K1 Speed has been famous for its indoor all-electric go kart racing experience. Our state-of-the-art go karts produce zero emissions and are the fastest in the family entertainment space. The adult karts for teens and adults can reach speeds of up to 45 mph, while our junior karts for children 48” or taller can approach 20 mph.\n\nThese karts race on a professionally designed indoor race track that allows for perfect race conditions any day of the year, no matter what the weather is like outside. The track also uses the latest and safest barriers in the industry. They’re much sleeker and absorb contact so much better than those big blocky barriers you find at so many other tracks.\n\nOff-Track Amenities\n\nIn addition to the kart racing experience, visitors to K1 Speed Richmond can enjoy excitement in the gaming area of the venue, which includes rows of video arcade games, pool tables, air hockey, basketball hoops and more.\n\nThose who get hungry from a day of activities can enjoy popular food favorites such as hamburgers, pizzas, wings, pretzel bites and more at the Paddock Lounge located onsite. In addition, the Paddock Lounge serves a wide assortment of non-alcoholic beverages. However, in the near future, we’ll also serve beer & wine for any adults 21 years and older who have finished racing for the day.\n\nRichmond’s Newest Event Venue!\n\nAnd the private event space within K1 Speed can accommodate a whole host of occasions, from birthday parties for kids, teens, and adults to corporate events, retirement parties, team building, bachelor parties, and any other special occasion. The entire facility may even be rented at an hourly rate for groups that desire a private event.\n\n“I’m absolutely delighted that K1 Speed is finally open to the people of Virginia,” says David Danglard, CEO and Founder. “We’re excited to reside in one of the country’s oldest cities, while creating local jobs and giving families in the area a new fun thing to do.”\n\nFor more information including pricing and hours, visit our Richmond location page by hitting the button below!"
