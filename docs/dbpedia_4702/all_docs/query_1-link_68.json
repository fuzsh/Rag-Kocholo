        "text": "SAN DIEGO (KGTV) — Looking to best your high score this summer? Maybe just flex your skills against your date? Or just get out of the sun?\n\nThere's plenty of fun around San Diego at mini-golf courses, laser tag arenas, go-kart tracks, and arcades.\n\nDuring the summer, these spots around town are perfect to escape from the heat or enjoy it a little bit.\n\nHere's where to enjoy some fun entertainment with the family or a date this summer in San Diego:\n\nMini golf\n\nPelly's Mini Golf at Del Mar Golf Center (15555 Jimmy Durante Blvd., Del Mar) Nestle within the Del Mar Golf Center, novices or mini-golf pros can flex their skills at Pelly's Mini Golf. An ocean theme covers the course's 18 holes and all ages are sure to get a kick out of the oceanic design.\n\nTiki Town Adventure Golf (3114 Mission Blvd., Mission Bay): At Belmont Park, take a tiki-inspired excursion over 18 holes at Tiki Town. The course's various degrees of difficulty will keep everyone busy. The course starts off outdoors but takes players out of the sun for some indoor fun on the green.\n\nBoomers! (6999 Clairemont Mesa Blvd, San Diego; 1525 W Vista Way, Vista; and 1155 Graves Ave., El Cajon): Boomers brings together everything you need for a great time: Golf, go-karts, and video games! Boomers' game room has all your favorite, classic arcade games whether you're in a group or flying solo.\n\nLaser tag\n\nUltrazone Laser Tag (3146 Sports Arena Blvd., San Diego): Traverse the Underground City of Ultrazone and find your laser tag knack. The arena's multiple levels let players find their best game any where and players can capture targets throughout to earn points for their team.\n\nLazerblast (3114 Mission Blvd., Mission Bay): Experience a Tron-themed laser tag arena, where two teams of 8 face off in a three-level arena at Lazerblast. Grab your blaster and protect your base while grabbing as many points for your team as possible.\n\nInvasion Laser Tag (1290 W San Marcos Blvd., San Marcos): Invasion Laser Tag offers players the ability to face a \"zombie invasion\" or frenzy of lasers inside their 5,000-square-foot facility and achieve your mission!\n\nGo-karting\n\nSpeed Circuit & Family Fun Center (881 Showroom Pl., Chula Vista): Hit a quarter-mile track in Chula Vista at Speed Circuit, with haripin turns, fast straight-aways, and fun for all skill levels. Race against your friends for the best time and after, explore more fun with a rope course and arcade.\n\nK1 Speed (1709 Main St., San Diego; and 6212 Corte Del Abeto, Carlsbad): Kick it in to overdrive at K1 Speed, where you'll be able to race your friends — or your own time — at speeds up to 45 mph. Their all-electric karts pack a burst of speed on the track and courses provide plenty of tests for drivers.\n\nArcades\n\nNickel City (8990 Miramar Rd., Miramar): Looking for the classic arcade experience? Nickel City keeps it simple, nickels only. There's even an area with free, classic video games.\n\nDave and Buster's (2931 Camino Del Rio N, San Diego; and 2501 El Camino Real, Carlsbad): Dave and Busters brings together beer, and classic and exclusive games. Guests can refill a game card to keep the fun going through the night with hundreds of games.\n\nCoin-Op Game Room (3926 30th St., North Park; and 789 Sixth Ave., San Diego): Local gaming (and beer) fans have two areas to get their arcade fix with Coin-Op, one in the heart of downtown and also in North Park. Enjoy craft beers and cocktails and a range of arcade fun."
