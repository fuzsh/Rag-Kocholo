This landmark announcement coincides with the 20th anniversary of K1 Speed’s first location opening in Carlsbad, California.\n\nPartnership With Successful Italian Karting Chain Delivers Impressive Milestone During K1 Speed’s Historic Anniversary\n\nOver the coming months, Hollywood Kart’s six existing locations in Milan, Rome, Udine, Erba, Catania, and Marcianise will rebrand as K1 Speed locations.

It was truly meant to be!”\n\nFor more information about K1 Speed, visit www.k1speed.com.\n\nFor more information about Hollywood Kart, visit www.hollywoodkart.it.\n\nABOUT K1 SPEED\n\nFounded by David and Susan Danglard in 2003, K1 Speed is the largest indoor electric kart racing brand in the world.
