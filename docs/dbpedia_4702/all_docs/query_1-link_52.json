        "text": "Cars are fascinating for kids of all ages, so it's no wonder that one of Disneyland's hottest attractions remains the decidedly low-tech Autopia – even though those little cars run on a track. Your tweens may be ready for something a little less tame.\n\nK1 Speed\n\n19038 S Vermont Ave\n\nTorrance, CA 90248\n\n(310) 532-2478\n\n17221 Von Karman Ave\n\nIrvine, CA 92614\n\n(949) 250-0242\n\n1000 N. Edward Ct.\n\nAnaheim, CA 92806\n\n(949) 250-3340\n\n5350 East Ontario Mills Pkwy\n\nOntario, CA 91764\n\n(909) 980-0286\n\n6212 Corte Del Abeto\n\nCarlsbad, CA 90211\n\n(760) 929-2225\n\nMore Info\n\nThis is not your generation's go-kart race track. For one thing, its six Southern California tracks are indoors. Another difference is that K1's vehicles are all-electric, which gives them some street-cred with your green conscience.\n\nBefore you go, you should know that one of K1's \"Arrive and Drive\" sessions runs just 10 minutes and costs $20 – but they offer a \"buy two get one free\" deal (three races for $40). Height requirement on adult-size karts is a minimum of 4'10\", but K1 also offers Junior Kart driving for ages 5-13 at its locations in Anaheim, Ontario and Carlsbad.\n\nMB2 Raceway\n\n1475 Lawrence Ave.\n\nThousand Oaks, CA 91320\n\n(805) 214-9999\n\n13943 Balboa Blvd.\n\nSylmar, CA 91342\n\n(866) 966-7223\n\nMore Info\n\nEach of MB2's 60,000 square foot indoor facilities has everything you need to satisfy your inner NASCAR driver.\n\nJunior racers must be at least 48\" tall and must be accompanied by a parent or guardian.\n\nDifferent packages, memberships and pricing structures are indicated on their website. A basic junior race (nine laps) costs $20; adult races (14 laps) are $23. We did see gift cards at Costco that will give you two races for $39.95. Party packages are also offered.\n\nGo Kart World\n\n21830 Recreation Road\n\nCarson, CA 90745\n\n(310) 834-3700\n\nMore Info\n\nSix tracks designed for all levels of drivers, ranging from a kiddy track for very young children (3 years and up) to the third-mile two-story Super Track. They even have a track for bumper cars.\n\nGo Kart World uses both tickets and a wristband system for all-you-can-ride pricing: You can choose to stay for an hour ($25.00) or all day ($50.00) and several options in between.\n\nSpeed Zone\n\n17871 Castleton Street\n\nCity of Industry, CA 91748\n\n(626) 913-9663\n\nMore Info\n\nFour different racing tracks (for drag racing, Grand Prix, a slick track and a turbo track), plus mini-bowling, mini-golf and an arcade. Prices vary; do check out the website first for deals. Speed Zone has given some thought to parents, with free wi-fi and a full-service bar and restaurant (more than pizza and burgers!).\n\nPole Position Raceway – Corona\n\n1594 E. Bentley Dr.\n\nCorona, CA 92879\n\n(951) 817-5032\n\nMore Info\n\nPole Position Raceway – Murrieta\n\n41810 McAlby Ct.\n\nMurrieta, CA 92562\n\n(951) 461-1600\n\nMore Info\n\nTheir website proclaims that they were \"built for racers by racers,\" and that's borne out by the accompanying photos of motor sports notables like Kurt Busch, Jeremy McGrath and Barry Hawk. The Corona operation launched in 2005 and now has four additional tracks (including the second California location in Murrieta).\n\nDrivers must be at least 48\" tall. Parents must sign a release form for all minors to be able to drive.\n\nThe kids' rate for a single race is $16.95, but like many of the other tracks, there are discounts available."
