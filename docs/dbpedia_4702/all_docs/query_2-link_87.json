        "text": "WILMINGTON — For those seeking thrills, a new go-kart racing center has opened in town, promising fun and speed for young and old.\n\nIrvine, California-based K1 Speed opened for business at 40 Fordham Road in Wilmington on Tuesday, the company’s second Massachusetts location after opening in Kingston last year. This is K1’s 30th facility overall, with other locations in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, New York, North Carolina, Texas, Utah and Washington.\n\nK1 training manager Uli Perez, who has been with the company for 10 years and is also a race car driver, said Wilmington’s proximity to Boston made it an attractive location for opening a center.\n\n“It’s pretty much like you’re walking into a museum of go-karting,” Perez said of the business. The building was gutted in the process of building the location, he said, and features two racetracks in a space of over 70,000 square feet. Most K1 locations have only one track, Perez said. It also includes a snack bar, video game arcade and private rooms for parties and corporate functions.\n\nAbout 15 employees have been hired thus far and the company is looking to hire another 10 to 15 people as cashiers, managers, track marshals, mechanics and more.\n\nK1 uses zero-emission electric go-karts that can travel up to 45 miles per hour. Children must be at least four feet tall to drive the karts, and speeds can be controlled or reduced if a driver is going to fast\n\n“We have a remote control that actually regulates the speeds on these go-karts,” Perez said. “We can slow karts down or come to an abrupt stop … Safety is a priority here. That’s why we put you in a helmet, we put you in the go-kart, and we put you in a seat belt.”\n\nResponse to K1 has been positive, Perez said, with customers coming in to ride on Tuesday after the company announced on social media that day the Wilmington location had opened. The company hopes to establish racing leagues at K1 over the next year, Perez said.\n\nRacing packages at K1 range in price from $19.99 to $100.
