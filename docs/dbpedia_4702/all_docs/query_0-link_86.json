        "text": "K1 Speed Carlsbad to host JDM Night the 1st tuesday of every month - our next one is July 6th\n\nBasically open to all JDM car enthusiasts, to come in and for a discounted rate have their own Grand Prix race once a month. This is a 12 lap practice race, a 14 lap qualifer and a 16 lap main event K1 will be awarding the top 3 winners from the main event with trophies, not to mention other prizes that could be awarded if I can get some shops to help sponsor the event.\n\nAt the moment we are pricing it at $50 person (normally $60) for up to 20 people. If we get more than 20 people than I will drop the price down to $45. Those of you reading this probably know of at least 20 people that would be down to do this once a month.\n\nSo post up if you want to participate, we will have Oggies Pizza available for purchase in our deli and if you guys want something else from them we can have that on hand as well (typically we have Nachos and Hot Dogs on the weekends)\n\nlooking forward to seeing everyone out July 6th for round II"
