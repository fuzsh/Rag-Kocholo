        "text": "Go-kart racing company K1 Speed announces the acquisition of Speed Circuit Family Fun Center in Chula Vista, California. Chula Vista becomes the third K1 location in San Diego County.\n\n“We are thrilled to open another location in San Diego County,” said Susan Danglard, co-founder and director of marketing. “We’ve called this area home for over 20 years and it’s an honor to reinvest in the community.”\n\nK1 Speed has renovated the location, including the replacement of gas-powered karts with new, all-electric models. Electric karting has proven to be superior with benefits such as zero emissions and faster acceleration, company officials stated.\n\nIn addition to the new karts, K1 Speed Chula Vista also has a professionally designed track with barriers, two private event spaces and an upcoming arcade. The center’s onsite Paddock Lounge café and two private event rooms make the location well-suited for corporate events, birthday parties and other special occasions, the company noted.\n\nWith the acquisition, K1 Speed now operates 17 locations in California, with nine in Southern California alone, as part of its total of 86 centers currently open or in development around the world.\n\nThe company offers an international franchise and is currently accepting applications."
