        "text": "And given its close proximity to the movie and television industry, K1 Speed Burbank also provides an exciting new location for video shoots and seeks to add to the company's extensive film portfolio that includes ABC's Dancing with the Stars, Nickelodeon's JoJo Siwa, and Flo Rida's music video for the hit single \"Let It Roll\", plus many more.\n\nK1 Speed Burbank features everything racers enjoy at their 45+ locations worldwide. This includes their 100% electric go karts imported from Italy. These zero-emission karts are faster than gas-powered go karts and better for both the environment and guests. Kids can enjoy the exciting speeds of their Junior Karts, while older drivers can get an adrenaline rush in their Adult Karts that approach speeds of up to 45 miles per hour - the fastest in the industry!\n\nThe indoor track is professionally designed to promote overtaking opportunities and presents a challenge to both amateurs and veteran racers alike. Lining the track are Protex karting barriers – the latest and safest barrier system on the market today. These barriers are illuminated with bright and colorful LED lights that transform the traditional go kart racing experience into something new and exciting.\n\nK1 Speed Burbank is not just a go kart racing track, but an indoor entertainment center for the whole family! In addition to racing, families and friends can play in an arcade with the latest and most popular video games. Those looking for more retro entertainment can shoot pool at one of the several billiards tables located off track.\n\nVisitors who need to recharge after a day of fun can appreciate the sophisticated Paddock Lounge café located onsite, that offers delicious food and beverages for all ages.\n\nFor over two decades, K1 Speed has been famous for their enormously fun parties and events – from small birthday parties to massive corporate functions. As such, K1 Speed Burbank has two private event rooms available for rent: the F1 Room and the MotoGP Room. To complete their events, both casual and formal catering options are available.\n\nK1 Speed Burbank is open now seven days a week at 960 Chestnut Street, Burbank, CA 91506.
