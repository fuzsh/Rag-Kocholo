        "text": "K1 Speed, the largest indoor karting facility on the west coast, has opened a brand new state-of-the-art facility in Irvine California. This makes the second track for the company.\n\nOwners Susan and David Danglard's new facility is in a 100,000 square foot complex which includes 80,000 square feet of track space, a 10,000 square foot TV lounge/lobby overlooking the track, a gourmet caf?, game room with pool tables and six conference rooms ranging from 300 square feet to 1,200 square feet. With all of the new equipment and space, K1 is already being touted as one of the area's premier spots for corporate events and entertainment.\n\nThe karts themselves at the K1 Speed facilities are electric Italian Pro Karts that can reach speeds of 40 miles per hour. This gives them better handling, no smog, grease or gas smell like the gas-operated karts. The professionally designed track, coupled with the top-of-the-line karts gives drivers some of the same experiences and challenges real racers feel: over steering, under steering, drifting, even G-Forces.\n\nBefore stepping into the car, K1 Speed's new facility will provide drivers with the same necessary equipment as their current Carlsbad location. Helmets, race gear, safety gear and of course instructions are all supplied by the pit crew to ensure an exhilarating yet safe ride. These karts drive and feel very much like a race car, an attraction that has corporate America as well as individual go kart enthusiasts captivated.\n\nPlease visit K1 Speed via website www.k1speed.com to view photos of this amazing facility and to learn more about the karts, tracks, rates and hours of operation. Group events and corporate functions can be arranged by calling (949) 486-0960."
