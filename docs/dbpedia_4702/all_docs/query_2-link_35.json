All go-karts are routinely checked and serviced, our PROTEX barriers are the safest in the industry, and any driver found to not be racing responsibly can either have their go-kart speed decreased remotely by a member of our track staff or can be ejected from competition to ensure the safety of others.

In addition, each racer is required to wear a current DOT approved helmet with a full-face cover and equipped with a visor or goggles (provided for every racer).\n\nCan I wear my own helmet?\n\nYes, you can wear your own helmet at K1 Speed as long as it is Department of Transportation (DOT) approved with a full-face cover and equipped with a visor or goggles.\n\nWhat clothing should I wear to K1 Speed?\n\nAll drivers must wear closed-toe shoes at K1 Speed.

For more information, please contact our Group Sales department by filling out our Booking Inquiry form.\n\nIs it cheaper to have a group event than doing Arrive & Drive?\n\nThe price of a group event is typically slightly higher per person than our Arrive & Drive pricing, but that’s because you receive a VIP experience when you choose to do an event with us. It starts with a reserved time and date, so you don’t need to worry about an excessive wait time – you will start racing precisely at that time you’re scheduled. Your racing is also private for your group – you’re not mixed in with the general public out on track, just you and your buddies!\n\nThen the racing format is different as well. Instead of the time trial-style format that you get with A&D, when you do a group event, you get a miniature pro-race weekend format with a qualifying race, and an actual race where you’re ranked by position on track, not lap time. At the end of the race, we even throw a podium ceremony where the top three receive medals or trophies depending on the package you go with. The annual membership fee is also waived for the day. You really get a lot more for your money with a group event!\n\nNEWSLETTER SIGN UP\n\nBe the first to know about promotions, specials and events."
