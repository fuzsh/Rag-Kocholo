        "text": "If you’re looking for thrills and excitement, you’re in the right place! At K1 Speed Irvine, the public can enjoy indoor go-kart racing on not one, but two professionally designed tracks. Our Irvine karting center is one of our largest and is a fantastic place to spend a Friday evening with friends or Sunday afternoon with family. Our aim is not limited to building just go-kart tracks; we want to design world-class entertainment venues that everyone can feel comfortable in. Traditional outdoor tracks are often unkempt, there are tires everywhere, the awnings are falling apart, and they smell of gasoline. At K1 Speed, we have plasma screen televisions and leather couches, museum-quality collections of racing memorabilia and art, and our own Pit Café snack bar. We can assure you that K1 Speed will redefine what you think of go-kart tracks, and you will never go back! If you want to experience indoor go-kart racing, the Arrive & Drive package offered at K1 Speed Irvine center is for you! We invite you to come in today; our center is situated within short driving distance of Mission Viejo, Costa Mesa, and Santa Ana."
