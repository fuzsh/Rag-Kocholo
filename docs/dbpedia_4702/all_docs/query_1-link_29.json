        "text": "Anyone remember Malibu Grand Prix? You know, the franchised outdoor racing track that utilized miniature IndyCars? Growing up in Southern California, I experienced its immense popularity first-hand, especially during the 70s and 80s. But where is it now? Can anything come close to that exhilarating experience today? To answer these questions, let’s start at the beginning.\n\nA Malibu investor, Ronald Cameron, started Malibu Grand Prix in 1975 with a single track in Anaheim. For a fee, any licensed driver could pilot specially-made, scaled-down race cars at maximum speeds of 40 mph (later, a much slower model was added for unlicensed drivers). Laps were timed by a computer to 100th of a second, mating the thrill of competition with the excitement of speed.\n\nThe brand exploded across the country. At its peak, Malibu Grand Prix had over 50 locations nationwide. This made it the largest brand of its kind in the FEC marketplace - a remarkable achievement, considering this type of entertainment had never been done before. So, how did they accomplish this?\n\nMalibu Grand Prix was serious about the experience. Their cars were custom-built, three-quarter-scale versions of a grand prix racer. The cars were powered by 28-hp Wankel rotary engines capable of reaching 67 mph on the open road. The brightly colored fiberglass bodies were mounted on tubular-frame chassis and spun-aluminum wheels carried oversized Goodyear racing-slick tires. They had automatic transmissions and quick-ratio steering; brakes were front-wheel disc and rear-wheel drum. The cars were almost impossible to roll over. One of the biggest detriments to the business model was weather dependency - they needed sunshine in order for customers to operate safely and comfortably, especially in colder climates. This resulted in optimal operations for only a few months out of the year.\n\nIn 1977, Warner Communications Inc. bought the company from the founders for $4 million. Later, the company was sold for $19 million and again, to a Canadian businessman who bought the company and later merged it with Castle Entertainment, gaining seven non-racing recreation centers in the process. In the end, the company never reached its former heights.\n\nIn 2002, the company shuttered its doors for good, selling its three remaining locations – Redwood City, California; Norcross, Georgia; and San Antonio, Texas – to Palace Entertainment. Of those, only the Georgia location remains open today, but in name only.\n\nOne year after Malibu Grand Prix’s demise, another American-made racing experience was born - K1 Speed.\n\nEstablished in Carlsbad, California in 2003, K1 Speed took the outside racing concept indoors, and has enjoyed steady, sustained growth for the last 18 years - even during the recession in 2008.\n\nK1 Speed’s all-electric eco-friendly karts reach speeds of up to 45mph. These karts race on a professionally-designed indoor racetrack located within a comfortable temperature-controlled environment. Today, K1 Speed is the world’s largest indoor kart racing operator with over 42+ locations across the globe. These locations offer a unique upscale entertainment concept for casual consumers, racing enthusiasts, and corporate/group events.\n\nK1 Speed’s business model is scalable, unlike any other brand in the industry today. Depending on the demographics and population, the size of the facility and the amenities featured can be adjusted. A K1 Speed location can be a massive multi-track facility with multiple forms of entertainment, or simply a single-track providing kart racing and video games.\n\nEach K1 Speed features high-tech lap timing systems that projects current lap times for interested spectators. And at the end of each race, every racer receives a printout showing a complete breakdown of their lap times and overall racing score. Patrons can log onto our website at any time and view lap times on every race they have ever participated in.\n\nWith Malibu Grand Prix, there was no wheel-to-wheel competition, only time comparisons. At K1 Speed, there’s wheel-to-wheel racing AND time comparisons.\n\nThough our guests are racing against the clock, adrenaline kicks in and head-to-head racing inevitably takes over. The karts’ speed can be electronically controlled, but only for safety reasons, such as in the event of spin-outs or other hazards. Bumping is never tolerated.\n\nTheir Arrive & Drive racing format which allows customers to walk in and race without a reservation has proven to be a big hit for the company. But unlike Malibu Grand Prix, K1 Speed hasn’t stopped there.\n\nK1 Speed has expanded their racing experience with ongoing events like Glo-Karting, drifting nights, racing leagues, and even the first electric kart racing world championship that features international competition from 7 different countries.\n\nK1 Speed has also added and perfected team building events over the last 17 years with refreshingly different bonding exercises like “Pit Stop Challenges” or on-track “Ball Relays”.\n\nK1 Speed never slows down and continues to innovate new and exciting experiences well into the 21st Century. K1 Speed’s customers, like Malibu Grand Prix’s old fanbase, flock to these centers to escape the stresses of life and enjoy adrenaline-filled fun and excitement. Whether you’re racing in our standard karts as a novice or shifter karts as an experienced racer, K1 Speed lets you get away from it all. And the racing appeals to everyone equally - from love-troubled teenagers to businessmen with the blahs. When that green flag drops, and your kart speeds away, you're not thinking about anything else."
