A charming town with a European influence, this “Village by the Sea” is filled with excellent restaurants, diverse shopping centers, historical destinations and world famous attractions. If you’re looking to take a day trip, here’s a sample of some of the fun and educational things you can experience just up the coast.\n\nK1 Speed\n\nAt K1 Speed Carlsbad, all ages can experience the thrill of head-to-head action! Perfect for families, friends and co-workers looking for something fun to do, Arrive & Drive racing allows individuals to come in anytime, without a reservation, and race in our high-performance all-electric karts.\n\nLeo Carrillo Ranch\n\nLeo Carrillo Historic Park, is a historic estate in Carlsbad, California. The rancho was built as a weekend retreat for actor Leo Carrillo (The Cisco Kid), who designed the property in the style of Spanish hacienda estates. If you’re visiting in the spring, the resident peacocks will be displaying their grand feathers in search of a mate. Walk around the beautiful grounds for a quick historical and educational trip.\n\nMuseum of Making Music\n\nWhen you step into the galleries (and back in time) you’ll see outstanding examples of musical instruments, many of them displayed in vintage music store settings. You’ll also hear some familiar tunes in audio and video clips, have many hands-on opportunities to pick up and play a variety of instruments, and discover the innovative ways that the music industry has grown over the years. It’s an insider’s view of the world of making music.\n\nVillage Faire – Restaurants and Shops at Carlsbad Village\n\nWith its New England-style architecture with a Caribbean flare, this enclave of over 36 restaurants, shops and services surrounds a family friendly fountain courtyard, located just a block from the beach and train station.\n\nThere are numerous shops to purchase your beachy California souvenirs. Be sure to visit The Compass restaurant for lunch.\n\nLegoland California is filled with more than 60 kid-powered, kid-tastic rides, shows and attractions all built for fun and geared for families with children between the ages of 2 and 12!
