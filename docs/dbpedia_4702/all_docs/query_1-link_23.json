        "text": "Have you checked out K1 Speed Boston yet? If so, what’s your review?\n\nIf you haven’t visited the gokart facility yet and want to learn more, read the following press release K1 Speed sent to the Wilmington Apple last month:\n\nWILMINGTON, MA – With one indoor karting center already open in the Plymouth-Kingston area, K1 Speed Boston in Wilmington, MA, becomes the company’s second New England location. The largest karting company in the United States, K1 Speed continues to grow. The new Boston facility brings the total number of K1 Speed facilities to just over 30 – and there are more facilities scheduled to open in the near future.\n\nNo More Fitting Town\n\nThe new Boston facility brings K1 Speed to one of America’s most loved and historic cities. Boston, home of such storied franchises as the Red Sox, Celtics, and Bruins, is a sporting town through and through. K1 Speed hopes to tap into this love of sports and introduce novice and veteran racers alike to the thrill of indoor karting.\n\nWhat makes K1 Speed unique is its commitment to all-electric go-karts. Though competitors have followed, K1 Speed is the industry leader and really brought electric karting into the public consciousness. Opening its first center in Carlsbad, CA in 2003, K1 Speed has since expanded its reach throughout the United States and even internationally, to cities as far as Mexico City. Now Boston residents will be able to experience the excitement of indoor karting for themselves.\n\nA Commitment to Excellence, On and Off the Track\n\nRacing at K1 Speed Boston is available in a variety of formats. Large groups of eight or more can book private events and take advantage of unique race packages, while businesses can book corporate packages, such as team building exercises. For the average customer, K1 Speed offers its most popular race option: the Arrive & Drive package. This option is so-named because it allows people to come in any day of the week, any time of day, and sign up for a race without a reservation. Competitors then line up with up to 12 other racers in 14-lap heats against the clock. All racers need to do is show up – K1 takes care of the rest. Simply arrive… and drive.\n\nWhen not racing other competitors around the facility’s indoor track, individuals can take a look at K1 Speed Boston’s extensive collection of authentic racing memorabilia. Video games and pool tables are also available, and racers can relax in leather couches prior to (and after) their races. K1 Speed prides itself on building world-class entertainment venues – not just go-kart tracks. K1 Speed aims to be the benchmark in go-karting, nationwide.\n\nK1 Speed Boston makes it easier than ever for residents of “Beantown” to experience the thrill and excitement of head-to-head, wheel-to-wheel racing action. For those individuals who find the Plymouth-Kingston location to be too far, K1 Speed Boston should quickly become the new go-to place.\n\nLocation Website – https://www.k1speed.com/boston-location.html\n\nAddress – 40 Fordham Rd.
