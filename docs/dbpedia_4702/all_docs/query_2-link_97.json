Battle it out with friends and family and see who can set the fast lap! If you are looking for the perfect introduction to go kart racing in San Diego, K1 Speed in Carlsbad is for you. Their Carlsbad location has been open since 2003 and is the original location of K1 Speed. They were the first to introduce electric indoor karting to the San Diego and Southern California area.\n\nCombining tight, technical corners with a wide front straight and the thrill of electric karts, K1 Speed is the premier go kart racing and indoor karting facility in Carlsbad, North County, and San Diego. Situated approximately 20 miles north of downtown San Diego, their Carlsbad location is in close proximity to a host of other attractions, including Carlsbad State Beach, Palomar airport, and the city of Oceanside, California.\n\nWith indoor go kart racing centers throughout Southern California, K1 Speed is uniquely equipped to help with your next corporate event, team building activity, seminar, product launch, catered function, birthday party, bachelor party, Bar or Bat Mitzvah, or special occasion. For group rates and information, Call 1-888-K1-KARTZ or email Raelyn@K1speed.com.\n\nThey can also accommodate racers any day of the week who want to experience the thrill of indoor karting. Their popular Arrive and Drive allows individuals, be they seasoned pros or novices, to come in any time (except in the event of a private party rental) and feel the rush of adrenaline from our green, eco-friendly electric karts."
