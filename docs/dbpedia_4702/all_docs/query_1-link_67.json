        "text": "Carlsbadâs legacy as a tourist hot spot dates back to the 1880s, when a local farmer tapped into mineral springs and a spa town was born. Todayâthanks to a theme park, golf courses, a nice beach, and moreâCarlsbad has become a popular family destination in San Diego County.\n\nFamily-Friendly Carlsbad\n\nThirty-five miles north of downtown San Diego, Carlsbad offers family-friendly adventure everywhere you look. The biggest presence, no doubt, is LEGOLAND California Resort, which encourages imagination and interactive play for kidsâtypically for ages 2 to 12, but really for anyone who loves those iconic plastic bricks. It features classic theme park rides, a sprawling Star Wars Miniland, a water park, an aquarium, and two themed hotels (the LEGOLAND Hotel and LEGOLAND Castle Hotel). Older kids, meanwhile, may gravitate to nearby attractions like the Alga Norte Community Park (with a lighted skate park for skateboards) or the K1 Speed go-kart track. Come spring, the Flower Fields at Carlsbad Ranch make for a lovely afternoon for all ages, with 50 acres of colorful ranunculus blooms.\n\nOnce here, you can take a break from drivingâthe cityâs all-electric free visitor transportation program will pick you up from a participating lodging property and take you to the areaâs top attractions, such as LEGOLAND, the beach, and Carlsbad Village.\n\nSurf and Skate Culture in Carlsbad\n\nThe city is known for its rich surf culture, stemming from the 1960s, when the sport began to gain popularity along the West Coast. It's the birthplace of the Morey Boogie Board, invented by Tom Morey in 1971, whose innovative approach to wave riding made the activity more accessible. There is also no shortage of renowned surf spots here: breaks at destinations like Tamarack and Terramar, Ponto Jetties and Carlsbad State Beach attract both seasoned surfers and newcomers (when visiting Carlsbad State Beach, be sure to check out The Camp Store, a surfersâ hangout where you can grab a bite and see live music). Early risers should check out First Light Surf Club, an organization that meets up to ride morning waves with a focus on mental health. Local surf shops like Offshore Surf Shop, SurfboardBroker, and Wittâs Carlsbad Pipeline and schools such as SoCal Surf Lessons and Surfin Fire solidify Carlsbad's status as a surferâs haven.\n\nIf you are more of a skater than a surfer, this is a destination as wellâas the hometown of Tony Hawk and Shaun White, Carlsbad has been a skating hotbed since the early days of the sport, and many of the surf shops also cater to skaters. Perfect your half-pipe technique at Carlsbad Skate Park (great for beginners) or the previously mentioned Alga Norte Skate Park.\n\nSpas, Golf, and Camping in Carlsbad\n\nAnd what about those mineral springs? The site where that farmer uncovered the alkaline waters is now the Omni La Costa Resort and Spa. The Spanish Colonialâstyle getaway sits on 400 rolling acres outfitted with 17 tennis courts, eight separate pools, a stunning spa, and two legendary golf courses. A few miles away, the Park Hyatt Aviara has its own golf course (designed by Arnold Palmer) plus a huge spa, fine dining, and a kidsâ club. For a back-to-nature getaway, stay at South Carlsbad State Beach Campgrounds: Tucked among the bluffs, the seaside campsites offer ocean and sunset views.\n\nCarlsbad Shopping and Dining\n\nAlso close to the water, Carlsbad Village has more than 100 unique shops packed within a few walkable blocks. Donât miss State Street, dotted with such trendy boutiques as Humble Olive Oils and on-trend restaurants, like the local ingredients charred to perfection on Campfireâs wood grill or the craft beers at Barrel Republic. If you are looking to splurge and can make reservations in advance, a few blocks away is Jeune et Jolie, where the four-course menu of elevated French cuisine has earned it a coveted Michelin star.\n\nLearn About Coastal Wetlands at a Lagoon\n\nA few miles down the coast, at Agua Hedionda Lagoon, is the Agua Hedionda Lagoon Foundation's Discovery Center, which welcomes visitorsâespecially school-age childrenâto learn about the watershed, conservation, and the local ecosystems. Through hands-on exhibits, gardens, and animal âambassadors,â grown-ups and kids alike will gain a first-hand understanding of the complexities and beauty of this 400-acre body of water, which is one of the threatened coastal wetlands on the Southern California coastline.\n\nThe lagoonâwhich many locals call Carlsbad Lagoonâis also a perfect spot for on-water activities like paddleboarding and kayaking.\n\nCarlsbad Running Events"
