        "text": "Productive Computing, Inc. held its 2013 Company Holiday Party at K1 Speed in Carlsbad, CA. K1 Speed is a popular electric go-kart racing venue featuring an indoor asphalt track. A large entertainment atmosphere is offered at K1 Speed including racing memorabilia, a pit café, pool tables and various games. Professional racecar drivers and celebrities are known to have visited the facility including Boris Said, Tony Hawk, Travis Pastrana, Bam Margera and Ryan Dunn.\n\nRacing events at K1 Speed are designed to promote friendly competition while driving around the tight track at speeds up to 45 miles per hour. The electric go-karts include motors producing 20 HP with maximum torque available immediately. Karts are environmentally friendly, producing zero emissions.\n\nProductive Computing staff had the opportunity to participate in their own exclusive Grand Prix race. PCI’s Grand Prix consisted of 3 races:\n\n12 Lap Practice\n\n14 Lap Qualifying\n\n16 Lap Final Race\n\nCompetition was running high between the staff throughout all three of the runs. Everyone surely enjoyed the adrenaline rush of competing for the top spot. While this experience was familiar for those who had previously participated in K1 kart racing, others were entirely new to the escapade. After each round every driver received a score sheet including specific performance details and placement.\n\nAn awards ceremony was held for all the winners after the final race. The top 3 racers received winning trophies and a podium finish.\n\n1st Place = Keith Larochelle, CFO\n\n2nd Place = Richard Padaon, Product Development Specialist\n\n3rd Place = Marc Larochelle, CEO\n\nIn addition, the top 3 performing PCI staff members (excluding CEO and CFO) were awarded with grand prizes of their own.\n\nThe occasion was surely a fun and memorable experience. Staff camaraderie and morale were boosted during the thrill of friendly competition.\n\nCheck out the action: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Al7ZaMYlfU"
