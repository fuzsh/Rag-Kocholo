        "text": "Racing fans in the Daytona Beach area can race around a smaller track at the new K1 Speed location.\n\nUsing 100% electric go-karts, drivers can hold regular races among their friends, join a league, or participate in special events like Drift Night.\n\nKids taller than 48 inches all the way up to adults are welcome to race at K1 Speed.\n\nIf you want to finally be able to race in Daytona, this might just be your chance! Daytona Beach just got its own K1 Speed indoor go-kart track, and it’s right near to International Speedway, too. This is one of two new Florida locations for K1 Speed. Daytona just opened, and there will be a track opening in West Palm Beach later this year, making for five total locations in the Sunshine State.\n\nRacing at K1 Speed\n\nThe K1 go-karting brand is renowned for its all-electric approach on their Superleggero karts. Their 20 horsepower motors can get you up to 45 mph – the fastest indoor go-karts in the industry.\n\nThe folks at K1 know that their drivers want more than just your basic couple of laps around the track. This is why they offer all sorts of special events throughout the year to keep people coming back for more thrills.\n\nFriday nights are for Glo-Karting, where they turn down the lights and the track barriers light up in neon. They also hold special Drift Nights, where the karts are modified with drift slicks that convert them into a drift-kart. There are also Grid Nights, where drivers try to pass everyone else and stay in the front position for all 12 laps. Then there’s the World Championship, where the top three finishers from different cities can move their way up through state- and national-level rounds, where the international champ will be crowned.\n\nK1 Speed also has leagues for adults, teens, and kids taller than 48 inches. And if you feel like you need some help learning how to get the most out of these electric karts, you can book a one-on-one racing lesson with an instructor.\n\nMore About the Daytona Beach Location\n\nK1 Speed Daytona Beach tries to go above and beyond to provide everyone with a complete entertainment experience. If you and your friends are waiting to join the next race, you can head to the arcade and play air hockey, pool, video games, and prize machines.\n\nTo fuel up your body for your races, there’s the Paddock Lounge restaurant area, or if you want to host a birthday or corporate event, you can book the private event room.\n\nLocated in the Volusia Square shopping center right next to the International Speedway property, K1 Speed Daytona Beach should help you scratch that racing itch, especially when it’s not NASCAR season.\n\nFor more information on hours and pricing, you can visit their website at www.k1speed.com/daytona-location.html.\n\nSOURCE | IMAGES: K1 SPEED"
