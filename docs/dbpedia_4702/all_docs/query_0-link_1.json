        "text": "All races are per-person and are not transferrable. This is not a reservation. You are pre-paying for Arrive and Drive races which are run on a first come, first served basis. If you wish to make a reservation for a group of 8 or more please contact our Group Sales department.\n\nOnline Races are only redeemable at our Carlsbad location and cannot be used at any other location. Races can be immediately redeemed following your online purchase.\n\nIf you do not own a current license and do not purchase a Speedpass, you will need to purchase our annual license (see below). Additional taxes and fees may be applied at the center.\n\nOur posted prices are the cash discount prices available at our location. We still welcome other payment methods online and at our centers, though those transactions will incur a 3.00% non-cash adjustment.\n\n$7.95 License benefits include the following:\n\nFREE BIRTHDAY RACE! (ID required) â€“ a $28.95 Value!\n\nFREE use of our helmets\n\nOne FREE reusable headsock (additional headsocks available for purchase)\n\n10% off apparel & accessories (excludes K1 RaceGear and sale items)\n\nAccess to your racing score online\n\nStoring of your racing history in our database\n\nWeekly newsletter with special offers\n\n**Free Birthday Race may be used within 1 week of your birth date. 1 per customer per calendar year. ID required. Requires a current license and a race package purchase within the previous 365 days. If this is your first-ever visit to a K1 Speed, you can redeem the free birthday race after purchase of our license and a race package.\n\nRaces are also available for purchase at the location. Races may be purchased by an individual for a group, however each PACKAGE is for a SINGLE racer and cannot be shared. Example given: You are shopping for two racers and want to buy them one race each. You will need to buy (2) one-race packages, NOT (1) two-race package with the intention to share. Plus applicable taxes. License is required to race (additional fee paid at center, if applicable). All online sales are final except where prohibited. Any refunds will be in the form of a K1 Speed Gift Card."
