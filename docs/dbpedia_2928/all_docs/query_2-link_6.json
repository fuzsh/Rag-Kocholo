        "text": "The new interlocking ESTW S1 north will be built here by the middle of 2024 prospectively. SPITZKE is implementing everything necessary for the subsequent commissioning of the ESTW from a single source: Our civil engineers, track, mast foundations and overhead lines specialists are all participating. You can read all the information about this important major project in our news.\n\nThe first rail line was rebuilt just months after the floods in Rhineland-Palatinate. The section between Trier and Auw on the Kyll was completed in December, 2021. The second section to St. Thomas was completed by the SPITZKE track team in April, 2022. A special feature of the reconstruction of the Eifel route for rail traffic was the extremely brief planning period.\n\nThis also completed the second stage of the revitalization of the 327 km line between Hannover und Würzburg. In a consortium with DB Bahnbau Gruppe GmbH, the partners only had an 84-day blocking period available (52 days for the track superstructure). SPITZKE was onsite with nearly its complete range of expertise. In September, the load-tamping operations were also successfully carried out and the section is back to regular operation. You can find more information in our project ticker.\n\nFrom March 2021 to September 2023, the Competence Centre West coordinated the work between Leverkusen-Chempark and Leverkusen-Küppersteg and between Leverkusen-Rheindorf and Langenfeld-Berghausen. Support was provided by the Group’s entire overhead line expertise as well as our Leer branch, which carried out the numerous foundations. The main aim of the RRX expansion is to provide more direct connections every 15 minutes between Cologne and Dortmund. You can find all the details about the RRX here.\n\nIn order to make the extension of the Dresdner Bahn between Berlin Suedkreuz and the state border in Lichtenrade a reality, SPITZKE has been working together with JOHANN BUNTE Bauunternehmung GmbH & Co. KG as well as Hentschke Bau GmbH since October 2020. Approximately 5,500 driven-pile foundations and 25,500 meters of sound barriers will be installed, 30,000 meters of track will be renewed, and 21,400 meters of overhead lines will be erected. Completion is scheduled for December 2025. You can find more information in our project ticker.\n\nThe design of the line will enable operating speeds of up to 250 km/​h. The demands on the overhead contact line are high, requiring special solutions and unconditional precision within only small tolerances to a considerable extent. A total of 305 drill foundations for mast and anchor are being installed for the new line and 56. 1 m/​km of chain works are being pulled through SPITZKE.\n\nUnder the leadership of the Large-Scale Projects / Structural Engineering division, three platforms and the pedestrian underpass will be renewed and a new tram underpass will be built in three construction phases up to December 2022. The entire work will be done during constant long-distance railway and suburban railway operation. In May 2020, the first of three stages of the project and the second in May 2022 was completed on time.\n\nSPITZKE is currently building the new train formation facilities in Eidelstedt and Stellingen with four or six tracks and a four-track maintenance facility with a three-track pre-routing group. The main work could already be completed in 2020. Remaining work will follow in 2021. A total of 6 km of conductor rail systems, 15 km of feeder cables and 5 km of return cable were installed for this project.\n\nToday around 24 million passengers p. a. use this connection with the long-distance trains operated by Deutsche Bahn AG. From April to October 2020, the railway infrastructure company SPITZKE revitalized the 99 km long railway track under complete closure. The experts from our areas of expertise track, technology, logistics and equipment/​electrical engineering were on duty. On October 31, the high-speed rail line was put back into operation on schedule.\n\nOn the rail line between Asker and Brakerøya, 29 km of ballast cleaning and track renewal with track and sleeper changes had to be implemented. The work was carried out in record time and was completed on August 3rd, one week ahead of schedule. According to the client Bane NOR, never has a route been renewed so quickly. In addition, a rail line within a tunnel (the Lierasen tunnel) was renewed by using the conveyor belt method for the first time in Norway.\n\nOn the oldest railway line in Baden-Wuerttemberg, more than 2,000 masts are built by our foundation experts, most of them from SPITZKE’s own production subsidiary SPITZKE FAHRWEGSYSTEME GmbH. In December 2022, this major project was completed extremely successfully and on schedule. The first electrified trains will commence regular service after the timetable change. Read all about the electrification of the Suedbahn in our project ticker.\n\nAs soon as the west coast line is in operation, it will direct the wind power generated on the coast to the south of Germany. To carry out the work, we relied on our founding experts for overhead lines located in our branch Leer.\n\nThe work on the single-track steep section required special approvals and safety precautions for all machines and equipment used on the steep section as well as specially trained personnel.\n\nIn the summer of 2017, our specialists renewed the Kystbanen tracks and the S-Bahn line between Valby and Svanemøllen in Denmark. The specialists on site were supported by SPITZKE track-laying machinery, welding, surveying and alignment, and logistics.\n\nThe project covered the entire range of service of the railway infrastructure, from track, equipment/​electrical engineering, buried cabling works and structural engineering to the construction of a new railway platform. In December 2018, the project has been completed."
