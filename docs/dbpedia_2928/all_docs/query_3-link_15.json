        "text": "A self-service concept\n\nVipp guesthouses are a self-service concept offering experiences and essentials. Our rooms are spread out at various locations, so we do not have a reception or a concierge. You won't find a 24-hour lobby, a gym, daily housekeeping, or fitness facilities. Instead, we offer tailored and curated design destinations out of the ordinary, filled with Vipp's take on design. A part of the experience of our destinations is to engage with the interior of our rooms. Every room is equipped with a kitchen just waiting to be used, so when you have done your grocery shopping, start cooking and enjoy.\n\nShould you have questions or need assistance, a member of the Vipp team will be standby during your stay to assist you.\n\nReservations and cancellations\n\nAll bookings at the Vipp guesthouses are non-refundable. If you cannot make it for your booked reservation, we do offer the option of changing the date of your stay according to availability. A second cancellation cannot be refunded or rescheduled.\n\nMethods of payment\n\nFull pre-payment by credit card or bank transfer at the time of reservation. A valid credit card is required to confirm your booking.\n\nCancellation policy\n\nAll pre-paid bookings are non-refundable but it allows the guest to change the date of the booking according to availability. A second cancellation cannot be changed for new dates or refunded.\n\nVacating rooms\n\nRooms should be vacated in the same state and condition as they were at the time of check-in. Vipp obtains the right to demand a refund of any damaged or otherwise compromised interior.\n\nLate check-out can be requested upon reservation and is subject to a late check-out fee of EUR 75,00. Vipp reserves the right to decline requests for late checkout.\n\nChildren\n\nAll rooms in the Vipp guesthouses are for adults over the age of 16 only, no children.\n\nPets\n\nNo pets allowed.\n\nSmoking\n\nVipp guesthouses are smoke-free property (including e-cigarettes), and all guest rooms and public areas are designated as such.
