        "text": "Danish Railways (DSB) recently replaced their ME diesel and EA electric classes with a fleet of Vectrons, designated class EB.\n\n3240, the 1000th Vectron constructed by Siemens, awaits departure from Hoje Taastrup.\n\nMariager-Handest Veteranjernbane (MHVJ): Since 1970 this railfan club operates tourist trains service in the 19 km line linking Mariager with Handest, part of the old Mariager-Fårup-Viborg Jernbane (MFVJ) railway.\n\nHere, a train is ready to depart to Handest, headed by the 2-6-0-T steam locomotive number HV 3, built by Henschel & Sohn of Kassel in 1928 with works number 21258 for the Horsens Vestbaner (HV).\n\nNL DSB ME 1505 met een sleep Bombardier dubbeldeksrijtuigen (Twindexx) vertrekklaar als regionale trein naar Kalundborg vanuit København H (het centraal station).\n\nDe DSB 1500 is ook bekend als klasse ME en is een dieselloc uit de jaren 80. De 1505 is nog getooid in de oude donkerblauwe kleurstelling. Rood is de nieuwe kleur.\n\nBanedanemark, de landelijke spoorbeheerder, heeft grote elektrificatieplannen in Denemarken. Naarmate er meer geëlektrificeerd wordt in Denemarken zullen de klasse ME locomotieven meer verdwijnen ten gunste van nieuwe Vectrons die DSB heeft aangeschaft.\n\nDanish Railways Siemens Vectron No. 3240 at Copenhagen Central Station on the 11.10 service to Helsingør\n\nThis loco was the 1,000th Vectron to roll off Siemens production line and DSB have proudly responded by ordering a special 'wrap' to celebrate this fact.\n\nVectrons are very popular loco's throughout Europe - anybody interested in railway loco's, here is the link to Siemens Vectrons :\n\nrailcolornews.com/2021/11/02/eu-1000-tak-1000-vectrons-si...\n\nThis is an image that could have become reality. In 1981, Danish Railways rented six V200 diesels, which were later returned to their owner Deutsche Bundesbahn. They would have looked good in DSB's black and red house colours, working alongside the similarly -styled NOHAB MX and MY Class locomotives (15-Jan-15).\n\nBase image sourced via Wikipedia as per the following attribution: \"By Juergen.starek (Own work) [GFDL (www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html) or CC BY-SA 3.0 (creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0)], via Wikimedia Commons\".\n\nPlease follow the link below for terms and conditions, additional information about my work; and to request work from me:\n\nwww.flickr.com/photos/northernblue109/6046035749/in/set-7...\n\n\"Sonder Omme\" by Steef van der Straeten. How would a railroad now looked like if it was not closed? That was the thought of Steef van der Straeten when he visited Scandinavia during a holiday. The Danish railway Sonder Omme, TKVJ \"Troldhede - Kolding - Vejen Jernbane\", was closed in 1967. Relying on information from the Danish Railway Museum in Odense Van der Straeten built a railway in the same situation 20 years later.\n\nIn that railway were three stations shared with the DSB. Kolding, Grindsted and Troll Hede. Also included was Sdr. Omme. And there was a connection to a flour mill. Van der Straeten changed that factory into a fertilizer plant because that simply offered more variation in raw materails and goods (bags, containers but also supply chemicals). Also this station had a little goods shed. In his plan, the line was transferred in 1967 to the DSB. So that the industry could expand in the region where the line passes. Episode of the layout is early 80-ies till mid 90-ies.\n\n\"Sonder Omme\" by Steef van der Straeten. How would a railroad now looked like if it was not closed?

This picture is already 18 years old, we were in 1991. Such a photo is now impossible : the ferry line has been replaced by a bridge and a tunneln unfortunately.\n\n1970/09.RD3309. The Railway Enthusiasts' Club based in Farnborough, Hampshire, ran a tour of Denmark between the 19th and 26th September, 1970 and the 'REC' headboard can just be seen adorning the front of Danish State Railways 'E' class compound Pacific 978. Built by Frichs in 1943, the loco is shown here on a railtour based on Copenhagen.\n\nThe first batch of the ‘E’ class were bought from the Swedish Railways in 1936 with a further 25 locos being built for the DSB between 1943 and 1950. Some of them had double chimneys and No. 978 is one of them.\n\nThe photograph, from the Adrian Jarvis collection, is by E.A.S.Cotton and thanks are due to Steen Larsen, Nick Quinn, Kurt Möller, Niels Munch and Helmut Dahlhaus for help in identifying both the locomotive and the location.\n\nCopyright © Adrian Jarvis.\n\nHelsingør, 18th May, 1985. Our ride to København. After an eventful few days in Norway, this was a welcome return to mainland Europe! We'd run out of duty free whisky and were en route to Germany and Switzerland for the next few days! DSB 1521 is about to take us on the next leg of the 1985 marathon!\n\n1970/09.RD3316. This attractive 2-6-4T is Danish State Railways ‘S’ class No. 740 and it is seen here at Elsinor on the 22nd September, 1970. It was working a railtour for the Railway Enthusiasts’ Club of Farnborough, Hampshire, who ran a tour of Denmark between the 19th and 26th September.\n\nIt later came to England and worked on the Nene Valley Railway at Peterborough where it was named ‘Danish Seaways’. Whilst on the Nene Valley it played a starring role in the James Bond film ’Octapussy’ with Roger Moore as the co-star. No. 740 is now preserved back in Denmark.\n\nThe photograph, from the Adrian Jarvis collection, is by E.A.S.Cotton and thanks are due to Steen Larsen, Nick Quinn, Kurt Möller and Helmut Dahlhaus for help in identifying both the locomotive and the location.\n\nCopyright © Adrian Jarvis."
