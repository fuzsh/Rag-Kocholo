        "meta_description": "Harbour side RV park.  Gravel lot (E) for about 20 campers. However, the place is often crowded and you should walk in to look for a free site before buying the ticket. Park before the barrier on the right and walk in to check.  You buy the ticket at a machine in the passage of the black building next to that same parking lot on the right.   You will get a ticket with the code for the barrier.  There are two bathrooms but we used our own.  At the back of the harbor basin (the building with a second floor white balcony) is the second washrooms/showers, with the disposal for the toilet on back side of the building (it's a small room with just an open PVC pipe - there is a short hose for rinsing). Unfortunately, there is no way to dispose of gray water. A harbor card (which you buy at the same ticket machine) is required for the toilet and shower (50 DKK deposit). 3 minutes of showering costs 5 DKK. Access to the toilet or shower costs 3 DKK each time. We understand you can get a refund if you don't use the whole 50DKK. \r\n\r\nThere is a metro station (Svanemollen) about 1km away to go into the city.  \r\n\r\nPrice was 250DKK per night which includes power, water and WiFi.",
