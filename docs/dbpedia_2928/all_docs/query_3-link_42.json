        "text": "This year the Lunar New Year aka Chinese New Year falls on the 25th January and is the year of the rat.\n\nWhen we lived in the UK we would often head up to Chinatown in London to enjoy the amazing spectacle of the celebrations there and tuck into a delicious meal. There isn’t an actual Chinatown here in Copenhagen but today I thought I’d do a round up of some of our favourite Chinese restaurants and places to buy ingredients to create your own Chinese feast plus a fab Chinese interiors shop.\n\nRestaurants\n\nThe Royal Garden at Dronningens Tværgade 30 I believe is the oldest Chinese restaurant in Copenhagen. I took my husband there for his birthday this year and the food was amazing. We particularly enjoyed the sizzling dishes and the banana fritters! Not a cheap option for a meal but worth it.\n\nFu Hao (Colbjørnsensgade 8) is located behind the main station. It is a very unassuming looking place but the dim sum are fantastic. I have written about this place before here.\n\nMagasasa has three locations in the city, Istedgade, Kødbyen and Amagerbrogade. This is another dim sum place which offers other dishes. We enjoyed a meal in the one in Kødbyen. Like Fu Hao above Magasasa is popular with the Chinese community, which to me signals it as a good place to eat!\n\nA new kid on the block is Hidden Dim Sum in the city centre. And also Hot Pot Republic in Vesterbro offers a unique experience and they have some Lunar New Year celebrations {see details here}.\n\nWant to cook at home?\n\nThere are a couple of Chinese/Asian supermarkets worth heading to for ingredients, fresh produce such as pak choi and also frozen dim sum. Den Kinesiske Købmand has a large store on Nørre Voldgade 54 and also a small stand in Torvehallerne. A bit further out in Østerbro (Østerbrogade 115, a short walk from Svanemøllen Station) is the Asien Supermarket.\n\nFor fresh Asian produce (not solely Chinese) there are a number of small grocers behind the main station in Vesterbro and also on Istedgade, as well as other locations in the city. Below are the ones I like.\n\nChina Town Market, Reventlowsgade 24, 1651\n\nKabul Marked, Reventlowsgade 22, 1651\n\nAfghan Market, Reventlowsgade 20, 1651\n\nEveth’s Filipino Food Mart, Reverdilsgade 8 1701\n\nThai Asian Market, Halmtorvet 2, 1700\n\nKakshidi Food Import, Flæsketorvet 42, 1711\n\nThai Supermarket, Isedgade 134, 1650"
