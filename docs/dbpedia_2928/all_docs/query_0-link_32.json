        "text": "Hybrid Model for Proactive Dispatching of Railway Operation under the Consideration of Random Disturbances in Dynamic Circumstances XVII Abstract With the increasing traffic demand and limited infrastructure expansion, railway networks are often operated close to the full capacity, especially in heavily used areas. As a result, the basic timetable is quite susceptible to the operational disturbances, and thereby the propagation and accumulation of delays significantly degrade the service level for customers. To solve this problem, extensive researches have been conducted by focusing on the predefined robust timetables and the real time dispatching algorithm development. However, it has been widely recognized that excessive robust timetables may deteriorate the operating capacity of the railway network and the addition of recovery time and buffer time can be hardly implemented in the congested area. Moreover, most of the conventional dispatching algorithms ignore the further potentia...\n\nThis thesis is concerned with real-time dispatching problems arising in transport and logistics. The main problem considered is the tram dispatch problem in depots of local transport companies. Based on the methods and results obtained for this problem, similar methods are presented for a locomotive dispatching problem in terminal stations and for the ship planning problem in container terminals. In the tram dispatch problem, arriving trams must be stored at a location in the depot and be assigned to a round trip of the next schedule period. For this stack sorting problem, linear and quadratic integer programs for minimizing two objectives are given: the required amount of shunting and the number of type mismatches for the assignment of trams to round trips. Both problems are shown to be NP-hard even for the subproblem in which the assignment of trams to locations is given. The real-world tram dispatch problem is an online problem that must be solved iteratively within a severe time..."
