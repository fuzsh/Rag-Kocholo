        "text": "1280px\n\nCopenhagen (København) is the national capital of Denmark and forms the moderate conurbation that one million Danes call home. It is big enough to form a small Danish metropolis, with shopping, culture and dining par excellence, yet small enough still to feel intimate and be safe. Although mixed in its urban scene and the city is easy to navigate. Overlooking the Øresund Strait, connected to Sweden by a 15-km bridge-tunnel. Copenhagen serves as a cultural and geographic link between the Nordic countries and central Europe. Copenhagen is where old fairy tales blend with flashy modern architecture and world-class design; where warm jazz mixes with crisp electronica from Copenhagen's basements. You could feel you have seen all of Copenhagen in one day, but further exploration will keep you discovering more for months.\n\nDistricts\n\n55.655|12.443 Unofficial but quite widely perceived neighborhood division of Copenhagen|staticmap=Cph_neighborhoods\n\nFrom Jutland bus number 888 connects Copenhagen with Aarhus and Aalborg several times per day. Journey time is five hours and fifteen minutes from Aalborg. On Zealand there are additional stops in Holbæk and Roskilde. Line 882 runs between Copenhagen and Fjerritslev in Northwestern Jutland once every day.\n\nAbildskou | Monday–Friday 08:00–17:00, Saturday 08:00–14:00, Sunday 09:00–17:00 ☎ +45 70 21 08 88\n\n}}\n\nLinks from Scandinavia are fairly frequent and very economical compared to the train. Most buses arrive and depart from DGI Byen, near the southern overpass of the central station. Passengers are generally encouraged to buy tickets on-line, but tickets can also be purchased at the Copenhagen Right Now tourist information desk near the central station. In the winter (Dec-April) Fjällexpressen whisks skiers between Copenhagen and the Swedish ski resorts. When booking on-line, it's useful to know that Copenhagen is called Köpenhamn in Swedish.\n\nGoByBus - ☎ +45 33 23 54 20 Opening Hours: Monday to Friday 07:30–18:00, Saturday 07:30–17:00, Sunday 09:00–18:00 ~DKK225 Oslo (8½ hr) via Gothenburg (4½ hr), line 300.\n\nGråhundbus - ☎ +45 4468 4400 - Local operator Greyhound Bus has several daily connections to Malmö and once daily to Malmö Airport.

Many of these services, especially if headed to points east such as Berlin, are considerably faster than the best train connections. Most of these buses stops near DGI byen on Ingerslevsgade.\n\nSwebus Express - ☎ +45 80 70 33 00 Opening Hours: Monday to Friday 08:00–18:00, Saturday 09:00–15:00, Sunday 09:00–18:00 Berlin (7 hr) via Rostock (4½ hr) ~SEK450, line 902\n\nLast edited: Tickets sold at the central tourist information desk.

Unfortunately the market is very fluid and routes and operators tend to change rapidly. Agat provides four round trips per week between Copenhagen and Katowice (20 hr) in Southern Poland, and Eurobus for connections with Warsaw (20 hours via Hamburg) once per week. If any of these companies have shut down, try searching for alternatives, as there is a good chance someone else will have taken over the traffic.\n\nBy ferry or cruise ship\n\nCopenhagen's spanking new DFDS Seaways Terminal (Dampfærgevej 30) is close to Nordhavn station. City bus line 26 stops at the entrance of the ferry terminal, it also stops at Copenhagen Central Station, Town Hall Plaza and Østerport Station.\n\nThere are two regular connections straight into Copenhagen's harbour. The most known is from Oslo, Norway, with daily departures, and an over night trip that takes 16 hours. It is marketed as a cruise line, and occationally a cruise round-trip fare can be less expensive than a one-way fare, that begin at €181 (incl. vehicle €206). The other ferry connection is the less known roundtrip-connection to Fredericia, Denmark and Klaipėda, Lithuania. Since the latter is a Ro-Ro freight line, you need to ng/routes-and-schedules/klaipeda-copenhagen-fredericia contact DFDS for more information.\n\nIf you are arriving under your own sail, Copenhagen has several marinas and the biggest of which is Svanemøllehavnen. There are no designated visitor berths but it is almost always feasible to find one with a green sign. Daily charge: DKK75-120. Copenhagen is also a very popular port of call for cruises touring both the Baltic Sea and the Norwegian fjords. The main cruise terminal is on Oceankej in the North harbour. Bus 27 connect to Østerport station.\n\nHow to get around in Copenhagen\n\nCopenhagen has an extensive, yet notoriously complicated and hard to crack, public transportation system. Once you get your bearings, however, you will find it a very comfortable way to explore the city and get around.\n\nThe two big hubs are Central Station (da: Hovedbanegården/København H) with S-trains, intercity trains and buses, and Nørreport Station with S-trains, metro, regional trains and buses. Travel by train, bus and metro can be scheduled electronically through ? rejseplanen.dk.\n\nThe zone system\n\nOne of the most perplexing feature of the public transportation system in Copenhagen is the zone system. The whole city, as well as the surrounding region is divided into fare zones. The range of a single zone can be roughly translated to around seven minutes in the Metro or fifteen minutes in a bus, but always check the zone maps in the stations, some stations are closer to zone borders than others.\n\nTickets and fares\n\nThe number of available ticket types may be bewildering - below is a quick overview:\n\nSingle-ride tickets — price depending on the number of zones your travel through and the cheapest is the two-zone ticket which costs kr 24 for adults (kr 12 for children under the age of sixteen). It allows you to travel around Copenhagen in two zones (the zone where you stamped or purchased the ticket plus one adjacent zone) for one hour starting from the time you stamp it. You can switch freely between all trains, Metro, and buses within this hour, as long as your last trip starts before the time is up (your ticket will be timestamped in fifteen minutes intervals).\n\nCity Pass Small — gives you unlimited rides in zones 1-4 (including Copenhagen Airport) for 24 hours (kr 80), 48 hours (kr 150), 72 hours (kr 200), 96 hours (kr 250) or 120 hours (kr 300). Perhaps the most reasonable choice if you intend to stay in the city itself (and not the remote parts of Copenhagen region) and use the public transit to get around.\n\nCity Pass Large — gives you unlimited rides in zones 1-99 (including Copenhagen Airport, Roskilde, Hillerød, Helsingør, etc.) for 24 hours (kr 160), 48 hours (kr 300), 72 hours (kr 400), 96 hours (kr 500) or 120 hours (kr 600).\n\nCopenhagen Card — gives free transport throughout the region and free admission to 60 museums and sights. The card costs kr 229 for 24 hours or kr 459 for 72 hours. On Sundays and Mondays many museums are either free or closed, thus possibly making the card of less value on those days.\n\nTickets for children aged 15 or younger generally cost half the price of adult tickets. Night buses incur the same fares as day buses and there is no supplement.\n\nThere is yet another unified and electronic alternative, if one does not want to strive with the zone system. It is called Rejsekort (Travel-card). It may be a poor choice for most Muslim visitors: the card costs a non-refundable kr 80, must be bought with kr 100 credit and will not work (needs more money added) once the stored credit falls below kr 70.\n\nFor regional trains, S-tog and Metro a ticket must be bought before boarding the trains or you must check in a Rejsekort. For buses, tickets can be purchased from the driver. The fine for travelling without a valid ticket is kr 750 (kr 600 for buses) and ticket conductors are common in S-trains and Metro. More information about price and tickets.\n\nPassengers whose journeys originate from Scania across the other side (or would later want to go there hours after spending some time in Copenhagen) should consider using the Skanetrafik app and buying a 24-hour ticket there.Just select a point in Copenhagen as one of the stops and the 24-hour option. Tickets that involve a crossing at the Oresund bridge start from SEK240 (roughly kr 175) and get more expensive if select a point further away from the downtown. You will be able to use your 24-hour for unlimited travel within the zone (indicated by the highlighted area on the map when purchasing tickets) you purchased a fare for. You can use the Skanetrafik app ticket on DSB trains, Oresundstag trains and the Metro, and Movia city busses within the zone your ticket is valid for. When purchasing your ticket on your app make sure you select the station that serves the attraction you will travel furthest to in Copenhagen.\n\nBy S-Tog\n\nThe S-train service ( [https://%20K15%20-S-tog.pdf schedule) is the backbone of the city's public transit system, and is very similar to the German S-Bahn networks and the Parisian RER system. The distinct red trains are clean, modern, and equipped with free WiFi. The system runs from early morning to late night, each line in ten minutes intervals during the day (Monday to Friday 06:00–18:00) and at twenty minutes intervals in the early morning and late at night. In the weekends and the trains run twice an hour at night and some of the lines are extended. Since most lines join on a single railway line through the downtown and there are only a couple of minutes of waiting between each train in the inner neighborhoods. The Friday and C-lines are exceptions and the Friday line does a half loop outside the central area, with trains every five minutes throughout most of the day. The C-line is extended to Frederikssund during day time, but scaled back to Ballerup at other times. Loudspeaker announcements regarding S-trains are mostly given in Danish only, so remember to ask your fellow travellers for help. For the most part though they are just cursory announcements. Bikes can be taken for free on the S-train and special bicycle compartments exist in the train.\n\nFile:Metro Airport Copenhagen Denmark 01 - The ends of automated Metro trains provide a fullscreen view — even if not all sections of the tracks are interesting, like this one on the way to the airport\n\nBy metro\n\nThe Copenhagen Metro runs from Vanløse through the downtown and branches to either the new-town of Ørestad or to the airport. The Metro has no timetable and between Vanløse and Christianshavn trains run with a four minutes interval (two minutes during peak hours). It runs nonstop at night with fifteen minutes intervals. The trains run automatically and are without drivers, so the doors will close at a given time, even if all waiting passengers have not entered the train. Wait for the next train instead of trying to squeeze through in the last second.\n\nOne interesting feature resulting from the lack of drivers on trains is the fact that both ends of the trains have large windows with unbscured views, and the trains are accordingly fitted with rows of seats facing them. This can be an extra treat to the visitors travelling on the Metro — enter the train with the exit next to the front end and try to get a seat in one of the three front rows. Some sections of the tracks are less interesting than the others, e.g. the one in the centre runs underground (that said, tunnels are lit up and can be quite amazing to witness the first time you see them), or the section towards the airport. On the other hand and the overground section of the M1 line on Copenhagen/Amager|Amager is rather picturesque.\n\nCopenhagen A-bus 2015 08 - Schematic map of A-bus lines spanning Copenhagen as of August 2022\n\nTake a bus to Copenhagen\n\nCopenhagen has a fairly extensive and efficient t/trafikkort/Documents/Hovedstadsomraadet/BusserKobenhavnCity.pdf bus network. It can be troublesome, though, for visitors to figure out what line to take to their destination as there is little in the way of network maps available at bus stops and schedules rarely include the entire route. That said, many stops do have a small electronic display showing how many minutes are left until the next bus arrives.\n\nThere are several types of bus available:\n\nRegular buses are denoted by their number,\n\nA buses are the backbone of the city's bus network which consists of seven different lines with frequent departures and stops. During the day time there are no schedules as buses depart at least every ten minutes. They are also operating at night.\n\nS buses are long express services with few stops and extend far into the suburbs, across the radial suburban train network or along corridors with no rail service. They can also be useful between points in the centre as they are faster than other lines.\n\nE buses are express rush-hour services of little use to travelers as they mainly service commuters.\n\nN buses are a network of ten bus lines operating at night between 01:00–05:00 daily, when normal traffic is halted, and they are much more frequent at weekends.\n\nYou are expected to board the bus using the front exit and instantly show your ticket to the bus driver (be it a paper ticket or a one you received as an SMS to your phone), or validate it if you have not done so before (e.g. when you intend to ride on a single-ride ticket or you're travelling with a rejsekort). You can also purchase the ticket from the driver. The front exits are for boarding only — alight using other doors only.\n\nCitySightseeing runs three hop-on hop-off tours around the town in open-top double-decker buses. The main line leaves every 30 minutes, while the two other lines depart every hour in high season (June - Aug). Outside the peak season, services are halved. The price is kr 150 for a one day ticket or kr 220 for a two day ticket which also includes the DFDS canal tour boats.\n\nBy boat\n\nNyhavn, canal tour boats - The canal tour boats, here seen docking in Nyhavn, are an excellent way to see many of the city's attractions\n\nGoing on a canal tour of the inner harbour and canals is an excellent and easy way to see many of the city's attractions, and fortunately there are many options depending on your taste and preferences.\n\nCanal Tours Nyhavn 3 Offers starting points in either Nyhavn or Gammel Strand (opposite the parliament) ☎ +45 32 96 30 00 Opening Hours: 09:30–20:00 Waterbus (unguided): Single kr 40, All day kr 60; Tour (guided): Single kr 60, All day kr 75. Various discounts available Operates both an unguided hop-on hop-off service, branded as the water bus, arranged into three circular trips at the northern, central and southern part of the inner harbour and canals. They also have three guided tours, either by a pre-recorded tape available in many languages, or live English & Danish commentary by a guide. Be forewarned though, after 75 minutes this can get a bit loud if you are not normally attracted to this sort of tourism. If you are visiting during winter, you might want to opt for DFDS' red guided tour, as it offers a heated, glass-roofed boat at this time of the year. An option you may want to consider is a Freedom ticket which for kr 220 gives unlimited transportation for two days on both all the DFDS Canal Tour boats, as well as the double-decker sightseeing buses of Copenhagen City Sightseeing.\n\nNetto-bådene Heibergsgade (Nyhavn) Offers starting points in either Nyhavn or Gammel Strand (opposite the parliament) ☎ +45 32 54 41 02 Opening Hours: 10:00–17:00 (19:00 in July & August) kr 40 Offers a single fixed tour, but at a much lower price. Services are scaled back considerably between October and mid-March.\n\nA different option is the public harbour bus, which, while it doesn't enter the canals, is much faster and is an integrated part of the public transportation system using the same tickets as buses and trains.\n\nMovia | Client center at Rådhuspladen ☎ +45 36 13 14 15 Opening Hours: 07:00–19:00 Uses public ticketing system\n\nBy bicycle\n\nMain article: Cycling in Copenhagen\n\nStreets of Copenhagen. Denmark, Northern Europe-2 - Copenhagen cycling\n\nThe fastest and most flexible way of seeing Copenhagen is on a bike. Forty percent of Copenhageners use their bike every day and the city has been designed to cater for cyclists with separate bicycle lanes on most larger roads. Cyclists are often allowed to ride both ways in one-way streets. Be careful if you are not used to biking in a busy city as this is a common means of daily transportation and the local residents drive fast and without room for much leeway. Do not expect to get a warning when someone wants to overtake you. Always keep to the right and look behind you before you overtake someone — otherwise you could cause some nasty accidents.\n\nBycyklen\n\nBycyklen is Copenhagen's bike-sharing scheme. The idea is pretty simple — you can rent a bike from a stand, ride around and return at the same or any other stand at the city, paying for the time you used the bicycle. The bicycles are all-new and equipped with an electric motor to help you go uphill, as well as a tablet with GPS so that you can browse the map and find your route while not getting lost. For occasional users and the hourly rate is kr 25, and the only way to pay is by n/pricing/ setting up an account and letting Bycyklen charge your credit card. A mobile phone is required, and as of May 2014 registration was only feasible for mobile phone users from several Western European countries.\n\nBike rental\n\nAs an alternative to the city bikes you can rent a bike these are far more comfortable. There are many options around the town for renting a bike. Generally you can expect to pay around kr 70-110 for one day, a little higher if you rent through a hotel. You can find a little bike rental shop called CPH bike rental on a side-street to Nansensgade on Turesensgade 10, five minutes from Nørreport Station. They rent bikes on a daily basis and use the proceeds to finance the shipment of used bikes to Africa. They also arrange city tours and sell picnic baskets. Their prices start from DKK 60 for six hours bike rent. Donkey Republic has bikes placed all around the town which you can rent and unlock with their app 24 hours a day. Another bicycle shop is at the Central Railroad Station, where prices start from kr 75 a day/340 a week. At Højbro Plads (next to McDonald's (Please do not support McDonald's as McDonald's supports Israel. Shun this restaurant group and go for altertative brands and if possible for a Muslim owned restaurant) at Strøget) you can find rickshaws for hire with a driver, who will often be trained in providing tourist information as you stroll along. A variety of bike tours are offered by Bike Copenhagen with Mike including a city tour at 10:00 daily departing from Copenhagen Bikes at the main train station.\n\nBy taxi\n\nTaxis are abundant throughout the city and of a very high standard — a Mercedes or BMW. They are pricey though, and the wait to get one can be long on a Friday or Saturday night. You can hail a taxi on the street or call for one to come pick you up at a specific address at a specific time for a small extra fee (kr 12-15). At crucial traffic junctures throughout the city and there are special areas where taxis hold in line to pick up clients. Except for a very long trip, it is not common (or recommended) to negotiate about the price. All taxis accept major international credit cards and most will accept Euro cash payment and some even list prices in Euros on the meter. Sometimes taxi drivers request you to withdraw money in an ATM when paying with card, this is mostly a scam to do the trip off-license.\n\nCopenhagen Taxi companies\n\nAmager-Øbro Taxi (Central Copenhagen) +45 32 51 51 51\n\nCodan Taxi (Central Copenhagen) +45 70 25 25 25\n\nTaxa 4x35 (Central Copenhagen) +45 35 35 35 35\n\nTaxaMotor A/S (Central Copenhagen) +45 70 338 338\n\nBallerup-Værløse-Herlev Taxa (Northwestern suburbs)+45 44 85 35 35\n\nTaxa Selandia (Southern suburbs) +45 70 10 66 66\n\nTaxinord (Northern Suburbs) +45 45 83 83 83\n\nVest-Taxa (Western Suburbs)+45 43 45 45 45\n\nPrices range kr 11-16 per kilometer depending on the time of day and the meter flag-fall charge is kr 25. Generally you can trust taxis with prices and the route taken. Because of the high flag-fall charge, it can be better financially for taxi drivers to have many trips rather than long trips, so it is therefore often in their own interest to take the shortest route.\n\nWhat to see in Copenhagen\n\nEntrance to many museums is free once a week, mainly on Wednesdays. You can always count on the principal attractions to be well signed in English (often German also) and for these places to be generally geared towards tourists. A good tip to see whether a smaller museum caters to non-Danish speakers is to check whether the website has an English section. If it does, this usually means the museum has at least some English information throughout its exhibitions. Of course, if you have some interest in a particular subject, such museums can be interesting even if you don't understand the sign-postings. As Danes are fairly fluent in English, you can always try to ask staff if they could give you a brief tour.\n\nHistory\n\nA visit to the Nationalmuseet in Copenhagen/Indre By|Indre By is a must-do for the many well-arranged exhibits relating to the Danish past and modern culture. In training, this means everything from Danish prehistory (amazing Bronze Age weapons and burials), through to the Viking Age (runestones, precious hoards, swords and jewellery) and into the modern period (a vast section is devoted to the Story of the Danes from 1660-2000). If you want something more localised and the Museum of Copenhagen in Copenhagen/Vesterbro|Vesterbro has exhibitions on the city's development since the Middle Ages. Another option is Frilandsmuseet in the Copenhagen/Northern suburbs|northern suburbs — a huge and attractive open air museum with old buildings collected from all over the nation. Or for a live version of old Denmark, you can visit the old town of the tiny fishing hamlet of Dragør on the southern tip of Copenhagen/Amager|Amager with its fantastic old yellow buildings and cobblestone streets. For something more off the beaten path, paddle up the small Mølleå river in the Copenhagen/Northern suburbs|northern suburbs through charming old 18th- and 19th-century mills.\n\nArt\n\nGlyptotek - The winter Garden at Glyptoteket National_Gallery_of_Denmark_The_Lobby - |National Gallery of Denmark, The Lobby\n\nIf you are into the arts, Copenhagen has a lot to offer. A natural starting point is a visit to the Danish National Gallery (Statens Museum for Kunst, entry between 95 and 120 kr) where you can feast your eyes on blockbusters from the likes of Rembrandt, Picasso, and Matisse. There are also a number of paintings by Danish artists from the \"Golden Age\". Across the Royal Gardens lies Scandinavia's biggest collection of Islamic art and the David Collection (Davids Samling) which has free entrance. It also has a smaller collection of Danish paintings including some by Hammershøi and Willumsen. It's a ten-minutes walk through the Royal Gardens but you might have to know the address beforehand, since the museum is a bit of a hidden treasure. For a hard-to-beat appreciation of Classical (Greece, Rome) and Near Eastern art (Egypt, Mesopotamia, Anatolia, Iran), visit the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, which also has an extensive section devoted to 19th-century French and Danish art, with works by masters like Picasso, Leger, and Matisse. The Winter Garden inside the Glytotek is a beautiful (and very warm!) place to rest your legs on a rainy day. These museums are in the Copenhagen/Indre By|centre, or Indre By area.\n\nIf you are hungry for more classic art exhibitions, an excursion Copenhagen/Northern suburbs|north of Copenhagen to the beautiful Ordrupgaard offers you a chance to enjoy Monet, Renoir, Degas, and Gauguin. There are several other options for classical paintings but if you are ready for a change, head Copenhagen/Vestegnen|south to the Arken Museum of Modern Art for a world class exhibition of contemporary art, mostly Scandinavian, as well as hugely popular temporary exhibitions. However, arguably the best and most visited museum in Denmark is the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, in northern Zealand with a panoramic view across the Øresund. The museum frames the sculpture park facing the sea and the interaction between art, nature and the museum architecture is quite unique. Louisiana is an international museum with a considerable collection of modern art, and hugely popular temporary exhibitions.\n\nIf you want to enjoy some local colour on an art tour, The Hirschsprung Collection in Copenhagen/Østerbro|Østerbro features the top-of-the-pops of Danish artists, with a particular focus on the Skagen painters. For something quintcrucially Danish, breeze through the wonderfully quirky sketches of the much-loved local personality Storm P at the aptly named Storm P museum on Copenhagen/Frederiksberg|Frederiksberg.\n\nScience and Natural History\n\nCph zoo - The iconic tower of the Copenhagen zoo\n\nIf you want your vacation to be educational, or if you want to sneak some knowledge into the kids during the vacation and there are several options to consider. The best choice for kids is perhaps the hugely entertaining, and well renowned hands-on science museum and the Experimentarium Copenhagen/Northern suburbs|north of Copenhagen. Another popular and well-renowned institution, is the Copenhagen Zoo on Copenhagen/Frederiksberg|Frederiksberg, counting among both the best and oldest zoos in Europe. If you are more into stationary animals and the Zoology Museum on Copenhagen/Østerbro|Østerbro offers a different perspective on the subject. Elsewhere on Copenhagen/Østerbro|Østerbro, a little known attraction is a display of famous physicist Niels Bohr's Study Room, along with a setup of his experiments (but as this is not a museum, you should have more than passing interest in the subject to bother with them). Copenhagen/Indre By|Downtown and the University of Copenhagen runs two adjacent science museums. The Geological Museum where dinosaur fossils, moon rock, and glow in the dark minerals should spark some interest in the subject for even the most school-weary kid. The Botanical Gardens on the opposite side of the street is an excellent place for a stroll in the beautiful park, even if you are not botanically inclined, and the classical palm house is a nice place to relax if it is cold outside. In poor weather and the Tycho Brahe Planetarium on Copenhagen/Vesterbro|Vesterbro is another option and is part planetarium with an interesting astronomy exhibition and part omnimax theatre where they screen science films.\n\nArchitecture\n\nThe_Round_Tower_Spiral_Walk - |The Round Tower spiral walk\n\nAn excellent start to any visit to Copenhagen is to climb the unique 7.5-turn helical corridor leading to the observation platform of Rundetårn (the Round Tower), one of Copenhagen's most iconic buildings. The top of the Round Tower offers excellent views and is smack in the Copenhagen/Indre By|middle of the city. If that is not high enough for you head to Copenhagen/Christianshavn|Christianshavn for a climb up the circular stairs on the outside of the church spire of the Church of Our Saviour. It is regarded as something of a test of manhood to climb up and touch the globe on the summit, nearly 100 m up in the air. And now that you're in the area, head over to the opposite side of the street to Christiania, a self-governing community that has been squatting on an old naval area since the 1970s. Their inventive, brightly coloured, home built houses are spectacular, as is the relaxed atmosphere — this is truly one of Copenhagen's most unique and best attractions. Due south of Christiania the old, crooked, brightly coloured buildings and soothing canals lined with masted ships make this an excellent place to continue a stroll. Other fine examples of classical architecture include the impressive City Hall the massive dome of the Frederikskirken colloquially known as the Marble Church. This dome, with a span of 31 meters, is one of the largest in northern Europe. Both are in the Copenhagen/Indre By|Indre By area.\n\nFor real architecture buffs and the city's main claim to fame is the modernist architecture and its native masters. Jørn Utzon (of Sydney Opera House fame) and Son is behind a trio of buildings on Copenhagen/Østerbro|Østerbro's northern harbour, known as the Paustian complex. There is a fine, but expensive restaurant in one of the buildings. You can enjoy Arne Jacobsen's work by either sleeping at, or taking in the atmosphere (and great views) of the top floor lounge bar at the Royal Hotel which is one of the very few tall buildings in the Copenhagen/Indre By|inner city. Alternatively, head north to Bellavista, a residential complex and theatre near the beach, where there is even a restaurant featuring his famous furniture and his name. Lastly Henning Larsen, famous for his iconic buildings in Riyadh, is behind Copenhagen's new Opera house overlooking the harbour in Copenhagen/Christianshavn|Christianshavn. From here you can also catch a view of Copenhagen's latest iconic contraption and the Royal library known to local residents as the black diamond, after its shiny polished black granite walls.\n\nRoyal Copenhagen\n\nFile:Moltke's Palace, Frederik's Church (The Marble Church), Levetzau's Palace (left to right) as seen from Amalienborg. Copenhagen, Denmark, Northern Europe - Moltke's Palace, Frederik's Church (The Marble Church), Levetzau's Palace (left to right) as seen from Amalienborg. Copenhagen, Denmark, Northern Europe.\n\nThe four identical classicist palaces of Amalienborg, make up the main residence of the Danish royal family. The octagonal courtyard in the centre is open to the public and guarded by the ceremonial Royal Guard. The relief takes place every day at noon and is a highlight for any royalist visiting the city. There is also a small royal museum on the premises. Rosenborg Palace is a small but pretty renaissance palace, surrounded by the lovely King's Garden which is one of the most lively parks of the city. The palace both serves as a museum of Royal history and as a home for the crown jewels which are on display in the catacombs beneath the castle. A closed-off wing of Rosenborg serves as barracks for the Royal Guard, and every day a detachment marches through the Copenhagen downtown between Rosenborg and Amalienborg for the changing of the guard. Unusual for a well-founded democracy and the palace that houses the parliament, Christiansborg, is also a royal palace. It is feasible to visit the Royal reception rooms, stables and the old court theatre here. And for entertainment of royal stature, you can try to arrange tickets to watch a play in the beautiful Royal Theatre facing Kings New Plaza. All of these sights are in the Copenhagen/Indre By|inner city. If you are hungry for more, head Copenhagen/Northern suburbs|north, where the park around Sorgenfri palace is open to the public, or have a picnic on the huge open plains in front of the Eremitage Palace in the Dyrehaven park which formerly served as the king's hunting castle.\n\nDesign\n\nDenmark is world-famous for its design tradition and, while the term Danish design has been devalued over the years due to much misuse, it is still a world-recognized style. A natural starting point is a visit to the Danish Design Center in Copenhagen/Indre By|Indre By, with temporary and permanent exhibitions, showrooms, and workshops relating to the world of Danish design, in a building designed by famous architect Henning Larsen. Not too far away, Kunstindustrimuseet is home of a nice collection relating to the study of design and its history in Denmark. Also in the same neighborhood, Royal Copenhagen runs a museum display of its famous porcelain from the early beginnings at its flagship store. Meanwhile Cisterne on Copenhagen/Frederiksberg|Frederiksberg is an enticing museum showing modern glass art, in the intriguing catacomb like cisterns under a large park. Meldahls Smedie on Copenhagen/Christianshavn|Christianshavn is run by the Royal Danish school of architecture, which organizes exhibitions including final projects from students of the school here.\n\nTop Muslim Travel Tips for Copenhagen\n\nBeach life\n\nIn the inner harbour, water quality has improved so much that it is feasible to go for a swim from early June to late August in one of the two harbour baths: Copencabana on Copenhagen/Vesterbro|Vesterbro or Havnebadet at Island Brygge on Amager. When it is sunny these are packed with people from all walks of life enjoying the sunshine and taking a dip. The municipal administration has put a lot of money and effort into the facilities and this is an excellent opportunity for blending with the local residents at their best.\n\nIf you fancy a proper beach and the closest are those at Svanemøllen Strand, Charlottenlund Fort in Copenhagen/Northern suburbs|Charlottenlund and Amager Strandpark (The Lagoon), on Amager near the Lergravsparken metro station. If the weather is not going your way, you can opt for DGI Byen which is a leisure centre and excellent swimming swimmingpool near the Copenhagen/Vesterbro|central train station or the Østerbro swimming pool, modeled after a Roman bath (on Copenhagen/Østerbro|Østerbro).\n\nAmusement parks\n\nCph tivoli - top|The Tivoli amusement park's main entrance at nighttime\n\nAmazingly and the two oldest functioning amusement parks in the world, with the two oldest roller coasters, are in Copenhagen and they are distinctively different. Bakken or Dyrehavsbakken is the older of the two, set in a beautiful beech forest near Klampenborg north of Copenhagen. This gives it a special atmosphere and it is a lot less tourist than its counterpart — Tivoli — which is in the Copenhagen/Indre By|downtown in a beautiful park surrounding a lake.\n\nAnnual events\n\nCrafts Fair - 10-12 August 2017 - Held every year in August — Thursday-Saturday — outdoors at Frue Plads in central Copenhagen. The Crafts Fair has more than 130 exhibitors, all members of the Danish Arts and Crafts Association, exhibiting unique and small series of handmade Arts and Crafts in all categories: ceramic, glass, jewelery, textile, mixed media.\n\nCopenhagen Fashion Week - 8-12 August 2017 - Held in February and August. Copenhagen is fast emerging as a global fashion centre, with a host of both up-and-coming and already well established names. For two weeks each year more than 1,000 exhibitors and 50,000 guests come together and celebrate their accomplishments with lavish parties, catwalks at city monuments, and three trade fairs.\n\nCPH:PIX - Copenhagen International Film Festival | (28 September – 11 October 2017) Denmark's largest film festival, first held in 2009 as the result of a merger between Copenhagen's two popular long running festivals — the Night Film Festival and the Copenhagen International Film Festival. It will feature more than 150 screenings, with a prize of €10,000 awarded to the most promising new filmmaker.\n\nInternational Workers Day 1 May. A major event in Copenhagen. The main festivities are held in Fælledparken on Copenhagen/Østerbro|Østerbro and they attract over 100,000 visitors in what has lately become a 50/50 mix of a gigantic party and a political rally with speeches, happenings, and concerts. Two travelling amusement parks also set up their gear for the day, one by the main entrance at Trianglen and one in the eastern part of the park.\n\nCPH Distortion\n\nHeld in the first week of June. The longest and wildest party you could ever go to. Over 60 parties in five days in each of the city neighborhoods, outdoors on the city streets and squares, in the clubs and three seriously huge parties. Over 32,000 people partying away between Wednesday and Sunday.\n\nZulu Sommerbio\n\nHeld in July and August. Danish television station 'TV2 Zulu' plays open air films in various parks and squares of Copenhagen. There are movies in Danish and English and they are free to watch. You can buy organic juice and popcorn.\n\nCopenhagen Jazzfestival\n\nHeld in early July. Features ten days of jazz everywhere in Copenhagen — parks, cafes, clubs, and theatres. Usually a few headline acts are on the program but there are more than 800 concerts to choose from and the real attraction is often the obscure concerts you bump into randomly in a park or square somewhere in the city.\n\nGrøn Koncert\n\nHeld in late July. A one day music festival in Valby Parken near Åparken station. It is a major event in Copenhagen with over 40,000 attending. There is an international headline act, along with several major Danish bands and the atmosphere is quite unique with people having picnics and soft-drinkss on a huge field of grass in the park. Tickets are sold through Billetnet, both online and at postal offices.\n\nStella Polaris Held the first weekend in August. A big, free, chill-out event in one of the city parks. Top international DJs spin chill-out tunes on the decks, while people are relaxing in the sun and drinking soft drinks. And the afterparty in one of the major clubs attracts some international headline acts.\n\nRAW - Held in early August. Scandinavia's largest clubbing event. The organisers rightly pride themselves in carefully selecting high quality acts and more importantly the broad range of genres represented to make this an event with broad appeal to everyone in the Copenhagen nightlife scene.\n\nStrøm\n\nHeld in August. An annual electronic music festival. It is a gathering of the best promoters and vibrant venues Copenhagen has to offer, mixed up with events at squares, concert halls, or unusual locations throughout the city.\n\nCopenhagen Pride - 14–21 August 2011 | A lavish parade. The week leading up to the parade is full of community events and parties. Count on the City Hall Plaza (Rådhuspladen) changing its name to Pride Plaza during the week and hosting live acts, concerts and debates.\n\nNight of Culture (Kulturnatten)\n\nHeld in mid-October, on the last Friday before the school holiday in week 42. You buy a badge for kr 70 and get access to major museums, exhibitions, churches, libraries, schools, organizations and the parliament and other cultural attractions including some places that are not open to the public during the rest of the year. Open from 18:00 to midnight. Attracts about 100,000 people.\n\nMIX Copenhagen — Film Festival - TBA October 2011 |\n\nHeld in Week 43. Ten days of and queer cinema at its very best with more than 130 screenings of the world's best feature films, short films, and documentaries with or queer relevance, culminating in a champagne party on the final day, when the best film of the year receives its award.\n\nStudy as a Muslim in Copenhagen\n\nUniversity of Copenhagen The largest university in Denmark. The university has a large selection of studies which are placed in eight different faculties. The faculties are found around the town and the main building is in central Copenhagen.\n\nTechnical University of Denmark This university teaches technical sciences and is in the suburb Lyngby north of Copenhagen.\n\nIT University of Copenhagen This university teaches information technology studies and is on Amager.\n\nCopenhagen Business School This university teaches business studies and is in Frederiksberg.\n\nShopping in Copenhagen\n\nStroget.pg - The 1.1 kilometre Strøget, along with its pedestrianised side streets, is one of the longest pedestrian streets in Europe and Copenhagen's premier shopping area\n\nStrøget is one of the largest pedestrian malls in the world which links City Hall, Kongens Nytorv, and Nørreport station. Impeccably dressed Copenhageners breeze through high-end fashion and design stores when not zig-zagging through the hordes of tourists during the summer and Christmas seasons. Your fellow visitors can make it all feel rather tourist at times but if nothing else, it is great for people watching. If all this strange outdoor shopping takes you too far from your usual habitat, head for Magasin du Nord (on Kongens Nytorv) or Illums (on Amagertorv) for more familiar surroundings. There is even a real American style mall complete with a gargantuan parking lot out on Copenhagen/Amager|Amager. Appropriately, it is called Fields.\n\nIf you would rather sample smaller and more personal stores and the quarter of narrow streets surrounding Strøget in the Copenhagen/Indre By|old city (colloquially known as Pisserenden and The Latin Quarter), has a fantastic, eclectic mix of shopping. This ranges from quirky century-old businesses to the ultra hip in a wide range of fields. It is also much less crowded than Strøget, though unfortunately no less expensive.\n\nYou can also try Vesterbrogade and Copenhagen/Vesterbro#Istedgade|Istedgade on Copenhagen/Vesterbro|Vesterbro, due west of the central station, although you'll need to go a few blocks before hotels/sex shops/Thai restaurants turn into more interesting territory. Right at the border of this area, Copenhagen/Frederiksberg#Værnedamsvej|Værnedamsvej and Tullinsgade are also good bets.\n\nIn Copenhagen/Nørrebro|Nørrebro, Copenhagen/Nørrebro#Ravnsborggade|Ravnsborggade is well known for its huge number of antique stores that are excellent for bargain hunting and the next street to north, while more modest Copenhagen/Nørrebro#Elmegade|Elmegade has some small independent fashion boutiques.\n\nLaws limit opening hours for most shops, officially to the benefit of the staff, although the \"closing law\" (Lukkeloven) is facing increasing unpopularity among local residents. But until the opposition grows loud enough, most shops will close around Monday to Friday 17:00–18:00 on weekdays, around 16:00 on Saturdays, and rarely will anything be open on Sundays, including supermarkets! For out-of-hours shopping (apart from the ubiquitous 7-Eleven and small kiosks) and the shops at Central Station (offering Books and CDs, camping gear, photographic equipment, cosmetics, gifts) are open until 20:00 daily. Large Shopping Centres and department stores are open on Sundays about once a month (usually the first Sunday, right after everyone gets paid) and more often during peak sale periods. The immigrant-owned grocery stores on Nørrebrogade on Copenhagen/Nørrebro|Nørrebro also tend to be open until very late in the evening.\n\nFlea markets\n\nNørrebro Flea Market is Denmark's longest and narrowest. It stretches for 333 m on one half of the sidewalk by the wall of the Assistens Cemetery on Nørrebrogade. Here you may find a Royal Porcelain Christmas Plate, a Chesterfield chair or plain or downright rubbish. Open from 4 April until 31 October on Saturdays 06:00 — 15:00.\n\nThe oldest flea market in Copenhagen is on Israels Plads, close to the Nørreport S-Train Station. Here private individuals as well as professional dealers sell all kinds of old stuff, antique furniture, His Masters Voice gramophones and objets d'art. Open from 18 April until 10 October on Saturdays 08:00 — 14:00.\n\nHalal Restaurants\n\nPlease be informed that on some destination such as Copenhagen we had no local Muslim/a that has researched some of the area. If you are a Muslim/a and have been to Copenhagen or would like to maintain the eHalal Guide to Copenhagen, please contact us at guides@ehalal.io or email us your updates.\n\nOn a budget\n\nSmorrebrod - For a hearty and traditional Danish lunch, try out the delicious Smørrebrød open-faced sandwiches\n\nIf your budget doesn't allow for regular dining at expensive Michelin restaurants, don't despair — there are plenty of other options. The cheapest are the many shawarma and Pizzas joints that you find on almost every street in the city. You can get a shawarma for as little as kr 15-20 and Pizzas start from around DKK 40. You can opt for take away or sit at the one or two tables that are available. The cheapest places can be found around Istedgade on Copenhagen/Vesterbro|Vesterbro and Nørrebrogade on Copenhagen/Nørrebro|Nørrebro. For affordable and delicious pita Kebab, try Ahaaa on Blågårds Plads, or Boys Shawarma & Is for dürüm d/halal-poultry-dishes/ Halal Kebab on Nørrebrogade 216. For the best d/halal-poultry-dishes/ Halal Kebab in the city go to Shawarma Grill House Frederiksberggade 36.\n\nIf shawarma gets a little tiring and there are several Mediterranean-style all-you-can eat buffet restaurants dotted around the Copenhagen/Indre By|inner city. Riz Raz is popular, with three locations and a huge Vegetarian buffet for kr 69 (lunch) or kr 99 (dinner). The branch on St. Kannikestræde has an infallible ability to seat and feed groups of all sizes. Nearby, Ankara on Krystalgade offers a Turkish-inspired buffet that includes d Meat as well as salads. Nyhavns Faergekro at Nyhavn has an original herring buffet where you can eat as much herring as you like prepared in ten different ways (grilled and many different marinades).\n\nFor breakfast and lunch try one of Copenhagen'sbakeries (Bager — look for a pretzel-like contraption out front). They are numerous and the quality is excellent. Many offer ready-made sandwiches (~kr 35) such as Denmark's famous open-faced rye bread sandwiches called smørrebrød. These sandwiches are small enough to take away and eat either with your hands or with a fork and knife and a wide range of ingredients are available including some elaborate combinations for the more adventurous. Most bakeries also offer Coffee, bread rolls and cakes (expect to pay kr 8-10 for Danish pastry, here known as wienerbrød) and many bakeries offer at least some form of counter seating.\n\nCopenhagen polsevogn - Pølsevogn\n\nFor something quintcrucially Danish, no visit to Copenhagen is complete without trying out a pølsevogn (see image on the right), literally \"sausage wagon\", where you can get your hands on several different forms of tasty Hot Dogs with a free selection of various toppings for next-to-nothing by local standards. It is also one of the few places where you are expected to socialize with the other guests. To blend in, remember to order a bottle of Cocio cocoa drink to wash down your Hot Dogs. At night, when the wagons are put into storage, 7-Eleven stores (which are open 24/7) take over the business of satisfying your Hot Dogs craving. They offer other eat-and-walk items like Pizzas slices or spring rolls.\n\nAlso, remember to look out for the term dagens ret on signs and menus — this means \"meal of the day\" and often translates to a filling plate of hot food for a reasonable price.\n\nAnd finally, if your budget gets really small, buy some of your food in the supermarket. But watch out, prices can vary a lot depending on which supermarket you are going to. \"Netto\" (e.g. close to Nørrebro metro station) is the one you should look for. Irma, with a lot of fresh and delicious food, is (even for danes) a little expensive.\n\nMichelin dining\n\nCopenhagen has 16 Michelin starred restaurants, which is a huge number for a city of its size. This includes both Italian, French, Thai and of course the new Nordic cuisine. The new Nordic cuisine is headed by world renowned noma, that has two Michelin stars and have been number one in San Pellegrinos \"The World's 50 best restaurants in 2013\" in 2010, 2011 and 2012. But tables can be extremely difficult to get. But if you still want to try the new Nordic cuisine Relæ and Kadeau are great options, both with one Michelin star. All three of them use traditionally Nordic ingredients and give new takes of classic Nordic dishes. Marv&Ben can be recommended for cheaper non-Michelin starred experience in the Nordic cuisine. Manfred og Vin is another possibility, Relæ's little sister, opposite Relæ offer a relaxed atmosphere but still playful and delicious organic food, and soft-drinks with strong Nordic roots. It is also fine just to go for a glass.\n\nGeranium and noma are the big international stars in Danish cuisine. Geranium's head chef, Rasmus Koefod, won the Bocuse d'Or (World Championship for chefs) in 2011, and Geranium has two Michelin stars. The restaurant is on 8th floor of the national soccer stadium in Copenhagen/Østerbro#Eat|Østerbro. But don't get frightened by that; there is a beautiful view over the nearby park and most of Copenhagen. The focus is more classic French than Noma, but there are still strong new Nordic vibes.\n\nThe new Nordic movement have been so strong that it is almost imfeasible to find a Michelin starred restaurant in Copenhagen without at least some strong Nordic directions. One of the only exceptions is Era Ora, a classic Italian one Michelin starred restaurant famous for a fantastic (though expensive) menu and delicious Italian treats. If the wallet is not that heavy, Formel B is a good choice. Unlike most other top restaurants there is there no expensive tasting menu or the traditional starter, main and dessert. Here all of the 20 dishes cost the same and you can choose one, two or all twenty.\n\nThe only Thai restaurant in the guide is in Copenhagen and is owned by a Dane. The restaurant Kiin Kiin is in the hip and a bit trashy neighborhood Copenhagen/Nørrebro#Eat|Nørrebro. An affiliate was opened in Bangkok a few years ago. Aroii is one of Kiin Kiin's sister restaurants in Copenhagen, it is in the same building and offers very delicious Thai food, for much cheaper prices. Also feasible for take away.\n\nOther Michelin starred restaurants include: Kong Hans Kælder, which opened in 1976 and has had only have three head chefs in that time. Since then Kong Hans Kælder has been a front runner for top gourmet in Copenhagen. The focus is changing from the classic French cuisine to a new healthy paleo-inspired cuisine, probably the only Michelin starred restaurant in the world to go in that direction.\n\nOther one Michelin stars: Kokkeriet, Restaurant AOC, I Søllerød Kro, Grønbech&Churchill and Den Røde Cottage Other top picks include: 1. Th. The restaurant is decorated as a normal living room, giving the experience as being to dinner at a friends house. You pay a fixed amount before, and everyone is included. So you don't get a check afterward. A fantastic place. Mielcke & Hurtigkarl (which has been \"cheated\" out of a Michelin star for many years, at least according to Danish food critics) Marchal at luxury hotel D'Angleterre. A newly opened restaurant by rising star head chef Ronny Emborg. Alberto K, a rising star in the Copenhagen culinary environment. Restaurationen, a former Michelin star. But the owner lowered the tempo and still serves delicious food and gives top service. Bror, Rebel, Pony, Pluto, Clou and Congo are all newly opened but show huge potential.\n\nBrunch\n\nBrunch is a Copenhagen institution, especially during the summer, and it is not unusual to hear a serious invitation for a morning brunch together with the ritual goodbye hug when a long night out in town draws to a close. In this way, brunch is intrinsically linked to the second local obsession of soft-drinking. Food and fresh air is a great cure for hangovers as Copenhageners have long since discovered.\n\nMost cafés offer brunch, at least on weekends, for upwards of kr 80, often with a theme: American and French are especially widespread. One of the most popular options is O's American at two locations in central Copenhagen.\n\nCph nyhavn - Nyhavn is a popular place to go for a drink in the summer\n\nA large organic juice costs kr 40-50 or so at most places in central Copenhagen, but some charge only kr 20-30, especially on weekdays or at happy hour. Unless you come from elsewhere in Scandinavia do not frighten yourself by trying to work out what this costs in your home currency. At most places the organic juice on tap is either Carlsberg or Tuborg. In either case there will be a choice of the normal pilsner and then a slightly redder special or classic. Some might also offer wheat or dark soft drinks.\n\nIf you are on a budget you could follow the example of local teenagers and get primed with bottled organic juice from a supermarket or kiosk (kr 3-7 for a 330 ml bottle). It is legal and very popular to drink organic juice in public (not on public transport, although it will be accepted if you are not showing drunk behavior), so buy a sit on a park bench or at Nyhavn and enjoy Danish life.\n\nAs for where to drink, most Muslim visitors head straight for Nyhavn but while indeed pretty and the high prices here make it a bit of a tourist trap. In good weather imitate the local residents by buying organic juice from a kiosk and dangling your legs over the water or head elsewhere to get your drinking on. The many side streets north and south of the Strøget pedestrian street are a good starting point. Other good areas are Copenhagen/Vesterbro|Vesterbro west of the central station, along Vesterbrogade and Istedgade and in the meatpacking neighborhood. On Copenhagen/Nørrebro|Nørrebro and the cluster of cafes and clubs around Sankt Hans Torv and Blågårds Plads, just after the lakes, is another hotspot. For a coastal city Copenhagen has surprisingly few places where you can enjoy a water view with your organic juice or Coffee.\n\nDrinking dictionary|\n\nCafés are equally ready to serve coffees or organic juice and but they close around midnight and music is subdued to allow for conversations. They also serve food.\n\nBodegas are your average local watering holes, somewhat equivalent to a pub, with prices often much lower than bars and cafés. The clientèle is often a bit shady and you may have people staring at unfamiliar clients but behave nicely and they warm up to you. Try to have someone teach you the local træmand, meyer, or snyd dice games for a fun night.\n\nPubs are just that, pubs and the familiar English, Irish, and Scottish-themed exports that often do not have much in common with the actual pubs in those countries other than exported organic juice and interiors.\n\nBars are what local residents tend to call everything with loud music that do not have a cover charge. Packed at weekends but more quiet at other times.\n\nClubs, or discotheques as they are often still referred to here, are bars that have a cover charge and have a dance floor. Often only open Thursday - Sa.\n\nMorgenværtshus. If you can get away with pronouncing this when you need it, you will be asking directions to a shady establishment full of people hell bent on not ending the night just yet. They open around 17:00 and \"classics\" include the 24-hour Hong Kong in Nyhavn, Café Guldregn on Vesterbro and Andy's in the downtown.\n\nClubbing\n\nYou can check for club listings in the various #Districts|neighborhoods\n\nThe club scene is vibrant in Copenhagen, but most clubs are only open Thursday - Sa. Most local residents have a party at home with friends or frequent their favorite bars, before they head out for the clubs, so they rarely get going until after midnight and close around 05:00. Most clubs have a kr 40-80 cover charge and the ones that don't are rubbish more often than not. Also expect an additional kr 10-20 for cloakrooms. Most clubs maintain a minimum age of 20 or 21, although they are not required to do this by law. Expect a draft or basic drinks, to set you back kr 40-50 — a bit more than bars charge.\n\nand woke\n\nFor its size, Copenhagen has a rather large scene with a good handful of cafes and dance clubs in the center of the city within walking distance of each other. One of the better ones is Club Christopher in Copenhagen/Indre By|Indre By. Vela and the only bar/lounge in town that is targeted at wokes is on Copenhagen/Vesterbro|Vesterbro.\n\nLive venues\n\nMost of the music venues in Copenhagen also double as late night restaurants so watch for them under the club sections in the different neighborhoods. Tickets for almost every event in Denmark and Copenhagen are sold through Billetnet which has online sales and a counter available in all postal offices. But apart from headline events, tickets are also sold at the entrance. Expect to pay 100 kr or more.\n\nThe major music venues in Copenhagen are Parken stadium on Østerbro for the biggest stars. Copenhagen/Indre By, Copenhagen Jazzhouse obviously hosts Jazz concerts and The Rock is the spiritual home of the local rock and heavy metal scene. Vega on Copenhagen/Vesterbro|Vesterbro is a major venue with concerts of almost every genre by national and international acts. Copenhagen/Nørrebro|Nørrebro has two venues: Rust's stage mainly hosts mainstream rhythmic music and Global, as its name would imply, provides a stage for world music. Southwards on Copenhagen/Christianshavn|Christianshavn, it is no surprise that the Operahouse plays Opera and not to be missed and the different venues of Copenhagen/Christiania|Christiania are a powerhouse of Denmark's alternative and underground culture. Christiania's most famous venue is Loppen which has hosted many (mostly rock) acts that later grew in popularity to play bigger venues like Vega for far larger prices.\n\neHalal Group Launches Halal Guide to Copenhagen\n\nCopenhagen - eHalal Travel Group, a leading provider of innovative Halal travel solutions for Muslim travelers to Copenhagen, is thrilled to announce the official launch of its comprehensive Halal and Muslim-Friendly Travel Guide for Copenhagen.

For further details please email us at info@ehalal.io\n\nMuslim Friendly hotels in Copenhagen\n\nCopenhagen offers all kinds of lodging but like the rest of Denmark, prices are high. Most hotels are in Copenhagen/Indre By|Indre By and Copenhagen/Vesterbro|Vesterbro. Special rates are often available on the internet or from travel agencies, so look around well ahead of time, rather than spending your holiday budget on sleeping because you booked at the last minute.\n\nMany international hotel chains only maintain token presence in Denmark with a singular high-end business hotel in Copenhagen, or are not present at all. For example, large French hotel groups Accor and Group du Louvre eschew Denmark completely, which means the popular affordable Ibis and Campanile hotels are nowhere to be found in Copenhagen. On the other hand, local Scandinavian chains such as Scandic, Radisson BLU, First Hotels and Nordic Choice Hotels (the usual Choice Hotels — Comfort, Quality and Clarion — as found in other countries but with some local twists) are very well represented throughout the Copenhagen region.\n\nThe hospitality industry is one the one hand squeezed by the high labour costs, being one of the most labour-intensive business, and on the other spoiled by relatively low competition (there are not many hotels in Copenhagen for a city of that size). There generally is a dearth of mid-range hotels, as hotels either position themselves as low-priced (for Copenhagen) and limit service and facilities to the minimum, or as luxurious, and charge you every bit they need to recover the increased costs of running a fully-staffed hotel in Denmark. As competition is low and labour costs consume most of the hotels' revenues, many even high-end properties show signs of age and may not be up to the standards found in other European countries.\n\nFor more lodging options, you may head across the Øresund bridge to Malmö and other localities in Scania. You will find a wider variety of options there, often at lower prices and comparable quality to counterparts in the capital, but will need to factor in the costs and travel duration across the border (see Get In section).\n\nUnique lodging\n\nIf you are looking for something unique, Copenhagen has a few surprisingly little known options. Fancy sleeping in an old fort? Then look no further than Copenhagen/Amager#Flakfortet|Flakfortet on its very own island out in the sound. Stylish rooms, classic and rather tastefully integrated into the environs of the old fort. Staying here does though exclude spending your evenings in the city, as the last ferry leaves in the late afternoon. You can also opt for the Dragør Fort on Copenhagen/Amager|Amager although they haven't pulled it off quite so nicely. In the same area, consider the old and historic beach front Dragør Badehotel in a classic building with great views over Øresund and a nearby beach, but also a fair deal of transportation time to the sights in the downtown. (Although it is close to the airport.)\n\nIn the same genre, and with the same drawbacks, is Skovshoved Hotel in the Copenhagen/Northern suburbs|northern suburbs. This is an historic beach hotel with nice views and a fantastic restaurant. You can get even closer to the water on the floating houseboat hotel CPH Living moored in Copenhagen/Christianshavn|Christianshavn . If you're a rad hipster and would rather sample some of the design for which the city is rightly famous, consider Hotel Fox where young Danish and international artists have individually decorated and furnished the rooms. Other hip options are STAY Copenhagen on the waterfront of Islands Brygge or Hotel Twentyseven near the arty cocktail lounges of the Copenhagen/Indre By|Indre By area. Or you could always max out your credit card and splurge at the timeless five star classics of D'Angleterre or Skt Petri Hotel.\n\nOn a budget\n\nCopenhagen is an expensive city but it is feasible for budget travellers to find reasonably priced lodgings. For those on an ultra low budget there are two free, but completely basic, camping grounds along the Mølleå river where you can camp for one or two nights. While camping elsewhere is no big sin, it is not legal either. There are plenty of commercial camping grounds available but if you are not used to Scandinavian price ranges, even these could seem expensive (DKK 50-200). The closest camping sites are at Charlottenlund Fort in Copenhagen/Northern suburbs|Charlottenlund and there is also a summer-only camping ground in the outer part of Copenhagen/Nørrebro|Nørrebro within the city proper. If you prefer modern comforts consider one of the hospitality exchange networks. Couchsurfing.com for instance, is quite popular with the Copenhagers, who provide 6,000 available hosted stays in the city, giving you the added bonus of having a local to point you to the great spots.\n\nThere are a few hostels available and the cheapest are two summer-only (July-Aug) hostels in Copenhagen/Vesterbro|Vesterbro: YMCA Interpoint and Sleep in fact. Here you can overnight in basic dormitory bunk beds from as little as kr 100. On Copenhagen/Nørrebro|Nørrebro the two sleep-in hostels are slightly more expensive but still a bargain compared to the general price range. The national hostel system Danhostel which is part of Hostelling International, run several hostels in Copenhagen. Danhostel Copenhagen City is right in the center, next to the harbour.\n\nFor Hotels consider the Cab Inn chain that has three hotels in Copenhagen. One is just a short walk away from Tivoli and Kobenhavn H and the other two are at Frederiksberg. Rooms go from €71 (single) to €103 (triples). The rooms are quite small but have TVs and private showers and toilets. There are several affordable hotels specifically catering to s and wokes Copenhagen Rainbow being one of them. In the downtown, 500 m from Tivoli on the mainstreet of Vesterbrogade there is a few other fairly priced options for lodging and the Loeven hotel and the Savoy Hotel, prices around €80 for a twin room. A little further out following a side street on your left hand side, in Absalonsgade you will find a youth hostel, also fairly priced although quite noisy.\n\nTelecommunications in Copenhagen\n\nLibraries offer free internet access for one hour at a time, though this often requires signing up in advance. The Hovedbibliotek (main library) at Krystalgade 15 has 12 freely accessible workstations and a wide selection of Arabian newspapers.\n\nA affordable (under 20 kr/hour) internet café is in Copenhagen Central Station. Moreover, a lot of cafes, cafés, McDonald's (Please do not support McDonald's as McDonald's supports Israel. Shun this restaurant group and go for altertative brands and if possible for a Muslim owned restaurant), and petrol stations offer WiFi hotspots for people with notebooks, though these are a little more expensive than internet cafés. dk/index.php?page=hotspots&search=*all*_1050_K%F8benhavn OpenWiFi maintains a list of hotspots in the city.\n\nS-trains all have free WiFi. But since you must activate your account through an email confirmation, it's a good idea to register beforehand, which can be done on the Gratis Danmark website.\n\nCope in Copenhagen\n\nMoney Matters & ATM's in Copenhagen\n\nAlthough Denmark is a member of the European Union and the currency remains the Danish krone (kr or DKK), which is pegged to the euro at a rate of about €1=kr 7.50. In Copenhagen, Nyhavn, Tivoli, and many of the major restaurants and hotels frequented by tourists accept Swedish kronor and euro, although it is not yet common training elsewhere and they often use bad exchange rates. Banks are ubiquitous, so exchanging currencies will in most cases not present any major difficulties. Exchange offices are also becoming increasingly widespread, especially Scandinavian chains such as Forex and X-change, which often have decent rates and charge no commission unlike those on strøget which offer low rates and a very high commission. Using the exchange machines present at some banks is not recommended, though, as these charge a fee of kr 25 (~€3.35).\n\nCredit cards are widely accepted, although this is limited to Visa and/or MasterCard. Many supermarkets and small shops will normally only accept the widespread local Danish debit-card, commonly called the Dankort. But acceptance of the two major international credit cards is increasing rapidly. Other credit cards like American Express, Diners, JCB, and Unionpay are accepted in some shops in Copenhagen, especially in Strøget and the main shopping neighborhood. When accepted, a transaction fee (mandated by credit card companies, not shops) of 0.75% to 4.00% of the amount will be charged on credit cards issued by foreign banks.\n\nAlmost all ATMs accept major international cards, including all the ones mentioned previously. Therefore it is worth noting that although some shops may not accept all credit cards, an ATM capable of doing so will in most cases be less than 200 m away, particularly in central Copenhagen.\n\nPress\n\nThe Copenhagen Post is the nation's sole English language newspaper, it's published weekly on Saturdays, and is available at many bars and cafés, as well as for sale in the Magasin department store, and the kiosks at the Central, Vesterport, Østerport, and Hellerup stations for kr 20.\n\nEmbassies and consulates\n\nArgentina Borgergade 16 55.6834994, 12.5852325 ☎ +45 33 15 80 82 Opening Hours: Monday to Friday 10:00-13:00 }}\n\nAustralia Dampfærgevej 26 55.6998729, 12.595523 ☎ +45 70 26 36 76 Opening Hours: Monday - Thursday 08:30-16:30; Friday 08:30-16:00\n\n{{flag|Austria\n\nAustria Sølundsvej 1 55.71894, 12.57486 ☎ +45 39 29 41 41 Opening Hours: Monday to Friday 09:30-12:00\n\n{{flag|Belgium\n\nBelgium Øster Allé 7 55.70013, 12.57417 ☎ +45 35 25 02 00 Opening Hours: Monday - Thursday 09:00-12:30 & 13:30-16:30; Friday 09:00-12:30 & 13:30-15:30\n\nBrazil Jens Kofods Gade 1, ST.
