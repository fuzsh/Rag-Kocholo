        "text": "May Kenimer Kennon, 87, of Watkinsville passed away after a brief illness on December 5, 2020, with her family by her side. She was born to the late Hershel Montgomery and Carolyn Dell Kenimer, August 16, 1933, in Bishop, Georgia.\n\nMay graduated from Oconee County High School in 1949 at the early age of 15. After high school she attended Georgia State College for Women in Milledgeville, Georgia. She went on to graduate from the University of Georgia in 1953 with a degree in Education. In 1968, May received her Master’s in Education from the same university.\n\nMay began her teaching career in Oconee County where she taught 1st grade for over 30 years. She was an active member of Watkinsville United Methodist Church where she enjoyed the Progressive Sunday School class as well as the Betty Berry Women’s Sunshine Circle.\n\nMay married Oliver Len Kennon Sr. on December 20, 1952 and they lived together all their married life in Oconee County. May and Oliver were active square dancers for over 40 years with several local clubs. They loved to travel and spent many summers touring the lower 48 states, most of the Canadian Providences, as well as two European trips. May’s interest included gardening, cooking as well as attending Georgia basketball and football games. More than anything she enjoyed spending time with her family and many beloved friends.\n\nIn addition to her husband, May is survived by her brother, Edward Dell Kenimer of Watkinsville, two children: Oliver Len Kennon, Jr. of Watkinsville and Terri Kennon Turner (Marshall) of Johns Creek, Georgia. She is also survived by five grandchildren: Mary Kathryn Cheaney (Joe), Carolyn Alexandria Perez (Guillermo), Oliver Len Kennon, III (Sarah), Fred Marshall Turner III, William Montgomery Kennon (Carlie) and three great grandchildren.\n\nThe Kennon family would like to express our sincere gratitude to Dorothy Hardigree for her support and care during May’s illness.\n\nThe family will receive friends prior to the graveside service on Tuesday, December 8, 2020 at 2:00 PM at Oconee Memorial Park, Watkinsville, Georgia with Reverend Emily Whiten officiating. Masks are required for the visitation and the graveside service.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations can be made in May’s memory to the Watkinsville First United Methodist Church-Grace Hall Building Fund, 1331 New High Shoals Rd. Watkinsville, GA 30677."
