They were married in Guernsey County, Ohio (record on file at Cambridge). They had eleven children, all born in Oxford Township, Guernsey County, Ohio. In 1849 John and Sarah Henderson Burnett with their unmarried children moved to Jasper County, Missouri (near Carthage). In 1859, John Burnett died in Jasper County, Missouri; and his widow, Sarah Henderson Burnett took the body back to Guernsey County, Ohio and buried it in the Cemetery of the little church on \"God's Knob,\" on a hill about two miles from the present Quaker City. On December 27, 1859, Sarah Henderson Burnett died in Guernsey County and was buried beside her husband. Their children were as follows:\n\n1.

Asbury Burnett, born September 9, 1841, married Mary Davidson.\n\nThe above information was taken from the George Washington Burnett Family Records, most of which have never been published. The Probate Court of Guernsey County, Ohio, states \"Our records show that John Burnett and Sarah Henderson were married on March 1, 1821, by Basil Israel, J. P.\"\n\nCOPIED FROM AN OLD CHURCH RECORD\n\n\"The Central Christian Church at Quaker City, Guernsey County, Ohio was organized in 1817 at the Knob Meeting House two miles north of Quaker City and was known as the Hopewell Christian Church. William Henderson was one of the charter members. Jesse Jarvis and John Burnett were among the early preachers. In 1860 the congregation moved to town and afterwards was known as Millwood Christian Church.\"\n\nFROM \"BARD FAMILY\", by G. O. Seilhammer, Esq., Kittochtinny Press at Chambersburg, PA, 1908:\n\n\"Robert Baird, the father of the Rev. Dr. Robert Baird, was born in Lancaster County, Pa., Dec. 26, 1756, and died in Fayette County, Pa, in 1835. His childish recollections, we are told, were associated with incidents of the French war, some of the most thrilling acts in the border warfare having occurred not far from the home of his early years. This seems to indicate that he was born in what is now Dauphin County, near Derry Church, where there was a Baird family at a very early period; but nothing has been ascertained to establish the assumption. In those early days the name of Lancaster was often made to embrace a very wide region; and it may be that he was a son of Thomas Baird, who lived on the Falling Spring, in the Cumberland Valley, adjacent to Chambersburg. As a lad, he served in the American arm, in 1776, but was detained by sickness at Amboy while his company participated in the Battle of Long Island. After the Revolution, he settled in Fayette County, PA, at what became New Salem, between Uniontown and Brownsville, where he secured a tract of land containing several hundred acres. He was married Feb. 20, 1781 to Elizabeth Reeves, whose parents were of English and Welsh descent, but natives of Long Island. In his will, he mentions a wife, Sarah, and four sons: Moses, Alexander, Aaron, and Robert, as well as four daughters: Hannah Gallaher, Lydia Miller, Susanna Burnett, and Elizabeth Dearth.\n\nRobert Baird's daughter, Susannah, married Edward Burnett. Following are the Pension claim for Edward for service in the War of 1812, and the widow's pension claim by Edward's second wife, Mary Culley (or McCulley) Burnett, after his death:\n\nWAR OF 1812, DECLARATION OF EDWARD BURNET FOR PENSION\n\nSTATE OF OHIO, COUNTY OF JEFFERSON\n\nOn this 13th day of March, A.

IN Witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand & seal ye day & year above written.\n\nLot Burnat\n\nThe following information is copied from the notes of Mrs. C. L. Sechrest:\n\n\"On September 30, 1727, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, fifty German men and boys above the age of 16, some of them with wives and children, took the oath of allegiance to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the English King. They had come in the ship \"Goodwill\" from Rotterdam, Holland, touching at Portsmouth, England, for fresh supplies; and the captain of the ship was named D. Crockett. There were 200 immigrants on this ship, including women and children; and Professor Rup says that they were all from the Palatine, a little province on the Rhine River. Most of them were of the Mennonite religion.\n\nTwo members of this little band were named Siegrist - Bartholomew and Michael Siegrist. We may venture to guess that they were brothers since they came on the same ship from the same little country; but at this late date, there is little chance of proving it. We do not know whether they were married and brought their wives with them to America, nor do we know whether they lingered in Philadelphia or Germantown before locating permanently in Lancaster County; but we do know that Michael bought a farm of 280 acres from the Penn heirs February 20, 1743. It was located in Hempfield Township. November 8, 1752, Bartholomew Siegrist received letters patent for 301 acres of land in Earl Township, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, from Thomas and Richard Penn. It is recorded in Philadelphia in Patent Book A, Volume 17, Page 187.\n\n(These books of record are now in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.)\n\nHistorians of Pennsylvania point out that it was not unusual for immigrants to build a log cabin on unclaimed land and farm it for years before buying the same. It appears the Penn boys were not very careful business men, lived in England most of the time, and their agents were very careless; so the Siegrist men may have lived in Lancaster County many years before they bought their farms.\n\nWe do not know the age of these men on coming to America, but we do know by the probating of their wills that Michael died in April, 1752; and Bartholomew's will was probated December 6, 1763, so he probably died in November, 1763. Pioneering was a hard life; and I think both men died comparatively young and that each left a number of children. Both men left wills, though neither of them named all of his children in his will. It was the pernicious custom of that day to name all the boys in the family first, then the girls; so the order is never dependable unless the ages were obtained and the names arranged chronologically.\n\nGirls were little esteemed and almost never willed land; but since the custom of willing the land to the boys was almost universal, it amounted to the same thing - if the girls married.\"\n\nFAMILY OF BARTHOLOMEW SIEGRIST\n\nThe following information is take from the notes of Mrs. C. L. Sechrest:\n\n\"Since the mother of the human family was Eve, it is very fitting that the mother of 25,000 Secrests in America should also be Eve, the wife of Bartholomew. He died in 1768, but his wife lived until December, 1792; and both left wills. From them we reconstruct the family as follows:\n\n1. John Siegrist, died before 1768\n\n2. Bartholomew Siegrist, Jr., died Feb 1778\n\n3. Lorentz Siegrist, b. Jan 15, 1731, died May 18, 1825\n\n4. Solomon Siegrist, died Dec 6, 1781\n\n5. Barbara Siegrist, wife of Michael Zug\n\n6. Eve Siegrist, died young\n\n7. Susannah Siegrist, wife of John Huber.\n\nBartholomew, Sr. reared his family on a farm of 301 acres in Earl Township, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. On dying, in 1768 he willed the home farm to Lorentz and Solomon. In 1774, Lorentz and wife sold their part of the farm to Solomon; and on April 14 of the same year, he bought a farm of 253 acres in Lebanon Township (now Lebanon County) of Caspar Diller, Jr. and his wife. Lorentz and wife went to live on this farm near the present village of Annville, Pennsylvania.\n\nOf John Siegrist little is known except that he married and died before his father, leaving two sons: John and Solomon. Rebecca Slaymaker, now deceased wrote that \"Barth Siegrist took out warrant for 200 acres of land May 24, 1744. John Siegrist took out warrant for 100 acres of land Jan 11, 1744, and 150 acres Nov 13, 1745.\" I was not able to verify this statement and locate the land - overlooked it, I suppose. But assuming it is correct, this 250 acres must have been given to Solomon II, for John, Jr. (his brother) bought 300 acres in Lebanon Township (Lebanon County) in 1767 and 64 acres in the same Township in 1768. Eve mentions these grandsons in her will, but says that she provided for them during her lifetime.\n\nOn dying in 1792, Eve willed her estate to her only living son, Lorentz; her daughter, Susannah, and her granddaughter, Catherine, daughter of Bartholomew, Jr. The fact that Eve does no mention her deficient daughter, Eve, in her will leads me to think that the girl had died after the death of her father in 1768 and before the first census was taken in 1790; for at that date, old Eve was living alone in Warwick Township, Lancaster County, and was known as \"Widow Siegrist.\"\n\nThe daughter, Barbara, married Michael Zug, a man who probably came over with her father on the same ship in 1727. They must have located in Cumberland County, Pennsylvania; for when Bartholomew, Jr. made his will in July, 1777, Michael Zug was one of the witnesses.\n\nSusannah was not married when her father died in 1768; but she must have married later, for she did not live with her mother in her last days. I do not know whom she married. Mr. C. E. Schick, genealogist of Harrisburg, writes that she married John Huber.\n\nJohn Siegrist married and died young, leaving two sons: John Siegrist and Solomon Siegrist II.\n\nFAMILY OF BARTHOLOMEW, MR. AND SUSANNAH\n\n\"Bartholomew Siegrist, Jr., son of Bartholomew Siegrist, Sr. and Eve Siegrist, married Susannah ______ and located on a farm in Antrim Township, Cumberland County, Pennsylvania. Eight children were born to them; but before any of them were of legal age, the father died in February, 1778. His three oldest sons, Henry, Solomon, and John fought in the Pennsylvania militia during the Revolutionary War. In 1779 Bartholomew's widow, Susannah, became the wife of Frederick Augustus Walber of Antrim Township. I do not know if there were children of this marriage. The eight Siegrist children were:\n\n1. Henry Siegrist;\n\n2. Solomon Siegrist;\n\n3. John Siegrist, b. Aug 8, 1764, died Nov 16, 1841\n\n4. Michael Siegrist;\n\n5. Peter Siegrist;\n\n6. David Siegrist;\n\n7. Catherine Siegrist;\n\n8. Elisabeth Siegrist.\"\n\nEXCERPT FROM A LETTER\n\nThe following information was received in a letter from Mrs. C. L. Sechrest:\n\n\"George Secrest (father of Joseph Secrest and grandfather of Sarah Ellen Secrest, first wife of Thomas Burnett) married Anne Fry on Aug 13, 1793 (by the Rev Christian Streit of the Lutheran Church). George was the son of Henry Secrest (Heinrich Siegrist) by his second wife, Anna Maria (maiden name unknown) of Frederick County, Virginia.\n\nHenry Secrest (Heinrich Siegrist) made his will March 1, 1797 and it was proved September 30, 1799. Henry Secrest was a son of Bartholomew Siegrist, Jr. of Cumberland County, Pennsylvania, and his wife, Susannah. Bartholomew died in Feb 1778; and in 1779 Susannah married Frederick Augustus Walker of Cumberland County, PA.\n\nBartholomew Siegrist, Jr. was the son of Bartholomew Siegrist, Sr., and his wife, Eve of Lancaster County, PA. Bartholomew Siegrist, Sr. died in 1768 and Eve died in Dec 1792. Both left wills.\n\nThe children of Henry Secrest (Heinrich Siegrist) were as follows:\n\nBy the first wife:\n\n1. Frederic Secrest, died Dec 1834, married Catherine _____;\n\n2. Henry Secrest, b. 1759, died Sep 11, 1835, unmarried;\n\n3. Margaretta Secrest, died 1844, married Jacob Kackley;\n\n4.

Elizabeth Secrest, b. 1780, died Dec 1870, married Frederick Larrick;\n\n8. Christian Secrest, died before 1835, married George Lamp, July 11, 1811.\" (This name is also found on some documents as \"Christina.\")\n\nAARON BURNET - DECLARATION FOR PENSION\n\nIn order to obtain the benefits of the 7th June 1832 STATE OF NEW JERSEY, ESSEX COUNTY:\n\nOn this 18th day of August 1832 personally appeared before me, Abner Ball, one of the Justices of the Peace in said County, AARON BURNET, a resident of, living _____ Township, in the County of Essex, State of New Jersey, aged 77 years the 5th day of October insuing, who being duly sworn according to law doth on his oath make the following declaration in order to obtain the benefit of the provision made by the Act of Congress passed June 7, 1832; that he entered the service of the United States under the command of Captain Isaac Reeve and performed a tour of duty for one month (This is a date not recollected, believes it was at the time the British fleet landed at New York), and was fired upon at Bergen Point from a British Tonder (?). He performed a tour of duty one month at Newark in Essex County under the same Captain. He performed a tour of duty of one month as a substitute for a drafted militia man (name not recollected) under the command of Captain Abraham Speer; and a tour of one month at Newark under Captain Isaac Reeve, and was marched over to Staten Island and had engagements with the British when Joz Clisley was taken prisoner by the enemy, that he was out and man-at-arm and followed the enemy near to the English neighborhood in Bergen County under the command of General Wing and continued there a considerable length of time and had to find himself as he always had to do when under alarms. He was called and was under alarm and was at the Battle at Connecticut Farms when Captain Isaac Reeve, Lieutenant David Littell, and Samuel Baldwin were wounded, and Jacob Riock, Nicholas Parsell, and Daniel Reeve were killed by the enemy; he also performed a tour of duty one month at Springfield and a tour of duty one month at Morristown in Morris County under the command of Captain Isaac Reeve previous to his being wounded; he further saith that he was in the Battle of Springfield with the Hessians when Robert Pollard, a militiaman, was wounded and a young man by the name of Davis, an appointee to Joshua Horten was killed. He was at the Battle of Connecticut Farms when the meeting house and fourteen dwelling houses were burnt; he was at the Battle of Springfield on a tour of duty for one month under the command of Captain Elijah Squier when the Presbyterian meeting house of that place was set on fire by the enemy and burnt down; he was on a tour of duty at Elizabeth town Point and helped build the breastworks at that place, the number of months not recollected, neither his Captain. It was either Captain Nelholz (?) or Captain John Edward, he having done duty under both those officers, and after the performance of the above mentioned services, he enlisted in the three-months service under the command of Captain Josia Pierson, and served in guarding the lines near Amboy, Middlesex County where the enemy lay, and had many battles with them, one in particular at the Blackash Swamp when a soldier from Pennsylvania was wounded in the knee and was carried to Springfield and there died with the wound. I thereafter entered in the wagon service for three months under the command of Captain Samuel Crowell and was employed in carting provisions from Trenton to King's Ferry in the State of New York during the whole three months. All the above mentioned tours of duty (and he believes many more) were performed by the deponent as being always in readiness during the whole Revolutionary War making thirteen months independent of the services rendered under alarms and at Elizabethtown Point. The deponent verily believes that he served under his enlistments, as a drafted militiaman, volunteer, and under different alarms more than two years during the war. He also saith that a man by the name of Eleazer Luken was in the same company with him under the command of Captain Isaac Reeve and is now living. He saith further that he served under Captain Thomas Williams, how long he does not recollect. He hereby relinquishes every claim whatever to a pension annuity except the present and declares that his name is not on the pension roll of any agency of any State or Territory.\n\nAARON BURNET\n\nSWORN AND SUBSCRIBED THE DAY AND YEAR AFORESAID. ABNER BALL, JUSTICE OF THE PEACE\n\n....................\n\nAnd I do hereby certify that I am well acquainted with Elias Luken, whose affidavit of the services of the said Aaron Burnet is annexed to the Declaration aforesaid, that he is an old and respectable resident of the County of Essex, and that his statement is entitled to full credit and belief, being esteemed as a man of truth and veracity in the neighborhood where he resides and I do further certify that I am personally acquainted with the above named applicant and have known him for fifty years past; that he is esteemed as a man of truth and veracity in the neighborhood where he resides and reputed and believed to have been a soldier of the Revolutionary War and I concur in that opinion. It also appeared upon examination thereof that the said Aaron Burnet hath already answered the interrogations prescribed by the War Department, which answers are written and contained in his Declaration hereunto annexed. In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand this 28th day of May, A. D. 1833.\n\nABNER BALL, JUSTICE OF THE PEACE"
