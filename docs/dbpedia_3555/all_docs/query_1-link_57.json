        "text": "William Graham (1740 - 7/17/1818) was one of the original signers of the Meckenburg Declaration of Independence. His ancestors were Scotch-Irish and first settled in Pennsylvania before coming to Mecklenburg County, North Carolina. Born in Ulster, Ireland, he married Margaret Graham of Rowan County. Her grandfather, James Graham, Sr., was from Inverrary, Scotland. Whether William and Margaret were related or just coincidentally had the same surname is unknown. They settled in the Hopewell section of Mecklenburg County, where he is believed to have been a founder and elder of the Hopewell Presbyterian Church.\n\nHis name appears as a signer of the Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence in the church. He owned a considerable amount of property and some slaves. Tradition says he was an observer of the Sabbath and did not allow any work, even meal preparation, on that day. Graham also served his community as a soldier in the battle of King's Mountain.\n\nHe and his wife had nine sons, many who immigrated to Tennessee, Mississippi and Georgia. William's tombstone states he was 'An obliging neighbor and useful citizen.' His son, William, who died in Mississippi in 1858, has a statement on his tombstone that he was the 'Son of the Signer of the Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence.\n\nDocumentation\n\n(1) King, Victor C. Lives and Times of the 27 Signers of the Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence of May 20, 1775. Charlotte, NC, 1956."
