        "text": "HON. JOHN W. KENNON. One of the well-known and honored names in Belmont County, Ohio, is that of Kennon, representing large landed interests as well as social and political prominence. A most worthy and esteemed member of this family is found in Hon. John W. Kennon, who resides upon a fine estate within one mile of the city of Barnesville.\n\nThe birth of Mr. Kennon occurred in Ireland, in 1812, a year of historic interest in the annals of America, and was one of a family of seven children born to Newall and Jane (Wilson) Kennon, the latter of whom died in her native Ireland, in 1819. In 1821, the father of our subject, with his seven motherless children, left his excellent farm in Ireland, where he had prospered as long as he had been cheered and supported by the presence of his devoted wife; emigrating to America, he made his first permanent settlement in Warren township, Belmont County, Ohio, where he purchased 1,000 acres of land, paying for this large tract the sum of $10,000. In those early days the land was yet covered with its virgin growth of timber. In order to have had land quickly cleared and put under cultivation. Mr. Kennon hired various parties to undertake this business, leasing to each for seven years, free of charge, the contract being that they were to clear 21 acres. A man of excellent business faculty, he lived to see many changes wrought by his plans. He died in 1863, at the advanced age of 91 years.\n\nJohn W. Kennon grew to the age of eight years in his native county, Down, Ireland, at that age accompanying his father to America. His education was obtained in an old log school house near his home, in company with the children of other pioneer families, and he was reared to agricultural pursuits, for which he has never lost a taste. At the beginning of the Grange movement, he became interested and during his later legislative career furthered in every way in his power those laws tending to be of advantage to the farming community. Successfully operating a large estate, he also became a leader in public matters and on more than one occasion, on account of the reliability of his character, was selected to serve as a United States juror, at Cincinnati. During the winters of 1868 and 1869, he served as a Representative in the State Legislature, and he was appointed one of the committee to select the site of the State Reform School for Girls, the same being now a credit to White Sulphur Springs, Delaware county, Ohio.\n\nOn Nov. 7, 1851, Mr. Kennon was united in marriage with Eliza DuBois, and ten children were born to this union, as follows: Jane W., Josephine, Mary E., J. Newall, Agnes, Thomas J., William H., Anna E., Robert R., and George W. the two last named being deceased. Mary E. married Daniel Crawford, , who died in February, 1884. Josephine married Frank J. Beaston, a manufacturer of Philadelphia. Thomas J. married Clara M. Beaston of Philadelphia where they reside. William H. married Zetta Eccleston, and they reside in Cleveland. J. Newell resides with his aged parents. In 1875, Mr. Kennon erected a handsome residence on his estate just one mile north of Barnesville. A discovery of oil was made on his farm, resulting in a productive well and the drilling of a second, this also promising to be satisfactory. Mr. Kennon and family belong to the Presbyterian Church. He is most highly regarded in this vicinity as not only one of the most substantial but also as one of the most upright and public-spirited citizens of Belmont County.\n\nSource: Centennial History of Belmont County, Ohio and Representative Citizens. Publ. Biographical Publishing Co. - Chicago, Illinois - 1903 - Page 617 JUDGE WILLIAM KENNON, SR. was a gentleman of distinguished ability both as a statesman and attorney. Born in Fayette County, Pennsylvania, in 1799, he removed, when 23 years of age, to St. Clairsville, where he spent the remainder of his life.\n\nJudge Kennon received a classical education at Athens College and studied law with William B. Hubbard, a prominent attorney of that day.\n\nIn 1827 he was admitted to the bar in Hillsborough, Ohio. However, previous to this event he married Mary Ellis, a sister of Mrs. Governor Shannon, and the fruits of this union were three children. Judge Kennon's great ability as a lawyer won for him a large and lucrative practice.\n\nHe entered public life when but 29 years of age, having been elected in 1828 to Congress, where he served his constituents with great ability for four years. In 1832 James M. Bell of Guernsey County defeated him, but two years later he was again elected, serving until 1837.\n\nHis prominence and ability as a constitutional lawyer secured his nomination and election to the position of judge of the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit, a position he filled with distinction and honor for 10 years.\n\nIn 1850 he was chosen Supreme Court judge and president of the State Constitutional Convention, which made the present code of civil procedure.\n\nJudge Kennon's force and ability as an attorney gave him a lucrative and laborious practice that extended far beyond the limits of his own State.\n\nIt was while engaged in the celebrated Campbell will case in Brooke County, West Virginia, that he was stricken with partial paralysis and was compelled thereafter to retire from practice.\n\nWhile Judge Kennon was a profound statesman and scholar, he was a genial and courtly gentleman and an earnest and devout Christian. Every Sabbath morning, when the weather would permit, he was seen in his accustomed place of worship, his chin resting upon his cane by reason of his infirmities while he looked up steadfastly and encouragingly into the preacher's face.\n\n~ Page 102 GEORGE KERN, who has been secretary of the Belmont Savings & Loan Company of Bellaire, Ohio, for the past three years, was born in the Rhine section of Germany, in 1837. In 1853, when still a lad, he immigrated to America, intent upon making a career or himself. A short time was spent in Baltimore, Maryland, and then the young man made his way to Wheeling, (West) Virginia, and two years later located in Benwood, where he followed the trade of baker until he came to Bellaire, in 1856, engaging in the same business until 1885.\n\nMr. Kern then embarked in a confectionery business and continued in the same until he accepted his present responsible position as secretary of the Belmont Savings & Loan Company. The marriage of Mr. Kern was to Catherine Roder, who was born in Hesse, Germany, and a family of 12 children was born to them, eight of these survive and all live in Bellaire, with the exception of one who resides at Richmond, Virginia. The handsome family residence is located on Belmont street in South Bellaire, where the family is much esteemed and has a wide circle of friends. In politics Mr. Kern is a Democrat and has voted that ticket since 1859. For 20 years he served his township as trustee and has been a member of the City Council of Bellaire for 10 years. Mr. Kern is a man of social instincts and belongs to many fraternal orders, including the Odd Fellows. For many years he has been a leading member of the German Reformed Church.\n\n~ Page 493 AMBROSE G. KING. One of the honorable old names in Belmont County, one which has been conspicuous in agricultural, business and military life, is that of King. One of the family's leading representatives is Ambrose G. King, a prominent and successful farmer of Wayne township, who was born April 22, 1837, in Washington township, Belmont County, a son of Philip and Margaret (Danford) King.\n\nPhilip King was in 1812, in Greene County, Pennsylvania, and was a son of Michael King, who was one of the early settlers of Monroe County, Ohio, and one of its most prosperous farmers. For nearly 70 years Philip King was a resident of Belmont County, a farmer of excellence, a merchant and tobacco handler of business integrity, a large land owner and a prominent Republican politician. For 27 years he served as justice the peace in Wayne township, removing there when Ambrose was a boy, and he held other township offices with the efficiency of an honest and upright citizen. His death occurred in 1898.\n\nThe mother of our subject was Margaret Danford, a daughter of Hon. Ambrose Danford, at one time a State legislator. She died in 1872, at the age of 60 years. The surviving members of the family born to these parents are: P. L., who resides at Bethesda, Ohio; W. P., w2ho is a merchant at Beallsville, Monroe County; Mary, who married William Miller, a farmer near Beallsville; and Ambrose G., of this biography.\n\nThe boyhood of Mr. King was spent in Wayne township and he was educated in the excellent schools at Barnesville. Until the outbreak of the Civil War, he had been mainly engaged in farming, having married and settled down to the enjoyment of domestic life. But Mr. King was too loyal and patriotic to ignore the call of the great President for defenders of the Union, and among the early enlistments of brave men, who hastened to Marietta, to enroll their names, we find that of Ambrose G. King, on Aug. 13, 1861, in Company E, 36th Reg., Ohio Vol. Inf., and from that date until he received his honorable discharge as a veteran, at Columbus, Ohio, July 27, 1865, his life, energies and faithful service were devoted to his country. His connection during these years was with the 4th, the 8th, the 11th and the 14th Army Corps. So long and continuous a service could scarcely escape being dangerous and that Mr. King, or give him his well-earned rank, Lieutenant King, saw hard fighting and was in the midst of it, was very conclusively proven by his three serious wounds, a coincidence being that all occurred in September, the first on the 17th in 1862, the second on the 20th in 1863, and the third on the 19th in 1864. His first wound, at the battle of Antietam, was serious enough to send him home on a furlough of 30 days, after which he rejoined his regiment. His second wound was received at the charge at Chickamauga, a gunshot in the mouth, this necessitating a stay of two months in the hospital at Nashville, Tennessee. His wound was so serious, while his valor was so pronounced, that a newspaper deemed it notable enough to thus comment:\n\n\"At the battle of Chickamauga, Sergeant King, giving vent to his feelings when a bullet entered his mouth, passed through his cheek and carried with it some teeth, had hardly recovered from the shock when a Rebel demanded his gun, and he answered 'yes,' and plunged his bayonet through his body.\n\nThe third wound which this gallant officer received was an Opequan, in 1864, a gunshot wound in the forehead, and this necessitated a hospital residence, at Chestnut Hill, Pennsylvania, for a period of two months. At this time he was a veteran, his first service having honorably terminated Feb. 14, 1864. On the same day he re-enlisted, in Company E, 36th Reg., Ohio Vol. Inf., and was transferred to Company F, 36th Reg., Ohio Inf. and as above noted was honorably discharged in 1865. To his credit stands a long list of the most telling battles of the war: Lewisburg, Second Bull Run, Fredericksburg, South Mountain, Antietam, Tullahoma, Hoover's Gap, Chickamauga, Brown's Ferry, Missionary Ridge, Cloyd's Mountain, Lynchburg, Kenesaw Mountain, Cabletown, Charlestown, Winchester, Martinsburg, Halltown, Berryville, Opequan and Beverly. Lieutenant King is the popular commander of the G. A. R. post at Pilcher, an office he has filled since its organization, with the exception of two years. The King family was a remarkably loyal one, three brothers of our subject also serving with distinction: Michael, a member of the 3rd Reg., Ohio Vol. Inf., now deceased, who was a prisoner for 26 months; Philip L.; and Charles H., a member of the 25th Reg., Ohio Vol. Inf., who died of the wounds he received at Gettysburg. The military spirit still lives in this patriotic family and resulted in a grandson of our subject taking part in the Spanish-American War as a member of the 6th Illinois Regiment. This young man lost his life at Pittsburg, on Sept. 23, 1902, - he was then employed on the Pennsylvania Railroad.\n\nOn Dec. 23, 1858, Ambrose G. King was united in marriage with Amanda J. Hudson, a daughter of William and Susan (Knull) Hudson, who came to Ohio prior to the birth of Mrs. King. A family of seven children was born to this union, as follows: William R., residing near his father, married first a Miss Tittlow, who at death left two children, Maud and Lettie, - the present wife, formerly a Miss Phillips, is the mother of an infant; Martha J., who is the wife of Leander Davis, resides in Wayne township, and they have six children; Charles S., who married Lucy Hocks, resides in Illinois, and they have two children: Benetta, who first married a Mr. Davis, had two children, her second husband being Mr. McFrederick, and their residence Jerusalem, Monroe County; Mary A., who is the wife of William Barrett, has three children and they live near Glencoe; Emma, who is a trained nurse in Philadelphia; and Kate M., who resides in Barnesville. Mr. King and sons are unusually fine specimens of physical manhood, the father being six feet four inches tall and weighing 240 pounds, his son Charles reaching six feet six inches and weighing 230 pounds, while William is almost an equal, weighing 227 pounds and being six feet three inches in height.\n\nFarming on his well-cultivated 50 acres is a main business of this soldier-citizen, but he has been many times honored with township offices in the gift of the people and the Republican party. As a justice of the peace he has given excellent satisfaction, and now is a notary public in Pilcher. His fraternal association with the Knights of Pythias at Jerusalem in Monroe County, is of long standing. Our subject is well known through Wayne township and is a representative man and a justly honored survivor of that great struggle which convulsed the country and absorbed its best blood, 40 years ago.\n\nIn six trips across the plains, during which he visited the Black Hills, Colorado and California, Mr. King also was a participant in some Indian fighting.\n\nSource: Centennial History of Belmont County, Ohio and Representative Citizens. Publ. Biographical Publishing Co. - Chicago, Illinois - 1903 - Page 813\n\nW. R. KING, one of the well-known farmers of Wayne township, Belmont County, and a citizen of prominence and public spirit, was born October 2, 1861, in Wayne township, a son of Ambrose G. King, one of the leading citizens of Belmont County.\n\nW. R. King was reared to agricultural pursuits, and acquired an excellent common-school education. His services were given to his father on the home farm, until he reached his legal majority, when he took a trip to the West, and located in Bureau County, Illinois, for six years, being employed during this time among the Illinois farmers, who contracted for his services by the year. In 1890 he returned to his native State, and a short time later purchased a farm of 80 acres east of Newcastle, but later sold that property and bought his present farm in section 20, Wayne township, near the village of Pilcher. This was considered a very desirable farm, being known as the Philip King farm, and was owned by William G. Budd. It comprises 160 acres and is well adapted to both general farming and also stock raising, Mr. King making a specialty of sheep. Formerly he raised quantities of tobacco, but does not now make that a leading crop. The excellent improvements have been placed here by our subject, and he now owns one of the attractive as well as very valuable farms of the township. In method he is practical, and he has been eminently successful.\n\nThe first marriage of Mr. King was to Josephine Titlow, a daughter of John Titlow. She died in 1899, leaving two daughters, viz.: Dora Maud and Lettie Pearl. Mr. King married for his second wife Amanda Phillips, a daughter of John Strickling, of Monroe County, Ohio, and one child has been born to this union,Lura May.\n\nMr. King is a stanch Republican, and in the spring of 1896 was elected township trustee, and served most acceptably for two terms, or six years. Fraternally he is a popular member of the Knights of Pythias of Jerusalem. Ohio. Mrs. King is a consistent member of the Christian Church and Mr. King contributes to its support and attends the services.\n\nJoseph Kirkwood JAMES THOMAS KNOX, a wealthy land owner of Richland township, Belmont County, Ohio, is a man of firm character, has always shown an interest in township and county affairs, and is now serving in the office of township trustee. He is a native of the farm adjoining his own, and was born in 1862, a son of William and Mary (King) Knox, the latter of Irish descent.\n\nWilliam Knox was an active citizen in his day and claimed Wheeling, West Virginia, as his native city. His arrival in Belmont County took place in the year 1862 and he immediately located in Richland township. purchased a farm there and followed agricultural pursuits the remainder of his days with marked success. He chose Mary King, a daughter of Andrew and Elizabeth (Blackwood) King, for his companion in life, and their union was blessed with 11 children, whose names will be given later. In politics Mr. Knox was a sincere Republican, and in his religious convictions he was a member of the United Presbyterian Church, as was also his wife. Both lived to advanced ages, the death of the former taking place in the spring of 1902, at the age of 73. Mrs. Knox's demise occurred in 1898, at the age of 62 years.\n\nOur subject's brothers and sisters are as follows Rev. A. K. Knox, who is a minister of the Presbyterian Church at Mt. Vernon, Iowa; Jemima, the wife of Robert Alexander, of Quincy, Belmont County, Ohio; Lizzie (1), now deceased; John, Maggie, and Carrie, who live on the home place; Mary, who married Frank Myers and resides in Smith township; Calvin and Jennie, who are both deceased; and Lizzie, the widow of James A. Greenlees, living on the old Knox homestead.\n\nOur subject was reared on the farm and obtained his education in the common schools. He chose farming as his vocation. naturally, and at the present time he is the owner of 145 acres of land on the home place and 18 acres adjoining it, all of which he keeps in first-rate order and in a state of high cultivation. He chose for his wife Anna May McMaster, and they were married in 1890. Mrs. Knox is a daughter of William and Isabel McMaster and was born in 1867. a native of Richland township. Their union has been blessed with one child, Carl, who was born in 1892. The family live on the farm about four miles south of St. Clairsville, and are very comfortably situated. In religious belief they are members of the United Presbyterian Church.\n\nMr. Knox has always been a Republican, and upon the death of John Stewart, who was then township trustee, he was elected to fill the vacancy, serving with such satisfaction to all that he was re-elected for a full term in the spring of 1902. Besides this he has been school director for some time, and gives his support willingly to all enterprises which have for their aim the welfare of his township or county. As a citizen of worth; and value he receives the reward due him, through the respect and consideration of those in his community.\n\nJohn J.
