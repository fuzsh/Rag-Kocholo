        "text": "\"Early Immigrants to Virginia from the 1500s and 1600s\" documentation indicates Richard Kennon was born in England ca 1640, while other records indicate 1650 and that he was born in Virginia. It is unclear if he was the original immigrant, however multiple records show he may have been the son of of Richard Kennon, a surgeon, and his wife Elizabeth who were settled in lower Norfolk in 1637. Because no records of immigration can be found for Richard Kennon of Conjuror's Neck, the husband of Elizabeth Worsham, it is believed that his parents were likely the Richard and Elizabeth Kennon living in lower Norfolk county and and it is they who are the emigrants. It is further believed that they are the Richard and Elizabeth Canon/Kennon who appear on the passenger list of the ship Truelove, of London, that sailed in June 1635.\n\n\"Lewis of Warner Hall, The History of a Family\" compiled by Merrow Sorley indicates that Richard Kennon received a patent for 2827 acres in Henrico county in 1670 a full ten years prior to other records.\n\nHe married Elizabeth Worsham, daughter of William Worsham. He died in August 1696 (GENEALOGIES OF VIRGINIA FAMILIES VOL. I, p. 648). His willed was proved 20 August 1696 and it is often that date that is used as his date of death.\n\nIn 1686 he made a power of attorney to his brother-in-law, Mr. John Worsham. The preamble of the deed states that he was then about to sail to England. In 1691, he made a deed of gift to his children; Mary, Elizabeth, Martha and William KENNON. (Ibid Vol 2, p. 734.)\n\nRichard and Elizabeth (Worsham) Kennon's children:\n\n1. Mary Kennon (1679-1727) married ca 1697 Major John Bolling\n\n2. Elizabeth Kennon (1680-ca 1735) married ca 1698 Joseph Royall\n\n3. Martha Kennon (1681-1735) married 22 Dec 1701 Robert Munford\n\n4. Richard Kennon (1684-1688)\n\n5.

Richard Kennon (1690-1736) married ca 1714 Mary Agnes Bolling\n\n8. Judith Kennon (1692-1759) married June 1711 Thomas Eldridge\n\nThe Kennon family is rich in Virginia history and the home of Richard and Elizabeth (Worsham) Kennon is being preserved and maintained by the \"Old Brick House Foundation\".
