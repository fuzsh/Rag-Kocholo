        "text": "William “Billy” Allen Palmore, age 88, of Rocky Mount, VA passed away on Saturday, December 23, 2023 surrounded by loved ones. Billy is survived by his wife of 60 years, Norma, sons Dawson Jones, Allen and Steven Palmore, sister Joyce Parker, and grandchildren Marc Fitzwater, Meredith Palmore and Lorraine Palmore. He was preceded in death by his father Clyde Palmore, Sr., his mother Mary King Palmore, stepmother Evelyn Palmore, his brother Clyde P. Palmore Jr., and his grandson Cameron Fitzwater.\n\nBilly was born January 1, 1935 in Henrico County, VA on his family’s dairy farm where he resided and worked until the late 1950s. Billy was accepted into Virginia Tech in 1953, where he entered into the Agricultural Program. He was then drafted into the United States Army and was stationed in Germany. The Palmore family later moved to Spring Valley Farm in Louisa County, VA where he met and married the former Norma Harris and parented his three sons, who respectfully referred to him as “boss of the house.” During this time, Billy was very busy with farming and also very active in community, civic, and church activities. The family were active members of the Church of the Incarnation in Mineral, VA where Billy served in the choir, was a lay reader, and served several roles on the church vestry including Senior Warden. He also was active in civic and farming organizations including Dairyman’s Incorporated and the Louisa Lions Club. Billy was also a longstanding member of the Board of Directors for Rockingham Mutual Insurance Company. In the 1990s after the family sold the dairy cows, Billy received his real estate and appraiser’s license and worked for Lloyd’s Real Estate in Louisa, VA in addition to farming. During this time Billy also served on the Electoral Board and Industrial Development Authority for Louisa County.\n\nIn 2002 after the children had moved away, Billy and Norma went on an adventure and relocated to Franklin County, VA where they fell in love with the area. They developed many strong friendships with neighbors and the church community at Franklin Heights Church. Billy always looked forward to meeting with his Bible study group and enjoyed the fellowship among the group.\n\nBilly enjoyed spending his free time hunting, fishing, and being outdoors. He and Norma also enjoyed traveling in retirement seeing the United States and visiting Europe. He will always be remembered for his love of God, his friends and family, farming, and for his hearty laugh that made everyone smile.\n\nVisitation will be held at Conner-Bowman Funeral Home in Rocky Mount, VA at 10:00 am on January 3, 2024 with a Memorial Service at 11:00 am. Refreshments will be served at Franklin Heights Church in Rocky Mount, VA immediately following the service.\n\nArrangements by Conner-Bowman Funeral Home, 62 VA Market Place Drive, Rocky Mount, VA 24151."
