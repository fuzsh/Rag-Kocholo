        "text": "ALLEN, WILEY T.\n\nWiley T. Allen - William Allen, father of Wiley T. Allen, was born in Morgan county, Georgia, August 1, 1795, and in the State of his birth married Miss Martha Webb, and the number of their children was an old-fashioned one, thirteen, five of whom are living at the present writing: Rebecca, widow of Mr. Dewitt; Lucinda, widow of Solomon Dermon, living near Meridian, Mississippi; Julia, Mrs. Erskinson, living in the same place; Clem S., a farmer of Kemper county, Mississippi, and Wiley T., the subject of this sketch. Dewitt lost his life during the war while in the Confederate army; George died at Warrington, Virginia, in the Confederate service, in July, 1862; John died near Athens, in Henderson county, Texas; and all the rest died young. The father died at his home near Meridian, Mississippi, at the age of eighty-two years.\n\nWiley T. Allen was born in Perry county, Alabama, April 5, 1835, and remained with and assisted his father on the plantation until he had attained the age of about twenty years, after which he became an overseer in Alabama until 1860. He entered the Confederate army at the opening of the late war, enlisting in the Twenty-sixth Texas Cavalry, with which he served till it was disbanded, May 28, 1865, participating in all the engagements of the Red river campaign.\n\nAfter the war he settled on his present property on Galveston island, where he has since been engaged in farming. He was married October 20, 1863, to Miss Anna Butler, a daughter of Captain John W. Butler, who was born off the isle of San Domingo, on a large vessel. His father was a Colonel in the British army and all his ancestors were military men. For seven years Captain Butler was Indian agent in Canada for the British government. He was married to Henrietta D. Onderside, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1832, after which he removed to France and for four or five years was a resident of the city of Tours. At the end of that period he returned to America and took up his residence in Texas, and embarked in the live-oak-timber business for Government uses, which occupation he pursued on the Brazos river from 1832 to 1839 and lost considerable money. He then settled on Galveston Island near the present Catholic Orphans' Home, and was engaged there in dairying and farming until his death, which occurred June 25, 1881. Mrs. Allen was born on the island October 20, 1845, and her union with Mr. Allen has resulted in the birth of the following children: Lucy, born July 21, 1872; William J. and Herbert B. (twins) were born December 12, 1877; Claud Marion was born November 12, 1892; and four children died in early childhood. Mr. and Mrs. Allen have a comfortable home and dispense generous hospitality to the numerous friends they have gathered about them.

Among the many estimable citizen of Ashley County, who are successful in their different callings, may be mentioned the name of Thomas L. Atkin, who is one of the foremost men among the agriculturists. He was born in Perry County, Ala., on February 27, 1857, and remained in his native county until ten years of age. He came to Ashley County, Ark., with his mother and step-father in 1867, and here he has made his home ever since with the exception of the years 1872 and 1873, when he was attending Barton Academy in Mobile, Ala. When twenty-three years of age he started out to farm for himself, purchased 120 acres and has earned an agricultural pursuits ever since with good success. He has a steam gin on his place with a capacity of ten bales per day, and it is fully equipped with all modern improvements. Mr. Atkin is also merchandising on a small scale and carries a stock of goods valued at about $1,000. He was married on March 24, 1887, to Miss Mattie Powell, daughter of Ed Powell, and they have one son, Edward P. Mr. and Mrs. Atkin are members of the Methodist Episcopal Church, and he is both a member of the A. F. & A. M. and the K. of P. In politics he is Democratic.

D., son of William F., and Elizabeth Caroline (Mitchell) Baldridge was born in Cornersville, Marshall County, Tenn., May 12, 1832.\n\nWilliam F. Baldridge was born in North Carolina in 1809, and brought in his infancy to Giles County, Tenn., wherein due time, he learned the tanner's trade, in which business he afterward engaged quite extensively. In 1836, he removed to Perry County and embarked in merchandising and in 1844 he became a resident of Lauderdale County. In 1855, he established a nursery not far from Huntsville, which is said to have been the first enterprise of the kind in that section; and in l867, he removed to Plano, Tex., where he still resides. He had eleven children: Milton C, James A., Jane C, Virginia C, Mary A., Parmella R., Elizabeth, William F., John C, Henry H. and Oscar.\n\nMrs. Caroline Baldridge died in March, 1860, and William F. was again married to a Miss McDonald, of Huntsville.\n\nMilton C. Baldridge was reared upon a farm. He received a good education, and in 1850 began the study of medicine at Florence with Dr. J. P. Mitchell. In 1853, he attended lectures at the Medical College of Ohio, in Cincinnati, and practiced on a license until 1874, when he was graduated from the Medical College, of New York.\n\nIn the spring of l862, he entered the army as assistant surgeon of the Twenty-sixth Alabama and Forty-eighth Tennessee Regiments, and continued there until ill-health forced him to abandon the field. After returning home, he practiced near Huntsville until 1871, when he located in that city, where he has since remained and established a most successful practice. He is a member of the State Medical Association, of which he has been Vice-president, Orator, and is now Grand Senior Counsellor and President. He has been Health Officer of Madison County since 1882; is a member of the County Medical Society; Chairman of the Medical Board of Examiners, and is a frequent contributor to medical journals.\n\nThe Doctor is a Knight Templar, Scottish Rite, Mason, an Odd Fellow, Knight of Honor and a Knight of Pythias.\n\nHe was married January 16, 1855, to Miss N. C. Neely, a daughter of Anderson P, and Eliza M. (Cannon) Neely. Unto them were born seven children: James Alexander, Viola Beatrice, Mollie Bertie, Felix Edgar, Stella Corvin, Percy and Katie. James Alexander died October 6, 1856, Mollie Bertie died March, 1866, Percy died 1872. Viola Beatrice is the wife of Bently H. Brooks, now of Paris, Texas. Felix Edgar, Stella Corvin, and Katie reside with their father in Huntsville, Ala. The Doctor's first wife died in April, 1878, and in September, 1880, he married Miss Ella M. Johnson, who has one child, Milton C, Jr. The Doctor and Mrs. Baldridge are members of Methodist Episcopal Church, South.

D., was born May 12, 1815 in Rockingham County, N. C, and is a son of Louis and Mary (Farrar) Bradfield, natives, respectively, of Virginia and North Carolina.\n\nThe father of our subject was a farmer and carpenter, and, after a long and useful career, died at Uniontown in 1870.\n\nJohn Bradfield attended Smith's high school in Rockingham County, where he prepared himself to enter the medical college in Charleston, of which institution he was a graduate in 1845. In that year he began the practice of his profession at Uniontown,[Ala] where he has had an unbroken professional career of forty-three years, and is beyond doubt the oldest practicing physician in the county, where he has resided so long, and has, perhaps, few equals in the State who can claim as long an experience in any locality as he. It needs no assurance on the writer's part to convince any one that Dr, Bradfield has been uniformly successful as a physician. If such were wanting it could be established from the testimony of hundreds to whom he has skillfully applied the great healing art, and by reason of which he is constantly the recipient of the benedictions of those thus placed under a pleasant obligation.\n\nDr. Bradfield is a member of the Perry County and Alabama Medical Societies, and has held the office of president of the former and censor of both. He is likewise a member of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, and belongs to the Masonic fraternity.\n\nDr. Bradfield was married in November, 1845, to Miss Emily F., daughter of Dr, Archibald and Frances (Ware) Perkins, of Madison, Ga., and has a family of three sons, all of whom are now successful men of the world and ornaments of the social spheres to which they belong, George H, is a practicing lawyer, John W, a doctor, both residents of Uniontown; and Louis T. a successful business man of Birmingham, Ala.

Brown, was born in Marion, Ala., September 5, 1860. He received his education at Howard College, that city, and became teller in the bank there when but fifteen years of age. A year later he accepted a situation in a wholesale dry goods store at Selma, Ala., and while engaged in that concern, made good use of his spare time by reading Blackstone. In 1883 he went to Nashville, Tenn., and engaged as traveling salesman for a large wholesale establishment. Three years later he returned to Marion and edited the Marion Standard for one year. In December, 1886, he engaged in the real estate business at Sheffield, and is now the president of the Real Estate Association of that city.\n\nMr. Brown is one of the most active and brilliant young men of Sheffield, and has been recognized as among those who take the most interest in the progress of that rapidly advancing city.\n\nThe subject of this sketch is a son of Wilson K. and Mary C. (Parrish) Brown. The senior Mr. Brown was born in Mathews County, Va., in 1815, came to Marion County, this State, in 1836, and resided there until his death, which occurred in 1882. He was first a merchant and planter, and in his later years carried on a banking business. He was a very wealthy man before the war. His wife, Mary C, was born in Hillsborough, N. C. Her mother, Elizabeth Huntington, was a native of Connecticut. The Huntington family are of English descent. Our subject's parents reared seven sons and one daughter, viz.: Charles G., an attorney at Birmingham; Wilbur, Henry P., Wilson R., David H. , Eugene L., and W. G., a professor in the Marion Military Institute.

Bush Esq., attorney at law, Birmingham, Ala., was born Nov. 15, 1841, near Williamsburg, Va. His father, William Bush, a descendant of one of the original Jamestown settlers, was a planter, and from 1851 until his death, Feb. 11, 1862, was chief justice of James City county court at Williamsburg, Va.; he was also a member of the Virginia legislature. Our subject's mother, Melinda Bush, was a daughter of Henry Finch of Charles City county, Va., and was a direct descendant of Sir Heneage Finch, one of the lord chancellors of England. She died Nov. 10, 1862. John W. Bush was reared in Virginia, and was a student attending William and Mary college at the outbreak of the Civil war. He enlisted in Lee's Virginia rangers, a company raised by Capt. W. H. F. Lee, son of Gen. Robt. E. Lee. For a short while in his campaign in West Virginia he was a courier for Gen. Robt. E. Lee. He served temporarily on the staff of Gen. S, H. Barton. He belonged to Stuart's cavalry. He was engaged in many of the great battles fought by the Army of Northern Virginia, and was twice wounded on the 18th of August, 1864, at White Oak Swamp, and on the 27th of October, 1864, on the Boydton plank road. He was with the army at Appomattox Court House, but did not surrender, having escaped with many of his comrades. He taught school and studied law when the war ended, and was admitted to practice in the district court of appeals at Williamsburg, Va. Soon thereafter he moved to Uniontown, Ala., and commenced the practice of law, where he lived for twenty years. He represented his district in the State senate from 1878 to 1882. In 1887 he moved to Birmingham, Ala., where he now resides and practices his profession with his son, George E. Bush. John W. Bush is a member of the Episcopal church, Bar association, Birmingham Commercial club, Camp Hardee, United Confederate Veterans, and he is commander of the Fourth brigade of the Alabama division of United Confederate Veterans. He was appointed by Governor Joseph F. Johnston as special judge and presided in the city court of Birmingham, Ala. He is a Royal Arch Mason, and served as high priest of his chapter for six years, and served as master of Uniontown lodge No. 50, at Uniontown, Ala., for ten years. He had three brothers in the army; two of them are now dead. Joseph R., a brother now living, was wounded, captured and was in Camp Chase, Ohio, when the war ended. He traces his lineage to Revolutionary heroes, one of whom is Major John W. Bush, whose name lives with our subject. He was married on the 21st day of October, 1869, to Sallie Evans, daughter of Matthew Ryan and Sarah S. Evans, of Mobile, Ala., and who is the sister of Mrs. Augusta J. (Evans) Wilson, the distinguished authoress. Of this marriage there are two children, Howard E. Bush, a civil engineer, and George E. Bush, and a grandson whose name is Starr Kealhofer.

The industry, perseverance and close attention to business which, a person displays in the management of any particular branch of trade results largely in their personal popularity. And in the case of Mr. Butler this is certainly true, for he has adhered so closely to farming that high esteem has been placed upon him. He was born in Perry County, Ala., on April 5, 1836, and was the son of Leonard and Judith (Williams) Butler, natives of South Carolina, and the grandson of Dr. Ephraim Butler. The Butlers are of Irish descent, their ancestors having come to America under the leadership of Cecil Calvert (Lord Baltimore) 1643 to 1649 to escape persecutions, religious and political. They seem to have drifted south, for we find one of them, Pierce Butler, a delegate to the Constitutional Convention from South Carolina, and who, in the name of his State, was a signer to the constitution. Going still farther south we find William O. Butler at one time on the ticket with Lewis Cass for Vice-President. He was a Major-General in the Mexican War. Another one of this family was from South Carolina and Colonel of the Palmetto Regiment. The father of our subject came from South Carolina when a boy, located in Alabama, and his death occurred in Perry County in 1852. The mother died in Texas in 1868. Both were honored members of the Baptist Church. They reared a family of eight children, four of whom are now living, the sister, the wife of Capt. Clark of Ashley County, and the two brothers, Abner K. and Leonard R., are in the Lone Star State. William L. Butler passed his boyhood days on his father's plantation in Alabama, and was educated at Howard College in the same State. In 1856 he came to Ashley County, Ark, bought land, farmed on this until 1860, and then returned to Alabama, where he married Mrs. M. J. Atkin, a lady of Knickerbocker descent. To this marriage were born four children, one now living. The war breaking out, Mr. Butler sided with the Confederacy, and in May, 1861, enlisted in Company K, Eighth Alabama, and was made first lieutenant of same. He was in no special battles, but was on the peninsula around Yorktown. He remained with that regiment until April, 1862, when he was elected captain of Company A, Twenty eighth Alabama Regiment He was then in the Battle of Corinth, then to Tupelo, then operated in Tennessee and Kentucky, and was in the battles of Perryville, Murfreesboro, Chickamauga, Missionary Ridge, New Hope, Marietta, and Atlanta. On the day that the battle of Murfreesboro was fought he was commissioned major. From that time on he was commander of the Twenty-Eighth Alabama, and the only field officer with the regiment. After the battle of Chickamauga he was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel, and after the battle of Atlanta he was given the colonelcy. He was at the battle of Franklin, and early in that engagement took command of Manigault's Brigade, the general and senior colonels having been previously killed or badly wounded. All day long he rode where the fight raged fiercest, and when the battle closed he reformed the shattered lines of his gallant brigade within the Federal works. Col. Butler commanded this brigade from then on until he was wounded and captured, which occurred soon after at the battle of Nashville. He was confined at the hospital for some time, and in April, 1865, was taken to Fort Delaware, where he remained until the latter part of July. He was then paroled, took the oath of allegiance, and returned to Alabama, where he remained one year. He then moved his family to his plantation in Arkansas, and here has resided since. Until lately he has planted on a large scale, farming from 400 to 500 acres, but now is not farming so extensively. Mrs. Butler died on July 6, 1884. In May, 1889, Mr. Butler married Mrs. L. J. Norwood. Socially Mr. Butler is a Mason and a K. of P., and holds his membership in both orders in Poplar Bluff. Mr. Butler lived through the reconstruction period, and then it was that the citizens of his vicinity suffered more from the depredations of the State Militia than they did during the war.

The agricultural interests of Portland Township are ably represented by the subject of this sketch, a man whose life has been passed in the calling which now receives his attention. He owes his nativity to Marion, Perry County, Ala., where his birth occurred on July 7, 1845, and remained under the parental roof until March, 1861. Prior to that time he had attended Howard College at Marion, and later entered the military school at Tuscaloosa. Then he, with seventeen others, run away to Vicksburg, and joined Company F, Twentieth Alabama Infantry, and served three years and four months, He was on detached service at Jackson, and after the parole he was in the Battles of Chickamauga, Lookout Mountain, Missionary Ridge, Ringgold, Dalton, and in the spring of 1863 was at Rocky Face Ridge, Resaca, Atlanta, Rough and Ready, Dalton (where they captured 200 Negroes), through Huntsville, Ala., to Florence, Columbia, Tenn., Franklin, Nashville, and was then fighting nearly all the time back to Shoal Creek, near Florence. They were then at Bentonville, N. C, were afterward sent to guard some salt at Broad River Bridge, N. C., then went to Blackhawk Station, then to Atlanta, from there to Tallapoosa River, and then Mr. Cain, with one companion, came down that river to the Alabama, and from there to Montgomery, where he was captured. He was held overnight, and then went on foot to Selma, from which place he made his way home after an absence of over three years. Later he began clerking for R. W. Cole in a grocery house, continued with this for six months, and then went to Selma, where he filled the same position for Hanna & Morton for eight months. From there he went to Mobile, thence to Mansfield, De Soto Parish, La., and three months later started for Mexico. He got as far as Guadalupe River, and then returned to Louisiana. Three months after this he went to Marion, Union Parish, La., clerked for B. B. Thomas for three years, and then, on December 20, 1871, came to the bayou, Portland Township, and here he has resided since. For the first three years he rented land, and then bought eighty acres, to which he has since added forty acres more. He has sixty acres cleared. In 1874 he married Miss Alice Hollaway, daughter of James Hollaway, an old citizen of this county. Five children have been born to this union - four sons and a daughter: Walter A., James E., Benson, Samuel E. and Alma, Mr. Cain has been Deputy Sheriff nearly ever since he settled in this county, and has also held the position of School Director. In politics he adheres closely to the Democratic party, and socially he is a member of the K. of H. Mrs. Cain is a member of the Methodist Church. The parents of Mr. Cain, Anderson and Sarah (Benson) Cain were natives, respectively, of North Carolina and Alabama, The Cain's are of Irish extraction, and the Benson's of Scotch. Wiley Cain, the father of Anderson, and his wife, Sarah, came to America from Ireland early in the present century. Anderson left home when fifteen or sixteen years of age, and came to Alabama. He drove a team during the day, studied law during the night, and was rewarded by being elected Clerk of the Circuit Court, which position he filled for twelve years. He became one of the leading attorneys of the county, and before the war, had accumulated considerable property, being the owner of a large plant and fifty work bands. He died in the spring of 1855, and was buried in that county. He was both a Mason and an Odd Fellow. He left a family of three children - a son and two daughters his wife having died in 1850. One of the daughters is living in Ashley County and is the wife of George Franklin. The other sister died in Ashley County in February, 1885.

Cobb was born at Ashville, St. Clair County, Ala., February 25, 1829. He attended school at an academy at Ashville, and graduated from the University of Tennessee in 1850. After leaving his alma mater he at once began the study of law at the home of his childhood; was licensed to practice at the same place about 1855, and admitted to the bar of the Supreme Court very soon afterward. He began his professional life at Ashville, but moved to Montevallo, Shelby County, in 1856, and made that place his residence until after the war. In the fall of 1865 he transferred his home to Marion, Perry County, where he practiced law until 1868, at which time he returned to Shelby County, and located at Columbiana. In 1872 his friends of the Democratic party elected him to the State Senate from the district including Shelby and Bibb Counties. In 1876 he was again sent to the Senate from this district, which by a change was now comprised of Shelby, Jefferson and Walker Counties. This Senate made him their president, and in 1878, the Democratic party expressed its appreciation of his services and ability by placing him in the gubernatorial chair. About 1874 the State of Alabama found herself hampered with an enormous debt, amounting to about thirty millions of dollars, a very large portion of which was improper and fraudulent. A plan for the adjustment of that debt was devised by Peter Hamilton, of Mobile, Rufus W. Cobb and other members of the Senate, and after it had been submitted to, and approved by, the Governor (Houston), bills were prepared, and proper steps taken to effect such legislation as would develop and carry out this plan. They provided for a commission to adjust the indebtedness, which commission consisted of George S. Houston, Levi W. Lawler, and T. B. Bethea, who effected the proposed adjustment, and reduced the State indebtedness to about ten millions of dollars. This action on the part of the commission was ratified by the Legislature. The position of Rufus W. Cobb, at this time, as President of the Senate, and his active energy in developing the plan to relieve the State from her burden, made him the prominent and most desirable man to succeed Houston as Governor. He was re-elected Governor in 1878, and at the expiration of his second term (1882) his public life ceased. Since that time he has been active as a member of the bar of Shelby, and has resided at Helena. When the tocsin of war rang through the land in 1861, Rufus W. Cobb responded promptly to its call. He entered the army as captain of Company C, Tenth Alabama Regiment. This command was in the Army of Northern Virginia. In 1863, he was transferred to the Western Army under Bragg, and placed on special and detached duty, reporting personally to the generals in command. He remained in this service until the close of the war. Governor Cobb is a son of John W. Cobb, who was born in Virginia about 1800, reared in South Carolina, and came to Ashville about 1820. He married Catherine Peake, a widow, whose maiden name was Stevens. They had two sons, of whom W. Harvey Cobb is the elder. He was born September 2, 1823, at Ashville, where he has always lived, and is now the oldest inhabitant. John W. Cobb was by occupation a merchant and farmer, and served as a member of the State Legislature, several terms. He was a colonel in the Florida War, and died in 1845. Bishop Cobb, of the Episcopal Church, is related to Governor Cobb, and it is believed that all the Cobbs in the country descended from the one stock, which originated in Wales. Governor Cobb was married in 1850 to Miss Margaret, daughter of W. S. McClurg, of Knoxville, Tenn. By this marriage Governor Cobb has two living children - John W. Cobb, a farmer near Blount Springs, and Dora, now the wife of Richard Pell, Jr., of the Central Iron Works and Helena Mills, Mrs. Margaret Cobb died in 1865. On the last day of December, 1866, Governor Cobb was married to Miss Frances Pell, daughter of Richard Pell, Sr., a practical and successful iron master, and by this marriage has two children - Edith and Richard. Governor Cobb and family are Baptists; the Governor is a Knight Templar and has taken the 32d degree in the Scottish Rite. He has been Master of Blue Lodge at every place in which he has lived, and was Grand Master of the State for two terms. He is the only man who was ever Grand Master and Governor at the same time. The Governor is an eloquent speaker; a man of great deliberation and forethought; social in his disposition; liberal in his means, and attracts hosts of friends.

His parents were William Allen Cooke and Elizabeth Cooke. They were Virginians but moved to Alabama about 1840. H.C. Cooke volunteered and was enlisted in company K, 11th Alabama infantry, in May, 1861. His regiment formed a part of Wilcox’s Alabama Brigade. He was not quite sixteen when he enlisted in the Confederate service and was the smallest soldier in his regiment. He participated in the battles of Seven Pines, the siege and capture of Harper’s Ferry, Antietam or Sharpsburg , and Fredericksburg. A spell of fever prevented him from participating in the seven days fighting around Richmond. At the battle of Sharpsburg the color bearer of his regiment, Saunders, asked for someone to volunteer to take the colors. He offered to carry them, and did so until a shell shattered his right hand on the 13th day of September, 1862, at Fredericksburg. After two months in the 3rd Alabama Hospital, in Richmond, he was furloughed and returned to Marion, Alabama, where his parents then lived. He had his furlough extended from time to time and attended a country school, as his education up to that date was limited. In 1864 he returned to Richmond and was honorably discharged.\n\nAfter the war he attended Howard College, at Marion , Alabama, teaching school in vacation to defray his expenses. He graduated in 1868 and continued to teach for a couple of years, when he took editorial charge of the “Marion Commonwealth,” Marion, Alabama , which he edited for two years during the terrors of reconstruction. In the fall of 1874 came to Texas, locating temporarily at Bastrop, where he taught in the Centenary College. In 1876 he moved to Kimball, Bosque County, where he taught successfully for five years. On April 24, 1877, he married Miss Fannie I. Milner, a daughter of Dr. W. A. Milner, a prominent physician and planter of Freestone County, Texas. In 1886 the subject of this sketch was elected county clerk of Bosque County, in which capacity he served for three consecutive terms, declining to ask for a fourth term. He was afterwards elected County Judge of Bosque County, Texas, and bought the Daily Democrat-Reporter for five years, finally selling the plant and removing to Dallas, where he accepted a position as Commercial Editor of the Dallas Daily Times-Herald.

Corcoran, M.D., Physician and Surgeon, Uniontown, was born March 31, 1866, at Black Rock, Baltimore County, Md., and is a son of Christopher and Cynthia (F.) Corcoran, an old and respectable Maryland family. His father is a farmer in that State at this writing (1888).\n\nThe subject of this sketch attended the common schools until he was sixteen years old ; took private instructions two years, and began the study of medicine at the University of Maryland (Baltimore). During two years of his course he had the advantage of an hospital experience equivalent to actual professional life to such as are inclined to use it and there is no doubt of its application in this manner by young Corcoran. He graduated March 22, 1887, with the degree of M.D.\n\nDr. Corcoran, shortly after his graduation, came to Uniontown, [Ala]and entered upon the practice of his profession, and from the beginning has met with signal success. As a skillful practitioner and polished gentleman he is held in high esteem. The Doctor is a member of the Perry County Medical Society, and the Alabama State Medical Society, and of the American Legion of Honor, of which latter he is the Examining Officer. He is also a member and vestryman of the Protestant Episcopal Church.

Curry is a distinguished son of Alabama, who has won fame by inventions that are destined to be of incalculable value to the cotton-growing States.\n\nHis father, Jabez Curry, was of Scotch-Irish descent, and a native of Georgia, where his father, a Revolutionary soldier, had settled at an early day. He came to Alabama in 1823, settling in Perry County, where he was one of the largest planters of that section. He died in 1869. The mother of our subject was Rebecca Jordan, of English and French origin; she was a descendant of Lord Burwell, who settled a colony in Virginia, and also of the Dupree family, early settlers in Virginia. She died in 1874.\n\nBurwell J. Curry, our subject, was born in Perry County, Ala., in 1836. He received a liberal education, first under a private tutor, and two years with Professor Tutwiler, of Green Springs. In his fourteenth year he entered the sophomore class of the University of Alabama, where he pursued his studies two years, going thence to the University of Virginia, where he remained two years.\n\nHe commenced his business life in Mobile, and was also engaged in planting in Perry County prior to the war. He entered the army with a captain's commission, with authority to raise an independent troop of cavalry - used for special service and scouting. After the battle of Perryville he was retired from active service on account of disability, and served as post quartermaster, at Marion, Ala., until the close of the conflict.\n\nSubsequent to the war he was engaged in merchandising and cotton dealing, also planting in Hale and Marengo Counties, and in January, 1868, became a resident of Madison County, where he purchased a large plantation.\n\nHe accepted a lucrative position as general Southern manager for an insurance company, and was connected with them until 1874, when he resumed the management of his plantation.\n\nPossessed of superior mechanical ideas, and being a practical machinist, he soon evolved the idea of perfecting machinery which would solve in a great measure the economic question of how to raise cotton profitably. This he has done, beyond peradventure, in inventing the Curry Cotton Cultivating Machine, which has lately been placed upon the market, and has met with unbounded favor.\n\nMr. Curry removed to Huntsville in 1881, and commenced manufacturing and experimenting with his different inventions, spending a large private fortune in perfecting them, until he has finally achieved well-deserved success. His inventions are thus briefly described:\n\nThe Curry Cotton Cultivator and Chopper, with its suitable attachments, may be used to fallow or broadcast the land, for bedding for cotton, corn, or other drilled crops. In one single action the machine forms the bed, opens the drills, sows and covers the seed, in perfect order; also a device for distributing fertilizers may be attached, which, with the work as above described, will save the labor of tit least ten men and mules, as compared with the old method.\n\nIn chopping cotton the machine executes the work of from twelve to fifteen men, cutting out the young plants with uniformity, and imparting a thorough surface cultivation; and can be used for the cultivation of cotton, corn, sugar-cane, peas and potatoes, etc. The machine is a marvel of mechanical skill, one of the greatest labor-saving implements that can be used by agriculturists, and is meeting with large sales.\n\nThe Curry Cotton Compress. - The first working model was constructed and erected by Captain Curry at Huntsville, in the fall of 1885. This machine, although crudely made, when tested demonstrated the success of Captain Curry's theory, as bales of cotton of 500 lb weight upon this experimental machine were compressed to a density of twenty-four pounds to the cubic foot; soon thereafter a company was organized to manufacture the compresses, and a contract was made with W. P. Calahan & Co., of Dayton, Ohio, in December, 1886. The first working machine was erected at Huntsville, and there thoroughly tested in compressing several thousand bales of the crop of 1886. It was then sold to Landman & Co., cotton buyers of Huntsville. Ala., and has been continuously operated by them, and has stood the severest tests, meeting every requirement of railroads and export shippers. Other presses of this pattern, but greatly improved in material and construction have been erected by the Curry Press Company at Holly Springs and Florence. The average density of bales compressed by these machines is twenty-eight pounds to the cubic foot. The presses, from their efficiency, durability and cheapness in cost and great economy in expense of operating, have attracted great interest toward them. These presses cost about one-fourth the price of the steam compresses now in use, and will run ten hours, consuming only about one ton of coal.\n\nCaptain Curry has also invented a Portable Hay Press, which is remarkable for its simplicity and efficiency. This press is portable, of light draft, can be traveled through the meadow between the winrows or shocks of hay, making bales as it goes. The power is attached to and is a part of this machine, and therefore, unlike other portable hay presses, does not require to be set up in the field, but travels through to its work. Captain Curry is also the inventor and patentee of fruit (cider and wine) presses, tobacco and cheese presses, and of several other mechanical appliances.\n\nCaptain Curry was married March 9, 1865, to Miss Bettie Hammond, daughter of Judge F. L. Hammond, of Huntsville.\n\nTwo children have been born to them: F. L. Hammond Curry and Anna Lamar Curry.

He was the Daniel Boone of Alabama, and of the Gulf States; and in many respects was the superior of the Kentucky backwoods man. Born in Rockbridge County, Virginia, in 1772, his parents removed to the south-western part of the State three years after, and there his father engaged in the thrilling scenes of that day. In 1784 the family removed to what is now Greene County, Georgia, then the frontier of that State. The parents soon died, and left eight children to the care of Samuel, the eldest, a youth of sixteen years. He kept up the farm, but found time to engage in much of the border warfare with the Muscogees. He saw service under the famous Capt. Jonas Fauche, and distinguished himself by his prowess. At the peace, he became a trader, and resided for some time in Jones County, Georgia. He heard Tecumseh's war speech at Tookabatchee, during one of his trading excursions. About the year 1810 he settled in Clarke County, this State, and in 1813 led a company from the county into the skirmish at Burnt Corn, where he was painfully wounded. He was a participant in the bloody \"Canoe Fight\", where he acted with his usual daring and prowess. Shortly after, he followed Gen. Claiborne to Econochaca, as captain of a company in Major Smoot's battalion, and took part in the fight. He also commanded a battalion in Col. Russell's expedition to the Cahaba old towns. Soon after the peace of Fort Jackson, he came to reside in Monroe, where he established a farm. He was for a short time in service under Gen. Jackson when that officer was sent to quell the turbulent Seminoles, and when the outrages of \"Savannah Jack\" in what is now Butler county caused great alarm throughout the new State, he marched promptly to the assistance of the settlers. From the time that he came into Alabama to the day that he left it, Gen. Dale was regarded as the right arm of the frontiersman; ever ready to pilot the immigrant to his new home, and to stand between him and \"the buskined warrior of the wood.\" The people of Monroe loved and honored him, and eight times elected him to the legislature between 1819 and 1830. The legislature of the State also recognized his services by appropriating to him the half-pay of a colonel, and the rank of brigadier general whenever he should be called into active service, but the latter was repealed shortly after its enactment. About the year 1830 Gen. Dale removed to Perry County, and remained there about a year, then settled in Lauderdale county, Mississippi. He was the first representative of that county in the legislature of the State, in 1836, and died there, at Daleville, May 23, 1841. The events of his remarkable career are preserved in a handsome volume, from the graceful pen of Hon. J. F. H. Claiborne of Mississippi. They read more like the exploits of a fabulous hero of a past age than like the deeds of one whose modest men but stalwart frame many of the older citizens of south Alabama have looked upon, and it is quite certain that some of them are colored by fancy. He was, however, remarkable for caution and coolness in desperate emergencies, for exhibitions of gigantic personal strength, and his story is studded over with spirit-stirring incidents, unsurpassed by anything in legend or history. His celebrated \"canoe fight\" where, on the Alabama river, he, with Smith and Austill, fought nine warriors with clubbed rifles, killed them all, and rowed to shore, would be thought fabulous if it had not been witnessed by many soldiers standing on the banks who could render them no assistance. In the zenith of his manhood Gen. Dale was erect, muscular, and over six feet in height. His strength, activity, and endurance were surprising. And, like Bertram of Risinghame, his was \"the sharpened ear, the piercing eye, the quick resolve when danger's nigh.\" He felt the disadvantages of his want of education and was diffident of his opinion in other than practical matters, as he was habitually taciturn in those. His friendships were strong, his feelings ardent, and no one was more unselfish and benevolent. The Indians revered as much as they feared him, and he was looked upon by them with admiration and confidence. The story of Mr. Claiborne, however, is somewhat apocryphal that a Chocta chief stood over the grave of the border hero, a day or two after his death, and exclaimed, \"You sleep here, Big Sam, but your spirit is a chieftain and a brave in the hunting grounds of the sky.\" Nevertheless, Gen. Dale deserves to head the list of those whose iron wills and stalwart arms have fashioned States out of the wilderness, and his name must ever stand conspicuous in the annals of Alabama. A county in the State has been named in his honor.

Heard is one of Shiloh’s prosperous merchants, but was born in Perry county, Ala., November 17, 1835, a brother of Hon. W.W. Heard. The advantages which were afforded him in youth for obtaining an education were quite limited and at the age of fifteen years he accompanied his parents to Louisiana, from which time until the opening of the Civil war he was engaged in planting. On April 21, 1861, he enlisted in the Vienna rifles, Second Louisiana regiment, and reported for duty to the Army of Virginia, under General Jackson, and was so severely wounded in the knee at the battle of Gettysburg that he was afterward unfitted for active service. Upon returning from the war he attended school for one year, then accepted a position in a mercantile house in Shiloh, which position he retained for about four years. In 1869 he established an independent mercantile house on a very limited capital and has given this business his full time and attention. He has prospered far beyond his expectations and now does a business of immense proportions and a very satisfactory one financially. His brother, T.A. Heard, has been associated in business with him for the past three years, under the firm name of J.W. Heard & Brother. They are live and prosperous business men, shrewd and practical in their views and have always been noted for their honorable business methods and their desire to please their patrons. J.W.

Houston, physician and Surgeon, was born in Iredell County, N. C, December 22, 1826, and is a son of James H. and Sarah (Lee) Houston, natives of that State. The two grandfathers of our subject were soldiers in the Revolutionary War. James Kerr, his mother's father, took part in the battle at Ramsour's Mills, N. C, and James Houston, his grandfather was commander of a company at that battle, and was severely wounded. He lived to a good old age, to tell of the event to his numerous grandchildren. In the same battle Mrs. Houston's great-grandfather was killed while leading his command as captain. Dr. Eph. Bravard, who wrote the Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence of 20th of May, 1775, Charlotte, N. C, was the uncle of his grandmother Houston. Our subject's father was a farmer and merchant, and died in 1826. His widow afterward married Maj. W. Lee Davidson, the son of Gen. Wm. Davidson, who was killed at Cowan's Ford, on February 1, 1781, during the Revolutionary War. They both lived to a good old age, and died some years ago. James H. Houston, like most other boys, received his preliminary education at his home, but completed it at Davidson College, in his native State. He then studied medicine in the office of Dr. John McClean, in Newton County, N. C, and subsequently entered the University of Pennsylvania, at Philadelphia. In 1848, he began the practice of his profession in his native county, and remained there eight years. In 1856, he came to Uniontown, [Ala] where he has had an unbroken practice, with the exception of the time spent in the war. Dr. Houston entered the Confederate service as Assistant Surgeon of Beulah Battery, and was stationed part of the time at Savannah, Ga., and maintained his connection with the command until the war was brought to a close. He took part in a number of severe battles, and fortunately escaped unhurt. He returned to Uniontown and immediately resumed his practice, which has been a very successful one. He belongs to the best class of people in the State, and is regarded by his brother physicians as an adornment to the profession which he has followed for so many years with success. He belongs to the State Medical Association and the County Medical Society, and has been officially connected with both.\n\nDr. Houston has been Superintendent of Education in Perry County, and Postmaster at Uniontown, and, in both positions, discharged the duties devolving upon him with marked credit to himself and to the satisfaction of the people. He was married in 1849, to Miss Mary J., daughter of Absey and Isabella (Falls) Simonton, of Statesville, N. C.

Samuel Will John was born at Uniontown, Perry county, Ala., June 29, 1845. His father, Joseph Reed, son of Abel John, was a native of Mecklenburg county, N. C, and a descendant of signers of the Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence. He represented Perry county in the State legislature, and was chancellor 1863-65. Chancellor John was a lawyer of profound learning and a citizen of highest worth. He lived in Selma from 1856 until his death. His mother, Rosa Jane Smith, is descended from a signer of the Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence. Col. Samuel Will John was educated in the private academy of Robert Lewis in Selma, and joined Company F, Third Alabama regiment of cavalry, Col. James Hagan, at the outbreak of the war; but after serving a year, he returned to school on account of his youth, and was graduated from the University of Alabama in 1865. He read law under his father, and was admitted to practice before the Supreme court of Alabama, in 1866, on the day he reached his majority. In the legislature of Alabama he represented Dallas county, 1882-83, 1884-85, 1886-87, and Jefferson county, 1894-95. In 1885 he organized the Third regiment of Alabama State troops, and was elected its colonel. In 1896 he was elected Democratic elector from the State at large, and voted for William Jennings Bryan. He was for a number of years a trustee of the Alabama Bryce Insane hospital; and is now a trustee of Alabama Girls Industrial school at Montevallo. He was one of the members of the Alabama history commission. He takes a deep interest in the newly established department of archives and history of Alabama, of which he is the trustee from the ninth Congressional district. He is a member of the Birmingham Bar association, and also of the Alabama State Bar association. He is a Knight Templar, a Mason, a Democrat, a member of the Ancient Order of United Workmen, and of the Methodist Episcopal Church South. Col. John's record as a lawyer, legislator and citizen has been remarkable. As a lawyer he ranks among the first of the State; as a legislator he was active and wise. He was in full sympathy with laws for the reformation of the convict system; drew the bill which, with some changes, was passed by the legislature. He was the author of the Dallas jury law, by which the best possible juries are secured; of the law providing for an examiner of public accounts; of the law of employer's liability; of the law fixing the rights of married women; of the law which makes the State treasury the depository of all State funds, thus forcing State officers who handle the State's money to forward the revenues to the treasury, through which payment and distribution are made of the school funds; of the law which established an experiment station at Uniontown; of the law creating the experiment station at the Agricultural and Mechanical college at Auburn; and of the law making gambling a felony in the State. He was chairman of the judiciary committee of the house of representatives, 1886-87, 1894-95. He was chairman of the joint legislative committee on the codification of the laws of Alabama. He, with Dr. Benj. H. Riggs, started the movement resulting in the establishment of the Selma water works, and the system of sanitary sewers for Selma.

His paternal grandfather, Malcolm McAlpine, and wife, nee Mary Smith, emigrated to America before the evolution and settled on the line of what are now Robertson and Cumberland counties, North Carolina. They had eleven sons and one daughter, among the elder of whom was John, the father of William K. John McAlpine was born in North Carolina and there passed his entire life, being a farmer of small means but of industrious habits and good repute.\n\nThe mother of William K. McAlpine bore the maiden name of Susanna Anderson and was of English parentage, being a native of Georgetown district, South Carolina. John McAlpine died at a comparatively early age, leaving his widow with nine children to provide for, next to the youngest of whom was the subject of this sketch. He was born in Richmond county. North Carolina, in 1822, and was there reared, growing up on the farm and receiving very limited educational advantages. At the age of nineteen he started West to seek his fortune, his destination being the home of his paternal uncle, Dugald McAlpine, in Alabama. This uncle subsequently moving to Texas, William K. also came on to this State and took up his residence with him in Grimes county, in 1851. In April, 1853, William K. McAlpine married Miss Sarah J. Perry, a daughter of Dr. D. A. Perry, of Washington county, Texas, and settling on a farm in Washington county, was successfully engaged in agricultural pursuits until the opening of the war. When the call was made by his State for volunteers for the Confederate army he responded by enlisting in Company C, Twentieth (Ellmore's) Regiment of Infantry, of which he subsequently became Adjutant, and served in the defense of the coast country of Texas. He took part in the celebrated battle of Galveston. January 1, 1863, but with the exception of this engagement, saw but little active field service.\n\nAfter the war, in the spring of 1867, Mr. McAlpine gathered together all his available means, and, moving to Galveston, he engaged in business as a cotton factor, and was so engaged until 1886, when, having accumulated a competency, he retired. During his business career of twenty years in this city, he established a reputation as a man of sound financial ability, having not only amassed some wealth for himself, but having helped to develop a number of Galveston's business enterprises, with some of which his name is still connected as director. Mr. McAlpine's life, so far as seeking \"the bubble, reputation \" is concerned, has been of the most unassuming nature. He has never held even the office of alderman of his ward, though by no means lacking in public spirit or proper appreciation of the duties of good citizenship. He simply has not cared for the honors of office, and, having always found his own business sufficiently remunerative to afford him proper means of support, with some surplus for investment, he has kept out of politics.\n\nIn 1885 Mr. McAlpine lost his wife, her death occurring at their home in Galveston. Her remains were buried in the old family burying-ground in Grimes county, where rest those of his mother, who came to Texas after the removal of her sons here, and died there in 1872. Mr McAlpine has one brother, John, and two uncles, Dugald and Malcolm McAlpine, also buried in Grimes county, and one brother, Franklin McAlpine, still living there, all of whom came to Texas in the '50s, and settled in that county. His uncle, Dugald McAlpine, was a well-to-do and highly respected farmer of Grimes county for many years. Most of the paternal uncles of William K. McAlpine - ten in number - settled in Alabama and Mississippi early in this century, and there they subsequently lived and died, several of them serving in the frontier Indian wars, and one, Alexander, being with Jackson at New Orleans during the war of 1812-14.\n\nMr. McAlpine has raised a family of eight children, four daughters and four sons, most of them married and all residents of Texas, these being Mrs. J.

He remained in active service throughout the course of the war, and during the time was in a number of severe battles. Returning from the war, he located at Columbus, Miss., in 1865, where he began the jewelry business, and remained there six months. In the early part of 1866, he came to Uniontown, and began the same business, which he has enlarged by adding books and stationery. Mr. Welch has also been closely identified with the city government of Uniontown for a number of years. He was for more than eleven years a member of the city council, was city treasurer for several years, and served as tax assessor. In March, 1887, he was elected mayor of Uniontown, and has held the office ever since. He possesses many of the traits which would give one standing in any locality, for to the better instincts of the polished Christian gentleman, he adds the tact and adaptiveness of the business man of the world, a combination at once calculated to inspire confidence and esteem. It is needless to say that he has won such a standing among those with whom he has resided for so long a time.\n\nJohn C.
