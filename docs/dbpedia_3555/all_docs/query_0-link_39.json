Transcribed for TYR by Joan Hidle, July 2002.\n\nThis interesting old cemetery is located in a wooded area near the farm of Jimmie D. Woodfin, near the Hamburg Road. The cemetery is surrounded by what was once a very fine wrought-iron fence, which was made in Philadelphia. At one time a road ran to the side of the ancient burial ground, but now has become a part of the forest. Huge trees have uprooted the fence in places and pushed over stones. Nearly all of the stones are broken, and I am sure that some of them are buried in the leaves and were not copied.\n\nJ. K. C. & ridley )Ransom) Poole were originally from Johnson County, North Carolina. On February 4, 1822, he was one of seven commissioners appointed to select a site for the county seat of Perry county. His will can be found in the Probate Office of Perry County (see Perry County Wills). Next to his grave-stone there is another grave with an identical stone. I feel that this is the grave of Ridley Poole, but the stone has fallen, inscription down and I was unable to turn it.\n\nA son not buried in this cemetery was Ransom R. Poole, who married Susan Ivey. This couple had a son, Robert Ransom Poole, who was born near Uniontown on Feb. 9, 1853; later attended Greene Springs Academy and Howard College; and who was a planter at Faunsdale, Marengo County.\n\nOur Darling Little Sue / Mary Jefferson / daughter of / A.
