Three question marks “???” indicates that information is missing. The tilde “~” indicates an approximation. Names are bolded.\n\nAs you scroll down, each section is broken out by century starting in the 1000s all the way down to today at the bottom of the page.\n\nAt the end of the Last Glacial Maximum, 12,000 years ago, the sea levels around northern Europe were low enough for Stone Age hunter-gatherers to cross, on foot, into what are now the islands of Great Britain. Farming spread to the islands by about 4,000 B.C., and the Neolithic inhabitants erected their remarkable and puzzling stone monuments, including the famed Stonehenge.\n\nBeginning in about 2,500 B.C., successive waves of tribes settled in the region. These tribes are often termed ‘Celts’, however that term is an 18th century invention. The Celts were not a nation in any sense, but a widespread group of tribes that shared a common cultural and linguistic background.\n\nOriginating in central Europe, they spread to dominate most of western Europe, the British Isles and the Iberian Peninsula. Their dominance could not withstand the rise of the Roman Empire, however.\n\nAfter defeating the Celts of Gaul (modern-day France, Luxembourg, Belgium and western areas of Germany and Switzerland), the Romans invaded the British Isles in 43 A.D. Most of southern Britain was conquered and occupied over the course of a few decades and became the Roman province of Britannia. Hadrian’s Wall, in the north of England, marked the approximate extent of Roman control. Those clans who were not assimilated into the Roman Empire were forced to retreat to other areas that remained Celtic, such as Wales, Ireland, Scotland, the Isle of Man and Brittany. The Roman presence largely wiped out most traces of pre-existing culture in England—even replacing the language with Latin.\n\n1240-1249\n\nBlenkens-hope, Northumberland Co., England\n\nRanulph Blenkenishope\n\nIt was reckoned within the Nicholas de Boltby’s barony of Tindale in the time of Henry the third, and then holden of him by Ranulph de Blenkenishope by the socage tenure of the annual payment of half a mark. (f) Afterwards, the heiress of the Boltbys married Thomas de Multon, lord of Egermont, of whom, and his successors the Lucys, it was holden by the same tenure, and under the description of the monor or fee of Blenkensop.\n\nRev.

The “SHIP” suffix, meaning “sheep” in the Old Norse and Anglo-Saxon languages, would denote those of the “Blenkin” clan who engaged in raising sheep for a living.\n\nGrowing wheat and raising sheep were the two primary livelihoods of people living in northern England and southern Scotland since the time of the Roman conquest of this area.\n\nRalph Blankenship I b1600 in Northumberland, England.\n\nMary M.

His name is listed with 90 white persons and 70 Black persons as a headright of Richard Kennon in a pettion for an 8,000 acre land grant.\n\nRalph’s sea passage was paid for by Richard Kennon, an English aristocrat and representative to the Virgina House of Burgesses.\n\nDuring that era these sea passages across the Atlantic typically cost about 30 English pounds. Kennon was a wealthy merchant then living at Bermuda Hundred located about 15 miles south of Richmond.\n\nRalph presumable became an indentured servant to Kennon for five years. Viginia law dictated that if such servants were under nineteen years of age, they must be brought into Court, to have their Age adjudged; and from the age they are judged to be of, they had to work in servitude until they reached twenty-four. If they were adjudged upwards of nineteen, they were then only to be servants for a term of five years.\n\nRalph Blankenship, IV married Martha Clay in 1690.\n\nThey Henrico, Virginia, British Colonial America.

A “headright” includes both the grant of land and the owner (the head) that claims the land. The person who has a right to the land is the one who paid to transport people to a colony.\n\nHeadrights are most notable for their role in the expansion of the Thirteen Colonies; the Virginia Company gave headrights to settlers, and the Plymouth Company followed suit. Most headrights were for 1 to 1,000 acres (4.0 km2) of land, and were granted to those who were willing to cross the Atlantic and help populate the colonies. Headrights were granted to anyone who would pay for the transportation costs of an indentured laborer. These land grants consisted of 50 acres (0.20 km2) for someone newly moving to the area and 100 acres (0.40 km2) for people previously living in the area. This is consistent with Richard Cannon’s grant as he brought over 160 indendured servants x 50 acres for each one equals 8,000 acres.\n\nBy ensuring the landowning masters had legal ownership of all land acquired, the indentured laborers after their indenture period had passed had little opportunity to procure their own land. This kept a large portion of the citizens of the Thirteen Colonies poor and led to tensions between the laborers and the landowners.\n\n***\n\nThe Virginia Company founded the first permanent English colony at Jamestown in 1607.\n\nA series of conflicts regarding England’s governance during the years 1642 to 1651 is now known as The English Civil War. Charles I summoned supporters to join him against his enemies in Parliament. In October 1642, nearly 10,000 men fought for Charles I and chased Parliament across the River Tamar. Fighting continued for years and was finally ended at the Battle of Worcester on September 3, 1651, with a Parliamentarian victory.\n\nThe Glorious Revolution (1688–1689) brought the downfall of Catholic King James II and the reign of his Protestant daughter Mary and her Dutch husband, William III of Orange.\n\nFirst and only evidence of the surnames Blankenship and Blankinship in documented English history.\n\nElizabeth Hudson born 16 July 1704.\n\nIn America, Martha and Ralph Blankenship, IV lived one mile south (SSE) of present-day town of Chesterfield, VA.

It was primarily a struggle for dominance over the Ohio River Valley and the broader question of which national culture would dominate the heart of North America. The war concluded with the Treaty of Paris in 1763, where France ceded its territories in North America to Britain, marking the end of French colonial ambitions on the continent. The outcomes of the French and Indian War set the stage for the American Revolution by altering the balance of power in North America and straining British colonial relations.\n\nIsham Blankenship, Sr. married Sarah Elizabeth Wilkinson in 1756\n\nThey married in Chesterfield, Virginia, British Colonial America. They were the parents of at least 14 sons and 5 daughters, including William Blankenship, Sr.\n\nWilliam Blankenship, Sr. born 1761\n\nWhen William Blankenship, Sr. was born in Chesterfield, Virginia, British Colonial America, his father, Isham Blankenship Sr., was 21 and his mother, Sarah Elizabeth Wilkinson, was 22.\n\nAt the close of the French and Indian War (1763) Sarah and Isham Blankenship, Sr. moved from Chesterfield, VA to Bedford, VA, along with his Isham’s brother Hudson. Shortly after, they moved their family to Rutherford, North Carolina.\n\nThe American Revoutionary War started 19 April 1775 and ended 3 September 1763. Isham served as a private soldier in the Virginia Calvary/Contitntal Army.\n\nWilliam Blankenship, Sr. married Molly Trent on an unknown date in an unknown location.\n\nBeloved daughter of Frederick and Lydia Trent. Molly was the wife of William Blankenship. Their children were Zachariah Blankenship (1780–1850); Conley Blankenship (1782–1850); Obediah Blankenship (1784–1850); Solomon Blankenship (1786–unk); Henry Blankenship (1790–1865); William Blankenship Jr (1790–1835); William Andrew Blankenship (1790–1879); Virginia Blankenship (1792–1841); Presley Blankenship (1796–unk); Hezekiah Blankenship (1800–1842); Solomon Blankenship (1802–unk); Spencer Blankenship (1804-1880). After Molly’s death in childbirth, William remarried Mary Martha Riggins (1761–1807). They had one son, Isham Blankenship who was born and died with his mother in childbirth. William then married Anna Osborne (1792-1835), and their children were William Blankenship (1808–unk) and Barnett Blankenship (1811–1880). Find a Grave Biography\n\nWilliam Blankenship, Sr. married Mary Martha Riggins in 1779.\n\nThey married in Chesterfield County, Virginia, United States and were the parents of at least nine sons and one daughter.\n\nIsham Blankenship, Sr. lived in Franklin, Virginia, United States in 1786.\n\nIn June 1781, Lord Cornwallis’ British army was near the Blankinship homestead in Goochland County, Virginia. During the Revolutionary War, British troops destroyed many official records at the Henrico County Court House, which had moved to Richmond in 1752. Benedict Arnold’s army occupied Richmond in January 1781, prompting the Henrico County militia to defend against the invasion. The destruction of these records makes the few surviving documents validating Ralph Blankinship’s immigration to colonial Virginia particularly valuable. Remaining documents confirm Ralph and Martha Blankinship’s residence in Henrico County from about 1686 until Ralph’s death around April 1714.\n\nElizabeth Hudson 4/29/1789\n\nHezekiah “Kiah” Blankenship born 1792\n\nWhen Hezekiah Blankenship was born in Tazewell, Virginia, United States, his father, William Blankenship Sr., was 31 and his mother, Molly (Trent) Blankenship, was 27.\n\n<)- https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Blankenship-1676#_note-5\n\nNancy Bowling born 1800\n\nIsham Blankenship, Sr.‘s residence in 1800 was Morgan Rutherford, North Carolina.\n\nMolly (Trent) Blankenship died 1804 (age 39)\n\nMolly died in Pike, Kentucky, United States and is believed to be the mother of Hezekiah Blankenship.\n\nWilliam Blankenship, Sr. lived in Floyd, Kentucky, United States in 1810 and Chesterfield, Chesterfield, Virginia, United States in 1810.\n\nIsham Blankenship, Sr. died in 1810 (age 70)\n\nHe died in Cane Creek, Rutherford, North Carolina, United States and was buried in Blankenship Family Cemetery, Rutherfordton, Rutherford, North Carolina, United States.\n\nAn article written by Joseph W. Blankenship in 1917 corroborates Isham’s history. “Isham (or Isum), son of John, son of Ralph the Progenitor, married Sarah and, following his brother, Hudson, moved from the old home in Chesterfield county to Beford county at the close of the French and Indian war (1764) and purchased 570 acres of land “on the ridge between Tomahawk and Ivy creeks” and sold the same for $4,000 in 1779.”\n\nHezekiah Blankenship married Nancy Bowling 14 September 1815\n\nThey married in Tazewell, Virginia, United States.

The conflict began in earnest when Confederate forces fired on Fort Sumter in South Carolina on April 12, 1861. Over the next four years, the war saw numerous battles and significant loss of life, with approximately 625,000 soldiers dying, making it the deadliest conflict in American history.\n\nHezekiah Blankenship died 1863 (age 71).\n\nHezekiah served as a Private in the 8th Volunteer Cavalry, Confederate Army, in the U.S. Civil War.

It has been worn by retainers of the House of Percy and was adopted as the official tartan of the Duke of Northumberland’s piper in 1760. The tartan is also the official plaid for pipers of the Northumberland Fusiliers and is commonly worn by Northumbrian pipers today.\n\nThe Border tartan, also known as the Northumbrian tartan, or Northumberland tartan, is a design associated with the Anglo-Scottish Border region, particularly the Scottish Borders and Northumberland. It is also referred to as shepherds’ plaid, shepherds’ check, Border drab, or Border check. This tartan is characterized by a simple crossweave of small dark and light checks, making it much plainer than the more elaborate Scottish tartans.\n\nHistorically, the Border tartan was made using untreated sheep’s wool for the light squares and wool dyed with simple vegetable dyes, such as alder bark or water flag, for the darker squares. Modern versions typically feature a bold black and white check pattern. However, historically, the light squares were a yellowish color of untreated wool, and the dark squares could be a range of dark greys, blues, greens, or browns, leading to the name “Border drab.”\n\nFragments of similar tartans have been found in Great Britain and Jutland, indicating the antiquity of this design. Notably, a fragment known as the Falkirk tartan or Falkirk sett was discovered at the Antonine Wall in Falkirk, Scotland. This fragment dates back to Roman Britain times, around the 3rd century AD, and is considered more of a tweed than a tartan in weaving style. It is preserved in the National Museum of Scotland.\n\nLeroy Bennett Blankenship born 31 July 1901\n\nWhen Leroy Bennett Blankenship was born in Cullman, Alabama, United States, his father, Floyd Walter Blankenship, was 21 and his mother, Linda Bert Brown, was 20.\n\n<)- https://ancestors.familysearch.org/en/LRQJ-3WF/leroy-bennett-blankenship-1901-1990\n\nDontis Marie Morgan born 1905\n\nShe was the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. George S.

Any children attached to him after that time are suspect. Sarah Vest Turney had several children with the Blankenship last name and some had the Turney last name in earlier census records (1860 and 1870) but it is supected that these children were biological Blankenships and possibly belonged to one of her cousins who was killed in the Civil War.\n\nJames Alfred Blankenship married the niece of Daniel Turney, Sarah Ann Barnes.
