Member of the House of Burgess.

Richard Kennon, or Cannon as the name was pronounced and sometimes spelled, was a merchant resident at Bermuda Hundred as early as 1680. In 1685, he was factor and attorney for Mr. William Paggen, a merchant of London, who had extensive trade with Virginia. To provide his storehouse at Bermuda, Kennon visited England repeatedly. He married Elizabeth Worsham, daughter of William Worsham and Elizabeth, his wife. (Henrico Co. Records.) His mother-in-law married 2dly Lt. Col. Francis Eppes (son of Lt. Col. Francis Eppes, the immigrant). In a grant of land to Mr. Francis Eppes in 1680 the latter was allowed to count Richard Kennon 8 times. It was the policy of Virginia at that time to encourage immigration by allowing 50 acres for every time a person passed to Virginia, and it would seem from this grant that Kennon crossed the ocean as many as eight times prior to 1680. He was justice for Henrico in 1680 and 1683. In 1686 Capt. William Randolph and Mr. Richard Kennon were paid as burgesses for 32 days. In 1686 (June 1), he made a power of attorney to his brither-in-law, Mr. John Worsham. The preamble of the deed states that he was then about to sail again to Europe. In 1691 he made a deed of gift to his children Mary, Elizabeth, Martha, William and Sarah. His will was proved in Henrico Co., August 20, 1696.

Hotten's "Original Lists of Emigrants" shows that the ship Truelove of London,sailed from Gravesend on June 10, 1635, bound for Bermuda; the passenger list includes the names of "Richard Canon, 24 years" and uxor: "Elizabeth Canon 23 years", and it is very probable that they were the emigrant ancestors of the Kennon family.

No known record shows the presence of Richard and Elizabeth Canon in Bermuda after the 1635 voyage; but as early as 1637 a surgeon of the name, Richard Kennon was living in Lower Norfolk County, Virginia. The county records contain the proceedings, "At a court holden, the Lower County of Norfolk the 10th January 1637 - Whereas it doth appear that William Julian doth stand indebted unto Richard Kennon, chircurgeon, in the quantity of 700 weight of tobacco in leaf. It is therefore ordered that the afore said William Julian shall, within ten days after the date hereof, pay the afore said sum of tobacco or else execution to be awarded.
