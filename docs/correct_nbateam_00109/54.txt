INDIANAPOLIS — Zach Randolph had 34 points and 16 rebounds to help the Los Angeles Clippers beat the shorthanded Indiana Pacers 117-109 in double overtime on Friday night.

Al Thornton scored 25 points, Marcus Camby had 20 points and 10 rebounds and Baron Davis had 18 points and 11 assists for the Clippers, who have won four of five after a 4-17 start.

Jarrett Jack scored a season-high 27 points, T.J. Ford scored 17 and Rasho Nesterovic and Roy Hibbert each scored 16 for the Pacers.

Indiana tipped off missing four of its usual starters. Danny Granger, Troy Murphy and Marquis Daniels were in the hospital with viral infections, and Ford didn’t start because of a sore left groin.
