Zach Randolph, now cooperating in the investigation of his brother, will not be charged with lying to police.

Randolph, 23, initially was accused of misleading police officers investigating his younger brother’s involvement in the shooting of three men at a night club. Roger Randolph has been charged with three felony counts of battery with a deadly weapon in connection with the shootings. If convicted, he could receive six to 24 years in prison.

The Blazers no longer seem interested in offering Zach Randolph a contract extension after his latest off-court incident.

“It’s safe to say we are concerned about players’ character,” GM John Nash said. “And this certainly doesn’t enhance one’s value.” Randolph could face criminal charges for misleading police officers investigating his brother’s involvement in an early-morning shooting near Randolph’s hometown of Marion, Ind., on Sunday. “I love the player, and I like the individual, because I truly believe he has a good heart,” Nash said. “But I am concerned that these types of things continue to happen.”

Zach Randolph was fined for missing a team flight on Saturday and had to pay for his own ticket.

Nice. What a thoughtful way to honor your team after they put the next ten years in your hands with a $75 million contract. At least there were no drugs or firearms involved in this one. The greatest part was when Zach said “I can’t help it if the alarm clock doesn’t go off. Stuff like that happens. Hey, I’m here now.” Yeah, missing a plane isn’t that big a deal, but when you combine it with all the other problems Zach and his teammates have, it is just another notch in the belt.

The failure of Portland to rise above a .500 team keeps coming back, in comments from media, fans, teammates, and coaches, to Zach Randolph.

This week, Randolph’s stand-still, don’t-pass, shoot-first nature drew criticism from Nick Van Exel and Maurice Cheeks. “I don’t want to make it like it’s all Zach Randolph,” coach Maurice Cheeks said. " But he is one of our main guys, and we have to try and get to him, to reach him, about the right way to play, because when we reach him, we reach other players.” With Damon Stoudamire’s troubles, and teammates saying publicly that Shareef Abdur-Rahim’s presence clogs the middle and hurts Theo Ratliff’s value, it’s a wonder the Blazers have done as well as they have.

Zach Randolph could face a criminal charge of providing misleading information to police officers in the wake of Sunday’s shooting that resulted in the arrest of his brother, Roger Randolph.

“I think there’s a good chance Zach Randolph is going to be charged with a crime,” Rodney Cummings, Madison County prosecutor, told The Associated Press on Monday. “I would certainly say he’s being investigated for false informing or assisting a criminal.” Cummings said Randolph told investigators he did not know who fired the shots that hit three men inside a bar. Other witnesses said Zach was holding his brother while Roger Randolph did the shooting.

Zach Randolph said he would not play Wednesday at Indiana so he can give his knee extended rest over the All-Star break.

Randolph missed Monday’s game. Since Maurice Cheeks never indicated his lineup was based on Randolph’s health, his role will still be unclear once play resumes.

Zach Randolph is expected to play tonight after missing the past two games with a sore right knee.

Randolph said the knee, while not 100 percent, feels much better after resting it during the All-Star break. This has to be a relief to Randolph owners, though coach Maurice Cheeks continues to say that Randolph, Darius Miles, and Shareef Abdur-Rahim will come off the bench.
