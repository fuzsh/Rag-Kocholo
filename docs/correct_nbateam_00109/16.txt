LOS ANGELES — Zach Randolph had 26 points and 15 rebounds against his former team, and the Memphis Grizzlies overcame the first-quarter ejection of shooting guard Tony Allen to

beat the Los Angeles Clippers 106-102

on Monday night in a rematch of their first-round playoff series.

Marc Gasol had 23 points, nine rebounds and eight assists to help put the Grizzlies (6-5) over .500 for the first time this season. Mike Conley scored eight of his 15 points during a 4-minute span of the fourth quarter.

Blake Griffin had 23 points and 11 rebounds for the Clippers. Paul had 18 points and 11 assists for his 11 straight double-double, the most by any player from the start of a season since Magic Johnson in 1990-91.

Allen was charged with a flagrant-2 foul with 1:51 left in the opening quarter after he lifted his left leg in a vain attempt to impede Paul's drive to the basket and kicked him in the face. Allen walked over to Paul at the foul line to apologize while referees Bill Kennedy, Mark Ayotte and John Goble watched the replay at the official scorer's table to determine the severity of the foul.

TRAIL BLAZERS 108, NETS 98

NEW YORK (AP) — LaMarcus Aldridge scored 27 points, Wesley Matthews added 24 and Portland earned its seventh straight victory.

Damian Lillard finished with 19 points and nine assists as the Trail Blazers withstood the Nets' blistering start to win seven in a row in the same season for the first time since a 13-game run in December 2007.

Portland (9-2) is just a half-game behind San Antonio and Indiana for the NBA's best record. The Blazers will try to complete a perfect 4-0 road trip Wednesday at Milwaukee.

Shaun Livingston scored 23 points for the Nets, who stormed out to their best first quarter of the season and then seemed to run out of gas against the younger Trail Blazers. Kevin Garnett made all six shots in the 40-point first period, then went 2 for 13 from there to finish with a season-high 16 points.

BULLS 86, BOBCATS 81

CHICAGO (AP) — Luol Deng scored 21 points and the Bulls overcame a rough shooting night to record their fifth straight win.

Carlos Boozer had 12 points and 17 rebounds for Chicago, which is on its longest winning streak since taking eight in a row from Feb. 20-March 7, 2012. Jimmy Butler had 14 points and Derrick Rose finished with 12.

Deng's 3-pointer with 27.1 seconds remaining gave the Bulls an 85-81 lead. Gerald Henderson then missed for the Bobcats, and Rose had a free throw to help Chicago wrap it up.

Rose, who hit a career-high six 3-pointers in the Bulls' 110-94 win Saturday over Indiana, went 4 for 13 from the field. The Bulls shot 27 of 75 (36 percent) overall.

Jeffery Taylor led Charlotte with a career-high 20 points and Henderson had 16.

THUNDER 115, NUGGETS 113

OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — Kevin Durant scored 38 points, Russell Westbrook had 30 points and 12 rebounds and Oklahoma City rallied for the win.

Westbrook also had seven assists in a terrific all-around game that helped Oklahoma City erase a 14-point deficit in the second half. Reggie Jackson added 14 points.

With the score tied at 105, Serge Ibaka pulled down an offensive rebound and found Durant for a 3-pointer that put Oklahoma City (7-3) ahead to stay. Jeremy Lamb and Derek Fisher each hit a pair of free throws in the final 14 seconds to help the Thunder hold on.

Ty Lawson led Denver (4-6) with 29 points and eight assists. J.J. Hickson had 18 points and 19 rebounds.

MAVERICKS 97, 76ERS 94

DALLAS (AP) — Monta Ellis scored 24 points, including 13 in the third quarter when Dallas took its first lead.

Dirk Nowitzki and Shawn Marion had 20 points apiece for the Mavericks, who began a stretch of seven of nine games in Dallas. Nowitzki had 10 rebounds, and Marion chipped in seven.

Ellis had 19 points in the second half and added a game-high 10 assists and two of Dallas' 11 blocked shots.

Two nights after a 35-point loss in New Orleans, the Sixers held the Mavericks scoreless for the first 5 minutes and led by 10 in the first half.

Even after losing its lead for good late in the third quarter, Philadelphia stayed close behind Evan Turner, Tony Wroten and some late 3-pointers from James Anderson.

Turner had 26 points, nine rebounds and seven assists while Wroten had 19 points and five steals.

WARRIORS 98, JAZZ 87

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Stephen Curry scored 22 points for Golden State, and Klay Thompson and Harrison Barnes had 17 apiece in the Warriors' victory.

Curry had eight assists and made four 3-pointers before leaving in the fourth quarter after Utah's Marvin Williams landed on his head in a scramble for a loose ball. After a couple of minutes to gain his bearings, Curry got up and left the court under his own power with a towel draped over his head.

Curry is expected to be ready for Wednesday's home game against Memphis.

The Warriors made 12 of 22 attempts from 3-point range and led by as many as 28 points.

Gordon Hayward scored 18 points and Williams had 16 but the Jazz (1-11) dropped their third straight after earning their lone win of the season.
