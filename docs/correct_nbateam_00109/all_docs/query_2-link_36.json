        "text": "Randolph put together a 30-point, 13-rebound performance that guided the Grizzlies to a 95-83 victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder in Game 6 of their Western Conference semifinal Friday night in FedExForum. Memphis tied the series 3-3, and will play the deciding game Sunday at Oklahoma City for a chance to meet the Dallas Mavericks in the conference final. Randolph had been limited to 31-percent shooting over the previous four games. This time, he made 12 of 22 shots and scored 12 points in the fourth quarter as the Grizzlies pulled away. “He never fails,” Griz guard O.J. Mayo said. “He’s played so many incredible games. He’s carried us down the stretch so many times. He just never fails.”\n\nRandolph grew up fatherless. Decision-making off the court wasn’t his strong suit. “The mother can only do so much. When you don’t have that man guidance around, you tend to get it from other places, from guys out in the neighborhood, guys with the nicest car, who got money in his pocket,” says Randolph, a father of three. “Not having the father figure to tell you that you can’t hang out with these guys or you can’t be on the corner … it’s a lot different when you don’t have a male figure around in your life.”\n\nAs he walks past the shops, bars and restaurants along Beale Street, Randolph doesn’t refuse to provide an autograph. He stops for every photo request. He shakes every hand that reaches out. Randolph, often referred to as Z-Bo, nods and replies “Yes, sir,” to an elder who advises him on playing the Thunder. “I love it, man,” says Randolph, the only NBA player to average at least 20 points and 10 rebounds in each of the last three seasons. “I want to finish my career out here. (I want to) be a Memphian.”\n\nHe found trouble, and vice versa. He punched a teammate at practice. There were more than a few incidents involving guns with his “Hoop Family” acquaintances, including his brother Roger. Randolph never was convicted of any felonies, but his name still is synonymous with trouble and dysfunction in Portland. “They were called ‘Jail Blazers’ before he got there. It was a tough environment for him,” says Michigan State coach Tom Izzo, who was disappointed that Randolph was drafted by a franchise that lacked mentors for a 19-year-old. “People got to know how to deal with Zach. He’s a lot different than people assume. … They say he was the wrong player for (the Blazers)? Maybe they were the wrong people for him.”"
