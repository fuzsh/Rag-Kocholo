        "text": "The five most interesting stories, rumors and notes in the NBA:\n\n1. Boarding and leading:\n\nThere are a lot of notable story lines in the first month-plus of the 2012-13 season, but the most interesting is surely in Memphis, where the Grizzlies will enter their Friday game at New Orleans with the\n\n.\n\nMemphis hasn't just fattened up against inferior teams. It also has wins over three of the other top early teams -- the Knicks, Heat and Thunder.\n\nIt's a significant change for a franchise that -- despite having very good teams in recent seasons -- has only\n\n, the Associated Press' Clay Bailey reports.\n\nCoach Lionel Hollins -- who won the season's first Western Conference Coach of the Month award -- says his team has been helped by its early schedule, with 10 home games and no road trips longer than two games so far.\n\n\"We've come together as a team, Hollins said. \"We've matured. As to how and why we started quicker? It probably has a lot to do with scheduling.\"\n\nThe Grizzlies have excelled with a balanced attack, with\n\n. But it's hard not to notice the numbers for forward Zach Randolph, who is averaging 17.7 points and 13.3 rebounds.\n\nRandolph has 14 double-doubles this season, tying Cleveland's Anderson Varejao for the league lead, and is coming off an\n\non Tuesday -- surely the best all-around game of the young season by any player. Randolph had 38 points, 22 rebounds and (of all things) three blocks and shot 15 for 22 from the field and 8 for 8 from the free throw line.\n\nRandolph was dominant late, getting 16 points and seven rebounds and shooting 7 for 8 in the fourth quarter and OT. By the end, fans in FedExForum engulfed Randolph in a\n\n\"Z-Bo! Z-Bo!\"\n\nchant. According to the Elias Sports Bureau,\n\nin a game (along with Dwight Howard), the Commercial Appeal's Ronald Tillery reports.\n\nThe performance comes in a season in which\n\n, to have him do more passing out of the post. Randolph, though, has done what he used to in Portland, when Maurice Cheeks didn't run plays for him, and he simply went to work on the boards. Randolph is on pace to set career highs for rebounds and offensive rebounds -- he is averaging 5.0 per game.\n\nRandolph's former Blazers teammate Damon Stoudamire -- a former Grizzlies assistant who is now an assistant coach at the University of Memphis -- tells Tillery that\n\n.\n\n\"He's trying to be a leader,\" Stoudamire tells Tillery. \"It's amazing. Zach's never tried to be a leader, man. I'm not saying it in a bad way. He's just trying to do some things bestowed upon him. Guys took him under their wing as a youngster and he's doing that now. He's done a great job of leading. You can tell. And he needed to be the voice on that team.\"\n\nRandolph, who made the All-Star Game in 2009-10, could benefit from the league's change in the All-Star ballot that eliminates center as a specific position. The\n\n-- Kevin Love, Blake Griffin, LaMarcus Aldridge, a resurgent Tim Duncan, David Lee, to start. But with automatic center spots out of the picture, if enough coaches stick with the credo of rewarding teams with better records, Randolph should have a reasonable chance to make his second All-Star Game.\n\n2. Trying to Gasol-ve Lakers:\n\nA popular thing among NBA experts and not-so-experts is tossing out trade scenarios for the Lakers' Pau Gasol, whose slow start (12.6 points -- which would be a career low by almost five) has turned him into a scapegoat for the team's struggles.\n\nCBSSports.com's Ken Berger writes that league executives believe the\n\n, with Andrea Bargnani and Jose Calderon going to L.A. Bargnani is one of those 7-footers who gets criticized for being perimeter-oriented, and his career 4.9 rebounding average is Exhibit A.\n\nBut ... he is a tremendous shooter who has made more than 1,500 three-pointers in his NBA career and could conceivably complement Dwight Howard.\n\nThere might be a sticking point on any deal involving Gaosl, however. Comcast's Ric Bucher reports that Steve Nash, before agreeing to sign the contract that made his trade to the Lakers possible,\n\n.\n\nESPN adds that the\n\n. The two teams who have tried to engage the Lakers in Gasol talks, ESPN adds, are the Raptors and Timberwolves, who continue their seemingly manic tinkering, apparently offering Derrick Williams and Nikola Pekovic to try to put Gasol next to fellow Spaniard Ricky Rubio.\n\n3. Pelicans brief:\n\nPersonally, I love the choice of\n\n, as first reported by Yahoo's Marc Spears.\n\nYeah, the name is cool and fresh, but more than anything, I appreciate that it is a plural nickname, and not one of those annoying singular nicknames that forces writers to break grammatical rules -- Jazz, Crew and most the WNBA (Storm, Shock, Fever, etc., etc.).\n\nWhen I first started doing this, our style at The Oregonian was to treat singular nickname as just that, the same as when referring to a team by its city. So a sentence would go, \"The Jazz is not playing well.\" But this conflicted with the Associated Press Stylebook, which dictated that such nicknames be treated as plurals, so, \"The Jazz are not playing well.\"\n\nSomewhere along the line, we changed to conform to AP style, but those habits are hard to break.\n\nOne interesting thing about Pelicans as a nickname is that we already have a school in Oregon that uses it. Klamath Union High School in Klamath Falls was founded in 1901, and although the\n\ndoesn't make clear when the nickname was established, we do know that the mascot, Pelican Pete, originated during the 1928-29 school year.\n\nBut the \"Pelicans\" connection to New Orleans is even older. Spears writes: \"Louisiana is the Pelican State. The brown pelican is the state bird and appears on the state flag and seal, and official state painting. Moreover, the Pelicans played minor league baseball in New Orleans in all but nine seasons from 1887-1959 and in 1977.\"\n\nPlus, as Pelican Pete shows, this is a bird that is ripe for a mascot that kids would love.\n\n4. Satisfaction guaranteed:\n\nPhoenix officials are hopeful that the Suns' game against Dallas tonight will sell out. The Suns are returning from a 1-5 road trip that included a 40-point loss to Detroit, so the circumstances might not seem ripe for what would be the first sellout at US Airways Center this season.\n\nAh, but the team's front office has come up with a gimmick that could lure fans. The\n\n, with fans allowed to get their money back if they are not happy with the experience, the Arizona Republic's Bob Young reports.\n\nIs that a little pressure on the players? Team president Jason Rowley gives the team room to spin a mass refund run, saying he wants fans to judge the total experience, not just the basketball.\n\n\"If we win and perform well, but somebody has a bad experience or they’re unhappy with anything, they can get their money back,\" Rowley tells Young. \"If the beer is flat or the hot dog is cold or they don’t feel like they were treated well when they walked through the door or weren’t helped to find their seat, that’s all part of it.\"\n\nThe Suns, during the heyday of Nash, averaged 18,422 fans (the capacity of US Airways Center) for three straight seasons starting in 2006-07. But in the tried-and-true fashion of all pro sports, attendance has dipped as the team's record has fallen, and\n\nthis season, ranking No. 23 in the league.\n\n5. The lemonade:\n\nIt was hard not to feel bad for Mike Brown, who was fired as Lakers coach five games into the season, but there's no need at all to feel sorry for him.\n\nFor one thing, the Lakers still owe him about $10 million. Also, the firing has been a blessing in disguise in at least one way. In an interview with the L.A. Times' Mike Bresnahan,\n\nfor Mater Dei High School, even following the team to tournaments in Nevada and Chicago.\n\nElijah Brown is a senior, so Mike Brown's dismissal is giving him an opportunity he will never have again.\n\n\"I'm spending time with my family,\" Brown tells Bresnahan. \"It's my oldest boy's senior year. What other time would you want to be able to hang with them?\"\n\nBrown, by all indications, is a good guy. Happily, this does not at all feel like him finishing last.\n\n--"
