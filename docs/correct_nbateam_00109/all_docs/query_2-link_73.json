        "text": "The Memphis Grizzlies might have all summer to think their dismal effort Thursday night.\n\nThe Grizzlies could have closed out the Thunder at home, but Oklahoma City jumped on them from the start and rolled to a 20-point victory. Now, Memphis must play Game 7 on the road Saturday without scoring leader Zach Randolph and possibly point guard Mike Conley.\n\nRandolph was suspended for punching Steven Adams in the jaw late in Game 6. The Grizzlies had no comment on the NBA's decision after landing in Oklahoma City, according to team spokesman Jason Wallace.\n\nConley strained his right hamstring in the loss and is struggling to recover. Memphis' backup point guard, Nick Calathes, is out for the series because of a drug suspension, meaning No. 3 point guard Beno Udrih will likely carry more responsibility against Russell Westbrook and Reggie Jackson, two of the quickest point guards in the NBA.\n\nConley said Friday that he plans to play, but he expects to be sore.\n\n\"Me being banged up, you're going to have to ask more out of different guys, see a lot of guys step up,\" he said. \"We're still excited and confident going into tomorrow's game, regardless of injuries and how last night's game went.\"\n\nMemphis coach Dave Joerger's team has dealt with injuries and lineup changes all season. Tony Allen missed 27 games this season, Marc Gasol 23 and Conley nine. Kosta Koufos and Ed Davis will likely fill Randolph's minutes.\n\n\"This is it,\" Joerger said. \"Whatever you want to say about the season, it's all come down to one game. Certainly, for us to have the best chance to win, we have to play better than we did last night.\""
