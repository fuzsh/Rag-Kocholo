        "text": "[GM Bob] Whitsitt believed they could develop Randolph the same way they had developed O'Neal right out of high school. They knew how to take baby steps developing, well, a baby. That's what the stewardess on the team's charter flight always called him, anyway. Sometimes, he even seemed younger than that - Randolph once asked 14-year veteran Steve Kerr when the team would be off for Christmas break. He also was repeatedly fined for not meeting his rookie weight requirement.\n\n...\n\nDarnell Valentine spent four-plus years with the Blazers in the 1980s and later became their director of player programs, making him almost overqualified to counsel young Z-Bo. He remembers Randolph frustrated by a city that, culturally, was \"a little bit of a challenge for Zach. In Portland, when you're a 6'9\" guy walking around, it's hard to hide. During that period when Zach was with Portland, it was kind of like Clint Eastwood: the good, the bad, and the ugly. They live and they die by their basketball. You live in a glass house. As a basketball player in this community, there's nowhere that you can go that's unnoticed. At the time, I don't think Zach understood the level of scrutiny and how passionate people were about how he represented this community.\""
