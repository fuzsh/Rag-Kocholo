        "text": "How big is Zach Randolph in Memphis?\n\nLast week, members of the Tennessee State Senate got into the spirit of the Memphis Grizzlies second-round playoff series against Oklahoma City by donning yellow headbands -- Randolph's signature game accessory -- for a photo op.\n\nMembers of the Grizzlies' game-night crew typically wear yellow headbands, and there's even a Facebook page called \"Zach Randolph's Yellow Headband.\"\n\n\"I think that tells you how accepted he is,\" Grizzlies broadcaster Pete Pranica said.\n\nIn many ways, Randolph has become the face of the Grizzlies as they continue the most surprising run of this season's NBA playoffs. Monday, eighth-seeded Memphis -- which knocked out top seed San Antonio in the first round -- hosts Oklahoma City in Game 4 of their second-round series. Memphis has a 2-1 series lead after Randolph -- this time wearing a blue headband -- had 21 points and 21 rebounds in a 101-93 overtime win Saturday.\n\nRandolph's playing style seems to gel perfectly with the city of Memphis. After six sometimes controversial seasons in Portland, and stops with the New York Knicks and Los Angeles Clippers, Randolph has found a home, recently signing a four-year extension worth a reported $66 million with the Grizzlies.\n\n\"It's a blue-collar town, and people work hard, and Zach's game is the exact same thing,\" said Raymond Brothers, Randolph's agent. \"He rebounds, he plays hard, he's got to work for everything he gets. He doesn't have the athleticism. I think that's a reflection of that city, and Zach's efforts are appreciated in that city.\"\n\nTo some Trail Blazers fans, Randolph's stature in Memphis might seem a far cry from his six seasons in Portland, where he developed a reputation as a me-first player, even earning the nickname \"Stat-Bo,\" a play on his nickname Z-Bo. There also were several off-court incidents that led critics to associate Randolph with the \"Jail Blazers\" era of the franchise.\n\nIn Memphis, however, Randolph is a popular player who is engaged in the community. Randolph has paid the utility bills of struggling families, and has been active in raising money for the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. He also dressed up as \"Z-Bo Claus\" to hand out gifts to local families.\n\nOn the court, Randolph has become a better and more willing passer, able to take advantage when he is double-teamed in the post, passing to slashers and shooters to set up easy baskets.\n\n\"I think (it's) just his understanding of playing with his teammates and using his teammates, making them better,\" Memphis coach Lionel Hollins said last month before the Grizzlies played the Blazers in Portland. \"I told him, 'This is how basketball is.' We've done that all year, we've done that more and more as he's stayed with it and had more trust and understanding of what it takes.\"\n\nRandolph remains one of the league's best offensive rebounders, and his put-back baskets have gained their own moniker in Memphis: Z-bounds. Pranica said a team cameraman came up with the name, and he started using it on the air.\n\n\"Some people like it, some people hate it -- mostly out-of-town people don't like it,\" Pranica said, laughing. \"It was just a way of having fun because Zach doesn't get his rebounds because he has great hops. He just has great timing. He'll go up, maybe tap it three times to himself, and put it back in. There's nobody that does it quite like him.\"\n\nBrothers says Randolph hasn't so much become a different person and player, but has simply matured. Randolph came into the NBA as a 19-year-old after one season at Michigan State, joining a Blazers team with such strong personalities as Rasheed Wallace, Scottie Pippen and Damon Stoudamire.\n\n\"I guarantee you, at 19 years old, with the family structure that he had, you come into a league like the NBA making over a million dollars a year, I'm pretty sure you or myself would make mistakes,\" Brothers said. Randolph was raised by his grandmother, and Randolph's father was in prison for long stretches of his childhood.\n\nPranica, who was a broadcaster for the Blazers when Randolph joined the team as the No. 19 pick of the 2001 draft, said the structure of the Blazers under then-president and general manager Bob Whitsitt insulated the players.\n\n\"I think there was such a culture of entitlement among the players and a sense of segregation between the players and even other people that worked for the Blazers organization who weren't in basketball operations,\" Pranica said. \"It kind of set them up like, 'Gee, I don't have to follow the rules,' or 'I don't have maintain the standards,' because it seemed the players were held to an entirely different standard.\"\n\nRandolph played well enough for the Blazers to earn the 2003-04 NBA Most Improved Player award, and the franchise rewarded him -- with a six-year, $86 million extension that expires this season. But his off-court image seemed to clash with the culture preached by former general manager Kevin Pritchard.\n\nIn 2007, after averaging 23.6 points and 10.1 rebounds during the 2006-07 season, Randolph was traded to the Knicks in a deal that essentially netted the Blazers center Channing Frye.\n\nAfter stints with the Knicks and Clippers, Randolph landed in Memphis. Last season, Randolph made the All-Star Game for the first time, and this season's playoffs are giving Randolph his first extensive national TV exposure.\n\nBrothers says Randolph, who turns 30 in July, has gained a better appreciation for what being a NBA star is about.\n\n\"Zach has really, really started to understand his surroundings,\" Brothers said. \"He never wanted to be looked at as some special athlete. Zach just wanted to be a normal guy that could play basketball. And he never understood that when you're a so-called public figure, you get all this notoriety, and but with it, comes a lot of scrutiny.\"\n\nPranica said he saw a hint of how Randolph has changed the people he associates with when they were together at a \"Stay-in-school\" event. A child asked Randolph about the biggest problem a professional athlete faces.\n\n\"And he gave what I thought was a very thoughtful response about how people sometimes want to be your friend even if they aren't your friend,\" Pranica said. \"And they expect things from you and saying no to people like that is one of the hardest things to do as a professional athlete.\"\n\n--\n\n; follow him on"
