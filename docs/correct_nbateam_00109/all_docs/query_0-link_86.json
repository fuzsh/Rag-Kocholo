        "text": "Zach Randolph spent nearly a decade earning a reputation as one of the NBA’s true platinum-plated knuckleheads. But in these playoffs, we witnessed a stunning evolution: perma-scowling, chronically half-assed team-destroyer to a legitimate, if unconventional, star and leader. Z-Bo’s decade in the NBA has been far too complicated—and far too strange in too many ways—for just one person to sum up. So before we bid a fond farewell (till next season) to the playoffs’ most compelling character, and with some help from those who witnessed Z-Bo at his best and worst, we present Z-Bo: Behind The Music.—David Roth__\n\nJailBlazer: 2001-07, The Portland Trail Blazers Years\n\nBen Golliver writes for _ CBSSports.com’s Eye On Basketball blog__ and edits the Portland Trail Blazers blog _Blazersedge.\n\nIn his new memoir, Idea Man, Paul Allen takes a short break from bashing Bill Gates to provide a frank obituary on the so-called Jail Blazers. \"We traded Zach Randolph to the Knicks, ending an era that none of us would miss,\" Allen sneers. \"The following season, we had the youngest team in the league and not a single arrest of suspension. The culture had changed.\"\n\nYoung, wildly talented, immature, stubborn and quickly empowered by an $84 million contract extension, Randolph answered to no one. Portland is a fishbowl, a town accustomed to winning and uncomfortable with any sordid off-court behavior from its heroes. Randolph was just a year out of high school and acted like it, and his instantly infamous \"Hoop Family\" entourage made matters worse. There was the suckerpunch of teammate (and registered sex offender) Ruben Patterson, during practice. There was a truly vile legal complaint involving paying strippers for sex and an alleged sexual assault. There was an incident in which his brother allegedly fired a gun at a nightclub. There was another lawsuit for harassment concerning the intimidation of witnesses to a dogfighting ring. His old high school coach pleaded with Randolph to associate with better people and Randolph promptly cut him out of his life. By the end of his tenure with the Blazers, Randolph’s wealthy suburban neighbors were regularly complaining to the local media about his loud, late-night parties.\n\nShortly after Allen took an expensive bath to get rid of Randolph, the team launched a new marketing campaign: \"Rise With Us.\" The \"rising\" was to take place not only from the draft lottery, where the Blazers had been stuck since 2003-04, but also from the stink of the arrests and ugly headlines. Allen’s loaded \"culture\" talk might read like Fox News, but the campaign was a smash hit.\n\nZeke-Bo: 2007-09, The New York Knicks Years\n\n_Joey Litman writes the blog Straight Bangin’ and contributed to _Free Darko.\n\nZach Randolph joined the Knicks during the darkest days of the Isiah Thomas Administration, and his acquisition—an archetypal Zeke mortgage-the-future-for-a-high-priced-present deal—helped perpetuate the misery. Z-Bo’s regular-season Knicks debut came that fall, a month after a jury had awarded Anucha Browne Sanders more than $11 million as compensation for Thomas’s sexual harassment and the Knicks’ organizational hostility. The previous year, the Knicks had brawled with the Nuggets after Isiah had told the team to do so. Foolish, incompetent, gallingly expensive losers, the Knicks were loathsome.\n\nThe acquisition of Randolph only reinforced the common wisdom that Thomas mistook activity for accomplishment while tilting toward a windmill no one else even saw. With Z-Bo on the team, the Knicks started 1-9. In November, Marbury took a two-day leave of absence from the team after reportedly exchanging punches with Thomas on a team plane ride. Even amid all that dysfunction and losing, Randolph was odious: a reluctant passer peculiarly prone to jump shots early in the shot clock. His defense was a fitting complement: he played little of it, and played it with a fierce apathy. Randolph’s physique summed up that bitter era. He has never been a chiseled physical specimen, and at times he has been out of shape and overweight. He was both while playing for the Knicks.\n\nIt was convenient to regard Zach’s body with contempt, to see it as proof that the Knicks simply did not care. And playing alongside Eddy Curry, a player so dense and massive that \"black hole\" is not merely a pejorative basketball metaphor, did not help. A weak, bloated front line suited the weak, bloated roster. It was a bad time.\n\nClipped: Randolph in Los Angeles, November 2008\n\n11 games into his second season in New York, the Knicks trade Randolph to the Los Angeles Clippers. On November 21, 2008, at ClipperBlog,_ Kevin Arnovitz reacted to the trade:_\n\n\"The Clips like Randolph’s offensive game. That’s terrific. I like Irish Wolfhounds. That doesn’t mean it’s a good idea to bring one home to my smallish two-bedroom house where I live alone, travel a lot, and have no fenced-in yard.\n\nFor the sake of moderation and rational discussion, let’s be fair. Randolph is a huge talent on the block and a vicious rebounder when he wants to be. If he works himself into position down low—and that’s often—he’s automatic with his left. He has also successfully expanded his face-up game to beyond 15 feet. He’s learned to work himself six FTAs a game, and can hit them at an 80 percent clip. In other words, 18 and 10 is not an unreasonable expectation from Randolph, if he starts.\n\nBut Randolph is also a black hole in the post, incapable of recognizing or passing out of the double-team. He and Al Thornton together might be the worst passing starting forward tandem the NBA has seen in years. Above everything else, Zach Randolph seems to care very little. That’s always the impression I have watching him ball.\n\nEither way, the Knicks have found their sucker.\"\n\n_Randolph averaged 20.9 points and 9.4 rebounds per game in 39 games with the Clippers, and then was traded after the season ended for Quentin Richardson. He ended up on the Grizzlies for the 2009-10 season.\n\n_\n\nApotheosis Now: April 24, 2011 Game Three of Western Conference First Round Against San Antonio Spurs\n\n_Graydon Gordian, a writer and editor in Brooklyn, is a member of ESPN’s TrueHoop Network, and the founder of the Spurs blog _48 Minutes of Hell.\n\nWhen Zach Randolph launched a three-pointer at the end of game three of the Grizzlies’ first round series against the Spurs, it woke up the echoes of Tim Duncan’s game saving three-pointer during the first overtime of game one of the Spurs’ first round series against the Suns in 2008. He was never supposed to take that shot, or at least it’s hard to imagine that he was, given the man, the shot and the stakes.\n\nAllusions to famous moments in sports so often feel forced—not every injured player is Willis Reed reborn—but Duncan’s 3-pointer provides Randolph’s with a narrative elegance, and reveals a thing or two about the Z-Bo’s embattled personality. When Duncan pauses before his shot, it scans as cold, considered commitment. Tim Duncan can almost always be found doing one of two things: relaxing or ecuting. In the face of a clock sprinting towards zero, he managed to do both.\n\nLike Duncan, Randolph is in no hurry on his attempt. But his casual demeanor has less to do with his resolve than his reflexive unwillingness to be serious. There had been plenty of time to work for a better shot; it looks as if he had merely been bored by doing so. More than any contemporary big man, Randolph has the ability to wed the ill-advised and the automatic. The ease with which he scores is refreshing; it’s almost as if his current success has its origins in the mischievous, flat-footed jumper that no amount of defensive pressure can ensure he’ll miss.\n\nZach To The Future: Circa Now\n\nChris Herrington covers the Grizzlies for The Memphis Flyer.\n\nWhen the Memphis Grizzlies acquired Zach Randolph in the summer of 2009, a Portland newspaper columnist came on local radio to warn of the \"Hoop Family\" terror that awaited us, of the lawless human baggage that arrived along with this new power forward.\n\nTwo years later, no one that I know has laid an eye on or heard a word about \"Hoop Family\". His new hoop family is headlined by two young daughters who, with their mother, sit directly behind my media-row seat most games. Once or twice a night, I’ll end up retrieving the younger daughter’s pacifier from the floor.\n\nHave two little girls, the embrace of a new home, or simply getting older fundamentally changed Randolph? No one can say for sure. But, for now, this is the Z-Bo Memphis knows. The guy who pays utility bills for needy citizens by day, drops 20-20 games by night. It knows the clutching, grabbing, bumping, grinding, scoring and rebounding machine—one who has, perhaps improbably, become more efficient, a better passer, and a more willing defender over the past two seasons.\n\nAfter game six of the San Antonio series, Randolph gave a post-game interview on national television that might have been scripted by Stax songwriter David Porter, testifying about how both he and his new city got what they got the hard way.\n\nThis city has taken to Zach Randolph for the same reason it never really embraced Pau Gasol: It’s a tough town that likes tough guys. We rally around rough edges, sharp elbows, colorful personalities, and generous spirits. And we can relate to bad reputations and redemption stories. Zach Randolph doesn’t seem like someone who’s found a home in Memphis. He seems like someone who’s from here.\n\n—David Roth\n\nRoth writes for The Wall Street Journal, The Awl and Can’t Stop The Bleeding."
