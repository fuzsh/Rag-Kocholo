        "text": "NEW YORK -- Memphis forward Zach Randolph has been suspended for Game 7 of the Grizzlies' playoff series against Oklahoma City for punching Thunder center Steven Adams in the jaw.\n\nThe ruling Friday by the NBA leaves the Grizzlies without their leading scorer for the deciding game in Oklahoma City on Saturday night.\n\nThe play came with 6:42 left in the Thunder's 104-84 victory Thursday night. Randolph first elbowed Adams in the midsection with his left elbow, then struck Adams with his right hand.\n\nRandolph is averaging a team-best 18.2 points in the series.\n\nMemphis coach Dave Joerger's team has dealt with injuries and lineup changes all season. Tony Allen missed 27 games this season, Marc Gasol 23 and Mike Conley nine. Kosta Koufos and Ed Davis will likely fill Randolph's minutes.\n\n\"This is it,\" Joerger said. \"Whatever you want to say about the season, it's all come down to one game. Certainly, for us to have the best chance to win, we have to play better than we did last night.\""
