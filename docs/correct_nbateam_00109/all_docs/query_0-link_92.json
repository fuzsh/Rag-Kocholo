        "text": "What is Zach Randolphâs Net Worth and Salary?\n\nZach Randolph is an American former professional basketball player who has a net worth of $85 million. Zach Randolph, AKA âZ-Bo,â was a two-time NBA All-Star for the Memphis Grizzlies after being drafted by the Portland Trail Blazers.\n\nEarly Life\n\nZachary McKenley Randolph was born on July 16, 1981. He was raised in Marion, Indiana, where he starred in basketball at Marion High School. He was a player to watch by the time he was a sophomore, helping to lead the Marion Giants to the 1998 Indiana Class 4A Championship game. And as a senior, they returned to the state championship and won the seventh state basketball championship in Marion High School history. He finished second in Indianaâs âMr. Basketballâ voting to Jared Jeffries and was named the 2000 McDonaldâs All-American Game MVP and a First-team âParadeâ All-American.\n\nCollege Career\n\nZach Randolph went on to play college basketball for Michigan State University where he was coached by Tom Izzo. He only played one season in which he averaged 10.8 points and 6.7 rebounds per game with the Spartans finishing with a 28-5 record and advancing to their third straight NCAA FInal Four before he declared for the NBA Draft.\n\nNBA Career\n\nWith the 19th overall selection in the 2001 NBA Draft, Zach Randolph was selected by the Portland Trail Blazers. His tenure with the team came with a bit of controversy as he was arrested for underage drinking in 2002 and was involved in some on-court incidents including punching teammate Ruben Patterson. But in 2004, Randolph won the NBAâs Most Improved Player award and set himself up for a big payday.\n\nIn June of 2007, Randolph was traded to the New York Knicks in a package deal. He averaged 17.6 points and 10.3 rebounds his first year with the team but only played in 11 games the next season before being traded to the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nDuring a game against the Phoenix Suns, Randolph was ejected and ultimately suspended for two games after punching Louis Amundson in the face. He finished out the 2008-2009 campaign with the Clippers before once again being traded.\n\nThe height of Randolphâs career came with the Memphis Grizzlies when he was traded there in exchange for Quentin Richardson in July of 2009. He was a two-time All-Star with the Grizzlies and an All-NBA Third Team selection in 2011. Here he would sign another big contract, and the Grizzlies had success making the playoffs multiple times and reaching the Western Conference Finals. Zach Randolph signed with the Sacramento Kings in 2017 where he would fall out of the rotation in favor of younger players. He was traded to the Dallas Mavericks but waived just two days later.\n\nRandolph announced his retirement from the NBA in December of 2019, and the Memphis Grizzlies retired his No. 50 jersey. Over his NBA career, he amassed 18,578 points (16.6 ppg) and 10,208 rebounds (9.1 rpg).\n\nContracts & Career Earnings\n\nZach Randolphâs mega deal with the Portland Trail Blazers in 2005 was for six years and worth $84.3 million. He also signed a four-year, $66 million contract with the Memphis Grizzlies in 2011 and a two-year deal worth $24 million with the Sacramento Kings in 2017.\n\nOver his NBA career, Zach Randolph made more than $196.5 million in salary alone, making him one of the 20 highest-earning players in NBA history.\n\nReal Estate\n\nIn August of 2019, Randolph spent $5.2 million to buy a brand new home in Encino, California. The 8,200 square-foot home sits on a half acre and features a swimming pool, large cabana, outdoor kitchen and basketball court.\n\nZach Randolph Earnings\n\nMemphis Grizzlies (2012-13) $16.5 Million\n\nMemphis Grizzlies (2011-12) $15.2 Million\n\nMemphis Grizzlies (2010-11) $17.7 Million\n\nMemphis Grizzlies (2009-10) $16 Million\n\nLos Angeles Clippers (2008-09) $14.7 Million\n\nNew York Knicks (2007-08) $13.3 Million\n\nPortland Trail Blazers (2006-07) $12 Million\n\nPortland Trail Blazers (2005-06) $10.7 Million\n\nPortland Trail Blazers (2004-05) $1.5 Million\n\nPortland Trail Blazers (2003-04) $1.2 Million\n\nPortland Trail Blazers (2002-03) $1.1 Million\n\nPortland Trail Blazers (2001-02) $1 Million\n\nncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaLKRmLVuvsCnm6ikoJ3AbrrErWSwp6KptW6uyKieq5mgncZussCcq2abkaeypr6Mmq6aqpSoeqK6w2ajop6VYsC1u9GyZGtn"
