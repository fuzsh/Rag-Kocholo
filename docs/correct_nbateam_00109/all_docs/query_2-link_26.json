        "text": "Indiana Pacers fans remember what their team used to be. They would dominate the paint, defend with pure aggression and value every possession. The Memphis Grizzles remember those days, too, no matter how recent it still feels.\n\nOnly the Grizzlies are refusing to change their style of play. They want to continue to bully teams. And, despite the way the NBA is transforming into small-ball and spread offenses, the Grizzles are happy – heck, thrilled if you ask them – that the Pacers are changing their identity.\n\n“That’s good for us,” Memphis’ Zach Randolph said before Thursday’s game. “Shoot a lot of jump shots. That’s good for us.”\n\nThe Grizzlies proved Randolph’s point a few hours later. The Pacers, who grabbed the lead in the third quarter, struggled in the fourth quarter once the Grizzlies intensified their effort on defense. Once the Pacers missed their shots, the Grizzlies grabbed the rebound and increased their lead, which turned into a 112-103 win.\n\nRandolph finished with 11 points and eight rebounds. Memphis center Marc Gasol led the team with 20 points and eight rebounds. The Pacers had just one true big man finished in double figures, as Ian Mahinmi scored 11 points.\n\n“Defense, defense, defense,” Gasol said. “On offense, the ball may go in. If we don’t play defense, we have no shot. We all know that. We knew at the end of the game we had to stop them.”\n\nBefore the game, Randolph had a point he wanted to share. Yes, most NBA teams can shoot the ball well. Most teams have players who are capable of making 3-pointers. But, as Randolph explains, the Golden State Warriors are the exception, the oddity, the rarity.\n\nRandolph also knows these Pacers – without Roy Hibbert and David West – are not the Warriors, the reigning NBA champions. Randolph should know. Last year, the Grizzlies were the tougher team through three games during the second round of the playoffs. The Warriors, one of the best shooting teams in NBA history, won the next three games and the series.\n\n“Golden State won the championship last year, but if you look at teams that won in the previous years, you still have the Dallas Mavericks and the (San Antonio) Spurs,” Randolph said of teams needing two big men to help secure a title. “Not too many teams win championships like Golden State.”\n\nSome people, perhaps the basketball analytical community, will disagree with Randolph since more teams are valuing skill players, 3-pointers and space more than just height. What Memphis still has, and what the Pacers used to have, is two large, skillful frontcourt players in Randolph, a power forward, and center Marc Gasol.\n\nLast season, Randolph and Gasol combined for 33.5 points and 18.3 rebounds per game. The Grizzles were the fourth best team in defensive efficiency and won 55 games.\n\n“The way we play, and our fundamental skill set, we’re able to make plays and shoot the ball,” Randolph said. “Marc is not the average center in the league. The stuff he does as a 7-footer by handling the ball, making plays and shooting, he’s a more fundamental skill man. We work well together and we know each other's spots.”\n\nBefore Thursday’s game, Pacers coach Frank Vogel said Memphis is one of just a few NBA teams left that can play a slow-pace, traditional style of basketball. Vogel included the Chicago Bulls, Spurs and Los Angeles Clippers to that list. He described Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan of the Clippers as monsters.\n\nHis praise for Randolph and Gasol was higher.\n\n“These two guys are as good as it gets in terms of playing the high-low game,” Vogel said. “Both of them can shoot it and pass from the high post. Both of them are beasts down inside. They certainly have the ability to play this style of play.”\n\nStarting his 15th season, Randolph said he still enjoys playing in Indianapolis, not far from his hometown of Marion. He purchased 30 tickets for Thursday’s game and showed his family and friends that his rough brand of basketball: post-ups near the basket, elbows flying for rebounds and a soft touch in the paint.\n\n“It means a lot, and this is where I started at,” Randolph said. “It’s always fun to come home and buy a bunch of tickets. I’ve been doing it for 15 years. It’s fun.”\n\nThe first half of Thursday’s game was a small example of what the Grizzlies face in a league full of run-and-shoot teams and what those teams encounter when they play Memphis.\n\nIn the first quarter, the Grizzlies controlled the tempo, played solid defense and shot the ball well to have a nine-point lead after the first 12 minutes. The Pacers adjusted in the second quarter. They shot the ball better, pushed the pace and forced the Grizzles into five turnovers.\n\nThe halftime score: Grizzlies 50, Pacers 49.\n\nThe Pacers and Grizzlies are going in opposite directions, both believing their style of play is better suited for the league and for championships. Randolph’s Grizzlies will take history. Vogel’s Pacers want to be progressive.\n\nOn Thursday, the Grizzlies were the better team.\n\n“As you can see today, we out rebound them,” Tony Allen said of Memphis’ 42-38 advantage. “Normally, that team wins. We just have to get back in transition and limit those guys on second-chance points. Then, the game is in our favor. I like the way we play and I love playing with those guys, Marc and Zach. I like our bunch.”\n\nMemphis coach David Joerger openly shared his game plan for Thursday’s game.\n\n“We’re going to play stretch 4s,” Joerger said. “That’s what we played last night with (Cleveland’s) Kevin Love at the 4 and tonight it’s Paul George. It’s just the way the league is. We have to control the tempo of the game with our offense and get the ball in the paint and try to get to the foul line.”\n\nJoerger, moving forward with Randolph and Gasol, will not change. He wants the Grizzlies to impose their will, get back in transition and defend – exactly what the Pacers used to do.\n\nAllen said he wants Memphis to have the same effect on the league after this season the same way Golden State has influence teams.\n\n“We’re going to end up winning the ring and make the league turn right back around,” he said. “It’s a copycat league. Everybody is linking onto going small. The way we play, we have counters to even up with that.”\n\nGeorge fined for comments\n\nBefore Thursday’s game, Paul George was fined $10,000 by the NBA for criticizing the officials after the Pacers’ season-opening loss to the Toronto Raptors. He received a technical foul during that game for arguing a call by the referees.\n\nCall Star reporter Nate Taylor at (317) 444-6484. Follow him on Twitter: @ByNateTaylor."
