        "text": "MEMPHIS, Tenn. >> Zach Randolph recorded his first career triple-double with 28 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists, Tony Allen added 22 points and the Memphis Grizzlies beat the Clippers 113-102 on Saturday night.\n\nRandolph, returning from a seven-game absence due to a sore knee, was 10 of 19 from the floor, while Allen was 7 of 10. Ray McCallum added 14 for Memphis, including seven in the fourth quarter. Lance Stephenson had 12 points and JaMychal Green finished with 11 as Memphis snapped a four-game losing streak.\n\nChris Paul had 25 points and six assists for the Clippers, while DeAndre Jordan added 16 points and seven rebounds. Paul Pierce contributed 12 points and Austin Rivers finished with 10.\n\nThe Clippers have lost three of four.\n\nRandolph recorded his 10th assist while hitting Allen on a cut to the basket with 1:26 left. He left the floor with about 35 seconds remaining in the game to a standing ovation as he pumped his fist.\n\nThe win was an emotional lift for Memphis, which had lost its last two games to Minnesota and Milwaukee while dealing with an array of injuries.\n\nThe Clippers, who trailed by 11 with 8:23 left in the game, cut into the advantage at the free throw line, making six straight. Paul’s 13-footer completed an 8-0 run and Memphis’ advantage was down to 91-88 with just under 7 minutes left.\n\nRandolph and McCallum took over at that point, combining for all but two of Memphis’ points in an 11-2 rally for a 102-90 lead, ending the Clippers’ chances.\n\nMemphis hit its first seven shots for an early 10-point lead. The Clippers countered with 3-point shooting, including a pair from Wesley Johnson and a third from Jamal Crawford.\n\nMidway through the second, both teams were still well above 50 percent shooting.\n\nAfter a first half with eight ties and 10 lead changes, it was appropriate that they were deadlocked 58-all at the break. Randolph had 14 points and Allen 13 for Memphis, while Jordan and Pierce had 11 points each for Los Angeles, with Jordan converting all five of his shots and Pierce going 3 of 4 from outside the arc.\n\nThe teams stayed close early in the third before Memphis created a bit of a buffer behind Stephenson, who got to the rim, and a Grizzlies defense that caused a handful of Los Angeles turnovers by the 3-minute mark of the frame.\n\nMemphis pushed the lead back to double-digits, eventually reaching 85-70 as Los Angeles’ miscues reached seven for the quarter.\n\nThe Clippers were able to score the last five points of the third, leaving Memphis with an 85-75 lead entering the fourth."
