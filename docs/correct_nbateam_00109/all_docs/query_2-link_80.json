        "text": "Damon Stoudamire hasn't played alongside Zach Randolph in a decade.\n\nIt was 2011 when Stoudamire, then a Grizzlies assistant under Lionel Hollins, last helped direct Randolph from an NBA bench.\n\nBut Stoudamire, a former NBA star who's now an assistant coach at the University of Arizona, remains an authority on the Michigan State alumnus' game — especially when the topic is playoff basketball.\n\n\"The more touches he gets, the more productive he gets. It's no secret that if he's getting touches, he's feeling good,\" Stoudamire said. \"He starts wiggling those shoulders and he starts jab-stepping you. He starts licking those fingers. That's what he's always done, from the first playoff game he's ever played.\"\n\nRandolph's first playoff game was during his second year in the league. He was playing for the Portland Trail Blazers, whom the Grizzlies are facing in a first-round playoff series.\n\n■ Full NBA playoff schedule, results\n\nRandolph and those Blazers faced the Dallas Mavericks in 2003, and Portland trailed 0-3 in the series. Blazers center Arvydas Sabonis and forward Scottie Pippen were injured, so coach Maurice Cheeks turned to Randolph.\n\nThe burly youngster had 25 points and 15 rebounds in Game 4, 22 and nine in Game 5, and 21 and 10 in a Game 6 — all Portland wins.\n\nThe moral of the story 12 years later is simple: Put Randolph in the playoffs and prepare for a pummeling by one of the most productive power forwards to ever play the game.\n\nRandolph joined Chicago's Pau Gasol as one of just six frontcourt players to average 15 points and 10 rebounds in his 14th NBA season. Charles Barkley, Robert Parrish, Moses Malone and Artis Gilmore are the others, and they made the basketball Hall of Fame.\n\nRandolph, 33, has been legendary for the Griz in the postseason. He hass averaged 18.4 points and 10 rebounds in 41 Griz playoff games. Memphis has never advanced in a postseason series without Randolph playing at an elite level, and he still holds the key to their success.\n\n\"Zach comes to play, man,\" point guard Mike Conley said. \"It's almost like he just waits and waits for the playoffs, and that's all he thinks about. This is an opportunity for all of us to do something special this year and I expect him to do the same, if not more, of what he's been doing for us every year around April.\"\n\nRandolph has left little doubt that he's looking forward to NBA's second season.\n\n\"It's about energy, studying and competing. It's a totally different mentality,\" Randolph said about playoff basketball. \"There's a different concentration. But I'm just being me. I'm trying to help this team win championships. Whatever it takes.\"\n\nRandolph has brought a consistency for which he rarely seems to get credit. Even as media types use analytics and search for reasons for Randolph's so-called demise, NBA defenses still constantly look for ways to stop him from banging away, working over and plowing through opponents just as he always has.\n\nHe's the master of bully basketball.\n\n\"We expect that (the Blazers) are going to throw the kitchen sink at him,\" Griz coach Dave Joerger said. \"They're going to front him and double him from this place and that place. You're going to see some zone. I anticipate he'll be as engaged and as physical as ever. This is the time of year he plays for, as does all veterans. There are games that mean more. I wouldn't say he's winding down. He knows the importance of this.\"\n\nGriz center Marc Gasol affirmed that Randolph's approach changes for the postseason.\n\n\"He does all of the little things,\" Gasol said. \"The game slows down for us so we play the right way and he makes it a battle of wills.\"\n\nStoudamire explained that certain teammates who shoot more during the regular season tend to pass up shots in the playoffs. Randolph just delivers more short-range hook shots and putbacks. He used to ask coaches why opponents double-teamed him in the post. Now Randolph awaits the crowd and leaves multiple defenders mesmerized by his passing.\n\n\"He's learned how to play the overall game since he got to Memphis,\" Stoudamire said. \"But in the playoffs, you need a dude that's going to get double-teamed. The Grizzlies definitely got one and he can make somebody else better.\"\n\nRandolph's maturation has come by experience and the Grizzlies' reliance on him to elevate the franchise. Randolph turned into a leader and knows how to direct teammates after the whistle blows. His calling card, though, is putting the ball in the basket under duress.\n\n\"He doesn't shy from the big moments. He wants the ball when it's most needed,\" Griz general manager Chris Wallace said. \"He takes on any challenge. He's a big-moment, big-game player. He's been a franchise changer for us. He's aging like fine wine. He's still one of the most feared low-post scorers and offensive rebounders in the league.\"\n\nRandolph is a 14-year veteran with two All-Star appearances and more than 15,000 career points. After six seasons in Memphis, the same amount of time he spent in Portland, Randolph has become the face of another small-market franchise.\n\nIf there's a difference with the Griz, it's that Randolph is more conscious and wants to leave an indelible mark.\n\n\"I'm mature now. Everything is the same with my game,\" Randolph said. \"It's just a matter of getting in the right situation. I love Portland. They were good to me. They know I would have been the same player there that I am here. I played there as long as I've been here. But this is where I have to make it happen. Memphis is my home, and I'm happy the city embraced me. I've come a long way and I'm going to keep doing what I've been doing. I want to help this team win a championship. That's the whole goal. No matter what, people that have watched me play know that's what I've been playing for.\""
