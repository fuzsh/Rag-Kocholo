        "text": "NBA star Zach Randolph of the Sacramento Kings was one of two people arrested Wednesday night while a crowd formed in the Nickerson Gardens housing project in Watts and vandalized six police cars.\n\n36-year-old Randolph, a former Los Angeles Clipper, was arrested on suspicion of marijuana possession and intent to sell, said LAPD Officer Drake Madison. Another man, 43-year-old Stanley Walton, was also arrested on suspicion of being an ex-convict in possession of a gun, Madison added.\n\n“The charges are false and misleading,” Randolph’s agent and attorney Raymond Brothers told The Associated Press on Thursday. “We’re looking at all options to resolve this matter.”\n\nThe incident began at 10:18 p.m. Wednesday at a house in the area of 112th Street and Zamora Avenue when a crowd formed who were drinking, smoking marijuana and blocking the roadway, Madison said.\n\nOfficers observed three suspects that reached for their waistband and ran, Madison explained. Officers immediately detained one man who was questioned and released.\n\nTwo other suspects went inside the unit and tried to block officers before police were able to gain entry and took the two into custody, Madison said,\n\nThe crowd then grew larger and started throwing rocks and bottles at officers and a help call was placed and the LAPD and L.A. County Sheriff’s Department units responded.\n\n“A dispersal order was given,” Madison said, adding skirmish lines were formed by the LAPD Devonshire division before five LAPD patrol cars and one L.A. County Sheriff’s Department vehicle were vandalized.\n\nCash, narcotics and two guns were recovered from the scene, Madison added.\n\nRandolph is a two-time All-Star who has played 16 seasons in the NBA. Over that time, he has earned more than $175 million in salary alone.\n\nHe was drafted 19th overall out of Michigan State by the Portland Trail Blazers in the 2001 draft.\n\nNicknamed “Z-Bo,” he spent six seasons in Portland before getting traded to the New York Knicks. Early in his second season in New York, he was traded to the Clippers along with Mardy Collins for Cuttino Mobley and Tim Thomas in 2008.\n\nRandolph averaged 20.9 points and 9.4 rebounds in 39 games with the Clippers, but was traded in the 2009 offseason to the Memphis Grizzlies for Quentin Richardson.\n\nHe helped lead the Grizzlies to the postseason seven times in eight seasons. He averaged 16.8 points and 9.3 rebounds for Memphis, which has said it will retire Randolph’s No. 50 jersey in the future.\n\nAs a free agent, Randolph signed a two-year, $24 million contract with the Sacramento Kings on July 10.\n\nAccording to sheriff’s booking records, Randolph is out on $20,000 bail and has an Aug. 31 court date set in Los Angeles.\n\nDeputy Sports Editor Brian Martin and City News Service contributed to this report"
