        "text": "Grizzlies grinder: Zach Randolph a true throwback\n\nMEMPHIS — Zach Randolph insists he’s ready to do whatever the Memphis Grizzlies need or ask of him in his 15th NBA season.\n\nEven play a little less, if that’s what it takes for the Grizzlies to win a championship.\n\nJust don’t mistake that as a concession to age by a 34-year-old power forward.\n\n“I think I’m still in my prime, and I’m going to let my game, the way I play, speak for itself,” Randolph said. “But I mean whatever I need to do to help this team, if it’s play less minutes, whatever, I’m with this team whatever we need to do.”\n\nRandolph just became the sixth man to average at least 15 points and 10 rebounds in his 14th season or later, joining Artis Gilmore, Moses Malone (three times), Robert Parish, Charles Barkley (twice) and Pau Gasol. It’s something Randolph now has done 10 times.\n\nCoach Dave Joerger said at the Grizzlies’ media day that he monitored Randolph’s playing time a lot last season, and the forward averaged a couple minutes less per game.\n\nPulling the man nicknamed Z Bo from a game isn’t nearly as easy as it sounds.\n\n“He’s difficult to take out,” Joerger said. “Once he gets fully lathered, he’s like ‘What? No! Not now’ especially once he gets cooking down there on the right block. He’s such a go-to guy for us. We need a bucket, he can go get you a bucket. So it’ll be interesting how we manage through the course of the year.”\n\nNew Grizzlies teammate Matt Barnes says he’s always marveled at Randolph, a power forward never mistaken for the most athletic or fastest player on the court. Shoot, the joke about Randolph is that his vertical leap could be measured by sticking pieces of paper under his feet.\n\n“For him to continue year in, year out to be a double-double guy, someone you can throw the ball to at the end of the game and get a bucket, someone that adds toughness, rebounding and attitude, he’s the last of a dying breed,” Barnes said of Randolph.\n\nRandolph has been a key piece in the best run in Grizzlies’ history with Memphis reaching the postseason in five of his six seasons. The only season he didn’t play at least 71 games and average a double-double was in 2011-12 when a knee injury limited him to 28 games.\n\nGrizzlies guard Tony Allen calls Randolph “Mr. 20 and 10.”\n\n“Give him the ball at all costs,” Allen said. “And I don’t want to hear nothing bad when they’re talking about my home boy. That’s my brother. You can put him on the block with just about anybody 10 years younger than him, 10 years older than him or his age, he’s going to out-dominate them.”\n\nWhile some players might spend the offseason shooting lots of balls, Randolph focused on details like spacing and the pick and roll to help open the court up a bit for the Grizzlies. Tweaking around the edges essentially for a man who knows how to work the angles for grabbing rebounds and putting up shots.\n\nThe Grizzlies also have All-Star center Marc Gasol, guards Mike Conley and Courtney Lee and forwards Jeff Green and Brandan Wright (former Brentwood Academy star). That depth means Memphis ideally won’t need Randolph to carry such a heavy load night in, night out.\n\nNBA SEASON OPENERS\n\nTUESDAY\n\nPistons at Hawks, 7 p.m.\n\nCavaliers at Bulls, 7 p.m., TNT\n\nPelicans at Golden State, 9:30 p.m., TNT\n\nWEDNESDAY\n\nCavaliers at Memphis, 7 p.m.\n\nGRIZZLIES AT A GLANCE\n\nLast season: 55-27, lost to Warriors in second round.\n\nCoach: Dave Joerger, third season.\n\nStarting five: G Michael Conley (15.8 ppg, 5.8 apg, 3.0 rpg), G Courtney Lee (10.1 ppg, 2.3 rpg, 2.0 apg), G/F Tony Allen (8.6 ppg, 4.4 rpg, 1.4 apg), F Zach Randolph (16.1 ppg, 10.5 rpg, 2.2 apg), C Marc Gasol (17.4 ppg, 7.8 rpg, 3.8 apg).\n\nKey additions: F Matt Barnes (trade, Bobcats), F Brandan Wright (free agent, Suns), F Jarell Martin (draft).\n\nKey losses: C Kosta Koufos (free agent, Kings), G Nick Calathes (free agent, Greece), F Jon Leuer (trade, Suns).\n\nEyes on: Conley. The Grizzlies are a much better team with their point guard on the floor distributing the ball, a fact driven home in the playoffs when he tried to play through broken bones in his left cheek against the Warriors. Injuries limited Conley to 70 games last season, but he is in the final year of his current contract this season.\n\nOutlook: The Grizzlies had a quiet offseason for a change after front office changes in 2014 and a coaching change in 2013. Their biggest move came by keeping Marc Gasol off the free agent market.\n\nGET TO KNOW THE GRIZZLIES\n\nGETTING OLDER\n\nMemphis has eight Grizzlies in their 30s if Ryan Hollins makes the team with four of those starters: Marc Gasol (30), Zach Randolph (34), Tony Allen (33) and Courtney Lee (30). Mike Conley, who turned 28 on Oct. 11, doesn’t believe that’s an issue. “As we’ve gotten older, we’ve gotten better.”\n\nGRITTIER GRIZZLIES\n\nAllen, aka the Grindfather in Memphis, coined the phrase “Grit ’n’ Grind” to describe the Grizzlies’ style, and he is coming off a season where he earned NBA All-Defense first team honors despite starting only 41 games. He tied his career-high with 129 steals and set a personal best averaging 2.05 steals per game. Now add Barnes to the mix, a veteran who has Allen’s respect for his defensive skills.\n\nDEEP BENCH\n\nAfter tinkering with the bench this offseason, coach Dave Joerger has to figure out exactly which Grizzlies work best with backup point guard Beno Udrih. Signing the athletic Brandan Wright gives Joerger the chance to put a fast lineup on the court, and Barnes can work in wherever needed after spending lots of time this summer honing his jump shot. Rookie Jarell Martin is busy healing up his left foot after surgery before training camp, but Memphis will have to see if any minutes remain for Jordan Adams, Russ Smith and Jarnell Stokes — a trio coming off their first NBA seasons who impressed veteran Vince Carter in summer league play.\n\nOUTSIDE SHOOTING\n\nAs strong as Memphis is in the paint with Gasol and Randolph, consistent shooting from outside the paint remains the Grizzlies’ weak link. Only Minnesota attempted fewer 3-ponters than the Grizzlies (15.2 per game), though Memphis ranked 22nd hitting 33.9 percent outside the arc. The Grizzlies went 22-1 when hitting more 3s than their opponents and 24-4 when making at least 40 percent of their 3s. But they averaged just 26.4 percent from 3 in their losses. Memphis will need Lee to average 40 percent again but take more than the 224 3-pointers he attempted last season.\n\nGOING HIGH-TECH\n\nMemphis worked with a company in training camp to measure the Grizzlies to help devise the best workout for each player and identify areas that could lead to injuries. The team also has worked with another company to track the mileage of the Grizzlies in practices and games along with the force exerted on their legs. “We’re trying to turn over every stone,” general manager Chris Wallace said. Controlling owner “Robert Pera comes from Silicon Valley and obviously is very concerned about making sure we’re at the forefront of all the technological advances that can help our players.”"
