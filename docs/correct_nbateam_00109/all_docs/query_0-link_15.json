        "text": "Zach Randolph saw a bunch of unfamiliar faces and noticed that the Grizzlies’ spirit also approached a season low.\n\nTo say that the veteran power forward lifted his teammates Saturday night would be an understatement.\n\nRandolph returned from a seven-game layoff and manufactured his first career triple-double in carrying the Griz to a 113-102 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers in FedExForum.\n\nStill short-handed, the Grizzlies (40-30) snapped a four-game losing streak on the strength of Randolph’s 28 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists.\n\n“This was one of those games where you look around the locker room and see that guys were down,” Randolph said after healing from a sore knee. “We’ve got a lot of new guys who haven’t really played in the NBA before. They’re hungry and that’s all you can ask for. It was a team win. If we go out and compete that’s all we can do. That’s what I tell the young guys.”\n\nRandolph made everyone’s night easier.\n\nHe found guard Ray McCallum, playing on a 10-day contract, for open 3-pointers, dished to Tony Allen cutting through the lane and bullied to the basket in the paint.\n\nAnd when the Griz needed a clutch shot, Randolph got his patented feathery jump shot to fall.\n\n“What he does is give you that belief that you can get it done,” Griz coach Dave Joerger said before adding: “It goes to show you how much his game has evolved. He may not know the full name of the guys he’s playing with but he kicked it out to them.”\n\nRandolph’s performance came as the already injury-plagued Griz played without Matt Barnes due to an NBA-imposed suspension.\n\nThe league announced a few hours before tipoff that Barnes had to serve a one-game suspension for his actions Thursday night at the end of a road loss to the Milwaukee Bucks, including obscenities and a subsequent attempt to enter Milwaukee’s locker room for a confrontation with the Bucks' John Henson.\n\nBarnes’ absence was softened by Randolph’s comeback. Vince Carter also played following a four-game layoff due to a left calf strain.\n\nJoerger also shook up the starting lineup given the team’s recent struggles to score. Lance Stephenson made his second straight start, and McCallum was in the lineup at tipoff alongside Randolph, Allen and Ryan Hollins.\n\nRandolph made his first four shots. Allen connected on his first six and finished with 22 points.\n\nMcCallum chipped in 14, including a clutch 3-pointer off a feed from Randolph when the Griz held off a Clippers rally in the fourth quarter.\n\n“They were the tougher team,” Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. “It was clear from the start. It all started with Zach. He came in on a mission and his leadership, you know. … He and Tony Allen were just the two toughest guys on the floor. You deserve to lose when that happens.”\n\nInjured point guard Mike Conley (Achilles) informed Randolph that he needed one assist to record the triple-double. Randolph then made it clear to Allen that he would deliver the basketball. Allen’s layup after a cut through the lane gave Randolph his milestone and the Griz a 108-96 lead with 1:26 left in the game.\n\n“I’ve been playing with him he last six years and it’s been the same thing – pass it to Z-Bo, cut and get open,” Allen said. “I’m just happy I helped get him his first triple-double. He can’t say I haven’t ever done anything for him.”\n\nMemphis led 85-75 entering the final frame.\n\nThe Griz took an 82-70 lead when Randolph found JaMychal Green cutting through the lane. Green caught the ball, took one step and scored on a slam dunk. Randolph made two free throws and Griz newcomer Xavier Munford split two foul shots as the Griz built an 85-70 advantage.\n\nMemphis controlled the game in the second half by continuing its dominance in the paint. The Griz outscored the Clippers 40-24 in the paint as they pulled away in a game that was knotted at 58 by halftime.\n\nThe Clippers didn’t finish the game at full strength, either.\n\nFormer Griz forward Jeff Green left the game in the second half after receiving an inadvertent elbow to the head from Randolph. The incident happened with 6:23 remaining in the third quarter and Green writhed in pain before leaving after several minutes with a towel pressed against the side of his forehead."
