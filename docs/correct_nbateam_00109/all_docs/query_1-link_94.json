        "text": "Zach Randolph, all 260 pounds of him, has a soft side. And it's not his stomach.\n\nThe Memphis Grizzlies power forward, one of the NBA's toughest players, admitted in an ESPN interview that he is terrified of cats. He also cries sometimes. These two things may or may not be related.\n\nRandolph was in a recent episode of Animal Planet's Pit Bulls and Parolees, in which he helped rescue a pit bull trapped in a Memphis drainpipe. The All-Star power forward says he loves dogs. There's a \"but.\"\n\n\"You can't be both a dog lover and a cat lover,\" Randolph says. \"I've got a crazy phobia about cats. For some reason, I'm always thinking they're going to scratch me. If a cat walks up, I'm going, 'Oh no, this dude about to scratch me -- I know it!' Cats scare the hell out of me. I love animals, but I'm no cat lover. Guys usually aren't.\"\n\nRandolph has a point. Cats can scratch you, unlike, say, statues, which Portland Trail Blazers rookie Damian Lillard claims as his biggest fear. No word on which is more deadly: cats or horses, Kansas City Chiefs safety Eric Berry's top phobia.\n\nBesides, Randolph has established his toughness on the court, particularly when taking on enormous Oklahoma City Thunder center Kendrick Perkins.\n\nThe interview with ESPN's Sam Alipour also included talk of Randolph's New Year's resolutions, eating habits and this charming nugget about the Pit Bulls and Parolees episode:\n\nAlipour: Here goes: The episode made me shed a tear.\n\nRandolph: [Laughs.] Well, I haven't seen it yet. But I might, too.\n\nAlipour: Seriously? You're a crier?\n\nRandolph: Yeah, a little bit.\n\nAlipour: I'll keep that between us.\n\nRandolph: It was emotional, man! I got a passion for these animals. I really do.\n\nWho doesn't love dogs? Seriously! It was emotional!"
