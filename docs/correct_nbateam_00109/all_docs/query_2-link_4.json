        "text": "LAS VEGAS — On the day Zach Randolph officially signed a two-year, $24 million contract with the Sacramento Kings, the former Grizzly let it be known that Memphis will always occupy major real estate in his heart.\n\n“It was just a fit with a bunch of genuine people. I’m a genuine person. I’m a lovable and good-hearted person. And some things you can’t hide,” Randolph told The Commercial Appeal on Monday. “There are traits you just can’t hide. People see that. Memphis is home. It’s my city. It’ll forever be my city. I’m going to continue to be there. Those are my people. I guarantee you that.”\n\nRandolph visited the Kings at the Las Vegas summer league and addressed the media for the first time since agreeing to move West.\n\nRandolph, who turns 36 on July 16, never received a contract offer worth considering from the Grizzlies during free agency. Memphis made it clear that it would not match Randolph’s offer from Sacramento. The Grizzlies also immediately announced they would retire Randolph’s No. 50 in FedExForum.\n\nRandolph spoke with his veteran teammates Mike Conley, Tony Allen and Marc Gasol. Grizzlies owner Robert Pera also talked to Randolph and explained the economics behind the team’s decision to allow him to leave.\n\nRandolph said he thanked Pera for the jersey retirement and expressed his fondness for what the organization accomplished while he played in Memphis.\n\n“Man, you know it’s a blessing,” Randolph said. “(Retiring the number) is a lot about basketball but it’s more than just basketball. I want to thank the Grizzlies organization for everything and everything we did have. I’ll cherish the memories. I’m just thankful.\n\n“We had great teams and talent, especially the Core Four. We were missing a few pieces, but we definitely thought we could compete with anybody.”\n\nRELATED\n\nVince Carter on leaving Grizzlies: ‘No hard feelings’\n\nWayne Selden hungry to prove worth to Grizzlies\n\nCoach Fizdale happy with Grizzlies' direction\n\nMemphis was Randolph’s fourth NBA stop. No team enjoyed his stellar play on the court and big heart off it like the Grizzlies.\n\nRandolph played a critical role in the Grizzlies’ seven consecutive playoff appearances during his eight seasons in Memphis. The veteran power forward ranks first in franchise history in rebounds (5,612) and third behind Conley and Gasol in scoring (9,261 points).\n\nRandolph averaged 16.8 points and 10.2 rebounds in a Grizzlies uniform. A two-time All-Star, Randolph accepted a reserve role last season and excelled. He averaged 14.1 points and 8.2 rebounds in 24.5 minutes per game. His 20 double-doubles were the most by any bench player in the NBA.\n\nJust as Randolph filled big shoes on the court, his philanthropy resonated in the community. Randolph’s charitable work included annual $20,000 payments to MLGW toward helping families pay utility bills. He routinely offered food, coats and other gifts during the holidays.\n\nRandolph pledged that he would continue his annual $20,000 donation to help Memphians in need pay utility bills.\n\n“This is a lot different. It’s not comparable to leaving any other city,” Randolph said. “I’m just thankful that I had a good season, stayed healthy and was able to compete at a high level for the city.”"
