        "text": "WATTS (CBSLA.com) â€” Sacramento Kings power forward Zach Randolph was one of two men arrested after a mob confronted police at a housing project in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Watts.\n\nThe incident began Wednesday night at around 10 p.m. in the Nickerson Garden Housing Project near 112th Street and Zamora Avenue. Los Angeles police noticed a group of people gathering in the area. When officers responded, a mob formed and began to destroy police cruisers and throw objects at officers, prompting them to call for backup, police said.\n\nRandolph, 36, was taken into custody on felony charges of drug possession with intent to sell, police told CBS2. A second man, identified as Stanley Walton, was arrested on charges of being a felon in possession of a firearm.\n\nRandolph was booked at 4:23 a.m. Thursday in the Los Angeles County Jail, according to Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department inmate records. He posted bail a short time later.\n\nThere were no reports of any serious injuries during the disturbance.\n\nRandolph signed a two-year, $24 million deal with the Sacramento Kings this summer after spending the past eight seasons with the Memphis Grizzlies.\n\nHe has had a lengthy history of run-ins with the law dating back to his time with the Portland Trail Blazers in the early 2000s. In April 2009, while playing for the Clippers, he was arrested on suspicion of drunk driving on the 405 Freeway, according to the Los Angeles Times. The arrest resulted in a two-game suspension."
