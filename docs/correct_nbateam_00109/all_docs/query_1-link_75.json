The person spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because the deal cannot be signed until Thursday.\n\nESPN first reported the agreement.\n\nAfter a rocky start to his career in Portland and New York, Randolph found himself in Memphis. He spent eight years with the Grizzlies, emerging as one of the central figures of the team's \"grit and grind\" mantra.\n\nLast year, he averaged 14.1 points and 8.2 rebounds. He is expected to be a solid veteran mentor for a young Kings team."
