        "text": "Authorities say Sacramento Kings forward Zach Randolph’s brother was shot to death early Saturday outside a bar in the Indiana city where the two grew up.\n\nPolice said that an officer heard gunfire around 5 a.m. and found Roger Randolph bleeding between two cars outside of Hop’s Blues Room in Marion, which is about 60 miles northeast of Indianapolis. They said investigators don’t know the circumstances surrounding the shooting, but they don’t think it was a random attack.\n\nRoger Randolph, 35, had several brushes with the law, including for a 2004 shooting at a nightclub that wounded three people and landed him in prison.\n\nHe was sentenced to three years in prison in 2005 for his role in the nightclub shooting in Anderson, which is about 30 miles south of Marion and is where court records say he had been living when he was killed. The shooting apparently stemmed from a quarrel on the dance floor.\n\nZach Randolph was at the club that night and was questioned, but he wasn’t charged.\n\nRoger Randolph was charged last year with driving under the influence. There was a hearing last week in that case, which was unresolved.\n\nZach Randolph led Marion High School to a state championship in 2000 before heading to Michigan State University and then the NBA. In addition to the Kings, he has played for the Portland Trail Blazers, New York Knicks, Los Angeles Clippers and Memphis Grizzlies. He is a two-time NBA All-Star.\n\nRoger Randolph was also a gifted basketball player growing up in Marion, but he got into trouble and was kicked off the high school team and sent to a boarding school in Pennsylvania.\n\nLifetime honor\n\nHall of Famer Oscar Robertson will be honored with the NBA’s Lifetime Achievement Award at the NBA Awards on June 25.\n\nRobertson, the career leader with 181 triple-doubles and the first player to average one for a season, was the NBA’s Rookie of the Year in 1961, MVP in 1964 and won a championship with Milwaukee in 1971. The guard was a nine-time selection to the All-NBA first team and was voted one of the league’s 50 greatest players.\n\nHe also was co-captain of the 1960 U.S. team that won an Olympic gold medal and led Crispus Attucks High School to consecutive Indiana state championships, the first all African-American team in the nation to win a state title.\n\nRobertson also was president of the National Basketball Players Association from 1965-74.\n\nGrizzlies add coaches\n\nThe Memphis Grizzlies named Jerry Stackhouse, Nick Van Exel and six others as assistant coaches."
