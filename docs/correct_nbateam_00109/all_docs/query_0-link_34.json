        "text": "The Griz closed Game 6 on a 22-12 run to beat the Los Angeles Clippers, 90-88, on Friday night in Staples Center. There will be a Game 7 on Sunday in FedExForum at noon as the Griz tied the series by winning consecutive games and for the first time on the road in this series. Instead of faltering down the stretch as they had all series, the Griz stunned the Clippers by erasing an eight-point, fourth-quarter deficit. Memphis did all of the little things. The Griz got steals, offensive rebounds and made it nearly impossible for the Clippers to score at the rim. Center Marc Gasol led the Griz with 23 points, and Zach Randolph added 18 points and 16 rebounds. They were again the catalyst for powering the Griz toward extending the series. “It just being physical,” Randolph said of winning the battle inside. “And it was having it in our minds that it was going to be 48 minutes of pushing and shoving.”\n\nNaturally, Grizz coach Lionel Hollins was asked why he abandoned the inside-out approach down the stretch. His response was just as inexplicable as his decision to keep his best perimeter defender (Tony Allen) on the bench for almost all of the fourth quarter while the Clippers made a run. “If [Randolph and Gasol] took seven shots and made none [in the second half], that should tell you why we went away from it,” said Hollins, who is too smart to genuinely believe something so dumb. I mean, the man who outcoached San Antonio’s Gregg Popovich last postseason can’t seriously think it’s wise to go away from Randolph and Gasol — the only two Grizzlies who have ever been All-Stars as Grizzlies — because they missed their first seven shots of the second half when he spent Monday designing countless plays for Gay, who missed 17 of the 25 shots he attempted. So I’m just gonna chalk that answer up to Hollins choosing to be difficult. Otherwise, I’d have to rip a coach after a huge win, and I’d rather not do that because I’d rather look ahead."
