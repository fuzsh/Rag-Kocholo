        "text": "Zach Randolph was supposed to finally take the floor for the Clippers Monday night, after the team attempted to make a deal with the Knicks three days earlier. But the deal has yet to be completed, and David Aldridge is now reporting that it's \"in limbo because of a physical concern raised by the Knicks about [Cuttino] Mobley.\"\n\nThis concern about Mobley has caused the Knicks to hold off on signing the deal, and at this point it's unknown if they'll do so before the deadline, which is this afternoon. Players have 72 hours to complete a physical after a trade, and it's usually just a formality. In fact, teams involved in deals can actually waive the physicals altogether to have players available to suit up for their new teams more quickly, but in this case, the Knicks are taking the full amount of time to get an extra long look at Mobley.\n\nIt's unknown if Mobley has taken a physical yet; Mike Dunleavy said in a pregame interview that the Knicks \"had something not come back for them\" and couldn't sign off on the trade until it does. Dunleavy went on to speculate that the Knicks might be awaiting paperwork or results from some blood tests, but he expects things to be completed by the deadline. If you believe Aldridge's report though, it sounds like it's a much more serious issue, and one that might possibly keep the deal from being completed after all.\n\nUPDATE: ESPN's J.A. Adande is reporting that it's a heart issue, and that Mobley will be examined by a specialist later today. The deadline for the teams to complete the deal is 6:30PM EST.\n\nKnicks' Deal to Send Zach Randolph to the Clippers Is 'In Limbo' originally appeared on NBA FanHouse on Tue, 25 Nov 2008 01:30:00 EST .
