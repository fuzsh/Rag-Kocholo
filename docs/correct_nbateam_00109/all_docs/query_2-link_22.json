        "text": "FanJam\n\n·\n\nFollow\n\n8 min read\n\n·\n\nApr 24, 2015\n\n--\n\nby T.P. Stockton, featured FanJam writer\n\nThe Memphis Grizzlies are up 3–1 on an injury stricken Portland Trail Blazers side in the first round of the Western Conference Playoffs. Despite their (albeit less significant) injury woes, the Grizzlies went into this matchup as favorites. If Memphis had relied upon the odds and counted Portland out, they would have done so at their own peril, as they’re well aware of the chip on the shoulder that comes with being the underdog (especially considering the Rocket’s first round exit to the Blazer’s last year.) But true to form Memphis have performed excellently, without easing up and have done everything, from grinding in the paint, to making free throws, they’ve built a two game lead over Portland.\n\nWhile this matchup has been eagerly awaited by Memphis fans and the organisation itself as it meant it wouldn’t be another heart attack inducing series against the Thunder, Clippers or Spurs (who Memphis faced in it’s last seven playoff series), it likely holds special significance to one member of the Grizzlies above others. Zach Randolph spent his formative NBA years in Rip City playing for the notorious Jail Blazers who were looked down on by the people of Portland. Of that roster, only one player remains, LaMarcus Aldridge (Joel Freeland, the 30th pick in 2006, but was stashed in Europe and not brought over to the NBA by the Blazers until 2012), just in his rookie season for the overlap before Randolph was shipped on to the Knicks in ‘07, followed by the Clippers a year later before finding a home he made his own in Memphis. Of course, Randolph has played in Portland many times over the past seven seasons but a playoff return to the city has been exciting, in particular seeing Randolph go up against his replacement LaMarcus Aldridge in the paint.\n\nForgetting narratives, the Grizzlies were very impressive in the early season but suffered from a lull post All-Star break, which was partially due to injuries. They are however still a formidable side and are one of the best teams in the league when hitting their rhythm. A deep team with a solid five bench players — six if you include the emerging rookie, Jordan Adams, who has pleasantly surprised the Grizzlies lately. On top of the addition of Jeff Green (who has been less impactful than expected thus far) and Russ Smith.\n\nWhile these new additions and emerging talents are great, it is the core of the Griz that is the most important. If Mike Conley is the brains of this cringe-inducing metaphorical bear I’m about to describe, Marc Gasol and Tony Allen would be the claws, one offensive the other defensive (just roll with it!), then Zach Randolph is the heart. Memphis really need all four healthy to make any decent progress in the playoffs but if Randolph goes down they just seem to lose something more than the numbers he puts up. This is true of all players to some extent, but just seems more significant in the case of Randolph. He embodies the Grizzlies grit and grind spirit so thoroughly, it’s impossible to picture him on any other team for the remainder of his career. While Tony Allen has earned himself the nickname the “Grindfather”, Randolph has been key in forming that gritty identity in Memphis over the past few years. And although more recently the offensive torch has been passed to Marc Gasol from Randolph who is 33 and at a point where his intangibles seem to be as important as his statistics.\n\nJust as the majority of the NBA shifts in one direction with the shooting of the Warriors and Hawks and efficiency of the Spurs leading the way, Memphis has been opting for a style that harkens back to that of the early 2000s, 90s and beyond. Being a relatively new team, maybe they just felt like they missed out on the physicality of the previous decades and need to play catch up. A lot of Zach Randolph’s value lies in the toughness and resilience he brings to the team, that has helped get them so far. Even as the Grizzlies’ front office has taken on a more analytical approach over the last couple of years with the addition of John Hollinger as Vice president of basketball Operations, Z-bo has not just survived in Memphis but outlasted other’s on the roster who might play more to the new NBA’s style in Ed Davis, Tayshaun Prince and Quincy Pondexter. Rookie Jordan Adams seems to suit the new direction the rest of the league is taking and if he continues to develop this aging Grizzly team could have a brighter young future sooner than some might expect.\n\nIf you don’t buy into the ‘eye test’ and ‘intangibles’ argument, Randolph’s regular seasons stats this year are fairly consistent with the last couple of years, but a mild decrease in minutes this regular season has seen some of his numbers drop a little, the main exceptions being his FG% which is up by exactly 2% (shoot less make more) to 48.7%, and his rebounds have gone up by 0.4 to 10.4 rebounds per game. The drops are all miniscule and can be attributed to the fewer minutes he’s received and the addition of Green and Lee, even if neither are having a dramatic impact alone. Not to mention that Marc Gasol’s increased offensive output especially in the early season would have taken away from his numbers.\n\nOf minor interest is that he had the highest 3pt% of his career, but that doesn’t mean much when he’s only made 17 attempts beyond the arc this season, making seven of them. However, two of those seven were from beyond half court! That’s almost one third of his three’s scored from his own half. Here is one from a game against Sacramento in February:\n\nA few quick milestones from the regular season:\n\nAnd another?\n\nNo, just a bullet pass.\n\nZ-Bo dominated that side of the court the entire game finishing with 22 pts and 10 rebounds, the shot chart is below. In the second clip above, you can see the entire Mavericks lineup looks a bit shell shocked by the pass, although Calathes’ cut played it’s role.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Z-Bo’s main weaknesses is his temper, which can be taken advantage of by craftier players looking to provoke him. Saying that it’s not all down to other players and in that King’s game with the half court shot, he got riled up at one point and kept trying to trash talk DeMarcus Cousins who wouldn’t engage so then he turned to anyone who’d listen and was lucky to not get a double technical and ultimately elbowed Cousins in an ill-disguised move. As long as he keeps that energy in check and focused on the ball, he’s a serious asset to the Grizzlies in any matchup.\n\nRandolph despite having a temper that can flare up comes across as playful at times and there are often glimpses of a grin appearing through a mean mug after a big play, with the grimace usually dissipating as he throws his hands around in a curious and childlike fashion as he celebrates when running back down the floor.\n\nHis style of play, especially that jab step, is reminiscent of a boxer poking at his opponent looking for an opening, an old school brawler who seems a bit rough around the edges and what often looks like aimless flailing is just an improvised dance, always looking for that weak spot, constantly feinting, and right when they least expect it — there’s the uppercut in the form of a drive, spin move, assist or fade away.\n\nOr just some good old fashioned forcing his way into the paint for an and one against the future best player in the league, followed by ‘the strut’.\n\nRandolph may not be the top scorer for the Grizzlies in any game in the playoffs, but you can be sure he’ll make his mark on both ends of the floor when it counts.\n\n-T.P.
