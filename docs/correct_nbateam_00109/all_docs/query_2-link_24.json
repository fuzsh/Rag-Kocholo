        "text": "Pick-and-Pop is a weekly (or so) column on the Memphis Grizzlies and the NBA.\n\nQuick second-half scouting reports and to-do lists for the Grizzlies' young players.\n\nZach Randolph is making his Memphis return. Pick-and-Pop swoons in prose form.\n\nA first-time Man of the Matches recipient.\n\nDraft Prep: Top centers Deandre Ayton and Mohamed Bamba.\n\nWith playoff elimination a reality if not yet a mathematical fact, the rest of this Grizzlies season has to be about preparing for the next one. That doesn’t just mean accruing enough losses to ensure good draft odds. It means putting an emphasis on developing the young talent that makes up nearly half the roster, with seven players under the age of 24, even if progress on the latter goal can upend the former one.\n\nThat was the case this week. In back-to-back wins over the Lakers and Knicks, the Grizzlies got nice results from the kids: Dillon Brooks launching threes. Deyonta Davis swatting shots. Jarell Martin attacking the rim. Wayne Selden getting to the line.\n\nHeading into the summer, the Grizzlies need to get a better sense of what, if anything, each of their young players can be on the next good Grizzlies team. Here then is a guide to reasonable expectations for next season, and what it will take to get there.\n\nDeyonta Davis\n\nProjected Role: Back-up Center\n\nPrimary Need: Consistency\n\nDavis had five blocks against the Lakers and finished three alley-oop dunks against the Knicks. That kind of firepower at the rim makes him exciting, but it’s quiet, steady work on the boards and defensively on the block that will solidify him as an every-night contributor. Davis has a bit of a sleepy demeanor, but has the kind of skill set that demands a regularly revved motor. At this point, his rebounding production, even relative to his playing time, has been merely decent. He can, and needs to, do better.\n\nThe Grizzlies need to see more consistency from Davis to feel good about pencilling him in behind Marc Gasol to begin next season. Wednesday night against the Knicks was Davis’s first career start and only the fourth time in his young career he’s hit the 20-minute mark in a game. He needs more minutes, but also needs to earn them. The rest of this season should be an audition.\n\nDillon Brooks\n\nProjected Role: Glue Guy\n\nPrimary Need: Knockdown Three-Point Shooting\n\nBrooks’s month-by-month three-point percentage this season: 27%-33%-43%-50%. It can’t keep going up, but if Brooks can settle at something like his current 39 percent on the season, that would be great. Especially since he’s also a crafty finisher in the paint, making 62 percent of his shots in the restricted area this season. Brooks is the one young player in this mix who may already be what he can be.\n\nBrooks has started 35 games this season and counting, which could well end up being a career-high. But he can be a glue guy: A wing who can play the two or three, can start or come off the bench, can knock down shots and make hustle plays. His athletic limitations prevent stardom, but now that his shot is coming around, Brooks feels like a sure thing.\n\nWayne Selden\n\nProjected Role: Complementary Starter\n\nNeeds: Immediate Minutes\n\nSelden is a year-and-a-half older than Brooks and technically a second-year pro, but because he was a late call-up last season and has been injured much of this season, he’s well behind in playing time: 23 games and 341 minutes for Selden compared to 43 and 1,174 for Brooks.\n\nIf Selden hasn’t established the same level of production, he seems more projectable as a long-term NBA starter: His size and athleticism (6’5” with a 6’10” wingspan, strong and explosive) fits the mold for his NBA position better and gives him a chance to impact both ends of the floor. He’s a little bit different player -- more slasher than shooter -- but qualitatively you could compare him to a former Grizzly he faced off with on Wednesday night: The Knicks’ Courtney Lee. The question is production.\n\nThe application of Selden’s athleticism has been erratic so far in his brief career: He’s seemed solid defensively and so far is getting to the free-throw line at a high rate. But his length and strength hasn’t amounted to much in terms of grabbing boards or forcing turnovers. His shooting is also a work-in-progress: Selden hit only 3-21 from three with the Grizzlies late last season, but 7-19 so far this season. The stroke looks pretty good, but who knows where his accuracy will settle.\n\nSelden has been up and down in seven games since returning to the lineup from a quad injury. He needs all the minutes he can handle the rest of the season, and I’d make the case for force-feeding him a starting role the rest of the way.\n\nAndrew Harrison\n\nProjected Role: Backup Point Guard\n\nNeeds: To Find the Net\n\nHarrison’s athletic limitations can frustrate, but he grows on you the more you watch him. He plays hard and smart and has a sense of the moment. He’s a big guard who can defend and handle the ball, at least a little bit, which makes him a useful guy to have around. He just keeps forcing his way into the mix. It’s easy to see Harrison hanging around the back of the roster as a fill-in guy. But should he really be counted on as a rotation regular? As a rookie, Harrison shot 33 percent from the floor and 28 percent from three-point range. This season, his shooting is up to 38 percent and 31 percent, respectively. That’s better, but not good enough. Harrison needs to be more like a 42/35 shooter to solidify himself.\n\nJarell Martin\n\nProjected Role: Still a Mystery\n\nNeeds: Definition\n\nMartin barely made the Grizzlies to start the season and seems headed to a similar spot on the bubble this summer, but he’s really helped himself of late, with double-digit scoring performances in five of his past 10 games. But still, it’s hard to get a handle on what Martin is at the NBA level. He rebounds below what his size and athleticism would indicate and struggles at both ends of the floor when the game slows down. But Martin is a viable mid-range shooter who is a load attacking the rim when he has an opening. He thrives in a faster-paced game, which the Grizzlies haven’t historically played much. He remains a puzzle. Perhaps the second half of the season can help clarify his future.\n\nIvan Rabb and Kobi Simmons\n\nProjected Roles: Works in Progress\n\nNeeds: Time\n\nSimmons and Rabb, both 20 years old, have showed glimpses in limited minutes so far. Simmons is both fast and quick, but very light and with a jump shot that still needs work. Rabb is fundamentally sound but a little overmatched physically in the paint by NBA standards. It’s unlikely either will do enough to be counted on for a regular rotation role going into next season. They’re still long-range prospects with promise.\n\nThe Pick-and-Poll\n\nTwitter only allows four answer options on polls and I didn't think Rabb, Martin, or Harrison were likely to get many votes, though I did have one person respond that they would have voted for Martin.\n\nSimmons for me was too far away to really consider. Of the others, Brooks has, by far, proven the most. Davis might have the most upside. Selden is more in the middle and I gave him the nod because, as I indicated above, I think he's most likely to be a regular starter in the NBA if he can get fully on track. Brooks might be the right pick here, but I'd say the gap between him and Davis/Selden should be a little closer.\n\nLet’s Talk About How Much We Love Zach Randolph\n\nThis summer, when Zach Randolph signed with the Sacramento Kings, Pick-and-Pop offered a premonition:\n\nSome time next season, Zach Randolph will return to FedExForum in a Sacramento Kings uniform. He will snap on his headband, rub his soft mitts together, step across the sideline onto the court, and the building will come undone. Shane Battier Poster Night will be a distant memory.\n\nAmid this bedlam, Randolph will spot Marc Gasol, his longtime in-the-paint life-partner. The Big Trains From Memphis will be rumbling toward each other on separate tracks. They’ll exchange pounds, hugs, and maybe a trace of a tear. Then they’ll exchange hip checks and jabbing elbows. One will sail home a soft jumper over the other, then backpedal, laughing and slapping himself on the butt. We’ll exhale and enjoy the bittersweet spectacle. We’ll love Z-Bo like family and root for the Grizzlies to beat him, because that’s how it works. As Marc Gasol reminded us ... it’s bigger than basketball.\n\nThat day is upon us, with Randolph returning to Memphis Friday, January 19th, for his first game as a visitor since changing the course of this franchise. Randolph has had a nice season in Sacramento, but began a reduced role this week as the Kings turn toward the future. That should not impact Randolph's usage in this homecoming. His coach, another old pal, Dave Joerger, knows better.\n\nLast spring, in what many of us sensed was likely his last playoff series in a Grizzlies uniform, we collaborated on a tribute to #50. If Zach can get an encore this week, I'll give a portion of that tribute one too:\n\nIndividual memories are a flood, but what crystallizes is a kind of ideal. Basketball is an arena of personal style, and few players are as distinctive. So here’s to the jab-step and jutting hip. The thorny elbow and suction rebound. The ripple of #feed50 anticipation at FedExForum when Randolph seals his man near the hoop and a pass comes in low and true. The sartorial sacrament of the headband, the dislodgement of which inspires oh-no-he-didn’t gasps. Here’s to the mean-mug after a bully-ball bucket and the faint strut as he walks back toward the huddle. Here’s to Zach Randolph, the greatest of Grizzlies.\n\nPlay it again, Zach:\n\nMan of the Matches\n\nWith Marc Gasol missing one of the past week's three games, Tyreke Evans (17-6-9 averages) was once again the team's most productive player, with rookie Dillon Brooks deserving a mention for 15 points per game on 53 percent shooting. Those guys noted, we're giving the Man of the Matches this week to a total pro who brings it every night:\n\nCongrats, Pete!\n\nClip of the Week\n\nThis is actually from last week, but since we'll honoring Z-Bo this week, we'll throw a shout out to his also-departed sidekick with his selection from the popular genre \"game recognize game\":\n\nDraft Prep\n\nTwo weeks ago, when we began Draft Prep, we looked at top point guards Trae Young and Collin Sexton. Last week, we looked at two lottery-worthy bigs sharing a frontcourt in Duke’s Marvin Bagley and Wendell Carter. This week, we look at the draft’s top two true centers, Arizona’s DeAndre Ayton and Texas’ Mohamed Bamba.\n\nAyton and Bamba fit different types with encouraging current NBA comps. Bamba profiles as an elite rim protector in the Rudy Gobert mold, while Ayton profiles as a go-to scorer in the Joel Embiid or Karl-Anthony Towns mold.\n\nLet’s start with Ayton, because I’m guessing the draft will as well. If this were 20 years ago, I don’t think the top pick would even be under discussion. It would be Ayton, who looks every bit the classic franchise center.\n\nAt a reported 7’1” and 250 pounds with a 7’5” wingspan, Ayton would be slightly bigger than Towns and slightly smaller than Embiid. He seems to be a more accomplished post player than either were at this stage. Ayton’s combination of size, power, and footwork is special. He’s precise with spin moves, drop steps, side steps, using elbows to create extra space and rising above defenders to either finish with a soft touch or power the ball through the rim. He’s got a chance to be the best low post scorer in the NBA in short order. He’s that good.\n\nBut low-post scoring isn’t as highly valued as it once was. Can Ayton expand his game in the manner that Towns and Embiid have? He’s got nice touch on short jumpers but is only 8-24 from the college three-point line so far. There’s work to be done. Defensively, he’s not yet the force he should be given his athletic gifts. That footwork extends to the defensive end. He’s got the lateral quickness to guard on the perimeter and the quickness to recover. But 1.5 blocks per game is pretty meager for him at the college level. Ayton seems like a smart, unselfish player, but he doesn’t attack every possession the way that Marvin Bagley or Trae Young do. He’s fundamentally sound. But even when he does everything correctly, he doesn’t always do it with force, and this limits his impact.\n\nBamba’s reported 7’9” wingspan matches Gobert’s eyeball-popping measurement, and he’s only listed at an inch or so shorter. But Bamba's frame looks smaller to me and I wonder how much he’ll fill out. He gets dislodged pretty easily, even at the college level. I’d be reluctant in general to spend a high lottery pick on a center who doesn’t look like a first-option scorer and would be even more reluctant to do so for the Grizzlies, given the nagging Hasheem Thabeet history and the presence of both Marc Gasol and Deyonta Davis already on the roster.\n\nThat said, Bamba grows on me the more I watch him. He’s a special shot blocker, not just rejecting shots as they leave the shooter’s hands but frequently snatching shots from mid-air. It’s a spectacle. And he’s not plodding or paint-bound. He moves well enough laterally to defend on the perimeter and runs the floor well. He’s not polished in the post, but has a decent jump hook when he can’t get all the way to the rim. As a shooter, he’s willing and reasonably fluid, but they aren’t dropping quite yet (7-33 from college three). A good prospect and a potential elite defender, but I’m more skittish than most right now.\n\nTweet of the Week\n\nSince we're checking in on some old pals this week, this from Gasol the Elder is kind of the tweet equivalent of little bro's self-butt-slap, and well-earned. Also, Manu Ginobili is giving me life this season:\n\nReverse Standings Watch\n\nWe first checked in on current and projected reverse standings in this space two weeks ago. An update, starting with the current Top 10 in the draft lottery reverse standings:\n\nOrlando Magic 13-32 (--)\n\nSacramento Kings 13-31 (.5 games back)\n\nAtlanta Hawks 13-31 (.5)\n\nDallas Mavericks 15-30 (2)\n\nLos Angeles Lakers 15-29 (2.5)\n\nMemphis Grizzlies 15-28 (3)\n\nBrooklyn Nets 16-29 (3)\n\nPhoenix Suns 16-29 (3)\n\nChicago Bulls 17-28 (4)\n\nUtah Jazz 18-26 (5.5)\n\nAnd the projected finish, per fivethirtyeight.com:\n\nSacramento Kings 23-59 (--)\n\nAtlanta Hawks 26-56 (3 games back)\n\nOrlando Magic 26-56 (3)\n\nPhoenix Suns 27-55 (4)\n\nBrooklyn Nets 28-54 (5)\n\nLos Angeles Lakers 29-53 (6)\n\nMemphis Grizzlies 31-51 (8)\n\nDallas Mavericks 31-51 (8)\n\nChicago Bulls 32-50 (9)\n\nNew York Knicks 35-47 (12)\n\nIn two weeks, the Grizzlies have fallen from #4 to #6 in the current standings and have doubled their gap from draft pole position. In the projections, they’ve slid from tied for #6 to tied for #7 and I’d agree with the projections that Phoenix, in particular is a team to worry about.\n\nAs for projected reverse-standings chart-topper Sacramento, coach Dave Joerger recently announced he would start resting his veterans on alternate nights. I’d say Joerger has an advanced understanding of graceful tank principles, but there’s a chance the Kings find that, like the Grizzlies, playing the kids (the right move for both teams) could actually make them better.\n\nDo the Hustle\n\nAs suggested in this space two weeks ago, the Grizzlies used up Vince Hunter’s full 45 days of NBA service in order to give themselves the option of replacing his two-way slot with a different player ahead of the January 15 deadline for those contracts. In Myke Henry, a 6’6” wing player previously with the Oklahoma City Blue, they've replaced Hunter with the same type of two-way player: The replacement-level option rather than the long-range prospect.\n\nWhen the Grizzlies signed Hunter in the offseason, I think they were thinking he could be a fill-in option at a position with weak depth. At the time, I don’t think they expected Jarell Martin to make the roster and probably didn’t know quite what to expect from Chandler Parsons. With Martin making the cut and Parsons effective, at least early on, the need for Hunter evaporated.\n\nHenry, who’s averaged 16 points (on 51/37 shooting), 5 rebounds, and 2 steals in the developmental league this season, is already 25 and it’s easier to work wing players into the mix. The hunch here is that the rest of this season is an audition for a two-way next season, for which the Grizzlies have a team option. If the Grizzlies think Henry could add wing depth for the main roster out of the two-way slot, then he might be back again next season.\n\nA first look:\n\n100 (or so) Word Previews\n\nVs. Sacramento Kings (Friday): The Grizzlies are going to be favored for their first three-game winning streak since the season's first three games, and achieving it would give the Kings (1-9 in their past 10) even more breathing room in the draft lottery race. I'm burying the lead, though: This will primarily be about the return of Zach Randolph. They say there's no cheering on press row. That rule will be suspended when #50 takes the floor. And here's Dave Joerger comparing his current rookie point guard, De'Aaron Fox, to his old charge, Mike Conley:\n\nAt New Orleans Pelicans (Saturday): The Grizzlies missed Anthony Davis in beating the Pellies in Memphis a week or so ago. That’s unlikely to be the case this time around, as Davis is back on the floor, putting up back-to-back 45/15 games last week and he tries to push his way into an unsettled MVP race.\n\nVs. Philadelphia 76ers (Monday): Center Joel Embiid and 6'10\" rookie point guard Ben Simmons are two of the best and most distinctive young players in the Association. This will be their only time in town this season and the main reason I'm considering this one a must-attend.\n\nVs. San Antonio Spurs (Wednesday): With Kawhi Leonard out indefinitely, the Spurs are more vulnerable, losing games recently at Atlanta and at the Lakers. Tankers can't take this one for granted. Continuing \"Return Week,\" we'll welcome Pau Gasol and Rudy Gay back into the building.\n\nReach Chris Herrington at chris.herrington@commercialappeal.com or on Twitter at @chrisherrington and @herringtonNBA."
