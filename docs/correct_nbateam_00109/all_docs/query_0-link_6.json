        "text": "The Clippers have stockpiled a decent number of young players over the past year, but are suddenly lacking in solid veterans. Enter Zach Randolph. While Brice Johnson, Montrezl Harrell, and Diamond Stone are all somewhere on the depth chart at power forward and center, Zach Randolph is an established NBA player with a track record of excellence. He is old, yes, but still a capable role player.\n\nThe soon to be 36 year old has been a member of the Memphis Grizzlies since 2009, and was a core member of their Grit-n-Grind identity. Randolph was an All Star in 2010 and 2013, and averaged over 14 points and 8 rebounds last season in 24.5 minutes per game.\n\nRandolph is unlikely to command a salary of more than several million dollars a year, and would be a nice addition to a roster that, with Blake Griffinâ€™s return, should be in contention for a playoff spot in the 2017-2018 season.\n\nRandolph was a Clipper briefly in the 2008-2009 season, playing 39 games for the Clips. The only Clipper remaining from that era is DeAndre Jordan, who was in his rookie season."
