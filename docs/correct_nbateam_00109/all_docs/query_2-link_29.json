        "text": "MEMPHIS, Tenn. – Zach Randolph has gone full-circle in the Western Conference semifinal against the Oklahoma City Thunder, which means the series will now go full-cycle.\n\nIn Game 1, Randolph shot 12 for 22 from the field, scored 34 points and the Memphis Grizzlies cruised to a 114-101 victory.\n\nIn Game 6, Randolph again shot 12 for 22 from the field, again scored in the 30s and again Memphis cruised, this time to a 95-83 victory in FedExForum on Friday night.\n\nGames 2 through 5, he shot a combined 22 for 69 (.319) from the floor, all of which means nothing because Game 7 became necessary on Sunday at 2:30 p.m. in Oklahoma City Arena thanks primarily to Randolph.\n\n\"It seemed like he made every big shot for them,\" Thunder coach Scott Brooks said. \"He was mixing it up. It wasn't all inside. The guy is a player. When he gets it going, you only can do what you can do, and that's contest his shot.\"\n\nRandolph had a perfectly acceptable 10-point, two-rebound first half on Friday night, but went off for 20 points and 11 rebounds after intermission as the Grizzlies outscored the Thunder 51-29 in the second half.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, Randolph had 12 points and six rebounds in nine minutes.\n\n\"When your go-to player gets it going, it's a nice feeling,\" Memphis coach Lionel Hollins said.\n\nFreeing up Randolph was the addition of long-range shooter O.J. Mayo to the Grizzlies' starting lineup. Mayo finished with 16 points, four steals and four rebounds, but his mere presence was worth much more.\n\n\"It definitely makes a difference,\" Randolph said of Mayo. \"You have to guard O.J. He can make shots from the outside. It opened up a little bit tonight in the paint. We had great spacing. They had to guard our perimeters – Mike (Conley) and O.J.\"\n\nRandolph having some breathing room on offense is why Hollins opted for Mayo.\n\n\"I just felt in my gut that was the move to make,\" Hollins said. \"\"We weren't spacing the court. They were just clamping down on Zach with two or three guys. We felt like if we put a shooter out there they would have to honor him, and they did.\"\n\nSpeaking of honors, Randolph on Thursday became the first player in franchise history – including the Grizzlies' Vancouver days – to be voted as an All-NBA player. He was a third-team pick and was recognized before tipoff.\n\n\"I've been blessed,\" Randolph said of his selection. \"God has put me in this great situation here in Memphis. This city has been good to me.\""
