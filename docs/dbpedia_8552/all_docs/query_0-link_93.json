        "text": "Textiles were the second-most-traded commodity in all of world history, preceded only by grain. In the Ottoman Empire in particular, the sale and exchange of silks, cottons, and woolens generated an immense amount of revenue and touched every level of society, from rural women tending silkworms to pashas flaunting layers of watered camlet to merchants traveling to Mecca and beyond. Sea Change offers the first comprehensive history of the Ottoman textile sector, arguing that the trade's enduring success resulted from its openness to expertise and objects from far-flung locations. Amanda Phillips skillfully marries art history with social and economic history, integrating formal analysis of various textiles into wider discussions of how trade, technology, and migration impacted the production and consumption of textiles in the Mediterranean from around 1400 to 1800. Surveying a vast network of textile topographies that stretched from India to Italy and from Egypt to Iran, Sea Change illuminates often neglected aspects of material culture, showcasing the objects' ability to tell new kinds of stories.\n\nKnowledge is power and education is the means to achieve it. IICD is committed to the growth of the Craft sector through education. Education means over all development and growth of an individual and is much more than mere classroom learning. The faculty of research and innovation and preserving our heritage that teaches us many nuances is of prime importance when we talk of the crafts sector. A congregation of experienced and educated people in the sector of crafts, exchanging ideas and the research undertaken in this field, could create a powerhouse of learning. With this idea in mind, a conference on ‘Recent Trends and Sustainability in Crafts and Design’ was organised at IICD. Abstracts and full papers began pouring in. We received an overwhelming response from different institutes in India and from outside India too. Each one was unique and we realised the importance of a research platform in this sector. We received excellent papers from professors and students from IITs, NIFTs, NID, MSU Baroda, Lady Irwin College, G.B. Pant University, to name a few. Alongside the institutes, it was decided to invite our craftsmen, whose expertise is unparalleled and who have so much to offer in terms of skill and understanding of crafts. An artisan Panchayat was held, where eminent artisans from different craft fields were invited and an excellent talk ensued. The jajam on which they sat along with the faculty and staff of IICD and exchanged information in the dim light of the evening was a sight to behold. We were all mesmerised by the end of it. The candid conversation was enriched with information, experience and knowledge of each crafts person. Our Chief Guest Padma Shree Laila Tayabji, Dr Ghada H. Qaddumi (President, World Crafts Council, APR), all our session chairs, namely, Prof. Paul Singleton (Plymouth College of Arts, U.K.), Mr. Yunus Khimani (Director, City Palace, Jaipur), Mr. K.B. Jinan (Design enthusiast), Mrs. Devika Krishnan (Up-cycling enthusiast), Mr. Sharada Gautam (Head of crafts, Tata Trust), Ms. Ritu Sethi (Craft Revival Trust) and Dr. Anamika Pathak (Curator at National Museum, New Delhi; Chairperson of the Textiles and Clothing Research Centre (TCRC)) all the delegates, artisans, craftsmen, presenters and audience added much value to our first International Conference on crafts at IICD. The papers that were presented talked about the need for marketing, documentation and diversification of crafts alongside innovations in the field of dyeing and printing. The people who were present in the conference benefited from it and those not present, have this proceedings book to read from. I wish you all an enriching journey through the course of this book. I have to thank Prof. Bhargav Mistry, Dean at IICD, for his guidance and many thanks to Dr. Barun Shankar Gupta, Head of Research at IICD, who painstakingly worked for the success of this conference and for the compilation of this book. Toolika Gupta Director IICD\n\nAttentiveness to ethical and ecological sustainable practice is building in the garment industry. However, many researchers still consider the garment-making manufacturing system to be ethically and ecologically unsustainable. This thesis explores how industry connections between emerging Australian designers and traditional artisans in India can foster new possibilities for ethically sustainable collaborations. It draws on the experiences of forty-two fashion students collaborating with Indian textile artisans as well as the researchers twenty five years as a fashion practitioner, collaborating with Indian manufacturers. It is argued that firsthand experience for students working with artisans, suppliers and ethical manufacturing practices will increase awareness of the complexities of a sustainable fashion future. This research offers a sustainable model of collaborative practice for future generations of emerging designers, which will build a deeper understanding for better ways to source and design. For artisans, the significance of this thesis could be to build an economically sustainable practice considering contemporary design. It suggests ways to engage in ethical and sustainable practices working with Indian artisans. The outcome of this research aims to contribute to a growing field of ethical practice in fashion and textiles.\n\nThis thesis contributes towards the body of knowledge of the development of Arabic calligraphy, an art form that has passed through many historical stages since the advent of Islam and the revelation of the Holy Qur’an, in its patterns, styles, values and concepts. The relationship between Arabic calligraphy and Graphic design in Saudi Arabian culture and its creative industries is investigated; the arts and handicrafts policy of the Saudi government and the role of these in promoting and sustaining Arabic calligraphy is examined. Finally, the influence of five factors (financial, organisational, educational, social and technological) upon its development is analysed. The research is based on fieldwork conducted in Saudi Arabia (2016-2017). Mixed methods were used to collect data (questionnaire and interview). Fieldwork techniques allowed the opinions of calligraphers and graphic designers and the Saudi public to be known, allowing this study to be conducted from their perspective. Supporting literature was used to place Saudi Arabia within the larger context of arts, handicrafts and the creative industry. This research found that traditional Arabic calligraphic design has undergone an extraordinary development, where many of calligraphic styles have been created in a modern way to be used in graphic products. However, the connotations of the designs have changed in response to commercial requirements; in particular, their original religious contexts and significance are frequently neglected, thus changing people's perceptions, and their appreciation, of Arabic calligraphy. This research approaches this development. The implications of this research indicate a need for deeper understanding of the role that Arabic calligraphy plays as a symbolic representation of cultural heritage, identity of Arab-Islamic community and the language of the Qur'an, in light of challenges such as globalization, mechanization and technology.\n\n\"Kazakhstan's Crafts and Creative Economy\", jointly published by the Kasteyev State Museum of Arts (Almaty, Kazakhstan) and the Asian Cultural History Program, Smithsonian Institution (Washington, D.C., USA) presents papers delivered at the international scholarly symposium of the same title held in Washington, DC, on October 4, 2019, along with additional relevant papers solicited by the editors. The symposium brought together researchers from both institutions. The Kazakh scholars, staff of the Kasteyev Museum of Arts alongside the head of the Union of Artisans of Kazakhstan, here present compelling studies of Kazakhstan’s crafts. The American contributors, who are researchers in the Smithsonian’s Asian Cultural History Program, responded with papers presenting comparative examples of their own approaches to craft studies in the USA and elsewhere. The symposium was held at the National Building Museum, during the annual Smithsonian Craft2Wear Show, at which members of the Union of Artisans of Kazakhstan displayed many Kazakh craft works never before seen outside Kazakhstan. The book presents chapters by the volume’s two editors, Paul Michael Taylor (researcher and director of the Smithsonian’s Asian Cultural History Program) and Gulmira Shalabayeva (director of the Kasteyev Museum); by Aizhan Bekkulova (Union of Artisans); by Nataliya Bazhenova, Clara Isabaeva, Amir Jadaibaev, Svetlana Kobzhanova, Nurzhamal Nurfeizova, Yekaterina Reznikova, Galina Syrlybayeva, Oxana Tanskaya, and Gulaim Zhubabekova, and (Kasteyev Museum); and by Inigo Acosta, Jared Koller, Robert Pontsioen, and Jasper Waugh-Quasebarth (Smithsonian).\n\nKhayamiya, or Egyptian Tentmaker Appliqué, is a distinctly Egyptian architectural lexicon that has been ignored by most architects. The vibrant ornamental qualities of this art form are slowly gaining recognition by designers from other fields, such as fashion, interior design, visual art, and textile crafts, but it remains inexplicable that such an intensely visual aspect of Egyptian vernacular culture is not highly regarded, or even widely considered, as a national design icon of Egypt. This article will present an overview of khayamiya as a distinctly Egyptian architectural textile. The Suradeq, or khayamiya pavilion / street tent, is the exemplar par excellence of this rich and complex art form. Recent developments in technology and re-orientations towards international audiences have changed the work of the Tentmakers of Cairo, veering away from architecture, towards contemporary art. These changes both threaten and encourage the survival of khayamiya as an important Egyptian living heritage. There is a great deal yet to be contributed to contemporary Islamic architecture and design by those can re-assess the endangered art of khayamiya within its original architectural context: the Suradeq.\n\nTextile-based arts have long occupied vexed territory, characterised as being between binaries such as high and low art, amateur or professional practice, and craft or hobby. As a genre, it is often seen to sit on the fault lines of fine art, fashion and dress. In this ‘and/or’ space, textile art affects a kind of rupture to its attendant binaries where it can eschew rigidly defined classifications through its tendency toward cross-pollination. And, although it holds a well-documented position at the sidelines of the art historical canon, textile art has the distinct advantage of crossing class divisions even while being implicated within its own histories of gendered and racialised labour. Its broad range of mediums, techniques and processes make textile art a genuinely democratic form of material language. The far-reaching historical and cultural entanglements of textile art stretch back thousands of years. The story of textile arts is, quite simply, the story of human civilisation. Therefore, it has been subject to assimilation and adaptation, economics and politics, power, and the heavy legacy of empire."
