        "text": "Cloud Storage\n\nCloud Storage is the same as Online Storage or Internet Storage. Users can easily upload / download files on DriveHQ cloud storage system using DriveHQ FileManager, web browser, FTP Service or DriveHQ WebDAV cloud drive. Users can remotely access files from anywhere at any time.\n\nCloud File Server\n\nDriveHQ Cloud File Server works just like a local file server. You can drag and drop files / folders using FileManager, FTP or WebDAV cloud mapped drive; you can directly edit a remote file and save back; you can manage sub-users and sub-groups; you can share folders to different users with various permissions.\n\nCloud Backup\n\nYou can get rid of USB backup, DVD backup or tape backup. DriveHQ Cloud Backup is much better and more affordable than traditional backup solutions. You can backup / restore files from anywhere at any time without carrying a backup device. Also because it is offsite backup, it can survive any major disasters.\n\nCloud Computing\n\nDriveHQ Cloud computing is different. You can use our cloud service from anywhere, you don't need to relegate your PCs into dumb terminals. DriveHQ cloud computing extends your desktop software into the cloud. You can use your familiar sofware (e.g. MS Office, PDF, Photoshop, etc.) with our cloud service.\n\nCloud Drive Mapping\n\nYou can map DriveHQ online storage as a WebDAV cloud drive, such as Z: drive. No software needs to be installed. It is extremely simple. If you have a lot of files or very large files, you can also use DriveHQ FileManager or FTP.\n\nRemote Data Access\n\nUsing DriveHQ Online Storage service, you can access your data from anywhere using DriveHQ.com website, DriveHQ FileManager client, FTP or WebDAV cloud drive mapping. Business users can easily access their data from multiple offices, hotel or home.\n\nSecure File Storage\n\nDriveHQ online storage service is designed to be extremely secure and reliable. It is managed by professionals, colocated in a high-end data center with full redundancy and 24x7 onsite security. Your files are secure and private.\n\nDrop Box Folder\n\nDriveHQ Drop Box folder enables anybody to upload files to you securely without having to sign up and without hassle. Just provide your drop box URL, and anybody can drop files into it. Files in a drop box can only be accessed by yourself.\n\nSetup FTP Server\n\nTo setup, configure and secure an FTP server is never easy. FTP server may pose serious security threat as you must open a lot of network ports; managing FTP accounts and set permission is also a headache. DriveHQ FTP server saves you time and money, you can set it up in just a few minutes.\n\nFTP Server Hosting\n\nDriveHQ FTP Server Hosting service includes FTP server software, hardware and hosting. It is extremely easy to setup. Compared with other FTP hosting service, DriveHQ FTP service not only is a standard FTP hosting service, but also is seamlessly integrated with other DriveHQ cloud services.\n\nFTP Backup\n\nYou can backup files / folders to DriveHQ FTP server from any platforms. Files backed up to DriveHQ FTP server are secure and private. You can access these files using DriveHQ FTP, DriveHQ.com website or DriveHQ FileManager client software.\n\nFTP Security Camera\n\nDriveHQ can protect your data and your physical assets. Our subsidiary CameraFTP is a leading Cloud Surveillance, storage, recording and home security/ monitoring service provider.\n\nCloud Data Backup\n\nYou might have a very good backup solution in-house. However, in-house backup is inherently less secure / reliable than offsite backup. In case of major disasters, such as fire, flood, theft, virus, etc. both the source files and the backup files can be destroyed as they are in the same location. Offsite backup keeps your backup data in a different location, thus it is far more reliable.\n\nOnline Email Backup\n\nYou can backup emails using either DriveHQ Online Backup or DriveHQ EmailManager. Using DriveHQ Online Backup, you can backup the entire Outlook PST files or other email data folder. Using DriveHQ EmailManager, it is far more efficient as it can incrementally backup emails and contacts one by one and it only backs up new emails.\n\nRemote Backup\n\nIn-house backup such as tape backup is not flexible. You can only backup your data when you are in the same location. DriveHQ Online Backup is different. You can backup / restore your files & folders from any remote locations. No backup device or media is required.\n\nBusiness Backup\n\nYou can automatically backup servers and databases in your company; employees can also backup their PCs, laptops and MACs. Using DriveHQ group account service, you can allocate storage space and download bytes to your sub-users. All sub-users are treated as premium users. They can access backed-up files online from anywhere.\n\nSMTP, POP & IMAP\n\nSMTP is the standard protocol for sending emails; POP and IMAP are the standard protocols for retrieving emails. Most email client software (incl. Microsoft Outlook and Outlook Express) supports SMTP, POP and IMAP. POP3 is usually used for downloading emails to local; IMAP can keep all emails on server and automatically sync local and remote email boxes. DriveHQ email server supports all 3 protocols.\n\nAdvanced Email Features\n\nDriveHQ email server supports SMTP,POP3 & IMAP4; it also supports SSL. It has advanced features such as: Auto Reply, Auto Forward, Mailing List, etc. It supports custom email domains and group account service. You can easily manage your email accounts online.\n\nOutlook & Mobile Email\n\nDriveHQ email service can be accessed using almost any email client software / device, such as Outlook, Outlook Express, iPhone, Android, Blackberry and Windows Mobile, etc. Emails can be kept on server so that you can download emails from multiple computers / devices. Using IMAP, you can also sync your local and remote emails.\n\nEmail Backup\n\nYou can use DriveHQ Online Backup to backup emails. However, if you use Outlook / Outlook Express, then using DriveHQ EmailManager client software is much more efficient. You can drag-n-drop upload / download emails and contacts; you can setup automatic backup tasks to backup your emails and contacts to DriveHQ webmail.\n\nGroup Folder Sharing\n\nYou can create folders in your own account, then share different folders to different users with different permissions. You can also share folders to sub-groups and contact groups and set different permissions. The same folder can also be shared again with different permissions. Thus, multiple users can collaborate online.\n\nFolder Synchronization\n\nUsing DriveHQ FileManager, you can select a folder and click Synchronize to create a sync-ed folder. You can sync folders on different computers to the same remote folder, thus you can synchronize multiple computers. You can also sync folders of multiple users to the same group shared folder, thus you can sync folders of multiple users.\n\nMobile Applications\n\nDriveHQ service is available on all popular mobile platforms, incl. iOS (iPhone/iPad), Android and Windows Phone 7. Not only that, DriveHQ mobile application beats competitors' hands down!\n\nWhite Label Service\n\nDriveHQ reseller platform makes it extremely easy to launch white label (i.e. private label) or co-branded service. A co-branded service can be launched in just a few hours. The cost is extremely low at only $50-500/year, which is about 10 times lower than our competitors'. Resellers can customize or localize the website, service prices and client software. DriveHQ also has other partnership / affiliate programs suitable for any size businesses."
