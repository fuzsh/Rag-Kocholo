        "text": "A tall, upright fast-medium bowler and lower middle-order batsman, Iain Butchart was one of the key figures in the years immediately before Zimbabwe gained Test status, playing in 18 ODIs, both the 1983 and 1987 World Cups and also Zimbabwe's successes in the ICC Trophy. His one Test cap, against Pakistan in Harare, came in his final first-class match and was almost a (universally popular) recognition of his long service, although earlier that season he had made his maiden first-class hundred. He subsequently coached Zimbabwe's Under-19 side.\n\nMartin Williamson"
