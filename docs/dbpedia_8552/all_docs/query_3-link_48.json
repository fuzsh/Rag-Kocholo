        "text": "As the bagpipe world simmers into a very busy August many from overseas get their passports stamped ready to join the throng, compete against each other, but more importantly renew long and established friendships. Ken Eller won’t be making the trip this year and the piping world is a sadder place with news of his passing. For many years Ken travelled round the world spreading the gospel. An omnipresent figure in both the band and solo worlds, Ken’s sonsie face and banter will be sorely missed.\n\nThe Eagle pipers’ decided to dedicate their meeting in his memory and were delighted to welcome a good friend of Kens, Austin Diepenhorst, into the fold.\n\nThe band had a different look to it with around 16 pipers on the floor, including Ian Duncan, who was putting some air through his MacDougalls. Austin has been staying with Chris and Ian but has spent quite a bit of time going round the games where he has seen a great deal of success, winning the Highlands and Islands young piper of the year in Benbecula.\n\nAfter a good solid hour, on a very warm evening, it was time for a well earned beer and of course a pie. Newton was licking lips as the aroma wafted around the room.\n\nAustin started his performance by striking in a new set of cane Eddie Gaul cane reeds that had just been put in that afternoon. Not for the feint hearted but what a sound, full, rich and resonant. The pipe was made by Thomas Doucet who learned his trade by working with the late Jack Dunbar, who learned his trade at Peter Henderson’s in Glasgow.\n\nAustin played a few sets of Light music to settle the instrument down including an MSR that started with Bonnie Ann followed by The Cameronian Rant and Bruce Gandy’s reel, Miss Pitkeathly. Austin then spoke about his relationship with Kenny Eller and told a couple of heartwarming stories about him. He then played a lovely Lament for Mary McLeod in his friends memory. Ken would have loved it. We did.\n\nRest easy Captain.\n\nPipe Major Ken Eller 1947-2024\n\nEuan Anderson\n\nHon Pipe Major\n\nWith the Pipey and President both missing in action, it could easily have been a less than memorable evening, but to the contrary there was a good turnout including our own national treasure John Murphy, with one of his many sets of shiny and interesting pipes ready to play. It was a good start to the night and once refreshments and pipes were organised it was time for a few tunes.\n\nTaking the helm for the night was Eagles stalwart Kenny McBride, who’s no stranger to the piping world having a CV that includes playing with many of Scotland’s top bands, not least the Lothian and Borders Police Pipe Band of which he was Pipe Major.\n\nKenny’s pipe is often the go to set when it comes to tuning pitch on Eagle nights, which is a bit of a puzzle, as he claims never to have purchased a new pipe chanter reed, ever!\n\n14 pipers took to the floor, and amongst the diehards it was good to see some young talent in the ranks. New Eagle member Charlie Desson, Eaglet Hamish Murray, and his younger brother Fergus made a great addition to the line up. To settle the pipes we kicked off with the Green Hills set, followed by some tuning, then into Scotland the Brave, and then Castle Dangerous. This was followed by The Glendaruel Highlanders.\n\nThe pipes had a remarkably good sound after playing these first sets, which bolstered Kenny’s confidence, so next was the MSR. There were a few groans, we hadn’t played the MSR in recent times having been concentrating on new tunes and sound, so there had to be a quick tête-à-tête to confirm which tunes it included. Despite the dust and cobwebs on it, overall it was not a bad effort once we had tidied it up with a couple of restarts.\n\nSlowing the pace a bit we followed with the slow airs My Home and The Mist Covered Mountains, which saw us approaching mid evening and a chance for refreshments and pies. But just as we thought the first half done the Pipey Depute demanded we play The Curlew. This is the only jig in our tune book, and I suspect a favourite of Kenny’s. It’s a fine tune with a fair degree of technical difficulty, best we play it at a sedate pace we thought. Chance would be a fine thing! Off we went at full tilt, losing a couple of players along the way, and many more grace notes besides. A second run through was called for so after some guidance from Kenny off we went again with sweated brows and quivering fingers at the ready. Suffice to say it’ll take time, and it was time now for pies.\n\nIn the absence of a guest player for the evening, the floor was open and first up was Charlie Desson who recently became a full fledged member of the Eagles. After settling his pipes he played Miss Mary Grant of Lochgelly, followed by the slow air Row Me Home To Isla, and finished with the hornpipe Itchy Fingers. The latter was composed by Pipe Major Rab Pinkman of the King’s Own Scottish Borderers and became so popular on the competition circuit that Rab once said he was so fed up hearing it he wished he hadn’y written it!\n\nNext up were Hamish and Fergus Murray who doubled up to play a selection of 4/4s, Prince Charles’ Welcome to Lochaber, Walter Douglas, The High Road to Gairloch, and The Weary Maid. Both pipes sounding good. Fergus followed this by playing his MSR march Pipe Major Willie Ross’s Farewell To The Scots Guards with Hamish following on with his his march Arthur Bignold of Lochrosque. They promise full MSRs the nest time, we’ll look forward to that.\n\nNext up was Martin Wilson who, on his own, is worthy of a full match report, but we’ll save that for another time. With bold pipe he set off with the 6/8s Captain Craig Brown and Kenneth J Macleod, and following a quick re-tune he closed the night with the MSR Donald MacLellan of Rothesay, Maggie Cameron, and Willie Murray. And with that solid performance we were done.\n\nAn entertaining night, pipes, tunes, pies, refreshments and great crack.\n\nIain Dewar.\n\nPS Remember and get your tickets for the dinner.\n\nA good solid first half in warm conditions built up quite the thirst and the break for a pie and pint was most welcome.\n\nThe post pie piper was Hector Munro who is having his usual tilt round the games. Taking little time to settle himself in he went straight into a big competition MRS that was quickly followed by a hornpipe and jig finishing with the little heard Centre’s Bonnet, composed by Willie Ross.\n\nJames Alexander Center was born into an Edinburgh pipemaking family on April 14, 1875. His father John, born in Aberdeenshire in 1831, was a well known Edinburgh photographer and pipe maker by 1869.\n\nJames became a pupil of John MacDougall Gillies and a top competing piper and Highland dancer. He won the Gold Medal and the Clasp at Inverness on the same day in 1904, one of only a handful of pipers to achieve that distinction. He won the Gold Medal at Oban in 1906.\n\nHe followed his father into the pipemaking business. The family emigrated to Australia in 1907 and James Center died in Melbourne in 1919.\n\nHector gave his pipes a quick tune and played another technical piece, the piobaireachd, The Blind Piper’s Obstinacy.\n\n‘John Dall MacKay was one of the greatest pupils the Boreraig School ever held. Among the greatest pipers he and Charles MacArthur, composer of “Abercairney’s Salute,” seem to be nearer in ability to the MacCruimens than any others. So jealous were the MacCruimens of Dall MacKay that they attempted to destroy him. Blind, as the prefix “dall” signifies, he was a man of great natural ability and preternatural acuteness, and in a short residence at Boreraig he mastered all the jealously-guarded secrets, which were to the MacCruimens a valuable hereditary monopoly.\n\nTo preserve these secrets inviolate, they threw MacKay over a rock near Boreraig, but he escaped unhurt, and lived to a ripe old age. He was the friend and teacher of Lieut. MacLennan’s grandfather. Mr. MacLennan’s father was also a piper and so his knowledge of piobaireachd may be said to be a legacy from the MacCruimen School, from his forebears through John Dall MacKay, one of its greatest pupils.’\n\nHector made a very good job of this bold tune and the bagpipe held well. Perhaps not the tune for a cold games day but if the fingers are in form this tune will bring out the best in good technique.\n\nInveraray games are on Tuesday 16th July so that may impact on the next meeting but pop along for tune or a listen if you are in Edinburgh. Scots Guards Association Club, Haymarket Terrace, Edinburgh 20.00hrs.\n\nEuan Anderson\n\nHon P/M\n\nThe Eagle Pipers Society, with the support of Piping Live!, will be hosting a relaxed evening of international piping with performances from two of the worlds best pipers\n\nPiping Live! is delighted to be continuing their partnership with the Eagle Pipers Club, the renowned Edinburgh piping society. They are programming some fantastic music for this night, so head along to Edinburgh for some great tunes!\n\nOn the evening there will be 2 guest performers:\n\nEOGHANXO: Anxo Lorenzo and Eoghan Neff Innovation, experimentation and virtuosity are words that best describe this pair of stellar musicians. Over the past 15 years, they have become one of the most recognisable sounds on the international folk scene with an iconic union of Galician gaita and fiddle. This will be a first time welcoming them to the Eagle Pipers Club in Edinburgh.\n\nGreg Wilson is one of New Zealand’s most prolific solo pipers with multiple championships including Gold Medals at The Northern Meeting and the Argyllshire Gathering, three Clasps to the Gold Medal at The Northern Meeting, and three consecutive Silver Chanters at Dunvegan Castle. He has also won the Bratach Gorm (London) twice and has a record equaling four Braemar Gold Medals. We can’t wait to welcome this top level solo player to the Eagle Pipers Club.\n\nThe Eagle Pipers Society is an Edinburgh-based piping society which meets every second Tuesday at the Scots Guard Club in Haymarket. Haymarket train station is directly opposite making Glasgow an easy 45 minute train journey away.\n\nOur membership reaches worldwide and we are open to anyone with an interest in piping. We also organise the Cpt John MacLellan Memorial Dinner, a prestigious black-tie event celebrating the piobaireachd compositions of Cpt MacLellan.\n\nAnxo Lorenzo\n\nhttps://youtu.be/BJOGQz-64Eg?si=lUexiJ48bj195VIm\n\nThe Artists\n\nEOGHANXO\n\nThe Venue\n\nScots Guards Club\n\nUplifting. That was the general feeling post our visit from Lochgelly High school pipe band. If anyone ever questions what piping Societies are about and what they bring to the table, then evenings like this should be high on the ‘vision statement’.\n\nFresh from their success at the UK Championships in Ireland, in the novice juvenile grades, the kids were in great spirits and fine form.\n\nLife has come round 360° for their instructor Greig Canning, who is from Cardenden and was taught by Tom Brown. Greg graduated from the school band to play with the famous Dysart and Dundonald, a band he would later be Pipe Major of in 2011. He has also had spells with Manawatu, Shotts and Inveraray and District. He is currently the pipe sergeant of Police Scotland Fife but perhaps most pleasingly for him is witnessing the fruits of his labour teaching children. He should be immensely proud in what he is doing and the success the kids are attaining.\n\nOn the parade tonight we had,\n\nJack Drummond, Alexander Townsley, Liam Beveridge, Euan Hutt, Honor Henderson, Zeteny Nagy, Ellie Butchart, Joseph Townsley, Aaron McNee, Jordan Scott, Matthew Weir, Logan Grieve, James McNeil and Calvin Klym, a mix of both the A and B bands. They played as a combined unit and also played their prize winning performances in their own groups. Proud parents were on hand to support and record the evening and the bar of Guards Club was packed.\n\nAfter the pies (that went like snow off a dyke) 8 of the gang took turns in playing solo.\n\nJack played Donald Maclean’s Farewell to Oban, Alexander – The Seige of Delhi, Liam – The Genfinnan Highland Gathering, Euan – The Water is Wide, The Battle of the Somme and The Heights of Dargai, Honor – Glasgow City Police Pipers, Lt Maguire’s Jig, Zeti – P/M Willie Gray’s Farewell to the Glasgow Police, Ellie – Capt Norman Orr-Ewing. The final piper of the night was Joseph Townsley who settled the pipe with Dora Macleod & The Rejected Suitor and then treated the audience to a wonderful piobaireachd, Field of Gold, composed by Donald MacLeod.\n\nAll had first class technique but more importantly they all played musically and had a wee bit style about them. The audience were taken aback with the level of playing and everyone should be very proud in their first appearance at the Eagles. Hopefully we will hear more from them all in the future and the door is always open in Edinburgh for a tune. Thank you very much for taking the time to play for us and best wishes for the rest of the season.\n\nEuan Anderson\n\nHon P/M\n\nFollowing on from an excellent days piping at The Wheel of Fortune, where Craig Sutherland and Cameron Drummond (MSR-sponsored by EPS) shared the spoils, we had a surprisingly quiet night on Tuesday with only 7 pipers on the floor. There must be good weather somewhere. However the reappearance of John Murphy more than made up for this, and while still not in top form, it was great to see Murph sitting back enjoying the music.\n\nThe post pie piper was Iain MacDonald who warmed the pipe playing, In Memory of Herbie MacLeod, and then gave us MacFarlane’s Gathering.\n\nIn memory of Herbie MacLeod (of Arlington, Massachusetts) is originally a fiddle tune written by Jerry Holland. Herbie’s parents were Gaelic speaking people from Cape Breton. Herbie died in May 2000. Jerry Holland died in July 2009 and in tribute at his funeral the Strathspey and Reel Society of New Hampshire played this tune, along with a selection of his reels, in the 2009 Gala Concert. A great wee tune that the late great Alasdair Gilles had in his repertoire.\n\nThe MacFarlanes Gathering (Togail nam Bo) is a very melodic tune. The main published source for this tune is C. S. Thomason’s Ceol Mor, where it first appeared in print, identified as ‘Leech of Glendaruel & Gillies’ Version’ and ‘Set by Pipe Major Gillies after Piper Leech of Glendaruel’.\n\nThe tune was recovered in 1894 by John MacDougall Gillies following an appeal by piping historian and Gaelic scholar Henry Whyte (‘Fionn’) in the Oban Times.\n\nThere has always been discussion that this tune is similar to, or another version of, Too Long in This Condition, but John MacDougall Gillies states that it is a genuine tune in its own right. The tradition of Togail Nam Bo may have been composed by Andrew MacFarlane, who fell at Flodden, while Too Long in this Condition is ascribed to a MacCrimmon, maltreated as a prisoner after Sheriffmuir.\n\nOn a very genteel bagpipe Iain gave us a fine rendition of the tune and it was a great way to end the evening. Well done sir.\n\nAnd that was the evening’s evening. A date for the diary is our visit from Lochgelly High School on Tuesday 21st May, when instructor Greig Canning will be bringing along his charges for a tune. It will be on normal meeting night on Tuesday 7th May.\n\nEuan Anderson\n\nHon P/M\n\nAnother well attended practice night saw some 14 pipers on the floor. No sign of John Murphy as yet so hang in there John, get better and get back to the bar.\n\nThe solo piping season is well under way and Ben Duncan was the overall winner at the Scottish Pipers’ Association last weekend. A very busy and well attended competition held at the National Piping Centre. Alisdair Henderson won the overall at the Donald MacLeod memorial invitational and we have the Wheel of Fortune to look forward to on Sunday, 21st April, at Danderhall Minor Welfare Club, where 8 top players go head to head. (see our facebook page for further details).\n\nThe Eagle Pipers’ Society are sponsoring the first prize in the MSR event.\n\nCameron Drummond is the overall defending champion and he is in this years line up to try and defend his title. As a sneak preview Cameron was our post pie piper and kicked off with a couple off 2/4 marches, starting with the great John McColl’s March to Kilbowie Cottage. A couple of strathspeys and reels were next, followed by a snippet of a wee medley that featured the strathspey, The Maids of the Black Glen, that Cameron cleverly converted into common time structure.. Great stuff and it certainly it whetted the appetite for the main event in a couple of weeks.\n\nThe final player of the night was George Campbell who gave us the piobaireachd, Flame of Wrath for Squinting Patrick or Patrick Caogach. George got the drones, that were on the way up, in perfectly and presented the tune just as it should be, bright and brisk. The story of the tune may be as follows-\n\nDonald Mòr (MacCrimmon) had a brother who lived in Glenelg… who was known by the name of Patrick Caog, on account of a squint or defect in one of his eyes. This young man had a quarrel with his foster brother, a native of Kintail. Sometime after the dispute, while he was in the act of washing his face, in a burn or rivulet adjoining his dwelling, the Kintail man came behind him, and treacherously with his dirk gave him a mortal blow.\n\nThis being made known to Donald Mòr at Dunvegan, he prepared to revenge the untimely death of his brother, and taking his pipes up to MacLeod’s room, he threw them on the bed. MacLeod surprised, demanded to know what had occurred. In few words he related to him the affair, when the laird pacified the enraged piper, and promised him, on condition of his remaining at home, to see justice done before the expiration of twelve months.\n\nMacleod thought that his wrathful piper would forget the cruel murder by that time, and allow his ire to abate; but such was not the case, for on the termination of the twelve months, he set out himself for Glenelg, without informing any one of his intention; and finding on his arrival there that the murderer of his brother had gone to Kintail, he pursued his journey thither.\n\nThe offender, having been apprised of his arrival, concealed himself in the house of a friend; and the inhabitants of the village not choosing to deliver him up, MacCrimmon was so enraged, that he resolved to set their houses on fire and burned eighteen of their houses, which caused the loss of several lives. (This is called Lasan Phadruig Chaog, or a flame of wrath for Squinting Peter).\n\nDonald then made his escape to Lord Rea’s country, where he remained for some time under the protection of Donald Duaghall Mackay.\n\nThe story certainly reflects the feeling of the music as the rage and anger clearly comes across. Great tune George and many thanks for playing it for us.\n\nNormal meeting in a couple of weeks on Tuesday 23rd but perhaps we will see you at the Wheel of Fortune on the Sunday before?\n\nEuan Anderson\n\nHon P/M"
