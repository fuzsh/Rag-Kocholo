If anyone remembers him, please can they get in touch.\n\nThanks\n\nPamela Capper\n\npamelacapper@hotmail.com\n\nFlt Sgt Judy Maas\n\nI am seeking information 're Flt Sgt Judy Maas who enlisted in Sept 1943 and served In RAF HQ Cairo. Was there in 1946'\n\nRAF Regiment. 1951 - 53 Kabrit Egypt\n\nI served there from December 51 until March 53, a National Service Commission. Had a great time in 29 Sqd LAA Also was a member of the RAFGSA flying Tutors and Cadets at the weekend. Flew as passenger/Observer in Mosquitos and later Meteor NF 13's and Meteor 7' s\n\nAnyone remember me? Peter B Berriman\n\nNo 500 (County of Kent) Squadron\n\nI was member of 500 the County of Kent Squadron during my National Service. Interested to know if there are any like myself that are interested in communicating with each other to reminisce our days in the Squadron? I joined the RAF in 1950 and discharged February 1952.\n\nI am now in Australia, and have been since May 1957.\n\nYours Sincerely........D.S.Olive\n\nLAC Gun Armourer\n\n3500 (County of Kent) Fighter Control Unit\n\nI was a member of the 3500 (County of Kent) Fighter Control Unit based at Cliftonville in the mid 50s as a radar Operater, till it was closed down. I am now in my mid 70s so are there any members of this unit still around especially in the Herne Bay, Canterbury area?\n\nChris Errey\n\nHambuhren\n\nI was SAC George Vernon 4115478 stationed deep in the woods at an old Luftwaffe station in the village of Hambuhren in Germany. We were a listening station during the cold war in 1952/3 listening to Russian language and morse. I was trained first at Compton basset and then RAF withal. Wythal is no longer and is just a housing estate. I am 81 so there will not be may of us left. Does anyone out there know me?\n\nLooking for ex boy entrants of the 43rd entry (St. Athan) and a copy of the 43rd boy entrant journal.\n\nThe Boy entrants of 43rd entry (St. Athan) are notable by their absence. There appears to be no reference to the entry at all anywhere on the internet. We were there  honest!\n\nIn my 71st year I would love shed some light on the 43rd but too much water has passed under the bridge since our pass-out parade in December 1962. I have even lost all my training notes and more important, our entry journal, to an attack of woolly bugs whilst stationed at Changi, Singapore in 1964 to 67. The little mites got into my deep sea box in the store room of our barrack block and devoured almost everything. The journal would have helped to keep memories alive. If there are any 43rd entry (St. Athan) ex-boys who have the entry journal and can send me a copy or a spare original if you have one it would be most helpful to put us on the map. In the interim I will rack my brain and search my old photographs to see what I can come up with. I think that I can recall a fair percentage of those in hut N13 and my fellow tradesmen but that is all  so far. Lets put us up there.\n\nRegards,\n\nDon (ex D flight, 2 Squadron, 1 Wing, East Camp, RAF St. Athan.)\n\nFurther to the above: -\n\n43rd Entry Armourers RAF St. Athan Glamorgan\n\nN Lines, D Flight, 2 Squadron, 1 Wing (East Camp)\n\nWings I.T.S. *\n\nClive Atkey N12 N?\n\nBob Bailey N12 N?\n\nC ?

He was a U.S. (I think Air Force?) Colonel who was stationed in Germany. I don't have much to go on other than the family adopted a girl from Germany. I am not sure how old she was at that time. When she got older, she fell for a man from Yugoslavia. Apparently the Colonel and family didn't like it and she ran off with my dad. They had a child before me. Later, I would be given up for adoption. I don't know how many Colonel Noack's there could be but thought I would give this a shot. I hope this makes sense as I was trying to make this short and sweet.\n\nThank you!\n\nJamie\n\nRosemarie Price\n\nSACW Rosemarie Price served as a stewardes at RAF South Cerney Wiltshire 1959/60\n\nFlight Lieutenant Barry Grainger\n\nServed in the RAF around 1956 to 1959 or beyond flying English Electric Lightnings.\n\nHe was a good friend of mine,\n\nKeith Gray\n\nAnnie Baker\n\nI am trying to find Annie Baker....my birth mum. I was born on 18 August 1942 at 224 Maryvale Road, Kings Norton, Birmingham 30.All I know is that she had me, fathered by Sidney Glover of Swansea, who as a steelworker from Wales was in a reserved occupation and was involved in the production of ammunitions and was sent to Birmingham in the Second World War. Annie Baker was an aircraft machinist , maybe involved in production of parachutes, or uniforms...who knows! I am 72 years old now and I only new I was adopted 5 years ago....it was a huge shock to me. Since I have explored many avenues but to no avail. I do not have her date of birth nor whether she is alive or dead. I do not know whether she married.\n\nMy father took me back to Swansea and together with his wife adopted me in1945. They went to their graves without telling me of my origins. So I am trying to make the connection that Annie Baker was an aircraft machinist , but was she a civilian or was she in the RAF?\n\nAny help to find her would be gratefully received. Thank you.\n\nSylvia Powell ( nee Baker, nee Glover ) j_powell9@sky.com\n\nRAF Waddington 1948\n\nI am looking for anyone stationed at RAF Waddington in April 1948 and went to the April pleasure fair at South Park Lincoln Lincolnshire.\n\nMany thanks\n\nSue\n\nMarie Miles\n\nI am looking for anyone who was stationed in Bahrain from 1969-1970 who may have known my mum.
