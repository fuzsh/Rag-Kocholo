        "text": "Mumbai : England again hosted third edition of the cricket world cup. It was also called the Prudential Cup as Prudential insurance Limited sponsored this mega event as well. The tournament commenced from June 9 with the final being played on June 25.\n\nEight countries participated in the 1983 WC. They were divided into two pools Pool A consisted of England , Pakistan, New Zealand and Sri Lanka where as Pool B consisted of West Indies, Australia, India and debutants Zimbabwe.\n\nThe only difference was that each team clashed against each other in the Pools twice instead of once. With the top two teams of each pools qualifying for the semis.\n\nRead 'King' Richards and Collis King made the difference\n\nThis World Cup was filled with upsets. Teams like India and Zimbabwe who were considered to be less than underdogs scored upset victories over the West Indies and Australia respectively in their opening game. The highlight of the group stage was a revolutionary innings of unbeaten 175 by the Indian captain Kapil Dev. At a time when India were struggling at 5/17 later 7/78 and again 8/140 Kapil not only held the fort intact but played a blazing innings of 175 off 138 balls with 16 hits to the fence and 6 over it. Without this innings of Indian Captain, it would have been impossible for India to beat Zimbabwe and a defeat in that match would have ended India's adventure in the group stage itself.\n\nKapil's 175* helped India enter the semis for the first time. The other teams to qualify for the last four were England, Pakistan, and the tournament favourites West Indies. Upsets continued in the semis as well with fancied England going down to India. West Indies trounced Pakistan in the other semi finals.\n\nThe major upset was however reserved for the Grand Finale. Clive Lloyd and his West Indian side were more than happy to face India in the championship match. The entire team was confident to complete a hat-trick of World Cup triumphs. But there they went wrong. Their confidence turned into over confidence. So much so, that after restricting India to a paltry 183, the entire star studded Windies bundled out for just 140 bringing the entire cricket world to a pin drop silence and the commencement of a golden chapter in Indian history.\n\nThe only tragedy for India in this tournament was that nobody could watch the historic match winning innings of 175* by Kapil Dev. This was basically due to two reasons. First , the BBC was on a one day strike and the second being people were least interested about an India vs Zimbabwe match.\n\nNot only that innings of 175* , Kapil took one of the stunning catch in the games' history to get rid of Vivian Richards who was looking dangerous in the Grand Finale. West Indies vice captain scored 33 of 28 deliveries with 7 hits to the fence.\n\nMost Runs Scored (by an individual) :\n\nDavid Gower of England with 384 runs\n\nMost wickets taken (by an individual) :\n\nRoger Michael Humphrey Binny of India with 18 wickets\n\nHighest total (by a team) :\n\nPakistan 338 losing 5 wickets against Sri Lanka in the group stages\n\nLowest total (by a team) :\n\nAustralia 129 all out vs India in the group stages\n\nMatch of the tournament :\n\nIndia vs Zimbabwe (in the group stages) : India, batting first, were 4/9 . In came Kapil Dev , who told his teammates \"the match hasn't over yet\", and produced an innings that changed the complexion of the tournament. He remained unbeaten on 175 whilch propelled the team reach 266 , a defendable total. The team bundled out Zimbabweans for 235 to register a miraculous win.\n\nIndia vs West indies (Grand Finale) : After being put into bat, India skittled out for a modest 183. Fans had little doubts the match will be a cakewalk for the mighty Windies. Just before coming out to defend that small total, Kapsy said, \"Team, if this is not a winning total its definitely a fighting total\". One of the famous cricket quotes. West Indies chasing, were 1/50, fans have given up any hopes that existed. Kapil then proved what he said to his teammates by taking a excellent running catch to get rid of dangerous Viv Richards. This proved to be the turning point of the match.\n\nZimbabwe vs Australia (Group Stages) : Debutants Zimbabwe successfully defended their paltry total of 239 by restricting Australia to just 226 to register an upset win.\n\nSquads :"
