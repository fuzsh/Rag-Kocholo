        "text": "ZIMBABWE IN THE 1991/92 WORLD CUP -- OVERVIEW\n\nby John Ward\n\nWith thanks to Kevin Arnott, Eddo Brandes, Iain Butchart, Alistair Campbell, Kevin Duers, Andy Flower, Dave Houghton, Malcolm Jarvis, Andy Pycroft and Ali Shah.\n\nMatch reports\n\nSri Lanka | Pakistan | West Indies | New Zealand | India | South Africa | Australia | England\n\n1992 World Cup\n\nWith Zimbabwe's elevation to full member status of the ICC still in the future (although it took place in July 1992), the country again had to win the preliminary ICC Tournament in order to qualify. The ICC event took place this time in Holland; the team had been battling to maintain its standards over the past few years and had not been playing well against the B teams that had visited the country, and there were fears that on matting pitches and with Holland, their strongest opponents in the previous tournament, playing at home, Zimbabwe might slip up this time. In the event their fears were groundless; the Zimbabweans' greater experience and confidence against this type of opposition proved decisive and they again won all their matches without undue difficulty.\n\nGenerally, though, morale was not very high in Zimbabwean cricket circles. Their pace bowlers Peter Rawson and Kevin Curran had left the country at the peaks of their careers, and with Graeme Hick having left before that, there was the justifiable fear that any player of true international class was likely to be tempted to play elsewhere. The team to play in the World Cup of 1991/92 in Australia and New Zealand did still contain players who had formed the backbone of the side in their two previous tournaments -- Dave Houghton, Andy Pycroft, John Traicos and Iain Butchart -- but they were now approaching the veteran stage and it proved to be the last World Cup for them all, although only injury prevented Houghton from playing in a fourth tournament. The new players as usual tended initially to be overawed by the reputations of their opponents and took several matches to adjust.\n\nAs a result, the team struggled to compete in this tournament. Dave Houghton freely admits that they were not a good enough side; in addition they had not played in Australia or experienced their quick, bouncy pitches, especially against the strong pace attacks of some of their opponents. Their own attack contained no bowlers of real pace by international standards, and on Australian pitches that medium-fast pace proved to be little more than cannon fodder. They needed pitches that would give their seamers some assistance, and they were unable to prevent the opposition from scoring at a rate of five or six runs an over off them, which was always too much for their own batting. Given more favourable conditions, they would have been able to play more competitively, as they did in two of their three matches in New Zealand. Even so the players felt they should have won three matches; besides beating England, they thought they should have beaten Sri Lanka and India.\n\nAndy Pycroft also feels that too often their opening attack did not bowl well enough, unable to find the right line and length, and as a result the team was forever chasing more runs than they were capable of scoring. He also points out how badly Zimbabwe were handicapped as it was four years since they had last played at this level, while the other teams, except for South Africa who had just returned from isolation, had all enjoyed regular competition against each other.\n\nIn addition they suffered badly from injuries and were genuinely concerned at one stage that they might not be able to put eleven fit men into the field. After the West Indian match they applied for replacement players for Wayne James and Kevin Arnott, but this was rejected by the World Cup committee.\n\nHoughton believes that had they been able to play teams like New Zealand and Sri Lanka on the bouncy Australian pitches, or the West Indies and Pakistan on the slow pitches of New Zealand, the dice would not have been so loaded against them. It was Zimbabwe's misfortune that it was just the other way round; in New Zealand they were playing against the slow-wicket specialists, while in Australia they found themselves up against the teams with the strongest pace attacks. It was not until their last match against England where they found a pitch that suited their bowlers, and they pulled off a surprise victory. Kevin Duers also notes that the outfields in both countries were quicker than the Zimbabweans had been used to, having to play all the time on the thick kikuyu grass back home. That meant adjustments in batting and fielding.\n\nUnlike all the other World Cup competitions that have been played, this one was not played in two groups but rather on a round-robin basis. This was due to the late admission of South Africa, which took the number of teams participating from eight to nine, which would have unbalanced the groups. So each country found itself playing each of the others once, which for many people greatly increased their interest in the competition, but also gave rise to logistical problems, especially regarding transport and the fitting of eight matches per team instead of six into a four-week period. With a minimum of twelve teams taking part in the tournaments today, grouping has become inevitable. On this trip Zimbabwe played England, South Africa, Pakistan and Sri Lanka for the first time in official fixtures, although they had played the last three unofficially before, South Africa in a warm-up match in Harare immedi-ately before the teams left for Australasia.\n\nThe Zimbabweans were very impressed by the two countries, different though they may be. They found them clean, with excellent grounds and facilities, and the whole tournament very well organised. Travelling was well organised, and they enjoyed VIP lounges every time they travelled by air. There was a liaison officer provided at each destination to help them. In New Zealand, with shorter distances, they drove by bus between cities, and Ali Shah remembers how the roads were strewn with numerous dead possums; apparently at night, attracted by the lights, they have a habit of running out on to the road in front of traffic. In Australia they drove from Sydney to Albury, to find many dead kangaroos on the road. They did feel, though, that too much travelling was involved, especially between Australia and New Zealand, where conditions were so different. Out of the four weeks, they estimated that they had spent at least a week of that time either travelling or waiting at airport terminals.\n\nThe only unsatisfactory part of the arrangements, according to Andy Pycroft, was the practice facilities. Even at the Test match grounds, these facilities were 'shocking'. He remembers that time after time they arrived at their next venue with a day or two in hand, only to find that the nets were so poor that they could not practise properly. He himself found it particularly frustrating, as he ran into poor form and could find nowhere to put it right. They also had to play on poor pitches in Canberra and Albury, away from the main centres.\n\nAli Shah tells of an amusing incident when he missed a flight to Hobart from Sydney, which was their central venue when in Australia. Used to having to wait there for about three hours each time, he went for a walk around by himself, asking his roommate Eddo Brandes to call him if necessary. While in the bookstore he heard the announcer frequently paging a 'Mr Shaw', but did not realise that they had his name copied wrongly. After about half an hour he returned to find the departure lounge empty. He found an air hostess holding his bag and blazer and discovered that he was the missing passenger, but the flight was closed by then and the stewards would not let him through even though the plane had not taken off. He was forced to wait another six hours for the next flight. Brandes had not raised the alarm until the team was on the plane, and manager Derrick Townshend thought at first it was merely another typical tour leg-pull. That was still to come, though!\n\nWhen Shah finally reached his hotel in Hobart, he went to his room and found Brandes was not there, but a note was pinned to his pillow telling him that practice was at 5.30. He had about fifteen minutes hurriedly to unpack, change and rush downstairs -- where he found all the team downstairs having a drink and enjoying the joke!\n\nThen the Australian physio who was with the team managed to get hold of some notepaper with the letterhead of the Australian Board of Control, and forged a letter to manager Derrick Townshend, telling him that it was not acceptable for a manager to leave players behind and calling him to a meeting when the team returned to Sydney! Mr Townshend was most concerned and called a meeting of the team's lawyers, Traicos, Pycroft and Arnott, to discuss how to handle the problem. The three players had been let in on the joke and they pretended to take it all very seriously. Eventually they let Mr Townshend in on the joke!\n\nThe weather in the two countries was very different: New Zealand was similar to English conditions, wetter and with slower pitches, with Australia, except for Hobart, much hotter and sometimes humid, rather more like Zimbabwe, although the pitches were not. Australian grounds were very large, while those in New Zealand were smaller, generally with square boundaries. They also found the people in each country very different; they found New Zealanders generally much warmer and more laid-back than Australians, more like the Zimbabweans themselves, and, having been underdogs themselves for most of their Test match history, able to identify with them better. However, playing conditions tended to be better in Australia, although the Australians themselves tended to be more abrasive in their approach.\n\nThe team travelled first to Sydney, where they stayed overnight and were welcomed by Bob Radford and other friends of Zimbabwe from New South Wales. They travelled firstly to Queensland, where they were heavily and embarrassingly defeated in a one-day match by the state's second team, which was put down to jet-lag and lack of experience and practice -- and also fine bowling by Mike Kasprowicz. Kevin Duers says it took the team a long time to acclimatise: \"You could just see the guys weren't there; they were still back in Zimbabwe.\" A similar match against the full state side had to be abandoned due to the weather.\n\nThey then travelled on to Auckland in order to play some warm-up matches in the north island of New Zealand. They played a couple of practice matches against Northern Districts, losing the first by just one run, but fighting back to win the second by seven wickets. In this match they rolled the opposition over so quickly (for 81) that they had to play a second match on the same day to entertain the crowd -- which they again won. They were now finding their touch.\n\nThey were then scheduled to play a practice match against the full New Zealand team at Rotorua. The match might well have been counted as an official one-day international had the conditions not been virtually unplayable after heavy overnight rain. Helicopters were called in to dry the pitch (quite a coincidence that this should happen at a place called ROTOR-ua!), and when they finished Andy Flower and Wayne James managed to hitch a ride. They flew over the town and its hot springs while back at the ground the teams were preparing to play, and they just arrived back in time. Conditions really were still unsuitable, so it had been agreed just to play an unofficial practice match, 20 or 25 overs per side, for the benefit of the crowd. But, after New Zealand had batted for about ten overs, the rain returned and the match was washed out.\n\nThey returned briefly to Australia for the opening ceremony of the World Cup, which took place on a battleship in Sydney Harbour, with the bridge and opera house in the background. A mass dinner followed, with a table for each team. Sir Donald Bradman was present, and video clips were shown of the great man in action during his playing days, along with other Australian greats of the past. The teams in all their coloured kit walked around chatting to each other as they waited for the official photograph. One of the Zimbabwean players took a couple of photos of this, adding the caption, \"All the players mingling before the photograph was taken -- as usual, the Pakistanis on their own!\"\n\nAfter this, without much time to see Sydney itself at that stage, the teams departed for their first match, which in Zimbabwe's case was at New Plymouth in New Zealand against Sri Lanka. For the third time Zimbabwe began a World Cup campaign with a match they either won or should have done. As in India, it was merely a case of 'should have won'.\n\nThe crowds for Zimbabwe's matches were fair, generally numbering several thousand, with that in Hobart against Australia being the largest, followed by those at Napier and Albury. In most matches the crowd was mainly neutral and therefore tended to be passive; the most responsive crowd was in the match against England at Albury, where the Barmy Army was in attendance and the home crowd, who supported Zimbabwe, had some opposition to shout against. At the start of each match, unlike at the previous World Cups, just before the teams started play they would line up on the field facing each other while the national anthems were played.\n\nDave Houghton proved a capable captain of the team. He is a brilliant reader of the game and a fine tactician, but he found it harder to communicate with his team and encourage them on the field, as he himself has admitted. Such problems were not evident on this tour, though, where the team held together well and morale remained high despite the disappointing results. His team speak well of his efforts on this tour. The batting order was changed quite frequently, but this was partly due to injuries, especially to Kevin Arnott and Wayne James. Andy Pycroft was moved up the order to number three, but that did not suit him and he was out of form anyway. According to Malcolm Jarvis, one lesson that was learned from the tour was that Zimbabwe needed more full-time professional cricketers.\n\nThe coach was Essex bowler Don Topley, who Eddo Brandes feels was not experienced enough for the job and had not played international cricket in any case. Unfortunately the cash-strapped Zimbabwe Cricket Union were unable to afford a coach with greater experience. This meant that Zimbabwe were perhaps not as well prepared as they could have been.\n\nThe team very much enjoyed the tour off the field, finding the hospitality good and the organisation of the whole tournament excellent. On the field they generally maintained good relationships with the opposition, and there were no unpleasant incidents significant enough to spoil a match. According to Malcolm Jarvis, the normal method of socialising after a match was for the team which batted last to visit the changing-room of the side that had been in the field for a chat and a few drinks, although there was not always much time for this in the hectic programme and tight travel arrangements.\n\nHe, and several other players, name England and Australia as being the two best teams in this tournament from that point of view. New Zealand, trying to rebuild at Test level but very committed and successful in this tournament on their own pitches, remained more aloof, as did the South Africans, while the Indians and West Indians departed quickly. They did managed to mix briefly with the Sri Lankans after their match. Pakistan, under Imran Khan, did not seem to get on too well with any of the other sides; although they won the tournament, they were not popular winners.\n\nAndy Flower feels that the best part of this tour was its value as a learning experience for all the players. The Australians, he says, play such a positive brand of cricket that they could not fail to come back without having learned a great deal from them.\n\nThe nearest any opponents came to sledging was during the match against Pakistan, when Andy Waller and Iain Butchart led a late flurry in the Zimbabwean innings. The Zimbabweans now knew many of the players from other teams from past tournaments, and there was some catching up on old times to be done.\n\nMATCH SUMMARY\n\n23 Feb New Plymouth Lost to Sri Lanka by three wickets 27 Feb Hobart Lost to Pakistan by 53 runs 29 Feb Brisbane Lost to West Indies by 75 runs 3 Mar Napier Lost to New Zealand by 48 runs (revised) 7 Mar Hamilton Lost to India by 55 runs (revised) 10 Mar Canberra Lost to South Africa by seven wickets 14 Mar Hobart Lost to Australia by 128 runs 18 Mar Albury Beat England by 9 runs\n\nBATTING AND FIELDING STATISTICS\n\nM I NO Runs HS Av. 100 50 Ct/St A Flower 8 8 2 246 115* 41.00 1 - 6/1 A C Waller 8 8 2 192 83* 32.00 - 1 2 A H Omarshah 7 7 1 160 60* 26.66 - 1 1 D L Houghton 8 7 0 165 55 23.57 - 1 3 K J Arnott 5 5 1 94 52 23.50 - 1 1 I P Butchart 5 3 0 60 33 20.00 - - - A J Traicos 8 5 3 35 16* 17.50 - - - E A Brandes 8 6 1 71 23 14.20 - - 2 M P Jarvis 5 3 1 28 17 14.00 - - - W R James 4 3 0 35 17 11.66 - - 1 M G Burmester 4 3 1 17 12 8.50 - - 1 A J Pycroft 8 7 1 50 19 8.33 - - 3 K G Duers 6 2 1 7 5 7.00 - - 3 A D R Campbell 4 3 0 13 8 4.33 - - 1 BOWLING STATISTICS Overs Mdns Runs Wkts Av.

Born Bulawayo, 23 June 1957. RHB, occasional OB, wicket-keeper. First-class career 1978/79-1997/98, 120 matches (all for Zimbabwean teams, a national record); 22 Tests; 63 one-day internationals. Captain 1985/86-1986/87 and 1989/90-1992/93. First-class record: 7445 runs (Zimbabwean record), highest score 266, 17 centuries (Zimbabwean record), average 39.39. Tests: 1465 runs, highest score 266 (Zimbabwean record), 4 centuries, average 43.08. One-day internationals: 1530 runs, highest score 142, 1 century, average 26.37. Statistically, Zimbabwe's most successful batsman of all time, a fine all-round attacking batsman, especially against the spinners and famed for his ability with the reverse sweep. Zimbabwe's first Test captain, scoring 121 against India on his debut in 1992/93. Wicket-keeper until 1989/90. He will always be remembered for his wonderful innings of 142 in the first match of this tournament against New Zealand, but did not succeed against other countries. Played for Mashonaland Country Districts. Now Zimbabwe's national coach.\n\nARNOTT, Kevin John. Born Harare, 8 March 1961. RHB. First-class career 1979/80-1994/95, 35 matches; 13 one-day internationals, 4 Tests. First-class record: 1719 runs, highest score 121, 3 centuries, average 30.69. One-day internationals: 238 runs, highest score 60, average 23.80. Tests: 302 runs, highest score 101*, 1 century, average 43.14. An opening batsman who never really fulfilled the outstanding potential he showed before several years at university in South Africa where he played no first-class cricket. A brilliant fielder at cover or mid-wicket. Suffered a great deal from injured fingers which eventually persuaded him to retire. He was not really considered a one-day player, but scored two fifties, although rather slowly, when brought into the team later in this tournament. Played for Mashonaland Country Districts. He is today a lawyer in Harare.\n\nBRANDES, Eddo Andre. Born Port Shepstone (Natal), 5 March 1963. RHB, RFM. First-class career 1985 to date (records to end of 1998/99 Zimbabwe season), 54 matches; 56 one-day internationals, 9 Tests. First-class record: 1058 runs, highest score 165*, 1 century, average 16.53; 153 wickets, best bowling 7/38, average 31.18. One-day internationals: 383 runs, highest score 55, average 12.76; 69 wickets, best bowling 5/28, average 31.28. Tests: 111 runs, highest score 39, average 10.09; 22 wickets, best bowling 3/45, average 40.27. A fast-medium bowler, very destructive on his day but tends to be inconsistent and injury-prone. Can be a powerful hitter in the lower order. Taker of Zimbabwe's only hat-trick in one-day internationals, against England at Harare Sports Club in 1996/97. He was not always fully fit in this World Cup. Played for Mashonaland Country Districts and Mashonaland. He is a chicken farmer at Ruwa, just outside Harare.\n\nBURMESTER, Mark Greville. Born Durban, 24 January 1968. RHB, RMF. First-class career 1990/91-1995/96, 13 matches; 3 Tests; 8 one-day internationals. First-class record: 476 runs, highest score 67, average 29.75; 9 wickets, best bowling 3/78, average 61.00. Tests: 54 runs, highest score 30*, average 27.00; 3 wickets, best bowling 3/78, average 75.66. One-day internationals: 109 runs, highest score 39, average 18.16; 5 wickets, best bowling 3/36, average 42.60. A useful all-rounder, beginning as a bowler who could bat, but developed his batting later as a long-term back injury affected his bowling. Apart from a good spell of bowling against India, he did little on this World Cup tour. Now lives in Mutare and still plays for Manicaland.\n\nBUTCHART, Iain Peter. Born Bulawayo, 9 May 1960. RHB, RMF. First-class career 1980/81-1994/95, 53 matches; 1 Test; 20 one-day internationals. First-class record: 1686 runs, highest score 117, 2 centuries, average 23.41; 67 wickets, best bowling 5/65, average 34.04. Tests: 23 runs, highest score 15, average 11.50; 0/11. One-day inter-nationals: 252 runs, highest score 54, average 18.00; 12 wickets, best bowling 3/57, average 53.33. A fine all-rounder, at his best in tight situations; could be a devastating hitter and a good pace bowler at the death, and a superb fielder anywhere. Young Australian players once described him as perhaps the best one-day player in the world; he is still the only player to be a part of two current record World Cup partnerships. In this World Cup competition he almost won the first match for Zimbabwe, but after that showed little form. Played for Mashonaland Country Districts. Now a national selector.\n\nCAMPBELL, Alistair Douglas Ross. Born Harare, 23 September 1972. LHB, OB. First-class career, since 1990/91, 80 matches; 33 Tests; 97 one-day internationals. First-class record: 4058 runs, highest score 196, 4 centuries, average 32.46; 21 wickets, best bowling 4/82, average 39.90. Tests: 1589 runs, highest score 99, average 27.87. One-day internationals: 2483 runs, highest score 131, 3 centuries, average 29.55; 8 wickets, average 32.37. Captain since 1996/97. A stylish batsman with a fine record in a crisis but otherwise a tendency to throw his wicket away too readily. Zimbabwe's youngest batsman to score a first-class century. He was 19 years old at the time of this World Cup and was not then a regular one-day player; he did little in the few opportunities he was given.\n\nDUERS, Kevin Gary. Born Lusaka (Zambia), 30 June 1960. Tail-end RHB, RMF. First-class career 1984/85-1993/94, 30 matches; 6 one-day internationals. First-class record: 116 runs, highest score 15*, average 8.28; 77 wickets, best bowling 8/102, average 32.36. One-day internationals: 7 runs, highest score 5, average 7.00; 3 wickets, average 85.33. Strangely, as a seam bowler he had great success in first-class matches against New Zealand touring teams but much less against anybody else. Narrowly missed selection for the 1987/88 World Cup. This time he was not a regular member of the team and had little success. He still plays first-league cricket for Alexandra Sports Club in Harare.\n\nFLOWER, Andrew. Born Cape Town, 28 April 1968. LHB, occasional RSM or OB, WK. First-class career since 1986/87, 83 matches; 33 Tests, 105 one-day internationals. First-class record: 5507 runs, highest score 201, average 50.52. Tests: 2090 runs (Zimbabwe record), highest score 156, 5 centuries, average 43.54. One-day internationals: 3197 runs (Zimbabwe record), highest score 115*, 1 century, average 32.95. A determined batsman with superb temperament and technique, who can open the batting; also a steadily improving wicket-keeper. Captain 1993/94-1995/96, resigning due to the impossible demands of captaincy as well as leading batsman and wicket-keeper. His one-day century came on his debut in this World Cup tournament, but he did not do so well after that. Still Zimbabwe's wicket-keeper and leading batsman.\n\nJAMES, Wayne Robert. Born Bulawayo, 27 August 1965. RHB, WK. First-class career: 1986/87-1986/87, 40 matches; 4 Tests, 11 one-day internationals. First-class record: 2442 runs, highest score 215, average 38.15. Tests: 61 runs, highest score 33, average 15.25. One-day internationals: 101 runs, highest score 29, average 14.42. A rather late developer who became a fine wicket-keeper. His technique was perhaps a little too loose for him to be a success with the bat at international level, and Andy Flower was generally given the wicket-keeping job due to his superior batting. In a Logan Cup match between Matabeleland and Mashonaland Country Districts, he equalled the world record for most wicket-keeping dismissals in an innings (9) and set a new record for most dismissals in a match (13); he also scored 99 and 99 not out. Suffered injury in this World Cup and did not make much impression. Played for Matabeleland, latterly as captain, but retired prematurely as a result of problems with the Matabeleland administration. A businessman in Bulawayo.\n\nJARVIS, Malcolm Peter. Born Masvingo, 6 December 1955. RHB, LFM. First-class career 1979/80-1994/95, 53 matches; 5 Tests; 12 one-day internationals. First-class record: 510 runs, highest score 33, average 10.20; 163 wickets, best bowling 7/36, average 29.12. Tests: 4 runs, highest score 2*, average 2.00; 11 wickets, best bowling 3/30, average 35.72. One-day internationals: 37 runs, highest score 17, average 18.50; 9 wickets, best bowling 2/37, average 50.11. A left-arm swing bowler who developed late, turning in some of his best performances in his late thirties. A genuine tail-ender who could hit powerfully on occasions. He had little success in this World Cup, the conditions not suiting his type of bowling. Played for Mashonaland. Today runs a gymnasium in Harare and sometimes manages overseas tours.\n\nOMARSHAH, Ali Hassimshah (known as Ali Shah). Born Harare, 7 August 1959. LHB, RM. First-class career 1979/80-1995/96, 44 matches; 3 Tests; 28 one-day internationals. First-class record: 1703 runs, highest score 200*, 3 centuries, average 25.41; 35 wickets, best bowling 4/113, average 48.85. Tests: 122 runs, highest score 62, average 24.40; 1 wickets for 125 runs. One-day internationals: 437 runs, highest score 60*, average 16.80; 18 wickets, best bowling 3/33, average 45.11. The first Zimbabwean player of Asian origin, he is the only member of the team still playing first-league cricket in Zimbabwe. A great-hearted batsman who made his name with some fighting innings against the Young Australian tourists of 1982/83. He did not show great form in this World Cup, although he took some useful wickets. He often opened, but later in his career he usually dropped down the order. Nippy medium-pace bowling helped to make him an ideal one-day player, but his career was badly handicapped by his business interests. Played for Mashonaland. Still a regular player for Universals Sports Club in Harare.\n\nPYCROFT, Andrew John. Born Harare, 6 June 1956. RHB, occasional OB. First-class career 1975/76-1992/93, 72 matches; 3 Tests; 20 one-day internationals. Captain 1984/85-1985. First-class record: 4374 runs, highest score 133, 5 centuries, average 38.03. Tests: 152 runs, highest score 60, average 30.40. One-day internationals: 295 runs, highest score 61, average 17.35. Determined and consistent middle-order bats-man, usually at number four, with an outstanding record against touring teams to Zimbabwe in the 1980s. Good fielder in any position. He did quite well on this tour, scoring two fifties, but was twice run out and did not quite reproduce his best form. A lawyer, he retired soon after Zimbabwe achieved Test status due to pressure of work. A Mashonaland player. Now chairman of selectors and involved in coaching.\n\nTRAICOS, Athanasios John. Born Zagazig (Egypt), 17 May 1947. RHB, OB. First-class career 1967-1994/95, 122 matches; 7 Tests (3 for South Africa); 27 one-day internationals. Captain 1986/87-1987/88. First-class record: 1198 runs, highest score 43, average 11.40; 289 wickets, best bowling 6/66, average 34.60. Tests: 19 runs, highest score 5*, average 3.16; 18 wickets, best 5/86, average 42.72. One-day inter-nationals: 88 runs, highest score 19, average 11.00; 19 wickets, best bowling 51.94. One of the world's top off-spinners for much of his career, but rarely a destroyer as he relied more on accuracy than sharp spin and variation. Stubborn tail-end batsman and a brilliant gully fielder, as well as an astute thinker and tireless worker for the game. A record 22 years and 222 days between Test appearances; he played in South Africa's last three Tests before isolation in 1969/70 and then in Zimbabwe's first four Tests when elevated to Test status in 1992/93. As usual on this tour he was an invaluable member of the attack, tying down the opposition for match after match and never conceding more than 45 runs in his ten overs. He was 46 by the time of his last first-class match, still as fit as ever, but his duties as vice-president of the Zimbabwe Cricket Union and his coaching of younger players caused him to fade away rather than retire. Played for Mashonaland. He recently took up a business appointment in Perth, Australia.\n\nWALLER, Andrew Christopher. Born Harare, 25 September 1959. RHB, RM or OB. First-class career 1984/85-1996/97, 39 matches; 39 one-day internationals, 2 Tests. Captain 1989/90 before a back injury sidelined him for several months. First-class record: 1653 runs, highest score 104, 1 century, average 27.09. One-day internationals 818 runs, highest score 83*, average 23.37. An aggressive middle-order batsman who at international level was considered mainly a one-day player, where he opened the innings later in his career. A brilliant fielder at cover or midwicket. Batting at number six in this tournament until the final match, he scored quickly but rarely had much chance to build an innings. Farming commitments prevented him from playing regularly once Zimbabwe had been granted Test status and cricket became more time-consuming. Played for Mashonaland Country Districts. He farms at Centenary, in the north of Mashonaland.\n\nCOMPLETE ONE-DAY INTERNATIONAL CAREER RECORDS (to April 1999)\n\nM I NO Runs HS Av. Ct/St Runs Wkts Av.
