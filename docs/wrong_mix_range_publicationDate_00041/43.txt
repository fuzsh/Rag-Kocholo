NOVA EXPRESS.

Burroughs, William S.

New York: Grove Press, Inc., [1964]. Octavo, cloth. First edition. "The Nova Mob attempts to take over the Earth, in a 'hallucinatory interplanetary cops and robbers game.' Horrific, fragmentary and very funny in its ghastly way, this book about drug addiction and other forms of manipulation is in much the same vein as the author's THE NAKED LUNCH." - Pringle, The Ultimate Guide to Science Fiction, second edition (1995), p. 260.1966 Nebula nominee. [Reference: Anatomy of Wonder (2004) II-195. Pringle, Science Fiction: The 100 Best Novels 42. Survey of Science Fiction Literature IV, pp. 1566-70. Maynard and Miles A10a]. A fine copy in a nearly fine dust jacket with a touch of shelf wear to the lower front panel and a tiny closed tear to the upper right rear corner. (25420). Item #25420
