This copy is in near mint condition, with only very slight wear to top & bottom corners of spine & residue above & left of UPC on lower right of back cover, probably from removal of a price sticker. An increasingly rare item in itself, as well as a fine reading copy of these important works. Near Mint. [Item #1519]"
