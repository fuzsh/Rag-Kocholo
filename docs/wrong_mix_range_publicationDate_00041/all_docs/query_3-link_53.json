        "text": "Tomorrow is the 204th birthday of two of the most famous men of the last 2.04 centuries: Charles Darwin and Abraham Lincoln. Coincidentally, Darwin: A Graphic Biography has just been published by Smithsonian Books, who are based only 2 miles from Lincoln’s memorial.\n\nThis is the first time a book I’ve co-authored has been available to buy in American bookstores (as well as the usual online places), so I’ve written a post about how it happened.\n\nI had been a fan of Eugene Byrne‘s writing for years before our first book-length collaboration, Brunel: A Graphic Biography (2006). It was soon after that, while we were working on The Bristol Story, that we started thinking about a Darwin comic book.\n\nEugene knew the 200th anniversary of Darwin’s birth was approaching (Brunel had been a bicentenary project) and had told me about the excellent Darwin book by James Moore and Adrian Desmond, which I loved. We could see in Darwin’s life and ideas a lot of potential for another graphic biography. The Beagle voyage, it seemed to me, was perfect comic strip material and Eugene was fascinated by the history of the concept of evolution. We had seen Introducing… Darwin (1982), by Jonathan Miller & Borin Van Loon, but we wanted to use a more story-led format, which had proved successful with Brunel. We put together a proposal, which was commissioned by Andrew Kelly of Bristol Cultural Development Partnership (who had also commissioned both our previous books).\n\nThe first edition was only available in certain UK towns and cities, but there was demand for it from around the world. In the USA, librarians and teachers wrote requesting copies. In the Netherlands there was sufficient interest in the book for VPRO to invite me to take part in their documentary series Beagle, in het kielzog van Darwin.\n\nIn Washington DC, Brian Ireley of Cornell University recognized the value of the comic book format and tirelessly championed Darwin. Thanks to his efforts, Smithsonian Books saw it and approached us about publishing a new edition for U.S. readers.\n\nTo have our biography of Darwin associated with the Smithsonian Institution, home of the most visited natural history museum in the world, seemed the perfect fit. Eugene and I spent several weeks last year revising the text and creating new artwork.\n\nAfter more than twenty variants were considered, a new cover design was created using elements of my artwork. I’m really pleased with the cover and also with the paper quality inside."
