        "text": "Flexible, goal-oriented behavior requires combining diverse streams of sensory and internal state information from the present with knowledge gathered from the past to determine context-appropriate patterns of actions into the future. This presents the nervous system with several challenges. For many animals, selecting actions based on sensory input requires the dynamical transformation of information from sensors on one body part into a reference frame suitable for the activation of muscles on another (Buneo et al., 2002; Huston and Jayaraman, 2011; Huston and Krapp, 2008; Pouget et al., 2002). When integrating information from different sensors, the brain must also resolve any conflicts that arise between different cues. Further, maintaining goal-oriented behavioral programs over long timescales requires the brain to ignore transient sensory distractions and to compensate for fluctuations in the quality of sensory information or perhaps even its temporary unavailability. Brains are thought to solve such complex computational challenges by relying not just on direct sensory to motor transformations, but also on abstract internal representations (Moser et al., 2008). Abstract representations are useful not just in animal brains, but also in artificial agents trained to solve challenging navigational tasks (Banino et al., 2018; Cueva and Wei, 2018). In the brain, representations that persist in the absence of direct sensory input are thought to rely on attractor dynamics (Knierim and Zhang, 2012), which are typically generated by recurrent neural circuits in deep brain regions rather than just those at the sensory and motor periphery. A major challenge in understanding the dynamics and function of deep brain circuits is that—in contrast to early sensory circuits—their inputs and outputs are usually difficult to identify and characterize. Further, the attractor dynamics (Knierim and Zhang, 2012) and vector computations (Bicanski and Burgess, 2020) that characterize circuits involved in flexible navigation are thought to rely on structured connectivity between large populations of neurons. This connectivity is difficult to determine, at least in large-brained animals. Insects, with their identified neurons and smaller brains (Haberkern and Jayaraman, 2016), present an excellent opportunity to obtain a detailed understanding of how neural circuits generate behavior that unfolds flexibly and over longer timescales.\n\nInsects maintain a specific pattern of action selection over many minutes and even hours during behaviors like foraging or migration, and maintain a prolonged state of inaction during quiet wakefulness or sleep (Hendricks et al., 2000; Shaw et al., 2000). Both types of behaviors are initiated and modulated based on environmental conditions (e.g., humidity, heat, and the availability of food) and an insect’s internal needs (e.g., sleep drive and nutritive state) (Griffith, 2013). The context-dependent initiation and control of many such behaviors is thought to depend on a conserved insect brain region called the central complex (CX) (Figure 1, Figure 1—figure supplement 1; Helfrich-Forster, 2018; Pfeiffer and Homberg, 2014; Strauss, 2002; Turner-Evans and Jayaraman, 2016). In Drosophila, this highly recurrent central brain region, which is composed of ~3000 identified neurons, enables flies to modulate their locomotor activity by time of day (Liang et al., 2019), maintain an arbitrary heading when flying (Giraldo et al., 2018) and walking (Green et al., 2019; Turner-Evans et al., 2020), form short- and long-term visual memories that aid in spatial navigation (Kuntz et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2006; Neuser et al., 2008; Ofstad et al., 2011), use internal models of their body size when performing motor tasks (Krause et al., 2019), track sleep need and induce sleep (Donlea et al., 2018), and consolidate memories during sleep (Dag et al., 2019).\n\nThe precise role of CX circuits in generating these behaviors is an area of active investigation. Neural activity in the region has been linked to sensory maps and directed actions using electrophysiology in a variety of different insects (el Jundi et al., 2015; Guo and Ritzmann, 2013; Heinze and Homberg, 2007; Heinze and Reppert, 2011; Stone et al., 2017; Varga and Ritzmann, 2016). In the fly, CX neurons have been shown to track the insect’s angular orientation during navigation in environments with directional sensory cues and also in their absence (Fisher et al., 2019; Green et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2019; Okubo et al., 2020; Seelig and Jayaraman, 2015; Turner-Evans et al., 2017). Many computational models have been proposed to explain how the CX generates such activity patterns during navigation (Arena et al., 2013; Cope et al., 2017; Kakaria and de Bivort, 2017; Kim and Dickinson, 2017a; Kim et al., 2019; Stone et al., 2017; Su et al., 2017; Turner-Evans et al., 2017). However, a key untested assumption in most computational and conceptual models of CX function is the connectivity of CX circuits. Connectivity and circuit structure, in turn, can inspire models of function.\n\nAlthough the anatomy of the CX (Figure 1A–E) and the morphology of its neurons have been examined in a wide variety of insects using light-level microscopy (el Jundi et al., 2018; Hanesch et al., 1989; Heinze et al., 2013; Heinze and Homberg, 2008, Heinze and Homberg, 2009; Homberg, 2008; Lin et al., 2013; Omoto et al., 2018; Pfeiffer and Homberg, 2014; Strausfeld, 1999; Williams, 1975; Wolff et al., 2015; Wolff and Rubin, 2018; Young and Armstrong, 2010b), the synaptic connectivity of CX neurons has mainly been estimated indirectly from the light-level overlap of the bouton-like processes of one neuron and the spine-like processes of another. GFP-reconstitution-across-synaptic-partners (GRASP) (Xie et al., 2017) and trans-Tango (Omoto et al., 2018), methods that are limited in accuracy and reliability (Lee et al., 2017; Talay et al., 2017), have also been used to infer synaptic connectivity in the fly CX. Optogenetic stimulation of one candidate neural population and two-photon imaging of the calcium responses of another (Franconville et al., 2018) has allowed estimations of coarse functional connectivity within the CX, but this technique currently lacks the throughput to comprehensively determine connectivity at the single-neuron (rather than neuron-type) level, and cannot easily discriminate direct from indirect synaptic connectivity. There have also been efforts to characterize synaptic structure in the CX and associated regions with electron microscopy (EM) in the bee and locust (Held et al., 2016; Homberg and Muller, 2016), and a combination of coarse-scale and synaptic-resolution EM has been used to infer connectivity in the sweat bee (Stone et al., 2017). Most recently, the reconstruction of a small set of CX neurons within a whole-brain volume acquired using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Zheng et al., 2018) was used to examine the relationship between circuit structure and function in the head direction system (Turner-Evans et al., 2020).\n\nHere we analyzed the arborizations and connectivity of the ~3000 CX neurons in version 1.1 of the ‘hemibrain’ connectome—a dataset with 25,000 semiautomatically reconstructed neurons and 20 million synapses from the central brain of a 5-day-old female fly (Scheffer et al., 2020)(see Materials and methods). For most of the analyses, interpretations, and hypotheses in this article, we built on a large and foundational body of anatomical and functional work on the CX in a wide variety of insects. We could link data from different experiment types and insects because many CX neuron types are identifiable across individuals, and sometimes even across species. Thus, it was possible to map results from a large number of CX physiology and behavioral genetics experiments to specific neuron types in the hemibrain connectome.\n\nNot all parts of the dataset have been manually proofread to the same level of completeness (measured as the percentage of synapses associated with neural fragments that are connected to identified cell bodies). In the CX, some substructures were proofread more densely and to a higher level of completion than the others. Comparing the connectivity maps obtained after different extents of proofreading indicated that synaptic connectivity ratios between CX neuron types were largely unchanged by proofreading beyond the level applied to the full CX. This validation step reassured us that our analyses and conclusions were not significantly compromised by the incompleteness of the connectome.\n\nWe analyzed the connectome throughout the CX and its accessory regions. We also identified pathways external to the CX that bring sensory input to the region and others that likely carry motor signals out. Further, we discovered multiple levels of recurrence within and across CX structures through pathways both internal and external to the CX. Overall, we found that neural connectivity in the fly’s central brain is highly structured. We were able to extract circuit motifs from these patterns of connectivity, which, in turn, allowed us to hypothesize links between circuit structure and function (Figure 2, Figure 2—figure supplement 1).\n\nWe began by identifying multiple, parallel sensory pathways from visual and mechanosensory areas into the ellipsoid body (EB), a toroidal structure within the CX (Figure 1C). Neurons within each pathway make all-to-all synaptic connections with other neurons of their type and contact ‘compass neurons’ known to represent the fly’s head direction, creating a potential neural substrate within the EB for extracting orientation information from a variety of environmental cues.\n\nThe compass neurons are part of a recurrent subnetwork with a topological and dynamical resemblance to theorized network structures called ring attractors (Ben-Yishai et al., 1995; Skaggs et al., 1995) that have been hypothesized to compute head direction in the mammalian brain (Hulse and Jayaraman, 2019; Kim et al., 2017c; Turner-Evans et al., 2017; Turner-Evans et al., 2020; Xie et al., 2002; Zhang, 1996). A key connection in the subnetwork is from the compass neurons to a population of interneurons in a handlebar-shaped structure called the protocerebral bridge (PB; Figure 1C). The synaptic connectivity profile of the interneurons suggests that they ensure that the head direction representation is maintained in a sinusoidal ‘bump’ of population activity before it is transferred to multiple types of so-called ‘columnar’ neurons. In addition to receiving head direction information, many of these columnar neurons likely also receive input related to the fly’s self-motion in paired structures known as the noduli (NO; Figure 1C; Currier et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2020b; Lyu et al., 2020; Stone et al., 2017). The NO input may independently tune the amplitude of sinusoidal activity bumps in the left and right halves of the PB. Some classes of columnar neurons project from the PB back to the EB, while others project to localized areas within a coarsely multilayered and multicolumnar structure called the fan-shaped body (FB; Figure 1C). The loosely defined layers and columns of the FB form a rough, two-dimensional grid. FB columnar neurons convey activity bumps from the left and right halves of the PB to the FB. The PB-FB projection patterns of these neurons suggest that their activity bumps in the FB have neuron type-specific phase shifts relative to each other, similar to those observed between EB columnar neurons that are thought to update the head direction representation in the EB (Green et al., 2017; Turner-Evans et al., 2017; Turner-Evans et al., 2020).\n\nEach FB columnar neuron type contacts multiple FB interneuron types, each of whose individual neurons collectively tile the width of the FB. These interneurons have neuronal morphologies that are either ‘vertical,’ in that they connect different layers within an FB column, or ‘horizontal,’ in that they extend arbors across intervening columns. These columnar gaps between synaptic connections made by each horizontal interneuron can be interpreted as phase jumps in the context of activity bumps in the FB. The many FB interneuron types form a densely recurrent network with repeating connectivity motifs and phase shifts. Taken together with the self-motion and sinusoidal head direction input that many FB columnar neurons are known to receive in other structures, these motifs and phase shifts seem ideal to perform coordinate transformations necessary for a variety of vector-based navigational computations. The FB interneurons also provide the major input to canonical CX output types. The phase shifts of the output columnar types between the PB and the FB are well suited to generate goal-directed motor commands based on the fly’s current heading (Stone et al., 2017).\n\nIn addition to the columnar neurons and interneurons, the FB receives layer-specific synaptic inputs from multiple regions, including the superior medial protocerebrum (SMP). Some of these inputs link the FB to a brain region called the mushroom body (MB), which is involved in associative memory and is the subject of a companion manuscript (Li et al., 2020). These layer-specific inputs reinforce an existing view of the FB as a center for context-dependent navigational control, a structure that enables different behavioral modules to be switched on and off depending on internal state and external context. The architecture and connectivity of the FB suggest that the region may provide a sophisticated, genetically defined framework for flexible behavior in the fly.\n\nPrevious studies have established a role for both the dorsal FB (dFB) and the EB in tracking sleep need and controlling sleep-wake states (reviewed in Donlea, 2019). Our analysis of these circuits suggests that there are more putative sleep-promoting neuron types in the dFB than previously reported, many of which form reciprocal connections with wake-promoting dopaminergic neurons (DANs). Furthermore, these dFB neuron types have numerous inputs and outputs, and form bidirectional connections to sleep circuits in the EB. Our results highlight novel neuron types and pathways whose potential involvement in sleep-wake control requires functional investigation. Finally, we identified multiple novel output pathways from both the EB and ventral and dorsal layers of the FB to the lateral accessory lobe (LAL), SMP, crepine (CRE), and posterior slope (PS) (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). These regions themselves host networks that project to many brain areas and neuron types that ultimately feed descending neurons (DNs). DNs project to motor centers in the ventral nerve cord (VNC), allowing the CX to exert a wide-ranging influence on behavior, likely well beyond the navigational and orienting behaviors most often associated with the CX. Indeed, the regions that are targeted by the output pathways are associated not just with sensory-guided navigation, but with innate behaviors like feeding and oviposition and with associatively learned behaviors. Another remarkable feature of the CX’s output pathways is the large number of collaterals that feed back into the CX at each stage. Such loops could implement various motor control functions, from simple gain adaptation to more complex forms of forward models.\n\nIn summary, our analysis revealed remarkable patterning in the connections made by the hundreds of neuron types that innervate different structures of the CX. In the ‘Results’ section, we describe this patterned connectivity in some detail. In the ‘Discussion’ section, we synthesize these findings and explore what this patterned circuit structure may imply about function, specifically in the context of vector-based navigation and action selection. Although many readers may prefer to jump directly to the ‘Results’ section that discusses neuron types, circuits, and brain regions related to their particular research focus, we recommend that the general reader identify the ‘Results’ section that most interest them by first reading the ‘Discussion’ section."
