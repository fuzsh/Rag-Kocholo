Other than mineral water, he could not find anything he liked. This gave him the idea for starting his own soft drinks business.\n\nUsing his own savings as finance, Gary spent the following 18 months researching his idea and developing a business plan for his enterprise. When everything was ready, he launched his company, Vitz Drinks, and started selling his own range of low-calorie, vitamin soft drinks sold under the Vit Hit brand name. The drinks were a success and Gary became a successful entrepreneur.\n\nHe then saw an opportunity for another range of soft drinks using organic fruit juice. To develop and successfully launch this new product, he realised that he needed more money. He did not want to use any more of his savings and did not want to take out a large loan. Instead, he decided to sell a 17% share of the business to an investor in return for €250,000 in cash. This extra equity finance allowed Gary to launch the Organic Fanatic range of soft drinks. This new range of products also proved very successful and his drinks are now distributed in thousands of retail outlets throughout Ireland as well as being exported throughout Europe.\n\n1. What is business? Business is about producing goods and services and supplying them to customers. The food you eat, music you listen to, books you read, and clothes you wear, are all designed, produced, distributed and sold by businesses. 6\n\nChapter 1 Introduction to People in Business\n\nA business is any organisation set up to provide goods and services. A business can be commercial or non-commercial. A business can be privately owned or publicly owned. Commercial businesses provide goods and services to make a profit for the owners. Profits are made when a business takes in more money from sales than it has to pay out in costs. Examples: Dunnes Stores and Volkswagen. Non-commercial businesses (also known as social enterprises or not-for-profit businesses) exist to meet some needs other than making a profit. Many not-for-profit businesses do not charge for the services they provide. Instead, they generate revenue from other sources such as fundraising, donations or government grants. Examples: Charities such as Bóthar, Trócaire, campaigning organisations such as Greenpeace and sporting organisations such as the GAA.\n\nOL\n\nPrivate sector businesses are owned by private individuals.\n\nShort Q1\n\nExamples: Vitz Drinks, Sony. Public sector businesses are owned by the state. Some, such as Electric Ireland and RTÉ, are run as commercial businesses. Others, such as the National Museum, are run as non-commercial businesses.\n\n2. Who are the stakeholders involved in business? Stakeholders are the different groups of people who are directly affected by how a business is run. The stakeholders in Vitz Drinks business are Gary Lavin (the entrepreneur), his investors, employees, consumers, banks, suppliers, government and wider society.\n\nInternal Stakeholders The Business\n\nOwners (e.g. entrepreneurs, shareholders) Managers\n\nLenders (e.g. banks)\n\nEmployees\n\nExternal Stakeholders Suppliers and Service Providers\n\nCustomers\n\nLocal Community and Society\n\nGovernment\n\nFig. 1 Different types of business stakeholders.\n\nEntrepreneurs Entrepreneurs are people who take the initiative to turn an idea into a business. Commercial entrepreneurs like Gary Lavin see an opportunity to make a profit but also take the risk that the business might fail. They could be wasting their time and lose the money they put in. Social entrepreneurs, like the founders of Bóthar and Greenpeace, want to provide some service or achieve some goal that they believe is important to society. The State will sometimes act as an entrepreneur and set up a new business, for example Irish Water.\n\nBusiness stakeholders include:\n\n• • • • • • • •\n\nEntrepreneurs Investors Employees Managers Producers Customers Suppliers Government\n\nEntrepreneurs and investors need each other. The entrepreneur needs the investor to provide the finance to start and grow a business. The investor needs the entrepreneur to establish a successful business that will generate a reasonable financial return for the investor’s money. 7\n\nBusiness Express Unit One\n\nInvestors Often entrepreneurs will not have enough money to start a business. Investors are the people who provide a business with the finance it needs. This finance can come from owners’ capital, loan capital from banks or grants from State agencies.  Owners’ capital is money invested by people or companies. In return they become part owners of the business and are entitled to a share in future profits. Owners’ capital is also known as equity capital.\n\nExample: Gary Lavin invested his own savings into his soft drinks business and also secured finance from investors in exchange for a share of the business.\n\n Loan capital finance is provided by banks or other lenders and has to be repaid, with interest, within a certain period of time.\n\n Grants are usually provided by State agencies such as Enterprise Ireland and Local Enterprise Offices. A grant is a gift of money that does not have to be repaid as long as certain conditions are met, such as creating a certain number of new jobs.\n\nEmployers and employees As soon as the entrepreneurs recruit people to work in the business they become employers. Employers recruit staff to work for them. Employers’ rights include:  Recruiting employees when they need them  Directing employees to perform the work required  Dismissing employees fairly (according to the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977 to 2007)\n\nEmployers’ responsibilities include:    \n\nProviding a written contract of employment Paying wages as agreed in the contract of employment Providing safe working conditions Complying with all employment laws Example: Gary employs staff to produce and sell his soft drinks. He wants hard-working and enthusiastic staff who will contribute their skills to the long-term success of the business. Gary can reward his staff financially with wages and bonuses, and non-financially with extra holidays and flexible working hours. Employees are recruited by businesses to assist in the business in return for a wage. Employees’ rights include:  Receiving a written contract of employment  Being paid the agreed wage  Working in a safe and healthy workplace  Freedom to join a trade union\n\nEmployees’ responsibilities include:\n\n8\n\n Following instructions (as long as they are reasonable and legal)  Doing a fair day’s work for a fair day’s pay  Being honest and loyal in their work\n\nChapter 1 Introduction to People in Business\n\nManagers Managers are the people responsible for running the business and achieving its goals. In some businesses, the entrepreneur may also be a manager. They must:\n\n Plan, organise and control all aspects of the business including people, finance and equipment  Have the leadership, motivation and communication skills needed to manage staff and to communicate effectively with stakeholders.\n\nExample: As the business grows, Gary will have to take on managers to help him cope with producing and selling his expanding range of drinks in Ireland and abroad.\n\nProducers and suppliers Producers are the businesses that make products to sell to customers. They transform raw or recycled materials, machinery, finance and human effort (labour) into finished products for sale. Example: Vitz Drinks produce soft drinks. Suppliers are the businesses that supply the raw materials needed by the producer. Example: Suppliers provide the organic fruit, water, bottles and labels needed to make Vitz Drinks range of products. Service providers are businesses that supply the services needed by a business. These services include insurance, banking, telecommunications and transport.\n\nConsumers Customers are people who purchase goods from a business for their own use or for resale to others. Example: Someone buying a bottle of Vitz Drinks’ Organic Fanatic is a customer. Centra and SuperValu are also customers when they buy Vitz Drinks products for resale in their stores. Consumers are a type of customer who buy goods and services purely for their own use, not for resale. Example: A person buying a bottle of Organic Fanatic from a shop for their lunch is a consumer. Customers and consumers are the most important people in business because they provide the entrepreneur with a market and possible profits.\n\nSociety Society refers both to the local community where the business is located and to wider society, both nationally and globally. Society wants businesses to behave in a socially responsible manner and not to damage the environment or the welfare of others. This means not infringing on other people’s rights or welfare, such as by selling dangerous products or generating pollution.\n\n9\n\nBusiness Express Unit One\n\nGovernment\n\nOL OL Short Q2, 3, 4, 5 OL Long Q1, 2, 3\n\nHL HL Short Q1, 2, 4\n\nInterest groups represent the interests of different stakeholders.\n\nImportant interest groups representing business owners\n\nIBEC, the Small Firms Association, ISME, local chambers of commerce and industry trade associations.\n\nGovernment refers to local and national authorities that set the rules and regulations by which businesses must operate. This includes national government, local authorities and State agencies. Changes in government laws or taxes can affect how a business is run and what profits are earned. The government wants businesses to:  Provide jobs  Pay their fair share of taxes  Obey the law In return, the government provides services such as schools, hospitals, roads and policing needed by business and society.\n\n3. What are interest groups? Stakeholders in business may be represented by interest groups. Interest groups are organisations representing people (or stakeholders) who share a common interest or goal. Also known as pressure groups, they try to influence the behaviour and decisions of others by engaging in lobbying, negotiation, boycotts or legal actions. Lobbying refers to a deliberate effort by interest groups to influence decision-makers by promoting a particular point of view. It is often done through requesting meetings and generating favourable media coverage for the interest group on radio, television, print media and the Internet.\n\nBusiness interest groups and trade associations Business interest groups represent the interests of businesses. Examples:\n\n IBEC (Irish Business and Employers Confederation) is the main organisation representing large- and medium-sized businesses in Ireland. It attempts to influence trade unions, the Irish government, the European Union and wider society on issues relevant to its members such as legislation, taxation and employee pay and conditions. It also provides advice to its members on economic and business matters. The Small Firms Association speaks for and advises small businesses. It is part of IBEC.  Irish Small & Medium Enterprises (ISME) speaks for and advises small- and medium-sized enterprises. It is independent of IBEC.\n\n Chambers of commerce aim to protect and promote businesses located in their area. Example: Killarney Chamber of Commerce. Trade Associations are business interest groups that represent businesses involved in similar types of activities. Examples:  The Society of the Irish Motor Industry (SIMI) represents garages and car dealers.  The Food and Drink Industry Ireland (FDII) is the main trade association for food and drink manufacturers in Ireland. It can represent Vitz Drinks.\n\n10\n\n RGDATA represents the interests of independent grocery retailers.  The Irish Farmers Association (IFA) represents farmers. As farming is a large and important part of the economy, this association is very active in lobbying decision-makers at national and EU level on issues affecting farmers.\n\nChapter 1 Introduction to People in Business\n\nOther stakeholder interest groups There are also many other interest groups representing stakeholders such as employees, consumers, environmental and other specialist interests in the local community and wider society.  Trade unions are organisations that represent the interests of employees in a business on issues concerning pay or conditions of employment.\n\nExamples: SIPTU, ASTI, TUI. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU) represents the interests of all trade unions and their members nationally. It is a very important interest group as it is in regular discussions with IBEC, the government and the EU on issues affecting employees. Most trade unions in the country are members of the ICTU.\n\n The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission is the State agency responsible for promoting fair competition and protecting consumer interests.  The Consumers Association of Ireland is a private, not for profit organisation that represents and lobbies on behalf of consumer interests. It is independent of the government. Members of the public can support this organisation by becoming members.\n\n Environmental and specialist interest groups are also important in business. They represent the interests of members of society who want to prevent undesirable activities or to promote some cause they believe is important.\n\nOL OL Short Q6, 7, 8 OL Long Q6, 7\n\nHL OL Short Q5, 6, 7 OL Long Q4, 5\n\nExamples: Greenpeace, the GAA.\n\nCase Study: Ben and Jerry’s Big Adventure After leaving school, best friends Ben Coen and Jerry Greenfield did not exactly become roaring successes. Ben dropped out of five different colleges before trying his hand at a variety of jobs including pottery teacher, cleaner, security guard and taxi-driver. Jerry wanted to be a doctor but twice failed to get into college and ended up with a job he disliked.\n\nBen and Jerry eventually decided to become entrepreneurs and set up a commercial business together making ice cream. They completed a simple course in ice cream making and passed with flying colours. With investment from €6,500 in savings and a €3,000 bank loan they bought an ice-cream machine and rented an old petrol station that they converted into an ice cream ‘scoop-shop’.\n\nDuring the summer their shop filled with customers. Ben & Jerry’s quirky flavours, rich ingredients and chunky fillings were an instant hit with consumers and sold out nearly every day. In winter they would go around selling the ice cream to restaurants. Within three years, they had moved to new and larger premises and were selling the ice cream in pint tubs to shops and restaurants for miles around.\n\nIn the competitive ice-cream market, the larger and well-established Haagen Dazs company took exception to Ben & Jerry’s growth in the luxury end of the market and started competing aggressively against them. However, Ben & Jerry’s adopted a competitive approach to dealing with their larger rival by retaliating with their own, more effective advertising and publicity campaign.\n\n11\n\nBusiness Express Unit One\n\nHaagen Dazs backed down and Ben & Jerry’s Ice Cream was now well established in consumers’ minds.\n\nSince starting up, Ben & Jerry’s has grown into a business with thousands of employees and global sales of over hundreds of millions of euro. They have developed their own style of business management that involves having a cooperative approach to stakeholder relationships. For instance, the business has a staff committee, known as the ‘Joy Gang’, responsible for making the business as happy a place to work as possible. Dairy farmers are paid well for supplying highquality milk. The company strives to be environmentally friendly and nearly everything in the factory is recycled. Furthermore, every year employees are encouraged to do some voluntary community work during work hours and 8% of profits are given to charities in the local community. Some cynics say it all seems too good to be true. They claim that this ‘right-on’ attitude and hippie packaging is just a marketing ploy to win customers from rivals. Ben and Jerry respond that caring is central to business success. ‘It helps profitability,’ says Jerry, insisting that the two can go together.\n\nRecall and Review\n\n1. Identify the stakeholders in Ben and Jerry’s business.\n\n4. What relationships exist between the different stakeholders in business? In business, the relationships between stakeholders have the following characteristics:    \n\nStakeholder relationships are based on each having different wants Stakeholder relationships can be competitive Stakeholder relationships can be co-operative Stakeholder roles and relationships can be dynamic/change over time\n\nEach stakeholder in business has different wants and depends on other stakeholders to satisfy those wants.\n\n12\n\nChapter 1 Introduction to People in Business Stakeholder\n\nWants\n\nOffers in return\n\nInvestors\n\n• Profit on investment • Possible share in the\n\n• Finance • Business expertise and\n\nEmployers\n\n• Honest and reliable staff • Motivation and hard work\n\nEmployees and managers\n\n• Good pay and conditions • Secure employment • Opportunities to develop\n\n• Pay and conditions • Training • Promotional opportunities\n\nSuppliers and service providers\n\n• Prompt payment • Loyal customers\n\n• Raw materials and services\n\nCustomers\n\n• Quality goods and services • Fair and affordable prices\n\n• Payment for goods/services • Loyalty and repeat business\n\nEntrepreneurs/Owners\n\n• • • • •\n\nProfit Control of business Finance and support Skilled workers Minimal risk\n\nownership\n\nLocal community and wider society\n\n• Local jobs • No damage to local •\n\nGovernment\n\ncommunity, wider society or the environment Support and sponsorship\n\n• Compliance with all laws •\n\nand regulations Taxes paid in full and on time\n\n• • • • • •\n\nIdeas and initiative Goods and services Employment and wages Taxes Share of profits Interest on loans\n\nadvice\n\n• Skills and qualifications • Hard work and motivation • Honesty and reliability\n\nat the right quality and right prices\n\n• Favourable public opinion • Socially responsible brand image\n\n• Fair laws and regulations • Political stability and legal • • •\n\ncertainty Tax incentives Grants, business advice and support Infrastructure and services\n\n5. What is the difference between co-operative and competitive relationships in business? The relationship of a business with its different stakeholder groups can be either competitive or co-operative. The competitive approach views the relationships between different stakeholders as being a win/lose one. It assumes that only one party can win and therefore stakeholders must compete to gain a commercial advantage over the other.\n\n13\n\nBusiness Express Unit One\n\nCompetitive approaches see business as a win/ lose relationship. This approach is best suited to dealing with rivals in the. marketplace. A co-operative approach sees business as a win/win relationship. This approach is best suited to managing relationships between stakeholders.\n\n A competitive approach is suitable for dealing with rival firms in the marketplace. Example: Ben & Jerry’s adopt a competitive relationship with rival ice cream producers. This involves monitoring the prices and products offered by rivals to ensure that their business remains competitive and attractive to consumers.\n\n The competitive approach can be unsuitable for dealing with business stakeholders as it can damage the reputation of the business. Example: If Ben & Jerry’s decided to lower its quality standards to save money it could damage the reputation of the business among customers and cause a drop in sales and profits. This could result in some employees being made redundant, reduced orders for suppliers and service providers, and a drop in tax revenue for the government.\n\nA co-operative (or partnership) approach views the relationships between different stakeholder groups as potential win/win situations for all sides. A business with a cooperative attitude will seek opportunities to work in partnership with stakeholders and not against them. Example: During a recession, a partnership approach between employers and employees in a business may result in them working closely together to save the business, such as employees agreeing to take a pay cut to reduce costs and employers agreeing not to make any staff redundant.\n\nChanging roles: As a business grows, the roles of different stakeholders can change over time.\n\nOL OL Short Q9, 10 OL Long Q4,5,8,9,10\n\nHL OL Short Q3, 9 OL Long Q1, 6, 7\n\n14\n\nExample: Ben and Jerry started off simply as consumers of ice cream, then became entrepreneurs and managers of their own ice cream business. As the business grew and new products were developed, they had to become employers of staff. To reward and motivate these staff, shares could be sold to their employees. This would make the employees also investors in the business. Changing relationships: Sometimes rival firms may switch from a competitive approach to a co-operative approach with each other. Example: Normally Gary Lavin’s Vitz Drinks would have a competitive relationship with rivals. However, it could also adopt a co-operative relationship with rivals to encourage more people to choose Irish soft drinks brands instead of imported brands. This would benefit all the firms producing soft drinks in Ireland.\n\nChapter 1 Introduction to People in Business\n\nExamples of Competitive and Co-operative Approaches to Business Relationships\n\nCompetitive Approach Occurs when a business seeks to take advantage of other people in business.\n\nCo-operative (Partnership) Approach Occurs where a business seeks to work with other people in business so that both sides gain.\n\nEmployees: Treated by the business as an expense that must be tolerated rather than as partners in success. Wages are kept as low as possible and employee input into decisionmaking is minimal.\n\nEmployees: Seen as partners in building a successful business and receive fair wages, good working conditions and possibly a share in the profits or ownership.\n\nInvestors: May be provided with exaggerated or misleading financial information to persuade them to invest.\n\nInvestors: Provided with honest and complete financial information that will help to build trust.\n\nCustomers: Viewed as wallets to be emptied rather than clients with genuine needs. Lowquality goods may be sold while advertising may be misleading or deceptive.\n\nCustomers: Relationship is based on reliability, quality and value. Close attention is paid to market research and maintaining high standards. This helps to build long-term customer loyalty, sales and profits.\n\nSuppliers: Viewed as adversaries from whom the toughest possible terms should be squeezed.\n\nSuppliers: Receive fair prices and conditions in order to build a reliable long-term business relationship.\n\nGovernment: Taxes may be evaded or laws not fully complied with.\n\nGovernment: Complying with all laws and ensuring that taxes are paid as required.\n\nSociety: Needs or demands of local community or wider society may be ignored to cut costs, e.g. not installing adequate pollution controls or ignoring the concerns of local residents.\n\nSociety: The support and goodwill of the local community and wider society are regarded as crucial to the long-term success of the business.\n\nCompetitors: A competitive approach works best when dealing with competitors because it encourages firms to be innovative and constantly try to improve their goods and services for customers.\n\nCompetitors: Rival firms may co-operate where it is in their interests to work together, such as lobbying the government to change a law.\n\n6. How can conflict in business be resolved? Conflict occurs when the interests of different people in business are in disagreement. This results in one party wanting to achieve something (e.g. increase in wages) which is in conflict with what another party wants (e.g. reduce costs). If conflict does arise, those involved may attempt to ignore it in the hope that it will go away. Alternatively, they may try to ‘bully a solution’ by using their power and influence to force their own way. However such responses are unsuitable as the disagreements that gave rise to the conflict will remain and resentment and conflict are likely to surface again in the future. Ongoing conflict with different stakeholders can damage the reputation of a business.\n\n15\n\nBusiness Express Unit One\n\nResolving conflict A business can best avoid conflict by respecting stakeholders and adopting a cooperative approach to business relationships. However, when conflict does occur between people in business, two basic strategies can be followed – non-legislative and legislative. Non-legislative ways to resolve conflict\n\n Talk and see if a solution can be reached. If not, then some negotiations may be required. Negotiating means getting all sides in a dispute or conflict to explain their position, understand their differences and then bargain to arrive at a resolution that is acceptable to both sides. If negotiations are not working, it may be necessary to involve a third party.  Seek help from a third party. Third parties are people not directly involved but who can help to resolve a conflict. For example, the Society of the Irish Motor Industry (SIMI) is an industry trade association that can help to resolve a dispute between a consumer and a garage. Third parties may also be willing to provide arbitration. Arbitration means getting a third party to listen to all sides and then to recommend a solution.\n\nLegislative ways to resolve conflict\n\n Use a State conflict resolution agency. The government has set up different State agencies to enforce the law and to help resolve conflicts that can arise between stakeholders. For conflicts between consumers and businesses: • Competition and Consumer Protection Commission • Courts Service has a Small Claims Procedure For conflicts between employers and employees • Workplace Relations Commission • Labour Court\n\nHL\n\n16\n\n Use the law. There are laws to assist in resolving conflict between different stakeholders in business. For conflicts between consumers and businesses: • Consumer Protection Act 2007 (See Chapter 2) • Sales of Goods and Supply of Services Act 1980 (See Chapter 2) For conflicts between employers and employees, • Industrial Relations Act 1990 (See Chapter 3) • Employment Equality Act 1998 (See Chapter 3) • Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977 to 2007 (See Chapter 3)\n\nChapter 1 Introduction to People in Business\n\nKey Concepts & Business Terms: After studying this chapter the student should be able to explain the following key concepts and business terms 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15. 16. 17. 18. 19.\n\nBusiness Commercial business Profits Non-commercial businesses/ social enterprises/not-forprofit businesses Private sector business Public sector business Stakeholders Entrepreneurs Investors Employers Employees Managers Suppliers Producers Customers Consumers Society Interest groups/pressure groups Business interest groups\n\n20. 21. 22. 23. 24. 25. 26. 27. 28. 29. 30. 31. 32. 33. 34. 35.\n\nLobbying IBEC Small Firms Association (SFA) ISME Chambers of commerce Trade associations Trade unions ICTU Competitive business relationships Co-operative business relationships Changing stakeholder roles over time Changing stakeholder relationships over time Conflict Non-legislative ways to resolve conflict Negotiation Legislative ways to resolve conflict\n\nUseful Websites www.vitzdrinks.com www.isme.ie www.chambers.ie www.simi.ie\n\nwww.ibec.ie www.sfa.ie www.benjerry.com\n\n17\n\nBusiness Express Unit One\n\nLeaving Certificate Practice Questions OL\n\nOrdinary Level\n\nOrdinary Level – Section 1 – Short Questions (10 marks each)\n\n1.\n\nDistinguish between a commercial and a non-commercial business.\n\n3.\n\nList five main parties involved in business.\n\n2. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9.\n\nExplain the term ‘business stakeholder’.\n\nDescribe the role of the entrepreneur in business.\n\nExplain the term ‘investor’ and give two examples of different types of investors.

After studying business at university, she decided to set up her own business manufacturing sports equipment. She financed the start-up using savings, a grant from her Local Enterprise Office and money from a group of shareholders who agreed to invest in the business in return for a 40% share of the ownership.\n\nOver the years, the business has grown and become a very profitable producer of a wide range of sports goods and equipment. It employs dozens of staff in the local community and pays tax on its profits to the government. However, for her staff, Danielle is a tough manager to work for. Pay at Gold Medal Sports is poor and working hours are long. The business regularly has to recruit new staff to replace staff who leave for better work elsewhere.\n\nDanielle is a tough negotiator and always looks for the best bargains from her suppliers. However, she has had problems with the quality of the raw materials coming from some of her suppliers. The equipment in her factory is also now out of date and prone to breaking down. This is affecting the quality standards of the goods produced and customers are not happy. Gold Medal Sports is now under increasing pressure from rival sports goods manufacturers in China and the Far East who can supply better quality goods at very competitive prices.\n\nTo respond to this threat, Gold Medal Sports needs modern, state-of-the-art production machinery. This will require a major investment of finance. Danielle has decided that for the next few years, all profits will be retained in the business to pay for modernisation of the factory. This means that there will be no dividends paid to the shareholders who invested in the business until the profitability of the business improves. 1. Describe how the different stakeholders can affect the future survival and success of Gold Medal Sports. Refer to the text in your answer. (20 marks) 2.

She says that she is happy to settle for ‘something that is reliable, cheap to insure, good to drive and still looks well’. She is planning to visit a number of local car dealers to see what’s available within her budget. Top of her list of car dealers that she wants to visit are Classy Cars and Delux Motors. When Eimear sees a car that she likes, purchasing it will involve entering into a legal contract with the car dealer. To ensure that she gets a fair deal, Eimear will need to be aware of her legal rights as a consumer and the legal responsibilities of the car retailers.\n\n1. What are the elements of a legally binding contract? Most of the deals and agreements between the different stakeholders in business are contracts. A contract is a legally binding agreement that can be enforced in a court of law. This means that if a person breaks the agreement, the judge can order him/her to complete the contract or else pay compensation. The law of contract sets out the rules for proving when a contract exists and when it is finished (terminated). The law of contract is important because it governs most of the relationships between stakeholders in business. 21\n\nBusiness Express Unit One\n\n3. Consideration\n\n1. Offer\n\n4. 5. 6. 7. 8.\n\nA legal offer can be made verbally, in writing or by conduct.\n\n2. Acceptance\n\nIntention to contract Consent to contract Capacity to contract Legality of form Legality of purpose\n\nFig. 1 The elements of a legally valid contract.\n\n1. Offer Every contract must contain an offer to make a contract. This can be done in one of three ways: 1. Verbally, for example, ‘I’ll give you €10,000 for that car.’ 2. In writing or by post. 3. By conduct, such as a customer handing over a magazine and money to a shop assistant at a checkout. Example: Eimear visited the Classy Cars showrooms and saw a number of cars that she liked. After taking three of them for test drives, she decided that she wanted to buy the white Toyota and made an offer. The car is for sale for €25,000 and Eimear verbally tells the dealer that she is willing to pay €25,000.\n\n{\n\n}\n\nAn offer is terminated if it is: 1. Revoked, that is, withdrawn before the other party has accepted it. 2. Not accepted in time where there is a time limit set by the offeror. For instance, CAO offers of college places only apply for a limited period of time and are terminated if not accepted when that time expires. 3. Rejected by the other party.\n\nImportant Note\n\nAn offer must not be confused with an invitation to treat. An invitation to treat refers to an invitation to a customer to make an offer which can then be accepted or rejected. Goods on display in a shop are regarded as an invitation to treat.\n\nExample: Suppose a car in a garage is mistakenly priced at €199 instead of the correct price of €19,999. If Eimear sees the car and insists on buying it at the display price then, legally, she is wasting her time. The garage is within its legal rights to refuse to accept an offer from a customer to buy goods displayed at the wrong price.\n\n22\n\nChapter 2 Resolving Conflict in the Marketplace\n\n2. Acceptance Acceptance means that the other person agrees to all the terms of the original offer without any conditions. Acceptance of an offer can be communicated in three ways: 1. Verbally 2. In writing 3. By conduct (e.g. a shop assistant taking the customer’s money in exchange for a magazine).\n\nExample: Eimear has made an offer of €25,000 for the car that she liked. It is on special offer as it is the last one left in stock. The salesman at Classy Cars says that he will get back to Eimear with an answer because, he says, another customer is also interested in buying that particular car. The next day the salesman from the garage phones to say that Eimear can have the car for €30,000. Eimear says no, the maximum she is willing to pay for the car is €25,000. She is annoyed at how she is being treated and tells the garage that she is no longer interested and is withdrawing her offer. The garage then say that they will accept her original offer of €25,000 and demand payment. Does Eimear have to pay? The answer is no. Eimear did make an offer but it was not accepted. The garage then made a counter offer of €30,000 which she rejected so there was no longer any offer for the garage to accept.\n\nHL HL Short Q1 HL Long Q1\n\nAll offers to enter a contract which have been accepted must be honoured.\n\n3. Consideration Each party to a contract must give something of value to the other party. Consideration is what each party promises to give or do for the other and provides evidence that they have an agreement.\n\nConsideration provides evidence of a contract.\n\nExample: Unhappy with her treatment by Classy Cars, Eimear went to Delux Motors instead. There she saw a silver Volkswagen that she liked. After a test drive, she made an offer to buy if the garage could supply the car in red. The garage verbally accepted Eimear‘s offer and asked for a deposit of €1000, as they would have to order the car from Germany. Eimear paid the deposit and in return Delux Motors provided a receipt and order confirmation. This exchange by each party provides the consideration for this contract.\n\n4. Intention to contract Intention to contract means that the parties to the contract must have intended to create a legally binding contract that could end up in court if not fulfilled. Contract law makes two important assumptions: 1. All business agreements, whether written or verbal, are intended to be legally binding. 2. All social and private agreements are not intended to be legally binding. This means, for instance, that you cannot sue a friend because they did not keep their promise to lend you their car for a holiday trip.\n\nFor a contract to be legally enforceable, there must be an intention to contract.\n\nExample: The agreement between Delux Motors and Eimear is a business agreement and therefore assumed to be legally binding.\n\n23\n\nBusiness Express Unit One\n\n5. Consent to contract Consent to enter a contract must be genuinely and freely given.\n\nConsent to contract means that each party must give genuine agreement of their own free will to the making of the contract. Consent to enter a legally binding contract may not exist: 1. If a person is pressurised against their will into entering a contract. This can occur if physical or mental pressure or intimidation was used to force an agreement without genuine free choice or consent. 2. If a person enters a contract as a result of deliberate misrepresentation or dishonesty by others.\n\n3.\n\nParties must have the legal capacity to enter into a contract.\n\nExample: If, after purchasing a car, Eimear discovers that the car was not new and that the mileometer has been illegally changed, then this would be a deliberate misrepresentation. According to the law, Eimear would be entitled to cancel the contract and get her money back. If a genuine mistake can be shown to have happened.\n\n6. Capacity to contract Capacity means that the people agreeing to the contract must have the legal right to do so. People who do not have the legal right to enter into a contract are: 1. Anyone under 18, except for items considered normal purchases for such a person, such as clothes, music or food. 2. People who are intoxicated, insane or ‘of unsound mind’ at the time. 3. A company cannot enter into contracts which are outside its legally stated purpose as set out in its Memorandum of Association. For example, a company set up to sell cars cannot open a hotel as it would not have the legal authority to do so. If it did, it would be acting ultra vires. Example: Eimear is over 18 and is not insane so she has the legal capacity to enter into a contract. If she was 16 when she bought the car then the contract would be invalid.\n\n7. Legality of form Legality of form means that certain contracts must be drawn up in writing before they can become legally binding. These include hire purchase agreements, property sales and insurance policies. Other than these, most other contracts can be verbal or implied by conduct (e.g. handing over money). Example: If Eimear were buying the car on hire purchase, she would have to get a written contract. If she was paying cash, no written contract would be necessary to prove that a contract exists. • Contracts must be in a legally valid form. • Contracts must be for a legal purpose.\n\n8. Legality of purpose Legality of purpose means that for a contract to be legally binding, it must be for a legal purpose and not involve committing any crime or breaking any law.\n\nOL 24\n\nOL Short Q1, 2, 3 OL Long Q1\n\nHL\n\nHL Short Q2 HL Long Q2\n\nChapter 2 Resolving Conflict in the Marketplace\n\n2. How can a contract be terminated? Termination of a contract means it can no longer be legally enforced. Contracts can be legally terminated by: 1. Performance – where the parties involved fulfil all their obligations as agreed. Example: Once the car is delivered and the guarantee period expires, the contract between Eimear and Delux Motors is over. 2. Agreement – all the parties to a contract can agree to terminate a contract, whether or not the purpose of the contract has been achieved.\n\nContracts can be terminated by 1. Performance 2. Agreement 3. Frustration 4. Breach of contract\n\nExample: If Delux Motors had difficulty getting delivery of the car from the manufacturers in Germany, then both Eimear and the garage could agree to cancel the contract. 3. Frustration – where some unforeseen event(s) prevents the contract being completed. This could be due to a fire, an extreme weather event or the death or bankruptcy of any of the parties to the contract. Example: If a major fire in the Volkswagen factory means that production of cars is suspended indefinitely. 4. Breach of contract – where one of the parties breaks a condition of the contract. A condition is an essential element of a contract. Example: A condition of the contract between Eimear and Delux Motors is that the car to be delivered is in red. If the car that is delivered turns out to be pink or orange, then this would break an essential condition of the contract and Eimear could cancel the contract.\n\n• A condition is an essential element. • A warranty is nonessential.\n\nOL\n\nA warranty is a non-essential element of a contract. If a warranty is broken you are entitled to compensation, although the contract is still valid.\n\nOL Short Q4, 12\n\nExample: Suppose the car delivered to Eimear has a different brand of tyre to what is described in the sales brochure. This would only be a breach of warranty, as it does not interfere with the ownership or proper use of the car. The contract to purchase still stands but the garage should correct the breach of warranty before Eimear takes legal possession.\n\nHL\n\n3. What are the remedies for breach of contract? When a condition of a contract is broken, you can: 1. Rescind (cancel) the contract. If a condition of a contract is broken, the injured party can refuse to honour it. Example: A pink saloon car is delivered instead of a red coupé. 2. Sue for financial compensation for the losses incurred. This can be done by hiring a solicitor and taking the other party to court. If a warranty is broken, the contract can still be fulfilled but often at greater expense and inconvenience. Compensation can be sought for breaches of warranty but the contract cannot be cancelled. 3. Seek ‘specific performance’, which means getting the court to order the other party to keep their side of the agreement.\n\nHL Short Q3 HL Long Q3\n\nRemedies for breach of contract are: 1. Cancellation 2. Compensation 3. Specific performance\n\nOL OL Long Q2\n\nHL HL Long Q4\n\n25\n\nBusiness Express Unit One\n\nCase Study: Pixar cancels contract with Disney Pixar, the animation business responsible for producing Hollywood blockbusters such as Toy Story, Wall-E and Up, signed a contract with Disney Corporation. According to the contract, Pixar would make the movies while Disney would provide all the advertising, spin-off product merchandising and marketing promotions in exchange for a percentage share of the profits. However, after a few years, Pixar became unhappy with the high profits that they had agreed in the contract to share with Disney. Pixar decided that it wanted to change this condition of the contract so that Disney would get a smaller percentage of the profits. Not surprisingly, Disney was unwilling to change the contract, as it would mean giving up hundreds of millions of dollars in lost profits. Despite repeated efforts, Pixar could not persuade Disney to agree to a change in the contract. Pixar decided that it had had enough. Under a legally binding condition of the contract, Pixar was obliged to make only a certain number of movies with Disney. Once the final movie was completed, the existing contract was fully performed and was legally terminated. After that, Pixar was free to undertake its own marketing and distribution and retain 100% right to all profits from its own movies.\n\nRecall and Review\n\n1. What are the elements of a legally binding business contract? 2. How can a company like Pixar terminate a contract?\n\n26\n\nChapter 2 Resolving Conflict in the Marketplace\n\n4. What legislation protects consumer rights? Caveat emptor is a legal term meaning ‘Let the buyer beware’. Whenever a consumer buys a good or service they are expected to use a reasonable degree of common sense. If you subsequently have a complaint and want to take legal action, your case will fail if you have not followed this basic principle of consumer law. Even if consumers have obeyed the ‘caveat emptor’ rule, there are many causes of conflict that can arise between a business and its consumers. These include the use of misleading advertising and selling poor quality goods and services. Consumers’ legal rights and sellers’ responsibilities are set out in two important pieces of legislation: 1. The Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act 1980. 2. The Consumer Protection Act 2007.\n\n5. What is the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act 1980? The Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act 1980 sets out:\n\n The legal rights of consumers when they purchase goods  The legal responsibilities of retailers to consumers  The legal remedies available\n\nThe Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act 1980 sets out the law concerning the sale of goods and services.\n\nThis law applies to every consumer purchase of new goods from a legally registered business. It also applies to goods bought on hire purchase. The law does not apply to second-hand goods (except cars) or if you buy something from a friend or a private individual.\n\n1. Goods sold must be of merchantable quality. Merchantable quality means that goods sold to consumers must be reasonably durable to do what they are supposed to do, even if they are sale items. Example: A new car must not break down after travelling just five kilometres, cornflakes should be fresh and edible, or buttons must not fall off a shirt within days of purchasing it. 2. Goods sold must be fit for the purpose intended. This means that the goods must do what they are sold as being capable of doing. Example: If a customer asks for a car with heated seats, then the seats must be heated. Similarly, if a consumer wants a waterproof jacket, then the jacket sold must be waterproof. 3. Goods sold must be as described by the salesperson/brochure/sample. There should be no misleading descriptions, packaging or samples provided. Example: A car described as red in a brochure or sales agreement must not turn out to be pink when delivered to the customer. 4. The buyer is entitled to legal ownership and quiet possession. This means that the seller of the goods has the sole legal right to sell the goods. As a 27\n\nBusiness Express Unit One\n\nresult, the buyer should enjoy quiet possession by being able to use the goods as they wish. 5. Services must be provided by a competent person with skill and using due care and diligence. Any materials used must be sound and fit for the purpose and be of merchantable quality. Example: A mechanic servicing a car should be properly trained and use proper tools and the correct spare parts. 6. Consumers renting or buying on hire purchase have the same rights as someone buying goods paying upfront with cash.\n\n1. Retailers are legally responsible for any defects in any product they sell, even if it is the manufacturer’s fault. 2. Retailers must respect all the legal rights of customers (listed above). 3. Complaints must be dealt with by the seller even if they relate to a fault caused by the manufacturer. 4. Signs pretending to limit the retailer’s liability are illegal. These include ‘The shop does not accept responsibility for any faulty goods sold’; ‘No money refunds’; ‘Credit Notes Only’; ‘Goods not Exchanged’. However, the consumer has no right to redress if: • The consumer is responsible for any fault. • The consumer has simply changed their mind and wants to return the goods. • The consumer failed to act reasonably promptly after buying the goods. 5. Any product guarantees offered are an additional benefit. They cannot restrict consumer rights as set out in law. Written guarantees must be clear and specific regarding: • the goods covered • who is offering the guarantee • the duration of the guarantee • the procedure for making a claim • what remedy is offered. 6. It is illegal for retailers to demand payment for unsolicited goods sent to consumers.\n\nOL OL Short Q8, 9, 10 OL Long Q3\n\nHL HL Short Q5 HL Long Q6\n\n28\n\nIf the consumer has proof of purchase (such as a receipt) the remedies available depend on how serious the fault is. 1. Repair of the good if the fault is very minor (e.g. a small scratch on car paintwork). If the retailer offers a repair, the consumer can agree to the repair and still retain the right to a full refund if the repair is not satisfactory. 2. Replacement of the good if the fault is more serious. 3. Refund of money. If the goods are not as described, not fit for the purpose intended or not of merchantable quality, then the consumer is entitled to a full refund from the seller, not just a replacement or a repair.\n\nChapter 2 Resolving Conflict in the Marketplace\n\n6. What is the Consumer Protection Act 2007? The Consumer Protection Act 2007 is the law that protects consumers from unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices. The Act bans practices that are unfair, misleading or aggressive towards consumers and are likely to impair a consumer’s choice. The Act does not apply to dealings between businesses. Specifically the Act:\n\n Prohibits false product descriptions. Goods must not be sold with a false trade description. This applies to advertisements, shop notices or any claims made by a sales person, either written or verbal.\n\nThe Consumer Protection Act 2007 sets out the law concerning the false or misleading promotion of goods for sale.\n\nExamples: (a) Second-hand cars being sold as new. (b) Cornflakes advertised as being the cheapest in town, when they are not. (c) A coat labelled ‘waterproof’ but which lets in the rain. (d) A dry-cleaning business that offers ‘same day service’ but in reality regularly takes three days. (e) Making false claims that a product can cure an illness.\n\n Prohibits false prices: It is illegal to give false or misleading information regarding the past, present or future price of a product. Goods marked as being reduced in price in a sale must have been on sale at the original higher price for at least 28 consecutive days before the sale.  Prohibits false or misleading advertising.\n\nExamples: (a) Advertising a jumper as being 100% wool when it is really made of acrylic. (b) Offering ‘free prizes’ when it costs money to claim the prizes. (c) Running competitions when the top prize is not available.\n\n Prohibits businesses from engaging in aggressive practices such as harassing, coercing, taking advantage of, or putting unfair pressure on a consumer. Examples: (a) Demanding payment for unsolicited goods. (b) Running ‘pyramid schemes’ where a person pays money but, instead of a product or service, their only benefit arises from persuading other people to join the scheme after them.\n\nCompetition and Consumer Protection Commission\n\nThe Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) is the state agency responsible for promoting fair competition and protecting the interests of consumers. The CCPC: • Provides information and advice to the public on personal finance and their rights as consumers.

The fridge was delivered but after a few days he noticed that the temperature control was not working correctly. Food was beginning to smell, go mouldy and had to be thrown out. Naturally, he was annoyed, but wondered what he should do, and whether he had any legal rights to back him up. Alan contacted ElectroWorld and explained his complaint about his fridge to the manager. She apologised but said that unfortunately it was nothing to do with the shop. The manager claimed it was the manufacturer’s fault and that Alan should contact them. She kindly gave him the manufacturer’s telephone number and address in South Korea so that he could contact them. While in ElectroWorld, Alan saw that they advertised their products as being the ‘cheapest in town or your money back’. However, he now knew that the fridge that he bought could be purchased for €100 less in a shop across the street. When he pointed this out to the manager, she just laughed and said: ‘It’s just a bit of harmless advertising hype – people are not expected to take our ads seriously!’ Alan was really annoyed about this and wondered whether the store was breaking the law by making such misleading claims.\n\nRecall and Review 1.

Consumers who find themselves in conflict with a business over the way they have been treated have two non-legislative ways of resolving the issue: 1. Talk to the retailer 2. Seek help from a third party\n\nIt is better to try to settle a business conflict without having to use the law. This can be done by talking to the other party or by seeking help.\n\nTalk to the retailer as soon as possible when the difficulty arises. The best way of doing this is to:\n\n Know your legal rights as set out in law.  Bring along a receipt as proof of purchase.  Ask to speak to the manager and complain in a friendly but firm manner, insisting that your legal rights as a consumer be respected. (It is important to remember that an aggressive negotiation style can make matters worse.)  If talking to the retailer does not work, write a formal letter of complaint to the retailer.\n\nIf discussing the situation with the retailer does not work, then consumers can ask a third party to assist. Organisations that can assist in resolving a consumer conflict are:    \n\nCompetition and Consumer Protection Commission. Industry trade associations (e.g. Society for the Irish Motor Industry). Consumers’ Association of Ireland. Financial Services Ombudsman for complaints concerning financial institutions.\n\n Office of the Ombudsman for the Public Service.\n\nConsumers’ Association of Ireland\n\nThe Consumers’ Association of Ireland is a non-commercial organisation set up to protect and promote the interests of consumers. Members of the public must pay an annual membership fee to join and in return they receive a consumer magazine, Consumer Choice, and advice on consumer rights. The association’s main activities are: • Publishing reports and surveys into consumer products and services. • Highlighting problem areas where the interests of consumers are being neglected and seeking improved product quality standards. • Running a consumer advice service to help members with consumer problems and complaints. For a small fee the association’s solicitor will provide speedy professional legal advice on consumer issues. • Lobbying the government for changes and improvements to consumer rights legislation. 31\n\nBusiness Express Unit One\n\nFinancial Services Ombudsman\n\nThe Financial Services Ombudsman specialises in resolving consumer complaints against banks and other financial institutions such as insurance companies and credit unions. The decision of the ombudsman is binding on the institutions involved. However, if consumers are still dissatisfied they can seek legislative solutions through the courts.\n\nThe Office of the Ombudsman (for Public Services)\n\nOL OL Long Q4, 7\n\nHL HL Short Q8 HL Long Q9\n\nThe Office of the Ombudsman (for Public Services) specialises in dealing with consumer complaints against State-owned organisations, including all Government departments, the Health Service Executive (HSE) and local authorities. Although financed by the State, the Office of the Ombudsman is independent of the government. When investigating a complaint, the Office of the Ombudsman has no power to force its recommendation to be accepted. Nevertheless, most public bodies comply to avoid bad publicity and damage to their reputation. Procedure: Before contacting the Office of the Ombudsman, you must first contact the public body involved and make an effort to solve the problem yourself. If this proves unsatisfactory, you can then go to the ombudsman but this must be done within 12 months of the event you are complaining about.\n\n8. How can consumer complaints be resolved in a legislative manner? The Small Claims Procedure is a fast, easy and inexpensive way to use the law to resolve consumer complaints.\n\nIf the non-legislative approach of talking and negotiating does not produce a satisfactory result, then a consumer can resort to taking a legislative approach. This can be done by using a State conflict resolution agency (such as the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission or the Small Claims Procedure available from the courts) or hiring a solicitor to take the retailer to court for breaking the law.\n\nThe Small Claims Procedure provided by the Courts Service is an inexpensive, fast and easy way for consumers to resolve disputes without the need to employ a solicitor. A consumer with a complaint must first fill in a simple form describing their complaint. This can be done by post or on-line. The court will then invite both parties to come in and present their side of the case before making a recommendation. Unlike going to a full court hearing, the Small Claims Procedure cannot force an agreement but is very effective at persuading sellers to respect consumers’ rights.\n\n32\n\nChapter 2 Resolving Conflict in the Marketplace\n\nFieldwork\n\nFieldwork The Courts Service Small Claims Procedure will only hear complaints up to a certain value. What is the current maximum value of disputes that the procedure can hear? The answer is available from www.courts.ie or www.smallclaims.ie\n\nIf no agreement is reached using the Small Claims Procedure, then the consumer can contact a solicitor to bring a formal case to the District Court or higher court, depending on the sums of money involved. There will be a full hearing before a judge who will issue a legally binding settlement. All disputes that are too large for the Small Claims Procedure should be brought to a solicitor.\n\n✓ ✗\n\nAdvantages of using the Courts Service Small Claims Procedure 1. Faster than going to the District Court. 2. Low cost, as only a small fee and no solicitors involved. 3. Accessible as complaints can be made online or by post by filling in an application form. 4. Unbiased and fair judgement provided by the Court. Disadvantages of using the Courts Service Small Claims Procedure 1. Only deals with complaints up to a limited value. 2. Recommendation is not legally binding. 3. If you are not happy with the outcome, you will have to go for a full court hearing\n\nOL OL Short Q11 OL Long Q6\n\nHL HL Short Q9 HL ABQs HL Long Q8, 10, 11\n\nin the District Court.\n\nCase Study: Diabolical Diablo Eimear’s difficulties with Classy Motors were small compared to the problems that an American customer claimed he encountered when he spent €300,000 on a prestigious Lamborghini Diablo. He complained that the roof leaked, the doors regularly got stuck, the battery failed, the horn did not function properly, dashboard lights flickered on and off, the engine stalled and the hydraulic system collapsed. Dissatisfied, the customer took the manufacturers, Lamborghini, to court. He claimed that there was a clear breach of consumer law as he had to take the car back to the garage ten times for repairs. Lamborghini denied the claim. ‘It’s very embarrassing,’ said the customer. ‘You want to get a Lamborghini to be the centre of attention.

The business employs very ﬂexible, customer-focused staff and has been putting a big effort into building up a good reputation for its quality products. Despite being slightly more expensive than its competitors, Gourmet Foods business has been growing. This has mainly been by selling its products through small shops and delicatessens. Recently the business had a sales breakthrough when a major supermarket chain, Foodland, conﬁrmed by letter that it had decided to place an initial order for €50,000 worth of microwavable dinners. Foodland also paid €1000 deposit for the order. This order was important for Gourmet Foods and Kevin hopes that it will lead to lots of repeat orders and also open up opportunities to distribute the ﬁrm’s products through other major supermarket chains. Kevin and his staff ordered extra raw materials and got started on making the products for Foodland. However, one month later Foodland contacted him and informed him that due to a change of company policy, the supermarket no longer wanted to stock Gourmet Foods meals. The supermarket had decided that it wanted to keep costs down by only stocking well-known, low-price international brands. Foodland also asked that the €1000 deposit they handed over with the original order be returned to them.\n\n36\n\nChapter 2 Resolving Conflict in the Marketplace\n\nKevin was devastated by this development.

It had been marked down by 50% to a ‘Special Offer’ price of €800 and came with a one-year guarantee. At the time, Samantha had happily signed the sales agreement and guarantee without reading the small print carefully. When she got home Samantha began unpacking her new possession but when she removed the sale sticker she found the original price sticker that read €999. She became even more annoyed when she discovered that when the machine was turned on, it would not connect to the Internet. The computer also began crashing every 30 minutes and was effectively unusable. Exasperated, Samantha contacted the retailer and explained the problem. Because she had a guarantee, she believed that she would be able to get a replacement. However, Global Electrics told her that it was the manufacturer’s responsibility and that the guarantee stated this. The manufacturer of the computer was a Japanese company based in Tokyo. According to the manager, the shop’s policy was not to refund, replace or renew faulty goods. Instead he gave her a telephone number and recommended that she call Tokyo. 1.

Like most supermarkets, it sells thousands of different types of grocery products. The business currently employs over 400 full- and part-time staff in jobs such as checkout assistants, shelf stackers, warehouse staff, delivery drivers, stock control, security guards, accountants and managers. Many of the staff are members of a trade union. The business employs a full-time human resources manager who is responsible for looking after industrial relations between the company and its employees. In recent years, more low-price competitors have entered the market and competition among food retailers has become intense. To compete, Mega Deal has had to lower its prices and cut costs. However, this has also meant reduced profitability for the business and the business is under huge financial pressure to survive.\n\nA. Industrial relations and trade unions\n\n1. What are industrial relations? Mega Deal Supermarkets, like all firms, wants to maintain good industrial relations. Industrial relations refer to the quality of the relations that exist between the managers and the employees in an 39\n\nBusiness Express Unit One\n\norganisation. A business where managers and employees have a positive partnership approach and get on well with one another is said to have good industrial relations. Industrial relations refer to the quality of the relationship between the managers and employees in an organisation.\n\nHL HL Short Q1\n\nBenefits of good industrial relations include:    \n\nIt is easier to recruit and retain high-quality staff. Low levels of absenteeism and labour turnover (staff resignations). Happy staff are more productive. Fewer industrial disputes or strikes disrupting the business.\n\n2. What are the causes of conflict in the workplace? Over the years, there have been a number of industrial disputes in Mega Deal Supermarkets. An industrial dispute is a legal term referring to any conflict between workers and employers. Industrial disputes can be caused by:  Conflict over pay and pensions.  Conflict over working hours, holidays, health and safety or other working conditions.  Conflict over the introduction of new technology or work practices that may threaten workers’ jobs.\n\n Conflict over redundancies or dismissals.  Conflict over discrimination of staff.\n\nIndustrial relations conflict can be made worse by\n\nOL OL LShort Q1 OL Long Q\n\n   \n\nPoor communications between employers and employees. Unrealistic employees who ignore the financial pressures on a business. Excessively demanding employers who put staff under too much pressure. Aggressive interpersonal behaviour between employers and employees. For instance, autocratic managers who do not listen to their staff or who engage in bullying behaviour.\n\n Lack of trust between employers and employees. This could arise, for instance, because past agreements were broken.\n\n3.How can good industrial relations be promoted? Good industrial relations in a business are promoted by:\n\n Paying good wages and providing good conditions of employment.  Having open communication between employees and employers.  Keeping promises and building up trust and respect between employers and employees.\n\nHL HL Short Q2\n\n40\n\n Treating staff fairly, without discrimination.  Having a clear grievance procedure in place for dealing quickly and fairly with any conflicts that may arise between staff and management. Grievance procedures refer to the rules agreed between employers and staff when raising workplace issues. Effective grievance procedures should provide a simple, fair and quick method for resolving conflicts between employees and management.  Ensuring any dismissals are fair.\n\nChapter 3 Resolving Conflict in the Workplace\n\n4. What are trade unions? Many of the staff in Mega Deal are members of a trade union. Trade unions are organisations that represent the views and interests of employees in matters concerning pay and conditions of employment e.g. SIPTU, ASTI. Employees pay an annual subscription to join a union. Typically, trade union members are organised into branches in their place of work. A shop steward is a spokesperson elected by employees in a workplace to act as their local union representative. Benefits of union membership to employees • • • • •\n\nEmployees join trade unions because it is easier to negotiate pay and conditions and solve industrial relations problems together rather than individually.\n\nSeek to protect employees rights Look for better pay and conditions Negotiate on behalf of employees with employers using skilled negotiators Provide advice to trade union members on industrial relations and employment issues Provide a national voice for workers through the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU)\n\nBenefits of union membership to employers •\n\nSimplifies communications between management and employees on employment related issues. This saves employers time and money.\n\nICTU The Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU) is the body that speaks and acts for all unions in the Republic of Ireland. This gives the ICTU a lot of influence with employers and the government. The ICTU:  Acts as a negotiator on behalf of all unions in dealings with the government, the EU and national employer organisations such as IBEC.  Promotes the benefits of union membership among the general public.  Resolves disputes and disagreements between different unions.  Provides training, education and research services for unions and their members.\n\nB. Conflict over pay and working conditions\n\nOL OL Short Q2 OL Long Q2\n\nMichelle O’Neill\n\nCase Study Mega Deal has had a turbulent industrial relations record, with many industrial disputes between management and workers in the company over the years. When Michelle O’Neill was recruited she was aware of this and decided to join a union. Union members in the supermarket are looking to negotiate a 5% cost-of-living pay rise and have asked their union to start negotiations with the Mega Deal management.\n\n41\n\nBusiness Express Unit One\n\n5. How are employee pay and conditions negotiated? Pay disputes are a very common cause of conflict in the workplace, and there are different types of pay claims.  A cost-of-living claim arises where employees want their wages to keep up with inflation. Example: If inflation is 4%, workers may seek a 4% pay increase.\n\n A comparability claim arises where employees want similar pay and conditions to workers doing comparable work in a different company. Example: Shop assistants in Mega Deal may seek the same pay and conditions as shop assistants in Tesco or Lidl.\n\n A relativity claim occurs where one group of workers want to maintain higher pay than another group. Example: If the shelf stackers in Mega Deal get a pay rise, then the checkout operators may seek an increase to maintain the relative difference in pay.\n\n A productivity claim occurs where workers seek improved pay and conditions as a reward for increasing their output and efficiency. Pay and conditions in a firm can be negotiated by staff individually or collectively.\n\nLocal pay bargaining When employers or employees want to change the pay or other conditions of employment, a process of negotiation called local bargaining can be followed.\n\n Individual bargaining occurs when the employer negotiates individually with an employee. This can happen in a business where union membership is small.\n\n Collective bargaining occurs when the employer negotiates collectively with a group of employees, usually through a trade union representative.\n\nNational wage agreements\n\nOL OL Short Q3 OL Long Q3\n\nThe Industrial Relations Act 1990 sets out the law governing the conduct of strikes and industrial disputes.\n\n42\n\nIn Ireland national agreements covering pay and other issues are sometimes negotiated between the social partners. The main social partners comprise representatives of the government, employers (through IBEC), and employees (through ICTU). Social partnership refers to the process whereby the government, employers and employees agree pay and conditions nationally. The purpose of social partnership is to create a more stable and predictable economic environment for business, unions and government to plan and operate within.\n\n6. What is the Industrial Relations Act 1990? The Industrial Relation Act 1990 is the law that sets out the rules concerning industrial disputes and strikes. According to this law:  Disputes must be legitimate. Employees can only take industrial action in a dispute related to their job. This is called a legitimate trade dispute. Legitimate disputes and strikes can arise over matters such as pay, conditions, work duties, dismissals, union recognition or employment policies. However, it is illegal to go on strike over how a business is run (such as factory layout or product marketing) or to strike about political issues.\n\nChapter 3 Resolving Conflict in the Workplace\n\n Unions must hold a secret ballot of the members involved in the dispute and get majority approval for a strike. A secret ballot means that how a person votes remains confidential. Voting for a strike by using a show of hands would not be secret and is illegal. All union members entitled to vote must be given a reasonable opportunity to do so and must be fully informed of all ballot details.  Unions must give at least one week’s advance notice to the employer before going on strike.\n\n Official disputes are legitimate trade disputes that have received the approval of a majority of workers in a secret ballot, along with trade union and ICTU support.  Immunity: An employer cannot sue unions or employees for loss of earnings arising from an official dispute.\n\n Unofficial disputes have no union or ICTU approval. According to the Industrial Relations Act 1990, these disputes are illegal. Organisers of unofficial disputes do not have legal protection against being sued by an employer for compensation due to lost sales or profits arising from the strike. Workers on strike in an unofficial dispute may receive no support from their union. A wildcat strike is a type of unofficial dispute where no advance notice or warning is given to management. Wildcat strikes usually flare up suddenly over some issue, are very short and tend to be resolved quickly.\n\n Picketing involves employees and trade union officials walking up and down outside the workplace indicating a strike is in progress. According to the Industrial Relations Act 1990, primary picketing of the employer’s workplace is allowed as long as it is peaceful. Secondary picketing of another business not involved in the dispute is illegal unless the strikers legitimately believe that the second employer is assisting the first employer to frustrate the strike action.  Workplace Relations Commission is the State agency that provides industrial relations information and assistance in resolving disputes.\n\nOfficial disputes have union support. Unofficial disputes do not have union support.\n\nOL OL Short Q4, 5\n\nHL HL Short Q3 HL Long Q1\n\n7. What types of industrial action can a union undertake?

The union organised a secret ballot of its members who voted by a large majority in favour of strike action in support of their claim.\n\nEmployees can take different types of industrial action in a dispute with an employer.  Token stoppages involve workers stopping work for a short period of time to demonstrate their strength of feeling to the employer. Example: Supermarket shop assistants going on strike for two hours.\n\n A work-to-rule means employees only do their basic job and nothing more. This inflexibility can be very frustrating for the employer. As they are not yet on 43\n\nBusiness Express Unit One\n\nfull strike, the employees are still entitled to be paid by their employer.\n\n A go-slow occurs when employees carry out the minimum amount of work they can get away with without jeopardising their basic pay.\n\n Overtime bans occur where workers refuse to work extra hours. This can cause a lot of disruption to employers that have seasonal or irregular work, such as toy shops at Christmas or airlines during the summer.\n\n A strike occurs when members of a union in a workplace refuse to do any work. An employer will not pay employees who go on strike. An all-out strike means all union members in an organisation are ordered by the ICTU to stop working and leave the premises. When this happens it is a sign of the seriousness of the dispute. It is normally accompanied by picketing outside the employer’s premises.\n\n8. What are the consequences of strikes for stakeholders? Strikes and industrial disputes can have negative consequences for all stakeholders in a business.\n\n Business: Operations and production are disrupted, sales are lost and profits fall. Meanwhile, competitors can use it as an opportunity to gain market share. The reliability and reputation of a business will be undermined. Recruitment and retention of high-quality staff is made more difficult. Management time and energy is diverted into solving the dispute instead of concentrating on the main work of the business.  Employees: Staff lose wages while on strike and their savings get used up. Their job security may be undermined. If a strike is unsuccessful, they will lose confidence in the union.\n\n Customers: Goods and services are not available which will inconvenience customers. In the case of important goods and services such as electricity, bus services or oil supplies, a strike can undermine the ability of others to make a living.  Suppliers: Strikes can cause a loss of sales and undermine the profitability of suppliers.\n\n Investors: Loss of output, sales and profits will mean a reduction in dividends and undermine a firm’s ability to pay the interest on loans.  Economy: Strikes can mean a loss of wages spent and circulated in the economy. Substitute products may have to be imported, undermining Irish jobs.\n\n Government: Strikes mean a loss of tax revenues for the government, including income tax, VAT and corporation tax. Strikes can undermine Ireland’s international reputation as a business location and make IDA Ireland’s job of attracting foreign investment to the country more difficult.\n\n44\n\nChapter 3 Resolving Conflict in the Workplace\n\nCase Study: Dunnes strike hits stakeholders MegaDeal managers are keen to avoid a strike like that which occurred in Dunnes Stores a few years ago. That supermarket lost sales income of more than €5 million a day during an industrial dispute when over 5,000 of its workers went on strike, closing 62 of the firm’s outlets. Dunnes employees lost out on wages, customers were inconvenienced and the government lost VAT and PAYE tax revenues. As a result of the strike, Dunnes Stores also had problems paying suppliers because the accounts department in its Dublin headquarters was reduced to only four staff processing the accounts and payments instead of the usual 30. This caused widespread concern in the economy, as suppliers who are not paid on time can suffer serious cashflow problems and could be forced out of business.\n\n9. What organisations help to resolve industrial disputes? Case Study The union in Mega Deal have had meetings with managers to request a 5% pay rise for their members. However, management are only willing to consider a 2% rise because of the increased competition and financial pressure on Mega Deal. After three days of negotiations, both the union and management at Mega Deal felt that their negotiations over pay were going nowhere. It was agreed that it was time to consider going outside the organisation and seek the help of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) They used the WRC’s Conciliation Service which they found very helpful in understanding each other’s position. However, Mega Deal unions and management were still unable to reach a settlement. They agreed to enter arbitration whereby the WRC would recommend a solution.\n\nIf an employer and its employees cannot solve a dispute using their local grievance procedure, then they can take the issue to the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC). The decisions of the WRC may be appealed to the Labour Court. The Workplace Relations Commission is the State agency that provides employers and employees with a one-stop-shop industrial relations service. Specifically it:\n\n promotes good industrial relations practices,  promotes compliance with employment law and  provides practical help in resolving industrial disputes. See www.workpl"
