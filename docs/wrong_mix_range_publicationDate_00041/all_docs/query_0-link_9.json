Thanksgiving is Thursday and I’m really excited to be able to share this story with you because it’s something that I haven’t thought about in a long time but I’ve been thinking about gratitude a lot lately.\n\n.830]\n\nWelcome to Growth think tank. This is the one and only place where you will get insight from the founders and the CEOs. The fastest-growing privately held companies. I am the host. My name is Gene Hammett. I hope leaders and their teams navigate the defining moments of their growth. Are you ready to grow?\n\n.710]\n\nThanksgiving is Thursday and I’m really excited to be able to share this story with you because it’s something that I haven’t thought about in a long time but I’ve been thinking about gratitude a lot lately.\n\n.170]\n\nHere’s how the story goes. I went through coach training after I lost everything in my business and I really needed to rebuild my life and I wanted to focus on helping and serving others and the only special skills I had was a business mind and really helping companies grow because I’d grown my own company. So I got coach training. This was in 2010 and I remember coming back after the first four months of training and we all got back together and I remember having a conversation with the lead instructor Julio Elia I went to Newfield networks to get my certifications and I just said how grateful I was about what I was learning and how is developing inside the program. And he mentioned about the difference between being thankful and having gratitude. And so here’s what it is.\n\n.850]\n\nWhen you’re thankful it’s usually in response to something if someone holds the door open for you. Someone picks up a dollar bill that you left on the ground you say thank you. There are many other reasons why you might say thank you But gratitude is not the cause of an action or a trigger. It’s because of something you feel for someone just because of the way they’ve been to you. So there is a difference between being thankful and grateful.\n\n.350]\n\nNow speaking of gratitude because I think about this and I talk about it with my clients we talk about you know just a routine of our ritual of being grateful for what’s going on your life. It could be small things. It could be your home. It could be the car that you love to drive. It could be a fresh cup of coffee. It could be. Being able to play with your kids or just take time away get a massage. Or it could be something bigger like you know being a part of a community being part of your church or being in a philanthropy kind of experience.\n\n.490]\n\nI think there are so many things to be grateful for but we’d rarely take the time to think about it. Now maybe you do take the time to think about it every once in a while. So the next piece I want to add on top of this is you know you want to express the gratitude you know gratitude that you feel that don’t X express really isn’t the same like it does something for you but why not express your gratitude. So you really want to find others that you are feeling this gratitude toward and tell them how you feel and as a leader you want to do that with your employees as much as you can. You want to do it with your direct reports you want to do it the people who are just in working for you you want to take time to express that gratitude. This is the season of Thanksgiving but it doesn’t have to end and Thanksgiving.\n\n.560]\n\nIt can go on and on and it really will calm you by being grateful you can’t be you know angry at someone and be grateful the same time you truly will be able to center yourself relax a little bit more. The more often you’re grateful to others so I bring to you the short video turn this season to remind you not only that there is a difference between gratitude and thankfulness but there is a difference in just holding that gratitude close to you versus expressing it inviting you to express it as much as you can.\n\n.680]\n\nHopefully, you’re enjoying these solo episodes this is a little bit of behind the scenes of things that I’m thinking and I’m talking about with my clients I’m sharing with you because I think it would help you if you’re tuning in today. I appreciate you being here is a part of my community.\n\n.710]\n\nI’m grateful that you just listen. I see the download numbers and they continue to grow so I would just want to say thank you as always lead with courage. I’ll see you next time.\n\nDisclaimer: This transcript was created using YouTube’s translator tool and that may mean that some of the words, grammar, and typos come from a misinterpretation of the video.\n\nResources\n\nBest of Leaders in the Trenches Podcast Episodes\n\nShare the LOVE and TWEET about this episode.\n\nA QUICK FAVOR\n\nAnd lastly, please leave a rating and review for the Growth Think Tank on iTunes (or Stitcher) – it will help us in many ways, but it also inspires us to keep doing what we are doing here.
