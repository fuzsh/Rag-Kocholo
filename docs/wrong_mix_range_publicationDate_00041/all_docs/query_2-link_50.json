It forms the first half hour of the show, and you can listen to it here.\n\nThe book is a guided tour of architectural projects that didn’t quite make it off the drawing board. We talk about the original design for the bridge across the Avon Gorge, and why the existing bridge isn’t exactly Brunel’s design. We discuss the history of the Severn Barrage, which stretches all the way back into the 19th Century. If you want to know why there are no trams in Bristol, and why there are no nude statues outside City Hall, do listen in. We only scratched the surface of the book, and could easily have talked for another half hour."
