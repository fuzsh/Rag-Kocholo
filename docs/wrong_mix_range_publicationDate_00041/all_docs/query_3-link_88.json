        "text": "Atkins, Lucy. The Night Visitor.\n\nQuercus. ISBN 9781681440224. THRILLER\n\nNew novelist Olive versus Vivian, the researcher who knows her secrets, in this tale of hubris and deception with a shocking finale. Dripping with suspense, violence, and a bit of the supernatural, this psychological thriller fits alongside the works of Ruth Ware and Gillian Flynn. (LJ 7/18)\n\nBerney, Lou. November Road.\n\nMorrow. ISBN 9780062663849. THRILLER\n\nIn the wake of the Kennedy assassination, two desperate people flee their circumstances. Frank Guidry, a fixer for the mob, realizes he’s a disposable target after dropping a getaway car in Dallas. Charlotte Ray leaves a broken marriage. Their paths converge in a dramatic story with unforgettable, complicated characters. This beautifully written crime novel has “depth and genre crossover appeal.” (LJ 9/1/18)\n\nClark, Tracy. Broken Places.\n\nKensington. ISBN 9781496714879. MYS\n\nClark’s action-packed debut introduces African American Chicago cop–turned–PI Cass Raines. When Cass’s surrogate father, a local priest, is found dead in his church alongside a gangbanger, she blames herself. The vividly written characters are led by Cass, a gutsy character reminiscent of Sue Grafton’s Kinsey Millhone. (LJ 5/1/18)\n\nFredericks, Mariah. A Death of No Importance.\n\nMinotaur: St. Martin’s. ISBN 9781250152978. MYS\n\nFredericks’s adult mystery debut confronts the social issues and class inequities of early 20th-century New York. Years after the 1910 murder of high-society ne’er-do-well Norrie Newsome, Jane Prescott recalls the case from her perspective as maid to ­Norrie’s fiancée and her nouveau riche family. (LJ 2/1/18)\n\nFrench, Tana. The Witch Elm.\n\nViking. ISBN 9780735224629. SUSPENSE\n\nWhen a skeleton is found inside a tree in the yard of the house where Toby and his cousins spent youthful summers, Toby is forced to question everything he knows. French’s first stand-alone novel considers memory, privilege, and the unseen ripples of thoughtless actions. It’s both an in-depth character study and a cracking yarn. (LJ 9/15/18)\n\nLippman, Laura. Sunburn.\n\nMorrow. ISBN 9780062389923. SUSPENSE\n\nTwo seemingly lost souls with secrets and motives aplenty meet in a scruffy Delaware town in Lippman’s modern noir. Lippman tops herself once again, with nuanced, well-drawn characters, a twisty doom-laden plot, and, of course, Baltimore and its environs. Her best novel so far—and that’s saying a lot! (LJ 10/1/17)\n\nLoewenstein, Laurie. Death of a Rainmaker.\n\nKaylie Jones: Akashic. ISBN 9781617756795. MYS\n\nThe Depression and a 240-day-long dry spell drive the desperate townspeople of Vermillion, OK, to hire a rainmaker, but he’s murdered, leaving sheriff Temple Jennings to investigate. Loewen­stein’s terrific historical mystery wears its history lightly and its humanity beautifully. The first in a series, it’s a realistic, expertly drawn novel with characters you’ll come to love. (LJ 10/1/18)\n\nMukherjee, Abir. A Necessary Evil.\n\nPegasus Crime. ISBN 9781681776712. MYS\n\nIn 1920s Calcutta, Sgt. Banerjee and Capt. Sam Wyndham investigate when a crown prince is assassinated. This atmospheric mystery establishes a strong sense of place through the life of a wealthy maharaja, as well as other details of Indian culture and tradition. (LJ 2/1/18)\n\nNakamura, Fuminori. Cult X.\n\nSoho Crime. ISBN 9781616957865. MYS\n\nToru is searching for his missing girlfriend Ryoko, but his only lead is a quiet compound belonging to an eccentric Buddhist guru. He joins the group only to find that some members have splintered into a darker sect known as Cult X. Inspired by the 1995 sarin gas attack in Tokyo, ­Nakamura offers a provocative look into the world of extremist beliefs in modern culture. (LJ 5/1/18)\n\nSiger, Jeffrey. An Aegean April.\n\nPoisoned Pen. ISBN 9781464209451. MYS\n\nMihalis Volandes had a plan to deal humanely with the refugees passing through the Greek island of Lesvos, but the human traffickers who profit from them have other plans. When Mihalis is murdered, the crime is blamed on a refugee, and CI Andreas Kaldis must catch the real culprit. This topical page-turner vividly depicts the political and economic issues involved in the European refugee crisis. (LJ 1/18)\n\nHendrix, Grady. We Sold Our Souls.\n\nQuirk. ISBN 9781683690122.\n\nIt’s the 1990s and heavy metal rules the rock world. Lead singer Terry Hunt leaves his band, reimagines himself as a solo artist named Koffin, and becomes a superstar. Twenty years later, his bandmates, including guitarist Kris Pulaski, toil away in relative obscurity. Then Kris discovers something shockingly evil and sets out to reunite the band. Hendrix cranks the satire and chills to 11 in this hard-rocking story. (LJ 8/18)\n\nOrtberg, Daniel Mallory. The Merry Spinster: Tales of Everyday Horror.\n\nHolt. ISBN 9781250113429.\n\nWith wicked humor and skillful prose, Ortberg pens a delightfully chilling collection of retold fairy tales, folklore, and biblical stories. From intersectional ­reimaginings of “The Little Mermaid” and “The Frog Prince” to smart nods to classic children’s works, each eerie tale packs a surprising punch.\n\nSaadawi, Ahmed. Frankenstein in Baghdad.\n\nPenguin. ISBN 9780143128793.\n\nA Man Booker Prize finalist, winner of the International Prize for Arabic Fiction, and France’s Grand Prize for Fantasy, ­Saadawi’s modern horror story combines the classic elements of Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein and the over-the-top gore and humor of 1980s B movies with the sobering reality of contemporary Iraq. An unforgettable and unsettling tale. (LJ 11/1/17)\n\nStage, Zoje. Baby Teeth.\n\nSt. Martin’s. ISBN 9781250170750.\n\nSeven-year-old Hanna silently connives to kill her mother so she can have dear daddy all to herself. Mom Suzette alternates between feelings of revulsion and guilt, desperate to connect with her daughter but increasingly terrified of her. With echoes of The Bad Seed and We Need To Talk About Kevin, this macabre psychological thriller dives deep into the dark side of motherhood. (LJ 4/1/18)\n\nStoker, Dacre & J.D. Barker. Dracul.\n\nPutnam. ISBN 9780735219342.\n\nThe great-grandnephew of Bram Stoker and best-selling author Barker team up to deliver a Dracula prequel. Bram takes center stage as the protagonist whose life was altered by a strange nanny named Ellen Crone who cured him of a debilitating childhood illness. Now an adult, Bram and his siblings are on the hunt for the ageless Ellen and the terrifying villain at the heart of this family mystery. (LJ 9/15/18)\n\nTremblay, Paul. The Cabin at the End of the World.\n\nMorrow. ISBN 9780062679109.\n\nIn this nail-biting work of psychological horror, seven-year-old Wen is vacationing at a remote cabin with her dads when a group of menacing strangers with weapons and a bizarre story arrive. Tremblay’s sharp and unflinching view of human violence will shake readers to their core. (LJ 3/15/18)\n\nAckerman, Elliot . Waiting for Eden.\n\nKnopf. ISBN 9781101947395.\n\nNot surprisingly, veteran Ackerman decisively pinpoints the horror of war as he shows soldier Eden Malcom lying speechless and immobilized in a hospital bed, with wife Mary sitting determinedly by and the whole narrated by a fellow soldier who didn’t make it back.
