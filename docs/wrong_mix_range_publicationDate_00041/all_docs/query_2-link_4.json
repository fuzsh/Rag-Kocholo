        "text": "Hi Eloise\n\nBooks: There are a number in the local section down your library. Couple of suggestions – ‘Bristol Blitz: The Untold Story’ by Helen Reid is good on the censorship and secrecy. See also ‘Bristol Under Siege’ by the same author. ‘Bristol Blitz Diary’ by John Dike is also useful. For a (sanitised) oral history, get ‘Bristol Siren Nights’ by the Rev. S. Paul Shipley.\n\nWeb: You’ll find Fishponds Local History Soc website extremely useful, especially the material by John Penny at http://fishponds.org.uk/index.html This man knows his stuff; see his source list especially.\n\nArchives: For morale, Mass Observation is the obvious start. I assume you can query the archive for Bristol material, but I’ve never used it myself. You’ll need to go to Brighton for this. http://www.massobs.org.uk/index.htm\n\nFor Bristol archives, it’s well worth asking at the Bristol Record Office what they have that may be of relevance. The minutes of the Council’s Watch Committee, for instance, might have some useful material. You should also ask at the Reference Library in the Central Library; they have astonishing amounts of printed matter, and the staff are always very helpful."
