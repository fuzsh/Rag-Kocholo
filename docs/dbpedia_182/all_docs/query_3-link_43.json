        "text": "This study aims to assess ethnobotanical knowledge in Kabylia, focusing on the traditional uses of medicinal plants. The purpose was to quantify the traditional knowledge of medicinal plants commonly used by local populations for treating a wide range of ailments, with a view to preserve the medicinal knowledge and the biodiversity of this area. Ethnobotanical data was gathered using a questionnaire. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 69 key informants at six villages of Bouira province. A quantitative analysis by means of diﬀerent indices including the informant consensus factor (FIC), use value (UV), relative frequencies of citation (RFC), and fidelity level (FL), was performed for the recorded medicinal plants. Overall, 136 plants species were recorded. Their uses in 10 disease categories were documented. They belong to 54 families, the most represented are the Asteraceae (18 species) and Lamiaceae (16 species). With 98 use reports, diabetes is the most treated ailmen...\n\nThis paper presents the first quantitative ethnobotanical study of the flora in the semi-arid region in the southwest part of Algeria. The aim of this ethnobotanical survey in the region of El Bayadh situated in the semi-arid part of Algeria was to identify the main medicinal plants used by the local inhabitants to treat different diseases and to collect all the data on their therapeutic characteristics. One hundred informants of different ages were interviewed for this study (69 women and 31 men). Both quantitative and qualitative information were collected through open semi-structured face-to-face interviews with the local people. Data were organized and analyzed by descriptive statistics. The ethnobotanical data were analyzed using various important quantitative indices calculated for each of the recorded medicinal plant species like use value (UV), relative frequency of citation (RFC), relative importance index (RII), informants’ agreement ratio (IAR), informant consensus factor...\n\nThis study carried out in the Aures region (Algeria) between September 2018 and March 2019, allowed us to identify spontaneous plants used in the region and gather all the information concerning the therapeutic practices of the local population. Based on a series of ethnobotanical surveys, we have identified 112 medicinal species belonging to 49 families, of which Asteraceae, Poaceae, Lamiaceae, Fabaceae, Amaranthaceae and Cupressaceae are the most represented. The leaves were the most used plant parts (28.86%), and the decoction (37.68%) represents the most frequently used mode of preparation. In addition, the remedies were prepared essentially from single species (81.15%) and were used mainly in the treatment of digestive disorders (23.99%). The study has also shown that women, married people, the elderly and illiterates people had the better knowledge of the use of medicinal plants. These results indicate that local population has a fairly deep empirical and traditional knowledge...\n\nThe knowledge of the plants that are used may provide insight on their properties for further exploration. This study aimed to identify and collect data about medicinal plants used in traditional medicine by the population of the provincial region of Taza, Morocco. An ethnobotanical survey was carried out among 200 informants, competent villagers, herbalists, and traditional healers from the provincial region of Taza city through direct interviews using a structured questionnaire. The survey reported 55 plant species belonging to 28 families used in the folk medicine. Informants&#39; results showed that the most frequently used plants were Origanum compactum, Mentha pulegium, Rosmarinus officinalis L., Aloysia citrodora, Calamintha officinalis Moench, and Artemisia herba-alba Asso., with a relative frequency of citation of 76%, 72%, 60%, 42%, 40%, and 30%, respectively. Moreover, in this study, the Lamiaceae family was the most commonly reported plant family, and the leaves were the...\n\nThis work is devoted to the study of medicinal plants in the southern region of BordjBouArreridj (communes of the Daïra of El Hammadia), and their different uses in traditional medecine. A series of surveys were conducted in the study area with inhabitants and herbalists, to acquire more informations about the therapeutic uses of medicinal plants practiced by the local population. The analysis of the results allowed us to identify 78 species belonging to 36 families, the most represented are: Apiaceae (13.92%), Lamiaceae (12.65%), Asteraceae (11.39%) and Liliaceae (5.06%). The most commonly parts used from these plants are respectively: the leaves (34.21%), the stems (17.54%), the fruits (12.28%), the roots (10.52%) and the seeds (8.77%). Medicinal plants are prepared and used as powder, infusion, especially as decoction and poultice. The most used is the decoction. The main common health problem treated are; digestive disorders (29.81%), respiratory disorders (10.55%), skin inflammations (9.17%), urinary inflammations (8.25%), liver diseases (6.88%) and neurologic problems (6.42%). El Hammadia has good ethnobotanical potential of medicinal plants. This study is the first contribution to the ethnobotany of this region. We have gathered from this province some considerable knowledge about local medicinal plants for treating diseases."
