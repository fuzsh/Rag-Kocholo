It also plays a role in creating and conserving the soil structure (Mayeux and Savanne, 1996). Soil fauna is an essential source of biodiversity that should be preserved, as these organisms play essential roles in maintaining soil quality (Chapman et al., 1997). Arthropods are the dominant element in the animal kingdom (Steiner et al., 2005). Those who live in the soil contribute to the decomposition of organic matter (Petersonan and Luxton, 1982). Arthropods are invertebrates and group together several classes, crustaceans, myriapods, arachnids, and insects, without neglecting mites and arachnids (Roth, 1980). The distribution and activity of these arthropods are mainly determined by climatic factors such as temperature and humidity (Thiele, 1977). Arthropods represent a considerable percentage of living species, and no one can give the exact number of these arthropods (Corbara, 2004). In Algeria, little work has been done on soil acarofauna, among others we cite that of Niedbala (1985) on some new Oribates, of Ghezali (1997) on the richness of mites in a forest environment in the national park of Chrea and Fekkoun, and Ghezali (2007) on the acarofauna of citrus orchards in Boufarik. In this study, we studied the relative abundance of acarofauna in different natural environments in the Wilaya of Djelfa.\n\nPresentation of study sites\n\nThis study was carried out in four regions; the region of Moudjebara extends over 20,000 ha with an altitude varying between 1,200 and 1,400 m. Its geographical coordinates respectively 3° 1713' to 3° 2540' east longitude and 34° 2840' to 34° 3912' north latitude. It is reforested by the Aleppo pine associated with natural plant formations (Alfa, Armoise, and Sparta). This station is mainly occupied by market gardening in open fields), in which we carried out our study. The second experimental perimeter is located at the level of the ITMAS Wilaya de Djelfa. The latter is planted by fruit trees, in which we have chosen an orchard of apple and olive trees. In the end, the region of Senalba chergui was chosen as a forest environment that extends over 19,833 ha at 1316 m a.s.l. This natural forest is occupied by the Aleppo pine associated with natural plant formations (alfa, sagebrush, and esparto) and a middle course. Its coordinates are 3°8 82 458 east longitude and 34° 2840 at 34 '37 61 787 north latitude.\n\nMites harvesting and observation technique\n\nHere we presented the fieldwork technique in the laboratory and the necessary equipment, adding the advantages and disadvantages of the technique used to observe mites.\n\nTaking soil samples\n\nThe sampling consists of taking six soil samples each month, from January 2015 until December 2015, with different depths 10 to 15 cm randomly using a pickaxe.\n\nExtraction of mites from the soil with the Berlese extractor\n\nIn this part, the description of Berlese's device is presented first; then, we have developed the advantages and disadvantages of this technique.\n\nDescription of the Berlese extractor\n\nAccording to Benkhelil (1992), the Berlese device is effective in capturing mites. The principle of this device is based on the negative phototaxis of mites (Vannier, 197O). According to Coineau et al. (1997), it is a dynamic or selective method that uses the tactism of individuals. The latter leave the sample by their average under the influence of the thermodynamic stimulus. The soil samples are placed on sieves of 1 to 2 mm mesh which are deposited on funnels. These are fixed by support surmounted by a lamp facing the ground. Mites sensitive to the light source leak in depth, slide down the slopes of the funnel and are finally collected in containers containing water. The duration of this extraction is 3 to 4 days.\n\nRelative abundance (R.A. %)\n\nThe abundance constitutes another essential parameter for the description of the structure of a stand (Ramade, 1989). The following equation can represent it:\n\nR.A. %=(ni x 100)/N\n\nR.A. %: Relative abundance of species i Present in the sample. Ni: Number of individuals of species i Have taken into account. N: Total number of individuals of all species together\n\nIn practice, here, R.A % is the relative abundance of each mite species present in each study station.\n\nResults\n\nRelative abundance of mite species captured by the Berlese apparatus in apple cultivation\n\nIn Table 1, the percentages of mites captured by the Berlese apparatus in apple tree cultivation have been presented in order of importance.\n\nSpecies ni R.A.%\n\nTrombidium sp. 207 29,28\n\nRhyzoglyphus sp. 186 26,31\n\nAcaridae sp. 182 25,74\n\nScheloribates sp. 81 11,46\n\nGamasida sp. 51 7,21\n\nTotals 707 100\n\nR.A.

Acaridae sp. ind. Scheloribates sp. Gamasida sp. ind.\n\nFig. 1. Relative abundance of mite species captured by the Berlese apparatus in the apple tree crop R.A. %: Relative abundance\n\nThanks to Berlese's apparatus, 707 individuals were captured, which are divided into 5 species. The most abundant species is Trombidium sp. With 207 individuals (29.28%), they were followed by Rhyzoglyphus sp. with 186 individuals (26.31%). In third place, we find Acaridae sp. with 182 individuals (25.74%). It is followed by Scheloribates sp. with 11.46%. The last position is occupied by Gamasida sp. with (7%) (Table 1, Fig. 1).\n\nRelative abundance of soil mite species captured by the Berlese apparatus in a forest environment\n\nThe monthly percentages of mite species identified by the Berlese apparatus in a forest environment are presented in Table 2.\n\nSpecies ni R.A. %\n\nRhyzoglyphus sp. 90 41,67\n\nScheloribates sp. 4 1,85\n\nGamasida sp. ind 15 6,94\n\nHeterobelba sp. 6 2,78\n\nTrombidium sp. 45 20,83\n\nOppius sp. 6 2,78\n\nScutovertex sp. 23 10,65\n\nGalumna sp. 8 3,70\n\nHaplacarus sp. 4 1,85\n\nArcoppia dechambrierorum 12 5,56\n\nScapheremaeus latus 3 1,39\n\nTotals 216 100,00\n\nR .A. Relative Abundance %. ni: Number of individuals.\n\nTable 2. Relative abundance of mite species captured by the Berlese apparatus in a forest environment.\n\nFig. 2. Relative abundance of mite species captured by the Berlese apparatus in a forest environment.\n\nThe use of Berlese's apparatus made it possible to capture 216 individuals; these individuals are divided between 11 species. The most abundant species is Rhyzoglyphussp. With 90 individuals (41.67%), they were followed by Trombidium sp. with 45 ind. (20.83%). In third place is Scutovertexsp. With 23 individuals (10.65%). It is followed by Gamasida sp. with 6.9%. The species that remain their abundances do not exceed (5.5%) (Table 2, Fig. 2).\n\nRelative abundance of mites captured by the Berlese apparatus in a pasture environment\n\nThe monthly percentages of mite species identified by the Berlese apparatus in a pasture environment are presented in Table 3.\n\nSpecies ni A.R. %\n\nScutovertex sp. 249 43,46\n\nGamasida sp. ind 141 24,61\n\nOppiussp. 39 6,81\n\nEpiiohmannia cyiindrica 20 3,49\n\nRhyzoglyphus sp. 73 12,74\n\nSheioribates sp. 51 8,90\n\nTotals 573 100\n\nR .A.

Epilohmanniia Rhyzoglyphus Sheloribates cylindrica sp. sp.\n\nFig. 3. Relative abundance of mite species captured by the Berlèse apparatus in a pasture environment.\n\nThe use of Berlèse's device allowed the capture of 573 individuals, which are divided into six species. The most abundant species is Scutovertex sp. With 249 individuals (43.46%), it is followed by Gamasida sp. with 141 individuals (24.61%). In third place is Rhyzoglyphus sp. With 73 individuals (12.74%), Scheloribates sp. occupies the fifth position with a frequency equal to 8.9% (Table 3, Fig. 3).\n\nDiscussion\n\nFekkoun et al. (2011) note that the order Oribatida is best represented by an undetermined species of Opiidae which has the highest frequency (A.R.%=47.5%) with 356 individuals in a cultivated environment in the Mitidja plain.\n\nThe inventory of mites recovered in the Berlèse apparatus carried out by Ghezali and Fekkoun (2012) made it possible to identify 2 orders of Gamasida and Oribatida in the two bioclimatic stages, arid and semi-arid, of which the most abundant species is Scheloribates sp. with 8 individuals (A.R. %=36.4%) in an arid bioclimatic stage and 18 individuals (A.R.%=27.3%) in a semi-arid bioclimatic stage. Kalakhi (2006) notes that the species of Gamasus sp. is most abundant in an olive orchard with 419 individuals (AR%=96.3%) and in the wheat field with 73 individuals (AR%=62.9%) Fekkoun and Ghezali (2007) note that Oppiidae sp. with 1326 individuals (A.R.%=43.0%) occupies the first place followed by Scheloribates sp. with 845 individuals (A.R.%=27.4%) in the Boufarik region.\n\nAcknowledgment\n\nWe thank everyone who contributed to enriching this research from near or far.
