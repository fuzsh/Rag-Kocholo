It generates goods and services that benefit humankind such as timber and fuel, tourism, protection of watersheds and carbon storage [1], [2]. However, present intensifying forest fire activities are becoming a major concern as they pose threats to the environment, economy and human’s safety. Pausas and Keeley [3] and Liu et al. [4] described fire as an extensive process in the earth system and one of the most important factors for natural ecosystems. Despite its role in earth processes, fire is also one of the disturbance factors in forests [5].\n\nForest ecosystems for years have been exposed and have had to adapt to disturbances that are affecting them. Disturbances in forest may include storms, snow breakage, snow avalanches, fire and animal activities [6], [7]. These disturbances help to form forest ecosystem by affecting their composition, structure and functional processes [6]. For instance, forest structure in 50 years old forest stands had changed after surviving snow avalanche. However, absence of soil disturbance and micro-climatic parameter for 20 years made the species composition in the area nearly similar to the pre-avalanche situation [7]. This shows that the presence of disturbances can affect the forest’s ecosystem.\n\nSoutheast Asian countries are under threat due to the increase in forest fire occurrence. It has damaged significant amount of forested area in the region annually. In Riau province, about 6,000 hectares of land and forest were damaged by fire in 2014. The fire incidents in the area had made the Pollutant Standard Index (PSI) to exceed to 100 and reach a dangerous level [8]. In 2015, a total of 2.6 million hectares of forest and farmland were reported affected by fire in Aceh [9]. Brunei as one of Southeast Asian’s countries is significantly affected by the increasing forest fire activities in the country. Between 2007 and 2015, forest fire calls increased by 82%, for which, increased number of calls was received in recent years [10]. The intensifying forest fire activities affected Brunei’s air quality. According to the JASTRe [11], Brunei’s air quality got worsened and air pollution levels exceeded the standards in 2015.\n\nIn addition, forest fire can result in serious damage to the socio-economic, public property and potentially pose threat to human’s lives [12-14]. Intense forest fire activities in the central and west Borneo in 2013 worsened Brunei's air quality, so that Brunei's Pollutant Standard Index (PSI) reached nearly 100. This PSI reading is categorised as ‘moderate' and may result in minor health effects such as coughing, eye irritation and a running nose [15].\n\nTo further elaborate, Southeast Asian countries suffered extensive forest fire occurrences between 1997 and 1998, which eventually resulted in a devastating smoke-haze event that affected Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei. This incident damaged millions of hectares of forested area in the region. According to Someshwar et al. [16], 10 million hectares of land in Indonesia were damaged due to these forest fires, and this included 1.5 million hectares of peat swamp forests and 750,000 hectares of peat forest in Kalimantan provinces.\n\nThe widespread forest fires in Southeast Asia in 1997 caused serious economic impacts to the region. The effects were predicted to be $3.15 billion in 1997, while the Economy and Environment Programme for Southeast Asia (EEPSEA) estimated the total losses for the year 1997 and 1998 to be between $5 and $6 billion, respectively. Brunei, in particular, suffered the economic loss of $2 million due the 1998 forest fires and haze event [17].\n\nThis research focuses on the identification of forest fire hotspots and proposes mitigation measures to minimize the adverse impact of forest fire. A good understanding of forest fire risks is crucial in order to be able to properly manage forest fire. Guettouche and Derias [18] reported that forest fire risk management starts from its assessment. Many studies conducted have suggested that fire risk evaluation is a critical part and the foremost task in fire management [19-22]. Risk assessment involves the identification of risks and the reduction of frequency and magnitude of risks through preventive measures.\n\nHe et al. [23] identified three key requirements to manage forest fire risks namely (1) identification of hotspots (2) evaluation of the risk probability and (3) measures to reduce the risks. These key requirements are practically aligned with strategies proposed by some authors [12], [20] in evaluating forest fire risk using Geographical Information Systems (GIS). Most researchers studied the potential risks through the mapping of forest fire hotspots [20], [22], [24]. Identification of forest fire hotspots can be useful and helpful to improve the strength of current control and preventive measures of forest fire.\n\nOne of the tools that enables the identification of forest fire hotspots is GIS. The GIS provides means that can help to illustrate the spatial extension of forest fire hotspots. Due to this, GIS has been widely used by researchers for fire risk assessment [4], [12], [13], [20], [24], [25].\n\nKernel Density and Getis-Ord Gi* hotspot analysis are two types of GIS analyses that have been widely used in hotspot identification. The kernel is an estimator that is most commonly used and it functions by generalizing or smoothing discrete point data into a continuous surface area [26], [27]. In contrast, Getis-Ord Gi* utilizes Gi* statistics to measure the degree of correlation of weighted features within the specified distance threshold [28-30]. Gi* statistics was described by Getis and Ord and it can be used to identify clustering pattern with respect to the study area [28, 29].\n\nGetis-Ord Gi* is a spatial autocorrelation method that enables the recognition and understanding of hot and cold spots. Spatial autocorrelation statistics is frequently used in evaluating the degree of clustering, randomness or fragmentation of a spatial pattern [31]. Getis-Ord Gi* is a spatial autocorrelation method that enables the recognition and understanding of hot and cold spots. According to Wubuli et al [31], spatial autocorrelation involves global and local spatial autocorrelation. The global spatial autocorrelation calculates the total degree of spatial autocorrelation for a dataset, while the local spatial autocorrelation identifies the location and types of clusters [31].\n\nThe local Getis-Ord Gi* statistics work by comparing the local sum for a feature and its neighbors is compared accordingly to the sums of all features. It calculates z-score and p-score of each feature in the study area, representing whether the differences between the local and global means are statistically significant or otherwise [32]. In addition, the statistics shows the extent of clustering pattern within the study area based on the calculated values [29]. Gi*statistics determines the clustering pattern of the hotspot and coldspot in a study area by indicating the statistical significance of the calculated z-score. A larger value of z score indicates a hot spot whereas, a lower value of z-score indicates the clustering of cold spots [32].\n\nIn addition, Gi* statistics were able to concurrently capture the frequency of the events, their corresponding values and spatial relationship [30]. According to Rosenshein [33], kernel density and getis-ord gi* are two different geospatial analyses, in which Kernel Density performs calculation by considering arbitrary search radius and the cell size while Getis-Ord Gi* considers the magnitude of each feature in the dataset in the context of its neighbours’ values.\n\nChainey [34] compared Gi* to other hotspot mapping techniques, including Kernel Density, for crime hotspot mapping. Based on the prediction accuracy index (PAI), Gi* gave the best results in predicting the spatial extension of crime hotspots. Moreover Getis-Ord Gi* was the best mapping technique for capturing local clusters of crimes, and thus the identification of statistically significant crime hotspots.\n\nGetis-Ord Gi* is also widely used in other disciplines essentially in health research, incident prevention and biodiversity distribution. Wubuli et al. [31], used Geits-Ord statistic in detecting spatial clustering of pulmonary Tuberculosis (TB) incidence in Xinjiang, China. They identified social and demographic predictors for TB incidence, and based on the studies, they were able to identify regions that should be prioritized by the government as an effort to control TB.\n\nIn addition, Getis-Ord statistics was used in identifying weather-crash pattern in Wisconsin county, the United States [35]. Using this method, they observed that weather was a contributor to higher number of crashes in some regions of the county. Thus, identification of locations for high weather-crash can be useful for the implementation of countermeasures in the affected area for road safety.\n\nThe following sections of this paper demonstrate the application of Getis-Ord Gi* GIS approach for the identification of forest fire hotspots in a study area in Brunei Darussalam. The adequacy of fire stations within the identified forest fire hotspots is evaluated, and the suitable locations for new fire stations are suggested.\n\n3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\n3.1. Forest Fire Statistics\n\nIncreasing number of forest fire activities can be observed in Fig. (7). Number of calls in Brunei Darussalam increased by 80% from 2007 to April 2016 with intense forest fire occurrences in the recent years. Brunei-Muara District often recorded the highest number of forest fire incidents in comparison to the other districts. According to Brunei Fire and Rescue Department [47], between January and March 2016, a total of 332 forest fire calls were recorded in the district. This represents the highest number of total incidents compared to the other districts.\n\n3.2. Forest Fire Hotspots\n\nFig. (8a) shows the forest fire calls in Brunei before Getis-Ord Gi* tool was applied, and Fig. (8b) shows the output of Getis-Ord Gi* tool. This tool provides output in terms of GIZScore map that indicates the hot and cold spots in the study area. In addition, it generates point features that indicate hot and cold spots in the study area (Fig. 8b). This tool derived output named GiZScore which generates z-score value for each feature that helps to indicate the statistical significance of feature clusters, and eventually the hot and cold spots. In Fig. (8b), it can be seen that hotspots and coldspots are presented by points where the values were 1.576269>z>0.303554 (red) and -1.209978<z<-0.203445 (blue) standard deviations, respectively. In addition, Fig. (8b) shows that features with high positive value of z score are specified as the hotspots (red), whereas features with low value of z score are specified as the cold spots (blue). The z score helps to indicate whether the features show a random pattern or they show statistically significant clustering or dispersion, which presents that there is an underlying spatial processes at work. Therefore, for statistically significant positive z score, the higher the value, the intense the clustering of the hotspot. For statistically significant negative z score, the lower the value, the stronger the clustering of cold spots [51], [54].\n\nInversed Distance Weighted (IDW) is applied to the hotspot map generated using Getis-Ord Gi* analysis for the visualization of hotspots. IDW is one of many interpolation techniques that is widely used for mapping the spatial extension of hotspots. It creates smooth continuous surface on the forest fire hotspots distributed across the study area. The continuous smooth surface is classified into 5 different classes of hotspots, as shown in Fig. (9). The Very High (red) areas reflect that the areas require more attention from the local government and fire and rescue Ddepartments in managing the forest fire incidence as forest fire are more congregated with a high value of z-score in those areas. In contrast, the very low areas (blue) show the statistically significant clustering pattern of negative z-score. These areas require the least attention as they are considered as the cold spots. Whereas, the areas that are characterized high, moderate and low require a different level of attention depending on the areas.\n\nIn addition, Fig. (9) reveals that forest fire hotspots are most intensified at the Northern part of Brunei Muara District and towards the shoreline. Whereas, the cold spots are more concentrated at the centre of the district. The red zones indicate areas with significant spatial clustering that have a very high value of z score.\n\nRegions and villages interfering with the very high hotspots marked in red are summarized in Table 1.\n\nTable 1 reveals that Kg Tungku has the largest potential affected area by forest fires in comparison to other affected villages and regions. It accounted to 25.37% of the total area interfering with the very high forest fire hotspots, followed by Kg Junjongan with a percentage of 16.56%.\n\n3.3. Fire Stations Service Area Coverage\n\nService area map can be useful in determining the effectiveness of the current locations of fire stations in the district. According to Fire and Rescue Department, the speed of fire pumper truck varies and depends on the road and traffic conditions. In addition, safety and surroundings also need to be taken into consideration. Speeds of 56km/h and 80km/h were, therefore, selected for this study. Speed of 56 km/h was selected based on the studies conducted by RAND [55] on average speed of fire pumper truck. This speed is the average speed of fire pumper truck considering the average terrain, average traffic, weather and interruptions at intersections. Another service area map was generated for the speed of 80 km/h. Both speeds were selected to determine the coverage area of each fire station in the study area. 5-minute and 8-minute drive-time were selected to evaluate and compare the extent of the fire stations coverage areas for the two drive-time scenarios. The service area maps produced were then integrated with the identified hotspots for evaluation, as shown in Figs. (10 and 11).\n\nThe green points in Fig. (10) reveal distant regions where it is impossible to reach within 8 minutes from any fire station in the study area at an average driving speed of 56 km/h. Kg Masin, Kg Bebatik, Kg Mulaut, Kg Kulapis and Perumahan Tanah Jambu are represented by the green points in Fig. (10), which indicate that these villages are the farthest locations from any fire stations in the study area. These villages and regions were also found to be located within the high and moderate forest fire hotspots. Fig. (11) shows that the whole study area can be covered within 8-minute drive-time at a speed of 80km/h. Figs. (10 and 11) also show that although a few fire stations are close to the very high hotspots, the majority of fire stations in the study area are concentrated at the very low hotspots.\n\nSuitability analysis was applied on the identified hotspot to determine the most suitable location for a new fire station. The suitability analysis used [56] was to identify a suitable site for the development of new fire stations in the district. A new fire station could improve the emergency services of Fire and Rescue Department in the District. Therefore, the suitable location for new fire stations was determined based on factors shown in Fig. (12).\n\nFire and Rescue Department needs a good access to road for the pumper truck. Therefore, a good potential site should be close to the main road and the hotspot regions. In addition, the new site for fire station needs to be placed in areas that are unreachable within 5 minutes by the current available fire stations in the district. Fig. (13a) shows the potential suitable locations for new fire station in the district. Value 5 (red) in Fig. (13a) indicates that the areas are the most suitable area as they lie in the vicinity of the main road and the Very High hotspot and in addition, they are away from 5 minutes' drive-time. Whereas, value 1 (green) represents the least suitable location for the fire station as it is closer to the cold spots and reachable within 5 minutes.\n\nThe newest fire station in the district was built in 2012 on an area with the size of about 1.2Ha. Therefore, in an attempt to narrow down the suitable locations, areas with size of at least 1.2Ha were identified and potential suitable location can be seen in Fig. (13b)."
