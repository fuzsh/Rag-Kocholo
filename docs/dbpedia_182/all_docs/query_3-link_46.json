        "text": "Forecasting Error Calculation with Mean Absolute Deviation and Mean Absolute Percentage Error\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKhair, Ummul; Fahmi, Hasanul; Hakim, Sarudin Al; Rahim, Robbi\n\n2017-12-01\n\nPrediction using a forecasting method is one of the most important things for an organization, the selection of appropriate forecasting methods is also important but the percentage error of a method is more important in order for decision makers to adopt the right culture, the use of the Mean Absolute Deviation and Mean Absolute Percentage Error to calculate the percentage of mistakes in the least square method resulted in a percentage of 9.77% and it was decided that the least square method be worked for time series and trend data.\n\nAstigmatism error modification for absolute shape reconstruction using Fourier transform method\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHe, Yuhang; Li, Qiang; Gao, Bo; Liu, Ang; Xu, Kaiyuan; Wei, Xiaohong; Chai, Liqun\n\n2014-12-01\n\nA method is proposed to modify astigmatism errors in absolute shape reconstruction of optical plane using Fourier transform method. If a transmission and reflection flat are used in an absolute test, two translation measurements lead to obtain the absolute shapes by making use of the characteristic relationship between the differential and original shapes in spatial frequency domain. However, because the translation device cannot guarantee the test and reference flats rigidly parallel to each other after the translations, a tilt error exists in the obtained differential data, which caused power and astigmatism errors in the reconstructed shapes. In order to modify the astigmatism errors, a rotation measurement is added. Based on the rotation invariability of the form of Zernike polynomial in circular domain, the astigmatism terms are calculated by solving polynomial coefficient equations related to the rotation differential data, and subsequently the astigmatism terms including error are modified. Computer simulation proves the validity of the proposed method.\n\nAbsolute color scale for improved diagnostics with wavefront error mapping.\n\nPubMed\n\nSmolek, Michael K; Klyce, Stephen D\n\n2007-11-01\n\nWavefront data are expressed in micrometers and referenced to the pupil plane, but current methods to map wavefront error lack standardization. Many use normalized or floating scales that may confuse the user by generating ambiguous, noisy, or varying information. An absolute scale that combines consistent clinical information with statistical relevance is needed for wavefront error mapping. The color contours should correspond better to current corneal topography standards to improve clinical interpretation. Retrospective analysis of wavefront error data. Historic ophthalmic medical records. Topographic modeling system topographical examinations of 120 corneas across 12 categories were used. Corneal wavefront error data in micrometers from each topography map were extracted at 8 Zernike polynomial orders and for 3 pupil diameters expressed in millimeters (3, 5, and 7 mm). Both total aberrations (orders 2 through 8) and higher-order aberrations (orders 3 through 8) were expressed in the form of frequency histograms to determine the working range of the scale across all categories. The standard deviation of the mean error of normal corneas determined the map contour resolution. Map colors were based on corneal topography color standards and on the ability to distinguish adjacent color contours through contrast. Higher-order and total wavefront error contour maps for different corneal conditions. An absolute color scale was produced that encompassed a range of +/-6.5 microm and a contour interval of 0.5 microm. All aberrations in the categorical database were plotted with no loss of clinical information necessary for classification. In the few instances where mapped information was beyond the range of the scale, the type and severity of aberration remained legible. When wavefront data are expressed in micrometers, this absolute scale facilitates the determination of the severity of aberrations present compared with a floating scale, particularly for distinguishing\n\nSub-nanometer periodic nonlinearity error in absolute distance interferometers\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYang, Hongxing; Huang, Kaiqi; Hu, Pengcheng; Zhu, Pengfei; Tan, Jiubin; Fan, Zhigang\n\n2015-05-01\n\nPeriodic nonlinearity which can result in error in nanometer scale has become a main problem limiting the absolute distance measurement accuracy. In order to eliminate this error, a new integrated interferometer with non-polarizing beam splitter is developed. This leads to disappearing of the frequency and/or polarization mixing. Furthermore, a strict requirement on the laser source polarization is highly reduced. By combining retro-reflector and angel prism, reference and measuring beams can be spatially separated, and therefore, their optical paths are not overlapped. So, the main cause of the periodic nonlinearity error, i.e., the frequency and/or polarization mixing and leakage of beam, is eliminated. Experimental results indicate that the periodic phase error is kept within 0.0018Â°.\n\nCorrection of a Technical Error in the Golf Swing: Error Amplification Versus Direct Instruction.\n\nPubMed\n\nMilanese, Chiara; Corte, Stefano; Salvetti, Luca; Cavedon, Valentina; Agostini, Tiziano\n\n2016-01-01\n\nPerformance errors drive motor learning for many tasks. The authors' aim was to determine which of two strategies, method of amplification of error (MAE) or direct instruction (DI), would be more beneficial for error correction during a full golfing swing with a driver. Thirty-four golfers were randomly assigned to one of three training conditions (MAE, DI, and control). Participants were tested in a practice session in which each golfer performed 7 pretraining trials, 6 training-intervention trials, and 7 posttraining trials; and a retention test after 1 week. An optoeletronic motion capture system was used to measure the kinematic parameters of each golfer's performance. Results showed that MAE is an effective strategy for correcting the technical errors leading to a rapid improvement in performance. These findings could have practical implications for sport psychology and physical education because, while practice is obviously necessary for improving learning, the efficacy of the learning process is essential in enhancing learners' motivation and sport enjoyment.\n\nMethodological variations and their effects on reported medication administration error rates.\n\nPubMed\n\nMcLeod, Monsey Chan; Barber, Nick; Franklin, Bryony Dean\n\n2013-04-01\n\nMedication administration errors (MAEs) are a problem, yet methodological variation between studies presents a potential barrier to understanding how best to increase safety. Using the UK as a case-study, we systematically summarised methodological variations in MAE studies, and their effects on reported MAE rates. Nine healthcare databases were searched for quantitative observational MAE studies in UK hospitals. Methodological variations were analysed and meta-analysis of MAE rates performed using studies that used the same definitions. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated to compare MAE rates between intravenous (IV) and non-IV doses, and between paediatric and adult doses. We identified 16 unique studies reporting three MAE definitions, 44 MAE subcategories and four different denominators. Overall adult MAE rates were 5.6% of a total of 21 533 non-IV opportunities for error (OE) (95% CI 4.6% to 6.7%) and 35% of a total of 154 IV OEs (95% CI 2% to 68%). MAEs were five times more likely in IV than non-IV doses (pooled OR 5.1; 95% CI 3.5 to 7.5). Including timing errors of Â±30 min increased the MAE rate from 27% to 69% of 320 IV doses in one study. Five studies were unclear as to whether the denominator included dose omissions; omissions accounted for 0%-13% of IV doses and 1.8%-5.1% of non-IV doses. Wide methodological variations exist even within one country, some with significant effects on reported MAE rates. We have made recommendations for future MAE studies; these may be applied both within and outside the UK.\n\nStudents' Mathematical Work on Absolute Value: Focusing on Conceptions, Errors and Obstacles\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nElia, Iliada; Ãzel, Serkan; Gagatsis, Athanasios; Panaoura, Areti; Ãzel, Zeynep Ebrar Yetkiner\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThis study investigates students' conceptions of absolute value (AV), their performance in various items on AV, their errors in these items and the relationships between students' conceptions and their performance and errors.

It can act as a safety net to prevent unintended harm to patients if detected. However, medication administration errors (MAEs) during this process have been documented and thought to be preventable. In pediatric medicine, doses are usually administered based on the childâs weight or body surface area. This in turn increases the risk of drug miscalculations and therefore MAEs. The aim of this review is to report MAEs occurring in pediatric inpatients. Methods Twelve bibliographic databases were searched for studies published between January 2000 and February 2015 using âmedication administration errorsâ, âhospitalâ, and âchildrenâ related terminologies. Handsearching of relevant publications was also carried out. A second reviewer screened articles for eligibility and quality in accordance with the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Key findings A total of 44 studies were systematically reviewed. MAEs were generally defined as a deviation of dose given from that prescribed; this included omitted doses and administration at the wrong time. Hospital MAEs in children accounted for a mean of 50% of all reported medication error reports (n=12,588). It was also identified in a mean of 29% of doses observed (n=8,894). The most prevalent type of MAEs related to preparation, infusion rate, dose, and time. This review has identified five types of interventions to reduce hospital MAEs in children: barcode medicine administration, electronic prescribing, education, use of smart pumps, and standard concentration. Conclusion This review has identified a wide variation in the prevalence of hospital MAEs in children. This is attributed to the definition and method used to investigate MAEs. The review also illustrated the complexity and multifaceted nature of MAEs. Therefore, there is a need to develop a set of safety measures to tackle these errors in pediatric practice. PMID:29354530\n\nWillingness of nurses to report medication administration errors in southern Taiwan: a cross-sectional survey.\n\nPubMed\n\nLin, Yu-Hua; Ma, Su-mei\n\n2009-01-01\n\nUnderreporting of medication administering errors (MAEs) is a threat to the quality of nursing care. The reasons for MAEs are complex and vary by health professional and institution. The purpose of this study was to explore the prevalence of MAEs and the willingness of nurses to report them. A cross-sectional study was conducted involving a survey of 14 medical surgical hospitals in southern Taiwan. Nurses voluntarily participated in this study. A structured questionnaire was completed by 605 participants. Data were collected from February 1, 2005 to March 15, 2005 using the following instruments: MAEs Unwillingness to Report Scale, Medication Errors Etiology Questionnaire, and Personal Features Questionnaire. One additional question was used to identify the willingness of nurses to report medication errors: \"When medication errors occur, should they be reported to the department?\" This question helped to identify the willingness or lack thereof, to report incident errors. The results indicated that 66.9% of the nurses reported experiencing MAEs and 87.7% of the nurses had a willingness to report the MAEs if there were no consequences for reporting. The nurses' willingness to report MAEs differed by job position, nursing grade, type of hospital, and hospital funding. The final logistic regression model demonstrated hospital funding to be the only statistically significant factor. The odds of a willingness to report MAEs increased 2.66-fold in private hospitals (p = 0.032, CI = 1.09 to 6.49), and 3.28 in nonprofit hospitals (p = 0.00, CI = 1.73 to 6.21) when compared to public hospitals. This study demonstrates that reporting of MAEs should be anonymous and without negative consequences in order to monitor and guide improvements in hospital medication systems.\n\nCauses of medication administration errors in hospitals: a systematic review of quantitative and qualitative evidence.\n\nPubMed\n\nKeers, Richard N; Williams, Steven D; Cooke, Jonathan; Ashcroft, Darren M\n\n2013-11-01\n\nUnderlying systems factors have been seen to be crucial contributors to the occurrence of medication errors. By understanding the causes of these errors, the most appropriate interventions can be designed and implemented to minimise their occurrence. This study aimed to systematically review and appraise empirical evidence relating to the causes of medication administration errors (MAEs) in hospital settings. Nine electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, ASSIA, PsycINFO, British Nursing Index, CINAHL, Health Management Information Consortium and Social Science Citations Index) were searched between 1985 and May 2013. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to identify eligible publications through title analysis followed by abstract and then full text examination. English language publications reporting empirical data on causes of MAEs were included. Reference lists of included articles and relevant review papers were hand searched for additional studies. Studies were excluded if they did not report data on specific MAEs, used accounts from individuals not directly involved in the MAE concerned or were presented as conference abstracts with insufficient detail. A total of 54 unique studies were included. Causes of MAEs were categorised according to Reason's model of accident causation. Studies were assessed to determine relevance to the research question and how likely the results were to reflect the potential underlying causes of MAEs based on the method(s) used. Slips and lapses were the most commonly reported unsafe acts, followed by knowledge-based mistakes and deliberate violations. Error-provoking conditions influencing administration errors included inadequate written communication (prescriptions, documentation, transcription), problems with medicines supply and storage (pharmacy dispensing errors and ward stock management), high perceived workload, problems with ward-based equipment (access, functionality\n\nAssessing Suturing Skills in a Self-Guided Learning Setting: Absolute Symmetry Error\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nBrydges, Ryan; Carnahan, Heather; Dubrowski, Adam\n\n2009-01-01\n\nDirected self-guidance, whereby trainees independently practice a skill-set in a structured setting, may be an effective technique for novice training.

Despite previous efforts utilizing computerized methods to monitor medication errors, sustaining effective and accurate detection of MAEs remains challenging. In this study, we developed a real-time MAE detection system and evaluated its performance prior to system integration into institutional workflows. Our prospective observational study included automated MAE detection of 10 high-risk medications and fluids for patients admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center during a 4-month period. The automated system extracted real-time medication use information from the institutional electronic health records and identified MAEs using logic-based rules and natural language processing techniques. The MAE summary was delivered via a real-time messaging platform to promote reduction of patient exposure to potential harm. System performance was validated using a physician-generated gold standard of MAE events, and results were compared with those of current practice (incident reporting and trigger tools). Physicians identified 116 MAEs from 10â104 medication administrations during the study period. Compared to current practice, the sensitivity with automated MAE detection was improved significantly from 4.3% to 85.3% (Pâ=â.009), with a positive predictive value of 78.0%. Furthermore, the system showed potential to reduce patient exposure to harm, from 256âmin to 35âmin (Pâ<â.001). The automated system demonstrated improved capacity for identifying MAEs while guarding against alert fatigue. It also showed promise for reducing patient exposure to potential harm following MAE events.\n\nTemperature Variability Associated with the Middle Atmosphere Electrodynamics (MAE-1) Campaign\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSchmidlin, F. J.\n\n1999-01-01\n\nMeteorological rockets launched during the Middle Atmosphere Electrodynamics (MAE-1) Campaign in October 1980 from Andoya Rocket Range (ARR), Norway, exhibited large and unexpected temperature variability. Temperatures were found to vary as much as 20 C within a few hours and demonstrated a similar type of variability from one day to the next. Following examination of the reduced rocketsonde profiles the question was raised whether the observed variability was due to natural atmospheric variability or instrument malfunction. Small-scale variability, as observed, may result from one or multiple sources, e.g., intense storms upstream from the observing site, orography such as mountain waves off of the Greenland Plateau, convective activity, gravity waves, etc. Arranging the observations spaced over time showed that the perturbations moved downward. Prior to MAE-1 very few small rocketsonde measurements had been launched from ARR, thus the quality of the initial measurements in early October caused concern when the large variability was noted. We discuss the errors of the rocketsonde measurements, graphically review the nature of the variability observed, compare the data with other measurements, and postulate a possible cause for the variability.\n\n31 CFR 354.9 - Liability of Sallie Mae and Federal Reserve Banks.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2010 CFR\n\n2010-07-01\n\n...

The commonly used error statistics, such as the mean signed and mean unsigned errors, do not inform end-users on the expected amplitude of prediction errors attached to these methods. We show that, the distributions of model errors being neither normal nor zero-centered, these error statistics cannot be used to infer prediction error probabilities. To overcome this limitation, we advocate for the use of more informative statistics, based on the empirical cumulative distribution function of unsigned errors, namely, (1) the probability for a new calculation to have an absolute error below a chosen threshold and (2) the maximal amplitude of errors one can expect with a chosen high confidence level. Those statistics are also shown to be well suited for benchmarking and ranking studies. Moreover, the standard error on all benchmarking statistics depends on the size of the reference dataset. Systematic publication of these standard errors would be very helpful to assess the statistical reliability of benchmarking conclusions.\n\nOptimal quantum error correcting codes from absolutely maximally entangled states\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRaissi, Zahra; Gogolin, Christian; Riera, Arnau; AcÃ­n, Antonio\n\n2018-02-01\n\nAbsolutely maximally entangled (AME) states are pure multi-partite generalizations of the bipartite maximally entangled states with the property that all reduced states of at most half the system size are in the maximally mixed state. AME states are of interest for multipartite teleportation and quantum secret sharing and have recently found new applications in the context of high-energy physics in toy models realizing the AdS/CFT-correspondence. We work out in detail the connection between AME states of minimal support and classical maximum distance separable (MDS) error correcting codes and, in particular, provide explicit closed form expressions for AME states of n parties with local dimension \\\n\nRelative and Absolute Error Control in a Finite-Difference Method Solution of Poisson's Equation\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nPrentice, J.

The key to such a goal is to improving the accuracy of SI traceable absolute calibration across infrared and reflected solar wavelengths allowing climate change to be separated from the limit of natural variability. The advances required to reach on-orbit absolute accuracy to allow climate change observations to survive data gaps exist at NIST in the laboratory, but still need demonstration that the advances can move successfully from to NASA and/or instrument vendor capabilities for spaceborne instruments. The current work describes the radiometric calibration error budget for the Solar, Lunar for Absolute Reflectance Imaging Spectroradiometer (SOLARIS) which is the calibration demonstration system (CDS) for the reflected solar portion of CLARREO. The goal of the CDS is to allow the testing and evaluation of calibration approaches, alternate design and/or implementation approaches and components for the CLARREO mission. SOLARIS also provides a test-bed for detector technologies, non-linearity determination and uncertainties, and application of future technology developments and suggested spacecraft instrument design modifications. The resulting SI-traceable error budget for reflectance retrieval using solar irradiance as a reference and methods for laboratory-based, absolute calibration suitable for climatequality data collections is given. Key components in the error budget are geometry differences between the solar and earth views, knowledge of attenuator behavior when viewing the sun, and sensor behavior such as detector linearity and noise behavior. Methods for demonstrating this error budget are also presented.\n\nMotion mechanisms with different spatiotemporal characteristics identified by an MAE technique with superimposed gratings.\n\nPubMed\n\nShioiri, Satoshi; Matsumiya, Kazumichi\n\n2009-05-29\n\nWe investigated spatiotemporal characteristics of motion mechanisms using a new type of motion aftereffect (MAE) we found. Our stimulus comprised two superimposed sinusoidal gratings with different spatial frequencies. After exposure to the moving stimulus, observers perceived the MAE in the static test in the direction opposite to that of the high spatial frequency grating even when low spatial frequency motion was perceived during adaptation. In contrast, in the flicker test, the MAE was perceived in the direction opposite to that of the low spatial frequency grating. These MAEs indicate that two different motion systems contribute to motion perception and can be isolated by using different test stimuli. Using a psychophysical technique based on the MAE, we investigated the differences between the two motion mechanisms. The results showed that the static MAE is the aftereffect of the motion system with a high spatial and low temporal frequency tuning (slow motion detector) and the flicker MAE is the aftereffect of the motion system with a low spatial and high temporal frequency tuning (fast motion detector). We also revealed that the two motion detectors differ in orientation tuning, temporal frequency tuning, and sensitivity to relative motion.\n\nPrediction of Shock Arrival Times from CME and Flare Data\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nNunez, Marlon; Nieves-Chinchilla, Teresa; Pulkkinen, Antti\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThis paper presents the Shock ARrival Model (SARM) for predicting shock arrival times for distances from 0.72 AU to 8.7 AU by using coronal mass ejections (CME) and flare data. SARM is an aerodynamic drag model described by a differential equation that has been calibrated with a dataset of 120 shocks observed from 1997 to 2010 by minimizing the mean absolute error (MAE), normalized to 1 AU. SARM should be used with CME data (radial, earthward or plane-of-sky speeds), and flare data (peak flux, duration, and location). In the case of 1 AU, the MAE and the median of absolute errors were 7.0 h and 5.0 h respectively, using the available CMEflare data. The best results for 1 AU (an MAE of 5.8 h) were obtained using both CME data, either radial or cone-model-estimated speeds, and flare data. For the prediction of shock arrivals at distances from 0.72 AU to 8.7 AU, the normalized MAE and the median were 7.1 h and 5.1 h respectively, using the available CMEflare data. SARM was also calibrated to be used with CME data alone or flare data alone, obtaining normalized MAE errors of 8.9 h and 8.6 h respectively for all shock events. The model verification was carried out with an additional dataset of 20 shocks observed from 2010 to 2012 with radial CME speeds to compare SARM with the empirical ESA model [Gopalswamy et al., 2005a] and the numerical MHD-based ENLIL model [Odstrcil et al., 2004]. The results show that the ENLIL's MAE was lower than the SARM's MAE, which was lower than the ESA's MAE. The SARM's best results were obtained when both flare and true CME speeds were used.\n\nA review on Black-Scholes model in pricing warrants in Bursa Malaysia\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGunawan, Nur Izzaty Ilmiah Indra; Ibrahim, Siti Nur Iqmal; Rahim, Norhuda Abdul\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThis paper studies the accuracy of the Black-Scholes (BS) model and the dilution-adjusted Black-Scholes (DABS) model to pricing some warrants traded in the Malaysian market. Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) are used to compare the two models. Results show that the DABS model is more accurate than the BS model for the selected data.\n\nA large-area, spatially continuous assessment of land cover map error and its impact on downstream analyses.\n\nPubMed\n\nEstes, Lyndon; Chen, Peng; Debats, Stephanie; Evans, Tom; Ferreira, Stefanus; Kuemmerle, Tobias; Ragazzo, Gabrielle; Sheffield, Justin; Wolf, Adam; Wood, Eric; Caylor, Kelly\n\n2018-01-01\n\nLand cover maps increasingly underlie research into socioeconomic and environmental patterns and processes, including global change. It is known that map errors impact our understanding of these phenomena, but quantifying these impacts is difficult because many areas lack adequate reference data. We used a highly accurate, high-resolution map of South African cropland to assess (1) the magnitude of error in several current generation land cover maps, and (2) how these errors propagate in downstream studies. We first quantified pixel-wise errors in the cropland classes of four widely used land cover maps at resolutions ranging from 1 to 100Â km, and then calculated errors in several representative \"downstream\" (map-based) analyses, including assessments of vegetative carbon stocks, evapotranspiration, crop production, and household food security. We also evaluated maps' spatial accuracy based on how precisely they could be used to locate specific landscape features. We found that cropland maps can have substantial biases and poor accuracy at all resolutions (e.g., at 1Â km resolution, up to â¼45% underestimates of cropland (bias) and nearly 50% mean absolute error (MAE, describing accuracy); at 100Â km, up to 15% underestimates and nearly 20% MAE). National-scale maps derived from higher-resolution imagery were most accurate, followed by multi-map fusion products. Constraining mapped values to match survey statistics may be effective at minimizing bias (provided the statistics are accurate). Errors in downstream analyses could be substantially amplified or muted, depending on the values ascribed to cropland-adjacent covers (e.g., with forest as adjacent cover, carbon map error was 200%-500% greater than in input cropland maps, but â¼40% less for sparse cover types). The average locational error was 6Â km (600%). These findings provide deeper insight into the causes and potential consequences of land cover map error, and suggest several recommendations for land\n\n31 CFR 354.5 - Obligations of Sallie Mae; no adverse claims.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2010 CFR\n\n2010-07-01\n\n...-ENTRY SECURITIES OF THE STUDENT LOAN MARKETING ASSOCIATION (SALLIE MAE) Â§ 354.5 Obligations of Sallie... a Federal Reserve Bank or otherwise as provided in Â§ 354.4(c)(1), for the purposes of this part 354, Sallie Mae and the Federal Reserve Banks shall treat the Participant to whose Securities Account an...\n\nIMPROVEMENT OF SMVGEAR II ON VECTOR AND SCALAR MACHINES THROUGH ABSOLUTE ERROR TOLERANCE CONTROL (R823186)\n\nEPA Science Inventory\n\nThe computer speed of SMVGEAR II was improved markedly on scalar and vector machines with relatively little loss in accuracy.

This study used a cross-sectional nonparticipant observational technique. Study participants (nurses) were observed preparing and administering medication at the ED of a 2000-bed tertiary care hospital in Accra, Ghana. The observations were then compared with patients' medication charts, and identified errors were clarified with staff for possible causes. Of the 1332 observations made, involving 338 patients and 49 nurses, 362 had errors, representing 27.2%. However, the error rate excluding \"lack of drug availability\" fell to 12.8%. Without wrong time error, the error rate was 22.8%. The 2 most frequent error types were omission (n = 281, 77.6%) and wrong time (n = 58, 16%) errors. Omission error was mainly due to unavailability of medicine, 48.9% (n = 177). Although only one of the errors was potentially fatal, 26.7% were definitely clinically severe. The common themes that dominated the probable causes of MAEs were unavailability, staff factors, patient factors, prescription, and communication problems. This study gives credence to similar studies in different settings that MAEs occur frequently in the ED of hospitals. Most of the errors identified were not potentially fatal; however, preventive strategies need to be used to make life-saving processes such as drug administration in such specialized units error-free.\n\nMapping the absolute magnetic field and evaluating the quadratic Zeeman-effect-induced systematic error in an atom interferometer gravimeter\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHu, Qing-Qing; Freier, Christian; Leykauf, Bastian; Schkolnik, Vladimir; Yang, Jun; Krutzik, Markus; Peters, Achim\n\n2017-09-01\n\nPrecisely evaluating the systematic error induced by the quadratic Zeeman effect is important for developing atom interferometer gravimeters aiming at an accuracy in the Î¼ Gal regime (1 Î¼ Gal =10-8m /s2 â10-9g ). This paper reports on the experimental investigation of Raman spectroscopy-based magnetic field measurements and the evaluation of the systematic error in the gravimetric atom interferometer (GAIN) due to quadratic Zeeman effect. We discuss Raman duration and frequency step-size-dependent magnetic field measurement uncertainty, present vector light shift and tensor light shift induced magnetic field measurement offset, and map the absolute magnetic field inside the interferometer chamber of GAIN with an uncertainty of 0.72 nT and a spatial resolution of 12.8 mm. We evaluate the quadratic Zeeman-effect-induced gravity measurement error in GAIN as 2.04 Î¼ Gal . The methods shown in this paper are important for precisely mapping the absolute magnetic field in vacuum and reducing the quadratic Zeeman-effect-induced systematic error in Raman transition-based precision measurements, such as atomic interferometer gravimeters.\n\nOptimization of microwave-assisted extraction with saponification (MAES) for the determination of polybrominated flame retardants in aquaculture samples.\n\nPubMed\n\nFajar, N M; Carro, A M; Lorenzo, R A; Fernandez, F; Cela, R\n\n2008-08-01\n\nThe efficiency of microwave-assisted extraction with saponification (MAES) for the determination of seven polybrominated flame retardants (polybrominated biphenyls, PBBs; and polybrominated diphenyl ethers, PBDEs) in aquaculture samples is described and compared with microwave-assisted extraction (MAE). Chemometric techniques based on experimental designs and desirability functions were used for simultaneous optimization of the operational parameters used in both MAES and MAE processes. Application of MAES to this group of contaminants in aquaculture samples, which had not been previously applied to this type of analytes, was shown to be superior to MAE in terms of extraction efficiency, extraction time and lipid content extracted from complex matrices (0.7% as against 18.0% for MAE extracts). PBBs and PBDEs were determined by gas chromatography with micro-electron capture detection (GC-muECD). The quantification limits for the analytes were 40-750 pg g(-1) (except for BB-15, which was 1.43 ng g(-1)). Precision for MAES-GC-muECD (%RSD < 11%) was significantly better than for MAE-GC-muECD (%RSD < 20%). The accuracy of both optimized methods was satisfactorily demonstrated by analysis of appropriate certified reference material (CRM), WMF-01.\n\nUnderstanding the causes of intravenous medication administration errors in hospitals: a qualitative critical incident study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKeers, Richard N; Williams, Steven D; Cooke, Jonathan; Ashcroft, Darren M\n\n2015-01-01\n\nObjectives To investigate the underlying causes of intravenous medication administration errors (MAEs) in National Health Service (NHS) hospitals. Setting Two NHS teaching hospitals in the North West of England. Participants Twenty nurses working in a range of inpatient clinical environments were identified and recruited using purposive sampling at each study site. Primary outcome measures Semistructured interviews were conducted with nurse participants using the critical incident technique, where they were asked to discuss perceived causes of intravenous MAEs that they had been directly involved with. Transcribed interviews were analysed using the Framework approach and emerging themes were categorised according to Reason's model of accident causation. Results In total, 21 intravenous MAEs were discussed containing 23 individual active failures which included slips and lapses (n=11), mistakes (n=8) and deliberate violations of policy (n=4). Each active failure was associated with a range of error and violation provoking conditions. The working environment was implicated when nurses lacked healthcare team support and/or were exposed to a perceived increased workload during ward rounds, shift changes or emergencies. Nurses frequently reported that the quality of intravenous dose-checking activities was compromised due to high perceived workload and working relationships. Nurses described using approaches such as subconscious functioning and prioritising to manage their duties, which at times contributed to errors. Conclusions Complex interactions between active and latent failures can lead to intravenous MAEs in hospitals. Future interventions may need to be multimodal in design in order to mitigate these risks and reduce the burden of intravenous MAEs.

In this paper, we assess hydrologic regimes of the Mae Chaem River with landuse change. Three plausible future forest-to-crop expansion scenarios and a scenario of crop-to-forest reversal were developed based on the landcover transition from 1989 to 2000, with emphasis on influences of elevation bands and irrigation diversion. Basin hydrologic responses were simulated using the Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model (DHSVM). Meteorological data from six weather stations inside and adjacent to the Mae Chaem watershed during the period 1993-2000 were the climate inputs. Computed stream flow was compared to observed discharge at Ban Mae Mu gauge on Mae Mu river, Ban Mae Suk gauge on Mae Suk river, and at Kaeng Ob Luang, located downstream from the district town in Mae Chaem. With current assumptions, expansion of highland crop fields led to slightly higher regulated annual and wet-season water yields compared to similar expansion in the lowland-midland zone. Actual downstream water availability was sensitive to irrigation diversion. This modeling approach can be a useful tool for water allocation for small watersheds undergoing rapid commercialization, because it alerts land managers to the potential range of water supply in wet and dry seasons, and provides information on spatial distribution of basin hydrologic components.\n\nDemand Forecasting: An Evaluation of DODs Accuracy Metric and Navys Procedures\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2016-06-01\n\ninventory management improvement plan, mean of absolute scaled error, lead time adjusted squared error, forecast accuracy, benchmarking, naÃ¯ve method...Manager JASA Journal of the American Statistical Association LASE Lead-time Adjusted Squared Error LCI Life Cycle Indicator MA Moving Average MAE...Mean Squared Error xvi NAVSUP Naval Supply Systems Command NDAA National Defense Authorization Act NIIN National Individual Identification Number\n\nSallie Mae Eyes Expansion beyond Its Charter.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nZook, Jim\n\n1995-01-01\n\nThe Student Loan Marketing Association (Sallie Mae) and the Clinton Administration are preparing legislation to transform the federally sponsored corporation into a private business but must negotiate complex political and financial issues.

Individuals with absolute pitch (AP) are able to assign a verbal label to musical notes and have enhanced abilities in pitch identification without reliance on an external referent. In this study we used dynamic causal modeling (DCM) to model effective connectivity of ERP responses to pitch perturbation in voice auditory feedback in musicians with relative pitch (RP), AP, and non-musician controls. We identified a network compromising left and right hemisphere superior temporal gyrus (STG), primary motor cortex (M1), and premotor cortex (PM). We specified nine models and compared two main factors examining various combinations of STG involvement in feedback pitch error detection/correction process. Our results suggest that modulation of left to right STG connections are important in the identification of self-voice error and sensory motor integration in AP musicians. We also identify reduced connectivity of left hemisphere PM to STG connections in AP and RP groups during the error detection and corrections process relative to non-musicians. We suggest that this suppression may allow for enhanced connectivity relating to pitch identification in the right hemisphere in those with more precise pitch matching abilities. Musicians with enhanced pitch identification abilities likely have an improved auditory error detection and correction system involving connectivity of STG regions. Our findings here also suggest that individuals with AP are more adept at using feedback related to pitch from the right hemisphere.

Before-and-after study in a surgical ward of a teaching hospital, involving patients and staff of that ward. Closed-loop electronic prescribing, automated dispensing, barcode patient identification and EMAR system. Percentage of new medication orders with a prescribing error, percentage of doses with medication administration errors (MAEs) and percentage given without checking patient identity. Time spent prescribing and providing a ward pharmacy service. Nursing time on medication tasks. Prescribing errors were identified in 3.8% of 2450 medication orders pre-intervention and 2.0% of 2353 orders afterwards (p<0.001; chi(2) test). MAEs occurred in 7.0% of 1473 non-intravenous doses pre-intervention and 4.3% of 1139 afterwards (p = 0.005; chi(2) test). Patient identity was not checked for 82.6% of 1344 doses pre-intervention and 18.9% of 1291 afterwards (p<0.001; chi(2) test). Medical staff required 15 s to prescribe a regular inpatient drug pre-intervention and 39 s afterwards (p = 0.03; t test). Time spent providing a ward pharmacy service increased from 68 min to 98 min each weekday (p = 0.001; t test); 22% of drug charts were unavailable pre-intervention.

Prediction of demand electricity can be done using time series models. In this paper, double moving average model, Holtâs exponential smoothing model, and grey model GM(1,1) are used to predict electricity demand in Indonesia under the condition of limited historical data. The result shows that grey model GM(1,1) has the smallest value of MAE (mean absolute error), MSE (mean squared error), and MAPE (mean absolute percentage error).\n\nGeneralized approach for using unbiased symmetric metrics with negative values: normalized mean bias factor and normalized mean absolute error factor\n\nEPA Science Inventory\n\nUnbiased symmetric metrics provide a useful measure to quickly compare two datasets, with similar interpretations for both under and overestimations.

The subject hospital adopted a closed-loop medication administration system. All medication administrations in the general wards were automatically recorded in real-time using radio-frequency identification, barcodes, and hand-held point-of-care devices. MAE alert logs recorded during a full 1âyear of 2012. We evaluated risk factors for MAE alerts including administration time, order type, medication route, the number of medication doses administered, and factors associated with nurse practices by logistic regression analysis. A total of 2â874â539 medication dose records from 30â232 patients (882.6 patient-years) were included in 2012. We identified 35â082 MAE alerts (1.22% of total medication doses). The MAE alerts were significantly related to administration at non-standard time [odds ratio (OR) 1.559, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.515-1.604], emergency order (OR 1.527, 95%CI 1.464-1.594), and the number of medication doses administered (OR 0.993, 95%CI 0.992-0.993). Medication route, nurse's employment duration, and working schedule were also significantly related. The MAE alert rate was 1.22% over the 1-year observation period in the hospital examined in this study. The MAE alerts were significantly related to administration time, order type, medication route, the number of medication doses administered, nurse's employment duration, and working schedule. The real-time closed-loop medication administration system contributed to improving patient safety by preventing potential MAEs. Copyright Â© 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Meanwhile, the actual ratings in most data sets are integers. In this paper, we discuss and demonstrate why rounding can bring different influences to these two metrics; prove that rounding is necessary in post-processing of the predicted ratings, eliminate of model prediction bias, improving the accuracy of the prediction. In addition, we also propose two new rounding approaches based on the predicted rating probability distribution, which can be used to round the predicted rating to an optimal integer rating, and get better prediction accuracy compared to the Basic Rounding approach. Extensive experiments on different data sets validate the correctness of our analysis and the effectiveness of our proposed rounding approaches.\n\nThe impact of a closedâloop electronic prescribing and administration system on prescribing errors, administration errors and staff time: a beforeâandâafter study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nFranklin, Bryony Dean; O'Grady, Kara; Donyai, Parastou; Jacklin, Ann; Barber, Nick\n\n2007-01-01\n\nObjectives To assess the impact of a closedâloop electronic prescribing, automated dispensing, barcode patient identification and electronic medication administration record (EMAR) system on prescribing and administration errors, confirmation of patient identity before administration, and staff time.

Box-Behnken experimental design with response surface methodology (RSM) was used for optimization of MAE. Extraction time (X1 , 15-35âmin), ethanol concentration (X2 , 50-90% w/w) and irradiation power (X3 , 400-800âW) were investigated as independent variables. Experimentally obtained values of investigated responses were fitted to a second-order polynomial model, and multiple regression analysis and analysis of variance were used to determine fitness of the model and optimal conditions. The optimal MAE conditions for simultaneous maximization of polyphenol yield and increased antioxidant activity were an extraction time of 19âmin, an ethanol concentration of 63% and an irradiation power of 570âW, while predicted values of TP, TF, IC50 and EC50 at optimal MAE conditions were 311.23âmg gallic acid equivalent per 100âg dry weight (DW), 213.66âmg catechin equivalent per 100âg DW, 0.0315âmgâmL(-1) and 0.1311âmgâmL(-1) respectively. RSM was successfully used for multi-response optimization of coriander seed polyphenols. Comparison of optimized MAE with conventional extraction techniques confirmed that MAE provides significantly higher polyphenol yields and extracts with increased antioxidant activity.

A CLARREO objective is to improve the accuracy of SI-traceable, absolute calibration at infrared and reflected solar wavelengths to reach on-orbit accuracies required to allow climate change observations to survive data gaps and observe climate change at the limit of natural variability. Such an effort will also demonstrate National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) approaches for use in future spaceborne instruments. The current work describes the results of laboratory and field measurements with the Solar, Lunar for Absolute Reflectance Imaging Spectroradiometer (SOLARIS) which is the calibration demonstration system (CDS) for the reflected solar portion of CLARREO. SOLARIS allows testing and evaluation of calibration approaches, alternate design and/or implementation approaches and components for the CLARREO mission. SOLARIS also provides a test-bed for detector technologies, non-linearity determination and uncertainties, and application of future technology developments and suggested spacecraft instrument design modifications. Results of laboratory calibration measurements are provided to demonstrate key assumptions about instrument behavior that are needed to achieve CLARREO's climate measurement requirements. Absolute radiometric response is determined using laser-based calibration sources and applied to direct solar views for comparison with accepted solar irradiance models to demonstrate accuracy values giving confidence in the error budget for the CLARREO reflectance retrieval.\n\n75 FR 44804 - Privacy Act of 1974; Notice of a New Privacy Act System of Records (SORN), Ginnie Mae Mortgage...\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2010-07-29\n\n...The Department proposes to establish a new Privacy Act SORN subject to the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), as amended, entitled Ginnie Mae Mortgage-Backed Security Unclaimed Funds System.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of different forecasting methods based on the monthly incidence of typhoid fever. The seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model and three different models inspired by neural networks, namely, back propagation neural networks (BPNN), radial basis function neural networks (RBFNN), and Elman recurrent neural networks (ERNN) were compared. The differences as well as the advantages and disadvantages, among the SARIMA model and the neural networks were summarized and discussed. The data obtained for 2005 to 2009 and for 2010 from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention were used as modeling and forecasting samples, respectively. The performances were evaluated based on three metrics: mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and mean square error (MSE). The results showed that RBFNN obtained the smallest MAE, MAPE and MSE in both the modeling and forecasting processes. The performances of the four models ranked in descending order were: RBFNN, ERNN, BPNN and the SARIMA model.

Therefore, this paper presents a reliable absolute analog code retrieval approach. The combination of unequal-period Gray code and phase shifting patterns at high frequencies are used to obtain high-frequency absolute analog code, and at low frequencies, the same unequal-period combination patterns are used to obtain the low-frequency absolute analog code. Next, the difference between the two absolute analog codes was employed to eliminate period jump errors, and a reliable unwrapped result can be obtained. Error analysis was used to determine the applicable conditions, and this approach was verified through theoretical analysis. The proposed approach was further verified experimentally. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can perform reliable analog code unwrapping.\n\nAbsolute calibration of optical flats\n\nDOEpatents\n\nSommargren, Gary E.\n\n2005-04-05\n\nThe invention uses the phase shifting diffraction interferometer (PSDI) to provide a true point-by-point measurement of absolute flatness over the surface of optical flats. Beams exiting the fiber optics in a PSDI have perfect spherical wavefronts. The measurement beam is reflected from the optical flat and passed through an auxiliary optic to then be combined with the reference beam on a CCD. The combined beams include phase errors due to both the optic under test and the auxiliary optic. Standard phase extraction algorithms are used to calculate this combined phase error. The optical flat is then removed from the system and the measurement fiber is moved to recombine the two beams. The newly combined beams include only the phase errors due to the auxiliary optic. When the second phase measurement is subtracted from the first phase measurement, the absolute phase error of the optical flat is obtained.\n\nMicrowave-assisted extraction (MAE) of bioactive saponin from mahogany seed (Swietenia mahogany Jacq)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWaziiroh, E.; Harijono; Kamilia, K.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nMahogany is frequently used for medicines for cancer, tumor, and diabetes, as it contains saponin and flavonoid. Saponin is a complex glycosydic compound consisted of triterpenoids or steroids. Saponin can be extracted from a plant by using a solvent extraction. Microwave Assisted Extraction (MAE) is a non-conventional extraction method that use micro waves in the process. This research was conducted by a Complete Random Design with two factors which were extraction time (120, 150, and 180 seconds) and solvent ratio (10:1, 15:1, and 20:1 v/w). The best treatment of MAE were the solvent ratio 15:1 (v/w) for 180 seconds. The best treatment resulting crude saponin extract yield of 41.46%, containing 11.53% total saponins, and 49.17% of antioxidant activity. Meanwhile, the treatment of maceration method were the solvent ratio 20:1 (v/w) for 48 hours resulting 39.86% yield of saponin crude extract, 9.26% total saponins and 56.23% of antioxidant activity. The results showed MAE was more efficient (less time of extraction and solvent amount) than maceration method.\n\n31 CFR 354.7 - Withdrawal of eligible Book-entry Sallie Mae Securities for conversion to definitive form.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2011 CFR\n\n2011-07-01\n\n... 31 Money and Finance:Treasury 2 2011-07-01 2011-07-01 false Withdrawal of eligible Book-entry...

Those methods are applied to predicting the volume of motorcycle sales in Indonesia from January 2005 to December 2016 (monthly). Both models are suitable for seasonal and trend component data. Technically, FSA defines time domain as the result of trend and seasonal component in different frequencies which is difficult to identify in the time domain analysis. With the hidden period is 2,918 â 3 and significant model order is 3, FSA model is used to predict testing data. Meanwhile, SSA has two main processes, decomposition and reconstruction. SSA decomposes the time series data into different components. The reconstruction process starts with grouping the decomposition result based on similarity period of each component in trajectory matrix. With the optimum of window length (L = 53) and grouping effect (r = 4), SSA predicting testing data. Forecasting accuracy evaluation is done based on Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The result shows that in the next 12 month, SSA has MAPE = 13.54 percent, MAE = 61,168.43 and RMSE = 75,244.92 and FSA has MAPE = 28.19 percent, MAE = 119,718.43 and RMSE = 142,511.17. Therefore, to predict volume of motorcycle sales in the next period should use SSA method which has better performance based on its accuracy.\n\nDetermination of Magneto-crystalline Anisotropy Energy (MAE) Of ordered L10 CoPt and FePt nanoparticles\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAlsaad, A.; Ahmad, A. A.; Shukri, A. A.; Bani-Younes, O. A.\n\n2018-02-01\n\nThe structural and magnetic properties of both L10 ordered FePt and CoPt nanoparticles make them potential candidates for optical-electronic and magneto-optical devices. First, we carried out an ab initio total energy minimization study to find the geometrical optimization of both L10 phases of FePt and CoPt nanoparticles. Then, we investigated the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE) of both systems along special line joining the points of high symmetry (A,B and C points) using super-cell slap approach with alternating layers Fe/Co and Pt along the (001) direction. We found that the point (A) has the highest MAE value for both systems, where the value of MAE in FePt is 8.89 Ã 107 erg/cm3 and in CoPt is 6.40 Ã 107 erg/cm3. Our spin density based calculations indicate that large spin-orbit interaction and the hybridization between Pt 5d states and Fe/Co 3d states are the dominant factors in determining the MAE in both systems.\n\nAssignment of the relative and absolute stereochemistry of two novel epoxides using NMR and DFT-GIAO calculations\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMoraes, F. C.; Alvarenga, E. S.; Demuner, A. J.; Viana, V. M.\n\n2018-07-01\n\nConsidering the potential biological application of isobenzofuranones, especially as agrochemical defensives, two novel epoxides, (1aR,2R,2aR,5S,5aS,6S,6aS)-5-(hydroxymethyl)hexahydro-2,6-methanooxireno[2,3-f]isobenzofuran-3(1aH)-one (9), and (1aS,2S,2aR,5S,5aS,6R,6aR)-5-(hydroxymethyl)hexahydro-2,6-methanooxireno[2,3-f]isobenzofuran-3(1aH)-one (10), were synthesized from the readily available D-mannitol in six steps. The multiplicities of the hydrogens located at the bridge of the bicycle are distinct for epoxides 9 and 10 due to W coupling, and this feature was employed to confirm the assignment of these nuclei. Besides analyses of the 2D NMR spectra, the assignments of the nuclei at the epoxide ring were also inferred from information obtained by theoretical calculations. The calculated 1H and 13C NMR chemical shifts for eight candidate structures were compared with the experimental chemical shifts of 9 and 10 by measuring the mean absolute errors (MAE) and by the DP4 statistical analysis. The structures and relative configurations of 9, and 10 were determined via NMR spectroscopy assisted with theoretical calculations. As consequence of the enantioselective syntheses starting from a natural polyol, the absolute configurations of the epoxides 9 and 10 were also defined.\n\nDoes exposure to simulated patient cases improve accuracy of clinicians' predictive value estimates of diagnostic test results? A within-subjects experiment at St Michael's Hospital, Toronto, Canada.\n\nPubMed\n\nArmstrong, Bonnie; Spaniol, Julia; Persaud, Nav\n\n2018-02-13\n\nClinicians often overestimate the probability of a disease given a positive test result (positive predictive value; PPV) and the probability of no disease given a negative test result (negative predictive value; NPV). The purpose of this study was to investigate whether experiencing simulated patient cases (ie, an 'experience format') would promote more accurate PPV and NPV estimates compared with a numerical format. Participants were presented with information about three diagnostic tests for the same fictitious disease and were asked to estimate the PPV and NPV of each test. Tests varied with respect to sensitivity and specificity. Information about each test was presented once in the numerical format and once in the experience format. The study used a 2 (format: numerical vs experience) Ã 3 (diagnostic test: gold standard vs low sensitivity vs low specificity) within-subjects design. The study was completed online, via Qualtrics (Provo, Utah, USA). 50 physicians (12 clinicians and 38 residents) from the Department of Family and Community Medicine at St Michael's Hospital in Toronto, Canada, completed the study. All participants had completed at least 1âyear of residency. Estimation accuracy was quantified by the mean absolute error (MAE; absolute difference between estimate and true predictive value). PPV estimation errors were larger in the numerical format (MAE=32.6%, 95%âCI 26.8% to 38.4%) compared with the experience format (MAE=15.9%, 95%âCI 11.8% to 20.0%, d =0.697, P<0.001). Likewise, NPV estimation errors were larger in the numerical format (MAE=24.4%, 95%âCI 14.5% to 34.3%) than in the experience format (MAE=11.0%, 95%âCI 6.5% to 15.5%, d =0.303, P=0.015). Exposure to simulated patient cases promotes accurate estimation of predictive values in clinicians. This finding carries implications for diagnostic training and practice.

Our team has successfully proposed a hybrid model combining both the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and the nonlinear autoregressive neural network (NARNN) models in the schistosomiasis and hand, foot, and mouth disease forecasting study. In this paper, our aim is to explore the application of the hybrid ARIMA-NARNN model to track the trends of the new admission inpatients, which provides a methodological basis for reducing crowding. We used the single seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA), NARNN and the hybrid SARIMA-NARNN model to fit and forecast the monthly and daily number of new admission inpatients. The root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) were used to compare the forecasting performance among the three models. The modeling time range of monthly data included was from January 2010 to June 2016, July to October 2016 as the corresponding testing data set. The daily modeling data set was from January 4 to September 4, 2016, while the testing time range included was from September 5 to October 2, 2016. For the monthly data, the modeling RMSE and the testing RMSE, MAE and MAPE of SARIMA-NARNN model were less than those obtained from the single SARIMA or NARNN model, but the MAE and MAPE of modeling performance of SARIMA-NARNN model did not improve. For the daily data, all RMSE, MAE and MAPE of NARNN model were the lowest both in modeling stage and testing stage. Hybrid model does not necessarily outperform its constituents' performances. It is worth attempting to explore the reliable model to forecast the number of new admission inpatients from different data.\n\n78 FR 77450 - Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Loan Purchase Limits: Request for Public Input on Implementation Issues\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2013-12-23\n\n... reductions in Freddie Mac's and Fannie Mae's loan purchase limits.

A.\n\n2009-02-01\n\nAn approach is proposed for estimating absolute errors and finding approximate solutions to classical NP-hard scheduling problems of minimizing the maximum lateness for one or many machines and makespan is minimized. The concept of a metric (distance) between instances of the problem is introduced. The idea behind the approach is, given the problem instance, to construct another instance for which an optimal or approximate solution can be found at the minimum distance from the initial instance in the metric introduced. Instead of solving the original problem (instance), a set of approximating polynomially/pseudopolynomially solvable problems (instances) are considered, an instance at the minimum distance from the given one is chosen, and the resulting schedule is then applied to the original instance.\n\nComparison of Accuracy in Intraocular Lens Power Calculation by Measuring Axial Length with Immersion Ultrasound Biometry and Partial Coherence Interferometry.\n\nPubMed\n\nRuangsetakit, Varee\n\n2015-11-01\n\nTo re-examine relative accuracy of intraocular lens (IOL) power calculation of immersion ultrasound biometry (IUB) and partial coherence interferometry (PCI) based on a new approach that limits its interest on the cases in which the IUB's IOL and PCI's IOL assignments disagree. Prospective observational study of 108 eyes that underwent cataract surgeries at Taksin Hospital. Two halves ofthe randomly chosen sample eyes were implanted with the IUB- and PCI-assigned lens. Postoperative refractive errors were measured in the fifth week. More accurate calculation was based on significantly smaller mean absolute errors (MAEs) and root mean squared errors (RMSEs) away from emmetropia. The distributions of the errors were examined to ensure that the higher accuracy was significant clinically as well. The (MAEs, RMSEs) were smaller for PCI of (0.5106 diopter (D), 0.6037D) than for IUB of (0.7000D, 0.8062D). The higher accuracy was principally contributedfrom negative errors, i.e., myopia. The MAEs and RMSEs for (IUB, PCI)'s negative errors were (0.7955D, 0.5185D) and (0.8562D, 0.5853D). Their differences were significant. The 72.34% of PCI errors fell within a clinically accepted range of Â± 0.50D, whereas 50% of IUB errors did. PCI's higher accuracy was significant statistically and clinically, meaning that lens implantation based on PCI's assignments could improve postoperative outcomes over those based on IUB's assignments.\n\nAn affordable cuff-less blood pressure estimation solution.\n\nPubMed\n\nJain, Monika; Kumar, Niranjan; Deb, Sujay\n\n2016-08-01\n\nThis paper presents a cuff-less hypertension pre-screening device that non-invasively monitors the Blood Pressure (BP) and Heart Rate (HR) continuously. The proposed device simultaneously records two clinically significant and highly correlated biomedical signals, viz., Electrocardiogram (ECG) and Photoplethysmogram (PPG). The device provides a common data acquisition platform that can interface with PC/laptop, Smart phone/tablet and Raspberry-pi etc. The hardware stores and processes the recorded ECG and PPG in order to extract the real-time BP and HR using kernel regression approach. The BP and HR estimation error is measured in terms of normalized mean square error, Error Standard Deviation (ESD) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), with respect to a clinically proven digital BP monitor (OMRON HBP1300). The computed error falls under the maximum standard allowable error mentioned by Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation; MAE <; 5 mmHg and ESD <; 8mmHg. The results are validated using two-tailed dependent sample t-test also. The proposed device is a portable low-cost home and clinic bases solution for continuous health monitoring.\n\nPalynology and organic/isotope geochemistry of the Mae Moh Basin, Northern Thailand\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nMinh, L.V.; Abrajano, T.; Burden, E.\n\nThe Mae Moh basin is one of several Tertiary intermontane basins in northern Thailand, whose evolution has been linked to the collision of the Indian plate with the Eurasian plate since the early Eocene. As in most of these basins, lacustrine/swamp sedimentation in the Mae Moh basin can be broadly divided into an Oligocene to Miocene synrift sequence and a Miocene to Quarternary postrift sequence. The dominance of swamp flora recognized from spore and pollen assemblages (e.g., Polypodiidites usmensis, Verrucatosporites, Cyrtostachys), as well as the abundance of macrophytes and woody debris, indicate overwhelming hot and humid swamp conditions, with lakemoreÂ Â» development restricted to relatively small areas. The distribution of alkanes and their compound-specific carbon isotope compositions are used to further show climatic variations affecting the lake/swamp ecology during the deposition of the synrift sequence.Â«Â less\n\nExperiments on the applicability of MAE techniques for predicting sound diffraction by irregular terrains. [Matched Asymptotic Expansion\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBerthelot, Yves H.; Pierce, Allan D.; Kearns, James A.\n\n1987-01-01\n\nThe sound field diffracted by a single smooth hill of finite impedance is studied both analytically, within the context of the theory of Matched Asymptotic Expansions (MAE), and experimentally, under laboratory scale modeling conditions. Special attention is given to the sound field on the diffracting surface and throughout the transition region between the illuminated and the shadow zones. The MAE theory yields integral equations that are amenable to numerical computations. Experimental results are obtained with a spark source producing a pulse of 42 microsec duration and about 130 Pa at 1 m. The insertion loss of the hill is inferred from measurements of the acoustic signals at two locations in the field, with subsequent Fourier analysis on an IBM PC/AT. In general, experimental results support the predictions of the MAE theory, and provide a basis for the analysis of more complicated geometries.\n\nModeling and forecasting of KLCI weekly return using WT-ANN integrated model\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLiew, Wei-Thong; Liong, Choong-Yeun; Hussain, Saiful Izzuan; Isa, Zaidi\n\n2013-04-01\n\nThe forecasting of weekly return is one of the most challenging tasks in investment since the time series are volatile and non-stationary. In this study, an integrated model of wavelet transform and artificial neural network, WT-ANN is studied for modeling and forecasting of KLCI weekly return. First, the WT is applied to decompose the weekly return time series in order to eliminate noise. Then, a mathematical model of the time series is constructed using the ANN. The performance of the suggested model will be evaluated by root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The result shows that the WT-ANN model can be considered as a feasible and powerful model for time series modeling and prediction.\n\n[Application of wavelet neural networks model to forecast incidence of syphilis].\n\nPubMed\n\nZhou, Xian-Feng; Feng, Zi-Jian; Yang, Wei-Zhong; Li, Xiao-Song\n\n2011-07-01\n\nTo apply Wavelet Neural Networks (WNN) model to forecast incidence of Syphilis. Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) and WNN were developed based on the monthly incidence of Syphilis in Sichuan province from 2004 to 2008. The accuracy of forecast was compared between the two models. In the training approximation, the mean absolute error (MAE), rooted mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) were 0.0719, 0.0862 and 11.52% respectively for WNN, and 0.0892, 0.1183 and 14.87% respectively for BPNN. The three indexes for generalization of models were 0.0497, 0.0513 and 4.60% for WNN, and 0.0816, 0.1119 and 7.25% for BPNN. WNN is a better model for short-term forecasting of Syphilis.\n\nQSAR modeling of human serum protein binding with several modeling techniques utilizing structure-information representation.\n\nPubMed\n\nVotano, Joseph R; Parham, Marc; Hall, L Mark; Hall, Lowell H; Kier, Lemont B; Oloff, Scott; Tropsha, Alexander\n\n2006-11-30\n\nFour modeling techniques, using topological descriptors to represent molecular structure, were employed to produce models of human serum protein binding (% bound) on a data set of 1008 experimental values, carefully screened from publicly available sources. To our knowledge, this data is the largest set on human serum protein binding reported for QSAR modeling. The data was partitioned into a training set of 808 compounds and an external validation test set of 200 compounds. Partitioning was accomplished by clustering the compounds in a structure descriptor space so that random sampling of 20% of the whole data set produced an external test set that is a good representative of the training set with respect to both structure and protein binding values. The four modeling techniques include multiple linear regression (MLR), artificial neural networks (ANN), k-nearest neighbors (kNN), and support vector machines (SVM). With the exception of the MLR model, the ANN, kNN, and SVM QSARs were ensemble models. Training set correlation coefficients and mean absolute error ranged from r2=0.90 and MAE=7.6 for ANN to r2=0.61 and MAE=16.2 for MLR. Prediction results from the validation set yielded correlation coefficients and mean absolute errors which ranged from r2=0.70 and MAE=14.1 for ANN to a low of r2=0.59 and MAE=18.3 for the SVM model. Structure descriptors that contribute significantly to the models are discussed and compared with those found in other published models. For the ANN model, structure descriptor trends with respect to their affects on predicted protein binding can assist the chemist in structure modification during the drug design process.\n\nHydraulic head estimation at unobserved locations: Approximating the distribution of the absolute error based on geologic interpretations\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLangousis, Andreas; Kaleris, Vassilios; Xeygeni, Vagia; Magkou, Foteini\n\n2017-04-01\n\nAssessing the availability of groundwater reserves at a regional level, requires accurate and robust hydraulic head estimation at multiple locations of an aquifer. To that extent, one needs groundwater observation networks that can provide sufficient information to estimate the hydraulic head at unobserved locations. The density of such networks is largely influenced by the spatial distribution of the hydraulic conductivity in the aquifer, and it is usually determined through trial-and-error, by solving the groundwater flow based on a properly selected set of alternative but physically plausible geologic structures. In this work, we use: 1) dimensional analysis, and b) a pulse-based stochastic model for simulation of synthetic aquifer structures, to calculate the distribution of the absolute error in hydraulic head estimation as a function of the standardized distance from the nearest measuring locations. The resulting distributions are proved to encompass all possible small-scale structural dependencies, exhibiting characteristics (bounds, multi-modal features etc.) that can be explained using simple geometric arguments. The obtained results are promising, pointing towards the direction of establishing design criteria based on large-scale geologic maps.\n\nRole of dispersion corrected hybrid GGA class in accurately calculating the bond dissociation energy of carbon halogen bond: A benchmark study\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKosar, Naveen; Mahmood, Tariq; Ayub, Khurshid\n\n2017-12-01\n\nBenchmark study has been carried out to find a cost effective and accurate method for bond dissociation energy (BDE) of carbon halogen (Csbnd X) bond. BDE of C-X bond plays a vital role in chemical reactions, particularly for kinetic barrier and thermochemistry etc. The compounds (1-16, Fig. 1) with Csbnd X bond used for current benchmark study are important reactants in organic, inorganic and bioorganic chemistry. Experimental data of Csbnd X bond dissociation energy is compared with theoretical results. The statistical analysis tools such as root mean square deviation (RMSD), standard deviation (SD), Pearson's correlation (R) and mean absolute error (MAE) are used for comparison. Overall, thirty-one density functionals from eight different classes of density functional theory (DFT) along with Pople and Dunning basis sets are evaluated. Among different classes of DFT, the dispersion corrected range separated hybrid GGA class along with 6-31G(d), 6-311G(d), aug-cc-pVDZ and aug-cc-pVTZ basis sets performed best for bond dissociation energy calculation of C-X bond. ÏB97XD show the best performance with less deviations (RMSD, SD), mean absolute error (MAE) and a significant Pearson's correlation (R) when compared to experimental data. ÏB97XD along with Pople basis set 6-311g(d) has RMSD, SD, R and MAE of 3.14 kcal mol-1, 3.05 kcal mol-1, 0.97 and -1.07 kcal mol-1, respectively.\n\nAbsolute vs. relative error characterization of electromagnetic tracking accuracy\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMatinfar, Mohammad; Narayanasamy, Ganesh; Gutierrez, Luis; Chan, Raymond; Jain, Ameet\n\n2010-02-01\n\nElectromagnetic (EM) tracking systems are often used for real time navigation of medical tools in an Image Guided Therapy (IGT) system. They are specifically advantageous when the medical device requires tracking within the body of a patient where line of sight constraints prevent the use of conventional optical tracking. EM tracking systems are however very sensitive to electromagnetic field distortions. These distortions, arising from changes in the electromagnetic environment due to the presence of conductive ferromagnetic surgical tools or other medical equipment, limit the accuracy of EM tracking, in some cases potentially rendering tracking data unusable. We present a mapping method for the operating region over which EM tracking sensors are used, allowing for characterization of measurement errors, in turn providing physicians with visual feedback about measurement confidence or reliability of localization estimates. In this instance, we employ a calibration phantom to assess distortion within the operating field of the EM tracker and to display in real time the distribution of measurement errors, as well as the location and extent of the field associated with minimal spatial distortion. The accuracy is assessed relative to successive measurements. Error is computed for a reference point and consecutive measurement errors are displayed relative to the reference in order to characterize the accuracy in near-real-time. In an initial set-up phase, the phantom geometry is calibrated by registering the data from a multitude of EM sensors in a non-ferromagnetic (\"clean\") EM environment. The registration results in the locations of sensors with respect to each other and defines the geometry of the sensors in the phantom. In a measurement phase, the position and orientation data from all sensors are compared with the known geometry of the sensor spacing, and localization errors (displacement and orientation) are computed. Based on error thresholds provided by the\n\nSorption characteristics of cadmium in a clay soil of Mae Ku creek, Tak Province, Thailand\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nThunyawatcharakul, P.; Chotpantarat, S.\n\n2018-05-01\n\nMae Sot is a district in Tak province, the northern part of Thailand where has encountered with cadmium (Cd) contaminated in soils. Exposure of Cd can lead to severe health effect, for examples, bone softening, osteoporosis, renal dysfunction, and Itai-Itai disease. This study aims at elucidating sorption behavior of Cd in the contaminated soil collected from Mae Ku creek, Mae Sot district, Thailand. Batch sorption experiment was conducted in order to investigate sorption characteristics of Cd onto the contaminated soil. The soil sample taken from the study area consists of 26% sand, 16% silt 58% clay, which categorized as a clay soil, based on USDA classification. Soil pH is slightly alkaline (pHâ¼7.7) and organic matter in the soil is 2.93%. The initial concentration in the batch sorption experiment was in the range from 0- 200 ppm. The result from the batch sorption experiment showed that soil sample can adsorb Cd up to 173.5 ppm and the sorption behavior of the soil sample can be well described by Freundlich isotherm, indicating the multil"
