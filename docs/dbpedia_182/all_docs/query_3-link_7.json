        "meta_description": "The Algerian steppe is of great interest in terms of vegetation, mainly in the Naâma region. This steppe vegetation is generally composed of annual and perennial grasses and other herbaceous plants, as well as, bushes and small trees. It is characterized by an arid Mediterranean climate where the average annual precipitation (100 to 250 mm) is insufficient to ensure the maintenance of the vegetation, in which the potential evaporation always exceeds the precipitations. This aridity has strong hydrological effect and edaphic implications from which it is inseparable. Water losses are great than gains due to the evaporation and transpiration from plants (evapotranspiration). The wind moves soils for one location to another, and causes a strong evapotranspiration of the plants, which is explained by a strong chronic water deficit of climatic origin of these compared to the potential evapotranspiration, opposed to a humid climate. Evapotranspiration is certainly closely linked to climate factors (solar radiation, temperature, wind, etc.), but it also depends on the natural environment of the studied region. Potential evapotranspiration (PET) data estimated from Thornthwaite’s method for the three stations (Mécheria, Naâma and Ainsefra). The average annual value of potential evapotranspiration is of the order of 807 mm in Mécheria, of 795 mm in Naâma de and in Ainsefra of 847 mm. It is more than 3 times greater than the value of the rainfall received. This propels it globally in the aridity of the region and from which the water balance of plants is in deficit. The potential evapotranspiration of vegetation in arid areas is very important due to high temperature and sunshine. During the cold season, precipitation covers the needs of the potential evapotranspiration and allows the formation of the useful reserve from which the emergence of vegetation. From the month of April there is an exhaustion of the useful reserve which results of progressive deficit of vegetation. Faced with this phenomenon of evatranspiration, the steppe vegetation of the region then invests in “survival” by reducing the phenomena of evapotranspiration, photosynthetic leaf surfaces, in times of drought. These ecophysiological relationships can largely explain the adaptation of steppe species (low woody and herbaceous plants) to the arid Mediterranean climate. Mechanisms and diverse modalities were allowing them to effectively resist for this phenomenon. The adaptation of the steppe vegetation by the presence of a root system with vertical or horizontal growth or both and seems to depend on the environmental conditions, and by the reduction of the surface of transpiration, and by the fall or the rolling up of the leaves, and by a seasonal reduction of transpiration surface of the plant to reduce water losses during the dry season (more than 6 months) of the year. Some xerophytes produce “rain roots” below the soil surface, following light precipitation or during dew formation. Other persistent sclerophyllous species by which decreases transpiration by the hardness of the leaves often coated with a thick layer of wax or cutin.",

        "text": "2.1.3.1 Bioclimatic study\n\nAs part of our study, we took into consideration, as climatic parameters: rainfall and temperature because they represent the essential element of plant growth, soil formation and evolution. Several studies were carried out about the climate of steppe regions in Algeria [29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36].\n\nThe study of the climate and bioclimate is based on the automated processing of old meteorological data [29], taken over 25 years (1913–1938) and from the recent period (1990–2014). All data are collected from the National Meteorological Office (NMO) [37].\n\nPresentation of weather stations\n\nFrom a climatic point of view, the Naâma region inscribes its territorial limits on three distinct geographic natural domains:\n\nSteppe area (High Steppe Plains): it is covered by 2 meteorological stations: Naâma and Mécheria.\n\nAtlas area (Saharan Atlas): it is covered by a single meteorological station of Aïn Sefra (Table 1).\n\nPresentation of climate data\n\nStationLatitudeLongitudeAltitudeMécheria33° 31’ N00° 17’ W1149 mNaâma33° 16’ N00° 18’ W1166 mAïn Sefra32° 45’ N00° 36’ W1058 m\n\nTemperature and precipitation values are synthesized to determine climatic parameters for the entire study region by extrapolation.

The distribution of the average monthly rainfall during the periods 1913–1938 and 1990 to 2014 is presented as follows.\n\nTemperatures: Temperatures are an important component of plant life, especially the two extremes: The lowest average temperatures are in January for the three stations, while the highest averages are in July for the three stations (Table 3) according to data from NMO (Table 4) [37].\n\nStationPeriodJFMAMJJtASOXDMécheriaP1 (1913–1938)6,257,6010,7014,3017,6023,2027,7027,4522,6016,4010,106,65P2 (1990–2014)6,958,0611,3114,1222,9123,8727,9027,1222,0317,0111,017,54NaâmaP1 (1913–1938)————————————P2 (1990–2014)6,077,4911,1314,3518,9724,5628,6127,7922,6417,2010,667,13Ain sefraP1 (1913–1938)6,058,3510,7015,6519,4024,0528,4027,2023,7017,0510,606,90P2 (1990–2014)7,449,1212,6915,9520,6025,8429,5328,5323,8518,2411,908,29\n\nStationPeriodM (°C)m (°C)P (mm)MécheriaP1 (1913–1938)35,11,5293,0P2 (1990–2014)36,781,49243,1NaâmaP1 (1913–1938)///P2 (1990–2014)36,80,32218,7Aïn SefraP1 (1913–1938)37,6−0,3192,0P2 (1990–2014)38,340,57199,6\n\nCalculation of different climatic parameters\n\nDe Martonne aridity index: The aridity index is a quantitative indicator of the degree of water scarcity present in a given location. The De Martonne index is given by the formula below [38].\n\nI=R/T+10E1\n\nWhere: R = Average annual rainfall in mm and T = Annual average temperature in °C. When the index is low, the climate is more arid, and vice versa (Table 5).\n\nAridity index (I)Type of climateI < 5Hyper-arid climate5 < I < 7,5Desert climate7,5 < I < 10Steppe climate10 < I < 20Semi-arid climate20 < I < 30Mild climate\n\nCalculation of thermal continentality: The thermal continentality is given by the Debrach method [39]. It is distinguish four types of climates:\n\nIslander climate: M-m < 15°C,\n\nCoastal climate: 15 0C < M-m < 25°C,\n\nThe semi-continental climate: 25°C < M-m < 35°C;\n\nContinental climate: M-m > 35°C.\n\nWhere: M: average temperatures of the maximums of the hottest month. m: average minimum temperatures of the coldest month.\n\nSeasonal regime: The seasonal regime presents the seasonal variation: the sum of the seasonal rainfall of Winter, Spring, Summer and Autumn. According to Despois [40], the study of the rainfall regime is more instructive than comparing annual averages or totals.\n\nFor this purpose, we calculated the amount of rainfall for all the study stations, during the four seasons.\n\nAutumn (A): September, October, November\n\nWinter (W): December, January, February.\n\nSpring (Sp): March, April, May.\n\nSummer (S): June, July, August.\n\nClimate summary: Climate synthesis is based on the search for formulas that allow the action of several ecological factors to be reduced to a single variable. For this, several climatic indices, taking into account variables such as rainfall and temperatures, have been formulated for a synthetic expression of the regional climate.\n\nWe will retain the pluviometric quotient of Emberger [41, 42], which remains the most effective index in the description of the Mediterranean climate, the xerothermic index of Bagnouls and Gaussen [43] and thermal continentality and rain.\n\nSeveral methods and indices have been used in the climatic classification of the Mediterranean region, including the method of Bagnouls and Gaussen [43, 44] and that of Emberger [42].\n\nPluviothermal quotient: Emberger [42] proposed a pluviothermal quotient, which tells us about the xeric character of the vegetation and which takes into account temperatures and rainfall. The latter exercises a preponderant action for the definition of the global drought of the climate. Emberger’s quotient is specific to the Mediterranean climate. The quotient Q2 was calculated by the following formula [42]:\n\nQ2=2000R/M2−m2E2\n\nWhere: Q2: the pluvio-thermal quotient, R: Average annual rainfall in (mm), M: the average of the thermal maxima of the hottest month in Kelvin, m: the average of the thermal maxima of the coldest month in Kelvin. The Q2 allowed us to locate our weather stations on the Emberger climagram.\n\nBagnouls and Gaussen temperature diagram: The ombrothermal diagrams of Bagnouls and Gaussen make it possible to compare the evolution of the values of temperatures and precipitations. On this subject, Emberger specifies: “a climate can be meteorologically Mediterranean, possessing the characteristic Mediterranean pluviometric curve, without being so ecologically or biologically, if the summer drought is not accentuated”.\n\nThe study region is characterized by minimum temperatures between: - 0.3 and 2.12° C. Le Houérou et al. [45] consider that the Algerian steppes are surrounded by isotherms “m” - 2 and 6° C, and that M-m varies little and remains approximately equal to 32.6–37.9° C. These temperatures explain the absence of certain species whose life is linked to temperate winters.\n\n2.1.3.2 Methods for estimating evapotranspiration\n\nAs part of this work, evapotranspiration is calculated for the three meteorological stations in the Naâma region using the Thornthwaite method.\n\nThe Thornthwaite Method is an empirical formula for estimating potential evapotranspiration, relatively simple to implement, since it requires few data (average air temperatures, in particular). One of the drawbacks of the Thornthwaite method is its monthly time step for calculating potential evapotranspiration.\n\nCalculation of PET is done by applying Thornthwaite’s formula; it is a simple expression suitable for arid climate. This Thornthwaite Method is one of the most widely used formulas for the calculation of evapotranspiration is that of Thornthwaite [46].\n\nIt has been tested in several regions of Algeria and in the Mediterranean because it gives acceptable results.\n\nBy statistically fitting the results of experimental measurements of the PET to climatological data, Thornthwaite established a non-linear relationship between the mean monthly PET and the monthly mean temperature (Tm) expressed like this:\n\nPotential evapotranspiration: it is the consumption of water, under the combined action of the evaporation of water from the soil and the transpiration of the plant. For its estimation, methods based on climatic variables are used. However, the choice depends mainly on the type of climate data available and the type of climate in the region. However, ETP data for the three stations (Mécheria; Naâma, Ain Sefra) are estimated using the Thornthwaite method [46].\n\nETP=1610×T/IaKE3\n\nWhere PET: is the monthly potential evapotranspiration, expressed in mm T: the monthly average temperature of the month considered in degrees Celcius.\n\na: Coefficient given by the expression: a = 1.6 (I/100)+0.5.\n\nwhere the annual thermal index I is equal to the sum of the twelve values of the monthly thermal index: i = (T/5) 1.514 K: Correction coefficient, which depends on the latitude i: monthly thermal index I: Annual thermal index.\n\nI=∑m=112imim=T¯m51.514E4\n\nReal evapotranspiration (RET) or flow deficit: This is the quality of water that is actually evaporated or transpired by the soil, plants and free surfaces. The RET can be estimated by several methods; for our case we have chosen the Turkish formula [47]:\n\nETR=P0.9+PL2E5\n\nWhere: P: designates precipitation in mm.\n\nL: designates a constant dependent on the temperature with L = 300 + 25 T + 0.05 T3 andT: is the annual average temperature in °C.\n\nThe water balance by the Thornthwaite method\n\nIts purpose is to quantify the water transfers resulting from precipitation, and to characterize a soil from a dryness or humidity point of view.\n\nAccording to Thornthwaite, the water quality needed for a soil to be saturated is equivalent to a 100 mm depth of water, (this is the generally accepted useful reserve). Still according to Thornthwaite, one can establish a monthly hydrological balance during the period (1990–2014), which makes it possible to estimate for each month: the real evapotranspiration (RET)."
