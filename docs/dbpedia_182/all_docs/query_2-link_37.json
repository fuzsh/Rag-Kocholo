        "text": "Aim: This study was performed to determine the prevalence of bovine brucellosis in Medea region, Northern Algeria. Materials and Methods: The study was carried out on 495 non-vaccinated cattle, of which 280 (30 males and 250 females) belonged to 57 cattle farms and 215 cows were sampled at abattoirs of Medea. Sera collected from the cattle were tested using the Rose Bengal test and confirmed by histopathological analysis. Results: Serological examination revealed that 7/57 farms (12.28%) were infected, of which 7/280 (2.5%) cattle were seropositive. The prevalence in females and males was 2.4% (6/250) and 3.33% (1/30), respectively. No significant difference has been observed between females and males. Older animals (â‰¥8 years) were infected more. The prevalence of infection was 9.1%. Seroprevalence of Brucella infection in cows that have already had abortion was higher compared with non-aborted cows (4.34% and 2.20%, respectively). In abattoirs, a total of 25 (11.62%) seropositive cows were detected, and the histopathological analysis was positive in all these cows. Conclusion: The study indicates that brucellosis indeed exists in cattle in Medea and shows that the meat of slaughtered cattle tested positive for brucellosis may constitute a real risk of transmission to both butchery personnel and consumers, which requires that the meat of infected animals should be analyzed before being marketed.\n\nDespite the paucity of data, brucellosis is considered as a major problem in Algeria. The aim of present study was to assess the presence of bovine and ovine brucellosis in the areas close to the capital city (Algiers) where its vaccination is not implemented. A total of 402 cattle and 203 ovine sera were collected from two slaughterhouses, and examined by the Rose Bengal Test (RBT). Positive samples were then tested by Complement Fixation Test (CFT) and Hypertonic Double Gel Diffusion (DDG) with a smooth lipopolysaccharide, and the extract of native hapten was also tested by Indirect Enzyme Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay (iELISAs) with smooth lipopolysaccharide and polyclonal or protein G conjugates. Twenty-four bovine sera (5.97%) were RBT positive. Of these, 23 were positive in CFT, DDG, and 16 samples were also positive in iELISA when the assay was adjusted to 100% specificity. Only two ovine sera were RBT positive; one was CFT and DDG positive, and the other one had a CFT-titer of 1/4, and was DDG negative. This preliminary study confirmed that bovine brucellosis is a major problem in Algeria, and indicated that some field studies are needed to determine the prevalence of Brucellosis in Algeria urgently. Similarly, other studies are necessary in areas with dominance of ovine breeding system. Further studies in the areas with a dominance of ovine breeding system are necessary. The results of this work showed that simple tests like RBT and DDG are not outperformed by CFT or iELISA for assessing the apparent prevalence of brucellosis in the absence of vaccination. Finally, isolation and typing of the involved Brucella species are also necessary in order to have a complete epidemiological picture of brucellosis in Algeria.\n\nA serological study was carried out in Tiaret province in western Algeria on 1032 cows distributed in 95 flocks to estimate the prevalence of Brucella infection and to compare the sensitivity and specificity of a range of agglutination tests. Screening tests showed 31.5% of herds positive using the buffered plate antigen test and 26.3% using the rose Bengal test compared with 15.7% with the complement fixation test. Using the complement fixation test as the gold standard for confirmatory tests, the Rivanol test was found to be more sensitive but less specific than tube agglutination in detecting brucellosis infection. Three isolates were identified from 105 blood samples from humans with brucellosis and 50 samples of milk and tissues from infected cows and they were all Brucella melitensis biovar 3.\n\nThis study was conducted in Sinnar State. The objectives were to study the epidemiology of brucellosis, estimate its prevalence, and identify the endemic area in the seven localities of the State. Four hundred serum samples collected from cattle were divided as follows: 40 from adult males, 178 from heifers and 182 from cows. All samples were subjected to serological investigation using the Rose Bengal Plate test (RBPT). Competitive ELISA (cELISA) was used as a confirmatory test for the positive sera. The prevalence of brucella antibodies in the State was 6.5% with RBPT and 46.2% of these positive sera were confirmed as positive with cELISA. The highest prevalence was 39.1% in Singa locality when tested by RBPT, all these samples were confirmed positive with cELISA. It could be concluded that despite of its low prevalence, brucellosis constitutes a big problem in the State, which threats both animal and public health. Control measures should promptly commence and the spread of bovine brucellosis should be taken seriously.\n\nBrucellosis is a worldwide zoonotic disease which is now considered endemic in most parts of Egypt. A cross-sectional study was carried out from December 2018 to February 2020 to investigate the seroprevalence of brucellosis in humans and livestock residing in two regions located in New Valley Governorate, Egypt. A total of 1254 animals (673 cattle, 348 sheep, and 233 goats) and 523 human serum samples were examined for brucellosis using Rose Bengal test (RBT) and then randomly selected sera (15 from cattle, 7 from sheep, 3 from goats, and 45 from humans) were further analyzed by complement fixation test, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to compare and detect the sensitivity and specificity of RBT. The prevalence of brucellosis was 0% in cattle, sheep, and goats while it was 23.9% in humans using RBT. Concerning humans, there was a higher percentage of infection in EL Kharga (33.6%). The prevalence of this infection was also at a higher level among individuals aged above 40 years (28.57%). Furthermore, men (26.11%) were more inclined to be inflicted, compared to women (22.5%) with no significant difference. Considering the human occupation, abattoir workers were the most predominant group of people at risk (33.3%), followed by farmers (31.25%) and animal keepers (20.6%) while the lowest prevalence was demonstrated in the housewives where the prevalence was 18.8 %. As a result, risk factors of the age range, locality, time of infection, contact with animals, and occupational groups could significantly affect the prevalence of human brucellosis in the New Valley Governorate. In conclusion, brucellosis is an alarming problem among residents of the New Valley Governorate. Thus, reducing the prevalence in humans and animals in the region of study may include restriction of the marketing the raw milk and enhancing public health awareness.\n\nA cross-sectional seroprevalence study was conducted on cattle in the North and Adamawa Regions of Cameroon to investigate the status of bovine brucellosis and identify potential risk factors. The diagnosis was carried out using the Rose Bengal Plate test (RBPT) and indirect ELISA (i-ELISA), while questionnaires were used to evaluate risk factors for bovine brucellosis in cattle. The Bayesian approach was used to evaluate the diagnostic testsâ€™ sensitivity and specificity. The overall individual level (n=1031) and herd level (n=82) seroprevalence were 5.4% (0.4â€“10.5) and 25.6% (16.2â€“35.0), respectively. Bayesian analysis revealed sensitivity of 58.3% (26.4â€“92.7) and 89.6% (80.4â€“99.4) and specificity of 92.1% (88.7â€“95.2) and 95.7% (91.1â€“99.7) for RBPT and i-ELISA, respectively. Management related factors such as region, locality, herd size, and knowledge of brucellosis and animal related factors such as sex and age were significantly associated with seropositivity of brucellosis. Zoon...\n\nIntroduction: Brucellosis is one of the common zoonotic diseases that leading to the extensive economic losses throughout the world. Control and eradication of this disease depends mainly on the early detection. Aims: The present work was achieved between March and September 2016 as a cross-sectional study to determine the sero-prevalence of brucellosis in cattle. Materials and Methods: Three hundred eighty four sera samples which including 359 females and 25 males were collected randomly from unvaccinated cattle, in twelve different regions at Dhamar governorate in Yemen. All sera samples screened for cattle brucellosis using RBT and the positive samples reconfirmed using I-ELISA. A structured questionnaire used to collect epidemiological data that analyzed using SAS program. Results and Discussion: The sero-prevalence of cattle brucellosis was 0.26%. No significant association (P?0.05) between prevalence of cattle brucellosis and region (2.8%), age (3.22%), sex (0.27%) and breed (0.26%) was determined. Conclusion: Study findings showed a low prevalence of cattle brucellosis in Dhamar governorate. Although, the current work form a baseline data for more study of cattle brucellosis, and start point for its control in Yemen.
