        "text": "In recent decades, the rapid rise in population and built-up areas has had detrimental effects on the natural environment across various scales (Herold et al. 2005). Anthropogenic activities linked to urbanization degrade natural landscapes, particularly forests and grasslands, resulting in environmental issues such as increased air pollution and rising surface temperatures (Bayraktar et al. 2010; Yang et al. 2014; Nasehi et al. 2019). Furthermore, uncontrolled urban expansion leads to urban sprawl, adversely impacting environmental, economic, and social factors crucial for sustainable development (Nijman and Wei 2020; Shao et al. 2021). In this context, accurate information on the current and future state of urban expansion is crucial for decision makers due to the many complex factors affecting sustainable development (Yasin et al. 2020; Shao et al. 2021). Therefore, in recent years, there has been a significant increase in interest in the analysis of Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) changes, as well as future LULC modelling. Many researchers have focused on studying urban expansion using various techniques, as demonstrated by the study of Hamad et al. (2018); Asadi et al. (2022); Kisamba and Li (2022); and Mahmoudzadeh et al. (2022).\n\nChanges in LULC should be monitored regularly to analyse historical change trends and to demonstrate potential future urban expansion. Today, remote sensing techniques have proven highly effective in detecting changes caused by urban expansion. Over the past decades, this method, along with Geographical Information Systems (GIS), has been extensively applied in urban expansion research (Batisani and Yarnal 2009; Bagan and Yamagata 2012; Liu et al. 2022; Taiwo 2022). As high-resolution remote sensing imagery has become accessible, many researchers in the literature have used remotely sensed satellite imagery to map impervious surfaces (i.e., mostly artificial structure) (Yang and He 2017), assess the spatio-temporal pattern of urban expansion (Akintunde 2019; Zhong et al. 2020) and simulate future urban expansion (Aburas et al. 2017; Karimi et al. 2018). Talukder et al. (2022), used different supervised classifications, including random forest and machine learning algorithms, to map Landsat imagery from 2017 to 2020 to investigate LULC changes and rapid expansion of urban area in Tangail district of Bangladesh. Such findings on the expansion of urban areas are very important for urban planners to cope with rapid urbanisation locally.\n\nOne of the most important changes caused by LULC change and urban expansion is the increase of impervious surfaces and decrease of vegetation cover in the urban environment. Such landscape transformations also cause a significant change in Land Surface Temperature (LST). In a study done by Son and Thanh (2018), the impact of urban sprawl on the local temperature of Cantho city in Vietnam was investigated. Using Landsat data from 1996 to 2016 to map the built-up areas with Random Forest (RF), a ten-year assessment of the built-up area showed that the city has experienced significant expansion. In addition, it was shown that there was an increase of 0.8 °C in the average LST over the study period due to the conversion of open land to artificial surfaces due to urban expansion.\n\nUllah et al. (2020) analysed the effects of urban expansion on LST and vegetation cover in Xi’an, China, covering three decades (1987–2018). For this purpose, potential driving factors were analysed, and the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was used. The findings revealed a significant increase of 69.6% in urban areas over the last 30 years, accompanied by a decrease in vegetation cover from 2002 to 2018. By analysing the correlation between LST, urban area and NDVI, the study highlighted the impact of urban expansion on LST and concluded that vegetation cover can mitigate the negative effects of increasing temperature to some extent.\n\nUnderstanding, modelling, and projecting land dynamics at both the regional and global scales is essential due to the significant effects of LULC change and urban expansion (Islam and Ahmed 2011). In recent years, researchers have used different models to investigate future LULC changes, providing valuable insights for urban planners and policymakers to foster sustainable urban development (Hyandye and Martz 2017). Among these modelling techniques, Cellular Automata (CA) and Markov Chain (MC) have gained popularity (Ghosh et al. 2017). CA models are preferred for their ability to integrate spatial and temporal aspects of processes while MC models analyse the likelihood of land cover transformations (Santé et al. 2010; Moghadam and Helbich 2013). The MC model predicts future changes by analysing past trends, whereas CA focuses on the spatial characteristics of changes. Consequently, the CA-Markov model, integrating the strengths of both models, is considered a more efficient and effective tool for simulating such changes. Moreover, the successful integration of the CA-Markov model with remote sensing and GIS has led to its widespread use in geospatial environmental modelling within Earth sciences (Ghosh et al. 2017).\n\nNumerous studies have employed the CA-Markov model to assess and predict future LULC changes and urban expansion (Karimi et al. 2018; Novin and Ebrahimipour 2019; Mohamed and Worku 2020; Getu and Bhat 2022; Kumar et al. 2023). For instance, Hyandye and Martz (2017) applied the CA-Markov model in Tanzania’s Usangu Catchment, projecting an 8.2% increase in urban areas by 2020. They also observed a significant decrease in forestland and shrubs by 20% and 7%, respectively. Similarly, Kumar et al. (2023) addressed the rapid expansion of urban areas, predicting a 55% growth in urban areas by 2025, leading to substantial forest and vegetation loss. Aburas et al. (2021a) conducted a spatio-temporal simulation of Seremban’s future urban expansion in Malaysia. By simulating the 2010 map using LULC maps from 1990 to 2000, they were able to predict urban and non-urban area with an accuracy rate of 83%. The CA-Markov model was then used to forecast urban expansion for 2020 and 2030, demonstrating the applicability of the model in a variety of urban settings, particularly in developing countries. In research carried out by Kisamba and Li (2022), the urban expansion of Dodoma urban district in Tanzania was simulated using CA–Markov model. The LULC change analysis from 2005 to 2020 revealed a significant transformation of bare land and vegetation into built-up areas. The 2020 simulation was validated with the actual map of the same year, and projections for 2030 indicate a continued increase in built-up areas.\n\nWhile numerous studies in the literature predominantly focus on urban expansion at the city level, there is a notable lack of district-based analyses, particularly for dynamic megacities. Undertaking local-scale investigations at the district level offers a unique perspective, providing profound insights into the causes and consequences of urban expansion. These local analyses, in turn, provide valuable information that contributes to broader regional assessments at the city level (Habibi and Asadi 2011; Azabdaftari 2022; Azabdaftari and Sunar 2022).This lack of studies at the local scale, combined with the necessity to comprehend the complexities of megacity dynamics, is the main driving force behind our research. Our study aims to address this gap by using a prediction model specifically designed for urban expansion in the highly urbanized districts of Istanbul, Türkiye, and Sydney, Australia. Furthermore, we aim to demonstrate how modelling urban expansion at the district level can provide detailed insights, aiding urban planners and decision-makers in evaluating LULC Changes and their associated environmental impacts with greater detail and precision.\n\nFigure 3 shows the methodology used for modelling urban expansion in both districts selected in this study and will be described in more detail in the following sections. However, before performing the main image processing steps, pre-processing is necessary to address potential errors. These errors, which may affect the geometry or brightness values of the image, are usually introduced when data is captured by satellite sensors (Richards 1999). In this context, radiometric and geometric corrections have been applied as the first stage of image analysis to improve the quality and accuracy of satellite images, as reported in previous research (Azabdaftari and Sunar 2022).\n\nImage classification and accuracy assessment\n\nImage classification extracts LULC information from images, creating thematic maps by identifying distinct land covers through unique spectral signatures (Alshari and Gawali 2021). This study utilized the Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC), a widely employed supervised technique known for its accuracy between 80% and 90% (Bharath et al. 2017; Roy and Kasemi 2021). MLC assigns pixels to classes based on maximum likelihood statistics (Richards 1999). Applying MLC, LULC maps for 1997, 2007, and 2017 in Arnavutköy and 1996, 2007, and 2018 in Hills Shire were generated. In Arnavutköy, identified classes include built-up area, agricultural area, forest, barren land, and wetland. Likewise, Hills Shire exhibits the five classes: built-up area, agricultural area, forest, quarry, and water bodies (Azabdaftari and Sunar 2022).\n\nAccuracy assessment, a critical post-classification step, compares classified images with reference data. In Arnavutköy, overall accuracy rates were 91%, 86%, and 88% for 1997, 2007, and 2017, respectively. Similarly, Hills Shire LGA showed rates of 92%, 95%, and 91% for 1996, 2007, and 2018, respectively (Azabdaftari and Sunar 2022).\n\nChange detection\n\nThe aim of change detection analysis, which is the process of monitoring the changes that occur in a given area over time, is to understand the characteristics, rate, spatial pattern and underlying causes of these changes (Sunar et al. 2017). The widely employed post-classification comparison method in this context involves analyzing two classified images. To assess changes in LULC classes for the Arnavutköy district (1997–2017) and the Hills Shire LGA (1996–2018), transition matrices were calculated by comparing thematic maps from different years within the study period (Azabdaftari and Sunar 2022).\n\nLand surface temperature\n\nThe Land Surface Temperature (LST) was retrieved using the land surface temperature algorithm, as detailed in a prior article (Azabdaftari and Sunar 2022). Additionally, for a more comprehensive insight into the impact of urban expansion on the LST of the study areas over time, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was computed using the following formula.\n\n$$NDVI\\; = \\;(NIR\\; - \\,R)\\;/\\;(NIR\\; + \\;R)$$\n\n(1)\n\nwhere NIR is the near-infrared band, and R is the red band. These indices have characteristic values between − 1 and 1 (Morshed et al. 2020).\n\nUrban modelling\n\nUrban modeling plays a pivotal role in urban planning, offering insights into city evolution over time (Batty 1976, 2013; Epstein 2008; Crooks and Heppenstall 2012). Simulations become necessary to observe urban systems as cities progress, with GIS integration revolutionizing the field as a key tool for analyzing changes (Su 1998).\n\nVarious modeling methods are widely used in the literature for future prediction, including CA, MC, and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Each method has its own pros and cons; however, integrated models have consistently shown higher accuracy. Specifically, the CA-Markov model is the most commonly used approach among integrated models in the literature and is also employed in this study (Guan et al. 2011; Al-sharif and Pradhan 2014; Durmusoglu and Tanriover 2017; Hamad et al. 2018; Aburas et al. 2021).\n\nThe CA-Markov model combines the spatial analysis capabilities of Cellular Automata with the statistical strength of Markov chains, offering a robust tool for urban expansion prediction (Abdelkarim 2023; Roushangar et al. 2023). This model is particularly effective at managing spatial interactions and incorporating probabilistic transitions, making it superior for detailed, district-level planning. In contrast, employing only Markov chains lacks spatial considerations as they process transitions independently of location, while Cellular Automata alone do not include probabilistic components, potentially disregarding important patterns in land use changes (Lihawa et al. 2022). The ANN models, although capable of handling complex patterns, face challenges like high complexity and computational demands, making them less suitable for large-scale urban planning. A comparative study by Asadi et al. (2022), demonstrated that while the ANN models were slightly more precise in smaller, fragmented regions such as soil and rocks, the CA-Markov model was more effective at predicting larger, continuous urban areas. Hence, the CA-Markov model is preferred for urban expansion modelling due to its effectiveness in urban contexts.\n\nFurther, the accuracy of CA-Markov model in urban simulation is well-documented. For instance, Aburas et al. (2021) reported an 83% accuracy rate using the CA-Markov model in Seremban, Malaysia. Kisamba and Li (2022) achieved a Kappa index over 0.75 in Dodoma, Tanzania. Aliani et al. (2019) in Thales County also highlighted the model’s proficiency in urban land use change prediction, with an overall simulation success rate estimated at 82.2%. These studies underscore the CA-Markov model’s effectiveness in accurately simulating urban growth and land-use changes.\n\nCellular automata\n\nCellular Automata is a discrete and dynamic system where local interactions between components lead to global changes in space and time (Batty 1976; Wolfram 2002; Yacoubi 2008).\n\nA CA is also defined as quadruple;\n\n$$A =\\left(\\mathcal{L},\\mathcal{ }S, N, f\\right)$$\n\n(2)\n\nwhere; \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) represent a d-dimensional arrangement of cells, organized according to their spatial dimensions and cell shape, N defines the cell’s neighbourhood, f is transition function that computes the state of cell at time t + 1 based on the state of neighbourhood at time t.\n\nIn CA, either discrete or continuous, cells serve as storage units with various state variables. These variables are simultaneously updated at each time step according to “transition rules,” considering the neighboring cells’ values from the previous step. This rule applies uniformly to all grid cells, and the new state of each cell is stored in a separate grid to facilitate the transition process (Wolfram 1984; Chopard and Droz 1998; Breckling et al. 2011).\n\nAs stated in the study of Czaran and Bartha (1992), transition rules can take on either a stochastic or predictable nature, as expressed in the following equation:\n\n$${a}_{t+1}^{s}=f\\left({a}_{t}^{s-1},\\dots ,{a}_{t}^{s},\\dots ,{a}_{t}^{s+r}\\right)$$\n\n(3)\n\nwhere, \\({a}_{t}^{s}\\) is the state of cell s at time t, r is the neighbourhood range of the cell and f is the transition function that represents the transition rules.\n\nCA accurately models dynamic and spatial processes as it focuses on how cells interact with changing features in time and space. Furthermore, its compatibility with GIS leads researchers to utilize CA in LULC simulations, yielding realistic spatial structure models (White and Engelen 2000; Ye and Bai 2008; Sang et al. 2011).\n\nMarkov chain model\n\nA Markov Chain or Markov process is a mathematical model used to describe the progression of a system from one state to another. It predicts sequences of events where the probability of each event is influenced by the previous event (Muller and Middleton 1994; Seneta 2006).\n\nIn a Markov sequence consisting of X0, X1, X2,…,Xm random variables in a state space (S1, S2,…, Sn), the Markov Chain can be expressed as:\n\n$$P({X_n}\\; = \\;{S_n}\\;\\left| {{X_{n - 1}}\\; = \\;{S_{n - 1}})\\; = \\;P({X_n}\\; = \\;{S_n}} \\right.$$\n\n$$\\;\\left| {{X_0}\\; = \\;{S_0},{X_1}\\; = {S_1},\\;...\\;,} \\right.{X_{n - 1}}\\; = \\;{S_{n - 1}})$$\n\n(4)\n\nMarkov Chain analysis generates probability maps and a matrix known as the transition probability matrix, containing details about the probabilities of transitioning from one state to another (Iacono et al. 2015; Hamad et al. 2018).\n\nA transition matrix is a tool that details the probabilities of transitioning between states. If Pt is considered as transition matrix of Markov Chain at time t, with the rows and columns of the matrix in the state space S (Ye and Bai 2008), the (i, j)th element of the matrix Pt can be expressed as:\n\n$${ \\left({P}_{t}\\right)}_{i,j}=P({X}_{t+1}=j|{X}_{t}=i)$$\n\n(5)\n\nEquation 5 indicates that each row of the matrix is a probability vector and the sum of its inputs is equal to 1. In conclusion, Markov Chain analysis analysis offers insights into the probability of state changes by creating probability maps and this transition matrix.\n\nCA-Markov model\n\nThe CA-Markov model seamlessly integrates CA and MC modules, enhancing its capabilities beyond the individual strengths of each model. This integration effectively addresses the limitations associated with using a single model, as it combines the dynamic simulation features of CA with the statistical approach of MC. Consequently, the integrated CA-Markov model is widely used as a more robust and efficient technique for simulating various scenarios (Alkheder et al. 2006; Guan et al. 2011; Akin et al. 2014; Durmusoglu and Tanriover 2017; Hyandye and Martz 2017; Roushangar et al. 2023).\n\nPrediction of future LULC dynamics\n\nTo predict future LULC changes and urban expansion in any region using CA-Markov modelling, four key inputs are required: (i) LULC maps (generated from satellite image classification), (ii) suitability maps (created through Multi Criteria Evaluation (MCE)), (iii) transition area matrix (developed using the MC model), and (iv) a contiguity filter (the standard 5 × 5 filter).\n\nMulti criteria evaluation\n\nMCE is a decision-making methodology that evaluates alternatives based on multiple criteria to determine the optimal choice (Kilic and Kaya 2015). In the context of CA-Markov modelling for suitability maps in urban planning and development analysis (Eastman 2012; Hyandye and Martz 2017), the MCE process involves four sequential steps:\n\nCriteria Identification and Development: Various factors and constraints are combined to create a suitability map, with constraints limiting development in specific areas, and factors influencing suitability through their appropriateness (Eastman 2006; Drobne and Lisec 2009).\n\nCriteria Standardization: Different factors, each with unique scales and units, are standardized using methods like fuzzy functions, translating criteria into a common scale (0–1 or 0-255) indicative of suitability levels (Alkema et al. 2014).\n\nCriteria Weighting: After standardization, weights are assigned to each criterion to determine its relative importance in comparison to others, with available methods including equal weights, user-defined weights, and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP); for this study, the user-defined method was employed.\n\nWeighted Criteria Combination: Using the Weighted Linear Combination (WLC) method, this step aggregates the standardized, weighted factors, multiplying each criterion’s value by its weight and summing these to create a composite map (Eastman 2003).\n\nModel validation\n\nTo assess the model’s simulation capability, the simulated map is compared with a reference map using K-indices (Kno, KLocation, KLocationStrata, and KStandard), assessing overall and location-specific accuracy (Pontius Jr and Millones 2011). Kappa values, ranging from 0 to 1, indicate similarity, with values below 0.4 suggesting low accuracy, 0.4 to 0.75 indicating moderate accuracy, and above 0.75 representing high agreement (Pontius Jr and Millones 2011; Wang et al. 2011; Hamad et al. 2018; Qiu and Lu 2018). This study set a Kappa value of at least 0.75 as the acceptable level of agreement.\n\nTemporal trends in LST\n\nIn the analysis, temporal trends in LST for two distinct regions – the Arnavutköy district and the Hills Shire LGA were derived, providing a clear depiction of how LST varies over time in each area. In addition, the distribution of LST ranges as a percentage of the total study area was calculated for both regions (Figs. 4 and 5).\n\nThe LST findings for the Arnavutköy district, as depicted in Fig. 4, reveal a remarkable temporal trend over the 20-year period. In 1997, the majority of the region (68%) exhibited an LST below 25°C, with residential areas ranging between 26 and 28°C. By 2007, a significant temperature increase is observed, particularly in the higher temperature ranges (29–31°C). The highest LST values observed in the northern parts of the region, particularly in 2017, are likely attributed to the construction of Istanbul Airport and the associated building development, contributing to the overall temperature increase in the region. This discernible change is evident in the LST range higher than 32°C, which escalated from only 0.1% in 1997 to 29% in 2007 and further to 50% in 2017. As of 2017, this proportion covers more than half of the study area, indicating a substantial warming trend in the region.\n\nIn the Hills Shire LGA, illustrated in Fig. 5, a substantial LST increase occurred over the study period. In 1996, 62% of settlements experienced LST values within 24–28°C, diminishing notably to 42% by 2007. By 2018, a shift was evident, with 52% recording LSTs in the 29–33°C range and 45% exceeding 34°C. This shift indicates a noteworthy distribution change toward higher temperatures. In conclusion, the analyses affirm a significant rise in regions with the highest temperatures over the twenty-year period, notably in the > 34°C range.\n\nTo better understand the impact of urban expansion over the study period, mean LST and mean NDVI were calculated for both built-up and non-built-up areas in each study area. The results for Arnavutköy district and Hills Shire LGA are presented in Fig. 6.\n\nFigure 6 illustrates that, in Arnavutköy district across all measured years, built-up areas consistently displayed higher mean LST values compared to non-built-up areas. Additionally, the mean NDVI in built-up areas declined from 0.10 in 1997 to 0.07 in 2007, indicating a transformation from vegetated to non-vegetated areas during this period. Notably, the reduction in the mean NDVI value in 2007 was also evident in non-built-up areas, potentially attributed to the formation of small wetlands due to mining activities. In 2017, a significant decline in the vegetation class was observed, likely attributed to the rapid construction of the Istanbul Airport (Akyürek et al. 2018).\n\nMoreover, Fig. 6 clearly demonstrates a gradual increase in the mean LST trend in both built-up and non-built-up areas of the Hills Shire LGA. Meanwhile, the mean NDVI values have declined from 1996 to 2018, although this change trend is not as abrupt or sharp as observed in the Arnavutköy district. The observed temporal trend changes in both districts confirm that urban expansion, resulting in a reduction of vegetated areas, had a substantial impact on LST values throughout the study period.\n\nPrediction of future LULC dynamics\n\nTo predict future land use dynamics and urban expansion using CA-Markov modelling, essential inputs include LULC maps from satellite image classification, suitability maps via MCE, a transition area matrix from the MC model, and a 5 × 5 contiguity filter. The modelling process conducted using the IDRISI Selva software, which is specifically designed for spatial analysis.\n\nLULC maps\n\nThe LULC maps were generated for 1997, 2007, and 2017 in Arnavutköy and 1996, 2007, and 2018 in Hills Shire using an ML classification algorithm, with detailed results reported in a previous study by Azabdaftari and Sunar (2022).\n\nSuitability maps via multi criteria evaluation\n\nArnavutköy’s suitability maps were created to simulate the 2017 LULC map using data from 1997 to 2007, while Hills Shire LGA’s suitability maps were generated to simulate the 2018 LULC map based on data from 1996 to 2007. In generation of LULC suitability maps, various factors influencing changes across all LULC classes were considered with specific attention to constraints, particularly in built-up areas, within the framework of urban expansion. In this study, MCE analysis was conducted on the predominant LULC classes—built-up, agricultural, and forest areas—which collectively constitute the majority of both study areas.\n\nUrban development is influenced by several factors, including proximity to existing built-up areas and transportation networks, as well as topographical conditions such as such as terrain characteristics. Data from 2007 indicate that areas closer to existing infrastructure are more suitable for development, while regions with high elevations and steep slopes are less suitable due to the challenges they pose for construction and infrastructure.\n\nAdditionally, soil maps, highlighting different soil types, play a crucial role in determining agricultural land suitability. These maps provide vital information on the dominant soil types and their properties, which help assess land appropriateness for farming, planning, and environmental protection. The suitability for agriculture diminishes as the slope increases, thus impacting the potential for agricultural development.\n\nProximity to existing forests is a key factor determining forest suitability, as areas near existing forests are more likely to develop into forested areas. This relationship, along with elevation and slope, varies between locations; higher elevations decrease forest potential in Arnavutköy but increase it in Hills Shire. Initially, slope was considered a critical factor in the forest suitability analysis for both locations, but iterative MCE analysis revealed it was only significant for Arnavutköy, leading to its exclusion as a factor in Hills Shire LGA. All the factors considered for both districts are listed in Tables 2 and 3.\n\nBesides the factors, specific constraints restricting urban expansion were chosen for Arnavutköy district (existing built-up area, protected areas, watershed protection areas, and wetlands) and Hills Shire LGA (existing built-up area, protected areas, and watershed protection areas).\n\nAfter identifying the factors, the next step involved standardization. The factors were converted to a continuous scale (0 to 255) using fuzzy functions and control points that determine the fuzzy functions as monotonically increasing, decreasing or symmetrical as detailed in Tables 2 and 3. Most factors were standardized using monotonically increasing or decreasing sigmoidal functions, which are known for their gradual transitions and are commonly employed in fuzzy set theory. Examining historical change trends, each factor was iteratively weighted to determine its significance. Through repeated testing, optimal weights were determined, as outlined in Table 4. Notably, standardization and weighting applied to factors, excluding constraints represented as a Boolean map (0 and 1).\n\nSuitability maps for the minor LULC classes were generated by marking areas where they were present as suitable and areas where they were absent as unsuitable. These suitability maps were then standardized using an increasing sigmoidal fuzzy function. In Arnavutköy, barren land (3.73%) and wetland (0.78%) were identified as most suitable, standardized with an increasing sigmoidal fuzzy function. Likewise, in Hills Shire LGA, quarry (0.22%) and water (1.20%), with smaller coverage, were similarly identified and standardized.\n\nTransition area matrix from the MC model\n\nTo create transition area matrices depicting expected changes between categories within each study area, Markov Chain analysis was conducted using two images (an initial t-1 image and a subsequent t image). For the 2017 LULC modelling in Arnavutköy district, the 1997 LULC map served as the initial image (t-1), and the 2007 LULC map served as the subsequent image (t). Similarly, for the 2018 LULC modelling in Hills Shire LGA, the 1996 LULC map was used as the first image (t-1), and the 2007 LULC map was used as the second image (t). Tables 5 and 6 present the transition area matrices for each study area, respectively. In the transition area matrix, off-diagonal elements indicate the pixels changing for each class, while diagonal elements show pixels remaining constant.\n\nIn Table 5, the largest transformation in Arnavutköy district was from forest to agricultural area, involving 34,261 pixels. The most significant change to built-up area was from agricultural land, accounting for 26,934 pixels between 1997 and 2007. According to Table 6, in Hills Shire LGA, the greatest change, involving 21,560 pixels, was from forest to built-up area between 1996 and 2007, with agricultural areas also experiencing significant transformation into built-up land.\n\nContiguity filtering\n\nIn the final step, a 5 × 5 standard contiguity filter was used in the CA-Markov model to define neighbourhoods for each land cover class cell. Proximity to the current land use category assigned higher suitability to nearby pixels. For distant pixels in each LULC class, suitability was reduced, prioritizing neighbouring areas.\n\nSimulated LULC maps by CA-Markov model\n\nBy integrating all input data acquired in preceding processing steps, LULC maps were simulated using the CA-Markov model. Figures 7 and 8 show the simulated LULC maps for Arnavutköy district in 2017 and Hills Shire LGA in 2018. Additionally, area statistics for both the actual and simulated maps of Arnavutköy district and Hills Shire LGA were computed, aiding in the evaluation of simulation accuracy and the detection of any changes. The outcomes of this analysis are presented in Tables 7 and 8.\n\nThe findings presented in Fig. 7; Table 7 indicate that the model is generally effective in capturing the spatial arrangement and distribution of most LULC categories, such as agricultural areas and forests. However, minor discrepancies in the area sizes between the simulated and actual LULC maps, particularly an underestimation in the built-up class, are observed. A significant factor contributing to this discrepancy is the construction of Istanbul Airport, initiated in 2015. Since the CA-Markov model bases its simulations on transition matrices from earlier (1997) and later (2007) dates, it could not anticipate specific changes, such as the airport construction in 2015.\n\nConversely, as seen in Fig. 8, the simulated LULC map for Hills Shire LGA, showing the spatial distribution of LULC categories, aligns consistently with the actual LULC map. The statistics presented in Table 8 further validate this alignment, indicating that the area sizes of each class in the simulated LULC map of 2018 closely match those in the actual map, with minor deviations considered acceptable.\n\nModel validation\n\nTo ensure the accuracy and reliability of predictions generated through simulations, model validation was undertaken. This involved comparing the simulated 2017 LULC map of Arnavutköy district with the actual 2017 map, and similarly, evaluating the simulated 2018 map of Hills Shire LGA against the actual 2018 map. Model validation results for both areas are detailed in Table 9.\n\nThe validation results, as presented in Table 9 and ranging from 0.81 to 0.88, demonstrate a strong agreement across all validation factors for both the Arnavutköy district and Hills Shire LGA. Although slightly better in Hills Shire, overall, the results show the remarkable robustness of CA-Markov model predictions.\n\nProjection of LULC map for the year 2050\n\nIn order to project the LULC map for the year 2050 for both study areas, the same process was applied as in simulating the 2017 and 2018 LULC maps. In this context, in the first step, suitability maps for each LULC class were generated using the weights derived from simulations of the 2017 Arnavutköy district map and the 2018 Hills Shire LGA map. In the next step, the Markov Chain transition area matrix (i.e., 2007–2017 transition area matrix for Arnavutköy district and 2007–2018 transition area matrix for Hills Shire LGA) was calculated for each area to create the 2050 LULUC map as shown in Fig. 9.\n\nTo assess future LULC changes and urban expansion, a comparison was made between the area statistics of the 2017 map for Arnavutköy district (Table 10) and the 2018 map for Hills Shire LGA (Table 11) with those of the projected 2050 LULC map.\n\nTable 10 shows a projected 44% growth in the built-up area, expanding from 9,836 hectares in 2017 to 14,260 hectares in 2050. The primary expansion is expected towards the north, near the Istanbul Airport, and in areas close to major road networks. Urban expansion is also foreseen near existing built-up regions, aligning with a disaggregated pattern observed in similar trends of urban expansion reported by Aburas et al. (2021). The 2050 LULC model predicts minimal changes in agricultural areas over 33 years, while forest areas are expected to decline by approximately 26%. Additionally, there is a projected decrease in wetlands (8%) and barren land (19%). The substantial loss of forest, partly due to the construction of Istanbul Airport, is likely to significantly influence urban expansion patterns and serve as a major factor contributing to overall forest degradation.\n\nTable 11 indicates significant changes in the urban land use of Hills Shire LGA. The built-up area is projected to increase by approximately 51%, expanding northward in line with future development and transport network improvements. Additionally, urban expansion is expected to primarily occur in already developed areas. The forested regions are projected to decrease significantly, with a loss of about 6,000 hectares between 2018 and 2050, equating to a 30% reduction over 32 years. Quarry and water areas are expected to remain relatively stable, while the agricultural area is anticipated to follow a trend similar to that of the Arnavutköy district, with no significant changes."
