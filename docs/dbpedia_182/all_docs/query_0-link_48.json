        "text": "Abstract\n\nThe most interesting factors associated with seed and cone production of Aleppo pine were largely reviewed to identify broad patterns and potential effectiveness of reforestation efforts and planning. Aleppo pine cone production and seed yields are relatively variable, with differences between spatial and temporal influences. These differences are considered, mainly between (i) year, (ii) stand characteristics and (iii) individual tree measurements. Annual variability among populations was recorded for cone production per tree, based on influencing factors such as genetic characteristics, wetness, nutrient availability, insect pests and disease. In addition, some factors may affect Aleppo pine tree growth directly but may be affecting seed and cone production indirectly. Therefore, reduced stand density results in less competition among Aleppo pine trees and accompanying understory flora, which subsequently increases the stem diameter and other tree dimensions, including seed production. This review suggests that reforestation planning, particularly thinning, will result in improved tree morphology that will increase Aleppo pine seed and cone crops. Wildfire intensity and stand conditions such as light and soil nutrient status are also examined.\n\nIntroduction\n\nAleppo pine (Pinus halepensis Mill.) is a native Mediterranean and North African indigenous species (Krugman and Jenkinson 1974). This species constitutes the natural widespread Pinus forests in the Mediterranean region (Quezel 2000, Nathan and Ne'eman 2004). During the last few decades, an historical Mediterranean reforestation effort of Aleppo pine has shown a wide and important rise in its forest densities (Matziris 1997, Bladé and Vallejo 2008, Rigolot et al. 2012). This has resulted in an emphasis towards restoration of P. halepensis forests to avoid wildfires, to re-establish stands and to promote associated wildlife (Sirois 2000, Bladé and Vallejo 2008, Moya et al. 2008). The Aleppo pine is the most abundant Pinus species in eastern Spain, northern Algeria and Tunisia, but is dominated by other coniferous species in other areas of the Mediterranean region (Nahal 1962, Quezel 2000). This species (P. halepensis) is of interest in Tunisia because its cones provide the only appropriate seed source used for many human and forestry purposes (Sghaier et al. 1997, Nasri et al. 2004, Khouja et al. 2006, Sghaier and Ammari 2012).\n\nRecent research has indicated that large-diameter trees of P. halepensis are more seed and cone productive than trees with smaller diameter (Ayari et al. 2012a). Reforestation efforts in Mediterranean countries have focused on several coniferous species, of which Aleppo pine is the main species used for recent plantations. Pinus halepensis does not occur in the North African arid zone, but small reforestation efforts by plantations were started in the last 50 years, which have required considerable investment. The main objectives of such efforts were to limit desertification and to re-establish the native flora and fauna (Middleton and Thomas 1997, Goberna et al. 2007). In Tunisia, many research teams have promoted and initiated restoration of P. halepensis forests (DGF 1995, 2010) and have started documenting the effects of restoration on the innovative status of the forest ecosystem (Touchan et al. 2008, Jeddi et al. 2009).\n\nBecause of the minimal benefits of current plantation efforts for food-seed producing species, such as P. halepensis (Ayari et al. 2012c), Pinus pinaster and Pinus pinea, this review focuses on what is known about cone production in P. halepensis in order to determine possible innovations to promote improved seed production.\n\nStudy species\n\nSpecies world distribution\n\nNatural discontinuous bands and large geographical distributions of Aleppo pine were recorded in the Mediterranean region (Figure 1), covering ∼3.5 million hectares (Quezel 1986). Aleppo pine forests range from southern France (45°N) to northeastern Palestine (31°30′N) and from the southwest high Atlas region of Morocco (9°E) to Lebanon, Syria and Jordan in the east (36°E). In the Mediterranean basin, natural Aleppo forests grow at elevations ranging from sea level to 2600 m above sea level, as confirmed in Morocco (Khouja et al. 2000, Boulli et al. 2001, Ayari et al. 2012b). During the 19th century, P. halepensis was also introduced to the USA, Australia, Venezuela and South Africa (Hall et al. 1997, Gibbs et al. 1999, Spencer 2001, Hokche et al. 2008). The Aleppo pine habitat is broadly characterized by warm and cold winters, in addition to dry summers with periods of prolonged drought. Annual precipitation of the Aleppo pine forest zone within the Mediterranean region ranges from 200 to 1500 mm with an optimal species spreading range from 350 to 750 mm (Quezel 1986).\n\nReproductive cycle\n\nIn its natural habitat and at an early growth stage from 4 to 18 years, seeds and cones of P. halepensis trees in the Mediterranean region are initiated in mid- to late summer and differentiate in September to October (Krugman and Jenkinson 1974, Owens and Blake 1985). Pollination occurs from April to June the following year (Floret and Pontanier 1982, Khouja 1997), which is when pollen tube and ovule expansion starts and proceeds until mid-summer (Gorenflot 1992, Roland et al. 1997). Reproductive expansion proceeds the following spring when fertilization occurs under favourable conditions (Mugnozza 1986, Climent et al. 2008). This lengthy reproductive cycle (∼3 years) from embryo initiation to seed maturity (shown in Figure 2) requires a complex range of interacting factors that influence the quantity and quality of cones and seeds produced by mature P. halepensis trees (Aussenac et al. 1982, Owens and Blake 1985). However, Aleppo pine physiological performance differences are not apparent in the published literature relating vegetative growth and reproduction traits to physiological tree status, mainly among ecological regions and provenances.\n\nSeed and cone production variability\n\nAleppo seed cone production is variable, with three factors that contribute to the variability: (i) years with or without abundant fructification (Moya et al. 2008); (ii) stand characteristics; and (iii) individual tree dimensions (Goubitz et al. 2004, Moya et al. 2008, Ayari et al. 2011a, 2012a). Several years of reports have documented years with abundant seed and cone production and others years with insignificant production (Tapias et al. 2001, Moya et al. 2008). Across its Mediterranean range, abundant Aleppo pine seed and cone crops take place about every 3–5 years (Climent et al. 2008, Paula et al. 2009, DGF 2010, Espelta et al. 2011). Variability in seed and cone production (Table 1) within an Aleppo pine forest has been frequently reported (Ne'eman and Izhaki 1999, Goubitz et al. 2004, Ayari et al. 2011b). Within the same Aleppo pine forest stand, seed and cone production variability among individual trees can also be significant, with specific trees being noted as massive producers (Climent et al. 2008, Ayari et al. 2012b). Across its natural Mediterranean distribution range, Climent et al. (2008) observed that Aleppo pine trees have an increasing reproductive allocation from east (Greece) to west (Spain), with a smaller increase from north to south (Tunisia).\n\nRegulation of seed and cone production\n\nThe 3 year development of a mature Aleppo pine cone provides numerous opportunities for a major maternal role in seed and cone production through interactions between the ovule and pollen to produce the diploid embryo, which is sometimes aborted (Gorenflot 1992). However, Aleppo pine cone production can be decreased by pests, such as insects or other vectors (Goubitz et al. 2002, Climent et al. 2008), where previous research showed that the cone abortion rate for the species ranges from 40 to 60% (Girard et al. 2012). The volume of the mature cones depends on environmental conditions and pine tree size (Ayari et al. 2012a), where larger cone sizes and a higher number of sound cones correlate with higher seed quality (Nathan et al. 1999, Moya et al. 2008). Years with abundant cone production are also excellent years for sound and filled seed yields (Goubitz et al. 2004, Climent et al. 2008). Conversely, Aleppo pine under stressed environmental conditions, such as limited nutrient resources (Climent et al. 2008), severe drought (Ayari et al. 2011a, 2011c) or cold winters (Vennetier et al. 2011), produce low seed yields. In fact, the extremely low seed yields are due to high cone abortion rates (Ne'eman et al. 2011) at early stages of cone growth, and later to low cone survival rates (Girard et al. 2012). Tree morphology is also important for successful fruiting, because the most abundant cones were observed at the top and next in the middle of the tree crown (Ayari et al. 2012a, Girard et al. 2012). Under poor weather conditions, high cone abortion rates have been reported in the top and middle crown positions due to a direct influence on flowering or pre-initiated cone buds (Girard et al. 2012). An adaptive shift of vegetative growth or reproductive bud initiation can be employed during times of physiological stress, which further explains these trends. Similarly, Aleppo pine embryo abortions rates reflect several interacting factors associated with pollination, such as climate stress and stand density added to tree health (Owens and Blake 1985, Karlsson and Orlander 2002).\n\nFactors affecting cone crops\n\nClimate-related factors\n\nAnnual rainfall and forest wetness\n\nLittle information was found on the influences of annual rainfall and moisture on seed and cone production of Aleppo pine, as well as for other coniferous species (Owens and Blake 1985, Pardos et al. 2003). Recent research work showed a positive correlation with the average precipitation recorded during the 3 years of Aleppo pine cone development (Ayari et al. 2011c). Subsequent research reported positive effects of the average 3-year rainfall on seed number and seed mass per cone (Ayari et al. 2012b). Furthermore, previous physiological findings (El-Aouni 1980, Climent et al. 2008) showed that Aleppo pine vegetative growth and reproductive features depend on ecophysiological patterns and resource allocation. Thus, abundant fructification in Tunisia was observed in wet years, whereas a reduced rate was recorded in dry years, such as in 1993 (Khouja 1997). Similarly, poor resources favour an early reproduction while abundant resources enhance vegetative growth (Climent et al. 2008). During times of water stress, nutrients and water are often preferentially diverted to cone bud initiation, whereas formation of new roots, bark, needles and wood is limited due to the lack of nutrients and water (Forest Products Laboratory 1987). Similar patterns of seed and cone production were noted with other Pinus species by comparing the effects of temperature, rainfall and sunlight days on cone bud initiation under conditions of limited soil resources (Dewers and Moehring 1970, Owens and Blake 1985, Pardos et al. 2003).\n\nTemperature influences\n\nAnnual cone and seed crops are associated with temperature during the Aleppo pine fruiting cycle (Pardos et al. 2003, Girard et al. 2012), as long as other environmental conditions are favourable and nutrients are available (Thanos and Daskalakou 2000, Climent et al. 2008, Saunders et al. 2012). Aleppo pine trees in Mediterranean countries have maintained normal growth and other physiological processes despite warming and drying across the whole region (Brochiero et al. 1999, Maseyk et al. 2007, Rotenberg and Yakir 2011). Previous physiological research in Tunisia estimated an Aleppo pine growth period of ∼167 days per year, which is relatively longer in comparison with other Mediterranean pines such as P. pinea, P. pinaster and P. radiata (Khouja 1997). During the growing period, the species allocates a great proportion of the photosynthetic assimilate to growth (El-Aouni 1980). Indeed, the Aleppo pine exhibits the most rapid growth mainly in spring, then slow growth in summer, and remains latent during autumn and winter (Aramini et al. 2007, Del Campo et al. 2011, Monnier et al. 2012). Over the last 20 years in Tunisia, total average temperatures for April and May have been >17 °C, and larger cone crops were recorded (Jalel 2004). Recent research demonstrated the absence of any temperature effects in Aleppo pine cone production (Ayari et al. 2012b). Seasonal temperature fluctuations, such as hot and dry winters, cold winter temperatures, or in late spring variations, might negate seed and cone crops in coniferous species by killing the second-year conelets (Sorensen and Miles 1974, Owens and Blake 1985). Indeed, decreasing photosynthesis in forest trees can be explained by several climate change stresses, such as water deficits, extreme temperature fluctuations and nutrient deficiencies (Méthy et al. 1994). This result is amplified by the negative effects of long-term exposure to elevated ozone (O3) levels, which reduces forest tree growth and reproductive rates (Matyssek et al. 2007).\n\nStand-related factors\n\nStand density\n\nAleppo pine seed and cone production is negatively influenced by increasing stand density, whereas the basal area of the forest site has the opposite influence (Table 2). Several previous studies showed a positive influence on seed and cone production after any management effort leading to decreased stand density of Aleppo pine forests (Goubitz et al. 2004, Espelta and Verkaik 2007, Moya et al. 2008, 2009, Ayari et al. 2012a). In Tunisia, the assessment of 79 Aleppo pine forests showed that seed/cone number (rseed < −0.418, rcone < −0.471 (P < 0.001)) and seed/cone mass production (rseed < −0.451, rcone < −0.482 (P < 0.001)) were negatively correlated to stand density (Ayari et al. 2011c). Therefore, a flexible role of the stand density may influence the species flowering rate by its subsequent effect on resource availability and pollen quantity, which differ between years and individual trees (Goubitz et al. 2002). Aleppo pine is a monoecious and wind-pollinated coniferous tree (Krugman and Jenkinson 1974) showing a link between seed production and resource availability, which characterizes several wind-pollinated tree species (Allen and Platt 1990, Sork et al. 1993, Knapp et al. 2001). Forest thinning efforts have many benefits, such as reducing wildfire and enhancing biodiversity, as well as improving the growth and productivity of the main species within the stand (Gorte and Bracmort 2007, Turner et al. 2007, MacDonald et al. 2010). In Pinus forests, density reductions can also increase soil moisture availability (Sucoff and Hong 1974, Teskey et al. 1987, Powers et al. 2010), and subsequently tree physiological responses, such as photosynthetic carbon assimilation rates and stomatal conductance (McDowell et al. 2006, Bladon et al. 2007). Likewise, after thinning treatments, the tree stem diameter, total height and crown development of Pinus species within the forest are improved (Latham and Tappeiner 2002, López-Serrano et al. 2005, Prévosto et al. 2011, Adamopoulos et al. 2012, Ruano et al. 2013). Furthermore, Aleppo pine tree morphology (e.g., trunk diameter, height and crown size) is always significantly coupled with cone production (Ayari et al. 2012a), and its annual increment is improved once thinning is applied within a forest stand. In Tunisia, native Aleppo pine forests at low density grew faster in diameter and height than those at high density (Sghaier and Ammari 2012). Aleppo pine trees of larger trunk diameter produce massive cones (Ayari et al. 2011c), therefore increased seed and cone production may be the greatest advantage of thinning treatments (Ayari et al. 2012c). Analogous thinning advantages were also reported for other coniferous species (Mencuccini et al. 1995, Arista and Talavera 1996, Gilmore 2003, Ordonez et al. 2005, Blanco et al. 2009, Horner et al. 2010).\n\nSimilarly, once Aleppo pine forest stands are thinned, there are increases in light, which increases photosynthesis per tree (Spiecker 2000, Climent et al. 2008). Thus, competition for light in Pinus forests is a key limiting factor to productivity. Later, the consequence of increased light penetration after stands are thinned increases the forest productivity (Saunders et al. 2012, Ruiz-Mirazo and Gonzalez-Rebollar 2013). In fact, previous work showed that after thinning Aleppo pine or other forest species (i.e. Picea abies (L.)), increases in light reaching the trees led to increases in nutrient storage (Hasenauer and Sterba 2000, Spiecker 2000). Furthermore, the scientific forest literature suggests that the ecophysiological status of Pinus species, including Aleppo pine, is commonly dependent on light as well as on water and nutrient availability (Naumburg and DeWald 1999, Darabant et al. 2001, Ruano et al. 2009, Zhang et al. 2012). Both photosynthetic activities and stomatal conductance vary among forest coniferous tree species (Delzon and Loustau 2005, Chavez et al. 2011), based on the amount of light being received, site quality, individual tree age, CO2, vapour pressure deficits between needles and atmosphere, O3 levels and hormones that adjust the aperture of stomata (Maier 2001, Matsumoto et al. 2005). Moreover, in some Pinus thinned forests (e.g., P. sylvestris), the upper crown location had twice the cone production in comparison to cone number being produced on the lower crown position with lower light availability (Karlsson and Orlander 2002), but this was not always the case in Aleppo pine stands (Girard et al. 2012). Nutrients and light maintain appropriate physiological responses for isolated individual trees in open forest stands, which positively influence growth rates and successful reproduction processes (Bladon et al. 2007, Roberts and Harrington 2008).\n\nNutrient availability and fertilizers\n\nTree growth and biomass production depend on the availability of nutrients in the soil (Gallardo et al. 2003, Moya et al. 2007). Nutrient recruitment varies by species, age, and nutritional and physiological status of the individual trees. Previous findings showed that nitrogen, calcium, potassium, phosphorus and magnesium are most often measured and identified throughout Pinus tree organs (Del Campo et al. 2011). The lack of any elements can negatively affect tree growth and physiological activities (Kramer and Kozlowski 1979, Gallardo et al. 2003). Therefore, a nitrogen deficiency leads to needle chlorosis, explained by disturbed metabolism of chlorophyll and cytochrome (Grebner et al. 2013). Likewise, needle chlorosis is often due to a magnesium deficit, while any deficiencies of phosphorus and potassium can hinder the tree growth and affect photosynthesis, respectively (Kramer and Kozlowski 1979). Furthermore, a lack of calcium has negative influences on cell wall and root tip growth. Similar disturbances on physiological tree responses are also observed with deficiencies of other micronutrients, such as boron, iron, manganese, zinc, copper and molybdenum (Kramer and Kozlowski 1979, Lehto et al. 2010).\n\nPlant communities require resources (e.g., water and nutrients) to maintain their growth and reproduction, mainly in the juvenile phase (Cuesta et al. 2010a, 2010b). Therefore, the trade-off in nutrients stored for remobilization between plant organs increases during establishment of severe environmental circumstances (Obeso 2002). Furthermore, in plant development, the influence of increased nutrients has positive effects on organ function (Goubitz et al. 2002, Karlsson and Orlander 2002, Moya et al. 2007). Moreover, once nutrients and water are available there is improved seed and cone production in Pinus stands (Owens and Blake 1985, Way 2006, Roberts and Harrington 2008, Zhang et al. 2012). Previous reports from the northern USA have shown that nutrient availability plays a major role in the growth of Pinus species, but it remained less significant than light effects (Lieffers and Stadt 1994, Finzi and Canham 2000), which is due to the competition between species and understory vegetation (Darabant et al. 2001). Similarly, in the USA, the number of Pinus trees bearing cones was always higher in stands with high fertilizer levels than in unfertilized forest sites (Heidmann 1983).\n\nFire effects\n\nRecent Mediterranean reports have documented increases in fire frequency affecting Aleppo pine forests during the last few decades, mainly in Spain, Italy and Greece (Saracino et al. 1997, Andriopoulos and Arianoustou 2004, De Marco et al. 2004, De las Heras et al. 2007, Moya et al. 2008). However, within the forest stands, frequently plant regeneration for either Aleppo pine or the understory vegetation is related to their physiological traits and also influenced to fire regime (Andriopoulos and Arianoustou 2004, Iglesias 2010). Aleppo pine is a fire-resilient species, characterized by its high rate of production of serotinous cones with a significant proportion of filled seeds, if there are no adverse weather conditions and there is availability of viable pollen (Nathan et al. 1999, Thanos 2000, Thanos and Daskalakou 2000). Individual trees with a greater canopy seed bank have shown high post-fire seedling production due to the stored seeds in cones after maturation (Nathan et al. 1999, Ne'eman and Izhaki 1999). Thus, species regeneration may depend on the availability of viable seeds within the burned area where seeds come from serotinous mature cones but are not killed by fire, or from the soil seed bank (Thanos and Daskalakou 2000, Moya et al. 2008). Post-fire forest rehabilitation showed increases in Aleppo pine stem density, whereas from recent published work it is obvious that thinning enhances early species regeneration (De las Heras et al. 2007) and later its seed and cone production (Moya et al. 2008). The effect of wildfire on Aleppo pine ecosystems is complex and may be advantageous or not, while depending on nutrient status of the stands, timing and rigorousness of the burn (Nathan et al. 1999, Thanos 2000, Andriopoulos and Arianoustou 2004).\n\nFire influences on cone and seed production may also be evaluated by its effects on tree development since larger trunk diameter trees have higher rates of cone production and seed yields (González-Ochoa et al. 2004, Verkaik and Espelta 2006, Haymes and Fox 2012). However, earlier research showed a markedly reduced crown fire risk when fire occurred in thinned young and dense stands with previously constructed fire-breaks (Agee et al. 2000, Ruiz-Mirazo and Gonzalez-Rebollar 2013). Likewise, after fires, pine species have a life strategy of producing serotinous cones which facilitate recolonization (Moya et al. 2008). However, the relevant regeneration rate in pine stands is associated with increased resistance to pests (Petrakis et al. 2004), which may afterwards influence growth and seed yields via climatic conditions (Climent et al. 2008). Nonetheless, for Aleppo pine, the effect of fire on nutrient availability will be quickly evident on its seed and cone production (Espelta and Verkaik 2007). Therefore, when fire eliminates the understory flora, not only does the ash contain micro- and macronutrients, but the reduction in competition increases resource availability (Bladé and Vallejo 2008).\n\nIndividual tree characteristics\n\nTree morphology\n\nIn pine trees, including Aleppo pine, heavy yearly seed and cone crops are produced by the trees with the largest trunk diameters (Karlsson and Orlander 2002, Climent et al. 2008, Ayari et al. 2012a). Likewise, recent research on Aleppo pine trees growing in different climatic zones of Tunisia showed that trunk diameter and crown height were better parameters to predict seed and cone production within the forest stands, while other significant correlations were also detected with crown diameter, tree total height and age (Ayari et al. 2012a). Consequently, we counted 250 cones per average Aleppo pine tree containing ∼400 g of seeds in forests having a trunk diameter > 35 cm, and a crown dimension of at least 8 m in height and 4 m in diameter (Ayari et al. 2011c). Seeds from Aleppo pine forests are estimated to annually earn about 3 million US dollars (Ayari et al. 2012c). At an early growth stage of Aleppo pine in Greece, there are no significant relationships between cone production and either tree height or crown measurements (Matziris 1997). Likewise, in southern France, the frequency of cone crops is related to tree crown position (Girard et al. 2012), and larger cones often contain more and larger seeds (Bladé and Vallejo 2008, Ayari et al. 2011a). In the Mediterranean regions, Tunisian Aleppo pine trees produced more cones and seeds compared with other forest tree species (Climent et al. 2008). Recent research showed that Aleppo pine seed and cone production in Tunisia increased linearly with diameter, height (Table 3) and crown volume (Goubitz et al. 2004, Ayari et al. 2012a). Similarly, the species seed and cone production increased with age up to 14 years, but the rate of increase was smaller among older trees (Ayari et al. 2012a). Likewise, within the forest stands, dominant trees with the biggest crowns tend to be more productive than trees with co-dominant or lower canopy cover (Ayari et al. 2011b). In fact, all tree morphology parameters have significant effects on Aleppo seed and cone crops (Ordonez et al. 2005), but additional research will lead to a better understanding of their influence and their interactions with other variables that affect the species production rate.\n\nTree competition\n\nThe largest Aleppo pine seeds and cones produced are recorded within open stands and isolated trees that are not competing for nutrition, water or solar radiation (Goubitz et al. 2004, Espelta and Verkaik 2007, Ayari et al. 2012a). Several studies have documented the negative effects of competition on reproduction and vegetative growth due to scarce resource availability and the interference among tree crowns (Thanos and Daskalakou 2000). Therefore, decreasing stand densities may encourage fruit production earlier by better wind pollination and reducing competition for resource availability (Grayson et al. 2004, Bladé and Vallejo 2008). Earlier studies showed that some conifers, such as species of Pinus or Picea, tend to develop male cones or femaleness according to stand density, where low densities tend to encourage fructification (Arista and Talavera 1997). Later, Ayari et al. (2012b) demonstrated that Tunisian Aleppo pines should be twice as productive in seeds and cones when stand density is decreased from 1000 to 250 trees ha−1. However, Aleppo pine seedlings of unthinned or high stand densities have higher survival ability (Climent et al. 2008, Cuesta et al. 2011, Osem et al. 2013). Additionally, a reduced growth rate was explained by greater insect damage (De las Heras et al. 2012, Tamir 2013). Moreover, Aleppo pine growth and reproduction may also be affected by competition with the understory shrub layer for resources other than light. However, only a few studies have been undertaken in this respect for Aleppo pine forests.\n\nGenetics attitude\n\nConiferous tree characteristics are determined by genetics, environmental conditions and the interaction between the two (Khouja 1997, Harfouche et al. 2003, Louzada 2003, Tsukaya 2005). For Pinus species, the prevalent research worldwide has been carried out in planted forest sites or seed orchards from a forestry perspective rather than a multidisciplinary natural science approach (Goubitz et al. 2002, Aguiar et al. 2003, Mason and Conolly 2013). Aleppo pine genetic differences were assumed in Greek forests when it was deduced that flowering and cone production are under strong genetic control (Matziris 1997). Within the same stand, a few Aleppo pine trees produced abundant cone crops and they were genetically distinct from those that did not (Matziris 1998, Climent et al. 2008). Aleppo pine genetic clone plantations in Greece showed that seed cone production has a strong genetic component (Matziris 1993). Similarly, within the studied Aleppo pines in Algerian forests, Harfouche et al. (2003) showed that stands were not greatly differentiated from each other. However, the latter research team confirmed the possibility of gene migration by pollen or seeds and common pools of genotype would be shared if the distance between stands were small.\n\nInsects and pests as factors affecting seed and cone loss\n\nNative pine forests worldwide host many insect species (Graf and Mzibri 1994) and Mediterranean Aleppo pine trees host a large proportion of them (Ben Jamaâ 2007). Several tools have been used to discover and capture damaging insects (insect pests) within pine species (Khous and Gachi 1996, Chatenet 2000). Recent studies have described >50 insect species on Aleppo pine forests in Tunisia and Algeria (Chakali 1996, Ben Jamaa et al. 2000, Chatenet 2000). Coleopteran insects are present in forests of both countries, with >30 species having different diets (Chakali 2006). Roques (1983) established an extensive list of insect pests of seeds and cones in France. However, within Mediterranean pine forests, numerous insects are associated with buds, pollen, seeds, cones, bark and tree needles (Chatenet 2000). Ben Jamaa et al. (2000) and Chakali (2005) have highlighted serious insect pests of Aleppo pine trees in semi-arid areas, such as Tomicus destruens. Similarly, the cited studies showed that Coleoptera and Lepidoptera are the most important insects discovered within these forests. Insect pests seem to have the largest impact in Mediterranean forests (Ben Jamaâ 2007, Jactel et al. 2011), and can cause either extensive damage to tree needles and bark or destroy high proportions of seed and cone crops (Jactel et al. 2009, FBD 2012).\n\nAs with insects, numerous diseases of pine forests can decrease seed cone production directly or indirectly by damaging tree health (CABI 2002, Sturrock et al. 2011). Many fungal diseases are widespread in Aleppo pine trees such as Coleosporium inulae, which can seriously damage the foliage in young Aleppo pine plantations (Magnani 1974), and Sirococcus strobilinus, which causes bud death (Munoz-Lopez 1997). Among forest trees, the parasite impairs growth and usually decreases seed yields and viability (CABI 2002). Pine processionary moth (Thaumetopoea pityocampa) is the most serious foliage disease in Aleppo pines and may slow down the growth of mature trees and occasionally kill them (Ciesla 2004, Ben Jamaâ 2007, Vallejo et al. 2012). Similarly, animals such as squirrels destroy cone crops and consume large quantities of seeds (Parchman et al. 2006, Smith and Benkman 2007).\n\nConclusion\n\nClimate change and reforestation efforts in natural stands influence Aleppo pine forest structure and dynamics, regeneration rate and resilience to fire, in addition to cone and seed production. Following fire in Aleppo pine forest stands, the germination rate is regularly high, which is influenced by the availability of viable seeds either in the soil seed bank or in the serotinous mature cones on trees. Significant soil seed banks could be related to loss of factors, such as seed consumption by predators (e.g., squirrels, reptiles, mice and ants). Similarly, high viable seed contents in serotinous mature cones on the tree can be explained by low cone damage rates by fire, pests and insects. Previous research on Aleppo pine and other Pinus species suggests that thinning enhances growth and seed and cone production through reduced disease and pests, in addition to better resource availability including light, nutrients and water. Within limited environmental conditions and resource availability, several physiological disturbances are manifest throughout the growth and reproduction periods. Likewise, under stressed conditions, thinning treatments show larger rates of ovule abortion. These have been shown to be strongly related to seed and cone crop production. Wildfire effects combined with thinning treatments lead to improved tree health, growth, and better seed and cone production in Aleppo pine forests. Therefore, climate and genetics may influence the seed and cone production in natural Aleppo pine stands. However, seed yield is increased in larger trees with larger crown size.\n\nConflict of interest\n\nNone declared.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors thank all the Mediterranean forestry research colleagues for their cooperation, comments and help.
