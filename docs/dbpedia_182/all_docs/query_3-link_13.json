        "text": "By comparing the water's quality to the standards set for irrigation, it was determined how good it was. When evaluating irrigation water, salinity and sodicity are the key factors. Sodium, unlike the toxicity of other ions, i.e., sodium toxicity, is more difficult to detect. Leaf burn, scorch, and dead tissue are typical toxicity symptoms on plants, as opposed to chloride toxicity symptoms, which often manifest at the extreme leaf tip. Another ion that is typically found in irrigation water is chloride. Leaf burns or leaf tissue deaths are visible symptoms of its harmful effects right away. Bicarbonate, water's ability to neutralize an added acid, is measured by its alkalinity. Being the primary element of alkalinity, generally speaking, high pH levels (i.e., above 8.5) of water are caused by carbonate and bicarbonate ions. The major ion in the solution is sodium, as calcium and magnesium ions form insoluble minerals due to high carbonate concentrations. The results of analysis and the different parameters determined are presented in Figure 5. It is important to know the irrigation water quality since it affects both plants and soil. The high salt concentration in the water may be to blame for changes in soil permeability, structure, and ventilation. Crop growth is affected by drainage. Crop growth will be good as long as there is good drainage and bad if there is poor drainage. It is vital to determine the different properties of irrigation water to evaluate the appropriateness of water used for irrigation. This goal was achieved by calculating and interpreting the ratios of sodium absorption (SAR), RSC, PI, K), MH, Na% or SSP, and IWQI.\n\nKI: Na+ concentration is measured against Ca+2 and Mg+2 concentrations for the KI parameter calculation, and in most waters, Ca+2 and Mg+2 preserve their equilibrium condition. KI is calculated by using Equation (2) (Kelley 1940). where all concentrations are presented in meq/L.\n\nAccording to Kelley (1940) and Paliwal (1967), values less than 1 indicate that water is acceptable for irrigation, and if it is 1–2, it indicates that it is marginally suitable. According to this study, according to the KI values obtained, the water at the Touggourt station and water rejection at the El-Oued station (KI < 1) is good quality water for irrigation, whereas groundwater at the El-Oued station is just marginally suitable for irrigation (1 < KI < 2).\n\nAccording to the water quality diagram shown in Figure 6 and Wilcox (1955), the groundwater El-Oued and Touggourt strata are classified as having doubtful uses for irrigation. On the other hand, salt solutions in El-Oued and Touggourt stations are considered unsuitable for irrigation.\n\nPI: Porosity and permeability are two significant physical characteristics of soils; permeability is the soil's capacity to convey air and water. Long-term irrigation water applications impacted soil permeability because ions in the water, such as Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, and ⁠, impacted soil content. Doneen (1964) created PI to assess water's appropriateness for irrigation. It divides the water into three classes: Class 1 (PI > 75%), Class 2 (25 < % PI < 75%), and Class 3 (PI < 25%). Class 1 and 2 waters are categorized as ‘good’ and ‘suitable,’ respectively, with higher maximum permeability. Class 3 waters are categorized as ‘unsuitable’. PI is calculated using Equation (3) (Doneen 1964): where concentrations are given in meq/l.\n\nAccording to the computed PI values, the groundwater at El-Oued and Touggourt and water rejection at the El-Oued station come into class II, ‘suitable’ for irrigation, and salt solution in the Touggourt station is grouped into class III, ‘unsafe’ for irrigation.\n\nThe sodium percentage (Na%) or SSP, the general definition of Na %, is the amount of sodium in irrigation water. The sodium concentration in water induces the exchange of Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions. This exchange process then causes the soil's permeability to decrease, which leads to poor internal drainage. Because of its interaction with soil, sodium is an important ion for classifying irrigation water and reduces permeability. Na% is used to determine the water quality for use in agriculture. Plant development is slowed by irrigation water with high levels of sodium. The sodium percentage (Na%) is calculated using the formula of Todd (1995) (Equation (4)): where all concentrations are given in meq/L.\n\nValues less than 20 indicate excellent irrigation water, while values between 20 and 40 are deemed good, 40–60 are permissible, and 60–80 are regarded as doubtful. In this study, the groundwater and water rejection at the Touggourt station was lower than 20, suggesting that the water was excellent for irrigation. Moreover, the groundwater and water rejection at the El-Oued station was greater than 40 and lower than 60, suggesting that the water was permissible for irrigation.\n\nSAR: Richards (1954) was the one who first suggested using this parameter; it is used to evaluate Na ions' tendency for adsorption in soil and dissolved cation levels' tendency to enter into cation exchange regions in soil. High sodium concentrations have a direct impact on soil permeability and the saltiness of water overall. This shows that high concentrations might be toxic for delicate products (González-Acevedo et al. 2016). EC measurements are necessary for the salinity danger detection process. Figure 7 shows the USSL diagram used to plot SAR vs. EC values. SAR is used to identify potential sodium hazards. SAR is calculated using Equation (5). where all concentrations are given in meq/L.\n\nGroundwater quality may be classified into four categories: excellent if the SAR is less than 10, good if it is between 10 and 18, dubious if it is between 18 and 26, and unsuitable for irrigation if it is greater than 26. In this study, groundwater and water rejection at El-Oued and Touggourt stations were greater than 0 and lower than 10, respectively, suggesting that the water was low sodic hazard (S1).\n\nAccording to the USSL diagram, Touggourt station groundwater falls into the C4–S1 (extremely high salinity with low sodium) group. Moreover, groundwater from the El-Oued station falls into C4–S2 (very high salinity with medium sodium) group. Very high salinity dangers are present in the groundwater at El-Oued and Touggourt stations, along with low to medium alkali hazards. According to the USSL diagram, the groundwater stations at El-Oued and Touggourt are suitable for irrigation in all soil types. The water rejected (salt solution) at El-Oued and Touggourt stations is unclassified and unfit for irrigation.\n\nEaton (1950) suggested that RSC is calculated using Equation (6): where all concentrations are given in meq/L.\n\nThe sodicity hazard of irrigation water may be effectively measured using RSC. The soil's calcium and magnesium ions tend to precipitate as a result of the anions and in irrigation water, which increases the proportion of sodium ions. RSC was therefore seen as a sign of the sodicity hazard of water. It divides the water into three classes: water containing less than 1.25 meq/l is suitable for irrigation. Water with RSC levels of 1.25–2.5 meq/l was deemed marginal, and irrigation is not recommended for water with RSC levels higher than 2.5 meq/l. In this study, groundwater and water rejection at El-Oued and Touggourt stations was lower than 1.25, suggesting that the water was good for irrigation.\n\nMH: Magnesium has a detrimental impact on soil quality by making it more alkaline, destroying soil structure, and lowering crop yields when it is present in irrigation water at high concentrations (Srinivasa 2005). MH is calculated using Equation (7): where all concentrations are given in meq/L.\n\nIf the percentage of MH is less than 50%, it indicates that the water is safe for irrigation purposes; however, if the percentage is greater than 50%, it indicates that the water quality is unsuitable for irrigation. According to this index, the groundwater and water rejection samples from the El-Oued station fall into suitable water. The groundwater and water rejection samples from the Touggourt station fall into harmful and unsuitable water.\n\nIWQI: The model of IWQI stipulates that irrigation water quality needs may vary from field to another based on the type of crop being grown there and the local climatic and soil conditions. The WQI has been extensively utilized in recent years to assess the appropriateness of water for irrigation and drinking. The IWQI model was used on the collected data. This model was developed by Meireles et al. (2010). The parameters which were first selected were those that were deemed to be more pertinent to irrigation usage. The second phase was defining the terms quality measurement values (qi) and aggregation weights (wi). According to the standards set by Ayers & Westcot (1999) and the irrigation water quality parameters supplied by the UCCC, values of qi were estimated based on each parameter value. The results are shown in Table 1. A non-dimensional number was used to represent the water quality parameters; the greater the value, the higher the water quality.\n\nTable 1\n\nqi . EC (μs/cm) . SAR (meq/l)1/2 . Na+ . Cl− . .

The upper limit was considered the highest value determined in the physical–chemical and chemical analysis of the water samples. To evaluate xamp of the last class of each parameter. Then, using Equation (9), wi values were normalized such that their total equals one (Meireles et al. 2010). where wi is the parameter's weight for the WQI; F is the component 1 auto value; Aij is the explainability of parameter i by factor j; and I represents how many physical–chemical and chemical parameters the model has chosen. Ranging from 1 to n, j is the number of factors selected in the model, varying from 1 to k. The relative weight of each parameter is shown in Table 2.\n\nTable 2\n\nParameter . EC . Na . HCO3 . Cl . SAR . Total . Weight (wi) 0.211 0.204 0.202 0.194 0.189 1.0\n\nParameter . EC . Na . HCO3 . Cl . SAR . Total . Weight (wi) 0.211 0.204 0.202 0.194 0.189 1.0\n\nThe aforementioned values of qi and wi may be used to calculate the IWQI value in accordance with Equation (10) (Hallouche et al. 2017).\n\nIWQI is a dimensionless parameter with a value between 0 and 100; qi is the quality of the ith parameter, a number from 0 to 100, a function of its measurement or concentration; and wi is the normalized weight of the ith parameter, the function of its relative importance to groundwater quality. The suggested WQI was used to divide classes based on existing water quality indices. Classes were defined considering the risk of salinity problems and soil water infiltration reduction. In addition, plant toxicity is seen in the classifications provided by Bernardo (1995) and Holanda & Amorim (1997). The classification of restrictions to water usage classes is presented in Table 3.\n\nTable 3\n\nIWQI . Water use restrictions . Recommendation . Soil . Plant . 85–100 No restriction (NR) May be used for the majority of soils with a low probability of causing salinity and sodicity problems, being recommended leaching within irrigation practices, except for in soils with extremely low permeability. No toxicity risk for most plants 70–85 Low restriction (LR) Recommended for use in irrigated soils with light texture or moderate permeability, being recommended salt leaching. Soil sodicity in heavy texture soils may occur, being recommended to avoid its use in soils with high clay Avoid salt-sensitive plants 55–70 Moderate restriction (MR) May be used in soils with moderate to high permeability values, being suggested moderate leaching of salts. Plants with moderate tolerance to salts may be grown 40–55 High restriction (HR) May be used in soils with high permeability without compact layers. High-frequency irrigation schedule should be adopted for water with EC above 2,000 μS/cm and SAR above 7.0. Should be used for irrigation of plants with moderate to high tolerance to salts with special salinity control practices, except water with low Na, Cl, and HCO3 values. 0–40 Severe restriction (SR) Should be avoided use for irrigation under normal conditions. In special cases, it may be used occasionally. Water with low salt levels and high SAR requires gypsum application. In high saline content water, soils must have high permeability, and excess water should be applied to avoid salt accumulation. Only plants with high salt tolerance, except for waters with extremely low values of Na, Cl, and ⁠.\n\nIWQI . Water use restrictions . Recommendation . Soil .

In high saline content water, soils must have high permeability, and excess water should be applied to avoid salt accumulation. Only plants with high salt tolerance, except for waters with extremely low values of Na, Cl, and ⁠.\n\nThe IWQI for irrigation usage is shown in Figure 8. At El-Oued and Touggourt stations, groundwater and water rejection were classified as having ‘severe restriction (SR)’ for irrigation and may be used in soils with high permeability.\n\nGroundwater and water rejection samples obtained from El-Oued and Touggourt stations were analysed using the SAR, SSP, Na%, and PI indices shown in Figure 8. Water quality indicators for irrigation have shown that groundwater at El-Oued and Touggourt stations is acceptable for irrigation.\n\nRegarding water rejection (salt solution), water in El-Oued and Touggourt stations is unsuitable for irrigation.\n\nAfter evaluating the quality of the brine and groundwater at the El-Oued and Touggourt stations, it was discovered that the brine's salinity was quite high and unsuitable for irrigation. The aforementioned methods were used to reduce salinity by combining groundwater and brine. Also, TDS values in accordance with irrigation standards were determined. After that, the amount of groundwater to be added was calculated using Law 1. The appropriate water mixture was analysed in the laboratory. Finally, the irrigation water quality indices were calculated and discussed based on the analysis results.\n\nHydrogeochemical facies, according to the plotted Piper diagram shown in Figure 9, water after mixing in El-Oued is Cl-_Na + _K + , whereas water after mixing in Touggourt is Cl−_ _Ca2+_Mg2+.\n\nHydrochemistry: It became apparent after receiving the water analysis results after mixing in two stations that the salt percentage in the water of the two stations is acceptable (Figure 10).\n\nSuitability of water after mixing for irrigation purposes, by comparing the water's quality to standards set for irrigation, it was determined how good it was. This goal was achieved by calculating and interpreting the ratios of sodium absorption (SAR), RSC, PI, KI, MH, sodium percentage (Na%) or SSP, and IWQI. The results of analysis and the different parameters determined are presented in Figure 11.\n\nKI: According to the KI values obtained, the water after mixing at El-Oued and Touggourt stations (KI < 1) is good quality water for irrigation.\n\nPI: According to the computed PI values, after mixing in El-Oued and Touggourt stations, the obtained water comes into class II, ‘suitable’ for irrigation.\n\nNa% or SSP: The results show that water after mixing at the Touggourt station was lower than 20, suggesting that the water was excellent for irrigation. Conversely, water after mixing at the El-Oued station was greater than 40 and lower than 60, suggesting that the water was permissible for irrigation.\n\nAccording to SAR calculation results, water after mixing at El-Oued and Touggourt stations was greater than 0 and lower than 10, suggesting that the water was low sodic hazard (S1).\n\nAccording to the USSL diagram, Figure 12, water after mixing from the Touggourt station falls into C4–S1 (extremely high salinity with low sodium) group, and water after mixing from the El-Oued station falls into the C4–S2 (very high salinity with medium sodium) group. Very high salinity dangers are present in the water after mixing in El-Oued and Touggourt stations, along with low to medium alkali hazards. According to the USSL diagram, the waters after mixing in El-Oued and Touggourt stations are suitable for irrigation usage in all soil types.\n\nRSC: After mixing at El-Oued and Touggourt stations, the water founded to have RSC values lower than 1.25, suggesting that the water is good for irrigation.\n\nMH: According to this index, water after mixing from the El-Oued station falls into suitable water. In contrast, after mixing from the Touggourt station, water falls into harmful and unsuitable water.\n\nIWQI: The IWQI for irrigation usage is shown in Figure 11. In El-Oued and Touggourt stations, water after mixing was classified as having ‘severe restriction (SR)’ for irrigation and may be used in soils with high permeability.\n\nThe SAR, SSP, Na%, and PI indices were used to evaluate the water after mixing taken from El-Oued and Touggourt stations to determine that they are appropriate for irrigation. Water quality indicators for irrigation have shown that water after mixing from the El-Oued and Touggourt stations is suitable for irrigation. KI < 1 indicates that the water is suitable for irrigation. Moreover, as the RSC in the water from the Touggourt and El-Oued stations is <1.25, the water is suitable for irrigation.\n\nAccording to the MH values determined from the El-Oued station, MH < 50% means that the water is suitable for irrigation, and the values of MH > 50% were observed in the Touggourt station. This issue may arise when irrigation water contains relatively more magnesium ions than calcium ions.\n\nFigures 5 and 10 show the EC values for samples taken from El-Oued and Touggourt's demineralization stations. The concentration of salts in the water increases with the EC. It is obvious that the EC has decreased the water quality standards for irrigation where the concentration of EC in the brine leaving the demineralization station is 7,690 and 7,620 μs/cm, respectively, and the concentration of groundwater is 2,790 and 2,990 μs/cm, respectively. After water mixing, the EC became 4,041.73 and 3,535.45 μs/cm, respectively.\n\nThe temperatures of the water samples taken from El-Oued and Touggourt's demineralization station are shown in Figures 5 and 10. It is clear that the temperatures have dropped to levels that are suitable for irrigation, with the brine temperature in the demineralization station being 31.5 and 28, respectively, and the groundwater temperature being 40.2 and 40, respectively. After water mixing, the temperature decreased to 37.97 and 38.58, respectively.\n\nThe TDS values in samples taken from the demineralization station are shown in Figures 5 and 10. The TDS values of groundwater are 1,786 and 1,985 mg/l, respectively, and the TDS values of the brine leaving the demineralization El-Oued and Touggourt stations are 4,922 and 3,810 mg/l, respectively, and the water is not suitable for agricultural use. TDS values at El-Oued and Touggourt stations are 2,587 and 2,200 mg/L, respectively, where the values comply with water quality norms for agricultural use.\n\nFigure 13 shows the irrigation water quality parameters of Touggourt and El-Oued stations' water after mixing suitable for agricultural use. It was ranked that water after mixing, as “severe restriction (SR)” for irrigation in El-Oued stations and Touggourt in accordance with Table 3. Only soil with a high permeability should be utilized with these sorts of water. Fortunately, the study region is in a desert with soil that has a high level of permeability (sand). Therefore, water after mixing might be utilized for irrigation with the limitations of the plant types that can tolerate salt, as listed in Table 3.\n\nBy assessing the IWQI of El-Oued and Touggourt stations shown in Figure 13, the water after mixing from the Touggourt station is more suitable for irrigation than from the El-Oued station."
