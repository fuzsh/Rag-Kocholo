Introduction\n\nLakes in Algeria have, for a long time, been a source of\n\nwater for humans and their livestock, especially during\n\ndry seasons. They also support a rich biodiversity and are\n\nof major importance for migratory birds and constitute\n\nwintering grounds for thousands of ducks, coots, geese,\n\nand flamingos. Currently 42 out of the 300 lakes in Alge-\n\nria are listed under the Ramsar Convention covering an\n\narea of 3 million ha [1].\n\nThe most characteristic types of lake in Algeria are\n\nendorheic lakes. They consist of chotts and sebkhas, as\n\nknown in Arabic, also referred to as Athalassic salt lakes.\n\nThe term athalassic denotes saline waters which are iso-\n\nlated from the sea, or which were once connected to the\n\nsea, but which have dried out before being re-flooded by\n\nwater of non-marine origin [1]. The chotts and sebkhas\n\nare typically seasonal lake which dry out in summer and\n\nre-flood in winter. According to [2], sebkha is the central\n\nzone of saline lake dominated by water and devoid of\n\nvegetation due to high salt concentrations. The chott is\n\nthe surrounding zone which forms a vegetation ring\n\naround the water. This vegetation is mainly composed of\n\nhalophytic, succulent and perennial species. In these en-\n\nvironments the main factors controlling vegetation are\n\nwater salinity in the growing season and the depth and\n\nperiod of flooding. Vegetation at the edges of the Chotts\n\ncomprises mainly members of the Chenopodiaceae fam-\n\nily (such as Atriplex ssp., Salsola ssp., Suaeda ssp. and\n\nSalicornia ssp.) Among the most important chotts in Al-\n\ngeria is Chott Zehrez, the second largest Chott in North\n\nAfrica [1]. However, as far as we know, there has not\n\nbeen a lot of research conducted on these systems.\n\nSeveral efforts were made to compile a list of the\n\nhalophytic flora of the world [3] as well as a list of re-\n\ngional halophytes. However, the information regarding\n\nhalophytes is still far from complete. The flora of Algeria\n\nis near completion and also has information about the\n\nhalophytes. Currently, effort is being made to compile a\n\nlist of halophytes in Algeria, with their distribution,\n\necology and potential economic usages.\n\nHalophytes and other salt-tolerant plants may provide\n\nsensible alternatives for many developing countries [4].\n\nThese plants can grow in saline to extremely saline habi-\n\ntats and have particular characteristics which enable them\n\nto evade and/or tolerate salinity by various eco-physio-\n\n*Corresponding author.\n\nCopyright © 2012 SciRes. AJPS\n\nBiodiversity of Halophytic Vegetation in Chott Zehrez Lake of Djelfa (Algeria)\n\n1528\n\nlogical mechanisms. These plants are naturally grown in\n\nsalt affected lands such as in salt lakes, marshes, sloughs,\n\nsaline soils and seashores. The vegetative yields of halo-\n\nphytes and other salt-tolerant plants species could have\n\ngreat economic potentialities in the arid and semi-arid\n\nareas [5]. There are many halophytes and salt-tolerant\n\nshrubs and grasses which could be established in saline\n\nlands (e.g. Kochia sp., Juncus sp., Acacia sp., Suaeda sp.,\n\nSalsola sp. and Atriplex sp.). Although economic consid-\n\neration of halophytes and other salt-tolerant plants is just\n\nbeginning, they are now receiving increased attention\n\nparticularly in arid regions where salinity problems are\n\nvery crucial.\n\nDespite their international importance in Algeria,\n\nChott Lakes have attracted little attention concerning\n\ntheir floristic composition and ecological processes. The\n\nobjectives of this study are to focus on 1) the under-\n\nstanding the Chott Zehrez as a large, shallow lake eco-\n\nsystem where wetlands are important and its ecological\n\nthreats 2) to identify the different plant communities\n\npresent in the area of Chott Zehrez lake and 3) to de-\n\nscribe the economic potential use of a wide range of\n\nhalophytes and other salt tolerant vegetation.\n\n2. Site Description\n\nThe study was undertaken in a salt Chott of Zehrez\n\nDjelfa, which is located to the north of Algeria (3Ë03'E\n\nlongitude, 34Ë36'N latitude) (Figure 1). The Chott area is\n\nabout 50.985 ha and the altitude ranges from 840 m to\n\n825 m. The geology consists mainly of cretaceous, with\n\ndeposits of quaternary. According to [2] principal type of\n\nsoils in Chott Zehrez wetland are the calci-magnesic so-\n\nlontchak and hydromorphic soils (gley). The Sebkha\n\nsoils are characterised by saline silts, prone to flooding in\n\nwinter and covered by salty crusts in summer [6]. The\n\nendorheic nature of the area and the flat relief induce\n\nwater accumulation in the Chott from winter rainfall. The\n\nsaline soils (solontchaks) are poorly developed and con-\n\ntain a high amount of exchangeable sodium and soluble\n\nsalts. The texture changes from silt-clays to silt-sands [7].\n\nSoil salinity ranges from 1.99 to 4.47 dS·mâ1. The water\n\ntable varies from 1 to 3 m below the surface (Figure 2).\n\nThe climate of Chott Zehrez is typically Mediterranean,\n\ncharacterised by wet winters and hot dry summers with a\n\nmean annual precipitation of 250 mm·yearâ1 (2000-2010).\n\nThe average minimum winter and maximum summer\n\ntemperatures are 5ËC in January and 26ËC in July, re-\n\nspectively. The rainy season is generally from mid-Oc-\n\ntober to May [8].\n\nThe natural vegetation is represented by halophytes\n\nsuch as Atriplex halimus, Suaeda fruticosa, Salsola ver-\n\nmiculata and Salicornia fruticosa.

Salicornia sp. is often the dominant species on\n\nChott Zehrez Lake, The pools of water in the foreground\n\nindicate the high level of the groundwater (Photo Senni R.,\n\n2010).\n\nendemic plant species are found, including: Herniaria\n\nmauritanica, Salicornia arabica, Avena bomoides, Hor-\n\ndeum maritimu, Juncus bufonius, Launaea resedfolia,\n\nPolygonum equisetfo rme and Reaumuria venniculata [9].\n\nThe Chott Zehrez lake is very important for breeding\n\nand over-wintering of many bird populations. There is a\n\ndiversity of species many of which are rare and threat-\n\nened. These include Outarde (Chlamydotis undulata),\n\ndifferent types of ducks: Anas penelope, Anas clypeata,\n\nAnas platyrhynchos and other birds such as Falco tin-\n\nnunculus; Columba livia and Tyto alba. This relatively\n\ndiverse flora and fauna was a critical factor in the desig-\n\nnation of the Chott as a RAMSAR site.\n\n3. Halophytic Vegetation Description\n\nThe region of Chott Zehrez lake investigated in this study\n\nis characteristic of the salt marshes (Sebkha and Chott)\n\nsituated in the northern part of Algeria (Djelfa). The re-\n\nsults demonstrated that halophytic and hydrohalophytic\n\ncommunities constitute the natural vegetation of the area.\n\n112 species belonging to 26 families and 39 genera were\n\nrecorded (Table 1).

Phanerophytes, Chamaephytes and Therophytes\n\nwere the most frequent life forms. The highest number of\n\nhalophyte species is present in the Chenopodiaceae fam-\n\nily (19), followed by Poaceae (6), Plumbaginaceae (5),\n\nFabaceae (3) and Tamaricaceae (3), while other families\n\nare represented by less than 16 halophytes (Table 1).\n\n4. Utilization and Economic Potential of\n\nHalophytes\n\nHalophytes have their greatest potential not so much in\n\ncontributing to the worldâs food supply but primarily in\n\ntheir utilization of the growing areas of saline land for a\n\nrange of different goals. The most important opportuni-\n\nties relate to reforestation or replanting and ecological\n\nrecovery of saline areas that have fallen into disuse,\n\ncoastal development and protection, and the production\n\nof cheap biomass for renewable energy, climate im-\n\nprovement and CO2 sequestration [10].\n\nHalophytes seem to have much potential as a land cover\n\ncannot be denied, which is not only aesthetically pleasing\n\nbut also checks land erosion and degradation. The more\n\nimportant opportunities relate to reforestation or replant-\n\ning and ecological recovery of saline areas that have\n\nfallen into disuse, coastal development and protection,\n\nproduction of cheap biomass for renewable energy, en-\n\nvironment conservation through carbon (C) sequestration,\n\nstabilization of coasts and beaches; and support to devel-\n\nopment of wild-life sanctuary and recreation areas [11].\n\n4.1. Food\n\nThe only conventional crops species consumed by human\n\nbeings as food, which tolerate salinity to a certain extent\n\nare beets (Beta vulgaris) and the date palm (Phoenix\n\ndactylifera), which can be irrigated with brackish water.\n\nThe young leaves and shoots of Sesuvium portulacastrum,\n\nAtriplex halimus and A. hortensis, have also been used\n\nfor vegetables, salads in various parts of the country [10].\n\n4.2. Forages and Fodders Production\n\nHalophytes are naturally adapted to vast areas of salt-\n\naffected range lands [12,13] and they have been grazed\n\nor browsed by animals for a long time. Halophytic\n\ngrasses, shrubs and trees are all potential sources of fod-\n\nder. The greatest potential of halophytes probably rests\n\nwith their utilization as forages and fodder.\n\nThe foliage of such species as Atriplex spp., Salsola\n\nspp. and Puccinellia spp., are used cattle feed. Many\n\nspecies of Salicornia spp., Chenopodium spp., Suaeda\n\nspp. and Koch ia spp. are common fodder shrubs. Among\n\ngrasses, Aeluropus litorallis, Poa bulbosa, Phragmites\n\ncommunis, Schismus barbatus, and Puccinellia distans\n\nare common species found in saline and alkaline areas\n\nand used as forages [14].\n\nMany of the halophytic plant species and salt-tolerant\n\nspecies provide a valuable reserve feed for grazing ani-\n\nmals particularly under drought conditions or fill regular\n\ngaps in feed supply caused by seasonal conditions [15].\n\nThe value of certain halophytic species has been recog-\n\nnized by their incorporation in pasture improvement pro-\n\ngrams in many salt-affected regions throughout the world\n\n[16]. There have been recent advances in selecting spe-\n\ncies with high biomass and protein levels and the ability\n\nto survive a wide range of environmental conditions in-\n\ncluding salinity [17]. Atriplex halimus has been field\n\ntested for domestic livestock and found to produce good\n\nfodder with biomass varied from 0.5 to 5 t·DW·haâ1.\n\nThis productivity is mainly related to the water availabil-\n\nity and soil depth [17].\n\n4.3. Oil Seeds\n\nSeed of many halophytes contain appreciable amount of\n\nedible oils [18]. Seeds of various halophytes, such as\n\nSuaeda fruticosa, Arthrocnemum spp., Salicornia spp.\n\nand Halogeton spp. possess a sufficient quantity of high\n\nquality edible oil with unsaturation ranging from 70% -\n\n80% [19]. Thus, the exploration of economically impor-\n\ntant halophytes species may constitute an alternative\n\nsource of edible oil.\n\n4.4. Fuel Wood and Coal\n\nModerately to highly salt-tolerant trees, which can pro-\n\nvide a range of wood and non wood products as well as\n\nother benefits are available. One of the most common\n\nuses of trees biomass is firewood [20].\n\nIn many developing countries people rely on wood for\n\ncooking and heating. Quite often fuel wood is obtained\n\nfrom salt tolerant trees and shrubs, which may include\n\nspecies of Prosopis spp ., Tamarix sp p., Salsola spp.,\n\nAtriplex spp. and Suaeda spp. In addition species like\n\nTamarix aphylla, and T. africana could provide good\n\nquality wood and also contribute to charcoal production\n\n[14].\n\nIn areas of moderate to high salinity, highly salt toler-\n\nant species, especially within the genus Acacia , which\n\nmay have fuelwood value, may be used. The use of\n\nwoody halophytes like mangrove as a source of charcoal\n\nfor many years is a good example of using halophytes as\n\nfuel crop. Nevertheless, the anthropogenic impact, par-\n\nticularly the overcutting of these mangrove trees for\n\nwood, is increasing desertification in these areas [20].\n\n4.5. Medicinal Uses\n\nMany workers have reported the medicinal uses of halo-\n\nBiodiversity of Halophytic Vegetation in Chott Zehrez Lake of Djelfa (Algeria)1533\n\nphytes while describing the economic importance of\n\nplants [21,22]. Halophytic plants are known to provide\n\nrelief in the following diseases: Limonium spp.: Stop\n\nbleeding, promote urination and astringe; Glycyrrhiza\n\nspp.: Stop coughing, clean lungs; Apocynum venetum:\n\nReduce blood pressure, strengthen heart and promote\n\nurination; Nitraria spp.: Normalize menstruation, pro-\n\nmote blood circulation, help digestion and strengthen the\n\nspleen; Atriplex halimus: Antidiabetic effects; Plantago\n\nspp., Zygophyllum spp.: Flu and cough; Salsola tetrandra:\n\nVermifuge; Plant ago major: Diuretic [14].\n\n5. Restoration\n\nGlobally, the ecology and importance of Chott lake eco-\n\nsystems have been largely neglected. Chotts are probably\n\nthe most poorly understood ecosystems, being neither\n\ngood land, nor good water. Despite the status of Chott\n\nZehrez as a Ramsar site, the main threat to its conserva-\n\ntion is the private nature of surrounding land holdings in\n\naddition to the lack of knowledge and awareness by the\n\nlocal population of the importance of chott ecosystems.\n\nThe development of any Chott conservation strategy in\n\nAlgeria is also hindered by the lack of coordination be-\n\ntween the ministries of environment and agriculture, as is\n\ncommon in many Mediterranean countries [1]. Further-\n\nmore, engaging local stakeholders in the development of\n\nconservation strategies often occur in the absence of any\n\nconsideration of biodiversity issues. In Algeria for in-\n\nstance, there is no restriction on farmers to grow crops\n\nnext to the Chott, neither is there a limit to livestock\n\nnumbers. Therefore, continuing degradation by grazing\n\nand cultivation is resulting in the loss of habitats and\n\nassociated species.\n\nThe local authorities should consider stricter control\n\non damaging activities to these plant communities such\n\nas vegetation removal, cultivating or grazing. At the\n\nsame time campaigns promoting the value of such eco-\n\nsystems, the involvement of local communities and edu-\n\ncational programs are necessary to raise local awareness\n\nand assist in the long term conservation of these ecosys-\n\ntems.\n\nIt is concluded that salt marshes are an integral com-\n\nponent of the Chott lake ecosystem, serving as important\n\nareas of primary production for inland food chains. They\n\nare also an important habitat for the production of graz-\n\ning animals. However, the diversity of the halophytes\n\nand other natural recourses in the salt lake in Algeria are,\n\nunfortunately, facing dangerous impacts due to the un-\n\ncontrolled human interference. Many plant, animal,\n\nbirdâs species are either endangered or even exterminated.\n\nSuch bad environmental situation and interference need\n\nurgent solutions through the conservation and sustainable\n\nuse of the halophytic vegetation and its ecosystem in the\n\nsalt marshes by applying several approaches such as:\n\n1) Preserve the genetic resources of these species in\n\nthe Algerian National Gene Bank,\n\n2) Restoring the endangered species in its habitats,\n\n3) Cultivating the economic halophytes species or\n\ncrops of salinity resistant in habitat by using saline and\n\nbrackish water of the lakes, and\n\n4) Cultivating the multi-purposes halophytic species.\n\nThe feasibility of growing halophytes on salt Chott can\n\nbe maximized with plant species that in addition to its\n\nprimary product can also provide indirect and economi-\n\ncal benefits.\n\nThe conservation and sustainable utilization of Chott\n\nlake ecosystem can be achieved through the development\n\nof appropriate legislation and laws to improve local\n\ncommunity participation in decision-making, regulating\n\naccess and utilization of rangelands. In addition, infor-\n\nmation and dissemination systems, and cooperation and\n\ncoordination mechanisms should be established among\n\nnational institutions.\n\n6. Conclusions\n\nChott Zehrez lake, located in the north of Algeria, is a\n\ngood example as a Ramsar site of international impor-\n\ntance. The future conservation and management of the\n\nsite therefore, require more detailed knowledge of their\n\necology and biodeversity. This review summarized the\n\nbenefits and the constraints of halophytes and other\n\nsalt-tolerant plants as economic potential resources in\n\nChott Zehrez lake. It is concluded that:\n\nï· Halophytes and salt-tolerant species yield high edible\n\nbiomass in saline lands where non-halophytic species\n\ncannot grow.\n\nï· The study has provided a clearer vision and recom-\n\nmendations to researchers and policy makers with re-\n\ngard to underutilized halophytic species and the im-\n\nportance of exploiting the potential of same in the fu-\n\nture.\n\nï· In the view of the previous forecasts, it is necessary to\n\nemphasize that Chott lake ecosystem in fact demands\n\nurgent management action to conserve its threatened\n\nand unique ecosystem.\n\n7.
