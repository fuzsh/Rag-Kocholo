        "text": "710 Titusville, FL Automobile USER: While driving to work from Maitland, FL to Titusville FL, I noticed my iPhone 12 Google Maps display going erratic and placing the receiver location symbol south of the 408 expressway into nearby neighborhoods. I rebooted the iPhone, restarted Google Maps, but the issue remained. I then switched to my 2022 Audi A5's native GPS navigation system and saw the same behavior with the car location showing the same as my iPhone. I rebooted my iPhone again but to no avail. I watched this behavior continue as I drove eastward on the 408 and then onto US Hwy 50 toward Titusville, FL. As I continued eastward, the drift to the south versus true position increased. As I crossed the Saint John's River on Hwy 50, the iPhone and Audi receivers showed my position to be south of the 428 Beach Line expressway in the swampy off-road areas approximately 6 miles away. As I approached my work location (Boeing building in Titusville, FL), I rebooted my iPhone again and it returned to normal service but my car's received stayed \"locked onto\" whatever interference signal was generating the drift even as I parked in the parking lot. The car receiver returned to normal service when I started the car and left work and around 7 PM. Both receivers showed normal operations the entire trip home to Maitland, FL. Note that I'm an electrical engineer having worked in Electromagnetic Effects and RF Communications fields for 35 years primarily at the Kennedy Space Center Electromagnetic Effects Laboratory and with the USAF Eastern Test Range Frequency Manager. Therefore, the behavior I noticed was very concerning that 2 receivers of different designs were seeing the same erratic behavior suggesting an outside interfering or spoofing source.\n\nNAVCEN: The GPS Operations Center reviewed the GPS Constellation and Control Segment, there are no known anomalies that might affect GPS signal integrity at the time and vicinity of the reported problem.

Unknown Interference 02/12/2024 647 Other USER: This anomaly has been ongoing since approximately January 3, 2024, and occurs at and around the junction listed at the above lat and long. When I approached that junction, all of the active GPS devices started to shift off in the incorrect direction. Normally, around 30-40 degrees of deflection from the route of travel. This deflection generally continues to occur for approximately 3-5 miles after the anomaly begins, and then the GPS corrects back to the route of travel. This anomaly tends to occur between around 1100z to sunset (around 2300z). My Jeep Grand Cherokee's integrated GPS has a satellite details page, and all of the satellites have high signal strength and an ample number of satellites. Due to the consistency of the interference and its start and stop timing, my initial assumption was some sort of ground-based interference either as unintentionally generatorated RFI or intentional interference. I will happily provide screenshots from both my iPhone and photos of the details page from my car if requested.\n\nNAVCEN: The GPS Operations Center reviewed the GPS Constellation and Control Segment, there are no known anomalies that might affect GPS signal integrity at the time and vicinity of the reported problem.

During the time of first alarm 12 satellites were observed to be tracked. After 30 minutes and when the gps signal totally lost, observed that 0 satellites were tracked. No1 GPS was still properly working with no alarms and safe navigation indication was enabled. After 30 to 40 minutes the same alarm of no position fixing sounded also on No1 GPS and the position from ECDIS monitor appeared to be on land 50 - 60nm off original psn.

These tests usually disrupt our GNSS receivers reducing the SNRs sometimes small amounts and sometimes to the point where the receivers lose lock and stay that way for hours. Up until last year these test periods were listed on the Approved GPS Testing Schedule. I believe that schedule was only updated twice last year. The current one is still for 2023-06-30. Signal degradation was also seen in August, October and December of 2023. This problem was for just a very short amount of time at approximately 0703UT. Plots of the interference can be seen at www.passcal.nmt.edu/~bob/gpsmon/7gmwsmr.html, though this one is pretty short/small.

Thought it might just be my phone then so tried engaging my cars built in nav system and displayed the current gps location in the same inaccurate position as Waze was. At that point suspected it was not something with my phone but likely a broader GPS issue given it was happening across devices. Did not think it would help, but for the sake of trying, I powered my phone completely off since it was connected via CarPlay just to verify there was no possible way that my phone was somehow interfering with my card nav system (tho I don’t know how that would even happen anyway).
