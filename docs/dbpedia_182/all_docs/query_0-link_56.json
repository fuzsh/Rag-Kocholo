        "text": "Desertification is a major risk that threatens the arid and semi arid regions throughout the globe. With continued population growth, desertification exacerbates while natural areas regress as a result of rapid urbanization, increase of cultivated land areas, overgrazing, and deforestation. ÓÅâis adds to the effects of climate change. Algeria as many countries is not safe from this risk. Indeed, agronomists and ecologists report that Alfa grass cover has reduced while the quality of the grasslands itself is becoming increasingly degraded. To tackle this serious risk, the Algerian authorities developed the Green Dam project as a massive reforestation program aiming to safeguard and to develop of the pre-Saharan areas.\n\nThe green dam is one of Algeria's greatest environmental achievements. However, few studies have focused on this area and particularly on its dynamics. This study intends to follow the evolution of the green dam since its establishment. We have chosen a typical region where this reforestation was initiated, the forest of Moudjbara, located in Djelfa (department). A visual classification of Landsat satellite images 1972, 1987; 2003 and 2016 coupled with field surveys was carried out. To limit the exogenous variations, the sun-synchronous satellite images were chosen in autumn. Phytoecological surveys based on mixed sampling were performed. In terms of area, reforestation (after planting) reached about 6 500 ha in 1987 and 7985 ha in 2003 while in 2016 it reached 8500 ha, occupying nearly one third of the total study area. Nevertheless, crops, especially in areas where reforestation has declined, are increasing. Phytosanitary status is a concern but natural forests seem less affected with 1.2 nests per tree in natural forest and 1.85 in reforestation. The comparison between original and reforested forest formations shows that biodiversity is greater in natural forests and the difference between reforestation areas and natural forest decrease with time. The similarity index between the natural forest and reforestation areas for the year 2002 is estimated at 63% reaching 76% in 2018 for perennial species. The most notable changes are observed in the nearby steppe, which is undergoing advanced degradation. The crops which occupied only 1.29% of the study area in the beginning of the study currently cover 12% of the territory. This work shows that reforestation has relatively maintained their original areas, although crops areas are growing. Contrariwise, the phytosanitary quality and the biodiversity of the reforestation areas are less satisfactory compared to natural ones. The rangelands are Vol. 75 | No. 4/ undergone deep changes, which weaken their long-term future and question the survival of livestock farming in these zones.\n\nThe study of climate impacts takes on an importance in scientific research, particularly on water resources. The present study highlights the situation of the capacity of Foum El Gherza dam in relation to the observed climate changes. Located in an arid zone of south-eastern Algeria, this dam is a typical example of a region fragile to climate variability. The methodology adopted in this work is based on the analysis of the evolution of the climatic parameters (precipitation and evaporation) as well as the hydrological parameters (flow yields, and leaks) in relation to the losses of stored water volume of the studied dam. The monthly values of climatic and hydrological data contain a 60-year time series (1950 to 2010). The results obtained show that the losses in capacity coincide with the negative trend of precipitation. Thus, a significant upward trend in evaporation is responsible for the decline in the volumes of water stored within the dam. The correlation analysis expresses th...\n\nDams impose changes of flow and sediment transfer that drive changes of channel form along the downstream regulated river. These changes have been described for more than 50 years but process-form relationships have only been advanced with the establishment of a conceptual framework during the 1970s, and then the extension of monitoring data and advancement of remote sensing technologies, particularly over the past 20 years. This paper reviews these developments and identifies three influential themes: (i) channel dynamics, (ii) the role of riparian vegetation, and (iii) channel change as the driver of ecological change. Changes can be rapid in semi-arid regions but elsewhere relaxation periods may extend to millenia. In these latter cases regime or steady-state models should be replaced by models of transient states applied to the reach scale in order to respond to the needs of river managers over decadal timescales.\n\nThe Bouhouda's dam was built on Oued Sra, a tributary on the right bank of Ouergha wadi, about 18 km in the north of Taounate town. The waters of this dam are mainly intended for irrigation and drinking water supply (Ministry of town planning and urban planning, 2014). The aim of this paper is to study the quality and the spatio-temporal evolution of the physicochemical of this dam waters parameters of over a period of eight years (2000/2008) in order to have a better knowledge of the mechanisms and the factors that condition the eutrophication of this lake. A classification has been established based on the Carlson index (1977) (Trophic State Index or TSI) and the Vollenweider index (1968), to identify the trophic state of the reservoir waters. Accordingly, these results can be used for decision support in the context of sustainable development of several nearby dams in the Sbou Basin."
