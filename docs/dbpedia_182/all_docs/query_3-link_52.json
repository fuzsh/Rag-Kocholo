It constitutes an indispensable method to achieve the principle of sustainable development. The Atlas cedar exists in a spontaneous state in North Africa: Algeria and Morocco (BOUDY, 1955). In Algeria, we find it in central and eastern regions in different bioclimatic situations where the surface covered by cedar is very limited and disjointed (BENTOUATI, 2008). Its surface has further decreased (QUÉZEL, 1998), and Rabhi et al. (2018) announce 33,000 hectares.\n\nThe Atlas cedar has always attracted great interest as an important species given its ecological importance and numerous forestry qualities, such as low flammability, production of high-quality wood, and resistance to climatic stress and drought (RABHI et al., 2018). Despite its significant ecological value, this species is subject to degradation. This condition leads the entire forest, with its progressively thinning tree layers, to evolve towards a plant structure of the preforest and maquis type (QUÉZEL, 1998) and may even reach a steppe-like state in the case of total degradation (EL BAKKALI, 2020). The causes of this phenomenon are linked to climatic disturbances (drought, water stress, Saharan influence), the nature of certain substrates with low water retention capacity (BENTOUATI; BARITEAU, 2006), and finally, anthropogenic actions manifested through overgrazing, uncontrolled exploitation, and illegal cutting and collecting.\n\nOur study focuses on a biodiversity assessment and spatial distribution of the cedar flora in the Djebel Maadid forest (Djebel in Arabic means Mountain) in the southern Bordj-Bou-Arreridj province (Northeastern Algeria). This aims to evaluate the ecological conditions for plant protection and conservation by conducting an inventory and proposing a method to protect the existing flora.Haut du formulaire\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nStudy area and prospecting sites\n\nThe study area is situated in the Bordj-Bou-Arreridj province in Northeastern Algeria. Its territory is positioned between the high plains in the North and the Tellian Atlas Mountains in the South. Our study specifically focuses on the southern part of the Bordj-Bou-Arreridj province, precisely in the mountainous region of Djebel Maadid. This area is located southeast of Ghafsitane village in the El Ach locality and southwest of Ouled Aissa village in the Rabta locality (Figure 1).\n\nThe prevailing climate in the area is subhumid, characterized by cold winters. Annual precipitation averages around 470 mm at an altitude of 1600 m (Bordj-Bou-Arreridj Meteorological Station). The soil in the cedar forest grove is skeletal, with common rock outcroppings. It predominantly rests on marl-limestone and dolomite limestone.\n\nSampling\n\nFor the flora inventory at Djebel Maadid, we employed a non-probability mixed sampling approach, incorporating both subjective and systematic sampling methods (ZEDAM, 2015; ZEDAM; FENNI, 2021; MERABTI et al., 2022). In our case, we based our approach on the characteristics of the vegetation facets in the cedar forest (physiognomy). The surveys were conducted during the spring-summer season in May-July 2021. We utilized the minimum area method (GUINOCHET, 1973), which determines the area required for a floristic sample (LACOSTE, SALANON, 2005). This methodology has been applied by various authors, such as Hammada (2007) in the study of Morocco’s wetlands vegetation; Hamel et al. (2013) regarding the rare and endemic vascular flora of the Edough peninsula (Northeastern Algeria); Zedam (2015) focusing on endemic flora in the Chott El Hodna wetland (North Algeria); Zedam; Fenni (2021) in an advanced research on vascular flora in the highlands of Algeria; Larbi et al. (2021) concerning the floristic and phytogeographical diversity of a cedar forest in Djurdjura (North Algeria); and Souahi et al. (2022) exploring the variation in plant diversity along a watershed in a semi-arid region (Northeastern Algeria).\n\nFigure 1 – Study area of Djebel Maadid.\n\nFor each encountered species in any survey, we assigned a semi-quantitative coefficient using the abundance-dominance scale (BRAUN-BLANQUET et al., 1952; GILLET, 2000). The Braun-Blanquet et al. (1952) scale is as follows: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, and +. The sample areas varied from 200 to 400 m2, as recommended for forestry groups according to Guinochet (1973), Géhu; Rivas-Martinez (1981), Ozenda (1982) and Meddour (2011).\n\nThe surveys were conducted based on topographical factors and the relative means of determination, including latitude, altitude, and longitude determined by GPS, along with exposure established by a compass.\n\nAll encountered species were identified using references such as the new flora of Algeria and southerly desert regions by Quézel, Santa (1962; 1963); flora of the Sahara by Ozenda (2004); synonymic index of the North Africa flora by Dobignard; Chatelain (2010-2013) and the database “Euro + MedPlantbase” available at https://www.emplantbase.org/. The taxa nomenclature follows the International Plant Names Index (IPNI, 2023) available at https://www.ipni.org/. Geographic distribution areas (chorology) were determined using the cited floras, and species life-forms were defined by Raunkiaer (1934), with additional determination through in-situ observations according to Emberger (1966). Voucher specimens were deposited at the laboratory of Biodiversity and Biotechnological Techniques for the Vegetal Resources Valorization at Mohamed BOUDIAF University, M’Sila – Algeria.\n\nData management and numerical analysis\n\nAfter presenting the survey characteristics, our data analysis initially focused on an overview of floristic analysis (taxonomic richness, chorology, and life-forms), followed by an assessment of the disturbance degree. For these analyses, we utilized the Excel for Windows 2013 software. The disturbance degree for a vegetal community is expressed by the perturbation index (PI), as defined by Loisel, Gomila (1993) and applied by many authors to understand and quantify the impact of anthropogenic actions on floristic diversity. Its value takes into account the existing number of two life-form species: therophyte and chamaephyte, as follows (1):\n\n(1)\n\nFinally, a numerical analysis focused on the Sørensen-Dice’s similarity index and detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) was conducted using the free program Paleontological Statistics (PAST), version 4.13. The distribution of the cedar’s samples and the flora zones conservation were performed by using arcGIS program – Version 10.2 (ESRI).\n\nIt’s important to note that in these analyses, we operated using binary data for the encountered species, as outlined by Zedam, Fenni (2021), Marcon (2022) and Hammer (2023). Similarly, for group comparisons, opposing evaluation, and intelligent automation and soft computing, the similarity analysis was employed following the methods of Shah et al. (2023) and Gnanakumari, Vijayalakshmi (2023).\n\nNote that the binary data for the species were obtained by converting the abundance-dominance, which is a semi-quantitative coefficient attributed to the species encountered in the samples, into a qualitative coefficient indicating presence or absence (GILLET, 2000).\n\nResults and discussion\n\nSurveys characteristics\n\nAfter exploring our region, we conducted 30 samples with altitudes ranging from 1510 m to 1830 m. We carried out an inventory of the entire vascular flora present in each sample (Table 1).\n\nTable 1 -Surveys characteristics of Djebel Maadid cedar forest\n\nSamples\n\nExposure\n\nLatitude North (°)\n\nLongitude East (°)\n\nAltitude (m)\n\nSamples\n\nExposure\n\nLatitude North (°)\n\nLongitude East (°)\n\nAltitude (m)\n\nR1\n\nNorth\n\n35,8694\n\n4,7520\n\n1580\n\nR16\n\nNorth\n\n35,8675\n\n4,7499\n\n1630\n\nR2\n\nNorth\n\n35,8685\n\n4,7507\n\n1600\n\nR17\n\nNorth\n\n35,8664\n\n4,7521\n\n1670\n\nR3\n\nWest\n\n35,8620\n\n4,7443\n\n1780\n\nR18\n\nNorth\n\n35,8667\n\n4,7542\n\n1690\n\nR4\n\nWest\n\n35,8630\n\n4,7386\n\n1630\n\nR19\n\nNorth\n\n35,8687\n\n4,7496\n\n1590\n\nR5\n\nEast\n\n35,8685\n\n4,7564\n\n1630\n\nR20\n\nNorth\n\n35,8672\n\n4,7530\n\n1650\n\nR6\n\nEast\n\n35,8643\n\n4,7341\n\n1540\n\nR21\n\nNorth\n\n35,8677\n\n4,7515\n\n1630\n\nR7\n\nEast\n\n35,8667\n\n4,7675\n\n1760\n\nR22\n\nNorth\n\n35,8660\n\n4,7500\n\n1690\n\nR8\n\nEast\n\n35,8627\n\n4,7478\n\n1830\n\nR23\n\nNorth\n\n35,8652\n\n4,7506\n\n1690\n\nR9\n\nEast\n\n35,8704\n\n4,7597\n\n1650\n\nR24\n\nWest\n\n35,8646\n\n4,7407\n\n1690\n\nR10\n\nEast\n\n35,8718\n\n4,7589\n\n1600\n\nR25\n\nWest\n\n35,8649\n\n4,7443\n\n1750\n\nR11\n\nEast\n\n35,8719\n\n4,7591\n\n1630\n\nR26\n\nWest\n\n35,8631\n\n4,7449\n\n1800\n\nR12\n\nEast\n\n35,8673\n\n4,7588\n\n1630\n\nR27\n\nWest\n\n35,8619\n\n4,7451\n\n1800\n\nR13\n\nEast\n\n35,8703\n\n4,7624\n\n1690\n\nR28\n\nWest\n\n35,8643\n\n4,7422\n\n1740\n\nR14\n\nEast\n\n35,8662\n\n4,7325\n\n1510\n\nR29\n\nWest\n\n35,8627\n\n4,7420\n\n1720\n\nR15\n\nEast\n\n35,8614\n\n4,7334\n\n1670\n\nR30\n\nWest\n\n35,8591\n\n4,7396\n\n1670\n\nOur surveys are depicted in the studied area map (Figure 2), where the exploration covered homogeneous forest areas. In these areas, samples were collected and the existing flora was collected.\n\nFigure 2 – Cedar’s samples of Djebel Maadid.\n\nFloristic analysis\n\n2.1.Taxonomic richness\n\nThe results revealed that the samples yielded 108 species, belonging to over 91 genera and 34 botanical families. The majority of families, seven in total, encompass more than 65% (71 species) of the entire flora: Asteraceae (22 species), Brassicaceae (12 species), Poaceae (10 species), Apiaceae (08 species), Lamiaceae (07 species), Caryophyllaceae, and Fabaceae (06 species each). The remaining families each have between 1 to 3 species.\n\nIn this context, Quézel (1964) noted that the most significant family in the Algerian flora is Asteraceae, which aligns with our results. Additionally, we observe that twenty families are singleton; meaning they are represented by a single species per family (MAGURRAN, 2005).\n\n2.2. Chorology\n\nIf we consider the Mediterranean element in its broad sense, the species encountered in our study amount to 53, representing more than 49% of the total flora. The remaining species are from other origins, numerically less significant. The Transition group comprises 36 species (33.33%), while the Nordic and Cosmopolitan groups each have 15 (13.89%) and 04 species (3.70%), respectively.\n\nThe dominance of the Mediterranean origin, as observed in our study, has been reported in numerous works conducted in neighboring regions. For example, Guechi (2022) focused on floristic and ethnobotanical studies in the Maadid mountains of M’Sila, Yaici (2020) conducted research on medicinal plants in the Sétif Tell region (East Algeria), Bounab (2020) explored plant diversity in the Hodna region of M’Sila, and Sedjar (2012) studied biodiversity and vegetation dynamics in the extreme East of the Hodna Mountains in the Boutaleb forest ecosystem (Sétif).\n\nFinally, it is important to note that the most xeric cedar forests in Algeria, such as the cedars of Aurès, Belezma, and Hodna, are situated in the Mauretanian Steppe Domain, where rainfall is very irregular and varies from 450 to 950 mm (YAHI et al., 2008).\n\n2.3. Life-form\n\nThe results of our species life-form are grouped as follows: Therophyte “Th” (46 species), Hemicryptophyte “He” (29 species), Chamaephyte “Ch” (14 species), Phanerophyte “Ph” (10 species), and Geophyte “Ge” (09 species). The most dominant life form is the therophyte, representing more than 42% of all species. The less represented life-forms are the Phanerophyte and the Geophyte.\n\nThe distribution of life-forms in the Djebel Maadid area follows the pattern: Th > He > Ch > Ph > Ge. However, in the main forest of the studied cedar’s stations (Tellian and Saharan Atlas), as reported by Yahi et al. (2008), the pattern is: He > Th > Ch > Ph > Ge. The dominance of the life-forms Therophyte and Hemicryptophyte in our case study aligns with the findings of Beghami et al. (2013) in their work on thuriferous Juniper (Juniperus thurifera L.) in the Aurès area (Algeria), specifically concerning the species of the forestry community Cedar-Thuriferous Juniper localized at high altitudes. This observation reflects the specific characteristics of the species and the prevailing ecological conditions in our study area:\n\nSpecies requirements and plant growth: temperature necessities, moisture availability, altitude and soil depth.\n\nAnthropogenic activities: trampling, overgrazing, harvesting of interest plants, habitat loss and conversion, degradation and fragmentation of lands, fires and wild camping, and illegal logging.\n\nThe state of the community, characterized as having sylvatic physiognomy (BEGHAMI et al., 2013), being semi-open, or appearing degraded, offers valuable insights into the health and resilience of the ecosystem. Degradation may indicate the impact of anthropogenic activities or environmental stressors.\n\nThe observations reported by Yahi et al. (2008) regarding the high frequency of therophytes in Algerian cedar forests, indicating disturbance through activities like clearing and grazing, are notable. This dominance of the therophyte life-form is often seen as an adaptive response in arid areas, as noted by Negre (1966). This fact translates the aridity of the environment, as highlighted by Negadi et al. (2014). Zedam (2015) explains the abundance of “therophytes” reflecting a pioneer stage linked to the climate. The prevalence of therophytes serves as an ecological indicator of human activities and local climatic conditions. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for formulating effective conservation and management strategies for these unique ecosystems.\n\nIn the Hodna Mountains and nearby areas, the dominance of the therophytes is apparent. This state has been reported by many authors as Kaabeche (1990); Sedjar (2012); Zedam (2015); Bounab (2020); Yaici (2020) and Zedam; Fenni (2021).\n\nPerturbation index\n\nThe Perturbation Index (PI) is a measure that depends on the number of therophytes and chamaephytes, providing a quantification of therophytization in an environment (LOISEL, GAMILA, 1993). In our case study, with 46 therophytes and 14 chamaephytes, the calculated PI is 55.56%.This value is higher compared to the works of Beghami et al. (2013) : PI= 55,26 to 61,86 % for the degraded formations and 28,13 to 45,50 % for the least ones; Bounab (2020): PI= 57,75 ± 1,48 %; Yaici (2020) and Guechi (2022) gave each a PI = 40%; and finally Larbi et al. (2021): PI= 27%. These differences may be explain the local conditions, the management practices, and the ecological contexts.\n\nWhen the perturbation index (PI) is higher, the plant group is more degraded and results from a high proportion of identified therophytic and chamaephytic species. This state reflects the opening of plant formations (HEBRARD et al., 1995; BELHACINI et al., 2016) hence a lesser representation of sizeable perennial species, in this case the phanerophytes (sylvatic formation). This fact reveals, in first an anthropogenic pressure on the vegetation (QUÉZEL, BARBERO, 1990), and on the other the drought which affects negatively the environment and reflects degradation and biodiversity loss (MULUNEH, 2021).\n\nNumerical analysis\n\n4.1. Sørensen-Dice’s similarity index\n\nThe similarity, with values ranging from 0 to 1, shows the possible link or connections between species groups (MARCON, 2022) or to compare associations (HAMMER et al., 2001). A high similarity value suggests that two groups share a similar floristic composition or ecological conditions (WALTER, 2006). Our analysis shows two distinct groups labeled as “1” and “2” (Figure 3). Each group may have high similaritiy in floristic composition or the same ecological characteristics that distinguish it from the other.\n\nFigure 3 – Samples similarity of Djebel Maadid cedar forest.\n\nThe first group (1) comprises samples with values exceeding 0.50, extending well beyond. These samples include: R1, R2, R16, R17, R18, R19, R20, R21, R22, and R23. This state indicates a strong similarity within this group (KOLEFF et al., 2003; MARCON, 2022). The group occupies a microclimate area protected to the east and west by high-altitude ridge lines and faces northward. This positioning results in significant rainfall and cool winters. It’s worth noting that Zedam (1991) has identified this part of the forest as belonging to the highest class of wood production. These areas of the samples can play a crucial role in conserving plant biodiversity, particularly given the existing threat in the cedar forest, primarily from overgrazing.\n\nThe second group (2), more numerous and highly heterogeneous. Basyuni, Jayusman (2019) highlight that the cluster analysis considers species variation, serving as an ecological indicator for the community. This group comprises samples with lower similarity compared to the first group, recording values below 0.40. Noteworthy samples in this group include: R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R9, R10, R11, R12, R13, R14, R15, R24, R25, R26, R27, R28, R29, and R30. The samples are situated in areas with two exposures (East and West) and are located in an overgrazed region. In one part, they rest on rocky and superficial terrain, while in the other, they receive less precipitation and experience cold winters. According to Zedam (1991), this part of the forest falls into two wood production zones: the east area in the moderately productive class and the west area in the least productive one.\n\n4.2. Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA)\n\nAs stipulated by Cano et al. (2019), the Figure 4 below indicates the presence of two “Species-Samples” groups.\n\nFigure 4 – DCA ordination of samples and species of Djebel Maadid cedar forest.\n\nThis occurrence arises from the characteristic species associated with each group (FENNANE, 1988). The first group (A) encompasses the following samples: R1, R2, R16, R17, R18, R19, R20, R21, R22, and R23, featuring species dependent on ecologically specific stations. The floristic composition of this group is specialized and belongs to sylvatic physiognomy, including species such as Daphne laureola L., Viola munbyana Boiss. et Reut., and Phlomis bovei de Noé. These species indicate a humid atmosphere and fairly deep soil (MEDIOUNI, YAHI, 1989), as specified by Zedam (1991), this part of the forest provides potential conditions for the cedar’s trees to yield more wood production than other areas. On the other hand, Solomou et al. (2023) note that Bellis sylvestris Cirillo characterizes a state of ecological condition in which it adapts to grow in well-lit but also partially shaded positions, as well as in habitats with moderate nutrient availability. Additionally, Karahan (2020) reports that the genus “Bellis” colonizes moist habitats, often localized in forests. This group of samples is considered a sylvatic set, where its species are relatively more preserved from overgrazing and human aggression.\n\nThe second group (B) of “Species-Samples” comprises the samples: R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R9, R10, R11, R12, R13, R14, R15, R24, R25, R26, R27, R28, R29, and R30, where particular species are encountered, exhibiting unique ecology in response to altitude variation. This group can be divided into two subgroups: B1 and B2. Subgroup B1, including the samples R5, R6, R7, R8, R9, R10, R11, R12, R13, R14, and R15, forms two smaller subgroups, all oriented towards the East. The first is located in the eastern study area with the samples R5, R7, R8, R9, R10, R11, R12, and R13; the other includes the samples R6, R14, and R15 situated in the western part of the study area. Firstly, this subgroup contains forest species such as Bupleurum montanum Coss. & Durieu, an endemic species that is threatened and requires urgent protection, as suggested by Bounar et al. (2021). Rhamnus alaternus L., a sclerophyll shrub characterizing Mediterranean evergreen oak woodland, is mentioned by Ciccarelli et al. (2016). Sambucus ebulus L., a species indicating disturbed areas, is highlighted by Fanelli et al. (2008). Secondly, there are ruderal-weed species like Hordeum murinum L., identified by Baghestani et al. (2008) as a problematic weed affecting cereal crops, and Muscari comosum (L.) Mill., a perennial weed in North Africa. Haliniarz et al. (2021) considered it an endangered species in Poland. This subgroup is regarded as a sylvatic set, with its area subject to various forms of human aggression.\n\nThe subgroup B2 includes species typically considered as weeds and those specific to a particular ecosystem. These species are found in the following samples: R3, R4, R24, R25, R26, R27, R28, R29, and R30, all oriented toward the West exposure.\n\nAmong the weed species, Senecio vulgaris L. is encountered, occurring in both ruderal and agricultural habitats (LEISS; MÜLLER-SCHÄRER, 2001). Eryngium campestre L. is considered a problem for pastoral value in Baicoi, Romania, as noted by Jalobã et al. (2018). Regarding Bromus tectorum L., it is identified as a winter annual invasive species in the Great Basin site (USA) by Bradford; Lauenroth (2006). Lastly, Erodium cicutarium (L.) L’Hér. requires weed management due to its invasive potential of lands (HIEN LE et al., 2021).\n\nFinally, species dependent on a particular ecosystem at high altitude, often open or semi-open with groves of sylvatic physiognomy, include Erinacea anthyllis Link and Bupleurum spinosum Gouan, identified as spiny xerophytic plants by Taleb; Fennane (2016). Juniperus oxycedrus L., reported by Cano-Ortiz et al. (2021), is a shrub found in dry, sunny, and rocky environments. This subgroup is considered a sub-sylvatic set, with its area subject to overgrazing.\n\nThe figure 4 allows us to observe three ecological gradients concerning executive samples, encountered species, and characteristics of the prospect areas. The first gradient is humidity, increasing from subgroup B2, situated in the west exposure, to group A, located in the north exposure. The second gradient is altitude, ascending from group A at low altitude (with an altitudinal average of 1642 m) and subgroup B1 at moderate altitude (with an altitudinal average exceeding 1649 m) to subgroup B2, found at high altitude (with an altitudinal average exceeding 1731 m). The last gradient is temperature, decreasing from group A to group B, which encompasses the high-altitude areas.Haut du formulaire\n\nPerspective of plant conservation\n\nThe analysis of plant distribution in the study area and the ecological characteristics of the corresponding samples reveals three areas of plant biodiversity that strive to be preserved from overgrazing, human aggression, and other negative impacts (figures 5, 6).\n\nFigure 5 – Flora zones to preserve in Djebel Maadid cedar forest.\n\nZone I: Center of the studied area\n\nZone II a: East of the studied area\n\nZone II b: West of the studied area\n\nZone III: Center West of the studied area\n\nFigure 6 – Forest zones in Djebel Maadid cedar forest (Photos: Radjai, 2022).\n\nThese forest zones of flora are delimited, illustrated, and characterized as follows:\n\nZone I: This central zone of the studied area is oriented to the North. It features a sylvatic physiognomy, with its species predominantly found in this part rather than others. These species are relatively more preserved from human pressure due to the challenging access to this area, attributed to the North-South orientation cliffs situated in the East and West, along with the dense green oak scrub located at the bottom (North side). In this context, Angelstam et al. (2023) assert that biodiversity conservation can be achieved by establishing protected forest areas. This zone can play a role as a promoter of plant species to the bordering zones.\n\nZone II: It is situated in the East (Zone IIa) and West (Zone IIb) of the studied area. This zone exhibits a sylvatic physiognomy, with its exposure oriented to the East, and its area is subjected to anthropogenic activities. It is crucial to acknowledge that among the threats to biodiversity, the loss of “habitat” is associated with human activity (VERMA et al., 2020). In this zone, we propose to prioritize preservation initially and subsequently advocate for overgrazing regulation in specific areas, especially those identified as vulnerable.\n\nZone III: A final zone located in the center-west with a west orientation. The surveyed area exhibits a sub-sylvatic physiognomy on one hand, and on the other, it is often open or semi-open with groves of sylvatic physiognomy growing on a soil that is frequently skeletal, with rocks outcropping. The local biodiversity in this area is susceptible to overgrazing and human aggression. It’s important to note that overgrazing, defined as the disrespect for the animal load, leads to the loss of plant protection from climate aggressiveness, and land use practices are also considered partial causes of biodiversity loss (SOULÉ, 1991). The floral richness of this zone and its biotope must be urgently preserved to ensure its sustainability because conservation of biodiversity in such environments will result in protected areas that welcome and maintain unmodified sites (SERGIO; PEDRINI, 2007). As recommended by Shaheen et al. (2023), for effective in-situ conservation, it is necessary to establish wild nurseries to retain the potential of threatened plants in their natural habitats initially and then plan future reforestation to create the desired forest atmosphere.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe vascular flora inventory in the study area of the cedar forest at Djebel Maadid, situated in the southern Bordj-Bou-Arreridj province and at the Northern face of the Hodna Mountains (North Algeria), encompassed 30 samples, revealing a total richness of 108 species, with the Asteraceae family dominating. This flora is chorologically linked to the Mediterranean origin and appears to be dominated by the therophyte life-form, indicating a higher perturbation index and revealing anthropogenic pressure along with other factors such as drought. Numerical data analysis of this flora delineates two broad sets of plant samples, showcasing different environmental states related to temperature and humidity in relation to altitude, and linked to the characteristics of the samples. The special and characteristic species, along with the richness rate encountered in plant-sample groups, especially in subgroups, identified three areas. The first is considered a sylvatic set, relatively more preserved from human pressure. The second is characterized as a sylvatic set subjected to anthropogenic activities, and the last is categorized as a sub-sylvatic set, susceptible to overgrazing and human aggression.\n\nTo conserve the entire existing flora in-situ, the first and second areas (if the second is rapidly preserved from negative impacts) can serve as promoters, upholders, and invaders of neighboring areas with their richness and special species. The third area must be shielded from anthropogenic activities. Effective management practices should be implemented to ensure their continued existence and sustainability for future generations.\n\nInterest conflicts\n\nThere was no conflict of interest between the authors.\n\nAuthors’ contributions\n\nAll authors contributed equally for this work.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe are very much grateful to Dr. D.
