        "text": "This paper presents the first quantitative ethnobotanical study of the flora in the semi-arid region in the southwest part of Algeria. The aim of this ethnobotanical survey in the region of El Bayadh situated in the semi-arid part of Algeria was to identify the main medicinal plants used by the local inhabitants to treat different diseases and to collect all the data on their therapeutic characteristics. One hundred informants of different ages were interviewed for this study (69 women and 31 men). Both quantitative and qualitative information were collected through open semi-structured face-to-face interviews with the local people. Data were organized and analyzed by descriptive statistics. The ethnobotanical data were analyzed using various important quantitative indices calculated for each of the recorded medicinal plant species like use value (UV), relative frequency of citation (RFC), relative importance index (RII), informants’ agreement ratio (IAR), informant consensus factor...\n\nSummary Ethnobotanical studies gather pure information that can be used to support scientific research. Traditional remedies are considered as an alternative tool to chemical treatments in health care. This study aims to investigate the knowledge of spontaneous medicinal plant used by healers and elderly people. Moreover, it focuses on consensus level estimation of used medicinal plants. An exhaustive survey was carried out in the region of Djelfa in Algeria. The information was gathered from 43 informants who responded to structured questionnaire. Survey data were quantitatively characterized by five indices, namely; relative frequency citation, medicinal use-value, family use-value, informant consensus factor and fidelity level. In the current study, 51 species belonging to 28 botanical families were recorded and 185 uses and 58 diseases were described as well. Most recipes used a single species; however, some preparations were used as a species mixture. This specific preparation ...\n\nThe local plant resources adapted to the desert harsh geomorphologicl environment are a landmark that characterizes the Saharan region: erg, dunes, and wadis. This work emphasizes on some results obtained through a study conducted in 2011, based on surveys and field observations in the Tidikelt oases (in Salah, wilaya of Tamanrasset) which is implanted in the south of Algeria. The objective was the study of traditional herbal medicine using the spontaneous medicinal herbs, which constitute one of the socio-cultural aspects of Saharan society in Algeria. Traditional medicine is one reflect of the knowledge and how to live of the local population. Desert people know the various herbs ‘Acheb’, and its nomenclature. They indicated their site or places of local presence, as well as its own peculiarities and their uses. Our goal is to contribute to enhancing the interest of valorization of these plants in the therapeutic and eventually industrial uses. For that, we need to integrate this perspective into local economic development policies valuing the diversity of plant resources from Tidikelt in the Algerian Sahara.\n\nAbstract: Context: M’sila city occupies a privileged position in the central part of northern Algeria. The climate of this area is continental, subject in part to the Saharan influences of which vegetation is steppic. Aims: Highlight traditional usage of plants despite environmental characteristics. Methods: An ethnobotanical survey in the city of M’sila was conducted during the period 2011-2012 in collaboration with traditional practitioners, herbalists and healers. A total of 85 adults were able to determine the species and answer questions about the traditional use of plants in artisanal processing, nutritional and medicinal domains. Results: Medicinal plants recorded in the city of M’sila were 36 divided into 16 families and 31 genera. Lamiaceae family predominates (27.8%), followed by Asteraceae (13.9%). Leaves are the most frequently used (27.4%), the aerial parts (18.5%) and thus the seeds (16.3%). It appears that the population is highly dependent on these plants that allow them to treat different pathologies (digestive, stomach, diarrhea, constipation, vomiting) with a percentage (18.6%), carminative (5.7%) and antidiabetic (12.2%). In general, the remedies are administered orally. Indeed, therapeutic use forms are: the tisane or decoction (44.7%), infusion (27.1%) and powder (12.2%). Conclusions: The ethnobotanical survey conducted among traditional healers, herbalists and healers in the M’sila city has created an inventory of 36 species and a database that collected all the information on local and traditional therapeutic applications as well as all the diseases treated. ******************************************************************************** Resumen: Contexto: La ciudad de M’sila ocupa una posición privilegiada en la parte central del norte de Argelia. El clima de esta zona es de tipo continental, con la influencia del Sahara, y la vegetación es de estepa. Objetivos: Destacar el uso tradicional de las plantas, a pesar de las características ambientales. Métodos: Un estudio etnobotánico se llevó a cabo en la ciudad de M’sila durante el período 2011-2012, en colaboración con los médicos tradicionales, herbalistas y curanderos. Un total de 85 adultos fueron capaces de determinar las especies y responder preguntas sobre el uso tradicional de las plantas en procesos artesanales y los dominios nutricionales y medicinales. Resultados: Las plantas medicinales registradas fueron 36, divididas en 16 familias y 31 géneros. La famílias más utilizadas son Lamiaceae (27,4%), seguida de Asteraceae (13,9%). Las partes de las plantas más utilizadas son las hojas (27,4%), las partes aéreas (18,5%) y después las semillas (16,3%). Al parecer la población es muy dependiente de estas plantas. El 18,6% manifestó que les permiten el tratamiento de diferentes patologías (digestivas, estomacales, diarrea, estreñimiento, vómitos), carminativo (5,7%) y antidiabético (12,2%). En general, los remedios se administran por vía oral. Las formas de uso terapéutico más usadas son: la tisana o decocción (44,7%), La infusión (27,1%) y el polvo (12,2%). Conclusiones: El estudio etnobotánico realizado entre los curanderos tradicionales, herbalistas y sanadores en la ciudad M’sila ha creado un inventario de 36 especies y una base de datos que recoge toda la información sobre las aplicaciones terapéuticas locales y tradicionales, así como todas las enfermedades tratadas."
