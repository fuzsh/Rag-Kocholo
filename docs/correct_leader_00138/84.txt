Pedro Verona Rodrigues Pires GColIH (São Filipe, Fogo, April 29, 1934) is a Cape Verdean politician and president of his country since March 22, 2001.

Pedro Pires studied at the University of Lisbon and there he met the future leaders of the liberation movements that fought for the independence of the Portuguese colonies. With the beginning of the armed struggle in Angola in 1961, he left Portugal for Guinea-Bissau. There, until the Carnation Revolution, he fought for independence and, after it, was the representative of Cape Verde in negotiations with Portugal.

After the Declaration of Independence of Cape Verde on July 5, 1975, he was appointed Prime Minister of the Prime Government of the Republic of Cape Verde, alongside President Aristides Pereira who had founded the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde with Amílcar Cabral. Pedro Pires remained in the position of Prime Minister until 1991, when — by his initiative, along with others — the multi-party system was introduced in the country and the MpD-Movement for Democracy, by Carlos Veiga, got the majority of votes.

In 2001, he finally presented himself as a presidential candidate against Carlos Veiga and won the elections with only 17 votes. On March 22, 2001, he was sworn in as successor to António Mascarenhas Monteiro.

He received the Grand Collar of the Order of Infante D. Henrique of Portugal on April 22, 2002.
