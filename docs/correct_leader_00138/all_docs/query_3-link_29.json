        "text": "(Another excuse for The Office) 👀 Recognition. People love receiving positive feedback. After all, who doesn't enjoy being praised? I, however, confess that more than receiving, I love giving positive feedback. As I'm sometimes seen as grumpy (especially in the mornings), when I give such compliments, everyone knows I'm being sincere. 😂 I'll never do it because I feel pressured (lol, that's not me) and much less to expect anything in return (oh, pride!). However, it always brings me joy to do so for people I 𝐜𝐚𝐫𝐞* about. Today, my recognition goes to three leaders who played a huge role in helping me reach where I am now. Each, in their own way, shaped me, and each had to have a lot of patience for my more analytical and critical side. 😅 To Bryan Horrocks, the first to believe in me in the UK, who made me realize that I could also achieve my full potential in a language and country that are not my native ones. To Stephen Davidson, who taught me everything I know today about stakeholder management and was a tremendous support during the most difficult moment of my personal life (when I lost my dad). To Tom H., who is an excellent people manager and an even better human being, always caring about me and my family even after we stopped working together. Thank you all 🙌 *I'm beginning to suspect that I got this job because I might have mentioned this TC value (𝐜𝐚𝐫𝐞) quite a bit during the interviews. Sarah Lloyd-Foster Assoc CIPD, can you confirm this? 🤣"
