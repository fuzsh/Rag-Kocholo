        "text": "Cape Verde(Cabo Verde) By: Czarina Kristine G. Vasquez 316B\n\nBasic Information • Culture Name: Cape Verdean • Capital: Praia • Official language: Portuguese/ Creole • President: Pedro Pires • Prime Minister: Jose Maria Neves • Monetary Unit: Cape Verdean Escudo • Unique mixture of European and African elements\n\nHistory • The Slave Coast: 15th - 19th century AD • Colonial rule: AD 1886-1874 • Independence: from AD 1974-1975\n\nPerforming Arts, Music and Dance • Cape Verdean Cultural Center in Praia • Music and dance are a focal point of Cape Verdean culture. • “funana”- played on an accordion and an iron bar that serves as a rhythm instrument. • “batuque”- performed by a circle of men and women who beat out rhythms on plastic sacks held between their legs. • “morna”- slower, more Portuguese-influenced ballad.\n\nHandicrafts • “pano”- cloth made with classic African narrow strip weaving technique - made on simple weaving chairs - always made of six narrow strips 3 Main Types: • panochã • panobicho • panod´obra\n\nIndustry and Business • Miningmakes a negligible contribution to the economy. • Salt is the most important mined resource in Cape Verde. • Manufacturing, though slowly expanding, is quite small and underdeveloped. -shoemaking, fish canning, rum distilling, textiles, and beverage bottling\n\nAgriculture • Although agriculture and fishing only accounted for 13 percent of GDP in 1998, it was still a significant source of employment. • The most important crops are sugarcane, maize, and beans, while cash crops like bananas, pineapples, and coffee are being encouraged. • Agriculture has been affected by an unequal land-holding system, overpopulation of cultivable land, and the excessive subdivision of plots. • Fishing accounted for 2 percent of GDP in 1998 and is an important source of foreign currency.\n\nEducation • Education is mandatory and free between the ages of seven and fourteen. • Primary school is free for children ages 6 to 12. • Each island has a high school that goes through at least eleventh grade. • In 1997, the gross primary enrollment rate was 148.8 percent. • Primary school attendance rates were unavailable for Cape Verde as of 2001.\n\nTextbooks have been made available to 90 percent of school children, and 83 percent of the teachers have attended in-service teacher training. • The Republic of Cape Verde has a Ministry of Education, Science, Youth and Sports. • The school year runs from October to July. • Schooling is free, universal, and compulsory for students aged 7 to 13; however, attendance is not enforced. • Early schooling enrollment rates exceed 90 percent, but dropout rates are high and later schooling is not well attended.\n\nPrior to 1987, schooling consisted of the first six years of instruçãoprimária (primary education) and a escolapreparatória (middle school) of three years. After middle school, two tracks were possible: a three-year track leading to a CursoComplementar do EnsinoTecnico (Certificate of the Completion of General Technical Education) or a two year pre-university course leading to a CursoComplementar dos Liceus (Certificate of the Completion of a Lycee).\n\nIn 1987 the middle school was abolished and instruçãoprimária (primary education) became a single six-year cycle. Secondary education became a single five-year stage with two cycles: a three-year general track followed by two-year pre-university preparation, successful completion of which leads to a CursoComplementar do EnsínoSecondario (Certificate of the Completion of Secondary Education). • Cape Verde has no university.\n\nOutside influences also impact Cape Verde education. For example, the World Bank and its arm, the International Development Association (IDA), were investing in educational and development programs (1999) to increase access to primary school, to improve classrooms, and to raise teacher and workforce skills to enable the workforce to respond to social and economic goals.\n\nLiterature • Most of the Literature in Cape Verde is written in Portuguese, but a movement to develop a standardized written form of Creole has caused several books to be published in this language as well. • Written literature is strongly influenced by the tradition of oral story telling which finds its roots in both Africa and Europe. • A predominant theme in both literature and music is saudade, a sense of longing or homesickness, usually the result of emigration and the ensuing separation of families.\n\nActivities • Watersports are a big attraction. • Diving is a popular activity. • Walking, trekking and mountaineering have also gained new adepts lately on the islands. • Other activities such as horse riding, quad biking, turtle watching and bird watching are available, as well as excursions to other islands and island hopping itineraries for maximum sightseeing opportunities.\n\nGovernment • Government Type: Republic • Since Cape Verde won independence from Portugal in 1975, it has had a democratic multi-party system of government with proportional representation through electoral districts. • The unicameral national assembly is made up of seventy-two elected deputies including six chosen by the Cape Verdean population abroad. • New constitution came into force 25 September 1992.\n\nIts Legal system was derived from the legal system of Portugal • Suffrage: 18 years of age; universal • Executive Branch chief of state: President Antonio MASCARENHAS Monteiro (since 22 March 1991) head of government: Prime Minister Carlos Alberto Wahnon de Carvalho VEIGA (since 13 January 1991) cabinet: Council of Ministers appointed by the president on the recommendation of the prime minister from among the members of the National Assembly elections: president elected by popular vote for a five-year term; election last held 18 February 1996 (next to be held NA February 2001); prime minister nominated by the National Assembly and appointed by the president election results: Antonio MASCARENHAS Monteiro elected president; percent of vote—Antonio MASCARENHAS Monteiro (independent) 80.1% .\n\nLegislative Branch • unicameral National Assembly or AssembleiaNacional (72 seats; members are elected by popular vote to serve five-year terms) elections: last held 17 December 1995 (next to be held NA 2000) election results: percent of vote by party—MPD 59%, PAICV 28%, PCD 6%; seats by party—MPD 50, PAICV 21, PCD 1\n\nPolitical Parties and Leaders • Movement for Democracy or MPD [Prime Minister Carlos VEIGA, founder and president] • African Party for Independence of Cape Verde or PAICV [Pedro Verona Rodrigues PIRES, chairman] • Party for Democratic Convergence or PCD [Dr. Eurico MONTEIRO, president] • Party of Work and Solidarity or PTS [Dr. Oresimo SILVEIRA, president]\n\nReligion • Over 90% of the population of Cape Verde is nominally Roman Catholic. • Protestant churches account for a small percentage with the largest denomination being the Church of the Nazarene. • Seventh-Day Adventists, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, Assemblies of God, and various Pentecostal and evangelical groups. • There are also small groups of Muslims and Baha'i.\n\nSeveral African traditional religions are practiced, especially on São Tiago, with some traditional elements infused in other religions. • Though there is no state religion, the Catholic Church seems to enjoy a somewhat privileged status, including officially observed religious holidays.\n\nReligious Beliefs • Ninety-eight percent of Cape Verdeans are Roman Catholic. • The Nazarene church is also represented as are Seventh Day Adventists, Mormons, and Evangelical Christians. • There is a history of several Jewish settlements that dates back to the inquisition, but they are now extinct.\n\nRituals and Holy Places • Each town has a church, but most Cape Verdeans are non-practicing Catholics. However, saints' days are often the basis of community-wide parties involving dancing, drinking, and food. • One family, neighborhood, or town usually takes charge of the celebration for a given saint.\n\nFood in Daily Life • Corn is the staple food of Cape Verde. • The national dish, cachupa, is a stew of hominy, beans, and whatever meat or vegetables may be available. • rice, beans, fish, potatoes, and manioc • A traditional breakfast is cuscus, a steamed cornbread, eaten with honey and milk or coffee. • Cape Verdeans generally eat a large lunch in the mid-afternoon and a small, late dinner. • Grog, or sugar cane liquor, is manufactured on the islands and is a popular drink, particularly among the men.\n\nCape Verdean Dishes • Cachupa Rica - A slow boiled stew with maize, sweet potato, pumpkin, vegetables, fish, meat or chicken. • Perceves (Sea Fingers) - Funnily enough they look like purply brown fingers. You crack off the end and peel the skin to reveal the meat (similar texture to squid). • Tuna - The freshest you could ever imagine, cooked in a variety of different ways.\n\nLocal Drinks • Grogue - locally produced from sugar cane to make this strong alcoholic drink. • Fogo wine - Very pleasant when drunk at the right time but can be hit and miss depending on the age of the grape.\n\nPopular Resorts in Cape Verde Resort in the Island of Sal Tortuga Beach Resort Morabeza Beach Resort\n\nBoaVista Dunas Beach Resort\n\nHotels in Cape Verde RiuFunana-Garopa Hotel Hotel in Santiago, Cape Verde\n\nPestanaTropico Hotel, Praia Hotel Santa Maria Beach, Insel Sal Kapverden\n\nReference: • http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/economies/Africa/Cape-Verde-AGRICULTURE.html • http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Cape_Verde • http://education.stateuniversity.com/pages/246/Cape-Verde.html • http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/economies/Africa/Cape-Verde-INDUSTRY.html • http://www.worldtravelguide.net/cape-verde/business-etiquette • http://www.photius.com/wfb1999/cape_verde/cape_verde_government.html • http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Africa/Cape-Verde-RELIGIONS.html • http://www.everyculture.com/Bo-Co/Cape-Verde.html"
