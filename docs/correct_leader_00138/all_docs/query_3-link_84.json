Another 1,700 IDPs were due to begin leaving on Tuesday for Harper in the southeastern county of Maryland.\n\nGUINEA: Swiss provide aid to refugees\n\nSwitzerland is providing 2.6 million Swiss francs (US $1.6 million) to support relief operations for thousands of Sierra Leonean and Liberian refugees caught in the fighting in the southwest of Guinea.\n\nThe Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation announced on Friday it would give the UNHCR one million francs (US $605,290) to relocate refugees to safer areas. Another US $665,819 will go to the World Food Programme to buy, transport and distribute 1,370 mt of assorted foods. Some US $302,645 goes to the Swiss chapter of Medecins sans Frontieres, which works in the new refugees camps, especially in the prevention of epidemics.\n\nThe SDC has also sent three experts from the Swiss Disaster Relief Unit to Guinea and Sierra Leone: a water and sanitation specialist and a site planner will work with the UNHCR in Guinea while another site planner will go to Sierra Leone to help set up new camps.\n\nCAPE VERDE: PAIGC candidate wins presidential election\n\nPedro Pires has been declared winner of the second round of presidential elections in Cape Verde, held on Sunday. Pires, candidate of the Partido africano da Independencia da Guine e Cabo Verde (PAIGC), beat Carlos Veiga by 17 votes, the national electoral commission reported, pending validation of the results by the Supreme Court. Veiga was prime minister in the outgoing Movimento para Democracia (MPD) government, which ruled the country since 1991, when it ended the PAIGC's 17-year reign. Pires is also a former prime minister.\n\nGUINEA-BISSAU: Shooting in military camp attributed to drunken row\n\nPrime Minister Caetano Intchama denied on Monday that shooting heard overnight near the headquarters of the armed forces was due to dissatisfaction among soldiers over overdue allowances. He said the shots were fired during a row between two drunken individuals. Portuguese radio reported witnesses as saying that the sporadic shooting was the work of young soldiers who shouted that they were dying on the border with Senegal - where the military have been engaging rebels fighting for independence for Casamance, southern Senegal - while some officials had two or three cars. Radiodifusao Portuguesa reported anonymous sources as saying that, in the early hours of Monday, a group of young soldiers stole food destined for high-ranking officers near the armed forces headquarters.\n\nNIGER: Media watchdog calls for dialogue\n\nThe Reseau des journalistes pour les droits de l'homme (RJDH - Journalists' Network for Human Rights) has urged Niger's authorities to reopen the Abdou Moumouni University in the capital, Niamey, and free 15 students jailed following violence on campus between protesting students and security forces.\n\nIn a statement issued on Sunday, RJDH condemned the use of violence against the protesters, the arbitrary detention of students in a prison in Kollo, 25 km south of the capital, Niamey, and the beating by police of journalists covering the protests. The organisation also denounced a proposal by the government to privatise the university as a means of solving the current crisis. RJDH has called on civilians to press the government to negotiate with the students and respect their right to education.\n\nStudents began pressing for better living conditions on campus early last month. The campus has remained closed since 22 February, a day after violent clashes broke out there.\n\nGABON: Army recruitment drive\n\nGabon's Ministry of Defence has launched a programme to recruit 1,500 young men and women aged 18-25 years into the armed forces over the next five years , AFP reported on the ministry as saying on Friday. The recruitment is linked to measures taken by the ministry in recent weeks to curb rising violence and insecurity. It would also enable Gabon to participate in peacekeeping missions, AFP reported.\n\nAFRICA: GlaxoSmithKline and WHO sign agreement on new malaria treatment\n\nGlaxoSmithKline, a major pharmaceutical company, and the World Health Organisation (WHO) announced on Friday the signing of an agreement for the development of a new anti-malaria treatment called LAPDAP.\n\nLAPDAP combines two existing anti-malarial compounds (chlorproguanil and dapsone), WHO said. The agreement aims at developing the drug as an oral treatment for uncomplicated malaria, primarily for use in Sub-Saharan Africa. Clinical trials in the region have shown that LAPDAP is effective in treating uncomplicated malaria resistant to other standard therapies, WHO reported.\n\nBoth partners contributed to the cost of developing the drug, which is to be made available at a preferential price for public health programmes. It is entering its final phase of development, and could be available in some African countries as early as next year, WHO said.\n\nAt least 300 million cases of malaria occur worldwide every year, 90 per cent of which are in Africa. Every day, nearly 3,000 people -- mostly children under five -- die as a result of the disease.\n\nAbidjan, 6 March 2001; 17:40 GMT\n\n[ENDS]\n\n[IRIN-WA: Tel: +225 22-40-4440; Fax (Admin): +225 22-40-4435; Fax (Editorial Desk): +225-22-41-9339; e-mail: irin-wa@irin.ci]\n\n[This item is delivered in the \"africa-english\" service of the UN's IRIN humanitarian information unit, but may not necessarily reflect the views of the United Nations.
