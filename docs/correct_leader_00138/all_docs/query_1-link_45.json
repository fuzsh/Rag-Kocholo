Jocy was only 16 and a junior at Madison Park who loved her family, her cat Stormy, and was extremely gifted at braiding hair. At a very young age, she taught herself how to braid and started her own business titled “Braided by Jocy.” \n\nThe pain of losing a loved one is unbearable, but having to bury a child is a pain that is unimaginable. As a result of senseless violence at the hands of a gun, a mother is forced to say goodbye to her baby before she has even had the chance to see the world. No parent should have to bury their child. We should not have to fear that our kids won’t make it home after walking home from their grandparent’s home. We cannot afford to ignore this - the violence in our city needs to stop. Please continue to keep this young girl and her family in your thoughts and prayers during this extremely difficult time.\n\nJucelena - I am so sorry. You deserved so much more and your life was cut too short far too soon. Thank you for being your unapologetic self and for sharing your love and talents with the world while you were with us.  You have left your loved ones with so much love and memories that they will cherish. \n\nRest in Power Jucelena “Jocy” Gomes Ramos • April 6, 2005 - January 2nd, 2022\".",
