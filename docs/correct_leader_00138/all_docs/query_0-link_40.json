        "text": "Along with the lump sum, to be paid over 10 years, he will receive $200,000 (£127,000) annually for life. He can also apply for another $200,000 per year for 10 years towards his charitable activities and espoused good causes.\n\nThe decision to award Mr Pires avoids the potential embarrassment of going a third year without recognising a winner.\n\nFor the past two years, the prize committee could find no examples of good governance in sub-Saharan Africa – an uncomfortable reminder of how corruption, power-struggles and conflicts still blight much of the region.\n\nThis year, there have been further examples of poor governance in Africa.\n\nCritics have suggested that cash incentives are not enough for African leaders, some of whom can make as much in a month in corrupt deals and are conscious of potential prosecution by the International Criminal Court should they leave power.\n\nThis year however, there were several contenders for the prize, including President Fradique de Menezes of Sao Tome and Principe who stood down in August after serving two terms in office, and Rupiah Banda, who last month gave a tearful and dignified farewell speech after handing the presidency to Michael Sata following elections.\n\nMo Ibrahim, the founder of the Mo Ibrahim Foundation, said President Pires embodied the virtues he wanted to celebrate when he launched the prize.\n\n\"It is wonderful to see an African leader who has served his country from the time of colonial rule through to multiparty democracy, all the time retaining the interests of his people as his guiding principle,\" he said.\n\n\"The fact that Cape Verde with few natural resources can become a middle income country is an example not just to the continent but to the world.\"\n\nSudanese Mo Ibrahim, who made his money through telecoms and who provides the prize money, has said he is determined that the prize should never be given away lightly.\n\n\"Whether there is a winner or not the purpose is to challenge those in Africa and across the world to debate what constitutes excellence in leadership,\" he said.\n\nPrevious winners include Festus Mogae, the former President of Botswana, Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique and Nelson Mandela, who was made an honorary laureate in 2007.\n\nThis year, the judging panel included Lord Cairns, chair of the UK's Charities Aid Foundation, Dr Mamphela Ramphele, the South African anti-apartheid activist and the former Irish President Mary Robinson.\n\nHe also praised Mr Veronia Pires' rejection of the suggestion that the constitution could be changed to allow him to run for a third term, when he had already served 10 years in power."
