        "text": "Today, Incredible Health released our 2024 State of US Nursing Report, with upcoming coverage from Bloomberg, Fierce Healthcare, Modern Healthcare, Becker's Healthcare, ABC News and more. Now in it's 5th year, we analyzed data from the 1 million US nurses on the Incredible Health platform, and surveyed over 3000 nurses, to better understand top challenges nurses face across the country. We share our learnings with our hospital partners and the public, to continue to drive change for the nursing workforce: 🩺 88% of nurses point to staffing shortages as negatively impacting patient care ✈️ Interest in travel nursing is down 22% from 2023 as nurses seek more stable opportunities 👊 Challenges persist, with 50% of nurses experiencing verbal or physical assault in the last year And there's positives too: 🧠 Mental health of nurses has seen a 6% improvement in the last year Read the 2024 State of US Nursing report here:\n\nWe’re thrilled to announce our $50M Series B investment led by Base10 Partners! Thank you to our investors, Anthos Capital, TechOperators LLC, and StoneMill Ventures for their ongoing support of our mission, and to our partners: we’re only getting started and we couldn’t be more excited for what’s to come. This investment will enable us to go further faster, by growing headcount, expanding our office locations globally, and accelerating our roadmap through significant investments in engineering. In addition, Austin McChord will be joining our Advisory board, bringing a wealth of knowledge to our strategic direction. We look forward to sharing more exciting updates in the near future!\n\n🎉 It's official – we’ve raised a $12M Series A. We’re stoked to be partnering with new leads Kin Ventures and Contrary while deepening our relationship with the team at Footwork. Power started with a mission to reimagine trial recruitment with the patient at its core, and to do something about an outdated system that wasn’t serving anyone effectively. At Power, we’re making it easy for patients and researchers to connect, and data tells us our product is working: 🌐 Over 600,000 patients used Power to discover trials in the last year 🌈 40% of these patients are non-white 💪 A staggering 90% of these patients were previously unconnected with existing research sites We’re excited to celebrate these achievements and many more. Yet, the most impactful milestones are the empowering stories we hear from patients weekly, who have found hope in situations once deemed hopeless. Looking ahead, we're committed to making it easier than ever for all key stakeholders - patients, researchers, and trial sponsors - to connect, and setting a new standard for the clinical trial industry at large. Thank you to everyone who has been a part of this journey. The support we've received over the past 2 years has been nothing short of inspiring. And finally, a shout out to some of our awesome investors who we are partnering with on this round: Nikhil Basu Trivedi and Mike Smith at Footwork Tina Hoang-To at Kin Ventures Megan Kao, Eric Tarczynski and Kyle Harrison at Contrary Daniel Rumennik and Lenny Rachitsky at AirAngels Vasudev Bailey and Stuart Peterson at ARTIS Ventures Harry Stebbings, Casey Winters and Rob Schutz at 20Growth Ryan Ackell at 14W Tim Kendall and Evan Tato at Common Metal Terrence Rohan at Otherwise\n\nEvery day, a clinical trial is delayed due to recruitment planning issues. Often, it’s because recruitment planning came too late in the process. Today, we’re excited to share our latest white paper, Blueprint for Modern Patient Recruitment, which consolidates the top strategies sponsors are using to effectively plan and execute patient recruitment. We explore: 👉 How to quantify ROI on patient recruitment investments 👉 Fundamental shifts from a traditional to modern recruitment approach 👉 5 strategies top sponsors are using to modernize patient recruitment 👉 How to build a culture of patient centricity For industry professionals aiming to drive change and create more certainty in clinical trial recruitment, this white paper is not just a must-read but a roadmap to success. #ClinicalResearch #PatientRecruitment #ClinicalTrials #ClinicalTrialDiversity https://bit.ly/3IjykSp\n\n🚀 Doubling Down on Innovation: Our Continued Investment in Conta Simples 🚀 In the dynamic world of fintech, change is the only constant. We've seen how platforms like Nubank revolutionized consumer banking in Brazil. Today, we're thrilled to announce our renewed investment in a company that's reshaping business finance: Conta Simples. 🌐 The Fintech Revolution in Brazil Brazil's fintech scene is evolving rapidly, paving the way for innovative solutions. This is enabled by a forward looking government with Pix’s launch and rapid adoption being a perfect example of fostering innovation. It's a landscape where agility meets necessity, creating fertile ground for transformative platforms. Conta Simples is at the forefront of this revolution, offering unparalleled spend management solutions for businesses. 💼 Why Conta Simples? Conta Simples goes beyond traditional banking services. It's a comprehensive platform that empowers businesses with intuitive spend management, aligning perfectly with the needs of modern enterprises. Their approach is not just about managing finances; it's about driving business efficiency. 🔍 Our Belief in Conta Simples Our decision to double our investment in Conta Simples is rooted in a firm belief in their vision and strategy. They are the leading spend management player in Brazil which has worked in many other regions (like Brex in the US), but have been extremely focused on capital efficiency which stands out vs other global players. 🌟 A Team Like No Other The driving force behind our confidence? The entire Conta Simples team led by Rodrigo Tognini. Their execution has been nothing short of exceptional. It's their dedication, expertise, and vision that make Conta Simples not just a company to watch, but a company to be part of. 🔭 Looking Ahead We believe in Conta Simples' potential to redefine business finance and are excited to see what the future holds.
