Carolyn's participation was supported by NOAA Sea Grant's Community Engaged Internship Program and WHOI Sea Grant. She was advised by James Hayes-Bohanan, a professor in Bridgewater State University's Department of Geography; Angelo Barbosa, director of Bridgewater State University's Pedro Pires Institute for Cape Verdean Studies; Matt Charette, director of WHOI Sea Grant; Stephanie Murphy, senior communications specialist with WHOI Sea Grant; and Poonam Narotam, communications specialist with WHOI Sea Grant. Additional funding for the exhibit was provided by WHOI Sea Grant. This exhibit was initiated and realized because of the enthusiasm and support of Barbara Burgo, co-founding member of the Cape Cod Cape Verdean Museum and Cultural Center. Special thanks to Wesley Leite, president and co-founding member of the Cape cod Cape Verdean Museum and Cultural Center, for his help and support."
