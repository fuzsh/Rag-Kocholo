        "text": "Today, Daniel W. Yohannes, Chief Executive Officer of the U.S. Government’s Millennium Challenge Corporation, issued the following statement:\n\n“Congratulations to former Cape Verde President Pedro Verona Pires on receiving this year’s Ibrahim Prize from the Mo Ibrahim Foundation, a prestigious award recognizing a democratically elected former African leader who worked to lift people out of poverty and pave the way for future success. The Mo Ibrahim Foundation’s Prize Committee acknowledged President Pires’s efforts to make Cape Verde a model of democracy, stability and greater prosperity.\n\n“The Millennium Challenge Corporation is proud to partner with Cape Verde, a country that maintains an obvious and tangible commitment to economic reform, liberalization and good governance. A strong and stable Cape Verde in West Africa provides an example for the whole continent. Cape Verde’s $110 million MCC compact—the first to be completed in Africa—has helped increase agricultural productivity, improve the transportation network, facilitate trade, and develop the private sector. Strong performance on Cape Verde’s first MCC compact, coupled with a record of policy reforms, led to the island-nation’s eligibility for a second MCC compact.\n\n“Given MCC’s deep commitment to good governance, we welcome the role President Pires played deepening Cape Verde’s democracy and empowering Cape Verdeans to pursue sustainable poverty reduction through economic growth. We commend the President’s diligence and determination to live by these principles in service to his country. Like the Mo Ibrahim Foundation, MCC applauds the efforts of African leaders to create strong institutions that transcend their time in office and respect the rule of law, civil liberties and the will of the people.”\n\n##\n\nThe Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) is an innovative and independent U.S. foreign aid agency that is helping lead the fight against global poverty. Created by the U.S. Congress in January 2004 with strong bipartisan support, MCC is changing the conversation on how best to deliver smart U.S. foreign assistance by focusing on good policies, country ownership and results."
