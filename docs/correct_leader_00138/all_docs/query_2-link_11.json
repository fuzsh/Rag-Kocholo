        "text": "The long-standing joint colonial administration of Cabo Verde and Guinea-Bissau was terminated in 1879, when both became separate Portuguese territories. Amid the contemporary African decolonization movement, their status was modified in 1951 to “overseas provinces,” and their inhabitants were officially granted full Portuguese citizenship in 1961. Not perceiving these changes as meaningful, however, some members of the colonial population began to agitate for complete independence from Portugal for both Guinea-Bissau and Cabo Verde. One such group, the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cabo Verde (Partido Africano da Independência da Guiné e Cabo Verde; PAIGC), was founded in Bissau in 1956 and headed by Amílcar Cabral, a gifted revolutionary leader and theoretician. Its goal was to achieve independence by using peaceful means of protest. In 1959, however, the Portuguese responded with violence and arrests, which convinced the PAIGC that only a path of armed struggle would be sufficient to end the colonial and fascist regime. After a period of military training and political preparation, the PAIGC launched its armed campaign in January 1963 and showed steady military progress thereafter. On January 20, 1973, Cabral was assassinated, and later that year, on September 24, Guinea-Bissau declared independence. This event—compounded by the other lengthy wars in Portuguese colonies—precipitated a crisis in Portugal that resulted in a successful coup there on April 25, 1974. Portugal’s new government soon began negotiating with African nationalist movements.\n\nIndependence\n\nCountry Facts\n\nCapital, Population, Government...\n\nCountry Facts\n\nAudio File: national anthem of Cabo Verde\n\nAlso called:\n\nCape Verde\n\nHead Of Government:\n\nPrime Minister: Ulisses Correia e Silva\n\nPopulation:\n\n(2024 est.) 491,100\n\nHead Of State:\n\nPresident: José Maria Neves\n\nForm Of Government:\n\nmultiparty republic with one legislative house (National Assembly [722])\n\nFull independence was achieved in Cabo Verde on July 5, 1975. Aristides Pereira, the PAIGC secretary-general, and Pedro Pires, a military commander, became the first president and prime minister, respectively. A military coup in Guinea-Bissau in 1980, deeply resented in Cabo Verde, broke the political unity between the two countries. The PAIGC subsequently split, with the Cabo Verdean branch thereafter known as the African Party for the Independence of Cabo Verde (Partido Africano para a Independência de Cabo Verde; PAICV). Pereira and Pires remained in power in the one-party state until PAICV dissidents were permitted to form a second party, the Movement for Democracy (Movimento para a Democracia; MpD), which was organized from as early as March 1990 and emerged victorious in the two-party elections of January 1991. In the presidential election held the following month, Antonio Mascarenhas Monteiro, backed by the MpD, won a decisive victory; he was reelected in February 1996 in an election marked by a low turnout and in which he was the only candidate.\n\nRecent News\n\nJuly 3, 2024, 11:41 PM ET (BBC)\n\nSierra Leone child marriage ban welcomed as President Julius Maada Bio signs law\n\nDuring Monteiro’s tenure, the country continued to experience economic struggles, and both the MpD and the PAICV held the troubled economy to be their primary concern. During the legislative and presidential elections of 2001, the PAICV was returned to power, with Pires winning the second round of balloting to secure the presidency despite allegations of irregularities by his opponent, former prime minister Carlos Alberto Wahnon Carvalho Veiga. That same year food shortages—a common predicament for Cabo Verde—worsened considerably, and the government relied heavily on foreign aid and food imports to feed the country. Veiga and Pires faced each other once again in the presidential election of 2006, in which Pires—with diasporic support—very narrowly secured reelection. The constitution prohibited Pires from running for a third term, and in the 2011 presidential runoff election Jorge Carlos Fonseca of the MpD defeated Manuel Inocencio Sousa of the PAICV.\n\nW. Mary Bannerman Caroline Sarah Shaw Richard Andrew Lobban The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica\n\nIn October 2013 the government requested that the Portuguese version of the country’s name, Cabo Verde, be used as part of the country’s official name when it was rendered in other languages; previously, the rendition of the country’s official name had varied by language—such as the widely used English translation, Cape Verde.\n\nIn the National Assembly elections in March 2016, the PAICV lost the majority that it had held in the legislative body for some 15 years; the MpD won more than 50 percent of the vote. The PAICV did not field a candidate in the presidential election held later that year in October. Fonseca handily defeated two other candidates to win reelection, taking about three-fourths of the vote.\n\nFrom 2016 the country experienced strong economic growth, buoyed by a thriving tourism sector and successful structural reforms. In 2020, however, the COVID-19 pandemic led to a decline in tourism; it also led to a decrease in consumption, as buying habits were curtailed by efforts to contain the spread of the virus, as well as impacting other areas of economic activity. According to the World Bank, these factors contributed to Cabo Verde’s economy contracting by an estimated 14.8 percent in 2020. As the country worked to regain its economic footing, elections were held in 2021. In the National Assembly elections, held on April 18, the MpD maintained its majority. In the October 17 presidential election, however, the PAICV candidate, José Maria Neves, narrowly won in the first round of voting; he had been up against six other candidates. Neves was inaugurated on November 9, 2021.\n\nThe Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica"
