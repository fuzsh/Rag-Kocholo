        "text": "NEW BEDFORD - Cape Verde’s President José Maria Pereira Neves will visit New Bedford on April 1 to strengthen ties and pay tribute to several members of the local Cape Verdean community.\n\nNeves, who took office in November of 2021, has firmly maintained that the Cape Verdean Diaspora is an “essential component” for his country to achieve its goals and it could be “a determining force in international relations.”\n\nNeves will be in the United States from March 31 to April 5 to carry out what’s being called his first “Presidency in the Diaspora.” He is expected to visit Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island.\n\nIn a prepared statement, Cape Verde’s Presidência da República – the Executive Office of the President – pointed out that this unprecedented presidential initiative is taking place in the United States because it is home to the “oldest and largest Cape Verdean community abroad.” As a result, this will constitute a “fitting tribute” to all Cape Verdean emigration.\n\n“Over the years, the milestones associated with the integration of Cape Verdeans in American society have gone beyond the borders of this great country and reached the islands in the most diverse ways, constituting relevant contributions to the progress of the Cape Verdean nation,” reads the statement. “The challenge today is precisely to build new ways that allow these contributions to translate into exchange of ideas, knowledge and technology, while stimulating quality gains and ambition in the islands.”\n\nIn 2021, the Cape Verdean Census counted 561,901 living in the African archipelago. In January 2023, Cape Verde’s Minister of Communities Jorge Santos estimated that as many as 2 million Cape Verdeans or Cape Verdean descendents live abroad. Of those, about 850,000 live in the Americas, mostly in the United States.\n\n“The big question is how to best integrate these [Diaspora] communities and all their potential in order to add value to the development process [of Cape Verde],” said Santos, while speaking to journalists during an international roundtable held in the Cape Verdean capital this past January.\n\nIn fact, remittances from emigrants provide a crucial lifeline for Cape Verde. According to data from the Bank of Cape Verde (BCV), Cape Verdean emigrants sent 22,131 million escudos (about $215 million) to Cape Verde in the first nine months of 2022. Of that amount, $75 million came from Cape Verdeans living in the United States.\n\nIn the news release announcing Neves’ trip to the United States, the Presidência da República recalls how Cape Verdeans in the United States have “since the early 18th century, by consenting to enormous sacrifices and unwavering efforts, laid the true foundations for the extraordinary and exemplary relationship that links the American and Cape Verdean nations.”\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, Massachusetts was home to 70,040 Cape Verdeans as of 2020 and is the U.S. state with the largest population of Cape Verdeans. At the time, the five largest communities of Cape Verdeans in Massachusetts were: Brockton, Boston, New Bedford, Taunton and Fall River.\n\nDuring his visit to New Bedford on April 1, the president will recognize several individuals significant to the Cape Verdean community during a ceremony to be held at the New Bedford Whaling Museum, starting at 3 p.m.\n\n“This is an occasion for interaction and recognition of the entire journey of Cape Verdean emigration to the United States,” reads the statement. “The President will decorate personalities, institutions and organizations representing the vast community and its vast fronts of intervention, including sports, education, health, and social solidarity.”\n\nAmong those being recognized are the Tavares Brothers, Alexandre Furtado, Yvonne Smart, Dana Barros, Joseph Moniz, Virginia Gonsalves, Pastor Elizeu Lima, Fredson Gomes, Ana P. Novais, and Benjamin Pinto Monteiro.\n\nThe president will also recognize the New Bedford Whaling Museum for its “pioneering and fruitful work” of documenting, studying, and disseminating information regarding the Whaling Era and “its role in formatting migratory movements, especially that of Cape Verdeans who, by the way, were the first people from Africa to emigrate to the United States as free men and women.”\n\nOn April 2, Neves will visit the Cape Verdean American Community Development (CACD), located at 120 High Street, Pawtucket, R.I. He will take part in a “Community Meet & Great” special event, starting at 2:45 p.m.\n\nNeves, 62, won the 2021 presidential elections with 51.7 percent of the vote, averting the need for a runoff.\n\nA member of the African Party for the Independence of Cape Verde (PAICV), he previously served as the Prime Minister of Cape Verde from 2001 to 2016. He has also served as Minister of Defense and Minister of Finance and Planning.\n\nIn Massachusetts, Neves also plans to visit Bridgewater State University, which is home to the Pedro Pires Institute for Cape Verdean Studies. He also intends to meet with local officials in cities with large Cape Verdean communities.\n\n“In addition to meetings with the highest authorities, including governors and mayors, José Maria Neves will also have important meetings with young leaders and associative movements in the Massachusetts region, in addition to high school students and businessmen of Cape Verdean descent,” reads the statement from the Presidência da República.\n\nNeves will wrap up his visit to Massachusetts in the Boston area.\n\nOn Tuesday, April 4, he will visit the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) within the framework of the second annual webinar series ‘TAU x MIT,’ which focuses on various aspects of sustainable development in Africa.\n\nNeves will participate in a live conversation in a fireside chat type format, from 12 p.m. to 1 p.m. The topic will be e-governance, which is an area of great expertise for President Neves, who holds a degree from the Fundação Getulio Vargas’s São Paulo School of Business Administration (EAESP) in Brazil.\n\nThe event will be hybrid - having both a live audience and online participants - and open to the public. For more information, contact Ari Jacobovits, managing director of the MIT-Africa Program at arijaco@mit.edu\n\nLater that afternoon, Neves will take part in the 25th Annual Martin Luther King Jr. & Amílcar Cabral commemorative program at UMass Boston.\n\nThat event will be held at the Campus Center Ballroom, on the third floor, from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m.\n\nFeatured speakers will be President Neves and noted journalist and author Charlayne Hunter-Gault, a former foreign correspondent for National Public Radio, CNN, and the Public Broadcasting Service."
