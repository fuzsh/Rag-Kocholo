        "text": "NEW BEDFORD â€” A painting of Antonio L. Lopes, New Bedford's last whaleman, provided a backdrop for Cape Verdean President Pedro Pires to reflect on his nation's historical connections to the Whaling City.\n\n\"The history between the United States and Cape Verde is still to be written. There is a lot more research yet to be done,\" Pires said Sunday to a group of dignitaries, community residents and New Bedford Whaling Museum officials on the upper level of the museum's Lagoda Room.\n\nIn his final visit to the United States as Cape Verde's president, Pires focused his remarks on the local Cape Verdean community's history, and the role that institutions such as the whaling museum have in preserving that legacy.\n\n\"In the life of every people, there is something very, very important, and that's memory. We have a right to have a history,\" Pires said.\n\nAfter leaving the museum, he traveled with a state police escort to the Hawthorne Country Club in Dartmouth for a social meeting with Cape Verdean community leaders. Members of the state police security detail told a reporter Sunday that the Hawthorne social was closed to the press.\n\nSince arriving in the country last Friday, Pires has visited with Cape Verdean communities in Dorchester, Brockton, Pawtucket, R.I., and SouthCoast.\n\nThe president's itinerary also had him scheduled to meet with the governors of Massachusetts and Rhode Island, as well as other politicians, academics and business leaders, according to the Cape Verdean embassy in Washington, D.C., and the consulate general in Boston.\n\nThe president's Sunday tour of the whaling museum was an occasion for James Russell, the museum's president, to discuss the July 5 opening of a new exhibit on the Cape Verdean contributions to the region, especially in whaling.\n\n\"They were often the best whalers,\" said Russell, who added that the \"Cape Verdean Maritime Exhibit\" will tell the 200-year story of the islanders of Cabo Verde who boarded whaling ships in the Atlantic, traveled to exotic locales and put down roots in New Bedford.\n\nSaying that New Bedford \"was and is today\" a city of immigrants, Russell presented Pires with a small wooden sailor statue and a large framed black-and-white picture of Cape Verdean immigrants arriving in America in the early 20th century aboard the Savoia.\n\nDr. Gregory Jay Galer, vice president of collections and exhibitions at the museum, said the exhibit will feature artifacts donated from local residents, including the painting of Lopes, who traveled from Cape Verde to America on a whaling ship, and was one of the last whalers to sail out of New Bedford. In 2000, he died at age 103.\n\n\"The exhibit will be an opportunity for people to see what's unique about the Cape Verdean culture,\" Galer said.\n\n\"Hopefully, this will be a way for the local Cape Verdean community to connect with their past, and to introduce others from around the country to the contributions of this community.\"\n\nNew Bedford resident Jack Livramento said the exhibit and the president's visit marked \"an excellent opportunity\" to learn how his community impacted New Bedford and other cities along the Northeast.\n\n\"It's a chance for us to go back, write down our history and pass it along to the succeeding generations,\" he said."
