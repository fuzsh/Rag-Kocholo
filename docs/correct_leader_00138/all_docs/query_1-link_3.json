        "text": "Cape Verde's former president has won the $5m African leadership prize awarded by the Mo Ibrahim Foundation for transforming his small country into a model of democracy and stability.\n\nPedro Verona Pires won praise for announcing that he would step down at the end of his second term, dismissing suggestions that the constitution be altered to allow him to stand again.\n\n\"The prize committee has been greatly impressed by President Pedro Pires's vision in transforming Cape Verde into a model of democracy, stability and increased prosperity,\" said Salim Ahmed Salim, the chair of the prize committee. \"Under 10 years as president, the nation became only the second African country to graduate from the United Nation's least-developed category and has won international recognition for its record on human rights and good governance.\"\n\nPires was appointed independent Cape Verde's first prime minister in 1975. He remained in the post for 16 years, then lost his country's first democratic elections in 1991. Pires was then elected in 2001 and again five years later.\n\nFor the past two years, the Mo Ibrahim Foundation prize committee did not award a prize, saying no leaders met the criteria for promoting development and democracy and for handing over power peacefully.\n\nMo Ibrahim, the founder of the Mo Ibrahim Foundation, was full of praise for Pires. \"It is wonderful to see an African leader who has served his country from the time of colonial rule through to multiparty democracy, all the time retaining the interests of his people as his guiding principle,\" he said. \"The fact that Cape Verde with few natural resources can become a middle-income country is an example not just to the continent but to the world. President Pires embodies the type of leadership the prize is designed to recognise.\"\n\nIbrahim, a Sudan-born billionaire created the prize in 2007, worth $5m over 10 years and $200,000 annually for life thereafter. Previous winners include Mozambique's former president Joaquim Chissano and Festus Gontebanye Mogae, the former president of Botswana. Nelson Mandela of South Africa was named an honorary laureate of the prize in 2007.\n\nCape Verde, a country of 500,000 off west Africa's coast, achieved middle-income country status in 2007. The World Bank said good governance, sound macroeconomic management, a responsible use of donor support, and the adoption of effective social development policies produced impressive results throughout the archipelago. Growth in real income per capita reached more than 5% during 2005-08, well above the average for sub-Saharan Africa and for small-island states."
