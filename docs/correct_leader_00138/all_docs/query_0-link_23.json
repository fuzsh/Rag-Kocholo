        "text": "The former President of the Republic Pedro Pires was honoured in the morning of 2 of June, in SOS Children’s Village of Assomada, by the National Office of SOS Children’s Villages Cape Verde by its contribution for the setting up of SOS Children’s Villages in Cape Verde.\n\nHe does consider that for the honoured is always \"interesting\" to do a retrospective of the walk made, taking into account that young people of that time, according to Mr Pedro Pires, have evolved and gained their place in the society.\n\n\"I am delighted to see that people have grown up and now we are dealing with those who want to take responsibilities in shaping the future of this organization and the future of Cape Verde,\" said Commander Pedro Pires.\n\nIn the meeting with resettled young from SOS Children’s Villages Cape Verde, Mr Pedro Pires insisted in transmitting to the young people the idea that there are challenges which are fundamentals, so that can be avoided wrong steps that \"might affect this walk, growth and affirmation\" of Cape Verde.\n\nThe National Director of SOS Children's Villages Cape Verde, Mr Dionísio Pereira, in his turns said he believes that the contribution of Mr Pedro Pires was essential in the creation and development of SOS Children's Villages in Cape Verde.\n\n\"As the Head of the Government from 1975 to 1991’s, Mr Pires had to give his consent in order to settle down SOS Children’s Villages in Cape Verde, and he not only advocated but also created the necessary conditions so that in fact in a short time SOS Children’s Villages could start the operation of the Village of Assomada\" Mr Pereira stressed."
