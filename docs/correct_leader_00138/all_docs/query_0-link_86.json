        "text": "Manuela Veloso and Pedro Pires were honoured on Iscte's 51st anniversary\n\nIscte – University Institute of Lisbon will award honorary degrees to the Portuguese scientist Manuela Veloso and the former President of the Republic of Cape Verde, Pedro Pires, on the afternoon of 15 December, as part of its 51st anniversary. The 50th anniversary of 25 April and the importance of the democratic regime for science in Portugal, as well as for the development processes of Portuguese-speaking African countries, are the central axis of these celebrations.\n\n\"This anniversary of Iscte will be a moment to celebrate the 50th anniversary of 25 April,\" says the University's Rector, Maria de Lurdes Rodrigues. \"It was the democratic regime that allowed the development of science in Portugal and the creation of a scientific community in our country. It was also the 25th of April that allowed decolonisation and the development of higher education in Portuguese-speaking African countries\". The two laureates, Manuela Veloso and Pedro Pires, represent these two new realities created by 25th of April. \"It was 25 April that made it possible to implement the reform of higher education that Veiga Simão had launched less than a year earlier,\" says Maria de Lurdes Rodrigues.\n\nManuela Veloso, born in Lisbon, is a full professor at Carnegie Mellon University in the United States, where she obtained her doctorate in 1992. She is currently head of artificial intelligence research at JP Morgan. In 2019, she inspired Iscte to create a degree in data science, a pioneering course in Portugal, and launch the Iscte-Sintra School. At the award ceremony on 15 December, his presentation will be made by Jorge Rodrigues da Costa, Full Professor of Engineering and Vice-Rector of Iscte for Research and Technological Modernisation.\n\nManuela Veloso, born in Lisbon, is a full professor at Carnegie Mellon University in the United States, where she received her doctorate in 1992.

Born in 1934 on the island of Fogo in Cape Verde, Pedro Pires studied at the Faculty of Science at the University of Lisbon. As a young man, he joined the liberation movements in the then-Portuguese overseas provinces and was a leader of the PAIGC. As Prime Minister of Cape Verde from 1975 to 1991, he played an important role in the transition to multi-party rule and the consolidation of democracy in Cape Verde. He ensured the first peaceful transfer of power in his country, respecting the results of the elections. He went on to become President of the Republic of Cape Verde, elected in 2001 and re-elected in 2006. Today, he heads the Pedro Pires Institute for Leadership in Praia, whose mission is to promote good governance, conscience and democracy in Cape Verde and Africa.\n\nSince 1999, Iscte has been awarding honorary doctorates to prominent members of society in recognition of outstanding contributions in various fields."
