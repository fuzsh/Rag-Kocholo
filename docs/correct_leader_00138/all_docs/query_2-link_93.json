        "text": "I am so excited to share that my new business Apex Rooftop Bar and Lounge at 150 State St, Boston has opened its doors. You are all invited to come check us out Thursday-Saturday 5pm-12am. Come see us! Apex Rooftop Bar and Lounge: Step into the spotlight of Bostonâ€™s newest sensation: Apex Rooftop Bar and Lounge, where the rhythm of R&B meets the thrill of a speakeasy-style experience. ðŸŽ¶ Nestled high above Faneuil Hall, Apex Rooftop Bar and Lounge at 150 State St, Boston invites you to discover a hidden gem unlike any other in Boston. Feel the pulse of the city beneath your feet as you sip on our exclusive R&B-themed craft cocktails, expertly crafted to elevate your evening to new heights. But itâ€™s not just about the cocktailsâ€”Apex offers more than just a drink; itâ€™s an experience. Picture yourself surrounded by Bostonâ€™s most unforgettable views, where every corner reveals a breathtaking panorama that will leave you speechless. Whether youâ€™re here for a romantic rendezvous or a night out with friends, our rooftop oasis promises an ambiance that is as vibrant as the city itself. â€”See you at the top!\n\nCompany culture is just as important as the bottom line, if you have a toxic culture you'll lose... People are the driving force behind your business, and creating a positive and empowering culture is essential for the success of your business. That means you have to understand what your employees want at a deep level. You have to be constantly adapting to their needs and what they want from the organization. For example, one of my employees might want higher pay when heâ€™s 24. But maybe he falls in love at 28 and decides he wants to spend more time with his family. Another might be more interested in a fancy title. Another might want to get access to me and build a relationship. Another might want to go to one of our international offices and work there. There are a million different variables, and itâ€™s on you as a leader to adjust to reality as it changes. Culture is not something you can just hang on a wall and call it a day. A strong culture is built through consistent actions and decision-making. Either you care about your culture because you actually understand it... or you just say it because it looks 'good' and you actually don't care and you just care about your short term money. Don't underestimate the power of investing in your employees. It's not just the right thing to do, it's also a smart business move."
