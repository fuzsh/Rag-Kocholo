        "text": "Former Cape Verde President Pedro Verona Pires has been awarded this year's $5m (Â£3.2m) Mo Ibrahim prize for good governance in Africa.\n\nThe prize committee said Mr Pires, who stepped down in August, had helped make the archipelago off the West African coast a \"model of democracy, stability and increased prosperity\".\n\nThe prize is supposed to be awarded each year to a democratically elected leader who has voluntarily left office.\n\nThere has been no winner for two years.\n\nThe committee said there had been no suitable candidate.\n\nThe $5m award, given over 10 years followed by $200,000 a year for life, is the world's most valuable individual prize.\n\nThe previous winners are Botswana's President Festus Mogae and Mozambique's Joaquim Chissano.\n\nSudan-born telecoms entrepreneur Mo Ibrahim says the prize is needed because many leaders of sub-Saharan African countries come from poor backgrounds and are tempted to hang on to power for fear that poverty awaits them when they leave office."
