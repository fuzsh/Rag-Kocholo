        "text": "Early history and colonial rule\n\nAlthough there is no conclusive evidence that the islands were inhabited before the arrival of the Portuguese, cases may be made for visits by Phoenicians, Moors, and Africans in previous centuries. It was Portuguese navigators such as Diogo Gomes and Diogo Afonso, Venetian explorer Alvise Ca’ da Mosto, and Genoese navigators such as António and Bartólomeu da Noli, however, who began to report on the islands in the mid-15th century, shortly before a plan of active colonization and settlement was launched.\n\nMore From Britannica\n\nCabo Verde: History\n\nIn 1462 the first settlers from Portugal landed on São Tiago (Santiago), subsequently founding there the oldest European city in the tropics—Ribeira Grande (now Cidade Velha). Sugar was planted in an attempt to emulate the success of the earlier settlement of Madeira. Cabo Verde’s dry climate was less favourable, but, with the development of the transatlantic slave trade, the importance and wealth of the islands increased.\n\nCabo Verde served an increasingly important role as an offshore entrepôt with the development of the triangular trade, by which manufactured goods from Europe were traded for enslaved people, who were sold in turn to plantations in the New World in exchange for the raw materials produced there; with these the ships returned home. Cabo Verde was thus a centre for the trade of cheap manufactured items, firearms, rum, cloth, and the like in exchange for enslaved people, ivory, and gold. Cabo Verde was especially known for its pano cloths, usually constructed of six strips of fabric made from cotton that was grown, dyed dark indigo, and woven on narrow looms by people who were enslaved in Cabo Verde; the cloths were a valuable form of currency for the slave trade on the mainland. Tens of thousands of enslaved people were exported from the coast to the islands and then on to the New World, especially to northern Brazil.\n\nPortuguese efforts to monopolize exploration and trade along the western African coast were disrupted by those who saw the potential of the wealth of Africa for their own interests, and smuggling was rife. Although the slave trade was controlled through the crown-issued monopoly contracts, in the late 16th century the English and Spanish began to wear away the Portuguese monopoly. In addition, the prosperity of Ribeira Grande attracted pirates, who attacked the city in 1541. The English later attacked it twice—in 1585 and 1592—the first time under the command of Francis Drake. After a French attack in 1712, it was decided to move the capital to Praia. With the transfer officially complete in 1770, Ribeira Grande began its long slow decline.\n\nThe waning of the slave trade—the Portuguese rulers and merchants reluctantly abandoned the industry in 1876—coupled with increasing drought slowly sapped the islands’ prosperity. In the early 1800s Cabo Verde experienced not only recurrent drought and famine but government corruption and maladministration as well. In the mid-1850s the islands enjoyed a period of economic optimism as the age of steam replaced the age of sail, and large long-distance oceanic vessels needed strategic coaling stations such as Mindelo could provide. As a result, Cabo Verde was briefly the site of great port activity, before the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 cut severely into this business. For the wider population there was little relief or improvement, and emigration from the islands became the norm: faced with the prospect of drought and starvation at home, the poorest Cabo Verdeans commonly traveled south to work as agricultural labourers picking bananas and cocoa beans in Sao Tome and Principe; others found maritime work on whaling ships.\n\nCabo Verde in the 20th century\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

Amid the contemporary African decolonization movement, their status was modified in 1951 to “overseas provinces,” and their inhabitants were officially granted full Portuguese citizenship in 1961. Not perceiving these changes as meaningful, however, some members of the colonial population began to agitate for complete independence from Portugal for both Guinea-Bissau and Cabo Verde. One such group, the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cabo Verde (Partido Africano da Independência da Guiné e Cabo Verde; PAIGC), was founded in Bissau in 1956 and headed by Amílcar Cabral, a gifted revolutionary leader and theoretician. Its goal was to achieve independence by using peaceful means of protest. In 1959, however, the Portuguese responded with violence and arrests, which convinced the PAIGC that only a path of armed struggle would be sufficient to end the colonial and fascist regime. After a period of military training and political preparation, the PAIGC launched its armed campaign in January 1963 and showed steady military progress thereafter. On January 20, 1973, Cabral was assassinated, and later that year, on September 24, Guinea-Bissau declared independence. This event—compounded by the other lengthy wars in Portuguese colonies—precipitated a crisis in Portugal that resulted in a successful coup there on April 25, 1974. Portugal’s new government soon began negotiating with African nationalist movements.\n\nIndependent Cabo Verde\n\nFull independence was achieved in Cabo Verde on July 5, 1975. Aristides Pereira, the PAIGC secretary-general, and Pedro Pires, a military commander, became the first president and prime minister, respectively. A military coup in Guinea-Bissau in 1980, deeply resented in Cabo Verde, broke the political unity between the two countries. The PAIGC subsequently split, with the Cabo Verdean branch thereafter known as the African Party for the Independence of Cabo Verde (Partido Africano para a Independência de Cabo Verde; PAICV). Pereira and Pires remained in power in the one-party state until PAICV dissidents were permitted to form a second party, the Movement for Democracy (Movimento para a Democracia; MpD), which was organized from as early as March 1990 and emerged victorious in the two-party elections of January 1991. In the presidential election held the following month, Antonio Mascarenhas Monteiro, backed by the MpD, won a decisive victory; he was reelected in February 1996 in an election marked by a low turnout and in which he was the only candidate.\n\nDuring Monteiro’s tenure, the country continued to experience economic struggles, and both the MpD and the PAICV held the troubled economy to be their primary concern. During the legislative and presidential elections of 2001, the PAICV was returned to power, with Pires winning the second round of balloting to secure the presidency despite allegations of irregularities by his opponent, former prime minister Carlos Alberto Wahnon Carvalho Veiga. That same year food shortages—a common predicament for Cabo Verde—worsened considerably, and the government relied heavily on foreign aid and food imports to feed the country. Veiga and Pires faced each other once again in the presidential election of 2006, in which Pires—with diasporic support—very narrowly secured reelection. The constitution prohibited Pires from running for a third term, and in the 2011 presidential runoff election Jorge Carlos Fonseca of the MpD defeated Manuel Inocencio Sousa of the PAICV.\n\nW. Mary Bannerman Caroline Sarah Shaw Richard Andrew Lobban The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica\n\nIn October 2013 the government requested that the Portuguese version of the country’s name, Cabo Verde, be used as part of the country’s official name when it was rendered in other languages; previously, the rendition of the country’s official name had varied by language—such as the widely used English translation, Cape Verde.\n\nIn the National Assembly elections in March 2016, the PAICV lost the majority that it had held in the legislative body for some 15 years; the MpD won more than 50 percent of the vote. The PAICV did not field a candidate in the presidential election held later that year in October. Fonseca handily defeated two other candidates to win reelection, taking about three-fourths of the vote.\n\nFrom 2016 the country experienced strong economic growth, buoyed by a thriving tourism sector and successful structural reforms. In 2020, however, the COVID-19 pandemic led to a decline in tourism; it also led to a decrease in consumption, as buying habits were curtailed by efforts to contain the spread of the virus, as well as impacting other areas of economic activity. According to the World Bank, these factors contributed to Cabo Verde’s economy contracting by an estimated 14.8 percent in 2020. As the country worked to regain its economic footing, elections were held in 2021. In the National Assembly elections, held on April 18, the MpD maintained its majority. In the October 17 presidential election, however, the PAICV candidate, José Maria Neves, narrowly won in the first round of voting; he had been up against six other candidates. Neves was inaugurated on November 9, 2021.\n\nThe Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica"
