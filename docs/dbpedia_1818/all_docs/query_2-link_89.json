Bill loved to spend time with his stepchildren and grandchildren.\n\nBill was an active member for many years in the Knights of Columbus, Elks Club and the Lions Club, all in Burlington. He also enjoyed his poker group, which met weekly for many years. Both Bill and Helene were active members in the Christ the King parish for many years. After Bill retired, he and Helene loved to spend time with their families and friends and enjoyed traveling the world.\n\nBill was predeceased by his brother Thomas and sister-in-law Annette McHugh, his brother James and sister-in-law Lucille ``Peggy” McHugh, his sister-in-law Judith McHugh, and his stepsons Thomas and Stephen Dion.
