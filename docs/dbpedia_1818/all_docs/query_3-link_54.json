        "text": "William H. Donaldson, who made an early fortune as a co-founder of the innovative securities firm Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette and later pushed for tighter financial regulation as chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission in the wake of the Enron and WorldCom accounting scandals, died on Wednesday at his home in Westchester County, N.Y. He was 93.\n\nThe cause was leukemia, his son Adam said.\n\nMr. Donaldson also served briefly as an under secretary of state under Henry A. Kissinger, headed the New York Stock Exchange and was chief executive of the insurer Aetna Inc.\n\nIn 1975, he was named the founding dean of Yale Universityâ€™s School of Organization and Management, now known as the School of Management, whose mission of training leaders for both business and government was exemplified by his own zigzagging career."
