        "text": "A lion which was rescued 13 years ago from a Romanian zoo and brought to a wildlife park in Yorkshire has died.\n\nFourteen-year-old Simba died on Tuesday after a \"battle with ongoing age-related health issues\", staff at Yorkshire Wildlife Park said.\n\nIn a post on social media announcing his death, staff said Simba, who was the last male lion at the park, was an \"amazing animal\".\n\nThey added that his \"legacy will continue for years to come\".\n\nSimba was one of 13 lions saved from living in poor conditions in small concrete-floored cages at Oradea Zoo in Romania in February 2010.\n\nThe previous year, Yorkshire Wildlife Park, near Doncaster, had launched an appeal to raise Â£150,000 to bring the animals to the UK.\n\nThe pride was flown to Robin Hood Airport in South Yorkshire in a specially modified Boeing 737.\n\nSimba is the second male lion to die at Yorkshire Wildlife Park in 2023.\n\nAres, 15, was put down earlier this year due to his \"declining health\", a spokesperson said."
