        "text": "While the official school year in Middletown ended in June, five classrooms in Gaudet Middle School are buzzing this summer with activity. In teacher Abby Williamson’s room, rising 5th grader Marina Costa is taking a break from building a miniature clay lion to explain why the kings of the cat family are excellent hunters. “They look for prey, and they are really fast.”\n\nWilliamson explained how the students’ art projects are a culmination of recent lessons in animal science. “They are learning the difference between predators and prey, their impact on the food chain, and different animals’ survival traits,” she explained.\n\nThis combination of hands-on activities and science education is part of Beyond the Bell, a four-week summer academic and enrichment program for rising first- through sixth-graders in Middletown. The program, which costs approximately $100,000 to run, is funded by a grant from Gov. Dan McKee’s Learn365RI initiative, with additional support from the van Beuren Charitable Foundation, the RI Department of Education and the Town of Middletown Civic Appropriations Fund.\n\nOn this particular day, McKee himself is visiting each of the classrooms to engage with the young learners and see one of his Learn365RI programs in action. “We are creating opportunities to expand the number of learning hours students have each year, whether they happen out of school or over the summer,” he said. “Over the past 12 months, we’ve awarded nearly $8 million in one-time federal funding to local municipalities so they can run out-of- school programs like this one.”\n\nAccording to the governor, the Learn365RI program is part of a broader strategy to improve attendance, boost the Rhode Island Comprehensive Assessment System (RICAS) math and language scores, and ensure seniors have a post-graduation plan.\n\nMornings in Beyond the Bell are run by Middletown Public Schools and are focused on academics, while afternoons like this one are overseen by the Middletown Child Opportunity Zone and are enrichment based. Most students in the program have been nominated by a teacher for additional support and attend for free. While siblings may also participate, they are charge on a sliding scale, based on ability to pay.\n\nNew Middletown Superintendent William Niemeyer, who accompanied McKee on his visit, said, “Year-round learning opportunities like Beyond the Bell are a huge win for students and families.” He added that Beyond the Bell is designed to combat “summer slide,” when children without learning opportunities in July and August may lose some of the gains they had made in the school year.\n\nWhile the summer program is funded through the first round of Learn365RI grants, Middletown recently received a second $270,000 Learn365RI grant to run a twice-a-week afterschool program for students in grades K-12 this fall – a program that includes social-emotional learning, athletics and targeted supports in every subject matter.\n\nNiemeyer sees many benefits to the governor’s initiative. “We focused on raising attendance rates and creating environments that keep students engaged,” he said. “What is so special is that we are able to make an immediate impact in our community, while building capacity. We can start with this initiative, build our systems around the need, and move to the next need.”\n\nMcKee has made education a priority of his administration and believes strongly that a community-based approach is the key to success. “Each of Rhode Island’s 39 cities and towns is full of community partners who can contribute to this effort and expand learning hours without putting the burden exclusively on schools,” he said. “If we are going to raise learning outcomes for Rhode Island, then we all have to pull together. Every day, every home, learning matters.”"
