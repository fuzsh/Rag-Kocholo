Over 5376 members and over 457 matched groups. Smithsworldwide is the Smith DNA project site to keep track of related group items, such as groups and trees and includes both those who have done DNA and those who have not.\n\nSMITHSWORLDWIDE is the Smith DNA Project site for keeping One Big Tree with many branches, as well as related group items. Come collaborate with us and post your Smith line of descent. Be sure to post your tree on FamilyTreeDNA for the benefit of those who wish to compare there. We are a free volunteer project that has a goal to sort out the many many Smith, Schmidt, Smyth, Smythe, Smithson, Smithall, Smithers et al lines, through DNA and through collaboration. What if you see an error or want to suggest a change? Smithsworldwide also has discussion forums, including specific forums for groups. Do you know something about these Smith ancestors?\n\nTO PARTICIPATE- Note that you should always upload or add your tree to FamilyTreeDNA for the benefit of others who wish to compare. Also,Come send in your line here that includes Smith, Schmidt etc whether you have done DNA or not. Register, free, for a user name and password on the Smith DNA project site, to add or edit information to a tree branch you have sent (form to send your family tree or you may send a direct line gedcom to info@smithsworldwide.org . You do not have to be registered to send a suggestion; registration is for adding/editing on your branch of the tree and sending private messages and emails to other members. All free. We welcome corrections and do not claim that all data is infallible. After all, that's the whole point of a collaborative project, eh? To root out errors and inconsistencies, make additions and seek to refine lines through DNA When you send in your line, you will be given a *branch* and, registering, you will be tied to that branch. Branches are used as index pointers to all related information for a given member regarding where your line is, matched groupings, etc and are also used for permissions for editing and adding information.\n\nYou can also register and post a query on the Smith DNA Community Forums. We love your comments\n\nJOIN Smiths at FamilyTreeDNA- Come join the Smith Official DNA Project at FamilyTreeDNA with a DNA kit. Or, did you do a YDNA test with FamilyTreeDNA but not part of the Smith Official DNA Project on FamilyTreeDNA? Instructions on how to join here. Or, if you tested DNA (autosomal) with a different vendor (Ancestry, Relative Genetics, Sorensen, etc), you can do a 3rd party transfer to FamilyTreeDNA (YDNA) (Autosomal)) . When you join the Smith Official DNA Project on FamilyTreeDNA, the admins are sent a message welcoming you to the project. We also welcome all who have tested mtDNA or Family Finder/autosomal by having you list your tree (YDNA groups are the baseline to compare other 's trees). We hope those who are able will test YDNA especially with the Smith surnames; the more people we have to compare against the better we can know and sort out the ancestries and family lines. If you have not done DNA yet, you are invited to send in your tree to info@smithsworldwide.org.\n\nCONTACT US- If you have any questions or comments about the information on Smith DNA , please contact us."
