        "text": "Steller Sea Lion Research\n\nPopulation Vital Rates\n\nIn Alaska, Steller sea lions range from southeastern Alaska north and west through the Gulf of Alaska, along the Aleutian Islands chain and into the Bering Sea. They are currently listed as endangered in their western Distinct Population Segment (wDPS) and have been delisted from their former threatened status in their eastern DPS. These populations are divided at Cape Suckling, Alaska, which lies between Prince William Sound and Yakutat. In the wDPS, sea lion numbers declined between the 1970s and 1990s. The overall decline ceased in 2000-2003, with modest increases east of Samalga Pass while declines continued to the west. Meanwhile the eDPS has steadily increased at approximately 3% per year.\n\nThe ADF&G Steller Sea Lion Program works closely with the National Marine Fisheries Service Marine Mammal Laboratory (MML) to estimate vital rates of Steller sea lions, in particular, age-specific survival and reproductive rates. By comparing survival and reproductive rates between these regions of differing population trends we hope to identify factors that help explain these differing trends.\n\nADF&G, MML and the Alaska SeaLife Center have permanently marked, by hot-branding under anesthesia, sea lions for individual identification at rookeries throughout Alaska. Every summer, these agencies follow up on this work by conducting brand-resight cruises during which nearly every sea lion haulout and rookery in Alaska is visited by biologists in small skiffs. We resight animals during other seasons for specific projects or opportunistically during other types of fieldwork. During these skiff and land-based surveys, biologists conduct counts, photograph branded animals, and collect behavioral data (for example, whether a female has a nursing pup or an adult male is defending a territory). Resightings of branded individuals are used in mark-recapture models to estimate survival, reproductive rates,the age of weaning and other life history variables.\n\nTo date our database of resighted animals exceeds 57,000 observations, confirmed using photographs, of 3,300 branded animals.\n\nPublications\n\nHastings, K.

Photographs of the sea lion and its brand, the date, and location are very valuable pieces of information that we can use. Photographs of branded sea lions that are entangled by marine debris, suckling their pups or nursing from their mothers are also valuable.\n\nPlease keep in mind the Marine Mammal Protection Act prohibits anyone from disturbing marine mammals unless authorized by NOAA permit, and it is wise to keep a distance of 100 yards between yourself and sea lions on their haulouts.\n\nPlease send photos along with date, specific location, and your contact information to dfg.dwc.sealions@alaska.gov. Thank you!\n\nTo report an injured or dead marine mammal: please call the National Marine Fisheries Service Alaska 24 hr Stranding Hotline: (877) 925-7773 or (877) 9-AKR-PRD.\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle+\n\nReddit"
