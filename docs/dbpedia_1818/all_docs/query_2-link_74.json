        "text": "Charles Earlis Clary, 80, of Deer Park, MD, passed away peacefully in his home surrounded by his loving family on Sunday, August 4, 2024.\n\nCharlie \"Bud\" was born in Baltimore, MD to the late Charles L. and Hazel F. (King) Clary on October 27, 1943. He was a graduate of Southern Garrett High School in Oakland, MD. He married Eva Mae Perando on June 21, 1968. Charlie worked at Westvaco for 40 years in the wood yard and later in the power center. He was a veteran of the Vietnam War and served in the U.S. Navy for four years (Atsugi, Japan/Fallon, Nevada/U.S.S Hornet/Lemoore, California/Yuma, Arizona) He was awarded the National Defense Service Medal. Charlie was also in the U.S. Navy reserve for four years.\n\nCharlie was preceded in death by his parents, Charles L. Clary and Hazel F. (King) Clary; his sisters and their husbands, Mary F. (Clary) Sanders, James \"Jim\" A. Sanders, Shirley A. (Clary) Bittinger and Robert \"Bob\" Bittinger; his father and mother-in-law, Harold F.

He enjoyed playing pool, good music, traveling the U.S., old westerns, NASCAR, and riding his Harley with his wife. He loved his family immensely, especially his grandchildren. While he was still able, he always had interesting things to do or talk about. He will be missed greatly.\n\nNo services are planned at this time.
