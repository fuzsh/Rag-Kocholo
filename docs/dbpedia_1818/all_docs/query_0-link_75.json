It is well-known that many Normans and English came into Scotland during this and the previous reigns, who received grants of lands from the crown. The circumstances of his son being a witness to a royal charter (which only tenants-in-chief of the crown, nobles, and ecclesiastics, were privileged to do), proves that the lands he held were a royal fief, and his Norman surname of William, which was also that of his son, never having been borne by natives in Scotland until after Prince Henry, eldest son of David I. had bestowed in upon his second son, (the then reigning monarch), along with the Norman prefix de; lends probability to the conjecture that William was an Anglo-Norman warrior, on whom had been bestowed these lands of Blair. He died in the reign of Alexander II. and left a son, William de Blair. A William de Blair is a witness in a charter of King Alexander III. to the abbacy of Dunfermline, about the year 1260, but it is uncertain if this is the same. William de Blair is said to have had two sons, Sir Bryce, his heir, and David.\" [1]\n\nThis William is mentioned in a contract with with Ralph de Eglinton and the town of Irvine in 1205.[2]\n\nResearch Notes\n\nPer John Burke, this is the earliest cited of this line of Blairs and is the progenitor of the Blairs through to William Blair, Esquire of Blair, who died in 1817, father of five sons and seven daughters.[2]\n\nSources\n\n↑ \"The Scottish Nation - Blair\", Electric Scotland, https://www.electricscotland.com/history/nation/blair.htm\n\n↑ 2.0 2.1 John Burke, A Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Commoners of Great Britain and Ireland, Enjoying Territorial Possessions Or High Official Rank: But Uninvested with Heritable Honours, Volume 4 (London: Henry Colburn, 1838), p. 392, digital images, https://books.google.com/books?id=KikAAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA392.
