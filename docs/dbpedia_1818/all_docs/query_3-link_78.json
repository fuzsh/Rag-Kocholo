        "text": "Tomb of Richard the Lionheart in Fontevraud Abbey, Loire Valley , France. Photo source: https://www.historyextra.com/\n\nRichard I (8th September 1157 – 6th April 1199) was King of England from 1189 until his death in 1199. He also ruled as Duke of Normandy, Aquitaine and Gascony, Lord of Cyprus and Count of Poitiers, Anjou, Maine and Nantes, and was overlord of Brittany at various times during the same period. He was the third of five sons of King Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine, and seemed unlikely to become King, but all his brothers except the youngest, John, predeceased their father. Richard is known as Richard the Lionheart because of his reputation as a great military leader and warrior.\n\nBy the age of 16, Richard had taken command of his own army, putting down rebellions in Poitou against his father. Richard was an important Christian commander during the Third Crusade, leading the campaign after the departure of Philip II of France and achieving considerable victories against his Muslim counterpart, Saladin, although he finalized a peace treaty and ended the campaign without retaking Jerusalem.\n\nRichard was born in England, where he spent his childhood. Before becoming King, however, he lived most of his adult life in the Duchy of Aquitaine, in the southwest of France. Following his accession, he spent very little time, perhaps as little as six months, in England. Most of his life as King was spent on Crusade, in captivity (he was captured shortly before Christmas 1192 near Vienna by Leopold of Austria and was famously ransommed off) or actively defending his lands in France. Rather than regarding his kingdom as a responsibility requiring his presence as ruler, he has been perceived as preferring to use it merely as a source of revenue to support his armies. Nevertheless, he was seen as a pious hero by his subjects. He remains one of the few kings of England remembered more commonly by his epithet than his regnal number, and is an enduring iconic figure both in England and in France.\n\nAs we saw with King John, the second Great Seal of Richard I (1195) shows him bearing a shield depicting three lions passant guardant. This is the first instance of the appearance of this blazon, which later became established as the Royal Arms of England. It is likely, therefore, that Richard introduced this heraldic design. In his earlier Great Seal of 1189, he had used either one lion rampant or what many believe to depict two lions rampant combatant, Arms which he may have adopted from his father.\n\nSecond Great Seal of Richard I. Vintage Print from 1845. Photo source: https://www.antiquemapsandprints.com/\n\nRichard added the third Lion on his second Great Seal (sometime between May 21st and Michaelmas in 1195) as shown by Exchequer accounts or 'Pipe Rolls'. This was to reinforce his position on his return from captivity on the Continent during which time this brother John had tried to launch a rebellion against Richard's regents. Also, by creating a new Great Seal, Richard was able to raise funds from charging to renew old charters under the old Seal. This is believed to have caused a delay in implementing the new Seal until the Spring of 1198.\n\nThe coat of three Lions continues to represent England on several coins, forms the basis of several emblems of English national sports teams (such as the England national football team and the team's \"Three Lions\" anthem) and endures as one of the most recognisable national symbols of England.\n\n​More interesting for Richard heraldically was his first Great Seal. ​\n\nHis Seal shows Richard on horseback, galloping to the right, as shown in the photograph here. His Shield is heavily curved and only shows one half bearing a complete Lion rampant towards the sinister (i.e. the left, according to the Shield-Bearer). Lions are usually shown rampant to the dexter unless it is face-to-face with another Lion on the other half of the Shield which, in this instance, is not shown. Equally, a boss is shown on the profile of the Shield, implying that there is another side the Shield and that the one Lion isn't just squashed into the visible half. If this Lion is not to be taken as an anomaly, Richard's Coat of Arms would only be heraldically correct as Two Lions combatant.\n\nThis idea may appear to be supported by both an eyewitness account of Richard's saddle from the Itinerary of Richard I whilst on Crusade in 1191 and by the poet William the Breton (although he wrote 30 years later). However, other contemporary examples would argue against this and simply reflect artistic license.\n\nReverse of the First Great Seal of King Richard I of England, exhibited in History Museum of Vendée - Les Lucs-sur-Boulogne, Vendée, France. Photo source: Wikipedia/Selbymay.\n\nEven Lions passant (walking) are shown fully within the visible half of the Shield. This includes Richard's three Lions and King John's two as Lord of Ireland. Both the 1171 Seal of Philip d'Alsace, Count of Flanders and Patrick, 6th Earl of Dunbar roughly a century later show a whole Lion rampant within the visible half of the Shield on the equestrian figure on the reverse side but show a whole shield and still just one rampant Lion on the obverse side. On both of Richard's Great Seals, the obverse side simply shows Richard enthroned with symbols of suns, moons, stars and what look like representations of Planta Genista, the broom plant Badge of the Plantagenet Dynasty. There are no other Shields to make a comparison.\n\nEither way, the Shield carried by a king of England in the equestrian figure on the Seal was shown facing away from the viewer up until Richard's father, King Henry II. It therefore cannot be used to confirm anything other than that heraldic devises of any significance were not carried on the front of the Shield. otherwise they would have been shown.\n\nThere is an argument that two Lions back-to-back (or addorsed) were more common at that time and, hence, would have lead to more ambiguity for heraldists then. There is more evidence that, at the time of the beginnings of what we now know as heraldry, heraldic beasts could be portrayed facing either way and this shown with the same Coat of Arms in what we would nowadays effectively consider as inconsistency. The saddle described in the Itinerary may simply have shown decoration rather than anything heraldic.\n\nThat both his uncle, William FitxEmpress, and his half-brother, William Longespée, used a single Lion rampant and that an upright single Lion would have fitted better onto Shields and the tall, upright banners of the time - one such description, from the Itinerary, clearly states a single Lion on Richard's banner (ad regium cum leone ​vexillum) which agrees with a description in the the account of the Third Crusade by Ambrose - clearly suggest that it is highly unlikely that Richard bore anything other than one Lion rampant until his second Great Seal of 1189/95.\n\nThe question, therefore, is where did Richard get the Arms of two Lions passant to add the third Lion to...?\n\nThe Coat of Arms and Flag of Normandy famously show two golden Lions passant on red. Whilst the Channel Islands of Jersey and Guernsey have changed to three Lions, Sark retains the two - The Channel Islands used to be part of Normandy. This Coat of Arms, and even the three Lions, have been erroneously attributed to King William I of England (The Conqueror). Erroneously, because heraldry as we know it didn't exist then.\n\nLions, very much in general at that stage, appear to have been used by the descendants of King Henry I of England, a younger son of The Conqueror. Henry's son-in-law, Geoffrey of Anjou, is probably one of the first people to have adopted a inheritable Coat of Arms showing not only a Lion but a number of Lions (six to be specific). Having lost his only son William in the sinking of the White Ship, Henry was keen to keep in with Geoffrey, the husband of Henry's only other child, Maud, especially as he needed a grandson as heir. (Women, though often instrumental in the order of succession, were generally not looked upon favourably to take on sovereignty in those dark days.)\n\n​Within a few years of Henry I's death he was being described as the 'Lion of Justice' and his (illegitimate) sons 'the cubs of the lion'. He is known to have kept lions and leopards in his menagerie at Woodstock. All of these would only go to show Henry's association with Lions as a symbol.\n\nHenry's nephew and successor, Stephen, has been with attributed one or three Sagittaries (half man, half horse - with or without a bow and arrow) as he ascended the Throne under the zodiac sign of Sagittarius and also with the help of archers. These are purely conjecture from later generations. A royal Banner is known to have existed, but unfortunately, although recorded as closely guarded, no contemporary detailed description exists.\n\nAnd so we come to Richard and John's father King Henry II. Grandson of Henry I through the Maud who had been sidestepped earlier, he is certainly described as carrying Arms but, again, no detailed description exists and, as mentioned, his Shield on his Seal still faces away. His father, brother, sons even, chamberlains and attendants are all known to have used Lions in one way or another, and Henry II was again associated with or variously described as a 'lion', like his grandfather. Henry II looked more to his royal and ducal inheritance through his mother and the grandfather after whom he was named, rather than his father, however capable a person Geoffrey of Anjou was.\n\nUnfortunately, the two Lions of Normandy did not become fixed until centuries after Henry II and the idea that men whom Henry II knighted used two Lions according to the practise of 'patron-in-chivalry' cannot be used to fully justify Henry's use. However, the use of the two Lions, amongst other devices, by so many men closely associated with Henry II, including, after the death of his eldest son, Henry the Young King, his favourite son John, might have meant that Richard wanted to trump them by swapping from one Lion to three!\n\n​\n\nBerengaria of Navarre\n\nBefore leaving Cyprus on crusade, Richard married Berengaria, the first-born daughter of King Sancho VI of Navarre. Richard first grew close to her at a tournament held in her native Navarre. The wedding was held in Limassol on 12th May 1191 at the Chapel of St George and was attended by Richard's sister Joan, whom he had brought from Sicily. The marriage was celebrated with great pomp and splendour. Many feasts and entertainments, public parades and celebrations followed commemorating the event. When Richard married Berengaria he was still officially betrothed to Alys, the daughter of Louis VII of France, and he pushed for the match in order to obtain the Kingdom of Navarre as a fief, as Aquitaine had been for his father. Further, Eleanor championed the match with Berengaria, as Navarre bordered Aquitaine, thereby securing the southern border of her ancestral lands. Richard took his new wife on crusade with him briefly, though they returned separately. Berengaria had almost as much difficulty in making the journey home as her husband did, and she did not see England until after his death. After his release from German captivity, Richard showed some regret for his earlier conduct, but he was not reunited with his wife. The marriage remained childless."
