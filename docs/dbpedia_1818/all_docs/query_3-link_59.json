        "text": "Richard I\n\nking of England\n\nByname:\n\nRichard the Lionheart or Lionhearted\n\nFrench:\n\nRichard Coeur de Lion\n\nBorn:\n\nSeptember 8, 1157, Oxford, England\n\nDied:\n\nApril 6, 1199, Châlus, duchy of Aquitaine (aged 41)\n\nTop Questions\n\nHow did Richard I become king of England?\n\nWhen his brother Henry died, Richard I became heir to the throne of England, and King Henry II asked Richard to yield Aquitaine to his brother John. Unwilling to surrender Aquitaine, Richard joined forces with King Philip II of France in 1189 and drove Henry into abject submission. They forced him to acknowledge Richard as his heir and harried him to his death.\n\nWhat was Richard I like as a king?\n\nRichard I spent little time in England during his reign as king. Rather than planning for the future of the English monarchy, he put everything up for sale to fund the Crusade that he would lead. He managed to raise a fleet and an army and departed for the Holy Land in 1191.\n\nWhat happened to Richard I on his way back to England from the Crusade?\n\nSailing home via the Adriatic, Richard I was captured and imprisoned in the castle of Duke Leopold of Austria, whom he had insulted during the Crusade. He was later handed over to the German emperor Henry VI. He was released in 1194, once the enormous ransom that Henry demanded had been raised by the English.\n\nHow did Richard I die?\n\nRichard I spent the last years of his life in France. In 1199 he was fatally wounded while besieging the castle of the vicomte of Limoges, who had refused to hand over a hoard of gold to Richard. He died at the age of 41.\n\nRichard I (born September 8, 1157, Oxford, England—died April 6, 1199, Châlus, duchy of Aquitaine) was the duke of Aquitaine (from 1168) and of Poitiers (from 1172) and king of England, duke of Normandy, and count of Anjou (1189–99). His knightly manner and his prowess in the Third Crusade (1189–92) made him a popular king in his own time as well as the hero of countless romantic legends. He has been viewed less kindly by more recent historians and scholars.\n\nEarly life\n\nRichard was the third son of Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine. He was given the duchy of Aquitaine, his mother’s inheritance, at age 11 and was enthroned as duke at Poitiers in 1172. Richard possessed precocious political and military ability, won fame for his knightly prowess, and quickly learned how to control the turbulent aristocracy of Poitou and Gascony. Like all of Henry II’s legitimate sons, he had little or no filial piety, foresight, or sense of responsibility. He joined his brothers in the great rebellion (1173–74) against their father, who invaded Aquitaine twice before Richard submitted and received pardon. Thereafter Richard was occupied with suppressing baronial revolts in his own duchy. His harshness infuriated the Gascons, who revolted in 1183 and called in the help of the “Young King” Henry and his brother Geoffrey of Brittany in an effort to drive Richard from his duchy altogether. Alarmed at the threatened disintegration of his empire, Henry II brought the feudal host of his continental lands to Richard’s aid, but the younger Henry died suddenly (June 11, 1183) and the uprising collapsed.\n\nRichard was now heir to England and to Normandy and Anjou (which were regarded as inseparable), and his father wished him to yield Aquitaine to his youngest brother, John. But Richard, a true southerner, would not surrender the duchy in which he had grown up, and even appealed, against Henry II, to the young king of France, Philip II. In November 1188 he did homage to Philip for all the English holdings on French soil and in 1189 openly joined forces with Philip to drive Henry into abject submission. They chased him from Le Mans to Saumur, forced him to acknowledge Richard as his heir, and at last harried him to his death (July 6, 1189).\n\nKing of England\n\nRichard received Normandy on July 20 and the English throne on September 30. Richard, unlike Philip, had only one ambition, to lead the Crusade prompted by Saladin’s capture of Jerusalem in 1187. He had no conception of planning for the future of the English monarchy and put up everything for sale to buy arms for the Crusade. Yet he had not become king to preside over the dismemberment of the Angevin empire. He broke with Philip and did not neglect Angevin defenses on the Continent. Open war was averted only because Philip also took the Crusader’s cross. Richard dipped deep into his father’s treasure and sold sheriffdoms and other offices. With all this he raised a formidable fleet and an army, and in 1190 he departed for the Holy Land, traveling via Sicily.\n\nSicily\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nFit for a King (or Queen): the British Royalty Quiz\n\nRichard found the Sicilians hostile and took Messina by storm (October 4). To prevent the German emperor Henry VI from ruling their country, the Sicilians had elected the native Tancred of Lecce, who had imprisoned the late king’s wife, Joan of England (Richard’s sister), and denied her possession of her dower. By the Treaty of Messina Richard obtained for Joan her release and her dower, acknowledged Tancred as king of Sicily, declared Arthur of Brittany (Richard’s nephew) to be his own heir, and provided for Arthur to marry Tancred’s daughter. This treaty infuriated the Germans, who were also taking part in the Third Crusade, and it incited Richard’s brother John to treachery and rebellion. Richard joined the other Crusaders at Acre on June 8, 1191, having conquered Cyprus on his way there. While at Limassol in Cyprus, Richard married (May 12) Berengaria of Navarre.\n\nThe holy land\n\nAcre fell in July 1191, and on September 7 Richard’s brilliant victory at Arsūf put the Crusaders in possession of Joppa. Twice Richard led his forces to within a few miles of Jerusalem. But the recapture of the city, which constituted the chief aim of the Third Crusade, eluded him. There were fierce quarrels among the French, German, and English contingents. Richard insulted Leopold V, duke of Austria, by tearing down his banner and quarreled with Philip II, who returned to France after the fall of Acre. Richard’s candidate for the crown of Jerusalem was his vassal Guy de Lusignan, whom he supported against the German candidate, Conrad of Montferrat. It was rumoured, unjustly, that Richard connived at Conrad’s murder. After a year’s unproductive skirmishing, Richard (September 1192) made a truce for three years with Saladin that permitted the Crusaders to hold Acre and a thin coastal strip and gave Christian pilgrims free access to the holy places."
