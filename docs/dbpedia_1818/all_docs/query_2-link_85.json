        "text": "Scholars Medal & Medals Ceremony\n\nThe Scholars Medal is a symbol of academic distinction and achievement. It is presented to graduating Scholars during the Schreyer Honors College's Medals Ceremony, traditionally held on the eve of Penn State's commencement exercises.\n\nDesigned by John A. Cook, professor emeritus of art, the medal features an agile lion with extended claws. This lion has become the University's symbol of intellectual excellence. The qualities of 'Scholarly Achievement', 'Integrity of Purpose', and 'Intellectual Curiosity' form the legend of the medal and define the field from which the lion gathers his strength.\n\nThe Gong\n\nA tradition began in the University Scholars Program in 1990, when the ringing of a small brass bell signified the accomplishment of Scholars completing their thesis. This audible symbol of accomplishment often sparked applause and congratulatory words from Schreyer staff and other Scholars.\n\nThe bell was replaced in 2000 with the gong and tradition dictates that only Scholars who have completed their thesis have the right to hit the gong. The gong is also used to call the Medals Ceremony to order and is displayed prominently throughout the ceremony."
