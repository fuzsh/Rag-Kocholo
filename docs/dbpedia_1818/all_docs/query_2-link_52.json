On January 3, 1970, he married Karen Rex and began their family. Clair worked for 25 years as a welder for Struthers Wells in Warren. After Struthers Wells closed, Clair, Karen and their daughter Nikki moved to Virginia Beach, VA., to be closer to their sons Willie and Nathan, and their families, who were serving in the military. After 20 years in Virginia, Clair and Karen moved back to Warren to retire.\n\nClair loved fishing on Chautauqua Lake, the Kinzua Dam, and the Allegheny River. Spending time with his family was also very important to him. Whether it was going to bingo with Karen, going on cruises, and trips to Disney, family was important. He was a member of the Stillwater Lodge in Youngsville and was a 32nd Degree Mason.\n\nAlong with his wife Karen, he is survived by his children William “Willie” (Bonnie) Edwards of Chesapeake, VA., Nathan (Tina) Edwards of Chesapeake, VA., and Nicole “Nikki” (Stephen) Pillars of Warren, PA; grandchildren Natosha, Amanda, Ethan, Jaclin, Aubree, and Nathan Edwards; great-grandson Ayden Smith.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his siblings, Nancy Edwards, Joseph Edwards, Elaine Edwards Larson, Barry Edwards and Tina Edwards; and his grand- children Gavin Edwards, Aria and Amelia Pillars.\n\nA memorial service will be held at a later date. Condolences may be made to the family at nelsonfuneralhome.net.\n\nIn lieu of flowers the family suggests to hug a family member.\n\nThe Nelson Funeral Home and Cremation Services, 314 North Main St., Youngsville, PA. 16371."
