However, some of the defining moments/issues of his reign are discussed below.\n\nAlthough he had been earl of Northumberland since his father's death in 1152, in 1157 that eardom was lost to William as part of his brother Malcolm's dealings with Henry II of England.[7] Regaining Northumberland, which had been held by his father, his grandfather, and his great-grandfather, became almost an obsession with the young king and a recurring theme throughout the entirety of his reign.[8]\n\nIn 1168 he sent a delegation to France to make a formal alliance with King Louis VII.[9] In the spring of 1174, King William allied himself with Henry's eldest son who had organized a rebellion against his father, and promised William the earldom of Northumberland would be returned to him in exchange for his aid in this rebellion.[10] William consequently invaded England, besieging Carlisle and taking several castles in Northumberland and Westmoreland.[11] In July of the same year, he was captured by the English at Alnwick in Northumberland and eventually taken as a prisoner to France.[1][12] On 8 December 1174 , he was forced to sign a convention at Falaise in Normandy which completely surrendered Scotland's independence and put the entire nation under English domination.[13] William was released and allowed to return to Scotland in February 1175, when all of the terms of the convention had been met.[13][14]\n\nDuring the following years King William was able to successfully subdue by force a number of rebellions, including a major uprising in the north led by Donald Ban MacWilliam,[15] and create a more unified Scottish kingdom.[7] He also championed the independence of the Scottish Church, insisting it should not come under the jurisdiction of the archbishop of York in England.[9] He gave substantial support to a number of churches, which included in 1178 founding and endowing the Abbey of Arbroath in Angus.[13][14]\n\nBy 1189 England had a new king, one who was very anxious to finance a crusade.[7] In a document later known as the \"Quit-claim of Canterbury\" Richard sold all rights in Scotland (which Henry II had forced William to give up at Falaise) back to King William for 10,000 merks, and formally acknowledged Scotland's independence.[16][1] The fate of the earldom of Northumberland was intentionally left ambiguous in the Quitclaim, as Richard did not want to give it up and William was determined to have it back.[16]\n\nOn 13 March 1192, Pope Celestine III decreed that the Scottish Church was a \"special daughter\" of the apostolic see and subject to it without intermediaries.[9] This was a formal acknowledgement that the Scottish Church was totally independent of the English Church, and another major victory for King William.\n\nWhile King William did not greatly enlarge the boundaries of Scotland, he was able to regain everything that had been lost at Falaise and he did leave the nation more strongly unified than ever before.[7] He himself strongly identified with French culture, the legacy of his mother's family, and French was the language most frequently spoken in his court.[17] He was not known as \"the Lion\" during his lifetime, that is a nickname which appeared much later and may have been a reference to the lion on his shield.[7]\n\nMarriage and Children\n\nAlthough he had a number of mistresses and fathered more than a few illegitimate children, King William was over 40 years of age before he felt obliged to marry and provide Scotland with a legitimate heir to the throne.[8] He originally chose as his bride Matilda of Saxony, the granddaughter of Henry II and daughter of Duke Henry the Lion.[18][9] However, the pope forbade this marriage on the grounds of consanguinity.[9] [19] Henry II then proposed Ermengarde Beaumont, daughter of Richard de Beaumont, Vicomte of Beaumont-en-Maine and Lucy de l'Aigle as a potential bride. Because Ermengarde's paternal grandmother was an illegitimate daughter of Henry I, the Scottish nobles reacted negatively to this suggestion.[9] King William agreed to the match with some reluctance, after being promised Edinburgh Castle as part of the bride's dower.[9]\n\nWilliam and Ermengarde were married 5 September 1186 at Woodstock, Oxfordshire.[1][20] There were at least five children from this marriage:\n\nAlexander II, King of Scots; b. 24 Aug 1198;[21][22][23] m(1) 19 Jun 1221 Joan Plantagenet;[22][23] m(2) Marie de Coucy;[22][24] d. 8 Jul 1249[22][23]\n\nMalcolm Dunkeld; b. bef. 1214[25]\n\nMargaret Dunkeld; m.

Heinrich Borwin II, lord of Rostock[45][46]\n\nMaud/Mathilde, nun at Lappion;[47] d. 1220[48][37]\n\nDeath\n\nWilliam I, King of Scots, died at Stirling on 4 December 1214, at the age of 71.[49][50][51] He was buried in front of the high altar in the church at the monastery of Arbroath, which he had founded.[1][51]\n\nResearch Notes\n\nIsabel de Avenal was originally attached to this profile as a wife of William the Lion. Because there appears to be no evidence advanced by any historian or genealogist suggesting there was ever a formal relationship between William and Isabel, her profile has been detached pending any future research which may be discovered. Stevens-17832 14:52, 2 September 2021 (UTC)\n\nRobert Canmore has been detached as an illegitimate son of William the Lion, lacking any evidence whatsoever to support a familial relationship.
