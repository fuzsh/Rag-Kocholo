        "text": "This edited article about Scotland originally appeared in Look and Learn issue number 364 published on 4 January 1969.\n\nAny military strategist will stress that fighting on two fronts usually leads to disaster. And, by the middle of the 12th century, the greatest threat to Scotland lay in that possibility.\n\nIn the reign of David I, the monarchy had grown stronger and the country had become more feudalised. But rebellion was never far away in many parts of the country, particularly in the Highlands and the Western Isles, where Celtic fervour had scant respect for the Crown.\n\nWhile a strong Scottish king could, with difficulty, keep the more unruly parts of his country under control, he could not afford at the same time to risk too much trouble with his neighbours in England.\n\nAs Scotland’s kings resided in the Lowlands, any attack there by the English would mean a very grave threat to the Scottish crown’s power. English invasions of southern Scotland could always inflict more damage than Scottish raids on northern England. And, if the English did attack, it was quite likely that rebellion within Scotland would take place at the same time. In those days, the seat of power could be an unenviable seat – though, even so, there were enough people only too eager to make it their own.\n\n* * *\n\nWith a large army, a handsome eleven-year-old boy rode through Scotland, and was presented to noble after noble. Accompanied by Duncan, the Earl of Fife, in whose charge he had been placed, the young boy sought acknowledgement of his claim to the throne of Scotland. And, one by one, the nobles accepted his right to rule.\n\nKing David was dying, and knew it. Faithful Scotland would mourn his death greatly, but David feared that his country would have greater cause for sadness than just his passing. In 1152, his son Henry had died, which meant that the next in line of succession was David’s grandson, Malcolm. And, as history had shown, a child’s accession usually meant bloodshed and upheaval as rival claimants fought for the kingship.\n\nWith Scotland in such a delicate period of transition, any such disputes could bring disastrous chaos to the country once more. So David had decided that his young grandson should be introduced to the people as their future king.\n\nWhen David died in 1153, Malcolm was immediately crowned at Scone, the traditional coronation seat of Scottish kings – and an unseemly struggle for kingly power was averted.\n\nUsually Malcolm’s reign is depicted as brief and unimportant and he is remembered by the unfortunate nickname, the Maiden – though that was most certainly a reference to his good looks rather than a suggestion that he was soft or unmanly. But the final effects of his rule were to be to his country’s advantage, even if at first the signs indicated otherwise.\n\nWithin a short time of his coming to the throne, there was a revolt by some of the dissident Scottish chiefs, led by Somerled, the Lord of the Isles. But Malcolm’s advisers and supporters managed to suppress the revolt. Peace was made with Somerled in 1158, and Scotland’s domestic state, if not entirely settled, remained certainly no more unsettled than it had been.\n\nRelations with England needed to be kept peaceful while Malcolm was growing up, and Henry II of England realised that he could take advantage of Malcolm’s youth and the confused state of Scotland. He summoned Malcolm to Chester in 1157, and demanded of the boy king the return of all the fiefs his grandfather, David had held in the north. Malcolm agreed to return Northumberland, Cumbria and Westmorland in return for his right to the Earldom of Huntingdon.\n\nThis concession by Malcolm was viewed with contempt by many Scots, but it does seem possible that Malcolm was showing a wisdom beyond his years in not protesting strongly. His claim to the lands in question could never have been anything but precarious, and they might well have been more trouble than they were worth, particularly at that time.\n\nWhatever pressure was brought to bear upon him this time, Malcolm seems to have found no reason to quarrel with Henry, who was a shrewd and capable monarch. It was in the English king’s service that Malcolm passed from boyhood to manhood. He learned valuable lessons fighting for Henry in France, where he was knighted at Tours for his bravery in 1159.\n\nThey were lessons well learned and profitable, as the young King showed when he returned suddenly to Scotland to put down a revolt led by the Earl of Strathearn. An attempt to ambush and kill Malcolm at Perth was foiled, and from then on he pursued a policy of suppressing or appeasing the troublesome clans. He put down Galloway, then Moray, a province which had caused discomfort to the crown for many years. In this action, he again showed wisdom, for instead of slaughtering the clans, as he was urged, he had them transferred to other parts of the kingdom where their ferocity might possibly be turned to the crown’s advantage, and could certainly no longer be strong enough to challenge its authority.\n\nIn 1164, there was a final rising in the West by Somerled, who was a most aggressive leader. With a fleet of 150 ships, he sailed up the Clyde and landed at Renfrew, where he joined battle with Malcolm’s army. The men of the Isles were soundly defeated, and Somerled and his son Gillecolum were killed. And, although the Isles still did not come under the control of the Scottish crown, they were for a time far less of a threat to it.\n\nSadly, it was at about this time that Malcolm’s health failed, and in the following year, 1165, he died, at the age of twenty-four. When he had come to the throne, his youth had seemed a handicap; but by the end of his reign, Scotland was far from the chaos that could have resulted from his accession. By extremists, he was criticised for yielding too much to England, but, in the circumstances of the time, he had acted cannily (often regarded as a Scottish virtue), by at least keeping steady the tightrope of troubles along which Scotland had to balance.\n\nMore attention is usually paid to Malcolm’s brother, William the Lion, who succeeded him. But, though William’s reign was the longest in Scottish history, it can be simply and conveniently outlined. If Malcolm, in his short reign, had successfully trod the tightrope, William, though by no means an incompetent monarch, seems to have stumbled heavily along what could have been a flat, straightforward track.\n\nRelations with England were fairly reasonable again, which gave Scotland a better chance of settling her internal problems. But William, who had acted as guardian of the country during his brother’s mortal illness, commenced his own reign by visiting Henry II at Windsor to ask for the return of Northumberland. Henry refused his demand, which in due course led to a violent quarrel between the two kings.\n\nIn 1173, after the murder of Becket, Henry faced a conspiracy from his three sons, and William, in return for his aid against Henry was promised Northumberland. Only too pleased “to make old losses good by a new conflict”, William invaded Northumberland, that scene of so many conflicts. But, in place of victory there occurred one of Scotland’s greatest humiliations.\n\nAlnwick had witnessed a Scottish tragedy when Malcolm III was slain there. Now it was to witness a blow to the fierce Scottish pride. With only a part of his army, William was besieging Alnwick Castle, and had decided to rest there for a while.\n\nIt is said that, in July, 1174, on a plain near the castle, William and a few of his knights were holding a jousting tournament. Suddenly, from out of a mist that had descended, there emerged a band of Yorkshire knights who had lost their way. Led by Ranulf de Glanville, they could hardly believe their good fortune, and took William prisoner without much difficulty.\n\n“With his feet shackled beneath the belly of his horse”, William was taken to Henry II at Northampton, imprisoned for a while in Richmond Castle, and then sent to Falaise, in Normandy.\n\nTo regain his freedom, he was made to sign the humiliating Treaty of Falaise, (December, 1174) by which he was forced to acknowledged Henry as his overlord and to agree to Scotland’s total feudal subjection to England. At the same time, the castles of Edinburgh, Stirling, Roxburgh, Jedburgh and Berwick were forfeited to England and garrisons there were to be supported at Scottish expense. Never before had Scotland been reduced to such servility.\n\nThis state of affairs existed for fifteen years, and Scottish hearts must have raged quietly. But, then, in July, 1189, Henry died and was succeeded by his son, Richard I. Crowned in September of the same year, Richard was going to join the Third Crusade in December, and for this he needed money. In return for a considerable sum from Scotland, he freed William from all his obligations to England and once more made Scotland an independent country.\n\nIt proved a wise move on Richard’s part, and during his reign peace reigned between the two countries. The two monarchs became good friends, William contributing money to the Lionheart’s ransom and occupying a place of honour during Richard’s second coronation, in 1194. But, even so, friendly as the two kings were, Richard never agreed to William’s frequent requests for the return of the northern counties. Nor did John, who succeeded Richard in 1199, when once again relations between England and Scotland became strained, with periodic outbursts of fighting.\n\nWilliam died at Stirling in 1214 – and so ended an important era. But opinions of him appear to be divided. It can hardly be denied that Scotland’s well-being had progressed during his reign. He became the chief founder of burghs in Scotland, and most of the chief towns in Scotland can trace their charters back to his reign. He also succeeded in suppressing more of the rebellious outlying districts in Scotland. But one cannot resist the suspicion that his wisdom in domestic policies is somewhat annulled by his eagerness to assert Scottish pride in relations with England.\n\nThis pride meant a bad fall for William early in his reign, and though it was probably regarded as just bad luck by Scottish diehards and did not lose him too much respect, one cannot help feeling that his reign might have been even more successful if he had copied his brother Malcolm’s example in trying to put Scotland’s own house in order before falling out with the powerful next-door neighbour."
