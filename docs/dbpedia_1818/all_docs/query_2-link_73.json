Mule deer and wild turkey are frequently seen throughout the park, and rare residents include bobcats and mountain lions.\n\nThough its forest may seem timeless, each season brings dramatic changes: from winter snowfall to spring wildflowers, there is always something new to experience at Heise.\n\nIn addition to trails, you can take advantage of cabins, trailer sites, individual tent sites, and a group-tent camping area, along with several playgrounds, restrooms with coin-operated showers and ample picnic spaces. Rangers lead activities every weekend, and the park office with a small museum is open during the day or by appointment. This park makes a gorgeous setting for weddings and special events!\n\nView the Birds of William Heise Activity Kit and Junior Rangers Activity Kit!\n\nVisit the News & Events page for park events, updates and closures.\n\nView Development Projects."
