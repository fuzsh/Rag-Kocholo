        "text": "ATTENTION PARK USERS\n\nPieces of spent artillery shells from prior to World War II have been found in the park, and this indicates a potential that unexploded pieces of artillery could be in the park.\n\nFor your safety:\n\n·Recognize that old artillery shells or military munitions could resemble a baseball, a pointed pipe, a soda can, a muffler or other metal objects.\n\n·Retreat from the item - DO NOT TOUCH, MOVE OR DISTURB IT. Immediately leave the area following the same path used to enter the area.\n\n·Report the item by calling 911.\n\nFor additional Information:\n\nColorado Department of Public Health and Environment: (303) 692-3304 www.cdphe.state.co.us\n\nCity of Lakewood: (303) 697-6154\n\nFor more information on Camp George West & Green Mountain, visit: https://cdphe.colorado.gov/camp-george-west-green-mountain\n\nGreen Mountain Trail (6.6 mile loop)\n\nFeatures a challenging ascent to the park's highest point as well as a mellow section along the base of the park that is great for beginner hikers, runners and mountain bikers. Please note that a portion of this trail follows the park service road that accesses the radio towers.\n\nHayden Trail (1.6 miles)\n\nAccessed from the Utah Trailhead, this trail switchbacks up the south side of the mountain and connects with the Green Mountain Trail. Several loop options are possible. It is a slightly easier route to the summit than the Green Mountain Trail.\n\nSummit Loop Trail (2.75 miles)\n\nA very scenic trail around a portion of the park's summit. Including exceptional views to the north. This is also the access trail for Box-o-Rox.\n\nRooney Valley Trail (3.8 miles)\n\nA challenging single track trail that offers a sense of solitude and remoteness.\n\nBox-o-Rox Trail (2.1 miles)\n\nAnother challenging single track trail considered a favorite of local mountain bikers. This trail includes a lower section that offers more technical terrain than other park trails, and includes challenging rock section with alternate lines.\n\nNorth Access Trail (2 miles)\n\nThis trail is accessed from Indiana Avenue and accesses the summit from the north side of the park.\n\nNarrow Point Trail (1.2 miles)\n\nThis trail runs from the intersection of S. Alkire St. and W. Cedar Dr. and connects to the North Access Trail.\n\nTrail Use Guidelines\n\nPlease help protect park resources by remaining on designated trails only. Avoid using wet or muddy trails; the trails tend to dry earlier than many of the foothills parks, making the park a fantastic winter destination.\n\nProper yielding guidelines:\n\nCyclists yield to ALL other trail users. Slow to a safe speed to pass. Make calm and friendly verbal contact prior to passing. Dismount for equestrians.\n\nPedestrians should avoid blocking the trail. Yield to equestrians.\n\nAll users must keep dogs on a leash at all times. Be courteous, communicate and listen. The trails are for everyone!\n\nView More Trail Rules"
