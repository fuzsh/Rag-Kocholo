        "text": "The Howard County Department of Fire and Rescue Services offers exceptional and diverse career opportunities for men and women seeking professional development and satisfaction. With excellent salaries and benefits, a variety of job assignments, unlimited opportunities for advancement and the chance to make a profound difference in the community.\n\nMinimum Qualifications\n\nMust possess a valid Motor Vehicle Class C Operator's driver's license issued by the State of residence;\n\nPossess a High School Diploma or GED;\n\nMust provide documentation of eligibility to legally work in the United States.\n\nAs a condition of employment, persons selected for all future training classes shall not use tobacco products in any form throughout the term of their employment whether on or off duty. Any use of tobacco products during the term of employment shall constitute grounds for disciplinary action and/or termination.\n\nApplication information will be updated when available.\n\nYou must apply through the County's job portal at www.governmentjobs.com/careers/howardcounty\n\nThe Candidate Physical Ability Test (CPAT) will be offered to those candidates who have passed the written exam. Once you have received a notification that you have passed the written test, links to a Mentorship and Testing Sign Up Genius will be forwarded to the email address you provided. There is no need to call Human Resources inquiring about the CPAT schedule.\n\nYou must bring your photo ID and the completed Physician Authorization form. All candidates MUST wear LONG pants.\n\nPlease review and prepare the following forms (as applicable):\n\nCPAT Orientation Guide\n\nCPAT Preparation Guide\n\nCPAT Physician Authorization Form\n\nA day in the life of a trainee during their first two weeks:\n\nAn instructional video of the CPAT course:\n\nHoward County Fire & Rescue is looking for professional, dedicated, and enthusiastic men and women that value the importance of serving the community. Take the time to ask yourself what values you hold as a high priority in your own life. Howard County FF/EMT’s and Paramedics focus on coming together as a team during each shift to make the best decisions on each call they run. They are trusted by the local community to use all the skills learned in some of the most challenging situations.\n\nInterview information will be disseminated as it becomes available.\n\nIn addition to responding to fire and medical emergencies, life inside a firehouse is packed with activity. HCDFRS career personnel typically work on one of three shifts (A,B,C). Each shift works for 24 hours at the fire station and then has 48 hours off. Personnel may be required to work a 12-hours peak load or 40-hour daywork schedule\n\nDuring shifts, personnel run calls, train, shower, eat and sleep at the fire station. Firefighters have a wide range of responsibilities, not only to hone the skills required of firefighting and medical emergencies, but also for the upkeep of the firehouse, equipment, and all the apparatus. All firefighters are on rotating schedules. Everyday activities firefighters engage in include:\n\nDaily checks of all apparatus (checking fuel levels, examining for damage or wear, etc)\n\nInventory of supplies on the apparatus and in the station\n\nCleaning the fire station – to include the bathrooms, bunk area, mopping, etc.\n\nDiscussions of safety drills and creating safety messages to share with personnel\n\nDaily training drills\n\nParticipate in mandatory fitness and conditioning program\n\nMaintaining professional appearance and appropriate personal hygiene\n\nAttend workshops or classes designed to inform firefighters on the latest advancements in medical technology, fire science, emergency treatment and prevention\n\nCooking the meals\n\nDiscussion of recent or past firefighting, emergency medical responses and working out strategies to cope with unexpected occurrences during emergencies.\n\nEvery activity is important and given attention, no matter how small it might seem! A fire engine cannot respond to an emergency if it is low on fuel. A face mask can cause a fatality if it has a crack in it. A firefighter’s entire day is spent, in one way or another, preparing for emergencies. In our department SAFETY is the top priority!\n\nTeamwork is another key component of HCDFRS. Modern fire stations have separate sleeping and bathroom/shower facilities for men and women. Older stations have been retrofitted with separate bathroom/shower facilities, but common sleeping areas remain. The Department makes every effort to provide the best available solution to privacy issues at each station.\n\nLike members of the armed services, firefighters and EMTs follow a command structure based on rank, with firefighters and EMTs at the lower end of the scale. A paramilitary structure requires you to take orders from those of higher rank. When on duty, firefighters cannot leave the station to take care of personal business nor can they make or receive cell phone calls while en route to or working on an incident. Firefighters are expected to come work on time every day they are scheduled to work including during snowstorms, hurricanes or other severe weather. Lateness is not tolerated. You are held accountable for your behavior – off and on the job, inside and outside Howard County."
