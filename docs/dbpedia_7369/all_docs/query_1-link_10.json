Domestic abuse essentially involves the misuse of power and exercise of control by one person over another with whom there is or has been an intimate relationship.\n\nPhysical Abuse: Occurs when one person uses physical pain or threat of physical force to intimidate another person. Actual physical abuse may involve simple slaps or pushes, or it may involve a full physical beating to include punching, kicking, hair pulling, scratching, spitting on, threatening with a weapon and real physical damage sufficient in some cases which require hospitalization.\n\nPsychological Abuse: Also known as emotional abuse, occurs when one person controls information available to another person so as to manipulate that person’s sense of reality; what is acceptable and what is not acceptable. Psychological abuse often contains strong emotionally manipulative content designed to force the victim to comply with the abuser’s wishes. It may be emotional abuse in this sense when it is designed to cause emotional pain to victims or to “mess with their heads” in attempts to gain compliance and counter any resistance.\n\nFinancial Abuse: Can take on many forms, from denying you all access to funds, to making you solely responsible for all finances while handling money irresponsibly him/herself. Money becomes a tool by which the abuser can further control the victim, ensuring financial dependence on the abuser, or shifting the responsibility of keeping a roof over the family’s head onto the victim while simultaneously denying your ability to do so or obstructing you.\n\nTension Building Phase: Moodiness, sullen, faultfinding and very critical, withdraw affection, isolate partner, belittle partner, make threats\n\nAcute Explosion Phase: Beat partner often severely, rape, attach with weapons, extremely verbally abusive\n\nHoneymoon Phase: Apologizes, cry and beg for forgiveness, promises to get help, to go for counseling, to do “whatever it takes”, send flowers and presents, promise it will never happen again, make up sex\n\nReporting Options\n\nRestricted:Restricted reporting allows a victim of intimate partner violence the option of reporting an incident of violence to the victim advocate, family advocacy program manager or social work services case manager and receive victim advocacy services and medical care without starting a law enforcement investigation or having command involvement. It is intended to give victims the care and support they need and the extra time to make more informed decision regarding reporting to command or law enforcement. A victim has the right to change a restricted report to unrestricted at any time within one year from the initial restricted report.\n\nUnrestricted: Unrestricted reporting involves a victim making a report to the service members command, Family Advocacy program or Law enforcement. The incident will be fully investigated and the victim will have access to victim advocacy services and FAP clinical services.\n\nWhat can you do to ensure safety?\n\nIf the situation is lethal and you can leave safely, do so\n\nContact a victim advocate or local shelter for safety planning and resources\n\nSeek a civilian or military protective order\n\nChange locks, add lighting and a possible alarm system or door/window sensors\n\nInform family, friends and neighbors of your situation so that they may also keep a look out\n\nTell your supervisor and/or school/daycare about your situation so that they may assist\n\nAlways let someone know your whereabouts, be aware of your surroundings\n\nWho do I call for help?\n\nFort Detrick Family Advocacy: +1(301) 619-7171 or +1(301) 619-7453\n\nHeartly House 24-Hour Hotline: +1(301) 662-8800\n\nFort Detrick Domestic Violence Victim Advocate 24-hour Hot Line: +1(301) 514-9544\n\nNational Domestic Violence Hotline: +1(800) 799-7233 or www.ndvh.org\n\nFirst Call for Help to Maryland Programs & Services Aid: 2-1-1\n\nDirectorate of Emergency Services (DES): +1(301) 619-7114\n\nMilitary One Source: +1(800) 342-9647\n\nMaryland Network Against Domestic Violence (MNADV) http://mnadv.org\n\nThe Women’s Law Center of Maryland: +1(410) 321-8761 or http://www.wlcmd.org\n\nNew Parent Support Program (NPSP)\n\nNew Parent Support Program\n\nThe Army’s New Parent Support Program is a key secondary prevention program within the Family Advocacy Program which falls under the umbrella of Army Community Service.
