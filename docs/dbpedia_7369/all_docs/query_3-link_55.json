        "text": "Division Chronicle\n\nThe 3d Division first saw action in the North African invasion, landing at Fedala, 8 November 1942, and capturing half of French Morocco. On 10 July 1943, the Division made an assault landing on Sicily, fought its way into Palermo before the armor could get there, and raced on to capture Messina, thus ending the Sicilian campaign. Nine days after the Italian invasion, 18 September 1943, the 3d landed at Salerno and in intensive action drove to and across the Volturno and to Cassino.\n\nAfter a brief rest, the Division was ordered to hit the beaches at Anzio, 22 January 1944, where for 4 months it maintained its toe-hold against furious German counterattacks. On 29 February 1944, the 3d fought off an attack by three German Divisions. In May the Division broke out of the beachhead and drove on to Rome, and then went into training for the invasion of Southern France.\n\nOn 15 August 1944, another D-day, the Division landed at St. Tropez, advanced up the Rhone Valley, through the Vosges Mountains, and reached the Rhine at Strasbourg, 26-27 November. After maintaining defensive positions it took part in clearing the Colmar Pocket, 23 January18 February 1945, and on 15 March struck against Siegfried Line positions south of Zweibrucken. The Division smashed through the defenses and crossed the Rhine, 26 March 1945 ; then drove on to take Nurnberg in a fierce battle, capturing the city in block-by-block fighting, 17-20 April. The 3d pushed on to take Augsburg and Munich, 27-30 April, and was in the vicinity of Salzburg when the war in Europe ended.\n\nDivision Organization\n\n7th Infantry Regiment\n\n15th Infantry Regiment\n\n30th Infantry Regiment\n\n3rd Reconnaissance Troop (Mechanized)\n\n10th Engineer Combat Battalion\n\n3rd Medical Battalion\n\nHHB Division Artillery\n\n10th Field Artillery Battalion (105mm Howitzer)\n\n39th Field Artillery Battalion (105mm Howitzer)\n\n41st Field Artillery Battalion (105mm Howitzer)\n\n9th Field Artillery Battalion (155mm Howitzer)\n\n741st Tank Battalion (attached)\n\n756th Tank Battalion (attached)\n\n601st Tank Destroyer Battalion (attached)\n\n703d Ordnance Light Maintenance Company\n\n3rd Quartermaster Company\n\n3rd Signal Company\n\nMilitary Police Platoon\n\nHeadquarters Company"
