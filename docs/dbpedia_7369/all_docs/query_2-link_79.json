        "text": "Subject: NPS Morning Report - Thursday, May 27, 1999\n\nDate: Thu, 27 May 1999 05:16:45 -0400\n\nNATIONAL PARK SERVICE MORNING REPORT To: All National Park Service Areas and Offices From: Division of Ranger Activities, Washington Office Day/Date: Thursday, May 27, 1999 INCIDENTS 99-213 - Denali NP&P (AK) - Rescue On the afternoon of Friday, May 21st, Colorado climber M.D., 45, fell 120 feet while ascending a difficult ice couloir on the southwest ridge of Mt. Hunter. M.D. and his partner, Jim Donini, were 2,600 feet up the route when M.D.'s protection failed and he fell, striking Donini in the thigh with his crampon points. M.D. sustained an open fracture of one leg and an ankle fracture of the other. Donini was able to lower M.D. 150 feet, but was unable to continue due to both of their injuries. He secured M.D. at about the 10,000 foot level and descended the mixed rock, snow and ice route to their camp on the Kahiltna Glacier. Only minutes later, a passing Talkeetna Air Taxi pilot spotted Donini and picked him up. Darkness and poor weather grounded rescue teams until Saturday morning, when an partial assessment of the situation was possible. M.D. was tied into a small ledge 2,400 feet from the bottom of the route and 1,100 feet from the small (approximately ten foot by ten foot) mushroom-shaped top. The near vertical slope and deep coulior appeared to negate a short-haul helicopter evacuation. It appeared a raising was the only possible means of rescue. This would require short-hauling rescuers to the summit, who would then descend to M.D. and arrange a technical raising followed by a short-haul removal of all from the summit. The weather forecast was for continued unsettled weather. Due to the several previous days of exhausting rescue activity, the Alaska Region's Type II incident management team (Hunter Sharp, IC) was called in to assist the park's staff. Throughout Saturday, additional resources were brought in, including hand-picked parajumpers from the Air National Guard and five members of the Alaska Mountain Rescue Group. As the weather cleared on Sunday morning, a slightly different helicopter approach was visible that had been obscured by clouds the day before. Ranger Billy Shott was short-hauled on a 200-foot rope to a point about 40 feet below M.D.. With the helicopter hovering, Shott climbed to M.D. and clipped him into his harness; Lama pilot Carl Cotton then backed away, swinging both out to safety. M.D. was the seventh climber rescued this season and the sixth bonafide save. [Ken Kehrer, CR, DENA, 5/25] 99-214 - Western Arctic NP (AK) - Search in Progress On the morning of May 22nd, rangers were notified of two overdue hunters who had last been seen departing their hunting camp in Cape Krusenstern NM. The missing men - D.S., 70, and R.B., 62 - are lifetime residents of the Kotzebue area. Both maintain traditional, subsistence- oriented lifestyles and are highly regarded in the Inupiat Eskimo community as expert hunters and travelers. According to family members, the men left their camp on Thursday, May 20th, for a day of oogruk (bearded seal) hunting on the pack ice. They were known to be traveling together by snowmobile and were carrying a portable VHF radio. State troopers were contacted when they failed to return by Friday night, and a multi-agency air search was begun on Saturday. Searchers flew grid patterns over the coastlines of Cape Krusenstern, Bering Land Bridge NP and much of Kotzebue Sound over the weekend. Low clouds, ice fog and the shifting pack ice complicated efforts. By Sunday afternoon, fog and icing conditions had forced some search planes to land and overnight on area beaches. A report of possible VHF transmissions from the missing men near the Cape Krusenstern's northwest boundary shifted the search focus towards Kivalina on Monday. Weather conditions remained marginal, with blowing snow and fog. By the end of the day, pilots and crews had covered approximately 4,500 square miles. Search efforts continued Tuesday, with nine aircraft flying grids from Sealing Point in Cape Krusenstern to Cape Thompson. Local weather has improved, with blowing snow changing to low clouds and light fog. [Greg Dudgeon, CR, WEAR, 5/25] 99-215 - Mount Rainier NP (WA) - Climbing Fatality Two climbers on Thumb Rock, a high camp on Liberty Ridge, called rangers on the evening of Monday, May 24th, and reported that a climbing partner was missing after an accident. The 31-year-old man from British Columbia had been skiing beneath Black Pyramid when he lost his edge, cartwheeled out of control, and disappeared from sight off Liberty Ridge. The Black Pyramid is at 12,000 feet; Thumb Rock is at 10,700 feet. Rangers Debbie Brenchley and Mike Gauthier flew in from Kautz Creek and found the man's body on the Carbon Glacier beneath the Willis Wall, notorious for frequent ice falls, rock falls, and avalanches. While Brenchley and Gauthier waited on the Carbon Glacier for the helicopter to return with additional personnel, an avalanche lasting approximately one minute descended down the chute where the victim had fallen, partially covering him. Continued avalanche activity led to the decision to remove the rangers from the scene. Weather permitting, rangers were going to attempt to retrieve the body via helicopter yesterday morning at first light, before the sun hit the high glacial terrain. Plans called for a second helicopter to hover nearby in case of an avalanche. The victim's name had not yet been released at the time of the report. Steve Winslow is IC. [Maria Gillett, PIO, MORA, 5/25] 99-216 - Denali NP&P (AK) - Assist: Multi-Casualty Accident Rangers responded to a mutual aid request for assistance at a motor vehicle accident 75 miles south of park headquarters on the George Parks Highway on May 20th. Park staff responded in an ambulance and joined other units in the extrication and stabilization of five critically injured persons and one fatality. Patients were evacuated by air by military and private ambulance helicopters. The single-vehicle accident occurred on a stretch of highway between Anchorage and Fairbanks that is as far from medical care as can be found in the area. The park hosted a previously-scheduled, multi-casualty drill simulating a bus rollover two days later. Over 100 people from several volunteer EMS and SAR organizations participated. [Ken Kehrer, CR, DENA, 5/25] 99-217 - Grand Canyon NP (AZ) - Multiple Rescues Park rescue personnel were kept extremely busy with multiple SAR incidents on May 10th. The series of calls started with an afternoon request for assistance to an exhausted hiker on the Bright Angel trail, but he was eventually able to get out on his own. Fifteen minutes later, a 31-year-old female suffering from hyponatremia (a decreased concentration of sodium in the blood) was reported to be in distress a mile-and-a-half down the same trail. Just a minute later, as a response was being initiated, dispatch was contacted by staff from the Bureau Of Indian Affairs at Supai Village, who reported an injured hiker below Beaver Falls in Havasu Creek within the park. The party on the Bright Angel trail was evacuated by a backup NPS helicopter with a sodium level of 127 (the normal range is from 135 to 145). The primary NPS helicopter responded to Havasu Creek and conducted a helicopter short- haul extraction of a 35-year-old male with a broken ankle in rugged terrain. The patient was transferred to Classic Air Ambulance, which had staged nearby. Meanwhile, another advanced life support medevac was completed out of the Pipe Creek area on the Colorado River below Phantom Ranch for an 80- year-old male with dehydration. The man believed that he had driven his car to the bottom of the canyon and was hallucinating that there were objects that prevented him from moving. A second backup helicopter had to be brought in to complete the mission. During these incidents, the Bureau Of Indian Affairs called back to report a second fall victim in Havasu Creek at Mooney Falls. A 34-year-old man had suffered a possible head injury, a broken wrist, and multiple abrasions. Due to the location outside the park, the Coconino County Sheriff's Department was notified and an Arizona Department Of Public Safety (DPS) helicopter was dispatched out of Kingman. When this helicopter later developed mechanical problems en route and had to return to base, another DPS helicopter was dispatched out of Flagstaff. The remote location and lateness in the day became a concern and the NPS crew from the Beaver Falls incident was asked to handle the call at Mooney Falls. The NPS aircraft was able to land near the patient and transport him to the original staging helispot for a transfer to Classic Lifeguard, which was still standing by with the first patient. Michael Nash served as the IC for this series of calls, which occurred over a period of four hours and involved a total of six helicopters. [Ken Phillips, SAR Coordinator, GRCA, 5/25] 99-218 - Catoctin Mountain Park (MD) - Ordnance Disposal On May 17th, a visitor reported a suspicious object in a backcountry section of the park. Ranger John Kempisty found what appeared to be an unexploded mortar round left over from WWII military use of the area and secured the site. On May 19th, emergency ordnance disposal (EOD) technicians from Fort Meade determined that the round was a 60mm, M-49, high-explosive shell and destroyed it on site. Protection, resource management and red-carded personnel were involved in the coordinated response. This is the first WWII ordnance item found in the park. A DOD site restoration survey was recently completed; no items were found. Although no further hazards are thought to exist, DOD personnel will be reviewing this earlier assessment. [Roger Steintl, CR, CATO, 5/21] 99-219 - Coronado NM (AZ) - Illegal Aliens Over the three-day period from May 23rd to the 25th, Border Patrol agents apprehended over 155 undocumented aliens on the park's east boundary. Two associated \"load\" vehicles were impounded and towed by rangers after being abandoned during one particular smuggling attempt. Backtracking by rangers revealed that the vast majority of those apprehended had crossed the international border on park lands.
