Infantry Division, 1943–1945\n\nThe division was the basis of the organization of the ground forces. It was the basic large unit, the largest units being corps and armies, but it was the smallest U.S. Army unit that was composed of all essential arms and services. The division possessed its own support and was capable of independent operations for a limited period. However, it generally fought as part of a higher unit, usually a corps. It could strike and penetrate efficiently, manoeuvre quickly and absorb reinforcements easily. The combat value of the infantry division derived from its ability to combine the action of the different arms and services to maintain combat over a considerable period of time. During sustained operations, the corps could provide services and additional supports.¹\n\nThe U.S. Army doctrine of 1941 determined that the first arm to seize terrain would be the infantry. It could seize and hold a main objective. However, no one arm wins battles,² victory results from the combined action of all arms. The other arms increased the offensive power of the infantry to seize hostile well-defended positions. Each arm developed a doctrine, which allowed it to support infantry actions. The infantry was capable of independent limited actions by using its own weapons.\n\nIts offensive power decreased appreciably when its freedom of manoeuvre was limited or when it was confronted by an organized defensive position. Under these conditions, or against a combined force, the limited firepower of infantry had to be reinforced by artillery support, tanks, ground attack aviation and other arms.³ In order to keep the light structure of the division, Army Ground Forces refused to assign a tank battalion to the organization of the infantry division. The U.S. Army constituted independent tank battalions (General Headquarters Tank Units) that were assigned to corps and armies. These could, depending upon the situation, attach tank battalions to infantry divisions, or concentrate them into a powerful armored fist. In Europe, a tank battalion, a tank destroyer battalion and an anti-aircraft artillery battalion were systematically attached to each infantry division.\n\nINFANTRY DIVISION GENERAL ORGANIZATION (Chart 1)\n\nDivision Headquarters (T/O&E 7-1, chapter 1)\n\nHeadquarters Company (T/O&E 7-2)\n\nReconnaissance Troop (T/O&E 2-27)\n\n3 Infantry Regiments (T/O&E 7-11, chapter 2)\n\n3 Infantry Battalions (T/O&E 7-15, chapter 3)\n\nDivision Artillery (T/O&E 6-10, chapter 5)\n\n3 Field Artillery Battalions, 105mm (T/O&E 6-25)\n\n1 Field Artillery Battalion, 155mm (T/O&E 6-35)\n\nEngineer Combat Battalion (T/O&E 5-15, chapter 6)\n\nSpecial Troops (T/O&E 7-3, chapter 7)\n\nSignal Company (T/O&E 11-7)\n\nOrdnance Company (T/O&E 9-8)\n\nQuartermaster Company (T/O&E 10-17)\n\nMilitary Police Platoon (T/O&E 19-7)\n\nDivision Band (T/O&E 20-107)\n\nMedical Battalion (T/O&E 8-15, chapter 8)\n\nThe infantry division involved three types of units: combat, combat support and combat service support. These were classified as follows:\n\nCombat units:\n\nCavalry Reconnaissance Troop\n\n3 Infantry Regiments\n\nCombat support units:\n\nDivisional Artillery units\n\nEngineer Combat Battalion.\n\nCombat service support units:\n\nSpecial Troops units\n\nMedical Battalion\n\nThe combat units achieved the mission of the division. The combat support units sustained combat units by their actions. The role of service support units was to make and to keep the division operational, and to provide for its needs during a determined period. We will study in detail the role of each unit of the division.\n\nThe infantry division was called a Triangular Division by reference to its organization. It included 3 infantry regiments. Each regiment included 3 infantry battalions and each battalion, 3 rifle companies. A rifle company contained 3 rifle platoons with 3 rifle squads in each. The doctrine anticipated a triangular use of the units, two in the attacking echelon and the third as the support echelon.\n\nField Manual 100-5, Field Service Regulations, Operations classified manoeuvres into two categories: envelopments and penetrations:⁴\n\nIn an envelopment, the main attack is directed against the flank or rear of the initial disposition of the enemy’s main forces and toward an objective in rear of his front lines. It seeks to surround that portion of the enemy’s forces in front of the objective. It is assisted usually by a secondary attack directed against the enemy’s front. The success depends largely on the degree of surprise attained and on the ability of the secondary attack to contain the bulk of the enemy’s forces. An envelopment avoids attacking on ground chosen by the enemy, and forces him to fight in two or more directions to meet the converging efforts of the attack.\n\nIn a penetration the main attack passes through some portion of the area occupied by the enemy’s main forces and is directed on an objective in his rear. It is characterized by the complete rupture of the enemy’s dispositions; the seizure of the objective by operations through the gap; and the envelopment of one or both flanks created by the breakthrough. The essential conditions for success are surprise, sufficient fire power, especially combat aviation and artillery, to neutralize the front of the penetration, favourable terrain within the hostile position for advance of the attacking troops, and strength to carry the attack through to its objective.\n\nWhen the situation does not favour an envelopment, the main attack is directed to penetrate the hostile front. A penetration can often be organized more rapidly than an envelopment. In the penetration of a defensive position, the main attack is launched on a front wider than that of the contemplated break-through in order to hold the enemy in place on the flanks of the penetration. The attack on the remainder of the hostile front is designed to contain the enemy and prevent him from moving his reserves.\n\nWhen orders were issued to a regiment to seize an objective, the regimental commander designated a main objective to which he committed a battalion, a secondary objective to which he committed the second battalion, whilst he kept the third in reserve. The reserve battalion served as the attacking regiment’s anti-aircraft protection. It also supported the attacking battalions by firing in the direction of the enemy. As a support, it could be committed to help a battalion in difficulty, to repel a hostile counter-attack or to exploit a breakthrough in hostile lines. When the regiment had to commit all its battalions, the protection of the regiment was assured by the engineer company (from the engineer combat battalion) attached to the regiment (if in a combat team). Engineers were trained to fight as infantrymen.\n\nAlthough the infantry division was not, when compared to the armored division, a combined arms unit, the U.S. Army foresaw in the former a tactical organization that permitted combined arms action as a means of securing success.⁵ This organization was the combat team (CT), officially designated a regimental combat team (RCT). The term ‘combat team’ was first assigned to this organization by the 5th Infantry Division in its Standing Operating Procedure (SOP)⁶ upon being notified in a report of 3 March 1940 about the SOP of the 2nd Division.⁷ The 2nd Division had tested the new triangular organization concept, and had used, in its SOP, the term ‘echelon’.\n\nA RCT consisted of the regiment with attachments from all combat support and service support units of the division:\n\nInfantry Regiment\n\nField Artillery Battalion (105mm)\n\nCompany, Engineer Battalion\n\nCompany, Medical Battalion\n\nand from units attached to the division:\n\nCompany, Tank Battalion\n\nCompany, Tank Destroyer Battalion\n\nBattery, Anti-aircraft Artillery Automatic Weapons Battalion\n\nFor a particular task, another force could be organized at regimental or divisional-level. This force was a combined arms team and was called a ‘task force’ (TF). The task force was a temporary grouping of units under one commander, formed for the purpose of carrying out a specific operation or mission. It could also be described as a semi-permanent organization of units under one commander for the purpose of carrying out a continuing specific task.⁸\n\nA RCT always had the same organization, and was under control of the regimental headquarters. A task force was organized for a defined task. It could have a battalion or a company as its main component. The task force was controlled by the commander of the main unit.\n\nChart 1 shows the organization of the infantry division according to the T/O&E 7, dated 15 July 1943. See Appendix II for a key to the symbols. T/O&E numbers are given for each unit; these appear under the headings of the respective unit throughout the book, e.g. see section 1.2, ‘Headquarters, Infantry Division (T/O&E 7-1)’. Alongside the symbol for each unit, numbers indicate the personnel, for example in the case of the infantry regiment: ‘O-151’, where ‘O’ represents officers and 151 gives number of officers; ‘WO-5’, represents 5 warrant officers; ‘3100’, represents the number of enlisted men. The number of personnel varied a lot from 1943 to 1945 and it is not possible to give all changes in this particular chart, although these can be found noted in the succeeding chapters. The actual organization of the infantry division as shown in chart 1 did not see a major change before June 1 1945, when the military police platoon became a company.\n\nBefore continuing this survey, important terms used by the U.S. Army should be explained, thus:⁹\n\nInfantry: branch of the army trained, equipped, and organized to fight on foot.\n\nMobile unit: a unit equipped with sufficient organic vehicles for the purpose of transporting all assigned personnel and equipment from one location to another at one time.\n\nMotorized unit: a unit equipped with complete motor transportation that enables all of its personnel, weapons, and equipment to be moved at the same time without assistance from other sources.\n\nMechanized unit: a unit that is transported by, and that fights from, armed and armored motor vehicles.\n\nThe infantry division included a mechanized unit, the cavalry reconnaissance troop, and motorized units, divisional artillery units. All other units of the division, particularly the 3 infantry regiments, did not have sufficient transportation, their means of displacement being by marching on foot. The infantry division could be motorized by the attachment of 6 quartermaster truck companies, T/O&E 10-57, assigned to the corps.\n\n1.2 HEADQUARTERS, INFANTRY DIVISION T/O&E 7-1\n\n2. Headquarters, Infantry Division\n\nChart 2 shows the division headquarters. Each section is numbered to allow the reader to refer to the relevant text below.\n\nDivision headquarters included the division commander, the staff officers and the necessary personnel to make and keep the division operational. In the division headquarters, the commander played the central role. He was to clearly establish and communicate his intentions. The commander had his vision of the battle, of the manner in which he considered it necessary to fight and how he planned to accomplish the mission. The duties of the commander were as follows:\n\ncommand the forces\n\nknow the situation\n\nassign the missions\n\nallow means\n\ntake decisions\n\ndirect and synchronize the forces\n\nsupport committed forces\n\nmotivate subordinates\n\nThe second in the chain of command was the assistant commander. He assumed command in the absence of the commander. Otherwise, he executed the tasks as directed by the commander.\n\nThe third was the chief of staff; he supervised and coordinated the actions of the general staff and liaison officers.\n\nThe commander was assisted by staff officers. These were classified into four categories: general staff officers, special staff officers, personal staff officers and liaison officers. Staff officers could not, either individually or in a group, exercise command. The command and the responsibility inherent to this function remained with the division commander and could not be delegated.¹⁰\n\nThe general staff was a group of officers who planned, coordinated and supervised. The members of the general staff were the chief of staff, who coordinated and supervised the entire headquarters, and four assistant chiefs of staff: personnel officer (G-1), intelligence officer (G-2), operations and training officer (G-3), supply officer (G-4), and their respective assistants.\n\nThe special staff covers all personnel who were included neither in the general staff nor in the personal staff, i.e. sections numbered from 9 to 21 in chart 2.\n\nThe personal staff was constituted by the aides of the commander.¹¹\n\nThe following now reviews in detail all sections of the headquarters, infantry division, using the same sequence of numbers as in chart 2.\n\n*1 – DIVISION COMMANDER AND AIDES\n\n1 Major General, Division Commander-P ¹²\n\n1 Captain, Aide-C\n\n1 1st Lt, Aide-C\n\n1 Techn 5th, Stenographer-C\n\n*2 – ASSISTANT TO DIVISION COMMANDER\n\n1 Brigadier General, Division Commander Assistant-P\n\n1 1st Lt, Aide-C\n\n1 2nd Lt, Aide-C\n\n1 Techn 5th, Stenographer-C\n\n*3 – LIAISON OFFICERS\n\n3 Captains, Liaison-C\n\nThe liaison officers were representatives of the commander.

The resultant grouping was designated the command post. For convenience of operations on campaign, the division headquarters was divided into a forward and a rear echelon. The forward echelon consisted of the staff sections immediately required by the commander to assist him in tactical operations. The rear echelon consisted of the remaining staff, those sections having administrative duties.\n\nThe command post was the location of the forward echelon of the headquarters. All signals communications centred on the command post. On the march, the post could move by bounds along a designated road, or it could move at a designated place in a column of march. In battle, the division command post was preferably installed next to a suitable landing field.¹⁸\n\nThe forward echelon (command post) consisted of:\n\nCommand:\n\nDivision Commander and Aides (*1)\n\nChief of Staff\n\nLiaison Officers (*3)\n\nOperations:\n\nCol, G-3 (*7)\n\nLt Col, G-2 (*6)\n\nLt Col, G-3 Assistant (*7)\n\nMajor, Air Ground Liaison (*4)\n\nS Sgt, Operations (*7)\n\nTech Sgt, Photo Interpreter (*4)\n\n2 Techns 4th, Stenographer (*4)\n\nDivision Engineer Assistant (*9)\n\nDivision Signal Assistant (*11)\n\nDivision Chemical (*14)\n\nPlans:\n\nMajor, Information and Education (*7)\n\nMr Sgt, Operations (*7)\n\nSgt, Operations (*7)\n\nTechn 4th, Draftsman (*7)\n\nTechn 4th, Stenographer (*7)\n\nTechn 4th, Orientation (*7)\n\nIntelligence:\n\nMajor, Intelligence, G-2 Assistant (*6)\n\nMr Sgt, Chief Clerk (*6)\n\nTechn 4th, Intelligence (*6)\n\nTechn 5th, Intelligence (*6)\n\nTechn 3rd, Photo Interpreter (*6)\n\nFire support:\n\nDivision Artillery Officer (*10)\n\nPersonnel from the Artillery Section (*10)\n\nCombat Service Support:\n\nLt Col, G-4 (*8)\n\nTechn 4th, Stenographer (*8)\n\nLt Col, G-1 (*5)\n\nTechn 4th, Stenographer (*5)\n\nThe rear echelon consisted of:\n\nCommand:\n\nAssistant Division Commander and Aides (*2)\n\nOperations:\n\nCaptain, Intelligence, G-2 Assistant (*6)\n\nDivision Chemical Assistant (*14)\n\nSgt, Operations (*7)\n\nTechn 4th, Stenographer (*7)\n\n2 Techns 4th, Draftsman (*7)\n\n2 Techns 4th, Orientation (*7)\n\nSpecial Staff Section:\n\nG-1 Section (*5)\n\nG-4 Section (*8)\n\nOrdnance Section (*12)\n\nQuartermaster Section (*13)\n\nAdjutant General Section (*15)\n\nInspector General Section (*16)\n\nFinance Section (*17)\n\nJudge Advocate Section (*18)\n\nSpecial Service Section (*19)\n\nChaplain Section (*20)\n\nMedical Section (*21)\n\nEquipment\n\nTo describe the entire equipment inventory of the T/O&E for each unit would become tedious.

The division headquarters company furnished transportation to the division headquarters. This is described in the following section.\n\n1.3 DIVISION, HEADQUARTERS COMPANY T/O&E 7-2\n\n3. Headquarters Company, Infantry Division\n\nThe headquarters company, infantry division is shown in chart 3. This type of unit, the headquarters company, will be encountered regularly in this book. All units larger than a company, i.e. battalion, squadron, group, regiment, brigade, division, corps, army, had a headquarters company. The headquarters companies, having a role less glorious than combat companies, are generally forgotten in most accounts. Nevertheless, their activities were very important in maintaining the operational status of the unit and for administrative duties. The headquarters company provided for the transportation, communications, services, and sometimes the protection of the headquarters.\n\nAs can be seen, the headquarters company furnished not only mess, administration, drivers and orderlies for staff officers, transportation and vehicle maintenance to the division headquarters, but anti-tank defense, too.\n\n*1 – COMPANY HEADQUARTERS (1 Officer, 15 Enlisted Men)\n\n1 Captain, Company Commander-C\n\n1 1st Sgt-C\n\n1 S Sgt, Supply-C\n\n1 Cpl, Co Clerk-C\n\n1 Techn 5th, Armorer – artificer, drove the ¾-ton truck, command-R\n\n1 Techn 5th, Clerk, Supply-C\n\n6 Pvts, Basic-C\n\n4 Pvts, Basic-R\n\nVehicles:\n\n1 Truck, ¾-ton, Command with winch, replaced by:\n\n2 Trucks, ¼-ton (13 January 1945)\n\nEquipment:\n\n1 luminous dial, compass (Off)\n\n2 wrist compasses, liquid-filled (1st Sgt, driver)\n\n1 transparent map template,"
