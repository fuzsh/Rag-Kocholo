        "text": "History of Armies\n\nThe Ancient World\n\nThe first historical evidence of army organization comes from the Middle Eastern Sumerian empire in Babylonia. Figurines from the 4th millennium bc show foot soldiers in copper helmets and heavy cloaks carrying short spears. The Sumerians used wooden chariots, but, with four solid wooden wheels, the chariots were probably too slow to ride into battle.\n\nThe army of the Babylonians (2nd millennium bc) included both lifetime soldiers drawn from the highest social class and citizens from the merchant class. The lifetime soldiers received grants of land for their service. They could pass the land on to their sons only if the sons, too, became soldiers. The conscripts may have been rewarded for their service with special trading or fishing privileges.\n\nThe Egyptians of the New Kingdom (about 1539–1075 bc) built up their army in two ways: by recruiting citizens and by enlisting foreign troops. Some of the foreign troops were enslaved people from conquered lands. In this way Egypt shifted to her subject lands the burden of supplying fighting troops. Other foreign fighters were mercenaries paid in land or plunder. The resulting settlements of Nubian, Libyan, and Greek mercenaries in Egypt became so powerful that it was difficult for later pharaohs, or kings, to rule them. From about 945 to 730 bc descendants of Libyan settlers ruled Egypt.\n\nThe army of Egypt’s New Kingdom was divided into infantry and chariot forces. Each light, two-wheeled chariot carried a driver and an archer. Foot soldiers fought with copper or bronze axes, daggers, scimitars (curved swords), and bows and arrows. In 1320 bc the standing army consisted of two divisions of 2,000 troops each. Each division had eight companies of 250 archers and spear fighters. Each company had five platoons of 50 soldiers. These soldiers wore helmets and either leather breastplates covered with metal scales or cloth tunics covered with crocodile skin.\n\nEgypt’s army was probably strongest under the warlike Pharaoh Ramses II (reigned 1279–13 bc). He commanded four Egyptian infantry divisions, bands of Nubian archers, and many other mercenaries—a total of 20,000 troops.\n\nFour centuries later an Assyrian king, Shalmaneser II, boasted that he could raise an army of 120,000 troops. The core of the Assyrian army was the king’s bodyguard, a group of highly trained professional soldiers. Every Assyrian landowner could also be drafted. Assyrian sculptures show the king riding to battle in a chariot surrounded by the Royal Guard. The richest soldiers could afford to have chariots, horses, and attendants. Chariots probably led the attack. The riders had to fire arrows while driving at a gallop.\n\nThe Assyrians had the first known cavalry, an army force on horseback. These soldiers wore coats of iron scales and leather breeches. They either thrust at the enemy with 9-foot (2.7-meter) spears or shot arrows. Most Assyrian soldiers fought on foot. The foot soldiers were divided into heavily armed troops with pointed helmets, coats of mail (linked metal armor), and metal or wicker shields and into lightly armed troops with helmets and wicker shields. Slingers hurled stones at the enemy with slingshots. Other groups carried 6-foot (1.8-meter) spears and straight swords made of bronze or iron. Baggage animals and herds of animals to feed the army followed behind the soldiers.\n\nWhile Assyria was a unified empire, Greece was made up of independent city-states, each with its own army. At first the armies were small and made up of free men. Enslaved people were not used as soldiers because defending the city was considered an honor. All free men served as border guards from age 18 to 20. During this time they learned how to use shields, spears, and swords and to fight in a formation called a phalanx.\n\nA phalanx consisted of eight or more lines of infantry, one behind the other, drawn up across a battlefield. The soldiers stood shoulder to shoulder, and each successive line followed the one in front of it closely. An individual soldier was called a hoplite, from the Greek word for heavy infantry. The lines moved forward at the same time, shocking the enemy with their heavy charge. As soldiers in the front line fell, those in the next line moved forward to replace them in combat. Fighting in this manner did not require much training, but Greek soldiers in Athens and most city-states did not remain in the army very long. After age 20 they fought only when called upon. The soldiers supported themselves and bought their own weapons and supplies. Command of the army did not belong to a king or to one powerful general. Instead, a group of high-ranking soldiers often commanded together. At the Battle of Marathon, in 490 bc, Athens had 10 generals who voted on strategy. Every day a different one of the 10 took charge.\n\nIn Sparta, the most militaristic Greek city-state, all free male citizens were full-time soldiers. They began training at age seven. At age 20 each one joined a company made up of 15 soldiers. Each member of the group had to help pay for food. The soldiers in the company ate, trained, and fought together. Even if they had families, the soldiers lived with their company in a military camp until age 30. Because the soldiers did no other kind of work, the state gave each one some land and enslaved people to support himself and his family. The Spartans had two kings, one of whom led the army.\n\nAs the Greek city-states expanded, they had to modify the way they fought. The phalanx was not very flexible. Once it started moving, it was hard to change its direction. An opponent with cavalry or lighter troops could outflank the phalanx and attack it on the sides. To protect their flanks the Greeks hired professional skirmishers or peltasts. The peltasts carried small round shields, swords, and javelins. They did not fight in formation but moved forward and back with the flow of battle. Gradually the Greek armies became paid professional forces.\n\nPhilip II, king of Macedonia, did a major army reorganization and created one of the most effective land-based fighting units in history. He changed the structure of the phalanx by making it 16 lines deep instead of 8. A single division of hoplites numbered 4,096—16 lines of 256 soldiers each. Preceding the hoplites into battle were four lines of 256 psiloi, or light infantry skirmishers. Behind the phalanx division were eight lines of 256 peltasts, also light infantry. Cavalry units covered the flanks. Including cavalry, a full division consisted of 8,192 troops. Attached to the army were a medical corps and a corps of engineers. This army was inherited by Philip’s son, Alexander the Great, and used to conquer a great portion of the Mediterranean world.\n\nIn the western Mediterranean, somewhat removed from the activities of Greece and Macedonia, two other military powers emerged: Carthage and Rome. Both began as city-states and both enlarged themselves into empires. Carthage in North Africa and Rome on the Italian peninsula were close enough to come into conflict over the control of the Mediterranean and adjacent lands. Between 264 and 146 bc they fought three wars that resulted in final victory for Rome.\n\nThe army of Carthage, based on the early Greek phalanx, was composed of mercenaries, yet it had the distinction of nearly annihilating the Roman army during the Second Punic War in 218–201 bc. The great Carthaginian general Hannibal was, like Napoleon 2,000 years later, a master strategist who had the ability to select the most favorable terrain for a battle. His successful tactic at the Battle of Cannae in 216 bc was to allow his light infantry to fall back before the Roman advance. The Carthaginian cavalry then moved out to the flanks to surround the numerically superior Roman army.\n\nThis victory was not followed up for several reasons. Hannibal lacked naval support, and his supply lines were long. In addition, he had inadequate recruitment policies to obtain more mercenaries. The war ended eventually in a Roman victory. In the Third Punic War, from 149 to 146 bc, Rome destroyed the city of Carthage and annexed the region as a Roman province.\n\nAncient Rome had highly successful armies. Between the 2nd century bc and the 1st century ad Rome expanded from a city-state to an empire controlling the whole Mediterranean basin. This achievement was the work of its legions.\n\nThe earliest Roman army formation was the phalanx, the formation used by the Greeks, Macedonians, and Carthaginians. For the Romans the phalanx proved to be too unwieldy a unit to fight on hilly and broken ground, and they soon began to change the nature of their battle formations. The result was the legion. Unlike the phalanx, the legion was not a static form; it varied greatly over the centuries.\n\nThe term legion did not originally mean any specific type of military formation. Its origin probably denoted those who were chosen for military service during the annual public assembly of citizens. As it developed the legion became a unit of from 4,000 to 6,000 heavy infantry supported by cavalry and light infantry. The term infantry simply means soldiers who fight on foot; the terms light and heavy refer to the kinds and weight of their weapons.\n\nThe advantage the legion had over the phalanx was flexibility and mobility. The legion did not have to move in a solid block of soldiers as did the phalanx. The legion was divided into maniples (groups of 120 soldiers), which were able to fight in a much more open and versatile battle array. They marched in lines instead of solid formation.\n\nOn the march, soldiers carried weapons, armor, cooking gear, and tools. Each day the army would stop and build a camp surrounded by a wall of logs and a deep ditch. Baggage animals, armorers, supply staff, engineers, and secretaries traveled with the army.\n\nFrom the earliest days of the Republic until the end of the 2nd century bc the armies of Rome were made up of citizens called up for duty each year. Every male citizen between the ages of 17 and 46 was liable for duty. In times of extreme emergency all male citizens could be called up, even the young and the aged. Each class of citizens had to furnish a specific number of companies made up of 100 soldiers. These units were called centuries, or hundreds, and they were commanded by officers called centurions. Even after the units of centuries were abandoned, the term centurion persisted as an officer designation.\n\nShortly before the end of the 2nd century bc, a number of changes were made in the Roman army system that were to change the very nature of Rome itself. Reliance on an annual call-up of citizens meant that Rome never had a permanent army. This practice was abandoned. The citizen army was replaced by a standing army made up of landless city dwellers and newly created citizens from outlying provinces. The allegiance of these new legions was to their commander rather than to the Roman state. The commander paid his soldiers in money or land supplied by the state.\n\nThe leader in this reform of Rome’s military system was the general Gaius Marius. He reformed the legion, substituting for the maniple a 600-man unit that was called the cohort. The soldiers swore an oath to him, binding them to service for a period of 10 years. This transformation from a temporary citizen army to a professional one made better training possible. It also meant that each Roman commander had his own private army, with legions that were faithful to him for their term of service.\n\nThis new army system paved the way for the destruction of the Roman Republic and the establishment of the empire. Army commanders not only went abroad making new conquests and fighting non-Romans but also vied with each other for political control of the Republic. During the 1st century bc Roman legions often fought each other under the leadership of such generals as Pompey, Julius Caesar, Mark Antony, and Octavian.\n\nIn the end it was Octavian, later called Augustus (the exalted one) or Augustus Caesar, who defeated all his opponents and instituted imperial rule at Rome. Once in power he revised the army system by cutting the number of legions from 60 to 28, requiring 20 years of service from the soldiers, and setting up a military treasury to pay the armies in the field and in retirement.\n\nUnder the empire the main task of the legions was not conquest but defense. The extensive borders of the empire in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa had to be continually held against domestic insurrection and foreign invasion. Most of the legions were deployed at the outposts of the empire. More and more the army’s might was derived from conquered peoples rather than Roman citizens.\n\nIn the 3rd and 4th centuries ad the army was again reorganized, first by the emperor Diocletian and later by Constantine. The number of soldiers in a legion was cut from 4,500 to 2,000 in order to gain mobility in fighting border wars. The total number of soldiers was raised to 500,000, and discipline was strengthened. Constantine reorganized the legions into border guards and organized a mobile field army for a reserve force.\n\nDuring the 5th and 6th centuries the western portion of the Roman Empire was overrun by invading Germanic tribes. The center of power shifted to the Eastern, or Byzantine, Empire, with its capital at Constantinople. The Byzantine Empire was able to defend itself with a small, professional army consisting of Germanic mercenaries and landless peasants who volunteered as lifetime soldiers.\n\nIn the 7th century the Byzantine Empire reformed the army. It recruited citizens. These men were granted tracts of land to support their families. Over the years the military families became powerful factions within the empire. The empire also brought the army under government control. The empire was divided into districts, and the viceroy of each district was made head of both the government and the army in his territory.\n\nThe emperor assumed the exclusive right to grant any military appointments. Prior to this time each general could reward his own soldiers with promotions, money, and plunder.\n\nThe Byzantine army combined infantry and cavalry. Heavy cavalry, called cataphracts, wore iron helmets, shirts of metal scales called hauberks, and iron shoes. Their chief weapon was the bow and arrow, but they also fought with lance and broadsword. They carried no shields because both hands had to be free to shoot arrows. The Byzantine forces had the best medical service that was available in their time. Bearers carried the wounded out of battle to physicians behind the lines.\n\nLittle noticed at the time, but of great consequence for the makeup of armies, were some inventions that had originated in Persia and other eastern areas during the time of the Roman Republic. The stirrup, saddle, and horseshoe were devised. Also a new breed of large warhorse was developed. It became possible to mount a cavalryman wearing heavy armor and carrying heavier weapons. These innovations changed the nature of warfare in Europe until after the Middle Ages. Heavy cavalry came to dominate armies to such an extent that the use of foot soldiers became at times negligible.\n\nThe Middle Ages\n\nThe first fighters to make extensive use of the new horsepower were the Germanic peoples who invaded and eventually overran the Roman Empire in the West—the Goths, Huns, Vandals, and others. The end of this portion of the empire in the 4th and 5th centuries inaugurated the 1,000-year period called the Middle Ages. During this era, from approximately 476 to 1500, armies were almost continually on the march somewhere. Muslims, Mongols, and European states vied with each other for the control of territory, for trade routes, and for wealth and power. They also sought to spread their respective religions.\n\nThe two most effective cavalry forces of the Middle Ages belonged to the Muslims and the Mongols. The Muslims, followers of the religion of Islam, expanded the influence of Islam under the Muslim states known as the Rashidun (Rightly Guided) and Umayyad caliphates in the 7th and 8th centuries. The Muslims fought both defensive and offensive battles. All able-bodied men were obliged to serve in the armies.\n\nThe main Muslim force was the cavalry. The soldiers wore helmets and mail and fought with swords, javelins, bows, daggers, and scimitars. The scimitar is a curved sword made of strong steel. Another vital weapon was the 6-foot- (1.8-meter-) long pointed lance.\n\nOnly after encountering European armies did the Muslims realize that a strong infantry force such as the phalanx or legion was useful in war. For their foot soldiers they hired mercenaries, reserving the privilege of membership in the cavalry for Muslims.\n\nWithin 100 years after the death of Muhammad, the founder of Islam, in 632, Muslim armies had conquered the Middle East, North Africa, and Spain. The threat that they posed to Europe was finally stopped in 732 at the Battle of Tours in France. There Charles Martel and his Frankish army defeated the Muslim invaders.\n\nOne of the best-trained and most disciplined armies was that of the Mongols, who swept across Asia and into Europe in the 13th century. Led by Genghis Khan, this army was virtually all cavalry, and the quality of their horsemanship was unmatched by any other army.\n\nA Mongol force usually numbered 30,000 soldiers in three tomans, or groups of 10,000. Each toman was divided into 10 regiments of 1,000 soldiers; each regiment into 10 squadrons of 100; and each squadron into 10 groups of 10 soldiers each. Under leaders such as Genghis Khan and his general, Subotai, entire columns could travel great distances separately and reach the same battleground in time to fight.\n\nPart of the Mongols’s success was due to the hardiness of the troops. They needed no supply train. The soldiers could travel multiple days while eating only a dried milk paste and drinking blood taken from the extra horses. The Mongols fought in a battle line five soldiers deep. The first two lines, with helmets, leather breastplates, and small shields, attacked with lances and sabers. They used iron hooks to pull their opponents off their horses. The three back lines threw javelins and shot arrows; they wore no armor. Mongol commanders directed their soldiers with black and white signal flags. Mongol armies conquered a vast empire stretching from China across Russia to the Middle East and Hungary.\n\nAt the same period in western Europe mounted knights in armor were the main fighters. For most of the Middle Ages there were no standing armies in Europe. Military service was linked to owning land. Only big landowners could afford horses, armor, and weapons for themselves and their supporters, called men-at-arms. In a system known as feudalism, small landowners became vassals (servants or tenants) of the more powerful. A vassal swore to fight and work for his lord in return for protection. The wealthiest landowners attracted many vassals and became more and more powerful. Even the wealthiest lords were vassals to a king, but it was difficult for a king to rule these powerful men.\n\nA fully armed medieval knight wore a cylindrical helmet and a suit of mail. He carried a shield and fought with sword and lance. His horse had to be large enough to bear the weight of the armor and the shock of a lance thrust. Many young nobles practiced horsemanship and the use of weapons from their youth.\n\nFoot soldiers played no significant role during the Middle Ages. For one thing they could not wear armor as heavy as that of mounted warriors and so did not stand much chance against a charge by knights. Nor was much time spent drilling knights and foot soldiers in fighting together. In battle foot soldiers were often trampled by the knights on their own side.\n\nVassals swore to fight for their lords 40 days every year. If a campaign lasted longer, many vassals simply went home. Medieval armies were cumbersome and poorly organized. Command was fragmented because vassals were loyal to their own lord first.\n\nWith the rise of strong kings and the development of new weapons, such as the longbow—a wooden bow from 5 to 6 feet (1.5 to 1.8 meters) long—the medieval army was gradually replaced by more disciplined forces. Kings allowed their vassals to contribute money instead of providing soldiers. A king could then use the money to hire armies of mercenaries.\n\nAs the Middle Ages were drawing to a close in the 14th and 15th centuries, the supremacy of the foot soldier began to reassert itself. This development was in part the result of improved weaponry that enabled infantry units to defeat cavalry.\n\nIn England infantry used the longbow, which could shoot a 3-foot- (about 1-meter-) long arrow with great accuracy up to 600 feet (180 meters). Trained English archers could fire six arrows a minute that could pierce a knight’s armor. With the longbow an English army defeated a vastly larger French army at Crécy, France, in 1346, during the Hundred Years’ War. The longbows drove back the slower-firing French soldiers with crossbows, then shot down the knights’ horses. Once the horses fell, it was a simple matter for the English to stab or club the clumsy armored knights. Once the enemy line was broken, the English cavalry charged.\n\nMore important even than the longbow in the revival of infantry warfare was the renewed use of the Greek phalanx in modified forms. It was the Swiss who rediscovered the phalanx. Unable, as a citizen army, to afford horses and armor, they contrived, through constant drill and good discipline, to learn how to maneuver and coordinate a mass of soldiers in such a way as to defeat cavalry. The weapon that made this tactic feasible was the 19-foot (5.8-meter) pike, carried by the first four ranks of the phalanx. While the soldiers with pikes speared charging horses, the troops behind them ran forward to attack the unhorsed knights.\n\nThe Swiss used three phalanxes, one behind the other. This prevented an enemy from outflanking the front lines. It also allowed the front phalanx to fall back into the one behind it for added strength. If surrounded, the Swiss formed a hedgehog, a hollow square with pikes pointing out on every side.\n\nInnovations in weaponry during the late Middle Ages were to change the nature of warfare permanently. Firearms appeared in the late 14th century, and cannon were introduced in the 15th century. These weapons gradually made the pike, crossbow, longbow, and sword obsolete. New tactics also promoted the infantry over the cavalry as a fighting force. Horses made better targets than soldiers, and once the horse riders were dismounted they had no advantage over the infantry.\n\nBetween 1300 and 1648 the feudal system of Europe declined. The many social transformations that occurred significantly altered the makeup of armies. The breakdown of the vassal-master relationships forced kings, nobles, and city-state leaders to find other ways of raising armies. England turned to the citizen-soldier concept, but other countries in Europe used mercenaries.\n\nIn England the practice of hiring foreign mercenaries was stopped by the Magna Carta of 1215. The nobles imposed this document, which limited the powers of the monarchy, on King John. The feudal system of calling up vassals proved unsatisfactory, for it often resulted in an untrained, undisciplined assemblage whose main thought was to get military service over with and go back to family and work. The outcome was that paid military service became the right and duty of all adult male citizens. To fill out the army specific numbers of males were drafted from each county for service in wartime.\n\nIn other European countries the decline of feudalism led kings and nobles alike to hire mercenaries. Even the city-states found it to their advantage to hire armies to fight their wars for them. The advantage of mercenaries over vassals was great: mercenaries were professional soldiers who devoted their whole lives to combat. This, in turn, led to war becoming a more professional and calculated affair on the part of kings and princes.\n\nGroups of professional mercenaries banded together in what were called “free companies” to hire themselves out as units. The two most outstanding types of free companies were the condottieri of Italy and the Swiss mercenaries. The condottieri contracted for the services of units of mercenaries and then hired out units to princes for their wars. From the 13th through the 15th century the condottieri and their troops monopolized warfare on the Italian peninsula. Their chief advantage was their professionalism; their main disadvantage was their lack of loyalty to a cause. Since they fought for money, they were frequently willing to change sides for higher pay.\n\nThe Swiss provided the best mercenary units in Europe. Their use of the phalanx and soldiers armed with pikes made them champion fighters. All the rulers in Europe wanted Swiss mercenaries in their armies. These Swiss Guards, as they were also called, saw action in many wars from the 15th through the 19th century. In the 21st century the only remaining vestige of the guards was the personal bodyguard of the pope in Vatican City. The Vatican Swiss Guard has been in existence since 1505.\n\nIn Germany soldiers called landsknechts, who were also mercenaries, imitated the Swiss phalanx. After a time they became capable fighters.\n\nSpain was the one state of Europe that did not use free-company fighters. The Spanish armies, among the most powerful of the early modern period, consisted largely of mercenaries from Germany, the Netherlands, and Italy. These mercenaries were led by well-trained Spanish officers who infused them with a spirit of loyalty to Spain and its monarchs.\n\nDevelopment of Standing Armies\n\nThe end of the Middle Ages is generally dated about 1500, but militarily it did not end until the time of the Thirty Years’ War, fought from 1618 to 1648. By this time several strong nation-states had developed in Europe, among them France, Sweden, Spain, and the Holy Roman Empire consisting of the German states, Austria, and northern Italy. These monarchies had the ability to raise large armies and the money to support them. The emergence of the national standing army consisting of citizen soldiers brought about the gradual decline in the use of mercenaries and free companies, although the tradition of the mercenary persisted on a limited scale into the 21st century.\n\nGustavus Adolphus (1594–1632), king of Sweden, has been called the father of modern warfare. He forged the first national standing army, one that was to be a model for other states for 150 years. All Swedish males 15 years of age and older were drafted for military service. The forces he raised by conscription were augmented by mercenaries.\n\nGustavus organized the army into companies of 150 soldiers. There were four companies in a battalion and three battalions in a brigade. To fight a battle he arranged his infantry into regiments, each containing as many as 10 companies, with the cavalry in front. The cavalry led the charge, while the infantry came forward behind them, stopping to fire and reload. The front row of the infantry fired from a kneeling position. At the same time the next row leaned over the front row and fired, while the third row fired standing. This became known as the Swedish salvo. Prior to starting a battle the artillery bombarded the enemy. Gustavus devised this coordination of artillery, cavalry, and infantry, and soon other European armies adopted the method.\n\nTo increase the mobility of his armies, Gustavus made improvements in weaponry. His soldiers used lighter muskets that could be loaded faster than previous models. Early muskets took two soldiers to load and fire. The newer muskets were shorter and lighter. The powder charge was measured ahead of time and packed with the ball in a paper cartridge. The soldier simply had to bite off the end of the cartridge and ram the shot down the muzzle. Gustavus made similar improvements in his artillery. Heavy cannon were replaced with lighter ones that one horse could pull. Cannon shot was measured ahead of time. Supplies of powder, cannon balls, and musket shot were stored in depots all over the country so that the army did not have to carry excessive loads of ammunition.\n\nDuring the Thirty Years’ War Gustavus taxed conquered districts to pay his soldiers. His armies were supplied with uniforms, weapons, food, and housing. His enemies, the armies of the Holy Roman Empire, had to find their own food and shelter in the lands through which they marched. Therefore, they lived by plunder and made enemies of local populations.\n\nThe first military leader to imitate the work of Gustavus was Oliver Cromwell, during the English Civil Wars in the middle of the 17th century. His army was patterned after the Swedish army, and his major innovation was the introduction of basic training for his troops.\n\nAfter Gustavus the next outstanding military genius of Europe was Frederick the Great, king of Prussia. He came to the throne in 1740 and ruled for 46 years. The first 23 years of his reign were spent in making Prussia a great military power and in fighting two major wars: the beginning of the War of the Austrian Succession (1740–45) and the Seven Years’ War (1756–63). Both of these wars were against Austria. Frederick’s goal was the annexation of Silesia, a Polish province that had come under Austrian control in the 16th century. His greatest military strengths lay in enforcing strong discipline and in devising tactics. Frederick’s father, Frederick William I, had raised the strength of the Prussian army to 80,000. Frederick increased the number to 140,000 and then to 180,000. All young men of the lower classes could be drafted. Sons of the middle classes did not have to serve. Officers came from the class of nobles and wealthy landowners, known as Junkers.\n\nThe Prussian army consisted of infantry, cavalry, and artillery. The foot soldiers carried muskets with bayonets. By constant drilling they learned to load and fire their muskets five times a minute, while other armies could do so only twice a minute. This did not give the soldiers much time to aim, but careful aim did not matter, since the muskets were not accurate at more than 150 feet (45 meters). Targets were not individual soldiers, but the mass of the enemy line.\n\nThe Prussian army formed a line three soldiers deep. The line advanced until it was about 300 feet (90 meters) from the enemy. The soldiers delivered a succession of volleys and then paced forward, reloading as they moved. When they came close to the enemy line, they charged with their bayonets.\n\nOn the flanks of the infantry rode the heavy cavalry in close formation. Its charges were carefully coordinated with the advance of the infantry to take advantage of any weakness in the enemy lines.\n\nIn his drill formations Frederick inaugurated the tactic of wheeling his line to change direction, thus enabling it to face an attack from a different direction. He also adopted the practice of arranging his line in echelon formation. This meant that a line would not be straight as it advanced, but each soldier, beginning with the second in line, would be at least one step behind the next. It would give the appearance of a diagonal line marching across a battlefield. The advantage of the echelon formation was that it exposed only one flank of his army.\n\nThe armies of Europe and the United States adopted the methods that Frederick the Great had instituted in Prussia. In fact, most armies used his drill formations and tactics through World War I. Modern mechanized warfare with airpower, tanks, and missiles, however, made his methods much less useful.\n\nThe French Revolution and Napoleon\n\nEvents in France between the French Revolution of 1789 and the defeat of Napoleon I at Waterloo in 1815 were of great political significance. The Revolution began as a class war. Within a few years the monarchy had been destroyed and class distinctions had been erased. Each person became a citizen of the reconstructed country.\n\nThe importance of what had happened in France was not lost upon the other monarchies of Europe. They saw this social upheaval as a threat to their existence. The French were in part responsible because they wanted to spread their revolution to the rest of Europe. In response, Prussia and Austria formed a coalition to defeat the revolution and restore the monarchy.\n\nWith the monarchy gone, the immediate reaction of the French was to identify defense of the revolution with defense of the country. For the first time in history, all the loyalties and aspirations of a people were bound up with the fate of their country. Modern patriotism was born: a country would go to arms to defend itself. A new relationship had been forged between a state and its army, a relationship that played a vital role in most countries from the 19th century onward.\n\nFrance’s call to arms in 1793 brought forth more than one million men, the first army of such size in modern times. The revolutionary government decreed that every citizen—young or old, man or woman—was to work for victory against the Austrian-Prussian coalition by making ammunition, providing and moving supplies, and nursing the wounded. War was no longer left to the professionals; the day of the citizen soldier had arrived. To raise its armies the French used conscription, a practice that soon spread to the rest of Europe.\n\nNapoleon was the general who welded the French armies into a combat force that defeated the other armies of Europe for 20 years, from 1795 to 1815. His division contained infantry, artillery, and cavalry. He assembled two or three divisions into a corps to make larger units for battle.\n\nNapoleon had two main strategies: he sought out terrain most favorable to his armies to fight on, and he used artillery and masses of soldiers to breach the enemy’s weakest point and disrupt its battle plans. His methods were normally direct and simple: use a fast-moving army to breach the enemy lines and then outmaneuver and outflank them. Napoleon was finally defeated at Waterloo, Belgium, because the armies of the Prussians and the English had learned to use some of his own tactics and employed them against him.\n\nThe 19th Century\n\nIn the history of armies the 19th century covers the period from Napoleon’s defeat at Waterloo in 1815 to the start of World War I in 1914. The two features that stand out in this period are the great strides in technology and invention and the major organizational changes made in armies.\n\nThe Industrial Revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries brought with it improvements in manufacturing, such as the assembly line and interchangeable parts. This meant that weapons would be made more rapidly, and they could be standardized. The use of steel instead of cast iron or bronze meant that rifles, revolvers, and cannon were of better quality and more durable.\n\nIn addition to weaponry, there were a number of other inventions and new processes that had an impact on the way armies fought. The canning and refrigerating of food made feeding armies easier. The invention of the steamship, railroad, telegraph, telephone, light bulb, automobile, airplane, and tank changed warfare markedly between 1815 and the end of World War I by improving transportation, communication, and combat effectiveness.\n\nIn terms of organization few changes were made in European armies and none in the U.S. Army in the first half of the 19th century. The unification of Germany under Otto von Bismarck in the 1860s made a complete change in the military situation, however. In the next few decades Europe became an armed camp. Every country of any size instituted conscription and greatly increased the size of its army. Large reserve forces were also built up. Germany, for instance, increased the size of its army from 400,000 to 850,000 and kept a reserve of more than 4,000,000 in the period immediately before World War I. France, Austria, and Russia followed a similar course. The exception was Britain, essentially a naval power until World War I made conscription necessary.\n\nWhile the countries of Europe were arming themselves and reorganizing their land forces, a war was being fought across the Atlantic. The American Civil War (also called the War Between the States), fought from 1861 to 1865, has been called the first modern war. It was a gigantic struggle in which more than 750,000 soldiers are thought to have died, and hundreds of thousands were wounded. The theater of war was 1,500 miles (2,415 kilometers) wide from east to west and 800 miles (1,290 kilometers) from north to south. It was the first war in which railroads, telegraph, ironclad ships, torpedoes, and modern breech-loading rifles were used. It was a war in which the industrial might of one side, the North, was able to wear down and defeat a largely agricultural economy, the South.\n\nThe number of soldiers who fought in the war was huge. Historians estimate that there were about 1,556,000 in the Union armies of the North and about 800,000 in the Southern Confederacy over the course of the war. Most of these troops were volunteers, along with a few thousand professional soldiers from the regular army. As the war dragged on, the two governments had to rely on conscription to replace the killed and wounded soldiers. The commanders on both sides were officers trained at the military academy of West Point. Infantry regiments numbered 1,000 men, and cavalry units were about the same size. Artillery batteries were small in size at the start of the war—usually about six guns—but by the end of the war they had been organized into brigades of five batteries to increase concentration of firepower at key points on the large fronts in most battles.\n\nTwo aspects of Civil War battles are notable because they were to become standard procedures in World War I: entrenchment and advance. For the first time in warfare the construction of hasty field fortifications and trenches before battle became customary. When a battle began, the cavalry and infantry of both sides charged forward.\n\nThe infantry, as the war dragged on, adopted the tactic of advance by rush. In this method half the soldiers would fire at the enemy while standing still, and the other half ran ahead. Then that half would stop and fire, while the others in turn rushed the enemy. Cavalry soldiers of the North usually dismounted to fight, while those of the South remained on horseback.\n\nThe size and complexity of the Civil War made it necessary for both the Union and the Confederacy to increase the size of their staff systems. Neither side had a staff like the general staffs of the countries of Europe. In the course of the war there were advances in military engineering because of the need for building bridges, fortifications, and entrenchments.\n\nOther wars were fought between 1815 and 1914, including the Crimean War (1853–56), the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71), the South African War (1899–1902), the Russo-Japanese War (1904–05), and the Balkan Wars (1912–13). None was of the magnitude of the American Civil War. Yet the military establishments of Europe and Japan considered the American Civil War to be a conflict between amateur armies and therefore tended to ignore its tactics.\n\nWorld Wars of the 20th Century\n\nThe failure of the Europeans to learn from the American Civil War led them to fight the same kind of war in World War I as they always had fought. The armies of Europe, and finally, of the United States, fought for four years, only to end in a stalemate. Nothing was settled despite massive loss of life.\n\nSome of the tactics employed in World War I were much the same as those used in the American Civil War. For example, World War I soldiers, like Confederate and Union soldiers before them, built fortifications and dug trenches before charging the enemy with rifle fire. They fell back to the trenches if no gain was made.\n\nThe armies of World War I were the largest put into the field up to that time. The Germans were able to mobilize almost 2,000,000 troops in two days, and within five days about 1,000,000 soldiers were on the march toward France. Austria-Hungary mobilized 450,000 troops, while France started out with 1,290,000. Russia called up an army of 1,400,000. Great Britain, with the only all-volunteer army in Europe, had only 120,000 at the start of the war.\n\nBy 1917 the British Army had increased tenfold, and the French land forces had been enlarged to 2,600,000. In 1918 the U.S. Army in France numbered 1,200,000. It was the addition of troops from the United States that made it possible to defeat German forces numbering about 2,500,000.\n\nArmy organization for all the belligerents remained the same as it had been throughout the 19th century. They all had similar infantry and cavalry divisions, artillery brigades, engineering companies, supply units, and medical units.\n\nThe advances in technology that had been made since the American Civil War were not sufficient to tip the balance either way. Both sides made use of airplanes, tanks, radio, machine guns, and other inventions. The newness of these technologies meant that they had to be adapted to wartime use on a trial-and-error basis. Many inventions were developed for commercial use, such as the telephone, radio, and internal-combustion engine, and were only gradually adapted for use in warfare. It was not until World War II that full advantage was taken of the technologies of mechanized warfare.\n\nThe interwar period, from 1918 to 1939, was marked by a feeling of revulsion to all war on the part of most countries. The armies of the Allies—France, Britain, and the United States—were all drastically reduced in size. Only Germany differed in these matters. Convinced that their country had been betrayed by its politicians in World War I, the Germans continued to prepare secretly for another conflict. Russia, allied with France against Germany, had been knocked out of the conflict by the Russian Revolution of 1917 and a hastily arranged treaty with the new communist government.\n\nA grave mistake made by the former Allies between 1919 and 1939 was the failure of the military to keep up with industrial development and new technologies. The one change that was made was the addition of air force auxiliaries to the several armies.\n\nWhile Germany was secretly modifying its industries for rapid changeover to wartime production, the other countries were convinced a war could not occur again. When war did come in 1939, the Allies had to make rapid changes in their industrial capacity to meet the German challenge. They also were forced to use conscription.\n\nCivil war in Spain from 1936 to 1939 provided a small-scale dress rehearsal for World War II. Volunteers from other countries went to Spain to fight. Soldiers on leave from Germany and Italy went to fight on the side of Nationalist leader Francisco Franco. Americans, Canadians, British, and others went to fight for the Spanish democratic republic. Italy and Germany, both dictatorships and both preparing for war, had a chance to try out their new airplanes and tanks as well as other weapons. Tanks were used for frontal attack and airplanes for the strafing of infantry and for bombing missions.\n\nDuring the early decades of the 20th century a great military power emerged in East Asia. Japan had for some decades been mobilizing all its industrial and human resources to increase the strength of its armed forces. By 1941, when Japan entered World War II, it had built up an army of about 55 infantry divisions and 35 tank regiments. Its army air force had about 1,600 combat planes.\n\nWorld War II, fought from 1939 to 1945, had several characteristics that distinguished it from World War I. A major difference was the coordination of all services—armies, air forces, and navies—in one common effort. World War II commanders used amphibious (combined land-sea operations) warfare and coordinated tanks and airplanes in initial attacks (a tactic the Germans called blitzkrieg, meaning “lightning warfare”). In addition, World War II military tactics included the use of radio communications, both in the air and on the ground. World War II was the first fully mechanized war. The cavalry, which had been part of armies for hundreds of years, was finally obsolete. The term cavalry, however, continued to be used to describe mechanized units.\n\nMore combatants were mobilized for World War II than at any previous time. For the major belligerents the total number of soldiers in all services was estimated as: Australia, 1,000,000; Canada, 1,159,000; China, 17,250,500; France, 5,900,000; Germany, 20,000,000; Great Britain, 5,896,000; Italy, 3,100,000; Japan, 9,700,000; the Soviet Union (army only), 12,000,000; the United States, 16,000,000; and Yugoslavia, 3,741,000.\n\nThe organization of armies changed very little from the prewar period. Divisions numbered from 11,000 to 15,000 soldiers, depending on national policy. Airborne divisions numbered from 6,000 to 10,000. The major change was in the number of backup and support troops, such as engineers, signal troops, supply troops, mechanics, communications experts, and medical personnel. For the first time women served in uniform in fairly large numbers. They did administrative and communications work and performed many other support functions.\n\nThe command structures of the armies remained as they had been before the war, but there were two innovations in the scope of command. For the first time joint and combined commands were used. Joint commands meant placing all the armed services of a country—army, navy, and air force—under a single command in a theater of operations. Combined command involved two or more countries. For example, General Dwight D. Eisenhower of the United States was supreme commander of all Allied forces operating in Europe.\n\nArmies in the Nuclear Age\n\nWorld War II was brought to an end by the dropping of atomic bombs on two Japanese cities in the summer of 1945. With the dawn of the atomic, or nuclear, age, military personnel and civilians alike at first believed that the nature of warfare had been changed forever. This did not prove to be the case. All the major countries of the world have maintained standing armies, and conventional weapons—albeit highly sophisticated—are still used. Many more or less conventional wars have been fought since 1945, including conflicts in Vietnam, Korea, and the Middle East, including the Arab-Israeli wars, the Iran-Iraq War, the Persian Gulf War, and the Iraq War.\n\nOne major factor armies have had to deal with since World War II is guerrilla warfare. The term guerrilla means “little war.” It is a type of warfare characterized by fighting limited actions, often on terrain difficult for a regular army to dominate. Guerrillas use hit-and-run tactics, sabotage, terrorism, and propaganda. They are highly mobile, use unorthodox methods, obtain weapons from any available source, and normally live off the country without regular supply lines. Most of the wars and revolutions since 1945 have involved guerrilla warfare. Particularly notable were the Vietnam War (1954–75), the Cuban Revolution of 1959, the Afghan War (1978–92), and the Iraq War (2003–11).\n\nThe United States Army\n\nAs the commander in chief of the armed forces, the president of the United States maintains civilian control over the army. The Department of the Army is a branch of the cabinet-level Department of Defense, which is headed by a civilian secretary who is appointed by the president. The secretary of the army, also a civilian appointed by the president, is under the authority of the secretary of defense and of the president.\n\nCivilian control of the army is also maintained by the United States Congress through its reviews of army programs and its appropriations. Each house of Congress has an Armed Services Committee.\n\nThe top military officer of the army is the army chief of staff, a four- or five-star general appointed by the president. Along with the heads of the air force, navy, marine corps, space force, and national guard, the army chief of staff is a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The Joint Chiefs serve as the principal military advisers to the president, the secretary of defense, and the National Security Council (the agency that deals with domestic, foreign, and military policies related to national security).\n\nThe army general staff consists of a comptroller and of offices of operations and plans; personnel; logistics; research, development, and acquisition; intelligence; and automation and communications. Special staff agencies include the offices of the adjutant general, chief of engineers, surgeon general, chief of chaplains, and judge advocate general. The chiefs of the army reserve forces and of the national guard are also members of the Special Staff.\n\nPersonnel Structure\n\nAll army personnel are ranked according to level. In the U.S. Army the ranks range from the lowest level—privates—to the highest level—generals. Above privates there are three levels of officers: noncommissioned officers, warrant officers, and commissioned officers. The differences between noncommissioned officers and commissioned officers are in training and authority. Commissioned officers are graduates of military academies or of officer training schools.\n\nNoncommissioned officers include corporals and sergeants. There are several ranks of sergeants including staff sergeant, master sergeant, and command sergeant major. The duties of these officers vary considerably. Some are in combat command positions, others are in backup units, such as maintenance, transportation, or communications. Noncommissioned officers are promoted from within the body of enlisted personnel.\n\nWarrant officers are neither commissioned nor noncommissioned officers, but in rank they are between the two. In the modern army warrant officers are highly trained technical experts who usually operate in one area of specialization throughout their whole military career. Most helicopter pilots, for instance, are warrant officers. They may also operate in an advisory or administrative position, but they do not command troops. Although they remain warrant officers, their pay may rise to that of some commissioned officers.\n\nThe levels of commissioned officers are company grade officers, field grade officers, and general officers. Company grade officers, also called line grade or junior officers, include second lieutenants, first lieutenants (or, simply, lieutenants), and captains. The highest rank, the captain, is usually in command of a company, a unit of up to 200 soldiers. A first lieutenant commands a platoon, a unit of up to 36 soldiers. After training, officers enter service at the lowest rank of second lieutenant. A second lieutenant may command a platoon before being promoted to first lieutenant.\n\nField grade officers, also called senior officers, are majors, lieutenant colonels, and colonels. Colonels command brigades, units of 3,000 to 5,000 soldiers. Lieutenant colonels command battalions, units of up to about 1,000 soldiers. They are assisted by majors.\n\nGeneral officers are the highest ranking officers in the U.S. Army. The ranks are brigadier general, major general, lieutenant general, and general. The United States has conferred the title of general of the army on a few generals of notable achievement such as George C. Marshall, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Douglas MacArthur, Omar Bradley, and Henry H. Arnold. This title is the equivalent of the European field marshal. In addition, the United States has designated two men as general of the armies, a largely ceremonial position. John J. Pershing received the title in 1919 for his leadership during World War I. George Washington received the title in 1976 to honor him during the United States Bicentennial. In terms of rank major generals are in charge of divisions (10,000 to 15,000 soldiers), and lieutenant generals command an army corps (20,000 to 45,000 soldiers). Generals command a field army (90,000 or more soldiers).\n\nOrganization\n\nThe active U.S. Army, which is made up of officers and enlisted personnel who are on active duty, is one of the three parts of the total army. The other two are the U.S. Army Reserve and the U.S. Army National Guard.\n\nThe U.S. Army Reserve is made up of civilians, many of whom also hold full-time jobs. The army reserve is divided into three categories: the ready reserve, the standby reserve, and the retired reserve. Ready reserve forces undergo consistent training and are available for immediate mobilization. Standby reserve forces are considered neither ready nor retired and are allowed to skip some training exercises. However, they can be called to active duty during emergencies.\n\nAlthough the army reserve has several designated combat units, most of its units provide the active army with combat support during national emergencies. The army reserve also assumes important training responsibilities in times of crisis.\n\nThe U.S. Army National Guard is the oldest military force in the United States. It traces its origins to the trained bands in the Massachusetts Bay Colony that date from 1636. There are army national guard units in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Most army national guard members are assigned to combat units.\n\nThe army national guard is both a federal and a state military force. The governors of the states command the army national guard during peacetime. Units of the army national guard often assist state or local officials in dealing with natural disasters and civil disorders. On the order of the president the army national guard can be called to federal duty and its units made part of the active army. The army national guard often works in conjunction with the air national guard—a branch of the U.S. Air Force—and together the two groups form the U.S. National Guard.\n\nCommand Structure\n\nThe U.S. Army’s responsibilities are divided among 4 Army Commands, 9 Army Service Component Commands, and 12 Direct Reporting Units. All are organized under the headquarters of the Department of the Army.\n\nArmy Commands\n\nThe United States Army Forces Command trains and deploys active army and army reserve troops. Headquartered at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, the command is also in charge of the training of units of the army national guard. Other responsibilities include the development of plans for mobilization.\n\nThe United States Army Training and Doctrine Command recruits soldiers and directs combat training programs. It is headquartered at Fort Eustis, Virginia.\n\nThe United States Army Materiel Command is in charge of the equipment that the army uses. Its responsibilities include development, procurement, storage, delivery, and maintenance. It is headquartered at Redstone Arsenal, Alabama.\n\nThe United States Army Futures Command concentrates on preparing the army for the future, especially through research in artificial intelligence, combat technology, and medical development. It is headquartered at Austin, Texas.\n\nArmy Service Component Commands\n\nService component commands support joint and multinational task forces under the Unified Commands of the Department of Defense. Five of these commands are geographic, while the other four are functional, or task specific.\n\nUnited States Army Central is in charge of areas in northeast Africa, the Middle East, and Central and South Asia. It is headquartered at Shaw Air Force Base, South Carolina.\n\nUnited States Army North concentrates on North America and includes training and equipping personnel to defend the United States. It is headquartered at Fort Sam Houston, Texas.\n\nUnited States Army South covers Central America, South America, and the Caribbean. It is headquartered at Fort Sam Houston.\n\nUnited States Army Europe and Africa oversees strategic and operational objectives in Europe and Africa. It is headquartered at Wiesbaden, Germany.\n\nUnited States Army Pacific provides assistance in the Indo-Pacific region, which stretches from the western coast of the United States to the eastern coast of Africa and from the Arctic to the Antarctic. It is headquartered at Fort Shafter, Hawaii.\n\nThe United States Army Special Operations Command trains, equips, and organizes forces for special operations in all regions of the world. It is headquartered at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.\n\nThe Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command plans and delivers transportation equipment and supplies to task forces. It is headquartered at Scott Air Force Base, Illinois.\n\nThe United States Army Space and Missile Defense Command involves training and using forces in space and high-altitude missions and for missile defense. It is headquartered in Huntsville, Alabama.\n\nThe United States Army Cyber Command deals with operations in cyberspace and with electronic warfare to ensure the safety and supremacy of U.S. and allied forces. It is headquartered at Fort Gordon, Georgia.\n\nDirect Reporting Units\n\nThe United States Army Medical Command provides health services for army personnel and supervises medical training and education. It is headquartered at Fort Sam Houston, Texas.\n\nThe United States Army Intelligence and Security Command performs intelligence and security functions above the corps level. It is headquartered at Fort Belvoir, Virginia.\n\nThe United States Army Criminal Investigation Command is responsible for all criminal investigations that are conducted by the army, including those overseas. It operates a criminal intelligence element. It is headquartered at Quantico, Virginia.\n\nThe United States Army Human Resources Command manages army personnel distribution and programs to ensure the readiness of its forces. It is headquartered at Fort Knox, Kentucky.\n\nThe United States Army Corps of Engineers is responsible for both military engineering projects and civil works programs. It is headquartered at Washington, D.C.\n\nThe United States Army Military District of Washington, which supports the activities of the army and of the Department of Defense, is primarily responsible for protecting the country’s capital. Other duties include arranging state funerals and supervising military participation in ceremonies for foreign dignitaries. It is headquartered at Washington, D.C.\n\nThe United States Army Test and Evaluation Command plans and conducts experiments, tests, and evaluations to provide high-ranking officers with information on army equipment. It is headquartered at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland.\n\nThe United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, trains and educates students to be military officers. Graduates receive a commission as second lieutenant in the army.\n\nThe United States Army Acquisition Support Center trains and develops an acquisition force to provide products and services to ensure the readiness of the army. It is headquartered at Fort Belvoir.\n\nThe United States Army War College is located in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. Its purpose is to provide a high-quality, graduate-level education to senior military officers (colonels and lieutenant colonels) and civilians to develop their leadership skills. Graduates earn a master’s degree in strategic studies.\n\nArlington National Cemetery is the U.S. national burial ground in Arlington county, Virginia. The Department of the Army oversees its operations and management.\n\nThe Civilian Human Resources Agency is in charge of civilian recruitment and employment in the U.S. Army. It is headquartered at Aberdeen Proving Ground.\n\nArmy Branches\n\nThe branches of the U.S. Army fall into four broad categories: combat arms, combat support arms, combat service support arms, and special branches. Combinations of these arms function as teams.\n\nCombat arms are the branches that are directly involved in fighting. They include the infantry, armor, air defense artillery, field artillery, and aviation. The infantry engages the enemy by using firepower and maneuvers. Although infantry may be transported by any means, they normally fight on foot. The infantry is the basic fighting force, but it functions as a part of a team that includes other arms. Armor conducts mounted mobile, land, and air cavalry warfare. Most armor units are organized around a nucleus of tanks.\n\nAir defense artillery destroys enemy aircraft and missiles. It is also capable of attacking ground targets with guns, missiles, and automatic weapons. Field artillery also destroys enemy targets and is the primary support for infantry and armor. Its weapons include both cannon and missiles. Aviation primarily works with field troops. A group of aircraft assigned to a field unit is under the control of the commander of the unit.\n\nCombat support arms are branches of the army including the Corps of Engineers, the Signal Corps, the Military Police Corps, the Chemical Corps, and Military Intelligence. The Corps of Engineers has combat units that are responsible for construction and demolition. The Signal Corps installs, operates, and maintains communications and electronic equipment. The Military Police Corps performs such duties as supervising prisoners of war, preventing crime, and providing security. The Chemical Corps assists combat units principally through activities such as chemical reconnaissance and decontamination. Military Intelligence units provide background information on the enemy and on the weather and terrain. They also monitor enemy communications and interrogate prisoners of war.\n\nCombat service support arms are branches of the army that perform logistics and administrative functions that support the combat arms. These include the Adjutant General’s Corps, Finance Corps, Ordnance Corps, Quartermaster Corps, and Transportation Corps. The Adjutant General’s Corps deals with personnel, including reassignments and promotions, as well as the postal system and the band. The Finance Corps handles financial management issues, and the Ordnance Corps develops and supports weapons systems, including missiles and ammunition. The Quartermaster Corps is involved with the acquisition, storage, and distribution of equipment and supplies. The Transportation Corps includes positions involved with moving personnel and equipment.\n\nSpecial branches of the army include law, medical, and religious fields. The Judge Advocate General’s Corps provides legal services to the army. There are six branches of the Army Medical Department—Army Medical Specialist Corps, Army Nurse Corps, Dental Corps, Medical Corps, Medical Service Corps, and Veterinary Corps. The Chaplain Corps offers religious support to army members and their families.\n\nArmy Division\n\nThe division is the smallest force that includes a balanced team of all the combat arms and support arms of the army. A division contains from 10,000 to 15,000 soldiers and is usually commanded by a major general. The elements of a division may include a headquarters and headquarters company, an aviation battalion, an air defense artillery battalion, an engineer battalion, and a combat electronic warfare and intelligence battalion. Other elements may include an armored cavalry squadron, a signal battalion, a chemical company, a military police company, and a division field artillery headquarters with attached field artillery firing battalions. A division may also comprise three or more combat brigades and a support command that provides medical, transportation, supply, field maintenance, and administrative services.\n\nSeveral divisions make up a corps. Two or more corps constitute a field army. Four or five field armies make up a group, which may contain between 400,000 and 1,000,000 soldiers. In times of war three or more field armies make up an army region, with a four- or five-star general at the helm.\n\nDivisions have evolved into several types but usually are classified as either infantry or armored. The infantry division uses the foot soldier equipped with light weapons as its basic component. However, it also includes supporting artillery, armor, and engineer units and has its own communication, supply, maintenance, and evacuation services. It is the oldest type of division and continues to be the core of the army.\n\nGeneral infantry divisions, when modified by the introduction of light equipment and given special training, may perform specialized roles. Examples are airborne (parachute) divisions and mountain (alpine) divisions. Mechanized divisions use truck transport and light armored vehicles sufficient to cover all the troops of an infantry division.\n\nLike the infantry division, the armored division contains elements of all arms and services. However, it is much stronger in tank forces than the infantry division. This type of division developed after World War I. When faced with danger, the tanks, infantry, engineers, artillery, and antitank weapons of a division work as a coordinated team.\n\nSpecial Operations Forces\n\nU.S. Army Special Forces, or Green Berets, are trained to infiltrate deep behind an enemy’s lines and to carry on guerrilla warfare. Because of the hazards of this type of fighting the Special Forces is made up entirely of volunteers. Special Forces candidates first complete basic and advanced training and the basic airborne course. They are then assigned to the Special Forces Training Group, located at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. Upon completion of training—which can take from about one to two years, depending on the chosen specialty—they become part of 12-member detachments, the basic Special Forces unit.\n\nA Special Forces detachment is made up of two officers and 10 specialists. Each of the specialists is proficient in one of the five basic Special Forces skills. Two are skilled in the use of all types of weapons. Another two are communications experts. A third pair, trained in medicine, are capable of performing limited surgery and of treating illnesses and diseases common to a particular region. A fourth pair are engineer specialists trained in logistics, navigation, and demolition. The fifth pair are trained in operations and intelligence. Since two members have the same specialty, the unit can be broken into two smaller groups if needed to complete a mission.\n\nAll members of a Special Forces detachment have some training in the other four skills. In case the group gets separated, each individual has the knowledge to continue the mission and to survive. Other educational courses that Special Forces members take include foreign language and culture training.\n\nOther special operations forces are the U.S. Army Rangers of the 75th Ranger Regiment and the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR) Night Stalkers. The 75th Ranger Regiment is a light infantry unit that conducts missions inside enemy territory. The SOAR Night Stalkers are an elite group that engages in nighttime operations from helicopters.\n\nThe Army Compartmented Elements, commonly known as the 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment–Delta (or, simply, Delta Force), is a special missions unit under operational control of the Joint Special Operations Command. Delta Force concentrates on counterterrorism, especially capturing or killing high-value targets or breaking up terrorist groups. The unit also participates in hostage rescues, works covertly with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and protects senior leaders traveling to war-torn countries.\n\nHistory of the United States Army\n\nThe first regular American fighting force, the Continental Army, was organized by the Second Continental Congress on June 14, 1775, during the early months of the American Revolution. The next year Congress established a standing force composed of better-trained soldiers enlisted for lengthier periods than the colonial militias, which disbanded after each fight. These standing forces were the beginning of the regular army. After the war the Continental Congress declared that a standing army was contrary to democratic principles, and it largely disbanded the veteran forces. However, many American Indian peoples sought to defend their lands against U.S. settlement. As disturbances broke out on the frontier, the Continental Congress soon found that regular troops were needed to protect U.S. frontier forts and lands from Indians. When the government was organized under the Constitution, there was a force of about 700 officers and enlisted soldiers.\n\nThe country entered the War of 1812 with only about 7,000 trained soldiers. After the war Congress authorized a regular force of 10,000. At the outbreak of war with Mexico in 1846 the regular army consisted of only about 8,000. This small force, augmented by thousands of volunteers, won the Mexican-American War. Congress then authorized strengthening the army to 18,000 troops. This force furnished the framework for the Northern armies of the American Civil War.\n\nAfter President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863—promising freedom for enslaved people held in the Confederate states—African Americans joined the army in significant numbers. By the end of the war about 180,000 Black soldiers had served in the army. However, they were placed in segregated units, and their regiments were commanded by white soldiers.\n\nAfter the Civil War Congress set the size of the regular army at 54,000 soldiers but later reduced it to 25,000. Some of these troops saw constant service in battles and other conflicts with American Indians in the West. An 1866 law authorized the U.S. Army to form cavalry and infantry regiments of Black soldiers, called buffalo soldiers. The law required their officers to be white. The buffalo soldiers served on the western frontier from 1867 to 1896. The U.S. Army was primarily an Indian-fighting force when the Spanish-American War erupted in 1898, but Spain’s weakness and the success of the U.S. Navy soon ended the conflict. After the war the United States had to garrison overseas possessions, necessitating an increase in army strength to 100,000 soldiers.\n\nThe National Defense Act of 1916 created the framework of the army that fought in World War I. The act increased the strength of the regular army and provided for a reserve corps of officers and enlisted troops. It also authorized the president to call the state national guard units into federal service. Most of the U.S. forces in World War I, however, were raised by means of the Selective Service Act of 1917. Of the 3,700,000 soldiers under arms at the end of the war, 2,800,000 had been drafted into the service.\n\nIn the years of peace that followed, lack of Congressional appropriations cut the army’s strength to 12,000 officers and 118,000 enlisted soldiers. In 1939 U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s proclamation of a “limited emergency” included an order to increase the size of the regular army and the national guard. The first national guards and reserves were called into federal service in 1940.\n\nSwift expansion of the army resulted from the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940. The United States entered World War II with a force of some 1,600,000 troops. By 1945 the army had 8,300,000 troops. Two-thirds of them were drafted through selective service. Most of the army troops served as infantry, but there were also armored, airborne, cavalry, and mountain divisions.\n\nWomen began to occupy an increasing role in the U.S. Army during that time. More than 150,000 women served in the Women’s Army Auxiliary Corps (later the Women’s Army Corps, or WAC). They worked as nurses, mechanics, clerks, and intelligence analysts. After the war most of these women returned to civilian life, but the success of the WAC led to its integration into the regular army. The WAC existed as a separate corps within the army until 1978, when it was abolished. Women were then integrated into all aspects of army life except combat duty. In 2013 the Department of Defense lifted the ban on women in combat.\n\nMeanwhile, after World War II ended with Japan’s surrender in August 1945, the U.S. Army demobilized rapidly. By 1947 the number of troops on active duty had fallen below the authorized peacetime strength of 670,000. National guard and organized reserve enlistments, however, were greater than ever. The Selective Service Act of 1948 established a peacetime draft. In 1947 the army air force was separated from the army. It became the United States Air Force, coequal with the army and the navy. In addition, control of some operations was withdrawn from the individual services and placed under the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nIn 1948 President Harry S. Truman signed an executive order abolishing racial segregation in the U.S. military. The U.S. Army at first opposed the change. At the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950 the draft was extended to 1959 and included all eligible men, regardless of race. (It was extended for additional four-year periods in 1959, in 1963, and in 1967 and was extended for a two-year period in 1971.) Losses during the war caused the army to bolster white units with Black troops to maintain combat effectiveness. In 1953 the army announced that it had integrated more than 90 percent of Black troops in its ranks.\n\nThe Reserve Forces Act of 1955 increased the number of ready reserve members from 1.5 million to 2.9 million. Among its other provisions it enabled draft-age men to enlist directly into the ready reserve or the standby reserve. In 1963 the reorganization of national guard and organized reserve divisions was complete. The period of service for reservists was cut from eight to six years. Further restructuring of the army reserve and army national guard was ordered in 1965.\n\nBeginning in the mid-1950s U.S. Army personnel served in South Vietnam in an advisory capacity. After U.S. bases were attacked by the Viet Cong (communist rebels backed by North Vietnam) in 1965, the army played an active part in the Vietnam War. By 1968 seven army divisions, plus other units, were fighting in Vietnam. Army troops totaled about 1,470,000 at the height of the conflict.\n\nDuring the 1960s many people criticized selective service. Some critics opposed United States military involvement in Vietnam. Many argued, however, that the system itself was unfair since, through its exemptions, it allowed certain groups—for example, college students—to escape military service. To correct such inequities, Congress instituted a draft lottery in 1969.\n\nAfter completion of the U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam in 1973 the peacetime draft was ended. The army was returned to volunteer status and maintained a force of about 830,000 troops. The army, and the other armed services, attracted disproportionate numbers of Blacks and of poor, undereducated volunteers. In addition, low pay scales caused reenlistment rates to drop. Registration, without conscription, was resumed in 1980.\n\nDuring the Persian Gulf War in early 1991 the Allied coalition against Iraq reached a strength of more than 700,000 troops, including 539,000 U.S. personnel. After a massive Allied air war lasting several weeks, the Allies sent in large numbers of ground troops to destroy Iraqi fortifications, weapons stockpiles, and tanks. Within four days the Allies had destroyed most of Iraq’s elite Republican Guard, and U.S. President George H.W. Bush had declared a cease-fire.\n\nAt the beginning of the 21st century the U.S. Army active duty troop strength stood at about 500,000. Some of these troops were involved in the Iraq War from 2003 to 2011. In March–April 2003 a combined force of troops from the United States and Great Britain (with smaller contingents from several other countries) invaded Iraq and rapidly defeated Iraqi military and paramilitary forces. However, the U.S.-led occupation of Iraq was subsequently caught up in the country’s civil war.\n\nAs the occupation continued, the U.S. death toll rose, leading to a drop in army recruitment numbers. The army was forced to adopt alternative methods to replace its thinning ranks. National guard units were deployed to Iraq, and thousands of reservists were called up to active duty. The army employed a controversial measure, known as stop-loss, to prevent troops scheduled for deployment from leaving the military. By the time U.S. troops left Iraq in December 2011, almost 4,500 Americans had been killed and some 30,000 had been wounded. Most of these were army troops."
