        "text": "This program is FREE to join and requires a volunteer to pick up litter (and recyclables) along both sides of an adopted road segment (in the right-of-way), including bus stops and shelters. This program creates a partnership of citizens and local government to promote civic pride and preserve our clean environment by eliminating roadside litter. Help improve the appearance of Montgomery County and decrease the amount of debris/trash that washes into our waterways!\n\nParticipants are required to perform clean-up efforts at their adopted road segment as needed with a minimum of six major cleanings per year (the equivalent of every other month) and to report the cleaning results to MCDOT . CLEANINGS ARE MANDATORY TO REMAIN IN THE PROGRAM . Cleanings are scheduled by the participant at their convenience. There is no time limit on how long a road segment can be adopted and participants can retire at any time (in writing).\n\nCLICK HERE to learn more.\n\nOnce an application is submitted, the approval process could take 3-4 weeks. Most communication will be through email so there is a record of communication and activity. If approved, an email will be sent to let the participant know the appication was approved, then an official approval letter will be mailed with a packet of program information. If denied, the participant will be notified by email. To expedite the approval process be sure to answer all questions on the application, include two road segments (should the first choice not be available) and be sure the name for the nameplate does not exceed 15 characters per line (this includes spaces), 2 lines max.\n\nSigns are not required to participate in the program.\n\nIn recognition of the participant’s cleaning and reporting efforts, 2 signs will be fabricated and installed bearing the participant's name. Slogans, website address, social media information or anything other than the participant's name is not allowed. After an application is approved, it will take 13-16 weeks for sign installation. 1 sign is normally installed at the beginning and 1 sign at the end of an adopted road segment. All County signs are installed within the public right-of-way and are placed with the consideration of certain engineering factors such as line of sight and safety concerns as determined by MCDOT engineers. If there are alot of resident complaints regarding the installation of a sign, if may get removed.\n\nIMPORTANT: When choosing a name for the nameplate there is a 15-character limit (this includes spaces ) per line, two lines max. Slogans, messages, phone numbers, website addresses or any other information besides the volunteer’s name is prohibited.\n\nRoads that are not designated as rustic will have the purple sign installed (see below photo on left). Roads that are designated as rural will require a brown rustic road sign (see below photo on right).\n\nRustic Roads are classified as rural by legislation. They are historic and scenic roadways in an area where natural, agricultural, or historic features are predominant. Most Rustic Roads are narrow, windy and have no sidewalk. They are considered low volume roads intended primarily for local or agricultural use, as designated by the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission. This classification restricts the type of maintenance that can be performed on these roads so that the rural character can be maintained.\n\nLearn more about Rustic Roads in Montgomery County.\n\nView a map of Rustic roads in Montgomery County."
