        "text": "Top image courtesy of the US Army.\n\nThe US Army was a central component of the US military presence in the Hawaiian Islands before the start of World War II, and a major factor in America’s strategic calculations before the Japanese attack. By 1941, Hawaii had become a crucial piece of the US Army’s defensive network in the Pacific. By the time of the Japanese attack, the Pacific Army had steadily grown to become the largest overseas garrison of US troops. Along with the Panama Canal Zone, the island of O’ahu was the prewar linchpin of continental defense. Something of a natural fortress encircled by reefs and protected by difficult mountain ranges to the north, O’ahu was considered an impenetrable island citadel by the War Department in the months before the Japanese attack.\n\nHawaii’s importance to the Army was not the result of a great deal of long-term planning, though. Envisioning its responsibilities as limited to the continent, the Army thought little of the islands throughout much of the nineteenth century. When the United States rushed to empire and annexed Hawaii in August 1898, it introduced a new role for the Army: protecting vulnerable overseas possessions.\n\nA small garrison arrived on O’ahu only days later and took up quarters at the new Camp McKinley at the foot of Diamond Head. Throughout much of the nineteenth century, the Army’s principal focus was defending Hawaii against invasion. Up to this point, Army officers viewed it as a land-based force, failing to place the islands into a larger Pacific defense strategic context. In light of Japan’s successes in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-05, however, Pearl Harbor’s role as a defensive and offensive base of naval operations clearly linked it to the Philippines.\n\nThe Japanese threat triggered a flurry of construction projects. Imposing heavy guns and concrete barriers sprang up on O’ahu’s vulnerable southern shore. In 1910, the Army completed the first gun emplacement at Diamond Head. Engineers drained or filled in swampy ground near Fort DeRussy. Up the coast, Fort Kamehameha rose out of a marshy area, built from dredgings taken from Pearl Harbor. As a reflection of the increasing importance of the Pacific to the Army, the Hawaiian Department formed as an independent command in 1913 under direct control of the War Department.\n\nThe Army continued an incoherent strategic vision for the Pacific and Hawaii throughout the 1920s and 1930s, however. Planners grappled with questions of resourcing and strategic priorities in the event of war with Japan. The 1921 Washington Naval Treaty prohibited any new defenses west of Hawaii, making Pearl Harbor and the Army defenses on O’ahu increasingly important in any Pacific war. As a result, the Army formed the Hawaiian Division and gave it a defensive mission. The Army and Navy’s 1924 ORANGE plan, a joint campaign plan for war against Japan, made Hawaii the center of America’s Pacific defenses, the outer bastion of a network that ran from Alaska to Panama.\n\nBeginning in 1935, the Army garrison in Hawaii was reinforced considerably in light of the perceived increased threat from Japan. The soldiers, many of them volunteers, belonged to a relatively small and struggling service viewed by much of the country as a refuge for society’s dregs. The interwar Regular Army had considerable responsibilities, but limited means. Along with an isolationist mood, the Great Depression had forced cuts to already meager defense budgets. Characterized by historian Edward Coffman as an army in limbo, the Army effected modernizing reforms but made do with weapons, equipment, and organizations left over from the last war. Basic training occurred when soldiers reported to their unit. Inspections were rigorous, regulations were law, punishment involved strain and sweat, and military custom was sacred.\n\nAs a result, Army troops were not mentally prepared for the Japanese strikes against their installations on O’ahu on December 7. Beginning at 7:55 a.m., the attackers completely destroyed the Hawaiian Air Depot at Hickam Field, crippling aircraft on the ground and reducing many of the hangars and barracks to ash. Dive bombers hit Wheeler Field minutes later, and nearby Schofield Barracks, a target of opportunity rather than one of primary importance. The outcome was similar. The Hawaiian Air Force was an easy target on the ground, having grouped its aircraft closely for easier security against sabotage. While a small number of Army aircraft managed to get airborne, the Japanese attackers made easy work of most of them. With no time to disperse the aircraft, more than two-thirds of Wheeler’s planes lay destroyed or damaged within a matter of minutes.\n\nThe beginning of the attack was a shock for Army personnel who anticipated nothing more than a pleasant Sunday morning. The majority were not expecting to find themselves in a war, and their reactions showed. Robert Kinzler, an Army radio operator in the 25th Infantry Division’s 27th Infantry Regiment, awoke from a late night out to the sound of a tremendous explosion. Running outside his barracks, an unfamiliar-looking airplane came into view just above a nearby building and flashed past. Having had no aircraft identification training, he reasoned it must have been a Navy or Marine plane and continued toward the mess hall for breakfast. Others thought the same, believing that camouflaged Marine planes were staging a mock battle. The sound of bugles made clear, though, that this was more than a training exercise. The soldiers hurriedly assembled at Schofield Barracks and received orders to rush toward their pre-assigned battle stations.\n\nTheodore Pavlovich of the 25th Infantry Division’s 35th Infantry Regiment was sitting down to a mess hall breakfast when a bomb exploded at a nearby barracks at Schofield. Initially confused, Japanese aircraft began strafing the base, leaving little doubt about what was happening. Ammunition and weapons were meticulously accounted for during the peace of the interwar, and only Army supply sergeants and officers had keys to access storage lockers. Pavlovich and a few fellow soldiers kicked open the door to the supply room after the sergeant could not be roused from a drunken stupor. Climbing through the attic and making their way to the roof, Pavolich and the others set up a machine gun and fired at the attacking aircraft as they flew past.\n\nSoldiers did the same across the island, collecting pistols, rifles, whatever was at hand, to put up as much resistance as they could in their unprepared and confused state. GIs scrambled to ad hoc fighting positions, harassed by ricocheting bullets, explosions, shattering glass, and flying debris. At Fort Kamehameha, soldiers from a coast artillery regiment set up machine guns on a tennis court and took aim at the swarming aircraft. For the most part, insufficient as they might have been, acts like these were the only effective means of fighting back. Army anti-aircraft batteries were ineffective and accounted for only a handful of enemy kills."
