Kenneth H. Robison II, Sons of Spanish American War Veterans Under the initial call for volunteers on April 27th, 1898, the Secretary of War requested that the District of Columbia provide as their quota a battalion of infantry, however after several requests from prominent residents the quota was increased the next day to a full regiment of infantry. In response to this call the selected companies of the District of Columbia National Guard were ordered to assemble at the National Guard Armory, located over the Center Market, and appointed to command the new regiment was George Herbert Harries who was then serving as a Brigadier General in the District National Guard. Assembling at the armory the men were brought before a Medical Board for their physical examinations to determine if they were fit for active service; of those examined by this board over 50% were rejected for various physical defects and new volunteers were quickly brought forward to fill their place. As these examinations were completed the companies were mustered into service, and from May 10th to 17th the men were officially mustered into United States service, by companies, as the First (1st) District of Columbia Infantry Regiment, United States Volunteers, with a total of forty-nine (49) officers and nine hundred and twenty-two (922) enlisted men, to serve for two years unless sooner discharged. By May 13th the entire First Battalion (Companies A, B, F & G) had been mustered into service and were moved from the armory to a new campsite near Woodburn Manor at Falls Church, Virginia. On May 18th they were joined at the camp by the balance of the regiment upon the mustering in of the last company (C) on May 17th at the Armory. In this camp the work of the initial organization was completed, and the men began training in the schools of the soldier performing guard and sentry duties, and taking part in several parades, including an elaborate review on May 21st in which the regiment was reviewed by President William McKinley prior to being presented with a stand of colors by the Legion of Loyal Women. On the same day the men of the regiment broke camp and marched to the nearby railroad depot where they boarded the trains and headed by rail for Georgia. Arriving at Rossville, Georgia, in two sections on May 23rd and 24th, the regiment marches the short distance to Camp George H. Thomas at Chickamauga Park, Georgia. Reporting at the camp the regiment was assigned to the Second Brigade, 1st Division of the 3rd Army Corps, the brigade being composed of the 2nd Nebraska and 2nd New York Infantry Regiment, and was under the temporary command of Colonel Charles J. Bills of the 2nd Nebraska. The regiments time at the camp was of a very short duration, as on June 1st the men marched back to Rossville and boarded trains which carried them to Tampa, Florida. Arriving at Tampa on June 4th, the regiment marched to a nearby camp, where they were assigned to the Second Brigade, Second Division of the Fourth Army Corps, serving with their comrades from the 2nd New York and being joined by the 5th Maryland Infantry Regiment, all under the command of Brigadier General Louis H. Carpenter. While in camp at Tampa the regiment continued training in the school of the soldiers and the various garrison duties; however, there was some unexpected excitement when one day a herd of nearby government mules suddenly stampeded without warning and came dashing through the regimental camp and scattering men and equipment in all directions. On June 12th Company H, under Captain Henry B. Looker, was detached from the regiment and along with a provisional company from the 1st Illinois Infantry Regiment assigned to the Provisional Battalion of Engineers under the command of Major John W. Sackett of the 1st Florida Infantry Regiment. This battalion was created due to the need for engineers in the Porto Rico Expedition, the larger majority of regular engineers having been sent as part of the Cuban and Philippine Expeditions, and as such the men of the company moved to the camp at Picnic Island where they began training as engineers. On July 10th and 11th the men of the company began loading the engineering equipment and supplies aboard the steamship ï¿½Lampassas,ï¿½ and sailed on the 11th to Key West where they engaged in target practice while additional engineering equipment and supplies were loaded aboard. On Jul 15th the transport sailed from Key West, arriving at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, on the 20th where the men spent the next two days building, disassembling and rebuilding a pontoon pier and then loading, unloading and re-loading the same to ensure that the men had been properly trained in its use. Sailing on the 22nd they arrived at Guanica Harbor, Porto Rico, on the 25th, and at the request of the commander of the USS Gloucester, they with a detachment of artillery, sailors and marines, took part in a landing against the 300 Spanish defenders and advanced through the town, securing it with no resistance as the Spanish withdrew as the men advanced. At noon the command was relieved by the men of General Guy V. Henryï¿½s command, and they returned to the town and began construction of a pier, and then unloaded supplies and equipment. The following day they were dispatched to American positions overlooking the town, where they were not only subjected to Spanish fire, but also were subjected to friendly fire from nearby American troops. On July 29th the balance of the company was sent back to Guanica to serve as the garrison for the town, as well as engineer troops, however a detachment of the company was kept in place during the remainder of the companyï¿½s service in the trenches. In addition to their duties as the garrison the men continued their service as engineers and from July 29th to September 7th were engaged in the construction of a road from the town to the nearby hills; this work was at first done solely by the men of the command, however as illness began to make its appearance local labor was used under the supervision of the soldiers. At the beginning of September, the men were relieved and began making preparations to rejoin the regiment; on September 8th they boarded a transport at Guanica and sailed to New York City, New York, arriving there on the 16th, and then traveling south arrived in Washington, D.C., on the 17th, being furloughed for thirty-days. While Company H began its journeys south, the balance of the regiment remained in camp at Tampa. At the end of June orders were received from the War Department for the regiment, minus Company H, to begin making the necessary preparations to join the forces serving in Cuba. On July 2nd the men began loading their equipment and supplies aboard the steamship ï¿½Catania,ï¿½ and by evening the men had boarded the ship in preparation for the journey south. At noon on July 3rd the ship pulled out of Tampa Bay and steamed south, however the journey for the men was from a pleasant one; traveling along the coast the ship ran aground several times (once while between Tampa and Egmont Keys and again just past the Egmont Light House), and on July 5th they were delayed for twenty-four hours at Key West when the ships fresh-water pumps stopped working, forcing Colonel Harries to request the assistance of the Navy in improvising a new pump for the ship. Colonel Harries in his official report stated that the Catania in her present condition ï¿½ï¿½may fairly be denominated a bad ship, her machinery needs a great deal of overhauling, and some of it ought to be replaced; her system of fresh water storage and distribution is radically defective; her steering gear will not do its work; her boats are very dubious, and do not seem to have been out of the chocks for many months; there are but four life-preservers on board; her water-closets for enlisted men are only fairly good, while the water-closets for officers are probably the worst ever devised on board any ship.ï¿½ The trouble with the ships machinery was only part of the problem however, the ship was not large enough for all the men and equipment, especially after the addition of 250 hogsheads of water at Key West, and as a result two and half companies were forced to spend the trip sleeping on the upper deck of the ship; fortunately for these men the weather during their voyage was described as being ï¿½extremely fine.ï¿½ Arriving off of Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, on July 9th the ship was delayed for three hours due to a combination of engine trouble and awaiting the arrival of the USS Wasp to provide an escort father down the coast; however, at 5 pm the Wasp arrived and the ships began to sail for Altares Bay, but were delayed an additional twelve hours due to additional engine troubles with the steamship. The ships finally arrived at Altares Bay at 8 am on July 10th, and the regiment begins to disembark their equipment and supplies; reporting in the regiment is assigned to the 2nd Brigade of the Provisional Division, 5th Army, along with the men of the 1st Illinois, 9th Massachusetts, 34th Michigan and 8th Ohio Infantry Regiments; however shortly thereafter the command is consolidated and designated as the 2nd Brigade, 3rd Division and will consist of the 1st Illinois and 8th Ohio Infantry Regiments. On July 11th the regiment receives orders to march to the front, and conducts a march from Siboney to Santiago de Cuba where they immediately move into the front lines of the siege of that place, being attached to Major General Henry W. Lawtonï¿½s 2nd Division. On July 15th the regiment is moved to a position on the San Juan Heights overlooking the town, and there they continue performing picket duty and entrenching their position against the Spanish, being under fire for a large portion of the time. With the major fighting having been done only a few days before their arrival in the trenches, the men of the regiment take part in the day-to-day life of the siege, battling not only the Spanish but also the various disease attached to the tropical climate. Following the surrender of the Spanish forces at Santiago, the regiment and the rest of the American Army remained in camp around Santiago, however fears about the health of the command soon resulted in the sending of the regiments of the 5th Corps back to the states for the menï¿½s health. On August 18th and 19th the men of the regiment boarded two transports at Santiago and began the journey north to New York. Arriving at Montauk Point, Long Island, New York, on August 26th, the regiment disembarks and marches into Camp Wikoff, where it will remain in quarantine from the 27th to 29th. Being released from quarantine the men move into the general camp to await further orders, which came shortly when in early September the regiment is ordered to begin making preparations to be mustered out of service. On September 8th the men broke camp and boarding a steamer are taken across the harbor to Jersey City, New Jersey, where they disembarked and boarded the coaches of the two sections of the trains that would carry them to Washington, D.C. The trip itself was mostly uneventful, however one incident happened when Quartermaster Sergeant William Walsh of Company A leaned too far out of the trains window and was knocked out when he hit his head on a telegraph pole near the tracks; thankfully for him the injury was minor and he continued the journey south. The first section arrived at the depot in Washington at 1:15 pm on the 9th, where the men were greeted by a large crowd of family, friends, well-wishers, etc., and were soon joined by the second section at 1:25 pm. Disembarking the men were given a meal by the citizens who had prepared several tables of food for the volunteers, which they were permitted to enjoy until 2:35 pm. Forming, the regiment then marched up Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House, being cheered along the route of march, the regiment was reviewed as they marched by President William McKinley, and then continued onto the grounds of the Executive Mansion where they halted and stacked arms. There they received family, friends and other visitors until afterwards were given a verbal furlough for forty-eight hours, with instructions to report at the National Guard Armory over Center Market on Monday, September 12th. Reporting as ordered, the men of the regiment were furloughed for thirty (30) days, on September 12th, with the exception of the regimental officers and a small guard, who were to remain on duty to complete the necessary work prior to the mustering out of the regiment. Upon the expiration of the furlough the regiment reassembled at the Armory, and on November 18th marched to the Convention Hall in Washington, where there was an official welcoming ceremony in which each member of the regiment was presented with a medal for their service before a crowd of over 8,000 people. Marching back to camp the regiment completed preparations for their discharge, and on November 20th the regiment was officially mustered out of United States service with forty-nine (49) officers and eight hundred and ten (810) enlisted men. During the regiments six months of service there were a total of fifty-three (53) officers and nine hundred and thirty-seven (937) enlisted men mustered into service with the regiment. Of these three (3) officers resigned, one (1) officer died of disease, thirty-two (32) enlisted men were transferred, eight (8) were discharged due to disability, sixty-five (65) were discharged per orders and twenty-two (22) died of disease; a total loss of one hundred and thirty-one (131) officers and enlisted men.
