        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nFor generations cold weather and extreme cold weather have altered the outcome of the best laid military plans. Conflicts between nations that took years to resolve involved sustaining armies during the winter months. Commanders of the past moved forward utilizing instinct, persistence, and the undying drive to succeed. Often, the logistics of resupply and keeping the Army fed and warm were the greatest threat, not the enemy.\n\nDecades of extensive research and development have greatly improved commanders' ability to accomplish their missions. Due to the fall of the Soviet Union as a threat and the current philosophy of downsizing U.S. forces, today's commanders are required to accomplish their missions with less equipment and personnel. Military personnel today are highly trained, and equipment is state of the art.\n\nThe instruments of death have been developed and utilized with great success. Instruments to sustain the life support systems of U.S. soldiers on the modern battlefield must keep pace with these changes. Following World War II great strides were made through the development of a doctrine to improve the \"Quality of Life\" of U.S. soldiers. Since that time, there has been a continued emphasis on improving food, apparel, and other supplies and logistics for the soldier.\n\nHarsh winter environments require detailed planning, coordination, and troops that are physically hardened and trained. Flexibility, maneuverability, and the use of equipment are all reduced in the cold, while logistic, engineering, subsistence, and medical problems increase dramatically. Winter creates physiological stress on the individual, and the additional weight of winter clothing, sleeping bags, and rations combine to reduce individual and unit mobility. \"Survive, move, fight!\" is the moxie of winter warfare.\n\nTHE U.S. ARMY FAMILY OF RATIONS\n\nFoodservice equipment to support and service a family of rations has been developed under the auspices of the U.S. Army. Examples of this equipment include the Mobile Kitchen Trailer (MKT) and Kitchen Company Level Field Feeding equipment (KCLFF). Rations supported through these kitchen units include menus of A Rations; B Rations; Meal, Ready-to- Eat (MRE); Ration, Cold Weather (RCW); and Food Packet, Long-Range Patrol II (LRP[II]).\n\nFeeding the right meal, at the right place, and at the right time is the ultimate goal of the Army feeding program. The U.S. Army has had a field feeding standard of providing all soldiers with one MRE and two hot meals per day (U.S. Department of the Army, 1991a). The hot meal has been primarily the T Ration. This standard has also allowed for two A Ration meals in a 7-d period. The standard was regarded by field commanders as a prescription that dictated the contents and timing of meals, rather than as a policy or guideline for overall nutrition. They felt that the standard failed to offer them the flexibility they needed to modify feeding schedules within their own commands in response to the demands of particular situations.\n\nAt that same time, the U.S. Army Quartermaster Center and School was aggressively pursuing a revised feeding standard that would provide the commander with the flexibility needed to ensure that all soldiers on the battlefield were provided the right meal, at the right place, and at the right time (U.S. Department of the Army, 1991a). A revised feeding policy was written, which simply states that field commanders have the responsibility for providing their soldiers with three quality meals per day. This revised feeding policy (U.S. Department of the Army, 1990) was approved for implementation in November 1990 and was successfully executed.\n\nTo support the revised feeding policy of three quality meals per day, the commander has available to him a family of rations that is built on individual and group rations. The primary individual ration is the MRE, and the group rations include unitized T Rations, unitized B Rations, and A Rations.\n\nThe RCW is a unique individual ration that is used in arctic environments and that includes six menus containing three entrees, several snacks, and numerous hot drinks (U.S. Department of the Army, 1989). Little preparation of the ration is required by the soldier. The RCW is lighter and smaller than three MREs and contains approximately 4,500 kcal per daily ration menu with a nutrient content designed to conserve body water. The packaging cannot be damaged by temperatures below freezing, and it is flat, flexible, and waterproof. Although the RCW was designed to be totally self-contained, there have been training exercises in which additional food items have been included (primarily prepared soup and coffee). MREs have also been used as a daily ration in arctic environments; they must be supplemented with additional ration items to be nutritionally adequate.\n\nSoldiers with the Alaska Army National Guard (\"scouts\")2 who operate out of the most remote villages have experienced problems feeding their troops. Past generations of Alaskan scouts were hardened veterans of extreme cold weather, and they ate off the land. Their diet consisted of seal and polar bear. As these older scouts retired and were replaced by younger scouts, it was found that the replacements could not sustain themselves as had their predecessors, who had more of the skills needed to live off of the land. To update the scouts' diet to Army standards that would be supported with the state-of-the-art \"family of rations,\" the Alaska Army National Guard's suggested immediate solution was to use the RCW. Two problems occurred with its use, however, which made replacement of the RCW necessary. First, the RCW was still a dramatic diet change for the younger troops. Most scouts had been exposed to MREs and preferred the MRE to the RCW. Second, the RCW required more water for consumption because all components are dehydrated or vacuum packed. Today, scouts in Alaska consume MREs with supplements, and additional bottled water is air dropped at predetermined locations.\n\nEQUIPMENT PROBLEMS: THE MOBILE KITCHEN TRAILER\n\nUnder U.S. Army doctrine (FM 10-23, 1991), the Mobile Kitchen Trailer (MKT) is used in all areas and under all climatic environments for military operations in the field. The MKT provides a standard, efficient, vehicular-mounted operating unit that eliminates the need to improvise kitchen facilities. The MKT can withstand frequent movement over unimproved surfaces, and it can be moved with relative ease over great distances in daylight, darkness, and under blackout conditions. The kitchen is engineered to provide three hot meals per day for a company-sized unit and requires no major overhaul or replacement of major components for 180 days.\n\nThe MKT is issued as basic equipment to battalions, companies, batteries, and detachments as authorized in the Table of Organization and Equipment (TO&E) for mess, personnel, and equipment (CTA 50-909, Field and Garrison Furnishings and Equipment). MKTs can be pooled when the tactical or logistical situation dictates the desirability of centralized food preparation. One kitchen is issued per company or equivalent unit. The kitchen requires a 5-soldier team to set it up in 1 hour.\n\nThe MKT and its component equipment can be used to produce all families of rations and additional supplements. However, during extreme cold weather the MKT, as originally designed for tropical environments, is not suitable; the temperature is inadequate for the proper functioning of the equipment as well as for the personnel. A product improvement test involving two different models of the MKT was conducted in 1988 at the U.S. Army Cold Regions Test Center (CRTC), Fort Greely, Alaska (Sargent, 1988). The two models tested were the NRDEC-MKT-85 and the MKT-85 with winterization kit from the Sixth Infantry Division (Light) (sixth ID [L] improved MKT). The test was designed to determine if adequate protection could be provided in a cold environment without an external, heated shelter and to develop modifications that would allow the MKT to be transported without damage by rotary wing aircraft.\n\nDuring 33 actual and simulated feeding missions conducted in ambient temperatures ranging from -38° to 11°F (-39° to -12°C), both MKTs were instrumented using 10 thermocouplers to monitor temperatures. The thermocouplers were positioned at head, hand, and foot levels centered at the front and rear of the center work area and at the hand level on the interior side walls. Four M-2 burner units were operated in each MKT with one-half of the roof vents open 6 to 12 inches (15.2 to 30.5 cm) for an average of 4.5 hours during each instrumented mission. Instrumented missions that were conducted at temperatures of -9° to -7°F (-23° to -22°C); -17° to -15°F (-27° to -26°C); and -38° to -36°F (-39° to -38°C) were grouped, and mean stabilized temperatures were calculated. Average interior warm-up time for the NRDEC-MKT trailer temperature was 25 minutes compared to 45 minutes for the sixth ID (L) improved MKT. Temperatures at the head and hand level were slightly warmer in the NRDEC-MKT.\n\nLittle difference in foot-level temperature was noted between the two MKTs. Because of extremely low foot temperatures monitored throughout the testing in the MKTs, operating personnel were required to wear vapor barrier boots. Additionally, adequate cleaning of the MKT could not be performed during testing due to low foot-level temperatures. This caused food and grease buildup on the floor insulators and resulted in unsanitary and slippery conditions. The cold floor temperatures and slippery conditions are considered significant problems.\n\nDuring the test period, an attempt was made to determine an effective means to increase the temperature of the floor area in both MKTs. A 400,000-BTU space heater (Herman-Nelson) was vented under the MKTs with positive results. However, the 400,000-BTU space heater is not a recommended solution for heating the MKT floor. The heater starts poorly and is unreliable in the cold. In addition, it has a high fuel consumption rate and frequently requires maintenance from operator and crew.\n\nA heating trial was also performed using two M-2 burner units placed under the floor of the MKTs. This method was effective in elevating the floor temperature but constituted a safety hazard to operating personnel in the MKT. In addition, minor damage was caused to the wiring harness of the MKT because of excessive heat, even though M-2 burners were set at low levels. This method also removed one-third of the kitchen's cooking capabilities because after using two of the six M-2 burner units provided in the MKT to heat the floor, only four units were available for heating and cooking food.\n\nAfter one actual heating mission in each MKT, it was determined that excessive amounts of air entered both MKTs, and as a result, all cover assembly panels were extended 6 inches. After performance of two additional actual feeding missions in each MKT, it was noted that the doors on the end cover assemblies could not be closed properly due to fabric contraction in the cold.\n\nDuring testing of both MKTs in temperatures below -5°F (-21°C), the fabric of the roof canopy assemblies and the cover assemblies became extremely stiff. Failure of the fabric to stretch during installation of the upright poles during setup resulted in frequent damage to the roof canopy sections and made assembly of the cover tedious.3 Both MKTs had to have cover assemblies heated in a building before installation. These problems are significant as mobility of the MKT was greatly reduced.\n\nAfter testing both MKTs, it was determined that neither met the standards required for use in an extreme cold-weather environment. The Sixth Infantry Division (Light) therefore implemented other policies and procedures to ensure that soldiers are adequately fed in a field environment under extreme cold. This test encouraged the present Army doctrine that MKTs and A Rations are not to be used within the Sixth Infantry Division (Light) during the period 15 October through 15 April (U.S. Department of the Army, 1993a, b)."
