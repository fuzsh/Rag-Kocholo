        "text": "It is an honor to serve as Maryland's 34th Comptroller - and I am proud to be the state's first female Chief Fiscal Officer! I am excited to transform the Office of the Comptroller into an innovative, accessible, and more transparent state agency.\n\nAs your Comptroller, I work with nearly 1,100 employees responsible for collecting taxes and issuing refunds, preventing fraud through our state-of-the-art fraud detection system, approving or denying major state contracts at the Board of Public Works, regulating motor fuels, returning unclaimed property to rightful owners, and helping oversee our state's pension system. In addition, the agency ensures all of Maryland's dedicated state employees are paid accurately and on time.\n\nMy experience as a Civil Rights & Disability Rights attorney, a mother, and a two-term member of the General Assembly and leader on our state's fiscal, transportation, and environmental committees help inform my work and decision-making. My goal is to be your advocate - the People's Advocate - in all that I do. I look forward to working to reimagine how this agency can build more equitable, resilient, and prosperous communities throughout all of Maryland. Please keep in touch!\n\nMy best,\n\nBrooke\n\nbrooke@marylandtaxes.gov\n\nBiography of Brooke Lierman\n\nOffice of Comptroller\n\nOffice of Communications\n\nComptroller Transition\n\nComptroller Initiatives\n\nThe second Sunday of August to the following Saturday is designated as Shop Maryland Tax-Free Week each year.

The Agency has worked diligently with public and private partners to foment the adoption of financial literacy graduation requirements, new programs and course work introduced in every school district across Maryland, along with the creation of finance parks allowing students to test their knowledge in real world situations.\n\nApril is recognized as financial literacy month. Children as young as three can grasp basic fiscal concepts and by seven years old they have developed financial habits that will carry through their entire lives. It is never too early to start teaching good fiscal behavior to set up a lifetime of success for your children. Teach your children the value of a dollar. It is also never to late to learn about financial literacy and begin building a stable economic future for you and your family.
