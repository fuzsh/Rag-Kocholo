        "text": "On Tuesday evening, February 20, 2024, members of Westminster VFD and CC DFEMS St-3 B-Shift participated in a rope drill. Participants practiced knots and rigging for slope evacuations with Tower 3. Participants learned about mechanical advantage systems and how to use them in rescue scenarios.\n\nTraining continues to make sure we are ready no matter what the emergency situation presents.\n\nOur uniors held their February 2024 monthly meeting and training. The Junior Program is open to ages 12 through 16 and meets on the 2nd Monday of every month from 7 to 9pm. There is a small business meeting from 7 to 730 and training from 730 to 9. There is a different training topic each month to include hands on activities in both fire and EMS. Several of our Junior members have chosen to further their training through the Emergency Services Training Program. This program is offered as a concurrent enrollment option during their Junior or Senior year to prepare them to volunteer with their local department or start a career in the fire service.\n\nIf you would like to join our program, please email wvfd3rr@westminstervfd.org or check out our website.\n\nPhotos copyright WFD Recruitment/Retention team\n\nOn Sunday May 30, we conducted a live training evolution on Tannery Road in Westminster. Despite the cold temperatures and periodic rain, 50 firefighters and support personnel from 6 of our mutual aid companies participated in the training. We were able to conduct 18 evolutions in 5 hours, giving the participants the opportunity to expand their knowledge. Several junior members participated in the training, while they were not allowed to enter the house, they were given an opportunity to work with the hose lines from the exterior. In the fire service, there are limited opportunities for live training, so we would like to thank the owners of the property for allowing us to utilize the house on the property. To allow all members and career staff to participate, Adam County Station 20 (Alpha) from Littlestown, covered our first due area, providing emergency services to the citizens of Westminster. This training would not have been possible without the support of instructors and a Safety Officer to ensure the safety of everyone who participated. Training is a necessary part of the job and is ongoing to ensure that we provide exemplary service to the citizens of Westminster and our neighboring companies.\n\nSaturday morning – April 18, 2020 by Kevin Dayhoff Westminster Fire Department PIO and Chaplain.\n\nAn early morning two-alarm fire in a commercial building in the 1000 block of Baltimore Blvd. – Rte 140, injured one firefighter. The first call came in to the Emergency Communications Center at 2:18 a.m., for a report smoke coming from the side of building and fire being observed.\n\nUnits from Reese and Westminster fire departments were first on the scene in a steady light rain – with Reese taking command. Upon arrival firefighters preliminarily found a fire perhaps coming from the basement of the one-story commercial building. The building is reported to be under renovation.\n\nPerhaps as many as 50-75 firefighters responded from Carroll County and Baltimore County. The fire was determined to be under control at 3:57 a.m. Although units remained on scene until 5 a.m. for clean-up and the help the fire marshal’s investigation. Preliminary observations indicate extensive damage to the interior of the building.\n\nBaltimore Gas and Electric, the Maryland State Police, and the State Highway Administration also responded.\n\nOne 45-year-old volunteer firefighter with 25-years’ experience was injured fighting the fire. He was transported to Shock Trauma.\n\nAccording to a release by the Office of the Maryland State Fire Marshal, “A Reisterstown Volunteer Fire Company (firefighter) sustained minor injuries after falling through the floor.”\n\nBy mid-day on Saturday, the Reisterstown Fire Department released a statement on the department website that said, “The injured firefighter is home recovering from minor injuries. We would like to thank everyone who has reached out to check on the firefighter.”\n\nIn a phone interview later in the afternoon, Reisterstown Fire Chief Craig Hewitt said that the firefighter, “was released from Shock Trauma this morning after some tests and observation. He has returned home and is recuperating from minor injuries. He is in good spirits. He is expected to recover and be back to work soon.”\n\nThe fire remains under investigation by the Maryland State Fire Marshal’s Office.\n\nReese fire department PIO Robin Stansbury contributed to this story.\n\nWestminster Fire Company Chaplain and PIO Kevin Dayhoff December 8, 2018\n\nWestminster Fire Co.
