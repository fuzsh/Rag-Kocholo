        "text": "Catha Marie Stewart enjoys volunteering for her church service activities and UMGC alumni events. She often volunteered for the alumni fundraising telethon when it was held in Largo, Maryland, and loves helping out at UMGC commencements.\n\nShe also supports her fellow alumni at Prince Georges Community College, where she received her Associate Applied Science Degree in Forensic Science Technology. Since 2008, she has managed student and faculty administrative matters for the Weekend College Program, currently on a part-time seasonal basis.\n\nOne of Stewart’s dreams was to work for University of Maryland, College Park (UMCP). She began her career with UMCP in 2006 in the Office of Undergraduate Admissions. After earning her associate degree, she took advantage of the tuition remission program to study at UMGC, where she earned her Bachelor of Science in Investigative Forensics in 2013. Later, she completed a Leadership and Management certificate program through tuition remission.\n\nNow a program manager at UMCP, Stewart oversees administrative functions for various scientific research programs associated with the Institute for Physical Science and Technology within the College of Mathematical and Natural Sciences. She is a nominee for the 2024 Employee MVP Award for successful leadership in a postdoctoral fellowship program that awards tuition remission to students conducting research collaboratively with UMCP and advisors at the National Institutes for Health for the Partnership in Integrative Cancer Research.\n\nThroughout Stewart’s career, she has been able to pursue her educational goals by having employers pay for classes. She delights in seeing students’ academically successful outcomes from tuition benefits because she gets to witness their dreams come to fruition.\n\nStewart is a fraternal twin and a Maryland state public notary for Prince Georges County.\n\nAbigail Stabile is an MBA student, mother of two, wife, Navy Reservist, and a volunteer within her community in Guam. Her volunteer service includes working with Friends in Need once a month to provide a meal for the homeless community; assisting in the Children’s Ministry at her church; and helping at the Harvest House, an organization that supports Guam’s foster children and families. Recently, she donated backpacks for their Back2School event.\n\nIn May, Stabile volunteered to help respond to Typhoon Mawar with her unit, Defense Coordinating Element West, Guam. For more than two months, she worked closely with other organizations (such as FEMA and Army National Guard) and served as the Admin Leading Petty Officer for her unit and the J1 for the response.\n\nStabile experienced childhood trauma that she was able to escape as a teen because other family members took her in. “I could have easily been in the foster system or homeless, but I wasn't because I had someone that loved me and was willing to make sacrifices for me,” said Stabile. Seeing others care for her well-being has prompted her to be grateful for what she has, to count her blessings in life, and to give back to help others in need.\n\nMerry Meyer, an undergraduate student majoring in management studies, has a long history of volunteer service. Currently, she serves on the board of two organizations that focus on the well-being of animals—SnipWell, a vet clinic that provides spay/neuter and wellness care at a reduced cost, and the Bichon Frise Club of America, a club that promotes responsible breeding and ownership of the bichon frise dog breed. In her roles with the organizations, Meyer helps to organize fundraising and development events. She also has helped the dog rescue arm of the Bichon Frise Club as a volunteer for its events and as a foster mom for the rescues.\n\nIn addition to her dedication to animals, Meyer has served on the board of her homeowner’s association and volunteered at the local school as well as for other organizations. In her Maryland hometown, she was one of the founding members of Frederick’s Bike Night Series, a fundraiser dedicated to helping local families who are struggling with high medical costs because of serious illnesses. In her current community in Charlotte, North Carolina, she hosts an annual “Party with a Purpose” Christmas Open House to benefit the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department Explorers Toy Drive, the Loaves & Fishes Food Pantry, and SnipWell. More than 500 toys and bikes and 1,500 pounds of food— along with monetary donations and supplies for SnipWell—have been donated through this event.\n\n“Volunteering helps me connect with my community and people with similar interests and offers unique experiences,” says Meyer. “Supporting different organizations helps me discover hidden talents, broadens my skill set, and expands my network. It just feels good to help!”\n\nOctober 2022: Aaliyah El-Amin ’14\n\nAaliyah El-Amin is a proud, energetic, and passionate member of the UMGC military advising team. She started her career working as an Education Services Specialist with the U.S. Army. After almost four years, she made the decision to move to UMGC in 2012. Not only is she an exemplary employee, she is also an incredibly involved alumni volunteer.\n\nAfter coming to UMGC, El-Amin earned her Human Resource Management certificate in 2014. Over the course of the past several years, she has been an avid supporter of alumni programming through the Alumni Relations team. She has volunteered for many in-person events put on by Alumni Relations and by Career Services. Most recently she volunteered at the in-person 2022 Maryland Homecoming in Adelphi, Maryland.\n\nEl-Amin has done amazing work serving UMGC’s working adult learners. This year—2022—marks her tenth year with the university. We couldn’t be happier and more excited to have her as a colleague and active member of the UMGC alumni community.\n\nAlexandra Alexis believes in the power of celebration and helping others. During the COVID-19 pandemic, she recognized the importance of celebrating each course that took her closer to her goal. Nothing stopped her, and in May 2021 she earned her bachelor’s degree in social science from UMGC. When she heard about the UMGC Spring Grad Walk and how 2020, 2021, and 2022 graduates were invited to walk, she wanted to celebrate this milestone with her fellow graduates. Instead of walking herself, she signed up to volunteer on both Saturday and Sunday, spending her weekend welcoming new graduates to the alumni community. Alexis believes “It is important to make time to motivate and encourage others to be successful and want to accomplish so much more!”\n\n“I had a great time cheering for the new graduates. I know how much these graduates and their families have overcome to achieve this,” shares Alexis. She has also overcome challenges to achieve her education. With a focus on her passion for helping others, she returned to UMGC and is pursuing her Master of Science in Healthcare Administration for a career in healthcare.\n\n“It was not a question of whether I would be there to volunteer,” says Alexis. “Volunteering is good for the heart and soul.”\n\nKeairra Adams makes volunteering and helping others an integral part of her life. “One of the greatest gifts you can give is your time, for we can never get it back,” she said. Adams volunteers at various organizations, from her church, where she serves as an outreach ministry member, to local service organizations, where she participates in a number of events, including food drives, visits to rehab facilities, recycling initiatives, reading time at childcare centers, and women’s empowerment activities.\n\nWhile she was a student, Adams became a member of multiple honor societies, and she has given back to them by volunteering to serve on their scholarship committees. Most recently, she participated in the fall 2021 induction ceremonies for UMGC’s chapter of Alpha Sigma Lambda, the premier honor society for adult students in higher education.\n\nAs a recent alumna of UMGC, Adams signed up to mentor new students in 2015, helping them adjust to the university and checking in on them throughout the term. She continued to help students until the mentoring program ended in 2016. She has also volunteered for UMGC’s annual virtual career fair.\n\nAdams said, “My favorite quote is ‘Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful committed individuals can change the world. In fact, it's the only thing that ever has.’ I aspire to be one of these world-changing individuals and pray that I've blessed at least one person in my years of volunteer service. It is my sincere honor and pleasure to continue forevermore.”\n\nAs a child, Barbara Archer learned firsthand what it is to rely on the kindness of others. She now feels fortunate that she was able to overcome the obstacles she faced to support herself and her children but is aware that not all people have had the same privileges she had. Therefore, Archer takes on volunteer roles when she has the opportunity in hopes of helping others.\n\nFor the past year, Archer has served as the executive chair of the UMGC Student Advisory Council. As chair, Archer plans and leads the monthly meetings, coordinates with UMGC staff, and communicates with fellow students. She hopes that she can make a difference in advocating and being the voice for the student body. She has also participated on the development committee for a new mental health advocacy student organization.\n\nIn 2000, Archer acted as the chaplain at a correctional facility. As chaplain, her main duties were to administer, supervise, and perform work in a program of spiritual welfare and religious guidance for inmates.\n\nWhen asked, “How can one person open the door for someone else?” Archer said, “We all walk unique paths, and our own experiences shape how we view the world. You may think of yourself as an underdog, but just think how you can use your sphere of influence to help the next underdog be successful.”\n\nArcher is pursuing a bachelor’s degree in legal studies in the hope of one day becoming an attorney so that she can continue to help others in a new role.\n\nWhen Rachel Jones heard about the ARISS (Amateur Radio on the International Space Station) program with NASA, she embarked on a yearlong project to help local students participate. Her efforts included reaching out to schools, completing an application, designing a curriculum, teaching students, and coordinating a large-scale event. She also coordinated with local radio clubs to ensure that they had the technology needed to communicate with the International Space Station.\n\nThroughout the year, Jones helped the students learn about various STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) topics. “As a STEM mentor, I understand the importance of establishing a love of science at a young age,” Jones said.\n\nAs a result of her efforts, ten students from Savannah River Academy in Georgia were able to talk to an astronaut on the International Space Station on December 10, 2021. More than 200 people attended the event in person, and—thanks to Jones’s coordination with the local community—more than 2,000 others were able to watch the live stream.\n\nJones feels that her experience was well worth the hard work. “If there was one thing I learned from this experience, it's to make others tell you ‘no’ rather than stop yourself from trying,” says Jones. “Savannah River Academy was a small school . . . , but we developed a program and put forth an application. We didn't let the size of our community stop us from trying. Together I think we accomplished something amazing.”\n\nJones worked on the project while also pursuing her own studies in the computer networking and cybersecurity program at UMGC.\n\nOctober 2021: Matthew Gossett, Current Student\n\nMatthew Gossett is about to complete his bachelor's degree with an English major and Asian studies minor in December 2021. When he is not working on his classes or completing his military duties, he is an avid volunteer within his community.\n\nSince joining the Air Force in 2004, Gossett has enjoyed using his unique position to help people when he sees the chance. He has been a member of his local Air Force Sergeants Association and the Awards Committee leader. His team organized the annual POW/MIA remembrance run at their base and ensured that the POW/MIA flag moved around the base track for 24 hours straight. His efforts allowed his team to win the 2020 division-level Legislation Chapter of the Year Award.\n\nGossett aids in the professional development of his fellow noncommissioned officers and has been a leader in the E5/E6 ranks for many years. He was secretary of his unit E5/E6 organization at his last base. When he moved to another location and learned his unit did not have such an organization, he was able to bring together a team and build a program for his unit. They held their first elections in July.\n\n\"I volunteer because I enjoy helping people. Nobody is perfect; we all need help with something,\" shares Gossett. \"I've been lucky to have been presented opportunities that allow me to be active in my community.
