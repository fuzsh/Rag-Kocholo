        "text": "Volunteers Needed\n\nOur volunteer program attracts people from all walks of life from college students to retired professionals. When asked why they volunteer at the Winter Park Police Department the main reasons given by the volunteers were:\n\nTo get involved in the community\n\nTo give something back to the community\n\nTo help the police\n\nTo enhance or update job skills and experience\n\nWhile the Winter Park Police Department strives to keep up with the increased pace of service to the community within budgetary constraints, it is vital to use all possible resources. Volunteers, by the very nature of the term, want to get involved and give something back to the community. They are as loyal to the organization as those who are employed by it.\n\nNon-sworn personnel often perform duties just as effectively as a sworn member of the agency. This allows more officers to be in the community on patrol and responding to calls for service.\n\nWe are also exploring the concept of volunteers writing and publishing various newsletters on a bi-monthly schedule, and other duties as they become available. Volunteers with the Winter Park Police Department are utilized based on the constantly changing demands made on our work force, coupled with a new, state-of-the-art police facility and annexations of areas into the city limits. Numerous possibilities are on the horizon and together our volunteers and staff will enjoy the experience of reaching them.\n\nPossible duties of a volunteer can include:\n\nClerical work\n\nGreeting the public\n\nTelephone inquiries and transferring calls for service to the appropriate division\n\nBasic data entry\n\nMaintaining and organizing files and records\n\nOperating a photocopier, printer, calculator, facsimile, typewriter, and telephone system\n\nTimes needed for volunteers are Monday through Friday between the hours of 8 a.m. and 5 p.m.\n\nFor information regarding the Volunteer Program at the Winter Park Police Department, please contact Master Police Officer Javier Rodriguez at 407-599-3507 or jrodriguez@cityofwinterpark.org.\n\nAdditionally, you may submit the following online intern/volunteer application."
