        "text": "Waco Branch conflict between the U.S. government and the branch davidians was took place on April 19, 1993. It was continued for fifty-one days in Waco Texas. Davidians are the members of the branch davidian and the lender was David Koresh. He was born in Houston, Texas in 1959. According to me the conflict between U.S government and branch davidians was handled appropriately. The tragic fire that took place was because of the weapons and other gun material. In some articles it is said that he was running a religious group but, it was just for show off. What the followers and David were doing behind this curtain of lye and false was discovered by the ATF agents when they raid the compound they were having the search warrant for investigation\n\nThis article I chosen about crime is an interesting one. It’s not an ordinary crime that you would see on television such as gang war murder, murder in general, robbery, you get the gist. This man is actually a suspected Nazi Commander of a SS-led Ukrainian Self Defense Legion unit that burned down Polish villages and killed innocent civilians in Poland in 1944. Michael Karkoc, 98, currently living in Minneapolis, Minnesota was recently suspected as a commander of a Schutzstaffel unit, a paramilitary organization that is notorious for executing many many innocent civilians. Evidence was collected for several years by Polish investigators. Various evidences showed Karkoc is a suspected commander of the Ukrainian Self Defense Legion, “based on wartime documents, testimony from other members of the unit and Karkoc's own Ukrainian-language memoir”. Germany conducted their own investigation and concluded that they do have enough evidence to bring him to trial but decided not to since Karkoc is unfit for trial due to health purposes. In this unique case, this crime that was acted by suspected Michael Karkoc, a SS commander of the Ukrainian Self Defense Legion unit was purely\n\nHe was in the Persian Gulf war and he was a great soldier. Most of his teammates thought he was a great soldier. He was so good so he “joined the !st Infantry Division and soon became a sergeant and gunner on a Bradley Fighting Vehicle” (“From”). He was devoted soldier even though in high school he was called “Noodle Mcveigh” because he was a tall and skinny man. When he went to the war, he was greatest in his group. He received a lot of medals. He wanted to try out of the special forces but drop out because he was not prepared. After army, he did not stay in one state. He would go to a lot of gun show where he buy them and collect them. Before he joined the army his childhood was not great. His mother was never home, and at the end his parents got a divorce. His mother went to Florida with his sisters. He met some friends in the army. Which “all three shared a bond of the love of guns and anger at the government they believed was trying to take away their right and weapons” (“From”). His rage started to get bigger. He got his and he fill people with terror. They did whatever Mcveigh told him to do Nichols did not want to help him anymore because he begin thinking about his family. McVeigh did not have anybody or anything to lose, that is why he did not\n\nOn May 24th 1988 Timothy took a huge step to fulfill his dream of becoming a member of the United States Special Forces. In Basic training McVeigh met an individual named Terry Nichols, Nichols was much older than most of the recruits and held his own pretty well. McVeigh and Nichols became close friends and even got stationed at Fort Riley Kansas Together. Kifner, John. (1995). Terry Nichols was one of the master minds behind the attack of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. As stated by former FBI agent \"These two are birds of a feather. Each feeds off the other 's inadequacies.\" McVeigh and Nichols would later deploy to Iraq to fight in the Gulf War where McVeigh served as a Bradley Gunner. During his time in Iraq McVeigh was awarded the combat Infantry badge and a bronze star. Kifner, (1995).\n\nAl Qaeda began with the recruitment of members of the Afghan army who Osama met and perceived to be obedient and loyal. The goal of the organization was to create one unified Islamic State and to spread the jihadist cause throughout the world. Al Qaeda claimed “responsibility for killing tourists in Egypt, and in 1998 they bombed the U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Tanzania, killing nearly 300 people in the process” (“Osama bin Laden”). However, Osama did not expect the U.S. to have their own team of specialists. Seal Team 6 was developed as “a counterterrorist team that could operate under the utmost secrecy” (Minute Help Guides 6). Hybrids between soldier and spy, Seal Team 6 is “one of the nation’s most mythologized, most secretive\n\nAn unfamiliar word in the book, Rifles for Watie, was the word infantry. The text on page 159 states, “As Jeff tramped along with the infantry on the road from Three Forks to Tahlequah, he took a long pull of the pine scented morning air.” I figured out that the words ‘along with the’, was giving a hint to the reader that the infantry is some group of people. With those clue words, I can tell that this word is a noun. Since this book is during the Civil War, I would infer that the infantry has something to do with a group of soldiers. I looked up the word, so I could find a the real definition. I found the word, infantry means ‘soldiers marching or fighting on foot; foot soldiers collectively'. There is a word in infantry, which is infant.\n\nThe Waco siege ended 22 years ago in a colossal fire that ended up killed 76 people including two pregnant women and over 20 children. The siege began on February 28, 1993, when the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) attempted to execute a search warrant at Mount Carmel Center ranch, a property held by religious group Branch Davidians in Waco, Texas (leppard, 2013). The government suspected a radical religious leader David Koresh of stock piling firearms and manufacturing drugs. The raid rose into an intense gun fight that last lasted two hours with the result four agents and six Davidians killed in action. The FBI then launched a long-term assault while attempting to negotiate with Koresh and force him to surrender the ranch. The siege ended on April 19, 50 days after the primary raid, when the FBI sprung a final assault against Koresh. Three fires broke out in the building, killing 76 men, women, and children, including sect leader Koresh. A total of 82 people died as a result of the Waco siege (Leppard, 2013).\n\nApril 19, 1995 marked the worst terrorist attack on United States soil until the fatal September 11, attack. The truck-bomb explosion outside the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City , Oklahoma left 168 people dead, which included 19 children that were in the buildings daycare center at the time, more than 500 injured along with the damage of 300 buildings in the surrounding area. The attack was spearheaded by Timothy McVeigh, along with his co-partner Terry Nichols and to a lesser degree, Michael and Lori Fortier. The attack was in retaliation to other incidents, one at Ruby Ridge Idaho, and the other at Waco Texas. Both were raids by the government on militia or religious fanatics. Civilians were killed in both these actions\n\nOn April 19th, 1995 a homemade bomb made of a concoction of agricultural fertilizer, fuel, and other dangerous chemicals was left in a truck parked outside the Alfred P. Murrah Federal building in Oklahoma City. At 9:02 in the morning, it’s blast damaged over 300 buildings surrounding the vehicle and even flattened a third of the federal building. (Strom, 2015) The bomb took the lives of 168 people, including 19 children. It was found that two men, Timothy McVeigh and Terry Lynn Nichols were the ones who planted the device. Both men were found to be associated with a radical militia movement that sought revenge for a siege in Waco, Texas two years prior. The siege killed 82 Branch Davidians, of whom, multiple were related to the militia movement."
