        "text": "About Blue UAS\n\nThe ever evolving development of commercial UAS can benefit DoD and government users as commercial systems are updated and improved on a far faster timeline than traditional Programs of Record (POR). The Blue UAS effort, started in 2020, is a holistic and continuous approach that rapidly vets and scales commercial unmanned aerial system (UAS) technology for the Department of Defense (DoD). This program consists of two lines of effort that curate, maintain and improve a robust roster of policy approved commercial UAS to meet the diverse needs of DoD users. The military applications of these systems become more apparent each day through observation of their tactical capabilities in contested battle spaces.\n\nPolicy compliant commercial UAS, once vetted by the Blue UAS On-Ramp effort, do not require an Exception to Policy (ETP), reducing the administrative burden on end users. The Blue UAS program is not an exclusive path for government validation of UAS as POR and ETP is a valid means of acquisition. However, it is built with the intention of being the fastest and most cost effective method available for sUAS to be purchased within DoD. Blue UAS listing does not preclude the Government from purchasing any other UAS that are certified compliant by the purchasing Government organization. DIU does not define Government sUAS compliance standards or provide sUAS security or drone certification for such other efforts.\n\nAll Blue UAS platforms and components are in compliance with the law as it existed at time of original examination and are in compliance at present with any changes since the original examination.\n\nBlue UAS Cleared List\n\nA list of DoD approved drones providing options for the evolving mission needs of government users. These drones are compliant with section 848 of the FY20 NDAA , section 817 of the FY23 NDAA, and the American Security Drone Act, validated as cyber-secure and safe to fly, and are available for government purchase and operation. It Includes sUAS platforms both commercial and bespoke.\n\nBlue UAS Framework\n\nInteroperable, NDAA compliant UAS components and software that provide options for Government and industry partners. The Framework provides advanced capabilities to sUAS developers and reduces risk for government customers. It includes critical components, sub-components, modules & software for use in DoD applications.\n\nAdditional background\n\nThe first Blue sUAS project developed trusted, policy compliant small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) for the broader Department of Defense (DoD) and Federal Government partners. This effort builds upon the U.S. Army’s sUAS program of record, Short Range Reconnaissance (SRR), for an inexpensive, rucksack portable, vertical take-off and landing sUAS. These systems share the SRR air vehicles' capabilities but integrate a vendor provided ground control system.\n\nThe next iteration of Blue UAS expanded the variety and capabilities of DIU vetted drones to provide DoD users compliant, secure sUAS. These systems were selected to include a variety of sizes, capabilities, price points, and flight modalities. Each system has undergone a cyber vulnerability assessment in accordance with the Risk Management Framework, is issued an associated Authority to Operate by DIU, and a FY20 Section 848 NDAA compliance check. Additionally, we are introducing the systems to the service level airworthiness organizations to accelerate approvals.\n\nThis effort also proves out a repeatable administrative onboarding process called “Blue UAS On-Ramp” designed to reduce barriers to entry for commercial sUAS and create a more permissive acquisition process for DoD customers. More systems will be added to the roster soon."
