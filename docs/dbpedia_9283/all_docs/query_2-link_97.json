        "text": "This is Passport to Texas\n\nTexas Independence Day is March 2. And Washington on the Brazos is where it all started.\n\nThis town was chosen as the site of the general convention, which met on March 1, 1836, and adjourned on March 17.\n\nJanice Campbell, an interpreter at Washington-on-the-Brazos State Historic Site, says those seventeen days in 1836, paved the way for Texas future.\n\nIn those seventeen days, the elected delegates that came here, they declared their independence from Mexico; they wrote a constitution; and they elected some officers for a government. So, I guess you could say the groundwork of the government of the Republic of Texas was created right here in Washington.\n\nCampbell says one cannot help but feel a deep connection to the past when visiting Washington-on-the-Brazos.\n\nIt’s pretty awesome to be able to walk out there, and walk along the main thoroughfare of the town and know that we are walking in the footsteps of history…right here in Washington.\n\nWashington-on-the-Brazos SHS plans to celebrate Texas’ independence the last weekend in February. We’ll tell you about the festivities tomorrow.\n\nIt will mark the 174 anniversary of the signing of the Texas declaration of Independence.\n\nFind details about this and other state park events on the Texas Parks and Wildlife website.\n\nThat’s our show… For Texas Parks and Wildlife…I’m Cecilia Nasti."
