We will be conducting quill pen writing, frontier kids games, and a very small contingent of the Texian Army demonstrating black powder rifles and muskets. Kids are more than welcome and can participate in the quill pen and frontier games events. If you live near Navasota, TX, these events are worth coming to see, along with the Museum, the Living History Farm, and the Hall. Washington was the site of the signing of the Texas Declaration of Independence and is a very important historical site.\n\nWOB will present History Saturday (3rd Saturday of every month) at Independence Hall at WOB on April 21.
