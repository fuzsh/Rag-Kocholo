        "text": "You Thought Texas Always Had a Capital? Think Again, Y'all!\n\nAh, Texas. The land of wide-open spaces, ten-gallon hats, and... uh... what was the capital again? Hold your horses (or should we say longhorns?), because the story of Texas' capital is more dramatic than a rodeo clown getting chased by a bull.\n\nFrom Humble Beginnings to Musical Chairs: A Capital Cavalcade\n\nTexas has a rich and, well, let's just say interesting, history when it comes to its capital city. It wasn't always the vibrant Austin we know today. Buckle up, because we're about to take a whirlwind tour of Texas' capital confusion.\n\nPre-Republic Texas: Musical Chairs with Mexico – Back in the day, Texas was part of Mexico. Now, Mexico wasn't big on playing favorites, so the capital kept bouncing around like a tumbleweed in a dust storm. We're talking Monclova, Los Adaes (which is now in Louisiana, by the way!), and even San Antonio all had their turn holding the crown.\n\nThe Republic of Texas: A Capitalist's (Almost) Nightmare – Then, in 1836, Texas declared independence from Mexico. You'd think they'd pick a capital and stick with it, right? Wrong! These independent Texans were apparently allergic to commitment. Washington-on-the-Brazos, Harrisburg, and even Velasco all had brief stints as capital before things got really interesting.\n\nColumbia: The \"First, But Not Last\" Capital – Finally, in 1836, Columbia (nowadays known as West Columbia) became the first capital of the elected government of the Republic of Texas. Hold onto your hats, though, because this party only lasted a few months.\n\nHouston: Houston, We Have a Capital (For a While) – President Sam Houston (yes, that Sam Houston) wasn't a fan of Columbia, so he moseyed on over to Houston and declared it the new capital in 1837. At least Houston got a decent run of it, lasting a whole two years!\n\nAustin: The Lone Star State Finally Settles Down (Ish)\n\nThankfully, in 1839, some sanity prevailed. The capital was moved to Austin, named after Stephen F. Austin, the \"Father of Texas.\" There were a few hiccups along the way (including a whole incident known as the \"Archive War\" that involved citizens literally wrestling government documents away from troops – you can't make this stuff up!), but Austin has held onto the capital title ever since."
