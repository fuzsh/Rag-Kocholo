        "text": "Overview\n\nLack of understanding of basic vocabulary is one of the most common obstacles to understanding new content that we see in the classroom. This applies for all students but is especially important for students with various learning needs. Students will use the Vocabulary Discovery to complete either the Vocabulary Graphic Organizer or the Vocabulary Graphic Organizer Modified. Choose the organizer that best meets the needs of your students.\n\nThis activity is meant to be an introduction activity to the vocabulary words students will see throughout the Revolution Unit. When students have an opportunity to make their own connections there is a higher chance that they will actually remember the meaning of the word. Images and Definitions provided in the Vocabulary Discovery slideshow."
