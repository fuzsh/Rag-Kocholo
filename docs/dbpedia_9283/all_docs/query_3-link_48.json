They do have a donation box which I recommend putting a few dollars into - most parks (at least where I'm from in California) charge at least $5 just to park your car in a park!\n\nThere are some museums on site which require paid admission, but prices seemed very reasonable.They also offer tours for history buffs who want to know everything there is to know about the birthplace of Texas. \n\nThe people working were incredibly nice and helpful. We followed the trail they suggested and saw some beautiful wildflowers, including bluebonnets!\n\nKnow before you go: wear closed toed shoes (the path is gravel perfectly sized for getting stuck in sandals) and bring mosquito repellent! There were a lot of butterflies and other insects flying around, which is good if you are into butterflies, and terrifying if you hate things flying around your face.\n\nMuch of the trail is exposed and it was quite toasty so I'd also recommend bringing sunscreen, a hat, and water.\n\nSigns indicate that dogs are allowed on the trails, although we didn't see any.\n\nThe one disappointment: the independence building is a reconstruction of what the original might have been like - not the remains of the real one.\"",
