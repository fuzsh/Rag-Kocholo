        "text": "Marker Text: The frontier village was the setting for the convention that on March 2, 1836, wrote and signed the immortal Texas declaration of Independence. In the first capital of the Republic of Texas, the constitution was drawn, the government organized. However, Washington was a target for Santa Anna's army, and on March 17 the government had to flee. After the Texas victory at San Jacinto, April 21, 1836, Washington was again proposed as capital, but Houston was selected instead. In 1842, the Republic's government returned to Washington and remained here during the term of Anson Jones, fourth and last president of Texas. Anson Jones, native of Massachusetts, in 1833 had come to Texas, where he at once began the practice of his profession, medicine. At the Battle of San Jacinto, in the Texas Revolution, he took the field as surgeon of the 2nd Regiment. Later he served in the Texas Congress, was minister to the United States, Secretary of State, a senator, and finally the president from 1844 to 1846. Upon annexation of Texas to the United States, Dr. Jones retired to Barrington, his plantation near Washington. He died in Houston on January 9., 1858>\n\nMarker No: 8404 (This marker was removed during road works, it is very similar to another one by the same name through the text was likely different)\n\nAluminum 27 x 42 Subject Marker\n\nGeographic:"
