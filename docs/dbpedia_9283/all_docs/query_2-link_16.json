        "text": "Washington-on-the-Brazos is a historic site located on the banks of the Brazos River in Texas. This site holds significant importance as it was here that the Republic of Texas was proclaimed in 1836, marking a pivotal moment in the history of Texas. Visitors to this site can learn about the events that led to the formation of the Republic of Texas and the role this location played in shaping the state's history.\n\nSite Features and Attractions\n\nThe State of Texas acquired approximately 202,000 mÂ² of land at the original site of Washington-on-the-Brazos in 1916. A replica of the building where the delegates had met was constructed on this land, providing visitors with a glimpse into the past. Additional land was acquired in 1976 and 1996, expanding the site. Located between Brenham and Navasota, off Texas State Route 105, the site also includes a museum and a library, offering tourists a comprehensive understanding of the history of the area."
