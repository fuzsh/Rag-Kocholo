Telephone: 936-662-5838.\n\nExcept for the Independence Day celebration every year, all stated meetings of Washington Lodge #18 are held quarterly at The Navasota #299 Lodge Room at 300 E. Washington Avenue in Navasota Texas.\n\nThe stated meetings for the next year are planned to be held quarterly on the first month of each quarter:\n\nJuly 26, 2023\n\nOctober 25, 2023\n\nJanuary 31, 2024\n\nApril 24, 2024\n\nJuly 31, 2024\n\nExcept for the March 2nd meeting every year which meets at Washington-on-the-Brazos, Washington Lodge #18 meets quarterly in the Masonic lodge room on the second floor of the historic Miller Theater in Navasota, Texas.\n\nWashington Lodge #18\n\nWhere Texas History and Masonry Come Together.\n\nWashington Lodge #18 of the Masonic Grand Lodge of Texas A. F. & A. M. is the Masonic lodge chartered at Washington, Texas during the Republic of Texas on January 11, 1844. It ceased to be a working lodge in 1887 when it surrendered its charter. Washington Lodge #18 was restored by the Grand Lodge of Texas in 2004.\n\nWashington, Texas was a center of government and Masonic activities during the Republic of Texas. On March 2, 1836, Texas declared its independence from Mexico at Washington and the Declaration of Independence was signed there. Therefore, Washington is referred to as the \"Birthplace of Texas.\" At various times, the capitol of the Republic of Texas was at Washington. The Grand Lodge of the Republic of Texas held its annual meetings at Washington in 1843, 1844 and 1845. Click here to see The Proceedings of the Grand Lodge of Texas 1837-1857. Today, the town of Washington is commonly referred to as Washington-on-the-Brazos.\n\nA few years ago this historic Masonic Lodge was re-chartered. The members of Washington Lodge #18 are very proud of their history and open lodge every year on Texas Independence Day, March 2, in the Convention Hall at Washington-on-the-Brazos on the very spot where Texas declared her independence from Mexico in 1836. Most of the members of Washington Lodge #18 are associate members who enjoy the history of Texas and Texas Masonry.

Brother Asa Brigham was the only man to assist in the successful founding of Masonry in Texas and the successful founding of the Republic of Texas.\n\nBrigham met under the Masonic Oak with a handful of other Masonic brethren in 1835 to petition the Grand Lodge of Louisiana for a Masonic lodge at Brazoria, Texas. Brigham also signed the Texas Declaration of Independence from Mexico at Washington, Texas on March 2, 1836. Brother Arnold Langston of Washington Lodge #18 researched the history, designed the marker and led the ceremony. Among those in attendance for the ceremony was Grand Master T. E. \"Gene\" Carnes of the Grand Lodge of Texas. March 2, 2011 was the 175th anniversary of the signing of the Texas Declaration of Independence.\n\nASA BRIGHAM\n\nALCALDE OF BRAZORIA MUNICIPALITY, 1835\n\nSIGNER OF THE TEXAS DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE, 1836\n\nAUDITOR OF THE REPUBLIC [OF TEXAS], 1836\n\nTREASURER OF THE REPUBLIC [OF TEXAS] 1836-1840 AND 1841-44\n\nBORN IN MASSACHUSETTS 1790\n\nDIED IN WASHINGTON, TEXAS JULY 22, 1844\n\nErected by the State of Texas 1936\n\nAsa Brigham\n\nAlcalde of Brazoria\n\nOne of 20 who planned the Battle of Velasco June 25, 1832\n\nSigner of petition to start the first Masonic Lodge in Texas\n\nat Brazoria from the Grand Lodge of Louisiana March 1835\n\nWashington Lodge #18 Project\n\nRepublic of Texas Era Masonic Aprons\n\nExamples of lodge aprons that will be presented for consideration for adoption by the membership of Washington Lodge #18 at the July 26, 2023 meeting. Once adopted, these unique lodge aprons will only be available to the members of Washington Lodge #18. The apron will exemplify and celebrate the history of Texas, Washington-on-the-Brazos (where the Texas of Declaration of Independence was signed in 1836), and of Washington Lodge #18, (a lodge originally chartered by the Grand Lodge of the Republic of Texas).\n\nBrother Don Pugh Identified this Masonic Apron as Belonging to the Palmer/Parmer Clan that Arrived in Texas in 1825\n\nMasonic Apron Worn by Brother Thomas Palmer Who Arrived in Texas in 1825\n\nMasonic Apron Belonging to Caleb Lynn Spencer\n\nA Possible Alternative Would be a Masonic Apron With a Less Crowded and Less Expensive Design such as a Star with the Square and Compasses Similar to the Lodge's Current Logo\n\nOver the past several years, Washington Lodge #18 of the Masonic Grand Lodge of Texas A. F. & A. M. has been gathering information regarding Republic of Texas era Masonic approns in an effort to recreate a period-authentic apron to be worn by members of Washington Lodge #18 during the annual meetings of the Lodge on Texas Independence Day every year. This meeting is conducted in Independence Hall at Washington-on-the-Brazos at the site where the Delegates of Texas declared Texas independent from Mexico on March 2, 1836, at the exact spot Where Texas Became Texas.\n\nIn an effort to design the most most period-authentic apron possible, we have searched many different sources. It appears that linen or silk was the most common material that the aprons were made of during the period and most were hand-painted. There are also a number of similar emblematic Masonic elements seen in each of the examples shown above.\n\nBrothers Seth Hudson and Kameron Searle are both working on the committee to propose a design for an official apron for the Lodge that will be historically accurate to the period of the 1840's and would very much appreciate your help. If you have a Republic of Texas era Masonic apron (worn by an ancestor or not), we would appreciate a scan of it. We would also be glad to include scans of period-authentic aprons as additional examples on this site. Also, if you have historical expertise regarding American Masonic aprons of the 1840's or earlier, we would also appreciate very much hearing from you.
