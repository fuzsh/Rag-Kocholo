        "text": "Print Page\n\nAt the Convention of 1836, a group of delegates gathered at Independence Hall to formally declare independence from Mexico. The delegates adopted the Texas Declaration of Independence on March 2, wrote the state constitution, and began building an ad interim government for the Republic of Texas. \"Independence Hall at Washington-on-the-Brazos\" is popularly believed to depict this historic meeting of the delegates; however, art historians differ in opinion about the identity of the building shown on the canvas, as well as the artist who completed it. The painting was first exhibited in New Orleans on May 1, 1852, but the title was likely added in the late 1860s as Texans did not refer to the town of Washington as \"Washington-on-the-Brazos\" until after the Civil War."
