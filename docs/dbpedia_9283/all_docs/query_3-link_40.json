        "text": "WASHINGTON COUNTY, Texas (KBTX) - March 2nd is Texas Independence Day.\n\n188 years ago, settlers in Mexican Texas declared independence from Mexico, creating the Republic of Texas.\n\nBack on March 2nd, 1836, 59 delegates signed the Declaration of Independence, officially proclaiming independence from Mexico, and creating the Republic of Texas.\n\nAdam Arnold, an educator at Independence Hall says the 59 elected men met in Washington to discuss Texas’ future.\n\n“The delegates that were chosen here are chosen because they agree with independence,” said Arnold. “The men came here and intended to be here three months but the convention would only last 17 days. During that time, they would adopt a declaration, draft a constitution, and form a temporary or interim government to see us through the war,” said Arnold.\n\nThe Washington-on-the-Brazos State Historic Site is where the Declaration of Independence was officially signed. The lead interpreter at Washington on the Brazos, Tynan Shadle, says it’s exciting to be on site where the signing happened.\n\n“I think for visitors it’s really awesome to say this is where it happened and we are standing on this spot on the day and so I think that’s the most exciting thing about the day,” said Shadle. “The Texas identity was forged here at Washington-on-the-Brazos when independence was declared from Mexico. I think that is a very important thing, I think that it’s very important to our visitors, and it makes an experience like this on the day it happened that much better,” said Shadle.\n\nThe historic site is celebrating Saturday with a gun salute, chili cook-off, Sons of the Republic of Texas Ceremony, and the Navasota High School band also performed.\n\n“There’s nothing more Texas than chili, and so that was a great way to celebrate Texas’ birthday,” said Shadle.\n\nThere was also a ceremony at the Independence Hall where a laying of the wreath took place at the children’s monument, the Declaration of Independence was cited out loud, and a volunteer read a poem dedicated to the 59 members who signed the declaration.\n\nVisitors could even sign their name on a copy of the Declaration of Independence outside of Independence Hall to be a part of the celebration."
