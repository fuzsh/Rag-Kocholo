        "text": "1826\n\nDec. 21 – The Declaration of Independence of the republic of Fredonia is signed at Nacogdoches. This so-called Fredonian Rebellion is an attempt by empresario Haden Edwards to separate his colony from Mexico. The rebels flee when approached by Mexican troops on Jan. 31, 1827.\n\n1829\n\nSept. 15 – Mexico abolishes slavery. Texas is given an exemption after protests.\n\nOctober – The first of several large groups of Irish immigrants arrive to settle in South Texas.\n\n1830\n\nApril 6 – The Mexican government passes a law stopping legal immigration into Texas from the United States except in special cases, banning further introduction of slaves, and establishing custom houses to collect tariffs. Relations between Anglo settlers and the Mexican government deteriorate.\n\n1831\n\nJohann Friedrich Ernst, his wife and five children are the first German family to arrive in Texas, settling in present-day Austin County. Ernst writes a long letter to a friend in Germany describing Texas as an earthly Eden. The letter is widely circulated, persuading a small but steady stream of German families to migrate to southeastern Texas.\n\n1832\n\nJune 10 – Texan insurgents upset with the Law of 1830 occupy buildings at Anahuac. Mexican military fire on the Texans. The conflict results in five Mexican soldiers and one Texan killed.\n\nJune 26 – Texans, transporting a cannon from Brazoria to Anahuac, are challenged by Mexican forces at Velasco. The Mexicans surrender after losing five men. The Texans lose 10 men from the battle.\n\nAug. 2 – Texan insurgents at Nacogdoches attack Mexican military. Mexican forces lose 47 men, while four Texans died from the battle. Some 300 Mexican soldiers are taken prisoner and marched to San Antonio where they are discharged.\n\nOct. 1-6 – Stephen F. Austin heads a convention at San Felipe de Austin seeking statehood separate from Coahuila and exemptions for Texas of tariffs and certain Mexican laws. The resolutions were never presented to Mexican government.\n\n1833\n\nApril 1 – A second convention at San Felipe de Austin reiterates the petitions of the Convention of 1832 and frames a proposed constitution for the new state of Texas.\n\nJuly – Stephen F. Austin goes to Mexico City to discuss reforms. The trip results in his arrest without any charges. He was held until August 1835 when he returned to Texas.\n\n1834\n\nJanuary – As Mexican authorities fear that Texas was about to secede or revolt, Col. Juan Nepomuceno Almonte is dispatched to Texas to make an accurate inspection and to promise reforms to gain time.\n\nMarch – Texas is granted more representation in the state government, trial by jury is introduced, and English is authorized as a second language.\n\nApril – President Antonio López de Santa Anna suspends the Mexican Constitution of 1824 and assumes dictatorial powers.\n\n1835\n\nJune – At Fort Anahuac another dispute results in the arrests of Andrew Briscoe and DeWitt Clinton Harris.

The voters also overwhelmingly approve a referendum requesting annexation by the United States. U.S. President Martin Van Buren refuses to consider it, however, citing fear of war with Mexico and constitutional scruples.\n\nOctober – The first Congress of the Republic of Texas convenes at Columbia. The Constitution of the Republic under which it was elected had been adopted in March at Washington-on-the-Brazos.
