This brought to an end the pre-Roman period during which Turdetan Cordoba had served as the main economic, urban, cultural, and territorial nucleus of the middle Guadalquivir Valley. Situated in the heart of Tartessos, at the exact point where the two Tartessic domains of the Guadalquivir and Guadiana valleys meet in the Sierra Morena mountain range, Cordoba embarked upon a long historical process with Rome that would continue from antiquity to the Middle Ages until the al-Andalus period. An intermediate time links these two realities, late antiquity and the Visigoth period, which were of enormous importance for the future of the city. Due to its privileged location on the banks of the Guadalquivir River, as well as its important land and river connections, rich metalliferous deposits in the heart of the sierra, fertile countryside, and strategic position, Corduba had been a distinguished and much desired city since the Tartessic period during the final stage of the Bronze Age. With the foundation of Corduba, the Romans ensured their military control and defence of the riches and waterways between the plateau and the sea in the southernmost part of the Iberian Peninsula. Roman Corduba, next to the old Tartessic city, undoubtedly provided a stronghold for the Romanization of a Baetica that, possessing a literary tradition of more than 6,000 years according to Strabo, quickly and easily embraced Latin to the point of almost forgetting the ancestral linguistic origins of its inhabitants within a very short time. The Romanization of Baetica was possible thanks to the mutual interest and benefit gained by both the Hispanic and Roman nobility: some prospered and promoted themselves, while others negotiated and gained power from their land holdings and the multiple resources they offered. This social phenomenon was similar to what Cordoba would experience eight and a half centuries later when the Arabs settled in the city and adapted its name as Qurṭuba. The coexistence of the Visigoth nobility with the incoming Umayyad rulers initiated a new historical process in which the Romanization of Hispania and its incorporation into the lands of the Roman Empire, deeply marked by the Germanic invasions in the 5th century, would continue in part in the Umayyad al-Andalus, although now with a different model of production in which the process of Arabization, led by the recently established state, would open a new chapter in the city’s history.\n\nviii\n\npreface\n\nIn October 711, the freedman Mughīth gained control over Cordoba, and in 716 the city became the center of power in al-Andalus. Although immersed in complex political struggles and intrigues that were kindled, among other things, by ethnic differences, the Umayyad Cordoba saw a time of great glory, first during the two stages of the Cordoban emirate: the dependent emirate of the Caliphate of Damascus (714–756) and the independent emirate of the new Abbasid Caliphate (756–912). This double emirate period would lead to the culminating stage in the city’s history, the caliphate, which although brief—it lasted just over half a century (929–1031)—would bring Cordoba to its height of splendour during the Middle Ages and beyond. After the fall of the Caliphate of Cordoba, the city began a progressive decline during the Taifa and African dynasties, first under the Almoravids and then under the Almohads. In 1236, the city fell into the hands of the King of Castile, Ferdinand iii the Saint, thus marking the beginning of the slow agony of al-Andalus. This volume brings together 19 contributions by recognized specialists in various fields of the history and culture of Roman, late antique, Visigoth, and al-Andalus Cordoba and is divided into two parts. The first part, dedicated to the Roman, late antique, and Visigoth Corduba, includes five chapters that deal with the destruction and disfigurement of the classical city and the starting point of the late antique one (Márquez and Monterroso-Checa); politics, society, and the economy during late antiquity (Panzram); the disperse situation in the Visigoth period (Sánchez-Medina); the architecture of the cities from the 4th to the 7th centuries (Utrero Agudo and Villa del Castillo); and Corduba’s ties with the Byzantine expansion (Vizcaíno—Sánchez). The second part, dedicated to Muslim Qurṭuba, contains 14 chapters that deal with the city in Arabic sources (García-Sanjuán); the Arab occupation (Ballestín-Navarro); the city’s administrative apparatus (Meouak); the Christian and Islamic populations during the 7th to the 12th centuries (Hidalgo Prieto and Fuertes Santos); the historical and cultural milieu of Christians (Monferrer-Sala) and Jews (Martínez Delgado); the city’s hybrid Islamic– Christian architecture (Murillo-Fragero); the old medina (León Muñoz and Montejo Córdoba); the suburban areas (Murillo Redondo and Casal-García); the palatial complex of al-Madīnah al-Zahrāʾ (Vallejo—Triano); the practice of fine arts (Puerta Vílchez); descriptions of everyday life gleaned from epigraphic remains (Martínez-Núñez); and the fascinating world of science (Samsó) and letters (Buendía). The up-to-date information collected in each of the chapters that make up this Companion gives a compelling account of Cordoba’s most important archaeological, urban, political, legal, social, cultural, and religious facets. Indeed, this volume offers state-of-the art knowledge on the most outstanding\n\npreface\n\nix\n\naspects of the city from the late Roman era to the Muslim period. The 19 studies in the Companion will surely provide the reader with fresh insights into the research carried out over the last few decades on the city.

Even its most important religious and political structures, the episcopal complex, and the Aljama Mosque, respectively, were located in the central sector of ancient Roman Cordoba: the commercial area next to the river.2 Therefore, it is impossible to understand the urban development and topography of al-Andalus Cordoba without first understanding that of Roman Cordoba, given that one is superimposed on the other. In general, even in this type of book, when historical periods ascribed to cities are sharply defined it is because they can be justified by clear urban and temporal discontinuities. For example, Granada during the Nasrid dynasty had little in common with its Roman predecessor, Iliberris. The Vatican in Rome, for example, is located in a secondary area of the ancient city, which has nevertheless been a primary site since late antiquity. Similarly, the areas around large Roman basilicas, which were often built quite far from the forum, became major urban centers, while in classical times they were secondary. Even Rome’s old forum, the center of the universe for centuries, ceased to be regarded as a primary site and became a depopulated grazing area for cattle. As a result, it came to be known as the Campo Vaccino or “Cow Pasture” throughout the medieval and modern periods. In contrast, both the late antique and medieval cities of Cordoba are intrinsically linked to their Roman forerunner. All three share the same city limits and each is superimposed on the other. They all had primary urban centers in the area connecting the river port and the Guadalquivir River. Although not unique to Cordoba, given this distinctive aspect, it would seem logical to start this book 1 For more on the most recent research on the general evolution of Roman Cordoba, see Baena, Márquez, and Vaquerizo, Córdoba. 2 León and Murillo, El complejo civil tardoantiguo 323–335.\n\n© Carlos Má r quez and Antonio Monterroso-Checa, 2023 | doi:10.1163/9789004524156_002\n\nfigure 1.1 The three historical settlements of Cordoba.

This is also justified by the fact that Cordoba is a city of vertical urban continuity, where subsequent stages have survived by taking advantage of previous ones. To better understand this, one only needs to consider the location of the Great Mosque. Although the site has never been explored at a depth of more than five meters, it stands to reason that remnants of the city’s Roman urban structure lie under its foundations. It has even been suggested that under the mosque’s principal nave there is a fossilized Roman road, although this has not yet been verified. On top of the Roman urban structure (which, although not confirmed, undoubtedly exists) and the many layers of debris under which it was buried, several buildings were erected in late antiquity. This same site was then subsequently filled in and leveled to build the Aljama Mosque.3 Later, two cathedrals from the Christian era were built on top of the Aljama Mosque, which was already on raised ground. In other words, on the site of the mosque there is an uninterrupted, vertical chronological sequence spanning the 2nd century bce to the present day. Major changes to the Islamic city with respect to the Roman city only occurred around the 11th century, when the eastern outreaches of the city were enclosed by a new wall.4 However, the medieval city was laid out along the same topographical lines as the Roman city for over four centuries. In other words, it had a well-defined walled enclosure and identical suburban areas to the east and west.\n\n1\n\nThe Urbanization of Roman Cordoba\n\nCordoba’s first enclave was located in the surroundings of the current Cruz Conde Park. Several stratigraphic surveys have been performed in this location, providing a chronology that dates back to around 3000–2500 bce. However, more consistent archaeological remains from the Late Bronze Age (around 800–700bce) associated with a settlement whose main activity was metallurgy have been documented.5 The later Roman city founded by the consul Marcus Claudius Marcellus in 169–168bc was located about 500 meters west of the old Turdetan Cordoba on one of the two hills overlooking the river (fig. 1.2). The city’s foundation can 3 For a summary, see Bermúdez, El atrium del grupo episcopal 316–317. 4 Murillo, Qurtuba califal. 5 Murillo, Nuevos trabajos arqueológicos; León Pastor, La secuencia cultural de la Corduba prerromana 41–44.\n\n4\n\nmárquez and monterroso-checa\n\nfigure 1.2 Ancient Roman Cordoba © carlos marquez\n\nbe explained by Rome’s interest in controlling the central Guadalquivir Valley with the establishment of a military base, especially to gain access to and control the abundantly rich mines of the sierra of Cordoba, previously exploited by the Turdetan oligarchy.6 Rome, at least in this case, did not impose but simply juxtaposed, until the old Turdetan city fell into urban decay and its elite and inhabitants were integrated into the new Roman city. Due to this deterioration and the lack of resources, the Turdetan abandoned their city after more than 3,000 years of history. During the al-Andalus period, the city’s madina would later be built on top of Roman Cordoba, as we will see below. The Roman city is characterized by two walled enclosures built in the Republican and imperial periods, respectively. Of these, the former disappeared be6\n\nGarcía Fernández, Estrabón (iii 2, 1); Melchor, Historia de la Córdoba romana.\n\nhow an earthquake shaped the foundations of a new city\n\n5\n\nfore the late 1st century ce. As was customary, the streets inside the city were laid out in an orthogonal grid pattern. The city’s forum, located in the highest, flattest area, is documented from the 2nd century bce and survived from the late 3rd to the early 4th century. In the late 1st century ce, Cordoba boasted a vast Roman theater 125 meters in length, the largest in Hispania. As a result of the city’s devotion to the imperial cult and as seat of the capital of the province of Baetica, a new forum was built adjacent to the previous one in the first third of the 1st century ad. This forum was known as the Forum Novum or Forum Adiectum. In fact, it was a Templum Divi Augusti, an immense place of worship surrounded by a huge square hosting the administrative headquarters of the province of Baetica.7 Cordoba’s Roman amphitheater was built outside the walls to the west in the middle of the 1st century ce. The expansion of the city towards this sector, as would also occur during the caliphate, gave rise to a sprawling urban neighborhood centered around this impressive building where spectacles were held. At the end of the century, another enormous ensemble was built in the eastern sector of the city adjacent to the wall. An additional temple presided over an immense square, at the foot of which sat a huge circus. It was a terraced complex built on top of the wall, with the circus outside and the temple inside, clearly corresponding to civic custom, which ultimately consolidated the expansion of the city to the east.8 The urban layout remained unchanged during the 2nd century ce, as no more important constructions were built. However, at the end of the century, the figurative program of the old theater was remodeled to incorporate marble sculptures personifying the empire’s nations. Only the outlying areas of the city, where the opulent suburban houses of the rich were to be found, registered any building activity in the 2nd century ce and the first half of the 3rd century.\n\n2\n\nThe End of the Classical City\n\nPublic building works reached their height in Roman Cordoba9 in the 1st century ce when all the major building complexes of imperial Cordoba were erected. These large complexes of the early imperial period were mostly built to establish and promote the imperial cult. By increasing the number of squares 7 8 9\n\nBaena, Márquez, and Vaquerizo, Córdoba. Ibid. Márquez, El desarrollo urbano y monumental.\n\n6\n\nmárquez and monterroso-checa\n\ncovering several city blocks, the movement of goods in their interior could be restricted, as is the case of the square of the Provincial Forum in Merida10 and the Templum Divi Augusti in Cordoba.11 In the 2nd century ce, no major building works were undertaken. In contrast, there was a noticeable change that became much more intense from the 3rd century onwards: domestic buildings that occupied part of the decumanus maximus and the kardo maximus.12 The kardo maximus is a fine example of how these public roads were used for other building works, in this case to construct a public building. In general, however, public buildings gave way to private ones, the main result being that the roads were at times narrowed from a width of 22 meters to 8.9 meters.13 For almost five centuries, Roman Cordoba underwent a series of urban transformations (we can see many of the final results but not the evolution) until the beginning of the al-Andalus period in the 8th century. As a general rule, these transformations had their origins in the devastating effects of an earthquake that occurred around 260–270ce.14 It has been confirmed that around the mid-3rd century ad a series of earthquakes and tsunamis struck Hispania Baetica. However, the strongest one, whose catastrophic effects first alerted experts to the situation and has therefore been most widely studied seismologically, is traditionally identified as the second earthquake that occurred in the port of Baelo Claudia in 260–290 ce.15 Although it was neither the first nor the last time seismic activity affected the city, it was the most destructive. The earthquake damaged the forum and the decumanus maximus, toppling the columns of the basilica and the ceilings of the macellum. The Temple of Isis was also partially destroyed, as well as numerous houses and, above all, the city wall. The devastation the earthquake left in its wake ultimately led to the abandonment of the port and its associated industrial factories. Although part of the city survived, the monumental structures were never restored or rebuilt.16 There is also evidence of similar seismic activity in the second half of the 3rd century ce, which left the Roman city of Flavium Muniguense (Munigua) in ruins.17 The city was located around 250 kilometers in a straight line from 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17\n\nMateos, El Foro Provincial de Augusta Emerita.

Seismological studies have confirmed that the effects reveal evidence of telluric movement.18 Beyond the confines of Andalusia, it has also been suggested that earthquakes occurred during the same period in Carthago Nova,19 Tolmo de Minateda (Hellín, Albacete), and Complutum (Alcalá de Henares, Madrid). Seismologists are inclined to believe that there could have been a seismic crisis in late antiquity, with localized earthquakes that had moderate but destructive effects in the surrounding countryside (M. 5.5–6.0) rather than a more generalized and devastating earthquake such as the one in Lisbon.20 In Cordoba, excavations carried out on the Roman theater revealed evidence of damage due to localized earthquakes.21 First, enormous seven-meter-long fissures were detected in the quaternary bed rock under the stands (figs. 1.3). These fissures, measuring a maximum of 25 centimeters in width, fractured the entire stretch of the axial vomitorium and the steps of the ima cavea. This undoubtedly caused the destruction of the theater, which was split in half at its foundations and became completely impassable. Second, a building that had completely collapsed was discovered in one of the lateral squares at the entrance to the theater (fig. 1.4). It appears as if all the ashlars collapsed at once onto a square that already had some evidence of leveling. The stratigraphic contexts associated with the collapse and ruin of the building provide a chronology of around 260–270ce.22 This has recently been ratified by archaeological studies, which have established a minimum intensity level of nine for the tremor on the esi-07 scale.23 The result of these effects was the progressive pillaging of the theater’s cavea from the late 3rd to the early 5th century.24 Following the pillaging, the space where the theatre stood was completely filled with debris. The final result of this plundering was the formation of two terraces within the theater, or two levels at different heights supported by a retaining wall, built with old materials from the theater. The upper sector housed dwellings dating from the 6th to the 7th centuries ce, which were renovated during the Islamic period. In the lower, much wider\n\n18 19 20 21 22 23 24\n\nGiner et al., Análisis arqueosimológico. Quevedo and Ramallo, La dinámica evolutiva. Silva et al., Los terremotos antiguos 4.

This landscape in the very center of the city remained uninhabited and vacant throughout late antiquity and even during the caliphate period. It was only in the Almohad period—around the 11th–12th centuries ce—that the area was redeveloped. At that time a small neighborhood organized around a series of streets and ramparts was built on top of the old Roman theater, which was now no longer visible.25 As a result, barely 300 meters in a straight line from the Aljama Mosque, there was a space of land in the walled city center of Cordoba that remained vacant until the 12th century, when land was needed to accommodate the growing urban population. This 12th-century plot of land has survived to the present day. Although evidence of the earthquake in Cordoba was first found in the theater, similar effects have also been observed in other public and private buildings throughout the city. Logically, the specific chronology of all of them cannot be determined. The ceramic contexts associated with the earthquake’s effects do not permit precise dating. In the best of cases, it is only possible to determine an approximate date range of two decades for the ceramic contexts from the second half of the 3rd century ce. Consequently, any chronological differences observed in the literature on Cordoba’s ruined buildings is not due to different processes of abandonment but to the impossibility of dating them\n\n25\n\nMonterroso and Cepillo, La ocupación medieval.\n\n10\n\nmárquez and monterroso-checa\n\nfigure 1.5 Collapse of a house and tavern directly onto a paved Roman road © patricio soriano\n\naccurately in the context of this seismic phenomenon. If Cordoba did indeed experience a process of general ruin in the second half of the 3rd century ce similar to Baelo Claudia and Munigua, it was due to the effects produced by the earthquakes in Hispania Baetica. Research that does not recognize this connection is simply based on unfounded arguments.26 In the second half of the 3rd century ad, the houses and streets of Cordoba also showed signs of seismic activity. This can be seen in an area barely 100 meters from the theater, where evidence was found of a fire and the collapse of a house and a tavern directly onto a paved Roman road (fig. 1.5).27 Furthermore, as in the case of the theater, it has been confirmed that the ruined materials were later used for minor industrial activities. Just like the mosaic workshops that reused the ancient columns of the theater for tesserae, similar activities have also been documented in this location until the late 4th century ce.

The archaeologists who excavated both sites related these effects with those the earthquake caused in\n\n26\n\n27\n\nBased mostly on this broad chronology, a number of researchers have tried unsuccessfully for some years to refute the generally accepted theory that the earthquake had an important impact on the city of Cordoba. For this particular case, see Ruiz Bueno, Actividad sísmica. Soriano, Intervención Arqueológica 451–453.\n\nhow an earthquake shaped the foundations of a new city\n\n11\n\nthe theater. We believe their assertions to be correct given that, if we examine the urban layout of the area as a whole, it stands to reason that similar data at a distance of barely 50–100 meters cannot be due to different phenomena, no matter how much the ceramics do not coincide “to the year.” Moreover, the houses that were left in ruins could have taken a few more years to collapse or burn down, which may also explain the small differences in the chronology. Other public complexes in the walled city center, such as the Templum Divorum in Claudio Marcelo Street and the Colonial Forum and Templum Divi Augusti in Morería Street, also show effects that must have been produced by the same seismic phenomenon. The ruins of the Templum Divorum were verified as belonging to the late 3rd century. In addition, we know that the lateral porticoes surrounding the temple were already being pillaged in the early 4th century ce. Moreover, it was discovered that statues of figures in togas had been reused to cover water channels.28 The same phenomena occurred again: abandonment in the second half of the 3rd century ce and the reuse of materials, looting, and exploitation in the early 4th century. In the case of the Colonial Forum, earth deposits on paved areas have been dated to the late 3rd century ce and again associated with the earthquake. The same situation occurred in the neighboring Templum Divi Augusti. Excavators and scholars have suggested that the temple collapsed in the late 3rd century; a sign that it had already been abandoned by that date.29 Outside the city walls, the domestic fabric continues to provide evidence of these effects. For example, the western vicus was largely abandoned; a process which began in the second quarter of the 3rd century and culminated in the early 4th century.30 It is also known that the early imperial site of Cercadilla, an enormous residential complex to the west of the city, had to be dismantled around this time to make way for the construction of the enormous tetrarchic complex that would be superimposed on top of it.31 Perhaps the destructive effects of the earthquake were felt there, too. However, it is again a public structure, in this case the city’s impressive Aqua Augusta aqueduct (later known as Vetus Augusta), which offers yet more proof. The channel of the aqueduct presents fractures and transformations that blocked the flow of water, which have, once again, been associated with telluric monuments. Cordoba’s other large aqueduct, the Aqua Nova Domitiana\n\n28 29 30 31\n\nJiménez, Ruiz, and Moreno, Nuevos avances 124–125. García Benavente and Carrasco, Hallazgos en el n.o 5 169.

In Cordoba, therefore, it seems clear that public monuments ceased to have a function in the second half of the 3rd century ce. All of them suffered damage during that period, except for the amphitheater, which appears to have survived until the 4th century ce, although perhaps not with the same purpose.33 Just like Baelo Claudia, these public buildings would never be restored. This would seem logical given that neither the oligarchies nor the cities would have been able to recover in such a short space of time. In fact, the area of Cordoba within the walls never returned to its former state. The monuments nourished an artisanal economy that, given the dynamics of a city that had to extract resources from where it could, understandably began to use the discarded materials from the early 4th century. With the exception of the Divorum in Claudio Marcelo Street, the rest were completely demolished and covered with debris from the early 5th century onwards, when most of the city had retreated to the area closest to the river and to the future Aljama Mosque. The late antique walled city of Cordoba was a place where the remaining inhabitants lived among enormous plots of land filled with ruins and vacant lots. This, in addition to the general climate of insecurity due to the situation, may have motivated the renovation, redesign, and reinforcement of the city wall at this time.34 A recent study by Enrique Melchor provides some clues as to the main reasons that might justify the urban transformations that began to take place in Cordoba from the late 3rd century: the earthquake; a shortage of municipal resources to sustain the important monumental ensembles the city had endowed itself with; the lack of funding and scarcity of stable income aggravated by political circumstances, such as the repression of Clodius Albinus’s followers; incursions by the Mauri; and a change in the mentality of the local elite, who stopped investing part of their wealth in euergistic acts.35\n\n32 33 34 35\n\nVentura and Pizarro, El Aqua Augusta; Pizarro, El abastecimiento de agua a Córdoba.

The civic, commercial, and religious seats are the basis of a functioning Roman city. Cordoba subsisted as a city and the capital of Hispania Baetica beyond those fateful final years of the 3rd century ce, after which there is no evidence of the restoration or rebuilding of the main public seats. When these seats cease to function in the majority of cities, and there is no longer any public or private funding to maintain them, they move or die. As already mentioned, this is what happened to the old Turdetan Cordoba. However, Roman Cordoba resisted. It resisted without a forum, and with a good part of its urban area in ruins. It did not disappear, nor did the population move. Cordoba also resisted administratively. We believe that this occurred for a fundamental reason. Between 293 and 305 bce, a huge complex was constructed to the west of the city, covering about eight hectares and comprising more than twenty buildings. In other words, it practically spanned the same extension of the public complexes that were in ruins. This was the tetrarchic complex of Cercadilla.36 One of the unresolved dichotomies of Cordoba’s ancient topography is why the seats of civil authority were not rebuilt after the earthquake while a very large complex of public buildings outside the city walls was constructed immediately afterwards. The old seats of civil, commercial, and religious power were abandoned to their fate, while at the same time, barely 400 meters from the wall, an enormous building workshop, which must have had official sponsorship, was established.37 The fact that efforts were not focused on renovating the city but instead on building this new structure is evidenced by the looting of stone materials from the theater to the north of the city in the late 3rd century ce. The ceramic contexts of the first finds and debris from the eastern middle terrace of the theater reveal only African Red Slip C ware, primarily Hayes forms 44, 48, and 50a, together with local productions inspired by the African designs, which clearly date from the late 3rd century.38 These same materials were detected in the construction trench of the cryptoporticus in Cercadilla.39 Therefore, this leads to a clear conclusion: in the same period that material from the theater was being\n\n36 37 38 39\n\nMost recently, Hidalgo, Fue Cercadilla una villa?

Hidalgo and Ventura, Sobre la cronología.\n\n14\n\nmárquez and monterroso-checa\n\nplundered in the north, the Cercadilla complex was being built in that same area. This suggests that the Roman authorities considered it more profitable to build a new public seat outside the limits of the walled city and abandon the old public spaces. It is not our intention here to discuss the problematic of the historical interpretation of this exceptional building ensemble, given that other researchers address this topic in other chapters of this book. However, we would like to draw attention to the following three issues: – The Cercadilla complex was organized around a large square preceding a huge basilica and contained a considerable number of public buildings arranged along a cryptoporticus. – The complex was built using material from the city’s demolished buildings, among which the theater and the Templum Divi Augusti can clearly be identified.40 – Cercadilla was the only site west of the city that had running water following the repairs to the Aqua Vetus, which had been damaged by the earthquake.41 There seems to be no doubt that Cercadilla was the foremost and indeed the only public seat of power in the city of Cordoba during that period, as evidenced by its spectacular buildings, the public aqueduct to supply water, and the fact that it was built using materials pillaged from former recreational and administrative buildings. For this to happen, public legislation would have been required, as it would have been impossible for a private individual to carry out work of such magnitude. Clearly, Cercadilla is a public structure built with the remains of other buildings that was financed primarily by the city and Cordoba’s ruling elite. The controversy over the interpretation of Cercadilla has been ongoing for some 30 years. The first explanation, supported primarily by Rafael Hidalgo,42 is that Cercadilla was a palace used by the Emperor Maximian for his African campaigns. The second, suggested by Javier Arce, relates it to a villa under the tutelage of the imperial authorities or the senatorial class. A third interpretation, which is completely inconsistent, is that Cercadilla was an episcopal palace built before 305bce.43 In our opinion, whether the structure was a palace or a villa, it must have assumed the public functions that could no longer be performed in the old buildings within the walled city. Moreover, following the interpretations sug40 41 42 43\n\nMonterroso, Córdoba romana 169–172; Torreras, Un vertedero de material arquitectónico. Ventura and Pizarro, El Aqua Augusta.

Hidalgo, Fue Cercadilla una villa?\n\nhow an earthquake shaped the foundations of a new city\n\n15\n\ngested by Javier Arce (praetorium, seat of the governor of Baetica),44 it must have become the seat where the affairs of the province of Baetica were managed, which had been permanently located in Cordoba since the 1st century ce. We believe that the public complex of Cercadilla helped maintain Cordoba’s status and livelihood as a city and as capital of Hispania Baetica for many years to come. We are unaware, however, whether an emperor ever went there. What is certain is that this huge building complex was the only possible provincial or local seat of authority in an otherwise ruined city.\n\n4\n\nThe Roman Configuration of the Iconic Plots of Islamic Cordoba\n\nA pending task for archaeologists in the city of Cordoba is to discover how the progressive establishment of Christianity as the new official religion shaped the city. In this respect, the most important task is to determine the effects of the new episcopal administration, as a religious reference, on the period under analysis. The available archaeological records for this period provide sufficient evidence to suggest that what occurred from the 3rd to the 8th century was the result of a change in the seat of power. In the early imperial period, the Roman seat of power, the Colonial Forum, was located in the upper part of the original enclosure until its activity came to an end in the late 3rd to early 4th century. In turn, in the late imperial period and late antiquity, it seems that the political and religious center of the new city, the seat of the episcopal see, was located in the southern area of the walled enclosure next to the river, the bridge, and the port, which was undoubtedly the site of greatest economic activity in this new period.45 The episcopal palace, the new political seat, was built in an area removed from the political center of the Roman city that had already been completely abandoned and as far away as possible from Cercadilla, which, in theory, was Cordoba’s new administrative seat. However, this was by no means a “marginal” area, as is the case with other “remote” episcopal ensembles.46 In Cordoba, the episcopal palace was located in the very center of the sector between the lower\n\n44 45\n\n46\n\nArce, Emperadores, palacios y villae. For more on the location and controversial hypotheses, see, for example, Gurt and Sánchez, Episcopal groups in Hispania; Sánchez Ramos, Sobre el grupo episcopal; Sánchez Velasco, La Antigüedad tardía y la época visigoda; Arce, La supuesta basílica; León and Murillo, El complejo civil tardoantiguo. See also Utrero in this publication and Alberto León and Alberto Montejo. Gurt and Sánchez, Episcopal groups in Hispania.\n\n16\n\nmárquez and monterroso-checa\n\npart of the city and the river; a highly transited area in the heart of the city’s commercial bustle. This has a coherent logistical and topographical explanation: the monumental complexes of the upper area, like the forum, would have suffered the effects of the earthquake and were therefore not suited to this purpose. Furthermore, in the late 3rd and 4th centuries, a “normal” imperial authority still ruled in Cordoba. The city was still home to decurions and the governor of Hispania Baetica. As a result, the temples in Moreria and Claudio Marcelo streets dedicated to the deified emperors, in addition to the forum (whose capitolium was already dedicated to the deified emperors from time immemorial) were not in any way propitious places to establish the seat of Christian worship at such an early time. As in most cities, the commercial area of the port47 was located far from the primary Roman center, which, in this case, happened to be the most suitable given that it was the only urbanized area in Cordoba not to have been seriously affected by the earthquake. This is also why the episcopal palace was built in the residential area far from the old symbolic Roman center and close to the city’s main commercial roads and only bridge. In fact, the whole city had retreated towards this sector, which is also the lowest area and therefore the most suitable for transporting construction materials from the abandoned Roman buildings. It is also documented that materials pillaged from the nearby Roman theater had been used to construct buildings in this area since the middle of the 4th century.48 The city’s water supply and the removal of solid wastes were other important factors to be taken into account when assessing the suitability of the area. The shortage of water during this period due to the damaged aqueducts had to be remedied with alternative systems, which in the case of Cordoba materialized in the form of wells and water tanks. Of all these systems, one of the largest is preserved to the south of the mosque, with a capacity of around 80 cubic meters and a measurement of six by six meters. This water deposit must have been part of a large building attached to the wall. The rest of the population, especially in the upper area, would have had to resort to wells to obtain the underground water.49 Other problems involved increasing traffic on the roads and the disposal of solid waste, the last of which was solved by the construction of pits, middens, and landfills.50 Moreover, in the upper area, abandoned roads and public 47 48 49 50\n\nLeón Pastor, Portus Cordubensis.

However, work to build new sewers was only undertaken in the southern area, the seat of the new power.51 The mosque and its surroundings were built in the old commercial and storage area near the river. This sector of the city was unwalled until the end of the 1st century ad, when it was enclosed. There is not enough data to interpret what stood under the mosque in Roman times.52 The best trace of the Roman period is the material reused in the construction of the Aljama Mosque.53 Although it is generally accepted that all the material came from Cordoba, the public buildings and the city in general had already been plundered and leveled by the 5th century. Therefore, it does not seem very likely that a sufficient number of houses or urban structures were left standing in Cordoba to supply the mosque with so many and such a wide variety of columns and capitals. The most reasonable assumption is that most of the material did not come from Cordoba, and that the mosque was built from the remains of several cities in its symbolic aspiration to become the new global and ecumenical center. As mentioned above, it has been suggested that there were three Roman roads under the mosque, although there is no evidence to support this claim.54 The excavation of the mosque’s interior has revealed remains and structures dating from the 5th century, which critics have identified as belonging to the church of the episcopal complex.55 In contrast, a large building was excavated in the courtyard during the lifetime of Félix Hernandez, which has been linked to the atrium of the episcopal building.56 These structures were already built on top of the old, leveled Roman city, which was in complete decay by this time57 and whose traces were already unrecognizable in this sector of the city. Although evidence of public buildings in this sector is lacking, there may have been a network of domus near the port that served as the foundation for the later episcopal complex, as was customary in early Christianity. Cordoba’s first cathedral and, of course, the Great Mosque stood on the same site. Later,\n\n51 52 53 54 55 56 57\n\nRuiz Bueno, Dinámicas topográficas urbanas en Hispania 44.

The temptation was simply too strong. In 33 ce, Emperor Tiberius confiscated the lead, copper, silver, and gold mines of Sextus Marius, the richest man in Spain, who had fallen out of favor.1 The emperor had accused him of incest with his daughter and ordered him to be thrown off the Tarpeian Rock, although the charge of incest was the result of persecutions that Marius’s daughter suffered at the hands of Tiberius himself. In any case, the emperor kept Marius’s gold and silver mines, which should have gone to the treasury, for his own purposes. Caecilius Classicus, governor of the Baetica in 97/98 ce,2 wrote an amicula from there to Rome: “I’ll be coming to you debt free—I’ve already pocketed four million sesterces by selling half of Baetica.”3 But he had counted his chickens before they hatched: as Pliny relates, the entire province turned on Classicus and continued to insist on the de repetundis process even after he had taken his own life. Indeed, Pliny and Lucceius Albinus, the province’s representatives, managed to convict the proconsul and his accomplices in an “endless” process.4 Septimius Severus, who in 197 ce had emerged as the victor in the civil wars, had Mummius Secundinus, who produced oil on his territories by the Baetis (Guadalquivir) River in the figlina Ceparia and shipped it to Rome,5 executed without a trial, confiscated his fortune, and seized it on behalf of the aerarium Saturni.6 1 Tacitus, Annals 6,19,1; Cassius Dio, Roman history 58, 22, 2–3—Remesal Rodríguez, De emperador a depredador 217–227, esp. 221–223. 2 Pliny, Letters 3, 9, 2–6; on this see Sherwin-White, The Letters of Pliny.

During his rule, Augustus had granted the city juridical privileges while reorganizing the Hispanic provinces. This produced a construction boom, leading to a city that was expanded and restructured, as the Cordoban inhabitants redesigned all of their neighborhoods in a virtually programatic and monumental manner, until the end of the Julian-Claudian dynasty, Corduba had gained a distinctive profile, which would remain substantially unchanged in the following centuries. Every neighborhood had a prestigious square complex at its center, dominated by a temple supplemented by further sacral elements (as in the case of the vicus Forensis). Or its foundation walls lent it a calculated, forced perspective, as with the “templo de la calle Claudio Marcelo,” along whose x-axis also lay a circus. The theater was situated in the midst of an entire ensemble of squares.10 Portraits, sculptures, and imperial and honorific statues filled the square complex, gardens, temples and theaters. The prospering and flourishing provincial capital gleamed with marble. Italic peoples, veterans, and the members of the local and regional elite had here modelled themselves on the “Roman Way of Life.” On the one hand, their thankfulness towards the perpetua cura of Rome, which they expressed by gifting Augustus with a 100-\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9 10\n\nStrabo, Geography 3, 2, 1 (C 141); Pliny, Natural history 3, 7—Abad Casal, El Guadalquivir, vía fluvial romana; Chic-García, La navegación por el Guadalquivir entre Córdoba y Sevilla en época romana.

The Historia Augusta delivers the dictum that all provinces flourished during the ruling period of Antoninus Pius,15 and this applies not only to Baetica in general but to the provincial capital in particular. In 171 as well as in 177 ce, it was even spared from the invasions of the so-called Mauri, whose route remains just as unknown as their motives, the organizational degree of their troupes, or the course of the battle.16 Corduba’s luck stands in stark contrast to the fates of cities such as Singilia Barba (Antequera) and Italica (Sevilla—Santiponce).17 But what about the period from the 3rd to the 5th century? The 3rd century in this region is traditionally judged as “crisis-like,” in line with the crisis that enveloped the entire empire. The 4th century is treated as all but nonexistent thanks to its uneventfulness, and by the beginning of the 5th century the world seemed to have reached its end, as “barbarians were raging through Hispania”: the invasion of the Suebi, Vandals, and Alans brought with it such destruction that a contemporary such as Hydatius, the bishop of Aquae Flaviae (Chaves) reckoned that the days of the apocalypse had arrived.18 What effects did these events have on a provincial capital such as Corduba—on its political status, its society, and 11 12 13\n\n14\n\n15 16 17 18\n\ncil vi 4, 2 31267; on this see Alföldy, Zu den Monumenten der römischen Provinzen auf dem Augustusforum 226–235.

Were its integration in the patria communis, its participation in the romanitas, and the belief in the power of the gods proven as viable, identity-giving constituents? The extremely fragmentary character of all categories of sources in this period makes giving an answer a challenge; instead, we are left searching for traces, able to produce no more than a sketch of these three indivisibly interwoven fields.\n\n1\n\nPolitics: “There Where Wealthy Corduba Loves the Rich Baetis”19\n\nAt the beginning of the 2nd century, coloniae were considered “small replicas” of the amplitudo and maiestas of the populi Romani.20 In Baetica, politics related to Rome meant the interplay of different discourses: first and foremost that of the governor, who with his officials and army represented the emperor to the provincials;21 then that of the elite, who occupied the key positions of the socioeconomic relationship network and the prestigious offices of the provincial capital or the concilium provinciae; and finally, the communication between the periphery and the center. The Cordobans had minted coins with the portrait of Augustus to commemorate his stay during the administrative reorganization of the Hispanic provinces brought about by the settlement of veterans on their territory.22 The emperor himself had presumably ordered the construction of a stone bridge over the Baetis and financed an aqueduct.23 Corduba’s designation as the provincial capital and Baetica’s thankfulness, which from that point on decorated the metropolitan forum of Augustus as a golden titulus, allow us to infer that both the action and the reaction were rendered in adequate form.24 Yet this harmony seems to have been disturbed as early as the reign of Tiberius. In 25ce, the emperor rejected the request of a delegation from Hispania Ulterior to be granted permission to erect a temple for Tiberius and his mother, as had\n\n19 20 21 22\n\n23\n\n24\n\nMartial, Epigrams 9, 61, 1–2: In Tartesiacis domus est notissima terris, / qua dives placidum Corduba Baetin amat.

The proscriptions of Septimus Severus had longer lasting effects than the imperial crisis: they targeted “many noble residents of Hispania and Gallia,” including large-scale landowners like Mummius Secundinus,30 while there is no evidence of military threat, pillaging, or the destruction of cities and villas in this region. If city walls were repaired and fortified—as in the case of Corduba—this was more out of a general feeling of insecurity.31 No further communication seems to have taken place about the dedication of imperial statues on both of the city’s square complexes.32 However, these were no longer dedicated only by the res publica Cordubensium or the Baetican province, but also by officials of the imperial administration.33 Presumably, therefore, the city was forced to accept Rome’s interventions in its administration. In fact, towards the end of the 3rd century, in the northern suburb of Corduba, a monumental estate—Cercadilla—developed.\n\n25 26 27 28 29 30 31\n\n32 33\n\nTacitus, Annals 4, 37, 1 and 38, 4.

Although the Suebi, Vandals, and Alans invaded at the beginning of the 5th century, Corduba does not seem to have felt the presence of the barbari until the 540s: no destructions or burnt layers are identifiable before this point, although the construction of a fortress against the city wall in the harbor area does seem to suggest a need for defensive measures.37 In 550, Visigoth Agila attacked the city but did not succeed in conquering it, as the martyr Acisclus, whose grave he had defiled, allegedly made certain that he received his just deserts.38 His “power” points to another discourse—that of the church—which would prove decisive in politicis à la longue.\n\n34\n\n35\n\n36\n\n37\n\n38\n\nHidalgo Prieto, ¿Fue Cercadilla una villa?

Some of them—like Seneca or Lucan—came upon members of their family network when they arrived in the imperial capital and were later joined by further relatives; some had been led by ambitio or the necessity of an officium publicum; others by luxuria, the desire for education or the games; and some by amicitia or business acumen, as Seneca explains.40 In the decades of the so-called “formative period,”41 parallel to the program of new building and reconstruction of the cityscape, Corduba produced knights and senators— including the Annaei, Iunii, and Dillii—numbering more than at any other point in its history.42 Yet Corduba’s contribution to the imperial aristocracy in the imperial period did not end here, and it continued to play a prominent role in the process of integrating the leading families in Baetica. Generally, Corduba’s social structure can only be grasped in a piecemeal way: the findings stem largely from the period between the waning 1st century and the start of the 3rd century ce. Thanks to honorific statues and further inscriptions, our records mostly concern the occupants of urban offices and the provincial position of flamen. The office of the provincial head priest, the flamen Divorum Augustorum provinciae Baeticae, who was tasked with demonstrating the province’s veneration of the goddess Roma, the consecrated rulers, and the reigning Augustus through worship, and with arranging the related games such as chariot races, was considered one of the most important posts that the province could assign to one of its own.43 Approximately 24 flamines 39 40 41 42 43\n\nMartial, Epigrams 1, 61, 7–8: duosque Senecas unicumque Lucanum / facunda loquitur Corduba.
