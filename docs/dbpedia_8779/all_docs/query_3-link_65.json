        "text": "The watchtower trail is a hiking trail that allows us find out more about the military architecture that surrounds Alcalá la Real. We access the two best preserved watchtowers from the town centre: Moraleja tower and Cascante tower, both located to the south of the town and declared as being a site of cultural interest. The trail passes nine watchtowers with their panels that provide directions, recommendations and descriptions with information about the border defence system surrounding the walled town of Alcalá la Real, a map of the watchtowers and information about how they were used. HISTORICAL POINTS Military strategy during the Middle Ages gave great importance to the watchtowers. They served as vantage points that informed of the enemies’ movements and their possible attacks. There is a wide network of Christian and Moorish watchtowers around Alcalá la Real, which was the key feature of the border system during the low Middle Ages, serving as a means of communication between castles and towns, such as Alcaudete, Moclín and even the Alhambra. The area’s watchtowers can be differentiated by their size, height and the constructive material. Traditionally, there was a difference between Christian and Moorish watchtowers, but at source, all were built during the height of […]\n\nThe ancient Abbey Palace was reconstructed in 1781 by the Abbot Esteban Lorenza de Mendoza y Gatica, given the state of ruin of the original palace within the Fortaleza de la Mota. The new building was the end result of the aggregation of several structures, brought together by the single façade. This building was used until 1851, when the Abbey of Alcalá la Real was abolished. After years of uncertain future, it became the abbey archive and the home of the Archpriest of the Ecclesiastical Territory. Currently, and after years of restoration, the Abbey Palace is the headquarters of the Municipal Museum. This new museum was created to display, preserve and promote archaeological, ethnological, anthropological, paleontological and scientific exhibits organised into different display areas using the latest technologies.Through innovative means, the museum allows visitors to become better acquainted with Alcalá la Real’s heritage and traces of its past. It gives visitors the chance to have an overview of the town’s peculiarities, places of interest and its surrounds. Exhibition spaces: The flour room (dedicated to flour mill traditions), geology, minerals and fossils, Paleolithic, Neolithic, Copper and Bronze, Iberian world, Roman world, medieval, etc.\n\nThis church is in front of the Paseo de los Álamos. It was built in the 18th century over a small 16th century chapel. The floor plan is ellipsoidal in shape with four rectangular spaces projecting from it, which correspond to the atrium, east end and side chapels. The perfection of its elliptical floor plan is its brick vault ceiling is outstanding. The façade is divided into three levels: the first with a very moulded semicircular arch portal flanked by Tuscan pilasters, the second with a niche framed by lonic columns and pinnacles, and the upper part crowned with a steeple decorated with ailerons and topped with pinnacles.\n\nThis beautiful Renaissance fountain, called the Pilar de los Álamos, is located directly in front of Los Álamos park. It was built in 1552 and was designed by Jacobo Florentino ‘el florentín’, although he did not complete its construction. He was the predecessor of Diego de Siloé in Los Jerónimos church in Granada and both artists were considered the pioneers of Andalusian Renaissance. Historical accounts recall that this fountain once collected water from ‘La Mina’ spring, located close to the natural site Los Llanos. The fountain’s façade is made of sandstone and displays two warriors holding Alcalá’s coat of arms, protected by two griffins, mythological creatures with the body of a lion and the head and wings of an eagle, which guard treasures. These figures can also be found on other buildings in the town, as in heraldry, these imaginary beings are always related to protecting and guarding the town, a role that Alcalá la Real played for more than a century before the conquest of Granada. To this end, the inscription present on the emblem’s orle reads “key, guard and defence for the Castillian kingdoms”, the title granted to the town by the Catholic Monarchs.\n\nThis Roman site has both, urban and rural features. With an area larger than a Roman Villae, it could be considered to be a vicus or a small town. Its size is unknown but may be related to other defensive settlements of the same era, which were already known in Alcalá la Real. This vicus dates from the 1st to 5th century AD and experienced at least two important moments of destruction. The first was in the second half of 3rd century AD caused by a large fire. The other was during the 4th century. The name Domus Herculana is used to describe a building, room or house, where different elements related to the figure of the Roman Hercules have been found. The public is able to better understand the importance of these ruins thanks to the installations and explanatory elements incorporated.\n\nOne of the best views of the town can be enjoyed from this spot, located to the north east of the town. Next to the viewpoint is the San Marcos chapel, which gives the hillside its name. It was built in the 16th century, is small in size and of sober design with a straight-lined Renaissance façade. Inside we can observe the icon of Our Lady de la Cabeza.\n\nAlcalá la Real was an important strategic enclave since pre-historic times. The cerro de la Mota hill served as an area that controlled who or what entered the city, and became a privileged place to settle. The Fortaleza de la Mota monumental complex is strategically set on the peak of this hill, at 1033 metres altitude. These characteristics, its shape and location, lend it a predominant view, a perfect natural watchtower, that dominated several kilometres of the surrounding countryside. The Islamic conquest and initiating the castellation of the hillside, brought the continued development of the walled complex and its urban fabric. The second Lord of the Kingdom of Granada, “Aben-abus Ben-Zeiri”, ordered the construction of the La Mota castle, in around the year 1000. The Moors built a city with a layout that followed the same models as the Caliphal and Almohad eras. There would have been buildings such as the military alcazaba citadel or the mosque, of which remains can no longer be identified. However, despite the clear Al-Andalus hallmark, the fortress is today the main product of the architectural reforms that the Christians carried out after their reconquest in 1341 with Alfonso XI. The old walled city or fortress also had religious, administrative and governmental buildings, as well as shopping centres. […]\n\nThis church is also known as Santa María la Mayor church, as it was the new site of the Fortaleza de la Mota’s abbey church, becoming the town’s main church following its desacralisation and destruction. The friars of the third Franciscan Order wer­e accommodated in this church at the start of the 16th century, but this church’s constructive process wa­s long and full of modifications, stretching out until the end of the 18th century. The Virgen de las Mercedes, the town’s patron, is found in this church.\n\nThere is a wide network of watchtowers around Alcalá la Real, which was the key feature of the border system during the low Middle Ages. They served as a means of communication between castles and towns. Nine preserved towers can be visited around the Fortaleza de la Mota. The Watchtower route is a hiking trail that accesses the tower of Moraleja and Cascante from the town. Near Cascante, is the Fuente del Rey site, where an ancient sheltered laundry and the Virgen de Coronada Church is preserved, not to mention the 16th century Santa Ana Church, in the small town of the same name.\n\nGoing up Real Street, we find with The Mora Fountain, in front of Consolación Church. There is two hypothesis about the name: the first identified with an Islamic woman and gives rise to the legend of the love between the Moorish and Christian during the siege of the walled city. The second would refer to the fruit of the mulberry and the importance of raising silkworms was in town.\n\nThis ancient convent was built in the mid-17th century and can be found to the south of the Parque de los Álamos. After 1835, with the Ecclesiastical Confiscations of Mendizabal, it was converted into private housing and an olive oil factory. The Renaissance façade was modified with an artistic double flight of steps and wide windows. On the interior, only the basic church structure remains, which consists of a single nave with side chapels and a vestibule at the atrium. It is currently the home to the Archive and town library.\n\nThe Association of Easter Week brotherhoods from Baena has created a permanent exhibition on the local Easter Week traditions, declared as being of national touristic interest. The exhibition can be found in the Casa de la Condesa, the association’s headquarters, in calle Mesones.The town’s Easter Week groups display different items related to their Easter Week celebrations in this beautiful manor house, in the heart of the historic town centre. This display is a good example for visitors to the town as it explains the unique role of the Judío de Baena (Jew of Baena). This figure’s attire attracts special attention and consists of a red embroidered jacket, black trousers, white shirt, a neckerchief and a metal helmet with impressive imprinted patterns and a brightly coloured plumage coming from the top.Horse hair is also attached to the back of the helmet, which is black (Judío Colinegro) or white (Judío Coliblanco) depending on the brotherhood.\n\nThis museum showcases the most important aspects of the culture surrounding olive farming and olive oil production. It is an educational environment where visitors are taken on a journey of the senses, where they can get to know and deepen their knowledge of this age-old culture, combining the exchange of knowledge with activities and healthy living tips. The building that houses Baena’s Olive and Olive Oil Museum was José Alcalá Santaella’s mill until 1959. Most of the mill’s machinery dates back to the mid 19th century. The exhibition space is more than 800 m2 and is organised over two floors. There is a reception area, the restored and functioning mill and bodega on the GROUND FLOOR, as well as a multi-purpose room. The UPPER FLOOR holds a library and olive oil workshop, and several exposition areas that show how oil can be used as a source of light and heat, electric energy and explains its nutritive goodness. There is also information about olive’s symbolic importance, olive-related proverbs and its popular medicinal value, etc.\n\nLa Almedina means ‘town par excellence’ in Arabic and is the highest part of the town. Its streets and corners evoke times and places, typical of the Arabic era. Plaza de Marinalba is located in Baena’s Almedina, and can be accessed through the Arch of Santa Barbara, where we find the Crismón de Baena, a large Visigoth cross that symbolises Christianity, worked in bronze, which became the icon for the town’s civilisation and culture. The Plaza Palacio is the heart of Arabic and Medieval Baena, which appears to be dominated by another of the town’s most representative symbols: Baena’s Iberian Lion. It is a bronze reproduction of the original that can be found in the Archaeological Museum of Madrid. La Plaza Francisco Valverde or Plaza Vieja, pays homage to the great 19th century writer and historian Francisco Valverde y Perales who brought us the “Historia de la Villa de Baena” a book about the history of the town. The town’s most important monuments are all found in this Arab barrio, such as the Santa María la Mayor church, the Madre de Dios convent and the castle’s remains.\n\nThe main historical inhabited enclave in Baena’s rural setting is the town known as Torreparedones. It was first Iberian and Roman, it then became a military enclave during the Medieval period and was rediscovered in recent excavations. It was inhabited for at least 3500 years, from the Copper Age until the Low Middles Ages. Torreparedones reached its height during Iberian and Roman times. It’s powerful wall, reinforced with towers, surrounding a 10.5-Ha space was already present from the 6th century BC. The site was known since the Early Modern Period given the remarkable remains that appeared. Many scholars mentioned it as an important site “during Roman times” or in reference to the controversial martyrs, Saints Nunil and Alodia. The chance finding of “Pompey’s Mausoleum” in 1833 was a milestone in the site’s history, as it gained the attention of many Spanish and foreign researchers. It was a monumental tomb that contained incinerated remains of more than 12 family members, with their names engraved on stone urns. Torreparedones reached its height during the Iberian and Roman era when it achieved colony or town status. The most outstanding findings correspond to this era. One of the most important settlements to date is […]\n\nAn ancient 16th century Dominican convent, baroque in style, which worships the Virgen de Guadalupe, Baena’s patron saint. It has a large central nave, with no crossing, and two side naves, separated by semi-circular arches. The 16th century Mudejar coffered ceiling that covers the main altar is quite remarkable: it is the only one of its kind in the whole province. The polychromed wooden altarpiece from the second third of the 18th century is also impressive. The icon of Cristo de la Sangre is worthy of mentioning, dating back to the 17th century and declared as being a cultural asset to Andalusia in 1988. According to professor Hernández Díaz, “it is a masterly piece”, which must be attributable to the García brothers.\n\nThe first reference to this church, located in the highest part of the town, dates back to the 13th century. It is thought that it may have been the site of a mosque, given its location, importance in the town and due to references made in documents from that period. Its floor plan consists of three naves, with no crossing, separated by ogival arches, sat on Gothic pillars, typical of 16th century Cordoban architecture. From the outside, there are two doors, named the Angel and the Forgiveness. The first was named as such due to the monument to San Rafael, which is in front of it. It is remarkable due to its convex and concave grid on the jambs and lintel, typical of Cordoban architecture. The other door (Forgiveness) is plateresque in style from the end of the 17th century. One of the most prized and well-preserved pieces of art in the church is the large railing that used to enclose the main altar before it was restored in 2003. It is plateresque in style, from the mid 16th century, given its crenellation, embossed friezes and the way the elements are distributed. It is typical of the Andalusian railings that […]\n\nBaena’s Madre de Dios Dominican convent was erected in the heart of the Almedina, between the castle and the Santa María la Mayor church. It was founded in 1510. Its floor plan consists of a single nave and crossing with adjoining chapels covered by vaulted ceilings with lunettes. The convent church has two doors to this vestibule; the first of which is of primitive stonework and is work of the Catholic Monarchs’ era. The other is more classical, of lesser merit and seems to date back to the 17th century. In addition to the painting that dominates the main altar, there are 64 paintings on the altarpiece, of which the two images in the lower area are attributed to the Bossanos studio and depict the Epiphany and Adoration of the Apostles. The choir, of plateresque decoration, is located at ground level. The seating is 16th century carved wood and is separated by baluster columns and lonic capitals, crowned by crenellation with busts of the apostles, saints, and fathers of the church.\n\nBaena’s Plaza de la Constitución is the real heart of the town. There are 18th century baroque buildings such as the Monte building, as well as more modern examples like local government buildings and the Liceo theatre. The Town Hall is at the front of the Plaza, a recently constructed building. It received an award from Western Andalusia’s Official Architects’ College in 1989. On a pedestal in front of the town hall, we can see the monument to the figure of the Jew. It is sculpted in bronze and represents the main character of Baena’s Easter Week, the Colinegro Jew and the Colinblanco Jew. There are also two more statues in Plaza de la Constitución, commemorating Santo Domingo de Henares and Juan Alfonso de Baena. The former was an 18th century Dominican monk sent as a missionary to Vietnam, where in 1802 he was named bishop and where he later died as a martyr and was canonized by John Paul II. The latter was a 15th century poet covering medieval texts in a manuscript known as Baena’s collection of verse. To the right of the Plaza is the Liceo theatre, the town’s centre for cultural activities. It opened in 1999 […]\n\nA beautiful, open square in front of the Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe church. Thanks to recent renovation works, it has become a balcony that opens out onto the Sierras Subbéticas mountains, offering a spectacular view of the region’s landscape. On one side of the square is a monument dedicated to the town’s olive harvesters. The bronze sculptures represent men and women harvesting the crop in the countryside, and are juxtaposed with real olive trees. The composition is a beautiful contrast in the heart of the town centre.\n\nAlthough the Baena’s current location originates in the Moorish hisn (castle), then named Bayyana as documented in the 9th century, archaeologists have yet to unearth proof of Islamic, Emirate or Caliphate occupation. By means of pact, the Moors handed Baena over to Ferdinand III in 1241. This was the onset of a slow manorialism process, during which the fortress was erected. This construct would play a significant role, since it was on the same border as the Nasrid Kingdom of Granada. There are no reliable data with regard the Almedina’s walled structure construction, although some sections, such as the Arco de Consolación and the Arco Oscuro horseshoe entrance arches are reminiscent of Almoravid and Almohad architecture, respectively. The castle has survived until our times and is located on the west side of the Almedina enclosure, and resembles a 14th or 15th century Christian construction. It is currently in a state of ruin as a consequence of the demolition carried out during the 20th century. However, Baena town council initiated a project that will recover most of the fortress. Archaeological excavations discovered several room structures linked to its last occupation (late 19th century/ early 20th century). Several doors were also uncovered; […]\n\nBaena’s History and Archaeology Museum is located in Casa de la Tercia house. Construction works on this building started in 1792, but were not concluded until 1795, according to the inscription found in the central patio. It was founded by the church to collect part of the ecclesiastic tithes and other income corresponding to the Crown. In 1841, the Ecclesiastical Confiscations of Mendizabal abolished payments to the Church, meaning that the building was no longer used for its foreseen use. It therefore became privately owned. At the start of the 20th century it was adapted and used as a shelter. During the Civil War, between 1936-1939, it was used as a prison. From 1960, the town hall was the leaseholder of the property, until 1984 when it became part of the town’s heritage. The building was renovated in 2010 to house the museum. The Museum’s collections include paleontologic remains, and especially archaeological remains from the Paleolithic era until the Middle Ages, passing through the Metal Ages, Orientalizing period.\n\nA small temple built on the remains of a 16th century chapel dedicated to Santa Ana. Within this church, homage is paid to one of the most revered images in the town, Virgen de la Soledad, the work of Pedro de Mena, which was acquired in Granada in 1663. The portal, dated 1729, gives us access to the three-naved square ground plan. The chancel is covered by a beautiful dome, decorated with abundant plasterwork of complex leaf forms, work of Antonio Álvarez, as well as the main altar chapel. The altar chapel was gilded in 1744 by Francisco Ponce de León, ten years after its construction.\n\nLocated in the centre of the Sierras Subbéticas natural park, at 1200 m high, in an environment declared as being a “natural site of interest” given its geological, geographical and scenic interest in the area. This sanctuary is the venue for a series of romerías, or religious pilgrimages. These include the unique ‘Romería de los Gitanos’ (National Gypsy Pilgrimage), held in June and declared as being a festival of national touristic interest, when gypsies and non-gypsies come together to honour the “Majarí” in an explosion of joy and devotion; the “Baja”, on 4th September, in which the image of the Virgin is carried from the chapel to the village; and the ‘Romería del Costalero’ (the Costaleros’ Pilgrimage, costaleros referring to the men who carry the platforms bearing religious images on their shoulders in processions). In this last pilgrimage, which takes place on the first Sunday in October, the Virgin is carried back to Her chapel.\n\nThis church is located in the centre of the Plaza de la Villa Vieja. It is of medieval origin and was built by the brothers of Calatrava over an ancient mosque. It was dedicated to Santa María de los Ángeles in 1241, when the town was conquered by Ferdinand III. The interior has five naves organised by two rows of semi-circular arches atop 44 red marble columns, covered by a vaulted ceiling. The main altarpiece, the work of Melchor de Aguirre, consists of red and black marble, and followed the project design by the revered architect, José Granados de la Barrera, from Cabra. The central niche houses the image of Nuestra Señora de la Asunción, a Granadan piece, created in 1693. The carved wooden choir and the organ found within it are also impressive.\n\nIt was created by the Ministerial Order of 15 January 1973, with its headquarters within the Town Hall. In 1984, it moved to the building where the Bank of Spain was installed, currently the Casa de Cultura, and has remained here ever since. We enter the museum passing through a wrought-iron gate flanked by four red marble columns from Cabra. It covers most of the lower floor, exposing materials around the “Patio of Columns”, named so given the ten red vein marble columns. The exhibits were received from excavations carried out at the “Villa of Mithra” and “La Veleña”, fortuitous findings, surface extractions, some donations and others purchased. They have been arranged in chronological order: from Paleolithic era until current times. All are proof of the importance of Cabra and its surrounds over the history of time.\n\nCabra’s Aguilar y Eslava foundation originates from 1679 when it founded an educational centre through testamentary clause. It was called the Royal College of the Immaculate Conception, which became one of the first high schools in Spain in 1847. Throughout its 300-year existence, it has gained an estimable historical, artistic, documental and sentimental legacy, which has allowed the institution to survive and create a museum that forms part of the Andalusian ministry of culture’s network of museums. Within its grounds (a 17th century palace) you can visit: 1-. Natural history museum The museum underwent evolved greatly in 1917 with the arrival of professor Juan Carandell y Pericay. It then became an important research centre and entered into the Royal Spanish Natural History Society. The museum houses whale jaws, elephant tusks, eagles, a varied collection of mammals, birds, reptiles and dissected fish, plant collections, a two-headed sheep, as well as extensive studies on mineralogy, agriculture, entomology, zoology and botanicals. It is therefore an interesting place to visit given its historical and scientific value. 2.- Artistic and documentary room An interesting sample of religious artwork and academic transcripts from historical public figures *”Aguilar y Esclava” school* Visit the school’s 17th century installations […]\n\nThe town’s oldest church is found in the picturesque Santa María la Mayor square, in the heart of the barrio del Cerro. The church was founded in the 17th century by the bishop of Cabra, Bacauda (prelate of Cabra, participant in the 8th Toledo Council), and offers us an usual piece. It is an altar stone (in the shape of a pilaster), which consecrates the church to Santa María on 30th May of the era 688 (650 AD) using Gothic characters. It is the oldest inscribed devotion to Mary in the diocese of Córdoba, and one of very few in Andalusia.\n\nAlthough it was founded in the 16th century its fundamental structure is from the 17th century. It was an annex of the convent ruled by the brothers of the Order until 1835. The portal, stone carved, sober, presents the image of San Juan de Dios. Inside we can observe a single nave with a groin vault and dome at the end, the developments of its abundant cornices being very significant. The beautiful altarpieces are also noteworthy.\n\nThe first convent in Cabra, founded in 1550 as a small chapel, named from the doctrine at the beginning of the 16th century . The current work reflects the traces of reforms from different eras, especially the second half of the 20th century, when the main altarpiece and Santa Domingo sculpture were restored. The exposed brick façade presents a white limestone portal with two marble columns, on which their capitals support a niche with the image of the.\n\nA convent founded in 1697. The church is of sober design with only one nave, divided into four sections. The main altar is covered by a semi-spherical dome on pendentives. We can do nothing but admire the main altarpiece, a gilded wood carving that features Nuestra Señora de las Angustias and Cristo Yacente. They were an extraordinary pair, which accompanied the nuns during their founding journey. The sculpture of Christ, attributed by José de Mora, dates back to the third quarter of the 17th century, and is one of the best sculptures of a dead Christ in the history of Andalusian imagery.\n\nThe ‘Casino’ or ‘Círculo de la Amistad’ is a former convent-hospital that belonged to the Brothers Hospitallers of Saint John of God Order and is annexed to the still functioning San Juan de Dios Baroque chapel. Many of Juan Valera’s characters would sit around debating the subject of the hour in its patio. We can find a fantastic description of it in his work Pepita Jiménez: “The centre of the concurrence was the patio, paved with marble, with a fountain in the centre, and many plant pots.” A painted tile in the patio commemorates the writer and while touring the house, we can admire paintings of his family. There is also a small museum on Costumbrismo, the artistic movement present in Valera’s works.\n\nThis wide park was built in 1848, under the mayorship of José Alcántara Romero and is a fine example of nineteenth-century gardening. It is home to many rare and ornamental species, such as centuries-old redwoods, slender London planes, horse chestnuts, lime trees and sycamores and countless plants (trees, bushes, perennials, annuals, etc.). Its high level of biodiversity, the unique varieties, its architectural elements (such as the central esplanade) and the park’s age, make it one of the finest green areas in Córdoba province. Furthermore, the provincial catalogue has classified it as a “Unique Garden” and “Unique tree-populated area”, being home to several “Unique Trees”.\n\nThis natural spot is a perfect example of a natural spring that has been aesthetically adapted by man.The spring is typical of the Sierra de Cabra’s karst system and has great ornamental value thanks to the gardens and trees planted in its surrounds. The area has received great interest due to its scenic beauty and has been officially classified as a “site of cultural interest”, “site of natural interest” and “unique wooded area”.Fuente del Río is the source of the river Cabra and is on the border of the Sierras Subbéticas natural park, which was given this official title in 1988.\n\nIt was erected in the north-west of the town, within the walled enclosure. It had a parade ground where eight to ten thousand men trained, and was surrounded by a strong wall with 18 towers. More than half of the original construction’s wall remains, and approximately 76 x 47 m of the enclosure’s floor can be determined. The walls is approximately 2.60 m thick. Two of the towers are recognisable, and we can determine the location of two others: at the sides of the enclosure’s current entrance way. The keep half protrudes from the centre of this wall. It is almost square in shape and is around 20 m tall. Almost 11 m from current ground level is a octagonal-shaped chamber with cloister vault, with squinches in the angles. The other preserved tower is found in the north-east corner. It is approximately 10 m high and has a square floor and the corner that faces the interior of the enclosure is bevelled. The las Escolapias convent-school is currently housed within the enclosure.\n\nSeemingly fortified in Roman times, this enclosure acquired its shape from the Moors and definitively with Pedro I, who restored it during the 12th century, transforming it into one of his favourite residences. It consists of two spaces, one inside the others, with its corresponding walls and barbicans; the facade, looks out onto the town and is surrounded by a moat. It features the entrance: an Islamic horseshoe arch leading to a small military enclosure, which is where we find the Parador, view point. It was originally defended by three towers, of which there are only remains of two. The Catholic Monarchs built “el cubete”, an artillery fortress with gun ports, and added general embellishments to the palace. The earthquake of 1755 greatly affected the palace and its condition progressively worsened. The Parador is newly built, although it keeps in with the style that a palace within these walls would have had. From the terrace, we can enjoy the wonderful view of Carmona’s plains.\n\nThe Roman amphitheatre dates back to the 1st century BC. Its excavations started in 1885 under the management of Fernández López and Jorge Bonsor. Part of the cavea or seating area are below the level of the Roman road (the ima and media cavea). According to calculations, there were a total of 30 tiers, which were excavated in the hill itself. This is the part that has been preserved, while the upper part, the summacavea, which was built, did not make it to our times. The different rooms needed for the shows would have been underground, i.e. the changing rooms, cages for the wild beasts, etc. The stands would have been covered in marble or some other noble material, and would have been decorated with a wealth of statues, as was normal for these buildings. The west façade had an entrance ramp, similar to those on each of the corners, which led to the exits or vomitoria. It is thought to have been used for shows with wild beasts or other artistic and cultural spectacles. Visits: opening hours and entrance fees\n\nLocated in a building that constituted the former conventual residence of the Jesuits. Construction of the convent concluded in 1621. Following Carlos III’s Pragmatic Sanction, the Jesuits were stripped of their assets in the town, and the college therefore became a boarding school. The Town Hall was adapted in 1842. The most recent alterations date back to 1980 and 1992. The building is organised around an ancient cloistered patio, where we can admire an important Roman mosaic (Mosaico de la Medusa), found in the historic quarter. There is a memorial stone for Tulio Amelio from the 1st century AD and fragments of the Bruma mosaic.\n\nThe Plaza de San Fernando, also known as the Plaza de Arriba, is today a wide urban space where locals meet, offering a comfortable setting to enjoy the town’s breeze, rest, wander and chat with friends. It is the heart of Carmona’s every day life, and has interestingly been so almost forever. During Roman times, this space was where the town’s two main streets -which formed Carmona’s urban network- crossed: the Cardo and the Decumanus. Furthermore, this space was not only the town’s physical centre, but also administrative, political and social centre, as that is where the forum was built. Throughout the centuries, this square has continued to be used for public acts; religious and social events have been held here, such as bullfighting, since the Modern Age. Nowadays, political and administrative matters are once more in the spotlight in this square, as the town hall is located in a former Jesuit college. It was constructed in 1621 by Pedro Sánchez, brother of the Order. The surrounding buildings in the Plaza de San Fernando boast great historic and artistic interest. There is a great variety of styles; however most the houses have one single noble floor, over the ground floor, […]\n\nDuring the Roman era, Carmona had four gates that allowed the walled city to communicate with the outside. Only two of them now remain: la Puerta de Sevilla and la Puerta de Córdoba. This is due to numerous, crucial battles that occurred on our land over the passing of time. In Roman development, these two main gates were connected by the “Cardo Maximus”, the city’s main road axis. This road still remains in the town today, almost unchanged, and provides access to the town through both gates, interconnecting them. Archaeological investigations have shown that the 1st century was a time of economic prosperity for Carmona, which gave rise to the construction of large and important public buildings, including the Puerta de Córdoba. It’s purpose was not only to defend the city, but also served as a means of propaganda. We can observe traces from the different cultures that settled in our town over time on the Puerta de Córdoba. During the Catholic Monarchs’ era the Puerta de Córdoba lost its main defensive function, and therefore, its austere military appearance. It took on the role of controlling products that were produced outside of the wall, acting as customs, therefore taking on […]\n\nThis is the town’s most important church. Its construction started in 1424 and was completed in 1551. It is Gothic in style, although it has undergone subsequent additions. The late 17th century Puerta del Sol and the Sacramental chapel remain from the baroque period. The tower’s construction started in the 16th century, and the two upper sections were completed in the 19th century. It was built over the town’s former mosque and still preserves the former patio of ablutions, named Patio de los Naranjos (orange tree patio). We can observe a 6th century Visigoth calendar in one of the patio’s corners. The church has a hall floor plan, with three naves, plus chapels between the side buttresses. Diego de Riaño created the complicated pillars and rib vault. It has a free-standing choir with a very interesting seating area (artist unknown) from the start of the 18th century. Its wonderful main altarpiece is truly outstanding, the height of the Andalusian plateresque style. It consists of one single plane, divided into five rows with four tiers, an attic tier and baldachin, designed by Juan Bautista Vázquez el Viejo. Its construction started in 1559. The vast heritage that this church conserves is displayed in the sacred […]\n\nThe Las Descalzas convent is in the Plazuela del Marqués de las Torres and was founded in 1629 against Carmona town council’s wishes.It was not officially opened until 1748, the year that the town celebrated solemn fiestas for this reason.Currently a congregation of Discalced Augustinian Recollect nuns are accommodated in the convent. On the interior of the convent, its church has a rich décor typical of the Baroque era, featuring a façade with a double portal and tower.Its main altarpiece is interesting to see as it is unfinished.The sacristy’s Sagrario is also impressive, and is made from polychromed wood. During the Virgen de Gracia processions, the congregation would enter through the right door and leave through the left, passing in front of the choir where the nuns would sing canticles in her honour.\n\nThe Roman necropolis was discovered and excavated at the end of the 19th century thanks to Juan Fernández López and the archaeologist, Jorge Bonsor’s initiative. It was used between the 1st and 2nd centuries of our era. The Necropolis dates back to the 1st century. The most common burial ritual was cremation. The bodies were cremated in burners excavated in the rock where the pyre was placed. Sometimes these burners were also used as burials, placing ashes in the pit, which were covered with ashlar, bricks or tiles. Once covered with earth, a stele would be placed to indicate the place and name of the deceased. The most common burial in the Necropolis of Carmona is an underground chamber, where several members of one family would be buried in a mausoleum. It was accessed through a staggered well. The chamber was commonly quadrangular in shape, with a bench that went around the lower part of the walls, where offerings would be placed and over which the niches were opened. In some of the chambers there are traces of the doors that closed them, whereas others would have been closed using a large slab. The external part of the burials, would […]\n\nMarqués de las Torres palace is an example of Carmona’s 18th century palace architecture. It has an impressive portal, typical of Seville’s baroque period of the year 1700. It has two tiers: the lower tier has double Tuscan columns at each side of the door, which supports the upper balcony, framed by joint lonic columns and topped with an open triangular pediment on its decorative base. The construction’s date is inscribed over the monumental stone façade’s pediment: 1755, alongside the Quintanilla family’s coat of arms. Its extensive side façade is Late Baroque in style, and has an impressive 18th century styling with Islamic patterns that decorate the balconies’ put-log holes. The central patio has a square floor plan and the rooms are organised around it over two floors. The Interpretation centre and town museum are currently housed here. The museum displays a summary of the town’s history, from its origins to the present day. The exhibition is in chronological order and uses archaeological, ethnographic and artistic objects to narrate the town’s history pointing out its most important periods of time.\n\nConstruction started in 1794, but the current aesthetics were adopted in 1925, some years before the 1929 Ibero-American Exposition held in Seville. These transformations acquired the Andalusian regionalism style, influenced by architect Aníbal Gozález’s work. A fountain was erected in a desolate area on the outskirts of the town. It was called the Fuente de los Leones, following its remodelling during the times of Juana I. This fountain, surrounded by a stone, bench-like ledge, became a place for recreation and prompted the construction of a boulevard in the surrounding area some years later. The fountain was known as the “Plaza de Abajo” (the lower square), because the “Plaza de Arriba” (upper square) was found within the walled enclosure, the higher part of the city.\n\nThe Church was built in the 15th century, although it was decorated and transformed during the Baroque Period. The facade of the tower was finished in this period. The parish restoration was carried out in 1975. The main altarpiece from the 18th century stands out, with has its base, three columns, three rows and attic. There also is an important collection of paintings distributed on the walls of the church and the sacristy. One of the most significant is Saint Catherine of Alexandria found in the presbytery. The Jesus of Nazareth Chapel has three altarpieces. Made in 1607 by Francisco de Ocampo the most important.\n\nThe church has a basilica-style floor plan, comprising three naves surmounted by five ogival arches on pillars, covered with vaulted ceilings with lunettes in the central part and 18th century groin vaults at the sides, which conceal the original wooden coffered ceiling. Sadly there was a fire in 1984, leading to the loss of some beautiful elements: the 18th century frescoes that once decorated the crossing’s dome and the main altar, of the same era, which was dominated by the icon of San Pedro. The Sacramental chapel, attributed to Ambrosio Vázquez de Figueroa is a real jewel of rococo architecture. The tower, named “Giraldilla”, given its resemblance to Seville’s cathedral, was built during the 16th and 18th centuries. It is crowned by a weather vane that represents faith, work of Alfonso Berraquero. It houses a large number of interesting works, among which, the following are outstanding: the Virgen de la Antigua, attributed to Roque de Balduque, Virgen del Rosario, an anonymous 18th century piece and an image of San José attributed to Montes de Oca, who was also the creator of the images pertaining to the brotherhood Hermandad de la Humildad y Paciencia: the Christ of Humility and Patience and […]\n\nThe Puerta de Sevilla is one of the most significant elements among Carmona’s rich architectural ensemble. Although archaeological remains have been found dating back to the 14th and 12th centuries BC, it originated in the 9th century BC. Therefore, this monument, which was granted artistic and historic heritage before even Seville’s Giralda, reflects western history’s milestones and events of which the town has been both a witness and participant. Effectively, the culture of those that have settled in Spain’s tableland has been imprinted on the Puerta de Sevilla’s ashlar stones: including Eastern Mediterraneans, Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Romans, Arabs and lastly, Christians. The Carthaginians built a bastion over the original 13th century BC tower, giving way to the first traces of its quadrangular appearance; heavy and strong to defend the city from the Roman army. The Romans strengthened and renovated the structure erected by the Carthaginians with a group of doors that still exist. A podium and church were constructed over the bastion. These and other interventions carried out by the Romans, especially during the 1st century of our era, made Carmona, “the strongest city of the Hispania Betica of all time” as Caesar proclaimed when he conquered the city. Several interventions […]\n\nThe market was built on the site of the former Santa Catalina convent, a 16th century construction that was knocked down in 1844 after having been abandoned following the Ecclesiastical Confiscations of Mendizabal of 1835. The new building was set in a Neoclassical style, designed by Ramón del Toro in 1842. The building is rectangular in shape, with four sides with porticoes and spaces for market stalls. It is closed with four wrought-iron gates, and was restored in recent years. In view of its decadence as a traditional market, there are plans to bring this trading space more in line with the trading philosophy of our ages, where multiples tapas bars and a oleoteca, a shop specilized in olive oil, are located.\n\nSan Blas church is one of the only churches in Carmona to maintain its original appearance. Peter of Castile started its construction, making use of a synagogue’s ruins. The Mudejar section was built in the sixteenth century, and the church was remodelled and the tower erected in the eighteenth century. The central nave is covered with a half-barrel vault and the side naves with a groin vault. The remarkable main retable has a Baroque layout. The Gothic chapel, built by Fernando Caro, has a delicate sexpartite vault and displays Eslava Rubio’s Jesus Christ of the Expiration sculpture. The marquetry on the sixteenth-century doors and the aquamanile found in the sacristy are both impressive.\n\nDominican nuns founded Santa Florentina convent in the second half of the sixteenth century, and dedicated it to Saint Florentina. The convent was later rebuilt in 1714. It currently consists of constructions from several eras, but seventeenth- and eighteenth-century structures predominate. It is therefore considered to be the oldest Dominican convent in Écija and one of the first to have existed in Andalusia. A pointed arch portal and alfiz, which leads to the torno revolving window, are preserved from the first building. The cloister or main courtyard consist of two tiers of semi-circular arches atop columns, dating back to the seventeenth century. Most of the convent’s rooms are eighteenth century, including the sacristy (1708), the refectory, the church (1714), the main portal (1759) and the bell tower. The main portal is stone and Baroque in style. It is framed by pairs of columns with mascarons and a broken pediment, which houses a niche with a statue of Our Lady of the Rosary, displaying the date 1759 on the console. The church comprises one single nave, which houses an exceptional Baroque main altarpiece. The Dominican nuns who live in the convent bake sweets and pastries, which can be bought through the torno […]\n\nThe Sisters of the Holy Cross congregation has served in the convent since 1924. The convent consists of one single nave, a crossing and side chapels. Its construction dates back to the mid-seventeenth century, but it was completely rebuilt during the eighteenth century. The simple portal, which opens at the west end of the nave, belongs to the same period. Paintings that depict the Assumption, Saint Bonaventure, the Immaculate Conception, Saint Michael, Saint Benedict and the Jubilee of the Porziuncola are displayed on the main altarpiece. The title sculpture and the tabernacle are believed to date back to 1786.\n\nLas Teresas convent is located in the former Condes de Palma palace, an extremely interesting Mudejar building erected during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. The convent belongs to the Discalced Carmelite nuns, who are known in the town as “Las Teresas”. It was founded in around 1630, when the Discalced Carmelites had to move to the site, which caused serious conflicts with the town’s governors who were accustomed to meeting in the palace. Works on the church were initiated in 1655 thanks to donations and Sister Paula de San José’s dowry. The monumental portal belongs to the transition from Gothic to the Renaissance with light Manueline décor, as can be observed through maritime motifs. The façade’s decoration is uncommon to this area: the Palma counts “imported” it during the fourteenth century, mimicking the style that existed on palace houses in south Portugal, where they also owned land. Some of the palace’s rooms are decorated with interesting fifteenth-century Mudejar yeseria. It is believed that they are works from the same masters who created the ones in the Royal Alcazar of Seville. The church’s entrance door features an interesting piece of Mudejar carpentry from the second half of the fourteenth century, yet […]\n\nThis church has received “Site of Cultural Interest” status. It has one single nave, a crossing, chapels between buttresses and a flat presbytery wall, behind which is the sacristy. The church was inaugurated in 1614; however, the yeseria plasterwork that covers the interior was included in the eighteenth century. It is magnificently decorated with paintings and murals with polychromed and gilded yeseria and an excellent collection of paintings, sculptures and carpentry, which together with the eighteenth-century organ, make this church an emblem of Écija’s Baroque. Ignacio Tomás created the portal that leads to the atrium, which is preserved from the disestablished Carmelites convent. The main altarpiece was built between 1736 and 1739. It consists of two sections, with five aisles separated by columns and estipites, and an attic, and displays sculptures of Carmelite saints. The main niche opens onto a chamber, which displays an eighteenth-century sculpture of Our Lady of Mount Carmel; the Immaculate Conception appears in the attic and is from the same century. The crossing dome is decorated with exuberant plasterwork mouldings in geometric and plant-derived forms.\n\nThe ancient Santa María parish church was formerly Gothic-Mudejar in style. It is believed to have been built by Pedro Fernández Gragera, knight at the service of Saint Ferdinand during the reconquest of Écija. According to sources, it was completed in 1262. Structurally, it consists of three naves and a polygonal apse. Two further naves were added later, which lend the church an irregular floor plan. It also boasts a tower, orange-tree courtyard and cemetery. The building underwent important reforms throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The church was demolished in 1758 and a new, neoclassical floor plan constructed. The Sacramental Chapel adjoining the Evangelist nave has one single nave. A mid-eighteenth-century shrine-style retablo is located in the altar, which once served as the parish’s altar of repose. Between 1953 and 1954, Joaquín Ojeda Osuna and Ricardo Comas Fagundo provided the chapel with lavish decoration in the form of frescoes. They reflect a wide array of iconography, including phylacteries and inscriptions, clearly influenced by Sevillan Baroque. The Parish Museum is located in the church’s courtyard. It exhibits a collection of prehistoric, Roman and Arabic remains. One of the most valuable pieces is the marble head of Germanicus, from the Roman […]\n\nSan Juan Bautista parish church dates back to the sharing out of the lands that were conquered by King Ferdinand III, nicknamed “the Saint”. It is a Gothic-Mudejar church, with three naves covered by wooden framework and a polygonal masonry apse. Successive reforms took place throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, which significantly changed the building’s interior. The tower was built in the second quarter of the eighteenth century. In 1776, the building faced imminent ruin and was demolished in its entirety to create a new floor plan. To this end, the current San Juan Bautista church is what would have been the Sacramental Chapel, which was adjoined to the Epistle nave prior to the renovations. The main altarpiece houses an eighteenth-century Baroque retablo, featuring a seventeenth-century sculpture of the Nazarene. Paintings by Antonio de Pereda (seventeenth century) and Juan de Espinal (eighteenth century) are also noteworthy. The tower comprises three bell sections, built with considerable height. The Baroque elements in the upper sections make the tower the most emblematic and beautiful of those erected during the eighteenth century.\n\nGranted “Site of Cultural Interest” status, this fifteenth-century Gothic-Mudejar church is located a short distance from the Puerta de Osuna gateway. The church is preceded by a trapezoidal, porticoed courtyard. The door that leads to the street sits below a lintel and is flanked by two columns crowned by a curved pediment and a central niche, which were created by architect, Pedro de Silva, in around 1760. The church has a rectangular floor plan, with three naves, separated by vaulting shafts and a polygonal apse. The church’s pièce de résistance is its main altarpiece, where paintings and sculptures harmoniously complement one another. Carvings denote the transition from Gothic to the Renaissance, with reliefs and sculptures from the Jorge Fernández circle and sixteenth-century paintings on panels. The tower, located at the foot of the Gospel side of the nave, was affected by the earthquake of 1st November 1755. It was demolished in 1757, and construction of the new tower began the same year in a different location. It has a raised, brick shaft, from which two balconies open out, with alternating circle and square apertures. Moulding and carved brick capitals, stony decorative elements, painted plasterwork and glazed blue ceramics are combined to […]\n\nSan Gil Abad parish church is located in the highest part of the town, on a typical Andalusian street, Calle San Antonio, in the San Gil neighbourhood, also known locally as Cerro del Alcázar. It is well suited to its setting, which exudes regional character and essence. Founded in the fifteenth century, in around the same time as Santiago church, San Gil is Écija’s oldest church (1479). Over the centuries, it has undergone several conversions and extensions, until almost the entire building was transformed into Baroque. The building’s general structure is preserved from the original construction: a rectangular floor plan with three naves, each with five sections, separated by pointed arches supported by pillars. The church was remodelled in the third quarter of the eighteenth century, when groin vaults replaced the naves’ primitive wooden roofs. Additional works were also executed at that time: the baptismal and animas chapels were built, the apse remodelled, and the sacristy erected. Between 1727 and 1730, a building of one single nave, consisting of five sections, was transversally erected. The tower, located to the left of the portal on the west end, was built between 1777 and 1782 by Écijan master, Antonio Caballero, in line with […]\n\nSan Francisco church is neoclassical and consists of three naves with a crossing, which preserves Gothic vaults from the time of its foundation, and a square chancel. It was originally a Gothic construction but such elements were masked during the Baroque period reforms. The initial construction stage ended during the last third of the fifteenth century. A series of works were conducted during the first half of the seventeenth century and the church was practically rebuilt in the mid-eighteenth century. The portal that connects the church to Plaza de España belongs to the seventeenth century. The eighteenth-century main altarpiece is considered one of the most important of Écijan Baroque. It consists of large estipites and features sculptures of Franciscan saints, such as Saint Francis de Assis, Saint Anthony of Padua, and a sculpture of Saint Dominic de Guzmán.\n\nSanta Cruz church was built between 1776 and 1836 over the site of previous constructions, from which Visigoth capitals and a blind arch with Arabesque yeseria and a Mudejar emblem are preserved. The current church consists of three naves, each with five sections, and houses interesting Baroque pieces. The eighteenth-century main altarpiece came from the La Concepción de los Mercedarios convent. It is dedicated to Our Lady of the Valley, a circa-1575 sculpture from the Jerónimo Hernández circle. It features an interesting fifth-century paleo-Christian sarcophagus with biblical scenes carved in stone. The church also houses the town’s Sacred Art Museum, which exhibits an extensive collection of eighteenth-century silver- and goldsmithery, including osculatories, panels, float frames, lecterns, altar cards, paintings, sculptures, furniture, ornamental picture frames, holy water vessels, and bells. The most interesting items are an outstanding Nanban “Shokendai” lectern, which was made in 1573 in Japan during the Momoyama Period, and a gilded silver monstrance by Francisco de Alfaro Hernández in 1586 (Seville). The tower is Renaissance in style. Visitors can admire an impressive view from its bell tower and take in the town’s other numerous towers and steeples. The Mudejar Arch that stands in the church entrance is from Alfonso X’s reconquest in […]\n\nThe church was founded in 1592 and belonged to the hospital of the same dedication. The church has a single nave with a choir screen at the foot of the church. It has a Renaissance-style façade and the central part features a niche that displays a stone sculpture of the Virgin Mary. The retablo belongs to the seventeenth century; the Solomonic columns are its most predominant element. The main altar is dedicated to the Immaculate Conception, which was sculpted at the beginning of the century. The devotional Jesus Christ of the Greatest Pain sculpture by Lorenzo Cano stands next to the altar. Several paintings are displayed in the side retablos, among which, Saint John of Nepomuk and the Vision of Saint Anthony of Padua are both noteworthy and date to the second third of the eighteenth century. The choir stands at the foot of the nave and is decorated with yeseria from the first quarter of the seventeenth century. The eighteenth-century red and black jasper pulpit is also in this section.\n\nSanta Bárbara church was originally the site of a Roman temple, upon which a Mudejar temple was constructed. Some elements from the latter construction can still be observed. It was the first church to adopt the neoclassical style in Andalusia and was designed by the Cordoban architect Ignacio Tomás. Making use of the Roman granite column shafts, he erected the original portals, which represent an unusual and rare classicism, uncommon in this area. The tower dates back to the fifteenth century and was erected over an ancient Moorish keep. It adjoins to the foot of the nave’s Gospel side next to the main façade and has remarkable brickwork. The square tower shaft houses a chapel.\n\nThe church was founded between 1353 and 1383 and belonged to Saint Dominic’s Order of Preachers until its expulsion. The church subsequently adopted ordinary jurisdiction and the Order returned and took possession of the church in around 1970, but was compelled to close for worship years later. Since 2004, the church and adjoining outbuildings were ceded to the Workers of the Kingdom of Jesus Christ congregation. This convent was extremely popular among the town’s noblemen. The church is renowned for its beautiful Baroque portal, decorated with tiles that perfectly introduce the exceptional, architecturally sound colouristic atrium. The tower —left unfinished by the Dominicans— is neoclassical and consists of only one section. The church has a rectangular floor plan, three naves and a crossing. The central nave is covered by a wonderful, traditional Mudejar artesonado ceiling associated with Diego López de Arenas circa 1600. The Virgen del Rosario chapel was erected in the mid-eighteenth century, and was inaugurated in 1761, the same year that the tower was constructed. The main altarpiece was created in 1717 and gilded in 1724. A sculpture of Our Lady of Peace appears in the central panel and the side panels display Dominican Saints of the same […]\n\nThe church has a rectangular floor plan, comprising one single nave with side chapels with towering tribunes between the buttresses and a crossing. A groin vault covers the nave and a hemispherical vault over the crossing. Although sited over former constructions, the current church back dates to the second third of the eighteenth century. The tower was also erected during this period by Third Order Franciscans. It is located to the right of the apse and is decorated with tiles and carved brick. The main altarpiece is neoclassical in style and features sculptures of Saint Dominic and Saint Francis; the Eternal Father is displayed in the attic. A late eighteenth-century sculpture ensemble of Saint Anne with the Virgin Mary appears in the central niche. The primitive tower was built in 1641 over a turret that formed part of the Puerta Real gateway’s wall. After the 1755 earthquake, many construction works were undertaken and a new tower was erected. The Santa Ana tower is the smallest in Écija, but is uniquely decorated with carved brickwork, tiles and rendering. The church underwent drastic renovation during the eighteenth century. The Cristo de la Yedra confraternity currently uses the church as its headquarters. The […]\n\nNuestra Señora de la Victoria church was founded in 1506 over the site of San Martín chapel, which originally belonged to the Minim Congregation. It was the fourth convent that the order founded in Spain. It has a Greek cross floor plan and has two carved marble Baroque portals, a vault covered in eighteenth-century yeseria, and a grand, three-sectioned, exposed brick tower, which appears to be connected to Málaga’s Baroque style. The early eighteenth-century main altarpiece exhibits a collection of paintings of the same period, which depict the Immaculate Conception, the Imposition of the Chasuble on Saint Ildefonsus, Saint Michael, Saint Joseph, Saint Anthony of Padua and Saint Blaise. The central niche features the mid-sixteenth century Jesus Christ of the Gonfalon sculpture; the Our Lady of the Victoria sculpture appears in the attic. The marquises of Peñaflor’s tombs can also be found inside the church. The brick tower was erected between 1754 and 1757. It differs from other Baroque towers in Écija, as the shaft is decorated. The Cristo de Confalón brotherhood has an agreement with the church to use it as its base and is committed to displaying its sculptures for worship.\n\nThe church consists of one single nave with a Latin cross plan. The façade is neoclassical and the nave features barrel vaults and lunettes, and a hemispherical ceiling over the crossing with the Patron saints’ emblems on the pendentives. The main altarpiece is modern and is dominated by the Corazón de Jesús sculpture. A small, early seventeenth-century sculpture of the Immaculate Conception from the Montañés studio stands to the right and a sculpture of Saint John of Nepomuk to the left. A painting of Saint Philip Neri can be observed in the attic of the retablo.\n\nNuestra Señora del Carmen church was founded in the fifteenth century. Extremely important works were executed during the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries, and the tower was erected in 1637. A highly valuable, eighteenth-century glass case with tortoiseshell and silver overlay is on display in the Santo Sepulcro chapel. The main altarpiece is decorated with rocaille-covered columns and estipites. A sculpture of Our Lady of Mount Carmel is displayed in the central niche; her robe adorned with the same motifs as the retablo. Sculptures of Saint Theresa, Saint Mary Magdalene de’Pazzi, Saint Elisha and Saint Albert of Trapani are in the side aisles. The church also houses a considerable collection of paintings.\n\nSeveral sections of Écija’s medieval wall have been preserved and some of its gateways can be recognised. Of the fourteen gateways documented, four originate from the Roman layout, and therefore connect the two main roads in the town. The first road goes from east to west, from the Puerta del Puente gateway to the Puerta Cerrada gateway. It is extremely interesting given the variety of historic sites and picture-perfect spots found along its length. The Torre del Carmen tower, a stretch of wall, La Cárcel and Ciudad Real buildings, the ancient inn and stone fountain can be observed along this road and provide an evocative setting: the sound of water from the fountain, the breeze and shade from the trees and impressive buildings. The second road stretches from north to south of the town, from the Puerta de Palma gateway to the Puerta de Osuna gateway. Its location is historically interesting, given the Moorish wall ruins. This stretch once provided access to the Moorish fortified town, known as Bab Usuna. The rest of the gateways documented originated in the Almohad era, and others were later than the Christian era. Several stretches of wall have also been preserved, the most emblematic are in Calle Alcázar, Cavilla, […]\n\nPalma Historic House Museum is situated on the site of a former Dominican convent. The palace entrance opens onto the mounting block, where the stables are to the left and the two-storey central courtyard to the right, formed of semi-circular arches and marble columns. This courtyard leads to the orange-tree courtyard, with a stone fountain and the old convent font, which according to ancient legend, connects to a passage that leads to the river Genil. The palace’s décor and furniture originate from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, with sixteenth-century artesonado ceilings and Mudejar flooring in the halls and bedrooms.\n\nLos Pareja Palace House has a white façade and a slender viewing tower on the corner. It consists of semi-circular arches and is covered by a gabled roof. The stone-carved portal is late eighteenth-century Baroque. The dynamic cornice is raised at the centre to display the Pareja family coat of arms. The building’s vault ceiling over the staircase and the quadrangular courtyard surrounded by a double arcade of semi-circular arches are both impressive. The building houses the Tomás Beviá Public Library, which is connected to the Historical Archive via a courtyard. The town’s historical archive is located on Calle Cintería.\n\nSantaella Palace has a stone-carved portal, which displays unique ornamental caryatids, adding character. The building is dated to the first third of the eighteenth century. The staircase is covered with a monumental dome resting on a tholobate with polychromed yesería plasterwork, which is decorated with floral adornment and landscapes, dating to the second half of the eighteenth century, which is very similar to the Peñaflor Palace façade and likely to be from the same studio. The palace’s woodwork is extremely impressive, with magnificent carved doors.\n\nBenamejí Palace is a “National Monument” that has received “Site of Cultural Interest” status. Construction began at the beginning of the eighteenth century and it is considered a prime example of civil architecture from the Spanish Baroque and one of the treasures from Écija’s golden age. The vast brick façade has a stone base and a row of balconies on the first floor. It boasts two large towers on either end, which provide the monument with a certain degree of height; the impressive portal interrupts the building’s sobriety and monotony. The palace originally belonged to the marquises of Benamejí but later housed a military riding centre, and has been the Town’s History Museum since 1997. The museum exhibits several archaeological remains, including an interesting collection of prehistoric metal pieces, three warrior stelae, the “Pieza de Écija” (a unique piece of gold work from the Tartessian era), wonderful Roman mosaics and exceptional sculptures, such as the “Wounded Amazon”, and interesting collections of inscriptions, capitals, mosaics and domestic tools from the Roman and Islamic eras. Visitors are also welcome to explore the eighteenth-century Benamejí Palace stables, which house the Visual Ecuestre visitor centre: a wonderful 270° light and sound show on the world of […]\n\nThe monastery was founded in 1487 and has belonged to the Franciscan Clarist congregation since its origins. Isabel Cherino, widow of Luis Pernía, Osuna’s mayor, was a devout Catholic and helped found the monastery by donating large sums of money to the convent in her will in 1505. The convent’s most important benefactors include Queen Isabella of Castile, who chose to stay at the convent while she collected funds for the Granada War, Empress María of Austria, Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia and the town council, all of whom left generous legacies. Furthermore, the town council financially supported the nuns on several occasions, given the catastrophes that occurred, such as the fire of 1622 and the Genil floods in 1626, when the nuns lost part of the convent. The church consists of one single nave, which is accessed via the two side portals on the Gospel side. The church’s interior is decorated with yeseria plasterwork and paintings that allude to Marian mysteries and Franciscan scenes. The architectural complex corresponds to the first quarter of the seventeenth century and reflects local artistic influence. It was, after all, the Ecijan master builders who planned the composition of such a significant building. The nuns […]\n\nThe palace was built between 1700 and 1775. It was granted “Historical and Artistic Monument” status in 1962 and is protected as a “Site of Cultural Interest”. The Peñaflor family resided at the palace until 1958. The decoration on the staircase that leads to the upper floor is noteworthy for its artistic interest: it forms part of Cristóbal Portillo’s decorative programme, produced at the end of the eighteenth century. The Peñaflor Viewpoint forms part of the Peñaflor palace’s façade and is located on the corner of Calle Mas y Prat. It dates back to the eighteenth century and consists of a ground-level arcade with two- or three-storey open galleries; its arcades, propped up by supports, characteristic of the era, feature typical canopies that make use of the balconies’ projections. It is decorated with polychrome of the same era, which contributes to the building’s grandeur. It is currently not open to the public.\n\nThe Brotherhood House will be unveiled on January 24th and on January 31st, 2015, it will open its doors to the public. It is a large house which is worth a visit to discover its interior. Comprising several rooms, it has a reception area, a function room with audio-visual projection equipment, to give an overall idea of Holy Week in Lucena. Inside, you can also see the exhibition area, where you can enjoy interesting examples of religious art and belongings of the Brotherhood, as well as admire the three ‘pasos’ (floats) used on the Holy Tuesday processions. With this tour, the visitor will also have the opportunity to discover more first-hand about the day-to-day life of the Hermandad del Amor (Brotherhood of Love).\n\nThe Motor Museum is located in Hangar II of the La Estación Leisure and Tourism centre. The Andalusian Association of Classic Vehicles runs the museum and there is an exhibition of classic cars, motorbikes and miniatures, as well as extensive display of trophies and photographs. The exhibition changes every three months when the antiques and spare parts market takes place, which is on the first Sunday every three months. There is no specific purpose for this exhibition, it is an excuse for association members to display the vehicles they own.\n\nThe Basilica and Origin of Christianity museum was opened in 2008. It revived and gave value to this important site that emerged in the Caracho farmhouse grounds. The church has a basilica-style floor plan, adjoining to a necropolis, and dates back to between the 9th and 12th centuries. Its origin dates back to the onset of the legalisation of Christianity during the era of Constantine, during the first half of the 9th century. Visitors to the museum will be able to observe the central nave separated at the sides by columns and the choir, a semi-circular western apse with a sacerdotal bench in its interior, a baptistery and extensive mausoleum at the atrium and a rectangular apse on the eastern side.\n\nThe venerable brotherhood of María Santísima de la Aurora offers tours to visit the heritage that its 15th-18th century chapel boasts. In addition to the chapel’s artistic value, this brotherhood has kept Lucena’s tradition of the campanilleros alive since it was founded in 1717. The campanilleros sing traditional religious songs, accompanied by guitars, handbells and other instruments and sing the rosary to Aurora. All groups tend to sing the same songs, but some groups use their own words for some of the songs, and their individual way of interpreting them. The clothing worn by the campanilleros is also a distinguishing feature.\n\nThis castle was originally Jewish and was renovated following the Christian reconquest. The Moral tower is quite remarkable. King Boabdil known as “El Chico”, was the last Nasrid King of Granada and was kept inside the tower during the first of the battles that he lost until he finally lost his kingdom. Medieval Subbética trail and legacy of Al-Andalus trail. 14th century. The museum takes visitors on a thematic route, through eleven rooms that reflect the transformation and idiosyncrasy of Lucena, marking its historical milestones.\n\nThe church was founded outside the city walls by the Discalced Franciscans (Alcantarinos) in 1713, and was formally the Virgen del Valle chapel.It was disentailed in 1835, and was not occupied by another community until the end of the last century.It was a shelter for the Ancianos Desamparados for many years, until the beginning of the 80s, when it was used by the Jesús Abandonado homeless charity.Significant restoration works have been carried out on the church,which is relatively small and consists of a single floor with side chapels.It has an impressive main altarpiece created by Juan Abundio de Burgosbetween 1760 and 1763 with carved and gilded Flanders pine.The Virgen del Valle semi-circular chapel opening occupies the central aisle.\n\nThe building of the Gothic-Mudejar style Santiago parish church began in 1503, from the provisions of the will of García Méndez de Sotomayor, the Commander of the Order of Santiago. It has traditionally been considered an ancient Jewish synagogue but, during its construction, it is possible that materials were used from the then recently demolished ancient temple of San Mateo, where the ancient synagogue and mosque may actually have been. The church is rectangular in shape, with three naves divided by octagonal pillars which support brick-pointed arches with an alfiz. The three naves are covered with coffering, rebuilt following the model of the original. Today, decorated in harmony with the Mudejar style of the rest of the temple, Christ of the Column is enshrined within it, work of the distinguished Sevillan sculptor, Pedro Roldán, created in the 17th century, and Our Lady of Hope.\n\nThis church was built in 1718 by Jerónimo Ramírez de Quero in line with Leonardo Antonio de Castro’s designs, an artist from Lucena of great renown. The church has a rectangular floor plan and a remarkable side with five sections, covered with a half barrel vault, except for the section next to the presbytery, which boasts a dome atop pendentives embellished with complex leaf forms around the founders’ heraldic coat of arms. The façade consists of ashlars, formed by a rectangular wall, crowned by a triangular pediment with an oculus, mirroring models inspired by the Herrerian style. The main altarpiece, dominated by the image of the Inmaculada, was constructed in 1800.It shows clear Neoclassical influences in its structure and is organised into three traditional tiers: a very elevated, lower bench, including beautifully carved and gilded geometric-style sacristy doors and a Sagrario, topped by a straight pediment, the main tier and the attic tier.It possesses many sculptures, one of the most remarkable being San Miguel, which is possibly of colonial origin.\n\nThis cave is a prehistoric settlement of immeasurable historic and scientific value, with significant Middle Paleolithic remains. It belongs to a chronological period of 480 000 years and 100 000 years, during which Acheulean and Mousterian eras are reflected. This is when the Neanderthal and pre-Neandertal populations inhabited this settlement. Works have recently been carried out on the settlement, including a 80-m deep tunnel/gallery that links the outside with the middle area of the settlement. Tours of the settlement can be organised on Saturdays from 11:00 AM. Tours include travel from the centre to the settlement."
