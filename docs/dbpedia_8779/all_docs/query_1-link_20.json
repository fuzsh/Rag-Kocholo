The document summarizes the history of the Lordship of Negroponte, a crusader state established on the Greek island of Euboea after the Fourth Crusade. The island was divided into three territories ruled by Lombard families. Over time, the Venetians came to dominate the island politically and economically. By the 15th century, the island had become a regular Venetian colony until it was conquered by the Ottoman Empire in 1470.",
