        "text": "The chapel is part of the Salesian College, the oldest belonging to the congregation in Spain (circa 1885). The Salesian building housed within the chapel is noteworthy given its breadth, which stretches across the wide, expansive street, locally known as La Vereda. Although the building’s loftiness is horizontal, a series of belfries were added to bring it closer to the heavens. The chapel was built in the second half of the 17th century. It has a Latin-cross floor plan and a barrel vault ceiling, lunettes and supporting arches propped up by a cornice. Exceptional paintings decorate the chapel’s interior, which pertain to the transition from the 17th to the 18th century: the apogee of the Seville school of mural painting.\n\nAceites Florencio Aguilera is a family business which produces high quality olive oils, opting for the early oil of the Picual variety. The family olive mill is located in the hamlet of La Hortichuela, 12 km from Alcalá la Real, in the small town of Pilas de Fuente Soto. It is an enclave in the heart of nature, surrounded by a forest of olive trees and where families who have traditionally worked the land and farmed livestock live. This is where you can find the heart of Aceites Florencio Aguilera. The company offers walks around the olive grove estate and tasting of local products, sampling of olive oil and tour of the olive mill. * Tour of Gastronomic and Rural Experiences. 21, 22, 23, 28, 29, 30, October 2022. VISIT TO THE FLORENCIO AGUILERA OLIVE MILL. Extra virgin olive oil tasting paired with local products prepared with extra virgin olive oil. Reservations: contacto@aceitesflorencioaguilera.com Price: € 15 per person. Maximum 15-20 persons.\n\nThe Priego de Córdoba wholesale market is located in a historic-patrimonial setting given that it is situated next to the Carnicerías Reales (Royal Slaughterhouse) building. Inside you will be able to find various stalls with: bread and artisan products, greengrocer’s, butchers, fishmongers, chicken rotisserie stall open at weekends, pizzeria, beauty centre, handicrafts store and a bar. There is also a car park with direct access to the market to make shopping easier. The market’s opening hours are from 7.30 am until 11 pm (the stalls are open during normal trading hours).\n\nIt was created by the Ministerial Order of 15 January 1973, with its headquarters within the Town Hall. In 1984, it moved to the building where the Bank of Spain was installed, currently the Casa de Cultura, and has remained here ever since. We enter the museum passing through a wrought-iron gate flanked by four red marble columns from Cabra. It covers most of the lower floor, exposing materials around the “Patio of Columns”, named so given the ten red vein marble columns. The exhibits were received from excavations carried out at the “Villa of Mithra” and “La Veleña”, fortuitous findings, surface extractions, some donations and others purchased. They have been arranged in chronological order: from Paleolithic era until current times. All are proof of the importance of Cabra and its surrounds over the history of time.\n\nThis church is the former Alcantarinos Convent.It is Baroque in style and was concluded in 1690. It has a Latin cross floor plan with half barrel vaults and a dome over the hemispherical crossing atop pendentives with scarce plasterwork décor. The main altarpiece was created by the Sánchez de Rueda brothers, and consists of a section separated into three aisles, by four Solomonic columns. The central aisle connects with the chapel, which houses the beautiful image of La Inmaculada by José de Mora, which is outstanding due to its enhanced colour. The sides feature the images of Santa Rosa de Viterbo and Santa Rosalía.The icon of San Pedro is found in the niche, which dates back to the early 16th century. The altarpiece underwent changes during the 18th century, since it was created behind a wide chapel.It was commenced by Jerónimo Sánchez de Rueda and concluded by Juan de Dios Santaella in 1739.It is a wide space with an octagonal floor plan with a semi-spherical dome, featuring a blind skylight.The décor combines plasterwork, featuring cherubs, embedded mirrors and glass spheres that set off the striking colours in the marble. The Venerable Orden Tercero chapel houses the remarkable image of Santo […]\n\nThe Sierra de Albayate is a dense Mediterranean forest containing notable species such as holm oak (Quercus ilex), Portuguese oak (Quercus faginea), broom (Genista cinérea), small-flowered gorse (Ulex parviflorus), rockrose (Cistus albidus), Mediterranean honeysuckle (Lonicera implexa), wild olive tree (Olea europaea var. sylvestris), matagallo (Phlomis purpurea), English ivy (Hedera helix), smilax (Smilax aspera), broom (Retama sphaerocarpa), hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna) and blackthorn (Prunus spinosa). As we climb, we will be able to see the Ermita de San Miguel del Castellar hermitage in the north east and the La Tiñosa mountain in the west. The Sierra del Albayete is surrounded by the Peñas Doblas mountain (1132m) and the peak of La Pelona (1306m) on the Muchacho Mountain. We will also be able to see important waterside vegetation in las Peñas stream, with species such as the white poplar (Populus alba), wild blackberry (Rubus ulmifolius), dog rose (Rosa canina) and giant reed (Arundo donax). Throughout this area we will be able to spot birds such as the common buzzard (Buteo buteo), short-toed snake eagle (Circaetus gallicus), booted eagle (Aquila pennata), peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), common kestrel (Falco tinnunculus) and sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus). In autumn, we will also be able to find wild mushrooms […]\n\n18th century construction. Current court. Impressive facades. Very sober interior. This house belonged to the Condes de Cepedas, dating to the mid 18th century. It offers one of Osuna’s finest facades. Baroque in style but simple elements, the portal juts out slightly and is framed with stone estipites. The sober balcony is crowned by the family coat of arms protected by two halberdiers of almost real scale. This large façade opens up through numerous windows adorned by beautiful railings. The house belonged to the Cepedas family. The most noteworthy member of this family was Santa Teresa de Jesús whose image is painted in the hallway. At present, the building houses the courts.\n\nThis church is in front of the Paseo de los Álamos. It was built in the 18th century over a small 16th century chapel. The floor plan is ellipsoidal in shape with four rectangular spaces projecting from it, which correspond to the atrium, east end and side chapels. The perfection of its elliptical floor plan is its brick vault ceiling is outstanding. The façade is divided into three levels: the first with a very moulded semicircular arch portal flanked by Tuscan pilasters, the second with a niche framed by lonic columns and pinnacles, and the upper part crowned with a steeple decorated with ailerons and topped with pinnacles.\n\nThe church consists of one single nave with a Latin cross plan. The façade is neoclassical and the nave features barrel vaults and lunettes, and a hemispherical ceiling over the crossing with the Patron saints’ emblems on the pendentives. The main altarpiece is modern and is dominated by the Corazón de Jesús sculpture. A small, early seventeenth-century sculpture of the Immaculate Conception from the Montañés studio stands to the right and a sculpture of Saint John of Nepomuk to the left. A painting of Saint Philip Neri can be observed in the attic of the retablo.\n\nThis short trail is located in a natural reserve and consists of a walk around the Amarga lake (258 ha) and Dulce lake (262.52 ha). The main feature of Amarga lake is the large quantity of magnesium sulphate in its water, hence its name (literally ‘bitter lake’). We will be surprised by the contrasting colours of this lake, with its deep blue, and the laguna Dulce which, despite its proximity, has much warmer tones; the water comes from underground, although the lakes are also fed by run-off water and rain. The lakes offer landscapes where you can enjoy marsh vegetation with characteristic formations such as: reed, tamarisk, bulrush and fescue. The surroundings offer a beautiful panorama of olive groves and Mediterranean scrub. The most notable fauna are birds since it is their habit, and a transit area along the migration route for others. Of particular relevance are the Western swamphen and ruddy ducks, both classified as being ‘in danger of extinction’. There is an observatory from where you can observe, among other birds, ruddy ducks, which can be identified by their thick blue beak and upright tails. Others include the common pochard, mallards and wainscots, great crested grebe, crested and […]\n\nSince the end of the 16th century, there were wishes for Puente Genil to found a San Francisco de Paula convent. However, it was not until the second half of the 17th century that the lady of the town, the Marchioness of Priego, Juana Enríquez de Ribera, supported this decision. The convent and church’s construction works lasted for the whole of the second half of the 17th century, and the doorway was completed in 1707. The cloister was completed in 1725. The inside of the Church was decorated with mainly carved and gilded wood altarpieces. The most impressive being the main altarpiece, created by Juan Cazorla, sculptor from Lucena, in 1736. Another recently discovered altarpiece is also remarkable. It represents the “Martyr of Judas Thaddaeus”. The fresco is painted by the local 18th century artist, José Antonio Ruiz Rey. The convent was first disentailed in 1822 and all of its assets were sold. The community was reintroduced the following year but with fewer friars and that is how it remained until all were expelled. The convent’s building was used as a home, sometimes a school and sometimes barracks. When it reached a state of disrepair it was bought by the Casa-Padilla family, […]\n\nThis Roman site has both, urban and rural features. With an area larger than a Roman Villae, it could be considered to be a vicus or a small town. Its size is unknown but may be related to other defensive settlements of the same era, which were already known in Alcalá la Real. This vicus dates from the 1st to 5th century AD and experienced at least two important moments of destruction. The first was in the second half of 3rd century AD caused by a large fire. The other was during the 4th century. The name Domus Herculana is used to describe a building, room or house, where different elements related to the figure of the Roman Hercules have been found. The public is able to better understand the importance of these ruins thanks to the installations and explanatory elements incorporated.\n\nThe Arjona and Cubas brothers’ palace, an 18th century building, housed the local farming chamber during a large part of the past century. Number thirty-seven on calle Sevilla is currently the headquarters for the town’s municipal museum. Currently, we can observe the painting collections of Juan Rodríguez Jaldón and Rodolfo Álvarez Santaló. On the upper floor, rooms exhibit old photography, part of Osuna’s archive, a room dedicated to the University, another to old print works, and lastly, a recreation of what was the former Andújar hat factory “Sombrerería el Bombo”.\n\nThe Jesuits built the church in 1645 and the Franciscans occupied it from 1797. During the Franciscan period, the complex underwent considerable renovations to adapt to the material and spiritual needs imposed by the Order. The church was abandoned from the second half of the 19th century until the 1920s. The nave’s architecture displays influence from the Early Renaissance, typical of Hernán Ruiz. Beautiful mid-18th century paintings decorate the church and its most striking feature is the dome, which displays a tremendous vision of the resurrection of Saint Francis.\n\nThe small chapel that was dedicated to San Antón in the 16th century used to be on the same site of the Inmaculada Concepción sanctuary. Due to the plague that swept across Andalusia in 1650, the town, then Pontón de Don Gonzalo, voted for the Immaculate Concepción to be their Patron. However, the church was inadequate given the Patron’s rank. During the second half of the 18th century, the decision was made to build a church that was more appropriate for the Patron. Several houses on the calle Aguilar were bought for the extension. The church’s portal is the most impressive in Puente Genil, with its frontal platform and staircase closed off by a partition, double columns, broken pediment, etc. All of these elements are created with stone from Sierra Gorda and packed into a large niche. Inside the church, the gypsum-sculpted, polychromed main altar is impressive. It is in imitation of coloured marble and is the work of Pedro de Mena Gutiérrez, from Lucena; the popular-style baroque plasterwork can be found throughout the church around large Corinthian pilasters. The elliptical dome is remarkable. It has plasterwork reproducing Marian motifs. The 18th century chapel houses the image of the Patron, the Immaculate Conception, […]\n\nLos Pareja Palace House has a white façade and a slender viewing tower on the corner. It consists of semi-circular arches and is covered by a gabled roof. The stone-carved portal is late eighteenth-century Baroque. The dynamic cornice is raised at the centre to display the Pareja family coat of arms. The building’s vault ceiling over the staircase and the quadrangular courtyard surrounded by a double arcade of semi-circular arches are both impressive. The building houses the Tomás Beviá Public Library, which is connected to the Historical Archive via a courtyard. The town’s historical archive is located on Calle Cintería.\n\nThe Church was built in the 15th century, although it was decorated and transformed during the Baroque Period. The facade of the tower was finished in this period. The parish restoration was carried out in 1975. The main altarpiece from the 18th century stands out, with has its base, three columns, three rows and attic. There also is an important collection of paintings distributed on the walls of the church and the sacristy. One of the most significant is Saint Catherine of Alexandria found in the presbytery. The Jesus of Nazareth Chapel has three altarpieces. Made in 1607 by Francisco de Ocampo the most important.\n\nRoman Villa from the 1st to 4th centuries AD The villa is remarkable due to its extremely interesting mosaics, some of which are the most important figurative and geometric mosaics in Spain. It is believed that this villa’s first settlement corresponds to the 1st century AD, remaining until the start of the Moorish domination. There is proof however that it was most significant during the 3rd and 4th centuries AD. The unique figurative mosaics are impressive and are associated with important, large wall structures.\n\n17th century. Former Jesuit Convent. The Jesuits arrived in the town in 1612, initially settling in the outbuildings of the former Hospital de la Encarnación. In a short space of time, they bought the land they needed to build their new church between the streets of Maese Diego, Hornillos and Sevilla, in 1615. Three years later, following the designs created by Pedro Sánchez, work on the Compañía convent began, which would be transformed by various interventions in the 18th century.\n\nThis chapel dates back to 1613. It is small in stature because construction works were never concluded. It houses an 18th century Baroque altarpiece, work of local artist Pedro de Mena Gutiérrez. It consists of a hemispherical ceiling, supported by walls at the back part and by an adjoining arch. There are several Easter Week images on its altars, such as the Cristo de la Columna, Virgen de la Esperanza, Virgen de la Cruz, Virgen de la Piedad and one of this town’s oldest images, the Cristo de los Valientes, dating back to the 14th century. Every Monday, the faithful visit the chapel to pray before the effigy of San Nicolás de Bari.\n\n16th century church. Reconstructed during the 17th and 18th centuries. It is currently closed to worship due to restoration. In 1531, the 4th Count of Ureña handed the ancient San Sebastian chapel and annexe hospital to the monks from the Order of Preachers to found a convent. It seems that the Count did this to show that he didn’t want the chapel to be demolished, he wanted it to be used by a new church. It was finally erected on 7 March 1547. Although it was built in the 16th century, several reforms were carried out during the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\nIt was founded by Juan Téllez Girón, 4th Count of Ureña. He obtained the papel bull to erect the ancient parish church in Collegiate, dedicated to Asunción. The exterior of the church has three portals. The interior has a wide presbytery. Construction of the Ducal Pantheon, inside the Collegiate, is thought to have started in around 1545; the chapel was consecrated 10 years later. It was founded by Juan Téllez Girón and is plateresque in style. It adjoins to the Collegiate and has three main nuclei: the Patio of the Ducal Tomb, the Chapel and the Pantheon. The museum’s main room is located in the former sacristy of the collegiate. It displays an impressive collection of Ribera’s works and a many pieces of silverware.\n\nConstruction of the former palace, which once belonged to the Valdehermosa counts and San Marcial marquises, began in the 17th century and considerable works were carried out in the 18th and 19th centuries. Its rococo portal dates to 1730. The Romance and historicist halls within the building are remarkable. In 1877, Enrique de la Cuadra took on the property and filled the rooms with luxury and extravagance. He created the Arabian hall, an architectural treasure with yeseria and stucco that transports visitors to the Far East. Other uniquely beautiful rooms are the Pompeian hall, once used as a summer dining room, the German hall, adorned with the finest woods from the Americas, and the Chinese hall, which served as a ballroom. Utrera’s town council currently occupies this property.\n\nCatalina de Perea founded the hospital in 1514, in one of her properties close to the Santiago church. Although its origins date back to the 16th century, the building underwent extensive restoration between the 18th and 20th centuries. In addition to its beautiful church, the hospital’s central patios are remarkable. The entrance to the patio displays a two-storey arcade; the lower level is the older of the two with 16th-century Mudejar pillars. This open area displays wonderful carpentry on the doors and the screen that leads to the dining room. The latter was created in the 18th century and would have featured wonderful panels, rocailles and Jesuit emblems, which are no longer present. The Dormitorios de Ancianos, or the Elders’ Rooms, are also notable and comprise a lofty, barrel-vaulted nave with false lunettes.\n\nMilitary Almohad bastion from the 12th century, renovated in the 14th century by the Order of Calatrava. It is located close to the Puerta de Teba, which formed part of the town’s defence system. There is a wide sample of remains found in the town: Iberian reliefs, amphorae, Roman glassware and coin collections. This tower, bastion of the belt of 12th century Almohad walls currently houses theArchaeology Museum. It is made up of four rooms organised over two floors. The archaeological remains from the ancient city of Urso and some reproductions are displayed here.\n\nThe Sisters of the Holy Cross congregation has served in the convent since 1924. The convent consists of one single nave, a crossing and side chapels. Its construction dates back to the mid-seventeenth century, but it was completely rebuilt during the eighteenth century. The simple portal, which opens at the west end of the nave, belongs to the same period. Paintings that depict the Assumption, Saint Bonaventure, the Immaculate Conception, Saint Michael, Saint Benedict and the Jubilee of the Porziuncola are displayed on the main altarpiece. The title sculpture and the tabernacle are believed to date back to 1786.\n\nTradition speaks of an ancient Calvary situated near to Tiñosa and of which there are hardly any documentary references. Its existence must pre-date 1593 given that in that year, there was already a calvary located on the same plateau where today’s calvary is situated and which served the same purpose: it was a place of devotion with a cross or image so that pilgrims could pray before entering or leaving the town. It was also used for rogations and devote religious practices. According to the Nazarene’s founding charter, their Good Friday processions reached here. We know that there were two early crosses and that, in the 18th century, others were added that are well documented. In 1707, construction on the Calvario Hermitage was completed with the alms from the congregation and contributions from the Franciscan Third Order. Since in the 17th century the Via Sacra procession had taken place along the calle de las cruces (also known as ‘el Caminillo), with the Franciscan Third Order repairing the crosses that were destroyed or in poor condition on their way. In 1708, the Town donated the land surrounding the hermitage. In 1938, the Brotherhood made the necessary arrangements to carry out the […]\n\nThe church is an artistic and historic monumental complex. It is the tallest building and most important church in the town. The church is of staggering proportions and is located in a magnificent setting among ancestral houses. The original construction is 15th-century Gothic, however important Renaissance-style renovations were subsequently added, the most noteworthy being those to the Puerta del Perdón, which is one of the most beautiful examples of this style in Andalusia.\n\nEnrique de la Cuadra built the theatre in 1887, hence its current name. Utrera’s town council acquired the property in June 1985 and it became part of the Public Theatre rehabilitation programme ran by the Andalusian government’s Public and Cultural Works department. The architect Juan Ruesga Navarro was commissioned to undertake the renovation. Works were completed in 1993 and the theatre opened its doors to the public with one of the widest stages in Andalusia. It has an Italian horseshoe-shaped auditorium and a well-proportioned stage, which along with its other facilities, results in a lively space that promotes artistic and cultural activities in the town.\n\nThis church has received “Site of Cultural Interest” status. It has one single nave, a crossing, chapels between buttresses and a flat presbytery wall, behind which is the sacristy. The church was inaugurated in 1614; however, the yeseria plasterwork that covers the interior was included in the eighteenth century. It is magnificently decorated with paintings and murals with polychromed and gilded yeseria and an excellent collection of paintings, sculptures and carpentry, which together with the eighteenth-century organ, make this church an emblem of Écija’s Baroque. Ignacio Tomás created the portal that leads to the atrium, which is preserved from the disestablished Carmelites convent. The main altarpiece was built between 1736 and 1739. It consists of two sections, with five aisles separated by columns and estipites, and an attic, and displays sculptures of Carmelite saints. The main niche opens onto a chamber, which displays an eighteenth-century sculpture of Our Lady of Mount Carmel; the Immaculate Conception appears in the attic and is from the same century. The crossing dome is decorated with exuberant plasterwork mouldings in geometric and plant-derived forms.\n\nSan Blas church is one of the only churches in Carmona to maintain its original appearance. Peter of Castile started its construction, making use of a synagogue’s ruins. The Mudejar section was built in the sixteenth century, and the church was remodelled and the tower erected in the eighteenth century. The central nave is covered with a half-barrel vault and the side naves with a groin vault. The remarkable main retable has a Baroque layout. The Gothic chapel, built by Fernando Caro, has a delicate sexpartite vault and displays Eslava Rubio’s Jesus Christ of the Expiration sculpture. The marquetry on the sixteenth-century doors and the aquamanile found in the sacristy are both impressive.\n\nThe origin of this chapel is due to the 1780 flood. Some children were playing on the riverbank and saw a plank of wood being swept along the river. A swallow flew and rested on the plank. They went to save it and saw that the part covered by waters had the face of the Lord carved on into it. A neighbour saw the children carrying the plank out of the river, who considered it to be something of a miracle. He built a post on the spot where it was found so that the public could worship it. Years later, using the donations made, the current small chapel was built. The Chapel has a small Neoclassical altarpiece, created in 1807. Given that it is such a small space, no mass has ever been held there, except in very exceptional circumstances.\n\nSeveral sections of Écija’s medieval wall have been preserved and some of its gateways can be recognised. Of the fourteen gateways documented, four originate from the Roman layout, and therefore connect the two main roads in the town. The first road goes from east to west, from the Puerta del Puente gateway to the Puerta Cerrada gateway. It is extremely interesting given the variety of historic sites and picture-perfect spots found along its length. The Torre del Carmen tower, a stretch of wall, La Cárcel and Ciudad Real buildings, the ancient inn and stone fountain can be observed along this road and provide an evocative setting: the sound of water from the fountain, the breeze and shade from the trees and impressive buildings. The second road stretches from north to south of the town, from the Puerta de Palma gateway to the Puerta de Osuna gateway. Its location is historically interesting, given the Moorish wall ruins. This stretch once provided access to the Moorish fortified town, known as Bab Usuna. The rest of the gateways documented originated in the Almohad era, and others were later than the Christian era. Several stretches of wall have also been preserved, the most emblematic are in Calle Alcázar, Cavilla, […]\n\n18th century construction. Town’s granary, court, recruitment centre, former hospital and current retirement home and tourist information centre. Only the patio is open to the public. This space has had a long and eventful life. At the start of the 16th century, it was a brothel and tavern. In 1608, the brothel moved to the outskirts of the town and it became a theatrical courtyard. When theatrical performances were prohibited in 1731, the local government acquired the property to build the Pósito granary. After being a granary, courts, military recruitment centre and a hospital, a retirement home is currently housed there. However, its initial purpose was to be a granary. As the façade’s console states, the building was concluded in 1779.\n\nTo the south of the Cordovan countryside there is a centennial winery framed in the D.O. MONTILLA MORILES. Located in Moriles Altos, a privileged area for the quality of its albarizo soils, where nature and climate work in a special way to give us wines with their own personality. They offer visits to the winery, winery and vineyards. You can choose between tastings, personalized tastings, guided group tours, or other options. II TOUR OF GASTRONOMIC AND RURAL EXPERIENCES. 21, 22, 23, 28, 29, 30, October 2022. VISIT TO BODEGA LAGAR DE LOS FRAILES. Guided visit to the grove, the winery and the old cellar, including tasting of three unfiltered wines (vinos en rama). Reservations: (+34) 639179492 / info@lagardelosfrailes.com Price: € 12 per person.\n\nThe Vadomojón reservoir is one of the most important in the Andalusian basin. It has a capacity of 163 cubic hectometres and a surface area of 782 hectares and is located in the Albendín district,Baena. The reservoir is used to control the volume of water in the Guadajoz and Guadalquivir rivers. Some of the water is also used to irrigate the olive groves. There is a jetty and picnic area with a kiosk on the Vadomojón, as well as the installations used by the nautical club, with a pit for cleaning boats. The reservoir brings us into direct contact with the countryside and nature: the water separating the olive groves is one of its most appealing attributes. This almost virgin water is navigable, with nothing but nature for the eye to see: no buildings, electricity pylons or roads. Only nature can be heard. Vadomojón reservoir is not only a beautiful setting, it is also one of Córdoba’s most important recreational fishing locations, as it is home to large fish populations, among which are barbel, carp, black bass and trout. Nowadays, it is one of the most important fishing scenes in the province of Córdoba. Aquatic activities can be allowed as a private individual.\n\nThis Arabic fortress was rebuilt in the 13th and 14th centuries, and today its austere facade remains to remind us why it was built – to guarantee the town’s safety. It has a fortified wall, with several square towers, and one circular. At the main entrance, there is a passage with two horseshoe arches framed by a frieze, with a gateway and a channel to allow the raising and lowering of a portcullis. Until a few decades ago, the arms of the House of Aguilar were displayed above this entrance. The keep has been a national historic monument since 1943: set to one side of the main square, it is thirty metres tall – although today, some of that height is buried underground. It is square in shape, on three floors with vaulted ceilings: the lower one was used originally as a well, filled with rainwater from the roof via a network of clay pipes; the middle floor was used as a store, and the upper floor was the living quarters, embellished by four double-arched horseshoe windows, and a pillar crowned by a Mozarabic design. This tower – also called the great tower – has been dated from the second […]\n\nThe watchtower trail is a hiking trail that allows us find out more about the military architecture that surrounds Alcalá la Real. We access the two best preserved watchtowers from the town centre: Moraleja tower and Cascante tower, both located to the south of the town and declared as being a site of cultural interest. The trail passes nine watchtowers with their panels that provide directions, recommendations and descriptions with information about the border defence system surrounding the walled town of Alcalá la Real, a map of the watchtowers and information about how they were used. HISTORICAL POINTS Military strategy during the Middle Ages gave great importance to the watchtowers. They served as vantage points that informed of the enemies’ movements and their possible attacks. There is a wide network of Christian and Moorish watchtowers around Alcalá la Real, which was the key feature of the border system during the low Middle Ages, serving as a means of communication between castles and towns, such as Alcaudete, Moclín and even the Alhambra. The area’s watchtowers can be differentiated by their size, height and the constructive material. Traditionally, there was a difference between Christian and Moorish watchtowers, but at source, all were built during the height of […]\n\n16th century construction. Very reconstructed on its interior. The ducal town’s coat of arms appears on its façade. It was built over the arch of the Puerta de Teba, towards 1533. The white of its whitewashed walls is interrupted by two rows of balconies. The first is a series of arches supported by double-paired columns lined with woodwork; The second were once vantage points that looked out onto the Plaza: two long and wide verandas, which house the pink estipites with sculpted heads that support the orders of the double empty spaces that extend until the wall; Then a little lower down and creating the corner of the block, with an inclined buttress, is another house. This house has galleries with wrought iron railings instead of balconies. They are examples of 17th century domestic architecture. The balconies made the buildings’ façades lighter, giving rise to interesting shadows and allowing owners to go up and show off the views: to look at and be looked up at by the town from the Plaza. There is a version of Osuna’s coat of arms on the town hall’s colonnade.\n\nIts construction dates back to 1510-12, thanks to Pedro Fernández de Córdoba, the first marquis of Priego.It was devoted to San Esteban, but was not concluded until 1548. It is a late Gothic or Mudejar church, which was remodelled in the 18th century in Baroque style, by Jerónimo Sánchez de Rueda and later Juan de Dios Santaella. Only the hall floor plans remain of the original church. The renovation works started in 1712, which applied the same treatment as the La Asunción church: groin vaults, segmented cupolas and profound Baroque plasterwork. The main altarpiece was finished in 1781 by Juan de Dios Santaella. It consists of a bench, a first tier housing the niches for the Franciscan saints and the central chapel, which features the remarkable image of la Inmaculada, which is related to the Mora school. The ensemble is finished with a curved attic that has a central niche containing the image of San Esteban. The carving that covers it is completely rococo. The Jesús Nazareno chapel is one of Priego de Córdoba’s Baroque gems. Construction commenced in 1731 by Jerónimo Sánchez de Rueda and Juan de Dios Santaella. It has a hexagonal floor plan and features large niches, […]\n\nThe thousand-year-old holm oak is situated in the village of Llanos de Don Juan in the municipality of Rute and has been declared a Natural Monument by the Department of the Environment. It is a unique tree in the province of Cordoba, belonging to the quercus ilex (holm oak) species, with an estimated age of around four hundred and fifty years. This centenary tree is located near to Lucena and the route is accessed via the camino de los Poleares to the windmill of the same name and then continuing by forking to the left until we reach the holm oak. In 1483, the Battle of Martín González took place very near to this holm oak. The Christian troops captured the last King of Granada, Boabdil “The Boy”. Photography: Antonio J. López Rodríguez Trail map\n\nConstruction of the church began in some of the houses donated by the Álvarez family. While the works were undertaken, the hospital housed the Virgin Mary sculpture, which was transferred to the completed church in 1747. The Sisters of the Holy Cross congregation currently occupies the church. Since the beginning of the century, the nuns have used the church for public worship, reserving a small oratory for private use. The church has an elliptical floor plan and is a rare and wonderful example of Sevillian Baroque, displayed through its architectural structure rather than highly decorative elements.\n\nBenamejí Palace is a “National Monument” that has received “Site of Cultural Interest” status. Construction began at the beginning of the eighteenth century and it is considered a prime example of civil architecture from the Spanish Baroque and one of the treasures from Écija’s golden age. The vast brick façade has a stone base and a row of balconies on the first floor. It boasts two large towers on either end, which provide the monument with a certain degree of height; the impressive portal interrupts the building’s sobriety and monotony. The palace originally belonged to the marquises of Benamejí but later housed a military riding centre, and has been the Town’s History Museum since 1997. The museum exhibits several archaeological remains, including an interesting collection of prehistoric metal pieces, three warrior stelae, the “Pieza de Écija” (a unique piece of gold work from the Tartessian era), wonderful Roman mosaics and exceptional sculptures, such as the “Wounded Amazon”, and interesting collections of inscriptions, capitals, mosaics and domestic tools from the Roman and Islamic eras. Visitors are also welcome to explore the eighteenth-century Benamejí Palace stables, which house the Visual Ecuestre visitor centre: a wonderful 270° light and sound show on the world of […]\n\nThis natural spot is a perfect example of a natural spring that has been aesthetically adapted by man.The spring is typical of the Sierra de Cabra’s karst system and has great ornamental value thanks to the gardens and trees planted in its surrounds. The area has received great interest due to its scenic beauty and has been officially classified as a “site of cultural interest”, “site of natural interest” and “unique wooded area”.Fuente del Río is the source of the river Cabra and is on the border of the Sierras Subbéticas natural park, which was given this official title in 1988.\n\nConstruction started in 1794, but the current aesthetics were adopted in 1925, some years before the 1929 Ibero-American Exposition held in Seville. These transformations acquired the Andalusian regionalism style, influenced by architect Aníbal Gozález’s work. A fountain was erected in a desolate area on the outskirts of the town. It was called the Fuente de los Leones, following its remodelling during the times of Juana I. This fountain, surrounded by a stone, bench-like ledge, became a place for recreation and prompted the construction of a boulevard in the surrounding area some years later. The fountain was known as the “Plaza de Abajo” (the lower square), because the “Plaza de Arriba” (upper square) was found within the walled enclosure, the higher part of the city.\n\nIts work is articulated through weekly baskets of fresh organic products, an EcoStore, an Order Center or Collection Center for large consumers and an incipient canning factory, all managed under an Economy for the Common Good system. They offer visits to organic gardens and their facilities by reservation. II TOUR OF GASTRONOMIC AND RURAL EXPERIENCES. 21, 22, 23, 28, 29, 30, October 2022.

Reservations: (+34) 622 552 703/ comunicacion@subbeticaecologica.com Price: € 12 per person\n\nThis landmark comprises a gateway, which once cut through the ancient Jewish quarter walls, and a street. The town’s main trading area once concentrated around this small spot, which later became a hospital. Some of the town’s historians hypothesize that this site became a house for foundlings, which is when it is believed to have taken on the name “El Niño Perdido” (the lost child). The town’s archaeological studies suggest that the passageway also served as a cemetery. Private houses and restaurants now currently occupy this area.\n\nThis beautiful Renaissance fountain, called the Pilar de los Álamos, is located directly in front of Los Álamos park. It was built in 1552 and was designed by Jacobo Florentino ‘el florentín’, although he did not complete its construction. He was the predecessor of Diego de Siloé in Los Jerónimos church in Granada and both artists were considered the pioneers of Andalusian Renaissance. Historical accounts recall that this fountain once collected water from ‘La Mina’ spring, located close to the natural site Los Llanos. The fountain’s façade is made of sandstone and displays two warriors holding Alcalá’s coat of arms, protected by two griffins, mythological creatures with the body of a lion and the head and wings of an eagle, which guard treasures. These figures can also be found on other buildings in the town, as in heraldry, these imaginary beings are always related to protecting and guarding the town, a role that Alcalá la Real played for more than a century before the conquest of Granada. To this end, the inscription present on the emblem’s orle reads “key, guard and defence for the Castillian kingdoms”, the title granted to the town by the Catholic Monarchs.\n\nMarqués de las Torres palace is an example of Carmona’s 18th century palace architecture. It has an impressive portal, typical of Seville’s baroque period of the year 1700. It has two tiers: the lower tier has double Tuscan columns at each side of the door, which supports the upper balcony, framed by joint lonic columns and topped with an open triangular pediment on its decorative base. The construction’s date is inscribed over the monumental stone façade’s pediment: 1755, alongside the Quintanilla family’s coat of arms. Its extensive side façade is Late Baroque in style, and has an impressive 18th century styling with Islamic patterns that decorate the balconies’ put-log holes. The central patio has a square floor plan and the rooms are organised around it over two floors. The Interpretation centre and town museum are currently housed here. The museum displays a summary of the town’s history, from its origins to the present day. The exhibition is in chronological order and uses archaeological, ethnographic and artistic objects to narrate the town’s history pointing out its most important periods of time.\n\nThe necropolis is found in an open space, meaning that any visitor is able to access it every day for free. Many of its remains can be found in the local Archaeology Museum. If these caves had not been looted repetitively in the past, Osuna would have one of the best Roman Ceramic and Glasswork Museums in Spain. Some of the caves are separated into sections with vaulted ceilings, dug out of the rock, the walls decorated with birds. There are a large number of tombs in the ground. A series of more recent tombs can be seen from the enormous funebrial ensemble, the latest being from the Visigoth era.\n\nDominican nuns founded Santa Florentina convent in the second half of the sixteenth century, and dedicated it to Saint Florentina. The convent was later rebuilt in 1714. It currently consists of constructions from several eras, but seventeenth- and eighteenth-century structures predominate. It is therefore considered to be the oldest Dominican convent in Écija and one of the first to have existed in Andalusia. A pointed arch portal and alfiz, which leads to the torno revolving window, are preserved from the first building. The cloister or main courtyard consist of two tiers of semi-circular arches atop columns, dating back to the seventeenth century. Most of the convent’s rooms are eighteenth century, including the sacristy (1708), the refectory, the church (1714), the main portal (1759) and the bell tower. The main portal is stone and Baroque in style. It is framed by pairs of columns with mascarons and a broken pediment, which houses a niche with a statue of Our Lady of the Rosary, displaying the date 1759 on the console. The church comprises one single nave, which houses an exceptional Baroque main altarpiece. The Dominican nuns who live in the convent bake sweets and pastries, which can be bought through the torno […]\n\nThis wide park was built in 1848, under the mayorship of José Alcántara Romero and is a fine example of nineteenth-century gardening. It is home to many rare and ornamental species, such as centuries-old redwoods, slender London planes, horse chestnuts, lime trees and sycamores and countless plants (trees, bushes, perennials, annuals, etc.). Its high level of biodiversity, the unique varieties, its architectural elements (such as the central esplanade) and the park’s age, make it one of the finest green areas in Córdoba province. Furthermore, the provincial catalogue has classified it as a “Unique Garden” and “Unique tree-populated area”, being home to several “Unique Trees”.\n\nThe town’s oldest church is found in the picturesque Santa María la Mayor square, in the heart of the barrio del Cerro. The church was founded in the 17th century by the bishop of Cabra, Bacauda (prelate of Cabra, participant in the 8th Toledo Council), and offers us an usual piece. It is an altar stone (in the shape of a pilaster), which consecrates the church to Santa María on 30th May of the era 688 (650 AD) using Gothic characters. It is the oldest inscribed devotion to Mary in the diocese of Córdoba, and one of very few in Andalusia.\n\n16th-18th century. Currently no services are held here. Closed to the public. The Dominican convent of Santa Catalina Mártir was founded on May 8th, 1558, at the request of Don Juan Téllez Girón, who died the next day. The church was built during the 17th century, although the structure was transformed in the 18th century. The sacristy of the church is located opposite the entrance door and is covered by a base of 18th century tiles, of the same type used in ‘la Encarnación’ monastery, displaying scenes of hunting and bullfighting. Closed to the public.\n\nA company based in Carmona which produces aloe vera.

Guided visit to cultivation areas and […]\n\nIt was created in 1982 and is found inside the La Victoria convent. It displays archaeological materials taken from sites in and around Puente Genil, such as Los Castellares, Anzur Castle, Fuente Alamo, etc. The museum has two sections: Archaeology and Ethnography. Archaeology section Room I. Pre-history and Proto-history This room displays a collection of materials from the Pre-historic era, from the Middle Palaeolithic to Final Bronze Ages. The first collections are carved stone tools (quartzite and flint). The most outstanding are racloirs, knives and hand axes, which appeared on the river terraces of the Genil. The sample of materials is varied and unique (ceramic, polished stone, bone and metal) from Fuente del Lobo, elements that were important during the Bell Beaker culture. A 6th century BC Corinthium pot, brooches and ceramic fragments are the most impressive exhibits among the objects from the Tartessian world and their relationship with western Phoenician and Greek colonists. Iberian culture has bequeathed several pieces such as zoomorphic sculptures (bull, lioness, horse) in limestone and a series of materials; the most noteworthy being the wheel-thrown pot decorated with stripes and swirls. Room II. Ancient and Medieval ages Exhibits from the Roman world are mainly on […]\n\nThis is Puente Genil’s oldest church and was its only parish church until the second half of the 20th century. Its original location would have been due to the first repopulation that occurred in the second half of the 13th century. However, there are no remains from this era, given that it bordered with Granada’s Nasrid kingdom and this land was exposed to the Moors’ continual razzias. It is thought that the current construction must date back to the beginning of the 16th century, which is when inhabitants started to settle definitively in Pontón de Don Gonzalo. The area was named after its founder Gonzalo Yañez Dovinal. The oldest baptism registry book dates back to these early years. In addition to the three naves and some lost altarpieces of the ancient style, there is only a very modified 16th century altarpiece, which holds several painted panels and that today houses an image of the Virgen del Rosario. The altarpiece that houses the Virgen de las Angustias is the one that holds onto its ancient roots, dating back to 1640. It is baroque in style and is not polychromed, except for some small cherubs that support the Solomonic columns. The whole church ensemble was renovated […]\n\nThe Casino is more than 160 years old and opens its doors to all visitors that wish to take a rest in its wonderful and curious halls. The Casino opened its doors to members in 1848. It later extended and a theatre was built at the back, which is now belongs to the town hall and is undergoing restoration. This building has a certain colonial air about it. It has a central, square patio with foundation columns, two floors and a gallery with metal railings surrounding it. It is covered by a skylight; the walls are tiled halfway up and there is a ventilator, which hangs in the centre of the patio, over a round table, transforming it into a lounge. The whole Casino is currently a lounge; a place to rest and take it easy, reminiscent of the 19th century casinos invented for people to hold parties and be recognised. There are dance halls, marble staircases, empty dining rooms, games and meeting rooms, a cafeteria that serves breakfast and tapas and a hall that opens out onto the plaza. Members are able to make reservations.\n\nThis church was built in 1718 by Jerónimo Ramírez de Quero in line with Leonardo Antonio de Castro’s designs, an artist from Lucena of great renown. The church has a rectangular floor plan and a remarkable side with five sections, covered with a half barrel vault, except for the section next to the presbytery, which boasts a dome atop pendentives embellished with complex leaf forms around the founders’ heraldic coat of arms. The façade consists of ashlars, formed by a rectangular wall, crowned by a triangular pediment with an oculus, mirroring models inspired by the Herrerian style. The main altarpiece, dominated by the image of the Inmaculada, was constructed in 1800.It shows clear Neoclassical influences in its structure and is organised into three traditional tiers: a very elevated, lower bench, including beautifully carved and gilded geometric-style sacristy doors and a Sagrario, topped by a straight pediment, the main tier and the attic tier.It possesses many sculptures, one of the most remarkable being San Miguel, which is possibly of colonial origin.\n\nNuestra Señora del Carmen church was founded in the fifteenth century. Extremely important works were executed during the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries, and the tower was erected in 1637. A highly valuable, eighteenth-century glass case with tortoiseshell and silver overlay is on display in the Santo Sepulcro chapel. The main altarpiece is decorated with rocaille-covered columns and estipites. A sculpture of Our Lady of Mount Carmel is displayed in the central niche; her robe adorned with the same motifs as the retablo. Sculptures of Saint Theresa, Saint Mary Magdalene de’Pazzi, Saint Elisha and Saint Albert of Trapani are in the side aisles. The church also houses a considerable collection of paintings.\n\nLa Almedina means ‘town par excellence’ in Arabic and is the highest part of the town. Its streets and corners evoke times and places, typical of the Arabic era. Plaza de Marinalba is located in Baena’s Almedina, and can be accessed through the Arch of Santa Barbara, where we find the Crismón de Baena, a large Visigoth cross that symbolises Christianity, worked in bronze, which became the icon for the town’s civilisation and culture. The Plaza Palacio is the heart of Arabic and Medieval Baena, which appears to be dominated by another of the town’s most representative symbols: Baena’s Iberian Lion. It is a bronze reproduction of the original that can be found in the Archaeological Museum of Madrid. La Plaza Francisco Valverde or Plaza Vieja, pays homage to the great 19th century writer and historian Francisco Valverde y Perales who brought us the “Historia de la Villa de Baena” a book about the history of the town. The town’s most important monuments are all found in this Arab barrio, such as the Santa María la Mayor church, the Madre de Dios convent and the castle’s remains.\n\nLas Teresas convent is located in the former Condes de Palma palace, an extremely interesting Mudejar building erected during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. The convent belongs to the Discalced Carmelite nuns, who are known in the town as “Las Teresas”. It was founded in around 1630, when the Discalced Carmelites had to move to the site, which caused serious conflicts with the town’s governors who were accustomed to meeting in the palace. Works on the church were initiated in 1655 thanks to donations and Sister Paula de San José’s dowry. The monumental portal belongs to the transition from Gothic to the Renaissance with light Manueline décor, as can be observed through maritime motifs. The façade’s decoration is uncommon to this area: the Palma counts “imported” it during the fourteenth century, mimicking the style that existed on palace houses in south Portugal, where they also owned land. Some of the palace’s rooms are decorated with interesting fifteenth-century Mudejar yeseria. It is believed that they are works from the same masters who created the ones in the Royal Alcazar of Seville. The church’s entrance door features an interesting piece of Mudejar carpentry from the second half of the fourteenth century, yet […]\n\nGoing up Real Street, we find with The Mora Fountain, in front of Consolación Church. There is two hypothesis about the name: the first identified with an Islamic woman and gives rise to the legend of the love between the Moorish and Christian during the siege of the walled city. The second would refer to the fruit of the mulberry and the importance of raising silkworms was in town.\n\nThis church with its rococo design was founded in 1773 by Josefa de Mármol, and is dedicated to the icon of Virgen de las Angustias. The building was completed in 1775, and the interior decoration in 1778. The single nave has a cross-vaulted ceiling with scalloped window frames, crowned by a segmented cupola resting on a cornice. The church itself and the altarpiece are by Juan de Dios Santaella; in the principal niche is the work of the Granadan school dating from the end of the 18th century, with the figure of Christ carved by the circle of José de Mora. The magnificent figures of San José and the Virgin and Child, by the Granadan artist José Risueño from the 18th century, are particularly charming. The portal is in polychrome marble, also the work of Santaella.\n\nThe ancient Abbey Palace was reconstructed in 1781 by the Abbot Esteban Lorenza de Mendoza y Gatica, given the state of ruin of the original palace within the Fortaleza de la Mota. The new building was the end result of the aggregation of several structures, brought together by the single façade. This building was used until 1851, when the Abbey of Alcalá la Real was abolished. After years of uncertain future, it became the abbey archive and the home of the Archpriest of the Ecclesiastical Territory. Currently, and after years of restoration, the Abbey Palace is the headquarters of the Municipal Museum. This new museum was created to display, preserve and promote archaeological, ethnological, anthropological, paleontological and scientific exhibits organised into different display areas using the latest technologies.Through innovative means, the museum allows visitors to become better acquainted with Alcalá la Real’s heritage and traces of its past. It gives visitors the chance to have an overview of the town’s peculiarities, places of interest and its surrounds. Exhibition spaces: The flour room (dedicated to flour mill traditions), geology, minerals and fossils, Paleolithic, Neolithic, Copper and Bronze, Iberian world, Roman world, medieval, etc.\n\nThe Plaza de San Fernando, also known as the Plaza de Arriba, is today a wide urban space where locals meet, offering a comfortable setting to enjoy the town’s breeze, rest, wander and chat with friends. It is the heart of Carmona’s every day life, and has interestingly been so almost forever. During Roman times, this space was where the town’s two main streets -which formed Carmona’s urban network- crossed: the Cardo and the Decumanus. Furthermore, this space was not only the town’s physical centre, but also administrative, political and social centre, as that is where the forum was built. Throughout the centuries, this square has continued to be used for public acts; religious and social events have been held here, such as bullfighting, since the Modern Age. Nowadays, political and administrative matters are once more in the spotlight in this square, as the town hall is located in a former Jesuit college. It was constructed in 1621 by Pedro Sánchez, brother of the Order. The surrounding buildings in the Plaza de San Fernando boast great historic and artistic interest. There is a great variety of styles; however most the houses have one single noble floor, over the ground floor, […]\n\nIts origin dates back to 1578, with the foundation created by Francisco Álvarez de Bohórquez and his wife Catalina de Coria y Maldonado, on the condition that they accepted 12 nuns without dowries, who were blood relatives of theirs. It currently houses a community of cloistered Carmelite nuns. The architectural site dates back to the 16th century, although it subsequently underwent continual alterations. The inside of the single-naved church follows the typical model of the cloistered convents of the province, reminiscent of Medieval times. At the foot of the temple, in the last section reserved for the cloister, there is a double chancel. The altarpieces and the Main altar from the mid-18th century stand out, gilded with overlapping vegetation, even on the pilasters that separate the three aisles that form it. In their bakery, they make their specialities of homemade sponge cakes, of almonds and sultanas, which are for sale at their turntable.\n\nAlcalá la Real was an important strategic enclave since pre-historic times. The cerro de la Mota hill served as an area that controlled who or what entered the city, and became a privileged place to settle. The Fortaleza de la Mota monumental complex is strategically set on the peak of this hill, at 1033 metres altitude. These characteristics, its shape and location, lend it a predominant view, a perfect natural watchtower, that dominated several kilometres of the surrounding countryside. The Islamic conquest and initiating the castellation of the hillside, brought the continued development of the walled complex and its urban fabric. The second Lord of the Kingdom of Granada, “Aben-abus Ben-Zeiri”, ordered the construction of the La Mota castle, in around the year 1000. The Moors built a city with a layout that followed the same models as the Caliphal and Almohad eras. There would have been buildings such as the military alcazaba citadel or the mosque, of which remains can no longer be identified. However, despite the clear Al-Andalus hallmark, the fortress is today the main product of the architectural reforms that the Christians carried out after their reconquest in 1341 with Alfonso XI. The old walled city or fortress also had religious, administrative and governmental buildings, as well as shopping centres. […]\n\nLocated in the centre of the Sierras Subbéticas natural park, at 1200 m high, in an environment declared as being a “natural site of interest” given its geological, geographical and scenic interest in the area. This sanctuary is the venue for a series of romerías, or religious pilgrimages. These include the unique ‘Romería de los Gitanos’ (National Gypsy Pilgrimage), held in June and declared as being a festival of national touristic interest, when gypsies and non-gypsies come together to honour the “Majarí” in an explosion of joy and devotion; the “Baja”, on 4th September, in which the image of the Virgin is carried from the chapel to the village; and the ‘Romería del Costalero’ (the Costaleros’ Pilgrimage, costaleros referring to the men who carry the platforms bearing religious images on their shoulders in processions). In this last pilgrimage, which takes place on the first Sunday in October, the Virgin is carried back to Her chapel.\n\nThis was completed in 1892: it is worth noting that it was excavated from solid rock. There are boxes on the upper of its two levels, it can accomodate 7000 spectators, and it enjoys every facility required by modern bullfighting regulations. The opening ceremony was on August 7th, 1892: six bulls from the stables of Don Eduardo Miura were killed by Rafael Molina, known as Lagartijo, and Rafael Bejarano Torerito. Other significant dates were August 7, 1890 – with the bullring not yet completed – when the matador Rafael Guerra Guerrita fought six mature bulls from the stables of the Marquesa Viuda de Saltillo: on September 2nd 1932, a corrida was celebrated in honour of Don Niceto Alcalá-Zamora, the first president of the Second Spanish Republic, with matadors Marcial Lalanda, Manuel Bienvenida, and Domingo Ortega, against the bulls of Manuel Arranz. The corrida marking the centenary of the bullring was held on August 8, 1992, with matadors Miguel Baez Litri, Julio Aparicio, and Finito de Córdoba. Bulls from the stables of Luis Algarra Polera replaced those of the Marques de Ruchena which had been announced in the programme.\n\nThe building adjoining the church of San Pedro Mártir de Verona was the former Dominican convent founded in 1575 by the Bishop of Cordoba. In 1836, it became a national asset as a result of the decree of expulsion. It was auctioned in 1844 and Juan de Navas García took ownership of it. Before becoming municipally-owned, the building was an anise distillery, olive oil mill and winery. It still features a fantastic Mannerist arcaded courtyard with semi-circular arches and columns on a pedestal base. There is a fountain in the middle surrounded by a garden and palm trees. The building is currently being refurbished and will be turned into a multi-purpose public centre. The project has restored the central porticoed courtyard and a second rear courtyard has open green spaces for everyone’s enjoyment. The rest of the building has a versatile design for different uses, including exhibitions, teaching, social uses, meetings, etc., with a total of 11 rooms spread across three floors.\n\nThe Brotherhood House will be unveiled on January 24th and on January 31st, 2015, it will open its doors to the public. It is a large house which is worth a visit to discover its interior. Comprising several rooms, it has a reception area, a function room with audio-visual projection equipment, to give an overall idea of Holy Week in Lucena. Inside, you can also see the exhibition area, where you can enjoy interesting examples of religious art and belongings of the Brotherhood, as well as admire the three ‘pasos’ (floats) used on the Holy Tuesday processions. With this tour, the visitor will also have the opportunity to discover more first-hand about the day-to-day life of the Hermandad del Amor (Brotherhood of Love).\n\nSanta Bárbara church was originally the site of a Roman temple, upon which a Mudejar temple was constructed. Some elements from the latter construction can still be observed. It was the first church to adopt the neoclassical style in Andalusia and was designed by the Cordoban architect Ignacio Tomás. Making use of the Roman granite column shafts, he erected the original portals, which represent an unusual and rare classicism, uncommon in this area. The tower dates back to the fifteenth century and was erected over an ancient Moorish keep. It adjoins to the foot of the nave’s Gospel side next to the main façade and has remarkable brickwork. The square tower shaft houses a chapel.\n\nCompany located in Navas del Selpillar, within the municipal district of Lucena. It offers tours of the vineyards and cellars with the Montilla Moriles D.O. The estate was a wine press and some of the large concrete tanks, known in the region as ‘conos’, still remain outside. It is a mixed agricultural holding of olive groves and vineyards. In terms of the olive grove, you can find everything from century-old olive trees with 3 trunks to 3-year-old trees. The dominant varieties are the hojiblanca belonging to the Lucena olive oil PDO. The marteña or picual varieties dominate 3 of the plots of olive trees. The vineyard sits in 3 plots with a trellis system; mostly of the Pedro Ximenez variety which falls within the Montill-Moriles PDO. There are three different varieties, in red (Tempranillo), and in white (Pedro Ximenez, Moscatel Grano Menudo), as well as other varieties of table wines. They offer tours for groups and individuals.
