Asani\n\nIt is a great privilege and honor for me to write a foreword to this volume— an innovative exploration of the relationship between the aural/sonic arts and the visual/spatial arts in Muslim societies. Comprising contributions from scholars working in an array of disciplines, the collection examines how the sonic arts, such as music, shape and are shaped by the physical spaces in which they are performed. In so doing, it provides us with new perspectives on the dynamic relationship between various forms of art in cultural, sociopolitical, and religious spaces. More important, the volume’s essays demonstrate how a multisensory approach—one that combines sound with built structure, music with architecture, time with space—can lead to a deeper and more nuanced understanding of Muslim cultures. Professor Mohammed Arkoun, the influential Arab intellectual, often called for audacious, free, and productive thinking about Islam and indeed Islamicate civilizations. He writes that our understandings of Islam as a religious phenomenon are woefully inadequate since we do not pay sufficient attention to a crucial element: “silent Islam.” He defines “silent Islam” as “the Islam of true believers who attach more importance to the religious relationship with the absolute of God than to the vehement demonstrations of political movements.”1 Instead of focusing on this aspect, Professor Arkoun argues, scholarly discussions about Islam are monopolized by sociopolitical ideologies, such as Islamic revivalism. These, he claims, are in reality secular movements “disguised by religious discourse, rites, and collected behaviors.”2 Given Professor Arkoun’s definition of “silent Islam,” we may posit that these ideologies and their discourses of power, orthodoxy, and hegexiii\n\nxiv Ali S. Asani mony underlie a “loud Islam” whose voice has been greatly amplified in political, social, and cultural spaces, including the media. The arts are particularly well suited to provide us access to “silent Islam.” Historically, the vast majority of Muslims have experienced and understood their faith principally through the aural, visual, and literary arts, and they continue to do so today. Traditionally, the arts have provided important vehicles through which religious ideas and teachings are transmitted and given expression; indeed, for many Muslims, the arts aptly evoke the complexity, beauty, and aesthetic power of their faith. The arts thus constitute not only a form of religious experience but also a type of knowledge that is emotive. Most Muslims do not derive knowledge of Islam simply from a close reading of scriptures and works of theology. Instead, their knowledge is inextricably enmeshed in the experience with and production of various arts. In this regard, the arts have played a pivotal role in shaping the development of the Islamic tradition. Ultimately, Islam experienced and understood in a multisensory way through the arts is not “silent” at all. On the contrary, it is a “strong” voice, many centuries old, still confident and beautiful. Let us take, for example, the Qurʾan, which is connected in significant ways with various arts in Muslim societies. While we commonly conceive of it as a book, its verses were actually transmitted by the Prophet Muhammad to his followers not in writing but orally, as a performance—a fact reflected in its name, “The Recitation.” Early Muslim accounts provide vivid depictions of the experiential aspect of the revelation of the Qurʾan to Muhammad. If we look in particular at accounts of the first revelation, the Prophet heard these words: “Recite in the Name of Your Lord!” He then found that it was as if they had been “written on his heart.” The Qurʾan’s form and style shows great sensitivity to the poetic sensibility of Arab culture, one that prized the beauty of oral expression. Not surprisingly, Muhammad’s opponents accused him of being a poet, inspired by jinn, to which he responded by asserting that he was a prophet receiving revelation from the one God. Even though the oral revelations the Prophet received were codified as a written text after his death under the auspices of a state-­initiated project, the Qurʾan continued to be manifest as sacred sound that should be personally experienced by each individual. Its emotionally transforming and inimitable aesthetic qualities came to be seen as proof of its divine origin. For the believer, the sound of a Qurʾan recitation is immediately a personal, intel-\n\nForeword xv lectual encounter with meaning as well as an aesthetic encounter with the transcendent. The aural/oral and written forms of the Qurʾan have complemented each other in this way from the very beginning and continue to do so today. In fact, the medium through which most Muslims today interact with this holiest scripture of Islam is still sound, with the written text serving as an aide de memoire. Although some Muslims devote themselves to the art of tajwid—the rigorous study of the correct articulation and elongation of Arabic phonemes—many more encounter Qurʾanic recitation more organically, whether in the home, in the mosque, or through recordings played in markets, on buses, and in hospitals throughout many Muslim-­majority countries. Indeed, the Qurʾan is at the center of an Islamic soundscape that permeates the arts of poetry, music, and dance. Engagement with the Qurʾanic revelation, of course, is not only aural experience. Calligraphic representations of its verses grace the covers of greeting cards, appear on bumper stickers, and adorn the walls of many Muslim homes. Indeed, the arts in Islam extend beyond its central text. They appear also in architecture, pottery, film, and literature; in short, Muslims may encounter religious meaning in almost all spheres of their lives through diverse forms of art appealing to multiple senses. Although the arts provide us significant insight into the multisensory nature of Muslim devotional life, it is uncommon to find them being incorporated into the study and teaching of Islam as a religious tradition. As Professor Arkoun has pointed out, this is the result of a strong bias toward constructing Islam as a sociopolitical ideology, neglecting the Islam of faith experienced by millions of Muslims around the world every day. Frequently, artistic expressions of faith and their experiential dimensions are either dismissed or considered peripheral to the study of Islamic religion. “The arts are icing on the cake,” one scholar explained to me, while another remarked, “If I taught Islam through the arts at my university, it would not be toler­ ated—I would be laughed out of the classroom.” Notwithstanding such biases, for many years I have sought to foster literacy about Islam and Muslim societies through a multisensory approach incorporating the arts.3 Instead of following the conventional orientalist narrative of Islam as a religion of empire associated with various dynasties, my approach is premised on the notion that religion as a cultural phenome-\n\nxvi Ali S. Asani non is intricately embedded in and constantly being shaped and reshaped by various interrelated contexts—political, social, economic, literary, and artistic. We therefore need multiple lenses through which to understand its multivalent social and cultural influences.4 Employing the arts as the primary lens to study Islam and Muslim cultures allows students not only to appreciate their seminal role in the tradition but also to situate them within historical and sociopolitical contexts. For example, it enables students to question widely prevalent conceptualizations of Qurʾan as scripture based on assumptions of Christian theology and Old Testament scholarship in particular. I also employ a broad range of artistic expressions to discuss notions of the sacred, authority, theology, and mysticism, as well as issues affecting contemporary Muslim societies, such as colonialism and its aftermath, reform and revival movements, and globalization. Through such discussions, the students learn that the arts often play a subversive role in societies and become powerful means of expressing dissent by critiquing constructions of orthodoxy and power. Since I encourage students to respond to the course material through creative assignments that engage them in making art, they come to realize that the arts, as they are both experienced and practiced, are “irreplaceable instruments of knowledge.”5 In embracing this arts-­based pedagogic approach, I have been inspired by the work of my own teacher, the late Professor Annemarie Schimmel, who introduced me to the potential of the arts as lenses for understanding Muslim societies. During her distinguished career, she was widely recognized and honored by universities, governments, and civic organizations for promoting better understanding of Islam and Muslim cultures. Professor Schimmel’s scholarship and teaching about Islam straddled and explored the intricate and complex relationships among many distinct fields (including history of religion, phenomenology, theology and mysticism, numerology, languages and literatures, and Islamic art history). Since she was fluent in several languages—including Arabic, Persian, Turkish, Urdu, and Sindhi—and had lived and traveled extensively in different Muslim-­ majority countries, she developed an intimate familiarity with different aspects of Muslim cultures. A strong advocate of the power of the arts to educate and transform, she endorsed the perspective of the German philosopher Johann Herder (d. 1803), who wrote, “From poetry we learn about eras and nations in much greater depth than through the deceitful and miserable ways of political and military war-­histories.”6 During a speech she delivered\n\nForeword xvii at a March 1996 ceremony where she was awarded the 1995 Peace Prize of the German Book Trade (Friedenspreis des Deutschen Buchhandels) for her achievements in generating understanding between East and West, Professor Schimmel cited the importance of poetry in her own development as a scholar: I have discovered Istanbul corner by corner through the verses which Turkish poets had sung for five centuries about this wonderful city; I have learnt to love the culture of Pakistan through the songs that resound in all of its provinces, and when one of my Harvard students had the misfortune to be among the American hostages in Tehran, he experienced a great change in his jailers’ attitude when he recited Persian poetry; here, suddenly, a common idiom emerged and helped to bridge deep ideological differences.7 She published more than a hundred books in English and German, many of which were translations and commentaries on Arabic, Persian, Turkish, Urdu, and Sindhi poetry. Here she followed the model of her hero, the Romantic poet and orientalist Friedrich Rückert, for whom world poetry offered a means of global reconciliation and peace. Like Rückert, she also wrote her own poetry, in German as well as in English, often in an orientalized style inspired by Rumi, the poet-­philosopher Sir Muhammad Iqbal, and many of the Sufi folk poets of South Asia. Professor Schimmel was firmly convinced of the potential of not only poetry but also other forms of art, particularly calligraphy, as pedagogic bridges to approach the study of Islam and Muslim societies. While Professor Schimmel’s engagement with the arts focused on the appreciation of their religious and literary dimensions, the strength of this volume is that it significantly expands the discussion to the sociocultural dimensions by drawing on various disciplines such as sociology, history, art history, ethnomusicology, and anthropology. This multidisciplinary approach focused on the arts is a particularly important contribution, for it pro­jects the fostering of literacy into a broader civilizational framework, recognizing the pluralistic dimensions of Muslim civilizations and their multiple identities. It plays a key role in dismantling unidimensional discourses about Muslim societies—discourses often steeped in the polarizing and dehumanizing language of civilizational superiority, nationalism, and patriotism, premised on the notion of the Muslim as “the other.”\n\nxviii Ali S.

It aims to open a pioneering and productive forum for academic fields and domains of intellectual reflection that have rarely been in dialogue, showing the possibilities offered by such an exchange for a greater understanding of both musical/aural experiences and built environments. The collection brings together a unique array of scholars, contributing perspectives from ethnomusicology, anthropology, art history, architecture, history of architecture, religious studies, and Islamic studies. The book centers on Islamic contexts. We regard Islam as a broad historical, religious, and sociopolitical milieu of considerable complexity and diversity. Rather than a preconfigured category or “value system” determining the interpretive grid of our analyses, Islam is here explored from the ground up as we scrutinize the specificity of a wide range of socio-­cultural, historical, and geographical settings. At the same time, the present collection of essays reflects a keen interest in shared historical linkages and heritages, as well as coherent sociocultural traits across the Muslim world. These commonalities are of great significance for a multiauthored exploration of the music-­ architecture nexus by enabling meaningful connections to be drawn. In particular, the volume explores and lays specific emphasis on the centrality of sound production in built environments in Muslim religious and cultural expression, as exemplified by the intimate relationship between prominent 1\n\n2 Michael Frishkopf and Federico Spinetti Muslim sonic performances, such as the recitation of the Qurʾan or devotional songs, and core Muslim architectural spaces, ranging from mosques and Sufi shrines to historic aristocratic villas, gardens, or traditional gymnasia. In the process, we approach Islam as an ideal site for theoretical investigations of the general relationship between sound and architecture and, in parallel, propose this relationship as an innovative and particularly significant angle from which to explore Muslim cultures. We live in and through architecture, and we live in and through sound, usually simultaneously. What is more, architecture is not only an eminently spatial and visual configuration but also a temporal, auditory, and social one: we access and inhabit architectural spaces in time, and we experience and evaluate architectural structures through hearing, listening, and aural communication within them. Conversely, music and sound utterances are not only eminently temporal and auditory phenomena but also spatial and visual ones: they guide our orientation and positioning; they demarcate social spaces; they are performed according to specific spatial and visual arrangements among participants in sonic events; they may evoke visual narratives or be experienced visually as gesture and bodily movement. Music and architecture thus emerge as interlinked temporal-­spatial phenomena, affording coordinates for intersubjective meaning creation, as well as behavioral and performative interaction. The volume considers sonic performances broadly conceived as “aesthetically meaningful”—ranging from poetry recitation to art, folk, popular, and ritual musics, as well as religious sonic utterances not usually labeled “music” from an Islamic perspective—in relation to built environments broadly conceived as encompassing monumental, vernacular, ephemeral, and landscape architectures, interior design, decoration and furniture, urban planning, and geography. Here, the study of architecture moves beyond the analysis of physical structures to consider the social interactions, historical narratives, and cultural meanings that architecture defines, demarcates, or enables. In exploring the sociocultural dimensions of the sound-­space nexus, this volume is concerned both to elaborate theory and to ground it in specific ethnographic and historical evidence. We bring together research projects concentrating on selected regions and musical/sonic traditions of the Islamic world, highlighting the diverse area expertise of our contributors and offering a variety of ethnographic and historical perspectives while secur-\n\nIntroduction 3 ing thematic consistency through the study of related cultural settings. In this way, the book aims at offering a significant contribution to scholarly discourse across anthropology, ethnomusicology, Islamic studies, art history, and architecture. In particular, it sets out to provide ethnomusicology with a groundbreaking, in-­depth study of the relationship between music and the built environment, while offering the field of architecture a unique perspective on music that goes beyond the usual concerns with architectural acoustics or formal homomorphisms between visual and auditory domains. The book fills a gap in both scholarly architectural and music studies. In addressing the relationship between music and place, ethnomusicological scholarship has interpreted “place” primarily as a dimension of cultural and territorial belonging,1 often without considering music as a social and symbolic practice operating in concrete, material environments. On the other hand, scholarship devoting attention to music and architecture has predominantly focused on architectural acoustics,2 or on symbolic and structural analogies viewed from the perspectives of music criticism, music composition, or architectural design,3 without full consideration of the sociocultural aspects of the relationship between music performance and the architectural frames in which it takes place. Building on and moving past this literature, we propose a mediation between emerging new directions in both architectural and music studies. On the one hand, we recapture anthropological antecedents in the cultural study of architecture4 and further look with particular interest at architectural theory that both problematizes the traditional understanding of architecture as an essentially visual art and explores the multisensory dimensions of built environments,5 including aural perception.6 On the other hand, we detect in various contemporary streams of music scholarship a fruitful growing interest, beyond music per se, in auditory cultures and soundscapes at large and in aurality and hearing as forms of intersubjective action in, and knowledge of, the world,7 with a few noteworthy contributions including a consideration of architectural spaces, landscapes, and urban geography.8 By bringing these various theoretical streams and disciplinary approaches together, we intend to illuminate making music and living in buildings as profoundly interconnected social activities and the relationship between them as directly affecting the ways in which both humanly organized sounds and humanly organized spaces are experienced and interpreted. Our theoretical frameworks are eclectic, drawing on a variety of perspec-\n\n4 Michael Frishkopf and Federico Spinetti tives and disciplines, and geared toward the exploration of broad classes of research problems. Three recurrent research themes, however, trace their way across chapters, disciplines, and areas. The first theme involves the relationship between cultural meanings encoded aurally in musical (and, more generally, sonic) performances, on the one hand, and, on the other, cultural meanings encoded visually and spatially in architecture (and, more generally, the built environment), especially the ways in which meanings of sonic performance color architectural meaning and vice versa.9 Here, moving from the contribution of studies highlighting the multiple sociocultural and ideological dimensions of the arts and architecture in the Middle East,10 we look at theoretical paradigms from music semiotics11 and from the semiotics of architecture12 as a means to explore how these ostensibly distinct processes of signification come to be combined in architecturally framed performance events and to examine their intersections in terms of correspondences and complementarities, as well as dissonances and tensions. Drawing from performance theory and phenomenology,13 especially as applied to ritual and performance,14 we view musical meanings as situational and their relationship to architectural meanings as dependent on processes of embodiment, symbolization, and ritualization, as well as of negotiation and interpretation on the part of performers and participants. The second pervasive theme comprises the implications of music performance practices for the ways in which architectural space is constructed, perceived, and experienced socially and pragmatically, as well as the bearings of architecturally framed space on the socio-­communicative interactions of participants in sonic events. Here, architecture is viewed as an eminently social space that affords possibilities, poses constraints, and provides frames for specific social transactions. Germane to our discussion of the ways in which specific architectural spaces define possibilities for interaction within participatory musical performances are perspectives from nonverbal communication theory,15 proxemics,16 and symbolic interaction theory,17 as well as studies directly concerned with architecture.18 Social network theory provides another general paradigm for thinking about how communicative networks are established in performance under architectural constraints.19 The third theme concerns the politics of socio‐architectural landscapes and their implications for musical life, situating the sound‐architecture nexus in broader historical, sociopolitical, and economic contexts across the\n\nIntroduction 5 Muslim world. Here, besides drawing on broadly critical social theory,20 we look at the sociology of architecture,21 as well as recent scholarly explorations of the politics of Islamic auditory cultures,22 to situate musical life within the distribution of architectural complexes, the related social articulation of built environments, and the economic and political dimensions of urban and human geographies. Working within—and beyond—this framework, the authors represented in this volume investigate how architecture as a material and social phenomenon shapes the social processes and meanings of sound and music, and—conversely—the ways in which sonic performances condition architecture’s form and social meaning, tracing new pathways toward the study of the interconnections between humanly organized sound and humanly organized space. Some chapters, particularly those grounded in historiographic inquiry, examine visual representations of music or (sung) poetry in the figurative arts, often together with an inspection of their represented architectural settings. Here, songs featuring poetic representations of built environments and landscapes may complement in reverse these intertextual references. While a few chapters detect structural correspondences between spatial and sonic phenomena—for example, through the mirroring of geometric notions and poetic prosody, or the aurality inherent in the formal composition of manuscript pages—many of the authors highlight, across locales and epochs, the multiple intersections of sound and architecture at the level of semiosis (whether iconic, indexical, or symbolic/metaphorical). A rich array of culturally and socially significant referents are here implicated, ranging from social status and gender, to political and identity struggles, to modernist and nationalist ideologies, to religious and ethical discourses linked to Islamic philosophy, Sufism, or other localized belief systems. Other chapters focus on the music-­architecture nexus on an experiential and pragmatic level, considering the performative interaction of spatial configurations and sonic utterances in a variety of contexts. Contributions from art history here converge with anthropologically informed studies in underscoring the multisensory and performative dimensions of built environments as an essential complement to the study of “solid” architectural frameworks. While this book does not attempt to be encyclopedic in either disciplinary or global coverage, it is nonetheless topically and methodologically wide-­ ranging and aims to provide a multifaceted representation of the sound–­\n\n6 Michael Frishkopf and Federico Spinetti built environment nexus in the Islamic world. It is organized in six sections covering broad geo-­cultural areas and highlighting interdisciplinary cross-­pathways. In part one, “Transregional,” the historian of Islamic art and architecture D. Fairchild Ruggles’s “Listening to Islamic Gardens and Landscapes” investigates the multisensory ecology of domesticated, designed natural environments from a variety of epochs across the Islamic world. Setting her discussion as a broader critique of the traditional visualist bias in the fields of art and architectural history, Ruggles calls for renewed attention to other senses, alongside sight, as constitutive of the human experience of built environments, thus advocating a full recognition that “the study of architecture has always required a study of space, which always exceeds visual perception and invites consideration of the body in space.” The author focuses on historic Islamic gardens and highlights the importance of an examination of aural, olfactory, and tactile sensations, in addition to visually apprehended architectural forms, in understanding and reconstructing their sensorial and experiential dimensions. Turning specifically to aurality, she sets out to trace historical evidence of sound events in Islamic gardens. Part two, “The Ottoman Empire and Turkey,” begins with the art and architecture historian Nina Ergin, who argues for the importance of sound in understanding the social meaning of sixteenth-­century Istanbul mosque architecture. In her chapter, “A Sound Status among the Ottoman Elite: Architectural Patrons of Sixteenth-­Century Istanbul Mosques and Their Recitation Programs,” mosque architectural forms—eminent spatial and visual markers in Istanbul’s urban landscape—and Qurʾanic recitation programs— distinctive aural phenomena animating the soundscape of those mosques— emerge as equally significant statements of social status for Ottoman architectural patrons. In a society as highly regulated along social ranks as was the Ottoman, decorum dictated that an architectural patron be wary of supporting buildings that, because of site, size, construction materials, or structural and decorative features, exceeded the patron’s position on the social ladder. Ergin illustrates how, in this economy of status, the employment of Qurʾan reciters “constituted a significant element of Ottoman mosque architecture, as much as domes, minarets, decorative tiles, and calligraphic inscriptions.” By inspecting the endowment charters and the recitation programs of fourteen mosques, built in Istanbul by the sixteenth-­century imperial master ­architect Mimar Sinan, Ergin shows how sonic parameters allowed a cer-\n\nIntroduction 7 tain flexibility in the patrons’ display of status, often consolidating, but to a certain extent also deflecting, the hierarchy of prestige encoded by architectural forms. In his chapter “A Concert Platform: A Space for a Style in Turkish Music,” the ethnomusicologist John Morgan O’Connell traces the impact of architectural space on musical style, delineating how both are implicated in complex, often contradictory, discourses of tradition, modernity, and Westernization that have bedeviled many newly formed nation-­states throughout the twentieth century. O’Connell explores the emergence of large concert halls in nineteenth- and early twentieth-­century Turkey as platforms for concert performance, venues not only for importing musical styles such as opera but also for presenting and transforming local styles. In particular, his chapter traces the career of musician Münir Nurettin Selçuk (1899–1981) alongside the socio-­architectural history of Istanbul’s Fransız Tiyatrosu (“French Theater”), founded in the mid-­nineteenth century. O’Connell cogently demonstrates the impact of changing architectural spaces on alaturka (Turkish classical music, traditionally performed in more intimate venues) by examining the strategies by which Selçuk selected from and adapted to a series of Western-­style concert halls, marked by different architectural features and built for different musical purposes, positioning musical and architectural styles within the broader discourses of an emerging Turkish modernity. The ethnomusicologist Irene Markoff ’s chapter, entitled “Articulating Otherness in the Construction of Alevi-­Bektași Rituals and Ritual Space in a Transnational Perspective,” focuses on the portability of Alevi rituals and the mobility of ritual specialists and sacred objects (including musical instruments), all supporting a tenacious, fluid, and flexible Alevi identity largely independent of fixed structures. Alevis have historically feared persecution and perforce have practiced their faith clandestinely. They have learned to sanctify available space through adaptive, evanescent performance: highly affective sacred sound—language and music—and movement rather than through more durable, physical architecture or printed texts. In this way, minority and diasporic Alevi communities, whether residing in Turkey, Bulgaria, or Canada, can be locally empowered and globally connected, despite political oppression, rapidly shifting sociocultural climates, or migration. Markoff illuminates the resilience of Alevi-Bektași ritual through such spatial reconfigurations, as tied to a developing transnational network. Poetics of ritual is thus linked to politics of space, constructed through sacred move-\n\n8 Michael Frishkopf and Federico Spinetti ment, sung poetry, and the bağlama lute, known as the “stringed Qurʾan” and deeply symbolic of the community and its beliefs. In part three, “The Arab World,” the ethnomusicologist Michael Frishkopf, in “Venerating Cairo’s Saints through Monument and Ritual: Islamic Reform and the Rise of the Architext,” contrasts architectural and sonic ritual veneration of saints in Islam. The saints, or awliyāʾ, are venerated architecturally through construction and maintenance of a shrine, while ritual veneration takes place through shrine visitation and a musical liturgy (ḥaḍra). Frishkopf asks: What is the relation between these two forms of veneration, and under what conditions does the balance shift from one to the other? During most of Egyptian history, they coexisted harmoniously, but more recently they have begun to conflict, the former ascendant, the latter in decline. Taking the Cairo shrine of Sidi ʿAli Zayn al-­ʿAbidin as a case study, the author interprets the current decline of its ḥaḍra as representing a general shift from (1) dynamic, performative Islamic traditions, carried by people, transmitted orally, and adapting locally to forge a ramified, affective religious culture and localized social solidarities, toward (2) a more static, uniform, religious culture, carried by durable objects such as texts and architecture, which does not adapt but remains fixed, standardized, and standardizing and thus open to transnational connections, detaching from local culture toward a common, globalized Islam. The author calls this textual-­architectural formation the “architext,” arguing that its increasing dominance reflects a quest for political unification and empowerment of the global umma in order to confront power imbalances of the postcolonial world. Also in part three, the anthropologist Jonathan H. Shannon’s chapter, “Nightingales and Sweet Basil: The Cultural Geography of Aleppine Song,” offers a phenomenological contribution to sound, architecture, and nostalgia, one that is particularly poignant in the wake of Aleppo’s wholesale destruction since 2011. The author demonstrates the interrelation of soundscapes and the built environment, showing how music can induce a sense of longing for lost sonic and architectural spaces while fostering a critical engagement with the forces of modernity shaping the present. In this way, music helps pave the way for modernity by maintaining connections to sounds and places of the past. The author explores Aleppo’s three zones (old city, new city, and peri-­urban area), attending to the ways soundscape and built environment converge to reflect and shape cultural meaning, social life, and the distribution of power. Next, he reflects on sensory meanings of the\n\nIntroduction 9 old city and delineates how soundscape (including both musical and nonmusical phenomena) and built environment authenticate each other in the auditory and visual domains, along with other sensory modalities. Finally, he discusses the qudūd ḥalabiyya, a traditional genre of Aleppine song, as a “sonic marker of authenticity,” drawing out what he calls the “cultural geography of song” to illustrate how the qudūd evoke nostalgia for a disappearing sonic-­ spatial world, an object of contemporary longing as a hallmark of modernity. Finally, in “Aural Geometry: Poetry, Music, and Architecture in the Arabic Tradition,” the architecture historian and Islamic studies scholar Samer Akkach examines the intersection of geometric, prosodic, and musical notions in medieval Islamic theorization. Through a focus on the prosodic system codified by the eighth-­century linguist al-­Khalil bin Ahmad al-­Farahidi, the author inspects the Islamic tradition of visual representation of prosodic cycles in circular diagrams and the ensuing translation of auditory patterns into geometrical ones. Drawing on a wider Islamic scholarly tradition, he highlights how this geometrical understanding of classical Arabic poetry is foundational for the closely related theorization and representation of musical rhythmic cycles. Akkach further interrogates this poetic-­musical-­ geometric nexus in relation to the spatial structures of Islamic architecture. Here, lexical and conceptual analogies between musico-­poetic and architectural domains testify to a semantic field imbued with metaphorical resonances between (sung) poetry and architecture. But, whereas a “geometrical and mathematical imagination . . . lay at the heart of classical Arabic poetry and music,” we have very little evidence of corresponding equivalences between prosody and architecture for any level beyond the metaphorical, such as the formal or structural. Rather, the author argues, it is in philosophical discourse that music and architecture most directly converge, mediated by a common interpretive frame provided by the Platonic notions of harmony and beauty as recaptured and elaborated in medieval Islamic Neoplatonic thought. Part four, “Andalusia and Europe,” opens with the Islamic art historian Cynthia Robinson’s “Tents of Silk and Trees of Light in the Lands of Najd: The Aural and the Visual at a Mawlid Celebration in the Alhambra,” offering a study of the festivities for the commemoration of Prophet Mohammad’s birthday (mawlid) in 1362 CE at the Alhambra palace, in Granada. Through a close reading of the fourteenth-­century Andalusian scholar Lisan al-­Din Ibn al-­Khatib’s account of the proceedings of the celebration, Robinson re-\n\n10 Michael Frishkopf and Federico Spinetti constructs the complex resonances between poetic symbolism and style, architectural design, and sonic performance playing into the experience of the event’s participants. Robinson inspects the elaborate lighting devices adorning the open patio that was part of the carefully designed celebration setting and discusses the centrality of sonic performances in the ritual proceedings. Here, alongside Qurʾanic recitation and dhikr chants, a prominent role was assigned to sung odes (qaṣīdas) composed for the occasion. Robinson’s analysis of the intertextual ties between lighting-­architectural mise-­en-­scène and musico-­poetic performance, mediated by a shared universe of religious and mystical associations centered on the Prophet Muhammad, points to the actual sensory—visual and aural—experience of attendees at the mawlid, an experience that, by virtue of its manifold meaningful evocations, spurred them to ecstatic responses in what emerges as one specific, and at the same time emblematic, mystical séance in fourteenth-­century Arab Andalusia. Next, in her chapter entitled “Aristocratic Residences and the Majlis in Umayyad Córdoba,” the Islamic art historian Glaire D. Anderson investigates the social and material dimensions of elite residences of tenth-­century Umayyad Andalusia, particularly those of Córdoba’s royal citadel and the villa of al-­Rummaniyya. Grounding her discussion in historical sources as well as in the analysis of architectural frameworks and decorations, she uncovers the experiential and sensorial combination of visual, spatial, and auditory elements at the majlis, a term that in medieval Andalusia designated aristocratic musical gatherings as well as the reception halls that hosted them. The author argues that a consideration of music performance is key both to elucidating the historical function of reception spaces, their furnishings, and their decorations and, more generally, to “an enhanced understanding of how architecture and landscape worked in concert with material culture and social behavior in the context of the majlis in Umayyad Córdoba.” Anderson considers the diverse social composition of majlis gatherings in terms of gender and legal status, noting the prominence of female slave musicians and singers performing for an audience of male guests. This gender distribution is significant for the interpretation of certain structural features of reception hall architecture. Drawing from Ibn Khaldun, Anderson further highlights the visual impact of bodily gestures of music performance as integral to the aesthetic appreciation of majlis participants. More generally, she delineates a multilayered sensory experience at the Córdoban majlis that binds together architectural frameworks and forms, including decora-\n\nIntroduction 11 tive motifs and textiles, landscape and garden sights, and auditory as well as visual musico-­poetic signs. Closing this part is the anthropologist Paul A. Silverstein’s chapter, “Sounds of Love and Hate: Sufi Rap, Ghetto Patrimony, and the Concrete Politics of the French Urban Periphery.” Here, the author shows how the built environment of gritty lower-­class French suburbs, the banlieues—housing ethnically and religiously diverse communities, and expressly designed to repress cultural, social, and religious differences deemed incompatible with French state secularism—shapes subjectivities that are both expressed and reinforced in musical soundscapes that “re-­spatialize” the banlieue, constructing aesthetic and social value out of the banlieue’s dilapidated forms. Yet the relation between built environment and soundscape is anything but deterministic; indeed, there is a reciprocal and dialogical relation between them, producing contrastive musical styles. One such style is hardcore “gangsta” hip-­hop, expressing a “hypermasculine ‘ghetto patrimony’” of streetwise street life, full of hatred, despair, and sharp political critique, stemming from institutionalized oppressions of class, gender, and race, but with little relation to religious identities. Contrasting to this hardcore style is an emerging Islamic music, especially Sufi hip-­hop, offering spiritual love, hope, solace, and peace, in deliberate contrast to the violent, irreligious “gangsta” ethos. Sufi music—more transnational (via connections provided by global Sufi orders), more acceptable to authority (because it is anti-­extremist), but still rooted in the particularities of Muslim life in the banlieue—delivers a completely different vision, even though gangsta and Sufi rappers emerge from the same built environment. Part five, “Central and South Asia,” begins with “Ideal Form and Meaning in Sufi Shrines of Pakistan: A Return to the Spirit,” by the architect Kamil Khan Mumtaz. Adopting a Sufi Islamic position centered on Divine Reality, the author elucidates how both music and architecture in Islam express a common spiritual core, with particular reference to examples drawn from architectural and musical practices associated with Sufi tomb-­shrines in Pakistan. The author highlights the centrality of the performing and plastic arts in Sufi ritual and devotional practice. For the Sufi, the highest form of worship is iḥsān, a word whose root form evokes the term meaning “beauty” (ḥusn). To create beauty is thus an act of both worship and invocation. But beauty is reflected rather than created; its degree depends on the extent to which a work exhibits Divine principles. While the possible range of sensible\n\n12 Michael Frishkopf and Federico Spinetti manifestations of these Divine principles is infinite, their source is essentially one. For this reason, traditional Muslim artists—whether musicians or architects—copy preexisting models; truly original creation of beauty is impossible, because God is always the source. Rather, the traditional arts support a spiritual quest for perfection, as a mirror reflecting Divine qualities and a ground for contemplating them. Congruence between music and architecture, as with other traditional Islamic arts, stems from deeper unifying principles and a common spiritual source. For Mumtaz, therefore, interarts relationships are essentially “vertical” and spiritual, not “horizontal” and sensory. The following chapter, “The Social and Sacred Microcosm of the Kiiz Üi: Space and Sound in Rituals for the Dead among the Kazakhs of Mongolia,” by the ethnomusicologist Saida Daukeyeva, pre­sents an ethnographic study of funeral and commemorative lamentations (joqtau) among Muslim Kazakh seminomadic pastoralists in contemporary western Mongolia. Performed by female relatives of the deceased according to musically and poetically consistent formulas, lamentations are part of elaborate ritual proceedings taking place in the ephemeral vernacular architecture of the transportable yurt (kiiz üi). The author investigates the consonances between built environment and sonic performances of mourning, tracking their “dual spiritual-social significance” for ritual participants. Ethnographic evidence suggests that both the yurt’s material configuration and these lamentations are replete with highly significant religious and cosmological meanings that relate directly to Kazakh beliefs about death, which display an integration of Islamic and indigenous shamanic elements. Daukeyeva further illustrates how codified spatial dispositions within the yurt, including the arrangement of objects and proxemic relations among participants, as well as the unfolding of social transactions among ritual participants by means of intoned lamentations and opportune movements in space, are of paramount importance in enacting social relations and responsibilities, including hierarchies along the lines of gender, seniority, and status. In her discussion, Daukeyeva thus addresses both the symbolic and the behavioral-­performative interaction of spatial/ visual and sonic/aural elements in ritual proceedings, highlighting how their interpenetration is instrumental in sustaining cosmological, religious, and societal notions in the Mongolian Kazakh community. “Listening to Pictures in Iran,” the title of the chapter by the Islamic art and architecture historian Anthony Welch that opens part six, “Iran,” indicates his implicit premise: that the history of figurative visual art—as found\n\nIntroduction 13 in paintings, illuminated manuscripts, on the surfaces of functional objects such as bowls, or as inscribed on buildings—is not silent; rather, it evokes sound symbolically, through portrayals of musicians, instruments, and performance practices. In addition, such visual music is doubly located in relation to the built environment: the artwork itself is spatially located within a real built environment, and the artwork portrays musical practices and built environments together. Through fanciful, stylized musical imagery—sometimes illuminating manuscripts that likewise speak of music and sometimes ornamenting architectural surfaces or objects placed within them—the scholar learns much, not only about musicians and musical practices, their social contexts, and their relation to the built environment, but also—through reading artistic style—about musical attitudes, meanings, and values in social, political, and religious arenas. From Welch’s chapter, one begins to understand that “listening to pictures” may provide more cultural information than the musical sound itself, despite the ostensible silence of such visual arts, and is in any case crucial for unearthing musical meanings of a silent past. Figurative visual arts thus emerge as key for understanding architecturally emplaced soundscapes throughout history, with important implications for the broader political, social, and theological understanding of Islamic culture. For instance, his analysis clearly underscores the centrality of elaborate music, in conjunction with magnificent royal court architecture, for a Muslim monarch’s prestige and reputation and for the construction of the broader aristocratic class. On the other hand, in some cases it also appears that silent visual music could displace sounded music, as when the latter is deemed to contravene Islamic law (for instance under the later reign of Shah Tahmasp). Through his detailed investigation of Persian relief sculptures and illuminated manuscripts, especially from the Timurid and Safavid periods, the author highlights the relation of music and the built environment and the significance of both throughout Persian history. Finally, the ethnomusicologist Federico Spinetti’s “Of Mirrors and Frames: Music, Sound, and Architecture at the Iranian Zūrkhāneh” offers an ethnographically based study of the complex relationship between sonic performance and auditory experience, athletic practice, and built environment in the traditional Iranian gymnasium known as zūrkhāneh. The author considers the ways in which the unique architectural and interior design features of zūrkhāneh gymnasia relate to both musical-­poetic content and\n\n14 Michael Frishkopf and Federico Spinetti athletic exercises in a web of symbolic correspondences that articulate the tenets of the zūrkhāneh ethos. This referential mirroring of musical and architectural texts is key to the creation of meaning on the part of gymnasia affiliates. Moving beyond the symbolic dimension, Spinetti construes architecture as a frame for communicative and performative interaction. The author illustrates the spatial articulation of sound and movement, contending that architectural frames and the disposition of social actors within them are essential to the unfolding of performative interactions in the musico-­athletic practice of the zūrkhāneh; conversely, he explores the sonic articulation of space, arguing that sonic events are central to the ways in which zūrkhāneh gymnasts interact meaningfully with the built environment. Through this symbolic-­referential as well as pragmatic-­performative exploration of how sound and material environment are experienced conjointly, the author proposes “a multisensory approach to both architecture and music, beyond the confines of putatively discrete auditory and visual or spatial domains.”\n\nNotes 1 For a seminal study, see Stokes 1994a; see also Feld and Basso 1996 and, for similar perspectives from popular music studies, Whiteley et al. 2004. 2 See for example Beranek 1979 and 1992; Forsyth 1985; Thompson 2002; Howard and Moretti 2009; Kronenburg 2012. 3 See Waterhouse 1921; Kompridis 1993; Young et al. 1993; Martin 1994; Xenakis 2008; Grueneisen 2003.

Fairchild Ruggles\n\nLike all gardens, those built in the Islamic world from the seventh century CE to the present, from the Alhambra in Spain to the Taj Mahal in India and modern gardens such as Azhar Park in Cairo, were and are fully sensory environments. Vision was the foremost of the senses attracted to the garden. Poetry and botanical texts tell us that the plants were diverse and the color palette was vibrant with brightly hued blooms. Arabic, Persian, and Turkish writers of the past admired the rich yellow of the lily and the deep red of the rose; when extolling the beauty of a landscape or a garden, they lavished so much praise on the contrast of white marble architecture against a backdrop of green that it became a poetic cliché. In those cases, it was not nature itself that was admired but the firm establishment of humankind in nature, taming it, making it productive and orderly, and giving it meaning. The relationship between Islamic society and nature is a sensory one in which the impact of nature—almost always in its domesticated garden form—was measured in human terms. In addition to a visual component, sensory contact included smell. Islamic poetry is rich with references to fragrant plants, spices, and perfumes, and garden manuals list hundreds of plants that had pungent or sweet scents. Sensory contact also included the tactile experience of touching textured surfaces, of feeling the cool spray of water, of moving within the garden, and of shifts from hot sunlight to cool shade. Finally, the sensory perception of the garden occurred through its sounds, celebrated in poetry where a nightingale’s song, the splashing of a fountain, or the murmuring of foliage riffled by a breeze can still be heard. 19\n\n20 D. Fairchild Ruggles In trying to recapture the missing sensory experiences, one must work against the grain of traditional practices of art and architectural history, where the scholarship of the discipline has focused on vision to the exclusion of other senses. To explain why this is so, it helps to examine art history’s roots. As a field first of aesthetic judgment and appreciation, and later of critical analytical study, art history began with painting and sculpture and addressed the challenge of decoding meaning from representations that are, by virtue of being representations, not the thing that they represent.1 For art history to complete its task, the split between the thing and the representation that stands for it is a necessary precursor. Precisely how representation occurs in the visual field had been studied by Erwin Panofsky in the early twentieth century.2 But the terms of engagement were dramatically changed when the visual field became not simply a spatial stage but a psychoanalytic field wherein subjectivity and objectivity were defined as positions. Lacanian psychoanalytic theory in the 1970s and 1980s explained subjectivity as emerging from the eternal, unbridgeable gap between self and otherness, imagined as reality (designated as the Real)—but a Real that is forever unknowable.3 The photography historian John Tagg explained it thus: “In relation to Lacan’s discussion of vision . . . it is clear that the Real is what cannot be encountered. It is what the eye must shield itself against and, indeed, it is in the recoil from this unwelcome, scorching encounter that the split occurs from which the subject emerges, separated from the world as object, but hanging on its loss, for which the elusive object of the look’s desire will henceforth stand.”4 These inquiries into representation, perspective, subjectivity, and the Real relied on a visual experience of the world, and it is not mere coincidence that some art history programs at that time—anxious to separate themselves from the older art historical practices of connoisseurship, formalism, and stylistic analysis—renamed themselves as departments of visual culture. The renaming announced the shift away from the object as the art history’s primary focus of study to the study of vision itself, in which the object, the eye, the brain, and space were all studied as elements of both an expanded visual field and an expanded disciplinary field. In the shift, the sense of sight gained an even greater importance. Aural and other sensory experiences of the world had never been a particularly important part of art historical inquiry, except in those limited cases where the architectural historian considered the structural means by which resonance was enhanced in a church or\n\nListening to Islamic Gardens and Landscapes 21 mosque interior, or how prayer times were announced to the urban surround from belfries and minarets. I recall a moment in a medieval studies conference twelve years ago when I asked an eminent elderly scholar to expand upon his explanation of a French cathedral’s interior space in order to include its temperature, sounds, and aroma. In my own mind, I was recalling the awe and powerful sensations of entering a medieval cathedral: I remembered the interior as a vast, dark space that was perceived as much by echoes as by sight, and I remembered reaching out to the smooth, hard stone piers, the coolness of which I had already anticipated before actually touching them. However, at the conference, the request was dismissed out of hand as belonging to the realm of not art history but music. But why should we separate an echo (sound) from the material (architecture) that produces it? The study of architecture has always required a study of space, which always exceeds visual perception and invites consideration of the body in space. That human body is more than a pair of eyes. Fortunately, the perception of architectural history’s limits is changing, as the essays in this volume, titled Music, Sound, and Architecture in Islam, demonstrate. The power of the senses is that they stitch the interior world of the self to the exterior experience of the world. Vision simultaneously reaches out to and holds the exterior world at bay—seen as it is across that unbridgeable gap between the self and all else. It is that external world that becomes the object, the object being that thing that is not the self. In contrast, the other senses lack the ability to objectify. Indeed, sound is perceived by actual changes made to the human body as the surface of the skin or the ear’s membrane responds to the pressure of sound waves. Similarly, the sense of smell is activated when odor molecules enter the nose and stimulate nerve cells. The catalyst may be “out there”; however, it does not remain out there very long and quickly becomes part of the subjective sensate self. Thus, while the jasmine plant releases the rich perfume that we inhale, our sensory appreciation of it is directed less at the emitting object than at the odor itself. Indeed, it is common when encountering a pleasant fragrance to close the eyes, blocking off the identification of the source so that the aroma can be savored not as an appreciable and external thing but as a bodily experience. To inhale a scent is not a scorching encounter with otherness but rather a brief adjustment in oneself. My own work on Islamic gardens initially centered on visual experience.5\n\n22 D. Fairchild Ruggles In part this was because the visual was all that endured. The olfactory, aural, and tactile aspects of being in a garden were ephemeral experiences that were not retrievable, except as repetitions in which the modern listener could only imagine the original impact of the musical concert. Subsequently, however, I began to realize that describing and analyzing the visual effects alone of a garden space is insufficient. I have come to see that the emphasis on vision is a projection of our own modern, highly scopophilic proclivities and to wonder if the casual dismissal of the other senses—particularly sound and smell—derives from our ability to control the sounds, odors, temperatures, and humidity of our surroundings. Because we have the ability to control the environment and suppress unpleasant sensory experiences, we can persuade ourselves that we are not subject to them. Thus protected from strong sensations in our own world, we do not attribute importance to the premodern experience of sensation. I am not claiming that the premodern world was more saturated with sensory stimuli than the modern world in which we live; rather, I am suggesting that modern art historians—such as the aforementioned historian of French cathedral architecture—have chosen to disregard such stimuli as unimportant. In a fascinating essay, George Roeder analyzed the reasons for this dismissal, attributing it to the perceived rationality of the eye and to class prejudices, among other things.6 He wrote that the senses were closely associated with the class division between those who labor with their bodies in the physical world and those who do not labor but write about the world from the sanitary distance of a desk. Such writers have not only avoided but have even disdained the effects of hard work, its filth and sweat, and they linked powerful sensory experiences with socially marginal status. The fact that historians themselves did not engage in physical labor has influenced, in Roeder’s words, “how we regarded the historical role of sensory experience.”7 As an analytic practice, art history—a discipline that continues to have upper-­class associations—has privileged the scopic.\n\nEvidence of Sound Garden history is the progeny of art history, and art historians studying gardens have often treated them as works of architecture, focusing on the planning, form, functioning, and symbolic meaning of gardens. But the transi-\n\nListening to Islamic Gardens and Landscapes 23 tory nature of a garden or landscape often demands a more amplified scope of analysis that addresses the passage of time and the performance aspects of gardens.8 For one thing, the key formal elements (i.e., the plants) are ephemeral, in the sense of being short-­lived but also materially in a state of constant change. Bulbs emerge, bloom, and then fade from view in a matter of weeks; trees that are lit with color when they blossom in the spring may become more subdued as the season progresses. I am once again (myopically, as it were) focusing on appearance; yet it is not only the colors of the tree that change but also the scent of those short-­lived blooms and the sounds as birds trill from the branches in the morning and the fountains gurgle throughout the day. These were integral parts of the garden experience, but they are gone, leaving the historian with the challenge of how to assess a multisensory environment of which only coded representations and fragments of the material fabric survive. What is the evidence for aurality in Islamic gardens? Because of the ephemerality of the gardens themselves (not to mention their sounds), most scholars asking about the sense of sound have resorted to visual and textual evidence. In Islamic art in general, the musicologist Owen Wright explains, there are two ways of finding the “sight of sound.”9 One is to study the representation of instruments and musical events in manuscripts, or what he calls musical iconography. The other is to seek parallels between music and visual art, for example, looking for echoes of musical meter and harmony in the geometry of architectural decoration, while at the same time examining how some elements of music are visualized in diagrams. In both the iconography and the parallels, he is looking specifically at music as a production that follows rules of design similar to those guiding art and architecture as well as poetry. However, in the following, I inquire into the presence of sound more generally, defined not exclusively as a composition made intentionally with instruments and voices but as an sonic entity (1) that can command full attention, as with a calculated production of musical performance, or (2) that can fulfill the role of backdrop, as in the sound of a constantly running fountain, or (3) that occurs incidentally and unpredictably, as with the cacophonous screech of a peacock. Employing the iconographic mode described by Wright, evidence for such sound in gardens can be found in pictorial representations, poetry and written descriptions, and architectural spaces. From the seventh century CE to the present, from the Maghreb to Southeast Asia, Islamic gardens were much more than mere repositories for pavil-\n\n24 D. Fairchild Ruggles ions, plants, and trees. They were living environments animated by birds and animals, some of which flew in and out at whim, while others were specifically housed there. Many palaces had aviaries. For instance, the palace of Madinat al-­Zahraʾ, built outside of Córdoba in the tenth century CE, had fish ponds, a zoo, and an aviary with caged birds and animals that must have been heard on occasion throughout the palace grounds.10 Some of the animals and birds were collected as exotic species (and to eat), but surely the birds were also enjoyed for their song. The city of al-­Qataʾi (in modern Cairo), built in the second half of the ninth century CE by Ibn Tulun, was a vast complex with gardens, a menagerie, and a hippodrome, to which his son added the Golden House and a nearby aviary.11 Similarly, the seventeenth-­century Topkapı Palace in Istanbul had an aviary formed of trees.12 Poetry is full of evocative descriptions of birdsong, and of all the birds, nightingales and doves were enjoyed the most. For example, the ninth-­century Andalusian poet Abu Marwan Ibn Razin wrote that the melodious cooing of doves is “better than the best of singers.”13 Not sufficiently content with live birds and animals, wealthy patrons also had their artisans craft artificial versions that could be made to whistle or twitter when water, steam, or wind passed through interior pipes. In an Andalusian tenth-­century palace outside of Córdoba, for example, there was a pool with tortoises wearing pearl necklaces. They were said to croak, but whether they were real tortoises or mechanical facsimiles is unclear from the description.14 They could have been animals in the royal collection, or they may have been one of the many wondrous fountains and other machines— related to the Hellenistic and Byzantine automata—that were fabricated to create musical and other special effects.15 Even the well-­known lions fountain in the Alhambra’s Court of the Lions in fourteenth-­century Granada may have belonged to this category: a wondrous object that spewed water noisily and thus seemed alive (fig. 1.1a). In early tenth-­century Baghdad, on the occasion of a visit from the Byzantine ambassador to the Abbasid court, a splendid display was orchestrated with similar stagecraft. The entourage of visitors was led from one marvelous hall to another until they reached a courtyard in the New Palace. There they saw a large tree with eighteen gold and silver boughs on which artificial birds made from gold and silver chirped and sang. Proceeding onward to their audience with the caliph, they reached another hall where, on the caliph’s\n\nFigure 1.1.

Fairchild Ruggles signal, a tree rose miraculously from the ground, while mechanical birds sang, and fountains gushed with rose water and musk.16 In all of these descriptions, adding to the pleasure of hearing song from an ordinary bird was the delight of manufacturing that same sound and thus erasing the line between the natural and the ingeniously artificial. Providing a sibilant aural backdrop to the chirps and growls of living fauna and automata, the garden’s trees and fountains made a gentle and constant sound that was pleasing yet unobtrusive. One of the effects of such background sounds is that they mask other noises and can thus help to create a sense of privacy. On a hillside very near to the Alhambra, the Generalife Palace’s Acequia Garden (Granada), an early fourteenth-­century garden retreat named for its central water channel, had a pavilion at either end as well as a projecting mirador at the midpoint of the long covered gallery that ran along one side of the garden (fig. 1.1b). Because walking along this gallery was the primary means of getting to the far pavilion, the experience of the garden was unavoidable. Visitors saw colors and foliage textures, set against the characteristically reddish clay soil typical of Granada. Perhaps they detected the light scent of whatever flowers were in bloom. Hieronymous Münzer, a German physician who went to Granada only two years after the surrender of the ruling Nasrid dynasty in 1492 CE, and Andrea Navagero, who traveled there as an ambassador from Venice in 1526, saw orange and lemon trees planted in the courtyards of the Alhambra. The sweet and slightly heavy scent of the flower and the much lighter scent of the fruit itself later in the season must have been a great delight, and surely the water made noise as it ran gently through the central channel.17 Navagero related that there were also vigorous jets that shot upward. One can imagine both the physical sensation of the water spray as it cooled the skin and the sound of splashing as it fell back into the containing basin. The rows of jets that line the channel today may have been a later addition, but the singular jets observed in other courtyards indicate that the sound, at least, is authentic.18 In addition, water rushes fast and generously into the courtyard from a source uphill, a sound loud enough to demand attention. It arrives with sufficient force to flow like a fast-­moving stream. In a dry climate such as southern Spain, the sound of water comes as a relief. Even where the gardens were less spectacular, we find evidence for multiple sensory dimensions. For example, the eleventh-­century Persian traveler Nasir-­i Khusraw saw rooftop gardens in Cairo where the trees were pre-\n\nListening to Islamic Gardens and Landscapes 27 sumably grown in pots. The roof gardens were probably positioned thus to take advantage of breezes as well as to maximize real estate in the densely settled city. But their height required ingenious water-­lifting devices, such as wheels. “There are places where the houses are fourteen stories tall and others seven. I heard from a reliable source that one person has on top of a seven-­story house a garden where he raised a calf. He also has a waterwheel up there turned by this ox to lift water from a well down below. He has orange trees and also bananas and other fruit-­bearing trees, flowers, and herbs planted on the roof.”19 Waterwheels are never silent. They rotate for hours on end, and their creaking noise was sometimes regarded as detracting from the environment of the garden and sometimes adding to it. In al-­Andalus the poet Lisan al-­Din Ibn al-­Khatib (1313–1374 CE) wrote of a waterwheel’s “plaintive lovesong,” and another, Abu Tammam Ghalib ibn Tammam al-­Hayyam, praised the melody and chant of such wheels, likening them to the famous singer Ziryab who arrived in al-­Andalus in 822.20 Although the historical sounds themselves do not reverberate in the present, the accounts of birdsong, traces of fountains, and descriptions of waterwheels inform us not only that sound was present but that it was an intended part of the sensory design of gardens. Thus, in historic gardens today, when we hear the splashing of a fountain or the heavier rhythm of a waterwheel in motion, we are not hearing the actual sounds from the eleventh and fourteenth centuries, and yet we are hearing an authentic repetition of those sounds. The garden as a form is like a written musical composition; its “performance” today bears the same relation to its “performance” long ago as the performance of a medieval song today does to its performance in the era of its composition. There is also evidence for staged musical events in garden settings. The playing of music is shown in manuscripts such as the romance of Bayad wa Riyad, a thirteenth-­century illustrated Arabic manuscript from al-­Andalus (fig. 1.2).21 It is a tale of secret love between Bayad, a young merchant from Damascus, and Riyad, a slave girl, in which there are several illustrations of scenes set within walled gardens where singers played the ʿūd (lute). In the first, Riyad attends a get-­together in a garden with other ladies attending to Riyad’s mistress, the daughter of the ḥajib (prime minister). The narrative tells us that the garden was a lovely sight, with carpets, silken cushions, platters of food, and cups of wine. Painted scenes from the manuscript show the group sitting between high walls—an enclosed garden—under the shade\n\n28 D. Fairchild Ruggles\n\nFigure 1.2. Bayad plays the ʿūd to the lady, in the Bayad wa Riyad. Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana, Vatican City AR. 368; courtesy of Pictures From History/ Bridgeman Images.\n\nof leafy trees. The mistress tells one of her slave girls to sing, whereupon the girl takes up the instrument and sings of forlorn love. When she finishes, the mistress cries, “By God, your song filled me with sadness—sing us another!” And one after another, the slave girls sing songs of unrequited love as the lute and another string instrument, the ṭanbūr, are passed among the singers, along with wine. At this point Bayad arrives. He has already glimpsed Riyad in an orchard on the banks of the river and has engaged a go-­between—who is present at the party and serves as the narrator of the events—and he and the go-­ between hatched a plan whereby he would attend the gathering to see if Riyad is as lovely and demure as he believes. When he arrives, he takes the lute himself and sings several love songs. When pressed by the mistress, he\n\nListening to Islamic Gardens and Landscapes 29 confesses that he has been smitten by one of her ladies whom he has seen only from a distance (thus attesting to her unbesmirched honor). The mistress asks others to sing, and eventually it becomes a back-­and-­forth of songs sung by Riyad and Bayad, in one of which Bayad composes and sings verses describing the garden’s myrtle, lilies, golden narcissus, and white and red roses. The mistress is sympathetic to the lovers, perhaps as a result of having just heard twenty-­five songs about romantic longing (according to the sequence in the manuscript). But she cannot give them to each other because, as she explains, Riyad is owned by the mistress’s father, who wants the slave girl for himself. The group fears a scandal, and Bayad is quickly and secretly ushered from the garden. The story continues with love letters and tearful sadness, and we do not know how it ends since the manuscript’s final pages have been lost. But it is significant that the entire first scene (more than a third of the extant text) occurs in the garden and that the communication among the attendants at the garden party—and thus the communication to the reader as well—­occurs in the form of songs. The scenes are illustrated as well as narrated. In addition to the first scene of lute playing, there are two similar scenes, one of Riyad singing and the other of the turbaned Bayad (seen in the painting reproduced here). The Bayad wa Riyad is an unusual manuscript in that it is the only such fully illustrated manuscript to survive from Islamic Spain, but in its depictions of musical scenes in gardens, it is typical. Manuscripts, wall paintings, and scenes painted or carved in precious objects throughout the Islamic world show that gardens, whether enjoyed as places of leisure or organized ceremoniously on state occasions, were sonorous environments. Music was an expected entertainment not only in receptions held in gardens but also at court festivities, military parades, and the hunt.22 Thus, the Bayad wa Riyad manuscript painting provides more than an image of a popular musical instrument: it shows the courtly garden context in which music was played and hints at its effect—winning the heart of the musician’s beloved. Music is shown at large scale in palace murals. An entire program of such scenes is represented in the Chihil Situn pavilion (finished in 1647 CE) in the Safavid palace complex of Isfahan. The Chihil Situn stood within a large walled garden with trees, garden beds, water channels, and large rectangular pools, and the pavilion opens up to its verdant environment via its broad tālār (wooden columned) porch and immense arched īwāns (large niches)\n\n30 D. Fairchild Ruggles (fig. 1.3a). On the walls in the interior of the hall are four large murals showing state receptions and historical battles, as well as several smaller ones showing festive scenes and some later paintings of figural types.23 There is delightful consonance in the fact that the Chihil Situn is a real pavilion surrounded by a real garden, adorned with pictures that show a garden pavilion peopled by the shah, courtiers, visitors, and entertainers, the very people who would have constituted the viewing and listening audience on festive occasions. On the south end of the western wall, there is a painting (made soon after 1647 CE) that depicts the feast given a hundred years earlier by Shah Tahmasp in honor of the visit of the Mughal emperor Humayun to Tabriz (fig. 1.3b). Humayun had sought the protection of the Safavids during a period of political uncertainty and exile from Hindustan in 1544 CE. The rulers are depicted in an interior space. Since the arched window at the center of the scene opens to a landscape of lawn and trees, the space is probably a garden pavilion (and thus a representation of a garden pavilion on the walls of the Chihil Situn, itself a garden pavilion). The Mughal is shown wearing a robe of honor, seated on a dais with the shah, his head slightly lower than that of his host and gazing toward the shah, as befitting his subject status in that moment. Around them swirls a lavish reception with entertainment provided by a group of musicians (on the viewer’s left) playing string instruments, mouth and lap harps, and large frame drums (a variety of the daf ) while two dancers sway to the rhythm. Although it is the political meeting of the two rulers that is the principal subject, the musical entertainment occupies the center foreground, where it invites us to listen to the drumbeat and melodies of the music, the effect of which is performed by the dancers’ lithe bodies. Many of the listeners in the audience have their hands raised, in some cases holding cups and plates, but in others demonstrating an enthusiastic response to the music. Even the robed figure standing next to the dancers is swept up in the rhythm, for as she pours wine from a tall-­necked vase into a cup, her knee is raised and her robe flows in response to her movement. Other painted murals elsewhere in the Chihil Situn depict receptions for the Chinese delegation and for Nadr Muhammad Khan, exiled from Transoxiana. Instruments such as the drum, lute (ʿūd), and angular harp (chang) appear often in these murals as well as in Safavid manuscript and album paintings of the period.\n\nFigure 1.3.

Fairchild Ruggles From India, a well-­known late sixteenth-­century painting from a copy of the Baburnameh shows not musical performance but sound. The garden scene occupies two facing pages in the manuscript, which re­cords the memoirs of the Mughal emperor Babur (see plates 1 and 2). Babur is depicted actively directing the construction of one of his many gardens, the Bagh-­i Wafa near Kabul. As described in the memoir’s narrative, the painting shows the garden teeming with brightly colored oranges, citron, and pomegranates, the latter attracting birds that are shown perched on branches and in midflight. It is a scene of vigorous activity, from the man at the door who has just knocked for entrance to the attendants whose hands are raised in a gesture indicating speech and emotion. The vivid colors and trees laden with ripe fruit appeal to the eyes and taste, and it does not require much imagination to conjure up the soundscape as well: the birds chirping and the horses breathing roughly, the clattering of metal tools, the chatter of the assembly, and the commanding voice of Babur himself. In both the Baburnameh manuscript and the Chihil Situn murals, music is presented together with food, luxurious clothing, attending servants, and a magnificent setting as the attributes of courtly life. However, manuscript paintings do more than simply represent the people, animals, and instruments that emit sound; as in Wright’s second model of musical “representation,” the actual composition of the page can underscore the relation between sound production and words. For example, in a 1648 illustration in the great Persian epic Shahnameh, there is a scene of combat between the hero Rustam and his grandson Barzu, whose identity he does not recognize (see plate 3). In the center foreground, the protagonists face off on horseback, youthful Barzu (on the right) attempting to strike the older, bearded Rustam (on the left) with a mace. Overhead, the clashing armies of each protagonist are led by trumpeters whose long golden horns point centrally and slightly upward toward the four blocks of script, as if the horns were giving voice to the text of the manuscript. The formal design of the painting directs our attention to sound and then supplies the script that will presumably be vocalized, word and image cooperating to tell a dramatic story. In the battle scene, sound is a supplement that enhances the main action, but in a different painting from an earlier manuscript copy of the Shahnameh manuscript made between 1525–1535 CE, music is the central theme. The\n\nListening to Islamic Gardens and Landscapes 33 painting illustrates the story of the musician Barbad, who caught the attention of the Sassanian king Khusraw (r. 590–628 CE) by daring to play the lute and sing for him unbidden while hidden in a cypress outside of the garden pavilion where the shah was celebrating the Persian New Year (see plate 4).24 The shah, whose back is to the tree and who does not see the entirety of the scene as we do, heard the mysterious and beautiful music and ordered a search for its source. When Barbad descended from his branch and revealed himself, he was promptly appointed chief musician. As in the battle scene described above, the cypress in which the musician hid himself playfully insists on vocalization. The slender tree shoots upward and behind the blocks of script, hidden like Barbad himself, and then emerges from behind the frame. It divides the page and is the tallest element, pushing into the gold-­ flecked margins, rising from its obscured background position to demand our attention, like the voice of the singer himself. The sounds and sensory experiences of these historic gardens and landscapes can rarely be heard today, with the exception of fountains that at the Alhambra and a few other palaces still play in their original architectural setting. But even there, it is at best a reenactment of a soundscape, a performance of something that is not the original and yet, in reenacting the original, excites our imagination. Our understanding of what the garden sounded like, or smelled like, derives from manuscript painting, sculptural imagery, and literary evocations where the effects of sound and sensory stimulation are described or represented. Thus, although we may go in search of the sensory experiences that exceeded the visual, ultimately we have to return to visual evidence that shows, through pictorial representation of both the production and the effect of sensory stimuli, the ephemeral sounds, scents, and experiences that are no longer present. However, this is a different kind of visual practice than is usually welcomed in art history. It is one that does not insist on vision as the primary or the only way of knowing the history of architecture and the built environment. Instead, it enlists the visual to discover the echoes of other important sensory ways of knowing the world around us, both present and past. To understand Islamic gardens in all their sensory splendor, the eyes want the accompaniment of the nose and ears, indeed, the entire sensate body.\n\n34 D.
