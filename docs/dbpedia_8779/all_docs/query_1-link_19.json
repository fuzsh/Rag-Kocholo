Owen-Crocker and Joana Sequeira\n\nT\n\nhis book was inspired by a successful session at the Leeds International Medieval Congress of 2017 titled ‘Dressing Otherness – Garments as Expressions of Diverse Ethnicity in Medieval Iberia’. Featured speakers were Maria Dolores Serrano-Niza, Joana Isabel Sequeira and María Barrigón. The session covered: Andalusi garments and trousseaux bearing Castilian names; the roles of Jews and Muslims in Portuguese textile production and their respective cultural and technical legacies; and the role and implications of Castilian royal textile grave-goods and their Arabic ornamentation, cloths imported from the Islamic Hispanic territory of al-Andalus. The session had been organized by Naḥum Ben-Yehuda, an Israeli scholar with a longstanding interest in textiles, especially in rabbinical sources and Jewish garments. The session was sponsored by DISTAFF (Discussion, Interpretation and Study of Textile Arts, Fabrics and Fashion),1 and its co-founder, Gale Owen-Crocker, attended the ‘Medieval Iberia’ session. Greatly impressed both by the quality of the papers and the innovative nature of the session’s topic, Gale suggested to Naḥum Ben-Yehuda that there was scope for a book-length treatment of the dress and textiles of multicultural, medieval Iberia. The speakers were enthusiastic about the idea and expressed their eagerness to produce a publication in English. While this seemed desirable in that it would bring this little-appreciated topic to the wider English-speaking audience, it inevitably complicated the compilation of the book since all the contributors would be non-native speakers of English. With María Barrigón as editor on Spanish 1\n\nAn umbrella organization founded by Robin Netherton and Gale Owen-Crocker to sponsor sessions on dress and textiles at the annual international congresses at Kalamazoo, Western Michigan University, USA and Leeds University, UK. DISTAFF is affiliated with the annual journal Medieval Clothing and Textiles and the book series Medieval and Renaissance Clothing and Textiles.\n\n2\n\nB arr igón, Ben-Yehu da, Owen- C ro c k er a n d S eq uei ra\n\ntopics, Joana Sequeira on Portuguese, Naḥum Ben-Yehuda as co-ordinator and Gale Owen-Crocker roped in as a native English speaker and for her experience in publishing books on textiles in English, the group set about establishing the parameters of the project and finding suitable experts to write on the topics they deemed necessary for an interdisciplinary study. A team of scholars was assembled, and a meeting at the Leeds Congress of 2018, which included Caroline Palmer, Editorial Director of publisher Boydell & Brewer Ltd, the editors established a timetable to include a conference, where all the authors would present short versions of their contributions, in English, and would join in discussion about the volume in general. The conference, titled ‘Dress and Textiles in Multicultural Medieval Iberia’, was held on 13–14 June 2019 at the University of Porto, generously hosted by CITCEM (Centro de Investigação Transdisciplinar ‘Cultura, Espaço e Memória’, Centre for Transdisciplinary Research ‘Culture, Space and Memory), in the Faculty of Arts and Humanities. There were 15 speakers and a wide public audience composed of students, teachers, researchers and members of historical re-enactment societies. Lively discussion followed each paper and in a meeting of editors and speakers at the close of the conference, difficulties of terminology were discussed, lacunae identified and remedies suggested. In assembling a suitable team of experts, the editors’ procedure was necessarily coloured by work on the subject during the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st. The academic approach to the study of textiles in the Iberian Peninsula was triggered by the discovery, study and initial display of the collection of medieval textiles from the abbey church of Las Huelgas in Burgos (Spain). This collection consists of more than 200 medieval textile grave-goods from members of the royal family of Castile recovered between 1942 and 1944. It encompasses different garments, pillows and coffin linings that provide an unparalleled collection of textiles dating from very late in the 12th century to the first decades of the 14th. The more impressive and well preserved items have been exhibited in a museum located in the nunnery since 1949. Immediately after its discovery, the collection was studied by the famous historian Manuel Gómez-Moreno.2 He classified the textiles into several series according to their origin, form or technique. He established the following groups: classical Arab series, Mudejar series, Christian series, twill series, oriental series and, lastly, striped fabrics, plain fabrics, cendales, ribbons, braids, embroideries and jewels. His work is essential reading for anyone interested in studying not only this collection but medieval Spanish textiles in general. This book opened a field for subsequent studies, and its influence extends to the present day. In the subsequent decades studies around the textile fields were produced, focusing on different aspects such as industry, clothing and decorative motifs. Mainly from the perspectives of History or Art, they largely focused on specific kingdoms or cultures, trying to fill the void of knowledge. Another key study 2\n\nManuel Gómez-Moreno, El panteón real de las Huelgas de Burgos (Madrid: CSIC, 1946).\n\nInt r odu cti o n 3\n\nwas carried out by a team led by Socorro Mantilla de los Ríos,3 producing for the first time a book explaining not only the restoration processes carried out on the textile grave-goods of Archbishop Jiménez de Rada (d. 1247) recovered from his tomb in the Convent of Santa Maria de Huerta, Soria, in 1968, but also publishing the complete technical aspects involved in the manufacture of these textiles. Subsequent discoveries from elite burials in other places have provided an important corpus of textiles, mostly Islamic silks. These patterned, woven silks have caught the imagination of the English-speaking world, including as they do rare survivals of medieval secular garments which testify to the dress fashions of their time and place;4 ecclesiastical vestments; and many fragments. They have been discussed as textile artworks in relation to Islamic architecture and artworks in other media, and as a cultural phenomenon which crossed religious and geographical boundaries.5 During the first decades of the 21st century, scholars have been quite active in the field of Iberian textile and costume history and have published some important collective works that have contributed to a better knowledge of the Iberian situation, demonstrating the uniqueness of its medieval material culture. Such is the case of two recent books that attribute to the Mediterranean the role of a central axis, showing how the cultural interchange in that space sponsored a common textile culture.6 This idea of global circulation of textiles and techniques is also the basis of the volume organised by Ricardo Franch and Germán Navarro on the silk routes between Spain and Portugal, which is actually a sequel to another book on the same subject published 20 years earlier.7 Both volumes provide state-of3 4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\nLas vestiduras pontificales del arzobispo Jiménez de Rada, siglo XIII: su estudio y restauración (Madrid: Instituto de Conservación y Restauración de Bienes Culturales 1995).

The concept of cross-cultural exchange has been a feature of the studies of Iberian textiles, as already demonstrated in a collective work from 2001, edited by Manuela Marín, focused on Antiquity and the early medieval period, which addresses the symbolic value of costume and fabric, identifying similarities and differences between the Christian and Islamic cultures.8 Even specific collections of medieval textiles and objects, like the treasury of San Isidoro, have been studied from the perspective of the cross-cultural environment that characterizes the Iberian Peninsula in the Middle Ages.9 The present volume was designed to take the concepts of multiculturalism and inter-culturalism a little further, by offering a cohesive work which presents a specific topic from various viewpoints. As a rule, the chapters focus on geographical regions or cultural groups. The studies range over types of clothing, the textile industry and its commerce, usage of textile products, technical characterization of materials, precious textiles (and their respective court culture) and commonplace ones and different ethnicities, as well as nomenclature and uses. Balance between kingdoms, ethnicities and topics has been sought. Since medieval Iberia, especially in the textile field, has received very little treatment in the English language other than Art Historical approaches to luxurious Andalusi silks, this book seeks to fill that void, including not only the Islamic lands, and the Crowns of Castile and Aragon, but also important Iberian territories such as Portugal and Navarre. Textiles are therefore studied here from multi- and inter-cultural approaches as well as from a range of methodologies to gain a better understanding of how they were produced and how they functioned in their own cultural context. Aspects of Christian, Islamic and Jewish cultures are presented, as well as different perspectives from Social and Economic History, and Philology, in order to explore the materiality of the industries, the names of the textiles and the uses of textiles and garments. The intent is to provide deep insights into textile and garment culture of the Iberian Peninsula in the Late Middle Ages, particularly during the 13th and 14th centuries – a period that has received sparse attention from historians. To achieve this goal, the editors felt that essays about the history of collections of textiles preserved or descriptions of textiles would be insufficient; rather the chosen focus rests on a critical historical interpretation of the cultural environment,\n\nby Comisión Española de la Ruta de la Seda (Barcelona: Universitat de Barcelona Publicacions, 1996). 8 Tejer y vestir: de la Antigüedad al Islam, ed. by Manuela Marín Niño (Madrid: Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas, 2001). 9 The medieval Iberian treasury in the context of cultural interchange, ed. by Therese Martin (Leiden and Boston: Brill, 2020).\n\nInt r odu cti o n 5\n\nproduction and uses of these garments, textiles and fibres, using artworks for purposes of illustration. The sovereign states of present-day Europe are, to a large extent, modern creations. Though Portugal has enjoyed unusual continuity, surviving as a kingdom from the 12th to the early 20th century, and, now a republic, remains a nation state today, the area we now call ‘Spain’ has a complex history of separate Christian kingdoms, variously united at different times by alliances and royal marriages or in opposition to one another, in various states of dominance and subordination at different times; and of Islamic states, united by religion and culture rather than geopolitics, expanding and ebbing in territorial terms in the course of centuries. The reader is therefore presented with a historical and contextualising opening chapter, quite independent of textile issues. This contribution, ‘From the Five Kingdoms to the Hispanic Monarchy: Political Structures, Ideology and Historical Development in the Medieval Iberian Peninsula (1157–1504)’ by David Nogales Rincón, sets the cultural and political background for the studies of textiles. Acknowledging that the foundations of the later religious and cultural map are to be found in the incursion, in 711, of Muslim people into the, then declining, Visigothic ‘Kingdom of Toledo’, the author examines both the interactions between the Islamic and Christian peoples in the Iberian peninsula throughout the High and Later Middle Ages and the changing patterns of alliances and regroupings among the Christian kingdoms which culminated in the Catholic Monarchy of the late 15th and early 16th centuries. The chapter introduces important concepts such as the ‘Crowns’ of Aragon and Castile, the Cortes, the 4th Lateran Council’s pronouncements on Jewish dress and the transmission of intellectual and cultural ideas from the Muslim states to the Christian, which recur throughout the book. Chapter 2, by María Barrigón, ‘Textile Techniques in the Iberian Peninsula (Thirteenth to Fourteenth Centuries)’, establishes the fibres and dyestuffs available to Iberian craft workers and the weaving techniques employed. A detailed study of techniques is related specifically to surviving textiles, mostly luxury items made of silk, many of them recovered from elite burials, which survive in museums and galleries, or in the collections of Christian establishments. Chapter 3, ‘Cloth Trade in the Iberian Kingdoms during the Late Middle Ages’ by Máximo Diago Hernando, utilizes documentary evidence to examine the economic history of the textile trade throughout Iberia from the 12th to 15th centuries, explaining the fluctuating nature of native production and importation in terms of political and military circumstances. It includes details of the cloths traded, both higher and lower quality, for a population from elite to humble, and of the roles of merchants in importing both by sea and land, and trading within the Peninsula in shops and fairs. Germán Navarro Espinach’s paper ‘Textiles in the Crown of Aragon: Production, Commerce, Consumption’ (Chapter 4) examines the textile industry in Aragon, Catalonia, Valencia and Majorca, the four largest states of the 12th- to 16th-­ century entity known as the ‘Crown of Aragon’. Using documentary evidence\n\n6\n\nB arr igón, Ben-Yehu da, Owen- C ro c k er a n d S eq uei ra\n\nfor production and trade, including close attention to linguistic evidence for the names of cloths, the author traces the rise of the native industries associated with wool, first influenced by the south of France, which became the single most important economic factor in the realm; and the manufacture of silk, originating in Islamic territories, practised by many Jewish artisans in the 13th and 14th centuries and the making of velvet in the 14th and 15th centuries, inspired by the Italian velvet industry. The roles of cotton, hemp and linen fabrics, though less important economically, are also acknowledged. The chapter pays particular attention to the organisation of the workforce, and to the dress and furnishing products which were made from the fabrics. In ‘The Textile Industry in al-Andalus’ (Chapter 5) Adela Fábregas demonstrates evidence from geographers, chroniclers, religious legal texts, marketplace regulations, land registers, agronomical works, correspondence of merchants and royal court records for the production, processing, marketing and export of textiles in medieval al-Andalus. The chapter includes the changes in the countryside, as mulberry trees and cotton were introduced and dye plants were intensively cultivated to feed the textile industry, as well as the industrialisation of towns devoted to silk production. Chapter 6, Joana Sequeira’s ‘Flax, Wool and Silk: Textile Industries in Medieval Portugal’, uses documentary sources, largely non-literary, to study the textile production of medieval Portugal, redressing the imbalance of previous scholarship which has largely focused on imported cloth. The chapter considers the geographical distribution of textile production, manufacture, the terminology applied to cloths, and the usage, both internally and abroad, of Portugueseproduced textiles, which were not of luxury quality, but widely used, utilitarian clothing and furnishing fabrics. Chapter 7, ‘Dress as a Language: A Survey of Arabic texts from al-Andalus’ by Manuela Marín, seeks to establish, from Arabic written texts, how the inhabitants of al-Andalus dressed. She identifies the importance of dress as a social code, which, despite some cultural cross-dressing, served to indicate ethnic identity, and despite occasional transvestism for purposes of disguise or entertainment, strongly marked gender identity. It also demonstrated social standing, the difference between the free and the enslaved, and certain professions, such as that of the scholar. The Arabic/Muslim theme is continued in the next two chapters. The late Maria Filomena Lopes de Barros’s ‘Muslim Dress in Medieval Portugal: Textual Evidence in the Context of the Iberian Peninsula’ (Chapter 8) demonstrates that while Portugal, after the 4th Lateran Council of 1215, shared with the rest of the Iberian peninsula the desire to establish through dress a Christian identity, a res publica christiana, which excluded the ‘other’ (Muslim or Jew), in Portugal this was achieved by making mandatory clothing which was already traditionally Muslim (as well as the intermittent imposition of a Moorish badge). Thus, although dress law was subject to negotiation (as when sleeves, or closed garments, were impractical for work), Portuguese (male) Muslims established a visual Moorishness,\n\nInt r odu cti o n 7\n\nwhere, as far as outer garments at least were concerned, the body was concealed by voluminous clothing. Women are largely unmentioned in the documentary sources. In Chapter 9, ‘Medieval Castilian Garments and their Arabic Names’, Dolores Serrano-Niza discusses the imitation of Andalusi dress and textiles in Castilian culture. Focusing on Arab-Islamic garment terms which were loaned into Castilian Spanish, but ultimately discontinued, she examines the contexts in which the words are documented according to 15th- and 16th-century compilations to investigate the nature of the garments, their gendered use and the phenomenon of the same word being used to describe textiles with different functions, both dress and furnishing fabrics. The chapter is illustrated with examples from manuscript illuminations. María Barrigón’s second contribution (Chapter 10) ‘Clothing, Furnishings and Ceremonies at the Castilian Court (c. 1214−c. 1332)’ focuses on the period between the death of King Alfonso VIII (1214) and the coronation of Alfonso XI, using the evidence of material remains of textiles from royal burials as well as surviving documents and artworks. It examines the administrative structure responsible for the maintenance of the royal wardrobe, from chancellor to laundress, and shows how textiles were used to convey the concept of magnificence by both Church and royalty and to convey the unique importance of the monarch. Continuing the theme of court textiles, in ‘Fabrics and Attire at the Court of Navarre in the Second Half of the Fourteenth Century’, (Chapter 11) Merche Osés Urricelqui examines the documentary evidence for the textiles acquired by the Navarre court at the height of its power. Dress and textiles were essential to the system of patronage operated by the monarchs, a system in which gifts were strictly segregated according to social hierarchy, and were a major feature of royal display, an essential ingredient of regal prestige in the courts of Europe at this time. The volume concludes with three papers on Jewish matters. In Chapter 12, ‘Textile Production and Jewish Clothing in the Iberian Peninsula: Characteristics, Customs and Differences between Catalan and Other Jewish Communities’, Esperança Valls Pujol explains that certain Jewish garments were required by biblical command, but otherwise Jews dressed in the same way as their non-Jewish contemporaries, except for ways in which their appearance was regulated by the Christian or Arab rulers of the Iberian kingdoms in which they lived. The chapter continues with a detailed description of the garments of the Jews, drawn from documentary sources, mostly notarial, the limited depictions in art, and the evidence of archaeology. Naḥum Ben-Yehuda, in ‘Silk as Reflected in Medieval Iberian Jewish Literature’ (Chapter 13) demonstrates that medieval Jewish writers, and their intended audience, must have been familiar with silk and aspects of its manufacture, since they describe it in detail and mention it often in two contexts – metaphorically in theological matters, and in factual legal (‘halakhic’) applications of various kinds.\n\n8\n\nB arr igón, Ben-Yehu da, Owen- C ro c k er a n d S eq uei ra\n\nSilk, albeit luxurious, was so much a part of everyday life for them, that they even (inaccurately) reimagined some biblical textiles as silk. Finally, in Chapter 14, ‘The Garment and the Difference: The Attire of Portuguese Jews and New Christians (Conversos) during the Thirteenth to Sixteenth Centuries’, Susana Bastos Mateus first explains the ethnic and religious prejudice against minorities and the provisions of the Fourth Lateran Council (1215) that they should be distinguished by dress from Christians, to avoid interaction (and especially sexual relationships) between Christians and those of other faiths. She examines the distinctive signs that were imposed but also shows how there were many exceptions. Conversion of Portuguese Jews in the latter part of the 15th century removed these visible differences, but suspicion that some conversos remained crypto-Jews led to investigations that they secretly practised Jewish customs, including dressing specially for the Sabbath. Covering a wide range of themes and approaches, that range from materiality to symbolism, this book addresses the production, trade, and consumption of textiles and garments as a whole phenomenon that is influenced by a multi-cultural context which it also helps to perpetuate. Written by some of the top experts in the field, this work allows us to depict more accurately the culture of textile and costume in Medieval Iberia: essentially plural, yet singular in European context.\n\nPart I\n\nThe Historical Background/Context\n\nchapter 1\n\nFrom the Five Kingdoms to the Hispanic Monarchy: Political Structures, Ideology and Historical Development in the Medieval Iberian Peninsula (1157–1504) 1 David Nogales Rincón\n\nI ntroductio n\n\nB\n\netween 1157 and 1504,2 the Iberian Peninsula evolved from a state of fragmentation, with an important Islamic political presence and a multi-religious and multicultural society, to a new panorama that, dominated by the CastilianAragonese block, would lay the foundations at the end of the Middle Ages for the Catholic Hispanic Monarchy in conjunction with the expulsion of religious minorities from the Peninsula.

We make this decision notwithstanding the importance in the evolution of al-Andalus4 and Western Islam of the different Islamic formations that arose in the Peninsula between the 12th and 15th centuries.\n\nTh e t e r r i t ori al fram ew ork from a Christian and Isl amic p e r s pecti ve: Hispa n ia / España and al -And al u s The history of the Peninsula in the High (11th to 13th centuries) and Late Middle Ages (14th to 15th centuries) is characterized by the existence of two parallel cultural identities, shaped by the Christian and Muslim perception of the Iberian Peninsula, materialized in the entity of Hispania/España and al-Andalus respectively.5 Hispania/España – a territory that during the medieval period was identified geographically with the Roman Hispania, but was also a cultural and historical community that traced its origins to Roman, Visigothic, and even pre-Roman, 3\n\nSome reference works about global history of the medieval Iberian Peninsula are José Ángel García de Cortázar, La época medieval (Madrid: Alianza, 1988); Thomas F.

On the concept of Hispania/España in the Middle Ages, see Luis González Antón, España y las Españas (Madrid: Alianza Editorial, 1998), pp. 78–142; José Antonio Maravall, El concepto de España en la Edad Media (Madrid: Instituto de Estudios Políticos, 1964); Carlos de Ayala Martínez, ‘Realidad y percepción de Hispania en la Edad Media’, eHumanista: Journal of Iberian Studies, 37 (2017), 206–31. On the concept of al-Andalus, the following are interesting: Joaquín Vallvé Bermejo, ‘Al-Andalus como España’, in España.

Far from being uniform, this awareness, according to Miguel Ángel Ladero Quesada, took on different manifestations, depending on the era, an individual’s social position and, above all, on the different perceptions of territory established during the historical genesis of each area.6 Furthermore, it is important to bear in mind that this awareness of forming part of a common cultural and historical community was compatible with the political diversity of the Peninsula – an awareness of diversity that would eventually lead to the expression las Españas (‘the Spains’), that sometimes also evoked the old administrative divisions of Roman Hispania7 – and with the subjective identity of belonging to the different Christian kingdoms. This shared identity manifested itself in various common projects, such as the joint military campaigns led by the Christian kingdoms against Islam, the tendency to formalise royal marriage links between the Iberian kingdoms, and the extensive cultural exchange (circulation of legal and historiographical works, dissemination of Castilian as lingua franca) between the peninsular kingdoms.8 In this context, the image of Hispania/España would at times be used to try to achieve a political hegemony over the Peninsula. A good example of this is the imperialism of the kingdom of Leon, which reached its peak with Alfonso VI (r. 1065–1109) and Alfonso VII (r. 1126–1157) adopting the title of Imperator totius Hispaniae (‘Emperor of all Spain’), or the tendency of 13th-century Western Castilian-Leonese chroniclers to identify Hispania/España with Castile.9 Al-Andalus constituted an important alternative to this idea of a Christian Hispania/España. This notion of al-Andalus, in place since at least 716, was the particular expression of the Islamic community or Ummah in the Peninsula. This importance of the Ummah explains the secondary position (i.e., not fundamental) of the territorial notion of al-Andalus, to the extent that the Ummah itself 6\n\nMiguel Ángel Ladero Quesada, ‘Unidad y diversidad en la España medieval.

In this sense, on one hand, the feudal kingdoms were gradually incorporated into western Christianity in a process similar to Europeanisation, whilst on the other hand, al-Andalus became part of the North African Almoravid (1086–1145) and Almohad (1145–1231) empires, in a process of Africanisation. Although these labels of Europeanisation and Africanisation simplify the complex historical processes taking place, it is safe to say that from this moment religious identities were strengthened in both the Christian and Andalusi spheres. This process would have an important symbolic manifestation in the diffusion of the images of the crusade and the Jihad. In parallel to this, both territories interweave more closely with the historical dynamics of their corresponding geohistorical regions: the Latin West and the Maghreb. Despite their distinctness, the Hispanic-Christian societies in the High and Late Middle Ages, according to Miguel Ángel Ladero Quesada and Francisco García Fitz, clearly adhered to the Latin European model.13 Therefore, the evolution of Iberian Christian societies must be analysed – without ignoring their peculiarities resulting from their contact with Islamic or Jewish cultures – in terms of the evolutionary dynamic of the medieval West: political and social (feudalism, expansion starting in the 11th century, crisis in the 14th century, the genesis of the modern 10 On this issue, see: Mª Jesús Viguera Molins, ‘Al-Ándalus y España’, in Las Españas medievales,\n\ned. by Julio Valdeón Baruque (Valladolid: Universidad de Valladolid, 1999), pp. 95–112; Chalmeta, Invasión, pp. 22–26. 11 Vallvé Bermejo, ‘Al-Andalus’, p. 77. 12 Felipe Maíllo Salgado, ¿Por qué desapareció al-Ándalus?

These processes were driven, among other things, by cultural exchanges between royal courts, the presence in the Peninsula of European religious orders, Frankish emigration to the Christian kingdoms, contact with the papal curia and the role of the Pilgrimage route Camino de Santiago (Way of St James) as a facilitator of cultural exchange.14 In the case of al-Andalus, the main phenomenon influencing this process was the aforementioned inclusion of the already orientalised and Arabised al-Andalus within a Moorish-Maghrebian-Andalusi unit that would survive for many decades. Firstly, this was due to the incorporation of al-Andalus into the Almoravid and Almohad empires, and later, resulted from the close military, economic and cultural ties established between the Emirate of Granada and the Marinid dynasty of the Maghreb.15\n\nC ha r a c t e r i sti cs of peni nsular histo ry: a f ro ntie r so cie ty The history of the Iberian Peninsula is partially marked by an event that would, in the long term, be fundamental to our understanding of the later medieval situation: the entry into, in 711, and consolidation of Islam in Iberia, and its permanence there for nearly eight hundred years. This year marks the first contact between two societies: the (Christian) Visigoths, in decline, and the Arab-Muslim society in the process of consolidation and expansion.16 The complex relationship between Islamic and Christian political formations cannot be addressed here, but it is sufficient to say that it goes beyond a simple confrontation between two opposing concepts of reality. This relationship was not stable over time but was subject to the construction of the respective identities of 14 In this respect see Jean Gautier Dalché, ‘La cristiandad europea: el Camino de Santiago’, in Las\n\nEspañas medievales, pp. 141–58; José Manuel Nieto Soria, ‘Hispania y Europa’, in Año mil, año dos mil: dos milenios en la historia de España, ed. by Luis Antonio Ribot García, Julio Valdeón Baruque and Ramón Villares, 2 vols (Madrid: Sociedad Estatal España Nuevo Milenio, 2001), II, 63–80; Juan Pablo Rubio Sadia, ‘Los mozárabes frente al rito romano: balance historiográfico de una relación polémica’, Espacio, Tiempo y Forma.

On the arabisation and orientalisation of al-Andalus during the Umayyad emirate (756–929) and caliphate (929–1031), we follow the terminology adopted in Pierre Guichard, Esplendor y fragilidad de Al-Andalus (Granada: Universidad de Granada, El Legado Andalusí, 2015), pp. 74–78. 16 Chalmeta, Invasión, p. 76; García Sanjuán, La conquista, p. 446.\n\n16\n\nDavid Nogales Ri n c ó n\n\neach formation, and to the balance of power between the two. This relationship was marked by a factor that could be considered, with some exceptions, as a constant: their condition as frontier societies. This frontier between the Islamic and Christian political formations changed as the latter advanced towards the south, until it was ultimately stabilised in the 13th century with the formation of the frontier par excellence between Castile and the Emirate of Granada, known significantly as la Frontera (‘the Frontier’). From the perspective of al-Andalus, this particular frontier awareness was manifested in the perception of al-Andalus as a privileged area for ribat – a military outpost and spiritual retreat – to the point of being considered, in the Islamic religious mentality, as one of the gates to Paradise.17 However, unlike Christian strongholds, al-Andalus showed no territorial ambitions or any desire to involve society as a whole in border defence. This led Julián Clemente Ramos to conclude that, in the case of al-Andalus, it would be better to talk about the existence of border structures rather than frontier societies.18 From the Christian perspective, the existence of the frontier determined the development of features specific to Christian societies in Iberia at the military, institutional, legal and cultural level. Among these features we could mention: a highly militarised society, which raised a caballeria popular or urban cavalry19 and established an economy focused on the capture of war booty;20 the appearance of Hispanic military orders (Calatrava, Santiago or Alcántara)21 that would play an important role in colonisation and border control, and were particularly prevalent in the southern sub-plateau;22 or the formulation of frontier laws, in the various meanings of the term.23 In addition, the colonisation and organization of these 17 Francisco García Fitz, ‘Conflictividad bélica entre cristianos y musulmanes en el medievo\n\n18 19 20 21\n\n22 23\n\nhispánico.

These can be interpreted, on the one hand, as the laws passed in the newly colonised territories during the Middle Ages to create certain conditions of freedom that would attract new settlers, and on the other hand, as the late medieval law that regulated border relations between Castile and Granada in times of war and during ceasefires or periods of peace.

This is mentioned by Alfonso X of Castile (r. 1252–1284) in Las Siete Partidas, where he states that the king must ‘love his land’ and ‘populate it with good people’,26 and by Maestre Pedro (Pedro Gómez Barroso the Elder?, c. 1296–1348) in the Libro del consejo e de los consejeros who points out that one of the aims of the monarchy is ‘to populate barren lands’.27 Secondly, is the importance of the notion of territorial expansion being the main mission of kings, as expressed by Fernando III of Castile (r. 1217–1252) to his son, the future Alfonso X, shortly before his death: ‘if you win more [lands], you will be better than me’,28 or Maestre Pedro’s statement that ‘making good conquests’ is one of the main objectives of royal rulers.29 Thirdly and finally, is the early emphasis placed on the notion of ruling over the territory, embodied in the idea that the monarch exercises his power over particular territories, and not over\n\n24\n\n25 26\n\n27 28 29\n\nmedieval, pp. 69–80; and Pedro Andrés Porras Arboledas, ‘El derecho de frontera durante la Baja Edad Media: la regulación de las relaciones fronterizas en tiempo de treguas y de guerra’, in Estudios dedicados a la memoria del profesor L.M.

This process, which Faustino Menéndez Pidal dates to the beginning of the 10th century, was evidenced by the long titles adopted by some Christian kings, naming each individual kingdom and territories over which they reigned,30 or the designation of the Iberian Peninsula as Hispania/España, instead of naming it after a particular population.31 This process is clearly visible throughout the 12th and 13th centuries, when, in the context of the medieval genesis of the modern State – that is, the absolute monarchy model of state governance that would dominate the European landscape from the 16th to the 18th centuries – the notion of sovereign territorial control arose;32 references to borders multiply;33 notions like the vínculo de naturaleza (‘bond of nature’), that use territoriality to link the king with his subjects, are disseminated;34 new forms of territorial organization are defined as a reflection of the jurisdictional sovereignty of the king;35 and legal localisms are gradually replaced by a territorial legal system.36 The process of incorporating the new territories was sometimes centralised, as in the case the Kingdom of Portugal or the Crown of Castile, where these territories were integrated into a largely homogeneous political and administrative region.37 In other cases, this process occurred under a monarquía compuesta (‘composite monarchy’), as, for example, the Crown of Aragon. In the Aragonese case, the incorporation of new territories was based on the principle of personal union under the sovereignty of a single monarch, in which each component (the 30 For example, the title of the King of Castile ‘rey de Castiella, de Toledo, de León, et de Gallizia,\n\n31 32\n\n33\n\n34\n\n35\n\n36 37\n\net de Sevillia, et de Córdova, et de Murcia, et de Jahén, et de Baeça, et del Algarve’, Alfonso X, Fuero real, ed. by Azucena Palacios Alcaine (Barcelona: PPU, 1991), p. 2.

The presence of Muslim populations in the Christian kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula, known as mudéjares (Mudejars, from the Arabic mudaijan, ‘tributary’), is an important factor in the social, cultural and religious history of the region. These populations were absorbed to a greater or lesser extent by the Christian kingdoms in their advance towards the south. For example, as Miguel Ángel Ladero Quesada points out, large Muslim populations remained in the area of Valencia in the middle decades of the 13th century after the Christian conquest, owing to the shortage of Christian settlers; while in the Balearics, the free Muslim population disappeared, and the islands were completely repopulated by Christian settlers.39 A similar situation occurred in some regions of Castile, such as Andalusia. There, following the defeat of the Mudejar revolt of Andalusia and Murcia (1264–1267), the Muslim population was drastically reduced to a few unevenly distributed enclaves as a result of mass emigration to Granada and, in specific cases, conversion to Christianity. This reduced the Andalusian Mudejar population to a residual minority, concentrated in urban centres of certain importance, such as Cordoba, Seville, Ecija (Seville) or Niebla (Huelva).40 In addition, because of the circumstances of the conquest – the demographic balance between Christian and Muslim populations played an important role – relations between the Christian majority and these Islamic populations varied greatly, as described by Brian A. Catlos in relation to the region of the Ebro River and Valencia.41 The parallel presence of Muslim populations in the Christian kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula, together with other fundamental factors identified by Enrique Cantera Montenegro,42 could explain the long stay of the second minority population in the Iberian Peninsula, the Jews. This shared experience between Christians, Muslims and Jews forms the basis of the historiographical image of the España de las tres culturas (‘Spain of the three cultures’), based on the theory of the tres castas (‘three castes’) as the origin of Spanish idiosyncrasy, formulated by Americo Castro.43 Different concepts, such as coexistencia or convivencia (‘coexistence’) and\n\n39 Ladero Quesada, ‘España’, pp. 39–40. 40 Manuel González Jiménez, ‘Los mudéjares andaluces: una minoría residual’, Revista de\n\nOccidente, 224 (2000), 67–78 (pp. 73–77).\n\n41 Brian G.

This domination of one group over another, typical of Christian feudal societies, would eventually create varying degrees of tension that tended to increase in times of economic difficulties and in conjunction with the rise, at the end of the Middle Ages, of the notion of a religious homogeneous Christian state.45 These tendencies, according to Elena Lourie, gained momentum in the case of the Jews and Muslims because of their propensity to live apart in voluntary isolation from a Christian culture which they shunned.46 Despite this inequality, the multi-religious and multicultural status of the Iberian Christian societies and their contact with al-Andalus shaped the Peninsula as a sphere of transfer of Islamic and Andalusi culture towards the kingdoms in the north of the Peninsula on the one hand, in terms of art (Fig. 1.1), customs, clothing, vocabulary or technology;47 and on the other, to Latin Europe, 44 The terminological issue was addressed in Ana Isabel Carrasco Manchado, De la convivencia a la\n\nexclusión.

Siglos XIII–XVII (Madrid: Sílex Ediciones, 2012), pp. 20–23, where the author justified the use of the term ‘hierarchical coexistence’ (convivencia jerarquizada) as opposed to the ‘democratic coexistence’ (convivencia democrática) characteristic of modern societies, in Carrasco Manchado, De la convivencia, p. 26. 45 The issue has been addressed by various authors, such as Vicente Ángel Álvarez Palenzuela, ‘Christians, Muslims and Jews. Convivencia, tolerancia y conflicto’, in Año mil, año dos mil, pp. 275–301, García Fitz, ‘Las minorías’, and Carrasco Manchado, De la convivencia. Some notes on the relationship between the consolidation of the modern State and the reinforcement of Christian identity can be found in Miguel Ángel Motis Dolader, ‘Quiebra de la estructura multiconfesional en la Corona de Aragón y nacimiento del Estado moderno’, in La Corona de Aragón y el Mediterráneo, siglos XV–XVI, pp. 155–230. 46 Elena Lourie, ‘Anatomy of Ambivalence. Muslims under the Crown of Aragon in the Late Thirteenth Century’, in Elena Lourie, Crusade and Colonisation. Muslims, Christians and Jews in Medieval Aragon (Aldershot: Variorum, 1990), pp. 1–77 (p. 76). 47 For some examples see Fernando Martínez Nespral, Un juego de espejos: rasgos mudéjares de la arquitectura y el habitar en la España de los siglos XVI–XVII (Buenos Aires: Nobuko, 2007); Ricardo Córdoba de la Llave, ‘Influencias orientales en la artesanía andaluza de la Baja Edad Media’, in Andalucía entre Oriente y Occidente (1236–1492) (Córdoba: Diputación de Córdoba, 1988), pp. 585– 98; María Martínez Martínez, ‘Influencias islámicas en la indumentaria medieval española’, Estudios sobre Patrimonio, Cultura y Ciencias Medievales, 13–14 (2012), 187–222; Thomas F.

In some cases, the direct influence of the Andalusi or Mudejar populations on the Christian kingdoms can be seen. But in others, these influences would be the result of indirect contacts, mainly driven by the Christian elite’s dissemination of a series of artistic interests that were sometimes shared by the political elite of the Mediterranean region.50 Either way, when studying these processes, in line with Guichard, we must avoid the error, pointed out by Francisco García Fitz, of associating cultural exchange with the notion of tolerance or coexistence. This is because cultural exchanges or loans, or even more complex phenomena such as acculturation or cultural symbiosis, do not necessarily imply a prior situation of equality or respect between the parties to this transaction.51 Relations between the Christian majority and minority populations were not only shaped by internal determinants, but also by the global frameworks of Christianity, which help to explain some historical processes, as, for example,\n\n48\n\n49 50\n\n51\n\nof Islamic culture on the Christian kingdoms has been viewed in different ways by historians. Examples can be found in two opposing interpretations of these processes in Claudio Sánchez Albornoz, España, un enigma histórico (Buenos Aires: Editorial Sudamericana, 1956) and Castro, La realidad. Juan Vernet, Lo que Europa debe al Islam de España (Barcelona: Acantilado, 2006). This activity, which dates back to the 10th and 11th centuries, would result in many works being translated, particularly from the middle of the 12th century to the end of the 13th. The translations were primarily carried out in the valley of the Ebro, and particularly Toledo, the site of what has come to be called ‘the School of Translators of Toledo’, even though such an institution never existed. The most prominent translators were, as Pierre Guichard points out, Jews rather than Muslims; Esplendor, p. 247. There are some notes on this issue in Eloy Benito Ruano, ‘Ámbito y ambiente de la Escuela de traductores de Toledo’, Espacio, Tiempo y Forma. Serie III. Historia Medieval, 13 (2000), 13–28 and La Escuela de Traductores de Toledo. Exposición celebrada en la Sinagoga del Tránsito, ed. by Ana María López Álvarez et al.

This was not a permanent, uniform or monolithic confrontation, because Christians and Muslims sometimes formed alliances in order to achieve internal goals.55 Nevertheless, relations between Christians and Muslims during the period analysed were marked by open tension and rivalry sustained over time. This was rather like a guerra tivia (‘cold war’, but literally ‘warm war’), which, in the words of Don Juan Manuel ‘brings neither peace nor honour to the one who engages in it, nor implies that there is goodness or effort in him’.56 In al-Andalus, this confrontation was marked by a particular kind of holy war: the Islamic notion of Jihad (literally ‘struggle’).57 This notion was important from 52 Cf.

Resnick (Turnhout: Brepols, 2018), pp. 183–98. Cantera Montenegro, ‘Judíos medievales’, pp. 201–02. For example, in 1282, a confrontation arose between the Castilian King Alfonso X and his son the Infante Sancho, during the course of which, whilst Alfonso established an alliance with the North African Marinids, Sancho did so with the Emir of Granada, Muhammad II; Francisco García Fitz, ‘Alfonso X y sus relaciones con el Emirato granadino: política y guerra’, Alcanate: Revista de Estudios Alfonsíes, 4 (2004–2005), 35–78 (pp. 74–75). As an additional example, it is also worth considering the alliances that the Emir of Granada, Muhammad XII, known as Boabdil, established at the end of the 15th century with the Catholic Monarchs, in part of the internal civil war against his uncle Muhammad XIII, el-Zagal; Cristóbal Torres Delgado, ‘El reino nazarí de Granada (siglos XIII–XV)’, in La incorporación de Granada a la Corona de Castilla, ed. by Miguel Ángel Ladero Quesada (Granada: Diputación Provincial de Granada, 1993), pp. 747–77 (pp. 776–77). ‘nin trae paz nin da onra al que la faze, nin da a entender que ha en él vondat nin esfuerzo’; Don Juan Manuel, Libro de los Estados, ed. by Ian R.

First, the goticismo (‘gothism’) or neogoticismo (‘neogothism’) of the court of Alfonso III of Asturias (866-910), who sought to present this emerging political formation in the north of the Peninsula as heir to the extinct Visigothic Kingdom of Toledo. From these ideas derived its legitimacy to carry out the restauratio (‘restoration’) of the theoretical Visigothic political and ecclesiastical order that had been eradicated after the Islamic conquest of 711.59 Secondly, crusadism, which emanated from the pontificate and was manifested for the first time in the Peninsula with the Crusade of Barbastro (Huesca), sanctioned by Pope Alexander II in 1064.60 Pontifical intervention bolstered the religious dimension of the conflict, hitherto less explicit, and deepened the sacralising elements.61 In this way, both traditions provided ideological support for the expansion of the Christian kingdoms to the south, through a process of military conquest.
