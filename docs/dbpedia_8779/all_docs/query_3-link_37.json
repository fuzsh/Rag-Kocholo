        "text": "Throughout the Middle Ages, in both Constantinople and the West, the installation of relics connected to Christ, martyrs, saints, and the Holy Land was used to augment the status and power of churches and chapels. This essay explores the transmission of relics from the Holy Land to Constantinople and Europe, emphasizing the importance of these relics in enhancing the connections to the Holy Land. The examination of medieval writings and relics reveals the wealth of Constantinople and the veneration that crusaders, pilgrims, and religious leaders held for the objects that were taken from the East. Military conquest brought most of the relics from the East to Constantinople, and a burst of church construction during the emperor Constantine’s reign in the 4th century AD provided the housing for these holy objects. In later centuries, gifting became the most common means of transfer of the objects from Byzantium to the West, further spreading the relics among Europe. The significance of these physical links to the Holy Land is also sometimes reinforced by the architecture of the structures in which the relics were housed and worshiped. The final section of the essay examines the relics installed in the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris, built by King Louis IX of France to house the precious objects he obtained from a financially weak Constantinople in the thirteenth century. Beyond the Sainte-Chapelle’s aesthetic brilliance, the architecture served to help connect the chapel to the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem and Louis IX to King Solomon himself. The dedication of the chapel and its function as a reliquary for the holy objects of the Passion also signified the designation of Paris as the new Holy Land in the thirteenth century.\n\nThe reliquary-altar piece of the Monastery of Saint Mary of Piedra, whose inscription dates it to 1390, in the times of Abbot Martín Ponce Pérez, is among the foremost examples of the hybridization of Christian, Islamic and Jewish styles in late-medieval Spanish art. It was built to exhibit the most valuable relics of the Cistercian monastery, including a bleeding loaf whose transubstantiation occurred during a Mass in 1380, and since 1851 it has been preserved in the Royal Academy of History, Madrid. This article presents the scientific community with the identity of the hands that created it at the end of the fourteenth century: the first master of Piedra, the second master of Piedra, the Jewish painters Juan and Guillén de Levi and the carpenters.\n\nThe paper discusses 57 relics from the Holy Land in the Roman Sancta Sanctorum Chapel, collected by the Popes from ca. 600 to 900 A. D. Using statistical analysis it is designed to answer the following questions: (1) What information does the Lateran treasure provide concerning the way relics were acquired in early Islamic Palestine and the practices of post-antique pilgrimage? (2) What conclusions regarding their agents and bearers can be drawn from the quality, accessibility, and topographical distribution of these relics? (3) Through what ways and political channels did the relics come to Rome and to the papal court? (4) What were the prevailing political, social, and economic conditions that allowed for the high mobility of relics between Jerusalem and Rome in the early Middle Ages?"
