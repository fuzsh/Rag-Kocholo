        "text": "The Spanish Jew-The Sephardim\n\nSECTION I. What is a Jew?\n\nWhen writing about what constitutes being a Jew, one must remember that there are many people with both personal and religious views on the subject, some objective and some subjective. For those who are Jewish or consider themselves to be Jews, the importance cannot be understated. As for myself, I offer the following as a series of self-revelations based upon some study, but personal revelations none the less. I will leave the final outcomes and decisions of what is right and wrong on the matters discussed here with the professional historians and DNA experts.\n\nAs the writer of this chapter, the content has had an extraordinary impact upon me. The research of the Sephardim necessary to prepare for its writing required a review of issues spanning thousands of years of Jewish history. Ultimately, as the scribe I found myself reflecting upon Israel as an ancient nation and Judaism, its religion, its reason for being. Eventually, the loss of nationhood and its implications to a people left without a land to call their own crept into my psyche. The realization of it had a profound effect upon me. It raised many questions in my mind. How can a people exist without a country, a home to call their own? What would it be like to be a permanently stranded, unwanted guest? Why was it so important to the Jews to maintain a separate and distinct religion and culture in so many foreign lands, over these many thousands of years? How could a people endure such millennia of hatred, mistreatment, injustice, cruelty, rape, torture, murder, and savagery when they could have simply assimilated into their host countries and ended much of the persecution? How could a people have such faith in their G-d as to believe that they would eventually be returned to the land He intended for them to possess? Relative to many of these questions, I remain perplexed. However, Im left with an impression of a people that have an indomitable spirit and a faith worthy of their G-d. Im also humbled by their strength and commitment to their beliefs.\n\nAs the reader will soon become aware, being a Jew has always come with a very, very high price. Since the beginning, when Israel was first unified as the 12 Tribes and later as a divided Israel (Israel and Judea) the Jewish nation has been under constant siege by various entities (Empires, surrounding tribes, Christianity, Islam, etc.). The result has been a nation plagued by war, destruction, and outright slavery. The people of the Promised Land have suffered repeated destruction of their most sacred places, the forced removal from their homeland on many occasions, and restriction from the return and resettlement of their lands.\n\nThroughout the centuries theyve been held in captivity by various nations and in many locations. While in captivity the Jewish people have suffered grave injustices, rejection, exclusion, oppression, murder, rape, forced religious conversion, their children forcefully removed from their custody and care, endured cultural and religious re-education, and in many cases the children were never returned to their rightful parents (Stolen). Think of this people of Jewish ancestry and/or religious self-identification continually being coerced and forced to convert to alien religions by torture and duress (Under pain of death). Would you endure it? Could you endure it?\n\nThe aftermath of those thousands of years of unyielding outside pressure and attempted religious and cultural obliteration has only resulted in the increased faith in their G-d, the G-d of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. In the end, after living hell on earth theyve returned to the land of their fathers, Israel. These thousands of years of oppression has left them weary and often times hostile toward the world of non-Jews.\n\nGiven the aforementioned, the importance of establishing a basis of agreement for the concept of, what is a Jew is of paramount importance for those who uphold and love Judaism. This becomes all important to those who have fought and died to keep Judaism alive and intact as a religion and culture. When one looks at the question through the lens of Jewish history with its turbulent and destructive outcomes, inclusion and exclusion become very real issues. For those concerned with the protection and survival of Judaism, who should and should not be accepted as a legitimate Jew is a question of great urgency. As history informs them there exists a constant potential that their religion and culture may be taken from them at any moment. For those wishing to be accepted as Jews, the questions of who is and who is not a Jew are also of great importance. This is an essential element of who they see themselves as, and who they are.\n\nFor both Jewish religious authorities and the modern state of Israel, the Anusim, the descendents of those tens of thousands of Jews that left the observance of Judaism for other religious or non-religious practices, represent a modern-day dilemma. To maintain some semblance of order, structure, and definition for a modern Jewish state and culture, Jews are forced to establish boundaries for who is and who is not a Jew. For the Anusim, that legal category of Jews in halakha (Jewish law) who were forced to abandon Judaism against their will, typically while forcibly converted to another religion, the matter of being an accepted Jew has become an arena of heated debate. Their acceptance by observant Jews has been, and is problematic. This applies in a very personal way to, we Sephardic Jews which became Conversos.\n\nFor the numerically large number of Sephardic Jewish communities of Spain, both accepted and unaccepted, being a Jew has become an issue of religious and cultural self-identification.\n\nThe American Journal of Human Genetics in December of 2008 stated that 19.8 percent of modern Iberians (Spaniards and Portuguese) have DNA reflecting Sephardic Jewish ancestry. The 2008 population census of Spain stood at 46,063,000. This could mean that approximately 9, 120,500 individuals in Spain may be of Jewish ancestry. Thus, some portion of the \"Anusim\" whether \"coerced\", \"forced\", or voluntarily converted (Conversos) is at the crossroads of religious and cultural identification. For some, this has become a crisis of identity. What of the tens of millions of the descendents of the non-observant Conversos in the Spanish New World? If all of these are rejected by their fellow Jews (Observant) and the modern state of Israel, do they become a loosely affiliated, unwanted, 2nd tier of Jewish wannabes? Picture a 21st Century with tens of millions of Conversos aligned with little Israel in a partnership of shared ancestry, religion, culture, and history. Issues, issues, and all of those greater issues!\n\nIt is easily understood that the great majority of those who are not Jewish have little interest in the subject. And then there are the haters, those who tend to see everything Jewish as evil and bad. Obviously, this chapter is not written for them. It is in fact written for those who are interested in Spanish history, its people, and those many outcomes that derived from the actions taken Spain as a new nation, by its official religion (Catholicism), Monarchy and nobility, and its people.\n\nFrom the Sephardim of Spain and Portugal (c. 1490s C.E.) arose the Conversos, those that converted to Catholicism (Christianity) and left the observance of Judaism for fear of the loss of property, livelihood, torture, and/or death. Perhaps genuinely accepting the Christian Messiah was the genesis of their choice. Whatever the cause, a schism has existed between the observant Jew and the Conversos for millennia. This is one more reason that the presenting of this chapter has been extraordinarily difficult, akin to walking barefoot on broken glass.\n\nFirstly, in an effort to provide some understanding of what it means to be Jewish, one must establish a succinct and structured view for the reader of what constitutes being Jewish. The basis of which must be an agreed upon construct by the interested parties. That is to say, while the Jewish peoples share a common beginning they also differ culturally and genetically. The beginning was the spring or tribes (Genetics) that brought forth Judaism. Of interest is the fact that the answer to what is an acceptable form (Rabbinical agreement) of Judaism (Religion) may be based upon a decision embraced and promulgated by a few members of todays Judaism, who are in part grafted into the original community of Israelite tribes from non-original gene pools. However, in all fairness it must be noted that the very survival of both modern Israel (The state) and Judaism is a result of this observant, modern-day, mixture of original and grafted on peoples of observant Judaism.\n\nWith this in mind, it is commonly understood that he/she is a member of the Jewish people and cultural community whose traditional religion is Judaism and who may or may not trace their origins through the ancient Hebrew people of Israel to Abraham. There are also questions about Jewish identity and considerations of Jewish self-identification which are constantly being explored. This is because issues related to Jewish personhood have religious, cultural, genealogical, personal, historical, and political implications. Therefore, the definition of who is a Jew varies according to what is being considered. It may be based on normative religious statutes, self-identification, or other concerns. The definition depends on many aspects of Jewish identity which can include characteristics of ethnicity or conversion.\n\nFor a simple definition, a person is Jewish by birth or may become a Jew through religious conversion. It is reported that about 80% of Jewish males and 50% of Jewish females trace their ancestry back to the Middle East. The remainder entered the Jewish gene pool through conversion, intermarriage, or other means. Those who did intermarry often left the faith in a few generations. But many converts became interwoven into the Jewish genealogical line. One can reflect upon the iconic convert, the biblical Ruth, who married Boaz and became the great-grandmother of King David. Ruth began as an outsider. However, you cant be much more Jewish than of the bloodline of King David.\n\nIf left there it might seem to be a simple matter. But its not and never will be. One must accept that when dealing with something as special and personal as religion and its affiliation, there will be differences of opinion. And there are! In the application of a definition among the differing branches of Judaism this may include the issue of mixed parents, conversion, and historical loss of Jewish identity (As in the case of Spains Conversos). Jewish ethnic divisions also refer to a number of distinctive communities within the world's ethnically Jewish population, although considered one single self-identifying ethnicity.\n\nSelf-identifying ethnicity as it relates to cultural identity is the identity or feeling of belonging to, as part of the self-conception and self-perception to nationality, ethnicity, religion, social class, generation, locality and any kind of social group that have its own distinct culture. In this way cultural identity is both characteristic of the individual and also of the culturally identified group. Therefore, cultural identity is similar to and overlaps with identity politics.\n\nThere are distinctive ethnic divisions among Jews, most of which are primarily the result of:\n\n· Geographic branching from an originating Israelite population\n\n· Mixing with local populations\n\n· Subsequent independent evolutions\n\nFrom biblical times, cultural and linguistic differences between Jewish communities, even within the area of ancient Israel and Judea are observed both within the Bible itself as well as from archeological remains. In more recent human history, an array of Jewish communities were established by Jewish settlers in various places around the Old World, often at great distances from one another resulting in effective and often long-term isolation from each other.\n\nDuring the millennia of the Jewish Diaspora the communities would develop under the influence of their local environments such as:\n\n· Political (Political environment)\n\n· Cultural (Jewish culture is the international culture of the Jews. Since the formation of the Jewish nation in biblical\n\ntimes the international community of Jewish people has been considered a tribe or an ethno-religious group rather\n\nthan solely a religion.)\n\n· Natural (Natural environment)\n\n· Populational (The area that is used to define a sexual population is defined as the area where inter-breeding is\n\npotentially possible between any pair within the area. The probability of interbreeding is greater than the probability\n\nof cross-breeding with individuals from other areas. Under normal conditions, breeding is substantially more\n\ncommon within the area than across the border.)\n\nToday, manifestation of these differences among the Jews can be observed in Jewish cultural expressions of each community, including:\n\n· Jewish linguistic diversity (Sephardic Ladino Vs. Ashkenazi Yiddish)\n\n· Culinary preferences\n\n· Liturgical practices (Liturgy is the customary public worship done by a specific religious group, according to its\n\nparticular beliefs, customs and traditions.)\n\n· Religious interpretations\n\n· Degrees and sources of genetic admixture (Genetic admixture occurs when individuals from two or more previously\n\nseparated populations begin interbreeding. Admixture results in the introduction of new genetic lineages into a\n\npopulation. It has been known to slow local adaptation by introducing foreign, un-adapted genotypes (known as gene\n\nswamping). It also prevents speciation by homogenizing populations.)\n\n· Genetic studies regarding todays Jews are part of population genetics. This discipline is used to better understand\n\nthe chronology of migration and complements the results provided by history, archeology, language or paleontology.\n\nThe interest of these studies is to investigate the origins of various Jewish populations. In particular, they investigate\n\nwhether there is a common genetic heritage among various Jewish populations.\n\nSECTION II. What is a Sephardim?\n\nSecondly, we must acquaint the reader with what is meant by Sephardim. For the purpose of this chapter, a short explanation must be given explaining what is a Sephardic Jew and where they came from. For simplicitys sake, we have provided an accepted view of how Sephardic Jews are defined. They were those Jews living on the Iberian Peninsula prior to 1492 C.E. and who experienced tragic events when the Edict of Expulsion was signed by their Most Catholic Majesties, King Ferdinand of Aragón and Queen Isabella of Castille andLeón.\n\nThe Jews of Spain are known as Sephardic Jews or simply Sephardim. They are a Jewish ethnic division whose ethnogenesis and emergence as a distinct community of Jews coalesced on the Iberian Peninsula as a permanently displaced and relocated collective. As Sephardic communities were established throughout Iberia, in what is known today as Spain and Portugal, they evolved distinctive Sephardic characteristics:\n\n· Identity\n\n· Style of liturgy\n\n· Law\n\n· Customs\n\n· Diasporic identity\n\nTheir community was brought to an end starting with the issuance of the Alhambra Decree by Spain's Catholic Monarchs in the late 15th Century C.E., resulting in executions, mass conversions, and a combination of internal and external migrations. However, an estimated 13,000 to 40,000 Jews live in Spain today. In the latest population census in Israel Sephardim represented the majority around 55%, with Ashkenazim at 45%.\n\nInterestingly, the Sephardim are the less well known of the Jewish peoples. It has been suggested that Jews settled in the land of Sepharad or Sefarad, as Spain was called in Hebrew language, very early. There are three much discussed, possible migration scenarios from the Holy Land which introduced the Jews into Iberia. Each has its reasons for being correct and each has its drawbacks. According to the oldest Jewish traditions it is suggested that the first Jews arrived in Spain in one of King Solomon's fleets with Hiram's Phoenicians in B.C.E. Their mission was to conduct business with Tarsus. These appear to be the same boats of Tarsus that the biblical prophet Jonah boarded and which must have arrived at the Tartessos of the Guadalquivir.\n\nA second tradition suggests their arrival as refugees in Spain occurred soon after the Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar II conquered Jerusalem and destroyed the Temple in 587 B.C.E. These joined their compatriots who had come earlier during the Phoenician trading era. Though all this is possible, there is little hard evidence to support it.\n\nThe third and more accepted explanation is to assume that the first Jewish settlements in the Iberian Peninsula took place after Jerusalem was destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E. The war against Rome and the complete destruction of the Temple opened up the great Jewish Diaspora (dispersion) throughout the Mediterranean. The Diaspora could have easily reached Roman Hispania (Spain) in the 1st Century C.E.\n\nNotes:\n\nAn important piece of 1st Century C.E. information is Saint Peter's epistle to the Romans about his visit to Spain. This could indicate the presence of Jewish communities on the Peninsula. Also at this time, Jonathan ben Uziel (Died the 26th day of Sivan, June, year unknown) identified Spain with the Biblical Sepharad which resulted in Spanish Jews referring to one another as \"Sephardic.\"\n\nThere is also a legend among the Sephardim that the city of Toletum or Toledo, the capital city of Visigoth Spain, was founded by Jewish refugees from Jerusalem. A popular etymology has been used to explain its name, pronounced by the Jews Tolaitola, to be derived from the Hebrew word \"tolatola\" exile, or, according to another explanation, from \"toledoth\" or generations. The Sephardim considered this city a second Jerusalem and recreated what could be called a new Palestine around it. It is believed by some that the towns of Escaluna, Maqueda, Jopez, and Azeque were built on the adjacent lands in memory of the Palestinian Ashkalon, Makedda, Joppa (Yafo) and Azeka.\n\nThere are many Sephardic families such as the Ibn-Daud and Abrabanel (Abravanel) who proudly claimed their descendance from the house of King David, Solomon's father.\n\nThe father of Binyamin Netanyahu, Israels current (2015) Prime minister and celebrated Israeli historian, Benzion Netanyahu has placed Spains 1492 C.E. Jewish population at 225,000. Others have estimated that on July 30, 1492 C.E., the entire Jewish Community had an approximate population of between 225,000 and 230,000. This represented perhaps 2% of Spain's population at the time. While the numbers may be disputed, it is claimed that of this estimated Jewish population, 50,000 were baptized Catholic (Conversos) and remained.\n\nHistorically, the native language or native dialect of Sephardic Jews was Ladino, a Romance language derived from Old Spanish. It incorporates elements from all the old Romance languages of the Iberian Peninsula, Hebrew, Aramaic, and in the lands receiving those who were exiled Ottoman Turkish, Levantine Arabic, Greek, Bulgarian, and Serbo-Croatian vocabulary. The traditional vernacular language of North African Sephardim was Haketia, a form of Judeo-Spanish. It was also derived from Old Spanish and heavily influenced by Hebrew, Aramaic, and Maghrebi Arabic. The ex-Converso Western Sephardim traditionally spoke Spanish and/or Portuguese, or a mixture combining elements of both.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, one example of the Sephardic families is the Abravanel family. It is one of the oldest and most distinguished Jewish families of the Iberian Peninsula. These can trace their origin from the biblical King David. It is reported that members of this family lived in Seville, Córdoba, Castille-León, and Calatayud. Additionally, Jewish communities were founded in Carthago Nova (Cartagena), Granada, Saragosse, Aragón, and other areas of the Iberian Peninsula. Don Judah Abravanel, its most prominent representative, once lived in Seville. Don Judah was said to be a treasurer and tax-collector under Sancho IV (1284 C.E.-1295 C.E.) and Ferdinand IV (1295 C.E.-1312 C.E.).\n\nThese are some examples of other Sephardic surnames names from Portugal and Gibraltar which show the changes made over the years: Abeasis, Abecassis, Abensur, Abitbol, Aboab, Abohbot, Absidid, Abudarham, Acris, Adrehi, Aflalo, Albo, Alkaim, Amar, Amram, Amselem, Amzalak, Anahory, Asayol, Askenazi, Assayag, Athias, Atrutel, Auday, Azancot, Azavey, Azerad, Azuelos, Azulay, Balensi, Banon, Baquis, Barchilom, Baruel, Berlilo, Benabu, Benady, Benaim, Benamor, Benarus, Benatar, Benbunan, Benchaya, Benchetrit, Benchimol, Bendahan, Bendelack, Bendran, Benelisha, Beneluz, Benhayon, Beniso, Benitah, Benjamim, Benjo, Benmergui, Benmiyara, Benmuyal, Benoalid, Benoliel, Benrimoj, Benros, Bensabat, Bensadon, Bensaloha, Bensaude, Benselum, Bensheton, Bensimon, Bensliman, Bensusan, Bentata, Bentubo, Benudis, Benyuli, Benyunes, Benzacar, Benzaquen, Benzecry, Benzimra, Berdugo, Bergel, Bibas, Blum, Bohudana, Brigham, Brudo, Buzaglo, Bytton, Cagi, Cansino, Cardoso, Carseni, Castel, Cazes, Cohen, Conquy, Coriat, Cubi, Danan, Davis, Delmar, Elmaleh, Esaguy, Esnaty, Farache, Ferares, Finsi, Foinquinos, Fresco , Gabay, Gabizon, Garson, Hadida, Hassan, Hatchuel, Israel, Kadoshi, Katzan, Labos, Laluff, Laredo, Lasry, Lengui, Levi, Malca, Maman, Marques, Marrache, Martins, Massias, Matana, Megueres, Melul, Moreira, Mor-Jose, Mucznik, Muginstein, Muller, Nahon, Namias, Nathan, Obadia, Ohana, Oliveira, Pacifico, Pallache, Pariente, Pimienta, Pinto, Querub, Roffe, Ruah, Rygor, Sabath, Salama, Sananes, Saragga, Schocron, Sebag, Segal, Sequerra, Serfaty, Serequi, Serrafe, Seruya, Sicsu, Tangi, Tapiero, Taregano, Taurel, Tedesqui, Tobelem, Toledano, Tuati, Uziel, Varicas, Wahnon, Waknin, Wolfinsohn, Zafrany, Zagury.\n\nJewish society dictated the origins of ancient Jewish names within the Jewish community. Patronymics, such as David ben (son of) Joseph or Sarah bat (daughter of) Aaron were used. Jewish legal documents in synagogues such as the ketubah (marriage contract) have Jewish names in this form.\n\nSpecialists in this field believe that it is possible to trace the events of Jewish history by studying the names used by Jews in certain times and locations. To establish Sephardic Jewish surnames originating in Spain and Portugal the origins and meaning of family names, locations, and a wide variety of sources have been used where the names are cited. In medieval Spain Jews used Hebrew names. After the Muslim conquest of Iberia, Arabic became the spoken language (8th Century C.E.-12th Century C.E.) Jewish names became more Arabic sounding.\n\nFrom the end of the Golden Age, the beginning of the Reconquista (The era during which Christian Kings enlarged Spanish Christian territory), and until the July 1492 C.E. expulsion, Jews used a variety of name spellings.\n\nOf those surviving Jewish surnames, lists of unique medieval spellings of names must be browsed to determine if they have survived after 500 years. To accomplish this, the following points had to be first clarified:\n\n1. Name spellings\n\n2. Surnames can be written in many different languages.\n\n3. Medieval scribes and notaries such as those of the royal court wrote down names as they heard or understood them.\n\n4. During these periods of time, names did not yet have a fixed orthography. The methodology for the writing a language which includes rules of spelling, hyphenation, capitalization, word breaks, emphasis, and punctuation was not yet a fixed process. Thus, it happened that one single document might contain two or three different spellings of a same name. As a result, a surviving name may have many, many different spellings.\n\nAnother part of the name process is the separating of names from their numerous prefixes in order find out the surviving name. Prefixes which have been found include:\n\n· A/The: A, Al, Ça, Des, Dez, El, Ha, L, La, Sa\n\n· Father of: Abo, Abu, Abul, Bu\n\n· From: D, De, De la, Del, Den\n\n· Qualifier or title: Bel, Bien, Bon, Buen, Don\n\n· Son of: Ab, Abe, Aben, Abi, Abin, Abn, Amna, Apen, Auen, Aven, Avin, Bar, Bem, Ben, Eben, Em, En, Euen, Even, Ibn, Haben, N, Na, Uen, Ven\n\nThese prefixes are in several languages such as, Arabic, Aramaic, Hebrew, Catalan, and Spanish. Many are resulting deformations or contractions of originals such as N for Ibn.\n\nWith the exception of some Iberian aristocrats, wealthy people, and prosperous merchants surnames were not used by most Jews. When Jews did adopt family names in the 18th and 19th centuries C.E., the choice was frequently patronymic (a name derived from the name of a father or ancestor, typically by the addition of a prefix or suffix), and first names thus became family names.\n\nPrior to the Napoleonic era in Eastern Europe of the Early-19th Century C.E., most of the Ashkenazi Jews (Jews of central or eastern European descent) from countries captured by Napoleon (Including Russia, Poland, and Germany) were ordered to use surnames due to a need for tax collection. Soon after Napoleons defeat many Jews eliminated surnames and returned to \"son of\" names.\n\nSECTION III. What is an Ashkenazi Jew?\n\nThirdly, the most well known of the Jewish people in the world are the Ashkenazi Jews or the Jews of Germany. This Jewish ethnic division is thought to have coalesced around the end of the 1st millennium C.E. in the Holy Roman Empire. The traditional language of Ashkenazi Jews consisted of various dialects of Yiddish (Originated during the 9th Century C.E. in Central Europe. This provided the nascent Ashkenazi community with an extensive Germanic based vernacular fused with elements taken from Hebrew and Aramaic, as well as from Slavic languages and traces of Romance languages.).\n\nThe Ashkenazi established communities throughout Central and Eastern Europe. This has been their primary region of residence and where they evolved their distinctive characteristics and diasporic identities until recent times. It has been estimated that in the 11th Century C.E., Ashkenazi represented only 3 percent of the world's Jewish population. However, by 1931 C.E., this group accounted for 92 percent of the world's Jews, at approximately 16.7 million just prior to the Holocaust. This may be explained in part by the disruption of Sephardic Jewish life in Spain and the expulsion of that large Jewish population in 1492 C.E.\n\nSome relatively recent statistics vary for the contemporary demography of Ashkenazi. These vary between 10 million and 11.2 million. One calculation of Sephardic and Mizrahi Jews implies that Ashkenazi make up less than 74% of Jewry worldwide. There are other estimates which place Ashkenazi Jews as at about 75% of Jews worldwide.\n\nJust as the Sephardim made great contributions to Iberia and later Spain when she became a great empire, the Ashkenazi have done the same for Europe in its culture and in most fields of endeavor. This includes art, literature, music, philosophy, scholarship, and the sciences. It is also a fact that Jews have made quite a remarkable and disproportionate contribution to the rest of humanity. Unfortunately, the Holocausts genocidal impact during World War II resulted in the mass murder of approximately 6 million Jews. It devastated the Ashkenazi and their Yiddish culture.\n\nSECTION IV. What is a Jewish Converso?\n\nFourthly, Spanish laws of the 14th and 15th centuries C.E. became increasingly oppressive toward observant Sephardic Jews. This will be discussed at some length in the timeline that follows. The circumstances dictated the forced conversion of Jews to Catholicism. Many simply accepted forced conversion to Christianity as a means for saving their lives and fortunes. Obviously conversion was a most attractive alternative to torture and/or death. Again, it should be emphasized here that while many middle class Jews outwardly adopted Christianity to avoid the penalties of the egregious laws, they continued observance of Judaism in secret. This would become problematic for the Catholic Church, the nobility, and the populous at large.\n\nIn the case of my progenitors, the de Riberas, they were Sephardim. At issue is the reality that they eventually lost their Jewish identity due to conversion. As Spanish Jews living in 15th Century C.E. Spain, they were subject to actions taken by the Crown and Church in which many Spanish Jews converted (Conversos in Spanish) to Roman Catholicism voluntarily or were forced to convert.\n\nAt this juncture it should be noted that many Sephardim chose not to abandon their Judaism. Some fled to North Africa, Italy, and Navarre (Then a kingdom on the border between Spain and France). Many more went to Portugal, though Portugal itself would soon demand conversion and thousands of Jews there would also undergo baptism.\n\nThere have been many labels applied to converted Sephardim Conversos, Marranos, New Christians, Crypto-Jews, Secret Jews, and Anusim. Each had its reason for application.\n\nThe term Converso is taken from Conversus, a Latin word meaning the converted. Here the matter becomes more complicated. It had application to two groups of Jewish converts to Christianity and their descendants.\n\n1. The first group to convert did so as a result of the 1391 C.E. massacres in Spain and the zealous proselytizing efforts of the following decades.\n\n2. A second group did so as a result of the decree by the Catholic Monarchs, Ferdinand and Isabella, in 1492 C.E. This would force the expulsion of all Jews who refused to accept Christianity, thus causing many to seek baptism. Their ranks had swelled to an estimated 50,000. Of Spain's 125,000 to 200,000 (Another estimate) Jews, these accepted baptism. They joined approximately 225,000 descendants of the Conversos of previous generations.\n\n3. In Portugal, a third group was converted by force by King Manuel in 1497 C.E.\n\nThe term Marrano was also applied across Iberia (Spain and Portugal) to the descendants of Jews baptized into Catholicism and suspected of secret adherence to Judaism. Marranos also appeared with the first riots in the Juderias (Jewish quarters) of Spain. There have been various suggested origins for the term Marrano. Some have suggested that originally it was a term of contempt meaning \"swine\", now in general use. Some say that it was likely a reference to the Jews' reluctance to eat pork, but this is doubtful.\n\nAnother view is that it stems from the Hebrew phrase marit ayin. This is a very important concept, as it may lead to the prohibition of certain acts. Marit ayin or maris ayin, the appearance to the eye\", is a concept in halakha (Jewish law in Ashkenazic) or \"the path\" or \"the way of walking\". Marit ayin can be defined as the act of avoiding of the doing of something which may raise suspicion that an individual has violated Jewish law (The collective body of Jewish religious laws derived from the Written and Oral Torah). It may also suggest that someone might misinterpret the act, thus causing that person to violate halacha. It is important here to understand that it is dependent on circumstances which might otherwise be permitted.\n\nIt is far most likely that Marrano is from the Spanish word meaning swine or pig. Given the hatred of the Jews at the time, it imparted the sense of loathing conveyed by the word. It is not clear if secretly practicing Jews also called themselves \"Marranos.\" Later, Jewry used the term as a badge of honor and not of shame and used it to refer to their community.\n\nIn an effort to distinguish Christian Jews from native Iberian Christians the term \"New Christians\" was also applied. Some of these Conversos had sincerely embraced the Church and intermarried with so-called Old Christians becoming the New Christians. Originally, the term New Christian carried no intrinsic pejorative connotation. However, later with the increasing power of the Catholic Inquisition came the concept of \"limpieza de sangre,\" or cleansing the blood. It referred to those who were considered pure \"Old Christians\", without being tainted by the blood of Jewish or Muslim ancestors. This was meant as a clear signal to all who heard it, that those who were labeled by it were of Jewish background. Here another important point must be made. Those New Christians who secretly observed Jewish practices after their conversion to whatever degree possible were not regarded as voluntary apostates by the non-converted Jewish community.\n\nThese Marranos or Conversos were also called Crypto-Jews if they were deemed Judaizers, those who claim the necessity of continued obedience to the Law of Moses found in the first five books of the Christian Old Testament. That is to say, a smaller number continued secretly in their old Jewish beliefs, under cover of Catholicism.\n\nSome of these Marranos chose to remain invisible as Secret Jews in many European countries. Over the centuries they evolved their own form of Judaism, built from the remnants left to them after generations of isolation from the rest of the Jewish world. They kept only a few words of Hebrew, notably \"Adonai\" (Hebrew \"Lord\", i.e., G-d) which was sometimes used as a password. And they may have celebrated only two holidays, Passover and Yom Kippur. Jewish customs that could lead to trouble with the Inquisition, such as circumcision (A death sentence at various times in Spain's history) and the prohibition against eating pork (Inquisitors forced people to eat pork to prove they were not Jewish), were given up. Some families were left with only a few customs, the echoes of Jewish ancestors long since forgotten.\n\nNear the end of World War I, some descendants of these Jewish remnants were discovered in isolated villages in Portugal. But historians have traditionally considered their survival an exception. Outside Portugal the religious practice of Crypto-Jews decayed within a few generations to fragments of prayers and other elements of ancient observance (A refusal to eat pork). According to historians the phenomenon had for the most part died out by the end of the 1700s C.E.\n\nGiven the aforementioned conditions under which Sephardim chose to live, the outcomes had their effects. One of which is the problem with how a persons Jewish background and status can impact his/her being acceptance as a Jew. This is not a simple question without problems for all involved. Therefore, in the end it must be examined in the context of the basic laws of Israel. Being Jewish has many implications to the faithful.\n\nOthers in the Sephardic Community prefer the term \"Anusim,\" (sometimes without differentiation of singular and plural, e.g.) to the terms Conversos, Marranos, or Secret Jews. Anusim is the typical Hebrew name for Marranos and has been favored in other communities and by some scholars.\n\nFor the many Sephardim as ethnic Jews, there are some who continued practicing some aspects of Judaism in secret for many generations and some who did not. The underlying question for those in authority over observant Jews is whether the Sephardim as Anusim became New Christians by coercion out of fear or embraced Christianity willingly out of choice. At issue is whether they did so by force or by choice. In a strict sense, if by choice, the result may be the practice of a different religion other than Judaism. The circumstances related to an individuals community life, is considered as being of great importance.\n\nOne example is being unaware of Jewish parents could or possibly should affect a persons status as being Jewish or non-Jewish. In the area of Diaspora identity, the identity of Jews among themselves and by non-Jews throughout the Jewish Diaspora is a consideration. There is also the claim to Israeli citizenship and its implications, which must be considered.\n\nThe following statement was made by the much revered and famous Maimonides (Rambam) 1135 C.E.-1204 C.E., a 12th Century C.E. Jewish sage, that although one should allow oneself to be put to death rather than abandon one's faith in times of persecution, \"nevertheless, if he transgressed and did not choose the death of a martyr, even though he has annulled the positive precept of sanctifying the Name and transgressed the injunction not to desecrate the Name, since he transgressed under duress and could not escape, he is exempted from punishment.\"\n\nIt is reported that there have been rulings by rabbis in accordance with the aforementioned. Therefore, New Christians who remained in their countries because of their inability to escape and flee, were considered full Jews but only if they conducted themselves in accordance with the precepts of Judaism, even if only doing so in private. To the extent that this has been established, their shehitah (The slaughtering of mammals and birds for food) could be relied upon, their testimony in law cases accepted, and their wine was considered kosher (Foods that conform to the regulations of Kashrut (Jewish dietary law).\n\nTo the average person the idea of Sephardim, Marranos, and Crypto-Jews may seem odd to comprehend, the splitting of hairs and all of that. I leave these decisions to others with a far greater understanding than I have of Judaism and what the greater community of Observant Jews accept or do not accept as being appropriately Jewish. However, the aforementioned views suggest the strong need for the observant Jewish communities to arrive at some understanding as to what is or is not acceptable for one being considered a Jew. We are now in the 21st Century, such decisions will have a potential impact upon tens of millions of Old World and New World Anusim.\n\nGranted, for some the ideas presented here are too strange to accept. But for me and my journey in life, these things touch the soul. I cant simply walk away from who I am, or what I may have been, or will be. What of the understanding of the Jewish heritage of my children? To be cheated out of ones birthright (Observant Jew) is an unpleasant thing. We Hispanos of the American Southwest who have found ourselves to be Sephardim are now grappling with these ideas, concepts, and issues. It is no easy matter to understand or accept a change to ones historic identity and at the same time accept the loss of a sacred faith, religion, and culture. For me, the struggle continues .\n\nIt must be remembered that before the late 19th Century C.E. the Jews in the New Worlds Spanish America (South, Central, and North America) were overwhelmingly Sephardim. Yet today, it is estimated that Sephardic Jews make up only a small percentage of the Jewish population worldwide. For the Sephardim of the Americas the specifics of Jewish demography and the study of its statistics are important, as the results are large and complex. It is abundantly clear that there exists credible evidence that Spanish Jews can trace their roots to Iberia. Almost all other Jews in North America are Ashkenazim and the Ashkenazic Jews trace their ancestry to Northern and Eastern Europe, as do most European Americans. Therefore, simple distinctions between the two groups become major differences.\n\nAs for my family, the history of New Mexico Crypto-Judaism began in the Sixteenth Century C.E. Many New Christians or their immediate descendants arrived in the northernmost parts of New Spain seeking their fortune along the frontier. They selected the lands along the Rio Grande, its tributary creeks, and upland villages. The new arrivals settled the areas from El Paso northward to what is today New Mexico and southern Colorado. It is understandable that many chose these very remote areas because they feared becoming targets of the Inquisition as accused Judaizers or simply because they were New Christians. It is also logical that others came as part of colonial settlement expeditions that released them from the exclusionary requirements which limited their success unlike those of pure Old-Christian bloodlines.\n\nThe New Christian community or Crypto-Jews probably reached its zenith in the 17th Century C.E. It is suggested that there were twenty thousand Europeans in 17th Century (After 1821) Mexico including parts that are now within the United States. Approximately one tenth of them were possibly New Christians.\n\nOne prominent example of New Christians arriving in the region and members of families known to have Judaized, were the sons of Luis de Carvajal. It would appear that these families married primarily among themselves, maintaining their identity to the present day.\n\nIn all fairness, given the religious intolerance and persecution of the day, it is probable that the overwhelming majority of Conversos were not Crypto-Jews. In addition, community life and the proximity to other Observant Jews left these unable or unwilling to pass along meaningful components of an explicitly Jewish way of life. Yet, some suggest that there were some fifteen hundred families in New Mexico who were part of this Crypto-Jewish tradition.\n\nTo be sure, some of these families would have lost all knowledge of their Jewish heritage, culture, traditions, and practices over the many hundreds of years. However, today many Sephardic descendants are now aware of the history of Judaism in Spain and the presence of many Conversos in the early Spanish settlement of the region. Many contemporary New Mexico Hispanos have demonstrated that their ancestors include individuals who were prosecuted by the Inquisition for loyalty to the Law of Moses. Other individuals are convinced that their families, as Jews, have kept some traditions alive.\n\nHistory attests that 17th Century C.E. New Mexicans came to the attention of the Holy Office of the Inquisition. In the late 1600s C.E., the governor of New Mexico and his wife were accused of practicing Judaism; soon thereafter the same charge was leveled against a soldier and bureaucrat named Francisco Gómez Robledo (Robledo is one of my family lines), who was also said to have a tail, this supposedly the mark of a Jew. All were examined by the Holy Office. All were acquitted. By the time the Inquisition was abolished in Mexico, 1812 C.E.-1820 C.E., it had put to death approximately one hundred accused Crypto-Jews and many suspected Judaizers languished behind bars. Thank G-d, by this time the odious, dreaded Catholic Holy Office was finally ended.\n\nCrypto-Jews or Secret Jews seems to be the most well-known term for the area of the Southwest. The Anusim appear to have links to villages from central New Mexico to southern Colorado. Many discussions of these links include areas along both banks of the Rio Grande south into Texas. From these regions come interesting remembrances of what appear to be Jewish practices among Hispanos. Unfortunately, many are dismissed. The stories underscore the probability which suggests that Crypto-Jews had fled north from Colonial Mexico in the 17th Century C.E. to escape the Inquisition. The question is whether it is possible that almost 400 years later; Jews in New Mexico's isolated Hispano villages secretly managed the feat of preserving their forefathers' faith?\n\nIn the 1980s C.E., a rather bright, intelligent man named Stanley Hordes became New Mexico's state historian. Hordes received a Fulbright-Hays fellowship to examine the Inquisition in Mexico. Pouring over archives there and in Spain, he found the surnames of accused Crypto-Jewish families and the alleged details of their Mosaic rites. The Religion of the Crypto-Jews provides a list of Crypto-Judaic customs, based on Inquisition records. His methodical work presented logical finding regarding Sephardic Jewish customs and practices. What makes these findings difficult to convey is the fact that at the time of his research and analysis historians and other interested parties knew little of the life of the Sephardim of the New World or Iberia.\n\nThroughout the Diaspora, Sephardic Jews have eaten food made with olive oil, chickpeas, and other Mediterranean ingredients. Ashkenazic foods such as bagels, borscht kugel, and lox are not traditionally part of their diet. Yiddish, with its German and Slavic components, has nothing to do with Sephardic Ladino, which mixes Hebrew with medieval Spanish, Turkish, and Moroccan. Here we have two distinctly different Jewish communities with their own cultures, foods, histories, languages, and religious practices. Further, it has been by and large Ashkenazi researchers attempting to understand the Sephardim and their Conversos. Not an easy mix.\n\nNew Mexico Hispanos have loved the land for several hundred years. They remember the small villages of the past. That imagery of long ago is evoked by the paintings and coffee table books. These Hispano New Mexicans regularly review old family records at the Santa Fe, New Mexico archives. Baptismal, burial, and marriage documents provide centuries of information for them. There is other paperwork held by Church and government officials throughout the area such as judicial records and documents pertaining to the Inquisition. Hordes used all of these in his Sephardic determinations. He approached his work without prejudice or religiosity, but as a scholar and researcher attempting to unfold Jewish history and make some sense of its Sephardic people in the New World.\n\nFurther, he examined their customs included bathing on Fridays and afterward donning clean clothes; ritually disposing of the blood drained from slaughtered fowl; fasting on Yom Kippur; eating tortillas (which are unleavened) during Passover; burning hair and nail clippings; circumcising sons (or merely nicking the penile shaft).\n\nThere were other areas of possible New Christian influences explored by various people. An elderly couple, Emilio and Trudi Coca (One of my family lines), living in New Mexico visited Latino graveyards where they found and photographed headstones inscribed with surprising first names. An example is Adonay (Adonai is the Hebrew word for \"Lord\"). These cemeteries contained both headstones with crosses and six-pointed stars similar to the Star of David.\n\nThere was also the use the local term \"Manito,\" a \"shortened diminutive of Hermano,\" to refer \"to New Mexico's Indo-Hispanos and Indo-Hispanas whose historical threads are anchored in the Colonial period. However, the term also refers to \"Crypto-Jews\" among the Manitos. For me, it is interesting that my mother referred to our family many times as being Manitos. Her recollection of the term was one of great fondness and inclusion.\n\nGiven names may be a more reliable support for a Crypto-Jewish background. Names such as Sara, Raquel, Rosa, and Betsab, for women and Aron, Abran, Adan, Efren, Eliso, Jacobo, and others for men meet that level of support. \"Adonay\" is sometimes used as a given name, paralleling the use of \"Jesus\" as a popular given name among Hispanos. This would be anathema to traditional Jews, of course. Most of these personal and family names are well attested outside the New Mexico group. However, the presence of \"Adonay\" and of Old Testament names to the exclusion of Gospel names would be striking in any Hispano context. It is also easier to trace than many of the practices, possibly allowing some historical perspective. But conversely it is also easily open to alternative explanations. As in the case of the personal names, some note an emphasis on the Hebrew Bible stories to the exclusion of New Testament stories.\n\nThere was also the sense that many New Christians felt themselves to be different from the mass of Catholic Hispanos and was included within study finding. Some individuals reported a parent advising them that they were not really Christians. Others stated that they never attended church. There were those who claimed they were not baptized or that their families waited as long as possible before having them baptized. Also, some told of never taking communion or not being confirmed. It was reported by some that they were advised not to pray to Jesus or worship Saints or the trinity, instead, they were told to concentrate only on G-d.\n\nSabbath observances are the most common and striking religious observance reported by participants. The lighting candles on Friday night are often an action that is not understood to be a \"Jewish\" practice, as candles must be lit on Friday evening before sunset to usher in the Jewish Sabbath. Lighting Shabbat candles is a rabbinically mandated law. Typical reports noted that women lit candles in bowls in an interior part of the house, or that draperies were drawn. Other Saturday-Sabbath reports note that the men did not go to church on Sunday, but gathered in a building or in the fields on Saturday. Some reported that the men worked on Sunday but not on Saturday.\n\nThen there were the food practices. The avoidance of pork was frequently mentioned. The acts of slaughtering animals after checking a knife for sharpness before slitting its neck, and allowing the carcass to hang upside down until all the blood drained out was disclosed. Some recall avoiding meat with milk, not eating eggs with blood-spots, soaking, salting and soaking the meat, and covering the blood of slaughtered animals with dirt. Use of Kosher wine was also reported.\n\nPlaying a gambling game with a top, sometimes called pon y saca \"Put in and take out\" often cited as a Hanukkah-like practice, as is lighting one more candle or luminaria bonfire each night, starting over a week before Christmas, so that there are flames at Christmas. The observance of a feast or fast in honor of \"Esther\" is often cited. The baking of pan de semita \"Semitic bread\" is reported at Easter, heavy bread that did not rise.\n\nSome individuals noted that the Spanish in a specific place resembled their villages Spanish more than Castilian, Mexican or any of the Latin American dialects. Indeed, some refer to the distinctive dialect of the New Mexico villages as \"Ladino. On a personal note, I was once in Beverly Hills listening to a movie star explaining her career. Behind me sat an elegant, elderly couple. They were speaking a form of Spanish which sounded vaguely familiar and similar to that spoken by my mother and grandmothers during their conversations in Spanish, when I was young. I asked if they were from Spain and what dialect of Spanish they were speaking. They smiled and explained that they were Sephardic Jews and speaking Ladino. I left the conversation there.\n\nOthers have described traditions that include gathering nail clippings, sweeping to the center of a room, next day burial, mourning for a year, bathing after contact with the dead, covering the mirrors in a house of mourning, leaving pebbles on graves, and circumcision.\n\nThere were some earlier indications of awareness of these traditions, to be sure. Some Rabbis reported inquiries. Items from the 1880's and just prior to 1920 C.E. there seems to have been an awareness of Jewish heritage. Fray Angelico Chavez of New Mexico, a Hispano Scholar, was certainly aware of the New Christian heritage of many families descended from Spanish-period colonials, and perhaps reflected on the continuing meaningfulness of this heritage in comments on the similarity of his New Mexico homeland to ancient Palestine. Although preceded by research on southern Texas \"Chicano Jews\", the first articles specifically relating to New Mexico Crypto-Judaism began to appear in the 1980's C.E. Since 1985 C.E., there seems to be a growing awareness in research and journalism.\n\nWhether one wants to accept that Sephardic non-Observant Jews have existed in the Spanish New World for hundreds of years, that choice is left to the reader. Nor is the use of the terms for converted Sephardim such as Conversos, Marranos, New Christians, Crypto-Jews, Secret Jews, and Anusim of great importance. What is of importance is the fact that there has been an awakening by many in the world of their Jewish ancestry and an interest in becoming acquainted with the legacy of that relationship.\n\nMy progenitors, the de Riberas, were Sephardim. At issue is the reality that they eventually lost their Jewish identity due to conversion. As Spanish Jews living in 15th Century C.E. Spain, they were subject to actions taken by the Crown and Church in which many Spanish Jews converted (Conversos in Spanish) to Roman Catholicism voluntarily or by forced. At this juncture it is worth noting that many Sephardim chose not to abandon their Judaism. Some fled to North Africa, Italy, and Navarre (Then a kingdom on the border between Spain and France). Many more went to Portugal, though Portugal itself would soon demand conversion and thousands of Jews there would also undergo baptism. Unlike these, the de Riberas chose conversion.\n\nSECTION V. The Inquisition\n\nTo understand the Jew, one must understand the world which surrounded, engulfed, and almost overcame them. Over its history, humanity has witnessed countless mass murders in various nations and cultures. The reasons have been as trivial as physical appearance or as complex as competing religious beliefs and political persuasion. Since the beginning of time, aggressive majorities have struck out against defenseless minorities. The 20th Century C.E. witnessed Nazis in Germany, Imperialist Japan, the Communists of Soviet Union and China, the Tutsis in Africa, and others killing many needlessly. The Spanish Inquisition was a precursor to these and a blot on Spanish history. It remains a very tragic part of that nations past. Its lessons are there to learn from and to teach the generations to come so that evil of this kind will never happen again. These acts of governmental and religious barbarism and persecution were to have a critical impact upon Spain and those she brutalized. Since its time, the Inquisition has influenced many of the peoples of the world. Im sure the Nazis found the Inquisition a fine teacher. It is hoped that this lesson of governmental and religious intolerance and the suffering it inflicted will never be forgotten or repeated.\n\nOne cannot escape the fact that the cruel actions of the Inquisition were requested by the Spanish Crown and carried out in concert with the Roman Catholic Church. It was directed at many peoples, Muslims, Jews, and numerous others. However, the majority of Catholic Christians were spared during this period. As the facts reveal, the Church was unbending in its treatment of the Sephardic Jews. It sanctioned the various forms of cruelty and punishment used on these helpless people. The blatant lies told by false accusers were accepted as truth.\n\nOne must remember that anti-Semitism existed in Spain for many reasons. Over the centuries the Spanish Jews had become very wealthy and prominent in their communities, causing envy. It has been speculated that the chief cause of the Inquisition was due to this envy. Earlier, Moorish rulers in Spain had extended the hand of friendship to them but not to Catholic Spaniards. This caused the average Spaniard and clergy to have a great deal of suspicion toward the Jews. The practice known as Jewish usury was also unpopular with the Christians.\n\nThe Spanish Jew, was Iberian and yet, not quite so. He/she lived life wrapped in the religious cocoon of Judaism. It formed the Jewish world view and outward demonstration of that interpretation. Jewish laws, foods, language, and culture permeated the every action of the Jewish community, setting it apart from the average Iberian and later Spaniard. It was as if the Jews had painted a large, visible target on themselves making all aware that they were Jewish first and Spaniard second. It was easy for Jew haters to find them, denounce them, heap indignities upon them, and kill them.\n\nAs indignities grew, the Jews were forbidden to associate freely with Christians, expanding the chasm of misunderstanding and misinterpretation even larger. Later, their residences were restricted to certain limited quarters. This further alienated the Jewish community geographically, making their world one of enforced separation due to misconceived evil practices on the part of the Jews, from which Catholics must be saved. Also, they were subject to irksome, sumptuary regulations (Laws designed to restrict excessive personal expenditures in the interest of preventing extravagance and luxury.), such as, being debarred from all display in dress, forbidden to carry valuable ornaments or wear expensive clothes. This was to be the Jewish penance for having worked hard, playing by the rules of the nobility, and having earned enough money to live well and prosper. The final outcropping of this punishment was that the Jews were to be held up to scorn. They were compelled to appear in a distinctive, unbecoming garb, the badge or emblem of their social inferiority. What then is the purpose of wealth if one is not allowed to enjoy its fruits?\n\nThe Jews were also interdicted from following certain professions and callings. They could not study or practice medicine, apothecaries, nursing, or be vintner, grocer or tavern keeper. Jews were forbidden to act as stewards to the nobility or as farmers. Collection of public revenues was forbidden them. It is no coincidence that Jews were cut-off from all ability to make a living or to excel in what they knew best. The system was now rigged against them. The only thing left to them was a difficult, hard life of public ridicule and punishment with the only out being conversion to Catholicism. The intended curtailments were meant to ensure religious conformity, which meant Catholicism.\n\nThe inquisition was organized so that a high council of five apostolistic inquisitors assisted the Grand Inquisitor. This served as the Chief Inquisitorial court in the land. There were nineteen lesser courts that operated in Spain and three others that worked in the Spanish colonies. A council of administration, La Suprema, was added later. This body had jurisdiction over all measures concerning the Christian faith. The council, similar to the high court, was run by the Inquisitor General. He had direct access to the sovereigns and exercised absolute and unlimited power over the whole population. No rank of nobility escaped his jurisdiction. What this meant was that the nobility, should it be so inclined to show pity upon a Jewish friend, was itself to become the target of the Church and Crown. By February of 1482 C.E., seven additional inquisitors were commissioned by the Pope.\n\nBy that year, many indignities had already been inflicted upon Jews and the others. One of the Spanish Inquisitions leaders, Torquemada, was rigid and unbending and understood no compromise. This psychological profile made him an effective administrator of his duties. His rigidity served him well in his passionless pursuit of those who he believed would destroy the Church. The human carnage of his inquisition is a testament to Torquemadas efficiency. There was no compromising with Old Christian or New Christian nobles regarding political considerations associated with a favored New Christian noble or valued Observant Jewish merchant.\n\nBetween 1484 C.E. and 1498 C.E., Torquemada set down the basic procedures of the Inquisition in a series of Instrucciones. These instructions provided the inquisitors with a structured, organized approach to the work of the saving the faith. The Instructions were amended in 1488 C.E. to say that the inquisitors could confine a man to his home or to another institution such as a convent or hospital. The fortunate result was that many prisoners served sentences very comfortably, paying for the privilege, no doubt. One can only guess why such a kindness was allowed. By the year 1492 C.E., the Grand Inquisitor actively supported the expulsion of the hated, openly practicing Jews and Marranos (Converted Jews) from a newly united Spain. Thomas de Torquemada would die before the Inquisitions end. But after him, several other Inquisitor Generals would force the Inquisition farther along the road of anti-Semitism, increasing the bitterness of the Inquisition to prove their loyalty to Christianity and to Spain.\n\nThe Inquisition had been first accepted as an agent of public protection. But it quickly became a public menace. Allowing anybody, rich or poor, criminal or exile, to accuse anyone they thought was a heretic created a confused and fearful population. Informers were encouraged to accuse those they suspected, but the accused were never confronted by their accusers, and the convicted were not allowed to appeal to the Pope. In this circumstance nobility, political power, fame, wealth, position, closeness to the upper clergy or the Pope himself, were of no value to those attempting to right the wrongs of the Church and its Inquisition. With all avenues for outside influence upon the Church for mitigation closed off, those accused were left to the loving kindness of the Christian apparatus of the Church and its adherents on earth.\n\nThere were many different ways of proving a heretic. Some were sufficiently broad and almost anyone could be guilty of them. Others were directed toward a specific sector of the population. Presumptive proofs of guilt were as clearly defined as they were commonplace. It was enough that a suspect wore his best suit on the Jewish Sabbath. If the accused ate with Jews, he/she was obviously guilty. If he/she was said to have washed a corpse in warm water, his/her end was assured. If the accused named his children with Hebrew names, he was surely guilty. Habits sustained by countless converts, sincere or not, were their undoing.\n\nFor Moors, bathing was presumed to be prima facie evidence of apostasy. The phrase \"The accused was known to take baths is common in the records of the Inquisition. If ones ancestors had Jewish blood, that person could be taken as a heretic. To avoid the rigors of the Inquisition and social ostracism, a person had to prove that not only was he/she a faithful Catholic, but that he was not a convert, and that his ancestors had all been Catholic. This process was known as \"The cleanliness of one's blood.\" The cleanliness of ones' blood gave way for Lope de Vega's quote: \"I am a man, although of humble breed, clean of blood and never stained by Hebrew or Moorish.\" Thus, a Spaniard of questionable blood (Converso) was forever suspect and to be carefully watched for any possible return to the error in his/her ways, Judaism.\n\nOne perplexing problem for the Inquisition was that many noble families of Spain had intermarried with Jews. Therefore, these were more suspect by the Inquisition than the common people. It is believed that King Ferdinand was of Jewish blood from his mother's side and that Torquemada had descended from Jews who had converted. Both were Conversos, but only two of many.\n\nHere, I provide an excellent example of a Sephardic Jewish family of Conversos, the Mendoza. They were of high position, powerful, and with a well-documented history. The Mendozas wielded considerable power, especially from the 14th to the 17th centuries C.E. in Castille. Members of the family were of a line of Spanish nobles originating in the province of Álava in the Basque country from the town of Mendoza. The Tower of Mendoza in Álava is located in that mountainous region of Álava which is bounded by the kingdoms of Castille, Aragón, and Navarre. Before the 13th and 14th centuries C.E. the area was loosely controlled by Navarre, and retained its own distinctive customs and traditions.\n\nThe purpose of this information is to show the degree of probable Converso intermarrying that these families would have exercised.\n\nThe town of Mendoza and the province of Álava itself was also a battlefield, where the noble families and rival clans of the area such as the Ayala, Orozco, and Velasco clashed. But once the region joined Castille inter-clan warfare would end, as their interests were then on gaining position and privilege within Castille. This family is an excellent example of Spanish Jews marrying into elite Spanish gentile families and then intermarrying with Converso families throughout generations.\n\nThey can be traced back to the House of Haro, another powerful clan of the Basque country. The House of Haro was the most powerful family of Castille during the Middle Age and strongly supported the expansionist policies of Alfonso VI of Castille. Alfonso VI (Before June, 1040 C.E.-June 29/July 1, 1109 C.E.), nicknamed the Brave or the Valiant. He was King of León from 1065 C.E., King of Castille, and de facto King of Galicia from 1072 C.E.\n\nAs a reward, Íñigo (The origin of Íñigo is Enneco, a pre-Roman native root) López (Floruit 10401076 C.E. and died by 1079 C.E.?) was made the first Lord of Biscay by King García Sánchez III, of Navarre (November 1016 C.E.-September 1, 1054 C.E.). Íñigo's government of Biscay began between 1040 C.E. and 1043 C.E.? The exact date is not known and this was not a hereditary right. At some point in time, he received or possibly inherited the rank of count (comes in Latin) and the style \"by the grace of God\" (gratia Dei). In 1051 C.E., when García Sánchez granted fueros to Biscay, he officially associated Íñigo with him in the decree, as the head of the local aristocracy (omnes milites), recognizing the rights and privileges of the monasteries. Íñigo is further associated with monastic renovation by his making or confirming the donations of the churches (monasteria) of San Juan de Gaztelugatxe, Santa María de Mundaca, and Bermeo to San Juan de la Peña, and of Axpe de Busturia and San Martín de Yurreta to San Millán de la Cogolla.\n\nWhile Íñigos origins are obscure, the name Haro is known to be a Jewish surname meaning \"mountaineer.\" It is possible that he may have been a son of Lope Velázquez de Ayala, a lord in Álava, Cantabria and nearby parts of Biscay. He married Toda Ortiz (Fortúnez), probably a daughter of Fortún Sánchez, the godfather of García Sánchez.\n\nHis father-in-law and García Sánchez both died in the Battle of Atapuerca in 1054 C.E. and Íñigo may have succeeded the former as tenente (lord \"holding\" the government on behalf of the king) in Nájera. Documents place his rule in Nájera between 1063 C.E. and 1075 C.E., often through a vicar. Besides Biscay and Nájera, Íñigo also ruled Durango.\n\nIn 1076 C.E., after the assassination of Sancho Garcés IV and the division of Navarre by the armies of his cousins, Sancho I of Aragón and Alfonso VI of León and Castille, Íñigo accepted the overlordship of the Leónese-Castillian monarch. In the surviving text of the fuero given to Nájera that year Íñigo's eldest son, Lope, appears swearing fealty to Alfonso, but he is not recorded in documents as count in Biscay until 1079 C.E. These dates being the termini ad et post quem of his death (\"limit after which\"). He is last recorded in a donation he made to San Millán on behalf of his late wife. In the donation he names as their children, beside Lope: García, Galindo, Mencía, and Sancho, who died young.\n\nÍñigo's grandson, Diego López II de Haro, called the Good or the Bad (b. 1162 C.E.-October 16, 1214 C.E.) was the son of Lope Diaz I de Haro, count of Nájera (b. 1126 C.E.-1170 C.E.) and of countess Aldonza. He was a first rank magnate in the kingdom of Castille under King Alfonso VIII (1158 C.E.-1214 C.E.). Diego played a decisive role in the rise of the Haro dynasty, as well as in the development of the Haro nobiliary identity. The Haros were to dominate the Castilian political society during the entire 13th Century C.E.\n\nIn the early 1500's C.E., the Haro family married paternally into the House of Sotomayor. Ferrando or Ferran De Saavedra is recognized as the founder of the House of Sotomayor, recorded in the year 698 C.E. Ferrando De Saavedra built the castle of Eris, in the Parish of Saavedra. Saavedra is a surname of Galician origin with strong Jewish roots, despite coming from the Gothic word Saa, it shows its Semitic roots which tend to be part of names such as Isaack, Abrahaam, etc.\n\nThe title of Conde De Los Patrimoniso De Galacia was held by Ferrando De Saavedra. He married Dona Ildaura Arias, Senora of the House of Arias who was a descendant of the Suevan King Ariamiro and had two sons, Arias Ferrandez de Saavedra and Sorred Ferrandez De Saavedra both were related to Don Pelayo and served as captains of his auxiliaries in the glorious reconquest of Spain. Ferrando died in the Battle of Guadalete fighting against Saracen (A generic term for Muslims widely used in Europe during the later medieval era.) invaders with Don Rodrigo the last of the Western Gothic (Visigoth) Kings on November 11, 711 C.E. The Haros established a branch that would go on to hold dominion over the Marquesado del Carpio established in 1559 C.E. by King Phillip II of Spain.\n\nAccording to the Converso defender, Lope de Barrientos, the Mendoza family were of Jewish descent and came from the same stock as another great aristocratic family, the Ayala. By 1332 C.E., the Mendozas had been in the region for at least a century. During the reign of Alfonso XI (1312-1350 C.E.) the province became part of the Kingdom of Castille. The Mendozas participated in Castillian politics thereafter as advisers, administrators, and clerics. With that annexation and by virtue of the Mendoza familys status as knights and free men, they became Castillian nobility and hidalgos. The highest nobility became direct vassals of the king. All members of the noble class were knights, administrators, or lawyers, and served in the administration of the realm. The larger families had the responsibility of forming and maintaining a local army that could be made available if called upon by the king.\n\nThe term hidalgo appeared in the 12th Century C.E. as fidalgus or Castillian hidalgo. It was most probably a contraction of hijo de algo, son of something. It was applied to all nobles, but more commonly to the lesser nobility as distinct from the magnates. This would have included the ricos hombres, vassals of the king or count. These magnates, called ricos hombres (i.e., rich or powerful men) in the west and barones in Catalonia, functioned as his chief counselors. They provided the bulk of royal military forces. There were nobles of the second rank, known variously as infanzones, caballeros or cavallers. Generally speaking these were vassals of the magnates.\n\nThis category would also have included the Castillian commoner knights or caballeros villanos. Caballeros Villanos were higher tier troops associated with the Castillian rural troop tree. They were mounted soldiers usually equipped with spears, small one-handed weapons, heater or kite shields, and padded leather and/or mail armor. These were the highest tier unit in the cavalry branch of their troop tree. To be sure they were no match to higher tier noble knights. However, they provided a competent medium cavalry. These hidalgos enjoyed some privileges but were dependent on rents or offices.\n\nBy the 15th Century C.E., they would have been thought to be of Old Christian descent, thus distinguished from Muslims and Conversos. As it relates to the Mendoza family this was clearly not the case. They were of the Exilarchs, of the Davidic descent of the Royal Houses of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha and Davidic Royal Line of Judah. These had formed the rulership of Judah from Zerubbabels time.\n\nNote: The Exilarchs were of the Davidic Royal Line of Judah and formed the rulers of Judah from Zorobabel. The lineage was from the biblical Zorobabel or Zerubbabel through the Exilarchs, down to the House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha.\n\nExilarch: Title given to the head of the Babylonian Jews, who, from the time of the Babylonian exile, were designated by the term \"golah\" (see Jer. xxviii. 6, xxix. 1; Ezek. passim) or \"galut\" (Jer. xxix. 22). The chief of the golah or prince of the exiles held a position of honor which, recognized by the state, carried with it certain definite prerogatives, and was hereditary in a family that traced its descent from the royal Davidic house. The origin of this dignity is not known. The first historical documents referring to it date from the time when Babylon was part of the Parthian empire, and it was preserved uninterruptedly during the rule of the Sassanids, as well as for several centuries under the Arabs.\n\nA chronicle of about the year 800the Seder 'Olam Zuṭafills up the gaps in the early history of the Exilarch by constructing an account according to which the first Exilarch was no less a person than Jehoiachin, the last king but one of the house of David, whom the Exilarchs regarded as their ancestor.\n\nThe first Mendoza to occupy a position of some importance in Castille was Gonzálo Yáñez de Mendoza. He fought in the Battle of Río Salado in 1340 C.E. and the siege of Algeciras in 1344 C.E., during the Reconquista against the Islamic kingdoms of Spain. He also served as chief huntsman to King Alfonso XI. Gonzálo settled in Guadalajara where he ruled after marrying the sister of Íñigo López de Orozco. Orozco was originally from Álava. He had received the post of mayor as a reward for his military services to the king. This pattern was replicated in the family several times. As the Mendozas served their king in war, they earned prestigious positions within the kingdom. By virtue of these positions, they married into wealth and power.\n\nThe son of Gonzálo, Pedro González de Mendoza (1340 C.E.-1385 C.E.) participated in the Castillian Civil War siding with his stepbrother, Henry II over Pedro the Cruel. The fortunes of his family were greatly aided by these actions as Henry's line eventually won out. Edward the Black Prince took Pedro prisoner in the Battle of Najera. Henry was eventually released after Edward left Pedro's side to return to England.\n\nPedro is also remembered as a hero in the Battle of Aljubarrota, another crushing Castillian defeat. When King John I's horse died, Pedro provided the king his horse so that he could flee. With no way to escape, Pedro was killed in the battle. His services were remembered and the Mendoza family continued to grow in power and wealth.\n\nDiego Hurtado de Mendoza (1367 C.E.-1404 C.E.) the tenth head of the House of Mendoza was appointed the Admiral of Castille by King Henry III. He fought against the Portuguese fleet for possession of the Strait of Gibraltar as commander of the fleet. Interestingly, of the three engagements he commanded, his forces lost them all. He was the son of Pedro González de Mendoza I and Aldonza López de Ayala. Diego inherited the wealth of his father Pedro. He first married King Henry IIs illegitimate daughter María, who died during giving birth to their daughter, Aldonza de Mendoza. She later became the Countess of Arjona.\n\nLater, he married León or Lasso de la Vega (1394 C.E.) an exceptionally powerful and well-connected widow and head of house of the prestigious House of Lasso de la Vega a descendant of the rich and powerful counts of La Vega.\n\nNote: The following information is taken from Sephardim.Com for the purpose of educating the reader about Spanish names and how they relate to Sephardic origins.

In reward for this and other expressions of loyalty, King Henry made multiple donations and grants to him, and gave Diego rule over the town of Tendilla in 1395. When he died, Diego was considered among the richest men in Castille.\n\nJuana de Mendoza married Alonso Enríquez (1354-1429) who was Lord of Medina de Rioseco and Admiral of Castille.

Alonso ended up being the most famous admiral in the family, winning many sea battles.\n\nIn 1407, he defeated the combined fleet of Tunis (Hafsid), Granada (Nasrid) and Tlemcen (Capital city of the Zianid kingdom).

He was deeply involved in the court politics and social life.\n\nThe poet and biographer Fernán Pérez de Guzmán, a contemporary of Alonso's, described him as medium sized, chubby, red-haired, discrete, and not a talker.
