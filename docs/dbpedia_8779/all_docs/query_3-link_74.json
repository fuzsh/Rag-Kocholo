        "text": "THE LIBRARY OF IBERIAN RESOURCES ONLINE <strong>The</strong> Spanish and Portuguese Reconquest, 1095-1492 Charles Julian Bishko From A History <strong>of</strong> the Crusades Vol. 3: <strong>The</strong> Fourteenth and Fifteenth Centuries Ed. Harry W. Hazard Madison: <strong>The</strong> University <strong>of</strong> Wisconsin Press, 1975 Â©1975 <strong>The</strong> Regents <strong>of</strong> the University <strong>of</strong> Wisconsin System Reproduced with permission from the University <strong>of</strong> Wisconsin Press; use is limited to personal and educational, non-commercial purposes. [396] When pope Urban II in 1095 proclaimed the crusade for the recovery <strong>of</strong> the Holy Land, the struggle against Islam in the <strong>Iberian</strong> peninsula was already almost four centuries old, and yet another four would pass before, in the year <strong>of</strong> the discovery <strong>of</strong> America, the \"Catholic Kings\" at Granada could raise the cross and the banner <strong>of</strong> Castile over the highest tower <strong>of</strong> the Alhambra, ending forever an Islamic dominion that dated from the Visigothic catastrophe <strong>of</strong> 711-714. (1) In this eight-hundred-year chronicle <strong>of</strong> Christian-Moslem confrontation and cultural interpenetration, the Council <strong>of</strong> Clermont (which several Spanish bishops attended) represents no merely fortuitous midpoint, for the last years <strong>of</strong> the eleventh century witnessed a pr<strong>of</strong>ound transformation in the nature, tempo, and course <strong>of</strong> the [397] Spanish and Portuguese reconquest brought about by the confluence <strong>of</strong> three great movements <strong>of</strong> historical change. <strong>The</strong> first <strong>of</strong> these was the accelerating internal growth and expansive thrust <strong>of</strong> the <strong>Iberian</strong> Christian peoples, whose principal foci were in 1095 temporarily aligned as the united kingdoms <strong>of</strong> Leon and Castile, with the former including a county <strong>of</strong> Portugal on the verge [398] <strong>of</strong> moving towards national autonomy; the similarly linked monarchies <strong>of</strong> Aragon and Navarre; and the foremost Catalan counties <strong>of</strong> Barcelona and Urgel. <strong>The</strong> Leonese-Castilian sovereigns Ferdinand I (1035/1038-1065) and Alfonso VI (1065/1072-1109) had attempted to construct a pan-<strong>Iberian</strong> federation <strong>of</strong> both Christian and Moslem states based upon the ancient doctrine that the rulers <strong>of</strong> Leon, as authentic heirs <strong>of</strong> the Visigothic kings, were both reges and imperatores Hispaniae (or Hispaniarum), entitled to exercise an imperial hegemony over all other peninsular princes. (2) But this thesis met with considerable opposition from the other Christian states, so that in the year <strong>of</strong> Clermont it was plain that Christian unity would remain a precarious ideal and that the reconquest, conceptually the liberation <strong>of</strong> the peninsula from Islam but in practice much more a contest for immediate secular prizes, would be fought by independent, <strong>of</strong>ten hostile, powers. Nevertheless, despite such disunity, Christian Iberia's increasing population and resources, maturing political, social, and economic institutions, tightening religious, cultural, and commercial ties with trans-Pyrenean Europe, and growing confidence that the reconquest was no longer a mere struggle for survival -- all created strong pressures to gain lands and spoils, power, prestige, and satisfaction <strong>of</strong> religious ideals, across the open frontier to the south."
