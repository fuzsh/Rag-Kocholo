The Arabs on the Iberian Peninsula from 711-1492 CE saw: 1. The initial conquest by Muslim armies which established independent emirates and caliphates that flourished for several centuries, reaching a golden age under the Caliphate of CÃ³rdoba. 2. The fragmentation of al-Andalus into competing Taifa kingdoms from the 11th-13th centuries as Christian kingdoms advanced, until temporary political unifications by the Almoravids and Almohads. 3. The eventual fall of Muslim rule to the Catholic Monarchs with the conquest of Granada in 1492, ending over 700 years of Arab presence on the Iberian Peninsula
