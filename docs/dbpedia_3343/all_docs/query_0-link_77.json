        "text": "In order to help offset the costs of searching for, retrieval and redaction of public records from the Anderson County Office of the Coroner, the following fee schedule applies to FOIA requests and are subject to change:\n\nIncident reports (prior 14 days): $0.25 per page for black & white/$0.35 per page for color\n\nunder §30-4-30(D)(2) – in person requests\n\nHourly staff time: $24 per hour\n\n(If request requires specialized personnel, e.g., IT, legal, executive, etc., hourly rates could increase)\n\nCopies of documents: $0.25 per page for black & white/$0.35 per page for color\n\nCDs or DVDs: $5.00 per disk (Audio, video, photos, etc.)\n\nUSB Drive: $15.00 (up to 2GB) (Large documents, audio, video, photos, etc.)\n\nPostage: Postage and/or shipping may apply and will be in addition to other fees.\n\n​A deposit of 25% of the estimated costs for searching, retrieval, redacting and reproducing records may be required before searching for or making copies of records, this is at the discretion of the Anderson County Office of the Coroner. The full balance must be paid at the time of production of the records.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice Office of Justice Programs (OJP) has approved an application submitted by Anderson County on behalf of the Office of the Anderson County Coroner for an award under the Bureau of Justice Assistance Strengthening the Medical Examiner-Coroner System program. The approved award amount is $101,460, which will be used to seek accreditation from the International Association of Coroners and Medical Examiners (IACME).\n\n“Put simply, death has unavoidable impacts on the living, so it is critical that the community has full confidence that the Office of the Coroner follows established professional standards in an equitable, consistent way” said Anderson County Coroner Greg Shore. “By obtaining and maintaining accreditation from the IACME, we can offer a methodology which assures all interested parties that investigations are conducted without regard to a decedent’s station in life or personal circumstance.”\n\nRecent increases in the work rate of the Coroner’s Office have far outpaced the community’s rate of population growth, and the office has seen a striking increase in the number of accidental death determinations. These conditions further emphasize the need for the most accurate and defensible standards that the office can obtain.\n\n“We oftentimes see cases where a death occurs due to circumstances that indicate potential negligence or responsibility by others” said Deputy Coroner Don McCown. “For families seeking criminal or civil redress in these matters, it is imperative that the Coroner’s actions and findings are able withstand legal scrutiny and challenge. Having IACME accreditation will go a long way towards helping us serve the public in these matters.”\n\nANDERSON COUNTY OFFICE OF THE CORONER—FAST FACTS\n\nThe number of accidental death investigations (not counting automobile fatalities) has increased by 170% in the last five years. The office conducted 54 such investigations in 2018—by 2022 that number increased to 146.\n\nThe number of accidental death investigations in 2019, 2020, and 2021 respectively were 112, 111, and 127.\n\nIn 2018, accidental death investigations accounted for 2.7% of 1,973 total death investigations. By 2022, they accounted for a full six percent of total investigations.\n\nThe caseload at the Coroner’s Office far exceeds Anderson County’s rate of population growth. The County’s population grew by just under five percent from 2018 thru 2022; however, the annual number for total death investigations increased by almost 25 percent.\n\nThe total number of death investigations conducted by the Coroner’s Office is on pace to exceed 2,500 in the 2023 calendar year.\n\nCounty Coroner Greg Shore manages a staff of Eleven persons, which includes a Chief Deputy Coroner, one Medical Examiner (FT), one Medical Examiner (PT) one Forensic Autopsy Specialist, five Deputy Coroners, an Evidence Technician, a Morgue Attendant, and an Administrative Assistant.\n\nAnderson, SC (30, June 2022, 10:00 p.m. EDT) – Greg Shore, Coroner announced tonight that Charlie Boseman, Deputy Coroner for Anderson County was presented the South Carolina Coroners Association Deputy Coroner of the Year Award for 2022 at their annual conference being held in Myrtle Beach, SC.\n\nThe South Carolina Coroners Association represents the Coroners of the forty-six counties in the State. Each year the Association hosts the annual conference and training event for all Coroners, Deputy Coroners, and other medicolegal death investigators. Individuals attending the conference receive training in various aspects of medicolegal death investigation as well as meet the annual state training requirements. In addition, each year an award for the Coroner of the Year, Deputy Coroner of the Year and the Sue Townsend Award are presented to individuals that have demonstrated highest standards in medicolegal death investigation.\n\nGreg Shore, Coroner stated that Charlie Boseman has served as a Deputy Coroner under his office for over 26 years and has been involved in death investigations for over 48 years. Charlie not only serves as a Deputy Coroner, but also a Forensic Autopsy Technician assisting in autopsies.\n\nMr. Shore stated that Charlie has been an inspiration not only to my deputies and staff, but also a number of other coroners, allied health personnel, and law enforcement officers for many years. Mr. Boseman is an invaluable asset to my office as well as the field of death investigation.\n\nGreg Shore stated “I can think of no better way to honor a man that has spent his life speaking for the dead” than to recognize him with this award. Mr. Shore further stated that would like to thank the South Carolina Coroners Association for selecting Charlie Boseman for this distinguish recognition.\n\nHAVE A WILL IN PLACE\n\n*If you do not have any living family members, have a neighbor or trusted friend know where your will is, so that when you die it is easily accessible.\n\nPICK A FUNERAL HOME AND PLAN YOUR FINAL DISPOSITION\n\n*Most funeral homes offer preplanning of burial or cremation.\n\n*You can prepay for services, give them your life insurance information, or begin to make monthly payments so that it is paid for at time of death, once you pay it in full it locks in the price as well.\n\n*You can also sign cremation authorizations, if that is your wish of final disposition, so that your family does not have to do it when you die.\n\n*Once you have made prearrangements, give a copy to or tell a trusted friend or family member so that someone is aware you have preplanned.\n\nLIFE INSURANCE POLICIES\n\n*If you have life insurance policies, be sure to have a trusted family member or friend know where they are or keep a copy for themselves (usually the beneficiary is a good person to keep this information).\n\n*Keep beneficiary information up to date, if one of your current beneficiaries die, be sure to elect a new beneficiary for your policy.\n\nIN THE STATE OF SC COMMON LAW MARRIAGE IS NOT RECOGNIZED WHEN SOMEONE DIES\n\n*When someone dies, our office has to notify the legal next of kin. A common law spouse is not recognized as a legal next of kin.\n\n*We will then begin looking for any living legal spouse, adult children, parents, siblings, and follow the state recognized hierarchy or kinship until we find a legal next of kin.\n\n*Even if someone is separated from their spouse, no matter how long it has been, they are still considered a next of kin until they are legally divorced by the court system.\n\n*If the only person that you have is your common law spouse we suggest you make prearrangements with your funeral home of choice, and sign all paperwork with them prior to death (especially if you are a cremation), as well as list them in your will to be the one who can make funeral arrangements, this will help because they are then legally able to handle your disposition (The will must be very specific in stating this – please reach out to your attorney for the correct wording).\n\nTHE CORONER’S OFFICE DOES NOT ISSUE DEATH CERTIFICATES\n\n*South Carolina DHEC Vital Records will issue death certificates. The next of kin will give the funeral home demographic information, it is then electronically sent to the Coroner/Deputy Coroner/Doctor who will sign, then the funeral home will release it. Your family will need to work with the funeral home on the bests way to get the death certificate once it is completed.\n\nCREMATION IN SOUTH CAROLINA\n\n*South Carolina law states that if you want to be cremated and have not already signed a preneed cremation authorization prior to death, your cremation must be signed off on by your legal next of kin.\n\n*If you are legally married your spouse will be the one needed to sign off, if your spouse has died, you are divorced, or were never married it goes to the next legal next of kin. Below is the hierarchy of kin that is followed:\n\n-spouse\n\n-surviving adult children\n\n-surviving parents\n\n-adult siblings\n\n-adult grandchildren\n\n-grandparents\n\n-person appointed by probate\n\n*The only time that this list is not followed is if the person has a designated agent in their will to handle their disposition.\n\n*This is also the list that our office follows when handling notifications of a person’s death.\n\n*If there is more than one person in the category that is determined to be the legal next of kin there must be a majority of the group to sign. Ex. There are three children, at least two children must sign off on the cremation.\n\nPOWER OF ATTORNEY\n\n*Power of Attorney is a great thing to have when someone is living and is unable to make decisions for themselves or would prefer to have someone make decisions for them but once a person dies so does the legality of the Power of Attorney. After death Power of Attorney is no longer valid.\n\n*As Power of Attorney, if the person is still living, you can sign a preneed cremation authorization for that person, so that when they do die that portion is already taken care of. If this is signed prior to death the next of kin will not need to sign the cremation authorization.\n\n*In order to sign a preneed cremation authorization as a Power of Attorney it must be a Durable Power of Attorney, it cannot be a Healthcare Power of Attorney.\n\n*Our office is not able to use Power of Attorney as legal next of kin, unless they are the actual legal next of kin.\n\nMOST PEOPLE WHO SUFFER A LOSS MAY EXPERIENCE ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING:\n\n• Feel tightness in the throat or heaviness in the chest.\n\n• Have an empty feeling in their stomach, experience a loss or gain of appetite.\n\n• Feel guilty at times and angry at other times.\n\n• Feel restless and look for activity, but find it difficult to concentrate.\n\n• Feel as though the loss is not real, that it did not actually happen.\n\n• Sense the loved one’s presence, find themselves expecting the person to walk in the door at the usual time., hear their voice or see their face.\n\n• Have difficulty sleeping, dream of their loved one frequently or not at all.\n\n• Assume mannerisms or traits of their loved one.\n\n• Experience an intense preoccupation with the life of the deceased.\n\n• Feel guilty or angry over things that happened or did not happen in the relationship with the deceased.\n\n• Feel intense anger at the loved one for leaving them.\n\n• Feel as though they need to care for other people who seem uncomfortable around them by politely not talking about the feelings of loss.\n\n• Need to tell, retell and remember things about the deceased and the experience of death.\n\n• Feel their mood change over the slightest thing.\n\n• Cry at unexpected times\n\nAnderson, SC (26, December 2022, 6:30 p.m. EDT) – Greg Shore, Coroner advised that his office is investigating an incident in which a man reported missing today was found outside his residence deceased. The victim appears to have been outside since 10:00 pm last night.\n\nAnderson County Sheriff’s Office, Anderson County Emergency Management, Anderson County EMS and Medshore EMS responded to the 911 call today reporting the victim missing.
