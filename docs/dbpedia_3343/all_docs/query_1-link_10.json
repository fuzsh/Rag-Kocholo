        "text": "As President of NAI Ohio Equities, Michael oversees both the operations and strategic direction of the firm. He is focused not only on improving financial performance and attracting and retaining top talent, but also on actively growing the client roster and serving their institutional clients, such as The Ohio State University and the Columbus Metropolitan Library.\n\nMichael brings over three decades of real estate experience to guide both his clients and the agents and property managers at NAI Ohio Equities. Since becoming President in 2013, he has continued to grow the brokerage team and their property management division, currently with over 24,000,000 square feet under management.\n\nIn his work as a broker and now as President, Michael leans on their core values to serve clients and grow the office: personal fulfillment, communication, integrity, and value creation. These tenets have led Michael, NAI Ohio Equities, and every team member there to become leaders in the central Ohio CRE market. As the largest locally owned brokerage and 44 years of completing more transactions than any other brokerage in the market, NAI has more experience, more relationships, and more flexibility to deliver solutions that get the job done.\n\nWhy did you decide to get into Commercial Real Estate?\n\nThe most rewarding part of being in the commercial real estate industry is the satisfaction that comes from consulting for clients who are making significant real estate decisions that impact their business and families. When clients trust my judgment, take my advice, based on my experience and analysis, I feel a fulfillment that you canât put a price on.\n\nWhy did you decide to make Columbus your home?\n\nOhio is a state of over 11,000,000 people. Central Ohio is the only region in the state with population growth, job growth, and significant new investment.\n\nWhat is your favorite neighborhood/area of Columbus and why?\n\nBeing a Bexley native and current resident, I am definitely partial to the city that was the first municipal arboretum in the country.\n\nWhat is your favorite hidden gem in Columbus?\n\nThe restaurant renaissance taking place in our urban areas; progressive and affordable, what more could you want!\n\nTestimonials\n\nThe Ohio State University\n\n\"Mike has worked with Campus Partners in a various roles including acquisitions, dispositions and consulting on various projects. In two separate projects for Campus Partners, Mike was able to compel properties owners who were previously unwilling enter into negotiations, to sell their properties, allowing projects important to both the University and the community at large to move forward.\"\n\nKeith Myers, Associate Vice President Planning and Real Estate\n\nThe New Albany Company\n\n\"New Albanyâs success stems from a high level of community interaction among all of the New Albany Companyâs business partners. Our partnership with Mike Simpson and his team at NAI Ohio Equities, which includes listing property for sale as well as managing both residential and commercial properties, contributes significantly to our vision and values: to provide the highest possible quality of life for those who live and work in New Albany.\"\n\nWilliam G. Ebbing, President\n\nGermain Lexus\n\n\"Mike and his team did a great job with our search for land to build a new Lexus service facility. Rigid requirements dictated both by state law and customer convenience narrowed the property parameters significantly, but Mike persevered and gave us great options along with great expertise in the market. Additionally, Mike was able to negotiate a contract that gave us the time we needed to entitle the property to allow for the required zoning and street access. Over all, working with Mike was a great experience.\"\n\nRick Germain\n\nTelhio Credit Union\n\n\"Mike has represented Telhio Credit Union for many years and has successfully found sites for new branches in Polaris, Grove City, Worthington and Lancaster. While some of these new sites were listed for sale, others were acquired from unwilling sellers, and with Mike's expertise, we were able to negotiate deals fair to all parties. Mike's expertise stretches beyond identifying sites and negotiating deals: Mike helps to coordinate our development team including engineers, architects and attorneys as we move through the entire development process. Overall, our experience with Mike Simpson and NAI Ohio Equites has been positive and we intend to use Mike for future real estate assignments.\"\n\nLeslie Bumgarner, President and CEO\n\nLiUNA Local 423\n\n\"With Mike Simpsonâs help, LiUNA is saving its membership thousands of dollars a year, while maintaining a location that serves us very well. Besides the savings, we have the flexibility of being a tenant. Mike did what he said he would do, and we couldnât be happier.\"\n\nMark Lynsky, Secretary Treasure\n\nClients"
