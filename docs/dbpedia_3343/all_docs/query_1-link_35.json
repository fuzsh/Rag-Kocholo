        "text": "by Anne Simpson and Vicki King\n\nIn the spring of 1998 I agreed to write a history of our Southern Chapter, which hopefully will be informational and musically correct. From the archival material I extracted for incorporation what seemed pertinent, excluding tedious financial reports, which revealed that the bank balance fluctuated from year to year in manic-depressive unpredictability. Suffice it to say, however, that we are still in business, thanks to the diligence (and sometimes distress) of the Secretary-Treasurer. Despite a few sinking spells, our chapter was never in arrears, thanks to support from the National Office and the hospitality of the host schools.\n\nMy sincere thanks go to typist-editor Vicki King, proof-reader Thomas King, out-going president Ann Taddie, advisor Charles Carroll, Stella Sung, who boxed and mailed me the archival papers, and to others who answered my queries.\n\nVoluminous correspondence to and from Gerald Farmer, David Kushner, Ray Barr, Charles Carroll, Robert Schmalz, Frank Hoogerwerf, James Braswell, Michelle Gregoire, and a few other members reflects the sincere interest of our splendid group. Unfortunately, some of the letters are undated. In the course of CMS business, the seriousness is well countered by a sense of humor, e.g., David Kushner’s “Tally ho” at the end of nearly all of his letters, and some priceless remarks by Charles Carroll.\n\nConcerning the Southern Chapter’s beginnings, Carroll recalled: “I believe that the Southern Chapter was the second of its kind, the only other one at the time being the Virginia Chapter. But their situation was somewhat different from ours, being all in one state they would convene about 11:00 on a Saturday and adjourn about 4:00 and everyone would be home for dinner the same day. Most people who attended their meeting traveled less than 150 miles to get there or a round trip of 300 miles. We had to cope with the fact that Lafayette is 1,000 miles from Miami, even meeting in Tallahassee means a long trip for almost everyone, and that fact influenced the nature of our meetings, and their planning and duration.\n\n“I think that we imitated the organization and activities of the AMS chapters, which had been functioning for some time by then. AMS was founded in 1934. I don’t know when their chapters came into being, but I would guess probably right after World War II. I went to a meeting of the Midwest Chapter in 1949 and I think the other AMS chapters were all in existence and operating well by then.\n\n“I must have some correspondence with Ray Barr about those formative days. I know that we did a certain amount of planning over a table in our house.”\n\nThe Southern Chapter should feel proud indeed that every year since 1979 four or five of its members have been selected as panelists, performers, or presenters at the national CMS meetings. In addition, David Kushner, Ray Barr, and Douglass Seaton have entries in the New Grove’s Dictionary of Music and Musicians (6th Edition). Also in this edition are entries from our Chapter or Southern area by John Baron, Amanda Burt, Regina Chauvin, Elias Dann, Harry Eskew, Donald Fouse, Leland Fox, William Gallo, Theodore Grame, Gayle Henrotte, Henry Kmen, Philip Kniseley, Virginia Kock, Yvonne LeVasseur-de-Rebolla, Norma McLeon, Bill Malone, William May, Michael Rore, Donald Thompson, and Muriel Williamson. The following members’ articles have appeared in Symposium: Charles Carroll (Spring, 1979), Robert Schmalz (Fall, 1979), Leslie Ellen Brown (Fall, 1980), Elizabeth French (Fall, 1980), Robert Glidden (Fall, 1980), David Kushner (Fall, 1980), Joe Youngblood (Spring, 1981), Douglass Seaton (Fall, 1981), Bill Ramal (Fall, 1981), Jack A. Taylor (Spring, 1982), Roger Vogel (Fall, 1982), Peter Tiboris (Fall, 1983), Lee Orr (Fall, 1983), David Kushner (Spring and Fall issues, 1983), Robert Schmalz (Fall, 1983), Anne Simpson (Spring, 1984), Ernest Harriss (Fall, 1986), James Farleigh (Fall, 1986), Robert Schmalz (Spring, 1987), Andrea Loewy (Fall, 1990), Howard Irving (Fall, 1990), Michael Harrington (Spring, 1991), David Smyth (Fall, 1992), Jeffrey Perry, Stephen Crist, Matthew Brown and Michael Bakan (Vol. 33-34, 1993-94), and Robert Riggs (Fall, 1996). Robert Schmalz has had more than 50 published articles and 100 of his scholarly papers have been read at national and regional meetings of historians and musicians. Since 1990, ten of Mary Reichling’s articles have been published in music and philosophical journals. During the summers of 1993-98 she was visiting Scholar in Residence at Indiana University, via research grants. In the last eight years, she has delivered seven papers at national meetings of MENC, CMS, and the International Society for Music Education.\n\nA copy of the Chapter Constitution will be included with the 1980 section of this history which is organized chronologically.\n\nAnne Simpson\n\n1979, Orlando, FL. The Southern Chapter of the College Music Society was organized at the University of Central Florida in Orlando, March 14-16, at a joint meeting with the American Musicological Society (AMS). Host Bruce Whisler managed to secure rooms at the Best Western/University Inn, singles for $17.50 and doubles for $22.00. Housing has not since been so economical, nor have chapter dues, which were then only $2.00. Fifty-one CMS and AMS registrants attended, an excellent response to Ray Barr’s form letter announcing the prospective new chapter. Dated December 4, 1978, and headed “Dear Colleague,” it read, in part: “The establishment of a local chapter of the CMS will be of enormous advantage to college music teachers in the South, since it will bring together faculty from all areas of college music to share new teaching methods, new textbooks and new research, as well as encouraging the assembly of music faculty from Louisiana to Florida.” Arthur Tollefson, Vice-president Elect for National CMS, responded to Barr’s letter, December 8, 1978: “May I take this opportunity to thank you in advance for your expressed interest in CMS activity at the local level and reassure you that the national officers, Executive Board, Council, and National Office are eager to assist you in every way possible.”\n\nBut no professional correspondence runs entirely smoothly, despite Charles Carroll’s unbridled energy and enthusiasm. When he received one colleague’s letter the following May, discouraging the new chapter lest it duplicate AMS, he encouragingly replied (May 24, 1979): “We might include more than just theory, music history and appreciation, analysis and such. Maybe we could even entice a few music education people, divorce them from the music merchants to whom they are in thrall and get them into a conversation about something besides tests and measurements, maybe even music.”\n\nIntroductory speakers, hosts and committees on arrangements included Ray Barr, Bruce Whisler, Trevor Colbourn, Gary Wolf and Rebecca Kushner. Presiding at the inaugural meeting was Chappell White, National CMS President. Carroll was elected chapter President, to be assisted by Ray Barr as Secretary-Treasurer, both by acclamation. Carroll will represent our Southern Chapter at the National CMS meeting in San Antonio, October of 1979.\n\nCharles Carroll was Assistant Editor of Symposium from 1975 to 1979 and Editor from 1979 to 1983. Carroll’s entry will appear in the Seventh edition of the aforementioned Grove. Carroll, Barr, Baron, Fox, and Thompson also have contributed to The New Grove Dictionary of Opera. Carroll has articles on fifteen musicians in Die Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart (MGG), and will retain authorship of the revised articles in the new forthcoming edition; four articles and a joint article (with Jean-François Dupont Danican and Marcelle Benoit) in the Musique en France aux XVII et XVIII Siècles; and an article (on Henry Carey) in vol. 84 of the Dictionary of Literary Biography, a publication better known to English literature people than to musicians.\n\nRobert Schmalz was named a USL Foundation Distinguished Professor.\n\nThe chapter Newsletter was begun in 1979. Charter members of the Southern Chapter as listed on a disk in the archives were:\n\nRobert Acton\n\nBrad Albers\n\nMarysue Barnes\n\nRay Barr\n\nMark Bergaas\n\nKeith Brumfield\n\nJames R. Burke\n\nAmanda Burt\n\nCharles Carroll\n\nW. Ronald Clemmons\n\nDinos Constantinides\n\nRobert Delcamp Dorothy Drennan\n\nGerald Farmer\n\nFenton Fly\n\nDonald Fouse\n\nElizabeth French\n\nJames H. Fry\n\nThomas Gibbs\n\nRobert Glidden\n\nMilton Hallman\n\nGayle Henrotte\n\nJanice Holly\n\nFrank Hoogerwerf Wiley Housewright\n\nWilliam Jones\n\nDesmond Kincaid\n\nColleen Kirk\n\nLee Kjelson\n\nKenneth B. Klaus\n\nKenneth S. Klaus\n\nS. Philip Kniseley\n\nDavid Kushner\n\nTed Lashley\n\nKaren Louwenaar\n\nDonald Lowe Charlene McDonald\n\nLee Orr\n\nArnold Penland, Jr.\n\nEckhart Richter\n\nRobert Schmalz\n\nDouglass Seaton\n\nMadelyn Trible\n\nGlenn Walden\n\nJerry Warren\n\nBruce Whisler\n\nand Barbara Wieman\n\n1979 meeting program\n\nConcerts featured the Philadelphia Orchestra, harpsichordist Novie Greene, violinist Dinos Constantinides, and Stravinsky’s L’Histoire du Soldat by the University of Central Florida Chamber Ensemble.\n\nFlorida State University got the bid to host the 1980 meeting, Feb. 7-9. Carroll and Barr began plans for it immediately. Carroll suggested featuring a “star” performer for a drawing card, and also the possibility of a joint meeting with either the American Society of University Composers (ASUC) or the Southeastern Composers’ League. Dean Robert Glidden, of the FSU School of Music, was invited as featured speaker, and as Carroll wrote Barr (May 25, 1979) “. . . administrators are like U.S. SenatorsI’ve never seen one who could turn down a chance to make a speech.” Hopes that Paul Hedwall, Southeastern President of ASUC, could participate in some way did not materialize, due to his death in August, 1979. Dennis Kam would continue Hedwall’s duties as program chair. Carroll, Barr, and Elias Dann were to be the planning committee for the 1980 meeting.\n\n1980, Tallahassee, FL. In 1980 the Southern Chapter of CMS met in Tallahassee at Florida State University, February 6-9. A new music building had just been completed. Hosts and coordinators were: Dean Robert Glidden, Elias Dann, Douglass Seaton, Harold Schiffman, and Thomas Hinton. Program chairs for the joint meeting with ASUC were Charles Carroll (CMS) and Dennis Kam (ASUC). President Carroll and Secretary-Treasurer Barr conducted the business meeting when the following were elected to office for the 1980-82 term: Ray Barr, President; Douglass Seaton, President-Elect; Robert Schmalz, Secretary-Treasurer; Frank Hoogerwerf and Charlene McDonald, Executive Board members. A new Constitution and Bylaws for the Southern Chapter were read, discussed and approved. (Copy follows.) Raising the annual chapter dues to $3.00 was approved.\n\nDean Glidden gave the welcoming address, entitled “Our Challenge for the Eighties.”\n\n1980 meeting program\n\nCharter member Kenneth B. Klaus died August 4, 1980. He was composer, conductor, violist, music historian and coordinator of graduate studies at Louisiana State University.\n\nLouisiana State University in Baton Rouge will host the 1981 Southern Chapter in conjunction with the Southern Chapter of AMS.\n\n1981, Baton Rouge, LA. Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge hosted the Southern Chapters of CMS and AMS at a joint meeting on March 25-27. Dean Lyle Merriman gave the introductions and welcoming speech. Wallace McKenzie and Dinos Constantinides were in charge of local arrangements. Since President Ray Barr was at Oxford University on a research sabbatical, Secretary-Treasurer Robert Schmalz was in charge of the business meeting. Barbara Noel, based at Texas Women’s University, was guest speaker and expressed concern over the place of music in American colleges and universities, advocating a change in philosophy and direction.\n\n1981 meeting program\n\nRobert Schmalz chaired a panel on “Unionism in Higher Education,” with participants James Burke, Charles Carroll, Bruce Whisler, and Ronald Riddle. Special concerts were given by “New Times,” presenting works by CMS and AMS members Don Freund, James Guthrie, Harold Schiffman, John Sharpley, Mickie Willis, and Dinos Constantinides; Constance Navratil (Soprano) and Nancy Saxon (Pianist); Les Clairs-Acadiens (a USL choral group directed by Peter Tiboris); the LSU Collegium Musicum (directed by Wallace McKenzie); and the LSU Opera Theater, which presented Poulenc’s Dialogue of the Carmelites (directed by Richard Aslanian).\n\nThis year was productive for a number of Southern Chapter members. Participating in NEH summer seminars were: Bruce Whisler and Frank Hoogerwerf (at Harvard), Gerald Farmer (at Oberlin), and Robert Schmalz (at Amherst/Mt. Holyoke). Carol Quin received an Andrew Mellon research grant to plan a music program at Lane College. Charles Carroll continued as Editor of Symposium. In July of 1981 Charles Carroll and Ray Barr attended a Wingspread Conference near Racine, Wisconsin, where Frank Lloyd Wright had designed Wingspread, a private home, in 1939. Since 1960 Wingspread has become the setting for many conferences and meetings dealing with subjects of regional, national, and international interests. The focus for this 1991 conference was “Music in General Studies.” Carroll’s speech at the final luncheon urged all participants to return to their respective campuses and “spread the good news of music in general studies.”\n\nPresenters and attendees from the Southern Chapter at the national meeting in Cincinnati were: Charles Carroll; David Kushner, “Ernest Bloch as a Music Educator;” Jack Taylor, “Computer Assisted Instruction;” Dinos Constantinides, “Recital of Works by CMS Composers;” and Peter Tiboris, moderator of a panel on Performance Training.\n\nSeveral of Dinos Constantinides’ works were premiered this year, including performances in Atlanta and New York City. Besides a Grove dictionary entry on Ernest Bloch, David Kushner contributed one to the Swiss Refardt Lexikon, and completed a commission from the BBC to review/update program annotations for their holdings of Bloch’s recorded works.\n\nThe 1982 Southern Chapter meeting was scheduled at Georgia State University in Atlanta, with Lee Orr as host and in conjunction with the South Central Chapter of AMS.\n\n1982, Atlanta, GA. Georgia State University in Atlanta hosted the joint Southern Chapter meeting with AMS (South Central Chapter) on March 18-20, 1982. The introduction and welcome were given by Dr. Steven Winick, Chairman of the Department of Music (GSU), and Dr. Clyde Faulkner, Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences (GSU). President Ray Barr and Secretary-Treasurer Robert Schmalz presided at the business session. Schmalz’s report revealed that of 450 colleagues who received Southern Chapter mail, only seventy-four supported with dues. Since Newsletter mailing is costly, it was suggested that National send out Chapter letters via bulk rate; that per capita allotment be initiated for regional chapters; and that the National Office rebate a portion of National dues to regional chapters. A discussion on the advisability of joint meetings with compatible organizations followed. Charles Carroll stated his intention to publish abstracts of CMS papers, with the cooperation of members in respect to deadlines.\n\nNew officers are: Douglass Seaton, President; Robert Schmalz, President-Elect; and Frank Hoogerwerf, Secretary-Treasurer. Elected to the Executive Board were Charlene McDonald and William Jones.\n\nDavid Kushner was made a National Arts Associate of Sigma Alph Iota music fraternity this year. Soon-to-be Southern Chapter member David Russell Williams, Chairman of the Department of Music at Memphis State, was re-elected National Secretary at the 1981 Cincinnati convention. Music historian Robert J. Nicolosi (University of Alabama) died of a cardiac ailment on October 12, 1982. Douglass Seaton constructed and compiled results of a detailed quiz whose general thrust was the betterment and improved efficiency of CMS.\n\n1982 meeting program\n\nConcert highlights were an all-Brahms program by the Atlanta Symphony, and Ives’ Concord Sonata performed by pianist Ruth MacDonald.\n\nThe Southern Chapter 1983 meeting was scheduled at the University of South Alabama in Mobile.\n\n1983, Mobile, AL. William T. Jones was the host/coordinator in charge of local arrangements when the Southern Chapter met March 3-5, 1983, at the University of South Alabama in Mobile. This marked the first year that our group had not met without a companion organization. Member involvement increased considerably. At this time Douglass Seaton was President, Robert Schmalz was President-Elect and Frank Hoogerwerf the Secretary-Treasurer. As Seaton’s attempt to get a one dollar per person dues refund from the National Office failed, dues remained at $3.00. Charles Carroll expressed concern over duplication of papers submitted to CMS and AMS Southern Chapter meetings. A motion was made and carried, avoiding overlapping of officers in these organizations. Carroll reaffirmed his intention, as editor of Symposium, to publish Southern Chapter abstracts.\n\n1983 meeting program\n\nSpecial concerts were by the University of South Alabama faculty, “Songs of Liszt and Krenek”; Carl Fels, oboist with Myers Mason, pianist; Ronald M. Manning, tenor with Kenneth Keaton, guitarist; Dinos Constantinides, violinist, with Michal Rickman, pianist.\n\nLess intellectual entertainment included a wine-and-cheese yacht trip on Mobile Bay, hosted by the local chapter of Sigma Alpha Iota.\n\nThis year David Russell Williams was elected an active member of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, and to the Board of Sponsors for the Metropolitan Mid-South Regional Auditions. He is listed in the Forty-third edition of Who’s Who in America and has recently produced an album, John Stover, Guitar, for Highwater Records in Memphis. In May David Kushner was the representative musicologist on a Forum for the Petit Jean, Arkansas International Art Song Festival.\n\nThe 1984 Southern Chapter meeting will be at the University of Florida in Gainesville. The slate of officers for 1983-84 is: President, Robert Schmalz; President-Elect, Gerald Farmer; Frank Hoogerwerf, Secretary-Treasurer. Board members are William Jones and Charlene McDonald.\n\n1984, Gainesville, FL. At the 1984 Southern Chapter meeting in Gainesville at the University of Florida, March 1-3, there were over seventy attendees, forty-two of whom were registrants. President Robert Schmalz and Secretary-Treasurer Frank Hoogerwerf conducted the business session on March 2.\n\nAt another business session David Kushner was elected President-Elect; Jeffrey Kite-Powell and Bruce Whisler were elected to the Executive Board. Irma Collins submitted a detailed proposal for a panel, “New Collegiate Music Curriculum,” to be organized for the 1985 meeting. Tentative panelists would be David Kushner, Patricia Coates, Barbara Noel, and Collins, some representing chapters other than the Southern. Frank Hoogerwerf requested a $100 honorarium for the panelists. This year the National Office awarded a $250 budget to be used at the chapter’s discretion. Rating sheets were put into effect to select papers and proposals for future meetings. The National Office would issue new CMS stationery to regional chapters this year.\n\nThere was voluminous, often hilarious, correspondence this year amongst Gerald Farmer, Frank Hoogerwerf, and David Kushner concerning details for the 1985 meeting. Dean Robert Glidden of Florida State University, the coming meeting site, was invited to give the welcoming speech, which he promptly sent to Hoogerwerf for approval.\n\nThis year Ray Barr was elected to the CMS National Council. Jane Perry-Camp was soloist in the premiere of Harold Schiffman’s Concerto for Piano and Orchestra at FSU in February. Southern Chapter Board members were Jeffrey T. Kite-Powell and Bruce Whisler. Incoming officers would be Gerald Farmer, President, David Kushner, President-Elect, and Frank Hoogerwerf would continue as Secretary-Treasurer.\n\n1984 meeting program\n\nConcerts were presented by Nuita Isserlin, pianist; the University of Florida Renaissance Ensemble, John S. Kitts, director; University of Florida Baroque Ensemble: Sarah Baird Fouse (flute), Mark S. Ostoich (oboe), John D. White (cello); Willis R. Bodine (harpsichord); Cumberland Quintet; The Threepenny Opera, University of Florida Opera Theater (Elizabeth Graham, Williard Brask, Joe Conger, directors); John De Chiaro (guitarist); music for violin and oboe, Clarke-Riordan Duo.\n\nThe 1985 Southern Chapter Meeting was scheduled at Florida State University in Tallahassee.\n\n1985, Tallahassee, FL. A joint meeting with the CMS Southern Chapter and the Sonneck Society was held in Tallahassee at Florida State University, with Douglass Seaton as host and arrangements chairperson. CMS Southern Chapter Secretary-Treasurer, Frank Hoogerwerf, was the Sonneck Chairperson. Dean Robert Glidden, the welcoming speaker, was introduced by President Gerald Farmer.\n\nAt the business meeting Greg Sorcsek urged more composers to arrange for performers of their works to aid the Performance Committee in arrangements and resources. Bill Ramal indicated certain membership preferences for special study sessions on ethnomusicology, the role of search committees, the music industry, and the performer’s role in the University in comparison to the Conservatory and the music industry. Ray Barr stated his preference for more chapter meetings outside Florida.\n\nQuincy Hilliard, Jeffrey Kite-Powell, David Kushner, Anne Simpson, and Bill Ramal were appointed to a Committee for Special Sessions. New officers elected for a two-year term were David Kushner, President; Gerald Farmer, Secretary-Treasurer; and James Braswell, President-Elect.\n\nBarbara Noel, from the Southeastern Massachusetts University School of Visual and Performing Arts, and Phillip Rhodes, CMS National President-Elect, attended the Tallahassee meeting. Rhodes gave an address relating National concerns, and Noel was on the Collegiate Curriculum panel with Irma Collins, Patricia Coates and David Kushner.\n\n1985 meeting program\n\nIn addition to the papers and lecture/recitals, several concerts were given by performers with the Festival of New Music. A violin and piano recital of “20th Century American Music” was presented by Dinos Constantinides and Nancy Saxon. Phillip Rhodes was the featured composer whose works Adventure Fantasies for Young Players for wind orchestra; a choral piece, In Praise of Wisdom, with oboes, bassoons, and English horn; and Visions of Remembrance for soprano and mezzo-soprano were performed.\n\nLater in the year, Farmer wrote to John G. Suess, CMS National Vice-President, suggesting Ramal’s topics (mentioned above) as panels for special sessions, plus “Early Music in the College Curriculum” and “Contemporary CompositionWho Do You Write For?” Farmer’s other suggestions to Suess were a modest cash award for the outstanding Southern Chapter composer, and a $250 honorarium to the Keynote Speaker. In October, 1985, National Executive Director Robby Gunstream announced plans to publish abstracts of presentations at the 1986 Southern Chapter meeting.\n\nSouthern Chapter members who participated at the national meeting in Miami were Ray Barr, Dave Olsen, Bob Smith, Charles Campbell, Dennis Kam, David Kushner, Lee Riggins, Susan Lackman, Robert Schmalz, Charles Mason, Stephen Robinson, and Gerald Farmer.\n\nThe 1986 meeting was scheduled at the University of Southwestern Louisiana in Lafayette, March 6-8.\n\n1986, Lafayette, LA. Thirty-six Southern Chapter members registered for the 1986 meeting at the University of Southwestern Louisiana in Lafayette, March 6-8. Robert Schmalz was host and Greg Sorcsek organized the Composers’ Concert. President David Kushner and Secretary-Treasurer Gerald Farmer conducted the business meeting at which James Braswell became President-Elect (1985-87), Greg Sorcsek and Susan Lackman were elected board members (1986-88).\n\nMembers were urged to promote further participation by graduate students, though the number of graduate papers submitted was considerable. Dues of $3.00 now became payable between January 1 and March 1. This year guidelines for submission of abstracts were issued, stating in essence: each participant must submit a typed abstract summarizing his presentation, no more than 250 words, double-spaced on 8 1/2 x 11 paper, with title at the top, author and institutional affiliation at the bottom. Formal, third person style is preferred, and topic must be accurately reflected.\n\nThe guest speaker was Arthur Tollefson, Past-President of National CMS, who stressed the mission of the society; the expansion of regional chapters nationwide; quality of leadership on national and regional levels; expansion of national office staff to three full-time employees; increase in CMS membership to an all-time high; development of “critical issues agenda;” search for a new editor of CMS Symposium Proceedings; need for greater voter participation in National elections; need for continued support for the Boulder Institute; and need for increased attendance at national meetings.\n\nPanelists discussing “Ethnomusicology in the American College and University” were David Kushner, Dave Olsen, David Warren Steele, and Ronald Riddle. Charles Carroll, Quincy Hilliard, Richard Sanchez and Bruce Whisler shared a panel on “The Search Committee: Its Role and Function.”\n\nSouthern Chapter composers featured were Richard Winchel, Charles Reynolds, Daniel Adams, Quincy Hilliard, Marvin Lamb, and Greg Sorcsek. Eugene Flemm presented a piano recital.\n\n1986 meeting program\n\nConcerning the program, David Kushner wrote in a Newsletter: “The quality and quantity of both the proposals and compositions pursuant to our Chapter meeting, March 6-8 in Lafayette, LA, have been a source of pride to me and to the review committee.”\n\nIn a less serious vein, and removed from all sessions, soon-to-retire Charles Carroll was given a jolly surprise roast. Carroll seemed to have “done it all” during his career as co-founder of our chapter, editor of Symposium, teacher, lecturer, orchestra manager, composer, author, critic, and correspondent par excellence.\n\nLetters in 1986 from Kushner to Farmer indicated signs of a lesser roast, by correspondence, of Robert Schmalz. Kushner wrote: “The Gators crushed the Ragin’ Cajuns of Southwestern LA today. I heard Bob Schmalz was dropping the team’s membership in AMS.” And another to Farmer said: “Here is the draft [of the composers’ concert] just sent to me by Bob Schmalz. Apart from a few typos and the omission of chairs and a few sessions and the list of specific composers and works, the program appears to be in order.”\n\nThe 1987 meeting was scheduled at the University of Georgia in Athens. James Braswell suggested that a special focus be given to “Commercial Music and Collegiate Music Training.” Specific areas to be addressed were performance, publishing, retailing and recording.\n\n1987, Athens, GA. James Braswell hosted the Southern Chapter meeting at the University of Georgia in Athens, March 5-7, which drew seventy registrants. President David Kushner and Secretary-Treasurer Gerald Farmer, both outgoing from their offices, were replaced by James Braswell (1987-89) and Lee Riggins (1987-89).\n\nNew board members elected for 1988-90 were Anne Simpson, Musicology; Nancy Barry, Music Education; Karen Harrison (later Karen Garrison); and Michael Harrington, Composition/Theory. Outgoing members were Greg Sorcsek and Susan Lackman.\n\nA discussion of Composers’ Concerts at the business meeting resulted in a new procedure for Call for Scores. From now on a respresentative from the host institution will be asked to indicate performers (individuals and ensembles) to limit acceptance of scores to the available department resources. Additional performers within the Society may be contacted if needed.\n\nNational CMS President David Willoughby attended the Athens meeting, and was a panelist with National Board member Sally Monsour for the session “Music in General Studies: Tasks for CMS and MENC.” Gerald Farmer was moderator. Richard Sanchez chaired another panel, “Student Motivation and Morale” with Gerald Farmer and Susan Lackman as speakers. Concerts were given by pianist Boaz Sharon, and the Sax Chamber Music Society directed by Lawrence Gwozdz. Composers’ works, featured in two concerts, were by Charles Mason, C. Michael Colman, Roger Vogel, John Corina, Michael Harrington, Karl Boelter, Patrick Houlihan, and Marvin Lamb.\n\n1987 meeting program\n\nAn invitation was extended by Michael Harrington for the Southern Chapter to meet at Belmont College in Nashville in 1988.\n\n1988, Nashville, TN. The 1988 Southern Chapter meeting was held at Belmont College in Nashville, March 10-12. Officers this year were James Braswell, President, Gerald Farmer, President-Elect, Michele Gregoire, replacing Lee Riggins, Secretary-Treasurer. Board members newly elected were Anne Simpson, Musicology; Nancy Barry, Music Education, Michael Harrington, Theory/Composition; and Karen Harrison, Performance.\n\nElliot Schwartz, National President-Elect, attended this meeting. He suggested raising chapter dues to $5.00, as did Douglass Seaton, who also encouraged members to vote for national officers. President Braswell expressed a hope that more national CMS members in the Southern region would become active in the Southern Chapter. Concerning composers submitting compositions, some new ways were examined for providing ensemble performers and judging of compositions.\n\nSeveral Southern Chapter members reported news of their recent activities. Dinos Constantinides had premieres of four new works: Genteel Dialogue; Reflections IV; String Quartet No. 1; Mutability Quartet; and a one-act opera, Intimations, was performed in New York City. Anne Simpson’s biography of Harry T. Burleigh, Hard Trials, was accepted for publication by Scarecrow Press.

Choreographed compositions were encouraged. Preferably, composers should provide their own performers. Douglass Seaton apprised the members that as an educational/charitable organization CMS could no longer offer its vacancy list to members. Seaton recognized the Southern Chapter as “one of the most active chapters of the Society, both in quantity and quality of its presentations and meetings.”\n\nPresident Farmer elicited considerable interest in his plans for a special meeting in Brunnthal, Germany in June of 1992, in conjunction with CMS Europe Inc.
