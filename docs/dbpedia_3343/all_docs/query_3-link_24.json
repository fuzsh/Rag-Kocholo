        "text": "Hello friends and colleagues I’ve made the decision to leave Fraser Basin Council in the early spring of 2022 and informed my employer last week. I’ve thoroughly enjoyed my time there over the last 15 years in varying capacities, starting in the Cariboo-Chilcotin and now residing in Kamloops for the last 10 years and overseeing all Interior Regional Programs. I’ve grown in many ways, had challenging opportunities and learned from all of my colleagues. The role that the Fraser Basin Council plays as an advocate for sustainability and an impartial facilitator is so very unique and very powerful. I’ve had great bosses – David Marshall and Gail Wallin – that I’ve learned so much from, that provided me freedom and flexibility. I’ve facilitated a broad range of topics ranging from climate change adaptation to economic development to watershed management to relationship building and advancing reconciliation with Indigenous nations. This work has involved all orders of government, the private sector and community interests, all with the goal of advancing #sustainability and the consideration of social, economic and environmental factors. My last day of full time work will be March 31, and I will transition out in April after fiscal year end and wrapping up several projects and ensuring a smooth transition to my successor. I’ve realized over the past few years that my passion is natural resource management, in particular #forestry and #forestmanagement. I feel like I am returning to my roots, since my first career is as a registered professional forester in BC since 1996, and I worked full time in forestry consulting from 1994 to 2006. I’ve maintained my involvement through very part time consulting since 2006 in a variety of roles, even managing about 10 field days per year for the last 5 years. As I enter my early 50s, my intention is to focus on #forestry and #naturalresources management for this latter third of my career as a self-employed consultant through my company M.F. Simpson Ltd. I look forward to opportunities to bring my experience and skills to work with many of you supporting forest and natural resource management in multiple ways – forest stewardship or landscape planning, wildfire risk reduction, #collaboration and #facilitation across sectors to address complex issues and competing values and advancing how natural resource management can advance climate change adaptation and mitigation. Looking forward to a change after 15 years and seeing what 2022 brings. Mike"
