I did HARD COPY when they did -- for Nicole's birthday, we did a little bit of a -- who Nicole was.\n\nQ: Barbara Walters and HARD COPY did interviews that aired on television. Is that what you're saying?\n\nA: Yes. Yes. I don't know. A few of the television [sic].

And who at Fifi was working with you on the book at that time?\n\nA: It was Brooke Skulski was supposed to be my collaborator on that book, but we had a year contract, and it expired November 5th, '95.\n\nQ: So you entered into that contract around November of --\n\nA: November, right.\n\nQ: -- '94?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: You have to let me ask my question because he can't get us both down at same time.

Not writing. Yeah, we did.\n\nQ: You sat and had sessions with her?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ:How many?\n\nA: I don't know.

Yes.\n\nQ: Nothing else she gave you?\n\nA: Well, that was pretty much. Not more. She couldn't find a publisher, so --\n\nQ: Are you saying that there were only eight pages that were ever written down by Brooke Skulski based on her work with you?\n\nA: That's what she gave me, yes.\n\nQ: Do you know of any other pages that she wrote besides the eight?\n\nA: I don't know.\n\nQ: Have you ever asked to see?\n\nA: I never asked.\n\nQ: Did you ask for the material back when you entered into the contract with John Taplin Williams, who is writing your new book?\n\nA: John Taylor Williams?\n\nQ: John Taylor Williams.\n\nA: Did I ask for the tapes or whatever?\n\nQ: Yes, the tapes or the written materials or anything else that she produced.\n\nA: When that contract expired with Brooke Skulski, I asked for those tapes, and she refused to give it back to me because she said it's her tape.\n\nAnd I said, you know, \"It's my life story,\" so she -- I don't have possession of it.\n\nQ: What about the eight pages? Where are they?\n\nA: Well, I don't have it anymore.\n\nQ: Threw them away?\n\nA: Yeah.\n\nQ: When did you throw them away?\n\nA: Well, I can find -- I can look in my, you know -- I don't know. I moved --\n\nQ: You were subpoenaed with these materials. You were supposed to bring them here to the deposition today, and I can't complete it without those materials.\n\nA: Okay.\n\nMR. KRAMER: This actually is an ideal time for me to assert certain privacy rights that Cora Fischman has. She told me that she had no documents, and I informed your office or had my associate informed your office.\n\nIf it turns out that she does have documents, we are not waiving her rights of privacy protected by Article I, Section 1, of the California Constitution, and I would want to look at whatever documents she has to make certain that the disclosure of those documents don't somehow invade or impede her right of privacy.\n\nMR. PETROCELLI: Okay. Well, that all should have been done before today.\n\nMR. KRAMER: Well, actually the Rutter Group has a section that says that now is the appropriate time for --\n\nMR. PETROCELLI: I am not interested in your lecturing me on the law. I only want to get the documents that I subpoenaed, and it seems to me that you've made no effort to find them, and I am now going to have to examine the witness on what she did to locate these documents.\n\nTHE WITNESS: You know, I've moved a couple times --\n\nMR. KRAMER: Hold on. Hold on.\n\nMR. PETROCELLI: We will get into that, how many times you moved. Okay? Let's focus on what we were talking about before.\n\nMR. KRAMER: I have no intention of lecturing you on the law.\n\nMR. PETROCELLI: Okay.\n\nMR. KRAMER: All I want to do is preserve the rights of my client, which I have now done.\n\nMR. PETROCELLI: I have --\n\nMR. BAKER: No concern about the rights of his client?\n\nMR. PETROCELLI: I have no problem with what you want to do on behalf of your client. There is no need to thrust over the table Rutter Group materials to me.\n\nQ: So let's get back to what I was asking you. Where are the eight pages?\n\nA: I don't know.\n\nMR.BAKER: I think she's been asked and answered.\n\nMR. PETROCELLI: I don't care.\n\nQ: Answer it again.\n\nA: I said I don't know.\n\nMR. BAKER: You don't care if you are asking questions over and over harassing the witness?\n\nMR. PETROCELLI: I don't care to comment, Mr. Baker. Let's just get on with the deposition. You are just wasting time.\n\nQ: Please, Miss Fischman, answer the question.\n\nA: I said I don't know. But I can look. I will look for it.\n\nQ: Have you looked for anything?\n\nA: Have I looked for anything?\n\nQ: In response to my subpoena.\n\nA: Yes, I did.\n\nQ: Where did you look?\n\nA: Well, you know, I've looked in my boxes. I've moved twice already, so... But I didn't think that was important.\n\nQ: I have subpoenaed every single thing that you have in your possession: Tape-recordings, documents, pieces of paper, notes, calendars, anything at all about O.J. Simpson and about Nicole Brown Simpson --\n\nA: Okay.\n\nQ: -- or anything related in any way to the various issues that are enumerated in the subpoena.\n\nDid you ever see a copy of the subpoena?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Okay. When did you first see it?\n\nA: That subpoena?\n\nQ: Yes.\n\nA: When it was handed to me.\n\nMR. PETROCELLI: Let me mark this as Exhibit 1.\n\n(Discussion held off the record.)\n\n(Plaintiffs' Exhibit 151 was marked for identification by the reporter\n\nand is attached hereto.)\n\nBY MR. PETROCELLI:\n\nQ: Let me show you Exhibit 151, which is a subpoena duces tecum requesting you to appear here and bring materials with you.\n\nWhen did you first see a copy of that subpoena or the original of it?\n\nA: When did I see this? The day that the man gave this to me.\n\nQ: And what records did you search?\n\nA: What records did I search? You know, I really never paid attention to it because I thought I didn't have any records of anything, so...\n\nQ: Well, you were required by law to pay attention to it, so will you tonight search everything in your possession, custody and control --\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: -- in response to that subpoena?\n\nMR. BAKER: You don't need to take legal advice from Mr. Petrocelli.\n\nBY MR. PETROCELLI:\n\nQ: Okay.\n\nA: Yes, sir.\n\nQ: Will you do so?\n\nA: Yes, sir.\n\nQ: Including photographs, any notes, any handwritten pieces of paper, anything, tape recordings, anything.\n\nA: Yes, sir.\n\nQ: Are you aware of any tape recordings that in any way relate to Nicole Brown Simpson or O.J. Simpson?\n\nA: Not aware of any.\n\nQ: Excuse me?\n\nA: I don't know.\n\nMR. KELLY: I'm sorry. I can't hear you, Miss Fischman.\n\nTHE WITNESS: I don't know.\n\nBY MR. PETROCELLI:\n\nQ: What do you mean, you don't know?\n\nA: What do you mean, aware of tapes?\n\nQ: Yeah. Are there any tape recordings that you've ever made other than the ones that you've mentioned with regards to Brooke Skulski?\n\nA: That's the only one I have.\n\nQ: Okay.

PETROCELLI: I want to know.\n\nTHE WITNESS: [Address Deleted]\n\nBY MR. PETROCELLI:\n\nQ: [Address Deleted]?\n\nMR. BAKER: Just to be clear, there is some concerns that this information gets disseminated. What we have been doing on personal information is having him write it down and kept in the possession of plaintiffs' attorney.\n\nMR. PETROCELLI: There is nothing confidential about a prior address.\n\nMR. KRAMER: This is a prior address. This is why --\n\nMR. BAKER: Well, I'm just -- you are obviously going to ask about the 15th Street address, I assume, and if you do, just so we're clear, that can be handled in a way to protect Miss Fischman's privacy.\n\nMR.

BAKER: This is totally irrelevant.\n\nTHE WITNESS: No one.\n\nBY MR. PETROCELLI:\n\nQ: Okay. And have you lived with the three children the entire time at 15th Street in Santa Monica?\n\nA: Entire time?\n\nQ: Yeah, that you've been there.\n\nA: I share it with my husband, so we share custody, so --\n\nQ: And the children stay where?\n\nA: I don't get it.\n\nQ: What I am trying to find outis this: Has anyone else resided with you in Santa Monica --\n\nA: Nobody --\n\nQ: -- other than your children?\n\nA: Exactly.\n\nQ: No one else. Correct?\n\nA: No one else.\n\nQ: And has anyone else resided with you at Goshen Avenue other than your children?\n\nA: Exactly.\n\nQ: Correct?\n\nA: My kids, yes.\n\nQ: Now, you said something about custody. Are you divorced?\n\nA: I'm in the process of getting divorced.\n\nQ: Okay. That's not complete yet?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: And you became separated from your husband when you moved into Goshen Avenue in November of '94. Is that correct?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: And before November of '94 you were at all times residing at 200 North Rockingham?\n\nA: All times?\n\nQ: Up -- down to 1986.\n\nA: No. I lived on Barrington one time in 1990.\n\nQ: For a short period of time?\n\nA: Right.\n\nQ: How long?\n\nA: For six months.\n\nQ: Alone?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: While you were separated from your husband?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Okay. 19- -- in 1990 you lived on Barrington for six months in an apartment.\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: And other than that six-month interval, from 1986 until November of 1994 you resided at all times at 200 North Rockingham.

PETROCELLI:\n\nQ: Did you file for legal separation before then?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: So the first legal proceeding was June of '95. Right?\n\nA: Was November. When I moved in November, that was basically -- the lawyer said we were legally separated when I moved out in November.\n\nQ: Were papers filed with the court then?\n\nMR. KRAMER: Whatever your lawyer might have told you, that's between you and your lawyer. Okay?\n\nTHE WITNESS: Okay.\n\nBY MR. PETROCELLI:\n\nQ: Were papers filed in November of '94?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: Who is your divorce lawyer?\n\nMR. BAKER: Let me just state that the divorce status -- the marital status of a non-party witness is completely out of bounds and totally irrelevant to this litigation.\n\nBY MR. PETROCELLI:\n\nQ: You may answer. What is the name of your divorce lawyer?\n\nA: I'm changing it, so I don't have anyone right now.\n\nQ: Well, who was the last divorce lawyer you had?\n\nA: We have a mediator. His name is Mr. Marsden.\n\nQ: But who is the name of your lawyer?\n\nA: Mr. Weissman.\n\nQ: What's his first name?\n\nA: Ken Weissman.\n\nQ: Okay. And who is Mr. Fischman's lawyer?\n\nA: I don't know. I've forgot his name.\n\nQ: Do you have a new lawyer, divorce lawyer?\n\nA: Planning to, yes.\n\nQ: And what's his or her name?\n\nA: Her name is Miss La Guardia.\n\nQ: First name?\n\nA: Maryanne.\n\nQ: Maryanne?\n\nA: Uh-huh. Yes.\n\nQ: Have any depositions been taken in your divorce case?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: Now, going back to the time when you were paid $15,000 by Star Magazine, you said that you wanted to say some good things about the Simpsons because bad things were being said about Nicole.\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Okay. What bad things were being said about Nicole?\n\nA: Bad things?\n\nQ:Yeah.\n\nA: Well, the way she was portrayed by the media.\n\nQ: How was she being portrayed?\n\nA: How? Just didn't like the way she was portrayed by the tabloid with like this happy-go-lucky woman, you know. That's not the woman that I knew.\n\nQ: Any other bad things that were being said or were portrayed about her that you objected to and wanted to set the record straight about?\n\nA: I don't remember. To me everything was bad when it all came out.\n\nQ: What about her was bad that you specifically objected to that caused you to --\n\nA: Yeah, all the pictures --\n\nQ: Star Magazine?\n\nA: All the tabloids, all these different men. I mean...\n\nQ: The fact that she was being portrayed as a woman who dated lots of men?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: And that bothered you?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Any time you want to take a break, please feel free to do so.\n\nMR. KRAMER: Need a minute?\n\nLet's take just a moment. All right?\n\nMR. PETROCELLI: Sure.\n\nTHE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the record now, and the time is approximately 10:19.\n\n(Recess.)\n\nTHE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record now, and the time is approximately 10:28.\n\nBY MR. PETROCELLI:\n\nQ: Off -- right before the break you were telling me that you had -- were having real problems with Nicole being portrayed as a kind of loose woman dating many men. You were objecting to Nicole's portrayal as a loose woman.\n\nDo you recall that testimony?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: And as a result, you felt compelled to come out and say something in her behalf. Is that right?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: What did you say in her behalf?\n\nA: Well, I tried to humanize Nicole. You know, she was a mom. She was -- we did a lot of things together as mom, not just those going out clubbing and going out with different men and stuff like that. She was portrayed negatively by the media, so...\n\nQ: Did you read any books that portrayed her negatively?\n\nA: Books?\n\nQ: Yeah.\n\nA: There was Faye Resnick's book.\n\nQ: You read that book?\n\nA: I didn't read it. I glanced through it.\n\nQ: And in glancing through it, you saw material in there that you thought was objectionable?\n\nA: I thought it was tasteless.\n\nQ: What material was that?\n\nA: Faye Resnick book.\n\nQ: What material in the Resnick book did you regard as tasteless?\n\nA: I think overall the book was.\n\nQ: Overall?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: But you never read it. You just glanced through it. Right?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: And you don't like Faye Resnick. Do you?\n\nA: I don't like -- I mean, it's not that. I just feel sorry for her.\n\nQ: Why?\n\nA: Just the type of woman she is.\n\nQ: What type of woman is she?\n\nA: Well, I think as Nicole and I used to call her the drama queen, so that speaks for itself.\n\nQ: What does that mean?\n\nA: She's a very -- I don't know. To me I never trusted that woman, the first day I met her.\n\nQ: Did you tell her that?\n\nA: Well, no. Cici Shahian told me; Chris Jenner told me --\n\nQ: Told you what?\n\nA: That, \"Watch out for Faye. She's a very high-maintenance woman.\"\n\nQ: Was she your friend?\n\nA: No, she was not my friend.\n\nQ: Never socialized with Faye Resnick?\n\nA: I socialized with Faye because of Nicole, you know, but she pretty much was Nicole's friend.\n\nQ: Did you try to persuade Nicole not to have a relationship with Faye?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: On numerous occasions?\n\nA: Well, I would say yes.\n\nQ: Starting when?\n\nA: The first time I met her and when --\n\nQ: When was that?\n\nA: I don't remember. When she used to live on Gretna Green.\n\nQ: When Nicole lived on Gretna Green?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: First time you met Faye Resnick?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: You don't know what month that is or year?\n\nA: Must be the summer of '93.\n\nQ: So from the summer of '93 --\n\nA: Summer, summer. I don't know about -- June, July, around that time.\n\nQ: From around the summer of 1993 until Nicole's death, you tried to persuade Nicole not to be friends with Faye Resnick?\n\nA: Well, a couple of times I did that. One time was with O.J. I said to Nicole and\n\nO.J., \"I don't trust Faye.\"\n\nAnd Nicole said, \"Oh, come on, Cora, you know, loosen up.\"\n\nQ: Loosen up?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: And at some point did you accept -- come to accept Nicole's friendship with Faye?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: And you would go out with Nicole and Faye. Right?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Okay. So you could have chosen to stay home, but you went with them. Right?\n\nA: I didn't go out a lot -- most -- a lot -- you know, I didn't -- I probably went like couple times, two, three times with them, but I didn't go out every time with them.\n\nQ: You've only been out three times together with Nicole and Faye Resnick?\n\nA: Something like that. Two, three times. I mean --\n\nQ: I don't mean just the three of you alone, but any time you were --\n\nA: Oh, no, no, no. I mean -- you mean with other groups, you mean?\n\nQ: Yes.\n\nA: Well, then more than three times.\n\nQ: How many?\n\nA: I don't know.\n\nQ: Hundreds?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: 20?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: Less than 20?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: 10?\n\nA: Probably. Yes.\n\nQ: So 10 times you were in the same group as Faye, and only three times Nicole, Faye and you were together alone. Is that about right?\n\nA: Just the three of us?\n\nQ: Yes.\n\nMR. KRAMER: You're asking about being out, clubbing or something, out?\n\nMR. PETROCELLI: Anywhere.\n\nTHE WITNESS: No -- I would say yeah, about three times.\n\nBY MR. PETROCELLI:\n\nQ: Okay. Did you ever spend any time alone with Faye Resnick?\n\nA: One time I drove her to the car rental. That's about it. That's the only time I was with her alone.\n\nQ: When was that?\n\nA: I don't remember.\n\nQ: Before Nicole's death?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Did you ever talk to her on the phone?\n\nA: When?\n\nQ: At any time.\n\nA: Yes, of course.\n\nQ: You and Faye Resnick?\n\nA: Yes. She -- yeah.\n\nQ: She would call you?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: And you would converse with her on the phone?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Numerous times. Right?\n\nA: I would say yes.\n\nQ: Now, isn't it true that you had conversations with Faye Resnick about writing a book together after Nicole's death?\n\nA: Not writing a book together, no.\n\nQ: And no discussions with her about collaborating on a book --\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: -- or writing books together?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: Okay. Did you have discussions with Faye that you would be writing a book?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: Have any conversadons at all with Faye Resnick after Nicole's death about writing of books?\n\nA: She told me that she's planning on writing a book, so that was the conversation.\n\nQ: What did you say?\n\nA: What did I say?\n\nQ: (Nods head.)\n\nA: I don't remember.\n\nQ: Okay. Do you know if anything in her book is false?\n\nA: Is false?\n\nQ: Yes.\n\nMR. BAKER: I think she said she skimmed it. You're asking her --\n\nMR. PETROCELLI: Browsed it. Or \"glanced\" is what she said.\n\nTHE WlTNESS: I don't know. The whole thing is she --\n\nMR. KRAMER: The question was: Is there anything that you read in the book that you perceive to be false?\n\nTHE WITNESS: To be false?\n\nBY MR. PETROCELLI:\n\nQ: Untrue.\n\nA: The tone. The tone of that is so untrue, you know.\n\nQ: What tone are you referring to?\n\nA: She has a lot of anger in that book.\n\nQ: Anger about whom.\n\nA: About O.J. and --\n\nQ: What's false about that anger?\n\nA: About how, you know, all this anger that -- the violent anger of O.J. --\n\nQ: You think that's false?\n\nA: Well, to me I never saw it, so...\n\nQ: You know O.J. Simpson has a violent temper. Right?\n\nA: I know that.\n\nQ: You know that to be true. Correct?\n\nA: I have not seen him, though.\n\nQ: You know that to be true, correct, that he has a violent temper?\n\nMR. KRAMER: That calls for a yes or no, if you know.\n\nTHE WITNESS: I don't know. I have not seen him get angry.\n\nBY MR. PETROCELLI:\n\nQ: Have you ever told anyone that O.J. Simpson had a violent temper? Yes or no.\n\nA: Have I said?\n\nQ: Yes.\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Were you lying when you said that?\n\nMR. BAKER: Argumentative.\n\nBY MR. PETROCELLI:\n\nQ: You may answer.\n\nA: Was I lying? I probably was unsure.\n\nQ: You said -- Who did you tell that O.J. Simpson had a violent temper?\n\nA: Nicole told me one time. She said it like, \"Oh, God, it's like -- you know, like typical husband. When they get -- when they scream, they scream, and we get mad at them,\" so...\n\nQ: Who did you tell that O.J. Simpson had a violent temper?\n\nA: Who?\n\nQ: Yeah.\n\nA: I don't remember.\n\nQ: Were you telling the truth when you said that?\n\nA: I probably was -- at that time I was like -- there was a lot of confusion, so, see, it's all hearsay, what Nicole told me.\n\nQ: No, I am not asking you that. I am asking whether you told the truth when you told someone that O.J. Simpson had a violent temper.\n\nWere you telling the truth?\n\nMR. BAKER: Asked and answered.\n\nTHE WITNESS: Was I telling the truth?\n\nBY MR. PETROCELLI:\n\nQ: Yes.\n\nA: If I tell -- if I'm telling the truth if I saw him? I never saw him with a violent temper, though.\n\nQ: You didn't answer my question.\n\nMR. KRAMER: Do you understand the question?\n\nBY MR. PETROCELLI:\n\nQ: You told someone that O.J. Simpson had a violent temper. When you did so, were you telling the truth?\n\nMR. KRAMER: Either you were or you weren't or you don't know.\n\nTHE WITNESS: I don't remember.\n\nMR. PETROCELLI: There is no need to coach the witness.\n\nMR. KRAMER: I have no interest in coaching the witness.\n\nMR. PETROCELLI: The questions are crystal clear.\n\nTHE WITNESS: I don't remember.\n\nBY MR. PETROCELLI:\n\nQ: You don't remember if you were telling the truth?\n\nA: Well, you know, there was a lot of confusion. You know, my girlfriend died. You know, there was just all these things going on. The media was saying, \"What do you think? What do you think?\" I mean --\n\nQ: You were confused about whether O.J. Simpson had a violent temper?\n\nA: Because I never saw that temper, I never saw that violent behavior. Nicole had mentioned to me, she says, \"Oh, Nicole\" -- she says that O.J. can get mad.\n\nI said, \"Oh, the same as Ron,\" so...\n\nQ: Let me tell you this: We are not talking about Ron Fischman now.\n\nMR. BAKER: You are cutting her off.\n\nBY MR. PETROCELLI:\n\nQ: We'll get to Ron Fischman later on. We are talking about O.J. Simpson. Okay?\n\nWhen Nicole told you that O.J. Simpson had a violent temper, do you think she was telling you the truth?\n\nMR. BAKER: Speculation.\n\nTHE WITNESS: At the time I believed her.\n\nBY MR. PETROCELLI:\n\nQ: Did you believe her?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Okay. And did you know of any reason she had to lie to you at that time?\n\nA: There was no reason, no.\n\nQ: You were a dear friend of hers. Right?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: And she of yours. Right?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: In fact, you say that you were her closest friend. Right?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: For a number of years up to the time of her death. Right?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Now, have you learned since Nicole's told you that O.J. Simpson had a violent temper that she was not telling you the truth at that time? Have you learned that statement by her to be false?\n\nA: Have I -- no.\n\nQ: Have you learned of anything to indicate to you that Nicole was lying to you when she told you that O.J. Simpson had a violent temper?\n\nMR. BAKER: I am going to say it mischaracterizes her testimony. I don't recall her saying that Nicole told her that she -- that he had a violent temper.\n\nMR. PETROCELLI: You can try and put as many words in this witness' mouth as you want. You can cross-examine her to your heart's delight when I am concluded with my examination.\n\nQ: You may answer.\n\nMR. KRAMER: Do you have the question in mind?\n\nTHE WlTNESS: No.\n\nMR. KRAMER: Could we have the question back, please?\n\nMR. PETROCELLI: Please read the question.\n\nTHE WITNESS: Could you repeat the question, please?\n\n(Pending question read as follows:\n\n\"Q. Have you learned of anything to indicate to you that Nicole was lying to you when she told you that O.J. Simpson had a violent temper?\")\n\nTHE WITNESS: Nicole was not lying.\n\nBY MR. PETROCELLI:\n\nQ: Okay. And you have not learned anything since Nicole told you that to indicate that she was lying to you at that time. Is that right?\n\nA: Have I learned?\n\nQ: Yes.\n\nA: I don't know how tn answer that.\n\nQ: Have you, since the time Nicole told you that, learned that that statement is not true?\n\nA: Never thought of it.\n\nQ: Have you -- has anyone told you it was false? Have you read anything, have you learned anything, to indicate to you that the statement that Nicole made to you was false? That's all I'm asking you.\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: Thank you. You observed O.J. Simpson and Nicole interacting quite a bit during the course of your relationship with them. Right?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: And you spent many, many hours with Nicole alone. Right?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: And she talked to you often about her feelings towards Mr. Simpson and her relationship with him. Right?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: And you've also had some conversations with O.J. Simpson about his relationship with Nicole and his feelings about her. Right?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: And you've been together with them alone, and you've been together with them in groups of people. Right?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: So you've had as much opportunity as perhaps anyone in the last four years of Nicole's life to observe them interacting. Is that right?\n\nMR. KRAMER: If you know.\n\nMR. BAKER: Speculation.\n\nTHE WITNESS: If -- I'm sorry.\n\nBY MR. PETROCELLI:\n\nQ: You've had as much opportunity as anyone to observe them in the last three or four years of Nicole's life. Right?\n\nA: As much opportunity?\n\nQ: Yeah.\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Now, in your opinion was Mr. Simpson a jealous man when it came to Nicole?\n\nA: I thought he was.\n\nQ: Was he a controlling man when it came to Nicole?\n\nA: Controlling in what way?\n\nQ: Controlling towards Nicole, tried to control her.\n\nA: Nicole said yes, yeah.\n\nQ: And you observed that to be true also. Right?\n\nA: Controlling, I would say yes, at the time.\n\nQ: And Mr. Simpson was, based on your observations, also obsessive, acted obsessively towards Nicole, didn't he?\n\nMR. KRAMER: Do you understand what that means?\n\nTHE WITNESS: Obsessive?\n\nBY MR. PETROCELLI:\n\nQ: Yeah, you know what that means.\n\nBy the way, just so your lawyer doesn't have to interrupt and ask you, if there isn't -- if you don't understand my question, just ask me, and I will be happy to try to explain them to you.\n\nA: What do you mean by \"obsessively\"?\n\nQ: Obsessive, act obsessively towards Nicole.\n\nMR. BAKER: That's not the greatest definition I've ever heard.\n\nMR. PETROCELLI: I don't want to define it.\n\nQ: You --\n\nA: They were both obsessed with each other.\n\nQ: Was O.J. Simpson obsessed with Nicole? Yes or no.\n\nMR. BAKER: If you can answer it with a yes or no.\n\nTHE WITNESS: Obsession, what do you mean by \"obsession\"?\n\nBY MR. PETROCELLI:\n\nQ: Miss Fischman, you just told me they were both obsessed with each other. Correct?\n\nA: Right.\n\nQ: Now I am just asking you: Was O.J. Simpson obsessed with Nicole?\n\nDo you have trouble answering that question?\n\nA: Well, because what Nicole told me -- Nicole told me that O.J. was obsessed with her.\n\nQ: Did you agree with that?\n\nA: See, but at the time I never realy saw him that often, so I never really saw the obsession.\n\nQ: Later on did you see the obsession?\n\nMR. BAKER: You're cutting her off.\n\nTHE WITNESS: No.\n\nBY MR. PETROCELLI:\n\nQ: Never saw any evidence of obsession?\n\nMR. BAKER: Argumentative and asked and answered.\n\nTHE WITNESS: No.\n\nBY MR. PETROCELLI:\n\nQ: And never told anybody that O.J. Simpson was obsessive towards Nicole. Is that right?\n\nA: Well, at the time when Nicole died, I said that there was a problem at the time that they were obsessed with each other.\n\nQ: When you say, \"they were obsessed with each other,\" by that you mean that O.J. Simpson was obsessed with Nicole and Nicole was obsessed with O.J. Simpson. Is that right?\n\nA: It's --\n\nQ: Is that right?\n\nA: I would say right.\n\nQ: Do you think Mr. Simpson killed Nicole?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: Do you think he's innocent?\n\nA: At first I thought he did but then when the evidence came, it just didn't work out. The two didn't match.\n\nQ: What evidence made you conclude Mr. Simpson did not kill Nicole?\n\nA: The evidence were just too enormous. There was just --\n\nMR. KELLY: I'm sorry. I can't hear you, Miss Fischman.\n\nBY MR. PETROCELLI:\n\nQ: The evidence of Mr. Simpson's innocence is just too enormous. Is that what you're saying?\n\nA: Right, yeah.\n\nQ: Okay. So you are not aware of any evidence incriminating Mr. Simpson. Is that what you're saying?\n\nA: What does that mean?\n\nMR. KRAMER: You don't know what it means? Would you rephrase the question?\n\nMR. PETROCELLI: Yes.\n\nQ: Are you aware of any evidence that points towards Mr. Simpson's guilt as the person who killed Nicole?\n\nMR. BAKER: Object to the term \"evidence.\"\n\nMR. PETROCELLI: Well, she understood it very clearly when she said there was enormous evidence of his innocence.\n\nQ: Are you aware of any evidence of his guilt? That's all I'm asking you.\n\nA: That he loved Nicole.\n\nQ: Now, you said there was a time when you thought that he did it.\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: When was that?\n\nA: When all this thing happened, when Nicole just died and everybody was saying O.J. did it, and the media came to me and says, \"When was their last fight?\" It's like the media said O.J. did it. So we all based it from he did it, so --\n\nQ: So you just believed the media. Is that what you're saying?\n\nA: It was a lot of confusion.\n\nMR. BAKER: You have now cut her off three times.\n\nTHE WITNESS: You know what it is? It was my girlfriend died. I was so confused; I was shocked; I didn't know what was going on; the media was after me, and friends were saying, \"He did it.\"\n\nSo we said, \"Okay, if he did it, what did he do? How did he do it?\" So that's how all of us were thinking about that. And then when all the evidences came out, we started saying, \"Wait a minute. It didn't match. What's going on?\"\n\nBY MR. PETROCELLI:\n\nQ: What didn't match? What didn't match?\n\nA: What didn't match?\n\nQ: Yes.\n\nA: The gloves, why was one there and one -- and there was no blood around. If he's the one who did it, why was there no blood around the house. I mean, his carpet is white. Why was there no bloodstain on the carpet around. And the socks, why was there no blood around the socks. If he took a shower, why were there no -- you know.\n\nQ: Why were there no what?\n\nA: No blood in the shower, nothing.\n\nQ: Who were the friends that were saying that O.J. did it?\n\nA: I don't have any friends, so...Who were the friends of who?\n\nQ: You said earlier the friends were saying O.J. did it. Who were those friends?\n\nA: Nicole's friends, I guess.\n\nQ: Who were they?\n\nA: Cici Shahian, Kris Jenner, Faye Resnick.\n\nQ: Who else?\n\nA: Those are the people I know that she hang out with.\n\nQ: And those are the people who told you that O.J. did it. Is that right?\n\nA: Yeah. And they told me that he did it or else they will not talk to me ever again.\n\nQ: What does that mean?\n\nA: There was a thing, says, \"If\" -- \"either you say O.J. did it, we'll group ourselves, and this is what we gonna do.\"\n\nQ: So you're saying that you had a meeting with Cici, Faye and Kris in which they all approached you and said that you were to agree that O.J. did it or else they would never talk to you again. Is that right?\n\nA: It's more like that and --\n\nQ: Is that what you're saying?\n\nA: Pretty much, yes.\n\nQ: Okay. Where did this meeting occur?\n\nA: Not meeting. It was all conversation, and I had a -- I had dinner with --\n\nQ: Dinner with whom?\n\nA: With Cici Shahian and Robin Greer, and that's it, and they told me that I have to support them or else they're going to destroy me.\n\nQ: You said Cici and Robin were there?\n\nA: Yeah.\n\nQ: And did Kris Jenner tell you the same thing?\n\nA: No. Kris Jenner just called me a couple times.\n\nQ: So your statement about Kris Jenner being part of this is false then. Right?\n\nMR. BAKER: Argumentative.\n\nBY MR. PETROCELLI:\n\nQ: Is that what you're now saying?\n\nA: Not part of it's false. She was also there. She was not at the meeting, but she was... I don't know how to answer this.\n\nQ: She was what?\n\nA: I met with her also a couple times, and we talked about it, and they wanted me to talk to the media on Nicole's behalf, and, you know...\n\nQ: Did Kris Jenner tell you that if you didn't say O.J. did it, she would never talk to you again?\n\nA: No, she didn't say that. But the Browns did that, told me. Judy told me.\n\nQ: Judy told you to say that O.J. did it; otherwise she would never talk with you again?\n\nA: No. If I ever talked to O.J., that they would not talk to me ever again.\n\nQ: Okay. That's a different question. Who are the people that told you to say that O.J. Simpson killed Nicole -- for you to say that, and if you didn't say that, they would never talk to you again?\n\nA: Nobody said that to me.\n\nQ: Well, you just told me that there was conversations in which Kris Jenner, Robin Greer and Cici Shahian told you to say that. Are you now saying that that isn't true?\n\nMR. KRAMER: Gather your thoughts --\n\nMR. BAKER: Argumentative, and let her finish her answer. You cut her off every time --\n\nMR. PETROCELLI: I am not cutting her off, Mr. Baker.\n\nMR. BAKER: -- you get an answer that you don't like.\n\nMR. KRAMER: Gather your thoughts, think about your answer and answer the question to the best of your ability. Do you have the question in mind? Do you need a moment?\n\nTHE WITNESS: Would you repeat that question, please?\n\n(Pending question read as follows:\n\nQ: Well, you just told me that there was conversations in which Kris Jenner, Robin Greer and Cici Shahian told you to say that. Are you now saying that that isn't true?\")\n\nTHE WITNESS: No. That's true.\n\nBY MR. PETROCELLI:\n\nQ: So they all told you to say that O.J. killed Nicole, and if you didn't say that, they would not talk to you again. Is --\n\nA: Pretty much, yes.\n\nQ: And the people who said that were Robin Greer, Cici Shahian and Kris Jenner. Is that right?\n\nA: Yes. Faye Resnick.\n\nQ: And Faye Resnick.\n\nA: Judy Brown.\n\nQ: Judy Brown. Anyone else?\n\nA: Those are the people.\n\nQ: And did you agree to go along with that at that time?\n\nA: No. I just didn't want to -- I felt like I should leave it to the justice system. I said, \"I wasn't there. I was a bystander. I mean, I'm not a witness. Nicole didn't call me and said, you know, `O.J. just killed me.'\" I mean, we were all shocked. We were -- we didn't know.\n\nQ: Did you ever tell anybody that you thought O.J. killed Nicole?\n\nA: Yeah, of course. It entered my mind.\n\nQ: What do you mean, \"of course\"?\n\nA: It entered my mind.\n\nQ: Why did you say \"of course\"?\n\nA: Because at the time there was just a lot of things going on. I mean, they had -- they had -- they were trying to reconcile, and Nicole was doing a lot of things, too, on the -- you know, I mean, she I wanted to go back, she didn't want to go back, and then, you know -- and then at some point -- there was a lot of confusion between the two.\n\nO.J. said, \"I feel like a battered husband.\"\n\nAnd then Nicole says, \"I don't know if I should move back. I should\" -- you know, so, yeah. So when Nicole died, the first thing is, oh, my God, what happened here?\n\nQ: The first thing that crossed your mind is that O.J. did it. Right?\n\nA: Exactly.\n\nQ: Did you ask O.J. if he did it?\n\nA: No. He didn't --\n\nQ: You didn't ask him?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: When did you first see him after Nicole's death?\n\nA: When he got out of prison.\n\nQ: When did you --\n\nA: The week after the verdict.\n\nQ: Well, you saw him at the wake, didn't you?\n\nA: Oh, yeah, yeah. I'm sorry. Yeah, you're right.\n\nQ: And you saw him at the funeral. Right?\n\nA: Yeah, right. I'm sorry. Yeah, that's true.\n\nQ: You talked to him on the telephone also, didn't you?\n\nA: When he was in jail, yeah, he called a couple times.\n\nQ: Now, when you saw him at the wake and the funeral, didn't you go up to him and say, \"Why did you do this?\"\n\nA: No, that's true -- that's not true. I'm sorry. I was hysterical --\n\nMR. KRAMER: There is no question pending.\n\nBY MR. PETROCELLI:\n\nQ: You were hysterical? You may complete your thought. Go ahead.\n\nA: I was hysterical; I couldn't believe that Nicole was there, and I went to him and I started pounding his chest, and I said, \"Who did this to my friend? What happened?\"\n\nAnd I was pounding his chest, and I was like really angry. I said, \"What happened? What happened here? You know, all she wanted to do was take care of Sydney and Justin.\"\n\nAnd then he said, \"I just\" -- \"I love her. I love her so much, Cora,\" and that was it, and then we were like -- I was...\n\nQ: You deny asking him at that time if he killed Nicole or if he did this or if he was responsible for her death? You deny that?\n\nA: Denied what?\n\nQ: Deny asking him that at that time.\n\nA: If he -- I didn't even ask him. I was like --\n\nMR. KRAMER: So the answer is yes, you deny asking him.\n\nBY MR. PETROCELLI:\n\nQ: You deny asking him. Right?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: You have a very clear memory of what you said to him even though you were hysterical. Is that right?\n\nMR. BAKER: Argumentative. She's answered this question.\n\nTHE WITNESS: I said those, yeah.\n\nBY MR. PETROCELLI:\n\nQ: You said what?\n\nA: I said -- those are the words I said, you know, \"What happened? What happened here?\"\n\nQ: Did he say to you, \"I loved her too much\"? Did he say that to you?\n\nA: \"I loved her so much.\"\n\nQ: \"So much.\" Not \"too much.\" You distinctly recall that. Is that right?\n\nA: That I don't remember, what -- you know, I was crying hysterically.\n\nQ: So you don't remember.\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: So he could have said to you, \"I loved her too much\" --\n\nMR. BAKER: Argumentative.\n\nBY MR. PETROCELLI:\n\nQ: -- rather than \"so much.\" Is that right?\n\nMR. BAKER: Asked and answered.\n\nTHE WITNESS: I don't remember.\n\nBY MR. PETROCELLI:\n\nQ: You don't recall?\n\nA: That -- see, you know, I was crying, I was hysterical --\n\nMR. KRAMER: Cora, you remember the distinction, or you don't? That's the question.\n\nTHE WITNESS: I don't remember the distinction.\n\nBY MR. PETROCELLI:\n\nQ: So it could have been either one. Right?\n\nA: It could have been either one.\n\nQ: Okay. At anytime did you ever ask Mr. Simpson whether he killed Nicole, your dear friend?\n\nA: If I asked him? No.\n\nQ: Now, you never asked him. Right?\n\nA: I never asked him.\n\nQ: Up until this day. Is that right?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Okay. Now, you said O.J. Simpson entered your mind as the person who might have killed Nicole when you first heard of her death.\n\nDid any other person enter your mind?\n\nMR. KRAMER: At the time?\n\nMR. PETROCELLI: Yes.\n\nTHE WITNESS: At that time, yes --\n\nBY MR. PETROCELLI:\n\nQ: Who?\n\nA: -- because, see, Faye Resnick -- see, Faye Resnick was running out of money; she didn't have a home, and they were doing a lot of -- they were doing cocaine and they were doing -- they were soliciting men, and so they were out almost every night, and so I said, \"Oh, my God, somebody could have done\" -- you know.\n\nQ: I take it, then, that you were with Nicole and Faye when they were doing cocaine. Is that right?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: And I take it you were with Nicole and Faye when they were soliciting men. Is that right?\n\nA: I was not with them.\n\nQ: I see. So you have no firsthand knowledge of any of that. Is that right? Yes or no.\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: You have no firsthand knowledge that Nicole Brown Simpson was doing cocaine at the end --\n\nA: Faye told me.\n\nQ: -- of her life. You have no firsthand knowledge. You didn't see it. Is that right?\n\nA: I didn't see it.\n\nQ: And you didn't see her soliciting men. Is that right?\n\nMR. BAKER: Stop arguing with the witness and pointing at her.\n\nTHE WITNESS: I didn't see them, but --\n\nMR. KRAMER: You didn't see them.\n\nBY MR. PETROCELLI:\n\nQ: You didn't see them.\n\nA: I didn't see them.\n\nQ: You didn't --\n\nA: I didn't know.\n\nQ: Any man ever come up to you and say that \"Nicole Brown Simpson solicited me\"?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Who?\n\nA: [Name Deleted]\n\nQ: When did [Name Deleted] tell you that?\n\nA: When I saw him at Starbucks coffee with his friend.\n\nQ: After Nicole's death?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: And what did [Name Deleted] tell you?\n\nA: Well, we were consoling, and he said to me nice things about Nicole.\n\nQ: Excuse me. I can't concentrate because Mr. Simpson is talking to Mr. Kelly.\n\nA: And they -- and he told me that \"I wanted to tell you something about Nicole.\"\n\nI said, \"Well\" -- then he told me that they went out to dinner, and Nicole asked them if they do threesome.\n\nQ: Nicole and [Name Deleted] went out to dinner?\n\nA: And Ron Goldman. Ron Goldman, [Name Deleted] and Nicole. That was their first -- they went out to dinner.\n\nQ: This is being related to you by [Name Deleted]. Is that right?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: And this is sometime after Nicole's death. Right?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: When was this?\n\nA: Must be a week, during that week.\n\nQ: Okay. And where did you and [Name Deleted] --\n\nA: Saw --\n\nQ: -- go? Starbucks, did you say?\n\nA: We didn't go. I saw him at Starbucks coffee.\n\nQ: Just ran into him?\n\nA: Yes, I ran into him.\n\nQ: Middle of the day?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: And he just told this to you?\n\nA: Well, he gave me a hug because he knew.\n\nQ: And said, \"Oh, by the way, did you know that Nicole was soliciting men?\" Is that what you told --\n\nA: No.\n\nMR. BAKER: Argumentative.\n\nTHE WITNESS: He didn't say it quite that way.\n\nHe just gave me a hug and he said, \"You know, I'm sorry for what happened.\"\n\nAnd I said, you know -- and he said nice things about Nicole, and I said -- so he asked me about Faye Resnick. I said, \"Yeah, you know, and\" --\n\nBY MR. PETROCELLI:\n\nQ: What did he ask you about Faye Resnick?\n\nA: He said, \"Who is Faye Resnick?\" I said, \"Well, you know, it's Nicole and\" --\n\nQ: What did you say to him?\n\nA: I said, \"This is Nicole's friend.\"\n\nQ: Okay. Continue.\n\nA: And --\n\nMR. BAKER: Continue with her answer?\n\nMR. PETROCELLI: Yes.\n\nMR. BAKER: So you interrupted her.\n\nTHE WITNESS: And he told me that they went out to dinner, and Nicole got a little drunk and started asking about that question, and he says, \"It's not that I want to shock you.\"\n\nI said, \"Well, I know that already. She told me,\" and that was it. So, you know...\n\nBY MR. PETROCELLI:\n\nQ: So that's the extent of the conversation with you and [Name Deleted]?\n\nA: That was pretty much, you know. And then we still talk about, you know -- that's pretty much the basic.\n\nQ: What did [Name Deleted] say in response to Nicole's solicitation?\n\nA: He was embarrassed.\n\nQ: What did he tell you that he said?\n\nA: She [sic] said, \"Have you guys done\" -- \"have you guys done it with another woman?\"\n\nAnd [Name Deleted] said they were embarrassed when Nicole asked that question, and he says, \"With whom?\" [Name Deleted] said, \"With whom?\" He says, \"With Cora?\"\n\nAnd then Nicole said, \"No, not with Cora. With Faye Resnick,\" and that's why [Name Deleted] asked me who Faye Resnick is.\n\nAnd then -- so when I described to him Faye Resnick, he says, \"No, no, no,\" he says, \"Cora doesn't do those things,\" and --\n\nTHE REP0RTER: I'm sorry. I can't hear the \"he says\" or \"she says.\" You're dropping your voice.\n\n(Record read.)\n\nTHE WITNESS: No. When [Name Deleted] said, \"With Cora?\" because -- you know, because Nicole and I go to Starbucks coffee a lot after our run, and Nicole said, \"No, Cora doesn't do those things. With Faye Resnick.\" And so that was it, you know.\n\nBY MR. PETROCELLI:\n\nQ: So did Keller tell you whether they went through with this?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: Did --\n\nA: Then Nicole apologized to them. She said, \"Oh, I'm sorry,\" you know, \"I'm embarrassed. I'm embarrassing myself. I'm sorry,\" and that was it.\n\nQ: Did Keller tell you whether Nicole's comments were directed to him or to Ron Goldman?\n\nA: That I don't know. He didn't specify that. It was pretty much, you know, the three of them having conversation.\n\nQ: And you said you had already heard that from Nicole before she died. Right?\n\nA: Yes, she told me.\n\nQ: How many times?\n\nMR. KRAMER: You are asking how many times did this topic come up?\n\nMR. PETROCELLI: Yes.\n\nTHE WITNESS: I don't remember. Once, twice.\n\nBY MR. PETROCELLI:\n\nQ: Just relate the conversations to me.\n\nA: Nicole told me that she did -- she did it with Faye and another guy, and Faye told me after Nicole died, because I wanted answers, I wanted to know if that really happened, and Faye confirmed it.\n\nQ: Confirmed it?\n\nA: Well, she told me. She told me the same thing what Nicole told me.\n\nQ: Okay. When did Nicole tell you this? Give me a date.\n\nA: I would say around April, late April.\n\nQ: '94?\n\nA: '94.\n\nQ: Where were you and Nicole when you had this conversation?\n\nA: Starbucks.\n\nQ: Just the two of you?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: And was this after her trip to Cabo?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Was Mr. Simpson in Puerto Rico at the time?\n\nA: Yes. No. They all went to Cabo, and then -- they all went to Cabo, and then he -- I think he went home -- I don't know. I think he went -- probably he went to Puerto Rico at the time.\n\nQ: Mr. Simpson?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: And filmed FROGMAN. Right?\n\nA: Yes. Yes.\n\nQ: And Nicole came back to Los Angeles. Right?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: And she had a conversation with you at Starbucks in which she related to you that she and Faye Resnick had had sex with another man. Is that right?\n\nA: That was later, that time. It wasn't right away when they got back from Cabo.\n\nQ: Couple weeks later?\n\nA: Yeah.\n\nQ: And did she indicate that this incident occurred in Cabo or in Los Angeles?\n\nA: That I don't know, but she told me that they met a guy in Cabo.\n\nQ: And was this the guy that was involved in the incident?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: And did this incident -- What's that guy's name?\n\nA: Guy's name is Brett.\n\nQ: What's Brett's last name?\n\nA: That I don't know.\n\nQ: Have you ever seen Brett?\n\nA: No, never met him.\n\nQ: Have you ever talked to Brett?\n\nA: Never.\n\nQ: And Nicole identified Brett by name?\n\nA: Uh-huh, yes.\n\nQ: Did Faye also?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Is that the extent of the conversation that you had with Nicole about Brett?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: And you said Nicole mentioned this topic again to you on another occasion?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: And describe that to me.\n\nA: This must be a week after -- I don't remember, but she kinda mentioned it in passing that, \"Don't get mad at me, but I\" -- \"Faye and I did it.\"\n\nQ: Did what?\n\nA: That's exactly what she told me. Did what. They did it. And then she started to giggle.\n\nQ: You mean that Faye -- she told you that Faye Resnick and she had sex with another man?\n\nA: Well, she told me that \"Faye and I did it,\" so that's as far as I --\n\nQ: What did you understand that to mean?\n\nA: That the two of them had an affair together.\n\nQ: Alone? Or with another man?\n\nA: Alone and with another man. Well, she said they did it, and says, \"Don't get mad at me.\"\n\nI said, \"I'm not going to get mad at you.\"\n\nQ: Wait a second. You said, \"Alone and with another man.\"\n\nA: Well, later on she told me that they did it with a man. So they did it before, and then they did it with another man.\n\nQ: And she told you this in the second conversation that you had with her. You already told me about the first time.\n\nA: Yes. Yes.\n\nQ: Now, when she said, \"Don't get mad,\" had you previously expressed your disapproval to her when she related the incident the first time?\n\nA: Well, because she knew me --\n\nMR. KRAMER: It's a yes or a no.\n\nTHE WITNESS: What -- I'm sorry.\n\nMR. KRAMER: Did you express your disapproval to her when she told you the first time, was the question?\n\nTHE WITNESS: No.\n\nBY MR. PETROCELLI:\n\nQ: What did you say when she told you about the incident?\n\nA: What did --\n\nQ: First time.\n\nA: What did who?\n\nQ: What did you say to Nicole?\n\nA: I said \"Nicole,\" and then that's it.\n\nQ: You said \"Nicole\" and didn't say anything more?\n\nA: I just say, \"Be careful.\"\n\nQ: \"Be careful\"? About what?\n\nMR. KRAMER: Are you asking her what did she say or what did she think?\n\nBY MR. PETROCELLI:\n\nQ: Yeah, what did you say?\n\nA: That's what I said: \"Nicole be careful.\"\n\nQ: What did you have in mind?\n\nA: I had in mind was she was doing something that wasn't right.\n\nQ: You mean morally right?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Okay. Now, when she told you the second time, what did you say to her then?\n\nA: I don't remember.\n\nQ: Now, when you had a conversation with Resnick after Nicole's death, did you ask Resnick about these two incidents that Nicole related to you?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: And she confirmed them both?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: And what did you say to Resnick at that time?\n\nA: At that time she was -- actually she was shocked when I told her, and she said, \"Yeah, I thought\" -- \"Nicole told me,\" I said, \"that you two had an affair, and she told me not to tell you or else you're gonna kill her,\" because Nicole used to say that, \"Oh, don't tell Faye. Faye's gonna kill me if you tell her that I told you about this.\"\n\nQ: Okay. By the way, do you think Faye Resnick killed Nicole?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: You don't think that that statement had anything to do with Nicole's death?\n\nA: Well, Nicole used that word \"kill\" a lot, you know, as a figure of speech, so I really didn't have -- to me it was like I was saying I killed somebody, you know, \"My dad's gonna kill me if I do something wrong,\" you know, or --\n\nQ: I see. So when she said to you that O.J. was going to kill her, you took that as just a figure of speech and not seriously. Is that what you're trying to say?\n\nA: Hearing from her most -- yeah, right. Like, \"Judy's gonna kill me if she finds out I'm smoking. Don't tell my mom,\" you know.\n\nQ: And she used that figure of speech in relation to O.J. Simpson, too, from time to time. Is that right?\n\nA: I never paid attention. To me it was like I saw her every day, so --\n\nQ: My question to you is: She said to you from time to time, \"O.J.'s going to kill me.\" Is that true?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: And when she said that to you, you attached no significance to it?\n\nA: I never did, yeah.\n\nQ: You thought she didn't really mean what she was saying. Right?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: Is that right?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: And the reason you thought that is because she used this figure of speech all the time. Right?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: And she said that Judy was going to kill her. Right?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: And Faye was going to kill her. Right?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: And how many other people were going to kill her? What other people did she include in that when she used that figure of speech?\n\nA: Well, pretty much -- you know it's sort of like you don't pay attention to it, you know.\n\nQ: Can you remember any other names, Miss Fischman?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: Okay. You knew that Faye Resnick was in a treatment center at the night of Nicole's death. Right?\n\nMR. BAKER: Does she know that now?\n\nTHE WITNESS: I didn't know at that time.\n\nBY MR. PETROCELLI:\n\nQ: You know that now. Right?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Okay. Who told you about Nicole's use of cocaine?\n\nA: Faye told me.\n\nQ: Before or after Nicole's death?\n\nA: After Nicole's death.\n\nQ: So before Nicole's death you had no knowledge whatsoever of her using cocaine in the last months of her life. Is that right?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Okay. And after Nicole's death Faye told you exactly what in that regard?\n\nA: That they were doing cocaine.\n\nQ: On what days?\n\nA: What days?\n\nQ: Yeah.\n\nA: She didn't specify.\n\nQ: So you had no idea from your conversation with Faye Resnick whether it was once or a hundred times. Right? Is that a fair statement?\n\nA: She said that they were free-basing, so I don't know what that means.\n\nQ: But you don't know how often. Correct?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: And you don't know what quantities either. Correct?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: That's correct. Right?\n\nA: Yes, correct, I don't know what quantities.\n\nQ: And you don't know where the cocaine was obtained from. Correct?\n\nA: Yes, correct.\n\nQ: Okay. So other than Faye Resnick saying to you after Nicole's death that she and Nicole had been free-basing, you don't have any information whatsoever on Nicole's drug use prior to her death. Is that right?\n\nA: She said that when -- they were doing it when Nicole used to live on Gretna Green.\n\nQ: I am talking about the last couple of months.\n\nA: Oh.\n\nQ: You are also covering up your mouth with your hand, and it's hard to hear you.\n\nA: Oh, sorry.\n\nMR. KRAMER: Is there a question pending?\n\nMR. PETROCELLI: The answer is no.\n\n(Question read as follows:\n\n\"Q. Okay. So other than Faye Resnick saying to you after Nicole's death that she and Nicole had been free-basing, you don't have any information whatsoever on Nicole's drug use prior to her death. Is that right?\")\n\nTHE WlTNESS: Prior to her death, yes, right.\n\nBY MR. PETROCELLI:\n\nQ: And in fact you don't even know when Faye Resnick and Nicole were allegedly free-basing. Correct?\n\nA: I don't know when?\n\nQ: Correct. You don't know when. Right?\n\nA: Correct.\n\nQ: Faye didn't tell you when they did that. Right?\n\nA: Correct.\n\nQ: Okay. Have you learned from any other person besides Faye Resnick of any drug use by Nicole in the two months or three months before her death?\n\nA: Have I learned from?\n\nQ: (Nods head.)\n\nA: No. No.\n\nQ: And have you learned from any source other than Nicole and Faye any further information about her soliciting other men to have sex in the last few months of her life?\n\nMR. BAKER: Other than what she's testified to?\n\nMR. PETROCELLI: Yeah.\n\nTHE WITNESS: I'm sorry. Have I what?\n\nBY MR. PETROCELLI:\n\nQ: Have you learned any other information on the topic of Nicole soliciting sex with men in the last few months of her life, other than what you've already told us?\n\nA: No. That's --\n\nQ: So have you now told us everything that you have heard or came to know on the topic of Nicole's drug use and Nicole's solicitation of men in the months leading up to her death?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Okay.\n\nMR. KELLY: Why don't we take a break.\n\nMR. PETROCELLI: One second.\n\nMR. KELLY: Okay.\n\nBY MR. PETROCELLI:\n\nQ: Now let me get back to my -- to something you said earlier. We started out this line when I asked you whether anybody else entered your mind --\n\nA: Uh-huh.\n\nQ: -- in terms of who may have killed Nicole, and then you started talking about Faye Resnick and these topics. Okay?\n\nWas there a person who came to mind besides O.J. Simpson who you thought might have killed Nicole?\n\nA: Well, I thought it could be, because they were going out a lot, could be men they met when they went out, and because when Faye told me they were doing drugs. Again, I don't know whether this is public record}, and she didn't have any money, so I thought, okay, somebody could have been -- you know, could be drugs.\n\nQ: Did any names come to mind?\n\nA: No, no names.\n\nQ: Okay. So you knew of no other person. Correct?\n\nMR. BAKER: Other than --\n\nBY MR. PETROCELLI:\n\nQ: Other than O.J. Simpson, who came into your mind as a person who might have killed Nicole. Is that right?\n\nA: No. No.\n\nQ: Correct?\n\nA: Correct.\n\nQ: Okay. And I take it that you immediately communicated this information about Nicole's drug use and solicitation to the police so that they could track down possible people responsible for her death. Right?\n\nA: I -- yes. I told that to Marcia Clark.\n\nQ: When did you tell that to Marcia Clark?\n\nA: When she asked me.\n\nQ: Well, did you immediately pick up the phone and --\n\nA: Oh, no, no, no, no, no.\n\nQ: -- go to the police to tell them this information?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: Well, you knew that O.J. Simpson was being charged with these crimes. Right?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: You saw it on television. Right?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: In fact you were interviewed on 6-14, June 14th, 1994, by Officers LeFall and Luper. Correct?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: And you didn't tell them about -- any information about this drug or this solicitation information. Correct?\n\nA: I don't remember.\n\nQ: You didn't tell them that. Is that right?\n\nMR. BAKER: She just answered your question.\n\nTHE WITNESS: I don't remember. I probably did. I probably did not. I mean --\n\nBY MR. PETROCELLI:\n\nQ: You probably did. You probably did not. What does that mean?\n\nA: I said I don't remember.\n\nQ: Did you tell them? Yes or no.\n\nMR. KRAMER: She has answered the question.\n\nTHE WITNESS: I said I don't remember.\n\nMR. KRAMER: If you want to try to refresh her recollection, that's fine. She doesn't remember.\n\nBY MR. PETROCELLI:\n\nQ: Okay. Did you tell Officer -- excuse me -- Detective Payne on June 24 about the drug use and the solicitation?\n\nA: You know, I don't even know what questions they asked me. I probably did.\n\nQ: So if they didn't ask you, you wouldn't have told them. Fair statement?\n\nMR. BAKER: Argumentative.\n\nBY MR. PETROCELLI:\n\nQ: Is that a fair statement? If they didn't ask you, you wouldn't have told them.\n\nA: They didn't ask me, so why would I give information.\n\nQ: So you didn't tell them. Is that right?\n\nMR. BAKER: If she recalls.\n\nBY MR. PETROCELLI:\n\nQ: You said to me, \"They didn't ask me\" --\n\nA: I don't remember. I mean --\n\nQ: -- \"so why would I give them the information.\"\n\nSo if they didn't ask you, you didn't give them the information. That's all I'm trying to find out. Is that --\n\nA: You know, when my girlfriend died, I didn't even know what was going on. There was a lot of confusion here.\n\nQ: I am not asking about your confusion. I am asking whether you told the police this important information that you've related to us in this deposition.\n\nMR. BAKER: And you've asked her that six times.\n\nBY MR. PETROCELLI:\n\nQ: You may answer.\n\nA: I don't remember.\n\nQ: Okay. If they didn't ask you about this specifically, is it your testimony --\n\nA: I probably did not.\n\nQ: Okay.

PETROCELLI:\n\nQ: And why were you telling this to the publisher of her book?\n\nA: Because I wanted to make a statement about the book.
