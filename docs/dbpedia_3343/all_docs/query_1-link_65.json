        "text": "Flashback to many years ago, my journey as an SME in Lifting Operations at Chevron. As an SME, I ensure that Lifting Management Systems are implemented well within Chevron organizations and contractors. How do I know that our contractors and organizations comply with regulations? Yes, by conducting regular audits and ensuring that we comply. This picture shows me auditing one of our contractors and ensuring they complied with Chevron Company Roles. It is part of the Lifting Management System that I created for Chevron. So, what is the difference between audits and inspections? Why audit is important? #fdpconsultant #liftingmanagementsystems #offshore\n\nTurnaround season is just around the corner. To help you get ready, here are six tasks crucial to #turnaround success: 1. Great #Planning and Scheduling: Develop a comprehensive plan outlining all tasks, resources, and timelines. Collaborate across departments to gather information and ensure everything is considered. Create detailed schedules, identifying critical paths and potential bottlenecks. Then regularly review and update the plan to adapt to any changes or unforeseen circumstances. 2. Resource Allocation and Mobilization: Be sure to allocate resources efficiently, considering manpower, equipment, materials, and external contractors. Secure all necessary resources well in advance to prevent delays or shortages during the turnaround. Coordinate procurement and logistics to streamline the delivery of materials and equipment to the site. 3. Safety and Risk Management: Prioritize #safety throughout the turnaround process to protect personnel, assets, and the environment. Conduct thorough risk assessments and implement control measures to mitigate hazards. Provide comprehensive training for all personnel involved in the turnaround, emphasizing safety protocols and procedures. And establish a robust #safetyculture. 4. Quality Assurance and Control: Implement stringent #quality assurance measures to ensure all work meets regulatory standards and industry best practices. Establish quality control checkpoints at key stages, inspecting workmanship and verifying compliance with specifications. Conduct regular audits and inspections and address any deviations or deficiencies promptly. 5. Communication and Coordination: Foster effective communication and collaboration among all stakeholders throughout the turnaround process. Establish lines of communication and designate key personnel responsible for disseminating information and addressing concerns. Hold regular meetings to provide updates, address issues, and solicit feedback from all parties involved. 6. Contingency Planning and Risk Mitigation: Anticipate potential challenges and develop contingency plans to mitigate risks and minimize disruptions to the turnaround schedule. Identify critical pathways and bottlenecks, developing alternative strategies to address delays or unforeseen circumstances. Keep flexibility in the schedule to accommodate unexpected events while striving to minimize their impact on overall timelines. By prioritizing these tasks and executing them meticulously, #petrochemical plant #operators can enhance the likelihood of a successful turnaround while optimizing budget and schedule adherence. While most of this may seem obvious our experience indicates that often the most common tasks get overlooked or ignored. Want a great turnaround experience?

But here's the not-so-secret secret: even the most meticulously planned project can go off the rails if procurement isn't governed properly. Strong governance is like a high-tech blowout preventer (BOP) for your procurement process – it ensures everything stays safe, efficient, and compliant. Governance: The Secret Weapon of Procurement Think of governance as a set of clear rules and guidelines that keep the procurement process on track. Here's why it matters in a big way for us in the technical world: Stops Cost Overruns in Their Tracks: Transparent bidding processes with clear vendor qualification criteria ensure you're not paying inflated prices for subpar equipment or services. Minimizes Delays and Disruptions: Proper vendor vetting and well-defined contracts reduce the risk of late deliveries, incompatible equipment, or unexpected quality issues that can stall your project. Mitigates Reputational Risk: Sticking to ethical sourcing practices and adhering to regulations protects your company's good name and avoids costly fines. Empowers Informed Decision-Making: Clear documentation and approval processes ensure everyone involved (from engineers to managers) has a complete picture before signing off on major purchases. Techies, We're Part of the Solution! Strong procurement governance isn't just the domain of procurement specialists. Here's how we, the technical brains of the operation, can contribute: Crystal-Clear Specifications: Clearly define technical requirements in Requests for Proposals (RFPs) so vendors understand exactly what equipment or services are needed. Technical Expertise During Evaluations: Use your deep technical knowledge to assess proposals and identify the solutions that best fit the project's specific needs. Proactive Risk Identification: Flag any potential technical feasibility or compatibility issues early on to avoid surprises and delays later. By working together under a strong governance framework, engineers and procurement specialists can ensure efficient, cost-effective, and compliant well construction. Let's drill for success, together, not procurement disasters! #drillingengineer #procurement #governance #oilandgas #wellconstruction\n\nAre you missing out by not running multi-stage RFQ's? What is a multi-stage RFQ? Think of it as different bid rounds where there is an option to allow the suppliers to see their ranking based on the bid from the previous round. Here's my real life experience of being involved in this process. At a previous employer we were bidding to a tier 1 Oil & Gas operator. They decided to run a 3 stage RFQ process over the space of a week. > Monday we logged in - in first place. We didn't bid. > Wednesday, 2nd bid round - still in first place. We hold our nerve. > Friday, 3rd and final bid round - still in first place. At this point we are desperate to win the contract and are anxious that we're going to be pipped to the post with a last day bid. We reduce our price further. We end up winning the business. We'd have still won if we hadn't reduced our price. The technology was instrumental in getting us as a suppler to bid lower. We were not forced to. It probably took the procurement person 15 minutes to set the whole thing up. Lesson: Technology is there to supplement your process, not replace it! #esourcing #procurement\n\nThe offshore oil and gas industry is a high-stakes field requiring rigorous training and certification to ensure safety, efficiency, and regulatory compliance.
