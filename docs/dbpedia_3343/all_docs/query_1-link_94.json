        "text": "It's one of the worlds's most known automobiles: The iconic 1993 white Ford Bronco — made famous by the infamous O.J. Simpson — and it could be hitting the auction block very soon.\n\nOnce up for grabs, O.J. Simpson's Ford Bronco could fetch as much as $1.5 million.\n\nAlthough the white Ford Bronco that could be hitting the auction block was technically owned by Simpson's friend and getaway driver that day in 1994, former NFL star Al Cowlings, it's remembered as Simpson's ride.\n\nWhere Is O.J. Simpson's Ford Bronco?\n\nIt’s got less than 40,000 miles on the odometer and its biggest selling point is that its previous owner was a retired NFL star who only drove it around town for light errands — and one epic freeway police chase.\n\nIt's currently on loan to the Alcatraz East Crime Museum in Tennessee, but its owners are thinking about selling, and they're hoping to get at least $1.5 million for it.\n\nThey've actually had offers of up to $750,000 in the past, but now that there's renewed interest in O.J. after his death, they're hopeful they can jack up the price and have it pay off.\n\nThe Bronco's current owners say the plan was always to sell this year, because it's the 30th anniversary of the chase. Simpson's death on April 10 is just a coincidence — and possibly a lucrative one.\n\nThe Ford Bronco was a mainstay SUV in America from 1966 to 1996. It's been making a comeback as of late — even country artists love the Bronco.\n\nCarly Pearce got to spend some time with a newer Ford Bronco on her Country Music Made Me Do It Tour.\n\nJake Owen is also the proud owner of a retro-fitted Bronco:\n\nWill someone dole out a cool $1.5 mil on the legendary white Ford Bronco? The sports legend was in the backseat of the Bronco, holding a gun to his own head while being chased by police in 1994 on double homicide charges."
