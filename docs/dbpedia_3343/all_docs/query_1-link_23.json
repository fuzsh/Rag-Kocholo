        "text": "Updated with new photos: It was a long, pandemic-impacted broadcast development cycle, with some pilots taking a year to get produced, but the broadcast networks have made their picks for new scripted series to debut in fall 2021 as well as the bulk of their decisions for new midseason 2022 shows.\n\nThe pandemic forced broadcast executives to think outside the traditional broadcast pilot model and rely more heavily on straight-to-series orders, often based on additional scripts, sometimes delivered through the opening of a writers room.\n\nCheck out Deadlineâs gallery of new 2021-22 shows. Those picked up straight-to-series that have not produced a pilot and have no episodic art available, are represented by their top talent on or behind the camera.\n\nClick on the photo above to launch the gallery. You can find details on each of the new series below.\n\nDrama\n\nQueens\n\nStudio: ABC Signature\n\nTeam: Zahir McGhee, Sabrina Wind (ep), Tim Story\n\nLogline: Estranged and out of touch, four women in their 40s reunite for a chance to recapture their fame and regain the swagger they had as the Nasty Bitches â their â90s group that made them legends in the hip-hop world.\n\nCast: Eve, Naturi Naughton, Brandy, Nadine Velazquez, Pepi Sonuga\n\nComedy\n\nThe Wonder Years\n\nStudio: 20th Television\n\nTeam: Saladin Patterson, Fred Savage, Lee Daniels (ep), Marc Velez (ep)\n\nLogline: How a black middle-class family in Montgomery, Al, in the turbulent late 1960s made sure it was the Wonder Years for them too.
