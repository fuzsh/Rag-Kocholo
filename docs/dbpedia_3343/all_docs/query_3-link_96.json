        "text": "The Indianapolis Colts have nearly three weeks of training camp practices under their belt and have their first preseason game taking place later this week.\n\nWith several practices, three preseason games, and two joint practices, there is still a lot that can change from an evaluation standpoint when it comes to both playing time and roster spots. However, over these past few weeks, we’ve also gained some insight into where some of the key positional battles stand as well.\n\nRunning back Trey Sermon seems to have a firm grasp on the backup role. Jaylon Jones continues to get steady playing time at cornerback over Dallis Flowers. While Alec Pierce seems to have an early leg up over AD Mitchell–although both will be factors on offense this season.\n\nOn the flip side, there are some positional battles where there isn’t a ton of clarity either, particularly at free safety, where no one has emerged above the rest for that starting spot. How things are going to shake out at tight end, both from a playing time and a roster construction perspective remain unknown as well.\n\nGiven the information that we’ve been able to accumulate through eight training camp practices, here is my latest roster projection prior to the Colts’ first preseason game, along with some thoughts on my decisions when needed.\n\nQB: Anthony Richardson\n\nQB: Joe Flacco\n\nI decided to only roster two quarterbacks. Ultimately I believe that roster spot can be better utilized elsewhere. Sam Ehlinger is also in the final year of his rookie deal and Kedon Slovis can be put on the practice squad.\n\nRB: Jonathan Taylor\n\nRB: Trey Sermon\n\nRB: Evan Hull\n\nI went with Hull over Tyler Goodson in large part because of his upside as a second-year player who the Colts used a fifth-round pick on last season. With his ability as a pass catcher, he could perhaps carve out a niche role in the passing game.\n\nWR: Michael Pittman\n\nWR: Josh Downs\n\nWR: AD Mitchell\n\nWR: Alec Pierce\n\nWR: Anthony Gould\n\nWR: Ashton Dulin\n\nThe big question for me at receiver is whether the Colts will roster six of them. Last season, almost 96 percent of the offensive snaps came with three or fewer receivers on the field, according to Sumer Sports. However, Dulin has been a core special teams contributor and someone who can be relied upon on offense if in a pinch.\n\nTE: Kylen Granson\n\nTE: Mo Alie-Cox\n\nTE: Jelani Woods\n\nTE: Will Mallory\n\nTE: Drew Ogletree\n\nNumbers-wise I found a way to keep five tight ends. This ultimately may not be what the Colts do, but it’s been hard to glean during training camp where things stand with this position group. The Colts don’t have a No. 1 option in this group, but they have a variety of skill sets where each of these players could have a defined role from week-to-week depending on the opponent.\n\nOL: Bernhard Raimann\n\nOL: Quenton Nelson\n\nOL: Ryan Kelly\n\nOL: Will Fries\n\nOL: Braden Smith\n\nOL: Matt Goncalves\n\nOL: Blake Freeland\n\nOL: Tanor Bortolini\n\nOL: Wesley French\n\nIf the Colts go light elsewhere, like at tight end for example, they could go heavy and potentially roster 10 offensive linemen. However, I was only able to keep nine. For me, eight of these spots are accounted for, so it came down to French or Danny Pinter, both of whom can play all three interior positions–an important factor. French is going into his third season and played 270 snaps in 2023.\n\nDE: Kwity Paye\n\nDE: Laiatu Latu\n\nDE: Tyquan Lewis\n\nDE: Dayo Odeyingbo\n\nBefore Samson Ebukam’s injury, the Colts were probably keeping five defensive ends. But for now, I’ll stick with four unless someone else emerges over the coming weeks.\n\nDT: DeForest Buckner\n\nDT: Grover Stewart\n\nDT: Raekwon Davis\n\nDT: Taven Bryan\n\nIn a recent article from SI’s Albert Breer, who was visiting Colts’ training camp, he called Bryan a “camp surprise.”\n\nDT: Adetomiwa Adebawore\n\nLB: Zaire Franklin\n\nLB: EJ Speed\n\nLB: Jaylon Carlies\n\nLB: Segun Olubi\n\nLB: Grant Stuard\n\nThis is another position where if the Colts go lighter at tight end, for example, they could go heavier at linebacker. In keeping five linebackers, that forced me to keep Cam McGrone off, who is competing for the backup middle linebacker role. I made that decision because that is a role Olubi can fill and I wanted to keep Stuard as a core special teams contributor.\n\nCB: Kenny Moore\n\nCB: JuJu Brents\n\nCB: Jaylon Jones\n\nCB: Dallis Flowers\n\nCB: Jaylin Simpson\n\nAs a Day 3 pick, Simpson has already flashed plenty to make this team, not to mention the versatility he brings to the secondary.\n\nCB: Micah Abraham\n\nAbraham is competing with Chris Lammons for the backup slot cornerback role. I chose Abraham given that he is a recent draft pick with untapped upside, while Lammons has been in the league since 2018.\n\nS: Julian Blackmon\n\nS: Nick Cross\n\nS: Ronnie Harrison\n\nS: Rodney Thomas\n\nS: Trevor Denbow\n\nFor all the uncertainty around playing time at this position, putting the roster together was fairly straight forward. Cross and Harrison seem to each be getting opportunities with the starters while Thomas is the third option and Denbow has been a special teams contributor. The big question at free safety is will the Colts make an outside addition?\n\nK: Matt Gay\n\nP: Rigoberto Sanchez\n\nLS: Luke Rhodes"
