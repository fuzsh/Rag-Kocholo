        "text": "Mike Simpson, who enters his 28th season on UAlbany’s football staff, has three decades of experience as a defensive coach. With two of those decades at the defensive coordinator position, the Great Danes have won or shared six Northeast Conference championships (2002, 2003, 2007, 2008, 2011, 2012) and captured two Eastern Football Conference titles (1997, 1998) during his tenure.\n\nHanding over coordinator responsibilities to Drew Christ in 2013, Simpson will focus on the development of the squad’s young linebackers.\n\nUnder his direction in 2012, UAlbany’s rushing defense ranked first in the NEC and 14th in the nation (117.91 yrds/game), second in the league in scoring defense (22.73 pts/game), and third in total defense (340.45 yrds/game). With the graduation of four exceptional linebackers, including Detroit Lion free agent Jon Morgan, the Great Danes look to quickly rebuild that area on the field."
