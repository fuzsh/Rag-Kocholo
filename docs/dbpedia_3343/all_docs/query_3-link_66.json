        "text": "Michael Bay‘s first project with Investigation Discovery, the five-episode documentary series “Born Evil: The Serial Killer and the Savior,” will premiere on Labor Day, airing over three nights on the cabler. The program — which reps Bay’s first-ever docuseries, follows the story of serial killer Hadden Clark, described as a “mercurial psychopath,” as well as his the cold cases linked to him. Then there’s his relationship with a cellmate, to whom he confessed his crimes because he thought the convicted killer was Jesus.\n\nLaunching on Sept. 2 at 9 p.m. ET on ID, “Born Evil: The Serial Killer and the Savior” looks at “the innerworkings of the volatile and dysfunctional Clark family, Hadden’s path of depravity, and the shocking confessions he made to his cellmate that sent investigators on a search to solve the cold cases allegedly linked to him.”\n\nThe docuseries features private, recorded conversations with Clark conducted by Bay, and looks at the killer’s traumatic childhood, violent family history and the unsolved cold cases linked to his prison confessions. Interviews with other key players include Hadden Clark’s brother, Geoff Clark, and Hadden Clark’s former cellmate Jack Truitt (photo above, with Bay) — whom Clark believed to be Jesus.\n\n“Throughout my career, I’ve always focused on meeting real people — from scientists of all kinds to alligator wranglers, law enforcement agents to bank robbers, and even kings and queens — gaining true insights for my films,” Bay said in a statement. “’Born Evil’ is my first venture into the documentary world, and it revolves around a serial killing family you have never heard of. The focus of this five-hour series is on the youngest son, Hadden Clark, whom I spent countless hours personally speaking to in prison so that I could get into the mind and psychology of a person who the FBI refers to as ‘a person of interest’ in over 20 states. ‘Born Evil’ could potentially open the door to solving many cold case murders.”\n\nThe docuseries will also rely on Hadden Clark’s personal journals and illustrations outlining his crimes, as well as interviews with law enforcement and loved ones of the victims.\n\n“Michael Bay is one of the best storytellers of our generation and he brings unprecedented access to one of the most terrifying serial killer stories in history,” said ID president Jason Sarlanis. “With ‘Born Evil,’ we have ID’s next blockbuster series and we deliver on our promise to provide viewers with premium, true crime content from the best filmmakers in the business.”\n\nDocuseries is just the latest in a series of interesting career choices for Bay, who made waves recently for revealing he was pursing an adaptation of the “Skibidi Toilet” phenomenon. Last year, ID first revealed that it was striking a doc deal with Bay, promising to “expose a terrifying, yet little known, true crime story.” In May, Variety looked at the impact of “Quiet on Set: The Dark Side of Kids TV” and how it has made more noise for ID in the doc space.\n\nRange Studios, Bay Films and Ladder Truck 33 are among the production companies behind “Born Evil.” Michael Bay is executive producer; other auspices include Paul Hogan."
