        "text": "O.J. Simpson has died at age 76, his family announced on social media Thursday morning.\n\nAccording to a post on Simpson's X (formerly Twitter) account, he died sometime Wednesday following a battler with cancer. TMZ is reporting Simpson died in Las Vegas surrounded by his children and grandchildren.\n\nSimpson was born in 1947 in San Francisco.\n\nHe made national headlines in 1994 after being named a person of interest in the stabbing deaths of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend, Ronald Goldman.\n\nPolice were later led on a low-speed chase by a white Ford Bronco that was carrying an armed Simpson in the back after he failed to turn himself in. Live footage of the event was carried on national TV stations as police attempted to stop the vehicle.\n\nREAD MORE: When O.J.

He was later found liable in a wrongful death civil trial and ordered to pay $33.5 million in damages to both families.\n\nSimpson was later sentenced to prison following a 2007 incident when he led a group of men into a Las Vegas hotel to rob a group at gunpoint. He was released from prison in 2017 after nearly 9 years behind bars.\n\nSimpson was a football star both in college and the pros. He received top honors as a Heisman Trophy winner playing for USC in 1968. The Buffalo Bills selected Simpson with the first pick in the 1969 draft.\n\nFollowing his NFL career, Simpson spent time in the broadcast booth and acting. His most notable role came as part of The Naked Gun movie trilogy."
