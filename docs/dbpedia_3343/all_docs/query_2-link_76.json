        "text": "U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson (R, Extremely Conservative Idahoans) has not yet removed WC from his email list. Which gives WC a chance to address the Congressman’s “analysis” of the Final Environmental Impact Statement on the Lava Ridge Wind Project. It’s pretty clear that Rep. Simpson’s analysis didn’t extend to, you know, actually reading the Final EIS, or even the executive summary. But let’s see what he said, what the document says, and what’s really going on.\n\nFirst, a recap. The Lava Ridge Wind Project is a proposed large-scale wind energy to be built and operated by Magic Valley Energy, LLC about 15 miles northeast of Twin Falls, Idaho in the central part of the Snake River Plain. It would be built mostly on federal land administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). As WC has written before, the section of Idahoans is a classic example of TANSTAAFL, with strong elements of NIMBY. On the one hand, America has to move to cleaner energy to avoid the worst impact of anthropogenic climate change. Suitable areas with sufficient wind, undeveloped land and least impact are pretty scant. On the other hand, not everyone wants hundreds of wind turbines in their backyards.\n\nWith that background, let’s look at what Rep. Simpson said:\n\nThis final EIS is a slap in the face to Idahoans. Despite widespread opposition at the local, state, and federal levels, the Bureau of Land Management is continuing to recklessly move forward with the Lava Ridge Project.\n\nFrom the start, I have made it clear that I expect the BLM to listen to and incorporate the concerns of those directly affected by the project. I authored language—passed by Congress and signed into law by the President—directing the Department of the Interior to reengage and seek feedback from the stakeholders on alternative plans before moving forward with Lava Ridge. The Department failed to meet the language requirements of that law.\n\nThe Lava Ridge Project is out-of-touch and has absolutely no place in the Magic Valley. I will continue fighting to ensure that Idahoans’ voices are heard.\n\nAs it turns out, none of the things that the Congressman said is true.\n\nThe Final EIS plainly took into account and accommodated citizen concerns. Some examples:\n\n• The Lava Ridge site adjoins the site of one of the country’s World War II Japanese internment camps, now the Minidoka National Historic Site. The victims and heirs of victims of the U.S.’s internment camps objected to wind turbine towers close to the historic site. In response, the BLM’s preferred alternative would have no wind turbines closer to Minidoka than 9.0 miles, and lowered the maximum tower height to 660 feet.\n\n• Citizens complained the wind turbines interfered with Jerome County Airport, used mostly by crop dusters to treat agricultural fields in the region. The preferred alternative moved turbines away from the airport and relocated other to create flight corridors to an from the ag fields.\n\n• Citizens complained the towers were too high and that project too large. The preferred alternative reduced the total number of wind turbines from 400 to 241, and reduced the maximum tower height to 660 feet. The total acres occupied by the project were reduced from 197,000 acres to 122,000 acres. Total acres disturbed were reduced from 9,114 to 5,136.\n\n• Citizens (or at least environmentalists) complained that the project would interfere with Pronghorn and Greater Sage Grouse migratory and habitat corridors. The project was extensively modified to greatly reduce potential interference, and the construction schedule would bar construction at times that might disturb movement of the two species.\n\n• Property owners complained they literally did not want wind turbines in their immediate back yards. The preferred alternative locates all wind turbines further from private residences, by increasing the minimum distance and placing smaller towers there.\n\n• Impact on cattle grazing. The adjusted foot print of the project would impact only 8 grazing permittees, to the extent of a loss of a couple of percent of grazing area. There’s no scientific evidence that cattle or sheep are stressed by wind turbines, but the preferred alternative minimizes the potential risk.\n\nYou can find the same careful, even meticulous attention to citizen concerns thourghout the entire Final EIS and especially the preferred alternative. BLM specifically acknowledges the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024 (Public Law No. 118-42, Section 441), the appropriations bill into which Rep. Simpson inserted the mandatory conferencing requirements and notes,\n\n[T]he BLM held additional meetings to consult with stakeholders, local elected officials, and state agencies on the project. These meetings were in addition to the meetings held as part of the BLM’s planned outreach to facilitate coordination with Native American Tribes, cooperating agencies, and consulting parties\n\nRep. Simpson can find the changes made in response to public comments in the Final EIS, pages 1-8 to 1-10 and in Appendix 14. Those changes are significant, not a “slap in the face.”\n\nThe National Environmental Policy Act, the statutes that are the reason for the Final EIS, require that the BLM “insure a fully informed and well-considered decision, not necessarily a decision the judges of the court of appeals would have reached if they had been members of the decision-making bodies.” Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, 435 U.S. 519 (1978). Or, WC would add, to the satisfaction of a Congressman.\n\nBottom line: the BLM hasn’t been reckless in any sense of the word. It has sought out comment – and received some 11,000 comments – and has tailored the Preferred Alternative to take into account those comments. It’s very clear BLM did “listen to and incorporate the concerns of those directly affected by the project” as Rep. Simpson directed. His complaint that the “Lava Ridge Project is out-of-touch” isn’t an element of NEPA analysis, WC isn’t even sure what that means. And his statement that it “has absolutely no place in the Magic Valley” is just false; it’s where the wind is.\n\nIf Rep. Simpson’s factual claims are all false, that leaves only one explanation. Pandering. And that needs to stop.\n\nWe need the green electricity. The need is critical. There is no perfect spot, but the impact from Lava Ridge on the Magic Valley is minimal. TANSTAAFL.\n\nDisclosure: WC is a member of Idaho Conservation League. ICL has not taken a final position on this project or the Final EIS. The views in this post are WC’s own, and not those of ICL."
