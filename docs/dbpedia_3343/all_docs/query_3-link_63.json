Still, there goes the best-damned employee a convenience store ever had.\"\n\n―Apu Nahasapeemapetilon[src]\n\nApu Nahasapeemapetilon, Jr., also known as Apu Du Beaumarchais,[10] Slime Q. Slimedog[11] and Steve Barnes,[12] is the operator of the Kwik-E-Mart. He is a recurring character in The Simpsons. He is an immigrant from India, and as such, speaks with a strong Indian accent. Accounts disagree as to whether he is a college dropout[13] or if he has a PhD.[14][15]\n\nBiography[]\n\nDuring the 1960s, while still living in India, Apu spent some time as a student of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, in which capacity he became a friend of Paul and Linda McCartney. Apu's friendship with the McCartneys caused him to be referred to by some (mainly himself) as \"The Fifth Beatle\".\n\nHis education history is contradictory. Once, he said he graduated from Caltech (the Calcutta Technical Institute), where he was the top of his class of 7,000,000 pupils and got a scholarship in the United States at the Springfield Heights Institute of Technology shortly after. Once in the United States, he achieved a doctorate in Computer Science by designing the world's first tic-tac-toe program that only the top human players could beat (which was broken by Bart years later). He then took a job working at the Kwik-E-Mart to repay his student loan.[14]\n\nIn another account, he said he attended MIT (the Mumbai Institute of Tantric Sex) and used the money he won from a card-counting ring there to purchase fake SAT scores and get into the real MIT. Apu failed every class, was kicked out, and had to move to Springfield.[13]\n\nDuring the mid-1980s, Apu was a member of the barbershop quartet called The Be Sharps, which also consisted of Homer Simpson, Seymour Skinner, and Barney Gumble, who replaced original band member Chief Clancy Wiggum. Upon the advice of Nigel, the band's manager, Apu took the stage name Apu du Beaumarche and denied \"by the many arms of Vishnu\" that he was actually a Hindu.[16]\n\nApu and Manjula married after two years, despite trying to wriggle out of the situation. He was won over soon after meeting Manjula and the pair actually did fall in love. Later, Manjula gave birth to octuplets after receiving a larger-than-recommended dose of fertility drugs.[17] Apu and Manjula have a mostly happy marriage, despite understandable marital problems caused by Apu's workaholic nature, the stress of caring for eight children, and two instances of infidelity by Apu. He and his family are devotees of the Hindu gods Shiva, Ganesha, and Vishnu. At Apu's wedding, Homer, in a misguided attempt to play on the bride and groom's families' fear of the gods, arrived dressed as the Hindu god Ganesh. The impersonation was seen through by one of Apu's relatives and failed miserably. Before getting married, Apu became known as the leading ladies' man in Springfield, because he holds a Ph.D. and runs his own business. He also admitted, \"I'm not much of a talker, but I love to listen. I also like to design and build furniture and then to have a discussion about where it could be placed in a room,\" which made the single women of Springfield go crazy for him. Despite his hectic marriage and home life, however, his first love is still to work at the Kwik-E-Mart, sometimes taking shifts long enough to send him into sleep-deprived hallucinations in which he thinks he is \"...a hummingbird of some kind.\" Also, after Apu had an affair with Annette, Manjula made him legally change his name to Slime Q Slimedog. He is revealed to have slept with Selma Bouvier after Homer and Marge's second wedding.\n\nHe claims to know Pi to 40000 decimal places, noting that the last place (40001st digit of pi) is one (yet the true 40,001st digit is a 6).\n\nWhen he is elderly, he looks like Sanjay.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nApu is generally polite towards his customers, always saying thank you, even after less-than-genial interactions with the public, such as armed hold-ups. He is also a dutiful worker to the point of being a virtual workaholic, spending so much time awake at one point he began to believe he was a hummingbird. He is often found spending more time at his workplace than even with his own family, to Manjula's irritation, especially when she finds out that in America, workplaces normally have weekends off, a practice that Apu evidently never told her. It is also implied in the show, and confirmed in one of the Bongo Comics, that Apu's workaholic nature grew more severe after his marriage to Manjula and his becoming the father of octuplets, viewing his stressful home-life as a reason to continue working extensively at Kwik-E-Mart. Apu is also vegan, refusing to eat either animal meat or even \"anything that comes from an animal.\"[18]\n\nHowever, he has some negative traits, shown throughout the course of the show. His hard work ethic and though loyal attitude notwithstanding, \"Marge in Chains\" shows him ruthlessly prosecuting Marge Simpson over a misplaced and absentmindedly forgotten bottle of bourbon, and to even where he refuses the pleas of Homer for him to drop the unjustified shoplifting charges and the trial for the sake of the reputation of security company joint sponsor of Kwik-E-Mart's, Nordyne Defense Dynamics. Apu's antics with the Squishy Woman also highlights his infidelity that comes with his workaholic mentality.\n\nIn some episodes, Apu is even seen manipulating customers into buying things they don't really need (sometimes into things which may be potentially life-threatening and even fatal), and at exorbitantly jacked up prices. He also sometimes slips some snideness in his polite greetings. He has a bit of a paranoid nature, as evidenced by him once jumping behind a counter and then shouting threats to Bart and Lisa who were walking in to investigate a robbery at the Kwik-E-Mart, and on at least two occasions went up to the roof and started firing a rifle at potential customers. Apu is also not immune to practicing the customary traits of Springfieldians, being backwardness, myopia, and even to outright stupidity, having been seen flocking to various questionable trends and to even participate in various mobbings.\n\nIt is implied in a few episodes that Apu may have some nudist inclinations, as, aside from a brief publicity stunt where he made the Kwik-E-Mart have a clothing-optional policy, he at one point while extremely drunk from the Saint Patrick's Day Parade declared in a bullhorn for everyone to \"get naked\" and tried to entice the crowd by stating to not be \"stuck up\" as it will be great,[19] and when entering international waters, he was briefly seen dancing naked on Mr. Burns' yacht.[20]\n\nApu drives a Red 1981 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am with T Top roof\n\nHeritage[]\n\nIn addition to being Brahmins, Apu and Manjula appear to be South Indian, because of their last names and darker complexions. The name Apu means \"loving child\" in the Tamil language. However, Apu has also been shown to be Bengali, although Apu got his name from The Apu Trilogy, which is in Bengali.[21] However, Manjula speaks Hindi, the national language of India (interpreted as \"baby talk\" by Marge), to Maggie, as opposed to Tamil or Bengali, further complicating the debate. Still, Apu's parents very strongly appear to be Tamil.[14][15] Apu has a cousin named Kavi, who lives in Bangalore, which is part of Karnataka, South India; which would imply that they are actually Kannadigas.[22] His possible universities were either in Calcutta (Kolkata)[14] or Mumbai,[13] which are on different sides of India and have differing primary languages.\n\nImmigrant Status[]\n\nApu was an illegal alien whose student visa expired, as he wished to pay off his student debts in full before moving back to India. By the time this happened, he made so many friends he decided to stay. He later became a naturalized US citizen.[14]\n\nFamily[]\n\nSanjay, Apu's brother, helps him run the Kwik-E-Mart. Sanjay's daughter (and Apu's niece) is Pahusacheta. Sanjay's son is Jay. They all share the Nahasapeemapetilon surname. Apu has another younger brother, Tikku, who is mentioned in two episodes. When Apu's and Manjula's parents were first arranging their marriage, Apu was shown as the oldest of three on a chart. Apu also has a cousin living in India named Kavi, who helped Homer when he visited India. He works for many American companies taking service calls and can speak with American, Western, and Jamaican accents.[23]\n\nHealth[]\n\nDue to his job at the Kwik-E-Mart and it frequently being a target for robbery, he has frequently ended up being shot and having to go to the hospital. He had been shot enough times that when Springfield held a town meeting for what to do with $3mil they got from a lawsuit from Mr Burns after the latter was caught dumping nuclear waste in a park, Apu suggested using it to train more competent cops and adding security to the Kwik-E-Mart, citing his being shot on the job multiple times as a reason. Despite not liking being shot, however, he did at least have some attachment to it, as after taking a bullet for James Woods after a robber tried to shoot him, he expressed nostalgia for being shot before telling Woods he might be dying. Ironically, his past instances of being shot actually saved him from that shooting, as one lodged-in bullet managed to block that particular bullet from doing fatal damage to his heart.\n\nNon-Canon appearances[]\n\nThe contents of this article or section are considered to be non-canon and therefore may not have actually happened/existed.\n\nVideo Games[]\n\nApu has been a playable character in several Simpsons games. He is the only non-Simpson family playable character in the video game The Simpsons: Hit and Run, and his standard vehicle is a yellow version of his Pontiac Firebird called \"Longhorn\". He is in the fifth level which is downtown Springfield at night, where he tries to find the source of Buzz Cola and, with Bart Simpson, uncovers the alien reality TV show that has fueled many of the game's events.\n\nHe is also a driver and passenger in The Simpsons Road Rage and is a fighter unlocked from the beginning in The Simpsons Wrestling.\n\nIn The Simpsons Game when Jimbo, Dolph, and Kearney are assigned by Skinner to rob from the museum. They stop by the Kwik E Mart and Apu witnesses them take Milhouse's pants by force. Later when Bart and Homer save and destroy part of the museum Apu tells them that thanks to them his children will one day know the boredom of the museum. Apu later tells Bart that Springfields Fattest Pigs are signing up for the Duff Eating Contest. After the Contest Apu tells Bart way to give Homer an unfair advantage in the Eating Contest. Later when Mr. Burns is planning to cut down the forest he goes to the Kwik E Mart and buys a Magazine called GEO and leaves without buying it. After the foil of Mr. Burns's plan, Apu says to Bart saving a forest will assure he will be at least a pigeon in his next life. Apu later joins Marge to ban the Itchy and Scratchy Game and succeeds. When the Aliens invade Springfield, Apu sees the Mall being attacked by Aliens. Apu later heard on the Radio that Dolphins are attacking Springfield and wishes that his Donuts do not join the Lard Lad Reign of terror. Apu tells Bart that in honor of his victory he is serving Dolphin Flavored Squishies. He tells Bart that he really showed Lard Lad who's boss. He then thanks Bart for putting a small dent in the aliens' plan.\n\nFuturama[]\n\nAlthough he did not appear fully in person in The Simpsons' sister show, Futurama, his head could be seen in the head museum in \"Space Pilot 3000\" and \"Bender's Big Score\".\n\nThe Simpsons Guy[]\n\nIn The Simpsons/Family Guy crossover Apu meets the Griffins and welcomes them to the Kwik-E-Mart. Later, Apu is seen being tortured by Stewie Griffin, despite not being Bart's enemy, because Stewie just wanted to say he took \"a poo\".\n\nTreehouse of Horror series[]\n\nIn the \"Treehouse of Horror VIII\" segment, The HΩmega Man Apu becomes a mutant after the French bomb Springfield for making an offensive joke.\n\nIn \"Treehouse of Horror IX\" segment Hell Toupée Snake Jailbird murders Apu as revenge for Snake being executed by shoving him into his own Squishee machine.\n\nIn second segment \"Treehouse of Horror XX\", Apu rescues the Simpsons who is uninfected due to his vegetarianism and the fact that, as a store clerk, he has weapons stocked, while his wife is seen as a muncher, and his octuplets might be munchers, to arrives in an armored SUV, driving the family out of Springfield. While driving their way to the \"safe zone\", Helen Lovejoy attacks the car and, though initially reluctant because Helen is Lisa's godmother, Marge relents and shoots her off of the car after Apu tells Helen to \"Apologize in Hell!\" However, the SUV gets stuck in a pile of junk at the city dump. Apu sends the vehicle on its way by pushing it down the pile, unintentionally staying behind as he gets devoured (because Marge thinks that he gave his life for them).\n\nIn the first segment \"Treehouse of Horror XXIV\", when Bart, Lisa, and Maggie complain about wanting candy Fat in the Hat holds Apu at gunpoint, while the children take all the candy. Fat then forces Apu to spend more time with his family.\n\nFuture[]\n\nIn \"Future-Drama\", he gives Bart a job at the Kwik-E-Mart and instructs Bart to make a delivery to Mr. Burns.\n\nIn \"Holidays of Future Passed\", Apu and The Nahasapeemapetilon Octuplets stop Snake Jailbird from robbing a Kwik-E-Mart. Later, Marge visits him, Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon visits him The Nahasapeemapetilon Octuplets' Octuplets after the children all start crying and screaming. After Marge shuts the door Apu then tends to a dead cow which keeps telling its not (Sanjay) him, he has mistaken as the reincarnation of his brother Sanjay Nahasapeemapetilon.\n\nBehind the Laughter[]\n\nApu was voiced by Hank Azaria, who, owing to the character's Indian origins, voiced him with a Hindi accent.\n\nApu's surname, Nahasapeemapetilon, is an anagram of the name Pahasanee Mapetilon, which are the first and last names of a schoolmate of Simpsons writer Jeff Martin.\n\nApu's backstory in \"Sky Police\" about being a card counter in university, parodies a real-world MIT card counting blackjack team, which was dramatized in the 2008 film 21.\n\nMerchandising[]\n\nApu has had four action figures in the World of Springfield line. There is also an Apu figure in the Kidrobot figure line.\n\nIn May 2014, LEGO released a Minifigure Series based on The Simpsons. It included 16 characters from the series, Apu was one of them.\n\nIn 2015, as part of LEGO The Simpsons theme, a set based on the Kwik-E-Mart was released. It included a variant of Apu wearing his Kwik-E-Mart uniform.\n\nControversy[]\n\nIt has been argued that the portrayal of Apu is a racist caricature.[24][25] During the 7-Eleven promotion in 2007, some members of the Indian-American community voiced concerns that Apu is a caricature that plays on too many negative stereotypes. Despite this, 7-Eleven reported that many of its Indian employees reacted positively to the idea, but noted that it was \"not a 100 percent endorsement\".[26]\n\nAccording to comedian Hari Kondabolu, in a Totally Biased with W. Kamau Bell web exclusive segment, there is a negative reaction to Apu in the Indian American community, as well as the greater South Asian diaspora community.[27] Pakistani-American comedian and actor Kumail Nanjiani has also criticized the character,[28] and has related that early in his career, he was asked to do the \"Apu accent\" as a stereotypical version of the \"Indian accent\".[29] In a 2007 interview, Azaria (who is of Sephardic Jewish descent) acknowledged some of this criticism when he recalled a conversation with the writers of the show during the inception of the character: \"Right away they were like 'Can you do an Indian accent and how offensive can you make it?' basically. I was like, 'It's not tremendously accurate. It's a little, uh, stereotype,' and they were like, 'Eh, that's all right.'\"[30][31] In a 2013 interview with the Huffington Post, Azaria said it should not be expected that the character's accent would \"suddenly change now\" or that the character would be written out, saying, \"I'd be surprised if [the show's writers] write him any less frequently because he's offensive.\"\n\nIn 2016, Kondabolu announced his intention to produce a documentary about \"how this controversial caricature was created, burrowed its way into the hearts and minds of Americans and continues to exist – intact – twenty-six years later.\"[32] In 2017, Kondabolu released the hour-long documentary The Problem with Apu. In the film, Kondabolu interviews other actors and comics of South Asian heritage about the impact that the character of Apu has had on their lives and the perception of South Asians in American culture.[33]\n\nOn The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, Azaria said that he would be \"perfectly willing to step aside\" from the role of voicing Apu, saying that he was increasingly worried about the character causing harm by reinforcing stereotypes and that \"the most important thing is to listen to Indian people and their experience with it ... I really want to see Indian, South Asian writers in the writers' room, genuinely informing whichever direction this character takes.\"[34] Kondabolu had a positive reaction to Azaria's comments.[35]\n\nDespite the controversy around the character, some Indians and Indian Americans do like the character, even with these latter making parody and satire videos mocking the controversy around Apu and Azaria.[36][37][38][39][40][41][42][43]\n\nSimpsons' response to Apu's controversy[]\n\nThe Simpsons episode \"No Good Read Goes Unpunished\", first aired on April 8, 2018, was widely received as a response to Kondabolu's film.\n\nIn it, Marge finds that a book she loved as a child contains elements that would now be considered offensive, and edits the book herself to remove these elements. In doing this she finds the book loses its \"emotional journey\". She and Lisa then look to a picture of Apu, and Lisa comments that \"something that started decades ago and was applauded and inoffensive, is now politically incorrect. What can you do?\" Kondabolu wrote on Twitter that he was disappointed that the message of his film had been reduced to the concept of \"politically incorrect\".[44]\n\nIn an interview with USA Today, creator Matt Groening dismissed the criticism of the Apu character, saying, \"I think it’s a time in our culture where people love to pretend they’re offended\".[45][46] Dana Walden, the CEO of the 20th Century Fox Television, said in an August 2018 interview in regards to the Apu controversy that the network trusts the showrunners \"to handle it in the way that’s best for the show\".[47]\n\nOn October 26th, 2018, it was rumored that the show's producers, following the heated controversy surrounding the character’s stereotyping, would remove Apu from the show entirely. Hank Azaria had been previously been quoted as saying that he was fine with stepping away from the character. [48]\n\nAl Jean later dismissed the rumor as being not true.[49][50]\n\nIn early 2020, Azaria announced that he was stepping away from the Apu character, primarily because of the stereotypes and bias it perpetuated.[51]\n\nIn March 2021, Matt Groening is planning to bring back Apu with new stories, and says that he is working on something ambitious for the character. Since Azaria stepped away from voicing Apu, Groening is still looking for a voice actor.\n\nIn April 2021, Hank Azaria apologized to every Indian for voicing Apu.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nApu is a vegan.\n\nThe ethnic background of Apu is debated; as one episode implies that he is Bengali, in another episode he is said to be Hindu, in another he is Kannadiga and he is Tamil in another one.\n\nIn \"Treehouse of Horror IX\", in the segment \"Hell Toupée\", Chief Wiggum was unable to pronounce Apu's surname, so he blames Homer only for Moe's murder.\n\nApu owns a Halloween store called Official Halloween Headquarters.\n\nWhen he loses sleep, it can make him either delirious (as seen in \"Homer and Apu\") or snippy (as seen in \"Eight Misbehavin'\").\n\nAppearances[]\n\nThe Simpsons: Season One \"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\": \"Bart the Genius\": \"Homer's Odyssey\": \"There's No Disgrace Like Home\": \"Bart the General\": Absent Absent Absent Absent Absent \"Moaning Lisa\": \"The Call of the Simpsons\": \"The Telltale Head\": \"Life on the Fast Lane\": \"Homer's Night Out\": Absent Absent Minor Absent Minor \"The Crepes of Wrath\": \"Krusty Gets Busted\": \"Some Enchanted Evening\": Absent Minor Absent\n\nThe Simpsons: Season Two \"Bart Gets an \"F\"\": \"Simpson and Delilah\": \"Treehouse of Horror\": \"Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish\": \"Dancin' Homer\": Cameo Absent Absent Absent Absent \"Dead Putting Society\": \"Bart vs. Thanksgiving\": \"Bart the Daredevil\": \"Itchy & Scratchy & Marge\": \"Bart Gets Hit by a Car\": Cameo Absent Absent Absent Absent \"One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish\": \"The Way We Was\": \"Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment\": \"Principal Charming\": \"Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?\": Absent Absent Minor Minor Absent \"Bart's Dog Gets an F\": \"Old Money\": \"Brush with Greatness\": \"Lisa's Substitute\": \"The War of the Simpsons\": Minor Cameo Minor Absent Absent \"Three Men and a Comic Book\": \"Blood Feud\": Minor Absent\n\nThe Simpsons: Season Three \"Stark Raving Dad\": \"Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington\": \"When Flanders Failed\": \"Bart the Murderer\": \"Homer Defined\": Minor Absent Cameo Cameo Minor \"Like Father, Like Clown\": \"Treehouse of Horror II\": \"Lisa's Pony\": \"Saturdays of Thunder\": \"Flaming Moe's\": Minor Minor Major Absent Absent \"Burns Verkaufen der Kraftwerk\": \"I Married Marge\": \"Radio Bart\": \"Lisa the Greek\": \"Homer Alone\": Absent Absent Minor Absent Absent \"Bart the Lover\": \"Homer at the Bat\": \"Separate Vocations\": \"Dog of Death\": \"Colonel Homer\": Minor Minor Minor Minor Absent \"Black Widower\": \"The Otto Show\": \"Bart's Friend Falls in Love\": \"Brother, Can You Spare Two Dimes?\": Cameo Minor Absent Cameo\n\nThe Simpsons: Season Four \"Kamp Krusty\": \"A Streetcar Named Marge\": \"Homer the Heretic\": \"Lisa the Beauty Queen\": \"Treehouse of Horror III\": Absent Minor Minor Minor Absent \"Itchy & Scratchy: The Movie\": \"Marge Gets a Job\": \"New Kid on the Block\": \"Mr. Plow\": \"Lisa's First Word\": Absent Absent Minor Minor Absent \"Homer's Triple Bypass\": \"Marge vs. the Monorail\": \"Selma's Choice\": \"Brother from the Same Planet\": \"I Love Lisa\": Minor Minor Absent Absent Minor \"Duffless\": \"Last Exit to Springfield\": \"So It's Come to This: A Simpsons Clip Show\": \"The Front\": \"Whacking Day\": Absent Absent Absent Absent Minor \"Marge in Chains\": \"Krusty Gets Kancelled\": Minor Cameo\n\nThe Simpsons: Season Five \"Homer's Barbershop Quartet\": \"Cape Feare\": \"Homer Goes to College\": \"Rosebud\": \"Treehouse of Horror IV\": Major Absent Absent Minor Absent \"Marge on the Lam\": \"Bart's Inner Child\": \"Boy-Scoutz 'n the Hood\": \"The Last Temptation of Homer\": \"$pringfield (Or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Legalized Gambling)\": Minor Minor Minor Absent Minor \"Homer the Vigilante\": \"Bart Gets Famous\": \"Homer and Apu\": \"Lisa vs. Malibu Stacy\": \"Deep Space Homer\": Minor Minor Major Absent Absent \"Homer Loves Flanders\": \"Bart Gets an Elephant\": \"Burns' Heir\": \"Sweet Seymour Skinner's Baadasssss Song\": \"The Boy Who Knew Too Much\": Absent Absent Absent Minor Minor \"Lady Bouvier's Lover\": \"Secrets of a Successful Marriage\": Minor Minor\n\nThe Simpsons: Season Six \"Bart of Darkness\": \"Lisa's Rival\": \"Another Simpsons Clip Show\": \"Itchy & Scratchy Land\": \"Sideshow Bob Roberts\": Absent Absent Absent Absent Absent \"Treehouse of Horror V\": \"Bart's Girlfriend\": \"Lisa on Ice\": \"Homer Badman\": \"Grampa vs. Sexual Inadequacy\": Absent Cameo Minor Minor Absent \"Fear of Flying\": \"Homer the Great\": \"And Maggie Makes Three\": \"Bart's Comet\": \"Homie the Clown\": Absent Cameo Minor Minor Minor \"Bart vs. Australia\": \"Homer vs. Patty and Selma\": \"A Star is Burns\": \"Lisa's Wedding\": \"Two Dozen and One Greyhounds\": Absent Absent Minor Cameo Absent \"The PTA Disbands\": \"'Round Springfield\": \"The Springfield Connection\": \"Lemon of Troy\": \"Who Shot Mr. Burns?
