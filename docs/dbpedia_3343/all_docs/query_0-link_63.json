        "text": "Around Town\n\n‘I Think It’s the Greatest Thing’: High Praise for New Trail at Waveny\n\nSince last month, Hannah Socci, a rising senior at New Canaan High School and regular runner at Waveny, has been eyeing the new trail that workers began carving out of the hill that rises alongside a blind turn in the main road through the park, opposite the Orchard softball field. Daughter of New Canaan Fire Capt. Mike Socci and granddaughter of former Center School nurse Vicki Socci, Hannah said the new trail creates a far safer running route than road itself. “It’s all we had for options,” she said on a recent afternoon during a brief break from her run. “When I saw this come in a few weeks ago, I was so excited. It’s safer and it’s better on your knees, also.\n\nGovernment\n\n‘I Am Sort of Puzzled’: After Neighbor’s Apparent Misdirection Is Exposed, Officials OK Bridge Repair on Weed Street Property\n\nThough he apparently had been informed otherwise, a Weed Street man told the town that a plan to repair a stone bridge—a span that forms part of an original, disused route to a neighbor’s 15-acre property—required his own approval, officials said this week. Yet several days prior to making that claim at a May meeting of the Inland Wetlands Commission, Craig Kingsley of 592 Weed St. had been told by a land surveyor that his own property in fact did not touch the dilapidated 110-year-old bridge in question and so the project did not need his sign-off, according to a local landscape architect who addressed the commission Monday night on behalf of the applicant. In fact, the bridge is owned “by nobody other than” Austin Furst of 590 Weed St., Keith Simpson of Simpson Associates said during the commission’s regular meeting, held at Town Hall. “But because the neighbor [Kingsley] was rather insistent that he did, we carried the meeting forward and then found out from the surveyors that, in fact, he had been informed a week before by them that he did not own any portion of the bridge, so I am sort of puzzled that he would tell the commission that he still thought he did,” Simpson said.\n\nGovernment\n\nFirst ‘Waveny Park Conservancy’ Project Imminent: New Pedestrian Trail To Be Installed at Park\n\nNew Canaanites can expect work to commence soon on the first project conceived and funded by a nonprofit organization that’s taking on the restoration and beautification of Waveny’s most cherished and widely enjoyed grounds. The Waveny Park Conservancy (see brochure embedded below) is providing $27,515 for a contract with a Bedford Hills, N.Y.-based company to create a new 8-foot-wide trail that’s designed to help pedestrians stay off of the main road through the park at an especially dangerous, twisting section with limited sight lines for motorists. The Board of Selectmen at its regular meeting Tuesday voted 3-0 in favor of the contract with Cambareri Masonry. Broached by the Park & Recreation Commission last fall and endorsed enthusiastically by that group when the conservancy brought forward a formal proposal in March, plans call for a trail that will start at the base of the hill that climbs up past the Orchard softball field, on the southern side of the road, through a disused wooded section that leads to the parking lots in front of Waveny House. The trail’s designer and a board member of the donor-supported conservancy, New Canaan-based landscape architect Keith Simpson, said during the selectmen’s meeting that his own firm has used Cambareri for decades.\n\nNow & Then\n\nPHOTOS: New Canaanites Who Died While Serving in World War II\n\nSince helping restore a memorial walk dedicated to New Canaanites who perished during World War II in 2003 in Mead Park, town resident Jim Bach, a Korean War veteran, has spearheaded efforts to improve the visibility and appearance of this town landmark. Those efforts have included re-planting of trees along the “Gold Star Walk,” creating a second footbridge to extend it and installing a new walkway and map—and a venerable nonprofit organization now is offering to help Bach preserve the memorial, which features a plaque listing names of the 38 men who died during the war (see gallery above for information on the servicemen). The memorial dates back to 1948, and Bach—a 1947 New Canaan High School graduate who served as a U.S. Army sergeant from 1952 to 1954—said he wants to add some finishing touches, to ensure its longevity. “I want to see it done, it was part of my life a long time ago and it kept me out of trouble at one time,” Bach said. “The final thing that I wanted to get done with the memorial is to put in a bridge across the main stream that enters the park, on the west side of the garage.\n\nGovernment\n\n‘We Are Encountering Some Really Rather Peculiar Hostility’: Neighbors Petition for Public Hearing on Weed Street Inland Wetlands Application\n\nNeighbors of a Weed Street homeowner have petitioned town officials to hold a public hearing for what appears to be a straightforward application to repair part of a driveway where it spans a small stream. If the neighbors in the case of the project planned at 590 Weed St. had come forward with genuine, relevant concerns regarding how the proposed work would affect their own properties, landscape architect Keith Simpson said that he would be “totally understanding.”\n\n“But we have a very hostile law firm representing neighbors, writing and claiming things about this application which, quite frankly, have nothing to do with this application,” Simpson, representing the applicant, told members of the Inland Wetlands Commission during a special meeting, held Monday at Town Hall. “We are encountering some really rather peculiar hostility to this application and some claims which don’t even relate to the jurisdiction of the commission.”\n\nIt isn’t clear just what those claims are. Town officials last week received a petition with 42 signatures—said to total 65 by the time of Monday’s meeting—from a Stamford-based attorney."
