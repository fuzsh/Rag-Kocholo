        "text": "We have decided to stop 2020Soundsystem. Firstly we would like to thank all the people that came to see our shows, as playing live was the fundamental purpose behind the project.\n\nWe set up the 2020Soundsystem to experiment with different ways a DJ could perform live with musicians. In the early noughties I was really bored with clubs and DJs, the scene seemed to be going nowhere. A 'live' show in a club environment consisted of a studio producer staring into a laptop screen on stage. I thought that surely we could make a better live presentation of our music. Of course there were notable exceptions - daft punk and The Chemical Brothers had already proved you could take electronic music on the road and make it exciting with a huge stage show, based around visuals, but there was plenty of room left for mixing electronics and instruments as both bands kept strictly to their machines. I wanted to be able to sound like daft punk but have it played by real guys. (In fact the timing of this announcement is interesting as ten years later I am announcing we are stopping just as daft punk announce a new album featuring real musicians)\n\nSo why are we stopping?\n\nThere are four original members to 2020Soundsystem and I'm sure everyone will have their own opinion but I feel the main reason is that we are now living 6000 miles apart on different continents! We've tried to work it this way for three years now and, unbelievably, have managed to keep it going over this time but it's now become unworkable. I suppose it's like those long distance love relationships, where you promise you'll write and stay in touch but as time goes by it fades away. I believe bands shouldn't go out like that,\n\n\"Burn Out Don't Fade Away\"\n\nThe project started as a collaboration between myself and Danny 'Dubble D' Ward. We played together for years at back to basics where I was the resident DJ and Danny was playing percussion. I actually hated DJing with percussionists in clubs as a general rule and for a time they were everywhere, but Danny, alongside his partner Chris Cruiks, were super tight and worked with the DJ to create a great vibe.\n\nWhen Fat City records asked me to record a non house DJ mix compilation in 2001 I approached Danny to work with me on it. I wanted to mix old records, which had not been made on computers, that were not possible to beat match. I also wanted to make big tempo changes between tracks so we thought up a method of mixing where Danny played drums over the records, handling the changes in tempo, and then I'd mix tracks into his live drum breaks. He was so good at riding the grooves that the idea worked and the final mix called Stars on 33 became the prototype recording for 2020Soundsystem.\n\n1969\n\nThat same year I was sent a demo called Silver City - 1969. I threw it on as, thanks to Iggy Pop and The Stooges, I have always loved songs about 1969, the year I was born. Not only was it a great demo but it was obviously also created using live bass and keys - exactly the instruments we were looking at introducing into 2020Soundsystem. I signed 1969 to 2020Vision and invited the Argentinian duo Fernando Pulichino and Carlos Julian Sanza to Leeds so we could make a go of the idea properly. To my surprise they agreed to try it and came to our cold northern city from Mar Del Plata, Argentina via London.\n\nWe got to work quickly on 2020Soundsystem and I started to dig out dubs and drum tracks from my records so the guys had space to play over them. It was very much a jam session at first and totally improvised but we got some good grooves going. I booked the upstairs room of BRB on Call Lane in Leeds for our first ever gig on February 26th 2003. I managed to get a crowd quickly for 2020Soundsystem as I was already well known as a DJ in Leeds and people liked the live idea immediately. So, unlike most bands, our first gig was packed to the rafters. The first thing I noticed was how people reacted to the band format. I was used to people dancing to my music as a DJ but there is a totally different energy that can be created by four people all rocking out together. The gig was a sweaty, enthusiastic success. I became confident we had a good thing going and we got our first ever band photo done -\n\n2020Soundsystem always had a weird way of doing things as a band - we played our first gig without any songs or a singer. The songs turned out to be easier to fix than the singer! We kept meeting up at the makeshift home studio we called The Sweatshop, a named jokingly offered by James Holroyd which stuck. I kept digging out dubs and the guys would play over the top. Fernando and Julian worked as a team, when one lays down a line the other has got it down and complimented it in seconds. When we hit a jam well we'd record it. Then we would take away the records or samples and Dubble D would program new drums and we'd be left with our own original track. We got four that we were happy with and put them together for our first EP called 'All Systems Go'. The EP did quite well on the underground club circuit and as the tracks were quite diverse we managed to attract people from different scenes.\n\nI used and abused my position as a DJ by calling all my connections and every friend I had in the industry and asked them to book us. Two of the first to go for it were Bugged Out! at Sankeys in Manchester and Fabric in London. So we went straight from a bar in Leeds to two of the most prestigious clubs in the country. Not only were they supportive but they also let us play 3 hour sets! The original way we played was that I would come on stage first and start DJing, then Dubble D would come and start adding loops and samples over the top from a separate mixer. Then Fernando and Julian would come on together while Danny moved to percussion and suddenly we were playing as a four piece band. I'd always make sure the lighting changed at the same time. I was always interested in visuals for live shows, so from early on we experimented with our own clips for different sections and tracks. The visuals were handled by Maria Jaramillo and later Kath Lacey. Over the years they developed each piece to sync with each song and created totally original visual artwork for us. The reaction at the clubs was great, we really hit a chord with people wanting something different from their night out. We started to gel as a unit and play well.\n\nThink Big Stages\n\nWe'd also hit the timing right for festivals. There were so few live bands out there at the time performing dance music so even a band as low down the ladder as us could get a decent slot. When the festivals started calling they were horrified to hear that we wanted to play for 3 hours, of course, so we had to strip it down to 75 or 60 minutes. To do so we had to change the way we had been playing, which looking back on it was a shame as I loved that original format. We kept working on our own material and put another EP out called Experience but at festivals we realised that we needed bigger songs to rock a crowd so we started work on a couple of covers.\n\nWe had been messing around with 'Chase' by Giorgio Moroder and 'Your Love' by Jamie Principle in sessions so we developed those first. As we had very talented musicians on board we decided to ditch all samples and totally re-created a new version of each record. Julian Sanza excelled himself on 'Chase' and spent days and days on the keyboards. We got our version mixed properly by one of Manchester's foremost sound technicians Danny Evans (who is now Elbow's soundman) and I still think it sounds great today. 'Your Love' was harder due to the vocals but Danny had a connection to Diane Charlemagne who sung 'Inner City Life' for Goldie and she was happy to work with us. The verses were not in her range so we found a lovable hairy rocker from Bradford called Pat Fulgoni to sing them - you'd never believe it was his voice if you met him! Maria finished off the project by actually making the heart you see on the front cover above out of sequins.\n\nIt's a tried and tested route to work a few covers as a band and I totally recommend it - great songs are there for a reason and nothing should be so sacred you can't offer your interpretation of it. Playing the right cover gets a crowd on your side at a gig - so you can then shove your own paltry material down their throats!\n\nSonar\n\nin 2005 things took off for us. We still didn't have an album out but our name had grown, through word of mouth, from the clubs and reached the ears of Sonar Festival in Barcelona. Not only did they book us but they also offered us the closing set on their outside stage, that they have always bizarrely called Sonar Pub (The only similarity to a pub is that you can get alcohol - it is an outdoor arena in Spain that can hold up to 10,000 people.) We were so nervous going into that show but we were ready. I remember being at the back of the stage waiting to go on; Danny was banging out rhythms like Test Department on the scaffolding, Fernando was plucking away at his bass warming up and myself and Julian were deep in thought and pacing up and down. By now we had stripped the live show to 60 minutes and even had a proper set list, which was unheard of for us. The sound was good on stage and we absolutely nailed it. The sun came up for our last half hour and by now, with thanks to Silver City and Ewan Pearson we had our own bona fide big record to play called 'Shiver' which left the crowd in tatters chanting the chorus.\n\nAt the end of the show Gracie Rogers, who was taking photos for us, managed to side step security and climb up the scaffolding behind us. She took this iconic image from behind the band capturing the vast crowd at the end of the show, which is the single most important photo ever taken of 2020Soundsystem as we used it for years as a calling card to get gigs. It is also something we can all have as a memory forever.\n\nWork started in earnest to finally make an album after Sonar but we still had the same underlying issue - we had no vocalist. I think the original format without vocals was good but we all appreciated the power of a song and looked into a solution. We had hooked up with New York band The Glass on a remix of their track 'Won't Bother Me' and the mix had been really well received. The Glass turned out to be two top Irish lads living in NYC called Glen Brady and Dominique Keegan. To say we hit it off instantly is an understatement, they are two larger than life, absolute diamond geezers and a whole heap of fun to hang out with. They were also doing well with The Glass and came over for their own European tour in late 2005. We got them a gig at Basics and then booked some studio time together. Dom worked great on vocals on our tracks and we recorded a new version of 'Won't Bother Me' and made a new track called 'No Order' which became the title track of our first album.\n\nNo Order\n\nSonar then massively supported our project again, when it's co-founder and musical director Enric Palau allowed us to record the show and use the recording with his festivals name on as a bonus disc on the album. The other disc was studio recordings from The Sweatshop. I still love the first track 'Hit The Fan' and was honoured when Greg Wilson chose it to re-edit for his 2020Vision mix, adding vocals and FX. 'Like Nobody' and 'Can't Stop The Crew' are also cool P-Funk influenced grooves but my personal favourite will always be 'Tape'.\n\nThe album came out in 2006 and we became massive stars; toured the world, appeared on the Oprah Winfrey show, went out with super models and developed massive drug problems. Actually none of that happened at all. But we did become kinda cool and got booked in clubs like; Watergate in Berlin, The Subclub in Glasgow, back to basics in Leeds, Cabaret Voltaire in Edinburgh, Nouveau Casino in Paris, Deep in Madrid, The Loft in Barcelona and a superb run of festivals including Glastonbury, Bestival, Homelands, Rockness, 10 days off in Ghent, The Glade, Creamfields UK, Skolbeats Brazil, Pitch Electronic, Global Gathering, Playground Festival in Australia, Exit and Creamfields Argentina.\n\nThe last two - Exit and Creamfields Argentina have to rank as our best big stage moments alongside Sonar. Of course, it was special for the guys to come back to Argentina and play in front of a huge home crowd before Underworld. I felt, at that point, that the time they had sacrificed in the UK had been worthwhile. At Exit 2007 we had 20,000 people before us in the amphitheatre of the Novi Sad fortress. By that point we had invited Maria to join us on stage to VJ as she looked far cooler than any of us! I think the show looked and sounded amazing.\n\nYou have to keep the momentum going\n\nWe were too slow following up on the buzz created in 2005-7. It's not just a case of hindsight as I was very aware of it at the time. What we desperately needed was a good manager and good A/R. They are incredibly hard to find in dance music now let alone then. We had self managed the project up to this point and I knew that it needed a proper support team in place. If there's one thing to learn from this story, it is that bands need managers. A good manager is more than worth their 20%. With the recent explosion of EDM in The States I am sure they are all back sniffing around dance acts, but be warned there are many unscrupulous ones out there, but occasionally there are some that are genius. The Clash wouldn't have had the impact they had without Bernie Rhodes and punk would have been very different without Malcolm McLaren (despite what John Lydon believes).\n\n\"When you put a great manager together with a great act you can achieve greater things\"\n\nWe cracked on anyway and I certainly learnt a lot about what a band needs from my own experiences, which has greatly helped understand my own artist's needs at 2020Vision.\n\nPsycho\n\nWe kept working on new material and some good tracks started to pop up. One of them Psycho is still one I love. For me this is when we got it bang on - forget vocals, forget guitars - this is live electronic music, recorded in one take, by four guys all playing together well as a unit. It also destroyed places live because people react to energy.\n\nAmerica is BIG\n\nThen out of the blue I received a really strange message from a guy called Ben Silver. He told me that we were big in the states and that our 'Live at Sonar' mix was regarded as pioneering work for an emerging live electronics scene over there. Apparently this scene had huge numbers of people going out to gigs and festivals. Ben helped with the bookings for a festival called Camp Bisco which was set up by the long running merry pranksters The Disco Biscuits and they wanted us to headline the dance tent, closing the whole festival on July 19th 2008. It is really hard to get a band into the states, with a very tough visa process but we sorted it all out and off we went.\n\nI was really shocked by the support and love we had out there. People knew us and were massively excited to see us. It was just the enthusiasm injection we needed. The show at Bisco was huge for us, the production was incredible and we played to perhaps 5,000 people. We totally destroyed the place and as we walked off stage we got approached by one of the biggest agencies in The States AM Only. We signed up on the spot and toured for two years over there. Legendary New York journalist Bruce Tantum wrote a full page piece on us for Time Out New York which totally filled our first headline gig in the city at Studio B in Brooklyn with an after show at Cielo. We went on to have great times there at Le Poisson Rouge, Santos and elsewhere at Karma for SXSW in Austin Texas, Rothbury and the recently deceased Starscape Festival in Baltimore. We also hit Chicago, Los Angeles, Boston, Denver, Philadephia, Dallas, Richmond and then even Ozark, Asheville, Charlottesville and more! We were lucky enough to be touring just after Obama became president, the energy levels were so high during those shows, I called it 'The Thank Fuck For That Tour'. I made a series of tour tales films which hopefully give a feel of things on the road there.\n\nThere's a series of these on youtube if you can be bothered watching anymore.\n\nAmerica is a big nut to crack though and just because you have a good run doesn't mean you can sustain it. It will strain the bonds of even the best of friends. Danny, particularly, found touring in The States tough and threatened to quit the band on a few occasions. Miami was the final straw on one trip for him. There had been loads of problems with hotels and travel and then the gig itself was a totally embarrassment. We were booked at Liv, which is the same club the Swedish House Mafia's Steve Angello got into a fight with Paris Hilton's bodyguards. I don't know what happened but the promoter had no idea we were a live band and when they found out they tried their hardest to cancel the show. AM Only had enough clout to keep the show on but the club were not on our side to say the least. We had to play to a really commercial hip hop crowd standing on the top of the DJ booth with Danny on his drums so far below us we couldn't even see him. Fernando had the balls to pull it off, rocking out on his bass above the heads of 1500 very disinterested people. We were lucky to escape the club with our lives. When we got home Danny had had enough. We shouted and screamed at each other for a few days and he let me know, in no uncertain terms, that he wasn't going back to The States again.\n\nGreat pic of us taken in Dallas in 40 degree heat -\n\nSliding Away\n\nIn 2009 we had a hit record. No, not one that goes anywhere near the real charts, I mean an underground club hit. It sat at the top of our world's charts on Resident Advisor for ages and stayed at the Number 1 spot on their most charted songs of all time for over a year. Fernando had written an awesome song called 'Sliding Away' which had been inspired by feeling lonely in Leeds and missing his girlfriend. It really was tough sometimes what the Argentinians went through for the sake of the band. The songs lyrics summed it all up perfectly when I heard him put them down in his bedroom on a cold day in Leeds.\n\n\"From this room I get the blinding winter view, can't lose track or be right there near you,\n\nbut I can't decide - I go,\n\nSliding Away\"\n\nI had clicked with a young producer residing in Mannheim Germany called Johnny D. One thing that was useful for the band was my continuing role at 2020Vision records where I find new artists to produce for the record label. It means I am normally pretty quick onto new talent and I spoke to Johnny early on, as soon as I heard his track 'Walkman'. He was happy to produce for us and we gave him the 'Sliding Away' vocal which he turned into an epic 10 minute workout with jazzy keys, strong house beats and Fernando's vocal sitting beautifully on top like a Stone Roses song.\n\nFalling\n\nWe kept working on songs and overcoming that 'tricky second album' syndrome. We actually totally finished an entire album but it didn't go down well with our A/R at the time so we ditched the whole thing and tried again. It was also a very hard time personally for all of us. The guys were torn between living in the UK and Argentina and it was really taking a strain on them. I also had a really hard year being caught in the middle of a big fall out between good friends in Leeds. Hard times can also be inspirational times though and I wrote my feelings down as lyrics and even ventured into the studio to sing them myself. The track became 'Falling' and it was really how I felt in 2008. We started to find a good path finally with the rest of the material and ended up with an album's worth of music under the same name. I checked 'Falling' out again writing this piece after not hearing it for three years and I really enjoyed it again. There are some tracks on there that I believe will stand the test of time like 'Ocean', 'Dark Matters', 'Everytime', 'Way of Life' and 'Closure'. Fernando wrote all of those and was the driving force behind writing the album apart from 'Falling' and 'Broken'. 'Bisco' was a homage to our time at Camp Bisco mixed by Danny. It was consistently the biggest track we played live.\n\nThe album was really well recieved by the music press. We even ended up on the front cover of DJ magazine which is a cool thing to show your mum. The piece was cool but we felt were used to suit their current agenda, which was anti minimal music. I had no desire to wipe minimal music from the face of the planet. I just made one comment about there being a lot of 'boring minimal DJs', which there were but it got blown up and put on the cover. I think having 'Salvation' slapped across your image is also a tough one to live up to. We were still very grateful for the support from DJ magazine though and by and large it was good for us.\n\nOn The Road\n\nIn 2010, off the back of the album, we finally got offered Sonar again as well as The Garden Festival, The Big Chill and Space Ibiza. I had never been to The Big Chill and really wanted to make it happen, but by now Julian had decided not to return to the UK and Fernando was also living in Buenos Aires. I had always been into The Bays, who I suppose were a similar live outfit to us but more grounded in hip hop and soul. I knew Jamie Odell who played keys in the band, but had recently left and asked if he wanted to play for us. He didn't have any inclination to get back into live playing at the time but he suggested Simon Richmond aka Palmskin Productions from the Bays. Simon is one of those people I feel I shouldn't be on stage with, he is that good. What he can do with a few knobs and some black and white keys is astounding. He was shocked to learn he couldn't bring his Bays set up on our gigs as we couldn't afford the excess luggage but he never complained and he stripped his kit right down. Richmond injected badly needed fresh air into the Soundsystem and we clicked very quickly.\n\nThat year we were absolutely awesome on stage, even if I say so myself, every gig was immense, well apart from one - Sonar billed us at exactly the same time as The Chemical Brothers. I was gutted when I found out but it was too late to change the program.\n\n\"These things really matter and it is exactly what good management would have avoided\"\n\nThat year it was not really The Sonar Festival but a Chemical Brothers gig and we were the poor bastards who had to watch as our arena emptied before our eyes as people flooded to see them. I bought as much time for the band as I could by leaving the stage to go and watch them for a bit. But eventually the stage manager found me and told me it was time. We started to no one and to give us credit we built up a crowd and played well but as soon as the Chems finished the arena once again packed out and I was left destroyed. It had taken 5 years to get back to Sonar and a bad programming decision had cost us dearly.\n\nBack on the bright side; The Big Chill and The Garden Festival were absolute dreams. It was so sad to see the Big Chill go down after being such a superb weekend for people. Our gig was packed and perfect. I stayed on to camp out for the first time in years at a festival. I went to see Mad Professor, Roy Ayers, Zero 7 and raved away at The Cubes to the amazing sounds of a young DJ called Seth Troxler. The Garden festival in Pertrcane was also unreal. I was very happy with how we played - In fact I don't think we ever played better. We continued with that line up into 2011 where we destroyed The Terrace at Space for We Love and had good ones at The Warehouse Project in Manchester, Motion in Bristol, Electromar in Spain, Balaton Sound Festival in Hungary and Fabric. We also ticked off a big hometown box by performing at The O2 Academy in Leeds. We made a promo video which sums the year up well -\n\nIn 2012 I was struggling to get motivated to keep the band going. I was always the one who did most of the legwork such as booking travel, hotels, pushing for gigs etc and without the buzz of new stuff it was grinding me down. I also had become much more into pure electronic music again and the club scene was really exciting me. Danny was also losing his mojo for the show, but when it came down to a gig we were still on top of our game. People would be amazed when we told them we never rehearsed, as by now although we lived in different countries, we could turn it back on in a day to perform. We put a run of summer dates together culminating at a show for Eastern Electrics festival in London. I didn't know at the time but this was our last show. During that run we recorded a live session of the set we were touring (as I menttion in the film above.) In the end it was only given away at live gigs and will never be released so hold on tight to it if you got one!\n\nThanks\n\nI would like to offer my utmost thanks and gratitude to all the promoters who put their confidence in 2020Soundsytem. Especially Judy Griffith at Fabric and Mark Broadbent & Darren Hughes at We Love. I'm pretty sure we were the first full band to play on the Terrace at Space on a Sunday and fabric room one on a Saturday.\n\nWhat you need to consider is that these guys risked closing off entire areas of their clubs to make space for our set up and spent a load of money on the backline gear we needed. They also put their nights reputation on the line by introducing live drums and instruments to electronic club nights. It was hilarious watching how people reacted to seeing a live kit on a dance floor.\n\nI'd like to thank the guys for changing their lives around for the band and enduring so much work for often so little reward. I'd like to thank girlfriends and families for putting up with the hours and hours of work and travel. I'd like to thank Roberto Pieroni and Danny Evans for making us sound great and easing the stress of live shows. And I'd like to thank the one agent who had the integrity, loyalty and patience to stick with us through the slow times as well as the good times - Mikaël Benhamou at Advance Music.\n\nSo do I view the 2020Soundsystem as a success?\n\nWell I've got to say I have struggled with this. I am a highly ambitious person who throws everything into projects and this one has taken up ten years of my life. As you can tell from this piece I feel we could have achieved more with good management at the right time. I also feel we did not manage to fully harness the production potential of such talented people - but on the times we did it was great. We were a very good live band and I am very proud of the project. I think we laid down some heavy ground work for people to follow. The gloves are off and I throw them down for someone to pick up and accept the challenge of running a live band playing electronic music.\n\nPersonally I learnt so much about music from the guys and I continue on my path as a far better DJ, where I now return. We are all friends and totally focused on working on new things. You can find us here - Ralph Lawson, Danny Ward, Fernando Pulichino, Julian Sanza, Simon Richmond.\n\nI do feel we played a part in waking up a sleeping electronic music scene into the possibilities of live performance. We did help new software technologies such as Ableton Live make a mark and develop into the mainstream. We did make some half decent records and we did travel the world and (largely) have fun. We entertained thousands and thousands of people and spread a whole lot of love. I just hope we made a few people's nights special...\n\nIt might seem very strange but I have never put my solo name on a music production. It's even stranger given the current climate whereby DJs have to produce to get gigs.\n\nI have been part of many different production outfits such as 2020Soundsystem, 2020Vision, Chuggles, Otaku, Wulf n Bear etc but never used my name to produce. Somehow I have managed to survive as a DJ for nearly 25 years without having tracks out under my DJ name. I don't think there is anything wrong in using parts or vocals from other musicians and incorporating them into your own productions but I do feel you need to be the one behind the actual song and final mix to warrant your moniker on the record. After 2020Soundsystem finished this year I have been motivated to go down into my basement studio, which has been used primarily as a DJ room and start pushing my own production skills. It then made sense that the first track I would give my name to was created by an important studio mentor for me and former member of the 202Soundsystem Danny 'Dubble D' Ward, while the bass was played by fellow member Fernando Pulichino. It just felt like a natural progression after the band stopped.\n\nIt has also made me think about the roles of DJ/Producers further. The topic has been in discussion recently in a few articles I have read, most concerning the rise of DJ Ben UFO. Ben is not a producer but the label head of Hessle Audio records. He is a true selector, finding music from many diverse genres to create a very interesting contemporary mix of music. All features on him have concentrated on the fact that he doesn't produce as a important moment in the modern electronic music scene but what is the history of the DJ entering production and how have we got to the current situation whereby, in general, DJs have to produce to get live work?\n\nWhen I first started DJing there was a clear division between being a DJ or Producer. We didn't make the records we played them. The skill of playing the records was already appreciated in my scene, house music, and good technical DJs gained the respect of their peers as well as their audience. Producing records requires an all-together different skill set. For a start being able to understand keys and play them certainly helps if you want to write parts in a track. I had played drums for years and picked up making beats on drum machines easily but I couldn't play a note. Mixing two or three records together also uses a different dexterity and knowledge from mixing 32 channels of audio. They are both skills that need to be learnt from many, many hours of practice. But what is even more important is the personality required to do the work. DJing requires standing in front of large groups of people on stage and performing live while the work of a producer takes place in small studios with no immediate communication or interaction with an audience. The polar opposite personality traits are needed. The social world of clubs meets the seclusion of the studio head on. Both require practice and it is not only production skills that take time to learn. While Grandmaster Flash was learning to scratch he totally stopped going out as he related to Frank Broughton and Bill Brewster for their book DJ Revolutionaries,\n\n\"I just stopped (going out)...basically I didn't have no childhood. No girlfriends, no basketball, no hanging out, straight to my room...I got to figure this out.\"\n\nThe amount of work required to learn each skill is huge. So is it a case of people being forced into being the jack of all trades but master of none? Would dance music be in a healthier state if the DJs played and the producers produced? Even the day to day lifestyle is different. Producers don't need to collect large quantities of other people's music, they concentrate on making their own or making music for other people. I always greatly respected my production partner Carl Finlow's steadfast refusal to own a single record. He never even attempted to pick up the decks. He is just happy behind the controls of a synth, DAW or mixing board. In much the same way I thought it an imposition to even attempt to learn keyboards. I was never in a million years going to play them as well as Carl so why bother? I had to practice my own chops on the decks. When I became part of a band, 2020Soundsystem, where everyone had their role and performed them well I also stuck to what I did best, which was play the beats. However, everyone has their own taste in music and at some point it is great to see what is inside you. Through all these years of working with other people in studios I found I had picked up much more than I realised. Technical skills can be learnt. They just take time. Somewhat late to the game perhaps but by now I must have racked up close to the 10,000 hours Malcolm Gladwell believes is necessary to become a master of your trade. It would only take me about another 20 years to do the same in a studio!\n\nSo where and when did Djs start making records and become DJ/producers? There are three different routes you can take here. One is responsible for so much more than it is normally credited for - dub reggae music and the soundsystems of Jamaica. While the other two have been dissected with a fine tooth comb - disco and hip hop in New York City. The route in disco can be clearly traced thanks to the many excellent books on the subject including, Tim Lawrence's ' Love Saves The Day', Brewster & Broughtons 'Last Night a DJ Saved My Life and Vince Aletti's 'The Disco Files'. At first the gap couldn't have been wider in disco music between the two professions. The songs were being made by virtuoso musicians and highly talented producers such as Gamble & Huff who created the Philly sound. Their records were being played by DJs who were just beginning to write the book on how to put music together and keep dancers dancing all night such as Francis Grasso, Nicky Siano and David Mancuso. All were responsible for pioneering very different ways of mixing music. Greg Wilson has recently written an interesting piece entitled, 'David Mancuso and the art of Deejaying without Deejaying'. It relates how Mancuso gave up on mixing records at The Loft, preferring to play the entire song exactly as the musicians had played it, letting the dancers breathe and applaud before continuing with the next record. Grasso was the first to segue music together in a continuous flow and Nicky Siano took mixing records by beatmatching to new levels at The Gallery. Although Siano recently tweeted that his skills were later surpassed by Richie Kaczor,\n\n\"No one beat matched better than Richie Kaczor (resident at Studio 54)...he was the best at it, even with live drums wavering in beat Richie would ride the mix.\"\n\nBut who produced the records? The defining moment came not when a DJ produced a record but when a producer used a method inspired by DJs as a production tool on a record. Tom Moulton was first and foremost a producer. However he had already crossed the line between the two when he started to make mix tapes of non stop disco music in 1972, which he gave to the promoter of 'Sunday Tea Party' at the Ice Palace in Fire Island. At first the tapes met with a bad reaction but when a DJ missed his set the promoter played Moulton's tape and rang him at 2am to tell him the crowd were going crazy. The tapes didn't replace Djs but Moulton played another important role in 1974 when Mel Cheren approached him to make an extended disco version of Don Downings 'Dream World' for the clubs. Moulton worked it this way,\n\n\"There was no way I could have extended the record by looping it back to the beginning. It would have sounded horrible . So at the end of the record I took out the strings, horn and guitar and I brought up the congas and bass. I let the groove run and then took it back to the original...\"\n\nMoulton had created an edit and extended version. Two of the most fundamentally important production techniques used by DJs today. His final contribution is well documented as the creator of the first remix. Not a bad legacy to leave.\n\nIn the same year two DJs from very different backgrounds and scenes in New York, Kool DJ Herc and Walter Gibbons, started to extend the breaks in records by using two copies of the same disc.\n\nAs Herc tells it,\n\n\"Well the break thing happened because I was seeing everyone on the sidelines waiting for particular breaks in records...I said let me put a couple of these records together, that got breaks in them. I did it. boom bom-bom-bom...place went berserk. Loved it.\"\n\nAt roughly the same time, albeit slightly later, unknown to Herc, Walter Gibbons was also extending the best sections, or breaks, of his records. As Tim Lawrence explains,\n\n\"(Gibbons) technique of taking two records and working them back and forth in order to extend the drum breaks...earned him the reputation of being a highly skilled original.\"\n\nKool DJ Herc is now widely credited as the first hip hop DJ and originator of break beat mixing while Gibbons is regarded as a true disco music legend. What they had both independently achieved was creating the use of the loop in dance music-the single most important production tool for making hip hop, house, techno, dubstep, drum and bass etc. George Martin had previously experimented with loops for producing The Beatles in the 60s and Delia Derbyshire must be credited with pioneering the use of tape loops for creating electronic music for the BBC Radiophonic Workshop but Herc and Gibbons arrived at looping sections of dance music to make people dance.\n\nOver in Jamaica the DJ had a very different role in 'nicing up the dance'. The DJ in Jamaica began life as the master of ceremonies or MC. The selectors or soundsystem owners played the records while the DJ injected energy into the proceedings through chat and chants over instrumental sections. Although the links between disco and dance music have been widely acknowledged, far less credit has been given to the soundsystems of Jamaica as both the precursors of raves as well as dub being responsible for many of the most important studio techniques used in producing the music. Dance music also started much earlier in Jamaica with the first soundsystems dating back to the 1950s and in full swing by the mid 1960s.\n\nThe story is brilliantly told by Michael E. Veal in his definitive book 'Dub'. The big three were Sir Coxsone's Downbeat (Clement Dodd), Trojan (Duke Reid) and Giant (Vincent Edwards) . The soundsystem's themselves were as important as the selectors. They were built and maintained by the outfit and used the skills of technicians to deliver tens of thousands of watts of power. The music was delivered closer to Mancuso's philosophy of letting each track do the talking, while the actual talking was done by the DJ. The first Djs were Count Machuki and King Stitt at Coxsone's and most famously the groundbreaking U-Roy at King Tubby's. And it is King Tubby who must now enter the story.\n\nKing Tubby was an electronics wizard who could build not only the components but also the transformers required to generate his legendary Hometown Hi-Fi soundsystem. He would play the records at the dances on a system built by himself but brought in U-Roy to DJ, who would do the job of whipping up the crowd. With shouts of 'haul up!' or 'come again selector' the DJ would let Tubby know when the jam needed to be started again to increase the energy for the dancers.\n\nThe lines between DJs and producers were once again blurred when a selector stumbled upon a happy accident. In 1968 Ruddy Redwood wanted to cut a dub plate of the Paragon's 'On The Beach' so he took it to Byron Smith (Duke Reid's engineer) to cut but Smith left off the vocal by mistake. He was about to start again but Redwood insisted he continue, \"No man, make it run.\" Talking to Steve Barrow in his excellent 'Rough Guide to Reggae' Redwood continues the story,\n\n\"I start playin' - that time you have two players . I put on 'On The Beach' (and said) I'm gonna turn this place into a studio...I switch from the singing part to the (instrumental) version...cut the sound down...and everybody was singing.\"\n\nBunny Lee and King Tubby happened to be at the studio when the version was cut and Bunny Lee also went to the dance and witnessed the reaction of the crowd. Redwood continued to create versions for his dances but it was Tubby's rapid take up of the discovery, encouraged by Bunny Lee, that led to his truly prolific and revolutionary output that largely defines dub music. All in all we have so much of the beginnings of the DJ/Producer crossover right here. We have a selector or DJ (Redwood) going to create a version of a production. He then uses the new version for what we now call Deejaying, note that he used two decks. A producer (King Tubby) then takes the idea of versions and adds many of the production techniques we still use today - delay, reverb and pitch shifting to create dub music. Yet he also 'plays' his productions at his dances. He has become a DJ/Producer as far back as 1969. What was also interesting to me was that Tubby didn't write music during that period. All his dub mixes worked tracks from some of the top musicians of the day such as Jackie Mittoo, Delroy Wilson, Johnny Clarke and Augustus Pablo. His dubs involved 'playing' the mixing desk live, adding FX and re-structuring the pre-existing 'riddims'.\n\nSo the divide between Deejaying and producing music to DJ has been crossed for many years. They have fed off each other. Djs have discovered production techniques and producers have used DJ skills in their productions. From the 1960s there have been people who have had a hand in both and it continues to the present day.\n\nThe disco DJs also started to produce, with arguably Francois Kervorkian being the most successful, but Larry Levan also ventured into the studio as did Frankie Knuckles. Other seminal moments include the Grandmaster D.ST scratch in Herbie Hancocks - Rockit, Afrika Bambaatta using German producers Kraftwerk synths to create Planet Rock, DJ Shadow bringing his record collection to the table as the most important element in his productions and on and on.\n\nBut it is house music that must claim to be the beginning of the era of the DJ/Producer as we know it today. As sampling technology entered the fray and increasingly powerful synths and drum machines became affordable, in the mid 1980s, Djs were able to make tracks in home studios without the expense and fuss of the recording studio. DJ Pierre, defined by his very name as a DJ, created the first ever Acid House record Acid Tracks, using the Roland TB303 Bass Line generator. Now you didn't have to be Gamble & Huff to make a record or Larry Levan to play them. Marshall Jefferson started as a producer, who produced some of the best house music ever, who then went into Deejaying while Chicago Dj Lil Louis covered both fields with ease.\n\nAcross Lake Michigan in Detroit the new technologies were being used in even more extreme ways by Juan Atkins and Derrick May, both very much saw themselves as DJs venturing into sound production. As Atkins tells it in DJ Revolutionaries,\n\n\"We just wanted to DJ. Our thing was about the music. Even to this day...we wanted to DJ at as many (parties) as we could.\"\n\nYet they are both responsible for some of the most mind blowing and unforgettable moments in techno music ever created. By this stage in the late 80s you really could be a DJ/Producer, both relentlessly toured the world plying their craft as Djs, following their production success. Derrick May even gave up producing records, maybe he felt it was his time and place to produce or maybe he just loves Deejaying too much. Maybe one day I'll ask him.\n\nSo the origins of the questionpoint to DJs producing and vice versa but where are we at today? Is the rise of Ben UFO or Gerd Janson ,alongside other notable non producing DJs such as Zip a trend or an anomaly? From where I'm sitting there is still enormous pressure on artists to produce records to get gigs. I run a label myself and I can often see the career paths of aspiring Djs etched on to their CD demos. Being on 2020Vision is another calling card they want to have in their wallet. Would we sign music from non DJs? Yes we would, we were built on music from Carl Finlow as Random Factor and more recently Debukas has his debut album out but if I look at the catalogue a very large percentage has been produced by DJs. Do I think that is necessarily a bad thing ? No I don't, it's just an observation that interested me. I decided to follow it through and this piece is the result. I aim to add fuel to the fire rather than dictate or predict the future of where the DJ/Producer will go. The only thing I will say is this -\n\nPlease make records because you love them, not to get yourself a gig...\n\nSo Greg, It's 10 years exactly since I first came over to Manchester to see your comeback gig at The Attic. To say your comeback has been a success is an understatement. You have kickstarted an entire scene that loves and lives disco and electro funk music. It would be fair to say that the musical landscape today would be different without your return, especially in the UK. I can personally testify that my own DJing would not be where it is today without hearing your mixes and learning from your live shows. I think we'd all like to thank you deeply for the energy you've injected into dance music in the 10 years since you've been back.\n\nRL - The reasons you quit DJing are fairly well documented but I still feel your 20 years out of the game remain shrouded in mystery. I know you released the ‘UK Electro’ album with Street Sounds in 1984 and managed the Ruthless Rap Assassins until 1992 but there is still a gap in the fossil record Greg. What the hell happened in the 90s?\n\nGW - John Robb wrote a book 'The Nineties: What the F**k Was That All About?', the title of which pretty much sums up my own feelings towards the decade. It started off great with the Rap Assassins gaining a lot of kudus, but that, unfortunately, didn't translate into units sold over the counter and, when the sales of the second album failed to build on the first, EMI pulled the plug (although it obviously didn't help that Kermit had become a junkie by this point).\n\nFor the next couple of years I was kept busy with Mind Body & Soul (MBS), which had all stemmed from what was originally intended as just a one-off 12\" - a dance version of the psychedelic classic 'White Rabbit' by The Jefferson Airplane, which I recorded in 1989 when we'd finished working on the 1st Rap Assassins album with a day still to spare. The track was picked up on by a number of DJ's, most notably Andrew Weatherall, Boy George and John Peel, which led us to develop the project further, recording a few more twelves. It ended up becoming a songwriting vehicle for Tracey (my then partner, now wife), and we ended up getting a deal with Polydor. However, no sooner had we signed, there was a big change around at the top levels of the company, leading to a 'night of the long knives', where the old was swept out and the new moved in. We were victims of circumstance, our A&R man (Feargal Sharkey, as it happens) was one of those culled, although not immediately – it was a slow death, with them ultimately making his position untenable, forcing his resignation. Following Feargal out of the door were the acts he'd signed, so that turned out to be that for MBS.\n\nThe period that followed was the most difficult time. It was 1994 and the music business had well and truly worn me down. I pretty much lost my mojo for a while, becoming increasingly detached and even questioning whether I wanted to be involved in music again. I was just a bit punch drunk by the disappointment of not being able to make a success of either the Rap Assassins or MBS – you can receive all the acclaim in the world, but once the money runs out you're knackered. I felt like a broken to pieces Humpty Dumpty, having fallen off the wall with no idea how to, or even if I was going to be able to, put myself back together. It was all pretty bleak and negative for a while, but I eventually began to tentatively re-connect to my musical path – I wrote about this next stage in the 'Monastic Mix' blog post:\n\nhttp://www.gregwilson.co.uk/2012/11/the-monastic-mix/\n\nWas there a defining moment or a single event that left you absolutely clear you would start playing again? I know hearing Chicken Lips and Metro Area productions left a big impression on you. Did the emergence of a modern electro funk sound trigger your return?\n\nI don't think there was any single eureka moment. The possibility of returning as a DJ had been there for many years, I was always being asked 'why did you pack it all in?' People were forever commenting on my dire fanatical situation by suggesting I could have made a fortune had I not retired, which was hardly the most comforting thing I needed to hear. The fact of the matter was that I didn't want to specialize in just the one strand of dance music, as was, and remains the case, with the majority of DJ's, but be able to mix up the styles and tempos. The Monastery was a reaction to what was going on in the clubs on Merseyside at the time, which had largely settled into, to my mind, a four to the floor rut. I wanted to play music of different denominations within the context of the same night, but I was continually told that this was no longer the way things worked. I felt older in the 90's than I did a decade on, for I no longer understood what was happening – I was completely out of touch.\n\nIt was after this point that I finally began to confront my technophobia and drag myself kicking and screaming into the 21st century. The idea of having to learn to use computers had horrified me and, as with the mobile phone, I'd resisted for as long as possible. When I finally got my own computer and was able to embark on an internet voyage of discovery, I began to tune in to where all the pockets of underground dance culture that interested me were hiding away, as each had its associated forum/s – Electro Empire, Disco Music.com, Deep House Page, DJ History and Electriks became regular-stop offs.\n\nThe artists you mention, as well as the other contemporary acts I featured on my comeback night (Crazy Penis, Diplomat and DMX Krew, who were mashed up with Raw Silk) were really important with regards to stating my intention. I was very conscientious about how I needed to avoid being viewed in a purely nostalgic context, as there was no shelf life in this - it was all about the balance between past and present, and I'd recognized this from the off. I'd made DJ appearances at various points during my 'retirement', but these were just one–offs, and, apart from The Monastery, centered solely on what I used to play back in the day, especially the Electro era. This was something completely different, for I was making a leap of faith in daring to hope that I might find acceptance, once again, as a professional DJ – somebody who does the job for a living, not a hobby. Furthermore, this had to be done on own terms - I could never just do it for financial gain, for that would have felt like I was prostituting myself. Up until then I'd had no inclination to return in anything more than an irregular capacity, so nobody was more surprised than me by the way this all worked out.\n\nForgive me if I geek out a fair bit here but I am a little DJ gear obsessed.\n\nI am still amazed when I listen back to your original 1983 mixes at how you could put records together seamlessly that were not made on computers and therefore quantized tightly. Even if there were drum machines involved they were often quite loose on the timing. You employed different DJ techniques such as cutting between records but there are still mixes where you beat match and they hold tight. Was this simply a case of riding the pitch control well or did you use editing to make the blends on DJ mixes for radio?\n\nI don't hear them as seamless at all. To my ears the stitching is often a bit frayed around the edges. That said, whilst the flesh, so to speak, was weak, the spirit was willing, so there's a boldness to these mixes that perhaps forgives what I hear as the messier parts.\n\nBeat matching was more difficult back then, for the reasons you mention, and also because a lot of 12\" versions were finished off with manual edits that, although unnoticed by the ears, weren't perfectly precise. Once a few of these had passed by, the tracks would drift out, so you couldn't trust them to run for more than a few bars without having to manually nudge them in (touching the record rather than using the pitch control). Chop mixing, or cutting directly from one record to the next, was much more prevalent back then. Beat matching later became the be all and end all, and many DJ's forgot, or never got to learn in the first place, how effective and dynamic a straight chop could be.\n\nMy original radio mixes were recorded as live, during the daytime at Legend in Manchester. They were then taken back to Piccadilly and topped and tailed by an engineer ahead of broadcast. When I bought my home DJ studio set-up at the end of '82, with 2 x SL1200's (at a time when it was rare to see them in a UK club, let alone somebody’s house), the Matamp mixer, and a Revox B77 reel to reel, I began making my mixes there, the editing becoming increasingly intricate. Even then though, I didn't spend a great deal of time working on any of those mixes – the process was always quite spontaneous after I'd mapped out a rough running order based around the bpm's of the tracks I'd chosen. It was more about those bold strokes I mentioned, rather than attention to the finer details. I suppose that this is why the flaws jump out to me, for had I given myself more time I'd have ironed out a few of these rough spots.\n\nThe Revox B77 has always been your weapon of choice and trademark. Now you use it for dub delay effects and spinning in sounds and samples live but originally it was your tool for edits. Did you keep your old tape out takes from this era? Do you think you could still make edits from the original material? And finally did the tape edits take on a different shape than current digital edits due to the physical process involved?\n\nMost of the Piccadilly mixes were kept at the station, so are now unfortunately lost in the mists of time, although I managed to salvage a few reels. I have lots of tapes from the subsequent years, most of which has been digitized. I could still edit these tapes, but there's no point now I can do it non-destructively in the computer. 2 of my original tape edits ended up on the first 'Credit To The Edit' compilation in 2005 – Chaka Khan's 'I Feel For You' and 'Absolute' / 'Wood Beez' by Scritti Politti.\n\nIt's interesting what you say about the different process between analogue and digital editing. I suppose that back then you might want people to hear it’s an edit, so you'd factor in a few tricks – it was like an additional effects source. These tricks would often be employed at a difficult juncture, where a smooth transition between 2 parts wasn't possible. With digital you have many further options at your fingertips, so its usually possible, even at the tricky points, to successfully make those smooth transitions. So editing has been made much more fluid in the digital age, which, although a positive development, doesn't negate the need for the odd quirky curveball cuts to pepper things up – everything has a time and a place.\n\nI do love a good DJ mixer, however old. The Matamp Super Nova that you used to mix on The Tube looks like an awesome piece of kit, and was designed by DJ Froggy. Did it sound as good as the famous American rotary mixers made by Urei, Bozak and Rane? Did you use the auto start much on The Matamp that connected to your decks? When did their use fade out?\n\nIt's difficult to make those comparisons – you've got to remember that most sound systems in UK clubs back then left a lot to be desired. You'd go into some places and there'd be pure tinniness coming out of the speakers. I was extremely fortunate to work at Legend and Wigan Pier, clubs way ahead of the curve with regards to placing the emphasis on sound (and lighting).\n\nWhen you see me mixing on The Tube in 1983, with the Revox and the Matamp, that's my own home set-up, not what I worked with in the clubs, which was all plumbed in. We took it all to Newcastle, sticking out of the back of Mike Shaft's car. It was Mike's radio show I did my mixes for, and a few years later, when I was down on my luck and had to sell my equipment (with the exception of the my Revox), it was Mike that bought it. I'd love to get that Matamp back – it was quite a piece of kit, although I can't comment on its quality in comparison with the classic mixers you mention, someone more technical nous would need to answer that. I’d presume that the price was a factor in them not becoming more popular in the clubs – can’t remember how much I paid for it, but I know it was a pretty expensive piece of kit.\n\nYour blog has been a massive undertaking for you. The articles tend to be super long and incredibly well researched. All this takes time but you still manage to knock out at least two major features a month and at least a post a week. You even went down to The British Library to look at source material when you weren't happy with what you could find at the time online for a piece. How much time a week do you give to the project and what is the driving motivation for your writing?\n\nWhilst remaining an important part of what I do, it's become increasingly time-consuming, especially in this past year, and I'm going to have to cut back on the regularity of the posts if I'm to do all the other stuff I have planed for the coming year. As I've said before, I'm hardly the quickest of writers, especially when, as you point out, I place great importance on balancing personal anecdote with hard facts. This is at the core of how I write, and I know the combination of the two has been helpful to many people when it comes to acquiring a more rounded understanding of how things used to be, for it's the past informing the present that provides the main theme of the blog.\n\nWhen I first heard of blogging, from a friend who worked in the IT industry back in the late 90's, he described it as an online diary / journal, and suggested that this would be the perfect medium in which I could share my perspective - the factual side providing the structure, but the anecdotal adding meat to the bone. Later down the line a friend, Edward Barton, described me as a 'warm historian' - someone who outlines history from direct experience, giving it more of a human dimension in the process. History to me is never a remote thing, for what happens in the past affects what's happening today. As I've said to the point of cliché, to know the future first you must know the past, and if the past is just a list of facts, you can only gleam so much from it. Via my passion for the music I play and the things I write about, I’ve been able to, as was once pointed out to me by someone in San Francisco, provide a bridge between now and then (and they know all about bridges in San Fran).\n\nDo you feel DJs are writers at heart? Is it a similar process for you to create a blog piece as it is to make a DJ mix?\n\nAn interesting analogy, but I wouldn't say DJ's are writers at heart any more than people in other walks of life.\n\nYou recently started producing your own music. Do you work alone or do you have a production partner? What productions are coming in 2014?\n\nI work alone or in collaboration, depending on the project - there's a nucleus of people who I now regard as my musical co-conspirators. 2013 has been a breakthrough year for me in terms of re-approaching production and songwriting - just small steps, but enough to whet the appetite for more. At the same time, Kermit has blown me away with his new musical projects, Blind Arcade and The Footprint, which he wants me to help bring to fruition. I hadn't envisaged taking on all this extra stuff, I can hardly cope as it is, but Kermit's diving deep into the ideas pool at the minute and coming up with some really special stuff, which I can't help but be inspired to work with.\n\nNow I’ve reached the 10 year milestone I need a fresh challenge, and this will be more to do with making music than anything, so expect a lot more output in 2014.\n\nYou have recently undertaken some long sets, on occasion playing all night. When you first started back you were pretty keen on keeping sets to 2 hours. Have you enjoyed the progression to playing longer and was this something you used to do at Legends, did you play all night?\n\n2 or 3 hours is my norm. When I was originally a DJ, mid-70's - mid–80's, I always played the full night at all my residencies - this was generally 5 hours (9pm – 2am). All-Dayers were different – you'd share a bill with other DJ's in a similar way to what happens now, playing shorter slots.\n\nWhen I played for 8 hours at Loft Studios in London last year, it was an incredible night, and last week I did the same at Kantine Am Bergain in Berlin, which once again, but in a different way, proved to be a really special night. On Boxing Day I'm going to be playing for 5 hours in Glasgow, and I've done a few 4 hour slots here and there, but I don't see any major shift towards longer spots. I think what makes it special is that these type of nights are very much one-offs, so I look at them as the exception rather than the rule. Perhaps it would work if I did 4-6 of these longer sessions during a 12 month period, each in a different city – I’d be open to this if, as in London, Berlin and Glasgow, the venue is right.\n\nYou helped start a huge boom in editing, especially disco music edits. You licensed your edits and released them officially but there is a whole bunch of edit labels out there that edit and release as bootlegs effectively. How do you feel about the effect on the artists, who made the tracks. Is it a healthy way for new generations to find their music or is it DJs taking advantage of other people's music for their own gain?\n\nI think the edits scene, both official and unofficial, has brought to light many records that would otherwise be condemned to obscurity in the current climate, or certainly remained under the radar for a younger audience who’ve embraced these reworks, inspiring them to dig deeper into the career of the artist concerned. Many artists have been rediscovered during recent times via re-edits of their tracks, so I feel the positives far outweigh any negatives. It’s all part of the process of re-shaping the past to inform the future, and this has always been key to the evolution of all aspects of the arts.\n\nDo you think the edit scene is now dead, a victim of it's own success?\n\nRather than dead I’d say it was more alive than ever. There’s an almost bottomless pit of great music to re-imagine, and the edits scene enables tracks that would otherwise only be geared to oldies or revival nights, given that when they were made their mixability wasn’t considered, to be contemporized for the clubs today. There have been some brilliant edits and reworks done during recent times - more than ever. While some might believe the edits scene is on the wane, it’s only just opening up as a voyage of discovery for so many more people, and on a global scale.\n\nI remember reading somewhere that the edits scene was dead about 4 or 5 years ago, just as things were about to shift to a whole new level via Soundcloud. What some people, especially those who are a bit older, fail to consider is that for the younger heads who are embracing these edits, this is new music – music which is making an impression in their lives here and now.\n\nYou give out nearly every mix you ever record free on Soundcloud. Has this been an important aspect of building your considerable fan base?\n\nNot every mix, but I try to share a fair percentage of them – not only on my own Soundcloud, but elsewhere. It’s obviously been an important means of connecting with people, both those who attend the nights I do, as well as people who’ve never seen me DJ live but appreciate the music I play.\n\nDoes the current trend of giving away music for free devalue DJ mixes or is this just the changing landscape for good now? They used to be something you could buy on a CD after all.\n\nThere’s still the possibility of doing official mixes on CD, nicely packaged and with informative sleevenotes, but there’s a limited market for such product these days - it’s just the way things are now. The internet changed everything and it’s impossible to go back to how things used to be – we have to make the best of the circumstances we find ourselves in, the important thing being that we connect people to the music we play as best we can, whether that be by sharing it with them or selling it to them.\n\nHow has it been to hold down family life since you started to tour as much as you do now. I also have a family and find it constantly tricky to find a balance between home and work. There are never articles in magazines about how DJs live the life, with families, as I suppose it's not that fashionable to discuss it. However there are many DJs with kids. How is it for you?\n\nI just think it’s a different way of working really. Most people work normal hours, Monday to Friday from 9-5 type thing, so by the time they get home they just want to wind down and relax because they’re worn out. Apart from touring in other countries, which takes out a week or two here and there, maybe 4 or 5 times a year, I’m home during the weekdays, so it’s not as though I’m detached from my family.\n\nThe longest I’ve been away for is just over a month, which I felt was too long for me, so now I don’t like to go away for more than 3 weeks, whilst taking a bit of time off from the DJ side of things around these dates. I suppose it’s about trying to pace things out in a way that suits your situation best.\n\nI also do a lot of work from home (recording projects, writing, plus the never ending task of trying to keep up with my emails), so I have to be careful I don’t completely vanish into my room for days on end. It’s all about balance, and that’s the ongoing circle we’re all trying to square.\n\nDoes it freak you out that you could be playing to your son in a club pretty soon would he like your set?\n\nHe’s 15 now and in a band that’s doing really well locally, already picking up a fair number of gigs in Liverpool. He’s more Indie-Rock than Dance in his personal taste, although he has a good overall appreciation of music. I wouldn’t be surprised if we appear at the same festival – if not this year, then certainly next. He last saw me play at Glastonbury, I’d managed to get tickets for him and a few of the band, but it was all about Arctic Monkeys and the Stones for him – I was just a sideshow.\n\nI read recently that Laurent Garnier questions his relevance every year as he gets older, but so far still feels he has the energy to smash clubs to pieces. Do you feel you can now DJ until you retire or could we see another Greg Wilson departure when we least expect it? You are at the top again and you did decide to quit at the top last time after all...\n\nI’ll no doubt eventually cut down on the amount of gigs I do, space things out a bit more, but I don’t envisage myself retiring any time soon. Laurent Garnier is correct about questioning the relevance of what he does – I’m exactly the same myself, there needs to be a reason why I’m doing this that’s greater than the financial rewards. My whole thing is tied in with connecting to the history, so that keeps things fresh for me – that’s the underlying motivation.\n\nWhat ambitions remain for you to fulfill as a DJ?\n\nMy ambitions are more to do with making music than playing it - there’s definitely unfinished business in that direction. There’s no big masterplan from the DJ side of things – since I started again everything has worked itself out in an organic way, so I’ll continue to go with the flow and see where it takes me next.\n\nFinally we all know you have extensively compiled charts for your early years but what we need is a Greg Wilson Floor Fillers 2003 - 2013 chart to celebrate your time back. If you'd be so kind to do the honours, as many as you see fit sir.....\n\nOK, I’ll have a go at 15 remixes, edits and mash-ups that have all played a key role for me during the past decade – in alphabetical order:\n\nThe Beatles ‘Tomorrow Never Knows’ (Leftside Wobble Edit)\n\nNeneh Cherry ‘Buffalo Stance’ (Henry Greeenwood Rework)\n\nChic ‘I Want Your Love’ (Todd Terje Edit)\n\nThe Clash ‘Casbah Breakdown’ (Joey Negro Edit)\n\nEdit The Edit ‘Two Sides Of Sympathy’ (GW Edit Of PTA Mash-Ups)\n\nElectronic ‘Getting Away With It’ (GW Edit)\n\nFleetwood Mac ‘Everywhere’ (Psychemagik Edit)\n\nImagination & Missy Elliot ‘Gotta Keep Workin' It’ (GW Mash-Up)\n\nLate Nite Tuff Guy ‘One Nite In A Disco’ (GW Edit)\n\nThe Originals ‘Down To Love Town’ (Dimitri From Paris Remix)\n\nRaw DMX ‘Do It To The Funk’ (GW Mash-Up)\n\nThe Rolling Stones ‘You Can’t Always Get What You Want’ (Soulwax Remix)\n\nSister S ‘Living Ecstasy’ (Norington Remix)\n\nTalking Heads ‘Psycho Killer’ (GW Edit)\n\nTeenage DJ ‘I Was A Teenage DJ Pt 1’ (Extended)\n\nGreg Wilson interviewed by Ralph Lawson – December 2013\n\nI met Mark Bell through my DJ partner, Huggy, in the early 90s. He was quiet, thoughtful and serious. These were uncommon traits for the people I was meeting from the emerging electronic music scene in Yorkshire at that time. Mark made an impression by not remotely trying to make one. The news of his death (October 2014) struck a unified chord of disbelief among our local scene that shared a worldwide resonance. He had a huge impact on people, the scale of which only seemed to become apparent after he was gone. It felt like we had all known Mark's records individually but no one had really stepped back to see how big the body of work really was. I have read most of the features available online at the time of writing and recommend this excellent piece in the Guardian by Jim Poe that lists 10 of Mark's definitive works. It shows the incredible diversity of the productions and the calibre of artists he produced for; Bjork, Depeche Mode, Radiohead, Deltron 3030 and his own LFO project. There are good pieces about Mark out there already but I wanted to share my own personal experiences of him. I also decided to give something back to the people who collected his music - a track called 'Mash' that Mark produced with Huggy for 2020Vision (which you can find below.) Up to this point no one knew Mark was behind 'Mash' as he was already in a recording contract with Warp records, that he had the ultimate respect for, so he asked not to be credited on the record. I feel it is a fitting time to give this track back and I am sure Warp would agree.\n\nMark was best known for his work with Bjork, which comprised of seven albums spanning fourteen years but it was his work with Gez Varley under the LFO name that he first came to everyone's attention. LFO pioneered the 'Bleep' sound along with Nightmares on Wax, Sweet Exorcist and on Warp Records. Along with Ital Rockers and Unique Three, who did not release on Warp but were instrumental in the scene.\n\nIt is a lesser known fact that there was originally a third member of LFO called Martin Williams and it was Martin who I first met from the group. I have no idea what happened and it's not my intention to pry, so I don't know why Martin left LFO in 1990 but he was an active member when I visited his studio in 1989. The strange thing is that I have absolutely no memory of how I met Martin or ended up getting such a prestigious invitation to his workspace. But I think the connection must have come from Drew Hemment who was the resident DJ at The Twilight Zone, which was an after-hours 'Blues' club on Francis Street in Chapletown that I used to frequent when I first arrived in Leeds. He is another very interesting character that you should check out but I will transgress too far if I go into any more detail at this stage about him. I will only briefly add that I met Drew because of his appearance. He wore huge baggy black trousers, brothel creepers and had his head totally shaved apart from a lock of hair at the front which he had twisted into a bleached blond question mark like Tintin. As soon as I saw him walk past me going into the Union building I had to stop and talk to him.\n\nWish I could find a picture of Drew Hemment aka DJ Dru in 1990 but for now Tintin will have to do!\n\nAnyway I ended up back at Martin Williams studio and he had a DAT machine, which at the time, was the state of the art way to record final mixes onto Digital Audio Tape. Now I never quite understood how tape could be digital but that is a sure fire way to go off on another tangent. Anyway, in that DAT machine he had the tape of LFO - LFO, which he played me. It was still early days for me and techno music as I had come into the scene via punk, live bands and more recently hip hop. But there was just no escaping the sound I was hearing. I clearly remember Martin laugh as he watched my face show utter disbelief. It wasn't that I had never heard anything like it before as I had already been listening to Drew drop Unique 3 - 'The Theme' every week at The Twilight Zone and I was familiar with Derrick May's work from Detroit (I think LFO - LFO comes somewhere in between those two sounds) but STILL it was just a jaw dropping piece of music.\n\nThe Astoria Leeds. Credit Leodis Photographic Archive.\n\nThe next time I heard the track was off the same DAT at the Astoria. I know the track eventually took the name 'Leeds Warehouse Mix' but I am pretty sure it was busted at The Astoria first. The Astoria was a club on Roundhay Road in Harehills, originally opened in 1929 as a Palais-de-danse. It lasted until 1992 when it was first turned into Amrik's Electrical store then demolished and turned into flats. It had high ceilings and felt a little like our very own Hacienda, even though it was nowhere near as busy. The buzz on the track was just insane, people reacted to it in the same way everywhere. The bass rattled windows and shook the doors in their frames. In case you didn't know LFO stands for Low Frequency Oscillation and there couldn't have been a more fitting name for the track. Incidently, I first met Huggy outside the Astoria.\n\n\"Where you from man ?\" Huggy asked.\n\n\"London\", I said.\n\n\"Ah cool man, have you been to those Orbital raves?\"\n\nIn discussing this piece and Mark's passing with Huggy he remembered being at that exact same night that LFO was dropped at The Astoria off DAT and the effect it had on him. He went on to work with Mark on two tracks. The first was Hoth - 'System 1' and the second was on the track 'Mash', I mentioned earlier.\n\nI was indeed from London and at that stage I was still returning back there a lot. The summer of 1990 was the time 'Bleep' really hit London. The rave scene had got big by now and I visited 'Mash' on Oxford Street to buy my first pair of dungarees, kickers and pick up the flyers that littered the exit shelves. They colourfully urged me to go to raves with names like Energy, Biology, Sunrise or World Dance, all boasting 20K Turbo sound and the biggest DJs, usually Judge Jules, Kid Batchelor, Evil Eddie Richards, Paul Trouble Anderson, Carl Cox and Trevor Fung. On the airwaves were two pirate radio stations named Sunrise and Dance FM and those stations played the sound of Yorkshire 'Bleep' records. The favourite tracks of the summer were Forgemasters - 'Track with no Name' and 'LFO'. At home I'd hang out with my brother and drive around in my Mini Metro. If you had a tinny car stereo, as I did, you could only really hear the hi hats and the presenter telling you to 'feel the bass'. Well, we couldn't even hear the bass but it was still great and we played it as loud as we could.\n\nLFO hit the main UK charts making it to number 12 that summer. I remember Steve Wright, who at the time was the hot shot Radio One DJ, totally slagging it off. He had to play it because it was playlisted but he couldn't resist telling the world how much he hated it. You know you're on to something when you provoke that kind of reaction from the mainstream but still end up in their charts.\n\nI must confess that I didn't pay the first LFO album - 'Frequencies' much attention at the time. Mainly because I was only buying 12s to DJ and album cuts were annoyingly quiet in volume in comparison. So I listened to it again while writing this piece and once again was totally blown away. It is STARTLING good, even over 20 years down the line. Standout tracks to pick up on again are 'Nurture', 'Freeze' and 'Love is The Message'. I then listened to 1996's 'Advance' and then finally 2003's 'Sheath'. All the time checking back on my player to find out the name of a track I'd overlooked. Bell and Varley's knowledge and use of sounds is just staggering.\n\nAfter Gez departed the band LFO output dropped as Mark begun his career as the man behind the songs rather than the artist himself. He obviously had a special relationship with Bjork and was instrumental in helping to develop her sound and keep it exciting. So much so that he was noticed by the princes of synth pop Depeche Mode and asked to produce their 'Exciter' album. The record put the band back on the map and was also commercially successful. 'Dream On' and 'I Feel Loved' crossed back into the same underground clubs LFO once inhabited with superb remixes.\n\nThe week after the announcement of Mark's death happened to be a back to basics party at The Wire club in Leeds. All week I had seen the reaction to Mark's passing mount and I started to feel less alone in my own sombre reflections. People from all over the word cared about this unassuming lad from Lofthouse, just outside Leeds. The only thing I knew about my set that night was that I needed to start, right from the off, with LFO - LFO and take it from there. So that's exactly what I did. The night was dedicated to Mark and it was a pleasure to see old faces that knew Mark personally or were there at the beginning mix on the dancefloor with fresh new faces who still knew every section of the record. Just as that record has surpassed a generation of clubbers, Mark Bell's work will surpass for years to come. I am proud to have just one moment from him on my label 2020Vision, even though nobody knew except us until now. And here I give it to you to keep as a memento of a truly great artist, producer and person.\n\nWords - RL\n\nFlyers - Dave Beer & Nic Gun Design. With thanks to Michael for archive.\n\nPhotos - Dave Beer, Jane Smith\n\nThe Pleasure Rooms was the second incarnation of back to basics. The club started at a venue called the>music:factory in 1991 (read more here). By early 1994 the promoter, Dave Beer, was looking to move. His partner in the club, Alistair Cooke, and my girlfriend Jos Higgin had died in March 1993, we had suffered a totally over the top and ill advised police raid in February and the owners of the venue were not improving the venue as we'd have liked. Entering the building every week felt like returning to your flat after a loved one has gone and the police were causing problems with the building's license. At the same time Dave was getting other offers. The most attractive was from the Lamont family, who owned a large space in the Grand Arcade at the other end of Leeds city centre. It had previously been known as The Gallery, which had been a landmark club in the city from 1984-92, the owners were keen to see it return to it's heyday. They offered a budget that would allow a total structural overhaul of the venue, including filling in the once famous hole between the two levels of the main room to create an extra floor. The design work was carried out by Judge Gill Associates but a lot of the build was completed by friends of the club. All DJs were drafted in to help paint which, in a 3 floor venue, was a big job in itself. It was fun though to help build your own club.\n\nThe opening night on September 10th 1994 featured a line up of DJ Harvey alongside Doc Martin, from Los Angeles, and Shoom DJ Danny Rampling. All are bona fide house music legends in their own right. It's interesting to note on the flyer the opening times of 10pm-6am. Leeds was the first city outside London to benefit from the changes in licensing hours as local councils were now allowed to extend past the archaic 2am closing times imposed as far back as 1914. There was a forward thinking Labour councilor called Laura Cohen who envisaged Leeds becoming the 'Milan of the North' with vibrant clubs, cafe culture and excellent shopping attracting both students and professionals to the city. You could easily suggest that 20 years later her vision of the future has become a reality. She also saw back to basics as being a part of her plans and became like a fairy godmother for us. Back to basics in turn played it's part in this grand design and The Pleasure Rooms was the shining light in the city's nightlife for the formative years of the mid nineties. If only we had a penny for every student who chose to come to Leeds because of basics eh! I wonder how many people also owe Mrs Cohen a deep debt of gratitude.\n\nIt wasn't easy to get The Pleasure Rooms open. We had wanted to take our doormen from the>music:factory but Dave was summoned to a meeting by the notorious Paul & Errol, who ran the doors at that end of town. I have no idea why I agreed but I ended up going, as his moral support, to the meet them in a pub. My memories have a cinematic sepia tinge - we sat opposite them while they calmly told us that buildings could easily catch fire. I couldn't believe the situation was real or that Dave had got his mild mannered resident DJ, namely me, into being jointly threatened by gangsters. In the end it wasn't a hard decision and we opened the doors of The Pleasure Rooms without the help of the fire brigade.\n\nEverything came right at The Pleasure Rooms. It is a very hard job to design a space that works in reality rather than on paper. The best intentions of architects can end up being totally wrong. Nothing is perfect and there was a really poor flow of traffic coming up from the floor below directly onto the main room dancefloor. That caused a bottleneck as people were also trying to get across to the toilets in the corner adjacent to the stairs. But apart from that the venue was superb. The main room DJ booth was situated on a mezzanine, accessed by a ladder, looking down over the entire dancefloor which perfectly suited the New York style club we were aspiring to be.\n\nWe had been travelling to NYC since 1992 to visit the Winter Music Conference (before it moved to Miami). There, we were exposed to Junior Vasquez at the height of his powers at The Sound Factory. It was literally life changing for me. I learnt more about DJ technique, programming and performance, through Vasquez, in one night than I had in all my years previously. Listening to him was also a lesson in DJ History. He was the continuation of a long line of New York DJs dating back through Grasso, Mancuso, Siano, Cappello, Kazor, Knuckles and Levan. At the time he was the king of New York and at the very top of his game. I took advantage of the later opening hours (and the fact that Dave was too tight to pay for more Djs) to learn how to play longer sets. A normal Saturday was 4 hours. There were also many guests that were only used to playing 2 hours, which would then mean 6 hours sets for the resident. This was nothing compared to the all night sets of Vasquez but compared to the rest of the UK at that time it was unusual to play that long. I loved the 10-2am slot best. On that set you could really set the room up how you wanted it and play a wider range of music. I have always been obsessed by the moment a dancefloor ignites for the first time. If you get it right you can use volume, pitch, track intensity and lighting all at the same time for maximum effect. If anything we have gone backwards in clubs today with the overall programming of how a night can work.\n\nPeople often ask me what my favourite ever night has been at back to basics. It is a hard question considering there have been over 1000 basics shows but I do always chose the one and only time daft punk played at our house. I love this D.I.Y flyer (above) announcing Goldie being added to the line-up. I played 9pm-2am (notice the earlier opening time on the flyer) before daft punk and it was packed to the rafters in under an hour. I remember playing one of those sets where you can do no wrong and daft punk were just insanely good. We had booked them at just the right moment, on their first and only club tour of the UK, before they moved into bigger live venues, arenas and festivals. Thomas had his SP1200 drum machine set up alongside the decks and he cut in and out of tracks and remixes they had done in the studio, alongside the records. A highlight was a version he'd made of 'Lil Louis - I Called You' cut up with their trademark daft punk drums, which tore the roof off. It never came out, but to this day, I would love a copy. Thomas was super friendly (even when I jogged his record) while Guy Manuel hardly uttered a word. The only thing he said to me all night was when people had got up to dance on the speakers. He said, \"But it is dangeruese, zey must come down.\" But back to basics wasn't known for it's health and safety record.\n\nAt the Pleasure Rooms I started to meet my idols, and play alongside them. I was massively inspired by the New York house scene but musically it was Detroit that blew me away. In particular the music of Derrick May and Juan Atkins. Their sounds were so strange, futuristic and alien to my ears that I would just play their records over and over. They have all stood the test of time and Rhythim is Rhythim - 'It is what It is' and Model 500 'Off to Battle' are included in the mix below. It gives me an odd feeling to look at the picture (above) of Derrick May watching me spin a tune. I'm not looking too nervous but I must have been! Interesting to note that I have only ever used the same Technics rp-DJ 1200 headphones since I started DJing and only had 3 pairs of them. That's roughly 8 years a pair. I still have the same Technics decks I bought in 1990 too. Good quality things last if you look after them.\n\nThe Pleasure Rooms had three floors and four dancefloors with DJ Huggy (doing the Yorkshire vogue above) residing as Lord Hoth in the basement, playing pure Detroit techno, Chicago jack trax and early European electronic music. The floor above was hosted by Lee Wright, who played soulful US Garage and the bar area saw James Holroyd and Simon Mu play balearic beats, disco, funk and even ambient sounds. A night in The Pleasure Rooms covered all bases. People would wander from room to room and even have certain times when they'd visit a particular floor.\n\nAs I mentioned I was hugely influenced by my times in New York and started to work hard on the programming aspect of my sets. I was playing a lot of Sound Factory style music including many productions from Francois Kevorkian, Deep Dish, Angel Moraes, Prescription, Danny Tenaglia, DJ Pierre (especially his wild pitch sound) and Roy Davis Jnr. But I was also supporting the emerging UK house scene that was very strong at the time including releases from Nuphonic, Paper Recordings, Junior Boys Own, Chris Duckenfield & Richard Brown, Classic and the fledgling 2020Vision itself. That would then have my Detroit influences thrown in the pot. Chez Damier and Ron Trent, Alton Miller and Stacey Pullen became firm favourites from Detroit.\n\nThe next big impact though came from Chicago and Mr Derrick Carter (pictured above with myself in 1997). We first met DC at an after hours in New York when he had long dreadlocks. Once again we were early to invite him over to play at basics. He brought a totally different style from the NYC tribal sounds but his technique and mixing were equally as astonishing, albeit in a very different way. The Chicago scene had spawned a style of DJIng that was faster, more frenetic and relentless due to the high numbers of DJs in the city competing for tight slots. You had to show what you could do in a short space of time, without the luxury of long programmed sets. DC is also a huge personality and fitted into the basics party mentality perfectly. DC introduced me to Cajmere and his Cajual records empire in Chicago which then became another important source of beats for basics.\n\nThe main room had a high ceiling with a vaulted roof (above) which let the light in. In the summer months this meant that the last session from 4-6am turned into daylight. This had an effect like an open air Ibizan club and was the time the regulars would really get down. Dave would hand out sun glasses and other props would appear. He was known to get a broom out and start sweeping the dancefloor. Sometimes this would include sweeping up a stray punter that had had too much for one night. There were many memorable last sets. I remember Mark Moore being a perfect fit for that time and, at the end of his set, everyone having flowers in their hair and dancing hand in hand in a circle as the sun came up. I'm sure that was down to Mr Beer again.\n\nBut the DJ that we really wanted in there was Danny Tenaglia. DT had, by 1995, taken Vasquez' crown and residency in New York (The Sound Factory became Twilo) with his hard & soul tribal sound and incredibly precise technique. He had also made a reputation for himself in Miami where he hosted all night sessions at a club called Groovejet. We finally managed to drag him over and once again I dropped lucky with the first slot before him. He took it from night to dawn perfectly and in the final hour the regulars started voguing in honour of the New York drag queens who were a part of his dancefloor at home. He thought it was hilarious. He was also one of the rare DJs to return the favour. He invited me out to New York to warm up for him at his legendary 'Be Yourself' nights at Vinyl Club a few times.\n\nThis is a shot of 'fish tank corner' on the way to Room 3. I always wondered who fed those fish and how they stood the vibrations. We are all so used to having photos and videos on our phones now that it is easy to forget how new this development is. It may seem like ancient history to some but in the big scheme of things (and in my mind) this club existed just a few years ago. But that huge change in technology means that there are hardly any photos of The Pleasure Rooms in action. It also means I would be massively grateful to anyone who does have media of any shape or form. I hope that this piece is just a kick starter for other people to get involved and add their own stories, pictures and memories. Please leave your own experiences as comments below.\n\nI use a mix of old and new technology to make the mixes with one golden rule - they must be recorded in one take to give the feel of a live set. I do allow a little post editing but it's mostly fine tuning levels. The Rane 2016 rotary mixer was not actually what we had in the Pleasure Rooms but it gives a beautiful sound and warmth and also makes you DJ in a different way from slide faders.\n\nGear list\n\nRane MP2016 + XP2016\n\nRe-conditioned Technics 1210 (Leeds Pro Audio)\n\nPioneer CDJ-2000 Nexus\n\nMaster Sounds vinyl weights\n\nEventide Time Factor\n\nLivid DS1\n\nKontrol X1\n\nRecorded into Apple Mac Pro\n\nSo without further ado here is the main attraction, the star turn of the night - the music, which itself tells the story. As I've mentioned before these mixes are a labour of love. I have promised to add to them yearly around the time of basics birthday in late November (I'm a little late as usual). If it was back in the day they would be on triple CD and cost you a few dollars. But luckily for you we live in different times and the mix is available for free. I'm not sure if this is right or wrong, but for now, it is what it is. Of course there are also hundreds of artists and many labels involved in the project. So how do we repay them? Firstly there is a full track listing below, secondly I highlight every track used in the 'Records I Love' section of the blog and lastly I try to tell their stories as well as my own. I hope that you seek them out and show them love. I also strongly feel this is, currently, the best way to document the life and times of one of the longest running house music clubs in the world. Words are good but it's all about the music. I have tried to re-create a session at The Pleasure Rooms for those of you who were there, as well as, for those of you who didn't hear it the first time...\n\nThe Pleasure Rooms mix\n\nAni - Love is The Message (Prescription)\n\nRound Two - New Day (Main Street)\n\nMark Grant -Touch Me (Dub) (Cajual)\n\nGroove Patrol - Lost in The Groove (Strictly Rhythm)\n\nRuben Mancias - I Rise (Look at You)\n\nThe Chicago Connection - Dancin' (Cajmere Mix) (Cajual)\n\nJohnny Fiasco-Conduction (Cajual)\n\nFrancois K - Mindspeak (Danny Tenaglia mix) (Wave)\n\nPSB - A Red Letter Day (DT’s Twilo dub / RL Edit) (Unreleased)\n\nKraze / Moonfou - Voodoo Sun (RL Edit) (Project X)\n\nGeorge Kranz - Din Da Da (Personal)\n\nLil Mo Yin Yang - Reach (Strictly Rhythm)\n\nAngel Moraes - Heaven Knows (FFRR)\n\nSwingtime Dee - Your Wildest Dreams (Dub) (Z Records)\n\nPhoton Inc - Generate Power (Acappella) (Strictly Rhythm)\n\nUnderground Sound of Lisbon - So Get Up (Acappella) (Tribal)\n\nGary Martin - Gigi Galaxy (Teknotika)\n\nJeff Mills The Purpose Maker - In The Bush (Axis)\n\nMike Inc - House Arrest (Force Inc)\n\nRobotman - Do Da Doo (Definitive)\n\nModel 500 - Off To Battle (Metroplex)\n\nRhythim is Rhythim - It is What It is (Transmat)\n\n51 Days - Tracktion (Touche)\n\nAngel Moraes - The Cure (Hot n Spycy)\n\nKenlou III - What a Sensation beats (MAW Records)\n\nBlack Science Orchestra - New Jersey Deep (Junior Boys Own)\n\nSessomato - Moody (dub) (Junior Boys Own)\n\nPaper Music Issue 1 - Downtime (Paper Recordings)\n\nRound One - I'm your Brother (Main Street)\n\nMAW - I Can't Get No Sleep feat India (MK Mix)\n\nFaze Action - In The Trees (Nuphonic)\n\nWords - RL\n\nFlyers - Dave Beer & Nic Gun Design.\n\nPhotos - Dave Beer\n\nI am not entirely sure why back to basics has tended to change venues every three to four years. Maybe promoter Dave Beer sees venues like cars that need to be upgraded regularly. Maybe it's because a cycle of three years is also about right for clubs too. Usually; there is an initial excitement about the new place, a regular crowd forms, a peak period and a gradual tapering off. Occasionally venues can last far longer (fabric / Sub Club) or they can also close far more abruptly like The Pleasure Rooms. Despite both Fridays and Saturdays being successful the venue was reportedly losing money due to an increase in city centre rents as Leeds became a fashionable place to live in the 90s. The writing was on the wall in March 1997 when the company that owned the building went bust and the venue closed. There were behind the scenes negotiations and it re-opened for a few months but it didn't work, the momentum had been lost. Despite several attempts to make the venue work as one large space it never happened again and has since been split into smaller units.\n\nMark Ital - Sub Dub\n\nI have always been into dub reggae, in fact it was my first love in dance music before house. So on a night off I enjoy hitting a dub club. One night in 1997 I was invited by my friend and original basics crew member, Moose, to a Sub Dub night at Fiddler's Club on Harrison street off the top of New Briggate. It had sticky beer encrusted carpets, low ceilings and a surprisingly good sound. I didn't think much about it at the time but when the troubles started at The Pleasure Rooms the visit came back into my mind and I mentioned the venue to Dave. The timing happened to be perfect as Fiddler's had recently been bought by a lady called Val Rose and she was keen to turn it around and more than happy to talk to Dave. After all, basics had already won two awards for best club in the country at the DMC and Muzik Magazine awards so what venue owner wouldn't want basics ?\n\nDave and Val agreed a deal and started work on a new look for the club. The concept was that it would be a fresh new start for both of them and the club would also be 'blinding'. Dave came up with the idea of 'Mint', the word worked well to convey both 'Minty' freshness and 'Mint' meaning class. The interior was lightened up with a green and white colour scheme and nice touches like Polo mint bar stools. The lighting system was upgraded and a sound system bought in from the company that had fitted Sankeys in Manchester. The Mint Club was born. Back to basics opened there under it's shorter nickname 'Basics' on 23rd May 1998. The first flyer had a picture of a barking dog and the slogan 'Back to Bite Your Legs Off'.\n\nThe Mint Club was an immediate success, it's relatively small size compared to previous basics venues meant it was easy to fill and the low ceiling ensured a great atmosphere. The timing was perfect as it coincided with a move away from the huge 90s Superclubs towards more intimate spaces. The Mint club was a Rose family affair with Val's daughter Sonia on the door and Val herself always at the club, helping behind the bar and even sweeping up at the end of every night. It still remains the only club I have ever been involved in where the owner cleaned the place up. You needed to keep well clear of Val's brush at the end of the night though as she would wield it at any stragglers! She was seen as a tough lady but underneath a total diamond. She would also have no problem with having a go at the DJs, she wasn't one for airs or graces. I remember doing the warm up once and must have been playing too loudly so she came up and told that it was \"too bloody early to have it that loud!\". She was right as it goes.\n\nTo this day I hate the music being too loud when a club is filling up as people have no time to socialise and chat. The warm up should be just that - a warm up. It seems a lost art form today. We'd keep the volume down really low for the first two hours and play slower tempo music with brighter ambient lighting. Then every week at roughly midnight I'd give the nod to the lighting op and he'd turn the lights down at exactly the moment I turned the volume up. When you are doing a proper weekly residency it becomes possible to break tunes or give them a certain place in the night's programming. I started to play Moodymann's - 'Day We Lost The Soul' every week as the track to kick off proceedings at midnight. People would know what to expect when they heard the intro and start whooping and stamping their feet. So it made perfect sense to start my DJ Mix for The Mint Club Years (below) with this record.\n\nDJ Sneak at The Mint Club 1999\n\nMusically back to basics, at The Mint Club, had a clear separate identity from it's previous incarnations. It was a smaller space so we didn't have as much need to play the big room New York tracks that had ruled at The Pleasure Rooms. The three major influences became; the more jackin' boompty house of Chicago, the percussive sounds of the West Coast scene and the new wave of French funk that flowed freely in the aftermath of daft punk. Derrick Carter became the biggest and most popular guest DJ, always selling out and often playing on the big nights like birthdays. He was joined by DJ Sneak, Mark Farina with their slammin' hi hats, heavily swung rhythms and cut & paste samples, which became our staple diet of beats.\n\nThe other factor in the Mint Club Years music was French.\n\nEvery dog has it's day and all great countries have their period in time and 1998 certainly belonged to France. Writing this piece immediately following the tragic events of November 13th 2015 when 129 people lost their lives on a normal Friday night out in Paris, it is even more poignant to think about the special times I had there and how important the musicians, DJs and producers of France have been to the back to basics story. In 1998 France won the world cup on home turf, daft"
