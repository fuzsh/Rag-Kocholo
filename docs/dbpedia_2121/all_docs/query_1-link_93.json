A surprise even to me !!\n\nIt's also true that health-wise, this is becoming increasingly necessary, both physically and mentally. I thought to myself some years ago, I think near the start of my 2014, perhaps I even thought this in 2013, that for my health I might need to walk every 2 years or so instead of every 5 or so, and that prediction seems to be becoming true. I need to be out and about, not stuck at home and in front of my computer.\n\nAnyway, I am planning to get the Night Train from Nice to Paris, spend a day there, then Night Train to Biarritz. Bah !!! there's still no return of the Night Train directly from here to there, that was a lovely train !!\n\nNot sure yet how I'll get from the border to Salamanca, but I'm sure I'll think of something.\n\nI'll walk to Santiago, and I'll walk at least some distance out from Santiago -- hitch-hike likely to an extent along the Francès, with definitely some days walking on the Meseta, which I love to bits !! Then make my Way to Roncesvalles, which I'll consider (when I get there) as Day 373+0 on my Home to Home. I did get further last time ; but with so many of the compromises I was forced into, I really do need to restart my Way Home from that point onwards.\n\nWish me luck !!\n\nC clearly\n\nModerator\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nMost years since 2012\n\nmspath\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nFrances, autumn/winter; 2004, 2005-2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015\n\nJun 9, 2024\n\n#3\n\nJabbaPapa,\n\nPlease don't try to do too much too quickly.

Fixing it at the seamstress is something else I had to compromise against. Well, at least my belt is a bit more viable this time.\n\nClearing up the mess pre-Camino I did anyway find my hiking gloves -- I don't like them, they're artificial fabric and they stink as soon as they're wet, but I hadn't the time to organise better ones.\n\nHaven't put everything in yet, but the pack is definitely lighter, even with the sleeping bag and cape already there.\n\nI've a feeling I won't get going 'til early next week -- I won't travel on the week-end anyway.\n\nlovingkindness\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\n.\n\nJabbaPapa\n\n\"True Pilgrim\"\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\n100 characters or fewer : see signature details\n\nJun 16, 2024\n\n#7\n\nWell, the project of a trip via Paris is dead.\n\nCan't afford it.

Also technically on the Piémont Way.\n\nThree decent lifts got me here, the first the short distance from Ginestas to Ventenac-du-Minervois thanks to a vineyard labourer. Was a quick one over a short distance, got picked up inside Ginestas itself, where I had taken a café au lait and recharged my devices a bit.\n\nThen the walk through Ventenac and the aforementioned beauty spot at the canal, maybe 2K total, and got a lift from a gentleman in an old but well cared for 2CV who took me to Conilhac. We discussed politics and religion, though he did get into the a rather anti-clerical monologue towards the end. It's clearly a great area for hiking and biking anyway , nice and flat, with a mix of little tarmac roads, dirt trails, and agricultural roads.\n\nLunch, then a lift to Carcassonne, didn't really have to wait that long for it, fairly standard lift and not much to say, but it was good and fast.\n\nI tried to stay at the Abbaye, but nobody was answering the phone, I went there to see what's up, nobody was there except for a couple of pilgrims who had been calling since morning to try and get their credencials, and a guy who lives there and told us that often on the weekend there's nobody there. Guess the nuns have gone, then. The website of the place wants you to reserve in advance via email ...\n\nSo I called the youth hostel, and got a good lower bunk here. It's set up a lot like some of the more modern Albergues on the Francès, of the individual bunk alcoves type with a curtain, pillow and duvet, a shower and toilet in each dormitory, and so on. They sell some overpriced food on the ground floor, which is nonetheless attractively set up and comfortable.\n\nGood place to stay overall, and of course I really needed this night in an actual bed, shower, and get some soap and water into some clothing !!\n\nBetween the short bits of morning walking, then some to-and-fro between the old town and new over the old bridge, maybe a 5K or so total ? So not much.\n\nI'm trying to sort out my Android device misbehaviour, and I am beginning to see that the main reason for it seems to be that after some months if non-use, it resets all apps to default settings, so that all that I had done to make it usable last time round had been lost. Found out anyway why the camera was switching itself on, and so it should stop doing so.\n\nRest here a bit longer, go down for a coffee and then look for a little supermarket open on Sunday morning. Sadly no time I guess to go to Mass, unless I get lucky on the way out of the city towards a good place for hitch-hiking.\n\nLast edited: Jun 23, 2024\n\nJabbaPapa\n\n\"True Pilgrim\"\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\n100 characters or fewer : see signature details\n\nJun 23, 2024\n\n#28\n\nI've met a few pilgrims.\n\nApart from the couple who were looking for credencials, one of the residents at Emmaus suddenly declared, I walked the Camino !! 913 Km !! then scuttled off, hmm maybe he did.\n\nA Spanish pilgrim who has just finished the Norte, he lives on the Norte and often bikes along it was staying here too, for a post-Camino vacation, so we swapped notes and some stories about the tourigrinos LOL.\n\nHis French is better than my Spanish, so that's what we spoke in, with a few pieces of Camino-specific Spanish thrown in.\n\nAt the same time, my Camino habits are kicking back in, so this is all doing a pretty good job with my Camino prep, that is getting used to life out of the backpack again, re-introduction to the daily effort, as well as the social element.\n\nJabbaPapa\n\n\"True Pilgrim\"\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\n100 characters or fewer : see signature details\n\nJun 23, 2024\n\n#29\n\nBram - -\n\nBit of a suburban slog out from the centre of Carcassonne to the edge point where hitching even becomes possible, got one short lift, then a second better one from a Catholic couple who picked me up because I am a pilgrim.

There's virtually nothing in terms of Camino infrastructure, just the usual sort of gîtes and chambers d'hôte that you could find on even the most DIY route. It might be better for bikers.\n\nAll of the above applies to the Arles route variant, except that additionally it hasn't even been waymarked and so includes much DIY. Plus between Béziers and Carcassonne there seems to be the same dearth of Camino infrastructure as between Béziers and Perpignan, which seems to be indicative of a widespread failure by the Region to support these two major and one important secondary Camino routes.\n\nDoes the fact that the region has become broadly atheistic have something to do with this lack of support ?\n\nAnyway I may need to roughly follow the Piémont Way out from Lourdes on my Way back home, always assuming that there's any better support on that route ...\n\nI will not be walking back this way anyway, unless I change my mind again ?\n\nAs to my way forward hitch-hiking now, some motorway hitching looks to be unavoidable, though my best route looks still to be via Lourdes - - unless who knows which way someone might take me ?\n\nSlept well last night anyway, just passing some time to recharge the Android device somewhat in a bar.\n\nJabbaPapa\n\n\"True Pilgrim\"\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\n100 characters or fewer : see signature details\n\nJun 25, 2024\n\n#39\n\nOK I had another look and did find some good details for the Piémont Way.

The trip went well, and I got into Lourdes at about 1PM or so.\n\nI got some beers, not many, and sat down to rest in the shade for a while by the Parish Church.\n\nThen I went in search of the pilgrim office, which has moved again, and first time ever for me it was open. Hooray !! Just went for the chat really, and to be friendly, though I did get some more up-to-date info about the Lourdes -SJPP lodging situation.

Last night, I had the start of a fairly deep conversation with a Dutch peregrina here, then on my way down to the grotto at a point that was still early enough for hitch-hiking, I met her in town, and we needed to continue that conversation.\n\nShe is still staying here too, so that's nice, maybe we'll carry it on.\n\nAnyway then I went down to the grotto and made my prayers and whatnot, then stopped for a spot in the shade while looking for the exit towards the road.\n\nA young man was there studying a corrected paper, and as he got up to leave I casually said hallo, and is that a paper for your studies ?\n\nYes but I'm a seminarian, just being polite we said where are you from and so on, are you going to Santiago etc.\n\nAnyway he was from Barcelona he said, I said oh I used to live there, in a village near Sant Cugat dell Vallès, oh that's where our Seminary is. I said actually I went to school in Sant Cugat, but actually we lived in Valldoreix. He said crazy, our Seminary is in Valldoreix (which is sometimes considered as a part of Sant Cugat).\n\nAnyway, he went off then came back, have you eaten you can come with us.\n\nSo it turns out that the whole Seminary group from Valldoreix was in Lourdes, and I ate with the group and we shared some stories - - and at the end, after Grace, their Spiritual Director gave me a pilgrims blessing, which is the kind of very unexpected thing that's been happening to me all week.\n\nAnyway after all of these alarums and excursions, my route to a hitch-hiking spot took me straight back to the front of the Albergue, the heat of the day was up, pretty much impossible to hitch, there was a pilgrim buzzing at the door to get in, and the whole of it was just - - OK I give in, that's the end of my hitch-hiking aspirations for the day !!\n\nSigh ...\n\nWell, I have nothing more left to do in Lourdes now, tomorrow that is, I'm at the right edge of the city to get out my way in the morning, my clothes have had a second round of cleaning, so hopefully I'll be back on track tomorrow.\n\nBut yeah, the Camino really does provide ...\n\nLast edited: Jun 26, 2024\n\nhenrythedog\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nAnnually - often more - from 2014\n\nJun 26, 2024\n\n#44\n\nthe Camino really does provide ...\n\nI think of it as ‘the more you put in, the more you get out’.\n\nNobody could accuse you of not ‘putting in’.

I'm beginning to get an impression that with a few more weeks of walking in me, thanks to the improvement in my knees, I could potentially begin to walk longer distances than I have been since 2019.\n\nJabbaPapa\n\n\"True Pilgrim\"\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\n100 characters or fewer : see signature details\n\nJul 10, 2024\n\n#84\n\nI'm at the edge of Villafranca and moving out soon.\n\nI moved past the Municipal that come to think of I may have stayed in once and past Ave Fenix so at that point I was committed to keep on walking.\n\nMy feet hurt more than my knees, which still feels super weird.\n\nJabbaPapa\n\n\"True Pilgrim\"\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\n100 characters or fewer : see signature details\n\nJul 10, 2024\n\n#85\n\nDay 22 - - Trabadelo\n\nWell that was tough, but I roughed through and I did it. It's at least a 17K, and my knees still feel normal.\n\nFeet feel like they used to before my knees started demanding all the attention when they first failed.\n\nSo the feet hurt LOL\n\nIf anything had been open at Pereje, I would certainly have bailed there, but everything except for the water fount was shut up tight.\n\nThe last 4K were tougher than the others, and I rested on the concrete security barrier every few hundred yards ; but finally I laid my eyes upon the most welcome spectacle of the village bar, where I partook of two large, chilled, barley restorative beverages.\n\nThe Parroquial is shut today for some reason, and when I got into the Municipal, the pilgrims here were tucking into the main course. Looked tasty, but somehow I still am not hungry at all. I did partake of their tinto. It was tasty. So is this lesser appetite some extra benefit of those barley beverages ?\n\nI do still have half of a chorizo and I had eaten the other half, true ...\n\nKindly anyway, a fellow pilgrim yielded a bottom bunk (top bunk is unfeasible, and whilst it wouldn't bother me in the slightest to sleep on the floor downstairs, this will be more comfy), so I'll be fine.\n\nOh !! I am no longer the slowest pilgrim, in K/day terms that is. One from Cacabelos last night stopped in Villafranca, and I did 9K more. It has ONLY taken me ten years to finally find someone slower than me !!\n\nJabbaPapa\n\n\"True Pilgrim\"\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\n100 characters or fewer : see signature details\n\nJul 10, 2024\n\n#86\n\nMet a lovely French peregrina along the way this afternoon, after SJPP > Santiago, she is now walking Santiago > SJPP.

Which in itself is weird for me, two years ago 11K even as a short day would have been pain-inducing.\n\n11K is just under what my average was in 2021 and 2022. But this was easy !!\n\nAnyway the walk became quite enjoyable after reaching the Valcarce service station. I did have a little difficulty out of Trabadelo until then, but the rest I took there and the help from some cool service station cerveza plus a bench in the shade there was quite restorative.\n\nI've finally stayed at the Albergue here in Herrerías, which was completo for both food and a bed last time back in 2014. The San Julián church porch is still a good place to sleep out here, IIRC it rained last time and I was fine, but I did want to sleep here at least once. The food was great, especially the first course local smoked/cooked ham. They are stingy with the wine though.\n\nToday I'll aim for the Alto do Poio. I am likely still not strong enough for a Triacastela run, as that would be a 30K or so.\n\nJabbaPapa\n\n\"True Pilgrim\"\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\n100 characters or fewer : see signature details\n\nJul 12, 2024\n\n#89\n\nDon't know if I'll make it past O Cebreiro, I am feeling a bit pooped.\n\nNot there yet BTW, but close.\n\nJabbaPapa\n\n\"True Pilgrim\"\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\n100 characters or fewer : see signature details\n\nJul 13, 2024\n\n#90\n\nDay 24 - - O Cebreiro\n\nThe walk up is not difficult ; just long.\n\nI was feeling more sleepy than tired as such, so I stayed here.\n\nThe coach loads of tourists coming to visit the \"famous Paolo Coelho place\" seem finally to be gone, so that apart from some normal day trippers and some people staying in hotels, it's now pretty much locals, people working here, and pilgrims.\n\nI am glad I stopped here anyway, as without those coach loads, the place has regained some of its old atmosphere, from the pilgrim perspective that is. People are happy to be here, in the realisation that their final stretch starts here.\n\nAs to myself, I am sometimes seeing some pilgrims several days, which previously hadn't happened (barring exceptions) since the 1993 - - though I am discounting some of the more egregious bed racers on the 2005.\n\nToday I'll get as far as I get, though I seem to recall that a good stretch of it is not that hard.\n\nJabbaPapa\n\n\"True Pilgrim\"\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\n100 characters or fewer : see signature details\n\nJul 13, 2024\n\n#91\n\nI'm at Alto do Poio, and I have just had a pleasant conversation with a Flemish Belgian Bicigrina who has nearly finished her own Camino from home, and her 1st Camino.\n\nWe compared routes south of Paris, and the surreal experience of getting through les Landes ...\n\nJust resting, then carry on later.

My legs want to stop here, though I have heard that story before ; not convinced.\n\nTriacastela is unachievable, mostly I've just realised because O Cebreiro > Alto do Poio is a harder walk than in the other direction ; in comparison with 2022 when I came close to managing Triacastela > O Cebreiro ... but someone stopped to offer me a lift in his van that time over the last few K.\n\nThe lady in this place here last time was really nice, the one here this evening seems to be a bit of a shrew.\n\nAnyway, I'm carrying on, once my legs calm down - - and then if there's nothing going at the Albergue in the next pueblo down, I'll just hunker down somewhere outside, as there's no chance of rain.\n\nJabbaPapa\n\n\"True Pilgrim\"\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\n100 characters or fewer : see signature details\n\nJul 14, 2024\n\n#93\n\nDay 25 - - Fillobal\n\nThat was a tough 17K, mainly from the terrain.\n\nI am starting to feel confident that I could manage a 20K+ on easier terrain, such as my preferred flat places.\n\nI think my daily average will end up higher than it's been for a while, and it has already increased from 12K - 13K to about 14K.\n\nMy legs feel like they did on my 2005, though of course I'm walking about a third of the daily distances.\n\nI did anyway yesterday decide to simply walk as far as I could get, which is what I used to do on most of that 2005 Camino, and the feeling in the legs is similar - - some pain in the knees too, but just normal from the hiking stress and none from the chronic pain which is still gone.
