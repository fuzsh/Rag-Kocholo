        "text": "Artist: Florence + The Machine\n\nAlbum: Ceremonials\n\nYear: 2011\n\nGrade: B+\n\nIn Brief: Even though How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful was my entry point into this weird and wonderful band, and remains my favorite album of theirs, Ceremonials might just outclass it in terms of consistency and sheer ambition. It’s the point where the music and lyrics best match the scope of Florence Welch’s hauntingly beautiful voice, with each song rising into the night sky like a weird incantation meant to bring all manner of ghosts and spirits out to play. It’s not every day that an artist can play with spiritual warfare as an aesthetic and have me raving effusively about the results.\n\nIs it just me, or was 2011 an absolutely freaking amazing year for music? I feel like more records that I genuinely loved, or at least liked enough to get really excited about, came out that year than any other year in the two decades I’ve been writing music reviews and keeping track of these things. I don’t know if your average music aficionado thinks of albums in terms of when they came out – at least, maybe not down to the exact year, more likely just the era it came out and whatever might have been going on in their life at the time that led them to that music, or that the music helped them to make it through. I’ve remarked on a few occasions that 2011 was quite possibly the worst year of my adult life thus far (though 2020 is currently giving it a run for its money, for reasons I think we can all understand). So I have no great nostalgia for that chapter of my life. Yet there was so much engrossing music that I fell in love with in real time (with absolute stunners from Fleet Foxes and Kathryn Calder topping that year’s list) – and more surprisingly, even more great albums that I slept on and had to tack onto the 2011 list after the fact (see my very recent write-ups on Tennis and The Decemberists for further evidence). When I considered candidates for my Top 100 albums of the last decade, 2011 provided more of them than any other year, with my Top 20 list for that year not even being able to contain them all. (2013 came pretty darn close, though.) Even now that I’ve gone back and reviewed the last of the stragglers that actually made that list, I’ve still got a candidate from 2011 that just barely missed the cut, that I feel compelled to gush about in this month’s “nostalgia review” column. That album is Florence + The Machine‘s hauntingly good sophomore effort, Ceremonials.\n\nNow I’ll be honest – I most likely would not have been enthused about Florence Welch‘s flamboyant eccentricities back in 2011 when this thing was brand new. Even when I finally got up to speed with the band on their 2015 release How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful, it felt like very new territory for me as a listener; something I wasn’t guaranteed to enjoy a full album of, even if a catchy single like “Ship to Wreck” piqued my interest. The crazy thing is, I had heard the insanely catchy lead single from Ceremonials four years prior, and somehow not responded at all to it – Florence + The Machine had been the musical guest on an episode of Saturday Night Live in the fall of 2011 (which I distinctly remember watching because there were Muppets involved), and “Shake It Out” was the first number they played, and somehow I felt nothing. That is ludicrous to me now. Flash forward to 2016, a year or so after I finally decided Florence and her band were up my alley, and all it took was a stripped-down acoustic performance of that song in a hospital room to make me realize what a massively addictive and empowering song it was. (Florence and her guitarist had paid a visit to a terminally ill teenage patient who had hoped to attend their concert but was unable to leave her bed, and a snippet of the performance found its way to social media. It was happy and uplifting as all get-out.) That and an acapella cover of “Spectrum” by a college group called The Nor’Easters (which they had slyly snuck part of “What the Water Gave Me” into as an intro, I later discovered) compelled me to finally break down and take a trip in the wayback machine with this band, quickly consuming both this record and their 2009 debut Lungs. This one has really stuck with me in the years since, becoming one of those records that nags me every time I put it on, as I wonder why my tastes just weren’t refined enough to “get it” when this bad boy first dropped.\n\nOf the four records that Florence + The Machine have released thus far in their career, Ceremonials is easily their most potent. I think it’s the favorite of a lot of their fans, but they’re a diverse band with roots in genres as diverse as classic rock, soul, and baroque pop, so I’d imagine there’s quite a bit of debate every time they put a new one out. Since my first love was How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful, it’s tough for anything else they’ve done to dethrone it, but I have to admit that there are a couple rather subdued low points on that record, and you’ll hear nothing of the sort on Ceremonials, even in the slower-paced ballads. Even on the songs where the instrumentation takes a little while to sneak up on you rather than starting off big from the get-go, Florence is an absolutely massive vocal presence, and the drums, harps, piano, and other bits of instrumentation seem to always rise to match that power, even on the tracks where they don’t start out that way. It’s a remarkably consistent record whose only flaw is that it might be too much at times. Some might regret the band’s decision to tone down their epic tendencies on the records that followed this one, which I guess explains why I was quickly growing enamored with How Big while some fans were writing it off as a retreat from greatness. (It’s really the solid string of four instant classics right out the gate plus a few quirky highlights from the back half that make me rank that album slightly higher, but I guess you can go read that review for the details if you really want to know.)\n\nThe thing is, Ceremonials has the lyrical goods to match its huge sound. Florence is the type of songwriter who has been fascinated with notions of what might lie behind that great curtain separating life from afterlife since day one, and this is the record where she really goes for broke, with all manner of angels and devils and personal demons and lovers being revered as gods before tumbling violently from their pedestals being invoked throughout these twelve tracks. There was definitely a time where it was hard for me to accept all of this as metaphor, rather than thinking a songwriter was actually into some sort of weird, occult-like practices. I’m past that now. I know it’s all kayfabe. But it keeps the emotional stakes intensely high, while also providing ample space for catchy pop choruses (and occasionally even a breezy mid-tempo track that goes down surprisingly easy), and I love it for that. With a record like this one pretty fresh in my mind, you can hopefully understand why the muted performances and limp production of 2018’s High as Hope made me want to throw things in frustration. This is a band that needs to go big or go home, as far as I’m concerned – and Ceremonials is the record where they did that best.\n\nINDIVIDUAL TRACKS:\n\n1. Only If For a Night\n\nAs much as I love this album, I have to admit that the opening track has always felt more like a deep cut to me. A good deep cut, mind you, but definitely the sort of thing I’d expect to hear in the middle of the record rather than at the beginning. The way that it gently fades in on a cascading piano melody, and Florence starts the lyrics off with “And I had a dream about my old school”, makes it feel like she’s continuing a thought that was always in progress The dream turns out to be more about her grandmother, who died when she was 11, with the school as the setting – she’s basically being visited by an apparition who has some advice relevant to her current-day life as an adult, and the song takes a slightly humorous turn as Florence observes, “It was all so strange and so surreal, that a ghost should be so practical.” It doesn’t take long for the big, booming drums to come in, and for the piano chords to pound along dramatically at a similar volume, so even in this relatively more low-key song, there’s quite a bit of tension. but there’s also a quiet grace to it, as evidenced by the strings and harp that do their thing more subtly in the background. Being visited by the ghost of a loved one would be a startling and dramatic experience, but it’s not a threatening one – just one that leads to an epiphany which seems to have changed Florence’s life for the better. (Sidebar: Is this the same grandmother whose suicide Florence referenced in High as Hope’s “The End of Love”? That would be an interesting connection I’d never considered before.)\n\nGrade: B\n\n2. Shake It Out\n\nWhen I really stop to examine this song, quite possibly my favorite track in the entire Florence + The Machine catalogue, I’m surprised that I had such an overwhelmingly positive response to a song that was more or less written in the painful stupor of a hangover. On one level, it’s about realizing how miserable an addiction to alcohol can make you, and resolving to let this be day one of sobriety. But it feels like so much more than that, thanks to Florence’s rafter-shaking chorus that invites audiences to shake off personal demons while dancing their asses off. It feels like the most joyous thing on Earth, despite having been written from such a dark place. Of course, you can’t write a song about shaking if the music isn’t suitably rhythmic, and Florence’s band does an absolutely marvelous job of moving from the somber organ tones of its opening verse to the pounding and rattling rhythm of its anthemic chorus – it’s the type of thing you can hear once and have stuck in your head for weeks after the fact. This is easily the most fun Florence + The Machine song to sing along to due to how the chorus invites listeners to belt out the words, even if the vast majority of us have no hope of keeping up with Florence’s majestic vocal range (particularly when she reaches for those high notes near the end). I’ll admit that every time I sing it, I have to make the mental note that the line is “And it’s hard to dance with a devil on your back“, not “a devil in your pants“, which I guess my brain expects because it rhymes better. But I guess it depends on what sort of addiction you’re hoping to kick. However you interpret it, I hope that it has as uplifting of an effect on you as it has on me, and if you’re struggling with something you just can’t seem to get over, that it gives you the boost of courage you need to declare this the first day of no longer letting that thing control you.\n\nGrade: A+\n\n3. What the Water Gave Me\n\nI can’t really spin this track as anything other than dark and brooding. It’s still got one hell of a chorus – another one of the album’s most compelling, even though I’ll admit the rest of the song has more of a murky quality to it, and the lyrics don’t roll off the tongue as easily as”Shake It Out”. The image of a flood rushing up around a person whose pockets are full of stones, and the mental battle that ensues over whether to fight it or give in and drown, is a haunting one, but fascinating nonetheless. It was inspired in equal parts by a Frida Kahlo painting which (translated into English) is the namesake of the song, and the suicide of author Virginia Woolf – not exactly light, upbeat material, but it works brilliantly with the musical accompaniment, which highlights the sharp contrast between the light, graceful plucking of the harp and the dark, lurching bass and heavy drums. When the song really gets going, there’s some edgy guitar that reminds me of a more typical alt-rock arrangement, but it’s definitely the rhythm section and the harp that are highlighted the most, and there aren’t a lot of songs I can name that feature those things as their lead instruments. Florence gets some great vocal runs in here, particularly with her rolling “yeah”s in the song’s coda, and while this one is over five minutes long, it’s such a strong force of nature that I never have the chance to lose interest.\n\nGrade: A-\n\n4. Never Let Me Go\n\nOne important aspect of this album that I haven’t really highlighted yet is the backing vocals. Sometimes they’re just Florence layered upon herself so that she can split off and do something more improvisational while her clones follow the main melody of a song. Sometimes they’re more angelic and otherworldly. Sometimes they go into full-on Gospel choir mode, keeping a song anchored when Florence’s wild wailing might otherwise run it completely off the rails. That’s sort of what happens in this ballad, which starts off as more of a simple lullaby, with basic but assertive piano chords and a gentle drum loop getting it off to more of a subdued start, while Florence takes her time building up to a more passionate finish. It’s weird for a song like this to feel so comforting on the one hand, and so clear about the life-or-death stakes on the other – it’s like the fate of Florence’s very soul hangs in the balance, entirely dependent on the angels carrying her up to Heaven to be stronger than the cold, cruel ocean trying to drag her down to its depths. Is this a little overly dramatic? Sure. Is it 100% on-brand for Florence + The Machine? You better believe it is!\n\nGrade: B\n\n5. Breaking Down\n\nThe simple piano hook and mid-tempo rhythm of this song might feel more easygoing than the rest of the album has been so far – but don’t mistake that for pedestrian. This is one of those songs where the tone of it might be deceptively upbeat (especially due to the reverb on that piano as its high notes ring out), but the lyrics are actually quite bleak. Florence’s vocals are more reserved throughout most of this song, at times almost a whisper, as she struggles with a depression that has come back so many times to haunt her that it may as well be an old friend at this point. She saves most of her vocal flair for the end, when she jumps up an octave in the chorus, as if moving from passive resignation to active frustration, wondering if there’s anything she can do but let this thing break her over and over again. It’s an inherently sad song, made slightly perverse by the gooey, “Bittersweet Symphony”-esque string section that reverberates throughout most of it. It took me a while to realize how clever this contrast was, and now it’s one of my favorites on the record. I probably would have related to these lyrics more in 2011 than I’d have cared to admit if I had bothered to listen to it back then. But no worries – as I imagine Florence did in the years in between, I got better.\n\nGrade: A-\n\n6. Lover to Lover\n\nMan, even when Florence is singing about having lots of sex, there’s a spiritual bent to it. This is one of those songs that I can appreciate now, but probably would have turned my nose up at nine years ago when it was first released, because the central idea of the song – that she’s been jumping around from one bed to the next and she’s come to believe that Heaven has no place for a person like her because of this – is a pretty difficult one to ignore or explain away. Even more perversely, she’s echoing the influences of soul greats like Otis Redding and Marvin Gaye who in turn were influenced by Gospel music, so basically the whole thing is turning religious music on its head in order to reflect on what it’s like to be on the wrong side of that sinner/saint paradigm a lot of us were raised with. While this one doesn’t have as laser-focused of a melody or a chorus hook as some of the other tracks on the album, it’s still a big emotional moment when she finally comes to terms with this idea that her soul is condemned and she might as well live it up while she’s still alive. Her cries of “That’s alriiiiiiight!” as the song reaches a crescendo are certainly compelling, as are the staccato piano chords, hand claps, and the choir celebrating in response to either her celebration or her lament (depending on your point of view). It’s a little more apparent now what the spiritual warfare implied in “Never Let Me Go” was about, though what’s really striking to me here isn’t her apparent rejection of religion – it’s more the notion that she was apparently taught people who do X, Y, and Z are too far gone too ever be saved that I find tragic.\n\nGrade: B\n\n7. No Light, No Light\n\nThe second single from the album is one that I’m actually surprised was released as one – not that it isn’t a powerfully catchy tune, but the opening minute or so is quite subdued, to the point where if I had the album on shuffle, I wouldn’t immediately have the same spark of recognition – “Oh yeah, it’s this song!” – that I would get from most of the cornerstone tracks on this album. That sort of thing can absolutely kill a single’s chances at radio – but it was nine years ago and this one apparently did alright, so what do I know? Once the song gets going, it’s a powerful freight train, with a seeming army of vocals belting out the chorus, and just about the biggest, loudest drums on an album where that’s no easy feat. You’ll want to shout this one out along with her – “You want a revelation! You want to get right! But it’s a conversation! I just can’t have tonight!” I think the contrast between the subdued opening verse and the massive refrain is a deliberate one – at the beginning of the song it’s almost like she’s whispering a secret, admitting something to herself that is too painful to admit to a lover (or more likely an ex who wants to give it another go with her), but that if she manages to thinly disguise it in the lyrics of a song, it’s easier to admit to her audience than to someone she has a personal relationship with and could actually hurt with that confession. It’s messy stuff – a delicate truth that could cause lasting fallout when it gets dragged out into the light, which is probably why she’s shouting at heaven itself to douse the lights and delay the coming of a new dawn.\n\nGrade: A-\n\n8. Seven Devils\n\nThis is one of those songs where it’s especially important to keep in mind that all the devils and demons she’s singing about are metaphors. Because holy crap, this song would be utterly terrifying if you took it literally – she’s pretty much threatening to bring forth all the wrath of hell to lay waste to someone’s kingdom, dooming herself to destruction in the process. (I’ve heard this one made a hell of a soundtrack for a Game of Thrones promo back in the day.) Really, I think it’s one of those things where you honestly confront just how dark and angry and vengeful your spirit is capable of getting, and them by naming and identifying that feeling, you have a better handle on how not to let yourself succumb to it. This is sort of a fantasy about what would happen if she unleashed her unmitigated wrath on someone who had wronged her, if I understand it correctly. It’s fascinatingly dark, wit the clanging, looping piano melody and the harp ringing out very clearly amidst a maelstrom of swirling vocals, bass, and percussion – the very texture of the music has the feeling of a dark spell being cast, and I find it absolutely gripping. In general, I love the way that the pianos are produced on this album – they always come to the forefront as a very sharp-edged, prominent element, as opposed to a lot of bands that may have a piano or keyboard in an otherwise guitar-based setting, and it gets sort of mused into the background due to how many other things are going on in the mix. Even with no lyrics, I’d find this to be an engrossing instrumental, but when you add Florence’s voice and what might just be the creepiest lyrics she’s ever written, it’ pretty powerful stuff. Maybe not one of my favorites in a conventional sense, but definitely an example of the band being willing to take chances that, for the most part, pay off.\n\nGrade: B+\n\n9. Heartlines\n\nMan, those last few tracks have been dark. Florence was’t oblivious to this fact, and she wrote this song as a deliberate attempt to help balance out Ceremonials with something a bit more buoyant and hopeful. Believe it or not, that’s actually harder for her as a songwriter than the dark and cynical stuff is, because being earnest and genuine without sounding hokey can be tricky for a songwriter more attuned to the dark corners of her soul. I think she and the band pulled off incredibly well on this song, which may not have the loudest drums on the album, but it may just have the most fun drums, especially when combined with the hand claps and the exuberant choral vocals in the chorus. (“Drum Song” from Lungs comes to mind here – the two songs definitely share some DNA.) “Just keep following the heartlines in your hand” is the central encouragement of this uplifting song, which I guess is a nod to palmistry and the idea that the lines on a person’s hand can reveal possible future paths that their lives could take. I don’t think you have to take that belief at face value to get something out of the song, though – I take the message to be “Take the most positive path in front of you, and follow it, despite what the cynics say.” I find it funny that even in a positive song, Florence can’t resist referring to such things as floods and animal entrails in the first verse – in her defense, the flood is a reference to letting a positive feeling like joy overwhelm you instead of fighting it, and I guess the animal thing refers to sacrifices that need to be made? OK, she kind of lost me on that part. Doesn’t matter. Total blast of a song either way.\n\nGrade: A-\n\n10. Spectrum\n\nI think this might be the second most well-known song from Ceremonials after “Shake It Out” – or perhaps I’m wrong and this one turned out to be an even bigger deal, thanks to Calvin Harris remixing it. I’d imagine the remix is the version most people know, which by comparison makes the album version seem a bit more subdued, but you can hear some of the electronic underpinnings in this arrangement that make it logical for a DJ to hear it and go, “Yeah, I could do something pretty cool with this.” I enjoy both versions, though of course I’m partial to the album version because it fits into its surroundings so incredibly well. Coming off of the high of “Heartlines”, this one just kicks the positive feelings into high gear, using a pretty sharp metaphor involving a small army dressed in different colors that is intent on bringing light and color to every corner of a drab, colorless world. It sounds hokey, but I really love how they pull this one off, even sending chills down my spine in the bridge when the “dressed in black” contingent of that army promises to “drag bodies from the ground”. (I see that as a reference to breathing life back into things that felt dead, not literally strewing corpses all over the landscape. Which would totally fit one of this record’s darker songs, but wouldn’t make much sense in this particular context.) I love the consistent harp melody that ascends and descends during this song’s chorus and can be heard as the song fades out, and the consistent march of the drums, even if they’re a little more on the electronic side and not as sharp or loud as they are in most of the other songs. The entire song beams with such a sense of pride in the art of self-expression that I wouldn’t be surprised at all if it had picked up a bit of an LGBTQ fanbase over the years. Because I think this would work pretty well as a coming out metaphor – you’re doing something that is not only a refreshing change for yourself, but that brings light and hope to others who have had to conceal their own truths in the darkness as well. Of course, prisms and rainbows can be used as metaphors for lots of things – it just depends on the angle you look at them from.\n\nGrade: A\n\n11. All This and Heaven Too\n\nThe positive feelings just keep right on rolling in this song, which might have a slight tinge of melancholy to it as Florence laments her conscious mind and her tongue not quite having the language to articulate the things that her heart is feeling – but I figure she must be feeling some sort of strong love or at last attraction, some sort of an enjoyable affection towards another person rather than anything negative – for her heart to ache so badly about not being able to capture it in words. This is one of those deep cuts that I had always enjoyed, but never fully appreciated for how well written it was, or how it went against the impression most of the rest of the album might give a casual listener about Florence’s tendency to always focus on the dark and demonic side of things. At times she’s self-deprecating here, but this might be the one track where there isn’t even a dark or twisted metaphor sneaking in through the cracks at any point. It’s all genuine, heartfelt, bursting-at-the-seams joy, a language she’s still learning to speak without having to use words, and both her vocal performance and her band do an excellent job of filling n those intangible gaps that the words can’t quite cover.\n\nGrade: A-\n\n12. Leave My Body\n\nWe end the album with a bit of a melancholy song about death, which I suppose you could argue brings the full circle since the album opened with a ghostly visit from her grandmother, and now she’s the one anticipating what the permanent out-of-body experience will be like. Unlike earlier tracks such as “Never Let Me Go” and “Lover to Lover” where you can tell she’s really wrestling with the notion of her souls’ ultimate fate, she seems to have no fear here, not even of having to say farewell to the deep attachments she’s formed with people while she was alive. I love how the moody acoustic guitar chords, the stomping drums, and the harp, strings and choir we’ve all come to expect in a full-bodied Florence + The Machine song come together in an aura of mystery and anticipation, not fully revealing what she expects to find on the other side, but with the chorus’s response to her vocals in the chorus making it clear that it she’ll be headed for “higher ground” instead of the alternative. She may have dodged the question of whether she retains any faith or religious belief in the conventional sense, but this song seems to acknowledge an assurance deeper down that death is a transition to something better, rather than a point at which a person meets their doom of just plain cease to exist. So I feel that, even though this is a bit of a moody and fatalistic end to the record, it still communicates an intangible sense of hope, concluding Ceremonials with a sense that she’s confronted death and found surprisingly little to fear about it.\n\nGrade: B+\n\nOf course, there are some pretty good bonus tracks on the special edition of this album as well, if an hour of this sort of high drama doesn’t turn out to be enough for you. Just like on How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful‘s special edition, there are a few cuts that I’m surprised didn’t make the standard edition, most notably the unstoppable force that is “Strangeness and Charm” (which I probably would have titled my review after if it had made the cut). There’s also a rather odd demo of “What the Water Gave Me” that sounds kind of Garage Band-ish with some programmed elements where the grittier drums and bass ended up going in the final version, but it has a bizarre appeal to it, revealing that Florence had a pretty good sense of where she wanted the song to go that early in the process. Ultimately, Ceremonials is a consistent enough listen that I don’t feel as great of a loss for not having a few of those extras in the proper track listing. They’re absolutely worth checking out for the extra-curious who have already taken in the full album.\n\nWHAT’S IT WORTH TO ME?\n\nOnly If For a Night $1\n\nShake It Out $2\n\nWhat the Water Gave Me $1.50\n\nNever Let Me Go $1\n\nBreaking Down $1.50\n\nLover to Lover $1\n\nNo Light, No Light $1.50\n\nSeven Devils $1.25\n\nHeartlines $1.50\n\nSpectrum $1.75\n\nAll This and Heaven Too $1.50\n\nLeave My Body $1.25\n\nTOTAL: $16.75\n\nBAND MEMBERS:\n\nFlorence Welch: Lead vocals\n\nIsabella Summers: Piano, strings, choir arrangements, synth, programming\n\nRobert Ackroyd: Guitar\n\nTom Monger: Harp, bass\n\nChristopher Lloyd Hayden: Drums, percussion, backing vocals (left in 2018)\n\nMark Saunders: Bass, guitar, percussion, backing vocals (left in 2018)\n\nLISTEN FOR YOURSELF:"
