        "meta_description": "Across the Water by SixMileBridge, released 21 February 2017\n\n1. It Was a&#39; for Our Rightfu&#39; King\n2. Súil a Rúin\n3. Under Fiery Skies\n4. Missing You\n5. My Father&#39;s Ship\n6. What I am Thinking\n7. The Witch of The Westmerelands\n8. When Margaret Was Eleven\n9. Erin-go-Bragh\n10. High Tide in Galveston /\n11. Geese Tracks in the Snow / Nekkid Mud Wrestling / Eileen O&#39;Grady\n12. The West&#39;s Awake\n\nFirst album release, the long version:\r\n\r\nAt the close of Ceili&#39;s Muse, after a good six years walking on air from all the love and sense of family that band inspired, Anders and I wanted something a little more powerful and still as gorgeous. The little Ren Faire called Cavalier Dayes brought Wolf Loescher into the picture, a drummer by trade who also rocked the bagpipes, sang and played guitar, and was funny as hell. He gave a lot of consideration to starting over, but I think saw something special in a brand new project, so he decided to move on from the Austin Celtic band Poor Man&#39;s Fortune. At least for a while. \r\n\r\nWith Anders on guitar and bass, me on vocals, bass, violin, Wolf with the Godfoot drums and extras, we needed a foundation. Something to hold it all together on rhythm guitar, but better. The Wednesday night Ceili sessions at the Mucky Duck in Houston had a shy, waif of a starlet in its midst. She was sparkly, never stopped smiling. She didn&#39;t know there was a business end to music, only the joy brought. \r\nHer talent was off the charts, so we all sort of looked at each other and said &quot;What the hell? Let&#39;s ask her.&quot; And so with Frances Cunningham (nee Newton), the first incarnation was complete. The first rehearsal had a synergy that was palpable and almost scary. I had handed Frances my bouzouki and said &quot;would you mind learning to play this please?&quot; No problem. It was smoking under her tiny hands in two weeks. \r\n\r\nWe got the band name after six weeks of pulling our hair out and living in torture. I guess I came up with it, since I had been to Ireland the most. But we all knew in an instant.\r\n\r\nSixMileBridge is a tiny hamlet in County Clare, Ireland, that you may notice on your way from Shannon airport on the way to the Burren and the Cliffs of Moher. Or maybe not. Don&#39;t blink, you&#39;ll miss it. More about why it&#39;s special, read on in the &quot;No Reason&quot; album notes...\r\n\r\nIt was our first record with a brand new studio, completely turn-key and modern. Anders and Wolf, the techno geeks, wanted to use every gadget in the house. I couldn&#39;t help but pull in the reigns sometimes, but everything came together in a really honest, straightforward way that we&#39;re proud of. \r\n\r\nThe debut kicked off several years of non-stop touring, killing it at high-end festivals. It was everything you dream when you live your dream.",

        "text": "1.\n\nIt was a' for our rightfu' King We left fair Scotland's strand, It was a' for our rightfu' King We e'er saw Irish land, my dear, We e'er saw Irish land. Now a' is done that men can do, And a' is done in vain, My Love and Native Land fareweel, For I maun cross the main, my dear, For I maun cross the main. He turn'd him right and round about, Upon the Irish shore, And gave his bridle reins a shake, With adieu for evermore, my dear, And adieu for evermore. The soldier frae the wars returns, The sailor frae the main; But I hae parted frae my Love, Never to meet again, my dear, Never to meet again. When day is gane, and night is come, And a' folk bound to sleep, I think on him that's far awa, The lee-lang night, and weep, my dear, The lee-lang night, and weep.\n\n2.\n\nSúil a Rúin 04:44\n\nI wish I were on yonder hill and there I’d sit and I’d cry my fill and ev’ry tear would turn a mill, and a blessing walk with you, my love I’ll sell my rod, I’ll sell my reel I’ll sell my only spinning wheel To buy my love a sword of steel And a blessing walk with you, my love Siuil, siuil, a ruin Siuil go sochair agus siuil go ciuin Siuil go doras agus ealaigh liom Is go dte tu mo mhuirnin slan (Translation:) Come, come, come, O love, Quickly come to me, softly move; Come to the door, and away we’ll flee, And safe for aye may my darling be! I wish, I wish, I wish in vain I wish I had my heart again, And vainly think I’d not complain And a blessing walk with you, my love But now my love has gone to France To try his fortune to advance. If he e’er comes back, it’s but a chance And a blessing walk with you, my love\n\n3.\n\nUnder Fiery Skies 04:04\n\nHe spent a long time waiting for the storm And when it came, she was beautiful Her hair in wet ribbons drowning her face And she laughed in the rain and sang under fiery skies So wrap her in the finest gauze, and try to hide the subtle flaws That spring like hope, eternal, from her rainy lips and shining eyes And dinna’ try to stay her with the fingers of your hand For the clouds are drawn away by the morning He spent a long time waiting for her hand And when she granted it, he kissed her solemnly And went to book their passage to a far off land Where their fortunes lie awaiting under fiery skies They spent a long life working in the sun And when the evening came, he wrapped his arms around her head And laid her down beside him on the warm, receptive earth And they laughed as the shadows moved across the fiery skies So wrap her in the finest veil, and though the roses turn to pale And spring no longer blossoms in her rainy lips and shining eyes You willna’ have to stay her with the fingers of your hand For the clouds are drawn away by the morning... For the clouds are drawn away by the morning\n\n4.\n\nMissing You 05:20\n\nIn nineteen hundred and eighty six There’s not much for a chippie but swinging a pick And you can’t live on love, on love alone So you sail cross the ocean, away cross the foam To where you’re a Paddy, a Biddy or a Mick Good for nothing but stacking a brick Your best mate’s a spade and he carries a hod Two work horses heavily shod Oh I’m missing you I’d give all for the price of a flight Oh I’m missing you under Piccadilly’s neon Who did you murder, are you a spy? I’m just fond of a drink helps me laugh, helps me cry Now I just drink red biddy for a permanent high I laugh a lot less and I’ll cry till I die All ye young people now take my advice Before crossing the ocean you’d better think twice Cause you can’t live without love, without love alone The proof is round London in the nobody zone Where the summer is fine, but the winter’s a fridge Wrapped up in old cardboard under Charring Cross Bridge And I’ll never go home now because of the shame Of misfit’s reflection in a shop window pane.\n\n5.\n\nMy Father's Ship 03:47\n\nOne evening last summer as I lay down to sleep I saw a lad about six years old at his mother’s knee did weep Saying “Why won’t Father’s ship come in, oh why won’t he come home While other ships are sailing in, spreading the ocean foam?” “He said six months he would be gone leaving you and I alone And through the long dark winter nights six months have passed and gone So why won’t Father’s ship come in, Oh Mother come tell me why Oh why won’t Father’s ship come in, what makes you weep and cry?” “My boy, your father’s long voyage is done you won’t see him anymore For he and his tall gallant ship will never reach the shore For the ship and all her cargo went down in the ocean deep And the sea is rolling mountains high on the graves where they do sleep “Oh Mother if this be true from the grave they will not come And you and I are left alone for to lament and mourn How well can I remember when he nursed me on his knee And brought to me some buds and flowers from off the indian tree.” “My boy, you’re the pride of all my heart” and she pressed him to her breast And closed her eyes to the yonder skies where the weary ones find rest One evening last summer as I lay down to sleep I saw a lad about six yers old at his mothers knee did weep.\n\n6.\n\nWhat I am Thinking 03:30\n\n7.\n\nPale was the wounded knight, Who bore the rowan shield. Loud and cruel were the ravens’ cries That feasted on the field. Sayin’ “beck water cold and clear Will never clean your wounds; There’s none but the Witch of the Westmerelands Can make thee healed and sound.” “So course well my brindled hounds And fetch me the mountain hare Whose coat is as gray as the West water Or as white as the lily fair” Who said, “Green moss and heather bands Will never staunch the flood, There’s none but the Witch of the Westmerelands Can save thy dear life’s blood” “So turn, turn your stallion’s head ‘Till his red mane flies in the wind, And the rider of the moon goes by And the bright star falls behind.” And clear was the pale evening, As his shadow passed him by. And overhead was the brightest star When he heard the owlet cry. Sayin’ “why do you ride this way? And wha'fore came ye here?” “I seek the Witch of the Westmerelands Who dwells by the winding mere.” And it’s weary by Ellswater In the misty brakefern way; And through the crest of the Kirksten Pass The winding water lay. And he said “lie down my brindled hounds, And rest ye, my good grey hawk, And thee, my steed, may graze thy fill For I must dismount and walk.” “But come when you hear my horn, And answer swift the call. For I fear ere the sun shall rise this morn’, You may serve me best of all.” And it’s down to the water’s brim He’s borne the rowan shield; And the goldenrod he has cast in To see what the lake might yield. And wet rose she from the lake And fast and fleet rode she; One half the form of a maiden fair, With a jet-black mare’s body. And loud, long and shrill he blew, ‘Till his steed was by his side; And over head his grey hawk flew, And swiftly he did ride. Sayin’ “course well, my brindled hounds And fetch me the jet-black mare. Stoop and strike, my good grey hawk And bring me the maiden fair.” And she said, “pray sheath thy silvery sword, Lay down thy rowan shield. For I see by the briny blood that flows, You’ve been wounded in the field.” And she stood in her gown of the velvet blue Bound round with a silver chain; And she’s kissed his pale lips once and twice, And three times ‘round again. And she’s bound his wounds with the goldenrod Full fast in her arms he lay. And he has risen healed and sound, With the sun high in the day. And she said, “ride with your brindled hounds at heel, And your good grey hawks in hand; There’s none can harm a knight who’s lain With the Witch of the Westmerelands.”\n\n8.\n\nWhen Margaret Was Eleven 05:49\n\nCredited to Peter St. John My father sailed away, the band played tunes of glory A giant man with ribbons, bedeviled dignity A regimental sergeant, the backbone of the Empire For God and righteous glory bound for High Germany Chorus: Sweet Lord, I was just seven when Margaret was eleven They served us war for breakfast and soldiers' songs for tea \"Your father's gone campaigning\" was a way of not explaining That soldiers are the living proof of our inhumanity My childhood passed away midst the tales and lurid stories Of manufactured glories and inhuman gallantry I asked, \"When is war over?\", but no one deemed to answer me And Margaret played that dreaded tune called High Germany (Chorus) My father made it home, but he came without his reason Two eyes of molten madness, a senseless fool of war \"He's just a child,\" my mother cried, \"to be dressed in full regalia And paraded as a hero home from High Germany\" (Chorus 2x) There'll be no tunes of glory for Margaret and me\n\n9.\n\nErin-go-Bragh 04:30\n\nMy name is Duncan Campbell from the shire of Argyll I’ve traveled this country for many’s the mile I’ve traveled through Ireland, Scotland, and all And the name I go under is bold Erin-Go-Bragh One night in auld Reekie as I walked down the street A saucy great police I chanced for to meet He glowered in my face and he gave me some jaw Saying when came you over, Erin-Go-Bragh? Well, I am not a Pat, though in Ireland I’ve been Nor am I a Paddy, though Ireland I’ve seen But were I a Paddy that’s nothing at all For there’s many’s the bold hero from Erin-Go-Bragh Well, I know you’re a Pat by the cut of your hair But you all turn to Scotsmen as soon as you’re here You left your own country for breaking the law And we’re seizing all stragglers from Erin-Go-Bragh Oh, and were I a Pat, and you knew it were true Or were I the devil, then what’s that to you? Were it not for the stick that you hold in your paw Then I’d show you a game played in Erin-Go-Bragh Then a lump of blackthorn that I held in my fist About his big body I made with a twist And the blood from his napper I quickly did draw And paid him stock and interest from Erin-Go-Bragh Then the people came around like a flock of wild geese Saying “Catch that daft rascal - he’s killed the police!” And for every friend I had I’d swear he had twa It was terrible hard times for Erin-Go-Bragh So come all you young people wherever you’re from Who don’t give a damn to what place you belong I come from Argyle in the highlands so braw But I ne’er took it ill being called Erin-Go-Bragh But I came from a wee boat that sails on the Forth And I packed up my gear and I steered for the north Farewell to auld Reekie, your police and all And the devil go with you says Erin-Go-Bragh\n\n10.\n\nHigh Tide in Galveston / 05:20\n\n11.\n\n12.\n\nThe West's Awake 02:49"
