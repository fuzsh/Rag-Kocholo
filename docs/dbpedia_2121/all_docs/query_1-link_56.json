        "text": "Hunter S. Thompson – “Fear and Loathing in Elko” (1992)\n\n“Fear and Loathing in Elko” is a short story by Hunter S. Thompson\n\nthat appeared in Rolling Stone #622, January 23, 1992. In this sad screed,\n\nour favorite gonzo journalist describes an alleged encounter with\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas, prior to his nomination and appointment to\n\nthe U.S. Supreme Court. Shortly before this story’s publication,\n\nThompson was tried and acquitted on charges of sexual harassment\n\nand assault. He referred to his arrest as a “lifestyle bust.”\n\nThis is in honor of the recent 5th anniversary of Hunter’s passing…\n\n“Fear and Loathing in Elko”\n\nA Wild and Ugly Night With Judge Clarence Thomas…Bad Craziness in\n\nSheep Country…Sexual Harassment Then and Now…A Nasty Christmas\n\nFlashback and a Nation of Jailers\n\nby Hunter S. Thompson\n\n[Part I] Memo From the National Affairs Desk: Sexual Harassment Then\n\nand Now..The Ghost of Long Dong Thomas…The Road Full of Forks\n\nDear Jann,\n\nGod damn, I wish you were here to enjoy this beautiful weather with\n\nme. It is autumn, as you know, and things are beginning to die. It is\n\nso wonderful to be out in the crisp fall air, with the leaves turning\n\ngold and the grass turning brown, and the warmth going out of the\n\nsunlight and big hot fires in the fireplace while Buddy rakes the\n\nlawn. We see a lot of bombs on TV because we watch it a lot more, now\n\nthat the days get shorter and shorter, and darkness comes so soon, and\n\nall the flowers die from freezing.\n\nOh, God! You should have been with me yesterday when I finished my\n\nham and eggs and knocked back some whiskey and picked up my Weatherby\n\nMark V .300 Magnum and a ball of black Opium for dessert and went\n\noutside with a fierce kind of joy in my heart because I was Proud to\n\nbe an American on a day like this. If felt like a goddamn Football\n\nGame, Jann — it was like Paradise…. You remember that bliss you\n\nfelt when we powered down to the farm and whipped Stanford? Well, it\n\nfelt like That.\n\nI digress. My fits of Joy are soiled by relentless flashbacks and\n\nghosts too foul to name….Oh no, don’t ask Why. You could have been\n\npresident, Jann, but your road was full of forks, and I think of this\n\nwhen I see the forked horns of these wild animals who dash back and\n\nforth on the hillsides while rifles crack in the distance and fine\n\nswarthy young men with blood on their hands drive back and forth in\n\nthe dusk and mournfully call our names….\n\nO Ghost, O Lost, Lost and Gone, O Ghost, come back again.\n\nRight. and so much for autumn. The trees are diseased and the\n\nAnimals get in your way and the President is usually guilty and most\n\ndays are too long, anyway….So never mind my poem. It was wrong from\n\nthe start. I plagiarized it from an early work of Coleridge and then\n\ntried to put my own crude stamp on it, but I failed.\n\nSo what? I didn’t want to talk about fucking autumn, anyway. I was\n\njust sitting here at dawn on a crisp Sunday morning, waiting for the\n\nfootball games to start and taking a goddamn very brief break from\n\nthis blizzard of Character Actors and Personal Biographers and sickly\n\nPaparazzi that hovers around me these days (they are sleeping now,\n\nthank Christ — some even in my own bed). I was sitting here all\n\nalone, thinking, for good or ill, about the Good Old Days.\n\nWe were Poor, Jann. But we were Happy. Because we knew Tricks. We\n\nwere Smart. Not Crazy, like they said. (No. They never called us late\n\nfor dinner, eh?)\n\nHo, ho. Laughs don’t come cheap these days, do they? The only guy\n\nwho seems to have any fun in public is Prince Cromwell, my shrewd and\n\nhumorless neighbor — the one who steals sheep and beats up women,\n\nlike Mike Tyson.\n\nWho knows why, Jann. Some people are too weird to figure.\n\nYou have come a long way from the Bloodthirsty, Beady-eyed news Hawk\n\nthat you were in days of yore. Maybe you should try reading something\n\nbesides those goddamn motorcycle magazines — or one of these days\n\nyou’ll find hair growing in your palms.\n\nTake my word for it. You can only spend so much time “on the\n\nthrottle,” as it were….Then the Forces of Evil will take over.\n\nBeware….\n\nAh, but that is a different question, for now. Who gives a fuck? We\n\nare, after all, Professionals….But our Problem is not. No. It is the\n\nProblem of Everyman. It is Everywhere. The Question is our Wa; the\n\nAnswer is our Fate…. and the story I am about to tell you is\n\nhorrible, Jann.\n\nI came suddenly awake, weeping and jabbering and laughing like a\n\nloon at the ghost on my TV set….Judge Clarence Thomas….Yes, I knew\n\nhim. But that was a long time ago. Many years, in fact, but I still\n\nremember it vividly….Indeed, it has haunted me like a Golem, day and\n\nnight, for many years.\n\nIt seemed normal enough, at the time, just another weird rainy night\n\nout there on the high desert….What the Hell? We were younger, then.\n\nMe and the Judge. And all the others, for that matter….It was a\n\nDifferent Time. People were friendly. We trusted each other. Hell, you\n\nafford to get mixed up with wild strangers in those days — without\n\nfearing for your life, or your eyes, or your organs, or all of your\n\nmoney or even getting locked up in prison forever. There was a sense\n\nof possibility. People were not so afraid, as they are now.\n\nYou could run around naked without getting shot. You could check\n\ninto a motel in Winnemucca or Elko when you were lost in a midnight\n\nrainstorm — and nobody called the police on you, just to check out\n\nyour credit and your employment history and your medical records and\n\nhow many parking tickets you owed in California.\n\nThere were Laws, but they were not feared. There were Rules, but\n\nthey were not worshiped….like Laws and Rules and Cops and Informants\n\nare feared and worshiped today.\n\nLike I said: It was a different time. And I know the Judge would\n\ntell you the same thing, tonight, if he wanted to tell you the Truth,\n\nlike I do.\n\nThe first time I actually met the Judge was a long time ago, for\n\nstrange reasons, on a dark and rainy night in Elko, Nevada, when we\n\nboth ended up in the same sleazy roadside Motel, for no good reason at\n\nall….Good God! What a night!\n\nI almost forgot about it, until I saw him last week on TV….and\n\nthen I saw it all over again. The horror! The horror! That night when\n\nthe road washed out and we all got stuck out there — somewhere near\n\nElko in a place just off the highway, called Endicott’s Motel — and\n\nwe almost went really Crazy.\n\nYours,\n\nHST\n\nP.S. And, speaking of crazy, take a look at this riff on the Judge and\n\nSexual Harassment that I received yesterday from that brute who runs\n\nthe Sports Desk. He must have been drunk when he wrote it — but\n\nwhiskey is no excuse for this kind of brainless, atavistic gibberish.\n\nI want that screwhead fired! He was harmless once, but ever since\n\nJudge Thomas got confirmed for the High court, he has been mauling\n\nwomen shamelessly. Last week he pinned my secretary against a hot wall\n\nin the mainframe room and almost twisted her nipples off. Then he\n\nlaughed and said it was legal now, and if I didn’t like it, I could\n\ntake him to court [see enclosed memo, below]. It was addressed to me,\n\nbut I have a feeling we’ll be seeing it soon, taped up on the wall of\n\nthe Men’s Room — and probably the Women’s Room too.\n\nSpecial Advisory From the Sports Desk\n\nTo: HST\n\nFrom: Raoul Duke, Ed.\n\nI need your help, Doc. They’re trying to bust me on Sex charges. The\n\nsnake has come out of the bag, and soon they’ll be after you. Your\n\nphone will be ringing all night with obscene calls from Radical\n\nLesbian Separatists.\n\nYou know how I feel about Victims, Doc, and also how I worship the\n\nFirst Amendment — along with the Fourth, of course….\n\nAnd all of the others, including our God-given Right to praise the\n\nPresident when he pulls off a Great Victory and rips the nuts off the\n\nEnemy. It was wonderful, Doc. We beat them like shit-eating dogs. They\n\ncame, they failed, and now we will gnaw on their skulls. When the\n\ngoing gets tough, the tough get going, eh? Right! Fuck those people!\n\nDeath to the Weird! We will march on a road of bones! Sieg Heil!\n\n(Whoops. Strike that.) What I meant to say was Hot Damn! We’re back\n\nin the Saddle again! And I don’t mean maybe….Right. You know me,\n\nDoc. I’m a gracious Loser — but when I win, I must Kick Ass!\n\nThat is the Law of Nature: Life is a brainless struggle, and “the\n\nMeek” will jabber and die like brain-damaged rats in a maze, long\n\nbefore they will ever have time to even think about inheriting the\n\ngoddamn Earth — much less the White House.\n\nNo. don’t worry about that, Doc. The Nigger is on the run all over\n\nthe World, and we want to keep him that way. (Or “her” or “it” or\n\n“them” if you what I’m saying….) They are not necessarily Black,\n\nDoc, and many are not of our Gender….\n\nBut so what? They are Niggers, and we’re Not! Hell, yes! That’s\n\nwhat it comes down to. They were Fools! It was like the Charge of the\n\nLight Brigade. They rode into the Valley of Death, and We stomped\n\nthem….They were Wrong from the start, but they fooled a lot of\n\npeople, for a while….\n\nThank God we got off that stinking Death Ship while we still had the\n\nchance, eh?….They screeched like Hyenas for a while, but then they\n\nran like Rats. Shit on them. That’s what I say. Those bitches got\n\ntheir tits caught in a wringer.\n\nOkay. Congress is a sinkhole of Whores. We all know that. Shit.\n\nSexual Harassment is what Congress is all about. It was the Way of Our\n\nForefathers, and it is Right!\n\nHot damn: I feel good about Myself today, Doc. I feel innocent for a\n\nchange…. and I guess you feel the Same Way, eh?\n\nJesus. They had us on the run there, for a few days. The Fat Lady\n\nwas ready to sing, and I was starting to guilty about almost\n\nEverything…. Especially touching Women — or even myself, for a\n\nwhile. It was Horrible. It got so I was afraid to ride the same\n\nelevator with a woman. It was too risky. What if she was one of these\n\ncrazy New Age bitches that want to kick you in the nuts and then get\n\nyou busted for “fondling” them?\n\nWhat kind of life would it be if you went to jail or got ruined\n\nevery time you tried to flirt with a pretty woman? Let’s face it, Doc.\n\nWe are all Rapists, one way or another. The trick is not to get Busted\n\nfor it….Which is almost what happened, Doc. BUT IT DIDN’T No! We\n\nwere NOT Guilty! They called us bullies and Mashers, but we were only\n\nfalling in Love….\n\n–Raoul Duke, Sports\n\n[Part II] Fear and Loathing in Elko: Bad Craziness in Sheep\n\nCountry….Side Entrance on Queer Street….O Black, O Wild, O\n\nDarkness, Roll Over Me Tonight\n\nIt was just after midnight when I first saw the sheep. I was running\n\nabout eighty-eight or ninety miles an hour in a drenching, blinding\n\nrain on U.S. 40 between Winnemucca and Elko with one light out. I was\n\nsoaking wet from the water that was pouring in through a hole in the\n\nfront roof of the car, and my fingers were like rotten icicles on the\n\nsteering wheel.\n\nIt was a moonless night and I knew I was hydroplaning, which is\n\ndangerous…. My front tires were no longer in touch with the asphalt\n\nor anything else. My center of gravity was too high. There was no\n\nvisibility on the road, none at all. I could have tossed a flat rock a\n\nlot farther than I could see in front of me that night though the rain\n\nand the ground fog.\n\nSo what? I though. I know this road — a straight lonely run across\n\nnowhere, with not many dots on the map except ghost towns and truck\n\nstops with names like Beowawe and Lovelock and Deeth and\n\nWinnemucca….\n\nJesus! Who made this map? Only a lunatic could have come up with a\n\nlist of places like this: Imlay, Valmy, Golconda, Nixon, Midas,\n\nMetropolis, Jiggs, Judasville — all of them empty, with no gas\n\nstations, withering away in the desert like a string of old Pony\n\nExpress stations. The Federal Government owns ninety percent of this\n\nland, and most of it is useless for anything except weapons testing\n\nand poison-gas experiments.\n\nMy plan was to keep moving. Never slow down. Keep the car aimed\n\nstraight ahead through the rain like a cruise missile….I felt\n\ncomfortable. There is a sense of calm and security that comes with\n\ndriving a very fast car on an empty road at night….Fuck this\n\nthunderstorm, I thought. There is safety in speed. Nothing can touch\n\nme as long as I keep moving fast, and never mind the cops: They’re all\n\nhunkered down in a truck stop or jacking off by themselves in a\n\nculvert behind some dynamite shack in the wilderness beyond the\n\nhighway….Either way, they wanted no part of me, and I wanted no part\n\nof them. Only trouble could come of it. They were probably nice\n\npeople, and so was I — but we were not meant for each other. History\n\nhad long since determined that. There is a huge body of evidence to\n\nsupport the notion that me and the police were put on this earth to do\n\nextremely different things and never to mingle professionally with\n\neach other, except at official functions, when we all wear ties and\n\ndrink heavily and whoop it up like the natural, good-humored wild boys\n\nthat we know in our hearts that we are..These occasions are rare, but\n\nthey happen — despite the forked tongue of fate that has put us\n\nforever on different paths….But what the hell? I can handle a wild\n\nbirthday party with cops, now and then. Or some unexpected orgy at a\n\ngun show in Texas. Why not? Hell, I ran for Sheriff one time, and\n\nalmost got elected. They understand this, and I get along fine with\n\nthe smart ones.\n\nBut not tonight, I thought, I sped along in the darkness. Not at 100\n\nmiles an hour at midnight on a rain-slicked road in Nevada. Nobody\n\nneeds to get involved in a high-speed chase on a filthy night like\n\nthis. It would be dumb and extremely dangerous. Nobody driving a red\n\n454 V-8 Chevrolet convertible was likely to pull over and surrender\n\npeacefully at the first sight of a cop car behind him. All kinds of\n\nweird shit might happen, from a gunfight with dope fiends to permanent\n\ninjury or death….It was a good night to stay indoors and be warm,\n\nmake a fresh pot of coffee and catch up on important paperwork. Lay\n\nlow and ignore these loonies. Anybody behind the wheel of a ca tonight\n\nwas far too crazy to fuck with, anyway.\n\nWhich was probably true. There was nobody on the road except me and\n\na few big-rig Peterbilts running west to Reno and Sacramento by dawn.\n\nI could hear them on my nine-band Super-Scan shortwave/CB/Police\n\nradio, which erupted now and then with outbursts of brainless speed\n\ngibberish about Big Money and Hot Crank and teenage cunts with huge\n\ntits.\n\nThey were dangerous Speed Freaks, driving twenty-ton trucks that\n\nmight cut loose and jackknife at any moment, utterly out of control.\n\nThere is nothing more terrifying than suddenly meeting a jackknifed\n\nPeterbilt with no brakes coming at you sideways at sixty or seventy\n\nmiles per hour on a steep mountain road at three o’clock in the\n\nmorning. There is a total understanding, all at once, of how the\n\ncaptain of the Titanic must have felt when he first saw the Iceberg.\n\nAnd not much different from the hideous feeling that gripped me when\n\nthe beam of my Long-Reach Super-Halogen headlights picked up what\n\nappeared to be a massive rock slide across the highway — right in\n\nfront of me, blocking the road completely. Big white rocks and round\n\nboulders, looming up with no warning in a fog of rising steam or swamp\n\ngas….\n\nThe brakes were useless, the car wandering. The rear end was coming\n\naround. I jammed it down into Low, but it made no difference, so I\n\nstraightened it out and braced for a serious impact, a crash that\n\nwould probably kill me. This is It, I thought. This is how it happens\n\n— slamming into a pile of rocks at 100 miles an hour, a sudden brutal\n\ndeath in a fast red car on a moonless night in a rainstorm somewhere\n\non the sleazy outskirts of Elko. I felt vaguely embarrassed, in that\n\nlong pure instant before I went into the rocks. I remembered Los Lobos\n\nand that I wanted to call Maria when I got to Elko….\n\nMy heart was full of joy as I took the first hit, which was oddly\n\nsoft and painless. No real shock at all. Just a sickening thud, like\n\nrunning over a body, a corpse — or, ye fucking gods, a crippled 200-\n\npound sheep thrashing around in the road.\n\nYes. These huge white lumps were not boulders. They were sheep. Dead\n\nand dying sheep. More and more of them, impossible to miss at this\n\nspeed, piled up on each other like bodies at the battle of Shiloh. It\n\nwas like running over wet logs. Horrible, horrible….\n\nAnd then I saw the man — a leaping Human Figure in the glare of my\n\nbouncing headlight, waving his arms and yelling, trying to flag me\n\ndown. I swerved to avoid hitting him, but he seemed not to see me,\n\nrushing straight into my headlights like a blind man….or a monster\n\nfrom Mars with no pulse, covered with blood and hysterical.\n\nIt looked like a small black gentleman in a London Fog raincoat,\n\nfrantic to get my attention. It was so ugly that my brain refused to\n\naccept it….Don’t worry, I thought. This is only an Acid flashback.\n\nBe calm. This is not really happening.\n\nI was down to about thirty-five or thirty when I zoomed past the man\n\nin the raincoat and bashed the brains out of a struggling sheep, which\n\nhelped to reduce my speed, as the car went airborne again, then\n\nbounced to a shuddering stop just before I hit the smoking, overturned\n\nhulk of what looked like a white Cadillac limousine, with people still\n\ninside. It was a nightmare. Some fool had crashed into a herd of sheep\n\nat high speed and rolled into the desert like an eggbeater.\n\nWe were able to laugh about it later, but it took a while to calm\n\ndown. What the hell? It was only an accident. The Judge had murdered\n\nsome strange animals.\n\nSo what? Only a racist maniac would run sheep on the highway in a\n\nthunderstorm at this hour of the night. “Fuck those people!” he\n\nsnapped, as I took off toward Elko with him and his two female\n\ncompanions tucked safely into my car, which had suffered major\n\ncosmetic damage but nothing serious. “They’ll never get away with this\n\nNegligence!” he said. “We’ll eat them alive in court. Take my word for\n\nit. We are about to become joint owners of a huge Nevada sheep ranch.”\n\nWonderful, I thought. But meanwhile we were leaving the scene of a\n\nvery conspicuous wreck that was sure to be noticed by morning, and the\n\nwhole front of my car was gummed up with wool and sheep’s blood. There\n\nwas no way I could leave it parked on the street in Elko, where I’d\n\nplanned to stop for the night (maybe two or three nights, for that\n\nmatter) to visit with some old friends who were attending a kind of\n\nAppalachian Conference for sex-film distributors at the legendary\n\nCommercial Hotel….\n\nNever mind that, I thought. Things have changed. I was suddenly a\n\nVictim of Tragedy — injured and on the run, far out in the middle of\n\nsheep country — 1000 miles from home with car full of obviously\n\ncriminal hitchhikers who were spattered with blood and cursing angrily\n\nat each other as we zoomed through the blinding monsoon.\n\nJesus, I though Who are these people?\n\nWho indeed? They seemed not to notice me. The two women fighting in\n\nthe back seat were hookers. No doubt about that. I had seen them in my\n\nheadlights as they struggled in the wreckage of the Cadillac, which\n\nhad killed about sixty sheep. They were desperate with Fear and\n\nConfusion, crawling wildly across the sheep….One was a tall black\n\ngirl in a white minidress…and now she was screaming at the other\n\none, a young blond white woman. They were both drunk. Sounds of\n\nstruggle came from the back seat. “Get your hands off me, Bitch!” Then\n\na voice cried out, “Help me, Judge! Help! She’s killing me!”\n\nWhat? I thought. Judge? Then she said it again, and a horrible chill\n\nwent through me….Judge? No. That would be over the line.\n\nUnacceptable.\n\nHe lunged over the back seat and whacked their heads together. “Shut\n\nup!” he screamed. “Where are your fucking manners?”\n\nHe went over the seat again. He grabbed one of them by the hair.\n\n“God damn you,” he screamed. “Don’t embarrass this man. He saved our\n\nlives. We owe him respect — not this god damned squalling around like\n\nwhores.”\n\nA shudder ran through me, but I gripped the wheel and stared\n\nstraight ahead, ignoring this sudden horrible freak show in my car. I\n\nlit a cigarette, but I was not calm. Sounds of sobbing and the ripping\n\nof cloth came from the back seat. The man they called Judge had\n\nstraightened himself out and was now resting easily in the front seat,\n\nletting out long breaths of air….The silence was terrifying: I\n\nquickly turned up the music. It was Los Lobos again — something about\n\n“One time One Night in America,” a profoundly morbid tune about Death\n\nand Disappointment:\n\nA lady dressed in white\n\nWith the man she loved\n\nStanding along the side of their pickup truck\n\nA shot rang out in the night\n\nJust when everything seemed right\n\nRight. A shot. A shot rang out in the night. Just another headline\n\nwritten down in America….Yes. There was a loaded .454 Magnum\n\nrevolver in a clearly marked oak box on the front seat, about halfway\n\nbetween me and the Judge. He could grab it in a split second and blow\n\nmy head off.\n\n“Good work, Boss,” he said suddenly. ” I owe you a big one, for\n\nthis. I was done for, if you hadn’t come along.” He chuckled. “Sure as\n\nhell, Boss, sure as hell. I was Dead Meat — killed a lot worse than\n\nthose goddamn stupid sheep!”\n\nJesus! I thought. Get ready to hit the brake. This man is a Judge on\n\nthe lam with two hookers. He has no choice but to kill me, and those\n\ntwo floozies in the back seat too. We were the only witnesses…. This\n\neerie perspective made me uneasy….Fuck this, I thought. These people\n\nare going to get me locked up. I’d be better off just pulling over\n\nright here and killing all three of them. Bang, Bang, Bang! Terminate\n\nthe scum.\n\n“How far is town? the Judge asked.\n\nI jumped, and the car veered again. “Town?” I said.\n\n“What town?” My arms were rigid and my voice was strange and reedy.\n\nHe whacked me on the knee and laughed. “Calm down, Boss,” he said.\n\n“I have everything under control. We’re almost home.” He pointed into\n\nthe rain, where I was beginning to see the dim lights of what I knew\n\nto be Elko.\n\n“Okay,” he snapped. “Take a left, straight ahead.” He pointed again\n\nand I slipped the car into low. There was a red and blue neon sign\n\nglowing about a half-mile ahead of us, barely visible in the storm.\n\nThe only words I could make out were NO and VACANCY.\n\n“Slow down!” the Judge screamed. “This is it! Turn! Goddamnit,\n\nturn!” His voice had the sound of a whip cracking. I recognized the\n\ntone and did as he said, curling into the mouth of the curve with all\n\nfour wheels locked and the big engine snarling wildly in Compound Low\n\nand the blue flames coming out of the tailpipe….It was one of those\n\nlong perfect moments in the human driving experience that makes\n\neverybody quiet. Where is P.J.? I thought. This would bring him to his\n\nknees.\n\nWe were sliding sideways very fast and utterly out of control and\n\ncoming up on a white steel guardrail at seventy miles an hour in a\n\nthunderstorm on a deserted highway in the middle of the night.\n\nWhy not? On some nights Fate will pick you up like a chicken and\n\nslam you around on the walls until your body feels like a\n\nbeanbag….BOOM! BLOOD! DEATH! So long, Bubba — You knew it would End\n\nlike this….\n\nWe stabilized and shot down the loop. The Judge seemed oddly calm as\n\nhe pointed again. “This is it,” he said. “This is my place. I keep a\n\nfew suites here.” He nodded eagerly. “We’re finally safe, Boss. We can\n\ndo anything we want in this place.”\n\nThe sign at the gate said:\n\nENDICOTT’S MOTEL\n\nDELUXE SUITES AND WATERBEDS\n\nADULTS ONLY/NO ANIMALS\n\nThank god, I thought. It was almost too good to be true. A place to\n\ndump these bastards. They were quiet now, but not for long. And I knew\n\nI couldn’t handle it when these women woke up.\n\nThe Endicott was a string of cheap-looking bungalows, laid out in a\n\nhorseshoe pattern around a rutted gravel driveway. There were cars\n\nparked in front of most of the units, but the slots in front of the\n\nbrightly lit places at the darker end of the horseshoe were empty.\n\n“Okay,” said the Judge. “We’ll drop the ladies down there at our\n\nsuite, then I’ll get you checked in.” He nodded. “We both need some\n\nsleep, Boss — or at least rest, if you know what I mean. Shit, it’s\n\nbeen a long night.”\n\nI laughed, but it sounded like the bleating of a dead man. The\n\nadrenalin rush of the sheep crash was gone, and now I was sliding into\n\npure Fatigue Hysteria. The Endicott “Office” was a darkened hut in the\n\nmiddle of the horseshoe. We parked in front of it and then the Judge\n\nbegan hammering on the wooden front door, but there was no immediate\n\nresponse….”Wake up, goddamnit! It’s me — the Judge! Open up! This\n\nis Life and Death! I need help!”\n\nHe stepped back and delivered a powerful kick at the door, which\n\nrattled the glass panels and shook the whole building. ” I know you’re\n\nin there,” he screamed. “You can’t hide! I’ll kick your ass till your\n\nnose bleeds!”\n\nThere was still no sign of life, and I quickly abandoned all hope.\n\nGet out of here, I thought. This is wrong. I was still in the car,\n\nhalf in and half out…The Judge put another fine snap-kick at a point\n\njust over the doorknob and uttered a sharp scream in some language I\n\ndidn’t recognize. Then I heard the sound of breaking glass.\n\nI leapt back into the car and started the engine. Get away! I\n\nthought. Never mind sleep. It’s flee or die, now. People get killed\n\nfor doing this kind of shit in Nevada. It was far over the line.\n\nUnacceptable behavior. This is why God made shotguns…\n\nI saw lights come on in the Office. Then the door swung open and I\n\nsaw the Judge leap quickly through the entrance and grapple briefly\n\nwith a small bearded man in a bathrobe, who collapsed to the floor\n\nafter the Judge gave him a few blows to the head…Then he called back\n\nto me. “Come on in, Boss,” he yelled. “Meet Mister Henry.”\n\nI shut off the engine and staggered up the gravel path. I felt sick\n\nand woozy, and my legs were like rubber bands.\n\nThe Judge reached out to help me. I shook hands with Mr. Henry, who\n\ngave me a key and a form to fill out. “Bullshit,” said the Judge.\n\n“This man is my guest. He can have anything he wants. Just put it on\n\nmy bill.”\n\n“Of course,” said Mr. Henry. “Your bill. Yes. I have it right here.”\n\nHe reached under his desk and came up with a nasty-looking bundle of\n\nadding-machine tapes and scrawled Cash/Payment memos….”You got here\n\njust in time,” he said. “We were about to notify the Police.”\n\n“What?” said the Judge. “Are you nuts? I have a goddamn platinum\n\nAmerican Express card! My credit is impeccable.”\n\n“Yes,” said Mr. Henry. “We know that. We have total respect for you.\n\nYour signature is better than gold bullion.” The Judge smiled and\n\nwhacked the flat of his hand on the counter. “You bet it is!” he\n\nsnapped. “So get out of my goddamn face! You must be crazy to fuck\n\nwith Me like this! You fool! Are you ready to go to court?”\n\n“Please, Judge,” he said. Don’t do this to me. All I need is your\n\ncard. Just let me run an imprint. That’s all.” He moaned and stared\n\nmore or less at the Judge, but I could see that his eyes were not\n\nfocused….”They’re going to fire me,” he whispered. “They want to put\n\nme in jail.”\n\n“Nonsense!” the Judge snapped. “I would never let that happen. You\n\ncan always plead.” He reached out and gently gripped Mr. Henry’s\n\nwrist. “Believe me, Bro,” he hissed. “You have nothing to worry about.\n\nYou are cool. They will never lock you up! They will Never take you\n\naway! Not out of my courtroom!”\n\n“Thank you,” Mr. Henry replied. “But all I need is your card and\n\nyour signature. That’s the problem: I forgot to run it when you\n\nchecked in.”\n\n“So what?” the Judge barked. “I’m good for it. How much do you\n\nneed?”\n\n“About $22,000,” said Mr. Henry. “Probably $23,000 by now. You’ve\n\nhad those suites for nineteen days with total room service.”\n\n“What?” the Judge yelled. “You thieving bastards! I’ll have you\n\ncrucified by American Express. You are finished in this business. You\n\nwill never work again! Not anywhere in the world! Then he whipped Mr.\n\nHenry across the front of his face so fast that I barely saw it.\n\n“Stop crying!” he said. “Get a grip on yourself! This is\n\nembarrassing!”\n\nThen he slapped the man again. “Is that all you want?” he said.\n\n“Only a card? A stupid little card? A piece of plastic shit?”\n\nMr. Henry nodded. “Yes, Judge,” he whispered. “That’s all. Just a\n\nstupid little card.”\n\nThe Judge laughed and reached into his raincoat, as if to jerk out a\n\ngun or at least a huge wallet. “You want a card, whoreface? Is that\n\nit? Is that all you want? You filthy little scumbag! Here it is!”\n\nMr. Henry cringed and whimpered. Then he reached out to accept the\n\nCard, the thing that would set him free…The Judge was still grasping\n\naround in the lining of his raincoat. “What the fuck?” he muttered.\n\n“This thing has too many pockets! I can feel it, but I can’t find the\n\nslit!”\n\nMr. Henry seemed to believe him, and so did I, for a minute….Why\n\nnot? He was a judge with a platinum credit card — a very high roller.\n\nYou don’t find many Judges, these days, who can handle a full caseload\n\nin the morning and run wild like a goat in the afternoon. That is a\n\nvery hard dollar, and very few can handle it….but the Judge was a\n\nSpecial Case.\n\nSuddenly he screamed and fell sideways, ripping and clawing at the\n\nlining of his raincoat. “Oh, Jesus!” he wailed. “I’ve lost my wallet!\n\nIt’s gone. I left it out there in the Limo, when we hit the fucking\n\nsheep.”\n\n“So what?” I said. “We don’t need it for this. I have many plastic\n\ncards.”\n\nHe smiled and seemed to relax. “How many?” he said. “We might need\n\nmore than one.”\n\nI woke up in the bathtub — who knows how much later — to the sound\n\nof the hookers shrieking next door. The New York Times had fallen in\n\nand blackened the water. For many hours I tossed and turned like a\n\ncrack baby in a cold hallway. I heard thumping Rhythm & Blues —\n\nserious rock & roll, and I knew that something wild was going on in\n\nthe Judge’s suites. The smell of amyl nitrate came from under the\n\ndoor. It was no use. It was impossible to sleep through this orgy of\n\nugliness. I was getting worried. I was already a marginally legal\n\nperson, and now I was stuck with some crazy Judge who had my credit\n\ncard and owed me $23,000.\n\nI had some whiskey in the car, so I went out into the rain to get\n\nsome ice. I had to get out. As I walked past the other rooms, I looked\n\nin people’s windows and feverishly tried to figure out how to get my\n\ncredit card back. Then from behind me I heard the sound of a tow-truck\n\nwinch. The Judge’s white Cadillac was being dragged to the ground. The\n\nJudge was whooping it up with the tow-truck driver, slapping him on\n\nthe back.\n\n“What the hell? It was only property damage,” he laughed.\n\n“Hey, Judge,” I called out. “I never got my card back.”\n\n“Don’t worry,” he said. “It’s in my room — come on.”\n\nI was right behind him when he opened the door to his room, and I\n\ncaught a glimpse of a naked woman dancing. As soon as the door opened,\n\nthe woman lunged for the Judge’s throat. She pushed him back outside\n\nand slammed the door in his face.\n\n“Forget that credit card — we’ll get some cash,” the Judge said.\n\n“Let’s go down to the Commercial Hotel. My friends are there and they\n\nhave plenty of money.\n\nWe stopped for a six-pack on the way. The Judge went into a sleazy\n\nliquor store that turned out to be a front for kinky marital aids. I\n\noffered him money for the beer, but he grabbed my whole wallet.\n\nTen minutes later, the Judge came out with $400 worth of booze and a\n\nbagful of Triple-X-Rated movies. “My buddies will like this stuff,” he\n\nsaid. “And don’t worry about the money, I told you I’m good for it.\n\nThese guys carry serious cash.”\n\nThe marquee above the front door of the Commercial Hotel said:\n\nWELCOME: ADULT FILM PRESIDENTS\n\nSTUDEBAKER SOCIETY\n\nFULL ACTION CASINO/KENO IN LOUNGE\n\n“Park right her in front, said the Judge. “Don’t worry. I’m well\n\nknown in this place.”\n\nMe too, but I said nothing. I have been well known at the Commercial\n\nfor many years, from the time when I was doing a lot of driving back\n\nand forth between Denver and San Francisco — usually for Business\n\nreasons, or for Art, and on this particular weekend I was there to\n\nmeet quietly with a few old friends and business associates from the\n\nBoard of Directors of the Adult Film Association of America. I had\n\nbeen, after all, the Night Manager of the famous O’Farrell Theatre, in\n\nSan Francisco — “the Carnegie Hall of Sex in America.”\n\nI was the Guest of Honor, in fact — but I saw no point in confiding\n\nthese things to the Judge, a total stranger with no Personal\n\nIdentification, no money and a very aggressive lifestyle. We were on\n\nour way to the Commercial Hotel to borrow money from some of his\n\nfriends in the Adult Film business.\n\nWhat the hell? I though. It’s only Rock & Roll. And he was, after\n\nall, a judge of some kind….Or maybe not. For all I knew he was a\n\ncriminal pimp with no fingerprints, or a wealthy black shepherd from\n\nSpain. But it hardly mattered. He was good company (if you had a taste\n\nfor the edge work — and I did, in those days. And so, I felt, did the\n\nJudge). He had a bent sense of fun, a quick mind and no Fear of\n\nanything.\n\nThe front door of the Commercial looked strangely busy at this hour\n\nof night in a bad rainstorm, so I veered off and drove slowly around\n\nthe block in low gear.\n\n“There’s a side entrance on Queer Street,” I said to the Judge, as\n\nwe hammered into a flood of black water. He seemed agitated, which\n\nworried me a bit.\n\n“Calm down,” I said. “We don’t want to make a scene in this place.\n\nAll we want is money.”\n\n“Don’t worry,” he said. “I know these people. They are friends.\n\nMoney is nothing. They will be happy to see me.”\n\nWe entered the hotel through the Casino entrance. The Judge seemed\n\ncalm and focused until we rounded the corner and came face to face\n\nwith an eleven-foot polar bear standing on its hind legs, ready to\n\npounce. The Judge turned to jelly at the sight of it. “I’ve had enough\n\nof this goddamn beast,” he shouted.” It doesn’t belong here. We should\n\nblow its head off.”\n\nI took him by the arm “Calm down, Judge,” I told him. “That’s White\n\nKing. He’s been dead for about thirty-three years.”\n\nThe Judge had no use for animals. He composed himself and we swung\n\ninto the lobby, approaching the desk from behind. I hung back–it was\n\ngetting late and the lobby was full of suspicious-looking stragglers\n\nfrom the Adult Film crowd. Private cowboy cops wearing six-shooters in\n\nopen holsters were standing around. Our entrance did not go unnoticed.\n\nThe Judge looked competent, but there was something menacing in the\n\nway he swaggered up to the desk clerk and whacked the marble\n\ncountertop with both hands. The lobby was suddenly filled with\n\ntension, and I quickly moved away as the Judge began yelling and\n\npointing at the ceiling.\n\n“Don’t give me that crap,” he barked. “These people are my friends.\n\nThey’re expecting me. Just ring the goddamn room again.” The desk\n\nclerk muttered something about his explicit instructions not to….\n\nSuddenly the Judge reached across the desk for the house phone.\n\n“What’s the number? I’ll ring it myself” The clerk moved quickly. He\n\nshoved the phone out of the Judge’s grasp and simultaneously drew his\n\nindex finger across his throat. The Judge took one look at the muscle\n\nconverging on him and changed his stance.\n\n“I want to cash a check,” he said calmly.\n\n“A check?” the clerk said. “Sure thing, buster. I’ll cash your\n\ngoddamned check.” He seized the Judge by his collar and laughed.\n\n“Let’s get this Bozo out of her. And put him in jail.”\n\nI was moving toward the door, and suddenly the Judge was right\n\nbehind me. “Let’s go,” he said. We sprinted for the car, but then the\n\nJudge stopped in his tracks. He turned and raised his fist in the\n\ndirection of the hotel. “Fuck you!” he shouted. “I’m the Judge. I’ll\n\nbe back, and I’ll bust every one of you bastards. The next time you\n\nsee me coming, you’d better run.”\n\nWe jumped into the car and zoomed away into the darkness. The Judge\n\nwas acting manic. “Never mind those pimps,” he said. “I’ll have them\n\nall on a chain gang in forty-eight hours.” He laughed and slapped me\n\non the back. “Don’t worry, Boss,” he said. “I know where we’re going.”\n\nHe squinted into the rain and opened a bottle of Royal Salute.\n\n“Straight ahead,” he snapped. “Take a right at the next corner. We’ll\n\ngo see Leach. He owes me $24,000.”\n\nI slowed down and reached for the whiskey. What the hell, I thought.\n\nSome days are weirder than others.\n\n“Leach is my secret weapon,” the Judge said, “but I have to watch\n\nhim. He could be violent. The cops are always after him. He lives in a\n\nbalance of terror. But he has a genius for gambling. We win eight out\n\nof ten every week.” He nodded solemnly. “That is four of five, Doc.\n\nThat is Big. Very big. That is eighty percent of everything.” He shook\n\nhis head sadly and reached for the whiskey. “It’s a horrible habit.\n\nBut I can’t give it up. It’s like having a money machine.”\n\n“That’s wonderful,” I said. “What are you bitching about?”\n\n“I’m afraid, Doc. Leach is a monster, a criminal hermit who\n\nunderstands nothing in life except point spreads. He should be locked\n\nup and castrated.”\n\n“So what?” I said. “Where does he live? We are desperate. We have no\n\ncash and no plastic. This freak is our only hope.”\n\nThe Judge slumped into himself, and neither one of us spoke for a\n\nminute…. “Well,” he said finally. “Why not? I can handle almost\n\nanything for twenty-four big ones in a brown bag. What the fuck? Let’s\n\ndo it. If the bastard gets ugly, we’ll kill him.”\n\n“Come on, Judge,” I said. “Get a grip on yourself. This is only a\n\ngambling debt.”\n\n“Sure,” he replied. “That’s what they all say.”\n\n[Part III] Dead Meat in the Fast Lane: The Judge Runs Amok…Death of\n\na Poet, Blood Clots in the Revenue Stream…The Man Who Loved Sex\n\nDolls\n\nWe pulled into a seedy trailer court behind the stockyards. Leach\n\nmet us at the door with red eyes and trembling hands, wearing a soiled\n\nbathrobe and carrying a half-gallon of Wild Turkey.\n\n“Thank God you’re home,” The Judge said. “I can’t tell you what kind\n\nof horrible shit has happened to me tonight….But now the worm has\n\nturned. Now that we have cash, we will crush them all.”\n\nLeach just stared. Then he took a swig of Wild Turkey. “We are\n\ndoomed,” he muttered. “I was about to slit my wrists.”\n\n“Nonsense,” the Judge said. “We won Big. I bet the same way you did.\n\nYou gave me the numbers. You even predicted the Raiders would stomp\n\nDenver. Hell, it was obvious. The Raiders are unbeatable on Monday\n\nnight.”\n\nLeach tensed, then he threw his head back and uttered a high-pitched\n\nquavering shriek. The Judge seized him. “Get a grip on yourself,” he\n\nsnapped. “What’s wrong?”\n\n“I went sideways on the bet,” Leach sobbed. “I went to that goddamn\n\nsports bar up in Jackpot with some of the guys from the shop. We were\n\nall drinking Mescal and screaming, and I lost my head.”\n\nLeach was clearly a bad drinker and a junkie for mass hysteria. “I\n\ngot drunk and bet on the Broncos,” he moaned, “then I doubled up. We\n\nlost everything.”\n\nA terrible silence fell on the room. Leach was weeping helplessly.\n\nThe Judge seized him by the sash of his greasy leather robe and\n\nstarted jerking him around by the stomach.\n\nThey ignored me and I tried to pretend it wasn’t happening….It was\n\ntoo ugly. There was and ashtray on the table in front of the couch. As\n\nI reached for it, I noticed a legal pad of what appeared to be Leach’s\n\npoems, scrawled with a red Magic Marker in some kind of primitive\n\nverse form. There was one that caught my eye. There was something\n\nparticularly ugly about it. There was something repugnant in the harsh\n\nslant of the handwriting. It was about pigs.\n\nI TOLD HIM\n\nIT WAS WRONG\n\nBy F.X. Leach\n\nOmaha 1968\n\nA filthy young pig\n\ngot tired of his gig\n\nand begged for a transfer\n\nto Texas.\n\nPolice ran him down\n\non the Outskirts of town\n\nand ripped off his Nuts\n\nwith a coathanger.\n\nEverything after that was like\n\ncoming home in a cage on the\n\nback of at train from\n\nNew Orleans on a Saturday\n\nnight\n\nwith no money and cancer and\n\na dead girlfriend.\n\nIn the end it was no use\n\nHe died on his knees in a barn\n\nyard\n\nwith all the others watching.\n\nRes Ipsa Loquitur\n\n“They’re going to kill me,” Leach said. “They’ll be here by\n\nmidnight. I’m doomed.” He uttered another low cry and reached for the\n\nWild Turkey bottle, which had fallen over and spilled.\n\n“Hang on,” I said. “I’ll get more.”\n\nOn my way to the kitchen I was jolted by the sight of a naked woman\n\nslumped awkwardly in the corner with a desperate look on her face, as\n\nif she’d been shot. Her eyes bulged and her mouth was wide open and\n\nshe appeared to be reaching out for me.\n\nI leapt back and heard laughter behind me. My first thought was that\n\nLeach, unhinged by his gambling disaster, had finally gone over the\n\nline with his wife-beating habit and shot her in the mouth just before\n\nwe knocked. She appeared to be crying out for help, but there was no\n\nvoice.\n\nI ran into the kitchen to look for a knife thinking, that if Leach\n\nhad gone crazy enough to kill his wife, now he would have to kill me,\n\ntoo, since I was the only witness. Except the Judge, who locked\n\nhimself in the bathroom.\n\nLeach appeared in the doorway holding the naked woman by the neck\n\nand hurled her across the room at me….\n\nTime stood still for an instant. The woman seemed to hover in the\n\nair, coming at me in the darkness like a body in slow motion. I went\n\ninto a stance with the bread knife and braced for a fight to the\n\ndeath.\n\nThe thing hit me and bounced softly down to the floor. It was a\n\nrubber blow-up doll: one of those things with five orifices that young\n\nstockbrokers buy in adult bookstores after the singles bars close.\n\n“Meet Jennifer,” he said. “She’s my punching bag.” He picked it up\n\nby the hair and slammed it across the room.\n\n“Ho, ho,” he chuckled, “no more wife beating. I’m cured, thanks to\n\nJennifer.” He smiled sheepishly . “It’s almost like a miracle. These\n\ndolls saved my marriage. They’re a lot smarter than you think.” He\n\nnodded gravely. “Sometimes I have to beat two at once. But it always\n\ncalms me down, you know what I mean?”\n\nWhoops, I thought. Welcome to the night train. “Oh, hell yes, I said\n\nquickly. “How do the neighbors handle it?”\n\n“No problem,” he said. “They love me.”\n\nSure, I thought. I tried to imagine the horror of living in a muddy\n\nindustrial slum full of tin-walled trailers and trying to protect your\n\nfamily against brain damage from knowing that every night when you\n\nlook out your kitchen window there will be a man in a leather bathrobe\n\nflogging two naked women around the room with a quart bottle of Wild\n\nTurkey. Sometimes for two or three hours…It was horrible.\n\n“Where is your wife?” I asked. “Is she still here?”\n\n“Oh, yes.” he said quickly. “She just went out for some cigarettes\n\nShe’ll be back any minute.” He nodded eagerly. “Oh, yes, she’s very\n\nproud of me. We’re almost reconciled. She really loves these dolls.”\n\nI smiled, but something about this story mad me nervous. “How many\n\ndo you have?” I asked him.\n\n“Don’t worry,” he said. “I have all we need.” He reached into a\n\nnearby broom closet and pulled out another one — a half-inflated\n\nChinese-looking woman with rings in her nipples and two electric cords\n\nattached to her head.” This is Ling-Ling,” he said. “She screams when\n\nI hit her.” He whacked the doll’s head and it squawked stupidly.\n\nJust then I heard car doors slamming outside the trailer, then loud\n\nknocking on the front door and a gruff voice shouting, “Open up!\n\nPolice!”\n\nLeach grabbed a .44 Magnum out of a shoulder holster inside his\n\nbathrobe and fired two shots through the front door. “You bitch,” he\n\nscreamed. “I should have killed you a long time ago.”\n\nHe fired two more shots, laughing calmly. Then he turned to face me\n\nand put the barrel of the gun in his mouth. He hesitated for a moment,\n\nstaring directly into my eyes. Then he pulled the trigger and blew off\n\nthe back of his head.\n\nThe dead man seemed to lunge at me, slumping headfirst against my\n\nlegs as he fell to the floor — just as a volley of shotgun blasts\n\ncame through the front door, followed by harsh shouts on a police\n\nbullhorn from outside. Then another volley of buckshot blasts that\n\nexploded the TV set and set the living room on fire, filling the\n\ntrailer with dense brown smoke that I recognized instantly as the\n\nsmell of Cyanide gas being released by the burning plastic couch.\n\nVoices were screaming through the smoke, “Surrender! HANDS UP behind\n\nyour goddamn head! DEAD MEAT!” Then more shooting. Another deafening\n\nfireball exploded out of the living room, I kicked the corpse off my\n\nfeet and leapt for the back door, which I’d noticed earlier when I\n\nscanned the trailer for “alternative exits,” as they say in the\n\nbusiness — in case one might become necessary. I was halfway out the\n\ndoor when I remembered the Judge. He was still locked in the bathroom,\n\nmaybe helpless in some kind of accidental drug coma, unable to get to\n\nhis feet as flames roared through the trailer….\n\nYe Fucking Gods! I thought. I can’t let him burn.\n\nKick the door off its hinges. Yes. Whack! The door splintered and I\n\nsaw him sitting calmly on the filthy aluminum toilet stool, pretending\n\nto read a newspaper and squinting vacantly at me as I crashed in and\n\ngrabbed him by one arm.\n\n“Fool!” I screamed. “Get up! Run! They’ll murder us!”\n\nHe followed me through the smoke and burning debris holding his\n\npants up with one hand….The Chinese sex doll called Ling-Ling\n\nhovered crazily in front of the door, her body swollen from heat and\n\nher hair on fire. I slapped her aside and bashed the door open,\n\ndragging the Judge outside with me. Another volley of shotgun blasts\n\nand bullhorn yells erupted somewhere behind us. The Judge lost his\n\nfooting and fell heavily into the mud behind the doomed Airstream.\n\n“Oh, God!” he screamed. “who is it?”\n\n“The Pigs,” I said. “They’ve gone crazy. Leach is dead! They’re\n\ntrying to kill us. We have to get to the car!”\n\nHe stood up quickly. “Pigs?” he said. “Pigs? Trying to kill me?”\n\nHe seemed to stiffen, and the dumbness went out of his eyes. He\n\nraised both fists and screamed in the direction of the shooting. “You\n\nbastards! You scum! You will die for this. You stupid white-trash\n\npigs!”\n\n“Are they nuts?” he muttered. He jerked out of my grasp and reached\n\nangrily into his left armpit, then down to his belt and around behind\n\nhis back like a gunfighter trying to slap leather….But there was no\n\nleather there. Not even a sleeve holster.\n\n“Goddamnit!” he snarled. “Where’s my goddamn weapon? Oh, Jesus! I\n\nleft it in the car!” He dropped into a running crouch and sprinted\n\ninto the darkness, around the corner of the flaming Airstream. “Let’s\n\ngo!” he hissed. “I’ll kill these bastards! I’ll blow their fucking\n\nheads off!”\n\nRight, I thought, as we took off in a kind of low-speed desperate\n\ncrawl through the mud and the noise and the gunfire, terrified\n\nneighbors screaming frantically to each other in the darkness. The red\n\nconvertible was parked in the shadows, near the front of the trailer\n\nright next to the State Police car, with its chase lights blinking\n\ncrazily and voices burping out of its radio.\n\nThe Pigs were nowhere to be seen. They had apparently rushed the\n\nplace, guns blazing — hoping to kill Leach before he got away. I\n\njumped into the car and started the engine. The Judge came through the\n\npassenger door and reached for the loaded .454 Magnum….I watched in\n\nhorror as he jerked it out of its holster and ran around to the front\n\nof the cop car and fired two shots into the grille.\n\n“Fuck you!” he screamed. “Take this, you Scum! Eat shit and die!” He\n\njumped back as the radiator exploded in a blast of steam and scalding\n\nwater. Then he fired three more times through the windshield and into\n\nthe squawking radio, which also exploded.\n\n“Hot damn!” he said as he slid back into the front seat. “Now we\n\nhave them trapped!” I jammed the car into reverse and lost control in\n\nthe mud, hitting a structure of some kind and careening sideways at\n\ntop speed until I got a grip on the thing and aimed it up the ramp to\n\nthe highway….The Judge was trying desperately to reload the .454,\n\nyelling at me to slow down, so he could finish the bastards off! His\n\neyes were wild and his voice was unnaturally savage.\n\nI swerved hard left to Elko and hurled him sideways, but he quickly\n\nrecovered his balance and somehow got off five more thundering shots\n\nin the general direction of the burning trailer behind us.\n\n“Good work, Judge,” I said. “They’ll never catch us now.” He smiled\n\nand drank deeply from our Whiskey Jug, which he had somehow picked up\n\nas we fled…. Then he passed it over to me, and I too drank deeply as\n\nI whipped the big V-8 into passing gear, and we went from forty-five\n\nto ninety in four seconds and left the ugliness far behind us in the\n\nrain.\n\nI glanced over at the Judge as he loaded five huge bullets into the\n\nMagnum. He was very calm and focused, showing no signs of the drug\n\ncoma that had crippled him just moments before….I was impressed. The\n\nman was clearly a Warrior. I slapped him on the back and grinned.\n\n“Calm down, Judge,” I said. “We’re almost home.”\n\nI knew better, of course. I was 1000 miles from home, and we were\n\nalmost certainly doomed. There was no hope of escaping the dragnet\n\nthat would be out for us, once those poor fools discovered Leach in a\n\npuddle of burning blood with the top of his head blown off. The squad\n\ncar was destroyed — thanks to the shrewd instincts of the Judge —\n\nbut I knew it would not take them long to send out an all-points\n\nalarm. Soon there would be angry police road-blocks at every exit\n\nbetween Reno and Salt Lake City….\n\nSo what? I thought. There were many side roads, and we had a very\n\nfast car. All I had to do was get the Judge out of his killing frenzy\n\nand find a truck stop where we could buy a few cans of Flat Black\n\nspray paint. Then we could slither out of the state before dawn and\n\nfind a place to hide.\n\nBut it would not be an easy run. In the quick space of four hours we\n\nhad destroyed two automobiles and somehow participated in at least one\n\nkilling — in addition to all the other random, standard-brand crimes\n\nlike speeding and arson and fraud and attempted murder of State Police\n\nofficers while fleeing the scene of a homicide….\n\nNo. We had a Serious problem on our hands. We were trapped in the\n\nmiddle of Nevada like crazy rats, and the cops would shoot to Kill\n\nwhen they saw us. No doubt about that. We were Criminally Insane….I\n\nlaughed and shifted up into Drive. The car stabilized at 115 or so….\n\nThe Judge was eager to get back to his women. He was still fiddling\n\nwith the Magnum, spinning the cylinder nervously and looking at his\n\nwatch. “Can’t you go any faster?” he muttered. “How far is Elko?”\n\nToo far, I thought, which was true. Elko was fifty miles away and\n\nthere would be roadblocks. Impossible. They would trap us and probably\n\nbutcher us.\n\nElko was out, but I was loath to break this news to the Judge. He\n\nhad no stomach for bad news. He had a tendency to flip out and flog\n\nanything in sight when things weren’t going his way.\n\nIt was wiser, I thought, to humor him. Soon he would go to sleep.\n\nI slowed down and considered. Our options were limited. There would\n\nbe roadblocks on every paved road out of Wells. It was a main\n\ncrossroads, a gigantic full-on truck stop where you could get anything\n\nyou wanted twenty-four hours a day, within reason of course. And what\n\nwe needed was not in that category. We needed to disappear. That was\n\none option.\n\nWe could go south on 93 to Ely, but that was about it. That would be\n\nlike driving into a steel net. A flock of pigs would be waiting for\n\nus, and after that it would be Nevada State Prison. To the north on 93\n\nwas Jackpot, but we would never make that either. Running east into\n\nUtah was hopeless. We were trapped. They would run us down like dogs.\n\nThere were other options, but not all of them were mutual. The Judge\n\nhad his priorities, but they were not mine. I understood that me and\n\nthe Judge were coming up on a parting of the ways. This made me\n\nnervous. There were other options, of course, but they were all High\n\nRisk. I pulled over and studied the map again. the Judge appeared to\n\nbe sleeping, but I couldn’t be sure. He still had the Magnum in his\n\nlap.\n\nThe Judge was getting to be a problem. There was no way to get him\n\nout of the car without violence. He would not go willingly into the\n\ndark and stormy night. The only other way was to kill him, but that\n\nwas out of the question as long as he had the gun. He was very quick\n\nin emergencies. I couldn’t get the gun away from him, and I was not\n\nabout to get into an argument with him about who should have the\n\nweapon. If I lost, he would shoot me in the spine and leave me in the\n\nroad.\n\nI was getting too nervous to continue without chemical assistance. I\n\nreached under the seat for my kit bag, which contained five or six\n\nSpansules of Black Acid. Wonderful, I thought. This is just what I\n\nneed. I ate one and went back to pondering the map. There was a place\n\ncalled Deeth, just ahead, where a faintly marked side road appeared to\n\nwander uphill through the mountains and down along a jagged ridge into\n\nJackpot from behind. Good, I thought, this is it. We could sneak into\n\nJackpot by dawn.\n\nJust then I felt a blow on the side of my head as the Judge came\n\nawake with a screech, flailing his arms around him like he was coming\n\nout of nightmare. “What’s happening, goddamnit?” he said. “Where are\n\nwe? They’re after us.” He was jabbering in a foreign language that\n\nquickly lapsed into English as he tried to aim the gun. “Oh, God,” he\n\nscreamed, “They’re right on top of us. Get moving, goddamnit. I’ll\n\nkill every bastard I see.”\n\nHe was coming out of a nightmare. I grabbed him by the neck and put\n\nhim in a headlock until he went limp. I pulled him back up in the seat\n\nand handed him a Spansule of acid. “Here, Judge, take this,” I said.\n\n“It’ll calm you down.”\n\nHe swallowed the pill and said nothing as I turned onto the highway\n\nand stood heavily on the accelerator. We were up to 115 when a green\n\nexit sign that said DEETH NO SERVICES loomed suddenly out of the rain\n\njust in front of us. I swerved hard to the right and tried to hang on.\n\nBut it was no use. I remember the sound of the Judge screaming as we\n\nlost control and went into a full 360-degree curl and then backwards\n\nat seventy-five or eighty through a fence and into a pasture.\n\nFor some reason the near-fatal accident had a calming effect on the\n\nJudge. Or maybe it was the acid. I didn’t care one way or the other\n\nafter I took the gun from his hand. He gave it up without a fight. He\n\nseemed to be more interested in reading the road signs and listening\n\nto the radio. I knew that if we could slip into jackpot the back way,\n\nI could get the car painted any color I wanted in thirty-three minutes\n\nand put the Judge on a plane. I knew a small private airstrip there,\n\nwhere nobody asks too many questions and they’ll take a personal\n\ncheck.\n\nAt dawn we drove across the tarmac and pulled up to a seedy-looking\n\noffice marked AIR JACKPOT EXPRESS CHARTER COMPANY. “This is it Judge,”\n\nI said and slapped him on the back. “This is where you get off.” He\n\nseemed resigned to his fate until the woman behind the front desk told\n\nhim there wouldn’t be a flight to Elko until lunch time.\n\n“Where is the pilot?” he demanded.\n\n“I am the pilot,” the woman said, “but I can’t leave until Debby\n\ngets her to relieve me.”\n\n“Fuck this!” the Judge shouted. “Fuck lunch time. I have to leave\n\nnow, you bitch.”\n\nThe woman seemed truly frightened by his mood swing, and when the\n\nJudge leaned in and gave her a taste of the long knuckle, she\n\ncollapsed and began weeping uncontrollably. “There’s more where that\n\ncame from,” he told her. “Get up! I have to get out of here now.”\n\nHe jerked her out from behind the desk and was dragging her toward\n\nthe plane when I slipped out the back door. It was daylight now. The\n\ncar was nearly out of gas, but that wasn’t my primary concern. The\n\npolice would be here in minutes, I thought. I’m doomed. But then, as I\n\npulled onto the highway, I saw a sign that said, WE PAINT ALL NIGHT.\n\nAs I pulled into the parking lot, the Jackpot Express plane passed\n\noverhead. So long, Judge, I thought to myself. You’re a brutal hustler\n\nand a Warrior and a great copilot, but you know how to get your way.\n\nYou will go far in the world.\n\n[Part IV] Epilogue: Christmas Dreams and Cruel Memories…Nation of\n\nJailers…Stand Back! The Judge Will See You Now\n\nThat’s about it for now, Jann. This story is too depressing to have\n\nto confront professionally in these morbid weeks before Christmas….I\n\nhave only vague memories of what it’s like there in New York, but\n\nsometimes I have flashbacks about how it was to glide in perfect\n\nspeedy silence around the ice rink in front of NBC while junkies and\n\nfederal informants in white beards and sleazy red jumpsuits worked the\n\ncrowd mercilessly for nickels and dollars and dimes covered with Crack\n\nresidue.\n\nI remember one Christmas morning in Manhattan when we got into the\n\nEmpire State Building and went up to the Executive Suite of some\n\nfamous underwear company and shoved a 600-pound red, tufted-leather\n\nImperial English couch out of a corner window on something like the\n\neighty-fifth floor….The wind caught it, as I recall, and it sort of\n\ndrifted around the corner onto Thirty-fourth Street, picking up speed\n\non its way down, and hit the striped awning of a Korean market, you\n\nknow, the kind that sells everything from kimchi to Christmas trees.\n\nThe impact blasted watermelons and oranges and tomatoes all over the\n\nsidewalk. We could barely see the impact from where we were, but I\n\nremember a lot of activity on the street when we came out of the\n\nelevator…. It looked like a war zone. A few gawkers were standing\n\naround in a blizzard, muttering to each other and looking dazed. They\n\nthought it was an underground explosion — maybe a subway or a gas\n\nmain.\n\nJust as we arrived on the scene, a speeding cab skidded on some\n\nwatermelons and slammed into a Fifth Avenue bus and burst into flames.\n\nThere was a lot of screaming and wailing of police sirens Two cops\n\nbegan fighting with a gang of looters who had emerged like ghosts out\n\nof the snow and were running off with hams and turkeys and big jars of\n\ncaviar….Nobody seemed to think it was strange. What the hell? Shit\n\nhappens. Welcome to the Big Apple. Keep alert. Never ride in open cars\n\nor walk to too close to a tall building when it snows ….There were\n\nChristmas trees scattered all over the street and cars were stopping\n\nto grab them and speeding away. We stole one and took it to Missy’s\n\nplace on the Bowery, because we knew she didn’t have one. But she\n\nwasn’t home, so we put the tree out on the fire escape and set it on\n\nfire with kerosene.\n\nThat’s how I remember New York, Jann. It was always a time of angst\n\nand failure and turmoil. Nobody ever seemed to have any money on\n\nChristmas. Even rich people were broke and jabbering frantically on\n\ntheir telephones about Santa Claus and suicide or joining a church\n\nwith no rules….The snow was clean and pretty for the first twenty or\n\nthirty minutes around dawn, but after that it was churned into filthy\n\nmush by drunken cabbies and garbage compactors and shitting dogs.\n\nAnybody who acted happy on Christmas was lying — even the ones were\n\ngetting paid $500 an hour….The Jews were especially sulky, and who\n\ncould blame them? The birthday of Baby Jesus is always a nervous time\n\nfor people who know that ninety days later they will be accused of\n\nmurdering him.\n\nSo what? We have our own problems, eh? Jesus! I don’t know how you\n\ncan ride all those motorcycles around in the snow, Jann. Shit, we can\n\nall handle the back wheel coming loose in a skid. But the front wheel\n\nis something else — and that’s what happens when it snows. WHACKO.\n\nOne minute you feel as light and safe as a snowflake, and the next\n\nminute you’re sliding sideways under the wheels of a Bekins\n\nvan….Nasty traffic jams, horns honking, white limos full of naked\n\nJesus freaks going up on the sidewalk in low gear to get around you\n\nand the mess you made on the street…Goddamn this scum. They are more\n\nand more in the way. And why aren’t they home with their families on\n\nXmas? Why do they need to come out here and die on the street like\n\niron hamburgers?\n\nI hate these bastards, Jann. And I suspect you feel the same….They\n\nmight call us bigots, but at least we are Universal bigots. Right?\n\nShit on those people. Everybody you see these days might have the\n\npower to get you locked up….Who knows why? They will have reasons\n\nstraight out of some horrible Kafka story, but in the end it won’t\n\nmatter any more than a full moon behind clouds. Fuck them.\n\nChristmas hasn’t changed much in twenty-two years, Jann — not even\n\n2000 miles west and 8000 feet up in the Rockies. It is still a day\n\nthat only amateurs can love. It is all well and good for children and\n\nacid freaks to still believe in Santa Claus — but it is still a\n\nprofoundly morbid day for us working professionals. It is unsettling\n\nto know that one out of every twenty people you meet on Xmas will be\n\ndead this time next year….Some people can accept this, and some\n\ncan’t. That is why God made whiskey, and also why Wild Turkey comes in\n\n$300 shaped canisters during most of the Christmas season, and also\n\nwhy criminal shitheads all over New York City will hit you up for $100\n\ntips or they’ll twist your windshield wipers into spaghetti and\n\nurinate on your door handles.\n\nPeople all around me are going to pieces, Jann. My whole support\n\nsystem has crumbled like wet sugar cubes. That is why I try never to\n\nemploy anyone over the age of twenty. Every Xmas after that is like\n\nanother notch down on the ratchet, or maybe a few more teeth off the\n\nflywheel….I remember on Xmas in New York when I was trying to sell a\n\nMark VII Jaguar with so many teeth off the flywheel that the whole\n\ndrivetrain would lock up and whine every time I tried to start the\n\nengine for a buyer….I had to hire gangs of street children to muscle\n\nthe car back and forth until the throw-out gear on the starter was\n\nlined up very precisely to engage the few remaining teeth on the\n\nflywheel. On some days I would leave the car idling in a fireplug zone\n\nfor three or four hours at a time and pay the greedy little bastards a\n\ndollar an hour to keep it running and wet-shined with fireplug water\n\nuntil a buyer came along.\n\nWe got to know each other pretty well after nine or ten weeks, and\n\nthey were finally able to unload it on a rich artist who drove as far\n\nas the toll plaza at the far end of the George Washington Bridge,\n\nwhere the engine seized up and exploded like a steam bomb. “They had\n\nto tow it away with a firetruck,” he said. “Even the leather seats\n\nwere on fire. They laughed at me.”\n\nThere is more and more Predatory bullshit in the air these days.\n\nYesterday I got a call from somebody who said I owed money to Harris\n\nWofford, my old friend from the Peace Corps. We were in Sierra Leone\n\ntogether.\n\nHe came out of nowhere like a heat-seeking missile and destroyed the\n\nU.S. Attorney General in Pennsylvania. It was Wonderful. Harris is a\n\nSenator now, and the White House creature is not. Thornburgh blew a\n\nforty-four point lead in three weeks, like Humpty Dumpty….WHOOPS!\n\nOff the wall like a big Lizard egg. The White House had seen no need\n\nfor a safety net.\n\nIt was a major disaster for the Bush brain trust and every GOP\n\npolitical pro in America, from the White House all the way down to\n\nCity Hall in places like Denver and Tupelo. The whole Republican party\n\nwas left stunned and shuddering like a hound dog passing a peach\n\npit….At least that’s what they said in Tupelo, where one of the\n\nlocal GOP chairmen flipped out and ran off to Biloxi with a fat young\n\nboy from one of the rich local families….then he tried to blame it\n\non Harris Wofford when they arrested him in Mobile for aggravated\n\nSodomy and kidnapping. He was ruined, and his Bail was only $5000, but\n\nnone of his friends would sign for it. They were mainly professional\n\nRepublicans and bankers who had once been in the Savings and Loan\n\nbusiness, along with Neil Bush the manqu‚ son of the President.\n\nNeil had just walked on a serious Fraud bust in Colorado. But only\n\nby the skin of his teeth, after his father said he would have to\n\nabandon him to a terrible fate in the Federal Prison System if his son\n\nwas really a crook. The evidence was overwhelming, but Neil had a\n\ngiddy kind of talent negotiating — like Colonel North and the\n\nAdmiral, who also walked….It was shameless and many people bitched.\n\nBut what the fuck do they expect from a Party of high-riding Darwinian\n\nrich boys who’ve been running around in the White House for twelve\n\nstraight years? They can do whatever they want, and why not. “These\n\nare Good Boys,” John Sununu once said of this staff. “They only shit\n\nin the pressroom.”\n\nWell…Sununu is gone now, and so is Dick Thornburgh, who is\n\ncurrently seeking night work in the bank business somewhere on the\n\noutskirts of Pittsburgh. It is an ugly story. He decided to go out on\n\nhis own — like Lucifer, who plunged into Hell — and he got beaten\n\nlike a redheaded stepchild by my old Peace Corps buddy Harris Wofford,\n\nwho caught him from behind like a bull wolverine so fast that\n\nThornburgh couldn’t even get out of the way….He was mangled and\n\nhumiliated. It was the worst public disaster since Watergate.\n\nThe GOP was plunged into national fear. How could it happen? Dick\n\nThornburgh had sat on the right hand of God. As AG, he had stepped out\n\nlike some arrogant Knight form the Round Table and declared that his\n\nboys — 4000 or so Justice Department prosecutors — were no longer\n\nsubject to the rules of the Federal Court System.\n\nBut he was wrong, And now Wofford is using Thornburghs’s corpse as a\n\nlanding pad for a run on the White House and hiring experts to collect\n\nbogus debts from old buddies like me. Hell, I like the idea of Harris\n\nbeing President. He always seemed honest and I knew he was smart, but\n\nI am leery of giving him money.\n\nThat is politics in the 1990s. Democratic presidential candidates\n\nhave not been a satisfying investment recently. Camelot was thirty\n\nyears ago, and we still don’t know who killed Jack Kennedy. That lone\n\nbullet on the stretcher in Dallas sure as hell didn’t pass through two\n\nhuman bodies, but it was the one that pierced the heart of the\n\nAmerican Dream in our century, maybe forever.\n\nCamelot is on Court TV now, limping into Rehab clinics and forced to\n\ndeny low-rent Rape accusations in the same sweaty West Palm Beach\n\ncourthouse where Roxanne Pulitzer went on trial for fucking a trumpet\n\nand lost.\n\nIt has been a long way down — not just for the Kennedys and the\n\nDemocrats, but for all the rest of us. Even the rich and the powerful,\n\nwho are coming to understand that change can be quick in the Nineties\n\nand one of these days it will be them in the dock on TV, fighting\n\ndesperately to stay out of prison.\n\nTake my word for it. I have been there, and it gave me an eerie\n\nfeeling…. Indeed. There are many cells in the mansion, and more are\n\nbeing added every day. We are becoming a nation of jailers.\n\nAnd that’s about it for now, Jann. Christmas is on us and it’s all\n\ndownhill from here on….At least until Groundhog Day, which is\n\nsoon….So, until then, at least, take my advice as your family\n\ndoctor, and don’t do anything that might cause either one of us to\n\nhave to appear before the Supreme Court of the United States. If you\n\nknow what I’m saying….\n\nYes. He is Up There, Jann. The Judge. And he will be there for a\n\nlong time, waiting to gnaw on our skulls….Right. put that in your\n\nleather pocket the next time you feel like jumping on your new\n\nmotorcycle and screwing it all the way over thru traffic and passing\n\ncop cars at 140.\n\nRemember F.X. Leach. He crossed the Judge, and he paid a terrible\n\nprice….And so will you, if you don’t slow down and quit harassing\n\nthose girls in your office. The Judge is in charge now, and He won’t\n\ntolerate it. Beware.\n\n-To Be Continued-\n\nHunter S. Thompson"
