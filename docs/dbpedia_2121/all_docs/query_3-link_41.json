        "text": "Former management company of World acclaimed DJs such as Sasha, John Digweed & Carl Cox 7pm Management announce the addition of Multi million selling DJ, writer and Producer Mark Hill (The Original Artful Dodger) to the companies roster which also Includes artists such as rock bands REEF and Skindred.\n\nHaving Sold over 20 Million records Worldwide its hard to believe that its been over 2 decades, since Mark rose to fame as one half of the Artful Dodger and co-writer/producer for Craig David’s multi platinum album, Born to Do it. Aside from this Mark has also won Four Ivor Novello Awards, a Mobo Award and has co-written 2 number 1 singles and a number 1 album.\n\nThe first Artful Dodger release ‘Rewind’, originally a white label considered by many to signify the cross over of Garage from the underground to the mainstream, is still being played across TV, Radio and in clubs worldwide to this day. Artful Dodger then went from strength to strength after the success of ‘Rewind’, with ‘Movin’ Too Fast’, ‘Woman Trouble’ (featuring Craig David and Robbie Craig), followed by the now classic album, ‘It’s All About The Stragglers’.\n\nOver the last 20 years Mark has owned and run several record labels, a publishing company and has worked with the likes of Corinne Bailey Rae, Becky Hill, MNEK and Ed Sheeran to name just a few. As Artful Dodger Mark recently received a cheeky mention on ‘Closer To My Dreams’, by Drake on one of his mix tapes and was also recently sampled by Justin Bieber who then posted on TikTok singing along to Fill Me In. Over the last few years Mark Hill remixes have included Sam Smith, Mark Ronson, The 1975 and Jack Garratt to name but a few. The 1975 even had Mark DJ at both their album launch party and their more recent after show at Alexandra Palace.\n\n7pm Management Managing Director Seven Webster said,\n\n“Both my business partner Steve Wolfe (Former MCA Records Global Director of A&R) and I still love to work with great producer / DJs of which to us Mark is right up there with the very best of them. He is a brilliant writer producer and DJ and with pop having quite a leaning towards 2 step at the moment the time could not be more right for a producer and writer such as Mark.”\n\nMark has recently set up a new studio in Cornwall where he is busy working on a number of soon to be released projects and he has also just launched a weekly Radio show on Rewind Cornwall.
