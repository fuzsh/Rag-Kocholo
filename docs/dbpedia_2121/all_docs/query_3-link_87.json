        "text": "It's been a grand total of 25 days since Zach Bryan released his widely acclaimed fifth studio album, The Great American Bar Scene, and he's already teasing new music.\n\nZach Bryan's dizzyingly prolific output is one of the many factors that has fuelled his ascent towards the pinnacle of the genre, with Zach having released four albums (including his live project), two EPs and five additional singles since 2022.\n\nAlthough his latest teaser does not have an official name, the title appears to be something along the lines of âRaining in My Mindâ, with the Oklahoma singer-songwriter wistfully likening the transience of love and loss to that of lightning strikes during the night.\n\nAlongside bright instrumentation that feels considerably more joyful than much of The Great American Bar Scene, Zach croons, âThe weather's hot, the sun it shines / Used to call a love of mine / That's why it is raining in my mind / Love and loss and lightning strikes / All seem the same at night / Short and quick and never the same twiceâ.\n\nZach Bryan hasn't shared any details about this new track, with the âSomething in the Orangeâ hitmaker simply writing âlove and loss and [lightnin] strikesâ in the caption of the video, but fans are hoping it's a sign he's readying one of his trademark post-album EPs.\n\nZach has followed up both 2022's American Heartbreak and his self-titled 2023 record with the surprise Summertime Blues and Boys of Faith EPs respectively, the latter of which featured blockbuster duets with folk giants, Bon Iver and Noah Kahan.\n\nBoth Summertime Blues and Boys of Faith arrived within a couple of months of their preceding albums, and we're hoping Zach is currently gearing up to follow-up The Great American Bar Scene with another EP featuring this newly unveiled offering.\n\nWhen the tracklist for The Great American Bar Scene was revealed, there were a handful of notable omissions, ranging from the long-teased âSunday Afternoonâ to âFine Dryâ.\n\nMight Zach Bryan give these stragglers a home on a new EP? When it comes to his teasers, you never really know. One thing's clear, however: Zach isn't taking any time away from the writing room after The Great American Bar Scene - and we're not complaining.\n\nFor more on Zach Bryan, see below:"
