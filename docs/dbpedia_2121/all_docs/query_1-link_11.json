        "text": "Once again, all I can say is “thank you” for being kind enough to take the time to help me (a total stranger) out with all this. I had to plow through many similar forums before finally finding you—-the first person who has actually been able to post any meaningful, intelligent solutions to my plight. Not that I haven’t been grateful for all the other kind souls who’ve tried to help me, but who, frankly, didn’t really know what they were talking about (which I now see in retrospect).\n\nYour pronouncement that Nero’s normalize function is “useless” is sound (no pun intended!), and something I hadn’t even considered—-even though the evidence was clearly before me. And now, thanks to you, I have a much better understanding of MP3Gain’s Album Gain function, and realize that the “nice, uniform volume” I thought I was achieving with all my non-album tracks was just an illusion based on ignorance. It makes sense that Album Gain simply won’t work on non-album tracks, no matter what the numbers show.\n\nUnfortunately, I don’t have access to any original CD data, as 95% of my entire mp3 collection comes from free downloading off the web. (Ooops! Did I just admit to a crime?). So it looks like my using foobar2000 isn’t an option for me.\n\nIn your most recent post, you state that if I simply must use mp3 source files for this operation (which I must!), then I really only have two choices: live with the clipping, or choose a target volume that is much lower, to avoid clipping. But, with all due respect, it would appear as though neither choice is going to be satisfactory—-and here’s why (once again using the same example I cited in my previous post):\n\nI've collected 60 tracks of one of my favorite ambient artists, and I'd like to create a \"Best Of\" series of CDs—6 CDs with 10 long tracks on each. When doing a Track Analysis of these files (as they were when I originally downloaded them off the web), I got a dB range of 77.8 to 92.3, and I noticed that 22 of these 60 tracks were clipped. When I set 89.0 dB as my target volume, select the \"Don't Clip When Doing Track Gain\" option, and apply Track Gain to these files, I now get a dB range of 83.8 to 89.7—and the 22 tracks are still clipped. I suppose I can accept the clipping, but this new dB range is still unacceptable because of the too-great-of-a-variance between volume levels (as much as 5.9 dB!), which will be quite noticeable when listening to the CDs.\n\nIn order for me to remove the clipping from all 22 of these tracks I’d need to set my target volume all the way down to 84.6 dB, which is simply way too low! But even if I did this, there’s still going to be a huge volume variance between many of the tracks. So it would appear I’m damned no matter which of the two choices I make! Is this the price ANYONE pays who doesn’t use the original CD data as their source? Are they always going to be adjusting the volume no mater what they do? Is most of the data in your personal audio collection from CDs, meaning that you don’t ever run into this problem?\n\nAt this point, I suppose I’m going to choose to do the following:\n\nI’m going to accept the fact that Nero’s “normalize,” function is useless, so it doesn’t exist for me. I’m going to set my dB target value at 89.0 and accept the fact that the dB range for my 60 tunes is actually going to be 83.8 to 89.7, with as much as a 5.9 variance in volume between some of these tunes—-which means that I’m going to be adjusting the volume quite a few times while listening to my CDs. Since I don’t want to set my dB target value all the way down to 84.6, to remove clipping from all 22 of the clipped tracks, I’m going to accept the fact that 22 of these tunes are going to be clipped.\n\nIf this is indeed my choice, are you telling me that this is the best I’m going to be able to achieve—-if I insist on using mp3 source files like most everyone else I know does?\n\nAs far as MP3Gain’s “Don't Clip When Doing Track Gain\" option is concerned: If I select this option when doing Track Gain, will it serve only to bring these 22 tracks down to 84.6 dB, which I don’t want? (Meaning, do I never choose this option if I’m going to accept clipping?)\n\nIt would seem to me that all the CDs I’ve already burned with Nero’s “normalize” box checked, and before I used MP3Gain to convert all my files using an 89.0 dB setting, are pretty much useless, and I only wasted my time. Now I have my entire audio collection at a more decent dB range, but it’s far from perfect—-and I’m STILL going to have to adjust the volume all the time. The next project I’m going to burn is “The Best Of The Alan Parsons Project.” The only problem is that there’s so much variance between the volume levels that there’s really no point in burning the CDs, because I’ll constantly be adjusting the volume, therefore ruining my listening experience. Are you saying that, because all these separate tracks didn’t come off of my own personal CDs, then the volume problem is simply something I’m going to accept—-no matter how many “Best Of” CDs I burn? Is this the position in which I find myself?\n\nAs a final question (I hope!): If you recall the comedy skits I mentioned in a previous post, do you know of any program that will help me reduce the OVERALL volume of each individual skit—-even though some of these skits have cut-and-pasted portions within them (from other skits) with different volume levels? The idea is to get each of these skits to have the same overall volume, and then I have to find a way to get ALL of the volume-corrected skits at or near the same dB when I burn them to CD. I have the following software programs at my disposal, if you think any of these might help me do this: Cool Edit Pro, iZotope RX 2 Advanced, and WavePad Sound Editor.\n\nI appreciate your patience with me; and, it goes without saying that, if you’ve reached your limit with my incessant questioning, I’ll completely understand. God knows that if I could find all these answers myself online, I wouldn’t be burning up all the forums like this. I think I'm pretty close to finally \"getting\" it, and, who knows, someday, may even be able to help a similar poor sap out of the same nightmare!\n\nIt’s funny if it all comes down to the fact that, because I’m too cheap (broke?) to go out and buy CDs, I’m never going to be able to listen to my homemade CDs without adjusting the volume. (Beggars can't be choosers?) But, then again, many of the tunes in my collection are rare and hard-to-find tracks that can’t even be found on any CDs available for purchase. Hell, if it weren’t for YouTube, I wouldn’t have half the obscure songs in my collection! Such is the nature of paradoxes!\n\nLooking forward to your next response—-should you choose to post another."
