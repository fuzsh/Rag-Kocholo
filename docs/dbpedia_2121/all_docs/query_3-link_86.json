        "text": "Artist: The Down Hill Strugglers\n\nHometown: Brooklyn, New York\n\nLatest Album: Old Juniper\n\nPersonal Nicknames (or rejected band names): We are sometimes mistakenly called the Down Home Stragglers.\n\nEditor’s Note: Answers have been provided by band member Eli Smith.\n\nWhat’s your favorite memory from being on stage?\n\nLots of great memories there. Being on stage at the Jalopy Theatre, the Brooklyn Folk Festival, or Washington Square Park Folk Festival with Walker, Jackson, and our dear bandmate, now gone, John Cohen would probably be my favorites.\n\nIt was also wonderful to play at the Library of Congress, in that hallowed hall. And the Oldtone Music Festival is an important one for us.\n\nWhat’s the most difficult creative transformation you’ve ever undertaken?\n\nIt’s been interesting running the Brooklyn Folk Festival all these years, and now running the Jalopy Theatre’s record label, Jalopy Records, while also maintaining a musical life with the Down Hill Strugglers and solo, under my own name. Many musicians are also producers, as I am. It can be a challenge to switch back and forth between those mindsets, but it is satisfying to see both types of work progress. Finally, it’s all about sharing good music, however you can.\n\nGenre is dead – long live genre! – but how would you describe the genres and styles your music inhabits?\n\nWe are working in the field of traditional music from the United States, with an ear also turned to traditional music from all over the world. One song I wrote, that’s on our new album, was inspired by a 78rpm record from Central Asia re-issued on the Secret Museum of Mankind series. It had a sound that stuck in my head and made sense to me. We changed it around until it became our own song in our own style. That seems natural.\n\nThe Down Hill Strugglers is an old-time string band. However, old-time music is a catch all for historic American folk music. It encompasses fiddle music, banjo tunes, guitar picking, songs & ballads, blues, religious music, work songs, and more; diverse music ministering to different parts of life.\n\nWhat is a genre, album, artist, musician, or song that you adore that would surprise people?\n\nLongmont Potion Castle has remained popular with the Down Hill Strugglers, driving around on tour, for years. That’s some funny stuff…\n\nIf you didn’t work in music, what would you do instead?\n\nI might drive a cab, or something like that. I’d have great music playing in the cab and deck the vehicle out my own way. It’d be nice. Also, I’d do more organizing work as a leftwing activist. And I used to be a clerk in record stores. The best job I had was at the Arhoolie store, Down Home Music, in El Cerrito, California.\n\nPhoto Credit: Fernando Armenghol"
