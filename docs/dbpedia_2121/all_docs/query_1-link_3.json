        "text": "Jason Boland & the Stragglers have a new album out called \"The Light Saw Me\" which is a different sound for Jason and the band!\n\nI love their new album which is a concept album that takes an 1890s cowboy who was abducted by aliens and then returns to Texas in the 1990's. That may sound a little strange but then again perhaps it has you interested to hear the whole story!\n\n\"The Light Saw Me\", as a concept album, is meant to be listened to front to back, connecting the whole story rather than being a collection of recorded songs that sometimes have nothing to do with other songs on the same album....which is fine, but not what this album is trying to accomplish.\n\nJason Boland is one of the true pioneers of the Texas/Red Dirt music scene making great music for decades. Boland is an awesome singer/songwriter who always keeps you guessing what he is going to do next. His fans love him as he has produced ten successful albums and multiple hit singles! He continues to be a great performer who is always in demand.\n\nIt wasn't until December of last year that Jason Boland & The Stragglers had the honor of playing the Grand Ole' Opry. That was way overdue!\n\nWe play a lot of music by Jason Boland & The Stragglers on Kickin' County 103-1 including the title cut to his latest album \"The Light Saw Me\" which I would recommend you add to your collection!\n\nHe has had his share of offers to sign with major labels but Jason Boland is one of those artist who insist on maintaining integrity with his music and therefore has continued to record independently throughout his career and has enjoyed a lot of success doing it his way!"
