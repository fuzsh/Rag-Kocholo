        "text": "Is there a thread to keep track of all the new music that Popjustice rates have vision-boarded into the universe?\n\nI don't know, but there should be. We're so good at it!\n\nNot to mention the first Limp Bizkit album in ten years had a surprise drop! @DJHazey is eatin' well this weekend! (...Did they seriously call the lead single \"Dad Vibes\"?)\n\nAnyway, I'm glad Korn was mentioned with \"Daddy\", because I think this one is deserving of a lot of attention - because songs like this are why, to me, nu-metal was something artistically worthwhile at its core. Forget all the mockery that the later bands and the third-tier ones got. Korn were still always the masters, and their debut always the crown jewel of the genre, as far as I'm concerned. \"Daddy\" is the song that proves why the genre was valuable, not only to the music scene, but to its audience.\n\n(This YT upload says \"contains very disturbing lyrics and story\", and it surely does, so proceed with caution.)\n\nThe end of this song... well. In all of music, you won't hear many things this emotionally raw and disturbing. Over the course of the song, Jonathan completely loses it, and towards the end, he basically stops singing. Him crying for real would be disturbing enough, but it's not just that - he's screaming incoherently, sobbing, having a full-on mental breakdown, right there in the studio. It's a portrait of how psychologically damaging sexual abuse can be, laid out with no filter. Before the song was recorded, he told the band not to stop playing even if he broke down, because he had to get it out; it was such a taxing experience for him to record it even once that Korn never played it live until the debut's 20th anniversary shows, and in the videos of it, he's clearly having a hard time. As far as I'm concerned, this is up there with \"Frankie Teardrop\" in musical experiences that can shake me to my very core.\n\nIn the metal community, I don't think we'd heard anything like that, not presented in such an unfiltered emotional format. There had been songs before and since with subject matter just as dark, to be certain - Motorhead had covered the same topic with \"Don't Let Daddy Kiss Me\", for example. But the thing is, as with that one, most of them were fictional stories, so as emotionally poignant or powerful as the genre has always been capable of being, there can still be a distance. And for all that death metal bands were starting to take to extreme horror and gore, most of those are too over-the-top to be seriously unsettling; as queasy-making as Carcass' anatomy-textbook fantasia could be, none of it would ever really happen. Metal, as a genre, has had a strong element of theatre, even of camp, from the beginning. Thus, like horror films, it attracts people who know what they're in for, who can experience the darkness and come out fine, knowing that it was never real.\n\n\"Daddy\"? No. This is real, too real. It was a serious issue, presented in its most brutal and unadorned form right there on record. I don't want to think about how many people might have been able to empathise with what was presented there, because these are situations more prevalent than some of us might like to admit. It's hard to listen to, and it should be. It says something about the world, and the ugliness that lurks beneath its safe surface. And it says to anybody who went through something like this: it's not just you. Jonathan Davis has said in interviews that he hated what nu metal turned into: that he saw it go from a safe haven for victims of bullying and trauma like him, to a haven for the crowds of bullies who turned Woodstock '99 into the disaster that it was. But when Korn hit the scene with their debut? For a moment in time, the former was real. God bless them.\n\nBeautifully put!\n\nJonathan pours his life experiences into Korn's music so well. Many of the topics hit home with so many young people, that it was easy to see why the band became so important to so many people. Like \"Hey Daddy\" he wrote many other important songs that were heavy hitters for me as well like \"Falling Away From Me\" (Abuse), \"Fagget\" (Homophobia), \"Thoughtless\" or \"Clown\" (Bullying), \"Alone I Break\" (Suicide), \"Counting on Me\" (Abusive Relationship) and the list goes on and on.\n\nNu Metal Encylopedia\n\nThere was another \"L\" band but I'm not going to mention them for obvious reasons. While some bands proved to be a mess, that one shall reman REDACTED because of the nature of the crimes the lead vocalist committed. Moving on to bands who just seem to have unlikeable band members as @Ironheade has highlighted a couple times in the thread: Machine Head. Much like Fear Factory, that we touched upon earlier, Machine Head was known as a speed/groove/thrash metal band with a lot more clout in the metal scene before their 1999 album The Burning Red. While some critics praised the band for going with a 'more loose and less constructed', the fans called them out for \"selling out\". At the time of its release, The Burning Red was their most popular album and best selling, so maybe the nay-sayers had a point. It was definitely a lot like Fear Factory's attempt at nu metal with Digimortal, though I'd say this one is better sounding one. I don't know a lot about Machine Head's discography but I'd imagine it sounds a lot closer to their overall sound then Digimortal did for Fear Factory. By 2004, they returned to their signature thrash metal sound and later with their 2007 release The Blackening (2007) they went to a more traditional heavy metal sound and this also became their most successful album commercially. While Korn are often looked at as the godfathers of nu metal, Machine Head is sometimes seen as the godfathers of the New Wave of American Heavy Metal. Going back to The Burning Red, which is one of the only times you'd ever hear lead vocalist Robb Flynn doing any kind of rapping vocal (jumping on the nu metal bandwagon), I'll pick their lead single from it \"From the Day\" as a sample.\n\nNow we come to a couple of bands I know Twitch Mo and @Ironheade as well said they were a lot more into than I ever was: Mudvayne and Mushroomhead. Maybe I was a lot like the general public at the time, because despite the fact that I loved Slipknot's debut album, I saw more of this \"mask and costume\" imagery and I couldn't take it seriously. Plus I found a lot of the songs I heard from these bands to be lacking in melody compared to most other nu metal. It just sounded like a lot of loud noise to my ears. Maybe I'm just too basic thoughg because Mudvayne is often described as being very complex and sometimes as \"math metal\". Refreshingly, drummer Matthew McDonough once said \"I honestly don't know what 'math metal' is. I made a joke early on in Mudvayne's career that we used an abacus in writing. It seems I should be careful making jokes in interviews. I don't really see Mudvayne as an innovator in anything.\" -- you don't see a lot of these bands with super egos willing to say they didn't invent the wheel. It was my own bias that had me leaving \"Dig\" out of the rate. I didn't feel like it would do very well anyway and I've never liked it, which is why I never dove into Mudvayne's material at the time. Mushroomhead are a nine member band with a lot of influences coming to play and had been around a lot longer than Mudvayne. They also had more electronic-based music involved. The only album of theirs I would say hit the nu metal scene, briefly, was 2001's XX which was the band's 3rd album. I can't even recall how any of their songs go, so I'll throw out \"Solitaire Unraveling\" because I do remember this one by name at least.\n\n​"
