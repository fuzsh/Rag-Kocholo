        "text": "1.\n\nThere's a group of people and I'm proud that I know them And everybody has a different way of pulling Everyone has a different way of sighing I didn't need to pay a dime or even stand in line There's no books and no maps I bet it's all inside With a little bit of help from a simple car ride I never lost it or lost touch x2 Only light is a lamp so I can see what I wrote And I spilled my guts before my rib cage broke And I turned these used lungs into dress shoes I wouldn't want to see you lying in a hospital bed Especially if you lost your sight or your legs Just sleep on it we'll decide in the morning And I don't want to hear that someone thinks that this is a sad song I swear you to you this ain't a sad song I got through it all If I had failed then I'd admit yeah I need it after all If I hadn't quit I'd need it after all But we're through it now So nobody better ever say that this is a sad song I swear to you this ain't a sad song Not at all, not at all. I swear to you x2\n\n2.\n\nThe Amalfi Coast 02:55\n\nBring me a kor√ßa Or I'll settle for singha That great wall ain't so great I want the Killing Fields or Athenry No Use For A...nother cover song Let's make it a quick good-bye I swear you're wasting time That plane won't wait for us The Amalfi Coast is as close to home as you'll ever get Your plans are killing me But now that you're safe it is safe to say you're home I've been down that road, I know that road is long Don't start to unpack, you deserve to relax Though you're cameras cracked, I know we're going back You always know what's best for me You killed the flower before the bee I've been so sick these days I've traveled all this way I won't pretend I can surf At the bar again, he was handsome man But I got served before my Japanese friend again I couldn't pronounce her name I swear it's all the same My skin will win this one I lost anther friend, to Korea again Cause he couldn't adjust to this life successfully But now that you're safe it is safe to say you're home I've been down that road, I know that road is long Don't start to unpack, you deserve to relax Though you're cameras cracked, I know we're going back You always know what's best for me You killed the flower before the bee Well let me tell ya bout my calling card I leave wherever I go I left four in Corfu And I left one in Seoul That city sucked the life right outta me And you can bet there will be More jet lag in Cairo Another country to see\n\n3.\n\nJust Jump 02:39\n\nAnd you said now this is the time But I never volunteered to be first in line All that it would show and you knew it that it would prove you right And you said so what do you think And I said to you I don't care about anything All I wanted to do was to get you off my back that night And so you pushed and you pushed some more but I never thought I could jump before With one arms twisted at the water I was looking down Just jump it's easier said All you gotta do is quiet the voice inside your head The ground will throw you off just far enough so you miss the sand No building, bridge no matter the size Could erase that suicidal look you had in your eye All the pressure that you gave and all I wanted you to do was lend a hand Just jump, just jump, like you jumped before 100 feet to the ocean floor And I can feel the law of gravity pulling me down To the water let's go I couldn't think of a thing to say Well I thought about revenge and advice you gave me yesterday And you said this is only for fun and I said to you I don't care about anyone I'd have rather thrown you off that ledge then have taken another look And you said now this is the case But I grabbed your throat, dug in and spit in your face I watched your body fall it gave more than the chance I could have took And in the end, what was it all for cause I always knew I could settle the score With panic spreading I was certain things were turning around To the water let's go I couldn't think of a thing to say Well I thought about revenge and advice you gave me yesterday I couldn't think of a thing to say Well I thought about your advice but I threw it all away\n\n4.\n\nAudacity 04:34"
