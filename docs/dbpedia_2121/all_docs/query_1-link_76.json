        "text": "I’m very fortunate to have grown up with parents who took me all sorts of places. We went on vacations to the beach and on picnics in the mountains, we went to museums and historic villages, we went to ballets and folk festivals. I am a woman with many interests because of my parents.\n\nAt one folk festival, a banjo player was kind enough to show me a couple of chords, even though I was only 10. That started my love affair with bluegrass.\n\nI did go through a period of time in my teens when I kept my distance from the genre. Bluegrass seemed too much like country, which I completely disliked at the time. (I’m still not a big fan of country, but there are songs I enjoy.) The thing is, while bluegrass is associated with country music, it’s much more than that. When I ran across this quote by Bill Monroe, the “Father of Bluegrass,” I knew why bluegrass is so attractive to me: “[Bluegrass is] Scottish bagpipes and ole-time fiddlin’. It’s Methodist and Holiness and Baptist. It’s blues and jazz, and it has a high lonesome sound.”\n\nIn my 20s I stopped pretending bluegrass no longer interested me. When I discovered Bluegrass Saturday Morning on KBEM 88.5 FM, a Minneapolis radio station that usually plays jazz, I embraced the show. It runs on Saturdays (surprise!), 7-11 a.m. Central Time, and it’s immediately followed by a related hour-long show, Bluegrass Review.\n\nBoth shows are as wonderful as they are because of their host, Phil Nusbaum, an expert on bluegrass. He has broadened and deepened my understanding of the genre through his weekly selections and his commentary during these programs. When he retires (and I hope that won’t be for a while), the bluegrass world will experience a significant loss.\n\nUntil I started listening to Bluegrass Saturday Morning, my very limited knowledge of bluegrass was confined to more traditional tunes, like my favorite cut from the only bluegrass album I owned growing up.\n\nWhile I still enjoy traditional songs, Nusbaum has introduced me to a wider range of bluegrass, and I’ve become a big fan of more modern covers of jazz and rock tunes, such as this take on “Caravan”:\n\nYou can stream Bluegrass Saturday Morning from anywhere with an Internet connection. Listen live at jazz88.fm. The show is archived for one week, so you can also stream it after it has aired. Bluegrass Review is a syndicated show which plays in 13 states and in Lanena, Tasmania, Australia. Like Bluegrass Saturday Morning, it is archived for one week.\n\nIf you’re new to bluegrass, I strongly suggest you listen for a while before giving up on it. There’s a pretty big difference between an old traditional tune from the 1940s and more a recent one, so it’s worth giving this genre some time instead of judging it from a couple of songs. Perhaps, like me, you’ll fall in love with it.\n\nIt’s a website. It’s a podcast. It has “manliness” at the top of the page in big bold letters, so why is a woman recommending this to her mixed-gender audience?\n\nSimple: both the site and the podcast have lots of good stuff that isn’t really just for men.\n\nSure, there are posts I can’t relate to, like “Five Ways a Beard Will Make Your Winter Better (and Even Save Your Life).” But for every piece like that, there are more that can be useful to anyone, such as “Decluttering Your Digital Life,” “Seven Simple Exercises That Undo the Damage of Sitting,” “The Basics of Finishing Wood,” “The Unexpected Upside of a Lean Season,” and many more.\n\nThe podcast is also interesting, often covering gender-neutral advice on things like approaching life from an action-oriented mindset, and fascinating topics like “Everything You Know About Ninjas Is Wrong.”\n\nThe site has a slightly conservative view of men and manliness; as a guest writer on using guns for home defense puts it, “A man has always been the king of his castle and protector of his domain.” This conservative bent shows up in the look of the site, too. While part of me likes the vintage look, it signals a return to the past “when men were men” (my words, not the site’s). The illustrations feature almost exclusively white people; I’m guessing this is an oversight on the part of the creators, but I do wish they would make more of an effort to be inclusive.\n\nReaders should note that, despite the old-fashioned look to the site, it’s fairly modern — there’s even an article on being a stay-at-home dad. I encourage my more liberal readers to give the site and podcast a try, because there’s lots of good stuff on both of them. Someday I may write more about this as a “make a difference” post, but as someone who has loved ones who are conservative and loved ones who are liberal, I believe we can coexist and learn from each other, even when we disagree.\n\nThere is one danger to the site: Once you start exploring it, you can easily get sucked down a rabbit hole and spend entirely too much time moving from article to article. It might be wise to set strict limits on the amount of time you spend on the site each day!\n\nI became interested in jazz when I was in my teens, and of all the jazz musicians I admired, I was most in love with pianist Ahmad Jamal. One of my earliest jazz purchases was his album Digital Works. I’ve been fortunate enough to hear him live more than once at New Year’s Eve gigs in Washington, D.C.’s Blues Alley, as well as a performance at the Dakota in Minneapolis.\n\nJamal has been recording since the early 1950s and has continued to record into his 80s, fulfilling the stereotype of the long-lived jazz musician. He’s incredibly prolific, but of all the pieces he’s recorded over the decades, he is best known for his take on “Poinciana.”\n\nWhat I love best about Jamal’s music is his lush style. I’ve never experienced synesthesia, but I do associate his music with the color green. There is a density to his sound that is unmistakably his own.\n\nYou can sample his music on his YouTube channel, on his website, or in this NPR post. Any of the working links on the NPR post are worth your while, but I especially recommend the last one, “Autumn Rain.” I first heard that song on his album Rossiter Road, which was released in 1986. I enjoyed the Rossiter Road version, but I think this more recent recording is better.\n\nIf you decide to purchase one of his (many) albums, I recommend you start with Digital Works. It opens with the beloved “Poinciana” and includes marvelous interpretations of “Midnight Sun” (possibly my favorite song on the album), “Footprints,” “Theme From M*A*S*H,” and “Wave.” His only composition on the album, “Biencavo,” is excellent.\n\nOf course, despite the fact that Jamal is considered to be one of the most influential jazz pianists in the history of the genre, if jazz isn’t your thing, you may come away from listening to him in much the same frame of mind as a certain person in my life who accompanied me to the concert at the Dakota. When we left, I asked them what they thought. Their diplomatic reply? “It was jazz.”\n\nI’m not really into horror or zombies. Blood, guts, jump scares, and excessive suspense just aren’t my thing.\n\nColson Whitehead’s book Zone One is one of the exceptions to this rule… though part of why I like it is because Whitehead limits the blood, guts, and jump scares and delivers just the right amount of suspense. It’s more literary fiction than a horror story about zombies, but the sense of menace is there.\n\nYou may have heard of the author, since he just won a Pulitzer this year for his novel The Underground Railroad. It’s not his first award. In 2002, he received a MacArthur Fellowship (a.k.a., “the Genius Grant”), and he’s also received a Guggenheim Fellowship, a PEN award, and the National Book Award (also for The Underground Railroad), among other prizes.\n\nWhen I first read Zone One, The Underground Railroad had not yet exploded onto the scene, and I was woefully ignorant of Whitehead and his work. I picked it up because it was on a list of science fiction and fantasy by women and people of color, nestled alongside names like Octavia Butler and Ursula Le Guin. Because it was recommended, I decided to read it, although I felt a bit wary of the topic. By the end of the book, I wanted more.\n\nThe story takes place during reconstruction efforts after the worst part of a zombie apocalypse, although Whitehead never uses the term “zombie.” Instead, he writes of a plague — transmitted by bite from “skels” — shambling undead creatures who seek out human flesh. Most humans affected by the plague become skels, but a handful become “stragglers,” harmless individuals frozen in time as they stare into copy machines or sit in their places of work, seemingly waiting for the next client. “Mark Spitz” (we never learn his real name) is part of a team that is cleaning up stragglers in “Zone One,” a walled off section of Manhattan that has been cleared of most skels by the Marines and is now being prepared to once more hold human inhabitants. Although the core of the story takes place over three days, Whitehead includes plenty of flashbacks, allowing the reader to gradually piece together the story of the apocalypse and how Mark Spitz has survived to date.\n\nWhitehead balances the mood of the book perfectly from start to finish. He introduces us to the horror of the skels early on, letting us know that, although Zone One is largely free of the creatures, there are still a few the Marines did not get — and outside the wall there are plenty more, constantly being shot down by patrolling soldiers. This horror is mixed with the optimism that people feel as the United States begins to rebuild itself bit by bit and re-establish some contact with other parts of the world, with sadness over the losses that have occurred in the lives of the survivors, and with a good dose of humor to keep the book from getting too dark.\n\nMany writers can tell a good story, but Whitehead is one of those who goes beyond that. He’s a master of the written word. It’s hard for me to pick one passage from the book to introduce you to his style, but this part of his description of Mark Spitz can give you an idea:\n\nHe staked out the B or the B chose him: it was his native land, and in high school and college he did not stray over the county line. At any rate his lot was irrevocable. He was not made team captain, nor was he the last one picked. He side-stepped detention and honor rolls with equal aplomb. Mark Spitz’s high school had abolished the yearbook practice of nominating students the Most Likely to Do This or That, in the spirit of universal self-esteem following a host of acrimonious parent summits, but his most appropriate designation would have been Most Likely Not to Be Named Most Likely Anything, and this was not a category. His aptitude lay in the well-executed middle, never shining, never flunking, but gathering himself for what it took to progress past life’s next random obstacle. It was his solemn expertise.\n\nAlso, not surprising for a recipient of a genius grant, Whitehead is smart enough to tell a story that is realistic. He spots the clichés that make no sense and corrects them.\n\nIn the cinema of end-times, the roads feeding the evacuated city are often clear, and the routes out of town clotted with paralyzed vehicles. … It makes for a stark visual image, the crazy hero returning to the doomed metropolis to save his kid or gal or to hunt down the encrypted computer file that might — just might — reverse disaster, driving a hundred miles an hour into the hexed zip codes when all the other citizens are vamoosing, wide-eyed in terror, mouths decorated with flecks of white foam.\n\nIn Mark Spitz’s particular apocalypse, the human beings were messy and did not obey rules, and every lane in and out, every artery and vein, was filled with outbound traffic.\n\nI said that when I finished this book, I wanted more. Unfortunately, this seems to have been Whitehead’s only foray into this particular territory. No matter. He has other books that sound intriguing — not just The Underground Railroad but four other novels and two nonfiction books. I have a feeling that any of them could be worth your while, but my recommendation today is that — even if you don’t like horror — you pick up a copy of Zone One and immerse yourself in Whitehead’s writing.\n\nWhen I wrote about “Haven’t You Heard? I’m Sakamoto,” I promised not to try to convert my readers into dedicated anime viewers, but I did say that there are gems worth watching. “My Hero Academia” (“Boku no Hero Academia”) is one that I can’t help mentioning, particularly because I think it will appeal to Harry Potter fans.\n\nThis series is set in an unspecified future, when superpowers have become the norm. Approximately 80 percent of the world’s population has some sort of “quirk,” or special power. Many people have relatively minor quirks, but the most powerful may become heroes, gaining fame and fortune as they battle villains. Especially talented children compete for slots at U.A., an elite high school from which heroes are recruited.\n\nIzuku Midoriya is a quirkless boy who has wanted nothing more than to be a hero since he was very young. He studies heroes carefully, writing down everything about them in his notebooks. His life changes when he is rescued from a villain by his idol, All Might, the “Symbol of Peace.” With All Might’s help, Izuku is able to pursue the dream he thought was unattainable.\n\nThe series is by no means a ripoff of Harry Potter, but parallels are there. U.A. is much like Hogwarts, and All Might plays a similar role in Izuku’s life to the one that Dumbledore plays in Harry’s. Just as Harry and Draco Malfoy are enemies, there is a strong rivalry between Izuku and his classmate Katsuki Bakugou. Izuku even seems to be developing a close friendship with two classmates — a girl and a boy.\n\n“My Hero Academia” has the sense of adventure that is present in some of my favorite anime series. It also explores themes like motivation and heroism without ever getting heavy-handed. Its second season recently started. I wasn’t as crazy about the first couple of episodes of the new season as I was about last season (in fact, episode 13.5 is just a recap of season one), but the last couple of episodes have gotten better, and I have high hopes that this season will end up as good as the last. I do recommend you start with the first season rather than relying on the recap. You can view “My Hero Academia” on Crunchyroll, Funimation, or Hulu. Do yourself a favor and watch the subtitled version, not the dubbed version.\n\nHave you ever tried to name five or more female artists off the top of your head? How did you fare?\n\nI hope you thought of Georgia O’Keeffe and Frida Kahlo. Did you remember to include Mary Cassatt? Who else made the list?\n\nI added Artemisia Gentileschi to the list of female artists I know when I attended a lecture on her at the Minneapolis Institute of Art about 20 years ago. Artemisia was an Italian painter who lived from approximately 1593 to 1653. Her father, Orazio, was a respected artist who taught all of his children to paint, but only Artemisia showed real talent. Her legacy is overshadowed by the story of how her perspective tutor, Agostino Tassi, raped her and how she was tortured during his trial. Her paintings of active, powerful women are frequently viewed through the lens of the rape and trial, causing some people to see them as revenge fantasies.\n\nDuring the lecture, we explored her first painting of Susanna and the Elders, which illustrates a critical moment in a story from the apocrypha of the Bible. Briefly, the story involves Susanna, a virtuous married woman who was accosted by two Jewish elders who hid in her garden and caught her bathing alone. They offered her a choice: she could have sex with them, or they would say that they caught her with a young man, and she would be put to death. Susanna chose death, but after she was accused of adultery, the young Daniel questioned the elders separately and discovered that their stories conflicted. Susanna was saved, and the elders were executed.\n\nMany painters have captured the moment when Susanna was first confronted by the elders. A few have shown her reacting violently to their suggestion, but in many cases she only appears mildly distressed, and in others she even seems to welcome their attention.\n\nArtemisia’s first take on the subject, painted before her rape, shows a woman who is clearly repulsed by the elders. The image is powerful, because she brings a woman’s point of view to the story. It’s not that a male painter is incapable of expressing empathy for Susanna; the problem is that few men seem to have tried to imagine how she felt about the elders’ proposition.\n\nBesides this rendition of Susanna and the Elders, Artemisia is most famous for her four paintings of Judith, also from the Bible’s apocrypha. Judith was a wealthy Jewish widow who saved her people from the Assyrian general Holofrenes by beheading him in his own tent as he lay in a drunken stupor. Two of Artemisia’s pictures show Judith and her maid in the act of beheading Holofrenes, and two are set after the fact.\n\nLike Susanna, Judith was a popular subject of paintings. One of the most famous renditions of the beheading is by Caravaggio. In his painting, Judith keeps her distance from her victim, and the look on her face seems to be one of both concentration and disgust. That may be realistic enough for a wealthy woman who never had killed a man before, but the actual beheading seems unreal.\n\nArtemisia’s Judith, while she requires the help of her maid to pin Holofrenes to the bed, is powerful and active. She sets about doing what must be done with no fear of the blood she is shedding. Caravaggio is a master, but I find Artemisia’s Judith more believable and heroic. (The Judith below was painted between 1614 and 1620.)\n\nArtemisia had a long and successful career as an artist, keeping busy until around the time of her death. She worked in Rome, Florence, Naples, and the court of King Charles I of England. She married another painter (the marriage was arranged shortly after the rape trial ended) and had one daughter, whom she taught to paint.\n\nIf your knowledge of female artists did not include Artemisia Gentileschi, I encourage you to search for her paintings online. Her art is often powerful and masterful. For those qualities alone, Artemisia is worth your time.\n\nPaul Gallico begins The Silent Miaow claiming that his neighbor found the manuscript on his doorstep. It seemed to be written in some sort of indecipherable code, so, knowing that Gallico had a mind for such things, the neighbor turned it over to him. After some time, Gallico discovered that what had appeared to be a code could be explained if someone tried to type a manuscript with a paw. From there, he says, it was relatively easy to translate the entire manuscript, which has the subtitle “A Manual for Kitten, Strays and Homeless Cats.”\n\nAny cat lover (and perhaps some cat haters, too) will delight in Gallico’s “how to” manual written from the point of view of a cat. First published in 1964, the book is a product of its time (the author advises cats to avoid irritating the man of the house after Christmas when the bills come in), but the overall concept of a book instructing cats on how to take over a house is just as humorous today as it was 50 years ago. In fact, you can easily find a used paperback version of the book that was published in 1985, so clearly it was popular enough 20 years after it was published to be worth reprinting.\n\nThe manual is written from the point of view of a stay kitten who decided to adopt a couple after her mother was hit by a car. After telling the story of how she successfully insinuated herself into her family’s life, she proceeds to instruct her readers on how to get along in the human world so that they are able to successfully manage families of their own. There are chapters on topics like property rights, food, doors, and speech, which includes these instructions:\n\nI have referred in the above section to the pitiful miaow as among the most effective sounds you can produce to get some action out of your people, and to this must be added the sound that all of you will know how to produce, which has a most remarkable softening-up effect; it is that little lilt of ours, a chirrup, which goes, “Prrrr-maow,” with a rising inflection upon the last syllable. This sound of ours has no specific use vis-à-vis people; except that for some reason or other it just seems to make them feel fine, and puts them into a good humor. … I simply call it to your attention as yet another item in the armory for keeping our people in a state of subjugation and prepared to wait on us.\n\nThe author tells female cats to consider avoiding kittens, because as a family works “to place the kittens in adequate homes, they might just suddenly wonder what life would be like without any cat at all about the house. Once you get them thinking that, you could be halfway out the door.” She advises her readers on good manners, such as not getting on the dining table: “Stealing is for dogs. We are above it.” She shares her thoughts on Two-Timing (maintaining a presence in two households), which she describes as “not very nice.”\n\nAnyone who has owned a cat will recognize their pet in the chapter on “games and recreations.”\n\nEvery well-educated house cat ought to know when and how to break them up. For instance, there is no point in interfering with a scrabble game at the very beginning. … The proper method is to wait until the board is practically full with a most complicated arrangement of words. Then, jump up onto the board with the most sweetly saccharine “Purrrrrrmaow” that you can muster, scatter the pieces in all directions, sit down, and commence to wash.\n\nThe book is illustrated with cat photos by Suzanne Szasz. In Gallico’s story, he says the cat in the photos is Cica, who had taken over a family “under circumstances not dissimilar to those outlined in the narrative part of the manuscript, and they owned a typewriter — as it happened, an electric one.” Although Gallico channels a cat quite well, the book would not be the same without Szasz’s wonderful photos.\n\nI don’t know how easy it is to check out a copy of The Silent Miaow from a library. I reread my mom’s copy for this post; my county library system didn’t have it. But even if you can’t borrow it through your local library or via interlibrary loan, you can probably find an affordable used copy online. It’s worth your trouble.\n\nThe tiffin delivery service in Mumbai is famous for its accuracy. The Indian film The Lunchbox (2013) starts with a misdelivered tiffin and unfolds from there.\n\nIla is a housewife in an unhappy marriage. That first misdelivered tiffin is filled with food she hopes will make her husband fall in love with her again. It arrives at the desk of Saajan Fernandes, a lonely widower facing retirement. He’s supposed to be training in his eager young replacement, but he’s clearly reluctant to do so.\n\nIla quickly figures out that whoever enjoyed her special lunch was not her husband, so she sends the next lunch with a note. She receives a terse reply but continues to send lunches and notes rather than correcting the delivery service. Saajan also ignores the fact that his lunches are the result of a mistake (after all, Ila’s cooking is better than that of the restaurant that was supplying his meals). Instead, he sends the empty tiffin back with responses to Ila’s notes. Their correspondence becomes increasingly intimate.\n\nI’m not fond of stories about affairs. I hated both The Bridges of Madison County and The English Patient. But The Lunchbox is a different story, in part because Ila’s husband is so horrible, and in part because… well, you’ll just have to watch the movie. I don’t want to spoil it for you.\n\nThe story and the characters are reasons enough to watch this film, but the food is what really won me over when I first saw it. I’m a sucker for a good food movie, and this is an excellent one. You can practically smell Ila’s cooking. Just watch this trailer.\n\nThe Lunchbox is available through Amazon, from Netflix (as a disk only), through YouTube Movies, and possibly at your local library. Make reservations at an Indian restaurant and then settle down to watch the movie just before you go. Mmmmmmm….\n\nThis weekend I finally got around to doing something I’ve been meaning to do for years: I attended a roller derby bout.\n\nI think I first became aware of modern roller derby when I saw an article about a staff member at my workplace who was on a team. Then I became familiar with the Minnesota Roller Girls, who showed up at CONvergence [I’ll use this opportunity to link shamelessly to my book on CONvergence]. The league also volunteered to cheer on participants in HeroSearch‘s first Cookie Fun 5K.\n\nYou may be aware of roller derby from the past. It started in the 1930s when body contact at a roller skating event got the most reaction from spectators. From there it grew and became increasingly theatrical, and some time after the ’70s it began to die out. It revived in the early 2000s, becoming primarily an amateur women’s sport.\n\nMost roller derby is on flat tracks. The rules are fairly simple. I walked into last weekend’s North Star Roller Girls bout completely ignorant of the sport, but it didn’t take me too long to figure out the basics. When I left, I still had questions about some of the finer points, but for the most part, I understood what I was seeing on the track. That said, I don’t recommend most people go to their first bout as ignorant as I was. The North Star Roller Girls make things clear on their Derby 101 page.\n\nPart of the fun of roller derby is the atmosphere. Teams, players, officials, even bouts often have playful names. The bout I attended was called Purple Pain. It was actually two bouts between all four North Star Roller Girls teams: first between Delta Delta Di and the Kilmore Girls, then between the Violent Femmes and the Banger Sisters. It featured players with names like Maul Bunyan, Pop Roxie, KiLLRoy, and Salty Maude. (Were I to participate in roller derby — and given the fact that I don’t feel comfortable on skates, that’s not happening — I have decided I would be ObliterKate.)\n\nIf it had merely been an evening featuring women with amusing names skating around a track, I wouldn’t be writing about it right now. When the first bout started, given both my ignorance of the sport and the effectiveness of the blockers on the two teams, I wondered what I’d gotten myself into. It just seemed like two groups of women blocking a couple of other women. When things really got going and the jammers from the teams broke through the pack, I began to see the point to the sport. The last bout got really exciting. At first the Banger Sisters scored several points, leaving the Violent Femmes far behind. Before the end of the first half, the Violent Femmes made a huge comeback, and the second half was a nail biter, with the two teams staying pretty close in terms of points. My mom, my daughter, and I began rooting for the Violent Femmes, in part because we liked a couple of the players: The Fawkes was doing a great job as jammer, and Pop Roxie was an outstanding pivot. The Banger Sisters won, but I had a great time.\n\nThere are banked track teams, but such tracks are hard to come by, so your best bet for seeing roller derby is on a flat track. The Women’s Flat Track Derby Association has hundreds of leagues around the world, so you may very well be able to see roller derby where you are. There are also at least some men’s teams for people who are interested in seeing or participating in men’s roller derby.\n\nThe roller derby season is practically over for the year, so check now to see if you can get to a bout in your area. And if you have local teams but can’t make it to a bout this season, mark your calendars for the 2017-18 season. If you like what you see, maybe you’ll even consider trying out for a team!"
