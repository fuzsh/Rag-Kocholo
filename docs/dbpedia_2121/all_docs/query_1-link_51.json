        "text": "PREFATORY NOTE: This post is a follow-up to my last one, “Jutta Hipp in America,” which highlighted one of the most fascinating (and least discussed) artists on the storied Blue Note label. As 2021 winds to a close, I’m offering another glimpse into the Jazz Duck’s archives, as I slowly compile my Blue Note label survey. The idea here is to highlight a few more lesser-known Blue Note titles that deserve — but have not yet achieved — the classic status that has been accorded to so many LPs on the label.\n\nGrant Green: Live at the Lighthouse (1972)\n\nGreen is one of the most prolific, and to me one of the most consistently pleasurable, of all Blue Note artists. His bluesy, plainly stated guitar melodies and riffs were daringly exposed on enduring early classics like Green Street (1961) and his 1961-62 sessions with pianist Sonny Clark. Green recorded most of his classic ‘60s sessions as a way of financing his heroin addiction, and eventually it caught up with him, precipitating a substantial hiatus from recording. He re-emerged at the end of the decade, playing in a simple vamping funk style and pretty well abandoning his old attachment to bebop, at least on record. This music — heralded by 1970’s popular recording Alive! — was by far his most commercially successful during his lifetime, and though it fell out of favor after the ‘70s (and had a brief revival in the ‘90s under the rubric of “acid jazz”) it still has a fair number of fans today, and may even be enjoying a resurgence of popularity. The follow-up live extravaganza, Live at the Lighthouse, is altogether more subtle and colorful than Alive!, with Green playing with great energy, a vividly golden tone, and at impressive length. His exquisite solo on the Stylistics’ “Betcha By Golly Wow” – the only ballad – takes what I consider a mediocre tune and spins music of disarming emotion. The band (including the returning saxophonist Claude Bartee) is also no longer seemingly trying to shout him down, and there are few dry stretches of funky vamping; the presence of a real, live bass player (Wilton Felder) is also welcome. Indeed, the tempos are much livelier than you’d expect for this type of music, sometimes even hinting at disco. This is a double-LP set, and most of the six tracks are remarkably long, but it’s more sustaining, soulful, and jazzlike than most of Green’s other “commercial” work. (Mind you, in what world is a quarter-hour funk-disco jam “commercial”?) A rewarding place to start with this aspect of his art, and indeed with the whole ‘70s funk-jazz thing. An added bonus is Hank Stewart’s lengthy, hilarious Aquarian Age introductions to the tunes and players, each and every one of which is “bad” (and rarely, “super, super, mother bad”).\n\nNOTE: for more discussion of Grant Green’s music of this period, see my reviews of the 2018 releases Funk in France and Slick! Live at Oil Can Harry’s.\n\nHerbie Hancock: Inventions & Dimensions (1963)\n\nAn audacious fusion of Latin rhythms and free improvisation (similar to some of what Sonny Rollins was doing at the same time), with no horns, two percussionists, and Hancock in total, shattering command of the piano. Paul Chambers is along for the ride on bass, supplying hypnotic ostinatos to hold the group together. One gets the sense that Chambers either found the concept challenging or unchallenging or somehow both, but his minimalist contributions are perfect for the music, even as they force Hancock to shoulder all of the responsibility for modulating the rhythmic attack. A mystifyingly underrated session which has only started to be re-evaluated recently – and a vivid impression of Hancock’s art before the emotional abstraction it took on during the Miles Davis years became his dominant manner. He had just turned 23.\n\nMilt Jackson: Wizard of the Vibes (1948/1952)\n\nThe second half of this compilation is more memorable than the first, a quartet session with Thelonious Monk in which classic compositions like “Epistrophy” and “I Mean You” receive their premiere recordings. The eternally swinging vibraphonist Jackson—not an obvious Monk interpreter—navigates through this material deftly, and Monk makes eager points as well. Two further tracks by this group are lovely ballads with emotive vocals by Kenny “Pancho” Hagood (Alice Coltrane’s first husband, best known for singing with the Miles Davis Birth of the Cool band). The first half of the disc, recorded much later, is more conventional light-toned bop, although interesting for the presence of the entire original Modern Jazz Quartet, who have not quite yet worked out their Baroque-influenced contrapuntal group approach. The result is looser and more rambunctious than is usual for the MJQ, with a lot of solo space for fifth wheel Lou Donaldson, who at this stage was an energetic Charlie Parker copycat. This material makes up in compact swinging what it lacks in visionary originality compared to the Monk material.\n\nJoe Lovano: Viva Caruso (2002)\n\nLovano, the preeminent saxophone stylist in “contemporary” jazz, with a characteristically grand, rumpled tone on tenor, recorded prolifically for the revived Blue Note for decades. Lovano broke from the Coltrane manner that had dominated jazz saxophone in the ‘70s and ‘80s—not that Coltrane wasn’t still a major influence—with a shaggy, idiosyncratic mixture of elements of Joe Henderson, Sonny Rollins, and Swing Era forebears like Ben Webster. Lovano’s debut on the label, From the Soul (1991), is now widely considered a classic, though its attitude is more austere than his friendly saxophone sound might lead one to believe. His Blue Note recordings, however, are extremely and audaciously varied, frequently marked by generational and stylistic crossover and imposing no-expense-spared production. Viva Caruso might be the finest example of this, with a mid-sized orchestra tarantella-ing around Lovano’s idiosyncratic meditation on the legacy of the original Italian tenor star of the recording era. It’s lively and sometimes even touching music, seemingly calculated to annoy the sensibilities of either a jazz or opera audience. Lovano obstinately refuses to play pieces like “Vesti la giubba” (from Pagliacci) or “O Sole Mio” in the crowd-pleasing way one would expect, the stark (almost crabbed) arrangements squeezing the melodies until they are contemporary jazz. Elsewhere, vocalist Judi Silvano (Lovano’s wife) helps bring things closer to detente, while accordionists and guitarists stir the marinara. Almost 20 years on, it’s now a poignant relic of a brief time when an artist like Lovano—whose fundamental style flirts with the avant-garde—could receive label support on this scale, and become a mainstream figure of celebrity rather than just the interest of a few connoisseurs. Sadly, although Lovano was in some ways the face of the “new” Blue Note, many (all?) of his Blue Note recordings are now out of print, including this one.\n\nNOTE: I have discussed Joe Lovano extensively on this blog, most recently here, where you can also find links to my other writings on this artist.\n\nJackie McLean: New and Old Gospel (1967)\n\nMcLean developed his characteristically sharp, dry, moaning alto sound — he sometimes sounds like a heavier Art Pepper, without the glow — at an early age, honing it through apprenticeships with Charlie Parker and Miles Davis. But he took a long time to mature. He had made many albums for Prestige already, but his coming to Blue Note in 1959 was a turning point in his career. A great outpouring of classic LPs followed, including Let Freedom Ring (1962) and two marvelous sessions with Grachan Moncur III, One Step Beyond and Destination…Out! But there is nothing in McLean’s output quite like this, a team-up with “free jazz” pioneer Ornette Coleman, who had just signed to the label (and immediately came up with his own masterpiece, 1965’s trio session At the Golden Circle). A fascinating long-form “Lifeline” suite by McLean and Coleman’s rollicking title track and appropriately mysterious “Strange as It Seems” provide the settings for some of McLean’s most electrifying soloing—while Coleman, restricting himself (almost perversely) to trumpet, adds a fair amount of intriguingly canted commentary of his own. Not all McLean (or Coleman!) fans will love this, but I do.\n\nHorace Silver and the Jazz Messengers (1954/’55)\n\nRelatively few fans of this type of music are aware that the Jazz Messengers—the band led by Art Blakey for decades—were initially a vehicle for pianist Horace Silver. In its original incarnation, the group consisted of Silver, Blakey, and the ill-starred trio of bassist Doug Watkins, tenor saxophonist Hank Mobley, and the brilliant trumpeter Kenny Dorham; by the end of 1956, only Blakey remained, and it was not until 1958 that the familiar version of the band emerged. This album, originally two 10” LPs in a slightly different sequence, is transitional in several other respects too: the tunes are usually inflected by the blues and gospel (“The Preacher”), hinting at hard bop, but the arrangements are detailed and full of humorous juxtapositions (such as the sudden Caribbean break towards the end of “To Whom It May Concern”) held over from bebop. Silver himself plays the blues in a precise, almost dainty style, like John Lewis (of the MJQ) by way of Bud Powell. For the most part, though, he takes a back seat to the arrangements and the horn section: Mobley is in particularly confident form, playing with rare beauty and fullness of tone, while Dorham (very much still in bebop mode) is a fine foil as usual. Even Blakey plays with unusual subtlety. The result hardly resembles the more famous Jazz Messengers recordings of the later ‘50s and ‘60s, but the “message” is delightful.\n\nNOTE: McCoy Tyner is another artist who has been covered extensively on this blog, most recently in volume 3 of my ongoing series of McCoy Tyner reflections, on his work for the Milestone label. Links to parts 1 & 2 of this career-survey-in-reverse can be found at the start of that post.\n\nNote: for previous reviews of titles in this series, check the following pages:\n\nBBE J Jazz compilations:\n\nJ Jazz: Deep Modern Jazz from Japan 1969-1984 [Volume 1] (2018)\n\nJ Jazz: Deep Modern Jazz from Japan 1969-1983 Volume 2 (2019)\n\nBBE J Jazz Masterclass series:\n\nJ Jazz Masterclass vol. 1 (2018): Tohru Aizawa Quartet: Tachibana\n\nJ Jazz Masterclass vols. 2 & 3 (2018): Takeo Moriyama: East Plants / Koichi Matsukaze Trio + Toshiyuki Daitoku: Earth Mother\n\nEver since the release of the first J Jazz compilation in 2018, I have been tracking the BBE label’s archival releases of small-label Japanese jazz. My review of volume 2 of the main series of compilations was one of my last posts before the descent of the COVID-19 pandemic sent me fleeing from writing about jazz for a while. But since then, a third volume has appeared (review forthcoming), as have the individual reissues constituting the BBE “J Jazz Masterclass” series. Individual numbering of the latter titles ceased some time ago (I believe after volume 1, Tohru Aizawa’s Tachibana), but the series has been durable: after an understandably quiet 2020, it resumed early this year with two new discs, and the most recent entry, Kohsuke Mine’s excellent 1970 date First (see below), appeared just a few months ago. The albums featured in the series have been a mixed bag from the start, surprisingly uniform in sound and tone (one does tend to doubt how comprehensive a picture they paint of the diversity of Japanese jazz), but uneven in musical substance. Still, at their best they capture some truly intriguing inflections of jazz by players more than worthy of rediscovery in the west. I’m certainly glad that the series has delivered fascinating players like Mine and Koichi Matsukaze into my collection. And there’s a case to be made that, as of 2021, the series just keeps getting better.\n\nAlthough I last reviewed one of these individual titles almost 3 years ago (!), I have continued to collect them. Let’s get caught up together, shall we? I’ll present these capsule reviews in the order in which the discs were released, over roughly the last 2 years.\n\nMakoto Terashita Meets Harold Land: Topology (1984; reissued 2019)\n\nA late entry in the BBE J Jazz chronology, this one is set apart by a starring role for American West Coast tenor institution Land, then 55. Seemingly enthused by pianist Terashita’s softened Tyneresque postbop concepts, Land nonetheless sounds ragged on this session that basically fails to fulfill the promise of the marvelous opening “Dragon Dance.” Land’s own ballad “World Peace” is an uninspired Coltrane imitation, there are more rote Coltrane figures on “Takeuma,” and the saxophonist is simply absent on Terashita’s bossa, “Dear Friends.” It is disconcerting hearing Land stumble over his feet taking these giant steps. I have given this disc several tries but it always loses me over its 47 minutes, even though the East-meets-West melodic idiom of much of the music — which is much more strongly felt here than on other titles in the series — is so attractive in theory. Certainly the Japan-by-way-of-Brazil-by-way-of-LA fusions of “Dragon Dance” portend a more visionary work than what actually unfolds. In the end, the story of how the little-documented Terashita hooked up with the legendary Land is perhaps more interesting than the music they made together.\n\nMiyasaka +5: Animals Garden (1979; reissued 2019)\n\nThe first of several entries in this series with an “out of time” quality, this is an album of tempestuous and end-stage hard bop grounded fiercely by bandleader “Bear” Miyasaka’s truly thunderous drums. There’s no hint of fusion nor of the more peaceable formulations of the ECM world, though the pace is often stately, and little indication of the more avant vocabularies of its period either. Familiar voices from other titles in the series, including especially saxophonist Koichi Matsukaze, add searching solos to these four long but engrossing tracks, including a rousing “Pecker’s Blues” (!) and a particularly haunting, aptly-titled “Ballad for Mammoth.” The latter is a feature for trombonist Hiroshi Itaya, apparently based on “You Don’t Know What Love Is.” Itaya has some of the dry, acerbic quality of Grachan Moncur III. Matsukaze, here as elsewhere, makes a striking impression in a piercing modification of Eric Dolphy’s late idiom on alto, sounding a bit like the best kind of stomachache. The term “spiritual jazz” is embarrassingly overused, but if you’re lucky, this is the type of shaggy, uninhibited music you get. A worthy rediscovery, though neither completely without lulls nor as compulsively listenable as Matsukaze’s own disc in the series.\n\nSasaki Hideto – Sekine Toshiyuki Quartet + 1: Stop Over (1976; reissued 2020)\n\nAlong with the Terashita/Land title, this one is a good example of the J Jazz compilation series’ tendency to cut the heart out of the albums it excerpts. For the title piece here (like “Dragon Dance” on Topology), a gleaming Latin-tinged hard bop nugget that was a clear highlight of J Jazz vol. 2, quite mops the floor with everything else here. The hardest to love of the series (for me), this is most similar to inaugural entry Tachibana by the Tohru Aizawa Quintet, another young group of what might charitably be called semi-pros who would go on to record scantily if at all. Unusually for this series and for 1976, this group is a Blue Note-style quintet that plays exclusively in a circa-1962 style. Indeed, much of the material is borrowed from old Blue Notes of that era — not obvious ones, to be fair — and only the closing title track is new. There are two ballads, including Tadd Dameron’s “Soultrane” from his well-known 1956 session with Coltrane for Prestige, which boasts a particularly weak trumpet solo from Sasaki. Otherwise, the tempos are aggressive, the solos callow, and though it’s bracing in small doses, it doesn’t sustain interest over its whole running time, let alone over multiple plays. There is, however, some fine drumming, by the otherwise unrecorded Takashi Kurosaki.\n\nShintaro Quintet: Evolution (1984; reissued 2021)\n\nMore echoes of Blue Note: this one was even recorded in New York. Shintaro Nakamura leads the band from the bass chair and composed the tunes, but the real star is trumpeter Shunzo Ohno, who has a rich open tone reminiscent of Freddie Hubbard at his peak. Many will also hear Hubbard’s frequent partner Wayne Shorter in tenorist Bob Kenmotsu, making his recording debut. The impression quite dominates the music: the Quintet plays sleek hard bop, serious and unshowy, apparently untouched by fusion (though, like Hubbard, Ohno apparently specialized in it during the ‘70s). It’s very much in line with the bop revivalism of the time, which after all had started in Japan (with the rapturous reception of the Herbie Hancock-led VSOP groups) and had slowly made its way back to America. The opening piece, “Future on You,” with its abruptly shifting time signatures, is surprisingly similar to a 1980s Wynton Marsalis group — but the rest could be extracts from Hubbard or Lee Morgan albums of 20 years earlier, albeit extracts limited to just the minor waltzes. These are a recurring theme of this series, to be sure — “My Favorite Things” is always nearby — but this one takes it to its logical conclusion, every tune a waltz. The closing dedication, “A Blind Man,” is to Woody Shaw: a highlight of the very first volume of J Jazz back in 2018, it features the leader’s one and only bass solo of the session. Despite some slight rhythmic monotony by the end, this is the glossiest Masterclass title yet, and one of the best — as familiar and unfamiliar at once as an autumn day.\n\nKohsuke Mine: First (1970; reissued 2021)\n\nBy contrast to the other titles here, this one could hardly have been made at any time but in 1970, with its combination of double bass, Rhodes piano, and quartal changes. Chronology aside, it’s thoroughly excellent. Leader Mine plays his fragile, Jackie McLean-touched alto over the velvety bed of electric piano, played with unusual delicacy by Masabumi Kikuchi. Meanwhile, an expatriate American rhythm section — Larry Ridley on bass and Lenny McBrowne on drums — are treated like the honored guests they no doubt were, and Ridley in particular contributes some strikingly ruminative solos and walking lines. (The closing track is a wonderful feature for the under-recorded McBrowne.) Unusually free for a BBE rediscovery, First is still fairly approachable postbop stuff — but dynamic and full of incisive playing by all four members of the group. Ridley even contributes a finger-snapping minor blues to keep things swinging. Alongside Matsukaze’s (similar in some respects) Earth Mother, the aptly-named First is at the front of the pack in this series.\n\nConsumer note: for some reason this last title is scarcer and way more expensive than the others, even on CD (my copy cost $32). I hope this is just a COVID-related blip and doesn’t portend a permanent change for the series, which up to this point has been distinguished by excellent distribution and very reasonable prices.\n\nNote: this is part 7 in a continuing series. Part 1 includes a prefatory note introducing the series.

After a brief apprenticeship as a sideman for Miles Davis, Max Roach, and a few others, in 1956 — at the age of 25 — Rollins began what may now be reckoned the longest career as a solo star attraction in the history of jazz.\n\nBut it has been, in some ways, a lonely career. His huge, grainy, grousing, aggressive, stuttering tenor saxophone sound utterly defies comparison to any other musician. True, he’s had an unmistakable tonal influence on a wide range of tenor players — the burly, barking alternative to Coltrane’s more vulnerable version of force. But, although his orig inal context was bebop, he’s never really been closely associated with any particular “school” of jazz, and his influence on anyone except other saxophonists is difficult to detect, even 70 years (!) out from his first recordings.\n\nEven compared to other major figures of his generation — and of those jazz musicians born within 5 years of him, it may be that only Coltrane, Miles, and perhaps Ornette Coleman are of comparable institutional stature — that sound has been the defining feature of his aesthetic, utterly steamrolling every context it has ever been featured in. There has never been a “classic” Sonny Rollins group, only a long line of musicians (almost always great musicians) given the thankless assignment of sharing the stage with the Saxophone Colossus.\n\nBut what kind of music does the Colossus play? Here is the main point that has still yet to be settled. For Rollins is neither a major innovator like Coltrane or Coleman or Eric Dolphy (or McCoy Tyner or Duke Ellington or Charlie Parker or Monk or Mingus or George Russell or Lennie Tristano or…), nor a brilliant popularizer of others’ innovations like Miles or Stan Getz, nor an uncannily self-renewing ambassador for a traditional style like, say, Zoot Sims. Nor is he, on final analysis, a particularly accomplished composer. (Mind you, neither was Miles.) He is, the consensus goes, perhaps jazz’s foremost master of long-form solo development — although that, like all such assessments, is debatable. (To me, he is not more structurally compelling at extended length than, say, Booker Ervin, let alone Coltrane. But then, there are few areas in jazz where you couldn’t make the case for Trane being the MVP.) It seems beyond debate that he is an original stylist, of course. (So was Booker Ervin!) But what is his style?\n\nHow many of Sonny Rollins’ fans own any of his work from after the ’60s? After a meditative hiatus that followed several flirtations with free jazz, climaxing with 1966’s turbulent East Broadway Run Down, Rollins settled into making a particular kind of studio album that he kept making, usually about once a year, for something like four decades. Usually with electric bass, often with guitar, these records show off the kind of music Sonny seems to cherish the most: a few modestly proportioned bop and modal vamps, strutting calypso, ballads mostly from the ’30s done in a sweet-and-sour style, and, most controversially, a healthy dollop of contemporary electric R&B. Sonny’s obvious and serious interest in the rhythms and textures of contemporary Black pop (at least up until the ’80s), and his lack of interest in any extravagant displays of ambition have always frustrated those listeners and critics who want to see him as The World’s Greatest Living Jazz Musician (TM), and as the leading torch-bearer for America’s Classical Music. (Even 1985’s The Solo Album, presented as two huge edifices of unaccompanied saxophone recorded at the Museum of Modern Art, is, in fact, a bunch of 5-minute episodes stitched together from simple riffs, blues, and popular ditties.)\n\nAnd so the overwhelming bulk of his catalogue remains either unknown or entirely dismissed by even scholars of the music. And the musicians in Rollins’ orbit, most notably the great bassist Bob Cranshaw and Rollins’ nephew, the trombonist Clifton Anderson, spent decades taking abuse from “fans” and even critics frustrated by the saxophonist’s failure to live up to their expectations for him — expectations partaking of a kind of politics of respectability that Rollins himself clearly wants no part of. After all, given the chance to speak for himself, Sonny wants you to know that he’s a big Grover Washington fan. (And why the fuck shouldn’t he be? You listen to “Mister Magic” and tell me it doesn’t do everything Kamasi does but 40 years earlier and better.) It is not hard to figure out how Sonny Rollins acquired a reputation for being grouchy with critics.\n\nSomewhere in the ’80s a consensus began to emerge that Rollins was most himself in a live setting, and so it was an interesting strategy of critical rapprochement when, for the final leg of his recording career, he seemed to abandon the studio altogether in favor of curating several decades of live tapes. The Road Shows series started in 2008, and from the outset presented a curious mixture of archival finds from as far back as the ’70s and keepin’-busy new material, each volume cross-faded together to give the impression of a single concert.\n\nAs career-definingly great as Volume 1 was, and the subsequent volumes have (somewhat more sporadically) been, I feel a little sad that Sonny abandoned the studio, myself. Perhaps the stream of Sonny’s consciousness was indeed most untrammeled live, but somewhere in that stream is a vein of exhibitionism not usually apparent on the studio albums. It doesn’t, however, detract from the massive enjoyment to found in these last testaments from one of the greatest, quirkiest personalities in the history of the music.\n\nThe best part of the series, to me, is the way that it honors all sides of that personality, not just the ones that lend themselves most easily to a Jazz at Lincoln Center retrospective. The most recent volume, Holding the Stage: Road Shows, vol. 4, includes an airy piece of free funk called “Professor Paul” from 2012, and climaxes with an ecstatic 1979 reading of a tune called “Disco Monk,” whose title reflects its contents pretty much exactly (although the disco and Monk parts are completely separate).\n\nVolumes 1 (far and away the best of the series, but not eligible for this list) and 4 display these ecumenical, celebratory qualities the most. They bookend two volumes that are a bit more conservative in musical focus, although hardly less raucous. The middle volumes are also a bit more consistent in sound quality, which is always a consideration in not-always-professionally-recorded live jazz, but the sound quality never dips below the threshold of enjoyment.\n\nVolume 3 includes two further tracks from the 2012 Marseille gig that produced “Professor Paul,” alongside four other tracks from the previous decade. Its overall emphasis is on Rollins as the great long-form bop solo structuralist, and the music captured here is indeed up to his awesome stature, albeit a bit forbidding in its relentlessness. The most outwardly intriguing track might be “Solo Sonny,” a typical unaccompanied Rollins vignette, stitching together snatches of song and schoolyard rhyme into an elaborate intro for the bop standard “Four.” At the mere level of sound, it is awesome, and unusually sustained and successful for one of Rollins’ latter-day rhapsodies of this type.\n\nVolume 2 is the only title in the series that is completely “new,” but it is also perhaps the most retrospective in attitude. It mostly stems from a 2010 gig celebrating Sonny’s 80th birthday, and it is as woolly as the man himself, but also reflective, vulnerable, warm, and self-effacing. Sonny doesn’t even appear on “In a Sentimental Mood”; he performs the classic Ellington tune, in a notably elliptical and fragmentary version, on volume 4. Here, it’s a feature for guitarist Jim Hall, who (as Sonny tells us in his introduction) was the crucial ingredient in arguably the greatest-ever Rollins album, and who died in 2013. Similarly, much of “Sonnymoon for Two” is given over to one of the final recorded solos by Ornette Coleman — short-breathed and squeaky, but himself to the end. Rollins really relishes his role as MC here: you can hear the pleasure and humor with which he introduces old pals like Hall and Coleman, as well as young upstarts like trumpeter Roy Hargrove, bassist Christian McBride, and the then-85-year-old drummer Roy Haynes. Cranshaw, of course, is a fixture on bass, here and throughout the series. For those keeping score, of the six men I just named, McBride is still with us, as is the immortal Haynes, and of course, Sonny.\n\nThe final historical assessment of Sonny Rollins’ place in the jazz canon will probably have to wait until after he is no longer the World’s Greatest Living Jazz Musician (TM), no longer bearing the burden of an entire cultural institution on his great, grave shoulders. And, of course, it seems that there will be no further musical testimonies, no sense of how Rollins might react to an era of “alternative facts” with one of his trademark exquisite, affectionate tapestries of secondhand musical fragments. As I listen to what we do have, I find myself hoping that there are more entries in the Road Shows series in the offing. The act of revisiting these albums in order to write this essay has been more delightful than I expected. Perhaps it has something to do with the heedless, forward-looking quality of most of the volumes. It’s true that, generally, when the desire to revisit an old feeling strikes me, I’ll be more likely to play an evergreen like 1962’s The Bridge or 1974’s burningly funky The Cutting Edge or even 1964’s bizarrely moving cutting contest Sonny Meets Hawk. But when I want to be in the presence of the Colossus, I’ll hit the road and reach for these records.\n\nNOTE: This post is a follow-up to Lament for Grigorian, Canada’s finest music store; check out that post for more context.\n\nSince I published my lament for L’Atelier Grigorian, Canada’s finest music store (and, I think, its last surviving classical-jazz specialty store) six weeks ago, the piece has racked up hundreds of views, more than everything else I’ve written here put together, from all over the world. It’s been shared dozens of times, including by Canadian music industry watchers and by the Armenian Association of Toronto, a testament to the close connections between the Grigorian family and the larger Armenian diaspora. (It was a close Armenian friend of mine in California, actually, who got the ball rolling on the sharing.) For a piece I initially expected to only be read by a couple of my Facebook friends, the response has been very gratifying. But, of course, the response has little to do with me or my writing, and everything to do with how important Grigorian has been to the music community in this country for almost four decades, and the esteem it has richly earned in that time.\n\nWhen I got a chance to catch up with Mr Grigorian a few weeks later, I told him that if I had known so many people were going to read the piece, I would have tried to make it more journalistic. (“I thought it was pretty journalistic,” he replied, with characteristic generosity. Then he turned to his trusted son-in-law and partner, Victor Ghaloosian, and pursued the matter: “Victor, didn’t you think it was journalistic?”)\n\nBut the best thing the piece achieved was making it possible for me to get to know the Grigorian family a little better, and gain a deeper understanding of the extent of their achievement. Here, I hope to fill in some of the gaps of my last post, and also share some pictures of the people behind this great enterprise at Yorkville & Bay in Toronto.\n\n***\n\nIn the weeks since they announced the store’s imminent closure, I’ve made several “last” visits. I’ve learned names I was too shy to ask for before — shout-out to dedicated web manager/choirmaster Dr. John Holland and Mr. Grigorian’s there-almost-from-the-start partner-in-music Bob. I’ve met more family members, including Mr. Grigorian’s daughter Talin (a one-time colleague of my friend in California), who like everyone else is heartbroken at this beacon of music in Toronto closing its doors.\n\nI’ve heard wonderful stories from the man, the legend, Harmik Grigorian, about his four decades in the music business. Some of the best stories have involved major figures in classical music and opera in this country, artists whose names would be familiar to even casual followers of the art, who got their start selling CDs on consignment at Grigorian before moving on to careers of international status. I’ve learned about famous fans of the store over the years from Marlon Brando to Dustin Hoffman to Kristin Chenoweth (whose visit John had the foresight to capture for posterity). I’ve learned about the outpouring of love and gratitude, both recently and over the years, that the Grigorians have earned as tireless champions of “gourmet music” (to borrow Victor’s phrase again) in this city and country. In a fiercely difficult industry, they have endured through a combination of peerless connoisseurship and feisty salesmanship.\n\nFrom Victor, I’ve heard glorious firsthand stories about artists from Joe Lovano — whose capacity for whisky made him an instant legend — to Jimmy Smith, and especially the great producer George Avakian, one of the most important nonmusicians in the history of jazz. The Avakian connection poured forth with many unforgettable second-hand anecdotes. (When I asked Victor how he managed to get Avakian to take him so readily into his confidence, he replied simply, “Well, I’m Armenian.”)\n\nGrigorian is currently in the process of blowing out its inventory at extraordinary discounts. Some of the most irreplaceable items — the things that have been on the shelf for decades — are going for 50% off. Even in this, the awesomely singular nature of the store is revealed.\n\nAccording to one account, Grigorian was the first music store in Canada to import CDs. This was back in 1983. Consequently, the first CDs to be played over the radio in this country were bought at Grigorian. And indeed, for years, Grigorian has made it possible for me and other like-minded discographers to collect Japanese and European pressings, some more than 30 years old, some of titles whose domestic reissues, even, went out of print years ago, at excellent prices (now made incredible by the discounts).\n\nThe handfuls of imports that lucky visitors to Grigorian this weekend will leave clutching are symptomatic of the dedication with which Grigorian has always stocked obscurities, rarities, imports, and the like — not because they were sure bets to sell, but because of the conviction that great music deserves to be appreciated and presented with care. I have never seen a record store whose stock went this deep. But it wasn’t scattershot: the method to the accumulation has always been obvious, a method that has always affirmed that great art deserves to be taken seriously, and part of taking it seriously is curation. The fact that they did this with jazz as much as with classical music must itself count as advocacy for an art form that is still not always accorded this level of dignity in institutional spaces.\n\nWhat will be lost when Grigorian is gone is not only a place to find all of these things in one place, not only a chance to buy them at reasonable prices, but the expertise that brought them together, understood and could elucidate their importance, and the will to present them as crucial parts of the canon — Beethoven and Blue Train both. And it was always undergirt by genuine love, never pretension. After all, it was at Grigorian that I had my first chance to process Avengers: Endgame (Victor and I had a great conversation about it), and to join in the staff’s collective enthusiasm for the ’80s pop songs on the soundtrack to Bumblebee. Christ, I’ll even miss the feel of the little leather pad that their card machine sits on top of. It’s characteristic of the unassuming elegance of their operation. (It is funny what memory chooses to enshrine. Sometimes, I still have dreams about browsing through the upper floors of the Sam the Record Man flagship store, and that closed in 2007).\n\nGrigorian will live on online, and will keep on taking phone calls from music lovers across the country, and their expertise isn’t going anywhere. But still. When I asked Mr. Grigorian yesterday how the process was going, he said simply, “It is painful.” It is a painful time to love music, to be a student of history, when the rapacious impulses of landlords and developers are only interested in an imagined future where every city will be an interchangeable major chord of glass and steel, stripped clean of the chiming extra notes and humanizing vibrato of culture.\n\nGrigorian’s final weekend of business-as-usual will be June 29th-30th, 2019. It will stay open for a short while afterward as they begin their transition online.\n\nAnother of the centers of jazz and classical music culture in the city of Toronto is a victim of “development.” After 39 years, arguably the finest music store in Canada, L’Atelier Grigorian in Yorkville, is closing in the middle of June. The Grigorian family will be moving their operations online.\n\nIt has always been a family business. Its most visible fixtures in recent years have been the determined Mr. Grigorian and his son-in-law, Victor. Together with a team of true music lovers and experts, the Grigorians have made it their business to promote what Victor ruefully characterized to me as “gourmet music, not fast food.”\n\nI became aware of Grigorian thanks to an ad on Toronto’s Jazz FM (91.1) in 2011. At the time, I was a graduate student at the University of Toronto, which sprawls across the handful of blocks to Grigorian’s south and west. I regret that it took me until then to learn about the store, and it is a little surprising that it did take me that long since by then I had already spent a decade roaming the city, mapping it out music store by music store. Still, stepping into Grigorian for the first time was like stepping into Shangri-La. It was the most massive selection of jazz recordings I had ever seen in one place. I barely scratched the surface of the classical selection, which was somehow much larger.\n\nIt wasn’t just the volume that was impressive, though. The racks were lined with Japanese and European imports dating back to the early ’80s. Pressings so out-of-print the internet discographies were barely aware of their existence. And yet there they were, priced at $19.99 or less. (And that’s leaving aside the discounts Mr. Grigorian occasionally extended to steady customers, as he eventually came to do for me, as I approached the counter with another stack of rare Zoot Sims titles.) And to supplement the main stock, on the surrounding walls could be found a mass of random backroom stock — a trove of titles, like the glorious Prince Lasha-Sonny Simmons session The Cry, so obscure that no-one knew how long they had even been there. They didn’t even have price tags. Brought to the counter, they usually ended up being reckoned at $19.99 — needless to say, well south of collector’s market value.\n\nI bought 3 CDs that first day — a lot for a penniless grad student. One was the debut 1942 recording by the aptly-named trumpeter Bunk Johnson, perhaps the most legendary figure of prehistoric New Orleans jazz after Buddy Bolden; another was the Coltrane-Shepp New Thing at Newport; and I think the other was Max Roach’s famous We Insist!: Freedom Now Suite. Over the years I have gone on to spend thousands of dollars there, collecting dozens of cherished discs by Booker Ervin, Oliver Nelson, Sonny Rollins, Sonny Clark, Art Pepper, Zoot of course, and countless others. It was at Grigorian that I collected most of the hard-to-find traditional, swing, and mainstream albums that shaped my knowledge of that music. It has been a place to discover the neglected ’70s and ’80s gems by jazzmen most references are happy to consign to previous eras. It was even where I got my hands on a bunch of indispensable avant-garde and free stuff, including Charles Gayle. (I bought up almost all the Gayle they have ever had in stock, but they still have a single copy of his incredible 1994 live recording, Look Up — somebody go scoop that up! It’s barely $15 with the discount!) It has also been my go-to for new releases. Many of my favorites from the last several years have been Grigorian impulse buys.\n\nEven the laptop I’m typing this on has a Grigorian Special Import sticker affixed to its keyboard. That little (g) insignia always promised something special — something you couldn’t, of course, find anywhere else.\n\nEarly on, Mr. Grigorian used to greet me at the door and ask me excitedly how work was going on my new album. It turned out he thought I was the then-18-year-old piano phenom Jan Lisiecki. I corrected him, but this happened several more times and became a running joke between Victor and me, long after I had lost enough hair and (re)gained enough bulk that there was no longer a resemblance. Finally Mr. Grigorian greeted me one day, just as warmly, but adding firmly, “You are not Jan Lisiecki.”\n\nA few years ago, the store lost about a third of its footprint. I thought the writing was on the wall then, but Grigorian kept going, undiminished in its vitality, a community center for jazz and classical fans. During the long college and university strikes of 2015 and 2017, it was a place where music-loving teachers and sympathizers met, talked politics, hummed along to Zoot’s immortal solo on “The Man I Love” (maybe that was just me), and regrouped.\n\nThis unassuming music shop has long been incongruous in its location, at Bay and Yorkville, in Toronto’s toniest retail strip. So close to where so many sallow grad students are plying their lonely trade, it was just about the only thing in the area not designed to make such people — people like me — feel mis-shaped, mistaken, misfit. Now the landlords have decided to jack up the rent to an impossible $30,000 a month.\n\nIt is not hard to put another record store closure in context. It is a regular hobby of music lovers to despair about an industrial environment where the top 100 songs, all generated by the top 3 corporate conglomerates, earn 90% of the revenue, while everyone else starves. But Grigorian’s fate is more closely tied to the situation that is driving countless other businesses and cultural landmarks in this city to oblivion, where landowners see themselves as “investors,” and nothing trumps the unlimited promise of a 52nd-floor condo suite perpetually listed on Airbnb.\n\nThis is part 2 in a continuing series. Click here for part 1 and a prefatory note:\n\nALBUMS OF THE DECADE: Iris DeMent — Sing the Delta / The Trackless Woods (Flariella, 2012 / 2015)\n\nAt the start of the 21st century — which he entered at the age of 60 — Charles Gayle began a career transition that has been as radical as it has been largely unremarked. After spending the ’90s enjoying a rise from homelessness and obscurity to the forefront of the world free jazz scene — which he quickly set alight as a rediscovered exponent of the scorched-earth New York tenor style of late Coltrane, Ayler, Pharoah, and Shepp — he suffered a sudden fall from grace, as his outspoken fundamentalist Christianity put him out of step with the values of the institutional spaces that foster jazz careers. I discussed this situation in one of my most-clicked pieces on The Jazz Duck, “Charles Gayle’s religion,” and also in a subsequent review of a concert appearance in Toronto last summer. As I noted then, the reaction to Gayle’s sermonizing had a quality of punching down: without defending Gayle’s 25-year-old outbursts about abortion and homosexuality, which most of his listeners would rightly deplore, we can still recognize how much easier it has been to marginalize a penniless Black genius than to grapple meaningfully with the still-dominant structures of institutional misogyny and homophobia that keep such prejudices in the mainstream, just as surely as they keep jazz’s (even “avant-garde” jazz’s) academic gatekeepers in their positions of privilege.\n\nIn any event, Gayle’s marginalization by the avant-garde seemed to kindle in him an attraction to the more traditional idioms and gestures of jazz. So, starting with 2000’s startling Jazz Solo Piano, Gayle’s art has become increasingly expansive, thoughtful, and humorous, explicitly engaging with the touchstones of the jazz tradition as a whole — from stride to swing to bebop and bossa and beyond — without losing sight of his signature preoccupations.\n\nGayle will be 80 on February 28th, and, inevitably, is not as prolific as he once was. Still, his comparatively scant work this decade has meaningfully deepened his recent efforts toward consolidation. After a relatively low-key period, he began the decade with two unusually high-profile releases, Look Up on ESP and Streets on Northern Spy (both 2012). Most Gayle records come out on small labels with limited distribution, and these were no exception, but they received more coverage in the jazz press than is typical for him, and probably sold half-decently too. Look Up is an archival release, a tape from the raucous 1994 period (complete with an extended fundamentalist rap of unusual poetic complexity), and it does indeed capture Gayle at a peak of intensity and inspiration. Streets, by contrast, was all-new, the rare 21st-century Gayle record where he is on tenor throughout, a boisterous and extended saxophone tour-de-force with some unexpected funk in the drums.\n\nBut my choice for Gayle’s album of the decade is this one, Live at Jazzwerkstatt Peitz, recorded in the summer of 2014 and released a year later on the German Jazzwerkstatt label. Airier than Streets, more genial, it places Gayle in the company of a rhythm section of rare sensitivity. I have no idea what the Jazzwerkstatt Peitz festival is like in person, but on the evidence of this record it’s a warm, brightly lit event, maybe even outdoors.\n\nThe shared leadership billing on the cover is reflected in the extensive solo time granted to bassist Parker and drummer Drake, particularly the former. Both sound to be in a musing mood, Parker coaxing rhapsodic sighs out of his bow. As for Gayle, working over brief fanfare-like themes from Streets, Ornette, and elsewhere with a great big Sonny Rollins-esque tone, he lights on humor, melancholy, and passion, weaving deliberately through the stops in between.\n\nFor the concert’s middle half-hour, he is at the piano. Unexpectedly, Parker and Drake stay on, and so Gayle leads a traditionally-constituted piano trio for perhaps the first time on record. Echoes of Monk, Jaki Byard, and Mal Waldron ring through “Gospel” and “Texturen” before Gayle himself invokes the “Angels” and returns to tenor for an encore that puts “Giant Steps” in a rusty blender and launches the concoction heavenward on the back of a funkily ascending Parker riff.\n\nEvery movement is shot through with the vulnerability that has always been the most intimate way in which Gayle was touched by Trane. No record this decade has better encapsulated to me the joy that is so integral to jazz.\n\nA few months ago, I began a career overview of McCoy Tyner, in honor of the 80th birthday (10 December 2018) of the soft-spoken pianist who may be the most wholly original musician in the history of jazz. I started by reviewing his last (final?) recordings, released between 2007 and 2009. This time, I’ll take a first step backwards.\n\nAs I suggested in my last entry, Tyner’s solo career lends itself to breaking down into phases more readily than, perhaps, that of any other jazz musician of his stature. It begins with the records he made while signed to Impulse! at the same time he was in Coltrane’s group (1962-1964). These records seem designed to establish his bona fides as a bebop player at the time of the controversy over the more avant-garde things he was doing with Coltrane. They are, in other words, quite conventional “hard-bop” recordings for their era, mostly piano trios, with a lot of standard tunes and blues, comparable to (for example) Red Garland’s classic Prestige trios and distinguished mainly by their excellence in the idiom. The most important of these records is probably 1964’s Today and Tomorrow, one of the very few with horns and (with the vamping “Contemporary Focus”) the only one that really points his way forward.\n\nAfter leaving Coltrane in 1965, and suffering a period of struggle, Tyner moved to Blue Note — where he had been a semi-credited house pianist for years — in 1967 and generated an increasingly ambitious set of albums in the remainder of the decade that definitively expressed his originality and genius. These acts of self-definition — The Real McCoy, Tender Moments, Extensions, and the rest — set up his spectacular second wind as one of the world’s most popular and acclaimed jazzmen. In the ’70s, budgets and ambitions alike soared to produce the holy ruckus of his albums for the Milestone label.\n\nBy the mid-1980s, though, the incredible momentum that had been driving Tyner suddenly slackened. Personal changes (including a divorce from Aisha, his wife and muse since 1961) and changes in the aesthetic values of the jazz business as a whole both played a role in changing the way Tyner presented himself. As jazz became more institutional, Tyner largely shed the powerhouse post-Coltrane horns he had employed in the ’70s (such as Azar Lawrence, George Adams, and Sonny Fortune) and returned to playing mostly in a trio. He did less composing, played more standards, and increasingly seemed to be looking to his own earliest songs for material. The boldly Pan-African and Asian textures and gestures of his most ambitious work largely fell away; traditional jazz techniques like stride started to emerge in his playing, taking their place. Above all, Tyner decisively pulled back the throttle on his own piano technique, for the first time since the early ’60s.\n\nAlthough he was still clearly himself, Tyner’s new low-key guise dovetailed neatly with the emerging institutional construction of jazz as African America’s classical music, as embodied in different ways by figures like the Marsalises and Billy Taylor. The iconography of Tyner in the ’70s was the artist casually dressed and bathed in sweat from a torrential outpouring of free pentatonic inspiration — as seen on the cover of 1973’s Enlightenment. Now he had entered his Tuxedo Era.\n\nThe Tuxedo Era is the period of Tyner’s career that I can speak about the least knowledgeably. Most of the albums that I associate with this period are relatively hard to find at the moment. So I have only a couple of records, for example, by his prolific trio of the period, with the almost alarmingly versatile Avery Sharpe on bass and Aaron Scott on drums. I have written about their 1991 Enja album, Remembering John, in this space before; it’s a genial, and indeed rather casual record in which none of the players seem affected by the reverent mood that is typical of other Coltrane tributes. For that matter, it’s an altogether more modest effort than Tyner’s own classic entry in the genre, 1972’s Echoes of a Friend. Where once Tyner’s introspection had taken on uncompromising proportions and intensity, here he is happily reminiscing on favorite riffs and calling tunes both with and without evident connection to Coltrane, such as Monk’s “In Walked Bud.” (The attraction to Monk tunes is a recurring theme in Tyner’s Tuxedo Era.) Still, at this point, Tyner’s playing largely retains the glassily precise linear articulation that had always it so immediately exhilarating (check out his version of “Giant Steps“!) — the hands still capable of striking independence, the long-breathed lyricism and sudden harmonic juxtapositions reminding you constantly whose record it is.\n\nThe “trio” — billed as such — returns on 1996’s Infinity, Tyner’s contribution to the then-newly revived Impulse label. (It has since revived several more times.) Actually, this time the group has expanded to a quintet, with some extra percussion and, more significantly, the addition of Michael Brecker on tenor. To me, the record is above all one of Brecker’s most impressive showings, but it is a significant Tyner item too, a kind of late tour-de-force with several new compositions, including the immortal “Mellow Minor.”\n\nStill, throughout the record there is a kind of diffidence in the way Tyner interacts with Brecker that is almost shocking in light of how he had once worked with saxophonists. Brecker’s urgently beautiful playing on Tyner’s “Flying High,” a rollicking take on Monk’s “I Mean You,” and (of course) Coltrane’s “Impressions” is framed by Tyner choruses that are almost like exquisitely, almost daintily wrought cameos.\n\nMuch the same could be said of the acclaimed and beautifully-recorded Blue Note solo recital Soliloquy from 1991. Tyner’s solo playing during this period is again basically a containment of the “mighty utterance” (thank you, Cook and Morton) of his ’70s work, albeit with a much more relaxed attitude toward humor and sentimentality, and a general attitude of consolidation rather than the old heedless advancement. The album’s songbook typifies the backward-glance quality of so much of Tyner’s work during this later phase of his career: he revives some of his own earliest compositions (1962’s “Effendi” and 1964’s “Three Flowers” and “Twilight Mist“), homes in on a similarly narrow slice of his time with Coltrane (“Lonnie’s Lament,” “After the Rain,” and “Crescent” twice!), and otherwise concentrates on familiar standards.\n\nA live big band date from 1988, Uptown/Downtown, offers further evidence of Tyner’s retrospective orientation during this period. “Three Flowers” again reappears, as does part of 1973’s Enlightenment suite, this time busily rearranged into the brassy “progressive big band” style of (for example) the bands shown in the movie Whiplash. There is also a “Blues for Basie” that almost defines how this phase of Tyner’s career differs from what came before. As might have been suggested by my comparison to the music from Whiplash, the arrangements — mostly not Tyner’s, I think — gesture toward an institutional big band sound that Tyner’s previous work for larger groups (such as 1968’s ecstatic, idiosyncratic, ironically titled Tender Moments, or the later Song of the New World) had never hinted at. Again we get the sense of a great artist happy to embody a cultural conception of what jazz is supposed to sound and feel (and look) like, rather than trying to reshape the culture in his own image as he once did.\n\nThe Tuxedo Era comes to a close with a fine album for Telarc, Illuminations, recorded in late 2003. It is significant as Tyner’s last fully committed studio project; only the anomalous and producer-concocted Guitars (discussed in volume 1 of my “McCoy Tyner reflections”) has followed. For perhaps the last time, Tyner presents several new originals, and, on tracks like “The Chase,” explodes with a playful virtuosity that his final trilogy of albums never touches. Terence Blanchard and longtime Tyner associate Gary Bartz are an unexpected team, but each (especially Blanchard) plays brilliantly. Most crucially, Tyner seems to be more at ease weaving through them and playing off their inventions than he did with Brecker or would with Joe Lovano. There is no deference, only great jazzmen laying it down on quality, occasionally surprising material. There is little of the mystery and ambiguity that marks his work still to come, but there is much more ease and assurance.\n\nYou might call it predictably excellent. This is the kind of record Tyner seems to have made again and again during his Tuxedo Era — each new work made to seem mundane only in the light of a lifetime of sustained and challenging brilliance, and in the face of a stylistic signature established almost whole in 1963 (or 1967 or 1972) that now emanated undigested out of practically every space where jazz was played. Tyner’s statements had always come on in such a steady rush that it was hard to appreciate them individually for what they were. Whatever acknowledgement his new work was to receive was always going to be, in a sense, a lifetime achievement award. Among other things, his subsequent records — and the silence that has followed — show him working to restore to his new music the missing sense of moment.\n\nWhen I was first getting into jazz, there were no smartphones, and I didn’t even know that many people with mp3 players. Circa 2000, when I bought my first jazz album — Coltrane’s Ascension — I knew one person who owned a Diamond Rio, which struck me at the time as cool but quite useless. I was much more impressed by the same friend’s MiniDisc recorder, which seemed both practical and futuristic. iPods, when they appeared, were an expensive luxury item that I didn’t really notice people carrying around until I was already at university for a couple of years. Maybe mine was the last generation of school kids to not necessarily go everywhere with headphones on.\n\nI did, though. I was a very late adopter to mp3 players — I didn’t get my first one until 2006. But I also never had a portable CD player. What this means is that I spent the entire ’90s and about the first half of the 2000s toting around a Walkman and a bunch of tapes. (My father was so embarrassed by this that he implored me to buy an iPod.) During that time, I would buy my CDs at Sam the Record Man or Tower Records or HMV, when all of those stores had sizable jazz annexes (the HMV at Yonge & Dundas in Toronto even had an “Out” section devoted to avant-garde jazz!), then take them home and dub them over onto 90-minute TDK cassettes to listen to on the way to school. I listened to albums like Olé Coltrane — an early favorite — over and over again on wobbly Walkmen through little headphones with spring-loaded headbands that cost $30 at The Sony Store in a suburban mall. It was wonderful.\n\nAt a time when I could not yet recognize when one chorus of a song ended and another began, or that “Dahomey Dance” was a 12-bar blues, at a time when the solo passages between theme statements sounded like a single continuous musical “event” whose structure I was quite oblivious to, the emotional qualities of the playing of men like Coltrane, Freddie Hubbard, and Elvin Jones could still exhilarate me. The wow and flutter of my Walkman, the fuzzy edges given to the sound by my cheap headphones, were no barrier to my enjoyment of the music — quite the contrary, in fact.\n\nBecause they were among the best-regarded and the cheapest of Coltrane’s albums, several of my first jazz purchases were his Atlantic titles, recorded between 1959 and 1961 and released in dribs and drabs between 1960 (the sensational Giant Steps) and 1970 (an odds-and-ends compilation, The Coltrane Legacy). The CDs I was buying had first been released in 1989 as part of the Atlantic Jazz series. They look like this and are today prized by “audiophiles” for being relatively “flat” transfers (i.e., with no part of the signal artificially boosted) of the original stereo recordings. I didn’t know this at the time; I bought them because they were cheap and plentiful, and indeed you can probably still pick up a copy of Giant Steps or My Favorite Things in the series if you are lucky enough to live in a city that still has a CD shop with a jazz section. Thousands upon thousands of them were manufactured. For all I know, they might still be being manufactured today.\n\nThe warts-and-all presentation of the audio on these CDs means that anomalies like tape dropouts or the console hum that suffuses the Coltrane Plays the Blues album are reverently preserved. The original stereo presentation of these albums, with their extreme separation (drums and piano right, horn and bass left, nothing in the middle), and characteristically “dry” Atlantic sound devoid of reverb, is similarly honored.\n\nI loved these albums so much during my Walkman days. As an undergraduate, I listened to them compulsively. But as the fidelity of my playback equipment slowly improved — as cassettes gave way to high-bitrate mp3s and eventually to FLAC files on an SD card, and as I traded my $30 Sony headphones for Sennheiser and finally Grado headsets — I found myself enjoying the records less and less. The sound of Coltrane’s horn was vague and artificial, I thought, compared to his sound on his records on the Prestige and Impulse! labels. It just didn’t sound like a saxophone to me. The extreme stereo separation and lack of natural reverb contributed to the sense of unreality. But this feeling of unreality and the lonely isolation of the players would have bothered me less if I didn’t find the frequencies favored by the stereo presentation so hard on my ears.\n\nAnd I was also aware that these stereo presentations, which had become the standard in the digital era, were probably not the way these recordings were originally meant to be heard. Although two- and three-channel multitrack recording had slowly gained ground to the point that it was almost universal by the late ’50s, stereo phonographs for home listening were much slower to catch on. Coltrane himself had mono copies of session tapes run off for home listening, and it was only toward the end of his life (he died in 1967) that home stereo systems had finally become a mainstream piece of household equipment the way flat-panel TVs are today.\n\nAnd so I was excited to receive the 2016 The Atlantic Years In Mono box set as an anniversary present this year. Unlike Coltrane’s recordings for the Prestige or Impulse! labels, engineered by Rudy Van Gelder, where the left and right channels of the original two-track recording were simply combined to create the mono master (and presented as-is for stereo release), Coltrane’s sessions for Atlantic were recorded in eight-channel multitrack. The engineer, Tom Dowd, then mixed these multitrack recordings down into separate stereo and mono presentations.* A Van Gelder mono presentation — it’s not really accurate to call it a “mix” — is usually identical to the stereo presentation played with your system’s “mono” switch engaged. Not so with an Atlantic mono mix.\n\nAt first glance, especially for a beginner looking for a way to collect a lot of important Coltrane in one shot, the Atlantic Years In Mono box set is a bit frustrating. This is not so much for what the box includes, or for how it is packaged (it’s quite a beautiful little object, with its textured box and little reproductions of the original LPs) but for what it omits. A warehouse fire in the 1970s destroyed most of Atlantic’s tape library, including all traces of the mono mixes for several of the most important Coltrane Atlantics. These include My Favorite Things, Coltrane’s Sound (the source of such famous originals as “Equinox” and “Central Park West”), and Coltrane Jazz, the lesser-known but almost equally worthy follow up to Giant Steps. The swinging, unpredictably-arranged “26-2,” which leads off The Coltrane Legacy, is the only trace this box offers of what’s missing: it’s from the same October 1960 session as half of My Favorite Things and half of Coltrane’s Sound.\n\nWhat this means is that, aside from Giant Steps itself, the Atlantic Years box set is filled out with what seems like a lot of second-string Coltrane. Although many fans — including me — cherish the discursive, slightly unfocused Olé (bashed out in a hurry to complete the contract after Trane had already started recording for Impulse!) and Coltrane Plays the Blues, you’ll find fewer fans of the two co-led records, The Avant-Garde and Bags & Trane. The latter is a warm bebop date with the Modern Jazz Quartet’s vibraphonist Milt “Bags” Jackson, while the former finds Coltrane joining trumpeter Don Cherry (not that Don Cherry!) to front a version of the Ornette Coleman pianoless quartet of the period, playing mostly Coleman’s tunes. I used to think these were the least musically successful albums under Coltrane’s name, particularly the pretentiously-titled date with Cherry. Considering how powerfully he was influenced by Ornette in the years to follow, Coltrane sounds remarkably uncomfortable with the idiom here. But the mono presentation does at least reduce his isolation from the other players, which makes the music easier to enjoy on its own terms. The same is true of the album with Bags, where a more natural instrumental balance makes Coltrane seem more at home in the music and Jackson less deferential. I’m never going to love The Avant-Garde, but with this presentation of Bags & Trane I’m finally able to enjoy Coltrane lustily playing bebop with one of its greatest practitioners.\n\nThe mono mixes do not magically make Dowd’s recordings sound like live music the way Van Gelder’s drums and horns (if not his pianos) usually do, or the way Columbia recordings of the same time often do. Mono recordings from Atlantic — for example, the MJQ’s Fontessa — can sound as distant and unnatural and unreal as stereo ones. (Conversely, the mono mix of Giant Steps that leads off this set is so compressed and intense that I will never find the music as approachable as it is in even its imperfect stereo mix.) But, for several of these records, the mono mixes do restore a sense of coherence to the band sound that isn’t there in stereo. These mixes are also a little more balanced across the EQ band — Coltrane no longer takes a straight razor to your right ear on the session with Jackson — and there is more of a feeling of “room” about them.\n\nThe differences are subtle, but sufficient that I can return to these albums and find, once again, the pleasure they gave me when I first heard them — and sometimes more. It is wonderful to hear Olé Coltrane and Bags & Trane (and the outtakes from those sessions collected on The Coltrane Legacy) as if for the first time.\n\nIt is easy to complain about the limitations of Dowd’s approach, but it is important to keep in mind that the inconsistencies of his results were the result of daringly experimental methods. Dowd was one of the midwives of multi-track recording, which means he played an important role in the development of modern studio recording and mixing technology and technique. You can draw a straight line from the art of Tom Dowd to that of a 17-year-old Soundcloud rap producer making a masterpiece in Audacity.\n\n*: According to The John Coltrane Reference (ed. Lewis Porter) — the compilers of which had access to the Warner tape library — Dowd actually recorded the eight-track multitrack, the stereo “mix,” and the mono “mix” simultaneously on three different decks. That is to say, according to them, the instrumental balance and levels were determined “on the fly” the same way Rudy Van Gelder’s sessions were. But I have read other accounts that suggest a more conventional multitrack recording-then-mixdown procedure was followed at Atlantic.\n\nOriginally published 18 December 2017\n\nNOTE: I initially published this list of reissues and archival releases on Facebook between my #3 and #2 picks for my favorite new releases of 2017. The headnote reflected that, but there was no introduction otherwise. I may update this as I unpack some stragglers from the tail end of the year.\n\nAlice Coltrane: THE ECSTATIC MUSIC OF ALICE COLTRANE TURIYASANGITANANDA: a respectful, even reverent, recuperation of this fascinating musician’s second (third?) life as a spiritual leader and maternal purveyor of quirkily modernized Black Hindu community worship music — bhajans — in settings reminiscent now of Earth, Wind, and Fire, now of Nina Simone (displaying Alice’s own husky, intimate singing), and once in a while a 1980s sci-fi synth movie soundtrack. Initially on privately-distributed cassettes in the ’80s and early ’90s, these pieces have now been beautifully packaged and annotated, and are infectiously joyful, sometimes haunting. Even my wife likes this CD.\n\nThe Beach Boys: 1967: SUNSHINE TOMORROW: not just for obsessives — the stereo remix of the Wild Honey album that kicks off this generous set is a welcome bit of recovery of some of their most rhythmically alive music. But the Smiley Smile/Lei’d In Hawaii archival scouring on disc 2 is where I really get off. The studio material is full of mind-boggling discoveries for any fan of their post-Smile ‘67-’69 homemade period (who knew such-and-such a track was based on/part of “Wonderful”??!!). And the newly discovered, complete fake live album on disc 2 is exquisitely gorgeous, and in the delicate, whimsical Smiley/Friends spirit.\n\nSidney Bechet: BECHET SOUVENIRS and Bobby Jaspar: BOBBY JASPAR’S NEW JAZZ: Two generous exhumations — with multiple albums per disc — in generally very good sound from Sony Europe’s incredible, ultra-cheap Jazz Connoisseur line of some of the best of French jazz in the early 1950s. Both are revelatory snapshots of postwar Euro jazz, “trad” and “cool” respectively, in the innocent and isolated time just before the Coltrane crisis. The two albums collected on Bobby Jaspar’s New Jazz are particularly excellent: Jaspar was a tenor player probably best known in his day for being Blossom Dearie’s husband. John Coltrane — who had incredible tonal recall — once almost mistook the Belgian tenorman for my man Zoot Sims in a blindfold test, even though he had by then recorded with both of them. These richly arranged, intermittently experimental albums (including a 12-tone piece, “Paradoxe,” composed by André Hodeir) are to be recommended enthusiastically to fans of Miles Davis’s Birth of the Cool period.\n\nThe Bechet disc collects three (!) albums, including the prime hard-swinging Bechet of the title album and the more peaceable Ambiance Bechet, which includes a classic version of “The Old Black Magic” and a definitive take of Bechet’s signature tune, “Petite Fleur.” Bechet’s French rhythm sections rock him to delirious heights.\n\nSpacemen 3: FOR ALL THE FUCKED UP CHILDREN OF THIS WORLD WE GIVE YOU SPACEMEN 3: this spot ought to be reserved for the long-overdue reissue of Spiritualized’s once extremely rare, mail-order-only 1992 live record, Fucked Up Inside — which I have coveted since I was 15 — but even though the latter definitely came out at the end of November 2017, it bears a 2016 copyright. So instead, I note this perhaps less worthy candidate — also welcome, if less so, and also overdue, but less so, a reissue of their parent group’s 1984 demo tape. The band, I must disclose, has boycotted it as unauthorized, like everything else on the Space Age imprint controlled by their despised former manager, Gerald Palmer. And there is only about 28 minutes of music here. But the truth is, I’ve also coveted a copy of this one (though less than the Spiritualized title) since I was 15, and it sure is cute to hear Jason Pierce & pals as teenagers pretending, convincingly I might add, to be a more earnest version of The Cramps. For completists only? But I am one."
