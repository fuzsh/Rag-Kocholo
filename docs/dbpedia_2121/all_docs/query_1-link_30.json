        "text": "Perhaps there’s some hope for this genre after all.\n\nOne of the major complaints I have with country music right now is what I’ve labeled a lack of maturity: Songs tend to focus on nihilistic partying, sketchy (and generic) hookups, and caustic breakups—actions and activities that rarely look past the next morning and tend to be the concerns of the young. Things that might be labeled as the trials and tribulations of life rarely see the light of day on the airwaves: There might be a ode to a life well lived like Jordan Davis’s “Next Thing You Know” or a track dedicated to a child like Elvie Shane’s “My Boy,” but generally the meta is pretty prescriptive: You’re either looking for a relationship or sifting through the wreckage of one, and you never forget to mention what you’re drinking or what you’re driving. In short, I’ve gotten older, but mainstream music hasn’t aged with me, instead preferring to chase a younger demographic with more time and discretionary income to spare.\n\nDierks Bentley released Gravel & Gold almost a year ago, but in the chaos and cacophony of 2023, I didn’t get to dig into the album until recently. Bentley exploded onto the scene back in 2003 with “What Was I Thinkin’,” and while he’s made his share of concessions to the meta to maintain his relevancy in Music City over the last twenty years, he’s also, well, aged twenty years in the process, and thus brings a perspective, and perhaps even a hint of wisdom, to his songs that many of his contemporary peers lack. Bentley isn’t afraid to look beyond the day-to-day trivialities and try to say something with his music, and has the gravitas behind his voice to make you believe that he believes in it all. I wasn’t terribly impressed with Black and was fairly meh on The Mountain, but I like Gravel & Gold, and think that it might be his best album since 2010’s Up On The Ridge.\n\nI tend to talk about production first in my single reviews, and I’ll admit that Bentley plays it pretty close to the middle of the road on this album, at least as far as the arrangements go. I sometimes wonder if constant “guitar-and-drum” critique I throw at people is a bit unfair given that 95% of the songs that have ever been recorded use this as a foundation, but it should be a starting point rather than an ending point, and I really wish that artists would build on these instruments to create something interesting and meaningful instead of just tossing in a token keyboard, steel guitar, or drum machine and calling it a day. Gravel & Gold doesn’t go too far in this direction, but there’s generally at least one notable instrument addition in each track (generally a bluegrass-influenced one, reflecting Bentley’s background in the genre), and the “standard” instruments at least try to match the mood of the sound to the mood of the song: Reflective songs that want to give the listener to chew on, like “Sun Sets In Colorado” and “Still,” lean on acoustic guitars for most of the heavy lifting, while songs that want to make a statement and add some muscle to their proclamations, like “Same Ol’ Me” and “Beer At My Funeral,” tend to feature the electric axes more. There are a few exceptions here (“Cowboy Boots” mixes in some mandolin, steel guitar, and even a fiddle, while “Roll On” pairs up a mandolin and dobro to great effect), but overall there’s a notable consistency in the sound here, with a few minor adjustments made to suit the song’s specific needs. Instrument tones tend to be rougher-textured to give the tracks a worn and weathered feel, furthering the feeling the these songs come from a place of hard-won experience. I also like how each instrument maintains its unique identity when it’s added to a mix; there are blended swells of sound, but there aren’t any indistinguishable walls of noise to speak of. In the end, the best way I could describe these mixes is that they feel raw and real, they’re intricate without too much polish, and they’re universally pleasant to consume, and you’ll rarely be tempted to reach for the skip button.\n\nI’m on record calling Bentley and Eric Church the current heirs of the Outlaw movement, and one of the advantages such a position grants over Bentley’s more straitlaced, sanitized contemporaries (people like Tim McGraw, Kenny Chesney, and even Brad Paisley) is that people assume that you’ve seen some, er, stuff, and thus you can be both the hard-edged individual who enjoys a good time and the wizened voice of reason who can touch on deeper subjects. Bentley covers both angles here: He can be that rough and restless spirit on songs like “Same Ol’ Me” and “Beer At My Funeral,” but can also make some larger observations about life on “Walking Each Other Home,” “Still,” and especially “Something Real.” He can stretch the story a bit too far at times (I’m not convinced Bentley’s reading Kerouac in his spare time), but when he’s extolling the virtues of natural serenity on “Still” or listing all the benefits of being single again on “Ain’t All Bad,” you can’t help but believe in what he’s saying and where he’s been. His voice sounds as good as it did twenty years ago, but the man behind it speaks like the nearly-fifty-year-old that he is, and his natural charisma is augmented by the authority and vision that his career has bestowed upon him. (I also give him a lot of credit for knowing how to deliver a lighthearted and/or jokey song without making the narrator sound out-of-touch or unlikable. I can’t help but think that songs like “Beer At My Funeral,” “Ain’t All Bad,” and “High Note” would have been absolutely butchered by a contemporary artist like, say, HARDY.) There’s still a lot to like about Bentley as a performer this deep into his career, and honestly I don’t see a ton a good candidates stepping up in the current generation to replace him when he and Church ride off into the sunset.\n\nThe songs are the true stars of the show here, since they dare to go beyond the current radio meta, touch on broader topics, and even sneak in some thoughts and advice regarding life and time. Heck, the best of the bunch (“Something Real”) strikes directly at said radio meta by saying the quiet part out loud: The current radio fodder focuses on an ephemeral and youth-centered lifestyle that eventually fades away, but talking about what might come next—meaningful moments that represent “something real”—”won’t fill up the coliseum on the edge of Tupelo” because it won’t resonate with the typical concertgoer and thus can’t be sent over the airwaves. It’s not quite Church’s “Stick That In Your Country Song,” but it’s not far off, and its measured tone and reasoned explanation might make it less toxic to the radio powers that be (even if it probably won’t be a single). Bentley takes his own advice and proceeds to touch on some supposed radio taboos: “Still” suggests using the serenity of nature to counter the frenetic pace of modern society (and also nudging people to make sure there are always serene places for people to come to), “Walking Each Other Home” highlights the importance of connections (to family, to friends, to even the items that bring us joy and comfort) and encourages people to walk whatever path through life that is right for them, and “Roll On” encourages people to go out, broaden their horizons, and experience the wider world around them. Even “Gold,” which was deemed safe enough for the radio, encourages people to look on the bright side and appreciate the journey as they wander through life, a nice counterweight to all the hopelessness and negativity that’s plagued country music over the last few years. There are certainly the less profound, more fun tracks here (“Beer At My Funeral,” “Ain’t All Bad,” “High Note”), but even these come with a welcome dose of wisdom: For example, “Beer At My Funeral” acknowledges the good times and the wild ride their life has been and asks people to celebrate their life rather than mourn their death (a sentiment I’ve heard more than a few times from people over the course of my lifetime), while “Ain’t All Bad” has a touch of Kelsea Ballerini’s “Miss Me More” in it, noting how much the speaker had changed during the course of a relationship and noting that having “the old me back” mitigates the pain of the relationship ending, at least to a point. Yes, there are some middling tracks here (“Heartbreak Drinking Tour” is a vaguely-geographic, completely-unengaging lost-love song that could have been delivered by anyone, and while “All The Right Places” might be cliché by design, it resorts to laundry-list lyrics at times and just doesn’t motivate the listener to care about where the narrator was dumped), most of these tracks are at least decent overall, and the best of the bunch here cross into must-hear territory, with the common theme being that the protagonist is speaking from a place of experience, and trying to offer thoughts and suggestions based on what they’ve seen and felt over time. There’s none of the immaturity here that I’ve been railing against for years, and that omission alone gives this disc a significant leg up over its competition.\n\nSo what was the point of this exercise? Gravel & Gold may be a solid album, but why revive a feature last seen in 2016 to talk about it? Honestly, this is a reminder for me to take a chill pill the next time I get overly frustrated at the state of country radio, because the radio only scratches the surface of what’s out there. (Notice that Dierks Bentley and his team actually passed on putting some of the radio hits he’s had since The Mountain, such as “Gone” and “Beers On Me,” on this album.) Gravel & Gold doesn’t feel like a record that was written for the radio, but rather as a vehicle for Bentley to offer some unfiltered ideas about how to navigate the world from a guy who’s been there and done that. It’s exactly the sort of record I’ve been looking for for a while now, and if Bentley is hiding such gems among his deep cuts, perhaps there’s hope for other artists who keep foisting unpalatable radio drivel on us (I mean, if Morgan Wallen’s One Thing At A Time has thirty-six freaking tracks on it, the law of averages suggests that at least one of them has to be passable, right? Right? …Yeah, I have my doubts too). I mentioned in my review of “Gold” that Bentley was “playing the last few holes of his mainstream career,” but after a few passes through this this album, I hope he sticks around to play another game or so, because I think people can still benefit from what he has to say.\n\nRating: 7/10. Check this one out if you can.\n\nIf you could sum up 2023 in a mixtape…would anyone pay full price for it? (Editor’s note: And if you post it in 2024, does it still count?)\n\nI’ve been complaining a lot about just how repetitive the music (and thus my reviews) have been getting over the last few years, and this playlist is no exception. Consider my opening paragraph from last year:\n\n“I mentioned last year that ‘2021 felt like a continuation of all the badness that was 2020,’ and 2022 opened with those same feelings of selfishness and nihilism. No one seemed to care about anyone but themselves, and they either wanted to fiddle (or play a hand-clap loop) while the world burned or grab everything they could get for themselves regardless of who they stomped on in the process. There was a lot of cynicism, hopelessness, and fear for the future, and it wasn’t terribly pleasant.”\n\nHonestly, you could increment every date in that quote by one, and it would still be pretty darn accurate. All the badness that was 2022 not only rolled right along into 2023, it somehow managed to get even worse:\n\nWar and conflict? The Ukraine-Russia war grinded to a stalemate, the United States seems to be losing its war of wills against Vladimir Putin, and Israel and Hamas started trading blows late in the year in a fight that’s threatening to become a wider regional conflict.\n\nGun violence? As of 12/29, 650 mass shootings have been documented in the U.S., up from 647 in 2022, and Congress has gone back to its usual do-nothing ways, seemingly content to let the problem continue to fester.\n\nInflation? It’s slowed in recent months, but the U.S. is still tightly in the grips of an affordability crisis, with staples like food and housing still putting a squeeze on household budgets.\n\nExcessive anger in country music? Unfortunately there’s still more than enough to go around these days, culminating in “the first [song I’ve heard] I’ve thought was actually dangerous.” People still want to lash out at others for the slightest of perceived slights, and it remained a major theme for 2023.\n\nExcessive copying in country music? That’s still here too, and given how well older music seems to be faring against its newer counterparts, don’t expect it to go away next year (in fact, given what we’ve seen this year, expect it to get more blatant before it gets better).\n\nFrom a playlist perspective, 2023 felt less like a standalone set and more like a deluxe re-release of what we got last year. I don’t even hold the sliver of hope that I brought up at the end of last year (if anything, I see things getting a lot worse before they get better). Was it even worth making such a playlist if it was just going to be yet another repeat of last year? Was it even possible to come up with something viable?\n\nWell, the truth is that there’s really no way to know until you try it, so once again we’re here to put together a soundtrack for the year that was. The only rule for this list is that there are no other rules. Songs are not restricted by genre, artist, original year of release, or anything else (in fact, given how surreal and absurd this year felt sometimes, weirdness may actually strengthen a song’s case for inclusion). All that matters is whether or not a song can be tied back to 2023 in some shape or form.\n\nWithout further ado, I present the official Kyle’s Korner playlist for 2023.\n\nMorgan Wallen, “Last Night”\n\nUnfortunately, we have to start with a song that was not only the biggest song in country music, but perhaps the biggest song in all of music is 2023. “Last Night” spent eight weeks atop Billboard’s airplay chart and SIXTEEN weeks at #1 on the Hot 100, making it the most popular song we’ve seen in this genre in quite some time. This is all I’m legally required to say about this song, so that’s all you’re getting.\n\n…Oh, who am I kidding? This is the Internet! If you don’t have anything nice to say, you say it anyway, and you say it in ALL CAPS on every social media platform you can create an account on.\n\nI consider Wallen to be “a talentless hack grifting off of the Nashville beer/truck meta and the genre’s Ex-Boyfriend trend, a man with zero redeeming qualities and some serious baggage,” and I stand by that assessment even as he’s become one of the biggest stars in the genre. “Last Night” was a dishonorable mention on my year-end lists, and deservedly so, from its “dour acoustic guitar and…limp synthetic beat” to its “delusional, unlikeable narrator” to its weak, robotic-sounding vocals. It was far from the worst thing Wallen released this year (that would be “One Night At A Time,” with “Thinkin’ Bout Me” not too far behind it), but there was no reason at all for this song to resonate with listeners, and yet it resonated in a way that country songs haven’t done in years, perhaps even decades. Why?\n\nWell, as we look back on 2023, perhaps “Last Night,” with all its narrator’s delusions, offered something that was in exceedingly short supply this year: hope. This relationship, like everything else in modern society, appears to be broken beyond repair, and yet the speaker still believes, against all reason or evidence, that the couple will stay together (of course, given their less-than-enthusiastic tone, it sounds more like resignation than hope). People are desperate for something to believe in right now, and if that something is a buffoon with no empathy or vocal skill…well, you’ll take any port in a storm.\n\nI was (and remain) so sick of this joker that I decided to let ChatGPT try to write the review for this drivel instead of dealing with it myself (more on that later), but I’m afraid I’m going to be dealing with Wallen a lot in the foreseeable future.\n\nI can’t tell you how excited that makes me…\n\nTaylor Swift, “Shake It Off (Taylor’s Version)”\n\nOf course, for all Wallen’s success this year, the discussion of who reigned over music in 2023 starts and ends with two people: Beyoncé and Taylor Swift. It’s an interesting development, because neither one brought a whole lot of new music to the table this year: Renaissance and Midnights came out in 2022, and Speak Now (Taylor’s Version) and 1989 (Taylor’s Version) were re-recordings of albums from 2014 and 2010. Instead, it was their live performances that led them to dominate the year: Swift’s tour is estimated to have collected a billion dollars this year, with Queen Bey collecting nearly $600 million during her own 2023 tour, and both events became massive cultural phenomenons in the process. (And don’t forget the movies! Swift’s The Eras Tour became the highest-grossing concert film of all time and one of the biggest movies of the year, while Renaissance: A Film By Beyoncé debuted earlier this month.)\n\nYou could argue that this pair’s radio presence might have been the smallest of their impacts this year, so “Shake It Off” is more of a placeholder than anything else, but when you can drive the conversation the way these two artists did in 2023, you deserve to be mentioned in this post and on this list.\n\nMeat Loaf, “Life Is A Lemon And I Want My Money Back”\n\nThere are plenty of angry songs from this year that could be added to this list, but I’m going to roll with a mostly-forgotten rock single from 1993 because I when I heard it a few weeks ago after not hearing it for a while, it struck me just how well it reflected a common sentiment in 2023: Everything around us seems broken in some manner, and now people just seem to be mad at everything: At love, at faith, at schools, at work, at towns, at family and friends, at pasts and futures, and so on. The last few years have drove people to some pretty dark places, but 2023 just kept piling on and driving people deeper, until there was no light visible at all. With its dark, menacing production, Meat Loaf’s angry, intense vocals, and writing that called out anything and everything (notably “all the morons and all the stooges with their coins”; we’ll come back to that in a second) and framed the situation as “a never-ending attack”, the song sounds a lot less out of place now than it did thirty years ago, and probably would have become a cultural and political flashpoint were it released now.\n\nInstead, we got this…\n\nOliver Anthony, “Rich Men North Of Richmond”\n\nStop and think for a moment: When was the last time you heard this name, or even thought about this guy? For a brief moment, Anthony was all the nation could talk about, plucked from relative obscurity in Virginia to become a sort of folk hero through this song. Just as quickly, however, he was cast aside in favor of the next big item in the news cycle, going from a total nobody to a household name and back again in nothing flat.\n\nAs a song, “Rich Men North Of Richmond” really isn’t that good, despite making some valid points about the economy and the political system. It leaned on “misinformation and lazy stereotypes” that weakened it attempts at making any sort of persuasive argument, and was delivered with an “undercurrent of resigned nihilism” that kept the track from moving beyond all its persistent whining. Just like “Life Is A Lemon…”, the song was able to channel the frustrations and grievances of its audience, but didn’t bother to move them to take action and actually address what bothered them.\n\nThe level and intensity of the angst and aggression (both in the previous two songs and in society at large) is problematic became it’s both aimless and unproductive. Yelling about “the stooges with their coins” or “the rich men north of Richmond” might make you feel better for a moment, but it’s pointless unless it’s followed up with actions and policies to address income inequality, gun violence, the housing crisis, the suicide crisis, the drug crisis, the climate crisis, and everything else that’s making the world feel dystopian. We need to stop wasting our time lashing out at scapegoats, and instead invest our energy and money into fixing what lies at the root of these ills. Demanding a refund on life itself is just going to leave you disappointed and bitter, so let’s exercise our right to repair and face the challenges of our time head-on.\n\nTrace Adkins, “All Hat, No Cattle”\n\nSo what’s an album cut from Adkins’s 1999 album More…. doing here? Well, I just called out “Life Is A Lemon…” and “Rich Men North Of Richmond” for being all talk and no action, and one of the primary methods for ordinary citizens to take action is by voting for city, state, and national officials. Lots of people have exercised their voting rights over the last few years, and they expect whoever they’re sending to Washington to at least be a serious, committed politician who’s there to get things done.\n\nThis year, however, was the year that finally turned a harsh spotlight on what I call performative politicians (or perhaps “politicians-in-name-only”), people that come to D.C. only for the clout and the screen time. I’m not naming any names here, but y’all know who they are*—they’re the ones who are fixtures on cable television and fixated on scoring political points against “the other side,” but aren’t actually interested in, you know, actual governance. These sorts of people have always been a part of politics to some extent, but this year they made up enough of a critical mass that when they decided to pick up their ball and go home after not getting their way, they paralyzed an entire house of Congress for the better part of a month, leaving a lot of critical business to languish in the meantime.\n\n*Although in the case of a certain recently-excommunicated congressman from New York, we may never know who they really are.\n\nWhile we’re on that subject…\n\nQueen, “Another One Bites The Dust”\n\nIt turned out to be an exceptionally bad year to even be considered for the job of Speaker of the House. Kevin McCarthy kicked things off by needing 15 rounds of voting to get the job, and agreed to lower to threshold needed to oust him to a single vote…which predictably came back to haunt him ten months later, when he was unceremoniously booted from the position after having the absolute gall to work with Democrats to keep the government funded. What followed was equal parts comedy and tragedy, as candidates from across the GOP rose to the brink of contention (Steve Scalise, Jim Jordan, Tom Emmer) only to be smacked right back down again. It seemed that no one was in charge of the House Republican conference, and all the rest of the country could do was watch as one contender after another bit the dust.\n\nMike Johnson holds the job for now, but the speakership remains a hot seat, and if certain members of the aforementioned performative group decide they don’t like the way Johnson walks, talks, or submits his continuing resolutions, we could easily be up for more chaos and paralysis in 2024.\n\nJohnny Cash, “Five Feet High And Rising”\n\nNOAA reports that there have been 25 billion-dollar natural disasters in the US this year, and it feels like these events are getting more catastrophic (such as the Lahaina fire in Maui that killed at least 100 people) and closer to home (such as “The Great Vermont Flood” that washed away half of Montpelier this summer, and the Canadian wildfires that turned the sky orange in New York). These kinds of events are only going to become more common and more severe thanks to climate change, so I would be remiss if I didn’t include them in our yearly playlist.\n\nWith the ongoing transitions to greener energy and electric vehicles, it seems like we’re finally getting serious about acknowledging and even addressing some of these problems. Even if it’s too late to mitigate the broader impact of climate change, I remember President Obama saying to Hasan Minhaj that even small changes that can avoid the worst-case temperature increases could have major real-world impacts that might be the difference between someone’s way of life continuing or disappearing. Every little bit helps, so even if we’re a bit late to this party, we can still make a major difference in what happens going forward.\n\nGrandpa Jones, “Night Train To Memphis”\n\nOkay, we’ve dwelled on the bad stuff for long enough. It’s time to flip to the positive (or at least weirder) side of the ledger, and that opening strum of “Night Train To Memphis” is as good a transition as any. I’ve been a Grandpa Jones fan for as long as I can remember, but I wasn’t that familiar with a lot of his Hee Haw material, so stumbling across this track can be chalked up as another win for the YouTube algorithm.\n\nHowever, this also represents the evolution of the blog in response to my growing dissatisfaction with current mainstream country music. Reviews became much more of a chore this year than they have ever been, so I dropped my Pulse posts at the start of 2023 and began mixing in other content, such as retro reviews, rants about perceived trends in the industry, and a lot more gaming posts (I hope you all enjoy talking about Splatoon 3 patch notes!). The hope is that I could cover more positive topics and avoid the drumbeat of negativity coming from Music City, and while that wasn’t always the case, I think we were able to change the tone of the blog a bit for the better in 2023.\n\nSpeaking of the blog…\n\nJelly Roll ft. Lainey Wilson, “Save Me”\n\n2023 will go down as the year country music discovered the Internet. There were some cracks in country radio’s blockade in years past, but the dam really burst this year, and it was most evident in how certain artists (Wallen, Luke Combs, Zach Bryan, etc.) started putting up massive streaming numbers and launched themselves to the top of the Hot 100 and the forefront of the musical conversation (for better or worse, and unfortunately there was a lot of “worst” to deal with this year).\n\nThis surge in online interest was reflected at the Korner as well: Reviews of certain artists (you can probably guess which ones) started putting up some seriously strong view numbers, breaking records every time you turned around. In the end, 2023 had:\n\nThe most yearly views (134,796, up from 2021’s 118,139)\n\nThe most yearly comments (132, up from 2020’s 122)\n\nThe most monthly views (16,149 in September and 13,002 in August, up from 12,568 in January of 2021)\n\nThe most months with 10K+ views (9, up from 2021’s 6)\n\nThe most daily views (4,309 on Sept. 15, with no other day even topping a thousand)\n\nThat last one was driven by the above collaboration between Jelly Roll and Lainey Wilson, and while it was my least favorite of Jelly Roll’s releases, it supercharged September to break the blog’s monthly view record by several thousand views.\n\nAs frustrating as this blog has been this year, it’s also been the most successful year for the Korner by darn near every possible measure, and despite all my complaining, I’m still grateful for all of your support.\n\nBad Religion, “21st Century (Digital Boy)”\n\nOf course, the blog was only part of the story in 2023! My YouTube channel didn’t match its semi-viral heights of 2022, but it showed steady growth throughout the year, and even had its own year-end surge powered by my first forays into streaming. Splatoon 3‘s popularity has faded noticeably from its initial highs, but people still appeared to enjoy all of the umbrella-themed content (most notably the guide and informational videos), and mixing in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe for matches with the general public went over surprisingly well despite my lack of skill behind the wheel.\n\nAll across my “mini content empire,” all indicators were trending positive, but it’s come at a noticeable cost in terms of time and the fact that I’m now essentially married to the Internet and have become a true “21st century digital boy,” and can’t feasibly go a few days without it because the blog or the channel needs attention to maintain a schedule and satisfy the audience. This has been by far the hardest year to hold things together, and I don’t see this pressure alleviating without significant changes to…well, something. What will this mean for the blog going forward? It’s uncertain at the moment, but stay tuned…\n\nThe Gregory Brothers, “Boy’s A Liar Pt. 2 (Biden & Obama’s Version)”\n\nYou can probably guess what this is doing here. ChatGPT was launched late in 2022 to great fanfare, and we’ve spent the last year both marveling at the possibilities of AI and wondering if it’s going to end up replacing and/or killing us all.\n\nThis song, released back in March, is part of the initial wave of AI experimentation, as people tried to determine what was possible with the technology. (Said wave brought a number of presidential impersonators, with the current POTUS teaming up with past holders of the office to make tier lists, play video games, and cover Pink Pantheress and Ice Spice collabs.) Since then, however, I think the initial waves of hype and fear have died down, and both consumers and corporations alike are asking “What can this technology really do for us?” We’ve seen “overemployed” people use the technology to do multiple jobs, we’ve seen students use the technology to complete homework assignments, and we’ve seen businesses use AI to streamline everything from system maintenance to hiring new workers. It’s a powerful and flexible tool, and I expect its usage to only grow in years to come (although any transformative applications with the power to drastically reshape society still feel like they’re a few years away).\n\nI tried out ChatGPT v3.5 for my “Last Night” review back in April, and I wasn’t terribly impressed (but was terribly amused) by the results. This blog has remained 100% AI-free since then, but a) I have no doubt lots of my posts were used to train some of the large language models than underpin systems like ChatGPT, and b) I’ve actually found the technology useful on the video production side (although at this point, it’s limited to generating background images for videos and thumbnails, such as the sky here.)\n\nWill AI ever return to the blog and let me retire to a tropical island while it rants about Dustin Lynch? I guess we’ll see…\n\nDan Seals, “Factory Town”\n\nIn the meantime, while we wait for AI to take all our jobs, let’s celebrate the success that organized labor had this year! After years of nonstop headlines about corporate profits and executive compensation, unions flexed their muscles frequently and publicly this year, with major strikes in the automotive, entertainment, healthcare, education, and hospitality sectors. As a result, union members made some serious wage gains (“many unionized workers have won immediate pay hikes of 10% or more in just the last year”) and gained some important protections (“guarantees that at least at some battery plants, EV batteries will be made by unionized workers,” “an expansive set of [AI] protections that require consent and compensation for all actors,” and so on).\n\nWith continued tightness in the labor market and a sense that the public perception of the labor-management conflict has shifted in favor of the former, I’m hopeful that this trend will continue next year, and that some of the outstanding labor conflicts (Starbucks and Amazon in particular have been making news for their anti-union tactics) can be resolved in favor of the workers. If a company is doing well, the least it can do is share its spoils with the people that actually make the organization work.\n\nEpic Rap Battles Of History, “Elon Musk vs. Mark Zuckerberg”\n\nIn 2018, Peter Shukoff and Lloyd Ahlquist wrote a rap battle between two tech moguls with questionable practices and companies. Who would have thought that five years later, life would attempt to imitate art in the form of a probably-won’t-happen cage match between these two!\n\nIn truth, this is more about the owner of Twitter than the owner of Threads: By virtue of his penchant for drama and his stewardship of a fast-rotting social media platform, Musk seemed to be everywhere you turned this year, and usually for the wrong reasons. (Seriously, when you start to make the guy responsible for Facebook look like the reasonable party, you’re doing it wrong. Really wrong.) As a result of his mismanagement, the social media landscape seemed to fracture, and a whole bunch of new players (including Threads) entered the space trying to fill the void. Twitter remains one of the most prominent platforms for now, but I wouldn’t be surprised if that changes next year (especially since short-form videos seem to be outpacing microblogging in popularity).\n\nMusk’s outbursts of stupidity highlighted the dangers of being overly reliant on one person (wait, NASA’s space flights and Ukraine’s communication networks are subject to the whims of this guy?), but at this point Washington is too dependent on the man to make any drastic changes overnight. Hopefully this wake-up call will remind us not to bestow so much power and responsibility to an unelected and unstable individual in the future.\n\nWalt Woodward, “Orioles Magic”\n\nEvery sports fan feels like nothing ever goes right for their beloved franchises, so I think it’s time to recognize that 2023 was a pretty darn good sports year, at least for yours truly. The San Francisco 49ers reached the NFC championship game early in the year and locked up the #1 seed in the upcoming playoffs, the Florida Panthers made a surprise run to the Stanley Cup, and “Orioles Magic” returned to Camden Yards as Adley Rutschman, Gunnar Henderson, and the O’s won 101 games, claimed the AL East division title, and made following the sport during the summer enjoyable for a change.\n\nYes, there were no titles to celebrate and no guarantee that there ever will be, but the playoffs can be tough and the small sample size can induce a lot of randomness, so I think it’s important to celebrate success when it happens, and not dwell on the missed opportunity when it doesn’t. Then again, the Niners have looked pretty good; this could be the year they go all the way…\n\nDrake Milligan, “Goin’ Down Swingin'”\n\nWith the radio feeling as stale as it did this year, I did a lot of searching across YouTube looking for songs (old, new, or whatever) that were fun and interesting to listen to. While I declared Milligan’s “Sounds Like Something I’d Do” the best song of 2022, I didn’t actually get to dive deeply into his Dallas/Fort Worth album until this year, and when I finally did, this self-referential ode to Western swing stood out at one of my favorites, with its plethora of instruments and retro stylings.\n\nIf I have one wish for country music in the coming years, it’s that it steps off the trend-chasing treadmill for a while and tries to be a bit more eclectic with its single releases. Instead of force-feeding us the same old guitar-and-drum Ex-Boyfriend track or slick sex jam wannabe, inject a bit of diversity into the sounds, singers, and subject matter of the genre. Find some room for a fiddle, give the steel guitars and mandolins more room to breathe, find better and more-interesting ways to work in the electric axes and percussion (different tones, different kinds of instruments, etc.), and perhaps go outside the box a bit with arrangements (such as the use of the accordion here). Instead of shortening playlists and doubling down on the hottest artists, open the doors a bit wider and create spaces for more voices and more perspectives (for example, could we finally start getting some more female artists on the airwaves?). Stop raging about being wronged and start talking about the ups and downs of life a bit more, and maybe provide some wisdom that a listener can take away from the track and use long after the music stops. Just give us more from the music, and not less.\n\nWe should also acknowledge that there’s still a time and place for some of the trends that have plagued the genre for so long. Carefree party tracks, slick synthetic beats, and even some raw anger can still be part of the big tent of country music. I’m just asking to not be force-fed the same bland or angry meal over and over and over again, and for record labels to put some actual thought and resources behind the artists that they’re pushing today. The new music of today will be the old music of tomorrow, so make sure that you’re making a quality product, something that will stand the test of time and become the kind of song that future curmudgeons will call for in another few decades. If you’re going to make anything, at least make it the best that it can be.\n\nIf you need an example of what I’m talking about, how about this?\n\nAshley McBryde, “Light On In The Kitchen”\n\nI’ve already spilled a lot of virtual ink gushing over this song, so I’ll just say this here: This is the kind of song that will have meaning and value for a long time to come, offering advice and perspective that people will still need in a year, decade, or century. Between McBryde’s charisma and the varied approach of the writing (sometimes lighthearted, sometimes heartfelt), the message really resonates with the listener, and the production invites the audience in and keeps the writing in focus. I feel like we rarely get songs like this nowadays, and I’d like to see that percentage increase a bit in the future.\n\nSo where does all this leave us as we start another year filled with the potential to be great or miserable? Frankly, at this point I’m exhausted and have little to offer but platitudes, but I’ll try to say something meaningful: In a world that can feel dark and hopeless, try to be the light and the hope that you want to see. If there are problems in the world, step forward and help find solutions to fix them. If you have a passion, follow it, and share it with the world around you. If you find yourself despairing, look to others to help you find a way forward. We’re all in this together, so we’d better make the most of it.\n\nHere’s to another year at Kyle’s Korner. Let’s see if I take my own advice.\n\nWhile I was writing up my list of the worst country songs of 2023, I casually called this year “the worst year of country music ever examined on this blog” without really realizing what I was saying. I stopped for a moment and wondered whether it was an overstatement, but it wasn’t: Despite the surprising commercial and chart success that country music had this year, it produced the weakest crop of singles I’d ever had the misfortune of reviewing here at the Korner, and despite a slight improvement in the second half of the year, the overall review numbers came to the same conclusion:\n\nDespite the hope I professed at the end of last year, 2023 in country music has felt like one big nasty mess from the word go, and I’ve spent the entire year trying to answer one question: Why? I’ve offered a few explanations over several posts on the subject:\n\nThe cyclic nature of song topics lead to a lack of novelty (we’ve heard it all before), and there’s recently been a spike in songs that actively steal lines, riffs, and rhythms from older tracks (so now we’ve literally heard it all before).\n\nThere are a pair of disconnects at play, at least for me: One between the lives portrayed in songs and the lives people are actually living, and one between the emotions songs are portraying and how we actually feel. There’s a lot of “countrified” posturing and overt anger that simply doesn’t represent the way I live or the way I feel.\n\nThe music is reflecting a lot of other people’s feelings, however, and the overwhelming feelings across the nation right now are sadness, anger, and a general sense of hopelessness. Any happy songs you find trend towards the nihilistic self-destruction impulses of the Bro-Country and Cobronavirus eras, because who cares about the ramifications of your present behavior if you don’t see a future anyway?\n\nMuch like our infrastructure, we’re simply not investing in new music because the ROI isn’t high enough. Old music is outselling new music, and The Ringer summed up the industry’s feelings quite nicely:\n\n“The money talks: Most new music is not a safe investment. It’s easier with current technology to reintroduce and promote old and familiar music to the masses. The future seems bleak anyway. So let’s relive the cozy soundtracks to better days, together.”\n\nBrady Gerber, “Remix Your Canon: How Old Music Became the Biggest Thing in New Music,” Dec. 20 2023\n\nThere are, however, a few country artists that are making waves in the broader music industry in ways that we haven’t seen in a long time. The problem is that many of the artists making those waves (Morgan Wallen, Jason Aldean, Bailey Zimmerman, etc.) are also some of the worst offenders when it comes to making terrible music (go back and see how many entries the aforementioned three artists showed up on my worst-song list earlier this week…). The faces of the genre are also the faces on the ‘Most Wanted’ posters hanging up down at the post office, and that’s a bad look no matter what genre you’re working in.\n\nThe bottom line is that country music was pretty bad overall in 2023 for a lot of reasons, and given what’s coming down the pipeline in 2024, I don’t see things getting better for a while.\n\nHowever, the genre wasn’t universally bad this year, and given country music’s current downswing, it’s more important than ever to spotlight the artists that tried to do the right thing, even if it was only for a brief moment in time. Whether it was telling a poignant story, creating the perfect atmosphere with their sonic choices, or trying to inspire people to be better version of themselves, there were still genuinely good songs sent to the radio this year, and they deserve to be celebrated.\n\nThese are the best radio singles that I heard in 2023.\n\nLast Year’s Winner: Drake Milligan, “Sounds Like Something I’d Do” (final rating: 8/10)\n\nAs awesome as Milligan’s radio debut was, radio itself seemed to disagree: It languished at #40 on Billboard’s airplay chart, and he ended up not releasing a single at all in 2023. So who was able to claim the vacant crown?\n\nWell, before we get to that, let’s go ahead and…\n\nPour One Out For: Midland\n\nMidland doesn’t appear to have released an official single this year either (“Wichita Lineman” is listed on Wikipedia, but I haven’t found any sources indicating a definitive radio push), making this the first year since 2017 that the band will not appear in my year-end top-ten single list (breaking a six-year streak in the process). While the development doesn’t come as a surprise (the genre pivoted away from Midland’s retro style of music almost immediately after they arrived on the scene), it’s still a bittersweet moment given their incredible streak here at the Korner, and so in honor of their achievements, we offer a salute to Mark Wystrach, Jess Carson, and Cameron Duddy, and wish them the best of luck as they (hopefully!) try to rejoin this list in 2024.\n\nSo, no Midland and no defending champion? This year’s list is officially wide open, so let’s see who made the cut!\n\nHonorable Mentions\n\n#10: Jordan Davis, “Next Thing You Know” (6/10)\n\nArtists from the Metro-Bro era can be grouped into two categories: Those who eventually grew out of the trend, and those that didn’t. Davis, thankfully, seems to be in the former category: After being the first winner of my Worst Song Of The Year award back in 2017, he’s actually shown fairly steady improvement over the years, to the point where he squeaked by Kassi Ashton at the line to make this list this year. Sure, the production is suitably soft and reflective here and the story, while a bit generic, also feels timeless and projects maturity and wisdom, but after revisiting the tire fire that was “Singles You Up,” the biggest upgrade is with Davis himself: The slimy Bro trying to steal someone’s partner has (against all odds) grown into a person who takes relationships more seriously and come to the realization that our time on earth is far too short to act like a jerk. There’s a real positivity in his delivery here, especially when he gets to the part about the speaker being with their grandchildren, and you get the sense that he finally knows that there’s more to life than alcohol and hookups, and that there are far more ways to enjoy life.\n\nCould this all fall apart in a year? Absolutely (note that HARDY was on this list last year, and fell back to a dishonorable mention this year). Would it come anywhere near this list in a stronger year? Probably not. You can only play against the opponents you have, however, and given the trend I’ve seen with Davis over the years, I have a sneaking suspicion that this steady improvement might be sustainable, and that’s a good thing for everyone involved.\n\n#9: Corey Kent, “Something’s Gonna Kill Me” (6/10)\n\nI make a lot of comparisons between the metas of Splatoon 3 and country music, but both are in a similar place right now: They both feel wide-open and unsettled, and everyone involved is experimenting to see what the next blueprint for success will end up being. One of the mini-trends gaining traction in Nashville right now is…honestly, I’m still struggling to find a label for it (James Dean? Rebel without a Cause? Neo-Outlaw? They all sound clunky to me), but the general idea is that the artists have embraced an itinerant, hard-living lifestyle and an isolated, us-against-the-world mentality, and they’re just blazing through life the only way they know. Several artists have attempted to break into this lane, but Kent has done the best job of it thus far.\n\nWhat I like about this track is that it balances the free-spirit, devil-may-care attitude with a heavy dose of perspective: They’ve done a lot in their life, and while not all of it is healthy, it’s what makes their life worth living, and if it ends their life prematurely…well, they wouldn’t have it any other way. The production has a drive and a harder edge to it without feeling over-the-top or superfluous, the writing does a good job introducing/explaining the narrator’s mindset, and Kent sounds surprisingly credible in the classic role of the musical drifter. You could argue that this is just an extension of the nihilistic, self-destructive impulses I talked about earlier, but the narrator is clear-eyed about their choices and embarks on them not because they want to escape their life, but embrace it. Honestly, I can’t help but root for the guy (while also rocking out to the song), so I’m very curious to see where he (and this trend) go in the future.\n\n#8: Carly Pearce ft. Chris Stapleton, “We Don’t Fight Anymore” (6/10)\n\nThe whole Ex-Boyfriend/Ex-Girlfriend trend has been really aggravating to me, but to have a reason to be angry and not care enough to take it? That’s haunting, and that’s exactly what Pearce and Stapleton brought us with this track.\n\nThe song’s superpower is how it prompts your mind to wander and ponder the situation. I mean, just how bad have things gotten when you’ve basically moved on from a relationship before it’s actually over? What (and how much) could have come to pass to lead to this moment? Pearce does an excellent job selling the story here with her “cynical, defeated performance,” and while I’ve given artists grief in the past about “if you don’t care, why should we?”, Pearce’s flat, uncaring attitude is so striking that we have to know more. The artist/material synergy here is absolutely incredible, and Stapleton…well, he’s not a huge presence here, but it at least reminds the listener that there are two people involved, and both have reached the same conclusion. The production, highlighted by a fiddle and by Pearce’s signature dobro sound, helps it stand out from its peers on the airwaves, and strikes a good balance between being muted enough to reflect the narrators’ feelings and being reflective enough to invite the audience to think deeply about what’s being said. It’s just an all-around strong track, and while Lainey Wilson is the “it girl” of the moment, the genre absolutely needs to make some room for Pearce as well.\n\n#7: Thomas Rhett ft. Morgan Wallen, “Mamaw’s House” (7/10)\n\nWith Blake Shelton not releasing a radio single this year, Wallen is unquestionably the head villain on this blog now…so what’s he doing here? Well, aside from the fact that I seem to be a sucker for tracks like this (something Chris Janson has exploited to great effect over the years), and aside from the fact that Rhett remains in my good graces, I just really like the general approach of this song. The level of detail in the writing was good enough to let you close your eyes and put yourself in “Mamaw’s House,” and the acoustic foundation of the production (complete with some steel guitar riffs) created a warm, inviting atmosphere that made you want to visit this mythical place. Rhett has always shined on these sorts of family-centered tracks and this one is no exception, but hearing Wallen set aside his sleazy, aggrieved Ex-Boyfriend persona for a moment and just talk about the smells of the kitchen and the color of an old ’82 Lincoln was a breath of fresh air, and made him actually tolerable for a change. Despite its sepia-toned nostalgia, there was no hint of exclusionary thinking—in fact, it even felt hopeful in its message that if such a place existed, perhaps we’d all understand each other a little better and find some common ground.\n\nPart of the reason Rhett has been received so favorably here over the years is that he, like Davis is doing now, has moved away from his Bro-Country roots and started talking about things that felt more personal and meaningful. Wallen has got a lot of maturing and growing up to do, but there are templates and examples out there for him to follow, so maybe, just maybe, he’ll eventually find his way off of my sh*tlist and onto the road to redemption someday. (He’ll need to try a lot harder than he is now to get there, though.)\n\n#6: Jelly Roll, “Need A Favor” (7/10)\n\nI was impressed by Jelly Roll’s radio debut last year with “Son Of A Sinner,” but his tales of trials and tribulations have started to feel a bit redundant since then (“Save Me” might have been my most-popular post of the year, but I was pretty underwhelmed by the song). This one, however, seemed to grow on me as the year went on, and I think the reason can be boiled down to a single word: urgency. The sound grows both more foreboding and dramatic as the song progresses, with more pieces and volume being added over time (I think the choir deserves some real props for emphasizing the spiritual angle on the song’s climax and outro). There’s also a real sense of panic in Jelly Roll’s delivery that resonates with the audience, making the song feel like a real come-to-Jesus moment where the narrator hits rock bottom and is finally ready to change their ways and fix what’s broken. The writing does a great job setting the stage, talking about how the narrator tends to neglect their spirituality until a crisis hits, and that they know their ask is unfair, but they’re making it anyway because this moment and this relationship are just that important to the them. It’s really just another lost-love song at its core, but the over-the-top, all-in approach really raises the stakes and lets the listener feel how much the speaker cares about what’s going on and how determined they are now to make things right.\n\nJelly Roll isn’t quite at the level of Wallen and Luke Combs in Nashville right now, but he’s pretty darned close, and if he keeps doing what he’s doing (…okay, maybe he can be a little less repetitive with his releases), he’s got a good chance of becoming one of the stars that define country music in the future.\n\n#5: Luke Combs, “Where The Wild Things Are” (7/10)\n\nSpeaking of Combs, he’s the one guy sitting at the top of the genre right now that I can actually tolerate, mostly because he’s zigging while the rest of the genre is zagging, going against the grain and trying to define the meta instead of being confined to it. (As unimpressed as I was with his cover of Tracy Chapman’s “Fast Car,” at least he dared to drop a cover song instead of stealing from one like, say, Jake Owen.) Part of the reason I concluded that the whole James Dean/Neo-Outlaw trend was really a thing was because Combs declared it so with this release, although he wasn’t actually the causeless rebel in this story. Instead, he tells the story of a free-spirited sibling (and Dean clone) who went to California and lived the wild musician’s life, and does so with enough charisma to make people legitimately wonder if Combs actually had a sibling who died tragically (he doesn’t). The story has some notable gaps, but I like the way it’s presented (I called it an “honest, slightly-biased tribute that could only come from a family member”), and how the narrator experienced the lifestyle, decided it wasn’t for them, and walked away knowing full well that their brother never could. The production makes good use of a meta-based mix (it even finds an effective use for the dreaded wall of noise, using it to reflect the chaos of the brother’s life!), and strikes a good balance between “reverence and remembrance” with the resulting sound. It’s the sort of story song that rarely gets any airtime in modern country music, but when the man I dubbed Thanos years ago speaks, people listen, and when he drops a track this good, he’s got the power to start a movement and change Nashville for the better.\n\n#4: Dalton Dover, “Giving Up On That” (7/10)\n\nThe Ex-Boyfriend/Ex-Girlfriend trend has a lot of problems, but one of the major ones is how those that spew the vilest of vitriol never bother to look in the mirror and even entertain the possibility that they might be to blame for the failed relationship, or that they need to do anything to improve if they want to rekindle the flame. Sadly, when they do, they seem to get smacked down by the radio for it, as Old Dominion was for “Some People Do” and Dover eventually was for this track. It’s too bad, because this narrator has exactly the attitude that they should have when this sort of situation occurs: “Reflect, recognize that they share some (or is this case, all) of the blame…resolve to do better, and most importantly, actually follow through on that resolution.” Rather than pinning the whole mess on someone else, they looked at what they could do to improve their own behavior, and thus improve their chances of the relationship succeeding the next time around. After so many angry Ex-Boyfriend tracks, the listening public might be a little skeptical of a song like this, but Dover demonstrates the charm and charisma to make you believe what he’s saying, and as a radio debut he doesn’t have the baggage that many others in Music City have to overcome. The production is a bit generic and doesn’t fit the moment as well as it should, but it’s not enough to stop this revelation of a track from making an impact. I’m annoyed that country radio doesn’t seem to have an appetite for songs like this, and I really hope that Dover gets another chance to show what’s he capable of, because this is the sort of response to heartbreak that I’d like to hear from country artists, and the sort of approach I’d like to encourage listeners to start with as well.\n\n#3: Chayce Beckham, “23” (8/10)\n\nSomething I’ve been harping on lately is that country music’s frequent attempts to generalize their stories to apply to as many people as possible causes them to fall flat to anyone that doesn’t have the experience to fill in the gaps. Tell your own story, however, and if it’s interesting, it can draw in anyone and everyone, and “23” does just that. It’s a classic country tale of woe, and the writers give us every little detail that led the narrator down their path to ruin (with a little dash of hope that the narrator has hit rock-bottom and can rise up from the ashes). From working and drinking in Oklahoma to playing music and drinking all across the country to the drinking-aided collapse of a prolonged relationship, we see exactly what drove them to despair and the realization that they had gone too far, and it’s both captivating and heartbreaking. Despite his small/mediocre track record (in seven years we’ve seen him once before on the blog), Beckham does a great job filling the narrator’s shoes and giving life to the story, and between the writing and the vocals, you start rooting for the character despite all their self-inflicted wounds, and when they declare that they will be “sober by 24,” you’re hoping that this will indeed be the case. The simple, serious production does a nice job setting the mood, with the darker guitar tones invoking the image of the loner protagonist of an old Western, pushing through and doing what must be done regardless of their physical or mental condition. It’s a compelling and magnetic tale that you simply have to hear from start to finish, and it’s easily one of the best songs of the year.\n\n#2: Scotty McCreery, “Cab In A Solo” (8/10)\n\nWe’ve already acknowledged the Midland-sized gap in our list this year, but what I didn’t expect was for McCreery to step up to the mic and try to fill it! The production is exactly the sort of retro throwback I would expect from Wystrach, Carson, and Duddy, grounded in old-school electric and steel guitars and providing a blend of melancholy and pensiveness that reflects the narrator’s complex reaction to getting dumped. The premise here isn’t exactly earth-shattering (the narrator and their partner are on a break like Ross and Rachel, except that the partner immediately moves on and leaves the speaker drinking in their car), but the narrator at least offers a reasonable explanation: They know they messed up, they know there’s nothing they can do, and so they might as well make use of the tools at hand. Despite not being in the most sympathizable position, McCreery remains one of the best singers in the business, and he actually makes you feel for the protagonist despite their apparent transgressions. Yes, this is the still the worst song title I’ve heard in a long time, but when the song behind it is this solid and it actually works fairly well as a hook (and I’ve gone back to play it as many times as I have), you’ll forgive the forced wordsmithing for now. If anyone is looking for a late Christmas present, swapping the career success of Wallen and McCreery is still available on my list, because McCreery deserves better than what he’s gotten so far.\n\n#1: Ashley McBryde, “Light On In The Kitchen” (10/10)\n\nAs good and as replayable as “Cab In A Solo” was, however, it couldn’t stop McBryde from becoming the first repeat champion in the history of the blog. There’s just so much to like about this song, from its “reflective, positive, and generally pretty balanced” sound that provides just enough of a push to keep the track moving without getting in the way of the lyrics, to its superb writing that provides some useful motherly advice that nearly anyone can get some use out of, to McBryde’s straightforward, authentic-feeling delivery that makes the song feel both personal and relatable (with a small dash of positivity that hints at the warm feelings between the speaker and their mother). I love the way the writing floats effortlessly between silly and serious sayings to really make the song sound like it came from a parent or grandparent (it’s the lighthearted moments that build a rapport between advisor and advisee to make sure the important stuff resonates like it should). I like country songs that really mean something, that provide nuggets like this that you can take away and use long after the music stops, and there aren’t many in the business today who can deliver a message quite like McBryde, as evidenced by her track record on the blog (she’s almost as much of a staple on these lists as Midland!).\n\nYou know what I said about Pearce earlier? That goes double for McBryde. This women deserves a bigger platform in Music City, and the fact that she doesn’t have one…well, it’s yet another reason I’m so frustrated by this genre right now.\n\nSo this is the point in the post where I offer some closing thoughts on the year and perhaps a nugget of two of hope for the future. Unfortunately, I’ve got 30 minutes left to post this, my laptop battery’s down to 10%, and honestly, I don’t have any nuggets to hand out this year. Remember this statement I made last year?\n\n“It’s time to set aside the anger and selfishness that have defined our world over the last year or so, and come together to make meaningful progress towards solving the major issues that confront us today. If 2021 showed us what happened when we ignored these calls to action, 2022 gave us a hint of what we could do if we heeded them. Will 2023 see us reach across our divides or retreat back into our corners?”\n\nWelp, we spent most of 2023 stuck in our corners, and we spent the time preparing to come out swinging at each other in 2024, regardless of who might end up getting hurt. We discovered that there were a lot of people in positions of power who were more interested in performance than policy, and in grandstanding over getting things done. We end the year with more conflict in the world, more anger and hatred in our discourse, and more pessimism in our outlook for the future. Where the heck do we go from here?\n\nI have no grand schemes or twelve-step plans to get us out of this mess, but perhaps my recent foray into streaming can at least give us a place to start. When I’m playing games like Splatoon 3, I often get comments about how chill and positive I sound, even when I’m getting my head handed to me in ranked battles. I get the sense that people are really searching for any spark of hope and happiness in a world that absolutely refuses to provide one, so if you don’t see one around you, maybe you can try to be that spark yourself (a “Light On In The Kitchen”, you might say), and bring people together with a feeling of joy, even if it’s only for a brief moment. Perhaps if enough of us can bring people together, even if it’s over something as inconsequential as a steel guitar or an Undercover Brella, we can build on this momentum and eventually put together a coalition that can start thinking about tackling important things, things that we’ve neglected for far too long.\n\nHappy holidays folks, and thanks for coming out to the Korner in 2023. I’ll be stepping away from my regular post schedule for the rest of the year, but I still may have some things to post before 2023 winds down (after all, I haven’t made my official 2023 playlist yet!). Take care of yourselves and each other, and I’ll catch you on the flip side…whatever that means.\n\nIf you saw my list of the greatest games of all-time, you knew this was coming eventually.\n\nWhen it comes to reviewing games or music, there’s one fact that’s been slapping me in the face a lot lately: I’m old. You hate to admit it, you try to outrun it, and you never go around mirrors to avoid seeing it, but it happens to the best of us, and you eventually have to concede that people just haven’t seen the s**t that you have. Every generation needs their love songs and their platformers, and if it’s nothing but a repackaged version of an old idea that you encountered fifty zillion years ago…well, no one actually remembers or cares. Experience can help you distinguish between a ‘good’ and a ‘bad’ example of something, but looking at something from a fresh-eyed perspective can sometimes help you find the value in something you’ve already seen.\n\nWhen Nintendo announced a Super Mario RPG remake earlier this year, the biggest question that came to my mind was this: Why? The game looked like a faithful recreation of the 1996 original, but I’ve played through this adventure at least twenty times over the years, so what could the game show me that I hadn’t already seen? What tricks did it have up its sleeve? I mean, I was totally going to buy it day one, but would it just be playthrough number twenty-something, or would it be something really special?\n\nAfter finally freeing up enough time in my schedule to try this out, my one-sentence verdict is this: They didn’t screw it up, but “it” is really all you get. For me, that probably means a single playthrough and a walk down memory lane, but if you’ve never played this game before, or are new to the role-playing genre, this is a must-buy: I said in June that this game “might be the best entry-level RPG that has ever been produced,” and this remake is a declaration that it will never relinquish that title.\n\nUntil I was making my favorite-game list, I’d never really ruminated on just how important the timed-hit mechanic was to this game. With their in-depth stories and deliberate combat mechanics, RPGs can admittedly feel a little slow at times: You tell your character to do something, and then you sit there and watch while they go do it. When the story, characters, and gameplay are just that good, you can get away with being slightly more interactive than a movie (see: Triangle Strategy), but people who are new to the genre (especially younger players) are going to start looking for something more exciting very quickly. Not so with a timed-hit system: You’ve got to stay focused during every play if you want to succeed, and when you nail the timing for a perfect attack or a flawless block, it’s still as satisfying as it was twenty-seven years ago. Battles are surprising snappy in this game (so much so that when a Shy Guy repeatedly drops an attack like Lullaby that has to play through a 3-4 second audio clip, it feels like you’re waiting forever for it to finish), and are made even more so by allowing perfectly-timed attacks to damage every enemy on the field. (Suddenly I’m incorporating “chip damage” into my battle strategies like I’m playing Splatoon.) This is a game that wants to keep you active and engaged, and incorporating player participation with timed hits remains a great way to do it.\n\nThe story isn’t quite as novel as it was back in the day (Mario and Bowser have now teamed up in a couple of games), but it was a nice twist on the old formula back in the day: Bowser kidnaps Peach, Mario goes to save her…and then a sword smashes Star Road and crashes into Bowser’s castle, and suddenly you’re in a Final Fantasy game, coming together to save the world and make wishes come true again. While we’re stuck in an era today where Nintendo absolutely refuses to add new major characters to the Mario universe, meeting so many new and unique characters at the time (including mole, shark, and cloud people) was a refreshing upgrade to the small, familiar universe that Mario had inhabited up to this point. (This was also the moment when existing characters like Peach and Bowser finally got to show a bit more personality via their dialogue, and even Mario was pretty expressive as a silent protagonist. The fun one-liners that random characters would get here would also go on to be a staple of Mario & Luigi and Paper Mario titles.) The story also leans into the whole “this game respects your time” angle as well, as it’s still not a particularly long game to complete (unless you get lost in the forest). Despite that, however, the environments are as varied and vibrant as any mainline Mario game: Forests, volcanoes, sunken pirate ships, towers run by eccentric billionaires (a character type we’ve unfortunately grown accustomed to lately), the clouds, the seas, the islands, the castles, the alternate dimensions…it’s certainly not as massive or open as Super Mario Odyssey, but there’s still a lot to explore. The graphics might not be the revelation that they were in 1996, but the game still looks absolutely gorgeous, with enough detail to finally realize what some monsters were actually supposed to look like. I might be able to walk through this game with my eyes closed, but it’s worth keeping them open to see the results of this glow-up. (Also, the music remains as fire as ever, with remakes that remain faithful to the original while also putting their own spin on the classics.)\n\nOne option that caught my eye was “Breezy Mode,” which pulls back on the difficulty of the game (weaker monsters, more experience, larger item capacity, etc.) to allow players to focus more on the story without worrying too much about tediously grinding levels to compete with later enemies. The option confused me because even as a kid, I never found the game to be terribly difficult (and that’s still true in the remake, where I’ve yet to use any healing magic in my playthrough), so the fact that “hard mode” was just limited to some boss rematches felt a bit backwards to me. Here again, however, this game is leaning into its role as the gateway drug for RPGs: It wants you to experience everything it has to offer, even if you don’t have the time or the timing for the standard mode, and encourage you to try it again (and maybe other games like it) in the future. Hardcore fans might find this game a bit simple and easy for their tastes, but hey, that’s what randomizers and SMRPG: Armageddon are for, right?\n\nSo all of the above is great if you’ve never played Super Mario RPG before, but what about series veterans like myself? Honestly, there isn’t a lot here beyond what we got in 1996: Timed hits now charge a meter that will eventually allow you to unleash a “Triple Move” where all three of your party members attack your opponent, but it feels tacked-on and unnecessary, and I find myself mostly ignoring it in favor of the standard attacks and special moves. (It doesn’t help that the “Toad Assist” you’re stuck using until you get three characters in your party really isn’t that interesting.) Most of my critiques of this game stem from the differences between it and its predecessor: For example, battle moves tend to be a lot slower in the remake, so my button timing for action commands is consistently thrown off by the fact that my muscle memory is still calibrated to the 1996 game. I also don’t like how the A button has now become the confirmation button for every battle option, whereas you used to just keep pressing that option’s button (X for items, Y for specials, B for defense and other stuff) to confirm selections in the old game (pressing other buttons instead would act as the cancel option historically performed by the B button). The jump controls feel a bit too loose when using the left joystick to move around, and I found myself consistently switching to the D-Pad on my controller to get tighter and more-precise movement. These are legacy complaints, and I imagine players who aren’t burdened by the ghosts of past will adapt a bit more quickly than I have, but it’s still a bit disappointing that they didn’t do more to extend the story given what they already had.\n\nLet’s get back to the task at hand: Is Super Mario RPG, a game released in 1996, still worth your hard-earned money in 2023? If you’ve never played this game before, the answer is a definite yes: It’s an all-around good time with an engaging and fun gameplay loop, beautiful and interesting environments, charming characters, and a story that will draw you in without threatening to consume your entire life. If you’re a veteran of the original game, however, it’s a harder question: It’s still as fun as it ever was, but is a trip down memory lane worth the $60 purchase price, especially when it’s pretty short compared to other RPGs? You’ll want to think long and hard about just how badly you want to try those boss rematches, but as someone who considers Super Mario RPG the greatest game ever made, I have no regrets for adding this one to my Switch library.\n\nThe question of where this franchise goes next is a whole other post entirely (we know Paper Mario & The Thousand-Year Door is coming next year, but beyond that who knows?), but the presence of Super Mario RPG opens up some intriguing possibilities for this franchise in the future. With Mario & Luigi in limbo, Nintendo and Square Enix back on speaking terms, and one of the co-directors of SMRPG on record saying that they’d like to make a sequel…could this series finally get a proper sequel on Nintendo’s next console? We’ll have to settle for a remake of the original game for now, but at least this remake stands on equal footing with its predecessor, and will hopefully convince a new generation of gamers to add it to their own lists of all-time favorites when it’s all said and done.\n\nIf what’s old is new again, then maybe I’m not so old after all.\n\nWhat a weird way to end the year…\n\nWe’ve got a few remaining stragglers that need to find their seats on the 2023 year-end eligibility bus (unfortunately, Garth Brooks & Ronnie Dunn will be left in the terminal unless I can find a way to hear “Rodeo Man” in the next few days), and by sheer chance these are mostly a bunch of throwbacks to my plagiarism article from a month ago, with artists “interpolating” past works for a quick buck and a shot of hype here in the present. Do any of them hold up against their inspirations, or are they cheap knockoffs that would have been better left on the shelf? There’s only one way to find out…\n\nJason Aldean, “Let Your Boys Be Country”\n\nQuick question for Mr. Aldean: Have you ever actually listened to “Mammas Don’t Let Your Babies Grow up to Be Cowboys”? Because there’s a “don’t” in there that’s doing a lot of work, and it means that your song has the exact opposite message of the song that you stole the hook from. (Heck, there’s even a direct contradiction of the subject of vehicles, with Aldean imploring people to “let ’em ride ’round in trucks” while Waylon Jennings and WIllie Nelson caution listeners against letting them “drive them old trucks.”)\n\nPerhaps such a reversal would be okay if you were pulling a Kitty Wells and dropping an all-time clapback answer track, but this is just a generic rural glorification song filled with buzzwords and close-minded thinking. You’ve got the beer, the trucks, the Friday nights, the red dirt, the back roads, the hunting, the small town girls, the allusion to older (and better) songs…it’s just a bonfire and a brand-name whiskey away from filling up the whole blasted bingo card. Even worse, it’s got shortsighted lines like “let everything inside these county lines be his whole world” and “tell ’em there ain’t nothing greener than the grass you’re standing on right here,” actively discouraging people to go out, experience the wider world, and decide for themselves where the greenest grass is. Not only are you advocating for stunting the potential growth of these kids, but it’s really hard to convince people that you’re an authority on “country” when you’ve got hard-rock guitars blaring behind you from start to finish, creating an indistinguishable wall of noise and drowning out the steel guitar and everything else in the arrangement.\n\nAldean doesn’t put the force behind his voice that he’s had on past releases, but there’s a lot of aggression in the sound here, and with Aldean’s more-militant stance on “Try That In A Small Town” still ringing in our ears, “let your boys be country” feels less like a suggestion and more like a demand coming from him. He’s just not the right person to be delivering a track like this, and frankly, this track isn’t worth delivering at all.\n\nRating: 3/10. Nope.\n\nMatt Stell, “Breakin’ In Boots”\n\nThe opening line might be the hook from John Anderson’s “Straight Tequila Night,” but don’t be fooled: This is a much less interesting story about a serial heartbreaker who will…”leave your heart breakin’ in boots”? What exactly does that even mean? It doesn’t have a clever double meaning, and the idea of breaking in a pair of shoes has exactly zero to do with what’s going on here—it’s as if the writers thought it was so clever that they had to use it, despite the fact that it makes no sense. The song has the same “guy thinking about hitting on a girl” setup as Anderson’s track, but that’s where the similarities end. For one thing, the characters here are flatter and less compelling, with the with the picker-upper coming across as a generic dudebro looking for nothing more than a good time, and the object of their affection being a “cowboy killer” known for showing folks said good time and then walking away without a second thought. There’s no tragic backstory or romantic aspirations that might get us to root for the folks involved, and Stell himself sounds really sleazy when the song pushes him into his lower range (especially when it forces him to drag out words at the end of verses). I’m not a huge fan of the sound either: I think the tempo is a bit too fast and the drums push the song a bit too much, when the listener really could use time to reflect on what’s supposed to be a cautionary tale (also, we get yet another wall of noise on the chorus as the harder guitars and drums pair up to drown out everything else). All in all, this is a nothingburger that I’ll probably forget exists by the time I get around to my year-end lists.\n\nRating: 5/10. *yawn*\n\nHIXTAPE ft. Post Malone, “Pickup Man”\n\n…Okay, I have some questions.\n\nFirst of all, aside from the name recognition and crossover potential, what the heck is Post Malone doing here? This is the first time I’ve really listened to any of his work, and he’s a subpar vocalist at best, one who struggles to maintain his tone and sounds downright hoarse at times on this track, even on parts of the song that present very little technical challenge. (His flow is pretty rough at times too, which is surprising because isn’t this dude supposed to be a rapper in his day job?) The Joe Diffie recordings used here are from the mid-2000s, and it’s telling that even without his peak-90s fastball, he can still sing Malone under the table. (I still might take Malone over HARDY trying to sing this song, though.)\n\nSecond, aside from the obvious capitalization on their CMA Awards collaboration, what exactly was the point of releasing this song? On the surface, there’s a lot to like here (it’s an actual cover of the original song instead of a cheap derivative, and the production mimics the neotraditional sound and fun vibes of the ’94 original better than it has any right to), but it just begs the question: Why? If you’re going to copy the original track so closely that you have Diffie himself sing half the song posthumously à la “Tear In My Beer,” why would you ever choose to listen to this version over the original, especially when ’94 Diffie is so much better than ’23 Malone? It’s not a bad song, but it feels less like a heartfelt tribute and more like a cash grab to exploit the purchasing power of Post Malone’s fan base, and with the OG track residing comfortably on my iPad, I probably won’t revisit this cover much. It’s better than you might expect, but not good enough to unseat the original or make you remember it in six months.\n\nRating: 5/10. It exists, I guess.\n\nLady A, “Love You Back”\n\nThis is the lone entry that doesn’t have an obvious pre-existing inspiration (although that title is reminiscent of one of my favorite Easton Corbin songs), and honestly it’s probably the best of the bunch here. It’s the opposite of “Pickup Man” in the sense that it’s got a bunch of things got work against it rather than for it, and yet it succeeds more than it fails. I generally don’t like tracks that trade on nostalgia and I’m forever telling artists to just get over it already in the face of a breakup, but this one at least has some self-awareness in it: The good times were so good that they can’t let them go, but they know they have to because the feelings are one-sided (“a memory can’t love you back,” which is…okay, as far as hooks go) and they’re holding them back from what they really want in a long-term relationship. The level of detail is high enough to let listeners see just what the memories are all about, as well at what those memories are causing them to miss out on. The mix sounds pretty neutral overall despite the regular minor chords, but it’s got the sort of reflective vibe that the subject matter is looking for, and it builds to a natural climax as the song progresses. I also really like how the mandolin is given the spotlight at the very beginning, as it does a good job catching the listener’s ear and signaling the distinctiveness of the sound (even if it ultimately boils down to the same guitars, drums, and keyboards as everyone else). Charles Kelley and Hillary Scott remain capable vocalists who who do a nice job selling the story here (I actually get some “Need You Now” vibes from it, but this song appears far later in the timeline of a relationship), and together with Dave Haywood they put together some solid harmony work for the chorus. It’s been a while since we’ve heard from Lady A in any meaningful capacity, so it’s nice to know they can still throw together a decent effort to help break through the current radio malaise.\n\nRating: 6/10. It’s worth a few spins to see what you think.\n\nDon’t look now folks, but the end of the year is nearly upon us, which means it’s the last call for the last train bound for my year-end song lists. My review pace has slowed significantly in the past few years, but so have the chart escalators themselves, so the year-end backlog doesn’t seem quite as severe as it has in years past. Still, there are some big names who are still trying to punch their tickets to the big dance (which is likely coming next week), so it’s time to give them their minimally-required due and see where they stand. Without further ado, let’s get right to the action!\n\nParmalee, “Gonna Love You”\n\nDon’t look now, but it’s time for our yearly dose of Parmalee pop-country. Don’t worry though, you won’t taste a thing. (What, you thought getting pushed into a lightning round was going to change my opening line for these jokers? Not a chance.)\n\nSpeaking of reusing text: I copy-pasted a bunch of old review text for last year’s “Girl In Mine,” and honestly, I could probably use a lot of the same lines here as well. “Gonna Love You,” however, attempts to convey a lot more seriousness, leaning on a piano to carry the melody, using a simple vi-IV-V chord structure (ambiguous key center alert!), and using a foundation of hard-rock electric guitars (which wash out the mix on the choruses) and Grady Smith’s favorite snap track to create a dark, melodramatic atmosphere that feels way too far over-the-top for a standard “I’ll love you come what may” kind of song. The steel guitar provides a little flavor here, but otherwise the band sounds as generic and replaceable as ever, and lead singer Matt Thomas sounds just as indistinguishable as he always did. Instead of being romantic, there’s an awkward feeling of us-against-the-world embattlement both in the sound and vocals that just doesn’t feel justified—he’s acting like the relationship is somehow forbidden, despite no actual indication from the writing that it is. In truth, the writing is standard Boyfriend country fare: The speaker is proclaiming their undying love for their partner, and that “I’m gonna love you” no matter what (talk about a weak hook). What’s missing is any sense of history here: For all we know, the narrator just met this other person, and thus the track falls into the same trap of over-assuming that a lot of Boyfriend tracks do (and Thomas is not nearly strong enough as a singer to pull it back). It’s the kind of forgettable drivel that you hate to waste this much time and this many words on, even in a lightning round, and my only hope is that a release this late in 2023 means I won’t have to deal with this group again until 2025.\n\nRating: 5/10. Pass.\n\nChris Lane, “Find Another Bar”\n\nAn Ex-Boyfriend track with anger can be insufferable, but one without it is just kind of sad.\n\nFor a brief moment in the 2010s, it seemed like Lane’s career was about to take off…and then he inexplicably never released an EP or album to capitalize on “Big, Big Plans” and hasn’t really been heard from since (his lone single release since then, 2021’s “Fill Them Boots,” crashed and burned at #41 on Billboard’s airplay chart). He’s returned just in time to close out 2023, but given how tired he sounds here, maybe he should’ve rested for a few more months. The mix here is ripped straight from the late 2010s playbook: An acoustic axe carrying the melody with a repetitive riff, some electric guitars and keyboards left mostly in the background (even the solo sounds like it was recorded fifty feet away from the mic), a synthetic beat that eventually cedes the floor to a drum set, and a steel-guitar-sounding instrument that’s barely gets any screen tie. The resulting atmosphere feels mostly neutral and numb, and the feeling is compounded by a performance from Lane that’s so devoid of emotion that you’d think he’d just had dental surgery and the Novocaine hadn’t worn off yet. He’s still got some decent flow on the rapid-fire portion of the chorus, but said portion is not only jarring and really out of place, but it still doesn’t add any energy or passion to the song, and his monotone delivery just makes the whole exercise feel pointless. The writing is equal parts unfocused and uninteresting: We get a laundry list of the narrator’s ex’s post-breakup achievements to start, the second verse wastes three lines describing a whole different bar before abandoning it all to cast a wide net with “you can go anywhere but right here,” and the chorus is as whiny as every other Ex-Boyfriend track in the world (it reminds me a lot of Priscilla Block’s “My Bar,” but with exactly none of the combativeness). Given a choice between depressed Ex-Boyfriend country like this and the angry junk we generally get…I’d choose to throw the whole blasted trend into the garbage can where it belongs.\n\nRating: 4/10. Next!\n\nHannah Ellis, “Wine Country”\n\nEllis is a Kentucky native who signed with Curb Records all the way back in 2020 and has apparently released a bunch of songs since then, but her radio debut appears to have been “Country Can” from earlier this year (and it only made it to #55 on Billboard’s airplay chart). Her current single is “Wine Country,” and it’s basically the female version of Bro-Country—heck, I’d even go as far as calling it a throwback to early Bro-Country with its unabashed electric guitars, deliberate tempo, token banjo, and mix of real and synthetic percussion. I’ll at least give the producer credit for getting the vibe right on this thing (the instrument tones are bright, and the atmosphere is generally upbeat and energetic), but many of the instruments are buried under echoey effects that muddle the sound a bit too much. I’d describe Ellis’s voice as a mixture of Carly Pearce and Maren Morris, and she handles the technical demands of the song with no problem at all, but her attempt to portray herself as a “country girl” and bring some attitude to the performance feels a bit forced rather than natural. My biggest issue, however, is how the sound and the singer clash with the writing: The narrator here is supposed to a mixture of high-class and backwoods tastes, putting “bougie in the back roads” and drinking “Cabernet in a solo cup” like Scotty McCreery, but with Bro-Country production and Ellis’s attempt to push the country angle, there’s nothing that feels high-class or refined about this song, and it makes Ellis’s narrator sound insincere and only half-believable as a result. On the whole, this is a run-of-the-mill, forgettable track that’s just happy to be here, and I doubt that it will be here long.\n\nRating: 5/10. You’ve seen and heard all this before, and there’s no reason to revisit it.\n\nTyler Childers, “In Your Love”\n\nIf you’re a mainstream, radio-focused consumer like I am, you’ve likely only heard this Kentucky native’s name in passing over the last few years, and may have no idea what his music is all about. Childers, however, has been a darling of the Americana and indie country scenes for quite some time now, and with Music City stuck in a rut for the last few years, he’s finally found an opening to sneak onto the airwaves (…okay, maybe “opening” is a bit generous; the song released back in July and hasn’t even cracked the Top Fifty on Mediabase yet). I was a little nervous about what we would get here, given how mediocre Zach Bryan‘s forays into mainstream country have been, and it turns out that unease was justified, because I swear I just reviewed Parmalee singing this exact song not two hours ago (yes, I’m very slow at writing posts). There’s noticeably less polish here (for example, the piano that does most of the heavy lifting on the melody sounds more like a classic upright model rather than the grand-piano-sounding keyboard on “Gonna Love You”), and the instrument sounds are a weird mix of fuzziness (the piano, the electric guitar) and clarity (the mandolin and synthesizer), causing the former to drown out the latter at times (the mandolin is done especially dirty here, and is barely noticeable until the end of the song). Childers’s voice is a bit thinner than Matt Thomas’s, but it’s got a weathered feel and some actual texture to it, which lends him a bit more credibility: He sounds like he’s seen and done some, er, stuff, and when he says “I will wait for you” and “I will stand my ground,” you believe him. That said, while the writing attempts to be poetic and romantic, it does a pretty poor job telling its story: There are allusions to war and the narrator being “a bad man looking for takers,” but otherwise this is just another guy telling just another lukewarm love story, and honestly, if you stuck Thomas behind the mic here, the song would feel pretty much the same. I really don’t get why independent artists have to tie themselves in knots to fit Nashville’s meta and receive a few radio spins, because there’s a reason people like Childers and Bryan are big deals in the independent scene, and it’s not their Parmalee impressions.\n\nRating: 5/10. There are better ways to spend your time."
