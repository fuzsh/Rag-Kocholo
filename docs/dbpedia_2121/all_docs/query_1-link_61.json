        "text": "Our tale now comes to a close, as the entwined legacies of two halves taper toward a certain infinity. The year is 1984; the place, Manhattan. Two men—closer than brothers yet further from friends—reside on opposite ends of the urban island’s greenway — a landmark of recent consequence for them both.\n\nChronos guides each man with gentle hand, up the broad-sloped hill from which they will soon descend, west toward the setting sun and the hereafter. Each personality has been written in stone, and the bedrock of a life’s work has shaped the quality of his impact to come. May his influence bear testament to his character and success for all future generations.\n\nTo one, the work-obsessed auteur, life has been a mission; to the other, the self-obsessed performer, life has been a stage. Like any of their albums, they’ve written their histories as much together as independently—though the bulk has been shaped by the bard—one song at a time; one breath at a time; like droplets of hot water steadily filling a cold glass.\n\nThe proud performer had drawn inward, becoming a haughty egoist, and self-pleasured. Always his counterpoint, the conscious auteur had grown outward, expanding his musical sound, enduring emotional turbulence, and achieving greatness, though evermore insecure of it.\n\nIn growth, the auteur exposed himself to the world, and the world fed upon him in exchange for confidence. The performer never feared such exposure; he constructed his own world, where he could always be comfortable and confident; where wisdom, prose, and an angels’ choir sustain his aura of recognition and esteem. And out of the great Paul Simon's shadow, he has carved his own niche, and he is happy to die there.\n\nPaul may forever be dissatisfied despite his marble bust standing in the hall of heroes, but Art Garfunkel stands defiant, proudly preferring he be immortalized in a box with his face on it. Any sized vestige of his individuality would be a better tomb than residing in the eternal cultural memory as only one half of Simon…\n\nAnd Garfunkel:\n\nLife in the Shadow of the Bard\n\nNo longer the “Carnal Knowledge” fountain of sexual magnetism, his face was a generation-too-late to be recognizable; his skin had wrinkled and sagged; his hair lost its luster. He looked like a normal guy. On his long walk, Art attributed the lack of interruptive photo ops to his bucket hat and goal-visualization.\n\n“I had a goofy hat on to protect against the sun. I go invisible… If you carry a spirit inside that says, ‘I am Mr Nobody,’ you become Mr Nobody. There are times when I’m in New York when I’m that famous guy, and I carry the attitude — then I get stopped all the time.” “Sometimes,” he said, he’d use his ‘celebrity’ to “get a decent table at a restaurant.”\n\nAt no point in his journey did anybody ask Art Garfunkel why he was skulking around their town. “It just never happened,” however, “I had one incident in Ohio. It was Friday night, and that’s very telling. When the sun goes down on a Friday night, people get a little nutty. There were three guys in a car; they threw a beer can at me; it was three-quarters full and it hit me on the sternum. That was an ouch. I thought I’d broken a bone.”\n\nThe interviewer asked him if it was a redneck’s revenge for “Bright Eyes,” but Art didn’t catch the joke. Instead, he replied, “They didn’t recognize me. They were just assholes being mischievous and drunk. It was an Ohio thing.” Nothing much else happened in the Midwest. By the time he reached Nebraska (about halfway through his journey) he was joined, briefly, by journalist Tom Dunkel for Sports Illustrated. The year was 1990.\n\nHe walks once or twice a year, between April and October, with a map and black pen. “The main thing I'm recording is the topography of the United States—the third dimension; the up and down of everything… I have a memory of every wrinkle in the American landscape now. I really know the East Coast and how the Appalachians began and how they come down ultimately into the Mississippi. It's a sequence of about forty topographical changes,” along the one route he’s traversed. Originally he planned for a precise latitudinal line but, after the Appalachians, he resorted to following state highways. By the time he reached the Rockies, he was tramping the nearly two-hundred-year-old footsteps of Lewis & Clark.\n\nThroughout New Jersey, Art stared at his feet (arguably a better sight than the state) where he had slipped flash cards of Russian phrases into the laces of his sneakers. Beyond the Appalachians, Art would stare at the clouds, imagining shapes within them and wondering what the wind would look like if it were visible. He was ‘Mr. Nobody.’ He was ‘Mr. Question Mark.’ If the rural world was too ambivalent, he would pierce the silence of the Midwestern pastures with Enrico Caruso and Jimmy Webb tunes.\n\n“Herds of cows are mesmerized by me,” he told Tom Dunkel. “I feel like Jesus, walking through a field. I try to do things that read in the cow world. One of them is this,” he said, flapping his arms. “I work them like a politician. If I look sincere, they look very sincere back to me.”\n\nWell before high noon, Tom followed Art Garfunkel to a lone tree on the side of the road, and an idling car. Out from the car stepped Art’s aide, Alan Lipson, carrying a brand new pair of clean, white Reebok sneakers (size nine) for Art to change into. Further up the road, they passed “Arthur Street.” Art smiled; “James Joyce would have loved that. Joyce loved coincidence.”\n\nTom followed Art for the remainder of the afternoon. As the sun started its descent towards the horizon—the distinct separation between farmland and open sky—they encountered Alan Lipson’s rental car idling on the roadside. Art climbed into the passenger seat, reclined, affixed his blindfold, and told his aide to drive. Alan already had their night’s lodging booked: a motel beyond the local Elks lodge.\n\nArt asked for the window to be cracked, and Alan leaned across him to roll it down. Art inhaled the prairie air. After a pause, he announced to the journalist, “it's not France… but it's a nice country.” His spasmodic journey would end in September of ‘97, at the mouth of the Columbia River, and then he’d go on to walk Europe.\n\n“What will the history books want to record?” Art asked himself, with a hostage audience of two. “In grade school readers, you'll have the Dred Scott case and ‘The Walk.’ People will go, ‘What other walk was there?’ ‘Oh, Lewis and Clark!’ ‘Well, that's an exploratory thing. ‘The Walk’ is the famous Garfunkel walk of the Nineteen-Eighties and Nineties.’”\n\nIt was funky, exotic, rhythmic, and soothing. Reminiscent of the R&B he jived to as a boy, the bootleg instrumental washed away his frustrations and filled him with wonder. He found himself scatting along to the cassette for the remainder of the summer, remembering all the Latin and African rhythms that inspired him in his youth. He had forgone them all for contemporary pop—and for that he felt sorry—but his interest in ‘world music’ had now returned, and his timing could not have been better.\n\nIn mid-January, 1985, Paul was one of forty-five artists asked to join in the recording of “We Are the World,” the supergroup single whose proceeds would be donated for humanitarian relief. Singer/activist Harry Belafonte conceived this pop-music fundraiser after hearing about the UK’s ‘Band-Aid’ supergroup and their single “Do They Know It's Christmas?” which strove to finance the feeding of a famished Ethiopia. Belafonte, however, wanted to go bigger: to feed, clothe, and medicate all of the hungry, sick, and struggling communities of third-world Africa.\n\nBelafonte called fundraiser Ken Kragen, who brought two of his clients—Kenny Rogers and Lionel Richie—into the project. Richie called Stevie Wonder and producer Quincy Jones for more “name value.” Jones then called Michael Jackson, who was fresh-off the success of “Thriller,” to help Richie write the song. They took a broad and accessible approach to the “global community/we are but one people” idea.\n\nKragen, Belafonte, Jones, and Wonder (but not so much Wonder) called around their inner circles of musical superstars until they had a shortlist of some forty-five people, including Billy Joel, Cyndi Lauper, Tina Turner, Huey Lewis, Bruce Springsteen, Steve Perry, Hall & Oates, Diana Ross, Dionne Warwick, Willie Nelson, Bob Dylan, Ray Charles, Lindsey Buckingham, Smokey Robinson, The Jackson Five, and Paul Simon.\n\nMichael Jackson and Lionel Richie finished writing “We Are the World” the night before their supergroup was slated to record, on January 21, 1985. On entering the studio, all forty-five pop icons passed under a cardboard sign reading “Please check your egos at the door.” Stevie Wonder met them in the booth. Once everybody was situated on the risers, he made an announcement: if they were unable to record the song in one take, he and Ray Charles would personally drive them all home. (Both Stevie Wonder and Ray Charles are blind.)\n\n“We Are the World” released on March 7, 1985, immediately topping the charts. Its initial shipment of 800,000 sold-out in three days, on to become the most popular record of the year, the first-ever to be certified multi-platinum, and the fastest-selling record of all time. Despite all its popularity, it received largely mixed reviews from critics and consumers alike. One journalist said it sounded like a Pepsi jingle, which wouldn’t have been too hard to fathom, “on the part of Pepsi-contracted songwriters Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie.” Any similarities were “certainly not intentional [yet] certainly beyond the realm of serendipity.” Another critic felt the song was underwritten with a “distasteful element of self-indulgence” as the artists highlighted “their own salvation for singing about an issue they will never experience on behalf of a people most of them will never encounter.”\n\nStill, “We Are the World” was a politically-important milestone in American culture, as it “affected an international focus on Africa that was simply unprecedented.” Stephen Holden of The New York Times noted that “We Are the World” set the standard for ‘popular music’ to address ‘humanitarian concerns,’ as it widened American society’s comfort zone regarding diversity, passively interesting the nation in the idea of African culture influencing their own.\n\nProducer Hilton Rosenthal had grown up in the white suburban half of Johannesburg during the height of apartheid. His parents forbade him from listening to “black music” however, after college, he went to work for the Gramophone Record Co. (South Africa's affiliate of CBS Records) and was soon charged to the “black music” division. He worked against the prejudices of the system to increase the budget, diversity, and publication of traditional Zulu and evolving ethnic music, up into the Eighties.\n\nWhen Warner Bros. investigated the bootleg tape on Paul's behalf, it was Hilton Rosenthal who supplied the answers. Discerning the intent of the inquiry—to record with a mbaqanga band—Hilton said, “Too bad [the tape is] not from Zimbabwe, Zaire, or Nigeria… Life would have been more simple.” Warner Bros. tried to convince Paul to record in New York, with his choice of session musicians, so as to avoid the red tape of working in apartheid South Africa. However, as with his single “Mother and Child Reunion,” Paul declined, insisting “I need to go there” to get the rhythms from the source.\n\nHe later told The New York Times, “The search began when my record company, Warner Bros., put me in touch with Hilton Rosenthal, a leading South African record producer, who identified the group on the tape as the Boyoyo Boys. Hilton also sent me records of around a dozen other South African bands. I was so impressed that I inquired whether it would be possible to record with some of them. I found that I could. And in February 1985, I flew with the recording engineer Roy Halee to Johannesburg.”\n\nPaul had brought Roy Halee back into the fold of his studio career. In fact, Roy was the first person he reached out to about recording an album inspired by “Gumboots: Accordion Jive Volume II.” As Roy recalled to Richard Buskin in 2008, “For me, that project started with Paul telling me, ‘Roy, I've got to play you something that is just great.’ It was the most infectious thing I'd ever heard; as catchy as hell. He said, ‘We have to go over there and record it.’ I said, ‘Where?’ ‘South Africa.’ ‘Okay, great.’”\n\n“Hilton knew everybody in Johannesburg, and so he was able to garner all of these musicians who we'd never previously seen or even heard of. He also booked the recording sessions at Ovation, where they'd mostly been doing South African gospel, and that was a good studio. I remember walking in there and thinking, ‘This is the best-sounding control room I've ever been in.’ … I'd expected a horror show, but everything worked and my first impression was, ‘This is very comfortable.’” It was almost “like you were in your living room… Having said that, the studio itself was like a garage, and in that regard I thought it could be a problem, especially since we were going to record jam sessions from which songs would be created.”\n\nThe ‘horror show’ Roy expected had actually been outside the studio, in the streets, and in the air. The hesitance Warner Bros. expressed before sending Paul Simon to South Africa was owed to the western world’s standing boycott on the country. The South African government, helmed by the descendants of British and Dutch colonialists, were fiercely upholding ‘apartheid’ — a network of institutionalised racism by way of segregation. In Afrikaans, “apartheid” literally means “separateness.”\n\nThe authoritarian white minority, under the ideology of baasskap (‘white supremacy’), ensured the repression the native black populous for over a century, though institutionalised ‘apartheid’ only officially began in 1948, with the election of the National Party. The distinction was the codifying of racial separation, in realms as petty as drinking fountains and cinemas, and as substantial as housing and employment. Segregation was socially and federally enforced, to the point of entire swaths of land being deemed “off-limits” to “coloreds.”\n\nThe British had taken South Africa from the Dutch Empire in the Second Boer War, at the turn of the century, and they retained all of the industrialised systems: the port, the railways, and the racism. In fact, racial segregation worsened under British rule. After their National Party won the election of 1948, they passed the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act, the Immorality Amendment Act (restricting interracial dating), and the Population Registration Act (designating four racial types: ‘Black,’ ‘White’, ‘Colored’, and ‘Indian’) through which they could stratify neighborhoods. However, as the cities grew, these areas had to be expanded.\n\nBetween 1960 and 1983, 3,500,000 non-white natives were expelled from their homes and relocated en masse to ten distant ghettos, under the guise of “returning the natives to their ‘tribal homeland.’” Those who relocated to these “bantustans” were required to surrender their South African citizenship and the few perks that came with it (e.g. plumbing, electricity). Naturally, nobody was enthusiastic about moving to the bantustans, but they didn't have a choice.\n\nThe 1970s saw a rise in resistance to the evictions, segregation, and racism of apartheid, and the South African government responded with gratuitous militant force. Thousands died and countless others were incarcerated, prompting the United Nations to raise an armaments & trade embargo against South Africa. Such global pressures forced the National Party to negotiate with the African National Congress, from 1987 to 1993, resulting in an end to apartheid. — Unfortunately, we are not there yet in our story.\n\nThe year is 1985. Apartheid is at its most violent peak. All Western & European nations have broken their relationships with South Africa, thereby allowing the economy to falter and the racial strife to swell. The native blacks and the white minority are on the brink of a civil war—if not considerably already in one—and Paul Simon chose now, of all times, to visit.\n\nThe majority of the musicians made their way to Johannesburg from the ghetto of Soweto. The caravan included Lulu Masilela, Joseph Shabalala, and members of Stimela, Tau Ea Matsekha, General MD Shirinda & The Gaza Sisters, and Ladysmith Black Mambazo. Paul quickly found syncopation with Tau Ea Matsekha’s Bakithi Kumalo on bass, Stimela’s Isaac Mthsli on drums, and Chikapa “Ray” Phiri (also of Stimela) on lead guitar. As Roy Halee recalled, “the guitarist, Ray Phiri, always had a wealth of stuff going on in his head. He was smart, he could tell what Paul liked, and he would just go into the little catalogue in his mind and come up with something. Of course, he played guitar on everything.”\n\n“Whenever Paul said, ‘What do you have, Ray?’ the response would be, ‘Well, I have this…’ He's a really quiet, unassuming gentleman, and yet he was the catalyst for so much that took place, along with the bass player Bakithi Kumalo. Bakithi is now world famous, but back then he was just a kid from Soweto… He was unbelievable. For me, those sessions were all about the bass. It always seemed so powerful, and whenever Paul and I came back to New York and listened and listened and listened to the material, it was the bass that really turned me on… And you should hear some of the outtakes. Even today, there could be two instrumental albums consisting of those fabulous grooves.”\n\n“As I soon found out, the musicians liked to work very close together, with eye contact to get the feel and the groove going… Nobody wore headphones, aside from the drummer, and even he often didn't wear them… Well, I wasn't about to get into that with these people. They were to come in, play, and feel comfortable, while my job was to get some isolation… In my opinion, the musicians have to be comfortable and able to see each other. The drummer in his own little room with headphones just doesn't make it for me…”\n\n“For my part, I have good ears, and on this album I had a lot of input, but this was [Paul’s] baby. He heard this. I wouldn't have dreamed about going to South Africa…” As if to prove himself a musical genius, Paul Simon had visualised a cohesive album incorporating the styles of pop, rock, zydeco, a cappella, isicathamiya, mbube, and mbaqanga—and he recorded everything at the source, with the largely-unknown mavens of the genres.\n\n“Paul is a master organizer,” Roy told Richard Buskin. “He was great at determining which section would be nice as a bridge or a chorus or an intro while striking up friendships with the group members with whom he could communicate.” “That's how the songs really evolved. Paul has great musical ears, and when it came to sifting through all the material and deciding what to use, where to make edits, and how to shape things into a track, he had a lot of that in his head. He has an incredible mind, and there wasn't anything that he didn't make a mental note of while listening to the musicians play their grooves. Paul Simon is one in a million. Once you work with him, you don't want to work with anybody else.”\n\n“What I was consciously frustrated with,” Paul told Billboard magazine, “was the system of sitting and writing a song and then going into the studio and trying to make a record of that song. And if I couldn’t find the right musicians or I couldn’t find the right way of making those tracks, then I had a good song and a kind of mediocre record.”\n\n“With these musicians, I was doing it the other way around. The tracks preceded the songs. We worked improvisationally. While a group was playing in the studio, I would sing melodies and words — anything that fit the scale they were playing in.” There were no arrangements; there were no songs; there were only the musicians, their instruments, and their inspiration. They played what felt right, in jam sessions, and—after recording hours of tape—Paul and Roy Halee went back to Manhattan, cut the jams into tracks, and Paul wrote lyrics over the music.\n\nThe lyrics came from the tonal patterns of the jam tracks, which meant identifying portions of improvised music that could become verses, choruses, and everything else—almost like making a documentary out of home video footage you found in a box under a park bench. “It was very difficult,” Paul said, “because patterns that seemed as though they should fit together often didn't. I realized that, in African music, the rhythms are always shifting slightly and that the shape of a melody was often dictated by the bassline rather than the guitar. Harmonically, African music consists essentially of three major chords—that's why it sounds so happy—so I could write almost any melody I wanted in a major scale. I improvised in two ways: by making-up melodies in falsetto, and by singing any words that came to mind down in my lower and mid range.”\n\nAs the songs were assembled in parts, the larger theme of the album eluded him. He kept a stack of yellow legal pads in the studio and jotted hundreds of words and phrases that came to mind when listening to playback. One phrase, “driving through wasteland,” morphed into “going to Graceland,” which held some spiritual truth for Paul: traveling to Africa, where mankind laid its first rhythms, and then returning to America, birthplace of rock ‘n’ roll.\n\nHis album was to be a blend of humanity's musical roots and its most recent revolution, amalgamated from the product of musicians surrendering themselves to the moment; to the union; to the harmony. The New York Times called it “the rock album equivalent of a work of literature.” Paul felt similarly, saying, “I think of writing an album as like writing a play. As in a play, the mood should keep changing. A serious song may lead into an abstract song, which may be followed by a humorous song. On ‘Graceland,’ I tried to be more accessible than in the past without giving up the language.”\n\nIt was a word that refused to leave him throughout the processes of cutting and songwriting—GRACELAND—and it became the heart of the album. “It wasn’t about Elvis, but that word wouldn’t go away,” and he's glad it didn't. ‘That word’ took on a greater meaning: “Graceland, to me, is a learning experience of—a uniquely elevated period of my life, musically, politically—of growing up… It’s the grace that I got.”\n\n“The lyrics, in turn, caused a big problem,” Roy confessed. “A lot of the album's songs are very wordy—they come at you like gangbusters—and the arrangements were also involved, but at the same time it was supposed to be a pop record and people had to understand the lyrics. That was tricky, both for Paul to enunciate them and for everyone else to hear them.”\n\n“Capturing Paul's vocals was always very, very tough. Not because of his ability, but because he's a perfectionist… so he would go out and sing the same vocal fifteen times and then I'd comp like crazy. I'd say, ‘Let's do this line over,’ or, ‘This word sounds a little sharp,’ and so he'd re-sing the entire song just so that I could quite literally take that word.”\n\n“The amount of editing that went into that album was unbelievable,” he said, referring to the arduous transference of analog tape to the ‘new’ digital workstation. “Without the facility to edit digital, I don't think we could have done that project.” “We recorded everything analog, so it sounded really good,” but manually editing hours and hours of analog tape would’ve taken ages, so Roy transferred everything to digital, “edited like crazy, put it back on analog, took it to LA to overdub Linda Ronstadt or whoever, brought it back to New York, put it back on digital, and edited some more. We must have done that at least twenty times…”\n\nEditing and re-recording was done in Manhattan, LA, London, and Louisiana, while most of the songwriting was done in solitude at Paul’s beachside home in Montauk, at the far tip of Long Island. There, he played the jam tracks backward as often as he played them forward, searching desperately for patterns. As Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times, “one gets the sense of an artist submitting to, and being swept up by, musical forces he does not totally understand. Adding a crucial extra dimension to the album is Mr. Simon's very urbane literary sensibility… For Mr. Simon, a normally somber composer-lyricist, the merging of the two cultures has yielded music of astounding joy and playfulness and prompted zany, many-layered pop lyrics that embrace the world in all its terror and confusion.”\n\nPierre Boulez was known for being “in revolt against everything” — an atypical description for a composer and conductor of classical music, though an accurate description for a Frenchman. His bullish behavior led to his becoming one of the few paramount classicalists of our ongoing postwar period. In his youth, it was said that “his powerful aggressiveness was a sign of creative passion—a particular blend of intransigence and humor, the way his moods of affection and insolence succeeded one another—all these had drawn us near to him.”\n\nIn the early Seventies, Pierre Boulez had become infatuated with the works of impressionist pianist Maurice Ravel. The eccentricities of impressionism flavored his demeanor for a number of years. In New York, he had the seats torn-out of Avery Fisher Hall so he could perform a “rug concert” for his American fans. One of these concerts was followed by an after-party, hosted in an Upper West Side apartment for the elite members of the audience.\n\nAttendees included Paul Simon and his then-wife Peggy Harper. They both had met Pierre Boulez a number of times—acquaintances, surely—but Pierre never seemed to remember their names. On this night, he again greeted the couple with confidence, believing Paul to be “Al” and his wife “Betty.” This was not the case, but Paul found the situation too humorous to upend. He finished the night as “Al,” and the peculiarity of the party stayed with him for fifteen years.\n\nIn Montauk, circa 1985, Paul recalled the memory and jotted it down on one of his legal yellow pads. Ideas grew around it, born of the midlife crisis he was trudging through, and he wrote: “A man walks down the street / He says why am I soft in the middle now / Why am I soft in the middle / The rest of my life is so hard.”\n\nPaul began with the basic complaints of a man not unlike himself, and as the song goes on—much like a personal crisis—the thoughts become more abstract. “Got a short little span of attention / And woe my nights are so long / Where's my wife and family / What if I die here / Who'll be my role-model / Now that my role-model is / Gone, gone.”\n\n“Because there's been a structure…those abstract images, they will come down and fall into one of the slots that the mind has already made up about the structure of the song.” “He ducked back down the alley / With some roly-poly little bat-faced girl / All along, along / There were incidents and accidents / There were hints and allegations…” And then came the chorus: “If you'll be my bodyguard / I can be your long lost pal / I can call you Betty / And Betty when you call me / You can call me Al.”\n\nThe studio’s synth player, Rob Mounsey, arranged a brief brass section that Roy Halee went to town with. “It was my idea,” he recalled. “However, it was Rob who wrote it down for the horns. It was his arrangement, and the groove that's going on in that song is Rob's groove. He played the groove in the verses, as well as the synth lines at the beginning and throughout the number, and it was that groove which turned the song into a monster, although the brass contributed quite a lot, too.”\n\nRiding under the four trumpets and two trombones was a bass run by Bakithi Kumalo. Roy fed this line backwards, for the sake of experimentation, in the second half of the song. “I simply copied the line as originally played to a mono machine and then synced it backwards into the multitrack. That kind of thing was always happening… Anything to make it sound more interesting.” Morris Goldberg capped the tune off with a penny whistle solo.\n\nThe music video intended to be released for “You Can Call Me Al” was a performance Paul gave while hosting “Saturday Night Live,” but he didn’t like it. Thankfully, Lorne Michaels had a better idea: in a small room, Paul Simon would lip-sync the song, and his good friend Chevy Chase would try his best to steal the spotlight. Chevy, at the time, was at the peak of his celebrity (though “National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation” was still three years away). The whimsical simplicity of the video earned it a heavy rotation on VH1.\n\nReleased on September 5, 1986, “You Can Call Me Al” was the first single to introduce Paul Simon’s “Graceland” to the world. Its infectious, rooted rhythms shot it to #23 on the Hot 100, charting for twenty-nine straight weeks. Much of the MTV generation was introduced to Paul Simon by way of this song, featuring a goofy Chevy Chase mugging for the camera, and I challenge anyone old enough to remember music videos on television to keep from echoing these rhythms with non-lexical vocables. “Daa na na na! Daa na na na-na!”\n\nWhen Paul played Central Park again, in 1991, Chevy Chase made a surprise appearance during the break to join Paul in their famous ‘horn dance.’ That same year, Tennessean Senator Al Gore used “You Can Call Me Al” as his campaign song in seeking the Vice Presidential nomination from Bill Clinton. Gore went on to use “You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet” by Bachman-Turner Overdrive for his 2000 Presidential race, thereby institutionalizing the unsettling trend of every aspiring executive officer using a once-Top 40 pop song as a means of seeming relatable. Later selections included Van Halen, Bruce Springsteen, John Lennon, LeAnn Rimes, U2, CCR, the Rolling Stones, John Cougar Mellencamp, Boston, Celine Dion, Tom Petty, ABBA, Kid Rock, and Katy Perry. Paul Simon was one of the earliest and most recent contributors to this trend, lending “Bridge over Troubled Water” to George McGovern in ‘72 and “America” to Bernie Sanders in ‘16.\n\nOnce “Graceland” was finished in the mixing lab, Paul and Roy brought it to the executives at Warner Bros. They gave it a listen and returned with pockets full of doubt; not so much cynical but skeptical that an eclectic, African-inspired album like “Graceland” could be appealing. “Paul had tremendous faith in the record,” Roy recalled, “although I had my doubts, because it had been such a lengthy, difficult project, and the music was so different to what was on the charts. Those bass grooves just weren't happening at that time.”\n\n“Just listen to ‘The Boy in the Bubble,’” the third single. “For me, the bass line and the feel of that tune is what the album is all about. It's the essence of everything that happened. The guitar, the drums, and that incredible bass add-up to a feel going-on at the bottom end that is unlike anything I've heard before or since. It's a major part of why the record was huge.” Masked by a jovial, accordion-led melody, “The Boy in the Bubble” muses on famine and terrorism—a daily occurance in most of the world—though the elite of western cultures are [by choice] largely oblivious. Paul said the lyrics were meant to blend “hope and dread,” adding, “That's the way I see the world: a balance between the two, but coming down on the side of hope.”\n\nBeginning with “You Can Call Me Al,” each of the singles from Paul Simon’s seventh studio album increase in African affectation, ultimately turning 1987 into a milestone year; a year where postwar American society finally shifted away from majority conservatism to majority progressivism, opening the hearts and minds of millions to the idea that racial minorities are as cultured, capable, and compassionate as the average suburbanite.\n\nIn the fourth single, “Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes,” a girl whose wealth affords her immeasurable freedoms and ease is contrasted with a boy whose poverty she cannot fathom. Featured singer Linda Ronstadt lends her earliest memory to the second verse of the fifth and final single, “Under African Skies,” while Joseph Shabalala of Ladysmith Black Mambazo lends his to the opening and closing verse. The somber chorus asks us to reflect on who we are: “This is the story of how we begin to remember / This is the powerful pulsing of love in the vein / After the dream of falling and calling your name out / These are the roots of rhythm and the roots of rhythm remain.” As Jeff Heller wrote, “The root of all rhythm—where our musicality as humans began—is from our heartbeat. That rhythm remains in songs to this day.”\n\n“Graceland,” the second single and title track, features The Everly Brothers on backing vocals (a dream-come-true for Paul Simon) singing of the misery and misfortune that plagues the protagonist’s mind as he drives south to find serenity. Spurred by his crumbling relationship with Carrie Fisher—which she confirmed as the inspiration—Paul wrote, “She comes back to tell me she's gone / As if I didn't know that / As if I didn't know my own bed / As if I'd never noticed / The way she brushed her hair from her forehead / And she said losing love / Is like a window in your heart / Everybody sees you're blown apart / Everybody sees the wind blow.”\n\nCarrie Fisher said in her autobiography, “If you can get Paul Simon to write a song about you, do it, because he is so brilliant at it.” In a modern confessional, Claire Goldberg wrote of “Graceland” being “unapologetically happy—and yet it’s tinged with so much sadness… And it’s sad—there’s no doubt about it—but it’s so happy at the same time. It’s hopeful. ‘Graceland’ itself is a biblical place; a destination from a long journey, and somewhere where all his troubles will be absolved. It’s just one of the many songs on the album that is impossibly beautiful and filled with so many emotions that you can’t ever pick just one.”\n\n“Graceland was never just a collection of songs, after all,” wrote Andrew Leahey of American Songwriter. “It was a bridge between cultures, genres, and continents, not to mention a global launching pad for the musicians whose popularity been suppressed under South Africa's white-run apartheid rule.” Paul was “ahead of his time,” and though later groups would receive flak for too-closely taking inspiration from “Graceland,” Paul tended to defend the artists; in one instance, he said, “In a way, we were on the same pursuit… I don't think you're lifting from me, and—anyway—you're welcome to it, because everybody's lifting all the time. That's the way music grows and is shaped.”\n\nAs Ethan Zuckerman once wrote, “Collaborations like ‘Graceland’ don’t happen without the participation of two important types of people: xenophiles and bridge figures. Xenophiles, lovers of the unfamiliar, are people who find inspiration and creative energy in the vast diversity of the world.” Xenophiles, like Paul Simon, “move beyond an initial fascination with a cultural artifact to make lasting and meaningful connections with the people who produced the artifact.” And then there are “bridge figures [who] straddle the borders between cultures, figuratively keeping one foot in each world. Hilton Rosenthal was able to broker a working relationship between a white American songwriter and dozens of black South African musicians during some of the most violent and tense moments of the struggle against apartheid. As a bridge, Rosenthal was an interpreter between cultures and an individual both groups could trust and identify with…”\n\nIn 2012, Rolling Stone named “Graceland” the 71st Greatest Album of All Time, calling it “an album about isolation and redemption that transcended ‘world music’ to become the whole world's soundtrack.” According to Paul, “What was unusual about ‘Graceland’ is that it was on the surface apolitical, but what it represented was the essence of the anti-apartheid in that it was a collaboration between blacks and whites to make music that people everywhere enjoyed. It was completely the opposite from what the apartheid regime said, which is that one group of people were inferior. Here, there were no inferiors or superiors; just an acknowledgement of everybody's work as a musician. It was a powerful statement.”\n\nAmong the affected were young, white suburbanites, on to become more open-minded than their predecessors. Claire Goldberg was one such young American: “The first Paul Simon album I listened to was ‘Graceland,’ of course. I had heard the classics before, including ‘The Sound of Silence’ from his Simon & Garfunkel days… but ‘Graceland’ was the first piece of Paul Simon that started to mean something to me… That album reminds me of so many things; of all the road trips I’ve ever taken, of my parents, of home, and—strangely enough—it reminds me of somewhere I’ve never even been before. With the African melodies that Simon infuses in his Americana music, it reminds me of places far away and of every corner of this country that I call home…”\n\nWhile Paul was in South Africa, rejecting apartheid and blowing the roof off of pop music conventions, Art Garfunkel was in Nebraska, walking. He was comfortable—for the moment—with his anonymity, which he pretended was by choice. He had not spoken to his old friend in more than two years; Paul had since been clambering to get back on top, and Art was taking it easy. All he had done since the Concert in Central Park was walk west — that, of course, and the movie “Good to Go.”\n\nReleased three weeks before “Graceland,” “Good to Go” showcased Art Garfunkel as beat journalist S.D. Blass, rummaging around Washington DC for ‘the next big story.’ After hearing about a nurse that was recently raped and murdered, he dives ass-first into the underground go-go music scene, eventually publishing the article “Nurse Murdered at Go-Go: Music and Drugs Blamed for Violence,” and then the movie spends the majority of its runtime in back alleys and go-go dance halls.\n\n“Good to Go” was an attempt by the DC-area’s go-go music scene producers to make go-go music into a big deal. I don’t need to ask if you know how that turned out because I know you know it didn’t. Go-go impresario Maxx Kidd and three other go-go producers poured $1,500,000 into a script written by a guy with suboptimal credentials: co-writer of a “madcap caper” about “a team of detectives who are following, and are being followed by, a group of beautiful women;” co-writer and star in a cliché 1980s Hollywood story comparable to films about sexual androids, your weird uncle’s nightclub, Helen Mirren’s “Hussy,” prostitute hijinks, sailor hijinks, and something called “Slayground” with the tagline “Welcome to your funeral;” and then a minor role as “Capt. Braverman” in the sophomoric 1984 raunch comedy “Up the Creek.”\n\nCritic Lars Skogan summarized “Up the Creek” as the story of “four losers” (“Bob the slacker, Irwin the alcoholic geek, Gonzer the human food disposal, and Max the ne'er-do-well”) who are “forced and bribed to represent their university in an intercollegiate raft race,” with foes including “a whole team of marines, and preppy Ivy-leaguers determined to win.” “Up the Creek” was written by the guy who went on to pen 1998’s “Rush Hour” and 2004’s “National Treasure,” which I must admit is one of my favorite movies.\n\nThe early Eighties were a different time, evidently, and Americans had demanded more “Animal House” than “Anchorman,” with comedic lines such as Gonzer’s “I risked my life, and you give me Light Beer?” The writer put the onus of the film’s disappointing performance on the director, saying he “was not a great comedy director; he missed a lot of jokes,” but methinks the writer did, too. In her review for the Washington Post, Rita Kempley called it “a moist smut movie,” “headed for the whitewater vapids,” adding, “The only thing good about this movie is Chuck, played by Jake the Wonder Dog—a talented and charismatic Spaniel with a lovely shaggy mane and a divine bark. Chuck has all the best scenes. Still, that brave little pooch is ‘Up the Creek’ without a dog paddle. UP THE CREEK — At area theaters, in English and Spaniel.”\n\nThe leader of the “whole team of marines,” Capt. Braverman, was portrayed by Blaine Novak, the Garfunkelish cross between Ted Danson and a garden gnome. His signature line, “A commander couldn’t ask for better soldiers,” is immediately followed in the trailer by a shot that would hilariously argue otherwise! One reviewer, in 2001, wrote, “Is this flick good? Jesus, no. Is this flick funny? Somehow, yes… ‘Up the Creek’ has not aged well (what a shocker) but it's a perfect example of the pointless, disposable comedies they made in the early- to mid-Eighties… Every scene, every joke, every character here is dumb—and thank God… I think ‘Up The Creek’ was made specifically FOR drunk people (and possibly BY drunk people) but that's okay; it's all good. I mean, the film's not good, but then again, it is. Ah, forget it. Just grab a case, a beer bong, and watch the damn thing.”\n\nAfter losing the camo fatigues, Blaine Novak went home and fulfilled a contract with go-go impresario Maxx Kidd, penning “Good to Go,” a real “snoozer” of a film. “The cover made it look like a decent action flick,” wrote one reviewer. “However, it moves at a snail's pace and had no intelligible plot whatsoever. I feel it was a showcase for the ‘go-go’ music contained within and nothing else.” One of IMDb’s most prolific reviewers agreed, saying that, although the first 75 minutes are “slow moving at first,” the plot “really picks up in the last fifteen minutes” as Art Garfunkel’s S.D. Blass evades “the murderous Harrigan, who's trying to prevent him from telling the truth about his cold-blooded murder of Tony.” Blass is simultaneously “trying to prevent a major race-riot from erupting in the streets of DC” and so he mounts the stage of a televised go-go concert, “telling the millions of viewers the truth,” thereby “vindicating himself…to the wild cheers of thousands of go-go music fans…”\n\nThough most of the $1,500,000 budget came from Maxx Kidd’s own pocket, a portion of the budget was provided through an advertising deal with Pepsi. There’s so much product placement that “It's practically a ninety-minute commercial for Pepsi,” which is odd considering all the “drug-fuelled rape and murder.” The headline for the film’s only somewhat-complimenting review read “Witness Art put the ‘funk’ in ‘Garfunkel’ and watch this oddity today!” Even with his enthusiasm for the singer, the reviewer could not fathom why they chose “noted badass Art Garfunkel” for the lead role, given that Art has the charisma of “a wet noodle.”\n\nTo the chagrin of Maxx Kidd, “Good to Go” did not make back its budget. Its failure roots to the bones of the film: conceived to popularise a musical subgenre rather than to tell a story. This was evident in its trailer, which devotes over eighty percent of its runtime to footage of the band Trouble Funk playing the theme song, and a crowd of people dancing. A pulsating red X overlaid by the film’s title took another five percent, leaving the rest of the trailer to hurl shots of chases, car crashes, and fire, with a single half-second shot of Art Garfunkel’s protagonist turning to run—and, for the unfamiliar, you’d have never recognized him in the dark, nor would his appearance have made any sense, considering how no part of the trailer indicated a narrative of any sort. The trailer said more about the film than the film, as it was a film made for the music — and when you make a film not for the sake of a film, you fail to make a film, and thus your film will fail to make money.\n\nMaxx Kidd had been the shepherd of go-go music ever since funk guitarist Chuck Brown birthed the subgenre in the mid-Seventies. It developed a unique regional style in the afro-urban Washington DC area, blending funk riffs, R&B bass, and early hip-hop beats into a riotous “sultry stank.” The key component, however, was the standard dancehall requirement of call-and-response with a live audience, which popularised the go-go subgenre among the nightclub scene. By the mid-Eighties, wrote Natalie Hopkinson, “the music’s relationship to Washington DC was roughly analogous to hip-hop’s relationship with the Bronx.”\n\nAs one of America’s most inquisitive cultural scholars, Hopkinson mused, “the question I’m most commonly asked is, Why did go-go stay in DC?” Well, the record label behind Bob Marley’s rise to power had produced a film in 1972, “The Harder They Come,” to boost the reputation of reggae music—and it worked. Maxx Kidd tried to do the same with go-go music, signing the same label executive from “The Harder They Come” to help produce “Good to Go.” That executive was Chris Blackwell, “a white, Jamaican-born, UK-educated music aficionado.”\n\nBlackwell never felt comfortable in black crowds. For the shoot, he arrived in Washington DC with a fleet of bodyguards. Halfway through filming the movie, he fired director Don Letts—a black man—and allowed the writer—the snow-white Blaine Novak—to finish the film. Novak had never directed before, especially on such a large production, and he had no understanding of black culture or the afro-urban Washington DC area. The script he wrote was based on stereotypes, newspaper headlines, and common misconceptions. For a film about a black-helmed subgenre of music in a black community, meant for a black audience, there was a surprising and utter lack of consideration for authentically portraying black culture.\n\nOn of the film’s co-producers said of the go-go music scene, during filming, “We heard it’s a bunch of kids stoned on PCP dancing around… When the music stops, fights break out. If you’re white, you don’t go into these scenes because you’re in an incredibly dangerous situation.” Though Maxx Kidd had put his hopes in his team, Chris Blackwell and Blaine Novak could only muster an aura of “racist paternalism,” whether subconsciously or not, which only stood to enrage an already-disrespected afro-urban Washington DC.\n\nKip Lornell and Charles Stephenson Jr., authors of “The Beat: Go-Go Music,” wrote of the producers vying to conjure “a highly volatile mixture of street violence and niggers crazy on drugs, all highlighted by the blackest music outside of Lagos, Nigeria… It was beginning to look like the ‘70s, when blaxploitation films like ‘Shaft’ and ‘Cotton Comes to Harlem’ were commonplace. If only [Blackwell] had aimed so high!”\n\nMeanwhile Don Letts suggested that “go-go did not translate well into film” since “there is something about it that is intangible. It is almost too hot for vinyl and definitely too hot for celluloid.” “Go-go was the ultimate black tribal rebel sound in Washington, home of the White House and the capital of America. People tried to demonize the whole scene, [but] the bottom line is: you don’t know the complete story of contemporary black music if you don’t know go-go.”\n\nThe soundtrack for “Good to Go” launched the same day as the film, in August 1986, with thirteen songs from local go-go bands. The lead track, “Good to Go,” was supplied by Trouble Funk, who had helped raise and foster the go-go scene. Their first studio record, 1982’s “Drop the Bomb,” was highly praised by critics—among them, Robert Christgau and Rolling Stone. The record produced one titular and two booming singles—“Pump Me Up,” “Drop the Bomb,” “Hey Fellas”—on to quickly become go-to samples for hip-hop’s earliest deejays. First scratched and cut by the likes of Public Enemy (“Fight The Power”) and M.A.R.R.S. (“Pump Up The Volume”), Trouble Funk’s go-go influence continues to bare descendants, as in Joe Budden’s 2003 hip-hop hit “Pump It Up.”\n\nGo-go music never went national, though it still thrives in Washington DC. “Good to Go” made no waves, and Maxx Kidd pulled it from theaters shortly after its release. It was repackaged as “Short Fuse” and released again on VHS, though the film is no longer in print. The father of go-go died in 2017, in his suburban-DC home, at the age of 75.\n\n“In ‘83, my friend Jimmy Webb showed me a piece he was writing—a cantata for a children's choir and small orchestra for his local church in Tuxedo, New York—and, it being a noncommercial endeavor, I was particularly interested in it,” Art wrote, in his first poetry collection, “Still Water,” “because I had become cynical about the fact that the record business will professionalize one's musical attempts in a way that can hurt them. And I followed Jimmy's rehearsals in Tuxedo and…I told him I wanted to get involved. By the next year, he had written an extension, doubled its length, and wrote various sections for me as solo singer, narrator, and the angel Gabriel.”\n\n“Good to Go” didn't do Art any favors; its failure boxed him out of any chance at another big Hollywood film. (Being B-listed is one thing; being in a B-list bomb is another.) So Art returned to music, setting his sights on redemption.\n\n“We all performed [Webb's cantata] with orchestra; children's choir—boy singer, girl singer—at St. John the Divine Cathedral in New York… We made a live recording of the shows, which later seemed to me too loose, so we planned to record it in the studio…”\n\nArt wanted Roy Halee to come in and oversee the production of this Christmas album, but Roy was still knee-deep in “Graceland,” hashing tracks with Paul Simon. Art waited, and waited, all the while blaming Paul for holding their shared engineer hostage.\n\nAggravation bloomed into anger. The clock was ticking, and Art didn't want to delay his album any further. With Christmastime arguably being the best time to release, he moved-on without Roy, deciding he and Jimmy Webb would manage the recording themselves.\n\n“I had it finished by Christmas of ‘86, which I gather is when it came out. It's a gothic cathedral of an album; it's very ambitious. It was the type of project that would have been done by papal commission long ago.”\n\nIt was a retelling of the Nativity story—the birth of Jesus Christ—from the perspectives of animals. Art portrayed the angel Gabriel and Amy Grant played the Virgin Mary, performing in the operatic ‘recitative’ form, also known as “Sprechgesang” or “sing-talking.” Listening to all forty minutes of “The Animals’ Christmas” is like boarding a soft-top airplane and gliding at highway speeds through clouds of ennui—listless boredom and emptiness—while someone plays a saxophone from inside a baby grand piano. (Sometimes research is not fun.)\n\nColumbia released “The Animals’ Christmas” on the last day of the year, 1985. It received one critical review: nine out of ten stars from AllMusic’s Joe Viglione. He described it as “one of the best Christmas albums of the Eighties,” calling it “good brain-food for grownups and children alike.” “On the upside for consumers,” he wrote, “none of these tunes are familiar ‘Christmas classics’ hammered into the consciousness during the holidays. The church-like feel of the project keeps [its songs] from being able to break-out on seasonal radio next to tracks from Phil Spector's Christmas Album, Brenda Lee, Bing Crosby, and the other perennials who show up on the airwaves around Thanksgiving time and beyond,” which is nearly the most un-American thing I’ve ever heard. (Somebody dig-up Joe McCarthy; he’ll have a ball.)\n\nArt spent the warm months of 1986 walking. In September, his father died—Jack, the former traveling salesman—and he sank once again into depression.\n\nPaul was on top of the world. He was 45 years old—or, like a hot mommy would say, 45 years young—and had just won the two most sought-after Grammy Awards, back-to-back. His subsequent “Graceland Tour” was selling-out across the country, in magnitudes he hadn't seen since he was shackled to Art Garfunkel.\n\n“Once you go away for a bit,” he said, “you wonder who people think you are. If they don't know what you're up to, they just go by your history. I'm so often described as this person that went to other cultures—which is true—but I never thought of it that way… I wondered, ‘Is this an appropriate context to express various thoughts, given the way people listen now and the way music is exposed to the world?’ Pop music, as it's constantly evolving, is completely different from the value system and aesthetic I grew up with and contributed to.”\n\nHalf of his concerts were videotaped, to be released as music videos, and album sales remained steady even two years after release. Commercial success filled his pockets, and cultural celebrity filled his heart, but both paled in comparison to the respect and adoration of thousands of grateful fans, singing along between the low edge of the stage and the back row of the balconies.\n\n“Finishing a song is more satisfying now because I'm grateful, whereas when I was twenty-eight, I expected it. Now if I find something to say, and I say it in a way that I think is artful and true, I'm relieved I wasn't frustrated or stymied. When I was younger, I just said whatever I had to say. I ask myself now: Do I deeply believe that? Will anybody get it? Am I just talking to myself? You have to put that aside because it's not very helpful.”\n\n“I'm trying to be as honest as I can, expressing myself musically and lyrically—editing-out what might be considered obscure, but not trying to oversimplify or be condescending—and then I have to let go, even if I don't immediately understand the words. What I meant eventually reveals itself. You can be too familiar with the process, which I've been doing since I was fifteen. Sometimes, instead of manipulating the craft, you have to just be the vessel through which some sort of inspiration will flow.”\n\nIn 2007, “Graceland” became the second of his works to be selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry, due to its being “culturally, historically, or aesthetically important.”\n\nUpon receiving his medical license, in 1971, Irwin Redlener moved to Arkansas to practice pediatrics. There, he met his wife, Karen. In the early morning of February 4, 1976, a 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck Guatemala, leveling half of its capital city. Poorly-built concrete and adobe homes collapsed across the country, and in neighboring Honduras, crushing and killing over 23,000 people while leaving an additional one million without homes.\n\nThe US Air Force responded with shipments of medical supplies and food. Hundreds of doctors flew to Guatemala, where hospitals were overflowing with casualties; the city itself had become a trauma ward. The US military erected field hospitals nearby, to be serviced by America’s volunteer doctors. Among them was Dr. Irwin Redlener, stationed in a rural village between two jungle-encrusted mountains. His focus was on the children, for whom he treated infections, reset bones, stitched wounds, and at one point was held at gunpoint by a frustrated teen.\n\nAfter a few weeks of pro bono aid, Dr. Redlener returned to America and opened a Child Action Center, to counsel and heal abused children. He became a member of the Physicians for Social Responsibility and, in 1985, he joined the board of ‘USA for Africa’ as its director of medicine and grants. There, he met Paul Simon, during the recording of “We Are the World,” and the two quickly bonded over their shared heritage: Redlener, a native of Brooklyn, and Paul, a boy from Queens. The latter suggested they collaborate in an effort to remedy homelessness in their city.\n\nThe two toured shelters and welfare hotels across Manhattan and Long Island. “We were speechless,” said Redlener, recalling a particular tenement at 32nd and Broadway, “it was a horrible, squalid old building, absolutely teeming with poor children and their families… There were kids and moms everywhere.” “They would have a hot plate—no stoves; a bath that was used to wash clothes.” “It was a hellhole. We both had the same feeling: Where the hell am I?”\n\nThis scene burned itself into their hearts, forging within them an indefatigable resolve to combat the sordid, sorry slums of their hometown. “There was something—I don't know how to describe it other than absolutely compelling and romantic—about this vision of somebody going to a place, obviously in need, and practicing what they had learned to do.”\n\nIn 1987, the unlikely pair founded the Children's Health Fund — a nonprofit organization of mobile medical clinics designated to provide healthcare for the homeless and impoverished children of New York City. The CHF began with a single refurbished van, designed by Redlener's wife, Karen, and paid for by Paul Simon. “We have basically taken the entire pediatric office and put it on wheels, so we can take it with us,” said Redlener, beaming. “It's like a highly-mechanized, highly-developed house call.”\n\nToday, the CHF services cities across the country with twenty-three programs and over fifty mobile medical clinics. The nonprofit is the leading provider of ambulatory healthcare provision for the homeless and impoverished children of America. “All the medical records of the kids we're seeing are on the computer,” Redlener explained, “so if they move from one shelter to another shelter, we're able to track them and we have their immunization records, what chronic illnesses they have, what medications they're on, and so forth. It's a critical part of the type of health care we think it's important for kids to get.”\n\nThe volunteer doctors and nurses of CHF are versed in all forms of pediatrics, including health education, nutrition, preventative care, oral care, mental health, disease management, and emergency response. Their iconic “big blue busses” have contributed to the relief efforts of Hurricanes Andrew and Katrina, the BP Oil Spill, and the 9/11 terror attacks. In 2003, Dr. Redlener became the head of Columbia University’s National Center for Disaster Preparedness, which aims to predict and protect areas of the country whose populations—particularly regarding children—likely stand on the threshold of a major disaster.\n\nThe focus of CHF remains on the impoverished. “When we started the program in 1987, there were on average thirteen-thousand children in the homeless shelter system on any given day. Now there are almost eighteen-thousand, so the problem is actually worse than it was, but you don't see it on the front pages anymore. People are tired of it,” Redlener explained, “They think it's resolved or they're moved on to the next issue du jour, and that really is a problem.”\n\n“What has driven me for more than four decades as a pediatrician and advocate has been addressing challenges that can’t wait and where the stakes are high.” “There are specific, age-related windows of development that are time-sensitive. Missing critical health interventions, not getting a proper educational foundation, or experiencing persistent trauma at critical stages may have lifelong, irreversible consequences.”\n\nIn over three decades of operation, the Children’s Health Fund has provided medical care to more than three million homeless and impoverished children. Paul Simon has addressed Congress numerous times on behalf of his foundation, and—on his own accord—he’s raised millions of dollars for various childcare and medical foundations, generally though a series of charity concerts and partnered benefits. Even with his age in the high seventies, Paul continues to devote himself to securing support for the Children’s Health Fund and others like it.\n\nAs Dr. Redlener once said, “My life and work are based on a simple message: Kids can’t wait.”\n\n(Click here to donate to the Children’s Health Fund.)\n\n“By the 1980s,” Art wrote, “I had sung solo on records that did well; I sustained the very painful loss of a beautiful girl; I did the Concert in Central Park with Paul in ‘81, then toured the world…” Then, in 1983, “on a BMW motorcycle, in the mountain passes of Switzerland, I began to write.” (He writes about himself writing nearly as often as he writes about his life.)\n\n“I'm in a turret of an old hotel in Scarborough,” he harped, “a window view out on the end of the strand. It's neap tide. I'm Noah. Christmastime is here; the Fair is in the past.” Literary musings such as these lay half the track of his prideful non-memoir, “What Is It All but Luminous: Notes from an Underground Man.” “Since Laurie died, I live in my own rarefied air. I put the ‘e’ in ‘artist’ every day. Monteverdi, Proust, Kubrick, I sit reclusive in the park, at the sailboat pond, near Hans Christian Andersen, and write.”\n\n“I let the notebook run—December 29, 1983. Les Arcs, ski village, France. Ineluctable modality…a rower's heart, a simple water-drinking bard. [J] is Stephen Dedalus and I am Leo Bloom—his twenty-two, red and yellow ready; my forty-two and rather ‘at sea.’”\n\nIf you’re like me, you don’t know what he was talking about, but that’s okay, because he doesn’t want you to know; he wants himself to know. However, I still wanted to know, so I dissected it: The two main characters of James Joyce’s “Ulysses” are Leopold Bloom and Stephen Dedalus. The former, a middle-aged advertiser, estranged from his wife, who enjoys literature, music, and “explaining his knowledge to others.” The latter, a well-read, intelligent twentysomething with dreams of being a poet, though he is more cerebral than emotional.\n\n“Ineluctable modality” is an “irresistible existence,” as the general term ‘modality’ refers to the manner of something’s nature, or as the musical term ‘modality’ refers to the mood imparted by a singer’s voice. A “rower’s heart” is strong, healthy, virile, and forged in intense training regimens. A “water-drinking bard” is a purist and poet; “red and yellow ready” denotes passion, happiness, enthusiasm, and energy; and “at sea,” of course, means confused, or gone astray.\n\nIs poetry supposed to be dissected? No, but when Art devotes a page of his non-memoir to a cryptic male romance during the least-documented period of his life, it warrants an investigation. “I let the notebook run—December 29, 1983. Les Arcs, ski village, France. [Irresistible mood]… a [strong, virile body], a simple [and pure poet];” [J] is twenty years his junior, well-read, and full of passionate energy; Art is well-aged and out of his comfort zone. It was a thrill.\n\n“Having read six hundred pages of ‘Ulysses,’ the heroes have begun to intertwine.” “He is the young marquis, he's early O'Toole, rich in frailty, he is beautiful. He tells me he'll pull me back in the world. I think of James Fox in ‘The Servant,’” the film adaptation of a 1948 novella by Robin Maugham, the first-born of an English nobleman. Maugham wrote the novella in the aftermath of World War II, from which he was speedily discharged on account of “a state of exhaustion.”\n\nMaugham had described himself as “defiantly homosexual” which shows subtly within “The Servant:” Tony (later portrayed by James Fox) is a wealthy Londoner who hires a manservant named Hugo. The manservant loves his job and the two form a close bond. Tony’s girlfriend gets jealous of Hugo. Over the course of the book, Hugo plies his charm and gets Tony hooked on his phonics. By the end of the book, Tony has exiled his girlfriend and is completely dependant on Hugo; meaning, the “master” and the “servant” have exchanged roles.\n\n“[J] has taken over, I cater to his day. The American European. A writer's holiday.” The O’Toole in question is British actor Peter O’Toole who, in his early years, was a statuesque example of the chiseled male form, with a sturdy jawline, warm blue eyes, tousled blonde hair, and strong bones. As the ‘heroes’ of “Ulysses” intertwine, is it emotional, physical, or both?\n\n“Tomorrow we leave on the Grande Vitesse,” France's high-speed intercity train network. The Les Arcs ski resort is more Swiss or Italian than it is French; they took the link from Lyon to the City of Lights. “Paris 51 Hotel le Colbert, room 22. January 10. The buttresses of Notre Dame are flying out my window,” an architecture joke. “[J] has been ill. His father is cutting him off… Next day he goes to class, Sorbonne 171, economics post-university level. He is being bounced. I get caught for shoplifting underwear at Prix Unique.”\n\nThis “J” character seems, then, to be a college student he’d met at the ski resort; perhaps an entitled twentysomething, given his dependence on his father’s pocketbook and his fascination with James Joyce literature. Their Lolitaesque romance takes them away from Paris and northeast, beyond Belgium and toward Germany. “We had a car accident in Luxembourg. Last night he had a 40° fever (speck of dust). I bought him medicine. I brought him dinner. He glistened with sweat through the night—his bed all junked-up and cokey.”\n\n“So he asks me to clean his syringe for him while the medicine goes to his head; ‘Do you still have the Blistex we came with? Put it on me,’ he said. I light the Ducal cigarettes that pass between our silhouettes.” “A flock of birds was passing in the sky. They flew in two societies. I marked the leader's wings in no one's wake. Behind them, two cavorting stragglers fly. I am with them wond'ring—why don't these two lovers take the route the others take? Two lovers—or two wand'ring innocents? In voluntary nonparticipance, for joie de vol, for each the other's sake.”\n\nThe group flies on but two linger behind, seemingly for the company of one another. He believes them lovers. In reality, these two geese had been breaking-in the airflow that “provides the additional lift for all of the geese who follow behind,” until they got tired and rotated to the back, where the air was looser. They were more leaders than lovers, but that’s worth noting: Art perceived them as lovers, lingering behind for “the joy of flight;” wondering, “why don't these two lovers take the route the others take?”\n\n“What Is It All but Luminous: Notes from an Underground Man” does not elucidate any further on the episode of “J,” and neither does Art. Aside from this page in his non-memoir, he has never acknowledged the Winter of ‘83/84 or the identity of “J.” When or how it fizzled-out, I don’t know, but in the autumn of ‘85—while shooting “Good to Go” in Los Angeles—his friend showed him a picture of a girl from the Twin Cities. “Love slipped in on me. It wasn't the thing I thought I was looking for, but it felt so good. This was something else again.”\n\nShe was Kathryn (Kim) Cermak, a former model, sixteen years his junior. She had once been a teenybopper who fawned over the “handsome sex symbol, Art Garfunkel,” during his S&G days, and that youthful desire lived-on within her. Of their age difference, Art said, “It doesn’t seem to bother us at all and, actually, I love that she’s younger than me. There’s a nice amount of differentness between us: I’m urban and she’s Midwest; I’m much more cerebral and she’s way sweeter than I am, and free of a lot of my thorniness. We slip together pretty naturally.”\n\nThey were wed on September 18, 1988, at the Brooklyn Botanic Gardens.\n\nThough Paul and Edie didn’t tend to collaborate musically, the two singer-songwriters did produce together three children—Adrian, Lulu, and Gabriel—and Edie treated Paul's son Harper (the byproduct of his former marriage to Peggy Harper) as if he were her own — however, Harper could very-well take care of himself, given he's only six years younger than her.\n\nHarper has spent his life thus far trying to reproduce the success of his father, in becoming an acclaimed folk-rock singer-songwriter. He performs under his father’s surname yet simultaneously scorns references to him as ‘the son of a rockstar’ rather than ‘a rockstar of his own right.’ However, as Harper told Mark Binelli in April of 2005, he “warms to the subject of being Paul Simon’s son after several whiskeys.” (James A. Garfunkel was included on the cover of this Rolling Stone edition, about the children of rockstars, though he was not interviewed.)\n\nAs Binelli wrote, Harper “looks quite a bit like his father, circa ‘One Trick Pony,’ only with a less gaunt face and an expensive-looking messy haircut.” After his father married Edie Brickell, Harper moved out of the Simon Family’s Central Park apartment and into his own, in the Lower East Side. He “spent most of the Nineties…trying to get over his performance anxiety and taking odd jobs,” including a singular attempt at film acting.\n\nLooking back on the Nineties, he’s since called the decade a “sort of a parody of my life at the time.” After 9/11 befell the city, he moved to London with John Lennon’s son, Sean Lennon, “partly to escape the New York scene, partly to seek anonymity.” For another decade, he tried to find himself and his own voice; hanging out with Sean Lennon and making music. In 2010, he released a self-titled album. Rolling Stone called it a “collection of vintage-sounding country-folk tunes,” and, as he was nearing forty years of age, American Songwriter called Harper “a real star in the making.” He once played at Bonnaroo.\n\nHe met aspiring-actress Kick Kennedy, the daughter of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., at a lavish party in Morocco, and the two started dating. He was 41, and she was 25, but both agreed the age difference was a non-issue. According to a close friend, they moved-in together at a house in Los Angeles. “They collect art. They have pets.”\n\nThe two were considering marriage but, given the Kennedy Family legacy, the only stipulation to their holy union was that Harper convert to Roman Catholic. As stubborn as his father, Harper wouldn’t budge. The relationship fizzled-out, and Kick moved-on to billionaire Matthew Mellon, heir to the BNY Mellon Corporation and chairman of the New York Republican State Committee on finances. They swooned at the Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port and rollicked at his $150,000/mo rental home in Hollywood Hills.\n\nIn April of 2018, Matthew Mellon sought help for his addiction to OxyContin. He partook in the hallucinogenic drink ayahuasca, which many spiritualists (Paul Simon and Carrie Fisher included) have used to cleanse their souls. Unfortunately, the drink had the opposite effect, and Mellon died of a heart attack in his Cancun hotel room. Kick was shocked, heartbroken, and devastated. The banking empire was without an heir.\n\nAnd now, nearing fifty years of age, Harper Simon hosts a podcast.\n\nAlso in 1988, Columbia Records released “GARFUNKEL,” the second compilation album of the past four years to be comprised of Art Garfunkel’s solo singles. It features twelve tracks, eight of which had appeared on “The Art Garfunkel Album” in 1984.\n\nIn September of 1989, Knopf published “Still Water,” a collection of autobiographical poetry and monologues written in high-brow intellectualist prose. He began the project in 1983, while riding his motorcycle through the Swiss Alps, on his way to the Les Arcs resort where he'd meet “J,” his future muse, and be inspired to put pen to paper. “It's not the same as writing lyrics,” he said. “I've noodled around a bit, but I don't think of poems as songs. Only certain phrases marry to a tune… For me, the voice is my instrument. My center is music. If anything, I am a singer.”\n\nHe continued to walk across America. At home, he was reading the dictionary. He kept the 1,664-page Random House Dictionary on his kitchen table, reading it every morning, backwards, from ‘Z’ to ‘A.’ By 1989 he was on ‘F.’ Between the salt and pepper shakers was a hand-written rolodex of ‘interesting words’ and their definitions, catalogued in order of appearance. He compared his backwards dictionary adventure to ‘The Walk,’ as both were thorough explorations of banal activities, performed with utter seriousness.\n\nThe Random House Dictionary was nearly the thousandth book he’d read in his lifetime. “Yes, all 1,664 pages. It took me a couple of years.” In his 2015 piece for The Guardian, titled “Art Garfunkel: ‘Weird is a fair word for me,’” Paul Lester asked Art what we’re all wondering: Why? “Why not? I collected words I liked—words that would improve my vocabulary—so I could be more erudite and talk to you. Words that are lovely-sounding shells on the beach.” Riffing, Paul Lester asked him if there was “a finer-sounding word than ‘eschatological.’” Art guffawed, “You’ve taken the ‘c’ and made it a ‘ch,’ I see.” “Not scatological,” Lester insisted, “eschatological.” Art demurred, “I don’t know that one. I’m not that bright.”\n\nOn his website, Art Garfunkel keeps a “full listing” of all 1,281 books he’s read since June 1968, beginning with Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s “The Confessions,” supposedly written in 1781 and clocking-in at 606 pages. I mention these particular details because Art has, for every single book. In his “full listing,” since 1998, Art has meticulously identified and catalogued the reading order, author, title, page count, and year of publication for every book he’s read since he began his introspective lifestyle during the recording of “Bookends,” fifty years ago.\n\nAs Sam Allington (the only other person this obsessively interested in Art Garfunkel) noted, in 2013, Art makes “no effort…to contextualize the reading in any kind of lived experience, which lends Garfunkel’s list a compelling kind of mystery.” Then, if you dig further, “there is a sub-list, entitled ‘Favorite Books,’ which tells us a few things.” For example, “We see that Garfunkel is a fan of E.L. James, as his most contemporary favorite is ‘Fifty Shades of Grey,’” an unsurprising revelation from the man whose filmography defines him as lascivious.\n\n“‘After changes upon changes, we are more or less the same,’ Paul Simon philosophizes in a slightly revised version of ‘The Boxer,’ a number about eternal human struggle that's perhaps the finest song he wrote while he and Art Garfunkel were still a team.” In his 1982 Rolling Stone piece on the Concert in Central Park, Stephen Holden reflected, “Even though a decade of solo projects had separated them, their musical relationship seemed essentially unchanged. Garfunkel's pristine, quivering folk-pop tenor filtered Simon's wry, angst-ridden musings into a romantic soft focus, and the duo's close harmonies transformed dark compositions of doubt into warm exchanges of feeling.”\n\nThis oft-quoted line appeared in the legendary “fourth verse” that is typically replaced by a lone trumpet bleating as if it were attending a military funeral. The fourth verse was replaced for aesthetic purposes, so as to provide a reflective break between two illustrative chapters of the protagonist's life, thereby punctuating the emotional crescendo of the final verse when it does finally come. “[The protagonist has] made many mistakes, and he was so caught-up in the pettiness of life that he forgot some simple things, like the fact that he is older but still has a long way to go.” Live performances often see the fourth verse make a rare appearance, commenting on the passage of time and its circumstances. “The repetition of ‘we are more or less the same’ suggests that new things—good and bad—will happen, but at his core he’s no different. He observes that, no matter what has happened, he is right back where he started, struggling to find himself in the world when he is right there, missing it.”\n\n“The Boxer” is often considered one of Paul Simon’s masterpieces, to which I would agree, as it tells of an impoverished young boy fighting his whole life, just to scrape by, and bemoaning it all the way. He finally parlays into the boxing ring, where he takes his beatings physically rather than emotionally, but he reaches a point where his body can’t take it anymore — and though ‘the boxer’ leaves the arena, ‘the fighter’ still remains.\n\nI identify with and cherish this sixth verse, as a whole, but it is the final five words that really plucks the heartstrings. The first line, “In the clearing stands a boxer, and a fighter by his trade,” reintroduces our protagonist in his new profession, equating the terms ‘boxer’ and ‘fighter.’ “And he carries the reminders,” the song continues, implying the real and metaphorical hardships he’s battled, “Of ev’ry glove that laid him down or cut him / 'Til he cried out,” when he can no longer handle the brutality of the arena, “in his anger and his shame / ‘I am leaving, I am leaving,’ but the fighter still remains.”\n\nThe pugilist—the titular boxer—may hang-up his gloves, but the fighter—this man of tenacious character—will persevere forever, as “the fighter still remains.” These final five words of the song are imbued with as much meaning as the preceding six verses, to a degree that Paul later commented, “after completing ‘The Boxer’ I thought, ‘Hm, that’s better than I usually do.’” Nevertheless he felt like a phony; the chorus’s legendary refrain, “lie-la-lie,” was a filler. “I thought that ‘lie la lie’ was a failure of songwriting. I didn’t have any words! Then people said it was ‘lie’ but I didn’t really mean that; that it was ‘a lie.’ But, it’s not a failure of songwriting, because people like that and they put enough meaning into it, and the rest of the song has enough power and emotion—I guess—to make it go, so it’s all right. But for me, every time I sing that part, I’m a little embarrassed.”\n\nIn a 1984 interview with Playboy magazine, Paul elucidated on the origins of the song. “I think I was reading the Bible around that time. That’s where I think phrases such as ‘workman’s wages’ came from, and ‘seeking out the poorer quarters.’ That was biblical. I think the song was about me: Everybody’s beating me up, and I’m telling you now ‘I’m going to go away if you don’t stop.’ By that time we had encountered our first criticism. For the first few years, it was just pure praise.” Art agreed, in a 1990 interview with SongTalk, “Yeah, I knew ‘The Boxer’ was great. For one thing, it’s a style that is our strong suit. Paul and Artie could sing most effectively when they were doing a…fluid, running-along-syllable song like that. Whenever we did those folky, running things, the syllabication is ideal for what we had learned. We were tapping into something that went way back for us, and something we could get a blend on… I had a feeling that I could make it sound good. And the lyric is real nice. And the amount of labor in the studio was just unbelievable. That one took so many days.”\n\nDuring a concert, in 2016, Paul announced the death of Muhammed Ali to the audience, followed by a poignant and impromptu tribute of the sixth and final verse of “The Boxer.” The sorrowful determination in his voice, here, was so poignantly chilling it gave me goosebumps.\n\n“In the clearing stands a boxer, and a fighter by his trade / And he carries the reminders / Of ev’ry glove that laid him down or cut him / 'Til he cried out in his anger and his shame / ‘I am leaving, I am leaving,’ but the fighter still remains.”\n\nFinding himself available in August of 1991, Art returned to Wyoming and walked to Montana. In 1992, he toured Europe, and Japan. In 1993, Paul reached-out to his old friend and invited him to a twenty-one-show concert run at the Paramount Theater in Manhattan. Art agreed and counter-offered to feature his old friend in his upcoming compilation album, “Up ‘til Now.” Paul obliged, and on the fifth track of Art’s third compilation album in nine years the duo performed a ‘spoken word’ mock-news bulletin wherein Art tried to compose an abstract reason for their breakup while Paul interrupted him, facetiously, advising him on how to seem more serious. It’s not as funny as Art hoped it would be, considering he wanted it “to be like Nichols & May… Hoping people won't take the breakup of Simon & Garfunkel seriously,” however the effort only draws the listener to Art’s psychology, as he was evermore seeming to be the only person who hadn’t yet gotten over the duo’s split twenty-three years prior.\n\nIn a 1994 interview with Steve Parks, Art said, “I have a very sure-footed sense of what I like, and exactly how much I like it. Give me two listenings of a song, and I can tell you exactly how it sits with me… I know my musical taste; I know my ears; I know what I respond to.” Since 1970, his ears had preferred he not sing “Homeward Bound,” saying, “It has my former partner's sensibility about it.” However, at a recent Carnegie Hall performance, he caved, saying, “recently I've changed my mind… Tonight, I sing his songs again, but now his words come back to me with shades of mediocrity.” He guffawed. The audience wooed.\n\n“When I see the audience going for it, I just play along,” he said, suggesting his words were not his responsibility, while “tugging on the brim of his navy-blue baseball cap.” “I rode the moment,” he said, shifting the blame and conjuring a compromise to dull the reporter’s heat, “You'll notice that I also called Paul one of America's great songwriters.”\n\nFor the umpteenth time, the friendship of Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel soured, becoming acrimonious again for the remainder of the millennium. At his induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame as a solo artist, in 2001, Paul thanked his old partner, adding, “I regret the ending of our friendship. I hope that someday before we die we will make peace with each other.” After a brief pause, he suggested, “No rush.”\n\nIn August, 1996, Art Garfunkel finished ‘The Walk.’ He tread over four-thousand miles across America in just over twelve years, averaging less than a mile a day. “My goal,” he said, “was to feel my connection with America, one step at a time.” All that was required of him was to orient himself west, “and the rest is just follow your sense of direction and cut through the earth as if you were two-years-old and an unprogrammed human being who is going to just ‘go,’ you know, that verb ‘to go’ and you see the hills that are twelve miles away, and you say ‘I’m going there,’ and you walk there!”\n\n“The landscape seems to change with time much more rapidly than I thought. I try to look at what is no longer on Earth; things that existed up until just recently.” In a rare open-forum interview, online in 1999, Art told his fans that his most surprising discovery was “In the Appalachians of West Virginia; the sun was going down and I was stuck for a place to stay. I knocked on the door of a private farm house. Three college-age girls were in the middle of an LSD trip. They recognized me as Art Garfunkel. I learned that they were three of thousands (millions?) who are ‘invisible’ — pay no taxes, avoid the census taker; they are not on America's books.” He smelled the air.\n\nAs essayist Sam Allingham commented, in 2013, Art’s “‘Walk Across America’ is so thoroughly odd and so precisely documented that it transcends mere existence; it convinces us beyond a doubt that at some point Art Garfunkel was here.” Detailed to its fullest, with exact mileage and dates, Art supplied the unrequited details of his walk on his website. Now we know it took him just over two years to get through Montana—but why did we need to know? As Allingham asked, “the question remains: Why this form? Why, having walked across America…did Art Garfunkel decide to present this journey as a poorly-rendered map of America with a single line running through it and a seemingly unremarkable series of dates and places?”\n\n“The first answer is that Art Garfunkel lacks the ability to present his experiences in any other way. The second answer is that, increasingly, people are presenting their lives in the same way Art Garfunkel does: In random bursts of information, free of context, and that these bursts are what we consider personhood in the digital sphere.” For example, he has one webpage dedicated to every album cover of his solo career, excluding any relevant details, and another page dedicated to all 134 songs of his solo career: “Below is a list complied [sic] by Art Garfunkel of his entire body of work as a solo artist from 1973 - 2007. These songs have been ranked by Art in order of quality of his vocal performance and overall quality of the song.”\n\nIn May of 1998, Art Garfunkel began another Walk — this time, across Europe. From Ireland’s Shannon Airport, he walked east, onward to Great Britain, to be followed by France and—eventually—Istanbul. He approximated it to consume his next six years. “I’m not a treadmill guy. This is my way of getting exercise.”\n\nThe Walt Disney Company released a short documentary-style video to commemorate the singer’s chronicle of moseying, and he performed for a crowd at Ellis Island soon after. The recording of this concert was released on compact-disc as “Across America.” Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic awarded it two of five stars, saying, “Art Garfunkel returned to recording [with] a live album intended to commemorate his walk across America. Composed largely of oldies, the record is a pleasant enough nostalgia trip, but it doesn't have enough distinguished performances…to make the record a worthy addition, even to the collections of devoted fans.” Grimacing, Erlewine added, “a version of ‘The 52nd Street Bridge Song’ sung with his six-year-old son is notable, but it certainly isn't accomplished.”\n\nAnother reviewer wrote, “In 1984, Art Garfunkel started walking across the United States of America. I don’t know if this is true, but he finally finished in 1996.” As if to combat such ‘willful ignorance,’ every review, interview, and personal quote regarding Art’s Walk can be found on his website. “At best, they’re a little vague,” wrote Allingham, of the singer’s cherry-picked quotations. “At worst, they verge on self-parody. A book of such quotes would have been totally unbearable, as his poetry shows us.”\n\nIn “Still Waters,” 1989, Art listed the eight “MAJOR REVELATIONS” he learned on his walk:\n\nOUR ACTIONS ARE DRIVEN BY WE KNOW NOT WHAT\n\nAMBITION IS MIDDLE-CLASS\n\nGILLETTE COULD MAKE A BLADE THAT COULD LAST A LIFETIME IF THEY WANTED TO\n\nWE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR FEELINGS\n\nLIFE EATS LIFE\n\nIT'S ALL WHERE YOU OBSERVE IT FROM (RELATIVITY)\n\nIF ALL THINGS ARE CYCLES (NIGHT FOLLOWS DAY, SO DAY FOLLOWS NIGHT), THEN DEATH FOLLOWS LIFE, AND…\n\nALL IS VANITY.\n\nPaul Simon had spent the majority of the Nineties penning a musical about Salvador Agron, a Puerto Rican boy who had killed two people in New York while wearing a cape. This was a “story based on events that happened in 1959,” Paul explained, “events that I remembered.” He funded this endeavor himself, costing in excess of $11,000,000, and on January 29, 1998, “The Capeman” finally opened on Broadway.\n\nIt bombed, earning horrid reviews, abysmal box office returns, and only 68 performances (six weeks) before closure. The cast recording was released at the end of the previous year, to mixed reviews, and was the first Paul Simon album to fall short of the Billboard Top 40. As if it were his destiny, he plunged once again into depression. The pains of failure and worthlessness were numbed by ayahuasca, the Amazonian hallucinogenic he had taken once with Carrie Fisher. “The feeling was almost indescribable,” he said of the drink. “You couldn’t imagine feeling any better, and the afterglow would last for days. It also enabled me to hear new sounds in my head, which led to me being able to write songs much faster than before.”\n\nPaul had long-felt unwilling to comment on his coping mechanisms—that is, until he obliged his old colleague, the music critic Robert Hilburn. “He’s very private,” said Hilburn, who first met Paul while freelancing with the LA Times in 1966. He had persistently taken the ‘Paul Simon’ assignments for more than two decades, including—most notably, in 1987—one gig as the sole journalist allowed to shadow Paul on the worldwide “Graceland Tour.” “He wasn’t like a lot of other people I interviewed at the time,” Hilburn recalled. “He was very articulate. He wasn’t very chummy, but he wasn’t nervous talking about his creative process. He was very forthcoming.”\n\nAs Rolling Stone detailed, in 2018, Hilburn had insisted on penning Paul’s biography, but the bard dismissed the idea. “Why do I need a biography? My life doesn’t matter. It’s the songs that matter,” to which Hilburn replied, “Well, it’s the creative process, Paul, it’s fascinating. People would like to know about it. It ought to be part of your legacy and your history.” Inevitably, with ‘legacy’ on the table, Paul conceded. “He still had a certain reluctance,” remembered Hilburn, “but I think vaguely he saw that there is a certain value in having a serious book about him.”\n\nHe spent much of their sessions as if they were interviews, preferring to talk about his current project—2016’s “Stranger to Stranger”—than to talk about any particular incident. Time after time he had to be reminded that they were writing a book and not an article. The hardest part for Hilburn, however, was getting a word with Art Garfunkel. As Andy Greene wrote, “Garfunkel wasn’t psyched about the idea of reliving their tortured history.” Art declined by saying he was writing his own biography and didn’t want to contribute to ‘the opposition,’ but as time went on his excuses became more vague. As Hilburn recalled, “The impression I got was that he didn’t want to do anything that would help Paul. I said to him, ‘Look, I will treat you with the equal respect that I give Paul. I’m not taking sides.’ Finally he wrote me a letter; it basically said, ‘Please don’t contact me anymore. I just don’t want to do it.’”\n\nOn his own, Paul Simon inserted himself into the cultural zeitgeist as a master songwriter of unpredictable style and enviable imagination. On his own, Art Garfunkel became, as Sam Allingham wrote, someone who is “simultaneously extremely famous and completely culturally irrelevant.” The once-teacher of mathematics had released ten mediocre solo albums over forty years, generating fourteen hits for the Adult Contemporary charts, with six reaching the Top 40 and three closer to Top 20. Neil Strauss of The New York Times described Art’s voice as “one of the finest instruments in all of popular music;” “a tenor he has wielded with varying effect since 1970,” continued Allingham, “when he stopped singing Paul Simon’s songs and started singing inferior songs by other people. Art Garfunkel is the sort of person who most people only know is alive because they have not yet heard news that he is dead.”\n\n“Were Art Garfunkel to die, we would be immediately reminded of his life: his records, his acting career, even his poetry,” though not quite his poetry. “But until the news of his death arrives, Art Garfunkel lives in the specific limbo of the used-to-be-famous.” Allingham goes on to argue that, for the past decade, the only remaining presence of Art Garfunkel—or, ART GARGUNKEL, as he wrote online—exists on his website, where he more-or-less pioneered the idea of social media—an outlet of obtuse, narcissistic, and rather antisocial one-way interaction across time—with his inept, figure-based chronicle of life: the “What I’ve Read” book list (1,281 titles and counting); the geriatric jpeg distinguishing his Walk Across America, and the timetables beneath to assure us of every step he took along the way—an unrequited precedent of the status update; the banal prophecy of opinion listicles in the ranking of his own solo singles by preference; a long-winded, self-focused, self-serving autobiography; quotes-from and links-to every post-S&G article that has interviewed or mentioned him; etcetera.\n\nAs Allingham wrote, whether Art Garfunkel is a loon or a prophet, “the fact remains that we are increasingly portraying ourselves in ways that are more about ‘what we have done’ and ‘when’ and ‘where we did it’ than ‘why.’” Like the essayist, I’ve spent more time than I care to admit researching the intricacies of Art Garfunkel’s life—and I couldn’t exactly tell you ‘why.’ “The truth is that, no matter how much I try, I’ll never be able to understand what the hell Art Garfunkel sees as an ordering principle for his ‘Body of Work,’ and I have come to the conclusion that he doesn’t want me to. This, it seems to me, is the moral of Art Garfunkel; the one that rests below his relentless quantification of his own life” — the expected behavior of a man who once chose the moniker “Tom Graph” because he loved to chart and analyze every aspect of his world.\n\n“If, for whatever reason, you cannot get across to someone what it was like to have an experience, then the next best thing is to record that experience in great detail;” to conjure a dollop of voyeurism through passive-aggressive levels of exposition. “Even though people will never know what it was like to travel through Frankfort, Kentucky, on October 12, 1988…they will at least wonder a little,” and that seed will sow itself in their mind, and the farmer of mystery will exist in their head evermore, conjuring the immortal question—why?—and the farmer of mystery thereby earns life after death. He becomes “something for them to think about as they fall asleep at night, the same way I’ve been wondering about these things for the last several weeks.” And inevitably, despite the clear severance of time, space, and relation between Allingham and I, this ugly question—why, Art Garfunkel?—has united us; an impossible connection owed to an ‘antisocial one-way interaction across time,’ eavesdropped upon and investigated by two misanthropes with interests beyond explanation.\n\nIn a 2015 interview with The Guardian, Art was asked about the past sixty years of friendship he shared with his former partner. Unrecovered from his contempt, he mustered the reply, “Paul Simon is a man who has enormously enriched my life, period.” Pressed for the “vice versa,” he said, “Yeah, we’ve enriched each other’s lives. What would have been his life if his friend Artie didn’t sing so good and been so good and produced those records so good? What would it have been? Something smaller.”\n\nIn a 2007 concert produced by Paul Simon, Art made a surprise appearance to sing “Bridge Over Troubled Water” alongside his former partner. He relished in his waning limelight, as the relationship between the two old friends had finally washed away in troubled waters, more like the Bridge on the River Kwai than its sturdy peers, of Brooklyn or Golden Gate. In a 1993 interview, they predicted the end by defining the beginning:\n\nPAUL: “We were kids and we didn't think it was a big deal to break-up, so we broke-up.”\n\nART: “We did give each other a quality that each of us wanted from the other, as if we were trying to make one perfect person together.”\n\nPAUL: “I think he just gave me the confidence that I probably wouldn't have had by myself. I think I would've been shy to do that without Artie.”\n\nART: “I guess he was using my popularity as part of who he was — but I was using his drive, to get someplace, because I'm more of a laid-back guy and always was. I don't think I would have had the career I've had if not for the engine that Paul Simon is.”\n\nIn 1998, Art Garfunkel was nominated for a Grammy—his sole solo nomination—for ‘Best Children's Album,’ with “Songs from a Parent to a Child.” Comparatively, Paul—solo—has taken home twelve Grammy Awards, a Lifetime Achievement Award (his second), and five ‘Album of the Year’ nominations—winning three—to become one of only six artists to independently earn this award on more than one occasion. He’s garnered nearly seventy-five-million radio airplays, according to BMI surveys, and has been honored with Oscar nominations, inductions into the Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame (twice, as a solo artist and as half a duo), a Top 10 seed in The American Film Institute’s “100 Years 100 Songs” list for “Mrs. Robinson,” and a selection as one of Time Magazine’s “100 People Who Shaped the World.”\n\nIn 2002, Paul Simon was one of five recipients of the nation’s highest merit for cultural influence: the Kennedy Center Honor. Paul’s tribute was given by his old friend, comedian Steve Martin, who said, “His career has survived cultural changes and been reborn each time with a new burst of creativity. He’s gone through and survived folk music, disco, punk, grunge, rap… I have seen Paul’s diligence and sincerity when it comes to his work.” He added, “I don’t use the word ‘genius’ very often,” to which Paul beamed. His aura throughout this tribute was one of genuine happiness and fulfillment. It was as if, for once, he had become satisfied with his life’s work.\n\n“Throughout the years,” Steve Martin continued, “Paul has fine-tuned his generosity, his love for family, his genuine appreciation of the work of others, and his own production as an artist. I see him enjoying life and, most of all, I witnessed his continuing dedication to the art of writing and performing music. His care for his art has affected not only our generation but generations yet to come.”\n\nClaire Goldberg was one of these youths forever-changed by the aging bard. In her ode to Paul Simon, published in 2018, she wrote, “I remember trying to write my college essays senior year of high school, and a teacher told me to write about something that meant a lot to me, so I started writing about ‘Graceland.’ I never used the essay, but in it I tried to explain all the road trips I had been on, all the times I had listened to it, [and] how it was something that connected me to my family. I tried to explain that it may have been one of the first pieces of truly good music that I ever listened to. So here I am, trying to write about it again, still struggling to put into words how and why I love Paul Simon the way I do.”\n\nYet, by the end of seven paragraphs, she says it as best as anyone could: “Paul Simon is just so impossibly good—and I know its not as simple as that; I know there is so much that makes him so good, but sometimes that’s all you can say. His fan base spans generations and his music spans genres. It’s impossible to listen and to not like every second of his music.”\n\nIn 2007, he was the first-ever recipient of the annual ‘Gershwin Prize for Popular Song’ bestowed by the Library of Congress, recognizing “the profound and positive effect of popular music on the world's culture.” Of the honor, he said, “I am grateful to be the recipient of the Gershwin Prize, and doubly honored to be the first. I look forward to spending an evening in the company of artists I admire [and] I can think of a few who have expressed my words and music far better than I. I'm excited at the prospect of that happening again. It's a songwriter's dream come true.”\n\n“The Essential Paul Simon” compilation album was released later that year. Featuring the thirty-six most-definitively “Paul Simonic” of his songs, the 1971-2006 chronicle of his life’s work was highly-regarded. Stephen Erlewine of Allmusic gave it 9/10 stars, calling it “his biggest album, [functioning] as a nice transition between his better-known Seventies hits and the more esoteric but frequently compelling work that he's done since.” Tracks included the recent “Wartime Prayers,” “The Obvious Child,” and Oscar-nominated “Father and Daughter,” as well as classics like “Under African Skies,” “The Boy in the Bubble,” “Late in the Evening,” “Kodachrome,” “50 Ways to Leave Your Lover,” “Hearts and Bones,” “Graceland,” “Still Crazy After All These Years,” “American Tune,” “Loves Me Like a Rock,” “Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard,” “You Can Call Me Al,” and his first post-S&G success, “Mother and Child Reunion.”\n\nIn the following years, he was further honored with induction into the American Academy of Arts & Sciences; he gave a public (and heartbreaking) tribute performance on the minute-exact ten-year anniversary of the September 11th attacks; and he was listed with prominence among Rolling Stone’s “100 Greatest Guitarists” and “100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time.” In 201"
