        "text": "So back in my June of 2020 blog post listing Arcane Musical Instruments, #4 was the humble cowbell. Part of my text read: Thanks to Christopher Walken’s requesting “MORE COWBELL!” on the spoof of The Blue Oyster Cult’s recording “Don’t Fear The Reaper” from Saturday Night Live in 2000, everybody knows this instrument. This topic is good enough that later on we will likely devote an entire post to it. Well, rejoice for that “Time Has Come Today” (cowbell classic by The Chambers Brothers)! The Wiki on the cowbell tells of how it was used to keep track of free-range cattle and that it dates at least as far back as the 2nd Century B.C. in China. There is no mention, however, if some ancient Asian dude pulled it off his ‘Niú’ and started pounding on it creating the classic intro to “Honky Tonk Women” centuries before Jimmy Miller beat it for The Rolling Stones.\n\nBefore we start the list, let’s decide that it will not include most of the obvious songs. You won’t see the above listed or “A Hard Day’s Night”, “Limbo Rock”, “Evil Ways”, “Little Darlin'”, etc. but if we do a part 2 all bets are off. Gonna try to include some that are not as well known or some forgotten goodies that oldies radio rarely plays.\n\n1.The (Paul Collins) Beat – Working Too Hard\n\nThere is no truth to the rumor that when Jerry Ford uttered the words “My fellow Americans, our long national nightmare is over” he was referring to the end of disco and the return of rock and roll but that was how your blogger felt. In 1979-81, groups like The Knack, The Romantics and The Go-Gos brought guitars and power pop songs to the airwaves. Every week while your Dentist lived on the plains in Brush, I would tune in to my pal G Brown’s KADE radio program The New Arts Review and listen for gems. One of those New Wave groups was The Beat lead by Paul Collins. His band released 2 classic albums on Columbia that never found the audience they deserved, but are adored by fans of guitar-driven rock and 2 minute catchy songs. This rocker was from their self-titled debut from ’79. Billy Joe Armstrong has shown excellent taste by playing another song from that record “Walking Out On Love” in concerts with Green Day. To avoid confusion with the English band called The Beat, Collins has since changed the group’s name to The Paul Collins Beat.\n\n2.The Knack – Rocket O’ Love\n\nLet’s next play the initial big winners of the return to rock and roll in 1979 – The Knack. “My Sharona” seemed to come out of nowhere and blasted to the top of the charts. After their follow-up albums charted lower and lower, they broke up. In January of 1991 after a decade apart, Doug Feiger put the band back together to release Serious Fun – unfortunately to a collective yawn from the record buying public. Your Dentist loved it of course as it was straight ahead power pop rock and roll. This song as the single did reach #9 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Chart. Drumming was handled by newcomer Billy Ward.\n\n3.Procol Harum – Bringing Home The Bacon\n\nThe late B.J. Wilson who drummed for Procol Harum used cowbell on several songs including “Whiskey Train” and this track from the 1973 album Grand Hotel. On this, their 6th LP, they sported a new line-up with Mick Grabham coming in on guitar (the previous guitarist Dave Ball had taken part in the album cover shoot so they superimposed Mick’s head on Ball’s body). Here is a live version showing B.J. pounding the cowbell in the middle of his drum kit. Your Dentist will continue to scream for the late Gary Brooker and company to enter the rock hall along with Jethro Tull who pioneered the kind of music apparently the hall hates – intelligent and progressive.\n\n4.Annette (Funicello) & The Afterbeats – Tall Paul\n\nBetween 1958 to ’61, Annette placed 10 records on the U.S. hot 100, but is pretty much ignored on oldies radio now. Admittedly her records were pretty light-weight pop, but she was cute and had the Disney empire behind her which didn’t hurt. Today she is mostly remembered for the string of beach movies she made. She died April 8, 2013 from complications due to multiple sclerosis (age 70). This song was written by the Sherman Brothers who won Oscars for Mary Poppins.\n\n5.Lee Michaels – Goodbye Goodbye\n\nIf it wasn’t for “Do You Know What I Mean” from his 5th album, Michaels would be pretty much unknown even though he released a string of nice vinyl from 1968 to ’74 on A&M and Columbia. FM radio back in ’69 played the song “Heighty Hi” from his self-titled 3rd LP which also had some nice cowbell. The interesting thing about him was that he performed only with a drummer while he played bass on the Hammond organ pedals. This 45-only song didn’t chart in ’69.\n\n6.The Rutles – Number One\n\nWell if you are going to ape the early music of the Fab Four then you are going to have to use a lot of cowbell. The 1978 All You Need Is Cash film was at once a brilliant parody of The Beatles and a loving tribute in many ways. For fans of that sort of music, Neil Innes’ soundtrack album was manna from heaven – like getting a lost Beatles album. While the original movie was a ratings flop on TV, it has become a classic that will last a lunchtime.\n\n7.Bread – Don’t Shut Me Out\n\nBack in 1969 when this came out as the debut for Bread, it was WAY too mellow for this Hendrix-loving senior at Broomfield High School. In retrospect, it was a fine album full of catchy songs including the original non-hit version of “It Don’t Matter To Me”. David Gates had been around the music biz for over a decade by then having released a string of non-hit singles, written “Popsicles & Icicles” (The Murmaids) and produced “Diddy Wah Diddy” (Captain Beefheart & His Magic Band). This album on Elektra was a flop getting to only #127 on the charts. It wasn’t till “Make It With You” from their next album that Bread began their hit run.\n\n8.(Screaming) Lord Sutch – Cause I Love You\n\nHigh School friend Gary Essex didn’t have great musical taste, but did play this stupid rock and roll record for your Dentist which grabbed the young me. This track was basically Led Zeppelin with Robert Plant replaced by Lord Sutch – a not so talented singer. Englishman David Sutch founded the Official Monster Raving Loony Party and ran unsuccessfully for Parliament 39 times. In the early ’60s his stage schtick was horror themed – sorta Alice Cooper the early days. Dude knew he couldn’t sing, yet got some notoriety for the 1963 Joe Meek produced song “Jack The Ripper”. This cut from his 1970 record Lord Sutch & Heavy Friends was written by John Bonham, Daniel Edwards, Jimmy Page and Sutch. This LP was voted (in a 1998 BBC poll) as the worst all-time album – a bit harsh, I would say.\n\n9.Led Zeppelin – Good Times Bad Times\n\nGuess if we are going to play an embarrassing Bonham/Page moment at #7, we need to let them redeem themselves with this song from their great self-titled debut LP. This was their 1st U.S. single (1969), but managed to only hit #80 on the hot 100 (#66 in Cash Box). Bonham’s cowbell and sledgehammer drums plus Page’s flash lead guitar were outstanding.\n\n10.Mountain – Sittin’ On A Rainbow\n\n1970 also saw the release of the debut album by Mountain – Climbing!. They were a success right out of the box with “Mississippi Queen” which has some glorious cowbell played by Corky Laing. Other album tracks used cowbell to max affect including “Never In My Life” and this track which begins with a percussive barrage. Singer/guitarist Leslie West with Laing and Gail Collins wrote this song. Collins wrote a lot with her husband bassist Felix Pappalardi (“World Of Pain”, “Strange Brew” – with Eric Clapton) and managed to get off fairly lightly for killing him in 1983, getting out of jail in April of ’85.\n\n11.Robin Trower – Lady Love\n\nWhile I would love to have included the Jimi Hendrix song “Stone Free” here, his recorded legacy has pretty much been swept off youtube by the powers that be so you can only get live recordings. Instead let’s got with another great song that has a Hendrix vibe to it off Robin Trower’s 2nd solo album Bridge Of Sighs, by far his best. After leaving Procol Harum, Trower totally abandoned progressive music and embraced bluesy rock fully (something he had done a bit in Procol on songs like “Poor Mohammed”). Interestingly Procol Harum had some of their biggest successes just after Trower left (“Conquistador” and Grand Hotel). With vocalist/bassist James Dewar and drummer Reg Isadore, Trower was also successful on his 1st 2 solo albums so it worked out fine in the end. He was born in England on March 9, 1945.\n\n12.The Baja Marimba Band – The Portuguese Washerwoman\n\nLed by Julius Wechter (who had written “Spanish Flea” and other songs for the Tijuana Brass), The Baja Marimba Band records were mostly recorded by The Wrecking Crew (as were those of The TJB). Neither act featured any Latinos (Wechter and Herb Alpert were both Jewish). Wechter had originally been one of The Wrecking Crew himself playing percussion on Beach Boys records among others. Taken from the 1966 LP Watch Out!, this single hit #126 on the hot 100 (#15 adult contemporary).\n\n13.Shango – Day After Day (It’s Slipping Away)\n\nThis Caribbean themed single made it to #57 here in 1969 (#39 in Canada). It was also found on their self-titled debut LP. The song was a light-hearted spoof on an earthquake disaster wiping out California. The only band member of note was Tommy Reynolds later of Hamilton, Joe Frank & Reynolds. He along with producer Jerry Riopelle and Margolin wrote this, their only hit.\n\n14.The Five Man Electrical Band – Absolutely Right\n\nPlease tell your Dentist why the insipid “Signs” got to #3 in the U.S. while this far superior single only hit #26 in 1971 (#3 in Canada, at least)? Cowbell discrimination if you ask me. This was on their ’72 Big Tree LP Coming Of Age. Songwriter Les Emmerson had written a song for his Canadian band The Staccatos called “Five Man Electrical Band” which they decided was a better group name so they took that new moniker in 1969. They disbanded in 1975.\n\n15.Jan & Dean – Bucket ‘T’\n\nOkay, I’m not real sure if they are beating on a cowbell as it sounds a bit trebly, but it is metallic so let’s go with it (coulda been a hubcap as well). A T-bucket is a modified Ford Model T favored by ’50s hot-rodders (Kookie drove one in the TV show 77 Sunset Strip). Don Altfeld, Jan Berry, Roger Christian and Dean Torrence wrote this tribute song for the 1964 LP Dead Man’s Curve / The New Girl In School. It also showed up as the flip to the 1966 45 “Batman!”.\n\n16.Jay Ferguson – Shakedown Cruise\n\nYour blogger faced a dilemma, put this song in the Boats & The Sea post (November 2021) or this one. The cowbell won out. Either way, this was a single I bought back in the day by the former Spirit singer. Californian John ‘Jay’ Ferguson founded The Red Roosters with friends including Randy California. They changed their name to Spirits Rebellious (later Spirit) which Jay left in ’71 to form Jo Jo Gunne. His biggest solo hit was “Thunder Island” in ’78 (#9). This single charted #31 the following year from his Real Life Ain’t This Way LP. Since then he has written for film and TV including the theme to the U.S. version of The Office.\n\n17.Detroit – Rock ‘N’ Roll\n\nOnly hip dudes like my pal DC followed Mitch Ryder (William Levise) after his ’60s success with The Detroit Wheels to this 1971 self-titled LP. The only holdover musician was the drummer from the Wheels Johnny ‘Bee’ Badanjek with the guitar handled by Steve Hunter. The original version was a Lou Reed composition from the Loaded album that sorta sounded like faux Dylan. Hunter would eventually join Reed’s solo band. Alice Cooper did a new version on his 2021 album Detroit Stories sans cowbell.\n\n18.The Standells – Sometimes Good Guys Don’t Wear White\n\nAs this was only a #43 charter in the U.S. back in 1966, it counts as an obscurity in my book and deserves a place here. Of course “Dirty Water” is their biggie (#11 – 1965), but this bit of snotty garage rock was just as good. It was found on their Tower records album Dirty Water and like their biggest hit, was written by former member of The Four Preps Ed Cobb – the producer.\n\n19.(The Guess Who) Chad Allan & The Expressions – I’d Rather Be Alone\n\nHere is a song that definitely fits the bill of an obscurity. Folks that know The Guess Who generally start with “These Eyes” in 1969. If pushed, older fans would likely recall “Shakin’ All Over” (1965) which was a hit before Burton Cummings replaced Chad Allan as lead singer. Up in their native Canada, Chad Allan & The Expressions released several records before changing their name to The Guess Who. This Allan composition was on their debut Canadian-only LP Shakin’ All Over (1965).\n\n20.The Turtles – I’m Chief Kamanawanalea (We’re The Royal Macadamia Nuts)\n\nWell let’s finish this 1st cowbell tribute post with something really stupid. The Turtles best album (other than a greatest hits LP) was their 1968 vinyl The Turtles Present The Battle Of The Bands. The hits “Elenore” and “You Showed Me” were there, but so was weirdness like this and the return to their days as The Cross Fires with “Surfer Dan”. The concept is that each song was supposedly performed by a different type act (hence the battle of the bands). On TV shows Mark Volman soloed on cowbell about 1:48 into the song “She’d Rather Be With Me” so hopefully he played it on this cut as well.\n\nAnother year of music passes along with some musicians we will miss – not the least of which was drummer Jim Gallagher of the Boulder ’60s band The Astronauts. I personally will miss having a meal with Jim at The Sink and hearing his stories from the road. It was good to finally see live music again. Peter Noone of Herman’s Hermits put on a fun and energetic free show in Albany, Oregon back in July (thanks for not cancelling after we drove half way across the U.S. to see you with daughter Hilary). Nick Lowe with Los Straitjackets also rocked the Oriental Theater back a few weeks ago with your Dentist, the RocknRoll Dental Hygienist Aimee and ace Denver Dentist Chuck Fischer in attendence.\n\nSome folks have asked how your Dentist finds some of the music on our list. Friday has become the industry new release day so every Friday your Dentist will look online for new releases and listen to clips or full songs on youtube if they sound good enough. Another fun thing I have done for decades now is exchange tapes with my drummer pal DC on which we do commentary and play musical clips for each other. It has been fun to include Mr. D’s son Brett in these on-going exchanges over the last decade or so. Let’s get rolling and keep in mind that I always love your suggested additions so please send them my way (and look for my friend Brad Hall’s yearly alternate list when he sends it along).\n\nDoc Krieger’s Top 20 Albums 2021\n\n1.The Fratellis – Half Drunk Under A Full Moon\n\nNever heard of these Scots before but this is their 6th album. They are a 3 piece operating under a fake last name taken from the movie The Goonies. Listening to their old albums (which have been successful over there, but not here), this CD is a HUGE change in sound going from alt-rock to a heavily echoed retro pop sound. The title track is bubblegummy while “Lay Your Body Down” sounds like ’60s pop and “Strangers In The Street” could be Phil Spector. Another fine track is “Living In The Dark”.\n\n2.Reach – The Promise Of A Life\n\nHere is a trio from Sweden on their 3rd album. The sound seems strongly influenced by bands like Muse and Queen. “The Law” is a slinky rocker while “Young Again” has a poppy keyboard that bounces along. The title track is pure Muse = definitely not a dance record.\n\n3.The Doobie Brothers – Liberte\n\nThis album marks the 50th year since their debut album. It took a long time for your Dentist to warm up to these guys originally from San Jose, but it is hard not to love their classics like “China Grove” and “Take Me In Your Arms”. Their new record has a couple of very Doobie sounding tracks in “Easy” and “Just Can’t Do This Anymore”, but the stand-outs for me are tracks like “Cannonball” and “Good Thang” which sound more like the country-rock sound of The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band.\n\n4.The Damn Truth – Now Of Nowhere\n\n“When Hippies meet Hard Rock” is how this Canadian act is described. Their 3rd album is mostly helmed by legendary producer Bob Rock and the record sounds great. The song “Tomorrow” starts like Guns ‘N Roses then feels like a hard Jefferson Airplane track with a catchy chorus. The final track “Shot ‘Em” has a nifty “Stairway To Heaven” vibe.\n\n5.Mostly Autumn – Graveyard Star\n\nThis year’s list is light on progressive rock which is one of my fave styles. Mostly Autumn are English and have been around since 1995 fusing the sound of ’70s proggers like Genesis and Renaissance. The song “Shadows” feels like Pink Floyd as does “The Endless War” with its David Gilmour-like guitar solo. They alternate male and female singers on the album. The closer “Turn Around Slowly” is a 12 1/2 minute epic.\n\n6.Colin Linden – bLOW\n\nWhite man blues from Canada by a member of the band Blackie & The Rodeo Kings who’s been around since the ’70s. “Angel Next To Me” has a classic Muddy Waters vibe and the closer “Honey On My Tongue” melds guitar and harmonica on a tasty riff. “Ain’t No Shame” is a Stevie Ray Vaughan-ish guitar raver.\n\n7.Steve Hackett – Surrender Of Silence\n\nAnother prog classic from former Genesis guitarist extraordinaire Hackett. “Natalia” has a Russian classicism about it while “Held In The Shadows” is pure prog. “Devil’s Cathedral” feels like King Crimson with crazy sax and church organ. “The Obliterati” and “Fox’s Tango” have some very evil guitar sounds.\n\n8.Eclipse – Wired\n\n“Viva La Victoria” from this Swedish band’s last album Paradigm was outstanding. There is nothing as good here, but the album is still solid ’80s-style melodic hard rock. The best tracks for me are “Twilight”, the arena rocker “We Didn’t Come To Lose” and “Dying Breed”.\n\n9.Rod Stewart – The Tears Of Hercules\n\nHis 32nd solo studio album finds Rod still in fine voice making excellent music. The biggest drawback for me is the use of programmed drums on most tracks which ruins the rockers for me. “One More Time” is catchy at least. The ballads stand-out, however, including the ’50s sounding “Precious Memories” and a fine cover of Johnny Cash’s “These Are My People”. Hire a drummer next time, please!\n\n10.Southern Culture On The Skids – At Home With…\n\n38 years after forming, the North Carolina trio are still making fun retro rock. They do a fun cover of Nancy Sinatra’s “Sugar Town” and a surprising long workout on Traffic’s “Dear Mr. Fantasy”. They are all over the map with the surf instro “Night Driver” and the frat rocker “Run Baby Run”.\n\n11.Andrew W.K. – God Is Partying\n\n20 years ago Andrew Wilkes-Krier released his debut I Get Wet album and likely will never top it. That being said, he always releases interesting music. This time he played all the instruments on an album that is sorta proggy bombastic metal. On “No One To Know” his vocals sound more mature while “I Made It” is sorta like more metallic Survivor. “Not Anymore” has a catchy chorus with keys.\n\n12.Billy F Gibbons – Hardware\n\nAs the driving force of ZZ Top, Gibbons is certainly not going to start pumping out tender ballads on this his 3rd solo album. You get mostly straight bluesy rock and roll of various tempos. “More-More-More” sounds the most like his band while “She’s On Fire” is a hot rocker. “I Was A Highway” is also a highlight.\n\n13.Micky Dolenz – Dolenz Sings Nesmith\n\nEarlier today, we learned that Mike Nesmith had passed which is a shock as he had weeks ago completed a final Monkees tour with Micky Dolenz. With production by Mike’s son Christian, this is a fine tribute to the man who introduced us kids to country-rock. The label name is 7a (from the start of “Daydream Believer”) while the cover recalls the 1970 LP Nilsson Sings Newman – both very cool references. The best tracks for me are “Carlisle Wheeling”, “Little Red Rider” and “Propinquity (I’ve Just Begun To Care)”.\n\n14.Mammoth WVH – Mammoth WVH\n\nWVH is Eddie Van Halen’s talented son Wolfgang who is a one-man band on his debut album. You get metallic rockers like “Don’t Back Down” and radio friendly goodies like “Think It Over” (if you can find a rock radio station that would play this).\n\n15.Lord Huron – Long Lost\n\nLanguid Spaghetti Western tinged Americana is found on this L.A. band’s 4th long-player. “Not Dead Yet” is the closest song to a rocker while the title track feels like the ghost of Roy Orbison is haunting it. “Mine Forever” has you wanting a glass of water to wash away the dust and tumbleweeds – yet it’s catchy.\n\n16.Jake Bugg – Saturday Night Sunday Morning\n\nJames Kennedy is an English 27 year old singer/songwriter with 5 albums to his credit. His pinched voice can annoy at times, but the quality of his music makes up for it. Check out the KT Tunstall-like “Kiss Like The Sun” with the languid parts mixed with driving guitar sections. “Hold Tight” is a lovely acoustic ballad while “Maybe It’s Today” channels Phil Spector’s Wall Of Sound.\n\n17.The Cocktail Slippers – Shout It Out Loud!\n\nLittle Steven Van Zandt knows good music so if it’s on his Wicked Cool label it is worth checking out. This Norwegian female rock band has been around for 20 years with differing members. They wear their influences well with “She Devil (Shout It Out Loud!)” in a Donnas vein, “You & I” evokes The Primitives while “Like A Song Stuck In My Head” feels like the best of early Bangles or Go-Gos.\n\n18.Oscar Lang – Chew The Scenery\n\nLang is a young London musician who shows promising talent on this up and down album. An electro-song like “Yeah!” leaves me cold but at the other end is a fine moody acoustic ballad in “Final Call”. “21st Century Hobby” is my fave on the album.\n\n19.Dion – Stomping Ground\n\nAt 82 Dion DiMucci is one of the last remaining early American rock and rollers, but he still has the musical spark as seen by his last 2 blues/rock albums that mix him with some quality musicians. He does a nifty version of “Red House” with “Keb’ Mo’ while he mixes it up pretty good with Eric Clapton on “If You Wanna Rock ‘N’ Roll”. “I Got My Eyes On You Baby” is a piano-driven rocker with Marcia Ball and Jimmy Vivino.\n\n20.Needtobreathe – Into The Mystery\n\n8 albums in to their career, these South Carolinians make Americana music that has also been labelled as Christian (however they simply say they are a rock and roll band). “Carry Me” is a wonderful song with Jon Foreman of the group Switchfoot.\n\nTop Archival Release 2021\n\nGary Moore – How Blue Can You Get\n\nIrish guitarist Moore passed 10 years ago at age 58 so in honor of that his family compiled a CD of 8 previously unreleased blues/rock workouts. This inclusion is for the music not for the packaging which is way too skimpy. There is zero session info as to who played on what. 4 are originals like “In My Dreams” while 4 are covers. Check out Freddie King’s “I’m Tore Down” and Memphis Slim’s guitar instro “Steppin’ Out”.\n\nTop EP 2021\n\nMen Without Hats-Again (Part 1)\n\nTo mark time till their 2022 album, this Canadian band has released a 5 song covers EP. They even rearranged their old hit “The Safety Dance” as “No Friends Of Mine”. “2000 Light Years From Home” by The Rolling Stones has been transformed into electro-psychedelia. Other tracks – Mott The Hoople’s “All The Young Dudes” + “Satellite Of Love” by Lou Reed.\n\nTop 20 Orphan Songs 2021-downloads, singles or isolated tracks on so-so albums.\n\n1.The Wallflowers – Who’s That Man Walking ‘Round My Garden\n\nTill now Jakob Dylan’s band has never impressed your Dentist. After a decade away they released Exit Wounds which also wasn’t my cup o’tea except this surprisingly Tom Petty-like rocker. Butch Walker’s production makes it sound amazing.\n\n2.Barry Gibb (with Gillian Welch, David Rawlings) – Butterfly\n\nYour Dentist loves the music of classic Bee Gees. It simply doesn’t make any sense for lead singer Barry Gibb to record an album (Greenfields) of inferior duet versions of their music with country artists. This song, however, manages to improve upon the Bee Gee’s version simply because the original was a pre-fame rougher recording. A whole album redoing early songs like this would have been a good idea.\n\n3.Cheap Trick – Quit Waking Me Up\n\nI suspect if In Another World wasn’t their 20th studio album but was their 2nd I would be falling all over it, but instead it gets compared to their great catalog and comes off as just another record. This song, however is catchy and showcases what I like about them – vaguely Beatley power pop.\n\n4.Mick Jagger + Dave Grohl – Easy Sleazy\n\nNever have liked Mick’s solo stuff or Dave Grohl’s band Foo Fighters, but put them together on this one-off and you get a Rolling Stonesy rockin’ delight. Hope they record some more. Grohl actually seems like a pretty talented guy so may have to check out more of his stuff.\n\n5.Suzi Quatro – The Devil In Me\n\nDetroit’s Suzi had to go to England to become a star with tracks like “Can The Can” and “Devil Gate Drive” in the ’70s. It is great to hear that at age 71 the lady is still rocking with help from her son (though her voice is deeper). This song is the title track and blows away the rest of the LP. This sounds like it could have been a classic Bon Scott era ACDC rocker.\n\n6.Procol Harum – Missing Persons (Alive Forever)\n\nWow, except for the conventional boring drums this could be classic Procol Harum with the great Hammond Organ/piano/guitar interplay and lyrics by Keith Reid. One of 2 new songs on an EP. Why these guys aren’t in the RNR Hall of Shame/Fame is criminal (not to mention Jethro Tull, Neil Sedaka, etc.).\n\n7.Cactus – Papa Was A Rolling Stone\n\nYour Dentist could hear this as Humble Pie if only Steve Marriott was around to sing it with to the harmonica and guitar interplay. As it is, this is a pretty hot cover of the old Temptations track from the otherwise so-so Tightrope album. Due to deaths and retirements the only original 1970 member is drummer Carmine Appice.\n\n8.John Ford – Another Tradition Broken\n\nEx-Strawbs bassist John Ford makes our list while the new so-so Strawbs CD Settlement doesn’t – shocking. Sounding more like pop-rock with an insistent riff than prog, this was far better than the rest of his new album Life In A Foreign Town.\n\n9.ABBA – Just A Notion\n\nWhile it is fantastic that 40 years after their last album we have new ABBA music with Voyage, it is way too laden with ballads for my taste. Guess they are allowed to mature, but I still want to rock. At least this old track with new instrumentation has some energy.\n\n10.Sheppard – Die Young\n\nThere wasn’t anything as good as “Geronimo” on their 3rd album Kaleidoscope Eyes however this Aussie band managed to have a small hit back home with this track. The lyrics are about the possible demise of the band when the singer had to undergo surgery, but it isn’t a stretch as your Dentist ages to feel a pang of mortality with “even if we die young, we’ve had a damn good run”.\n\n11.Toby Lee – Real Love\n\nEnglish guitarist was 16 when he recorded Aquarius, his debut album of blues-rock – amazing. The kid can play and shows that he will be a guitar talent as he ages and the rest of his music catches up to this fine riff-rocker.\n\n12.Billy Idol – Bitter Taste\n\nWilliam Broad is several decades removed from chart success, but your Dentist thinks this is one of his best songs. This reflective ballad from the EP The Roadside is about his 1990 motorcycle accident that almost cost him a leg.\n\n13.Dennis DeYoung – The Isle Of Misanthrope\n\nYour Dentist gave up on the prog-pop of Chicago’s Styx after 1978 as they became more pop than prog. On what is supposedly his swan song as a recording artist (26 East, Vol. 2), former lead singer DeYoung delivers one of his best progressive songs.\n\n14.Anette Olzon – Sad Lullaby\n\nSwede Olzon was the lead singer of Finnish prog-metal band Nightwish from 2007 to 2012. Her 2nd solo album Strong is way too metal for my taste. This powerful ballad is about the loss of her father last year to the viral pandemic.\n\n15.Aaron Lee Tasjan – Another Lonely Day\n\nThis could easily be Emitt Rhodes doing his imitation of a White Album era Paul McCartney acoustic guitar ballad he seemed to toss off with ease back in the day. Ohio raised singer/songwriter Tasjan has released a number of albums since 2008 with this track found on his decent Tasjan! Tasjan! Tasjan! CD.\n\n16.The Black Keys – Coal Black Maddie\n\nThe Black Keys doing an album of blues covers? Sign me up! Ah, but for some reason the album Delta Kream just sounds flat. This Ranie Burnette song is the only track that burns with some nasty blues fire. Time to bring back Danger Mouse to produce your music again!.\n\n17.Slothrust – Once More For The Ocean\n\nApparently this Boston trio pronounces their name as sloth rust. This track is from their 5th album Parallel Timeline. Singer Leah Wellbaum who wrote this song said: “This song felt like it was handed to me by the ocean. It came to me when I was sitting on some rocks and staring at one of my favorite oceans in the world, on Star Island off the coast of Rye, New Hampshire.”\n\n18.Ferocious Dog – 1914\n\nTheir new album The Hope could be categorized as Celtic punk. On this softer track singer Ken Bonsall tones down the growls and comes up with a winner of a wistful ballad.\n\n19.The Offspring – Let The Bad Times Roll\n\nSo-Cal pop-punk band The Offspring’s heyday was the ’90s (“Pretty Fly [For A White Guy]”). Their first album of new material since 2012 is Let The Bad Times Roll and came close to making our album list. As it is this track topped the U.S. mainstream rock chart.\n\n20.Geoff Palmer – The Apartment Song\n\nThis track suffers a bit from a singer with sorta thin vocals, but the pop-rock song reminds me of Nick Lowe and Rockpile. He is from Massachusetts and has been in the bands The Queers, The Nobodys and The Guts. His 1st solo album came out in 2010. This track is from the Charts & Graphs album.\n\nThe first piece of serious music your reviewer recall’s falling under the sway of was “March from Love Of Three Oranges” by Sergei Prokofiev after hearing it in Miss Buckley’s music appreciation class at Kohl School. Dad and especially mom loved orchestral music and show tunes and that was all the young me heard as a youth along with Lawrence Welk and his ilk. For a few years the folks even had season tickets to the now defunct Denver Symphony and occasionally your’s truly got to go. Exposure to the classics also came via movies having been taken to see Disney features like Fantasia (all Stokowski orchestrations with cartoons) and Sleeping Beauty whose run included the short film Grand Canyon featuring the music of Ferde Grofe (remember the sidewinder snake?). Any kid from back in the ’50s and ’60s watched cartoons on Saturday AM. All those old Looney Tunes features made use of the classics since royalties didn’t have to be paid for their use (who can forget such goodies as Rabbit Of Seville and What’s Opera, Doc?). It almost seemed pre-ordained that the high school and college aged me came to love progressive rock as there are classical overtones to much of that music. With that in mind it seemed like a fun topic to make a list of great rock and roll (or at least non-traditional instrumentation) songs that originated from classical sources. There are a lot of vocal rock songs that have used themes ‘borrowed’ from that music, but this is strictly a list of instrumentals (maybe we will do vocals another time). Some like my Uncle Bill will consider many of these to be desecrations of great music, but heck – it exposed many a kid to music they may not have heard and perhaps those kids later went out and bought the originals. Besides having to be an instrumental, the only rule here is only one song per act.\n\n1.Boycott’s Bouree – The Albion Band\n\nIt is tempting to say that “La Bourree” from Michael Praetorius’ compendium of baroque dance music Terpsichore is this blogger’s favorite piece of music as it so happy and memorable. Praetorius was mainly a composer of music based on hymns, but in 1612 he arranged and compiled over 300 mainly French dance tunes (though many originated elsewhere in Europe). ’60s kids remember it as the 355 year old instrumental break from the #11 hit by The Fifth Estate’s 1967 version of “Ding Dong! The Witch Is Dead” from The Wizard Of Oz. The most important figure in over 50 years of electrified British Traditional music has been Ashley Hutchings, the bassist who formed Fairport Convention, Steeleye Span and the band on this recording – The Albion Band. This song is found on the CD The BBC Sessions (Strange Fruit) with this performance from the 1977 edition of The Albion Band. Some of the players in addition to Hutchings were Phil Pickett (woodwinds), Ric Sanders (fiddle) and Dave Mattacks (drums).\n\n2.Love Sculpture – Farandole (from L ‘Arlesienne)\n\nThis is a virtual tie with The Albion Band track for #1 though it could well have been another piece by Dave Edmunds’ band – “Sabre Dance” instead of “Farandole”. Since we have to pick just one song by this trio, the incidental music written by Georges Bizet for a play by Alphonse Daudet gets the nod. After having a #5 hit with his great guitar instro version of “Sabre Dance” in the UK, Edmunds tried the same formula with “Farandole” which was released on the second and final Love Sculpture LP Forms & Feelings in Jan. 1970. Many are not aware of what a great guitarist Edmunds was in addition to his great retro-rockers like “I Hear You Knockin'” and “Girls Talk”.\n\n3.Apollo 100 – Joy\n\nJohann Sebastian Bach in 1723 composed this piece of music which has become a stately standard at weddings. As a joyous uptempo keyboard workout, the late Tom Parker released Bach’s song on the Mega label in early 1972 and scored a #6 hit in the US.\n\n4.Wolf Hoffmann – Swan Lake\n\nIt was the purchase of the 2016 album Headbangers Symphony that inspired this month’s blog posting. Wolf Hoffmann (the guitarist with German metal band Accept) released his first solo album in 1997 and it was appropriately titled Classical as it was all covers of songs like “The Moldau” and “Bolero”. Twenty years later, his second solo album followed the same path with metal versions of “Air On A G String”, “Pathetique”, etc. Tchaikovsky composed the music for this ballet in 1875-6 with the premier performance in 1877 to less than stellar reviews. Just like the Beatles’ Abbey Road which was panned by many reviewers upon release, “Swan Lake” is now considered a classic.\n\n5.Emerson, Lake & Palmer – Romeo & Juliet\n\nThe prog supergroup ELP recorded a number of fine classical covers including a full album dedicated to Mussorgsky’s Pictures At An Exhibition. “Romeo & Juliet” was found on their 1992 reunion record Black Moon after a fourteen year hiatus and was not a big success. This classical cover featured Keith Emerson playing the main motif on synthesizer. Composed in 1935 by Prokofiev, “Romeo & Juliet” was music for a ballet based on a Shakesperean play.\n\n6.Kokomo – Asia Minor\n\nThere was no band named Kokomo to support this #8 hit back in 1961, only studio musicians led by jazz pianist Jimmy Wisner. The pseudonym was supposed to hide his identity from his jazz fans, but after the records’ success Wisner went into rock and roll as a songwriter (“Don’t Throw Your Love Away” with Billy Jackson) and arranger (Len Barry, Tommy James, The Cowsills, etc.). The song is a honky-tonk piano version of the 24 year old Edvard Grieg’s 1868 composition “Piano Concerto In A Minor”. As we go through the list, it is interesting how 1961 seems to be the year of taking the classics and rocking them up.\n\n7.Jethro Tull – Bouree\n\nFound on the second Tull album Stand Up (1969), this is a jazzy version of J. S. Bach’s “Bourrée in E Minor”. The original was generally played on the lute, but band leader Ian Anderson used flute to follow the main theme. This has remained a standard in concert for Anderson and a fan favorite. Ostensibly Paul McCartney was also inspired by Bach’s tune in the composition of “Blackbird”. A bouree is a rapid dance with French origins first mentioned in 1655. When used in a classical context, a bouree is not necessarily meant to be danced.\n\n8.B. Bumble & The Stingers – Bumble Boogie\n\nHere we have another hit from 1961 by a band of session musicians. Producer Kim Fowley recorded Ernie Freeman on honky tonk piano with Earl Palmer (drums), Tommy Tedesco (guitar) and Red Callender (bass). The song had previously been a boogie woogie hit for The Freddy Martin Orchestra in 1946 with Jack Fina on piano and Fowley used a similar arrangement. On the Rendezvous label, the record hit a peak in the US of #21 which necessitated finding a band to tour as the fictitious B. Bumble & The Stingers. A white band from Oklahoma subbed for the mixed race studio players. The song itself was derived from “Flight Of The Bumblebee” composed in 1899-1900 by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov to close Act III, Tableau 1 of the opera The Tale of Tsar Saltan. B. Bumble had a hit with an adaptation of “The Nutcracker Suite” (Tchaikovsky) as well titled “Nut Rocker”.\n\n9.The Nice – Intermezzo: Karelia Suite (Live)\n\nBefore becoming a third of ELP, Keith Emerson was the flash keyboardist with The Nice which started as a quartet, but by this record was down to a trio. While there is a studio version of this song on their second LP, the preferable version to the young me was on the 1970 live record Five Bridges as it also featured an orchestra (Sinfonia Of London conducted by Joseph Eger). The noisy organ feedback section goes a bit too long, but when the full band comes back in at about the 7:43 mark it still brings goosebumps. Finnish composer Jean Sibelius wrote this in 1893.\n\n10.Trans-Siberian Orchestra – Mozart/Figaro\n\nFrom the 2000 rock opera Beethoven’s Last Night, this piece references the very popular overture from the comic opera “The Marriage Of Figaro” by Mozart (1786). The late Paul O’Neill created the band Trans-Siberian Orchestra in 1996 from the metal act Savatage as a marriage of rock and classical music. While their rock opera’s are not all holiday themed, the band has become a perennial Christmas season cash cow – a must-see like “The Nutcracker”. This particular work is a fictional account of the last night of Beethoven’s life when supposedly the devil comes to collect his soul (unsuccessfully).\n\n11.Paul Revere & The Raiders – Like, Long Hair\n\nThe first chart record by pianist Paul Revere’s Raiders sounded very different than their later garage rockers that enraptured the teenaged me back in 1965. Charting at #38 in 1961, this was a boogie woogie take-off on Sergei Rachmaninoff’s “Prelude In C Sharp Minor” (composed when he was 19). This rockin’ version doesn’t exactly follow the complete theme, but there is enough here to make the list. Rachmaninoff’s most famous piece was also sampled on the En Vogue modern R & B track “Love Won’t Take Me Out”.\n\n12.The Piltdown Men – Piltdown Rides Again\n\nOf course classical music lovers will know this piece as Gioachino Rossini’s “William Tell Overture”, but any kid from the ’50s will recognize another version of this song as the theme song to The Lone Ranger TV series (feel free to insert your own ‘Hi Ho Silver!’). The Piltdown Men were an American studio creation that were more successful in the UK with this record peaking there at #14 in 1961. While formed by pianist Lincoln Mayorga, The Piltdown Men had a lot of sax appeal due to the dominant dual honkers Scott Gordon and Jackie Kelso (other musicians were reportedly Bob Bain – guitar, Tommy Tedesco – bass, Alan Brenmanen – drums). Their only US charter was “Brontosaurus Stomp”. Trivia buffs may find interesting that the duo behind this combo (Ed Cobb and Lincoln Mayorga) were another studio act, The Link Eddy Combo whose instrumental rip-off of Ray Charles’ “What’d I Say” titled “Big Mr. C” was the first single released on Reprise records (1961).\n\n13.Waldo De Los Rios – Mozart Symphony No. 40 In G Minor K.550, 1st Movement\n\nA minor if unlikely #67 US hit from 1971 while singer/songwriters dominated the charts, this was a huge success in many countries for the Argentinian. The year before, he had arranged and conducted Miguel Rios’ #14 vocal hit “A Song Of Joy” based on Beethoven’s 9th. Any number of his pop arrangements of the classics could have made the list, but this is his most popular one. Sadly, De Los Rios suffered from depression and took his own life in 1977. Mozart wrote this in 1788 at age 32.\n\n14.Procol Harum – The Blue Danube\n\nJohann Strauss II composed this in 1866 as “An Der Schönen Blauen Donau, Op. 314”. Reportedly not a success at the time, this waltz is one of the best known pieces of classical music ever. Fans of Stanley Kubrick’s movie 2001: A Space Odyssey will remember this song from the space docking scene. Skaters of any age likely will have rolled or bladed around the rink to this song as well. Gary Brooker’s band Procol Harum may well have invented progressive rock (along with The Moody Blues) and are at this time one of the biggest omissions from the rock and roll hall of shame (er, fame). Procol Harum’s body of original work is revered by fans though most folk only know them from “A Whiter Shade Of Pale” and “Conquistador”. Their cover of Strauss ( well-played if a bit tongue-in-cheek) is a rarity first found only as the B-side on a 1976 French single with the A-side “Adagio Di Albinoni” which also could have made this list. Note that Strauss’ father was also a composer of mainly waltzes and is best known for “The Radetzky March”.\n\n15.Sky – Toccata\n\nThe first line-up of Sky was a very interesting amalgam. You had classical guitarist John Williams, prog-rock keyboardist Francis Monkman, session bassist Herbie Flowers, Aussie guitarist Kevin Peek and drummer Tristan Fry who had played timpani on “A Day In The Life” by The Beatles. Their 1980 double album Sky 2 was a #1 UK chart success and featured the single “Toccata” which was also a Brit hit at #5. This was an amped up version of the Bach organ show-piece “Toccata and Fugue In D Minor, BWV 565” (which your’s truly over-played in church back in the ’70s). While cut from the 1942 RKO general release of Disney’s Fantasia for time reasons (the film ran over two hours), Bach’s piece was restored for all future showings and accompanies a very abstract animation sequence.\n\n16.The Electric Light Orchestra – In The Hall Of The Mountain King\n\nELO was the 1970 brainchild of The Move – Roy Wood, Jeff Lynne with drummer Bev Bevan. Their original idea was to take the ‘rock-with-cellos’ idea of John Lennon’s “I Am The Walrus” further in a band context. By their 1973 release On The Third Day, Wood was long gone to Wizzard and Lynne was just finding has way to the arena rock band ELO would become. The only non-Lynne composition on the LP was an amalgam of two Grieg compositions. The song starts with a synthesizer playing the light “Morning Mood” which gives way to the ominous “In The Hall Of The Mountain King”. Both are from the incidental music composed by Grieg in 1875 for Henrik Ibsen’s play Peer Gynt (premiering in 1876). Many rock acts (including The Who and Nero & The Gladiators) have recorded this song.\n\n17.Yes – Cans & Brahms\n\nFound on many Yes fans’ fave album Fragile (1971), this is actually a Rick Wakeman solo piece. Wakeman combines several keyboards on a shortened adaptation of the “Symphony No. 4 In E Minor, 3rd Movement” by Johannes Brahms. German composer Brahms may be the fave composer of harried moms who have used his “Lullaby” to sooth their babies to sleep for years.\n\n18.The Chieftains – Chieftains Largo\n\nIn 1998 a largely unknown various artists album came out that was a tribute to the second movement of Antonín Dvořák’s New World Symphony, “Largo”. Rick Chertoff, Rob Hyman, Eric Bazilian (The Hooters) with David Forman were behind this sadly overlooked record that featured Taj Mahal, Levon Helm & Garth Hudson (The Band), Cyndi Lauper, etc. A tape of Dvorak’s piece literally went to the moon on the person of Apollo 11 commander Neil Armstrong. When he composed this symphony in 1893, Dvorak was under the sway of some of America’s earliest music forms – that of Native Americans and African slaves. The “Largo” section was given lyrics in 1922 by William Arms Fisher and is known also as “Goin’ Home” which is mistakenly thought of as a traditional folk song. On the album several artists give their reading of the main theme including the Irish traditional band The Chieftains who lend the Uilleann pipes of Paddy Moloney plus flute and tin whistle to their gentle interpretation.\n\n19.The Cougars – Saturday Night At The Duck Pond\n\nA UK hit in 1961 that didn’t chart in the US, this is a charged up version of the ballet “Swan Lake” again by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. The story is of Princess Odette who is turned to a swan by a sorcerer’s curse. Bristol, England’s The Cougars sound is very similar to the biggest UK instrumental act of all-time – The Shadows (who curiously never charted here either). The single may well have hit higher than #33 if it wouldn’t have been banned by the BBC. My Uncle Bill will relate to the reason for the ban – the powers that be claimed it was “a travesty of a major classical work”.\n\n20.Alan Parsons – The Sorcerer’s Apprentice\n\nThis is the newest performance on the list, appearing on the 2019 Alan Parsons album The Secret. The guitar is handled by prog virtuoso Steve Hackett late of Genesis. Both Parsons and Hackett put on wonderful performances on the 2019 On The Blue Cruise we were on board with, but curiously (in light of this collaboration) they didn’t appear together at any time. The album is a tribute to magic which is appropriate to this song if you remember the Mickey Mouse segment in Fantasia (likely the most beloved section of the movie). Paul Dukas wrote the symphonic poem in 1897 based on Goethe’s original poem of 1797. This song along with “Night On Bald Mountain” (Mussorgsky) has become associated with Halloween due to the evil sounding motifs.\n\n21.The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band – Opus 36, Clementi\n\nBy a wide margin, the best NGDB album was Uncle Charlie & His Dog Teddy which contains “Some Of Shelly’s Blues”, “House At Pooh Corners”, “Mr. Bojangles”, etc. (1970). Banjo virtuoso John McEuen solos on Muzio Clementi’s 1797 piece “Sonatina In C major, Op.36, No.1” which is commonly played on piano. Erik Satie parodied this song in his “Sonatine Bureaucratique” as well.\n\n22.The Ventures – Beethoven’s Sonata In C# Minor\n\nThe most prolific and influential US instrumental act has been the Ventures from the Pacific Northwest. During their main era of the ’60s and ’70s, they would take hits of the day and refashion them on LP with a mix of originals. Of their 60+ studio albums, 1972’s Joy included their cover of the Apollo 100 hit “Joy”. The rest of the record is classical melodies in a rock format including this song that sounds very similar in style to “Joy”. The original by Beethoven is a very sedate piano piece generally known as “The Moonlight Sonata” (“Piano Sonata No. 14 In C♯ Minor”). One of Ludwig Van Beethoven’s most popular works, he completed it in 1801 at age 31.\n\n23.Emerson, Lake & Powell – Mars, The Bringer Of War\n\nOkay, some of you may be crying foul as this is Keith Emerson’s third appearance on the list however this is a different band containing a different ‘P’ in Cozy Powell instead of Carl Palmer who was in the band Asia at the time. On their solitary self-titled album from 1986 they did a version of Gustav Holst’s “Mars, The Bringer Of War” which Dave Edmunds’ Love Sculpture had previously included on their Forms & Feelings record. Finished in 1916, Holst’s “The Planets” was made up of seven movements that were each named after a planet. A sort of evil bolero, stylistically it influenced many movie soundtrack composers including John Williams in Star Wars and Hans Zimmer in Gladiator. Manfred Mann’s Earth Band had a hit with “Joybringer” which was a vocal adaptation of another movement – “Jupiter, The Bringer Of Joy”.\n\n24.William Orbit – Barber’s Adagio For Strings (Ferry Corsten Remix -Radio Edit)\n\nThis is the only ‘modern music’ song on the list and is a Dec. 1999 #4 UK hit that was a dance remix of Orbit’s Samuel Barber II cover. It first appeared on his 1995 classical album Pieces In Modern Style (re-released in 2000). Ferry Costen who did the hit dance remix is a Dutch DJ. William Orbit (nee Wainwright) has been active since 1982 working with Madonna, Betty Boo, U2, Beth Orton, etc. “Adagio For Strings” was composed in 1936 as his “String Quartet, Op. 11 – 2nd Movement” and is Barber’s best known work.\n\n25.Adrian Kimberly – The Graduation Song…Pomp & Circumstance\n\nThe last alumnus from 1961 on our list is by the one-hit wonder Adrian Kimberly who was actually Don Everly of the Everly Brothers under an assumed name. The Everly Brothers switched labels from Cadence to Warner Brothers in 1960 and had their own short-lived Calliope Records label as a Warners subsidiary (1961-62). This was the only hit on Calliope out of five single releases at #34. Sir Edward Elgar’s Pomp and Circumstance Military Marches was composed in 1901. The best known of the marches is “Pomp And Circumstance March No. 1 In D” which contains several sections including the tune known as “Land Of Hope And Glory” (part of “Trio”) which was used in the UK as the “Coronation Ode” for King Edward VII. As Mrs. RNR Dentist and I observed while attending an organ concert at London’s Royal Albert Hall, the Brits boisterously sing along to this song with words we Yanks didn’t know even existed. Here in the US, this tune is played ad nauseum at every high school and college graduation, it seems. The Kimberly version was arranged by Neil Hefti who many will recall as writing the TV theme for the ’60s version of Batman.\n\nWhy 14 1/2 minutes you say? Turns out the Jimi Hendrix track included is a few ticks shy of the original 15 minutes your blogger intended hence the missing 30 seconds. Anyway, this felt at first like a topic that would be tough to fill up, yet as the list grew there were many worthy long songs that had to hit the cutting room floor. What originally got this going was the thought that in this ’30 second clip’ era, a song has to grab you quickly or else you move on without downloading it. That led to the idea of how many great songs could be overlooked if the sample is of the wrong section of the song for immediate gratification. The preponderance of these songs is from the genre progressive-rock which generally lends itself more to lengthy tunes since they are less inclined to need a quick hook for maximum chart action and radio play. In the days of underground radio, a song like this could be useful to a DJ for a bathroom break, a ‘funny-cigarette’ interlude or even a few moments with a Biologically accommodating fan. Lest you get irate at the placement of certain songs or omission of your personal faves, please understand that this is not a list of the best long songs – these are my own faves. Feel free to send a comment with your own faves, but understand that after #1 the order is fluid. Sadly, you will likely not have the time to spend the hours needed to listen to each from beginning to end, but if you find even one song that piques your interest then this posting was worthwhile. Grab yourself a beverage and some carbs and dig in!\n\n1.Procol Harum – In Held Twas In I\n\nInclusion in the rock and roll hall of shame-(er)-fame should be open to acts that created and defined new genres of music – pushing boundaries. For that reason, Procol Harum (a band that helped move psychedelia into prog-rock) should be enshrined – they are not. This track was side two of the 2nd LP by Procol named after their excellent 1968 single “Shine On Brightly”. The odd title comes from joining together the first word to each section of the 17 1/2 minute song. The lyrics are by Keith Reid while the music is from pianist/singer Gary Brooker and organist/singer Matthew Fisher. Robin Trower was the guitarist, David Knights the bassist and the late/great B.J. Wilson was on drums (practically defining what progressive drumming would become going forward). The payoff for me is when the beautiful choral theme is suddenly rocked asunder by Trower’s nasty guitar lead over Fisher’s powerful Hammond chords 15 1/2 minutes in only to have the choir regain the theme later with Brooker’s piano runs. The whole band brings things to a thundering conclusion – Goosebump time. Four years later a new lineup of the band revisited the song with strings on their excellent album Live With The Edmonton Symphony Orchestra.\n\n2.Pink Floyd – Atom Heart Mother\n\nThis, the fifth Pink Floyd studio album (1972) featured this nearly 24 minute song on side one. For many fans of the Floyd this is a controversial track due to the heavy orchestrations by Ron Geesin who earned a co-writing credit with the band. A large stretch of the song’s first third has a wordless choir singing over Rick Wright’s organ chords till the middle of the song. Later the music gets decidedly spacey a la the album that preceded this one – the excellent Ummagumma. As the song is wordless, a title was reportedly difficult for the band till they saw an article in the paper about a woman getting a nuclear-powered pacemaker. The ever dour and contentious band members David Gilmour and Roger Waters don’t seem to hold this work in much regard – something at odds with this reviewer’s opinion. The Hipgnosis cover art didn’t feature the name of the album or the band. Why the cow? Could be a joke – who knows.\n\n3.Rare Bird – Flight\n\nGraham Field was a brilliant classical organ player featured in the two keyboard, bass and drum English band Rare Bird who put out a couple of excellent prog albums before Graham left to form Fields. That he was the driving force is rather obvious when you listen to the band’s pedestrian albums after he flew the coop. David Kaffinetti on electric piano was quite good as well and later was the spacey keyboard man in the movie This Is Spinal Tap. From their first album, “Sympathy” was a worldwide hit (except in the U.S.), but it is their 2nd LP As Your Mind Flies By (1970) that features the side-long track “Flight”. Bassist Steve Gould sang and could get overly dramatic at times while drummer Mark Ashton was on backing vocals. Curiously, just as Procol Harum’s Shine On Brightly, the U.S. album covers where far better than the dull U.K covers.\n\n4.Iron Butterfly – In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida\n\nWell here is one that may cause some consternation amongst my prog rock brethren, but so be it. This was classically stoopid rock and roll that in 1968 was what this kid was listening to – and it still sounds great. Supposedly a tipsy Doug Ingle (keyboards/vocals) was writing a song with the lyrics “in the garden of Eden” but they came out slurred. The rest of the band liked the confused lyric and thus a heavy and dopey psychedelic gem was born. The beginning and end were joined on single with the middle lopped off, but you really need to hear the whole 17 minutes to appreciate the greatness. Most of the song is taken with with the band jamming on the main riff. At about 6 1/2 minutes there is a phase-shifted drum solo and every kid in homeroom used to tap their desks with their pencils in tribute to Ron Bushy’s skins-work (no doubt driving teachers insane). Curiously, Iron Butterfly never really came close to another song as great as this. On the Atco label for those that care.\n\n5.Pink Floyd – Echoes\n\nThe sixth Pink Floyd album, Meddle (1971), yielded this 23 1/2 minute masterpiece. You could easily move this to #2 and “Atom Heart Mother” down to #5, but either way the Floyd created two of the greatest long songs in musical history. This is a Halloween classic around our Parker abode – truly spooky sounding stuff especially 11 minutes in. It is said that what first inspired the song was the heavily Leslied piano ‘ping’ created by Rick Wright that opens the track. David Gilmour plays some screaming guitar leads that sound just as good in person (having seen them with my buddy Dan at DU just before the release of Dark Side Of The Moon – the album that ruined them for me). They also do a great version on the Live At Pompeii video. This song would have fit in well when Nick Mason’s Saucerful of Secrets played the Paramount earlier this year, but they didn’t do it (amazing show – thanks Paul!). Perhaps if they tour again…? By the way, the Hipgnosis cover art again doesn’t feature the name of the band or the album and is a close-up of an underwater ear.\n\n6.Focus – Eruption\n\nIf you ask the average U.S. record buyer the only song they know by Focus, they would say “Hocus Pocus” which is a pity as that silly novelty riff-rocker has nothing to do with the great prog instrumentals the true fans know them for. Their 2nd album Moving Waves (1971) did indeed contain that dopey #9 hit (1973), but the rest of the album is excellent prog including this 23 minute track on side two. Thijs Van Leer (flute/keyboards) and Jan Akkerman (guitar) were the creative soul of the band (Van Leer still fronts a version of this Dutch group).\n\n7.Jethro Tull – Thick As A Brick\n\nTo reiterate a point (if the morons who vote for the r & r hall are reading): inclusion should be open to acts that created and defined new genres of music – pushing boundaries. When you think of rock and roll bands that played literate music, put out classic album after classic album and made playing the flute cool you immediately think of Jethro Tull. Perhaps the voters don’t like leader Ian Anderson’s superior attitude or perhaps they would just rather vote for the rap-artist flavor of the month to sell tickets – too bad. Well they did induct The Moody Blues and Yes so perhaps there is hope. This was the followup to Aqualung and was ostensibly Anderson’s spoof of the idea of a concept album and was a single nearly 44 minute song split between sides A & B. The cover was a pastiche of a local newspaper and shows one Gerald Bostock who supposedly composed the poem this 1972 LP was based on (nonsense of course). The album hit #1 on the U.S. charts. John Evan contributes notable keyboard work that meshed well with guitarist Martin Barre and flautist Anderson.\n\n8.Savoy Brown – Savoy Brown Boogie\n\nProving that not all cool long songs have to be progressive, this live medley filled the whole of side two on the 4th album of blues/rock by a band still on tour under the leadership of Kim Simmonds (though he really needs a better singer than himself). In 1969 bands like Savoy Brown, Fleetwood Mac, Cream, 10 Years After, Chicken Shack, etc. were introducing black blues to young white kids like my buddy Dan. DC was kind enough to play this for yours truly (no doubt while we were drinking Bubble-Up and eating Yellow Zingers snack cakes) and got the young me hooked. This song was a medley of goodies like “Feel So Good” and “Purple Haze” recorded live in London. Guitarist Simmonds is the only constant in the band over the years with this version being perhaps the best. The rest of the act were Chris Youlden (vocals), Bob Hall (piano), Roger Earl (drums), Lonesome Dave Peverett (guitar/vocals) and Tony Stevens (bass). After two more albums, those last three split off to form Foghat.\n\n9.The Jimi Hendrix Experience – Voodoo Chile\n\nThis nearly 15 minute track closes side two of the 3rd Hendrix album Electric Ladyland (1968). It is basically an in-studio blues jam with Hendrix, drummer Mitch Mitchell, organist Steve Winwood of Traffic and bassist Jack Casady of the Jefferson Airplane. Do not confuse this track with the heavier and more well-known “Voodoo Child (Slight Return)” which closes that classic album. This track doesn’t seem to be on youtube but then we all own the album anyway – right?\n\n10.King Crimson – Lizard\n\nAt the tail end of 1970 a third King Crimson album (Lizard) appeared sans the excellent vocalist Greg Lake who was now in Emerson, Lake & Palmer. Vocals were instead handled by Gordon Haskell with an assist on this track from Yes front-man Jon Anderson. Side two was one 23 1/2 minute song broken into four parts. For some reason, youtube doesn’t have the full song in one piece so here presented is the intro section. Robert Fripp supplies guitar, mellotron and music while Pete Sinfield composed the lyrics. The rest of the band was Andy McCulloch (who would play drums next in Fields with Graham Field), Mel Collins (sax/flute) and others including Keith Tippett on piano. Truthfully due to the absence of Lake and the jazzier nature of some of the music, it isn’t as good as the first two Crimson albums.\n\n11.Arlo Guthrie – Alice’s Restaurant (Massacree)\n\n1967 was known as the year of psychedelia and the summer of love. 1967 also saw the debut album from Woody Guthrie’s son Arlo. The reason we bought the record at the time was due to this 18 1/2 minute live-in-front-of-studio-audience rap about getting arrested for illegally dumping trash and avoiding getting drafted into the Army. The song was enough of a sensation that it was made into an Arthur Penn movie a couple of years later. While Arlo is still going today, this continues to be his best-loved song. The main folk-song riff is played over and over again on acoustic guitar with uncredited accompaniment.\n\n12.Kraftwerk – Autobahn\n\nIn time for my birthday in 1974, this very mind-numbing track was the title centerpiece of the 4th Kraftwerk album (their first in the U.S.?). The simple German lyrics along with the general feel are meant to evoke driving on the super-highway – the Autobahn. The song has a gently catchy melody and an edit became an unexpected hit at #25 in the U.S. charts. Engineer Conny Plank gave the electronic music a great headphone mix. This album can be seen as the progenitor of synth-pop or even ambient music.\n\n13.Emerson, Lake & Palmer – Tarkus\n\nThis is the song that nearly broke up the progressive rock super-group after only one album. It is said that singer/bassist Lake didn’t like the music keyboardist Emerson was creating for their 2nd album and nearly left (the other member was drummer Carl Palmer). After a reconciliation that saw Lake contribute some parts of the 20 1/2 minute song, the album was deemed a failure by some critics and a #1 U.K./#9 U.S. success on the charts. Emerson’s Hammond organ dominates instrumentally.\n\n14.Renaissance – Song Of Scheherazade\n\nSong of Scheherazade is a 1947 movie while Rimsky-Korsakov composed a piece of music titled “Scheherazade”. Supposedly this 24 1/2 minute masterwork has nothing to do with any of those, so let’s start over. Scheherazade And Other Stories (1975) was the 6th and best album by the more acoustic prog band Renaissance that had been formed from the roots of the blues/rock band The Yardbirds. The soul of that original band was singer Keith Relf and his sister Jane. After Keith was electrocuted and Jane left to form Illusion, the mantle was passed to Annie Haslam and the late Michael Dunford (guitars). The orchestrations by Tony Cox are glorious and are as much a part of the band as Haslam, Dunford, Jon Camp (bass), John Tout (keys) and Terence Sullivan (drums). No cows or ears this time for Hipgnosis on creating the album cover.\n\n15.Deep Purple – Concerto For Group & Orchestra\n\nWhen fans think of Deep Purple they likely think of “Smoke On The Water”, “Perfect Strangers” or even “Hush”. Certainly the band are known for their hard rock interplay between the late Jon Lord on organ and Ritchie Blackmore on guitar with the powerful tenor of Ian Gillan on top. Oddly, however, the first album Gillan appeared as lead singer on for Purple was a live record made up of the mostly Lord composed “Concerto For Group & Orchestra” (song lyrics by Gillan). The album was recorded with The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Malcolm Arnold and juxtaposed the hard rock band with the strings playing a classical style. This, their 4th album, was also the first with bassist Roger Glover. Drummer Ian Paice remained from the original band along with Lord and Blackmore. As Blackmore wanted to play rock and roll, he was pleased when it didn’t chart here or in the U.K. – my friend DC was the one who played this for me originally.\n\n16.Jethro Tull – A Passion Play\n\nAfter the success of Thick As A Brick, Jethro Tull repeated the one-song-over-two-sides idea with their next album – 1973’s A Passion Play. Yes it isn’t as catchy as the predecessor, but it is still good. Critics hated it yet it again went to #1 in the charts. These two albums are Tull’s most progressive. The story seems to be about the death of one Ronnie Pilgram, his journey through Heaven and Hell and perhaps his rebirth. The only part not solely composed by Ian Anderson is “The Story of the Hare Who Lost His Spectacles” (Anderson, Jeffrey Hammond, John Evan). An edit managed a #80 placement on the U.S. singles chart.\n\n17.Emerson, Lake & Palmer – Karn Evil 9\n\nBrain Salad Surgery was the 1973 3rd album by Keith Emerson, Greg Lake and Carl Palmer charting at #2 in the U.K. and #11 in the U.S.. At just under a half an hour, “Karn Evil 9” is ELP’s longest song. Emerson composed the music while Lake and former King Crimson lyricist Pete Sinfield contributed the words. At 8:42 you hear the line that is most associated with the band, “welcome back, my friends to the show that never ends”. The story may be about the decay of humanity and how computers take over (this before anyone even thought of PC’s and the like).\n\n18.Genesis – Supper’s Ready\n\nOnce again I can thank my buddy DC for exposing the younger me to a great band, Genesis. Foxtrot was the 1972 followup to the previous year’s superior Nursery Cryme that was Genesis’ first with drummer Phil Collins and guitarist Steve Hackett. Bassist Mike Rutherford, keyboardist Tony Banks and singer/flautist Peter Gabriel rounded out the band on this their 4th album. While this 23 minute song is a group composition, Gabriel is generally given lyrical credit. Many consider this to be the best song by the progressive version of Genesis (not so this reviewer). Interestingly on “Los Endos” from A Trick Of The Tail (after Gabriel had departed), there are references to this song. On the wonderful musical cruise undertaken by Mrs. RnRDentist and myself (On The Blue 2019), Steve Hackett’s band performed a fantastic version of this song (the only former Genesis member not to abandon us prog fans – thanks Steve!).\n\n19.Yes – Close To The Edge\n\nThe sound you hear is that of prog fans everywhere screaming at their computers that this should be #1 (as the 1972 LP of that name was voted by fans a few years back in a Prog Magazine poll). Parts of this song are excellent and a case could be made that if one could lop off the first three minutes it would come in much higher (definitely if the last 10 minutes were a free standing song I would like it even better). When Rick Wakeman’s church organ comes it just after the 12 minute mark – oh my, that is glorious – so okay maybe it deserves to be higher on the list. Placement be darned, it at least made our top 20. This song wass composed by singer Jon Anderson and guitarist Steve Howe. Bassist Chris Squire and drummer Bill Bruford round out the band (this was Bruford’s swan song before joining King Crimson). Anderson says the lyrics are inspired by Hermann Hesse’s book Siddhartha. The album charted #3 in the U.S. and #4 in the U.K. also containing the song “And You And I”.\n\n20.Mike Oldfield – Tubular Bells\n\nHearing just a few seconds of a song can evoke a movie instantly. If you were of a certain age in 1973, all you need to hear are the first snippets of this song and you picture Linda Blair floating above her bed with green pea-soup spewing from her lips in The Exorcist. This was the debut album for multi-instrumentalist Mike Oldfield and was a worldwide phenomenon (especially in the U.K. were it was the 3rd biggest selling album for the entire decade of the ’70s). The song was comprised of two separate pieces of music on each side of the vinyl album. Side one is the part we remember from the movie and from an edit done by his U.S. record distributor (Atlantic) that reached #7 in our charts (though not approved by the artist). This was the first release on Richard Branson’s Virgin label.\n\nHere in the mile high environs, many of the older music acts simply can’t afford to stop on a tour as we are so far away from all the other large cities bands tend to frequent. Looking online to see if any likely musical suspects were coming to the Denver area, two patterns emerged: 1.nobody was coming to Colorado other than the high ticket acts like Elton John, and 2.many of the bands I love were all going to be in one place from February 10 – 15 – the On The Blue Cruise originating in Miami. Mrs. Dentist loves to travel while your intrepid reporter would rather stay in the comforts of home, but the line-up of acts was simply too amazing to pass up the opportunity. Steve Hackett, Procol Harum, Poco, The Orchestra (ELO covers), Alan Parsons, The Zombies/Colin Blunstone, Strawbs, Rick Derringer, Todd Rundgren, Dave Mason, Vanilla Fudge, David Pack/Wally Palmer/John Elefante (Ambrosia/The Romantics/Styx), etc. with the host being Justin Hayward of the Moody Blues – a mind-boggling group of acts in one place. On a last minute whim, a few thousand greenbacks were sent by the miracle of online transfer and we were set to spend a few days in Miami Beach then sail away on a classic/prog-rock floating Woodstock aboard the Royal Caribbean ship the Mariner Of The Seas.\n\nGetting to DIA proved to be a challenge as it was -10 with the roads being a sheet of ice, but we made it and sat on an American Airlines plane for 4 hours or so then took the shuttle to the Ocean Reef Suites at 1130 Collins in Miami Beach. Walking the Art Deco restaurants and clubs next to the beach was a sensory bombardment (especially at night). We had to try a Cuban sandwich and grab a stroll on the sand.\n\nBeing Uber virgins, we paid extra due to a mistake we made but finally figured out how to venture forth riding with strangers (speaking Spanish mainly) to shop for 45s (didn’t buy anything) and see the wall art of Wynwood Walls.\n\nWe took day trips to the Everglades (about an hour south) and Key West (about four hours south). The Miami Tour Company bus came by and picked us up at our hotel just as they said they would (thankfully). Mrs. Dentist loved the huge shrimp and conch.\n\nCruise day dawned and we did the Uber thing to the dock dressed in our finest rock frocks. The opening picture of this blog was posted on their Facebook page (my sister Cheryl shared this with me as I am not a member of that group) and I must say that our clothing was the hit of the cruise – Mrs. Dentist worked for hours on the great one-of-a-kind rock and roll coat and more than one artist on-board asked about purchasing it (not for sale, sorry).\n\nWe found our way to the lunch buffet (the food was decent till the last day when it was outstanding) and then retired to our tight but adequate stateroom 7435. The huge bed took up most of the room along with a small couch and a chair plus a tv that never worked (but we were way to busy to watch the tube anyway). The bathroom was utilitarian, but fine however the tightness of the shower meant that you had to watch dropping the soap or else do some shimmying to retrieve it. The schedule of concerts was pretty daunting as each day was crammed to the hilt starting as early as 10 AM and ending as late as midnight or so, but they did supply a list every day of all the shows and where they were located. Some acts performed as many as three times in open seating venues such as Studio B, the Star Lounge and by the pool while others only did one show in the huge Royal Theater with assigned seating. Those who paid extra for VIP status were seated first then us riffraff were allowed access. To help figure out when and were we wanted to be, your’s truly made up a flow-chart which was invaluable as we raced from place to place. Everything started late as they were waiting for stragglers, but finally Justin Hayward appeared on the pool stage with his family to wave and welcome all only then to disappear completely for the whole cruise except for the final night concert we were assigned to (there were red and blue groups you were assigned to). That was a major disappointment frankly as many of the artists were wandering the decks throughout the cruise and often were available for a chat or at least a quick “you were great at your show” – not Mr. Hayward even though he was our host! Randy Hansen did a credible if incredibly loud Hendrix tribute by the pool and then we attended one of the best shows of the whole five days – Steve Hackett, the amazing ex-Genesis guitarist who stayed true to progressive music and left that band when they went pop. Mrs. Dentist isn’t a typical prog fan, but thought his show to be outstanding with amazing laser lights and musicianship on songs like “The Musical Box”, “Dance On A Volcano” and “Supper’s Ready”. The other shows of the day for us were Dave Mason in Studio B and a late night Pink Floyd tribute from The Machine which was by the pool and also so loud as to be painful (but had some nifty lasers).\n\nDay two was a pretty hectic affair with the morning taken up with on-shore activities in Nassau, The Bahamas. You could go to the island that housed the Atlantis resort but we chose to look for historic structures in the town then took a cruise to see fish, etc.\n\nThe music part of the day was crammed full with an Al Stewart show, Procol Harum and Strawbs Q & A’s, the first of three shows we would attend by the Orchestra who do a wonderful ELO tribute (the other favorite act of Mrs. Dentist), Alan Parsons’ first of two shows, Todd Rundgren overly loud again by the pool, The Young Dubliners and David Pack’s Legends Live in their first of several shows. The Alan Parsons show was wild with all the lasers and great musicianship, but to call him a singer is a stretch yet he tries to sing some of the leads originated by the late co-Project founder Eric Woolfson. The Orchestra can lay claim to the ELO franchise even without Jeff Lynne as they feature some former members plus some other fine players like Glen Burtnik of Styx and Eric Troyer who worked with John Lennon among others. David Pack was the lead singer of Ambrosia (“Biggest Part Of Me”) and his band included Wally Palmer of The Romantics (“What I Like About You”) and John Elefante a singer in the group Kansas (plus powerful drummer Kenny Aronoff who wanted no part of giving your Dentist an autograph – the only uncomfortable moment of the cruise). The Strawbs are one of the best prog bands ever and frankly a fine bunch of guys to boot – young keyboard player Dave Bainbridge plus stalwarts Chas Cronk, Tony Fernandez (very nice guys to talk with) and the Dave’s – Lambert and Cousins. Talking to them was like talking to the Beatles for this writer. Alan Parsons was awarded a Grammy that day so was honored on board plus guested with David Pack as he had produced records for Ambrosia.\n\nTuesday we were at sea and decided to skip the Zombies Q & A to attend birthday boy Steve Hackett’s autographing of his new album At The Edge Of Light (and anything else you had, frankly). That was a brilliant stroke that oddly no other act took advantage of. Having an autograph session with copies of albums for sale meant more money for Hackett and other acts should have done the same as you have to figure they would have sold multiple CDs (the cruise merchandise table had t-shirts and music for sale but they were not autographed). We then hustled up from the Star Lounge to the upper deck Viking Crown Lounge (overlooking the pool stage) to experience a rare and unexpected treat – a live painting session with album cover artist Roger Dean (Yes, Asia, Gun, Osibisa, Gentle Giant, etc.). For $99 we purchased a limited edition signed exclusive cruise print – a very cool work of art. Former Colorado good guy Rusty Young of Poco did a Q & A as did Alan Parsons then we went to our first photo experience where a very long line awaited D. Pack Legends, Procol Harum, The Orchestra & Wishbone Ash. After the VIP’s entered, we were brought in to the room in waves of twenty then a photo was taken of each of us with the different acts. Frankly we still don’t have a clue how we will get to see those pictures but we are hopeful it will happen. We then crammed in Rick Derringer of the McCoys (on the painfully loud pool stage), Stephen Bishop (the folk singer in Animal House), Strawbs and the Zombies. Luckily they had late night eats from 11 PM to 3 in the morning as eating dinner didn’t fit that crazy day. Before you entered the Windjammer Buffet, there were many handwash outlets plus hand sanitizer stations (also spread throughout the ship to prevent illness). The Zombies were wonderful and for the last song “She’s Not There” they included all four living original members. We were given glow sticks to wave during the Argent hit “Hold Your Head Up”. Special mention needs to be made of The Strawbs as they were at the pool stage which actually sounded incredible for them with loud mellotron/guitar on songs like “Down By The Sea” and “Autumn”. They were troupers in the face of gale force winds which made for very dramatic pictures as their hair was whipping behind them but probably felt awful.\n\nDay four had us at the private island of Labadee (Haiti) for a cruise along the shore (seeing the village and fishermen with lobsters) and a beach stroll, but prior to that we attended a Todd Rundren Q & A that was awful in that the interviewer didn’t ask any real music questions and didn’t allow the audience to participate (something that all the other Q & A sessions had done). At lunch we had a surprise moment with David Pack who has to have been the nicest celeb on the cruise – thanks, David! After returning to the boat, we enjoyed another photo experience with Alan Parsons, The Strawbs, The Zombies and Al Stewart. We attended yet another excellent Orchestra concert though they did the same songs (the other acts who did multiple concerts made changes to their sets). We saw Procol Harum by the pool which was again too loud and then Poco which was the most painfully loud of all the pool shows (even with earplugs, the bass was still uncomfortable). An extra add-on show was tacked on at 11:15 with an all-star band made up of players who had been on the Cruise To The Edge which ended prior to ours (featuring Yes, John Lodge and a host of young prog acts). The leader of that show was keyboard player Dave Kerzner whose New World (deluxe edition) was my top album a few years back (others were guitarist Fernando Perdomo and the McBroom sisters).\n\nThe final full day of the cruise was jammed with music but started as usual with us eating breakfast (no vacation is truly a vacation without a waffle after all) and doing at least two miles walking around the pool. The rest of the day saw us running around the ship starting with a 10 AM photo op with Dave Mason, Danny Seraphine’s CTA (a Chicago tribute we never had time to see), Poco and Randy Hansen. Next was a fun poolside Q and A with David Pack, Wally Palmer and John Elefante. We had a later photo op with The Young Dubliners, Steve Hackett (who comically said about our clothing that he felt under-dressed), Todd Rundgren with Utopia members and Rick Derringer (who talked to me about the 1965 Denver Freddie & The Dreamers, The Beau Brummels and The McCoys concert which was my first ever show). We caught Procol Harum in Studio B and frankly they benefited from much better sound than the pool gig and played a fabulous set with highlights “Grand Hotel”, “Whisky Train” (with hot guitar riffage from Geoff Whitehorn) and “Conquistador”. We managed to see half of the Colin Blunstone set where he combined Zombies hits with his own catalog including a rocked up version of “Say You Don’t Mind” and “Wonderful”. Oddly, the Strawbs in Studio B while good were not as hot as by the pool since the sound wasn’t as loud plus they lost a lot of their audience to competing shows (this cruise forced you have to make tough decisions on which shows to see and when to eat). We raced out to the main theater to see most of Alan Parsons’ set (“Don’t Answer Me”, “Time”, Breakdown”, “Sirius”, “Eye In The Sky”, etc.) which had a guest spot with Gary Brooker of Procol Harum singing “Limelight”. We again went to the pool stage which sounded better this time for the Orchestra and their third stab at playing the same set (but it was still a lot of fun getting to sing along to “Strange Magic”, “Mr. Blue Sky”, “Do Ya”, etc.). After an amazing dinner where all our good work at not overeating totally went out the window, we attended a very pretty but subdued Justin Hayward show which had at least one of us nodding off during the quiet songs like “The Actor” and “Are You Sitting Comfortably”. He seemed to labor over some of the vocals which has to be a concern going forward. Finally we managed to see a bit of Vanilla Fudge by the pool (again way too loud). They were extremely nice signing autographs and talking to fans.\n\nAll in all it was a blast to hear so much great music and to get to know some of the acts personally. I wish I had a handle on who could be approached for autographs as after the Aronoff debacle I tended to shy away from bothering these guys (there were obvious jerks on the boat too who pestered the artists to sign multiple items – those folk gave the rest of us a bad name). That being said, we got so many requests to have photos taken with us because of our clothing that you did tend to see how tiring it must be for these folk to constantly be bombarded with requests for personal time – we all have bad days, but these guys aren’t allowed that luxury which is too bad. I would recommend this sort of cruise wholeheartedly and would do it again as long as the the line-up was different enough to make it of interest. I don’t think a cruise with only a few entertainment opportunities would be something I would want to do however as it is obvious that you can get bored with too much downtime. It would be nice to also see one of these for British Invasion bands or something like that to appeal to us baby boomers who spend the money for these sorts of things. Thanks to all the artists and the hardworking staff for making this a memorable experience (we had a lot of fun talking to the great On The Blue security folk while waiting for events to happen as well). The last day we awoke at 5 to greet the Miami sunrise after breakfast then take our two mile hike before leaving the ship. For those who wonder, they assigned numbers to let you know when you would leave the ship (ours was an 8:10 exit) and then you go through customs (quick and painless) and grab your luggage to find a host of shuttles waiting to whisk you to the airport, etc. United Airlines did a fine job of getting us home to pick up an elated dog from his week at “camp”.\n\nThis is a continuation of my last post cataloging my fave progressive rock albums of all-time. If I can editorialize for a minute, you might do some cross-referencing of these artists with those currently in the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame. Pink Floyd and Genesis managed to sneak in, but where are the Moody Blues, Jethro Tull, Yes, Procol Harum to name a few – will they ever be elected? Don’t forget to read the first part for #50 – 26. Now on to #25 – 1:\n\n25.Emerson Lake & Palmer – Trilogy (1972)\n\nTheir first album likely would have been #51 on my list but this is the one that grabbed me the most with it’s faux Ravel (“Abaddon’s Bolero”) and the superb cover of Copland’s “Hoedown (taken from Rodeo)” on which Keith Emerson plays some manic organ.\n\n24.The Alan Parsons Project – Tales Of Mystery & Imagination – Edgar Allan Poe (1976/1987)\n\nThe first album from the collective helmed by producer Alan Parsons and Eric Woolfson (who never has gotten enough credit for his work). They would go on to have a strong career filled with radio-friendly hits, but at this point they were an unknown – a cast of players mostly from Ambrosia and Pilot with guest singers like John Miles (“[The System Of] Dr. Tarr & Professor Fether”). Terry Sylvester sings like an angel over a choir on “To One In Paradise” making you wish he would have taken the lead more in the Hollies more. The 1987 remix with Orson Welles spoken intros improves an already excellent album.\n\n23.King Crimson – In The Wake Of Poseidon (1970)\n\nCurrent criticism of this second KC album is that is follows a similar path to their first album. Well, frankly, that isn’t a bad thing as both albums are outstanding. After the first album, the band splintered and this record found Robert Fripp taking the reins from the departed Ian McDonald (who went on to early Foreigner). Even though he was out of the band and in ELP, Greg Lake guested on vocals except on “Cadence & Cascade”. The mellotron driven title track is the highlight for me as is the three part downright evil sounding “The Devil’s Triangle”.\n\n22.Blackfield – Blackfield (2005)\n\nSteven Wilson of Porcupine Tree and Aviv Geffen from Israel teamed up for an outstanding modern prog album. You hear hints of Pink Floyd and other touchstone bands but the music is catchy and original. Especially love the title track, “Scars” and “Pain” – all melancholy and midtempo.\n\n21.Genesis – Nursery Cryme (1971)\n\nMany early fans point to Foxtrot as their fave, but this is the one that still grabs me (thanks to my old pal and drummer Dan Campbell for turning me on to this album and so many others years ago!). “Seven Stones” is a pretty ballad but the closing “The Fountain Of Salmacis” is amazing with a story from mythology, great harmony vocals, ethereal keys and some excellent playing from new guys Steve Hackett (guitar) and a drummer we will hear from later named Phil Collins. The illustrated lyrics and a cover about a rather evil croquet game (after album track “The Musical Box”) were certainly eyecatching.\n\n20.Triumvirat – Spartacus (1975)\n\nKeyboardist Jurgen Fritz Germanically channels Keith Emerson (ELP) on this album with very catchy songs to boot. Have to wonder what the mouse in the lightbulb has to do with Spartacus – gotta figure a picture of battling Romans might have sold better. “The March To The Eternal City” sounds amazing on CD.\n\n19.The Moody Blues – In Search Of The Lost Chord (1968)\n\nThe second album from the Hayward/Lodge edition of the band found them more comfortable with their ability to act as a self-contained orchestra. Graeme Edge’s billowing blasting intro leads seamlessly to Lodge’s great single “Ride My See-Saw”. The album also features the Ray Thomas tribute to LSD guru Timothy Leary “Legend Of The Mind”. Side two includes Justin Hayward’s love song “The Actor” and Mike Pinder’s spacey “The Best Way To Travel” (listen with headphones on as the sounds swirl around your head). At this point we all started to believe they were tapping in to some great cosmic truths – of course they were only singers in a rock and roll band.\n\n18.Procol Harum – Shine On Brightly (1968)\n\nWhile there were some fine individual songs on the album (notably the title track with Robin Trower’s screaming riff and more baroque organ from Matthew Fisher), it was the long side two opus “In Held Twas In I” that made us all take notice (and still does). After Keith Reid’s lyrics intone that “life is like a bean stalk, isn’t it?”, the band crashes in and the mini-symphonia is on. This set the stage for many other bands to follow suit (this stretching lengths in the studio supposedly inspired Pete Townshend to move into his own rock opera with the Who). My vote is for the U.S. green cover over the awful U.K. version.\n\n17.Strawbs – Hero & Heroine (1974)\n\nFeaturing some of the best mellotron driven songs ever by a progressive band, what kept this album from topping this list was the horrid “Just Love” and Dave Cousins’ ill-conceived sexual lyrics at times. Too bad he didn’t write about cosmic themes instead of… well, you know. “Autumn” is simply glorious while the title track has the best use of mellotron as an aggressive lead instrument (played by John Hawken). Your’s truly managed to see them touring this album at Ebbets Field in Denver and sat so close to the stage that it was tough to keep one’s feet out of the back of the mellotron plus Cousins came by to say hi – cool.\n\n16.Pink Floyd – Atom Heart Mother (1970)\n\nFloyd fanatics are probably screaming at this being my fave album by them, but I love the side-long orchestrated title track (Ron Geesin gets alot of credit from me and blame by many fans). The shorter tracks are also some of my faves ever by them (“If” and especially Rick Wright’s “Summer ’68”).\n\n15.The Moody Blues – Days Of Future Passed (1967)\n\nWith this album and Procol Harum’s first, you have the beginning of prog rock – and what great albums to be the first of a genre. The story has been told that the record company wanted the Moody’s to record a demo of Dvorak’s New World Symphony however they were more ambitious and came up with an orchestrated (by Peter Knight) masterwork with the classic songs “Nights In White Satin” and “Tuesday Afternoon” as centerpieces. My pal DC thinks they still might have time to record Dvorak – wouldn’t that be cool?\n\n14.Family – Music In A Doll’s House (1968)\n\nFamily’s first album exists in a middle world betwixt psych and prog, but no matter the label it was a masterpiece of a debut produced by Traffic’s Dave Mason (and includes his song “Never Like This”). The production and engineering by Eddie Kramer and George Chiantz are mindblowing when heard in headphones with the lights down low. The side two suite of songs is especially disturbing with Rick Grech’s soaring violin powering “Peace Of Mind” which leads to “The Voyage” with Roger Chapman’s very strange voice to the fore over devilish sounds. That gives way to the gentle “The Breeze”. Great cover as well.\n\n13.Genesis – Wind & Wuthering (1976)\n\nThe second post-Gabriel album found a band secure that Phil Collins could carry the lead vocal load and wow were they tight as an instrumental act as can be heard on “Unquiet Slumbers For The Sleepers…” “…In That Quiet Earth” which leads to the powerful ending track “Afterglow”. They showed a gleam of their pop future on “Your Own Special Way” which would flower into huge success on Abacab and Invisible Touch. As a live band there was no better augmented by Chester Thompson (drums) and Daryl Stuermer (guitar) and an incredible laser light show (as captured on the live Seconds Out album) – my favorite alltime concert – Macky Auditorium in Boulder. Sadly, guitarist Steve Hackett then left the band and after one more prog-ish album Genesis went for pop stardom.\n\n12.Strawbs – Bursting At The Seams (1973)\n\nDave Cousins completed the transformation of Strawbs to an electric band with this album. The folkier Tony Hooper was out and rock guitarist Dave Lambert was in. Cousins came up with some wonderful music in “Flying” and the rocking “Lay Down” which pushed them in to the U.K. charts. The singalong “Part Of The Union” (a huge U.K. hit) showed where the Hudson Ford team was to head after this album when they left (putting out some fine albums on their own). The masterworks, though, are “Tears And Pavan” and especially the riff driven “Down By The Sea” with ethereal choral mellotron from Blue Weaver.\n\n11.Barclay James Harvest – Everyone Is Everybody Else (1974)\n\nA switch in labels to Polydor seemingly re-energized the band as they came up with one of their strongest albums featuring John Lees’ slap at violence “Child Of The Universe” and his anti-war “For No One” which demands the stereo to be cranked up a notch to better hear his searing lead over Woolly’s mellotron. Les Holroyd’s best here is “Crazy City” which sounds even better on their double live album of that era.\n\n10.The Moody Blues – A Question Of Balance (1970)\n\nIt’s hard to think of any more exciting intro to an album than “Question” with Justin Hayward’s furious acoustic guitar strums followed by an orchestral sounding blast of noise till the whole band kicks in – an acoustic cool-down in the middle then the same kick-in at the end. Up next Mike Pinder asks the cosmic question “How Is It (We Are Here)”. The rest of the album is good if not up to the intro, but what a fantastic cover painting by Phil Travers.\n\n9.Procol Harum – Home (1970)\n\nRobin Trower’s driving riff rocker “Whisky Train” opens the album but from there things get decidedly darker as most of Keith Reid’s lyrics seem to deal with death. You get the Gary Brooker ballad “The Dead Man’s Story” and Trower’s nastier guitar on “About To Die”. For this album Chris Copping plays more organ than he would on the next more rockin’ Broken Barricades album which manifests on “Piggy Pig Pig” (which would have been outstanding had they omitted the silly pig noises near the end). The track that stands out is “Whaling Stories” that starts as a simple blues till a couple minutes in when it starts turning darker and the bass and piano echo an ominous riff that Trower and drummer B J Wilson build upon with Brooker shouting out over intense sound till it releases and the amazing choral ending comes in.\n\n8.King Crimson – In The Court Of The Crimson King (1969)\n\nAnother touchstone in the growth of a style, this debut was unfortunately the only album released by this version of the band before Ian McDonald (keys) left and Greg Lake (vocals, bass) decamped to ELP (though he guested on the next album at least). Michael Giles’ drumming is outstanding and the guitar of Robert Fripp screams right from the opening “21st Century Schizoid Man”. Pete Sinfield supplied excellent lyrics for all 5 songs especially on the title track which features McDonald on mellotron and flute. The high point of the record for me was always “Epitaph”. Greg Lake may have been the best singer in progressive rock but let’s not forget he was a fine bassist as well.\n\n7.Rare Bird – As Your Mind Flies By (1970)\n\nCertainly an album not on too many top lists which is a pity as it was brilliant and a huge leap up from their first fine album. “I’m Thinking” starts with Graham Fields’ churchy organ playing a riff that the rest of the band picks up and embellishes on. Again the vocal from Steve Gould may be too powerful for some tastes but the music is baroque and lovely as on “Down On The Floor” plus you get a powerful nasty riff rocker in “Hammerhead”. Side two was taken up with the title track and honestly the music is amazing and could fit well with Pink Floyd’s Atom Heart Mother or Focus’ Moving Waves sidelong pieces. Again, double keyboards with David Kaffinetti on electric piano (later in Spinal Tap) along with Field. The U.S. album cover was far better than the dull U.K. one.\n\n6.Jethro Tull – Aqualung (1971)\n\nAfter several great bluesy/folky albums, Ian Anderson and company put it all together on this tour-de-force that he insisted wasn’t a concept album though the lyrics were disturbing and interesting (the title track about a homeless lecher and “My God” – a slap at organized religion – to name a couple). John Evan’s mellotron and Anderson’s flute intro to “Cross-Eyed Mary” is as prog as you can get till Martin Barre’s nasty guitar comes in to take it more mainstream. Check out the great riff of “Locomotive Breath” that follows a long bluesy workout. “Mother Goose” could be a track by fellow Chrysalis label Brit-folk band Steeleye Span. There would be far more Tull in this list as I love their music, but it simply doesn’t seem to work to call their other albums prog (A Passion Play might fit but how to categorize the rest? – that won’t stop me from recommending Stand Up, Benefit, Living In The Past, Songs From The Wood, etc).\n\n5.Procol Harum – Grand Hotel (1973)\n\nTheir first Chrysalis label album in the U.S. that delivered on all fronts – great music, fine cover and a booklet to boot. Having just tasted success with their live album (and a hit in “Conquistador”), they lost Dave Ball on guitar so Mick Grabham was an unknown. He more than filled the guitar vacancy (listen to “Bringing Home The Bacon” which has some fine B J Wilson drum/cowbell work). The lovely “Fires (Which Burnt Brightly)” has a very unique vocal from Christianne Legrand of the Swingle Singers singing a solo line as opposed to a duet with Gary Brooker. The title track is simply a masterpiece of band and producer meshing and has one of Brooker’s best vocals singing Keith Reid’s words over orchestra and chorus.\n\n4.Barclay James Harvest – Gone To Earth (1977)\n\nA great album from beginning (John Lees’ lovely “Hymn”) to end (Les Holroyd’s harmonious “Taking My Higher”). “Spirit On The Water” is an anti-fur song with a catchy riff while Woolly’s “Sea Of Tranquility” speaks to the futility of the space race. Lees could write a song with a powerful riff like “Leper’s Song” or the gentle “Love Is Like A Violin”. The high point of the album is “Poor Man’s Moody Blues” which is how many reviewers referred to BJH so Lees wrote the greatest mellotron Moody’s sound-alike ever. A gorgeous cover as well.\n\n3.Genesis – A Trick Of The Tail (1976)\n\nHard to explain what a pleasant shock it was to pick this first post-Peter Gabriel album up at the store and play it to find that if anything the band sounded better with the drummer singing – at the time we all felt he sorta sounded like Gabriel though of course now we know he just sounds like Phil Collins. There simply isn’t a weak cut here with excellent mellotron and guitar interplay. “Ripples” and “Entangled” are gentle ballads while “Dance On A Volcano” and “Squonk” show the old power they could summon. The title track showed a knack for a catchy song that would flower over the years. A nice cover and decent lyrics.\n\n2.Strawbs – Grave New World (1972)\n\nFor those of us who bought albums based on the cover, this one certainly pulled us in with a great logo atop a William Blake nude and, upon opening, another striking painting inside. A lavish book of lyrics was also included – it simply looked classy. From the opening “Benedictus” you were in the presence of greatness – a song I want played at my memorial service. Dave Cousins sings a litany from the I Ching (“bless the daytime, bless the night, bless the sun which gives us light”) over a dulcimer driven song (fuzz dulicimer? who knew you could do that) that gives way to some wonderful piano/mellotron work by new keyboard player Blue Weaver who made up for the loss of Rick Wakeman. The folkier Tony Hooper was still in the band so the sound was more acoustic than when Dave Lambert joined but the sound can still be nasty as on the acid attack at the departed Wakeman “Tomorrow”. John Ford’s “Heavy Disguise” and Hooper’s “Ah Me, Ah My” have some excellent horn work making the former sound baroque and the latter cartoonish. “New World” is amazing with dueling minor key acoustics washed with crashing mellotron cords with some excellent Cousins lyrics that he sings with increasing passion as the song progresses. The only misstep for me is Richard Hudson’s sitar song “Is It Today, Lord?” which wasn’t a bad song, but suffered from a poor choice of backing instrumentation. The gentle piano of “The Journey’s End” closes the album admirably.\n\n1.The Moody Blues – To Our Children’s Children’s Children (1969)\n\nNot only the best progressive album of all-time, but arguably my favorite album of any style ever. I have seen that the theme of the album w"
