        "text": "lifeblood: official: 2013-08-05: a year a month - a monthly blog from a and e - tumblr\n\n(click here for a color pdf showing how this page originally appeared on tumbler) (119mb)\n\nA Year A Month\n\nA monthly blog\n\nfrom A and E\n\nIG BIO\n\nAmy Ray and Emily Saliers are Indigo Girls. Rolling Stone describes them as the \"ideal duet partners. Their voices soar and swoop as one, alternately raucous and soothing. When they sing together, they radiate a sense of shared purpose that adds muscle to their lanky, deeply felt folk-tinged pop songs\". Together they write, arrange record and perform music which over the course of twenty-five years has become a vital part of the lives of their legion of devoted fans around the world, informing and rewarding them day to day.\n\nWith twelve original studio albums, three live records, various Greatest Hits compilations, a Rarities and a Christmas record to their credit, the iconic duo continues to challenge itself creatively, over and over again, adding to a body of work that contains such contemporary classic songs as Galileo, Shame on You, Closer To Fine, Kid Fears, Love of Our Lives, Making Promises, Get out the Map, Moment of Forgiveness, Least Complicated and Go. After numerous Grammy nominations and awards and gold and platinum certifications and decades of touring in clubs, arenas and everything in between, Indigo Girls remain active and relevant, always viewing their music as a fresh opportunity for exploration and discovery. \"We really work hard to not lean on any tried and true path in making our albums,\" says Ray. \"So when it comes to writing new songs and working and performing with different musicians, every record and every tour feels like a completely different adventure for us.\n\nAmy and Emily first met as fifth and sixth-graders in Decatur, Georgia and began singing together during high school. Originally billed as Saliers & Ray, the pair adopted the name Indigos Girls during their undergraduate days at Atlanta's Emory University. The Indigos were attending classes by day and performing as an acoustic duo in local clubs by night when they made their first stab at recording in 1985 with the single Crazy Game / Everybody's Waiting (for Someone to Come Home) which they issued on their own label, followed by an EP and in 1987, their first full length LP, Strange Fire, produced by John Keane.\n\nIn 1988, the big-time beckoned Indigo Girls. Signed to Epic Records and EMI Music, they recorded Indigo Girls with producer Scott Litt at Ocean Way Studios in L.A. With Amy and Emily on vocals and acoustic guitars, Indigo Girls featured contributions from REM, Hothouse Flowers and Luka Bloom. The record was released in 1989 (the Boston Globe stated \" The Indigo Girls have simply made the best debut album so far this year\") and the Indigo Girls began criss-crossing the country on tour ( a process that has continued without pause throughout their career) headlining or supporting the likes of REM, Neil Young and the Violent Femmes.\n\nDecades into their career, the Indigo Girls still amaze conventional pundits with their ability to grow and thrive no matter what the state of the music industry is at any given point. The duo's constant touring, as well as staunch dedication to a number of social and environmental causes, has earned them a fervidly devoted following over the years. So many artists who launched their careers in the late 1980s have slipped from our collective memory. In contrast, the Indigo Girls stand tall, having earned the lasting respect and devotion of a multi-generational audience, which continues to experience their creative evolution in the studio and on stage. The adventure may take the form of an adrenaline-fueled live CD or a warm reflective holiday album or a collection of songs that can veer from the raucous to intimate in the blink of an eye. No matter where their creative journey takes them, they hold out a hand to their listeners and we get to feel it all.\n\n**************************\n\n1981&nbsp&nbsp 1982&nbsp&nbsp 1983&nbsp&nbsp 1984&nbsp&nbsp 1985&nbsp&nbsp 1986&nbsp&nbsp 1987&nbsp&nbsp 1988&nbsp&nbsp 1989&nbsp&nbsp\n\n1990&nbsp&nbsp 1991&nbsp&nbsp 1992&nbsp&nbsp 1993&nbsp&nbsp 1994&nbsp&nbsp 1995&nbsp&nbsp 1996&nbsp&nbsp 1997&nbsp&nbsp 1998&nbsp&nbsp 1999&nbsp&nbsp\n\n2000&nbsp&nbsp 2001&nbsp&nbsp 2002&nbsp&nbsp 2003&nbsp&nbsp 2004&nbsp&nbsp 2005&nbsp&nbsp 2006&nbsp&nbsp 2007&nbsp&nbsp 2008&nbsp&nbsp 2009&nbsp&nbsp\n\n2010&nbsp&nbsp 2011&nbsp&nbsp 2012&nbsp&nbsp 2013&nbsp&nbsp 2014&nbsp&nbsp 2015&nbsp&nbsp 2016&nbsp&nbsp 2017&nbsp&nbsp 2018&nbsp&nbsp 2019&nbsp&nbsp\n\n2020&nbsp&nbsp 2021&nbsp&nbsp 2022&nbsp&nbsp\n\n**************************\n\n2009 entry posted 25 April 2021:\n\nE.S. 2009\n\nYou may know that itâs been some time since we wrote our last Tumblr blog for âOne Year a Monthâ. Itâs good to set goals (ha), and while we couldnât quite manage to keep writing every month about the next consecutive year in our career, it feels great to dust off the memories now and get back to work on catching you up to speed. I must admit, Iâm brushing through a few cobwebs as I reconnect with how to write a blog entry!\n\n2009- it was a chock-full year, practically bursting at the seams with travels near, far and wide. Knowing we had a little break before Poseidon and the Bitter Bug was going to be released, and Amy would be touring solo, I planned a trip to Southeast Asia in January with Tristin and two of our very favorite friends and travelling buddies, an Aussie couple named Pauline and Dave. During the three-week trip, we went to Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam. Having always had a fascination with the people, culture, and the American war in Vietnam, I felt honored and excited to be able to go there. I was particularly looking forward to experiencing non-Western culture, as I had never been so far away before to a non-English speaking country. In truth, I was slightly nervous. Among our myriad experiences were a visit to the prison where the late Sen. John McCain was held during the war, a flight north to Hanoi to see Ho Chi Minh lying in state, and on a swelteringly hot day, a âtourâ of some of the elaborate tunnel systems dug by North Vietnamese soldiers during the war. While we were there, we met many kind people, learned to cook traditional dishes from locals, roamed temples and back alleys, and were treated warmly by our hosts, but I felt a sense of sorrow and American guilt over that terrible war which never quite left me. I was, however, able to be amazed by and relish the awesome street food, the brilliant colors of all the items people carried on their scooters, things you would never imagine being loaded on to a scooter: trees, washing machines, stacked crates of food and beverages, celebratory items for Tet, and so on. It was terrifying crossing a major intersection in Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City- a combination of complete âZen flowâ and desperate prayer that if you just kept walking through the sea of bikes and cars and scooters and people, you would make it to the other side alive!\n\nWhile we were in Vietnam, we rented a boat and sailed on Halong Bay, where the rock outcroppings loom like mystical figures from a time long, long ago. We stopped to see a tiny village on the water with a one room schoolhouse and one dog on the docks. The water was very cold and stung my skin as we swam, but it was exhilarating, and I could not get over the vast beauty of Vietnam. I had only ever seen war footage of the Mekong river, so itâs hard to explain the power of hopping on a tour boat down the river, stopping at a village along the way to buy goods from the locals, and ending up exploring a cave at the end of the boat trip.\n\nThere are too many memories of that trip to share here, but I have included a couple of pictures- one is of me and Tristin, reading Vietnamese-authored books on a boat in Halong Bay; the other is me eating a bug during a traditional Lao meal we had in Luang Probang. That night I ate bug, fish gut, snake, frog, and bee larvae. These were local delicacies. My favorite were the plain noodles! It was a strange transition back to American life after that trip, but I felt I would one day return to Southeast Asia, and Amy and I had work to do!\n\nSo, why not play a Cayamo Cruise? Cruises are a slightly claustrophobic experience for me, but Cayamo and Olivia Cruises through the years have also been a ton of fun, particularly since we get to jam and sing with other musicians. During 2009, we spent a lot of time hanging out and singing with Brandi Carlile and the twins. Brandi, Amy and I would gather in one of the little ship cabins and rehearse songs, and when we did our IG set on the boat, most of the songs were sung with Brandi, singing harmonies and taking verses. Brandi can sing harmony perfectly with anyone, and she was like a harmonic glue with me and Amy. I spent those nights on the ship playing songs with my jaws aching from smiling so much because, really, what is better than singing songs with friends, and when the friend is Brandi, itâs a whole other musical dimension. Along with the music, the deep, deep blue of the deep, deep sea is my favorite living color, and I spent a lot of my time looking over the ship balcony, down to the swirling blue below, marveling at what the natural world shares with us.\n\nOut of nowhere came an opportunity to play our first show in Southeast Asia- a one-off in Singapore! Never before had we flown across the world to play one show! It was a fascinating place, this jam-packed city state. I remember that there were stores and stores and stores- so many shopping places I had never seen, and there were miles and miles of cutting-edge public transport trains. It was also an incredibly clean city. We had heard that chewing gum was against the law. Urban myth? Homosexuality (sodomy to be exact) is illegal in Singapore, an anti-gay law enacted by colonial England in the 1930âs. We interviewed with a queer journalist while there- I felt it was extremely brave of him to speak so freely, but there is a strange mix of extremely stringent rules and citizen conduct laws, coupled with an international cosmopolitan mix of people, and thriving arts, that reminded me of a âdonât ask donât tellâ environment. Singapore is largely a conservative country. The struggle for LGBTQ freedom continues there.\n\nFrom there, we went to Palm Springs, California to play the Dinah Shore weekend. Back in 2009, I was a womenâs golf FANATIC. My GF and I hung out with some women on the tour, and we went to Dinah Shore to follow the tournament as well play music. Hereâs the jewel of the crown- Lady Gaga was performing there as well! She would go on to become a stratospheric star (one of my very favorite artists), but in 2009 we shared the stage with her at Dinah Shore. I remember watching her from the side of the stage, even then with glitz and glimmer, and being captivated by her. There are some artists you see and you just know they will go on to bigger, broader audiences and fan followings. Itâs pretty fun to look back and remember when they played small venues and how we were there to see them and take in their gift before they became household names. Small venues are so great, because the music is so close- all those energy molecules packed in so tightly and swirling around.\n\nWe spent the rest of that year touring much of the U.S. from the Northwest, to California, the Southwest, Mid-west, Southeast and on up to New Hampshire and the Northeast. We decided to hold food drives during those concerts. People could bring food goods in for people and food goods in for pets. We knew that many people were experiencing food insecurity because of the 2008 economic crisis, and we worked with the group Rock for a Remedy who completely organized the drive and had volunteers in each city to collect the food and money and to let people know which groups, foodbanks or animal shelters for example, in their communities would receive the contributions.\n\nWhen we face a problem head on and share what we have, and we sometimes do that in the music arena, the result is a powerful sense of community, rather than isolation and personal struggle. Iâm so thankful to groups like Rock for a Remedy that have the organizational infrastructure to make these kinds of community efforts achievable. Someone carries the box of food out of the venue and gets it into the hands of someone who is hungry. There are always so many âinvisibleâ people behind the scenes doing the hard work of making the goal realized. It was true from the beginning and is still true that concerts that benefit people or animals or groups in need of assistance or amplification are the very best concert experiences Amy and I have. It is always our community of listeners who rises to the occasion and takes part!\n\nIn October we flew across the pond to tour the UK. Touring the UK is one of my favorite things to do as an IG. We were driven on a tour bus by the intrepid and always hilarious Johnny (the one of âOlympia Innâ). Itâs always creepy and exciting to have the bus drive onto the Ferry to get to Ireland. In the very old days, I would sleep on the bus while parked on the ferry-even though youâre not supposed to do that. Though it was dark, and you could feel the motion of the sea, hear the mechanical drone of the shipâs engines, and know that you were in a shipâs underbelly, inside a bus, I always opted for more sleep. Getting off the bus and onto the upper part of the ship cut into my sleep. I have never done well without proper sleep (8 hours at least), so the hardest part of touring for me has always been body fatigue. Once Iâm over the bad jet lag I always experience, Iâm exhilarated to be touring in a country outside the U.S. On that tour, we had Carolyn Snell for the first time as our tour manager. We met her when she was TM-ing Brandi. We have her to thank for all of the awesome pics she took on this UK tour. We went on to become lifelong friends, and she introduced us to Thistle Farms in Nashville, a nonprofit social enterprise dedicated to helping women survivors recover and heal from prostitution, trafficking, and addiction. Often, we meet friends along our travels who introduce us to organizations who address the most critical needs of the people or animals they serve- a completely organic journey into all of the issues Amy and I have been involved with over the many years.\n\nI got very sick on the UK tour. It feels awful to get sick on tour, an agonizing feeling not to be able to do my best during a show. Even though there is no blame for getting sick, I always feel like Iâm letting Amy or the audience down. Carolyn and I still laugh about me handing her my sweaty, gross stage shirt after a show when I was really sick. She said âewwwwâ, took it, and held it as far away from her on the hanger as she could. I guess her honesty solidified our nascent friendship! The other thing about getting sick on tour is that you never want anyone else to get sick. So, when we had Clare Kenny and Carol Isaacs come over from London to play with us, I tried so hard to keep my distance from them- even though I love them both with all of my heart and so rarely get to see them.\n\nI look back on that tour and all of the wonderfully crummy dressing rooms, lack of coffee, jacket potatoes from food stands, beautiful people, exuberant fans whose distinct accents you could hear as they sang the words, thrill of cultural change, and I think about being sick. Thatâs how bad it felt to me. Obviously, that is self-involved and way out of proportion, but there it is. Iâve learned to go a little easier on myself when I get sick now on tour, but it really sucks!\n\n2009 was the year we released Poseidon and the Bitter Bug whose name came from our very funny and gifted producer, Mitchell Froom. Heâs like, âjeez thereâs a lot of bummer stuff here (Iâm paraphrasing); you should call the album Poseidon and the Bitter Bugâ. We did. We decided to make PATBB a double album- one-part full band arrangements, another part all acoustic arrangements. These songs leant themselves quite well to the stripped-down versions. Alison Brown joined us to play banjo and âbanjolaâ on some of the acoustic versions. Her banjola solo on âIâll Changeâ is one of my favorite musical pieces on all of our albums combined. There was something about the poignancy of that song out of personal pain, along with Alisonâs sensibility, and the sound of that particular instrument that reached inside me and wouldnât let go. I often ponder about why certain chords or instruments resonate uniquely to different people. For instance, I absolutely love the sound of a drum sidestick on the snare pattern.\n\nI love the songs on Poseidon. âFleet of Hopeâ was the first song I wrote after a terrible, debilitating bout of writerâs block. âDigging for Your Dreamâ was the first song of mine we recorded to a loop that ran through the entire song. âIâll Changeâ is a ballad I never get tired of playing live (not all songs are like that). Amy wrote classics like âSecond Time Aroundâ, âSugar Tongueâ and âDriver Educationâ which she had also recorded as a solo song. One thing I loved about Mitchell Froomâs production is that no musical part is overdone, overplayed, or conflicts with other parts. Each part fits with and has its place in relation to the other parts. He is the king of simplicity and the perfect note, in my opinion. Besides that, he has a wonderful sense of humor and always kept things flowing in the studio- a sure and steady captain.\n\nSO- the end of a decade and the precipice of a new one. Traveling was the key- new people, new experiences, new challenges, new activist mentors and groups to get involved with. Every stop along the way was an adventure and a chance to reflect on the bountiful life that music has given me.\n\nA.R. 2009\n\n2009 started in an auspicious way with the inauguration of our first black president, a visionary man and a new hope for so many people. It ended with the death of the legendary Vic Chestnut, a songwriter for the ages, a poet with an impossibly real voice that hit our guts with images and stories that could encompass the world of the mundane as magically as he could bring forth in graphic realism the cycle of life and death. With these bookends of hope and loss, my experience of 2009 has reverberated and stayed with me in a visceral way.\n\nWe left our deal with Hollywood records after only one release, having discovered that a record label talking about elevating your career, does not make it so. We were happy to leave, but also grateful for the connection we had formed with Mitchell Froom as the producer of our Hollywood Recordsâ release, Despite Our Differences. It was not wasted time. We decided to launch our own label IG Recordings, which allowed us to be flexible and move around through different production, distribution and promotion scenarios as they fit out needs. When we left the deal, we had the next album set up to record with Mitchell, and because he âdidnât care if we were on a label or notâ we secured a loan and then proceeded as planned with practices and recording. Our label was launched in January, and our new release Poseidon and the Bitter Bug hit the streets in March. Before the Indigo release, I spent some solo time on the road, in between various Indigo runs, my rock band and I, loaded the trailer, piled into the van and worked to cover as much of the U.S. as we could. This was my last stint of touring for my rock and punk music. I had a special band, and the touring was unforgettable. Greg Griffith went out with us on Bass, after producing my last two solo records, Lung of Love and Didnât it Feel Kinder. I got to play with my punk rock mainstays, Kaia Wilson on electric guitar and vocals, and Melissa York on drums (The Butchies, Team Dresch), the very thread that had run through my solo music up to this point. They were super fun to tour with and always stellar on stage. Julie Wolf came in as a special guest on keys and vocals, and brought a big helping of musicality and glue to the band. It was a gift to have her around for so many shows. My current producer, Brian Speiser was working for the Indigo Girls as our Front of House sound person, somehow, I talked him into coming out and doing a bit of solo touring. Our friend, Becky Bodonyi, who was the current activism guru for the Indigos, went out with us as well, and helped us run the shows and sell merch. We toured from the Southeast out to the West coast, Northwest and Southwest. Later in the year, we covered more ground, starting in the South again and touring through the Northeast and heading a bit West, ending in Tulsa, Oklahoma opening for Brandi Carlile at Cainâs Ballroom. The most memorable night was in Wellfleet, Ma at a little club called The Beachcomber, with Toshi Reagon, who played a riveting show that threw the bar crowd into motion. We had a blast trying to navigate and entertain a crowd that was a blend of beach partiers and stalwart supporters. As tough as it could be at times, to wrestle in club land, the challenge was good for me, and I always felt proud and fulfilled. By the end of our shows, the musicians in my bands are undeniable, we get everyone on our side for a moment in time. That night, the unpredictable coastal summer weather was turning out to be the big story, and we had to get away quick as a powerful storm was bearing down on the area and flooding out roads. As we drove, the towns were closing up and we were running out of gas, but right as we were on our last drop, we found an open station, filled up the tank, and then drove through the night to get some of band members to the airport in time for morning flights. There were moments when I actually could not see if we were even on a road. When we got through it all, it felt like those gigs that can be hard to navigate but worth the energy! While a few months out of 2009 was spent in my solo world, the dominant force in my year was a whirlwind of diverse Indigo Girls activity. In February, we found ourselves floating on the Caribbean with a boat load of songwriters on the Cayamo Cruise. We felt lucky to have the opportunity to be in a space with so many of our mentors as well as the âup and comersâ who keep us inspired and energetic. It was also a chance to have our favorite kind of shows, ones centered around collaborations and musical guests. We got to share the stage with a myriad of people including David Ryan Harris, Brandi Carlile and her band, Mindy Smith, Kathleen Edwards, Vienna Teng, Danielle Howle and Shawn Mullins. On March 16th, we played a gig that I will never forget., I donât just mean the show but everything surrounding it as well. We got the opportunity to fly to Singapore and play a music event called The Mosaic Festival. To adjust to the time change, we arrived a few days early and had some time to look around. I had never been to an Asian country, so everything about this trip was new to me. Singapore has so many cultures in one place. Just walking around, you can hear a smorgasbord of languages spoken and eat food accordingly. I made myself get out of bed and fought my jetlag to go out exploring. I found myself amongst so many people, but everyone figured out how to have their own space. Singapore is so well organized, with an obvious history of global trade and commerce. You could feel the results of the famous trade winds that would trap sea vessels for days, providing a perfect opportunity to buy and sell goods. Brian Speiser and I had a completely hedonistic and mostly fried Vegetarian Indian meal in Little India that was superbly complex in its spices but existed in a very humble space with loads of people coming and going. Itâs still one of my favorite meals I have ever had! There were complexities to being queer in Singapore and playing a partially government funded arts festival. The journalists that interviewed us ranged in age and interest. Some wanted to talk about music and others wanted to talk clandestinely about being queer and activism. Being an out queer person in Singapore was a risk at the time and we had to be careful with what we said, and respect the need for discretion as we talked to young activists that we met. Singapore was a whole new audience for us, so we had no idea what to expect, but both the concert and the small live radio show we did were a total success. After we flew home, we barely had time to recover from jet lag before we hit the South by Southwest music festival in Austin for a couple of events. The early days of SXSW had been a fixture in my life, with my indie label, Daemon Records, and my own solo records. Mostly though, I went to have a good 4 days of live music and Austin magic. Austin is still one of my favorite towns, with so many important memories attached to it. This was too short of a trip for me. The showcase we played for Vanguard Records, (our labelâs distributor) was fun and kind of a crazy madhouse as is expected during SXSW. We made an appearance at Perez Hiltonâs party; it was flattering to be asked, but I felt mostly out of place there. For me, the best discovery I had was hearing the punk rock band Detroit 7 from Japan for the first time. They were so incredible, and I have been listening to the CD I bought from them ever since, I even bought the T-shirt! We ended in March in NYC doing a small live radio show for WFUV (R.I.P. Rita Houston) at The Living Room. In April we hit the road to tour off and on for the rest of the year. We were promoting Poseidon and the Bitter Bug so it a full-on tour with a lot of radio promotional stops and interviews.The first event we jumped into was the Dinah Shore Weekend in Palm Springs. Whoa, what a scene, we tried to play a gig, but honestly, we were not cut out for it, not enough party songs for that crowd. But it was a learning experience and I did get to meet Lady Gaga, before things went bananas for her! On the other end of the gig spectrum, we did get to play at concert celebrating the 100th anniversary of the Progressive Magazine. Ani Difranco headlined and she was perfect and carried the mantle brilliantly. Her show was rambunctious, thought provoking, and uplifting. I can never say enough about the way Ani has influenced me through her activism and music. Creativity, innovation, and a deep love for the better angels in this world have fueled her ambitions, which means the journey has been as important as the destination. And that is something I aspire to each and every day. She is a mentor as well as a friend, and has ended up being a person I have learned some of my most valuable lessons from. We spent the Spring and Summer months raising awareness about food insecurity in America.It was post 2008 economic downturn, and a lot of people were going hungry. So, with the help of Rock for A Remedy, we teamed up with the United Food Bank and collected food and money to donate to local food banks in each of our concert communities. We also worked with the national Humane Society of the United States collected pet food for local animal shelters and rescue organizations in each of the cities we visited. We had the blessing of some inspiring openers / collaborators during this tour season. On our way through Texas, Lloyd Maines and Terri Hendrix opened our shows, which made for good company and joyful shows. Lloyd sat in on guitar and dobro throughout the set, and gave us a musical boost. His sense of humor and humility made his brilliant music making warm and inviting. Lucy Wainwright Roche was on board, and not only sang some great harmonies in our set, but kept the crew and us happy and entertained with her stories and songs. When your crew likes the opener, itâs a big deal because they hear so much music all the time-it takes something special to sing through that noise. One of my newer favorite song writers Gregory Alan Isakov did a few shows, this was right before his career took off and carried him into a new stratosphere. His records are gorgeous and lush, with masterful storytelling and singing. And speaking of someone who is now in another stratosphere, the incomparable Brandi Carlile and her band did a run of shows with us. She was totally ascendant and there was a buzz in the air, which was super exciting. And the best part of course was all the songs we sang together. I can still picture the sweat pouring out as we huddled to the mic together on a steaming hot night at the Big Top Chautauqua in Bayfield, Wisconsin. Our buddy, Matt Nathanson also played a handful of shows with us, and now that I look back on that, I think, âwow!â I mean heâs just gets better and better. I know what a treasure it was to have him on some shows. We covered a ton of territory with concerts throughout the Spring and Summer, and it was like a rolling variety show with so much stimulus and so many musical moments that stay with me, but there is one that gob smacks every time I think of it. Justin Vernon (Bon Iver) came out and played solo, as our special guest for three shows in California! I often hear in my memory, his songs echoing through the outdoor venues in the soft California summer nights. Emily and I are huge Bon Iver fans and were quite amazed that he was into doing these gigs. Justin is one place where Emily and I meet musically and are completely in sync, he is a visionary hero and a tie that binds us. I know thatâs weird to say, with all the things we have to bind us, but having musical heroes in common is something that can sustain and inspire a friendship. They were transcendent experiences and made me fall even more in love with his music and his person. The last tour we did for the year was in the U.K. and Ireland. It had loads of radio stops and interviews, but also some coveted days off. Itâs rare to get a full day off on a U.K. tour because youâre always tempted to work the whole time to make the most of the trip, but I find having a day to explore can do wonders for song writing and perspective, and so, only enhances the shows. I spent a day in Newcastle wondering around the old Roman and Anglo-Saxon civilization sites, thinking about Hadrianâs Wall, and then I wrote parts of âHappy in the Sorrow Keyâ. In Dublin, I went out for the night with John Reynolds to see Damien Dempsey play his old stomping ground, the suburb of Donaghmede. It was a rough and tumble night, after which, I came back to my hotel and penned the words for âDamoâ. We had a fantastic bunch to travel with. The lovely Carolyn Snell tour managed and always kept calm and made every day and night full of fun. Our bus driver, Jonnie Lewis became an inspiration for the chorus of a song, called âOlympia Innâ, which I had started writing on a solo tour. Of course, one of the most special things about touring over in the U.K. is that we often have the pleasure of Carol Isaacs joining us on accordion and keys for our London show, and sometimes other towns. If Clare Kenny is in town, she comes out and plays bass, and John Reynolds typically comes by for tea or we all have a big dinner together. These London musicians are some of most important musical and spiritual touchstones, and have been points on our compass for many years now! It was the perfect end to our 2009 tour season.\n\n**************************\n\n2008 entry posted 23 Jan 2017:\n\nA.R. 2008\n\nThe drive from my home in North Georgia to Nashville is a good one, it winds through the mountains of northwest Georgia for a while, follows the national disgrace of the Trail of Tears briefly, and then hits the highway right before Chattanooga and Monteagle. There's a Starbucks in Manchester now, along with billboards for the Bonnaroo music festival which are interspersed among the historical markers for Civil War battlefield sites, but the Smoke House Lodge and Restaurant marking the top of the mountain is still there, and I've pulled over countless times to sort myself out in the old parking lots of fireworks stores that still manage to stand.\n\nOn the eve of Obama's last days in office, on MLK Day, I am driving this road, thinking about a lot of heavy stuff and also, more gleefully, remembering the solo tour I embarked upon in October 2008 that started with a breakdown outside of Dalton, GA and limped along until the converted shuttle bus we rented finally took its last guzzle and we abandoned it miles from our canceled gig in Ames, IA. Through the kindness of friends, we were met with a rental van in Des Moines, which I ended up buying with a loan and still drive to this day. We celebrated the election of our first African American President at a gig at The Mod Club in Toronto on November 4th, and then drove through the night to Burlington, VT, U.S.A. eating gas station junk food and laughing in euphoria. Heady days to be sure and quite a different feel from these days.\n\nThat year, 2008, was a year where hope and promise were palpable at every gig no matter the road troubles or occasional colds and flus. You could feel it on the streets and in the venues, all across America.\n\nI recorded and released my 3rd solo studio record, Didn't It Feel Kinder, and Indigo Girls recorded our first independent release since 1987, Poseidon and the Bitter Bug. In between, we covered miles and miles, touring as a duo and trio (with Julie Wolf); sharing the stage for months with Brandi Carlile and her band; joining up with Cyndi Lauper for her True Colors tour; and playing a very special gathering for Honor the Earth in Mill Valley, CA. I did two months of my own solo touring across the U.S., and celebrated my record release by playing a benefit performance with Brandi for Housing Works in NYC.\n\nI recorded Didn't It Feel Kinder in the late winter at the beginning of 2008. This was my first solo venture with an \"actual\" producer. Greg Griffith was exacting and incredibly musical, just oozing with arrangement ideas, his brain in a constant flux with melodic and rhythmic structures. He was a challenge for me on every level but it was stuff I needed to tackle and learn about in order to grow, and I knew it, so even though I was tired of being so vulnerable, I stuck with it, because I knew it was all about my ego and turning back to my comfort zone would mean stagnation.\n\nI reunited with The Butchies- Kaia Wilson (guitar and vocals) and Melissa York (drums), and I brought in a guest band, Arizona, who I had just fallen in love with after a Daemon Records intern, Nick Campbell had given me their demo-it was his band! Tomi Martin from Three Five Human played some electric guitar and brought in a whole new sound. Brandi was well entrenched in my life, and came to sing harmonies on half the record. I found a different direction with this record, trying to infuse some soul and groove into the old punk sound. We worked in Asheville at Echo Mountain Studio, still one of my favorite studios, and at Greg's home in Greensboro.\n\nNorth Carolina was starting to figure prominently in my musical life. When we hit the road as a band, Julie Wolf came on board to play keys and sing. She elevated the band to a brand new height. The IG sound engineer, Brian Speiser came out on the road with us, we were determined to have the sound end of things really top notch. This record had a lot of tricky arrangements and a good mix made all the difference. Brian is the sound person you want on your side in a club tour, I think he repaired and rewired half of the venue's we played. We would pull up to the club in the van and before we had even finished unloading, we would notice Brian buried in the sound board or speakers, attending to something he'd already noticed needed fixing.\n\nThe IG's turned to Mitchell Froom again to make Poseidon and the Bitter Bug. Mitchell was the perfect producer for us at this time. We were venturing into life as independent artists again and his supportive, highly creative, devil-may-care attitude was just what we needed. We could be free with him, but still felt the guidance of his musical vision and skills, and his sharp intellect. And although Mitchell's personality was kind of the opposite of Greg Griffith, I felt like they had so many similarities in the way they approached arrangement and structure, that I was lucky to experience both sides of the same coin. It gave me so much insight into song writing to work with both of them, the experiences really informed each other; I felt hugely inspired as a writer and gained a lot of confidence, having gone through both records.\n\nThe title of Poseidon and the Bitter Bug was a little bit tongue in cheek for me, because it kind of took to task our cynicism and any illusion that we had control over our lives and career, yet here we were, starting a new career as independent artists and on the precipice of a monumental election that ushered in so many positive changes for us as citizens. Still, before we ventured into the record, before the year unfolded, we experienced a lot of hurdles and doubts that gave us pause; we just had to pick ourselves up and keep truckin. This record was freeing and fun to make. Matt Chamberlain, came back to play drums, with a twinkle in his eye. Clare Kenny made the trek over from the U.K., not a small feat in these days of expensive work visas and high security. Clare always played just the right thing, such a groove player. Mitchell agreed to be part of the band for this record. His command of keyboard sounds along with melody and chord structure gave the record a different edge. Alison Brown came on board with guitar and banjo, and we had special guest Missy Higgins on some harmonies. We were a tight unit. We recorded it fast, faster than we had ever worked, at one of our favorite haunts in Atlanta-the old Southern Tracks Studio. A lot of the tracking for the record was live, and there were a lot of memorable moments for me. We recorded the obscure song \"True Romantic\" in a few takes and the whole thing was one live unaltered take -very overwrought and kind of crazy. I love the way it turned out, but we never play the song, it was just one of those special moments for me. I wrote the song on a quiet dog walk in the woods and recorded it in a fury of sound and emotion. We re-recorded my song, \"Driver Education\" that had been on my solo record, Prom. Mitchell actually brought it to my attention that the IG's could do a cool version of it; it was just a little 3-minute pop song and perfect for whimsical harmonies, fun for us. We did an acoustic version of the whole record. Stripped-down, we played every song as a duo (or trio with Alison) using only one or two microphones-completely live with no overdubs. I didn't know if it would work, but it did and it made me feel more confident about playing the songs live. It was a good exercise because we did a lot of acoustic touring that year, really the majority of the year, so this set the touring year up well for us.\n\nOur one big Honor the Earth benefit event for the year was a very special gathering in Mill Valley, CA where Winona spoke and we had a feast of local and Native foods, played music and talked about our goals for the upcoming years. At this point, we were focusing a lot on changing the energy economy to a more sustainable less destructive one. \"Ironically, while some Native Nations and their reservation communities have borne the brunt of destructive energy development that has reaped massive profits for some, they are the poorest in the country, with high unemployment rates and inadequate housing.\"-Winona LaDuke. As a Southerner, the tragic legacy of the Indian Removal Act of 1830 and the resulting Trail of Tears that left its mark on Georgia has always been with me, and compelled me to action and involvement in Native issues, to do my part in healing this incredible injustice. The South has an awful track record on racism with its history of genocide against Native peoples, its economy of slavery and dark history of lynch mobs and Jim Crow; there's no way to turn a blind eye and not try to do something to remedy what is still a deep wound and ongoing sin in our region. By the end of my drive back home from Nashville I was listening to a PBS Newshour story about the new book, Blood at the Root by Patrick Phillips. This amazing and honest book deals with healing the long period of racial violence from antebellum times to the 1990's in Forsyth County- a county that lies 20 miles from my front door. And while things have improved from the days of Georgia Klan marches in the 1980's, hate crimes are on the rise again, and there are still so many stories that need to be told from these Southern counties, dark, unrelenting histories that have been buried and left unmarked. With every one that is uncovered, I am angered and saddened but also determined to stay and fight for the part of the South I love, a South that is generous, spiritual, humble and brave.\n\nAR 11.16.17\n\nE.S. 2008\n\nUnexpected and numbing, I fell into a writer's block in 2008. It didn't matter how long I sat with a guitar or banjo or ukulele in my hands, I couldn't come up with any ideas that stuck. I've had writers block before, and writer's block is frightening, but eventually I would come out of it, feeling the sun burn through the fog. I thought I had come to the point in my life and career where I could have faith that the spring of inspiration would always begin to trickle again. You would think the political events of 2008 would be enough of a jolt into creative action, but I remained empty of the ability to write a song. In a nutshell, I feared I would never write again, which sounds dramatic, but that was the depth of my feeling. I decided to take a \"writer's retreat\". This was a first for me. My favorite peaceful place is at the beaches of the Florida Gulf, so Tristin and I packed up and went south.\n\nI decided to read and just look around, look out at the sea and the sand and just write something down, anything! Thankfully, there was a man fishing, with two big fishing poles stuck in the sand, right down the beach in front of me. Like a tiny miracle, the simple act of observing and writing down opened up a metaphor: the looking out, the search for a catch, the one that got away, and so on. So, I started in with \"The fisherman comes up, puts his two poles in the sand. He looks out at the sea just exactly like me, but I've got a book in my hand\", and that paean to the sea became \"Fleet of Hope\" After that, the grip of writer's block loosened, and I wrote the bulk of my songs for Poseidon and the Bitter Bug while I was at the beach. There was no mountain of songs. I was able to squeeze out five songs. The album ended up with 10 tracks, five of Amy's and those five of mine.\n\nWe wanted Mitchell Froom to produce this record, as we had loved working with him on Despite our Differences. Mitchell came up with the name of the album, a combination of lyrics from \"Second Time Around\" and \"Fleet of Hope\". I don't think he intended to actually name the album, as Mitchell has a wonderfully dry and acerbic sense of humor, and when he said \"you should name it Poseidon and the Bitter Bug\" he laughed, and Amy and I were like, \"we LOVE that\". So, that was it.\n\nWhile we were planning the schedule for recording and getting the songs together, Hollywood Records dropped us. We weren't surprised, and we were happy to finally come full circle and be independent. We created our own label, IG Recordings, and carried on as if nothing had changed. Something had changed! We were fully autonomous again and hadn't been since 1987 when we released Strange Fire. It was liberating. Everything had changed so much in the music \"business\", and over the years we had developed all of the relationships we needed (publicist, radio, promoters, management, agent) to just carry on ourselves. Suddenly, we could pick our own release date, schedule our own artwork deadlines, spend the money absolutely prudently, and not have to think about pleasing anyone else but ourselves. The freedom and autonomy was incredible! I have to say that, knowing so many artist horror stories of record label abuse and lack of care, Indigo Girls emerged unscathed by many years of record label experience, and I am especially grateful to our Epic records people, and our first A and R guy, Roger \"Snake\" Klein. He helped shape our early days at Epic records.\n\nAmy and I decided to record Poseidon and the Bitter Bug in two versions, one full band and one all acoustic. On the acoustic version, we added Amy's song \"Salty South\" as a bonus. We called in our favorite banjo player, Alison Brown, who played the banjola on \"I'll Change\". It is one of my favorite leads on any IG song ever. I was pleased that every full band version of a song could be translated into its original version. I often think about whether listeners like us acoustic or with a band, and I was glad we could release an album that offered both experiences. Mitchell also introduced us to Missy Higgins during recording; he had produced a recent album of hers. She ended up coming to the studio and singing vocals on \"Digging for you Dream\" and \"True Romantic\". Her voice is spooky and lovely, and she's a great gal. We ended up doing some shows with her stateside, where she blew audiences away.\n\nOnce the album was complete, we looked to 2009 for a release date. There were many memorable shows in 2008. We played Pridefest in Milwaukee to a torrential downpour which I will never forget! You cannot dampen the spirits of the queers! In fact, the torrent only seemed to heighten the joy and singing of those Pridefest revelers. I always feel a little guilty, as Amy and I play protected from the elements and the people in the audience soak to the bone!\n\nCyndi Lauper launched the True Colors Tour in 2007 to give back to the LGBT communities and gay fans who had given so much to her. We played three shows on the tour in 2008, with B-52s, Rosie O'Donnell, Kate Clinton, Regina Spektor and others. Part of the original purpose of the tour was to help enable passage of the Matthew Shepard Act which expanded the 1969 federal Hate Crimes Act to include crimes motivated by a person's gender, gender identity or sexual orientation. Obama signed the bill into law in 2009. This kind of activism through music is the heart and soul of what Amy and I love best. It was particularly important then, and always, to have straight allies to help us in the queer rights movement. Cyndi epitomized that kind of commitment, and the shows were full of joy and vibe.\n\nI was invited by Sugarland (Jennifer Nettles and Kristian Bush) to join their Common Thread tour, which was an acoustic show I played solo with Sugarland and Amos Lee. We played 2 shows in Colorado and a show in Santa Fe, NM, singing harmonies on each other's songs and donating the proceeds to a group of our choice. I chose Honor the Earth. This was my first real exposure to Amos Lee, and I've been a lifelong fan ever since. Because I wasn't used to performing solo, I was quite nervous, but the Sugarland hospitality was so welcoming and the music so good, I lost myself in the experience. I've known Jennifer and Kristian so long, and they are as dedicated to social change and activism through music as any other artist I know, including ourselves. So, the camaraderie was deep.\n\nObviously, American eyes were on the 2008 presidential election. I was a fierce Hillary Clinton supporter, but as the campaign wore on I began to feel that wonderful comfort of being happy with either Obama or Clinton winning the nomination and, ultimately, the election. I have a tremendous amount of respect for John McCain, but Palin derailed the train for him, and the outcome of the election appeared sealed. I remember the keynote address a young Senator Obama gave at the 2004 DNC, a speech which most likely sealed his destiny to become president. Every once in a while, a brilliant orator and person of deep heart and conscience arrives on the political scene. I was keenly aware that, in my lifetime, I was witnessing a powerful political shift spearheaded by a uniquely special man. The fact that America was going to elect an African American was a turning point in my life. Change is so slow! Then this election happened, and it renewed my faith that hope and work for change and progress wasn't just a futile pursuit or wishful thinking. The pendulum swings.\n\nI think a lot about the personal and the \"political\" and how the two are intertwined, and how, for me, music helps me navigate and understand the world. 2008 began as a very difficult personal time for me, having experience a painful relationship breakup earlier and the beginning of a new one. Songs like \"Fleet of Hope\" are world weary with a speck of hope.\n\nThe culmination of a year of crushing writer's block and ultimate liberation from it; becoming an independent band again; the benefit concerts that helped me grow and continue to be part of a movement; the American election that changed the country and gave so many some hope. These were all a part of each other. In the midst of it all, I never know how I will absorb and reflect on it. Undoubtedly, the gestalt ends up in the songs.\n\n**************************\n\n2007 entry posted 13 Aug 2016:\n\nES.2007\n\nAmy and I were called to New Orleans to participate in a gathering of musicians from around the U.S. whose purpose was to witness the still devastating effects of Hurricane Katrina and work together to bring back the musical and cultural Diaspora that happened in the wake of the brutal storm. We worked with Air Traffic Control and Future of Music Coalition (2 groups who integrated musicians and artists with activism) in direct support of Sweet Home New Orleans, a local New Orleans non-profit that helps storm-displaced musicians return home and provides them access to much needed resources. The experience was one of the most impactful I have known through all our years.\n\nSitting around a table together, most of us hadn't known or met each other before, but we were joined by our common purpose of helping to bring musicians back to New Orleans and brainstorming on how we could make best use of our various platforms to increase the effectiveness of our activism, individually and collectively.\n\nThe gathered artists were Jim James of My Morning Jacket, Matt Nathanson, Damien Kulash,Pamela Z and me and Amy, among others.\n\nLike almost anything else, there is much to learn about how to orchestrate and employ works of activism, no matter what the social justice issue or benefit. This particular gathering was helpful in sharing ideas and inspiring us to know we had found a new community of musicians to support grass roots activism. Believe it or not, it hasn't always been easy to find other artists to join in on various issues.\n\nWe traveled by bus to the lower 9th ward to see some of the utter destruction of once tightly knit communities in New Orleans. I was particularly haunted by the water marks on the houses and buildings, and by the spray painted messages left there to identify if any people had died in the houses, or what was found or not found when rescue workers came through the neighborhoods. Even 2 years after the storm, there were houses upended with all of the belongings tossed together and abandoned. There were grass and weeds growing over small lots where houses once stood, coupled with the overwhelming feeling that this was where people had lived and worked and loved and lost and gathered stories, and then a diabolical storm came and blew them away. But it wasn't just the storm; as much as we learned on the trip, the levees were incapable of holding back a fierce hurricane, and people in power knew this before the storm ever hit. In desperation to leave any way they could, some people were turned back by armed authorities and even shot and killed.\n\nI can remember watching the first home game of the New Orleans Saints televised, after Katrina, and how the networks were making a huge deal over the symbolic importance of the game, and I just thought, I doubt the people who were crammed into the terrifying holding pen of the storm- battered superdome felt the same enthusiasm for a football game. Symbolism has its limits when people have lost everything.\n\nWe were there to learn about what happens to communities of people, particularly people without economic means, who are forced into exile. Specifically, we wanted to join in the efforts to help bring back the New Orleans musicians who had been forced out of the state with no real way of returning home. The reality was that the entire human musical chain that gave us the deep music of the region would be broken and that a generation of artists would be wiped away and, henceforth, generations to come. As a musician and a humanist, it was impossible not to feel the urgency and magnitude of the situation. And, truly, I thought about what it would feel like to be swept away from my home and my community, and I couldn't fully wrap my mind around it.\n\nThankfully, Sweet Home New Orleans was locally based and grass roots, and they knew the needs of the displaced musicians more than any FEMA agent ever could. Again, I felt grateful to have come into contact with a group so vital to a city I loved so deeply (I had spent my first 2 years of college in New Orleans at Tulane) and to be able to lend a hand in any small way possible. And I was reminded how music brings hope.\n\nThe benefit show at Tipitina's was awesome. The highlight of the event for me was hearing local greats, Bonerama, and Al \"Carnival Time\" Johnson blow us away and remind us of the rich and uniquely powerful music of New Orleans.\n\nI have vivid memories of that trip; the stories of loss and hope I heard, the people I met, the lessons we learned, the images of destruction, and the sound of music weaving the whole thing together.\n\n2007 was full of travel. We toured the UK in the bleak winter months, which was something I actually loved; cold and wet Britain on the outside, the warmth of fans and our Brit contingent of musicians whom we loved like family. We had a rousing night of food and conversation at John Reynolds's flat in London. I think Clare Kenny even made sushi that night, and we sat along a long table and relished each other's company. I love touring in other countries, and even England can feel exotic with its moody weather, jacket potatoes, prawn rose marie sandwiches, black cabs and double decker buses. Ever the hedonist, I was pleased to discover that proper coffee shops were starting to open up. Tea is the national drink, but coffee is what I wake up for!\n\nI know that I have gushed in past blogs about how I love our English musician friends across the pond. Getting to play with Carol Isaacs and Clare Kenny and, sometimes John Reynolds, is indescribably stirring for me. Of course, they are supremely gifted musicians, but as much as that, they are like flames that burn in my heart and never go out; such integrity and delight. When I listen to our records they have played on, their friendship is captured and alive in the songs, and that's a very powerful thing.\n\nSpeaking of travels, we were lucky enough to get to Australia again and tour the country fairly comprehensively. I got to hold a koala and Amy got to pet a kangaroo, which is kind of touristy, maybe in the eyes of Aussies? But to me, it was AWESOME. Koalas really grab on to you like little monkeys and, as you might imagine, appear completely dozed. They are snuggly.Their claws are sharp. When you tour Australia you have to fly between shows because the distances between cities are so wide. It's completely different from touring in the U.S. where the bus goes place to place. SO, one day I was holding a koala at a nature preserve, or I was walking by Sydney Harbor, looking across at the Opera House, and soon after gazing out at the Indian Ocean in Perth. Again, I took deep breaths of gratitude for the opportunity to travel so far and come across so many wonderful people, get to know Qantas airlines J.\n\nI used to try to keep journals of my travels, and I have one from Australian travels, but I always look back on them and cringe at the feeble attempts and overwrought descriptions of my experiences. I will say that there is always something inspiring about leaving the U.S. and getting to experience different cultures, even English speaking ones. I like to be reminded of the vast diversity of peoples and places. And to turn on a television and watch a broadcast that tunes in to something else besides American interests.\n\nBack in the States, we took another short Honor the Earth tour in the Southwest, where we worked in support of the Just Transition Coalition, a group comprised of Hopi and Navajo tribal members and other allies to get pollution credit profits from the closed Mohave Generating Station and use them to support sustainable energy production through solar and wind projects. I found this an extremely inspiring model, because the Hopi and Navajo tribes had passed measures to stop using the Black Mesa aquifer to feed dirty energy and water wasting production from the station and actually convert the loss of that industry into the creation of new, clean, and sustainable energy. This is the crux of energy justice work: that a community should not have to sacrifice the environment for an economy, and that a healthy local economy can be sustained through \"green\" energy production. These battles over precious resources, like water, continue, and fairly new and terribly dangerous energy production methods, like fracking, are at the forefront of energy justice battles that tribes and others continue to fight.\n\nIt was a heavy year and a meaningful year. On a personal note, I met and began a life path with my future wife. But in 2007, the prospect of same sex marriage in the U.S. was a distant dream. That story is yet to come in this blogworld.\n\nAR.2007\n\n2007 was a stand out year for us on every level. I find myself saying this a lot about this phase of our career, but when it's all laid out in front of me, it feels like we reached a critical mass and a convergence of activist and musical relationships that threw us into all sorts of amazing situations. Despite Our Differences had been out since September of 2006 and we had already covered a lot of ground with a full band, so we hit the road as a duo for most of 2007. But even as a duo, we toured with so many great bands that we were not alone on stage very often at all! Our old friends from Atlanta, the incomparable Three5Human and our new musical ally, Brandi Carlile traded out as opening bands and also played with us, so we had the best of both worlds, being able to play stripped down arrangements as well as full on harmony and rock versions of our songs. One night in Atlanta we even got to have Brandi AND Three5Human both join us for a live DVD recording of a show at The Roxy. It was an unforgettable night for me, with the powerhouse vocals of Trina and Brandi, Tomi Martin on electric guitar, and the rest of Three5 helping us bring the rock to songs like \"Trouble\" and \"Tether,\" plus having third part harmonies on obscure songs like \"Hope Alone\" and \"World Falls.\"\n\nTouring with Brandi and the Hanseroth twins brought new life to us. We did a lot of shows together and got to the point where we knew a dozen or so songs, and we could throw just about any new song their way and they could learn it. Tim and Phil Hanseroth brought a very special musicality to the mix with the ability to put harmonies on anything as well as play bass and guitar. The cellist for Brandi's band, Josh Neumann was really generous with his time as well, and sat in on a bunch of songs. His rich tone and musical accuracy created a new feel and extra dimension on the songs he played on. Brandi knew better than anyone how to weave her voice in and out of our existing harmonies. We had a plethora of songs on our records that we had recorded extra vocal parts for, and Brandi could nail these parts. Brandi's voice was riveting and she was ascending in her career and the energy of that was palpable at the shows. It can't be overstated how much she brought to our career at a time when I think musically we needed a challenge and something to shake us up and inspire us.\n\nWe got to play the Austin City Limits Music Festival, a total coup for us. This was the kind of festival that we were usually passed over for, so I felt very lucky to be on the bill. It was in its first years of existence and the vibe was totally idealistic and not cynical at all. Everyone who came felt lucky and was happy to be there. The city of Austin is such a fantastic place, and holds a lot of significance for us as activists and musicians, so this made it extra special. We were only there for one night but I did get to hear two amazing bands, Muse and Arcade Fire. The crowds were huge and the bigger bands had full-on production, which made you feel like the only thing happening in the world was the rock show that surrounded you. I was completely transported and felt like the kid in Big Star's song, \"Thirteen.\" It was a great relief from the ills of the world, but of course you can't live in that moment forever. There were wars going on in every corner of the world, the VA Tech shooting had happened, Native communities were still fighting for their environmental and culture justice, queers were in the midst of major battles with a an ever fomenting right-wing, and New Orleans was still trying to recover from the disaster of Hurricane Katrina.\n\nWe did a handful of Honor the Earth shows that were really effective and sort of helped us work out a new model for Honor shows. We realized that we didn't have the numbers at shows that we had once had, so we needed to figure out a way to fund raise, create press events and raise awareness without doing long expensive tours. So, we tried the approach of doing a couple of focused shows in one region that would highlight a specific issue, pouring all our energy into press and awareness for that issue. In Shiprock, NM we supported Navajo community members and environmentalists in their struggle against a polluting coal-fired powered plant at Desert Rock. In Flagstaff, we supported the Just Transition Coalition who was working towards a shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy and promoting economic and job growth through this transition. It made a lot of sense to support good energy projects that could replace bad ones, plus it helped with one of the missions of Honor the Earth- to build bridges between Native and non-Native communities. We got to support this mission when we teamed up with The Montana Human Rights Network to play their annual Martin Luther King Jr. Day celebration at the University Theater in Missoula. The focus of the event was on Native peoples in the state and emphasized the message that cultural and environmental preservation is a human right. It was a perfect fit for us and we used the trip as an opportunity to have an intimate reception to raise money and get more folks engaged in Honor the Earth.\n\nIn Uncasville, Connecticut, the Mohegan Tribe hosted us for five splendid nights at the cabaret theater at their Mohegan Sun Casino; it was one of the best gigs we have ever played, with incredible hospitality and a super intimate setting that allowed us to thoroughly explore our catalogue of songs. I think this was one of our first years of starting to play Native casinos, something we had shied away from because playing the casinos had always felt too much like \"retiring to Vegas.\" But the Indian casinos really do have a different vibe and most of them have an attention to environmental sustainability that is impressive, plus a firm belief in using the profits to nurture their communities.\n\nStill supporting Despite Our Differences, the year was bracketed by stints in the U.K. and Ireland in February, and an Australian tour in November. This was definitely the most extensive Australian tour we had done, with plenty of TV and radio to go around. We made the best of our free time over there too, we did a lot of sightseeing and probably the most group outings we had done in a while-the Australia Zoo in Brisbane, the beaches and the Freemantle Prison in Perth, the incredible Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney, and a show at the Spiegeltent in Melbourne! We had a tight knit crew and everything just seemed to line up for us to be positive and engaged.\n\nThe beginning of the year over in the U.K. was also really special. We had the honor of being interviewed on the Janice Long show on BBC 2. There is something about going to the BBC that feels very magical, like you've hit a certain mark in your career. We visited Abbey Road to perform for the UPop@Abbey Road Sessions. We geeked out about being at Abbey Road and did what every tourist does, taking a bunch of pictures of ourselves lined up crossing the road just like the Beatles. We had a get together with our Irish and Brit friends hosted by John Reynolds at his London home and recording studio, where we had once worked on Come On Now Social. We had a big feast and a ton of fun.\n\nIn the solo realm, I released a very lo-fi live record called Amy Ray and the Volunteers-Live from Knoxville. We had recorded a show back in 2005 at Blue Cats in Knoxville, TN with 4 tracks to a computer. We would have had more tracks, but the equipment failed us at the last minute. For this reason, it's really \"live\"-no fixes and barely any separation. I held onto the tracks and mixed it when I had a break. The guy that I mixed the record with, Josh Monroy was working with Ludacris at the time and so he did us a favor, and let us mix at his studio, Ludaplex, A-T-L Yeah! I got started on another studio record, Didn't It Feel Kinder. This time I went back to work with Kaia Wilson and Melissa York and brought in a new producer, Greg Griffith for the project. Greg and Mel had grown up on the NYC punk scene and had played in a couple bands together, she suggested that we give him a shot. It was a fortuitous suggestion because Greg was not only a great bass and guitar player, but also an interesting and evolved producer; he upped my game a lot and taught me so much about production and songwriting. We worked at a bunch of places on the record-my house, Tree Studio in Atlanta, Echo Mountain in Asheville, NC and in Greensboro, NC at Greg's studio. It was a long process that carried over into the next year, but worth the time with very special guests like the band Arizona, guitarist Tomi Martin from Three5Human, and Brandi Carlile singing on a bunch of tracks.\n\nOver all the year felt pretty social and we both surrounded ourselves with community and heard a lot of good music. Besides ACL Music Festival, Indigo Girls also went to Las Vegas and did a Cyndi Lauper True Colors' show. The line-up was pretty incredible with The Dresden Dolls, Margaret Cho, The Gossip, Erasure, and Debbie Harry. At the Santa Fe \"Power to the Peaceful Festival\" I got to hear Richie Havens play \"Freedom.\" The Ellen DeGeneres Show welcomed us to the show to play \"Little Perennials, \" which turned out to be very special with a killer band put together by our producer Mitchell Froom, who also joined in on keys. We celebrated the legacy of environmentalist, Rachel Carson with an event in Pittsburgh. And we marched for peace with a colorful hodge-podge of really cool activist and political leaders in Kennebunkport, ME near the Bush Family's summer estate.\n\nThe most powerful experience of the year was our post-Katrina trip to New Orleans. We attended an activist/artist retreat organized by Air Traffic Control and The Future of Music Coalition. A diverse group of artist gathered for two days in New Orleans to learn about the hurricane, the faulty levees and the government's failed response, the efforts to rebuild and what we can do to help. The weekend culminated with a benefit concert for Sweet Home New Orleans, a coalition of non-profit organizations whose mission was to help find affordable housing and provide rental assistance for musicians, Mardi Gras performers and other traditional New Orleans performers. The money specifically went to help musicians displaced by hurricane Katrina and the flood from the faulty levees. We were surrounded by an incredible array of artists that ran the gamut, including, Ok Go's Damian Kulash, My Morning Jacket's Jim James, Mike Relm, Pamela Z, Death Cab For Cutie's Nick Harmer, and Matt Nathanson. After two days of touring around New Orleans and attending workshops, we got together and played a benefit show at Tipitina's where we were also joined by Bonerama (an amazing Trombone Band), and the legendary Al \"Carnival Time\" Johnson.\n\nThe days leading up to the show, were intense and you could feel the group of artists shedding their egos and opening up to the overwhelming pain of seeing the destruction wrought by this disaster even these years later. There was a willingness to just be human and work together to put on a great show and try to offer something up to this compelling community of survivors, workers, artists, activist and community builders. I kept a running diary of my feelings and thoughts as we listened to folks speak about faulty levees and broken pumps, lost lives, homes, neighborhoods and cultures. When I read through it now, I am transported to how gut-wrenching it felt to tour the worst hit parts of New Orleans and even almost two years after the flood to still see and feel the devastation in such a palpable way. I will forever see those big spray painted circular X's on the sides of homes- messages for the weary workers-how many people are in the attic, how many dead, any pets found, and other codes that must be imprinted into the permanent language centers of the folks in New Orleans.\n\nThese traditions of place and family-they are the fabric of the disenfranchised, the voices that need to be heard. The struggles of New Orleans are not so different from the struggles of communities of across this nation. The Navajos fighting coal mining, the Goshutes fighting nuclear waste, the African-American neighborhoods fighting toxic waste and bad water, the Mexican farm workers displacing themselves against every instinct to make a living and survive. Families spread out and split up, or sacrificing health and culture, offering themselves up to the Diaspora of America just to survive. These issues spur us on to keep making music and singing truth to power. I find that even in the face of all the pain, music is healing, celebratory, and it's fun, something we need more of these days.\n\n**************************\n\n2006 entry posted 22 Apr 2016:\n\nAR.2006\n\nThere are so many details of the Indigo years that have slipped my mind; I find myself going to our own web archives and the fabulous lifeblood.net website to figure out what we were doing at any given time. I always thought of myself as a documenter but things do get lost along the way. My calendars disappear from my computer and I forget to write things down in the rush of traveling. Most of the things I experience feel so compelling, they all seem like they will stay forever imprinted in my mind, but alas they don't.\n\nSo, I got sidetracked while trying to write this blog and found myself ruminating on John Trudell, Marcheline Bertrand, Angelina Jolie and Joni Mitchell-what a crowd. Because at some point in the 2000's, when I was in the LA area working, I had a meeting with Marcheline about the projects she and her daughter Angelina, were supporting and/ or collaborating on with the transformative Native activist and poet, John Trudell. Marcheline and John have both passed away now, but they left legacies of inventive and important work in the world. Daemon released John's record, \"Bone Days\" in 2002. John toured with the Indigo Girls and taught us an immeasurable amount about resiliency, poetry, activism and the universe. Marcheline's relationship with Trudell was a small point of connection for us and I was always looking for ways to expand and improve my activism.\n\nSo, on my way into my meeting with Marcheline at the Daily Grill in Brentwood, there was Joni Mitchell just sitting there with a stack of books and a writing implement. The only thing I remember is that I told her I was a big fan and then after we talked a bit, as I started to walk away, she said, \"Hey, what do you think about all this war stuff?\" I don't remember anything more of what was said, but it was a sensation I will never forget, even if I can't even remember if it was 2006 or before or beyond. You just never know who you're gonna come across and no matter how many times these types of crazy experiences pop up, they never get old.\n\nWe got signed to Hollywood Records in LA in 2006, after finishing out our contract with Epic. They were satisfied to see us go and we all felt like that record deal had run its course. A label that huge, was just not gonna work for a band like us anymore. It is worth noting that Sony, Epic's parent label, started a \"gay\" label called \"Music With a Twist\" that same year-it's just one of those weird ironies of life. After the Epic deal ended, I was excited for a new chapter and thought maybe we'd end up on our own label again or on some kind of cool indie label, like Subpop. But a label like that just wasn't interested in us, and any other offers we got felt like less than what we could do on our own. Hollywood Records stood out because they were owned by Disney and had vast resources but was still a small label with a cool roster that included Polyphonic Spree and Los Lobos. While I really wanted to be independent, I also thought maybe it would do us good to have access to the film and television world, and maybe we'd land some movie soundtracks or at least more television sync licenses. Hollywood talked a lot about how they would help us achieve that goal, but now we know that was pretty unrealistic.\n\nThe best thing that the Hollywood deal gave us was a relationship with producer Mitchell Froom. Mitchell was someone we had been interested in working with for a long time, and with the connections we made through the Hollywood deal, it finally happened. We were fans of all his work, so it was very validating for us. Everything Mitchell taught me about melodies, chords and song structure has stuck with me and been invaluable to my writing. His passion for music and his own musicality made working with him a totally educational and energizing experience. We worked in his small perfectly appointed studio out behind his house in Santa Monica, CA. It felt so right to be in this kind of home environment instead of a big corporate studio. His recording engineer David Boucher was the perfect mix of talent, patience, and work ethic. We also had our first experience with the drummer Matt Chamberlain. Matt is impossibly brilliant, so groovy, so quick, flawless and easy to play with. The only drawback was that we HAD to have our shit together right away, because his first couple of drum takes were the ones to keep. I like to get my vocals live, so it kicked my butt to have to get it right in the first few takes. But this is one of those things that made this record so important to me as a learning experience.\n\nWith a few exceptions, my songs on this record aren't my best, but the experience and production make it a record that resonates for me, the whole process really had to happen for me to move forward. The great thing about Mitchell was that he just wanted to make music that sounded good, and he worked with my songs to make what I brought in the best it could be. Now of course I wish I had given him better material to work with on this project, but as I listen to the record I can find so many things that I love about it. Matt, Mitchell, and David were all so amazing to meet and work with, and with Carol Isaacs (keys and accordion) and Clare Kenny (bass) playing the tunes, it made it a very musical and transcendent experience. We also had Pink come in and blow our minds with guest vocals on \"Rock and Roll Heaven's Gate\", and Brandi Carlile gave us a gorgeous set of harmonies for Emily's song \"Last Tears\".\n\nThis was an emotional record and while I am not sure what Emily's take on the record is, I feel like we named it aptly, Despite our Differences, as a testament to our survival even though we were in such different spaces, dealing with our own personal demons and trying to write them out of ourselves. Songs like \"Money Made You Mean\" and \"Rock and Roll Heavens Gate\" were comments on the greed and absurdity of the music industry. \"Little Perennials\" was about my own disillusionment and mental confusion, the more time I spent in the music business and on the road. I felt pretty cynical and I was getting permanently homesick, and finding it hard to hold onto to my family, friends and lovers. \"Three County Highway\" was an attempt at a love song and to make the promises I wanted to keep. \"Dirt and Dead Ends\" and \"They Won't Have Me\" came directly from the rural community I live in and love with all my heart. Despite the reality of the political divide in my region, I couldn't see myself living anywhere else; it's done me good to learn to live and love through all the differences. With this record, I was trying to reconcile a lot of \"inside\" things, but at the time, the backdrop of real world conflicts and suffering made some of the songs I wrote feel banal, so it was hard to get behind my songwriting and give it my all. I couldn't write about the big things in the world but had to write about what I knew at the time, which was much smaller. Of course, the trick of good song writing is to be invested and know that the craft is important enough to write the best song you can, no matter what it's about; and to know that there's nothing like a great pop song! Even though, I couldn't always write about the activism and world issues I thought were important, I still had many opportunities to fuel that fire. While we were in Santa Monica working on our record, I walked in a huge May Day march for immigrant rights. The march ran down Wilshire Avenue with tens of thousands of people participating. Across the nation immigrants refused to go to work or school in what was dubbed \"A Day Without Immigrants.\" Major demonstrations were held in dozens of cities across the country, and it was totally incredible to be part of that historic day.\n\nBefore all this happened, earlier in the year, a movie called Wordplay premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. We had indeed gotten an opportunity to be in the movies, but it wasn't about our music, instead it was about our devotion to the New York Times crossword puzzle. The Sunday puzzle was always the most fun for us, but we did a lot of the weekdays puzzles too, on and off the road. Somehow word of our addiction to the puzzle got around to the filmmakers of Wordplay, a movie that was all about Will Shortz, the New York Times crossword editor. Producer Christine O'Malley and Director Patrick Creadon really gave us a whole new dimension when they put us in their movie. It was a super fun interview and very flattering to be in a distinguished crowd of accomplished crossworders!\n\nWe did a bunch of touring both before and right after recording, as a duo and with Julie Wolf, playing keys and accordion, and singing. She became a frequent guest on stage, with a knack for improvisation and spontaneity. She could always jump right in, playing and singing with vigor and accuracy-a gift that was also reflected in her approach to relationships, which helped our friendship deepen over the years. The Atlanta rock band, Three Five Human was also on stage with us a lot, and when we toured together, we always had a mini set with them- Trina Mead wailing on vocals, and Tomi Martin, so magical and agile on his electric guitar. Our friend, Bitch who performs with a provocative blend of poetry, music and prophetic rants came out and did some shows, bringing a challenging, important set to our audience. I always loved hearing her and having time to visit and scheme about our plans for life. In 2006, I was also introduced to the gently infectious music of The Weepies, it was an honor to have them open for us. A scrappy band out of Asheville, called Arizona played with us a bit. They were brilliant, with a blend of Led Zeppelin, Grateful Dead and Magnetic Fields. One of the members, Nick, had interned at Daemon Records and when he gave me his demo, I was taken aback with delight. Our opening slots were really diverse this year and it was fun to always have someone good to listen to before we went on for our set.\n\nAugust brought us a couple of our favorite festivals. I played a punk set at Homo A Go Go in Olympia, WA with my solo band. And the Indigos got to play Newport Folk Festival that year. Newport Folk Festival is still one of the best weekends to just hang around and listen to music, and it's also a festival we haven't played in years, I really miss it! In late September we released Despite Our Differences and had a super festive release party in Atlanta at the heroically independent record store, Criminal Records. We hit the road for a fall/winter tour with Carol, Clare and Matt. It was another dream band and a luxury to be able to play the songs in their fullest dimension for a couple months.\n\nActivism was a still a dominating factor in our lives and for me, one of the most memorable shows of our career was the first day of September 2006, right in Decatur GA at Eddie's Attic, a benefit for GNESA-Georgia Network to End Sexual Assault. Black queer feminist poet and playwright, Cara Page stunned the room with her intrepid journey into slavery, eugenics, genocide, sexism, homophobia and cultural memory. The intelligently rebellious, spoken word artist Katz, from Athens Boys Choir, made a couple of appearances during the set, AND this is where and when I heard Brandi Carlile perform live for the first time. While Brandi was in Atlanta to record vocals for our record, she came over to Eddie's and played the benefit show with us. To move from Cara reading her poetry to Brandi singing, Leonard Cohen's \"Hallelujah\" was a moment that contained so much for me. Cara, who is now the executive director of the Audre Lorde Center, introduced me to a vast world of history and activism that I had only skimmed the surface of before, and Brandi became one of our most enduring musical allies with a rare talent that really reenergized our career.\n\n\"Sometimes when it rains, it's not that simple, when the sky has reasons to cry.\" -John Trudell 1946-2015\n\nR.I.P. Prince 4.21.16\n\nES.2006\n\nWriting the songs that would become part of 2006's Despite Our Differences was an unusually emotional journey, as I was going through an upheaval of personal change that even I couldn't understand. They are songs that are packed with sadness, regret, hopefulness for the survival of love, and a weariness (\"Lay My Head Down\") that rocked me. Even now, when I hear a song from this album, I don't just hear the song; I feel all of the emotions that lived in that season of change. I recall specific things, such as seeing a car on fire, by the side of the highway, as I drove back to Atlanta from Nashville and was immediately smacked with the impact of metaphor for two lives colliding in love (\"All the Way\"). I recall the pain of relentless pining (\"Last Tears\") and the house party I went to where I just stood against a wall, overwhelmed by what felt like utter futility in all human social interaction! I guess that sounds dramatic, but that's how it was for me then. I did things like drank way too much red wine and sat in my car with a friend, listening to Colin Hay's \"I Just Don't Think I'll Ever Get Over You\" again and again and again. That's still one of my very favorite songs to this day. The songs from Despite Our Differences are my most personal collection.\n\nWe had known Mitchell Froom's work as a producer and admired him greatly. He also just happened to be married to my dear friend, Vonda Shepard, whom I had known and worked with for years. When Mitchell and we decided to work together in his home studio in L.A., I was very excited about the entire situation. His engineer was the fabulous David Boucher, and we brought in our favorites, Clare Kenny and Carol Isaacs but also brought in Matt Chamberlain on drums, a master of drums! We used pedal steel for the first time (\"Last Tears\"), played by Greg Leisz. Remarkably, we were joined by guest vocalists Brandi Carlile (\"Last Tears\") and Pink (\"Rock n Roll Heaven's Gate\").\n\nPink was living in L.A. She had recently asked us to record \"Dear Mr. President\" with her in Atlanta. The song, co-written and produced by Billy Mann, was a very powerful statement about a simple conversation with the U.S. president and how he felt about some of the terrible things going on in our world. Amy and I felt simpatico with this song. When we knew we would be in L.A. to make the record, we reached out to Pink to sing on a song, and she graciously accepted. She slayed it. Her voice is so powerful that she had to stand several feet off the microphone. She also learned the song quickly, and her pitch was perfect. In short, she's a badass. After we tracked, we ended up sitting out with her, Mitchell, Vonda and the gang in the courtyard backyard of the studio and talked about politics and social issues. I also had several fun outings with her and friends at what became my favorite bar in the world, Santa Monica's \"Chez Jay\". We would sit in the rental car, in the parking lot, and blast rough demos of the songs we were recording. I remember telling her how much I loved her voice and wished I could do some of the things she could do vocally and musically, and she said, and I'm paraphrasing, that she wished she could phrase a word like \"gunslingers\" the way I did (\"Pendulum Swinger\"). I have to say, it feels good to get a compliment from someone as talented as she is. She is PINK, after all.\n\nWhile we made the record, I lived in apartment in Santa Monica. Santa Monica is a bit of a dreamland for me. It was a short walk across the parking lot to the beach, where I made playlists and went running almost every day. I remember a lot of songs from that playlist: \"The Birds of St Marks\" (Jackson Browne), \"Bad Day\" (Daniel Powter), \"Wisemen\" (James Blunt), \"Won't You Come Again \" Susie Suh, and \"Renegade\" (Eminem and Jay-Z). Running out by the Pacific most days, past the ferris wheel, the beach bungalows, the coffee shops, the tourists, and the surfers, I immersed myself in the music and soaked up the sun. There was a cafe down Ocean Avenue where a lot of weight lifters ate, and I always ordered a protein breakfast of ground turkey and eggs, which I slathered with hot sauce. I loved the solitude of those mornings, or making coffee in my apartment in the morning, or opening the doors to my tiny balcony and looking out onto a world that was temporarily mine. I became a regular at restaurants; Chez Jay's (David Boucher introduced me to that place!) and had a couple of fantastic dinners with Vonda at her favorite Italian restaurants. Mitchell liked to break for the day, very late afternoon, and we would gather in his kitchen and recap the days; sometimes Vonda would prepare a beautiful meal, or we would just hang out and chat and then the evenings were mine. I like the feeling of not being a local but not being a visitor, that somewhere in-between state that I experienced while we made the record.\n\nMitchell Froom is an excellent producer. I learned a lot from him, specifically how each part that goes into a song has its own place. Whereas in the past we might have put musical parts on top of other parts, Mitchell showed us a way to carve out space for each voicing. Simplicity was optimal. I worked on electric guitar parts on \"Run\" and the slide solo in \"Three County Highway\", and it was a challenge to hold back the \"busy-ness\" of the way I often played. Mitchell taught me a great deal about appreciating space, melody, and simplicity in the performance and production of a song. He also had a slew of amazing amps and vintage keyboards and would now and then pop over to a keyboard and play the perfect simple textural addition to a song. His studio was very small, just a few isolation spaces and the board, with three chairs. At first, working in a smaller space (small compared to big studios we had used prior to this record) was an adjustment for me. I mistakenly assumed that we couldn't create the same big, pure professional sound that we'd been able to achieve before, but I couldn't have been more wrong. Big space doesn't always equate with big sound. Mitchell and David had been such a strong team for so long that they knew how to get every sound they wanted, and I realized that you don't need fancy overhead. You need good mics, good amps, good pre-amps, and a team that knows what it can do in the space that they occupy. In the end, I really enjoyed the homey vibe of working at Mitchell's studio. Being able to step out of the studio and into a backyard courtyard with so much of the beautiful exotic flora of Southern California, amongst the company of friends and family was a peaceful relaxing experience; ironic considering the personal turmoil that my songs spoke to.\n\nConsidering the songs, I think about how I wrote \"Fly Away\" on piano but couldn't really play it well enough on record, so Carol Isaacs made it beautiful. I loved writing \"I Believe In Love\" on a ukulele I got from my only trip to Hawaii years earlier. Amy didn't play guitar on that song on the record, but she later came up with a guitar part so that we could play it live together, something we still do to this day. Even that is a learning experience; just because it wasn't a part on the record doesn't mean it can't be created later and played live. I also think that \"Last Tears\" was perhaps my most purely \"country\" song, made even more pure by Brandi's harmonies and Greg's pedal steel. I honestly thought about pitching that song to a country artist before I decided that I loved it enough to keep it for us.\n\nWe did our first photo shoot with Jeremy Cowart for Despite. Usually, I detest photo shoots. Jeremy is now one of the most well-known rock-n-roll photographers. We have used him ever since. He made me and Amy feel relaxed, and he took shots in cool locations. When I look at the photography from the album package, and the press shots and promo pieces, I think it's our best. For our extremely short-lived contract with Hollywood records, I feel proud that we delivered a very good record with an excellent package design and photography. Just as hearing those songs takes me right back, seeing the pictures does the same.\n\nAh, Southern California! Don't know what it is about that place that sucks me in!\n\nIt was a magical couple of months, with a supremely talented producer, where I learned, laughed, drank wine, suffered and basked in emotion, met fantastic new people and hung out with old friends, and turned in a good day's work. Maybe my best yet.\n\n**************************\n\n2005 entry posted 28 Jan 2016:\n\nES.2005\n\nIn 2005, my dad, Don Saliers, and I had our first collaborative book published. \"A Song to Sing a Life to Live\" was the culmination of many hours of conversation, ruminating on the relationship between music and spirituality. More specifically, Dad and I talked and talked together about the way in which music had shaped our own journeys as we sought to understand God and meaning.\n\nWhen we were first approached about writing a book together, which would be published by a mostly theological press, I was scared. I almost said no. As a queer person, I knew how much some organized religion had wounded, scarred, and even killed the spiritual life of many other queers. I knew all about Christian fundamentalists who called us sinners and cast us out, beat us up and even killed us. I knew that much of homophobia and oppression against gays was rooted in Christian or other orthodox belief. Religion was a bad word for many, and as an activist and gay person, I questioned my association with any kind of \"religion\" as it related to putting my thoughts out in public. I had always kept my faith private, even though my spiritual experience growing up was one of openness and questioning, certainly not dogmatic or oppressive or judgmental. And, I loved and respected my father who had spent his whole adult life as an ordained Methodist minister and professor of theology seeking ways to explain God's mercy and grace. He is a man who understands complexity. After I expressed my fears with Dad, who completely understood them, I just took a leap of faith and said yes and thought, \"let's just see where this goes.\"\n\nOne of the things we talked about together was how music was separated into categories of secular and sacred. We believed that the labeling of \"secular\" was limiting. We explored and expressed the deep humanity of Amy's and my nights of playing Little Five Points Pub in Atlanta. I would call it, in religious terms, the Church of the Motley Crew. There were so many different freaks and characters and glorious human beings who co-mingled at Little Five Points Pub. Punks and avant-gardes, blues musicians, rockers, and folk musicians joined each other on stage. Lesbians had a place to hang out together in public. It was the \"mixest\" of mixed crowds! It was music that joined us, melded us in our commonality, even as we celebrated our diversity. That was spiritual! Our spirits were lifted through music, and there were many people in those crowds who felt broken, troubled, and ostracized outside the doors of Little Five.\n\nDad talked about the influence of jazz in his love of improvisation. He brought his improv to church, where he often played interludes between hymn verses, or made up vocal harmonies or worked to integrate and weave themes or imagery throughout the worship service. All from jazz, \"secular.\" We learned a lot about labeling, how demeaning and limiting it can be when applied to music. We explored how a genre of music can reflect a community's unique experience of life and how vitriolic opposition to certain genres is a reflection of racism or generalization.\n\nI honestly don't care what anyone else believes or doesn't believe. But I know that music is undeniably central in our human search for meaning and belonging and getting in touch with mysteries.\n\nAfter the book was published, Dad and I began to do public performances, exploring the themes in the book. As an example, I would sing a sacred piece that Dad had written, perhaps a line from a psalm put to music, and Dad would become an \"Indigo Boy\" and sing some of Amy's parts or completely revise the feel and piano part of \"Power of Two\". We had a set list of Dad songs and Emily songs and hymns and classics, such as \"Wayfarin' Stranger\". Dad played Duke Ellington's \"Come Sunday\" and we even had a little Latin thrown in with \"Dona Nobis Pacem\" played to simple guitar chords. The experience of writing the book with Dad deepened my understanding of the role music plays in church and the role it plays outside of church and how intertwined those two realities are. The fact that an older intellectual, studied professor might be open to the spiritual power of contemporary urban rap made me love my dad even more.\n\nAmong other IG journeys that year was our trip with Ani DiFranco to Washington, D.C. to discuss nuclear power issues with legislators and staff people. Native American activists we had been working with through Honor the Earth accompanied us. Or, I should say, we accompanied them! There's a big difference between standing on Skull Valley Goshute land in Utah, scraggly weeds blowing in the wind, and pointing to the place where there is a proposed nuclear dump in the midst of a few homes and a small tribe of people, and sitting at a long table with a group of people in suits trying to describe the situation. Still, I believe it is important to lobby in D.C. and, as an artist, to stand in solidarity with Indian peoples whose lives and culture and history are poisoned by big energy interests. I have always found Ani to be inspiring, as she has stuck to her values and politics no matter what. It was great to join her on this trip. Solidarity is important in any justice movement. The environmental justice battles that so many Indian peoples have to fight are fierce and ongoing. Amy and I take part by singing and hopefully galvanizing support through music, by joining with other like- minded activists, and by going to D.C. to show human faces behind the issues.\n\nWe played many shows in 2005, but not as many as in other years, as Amy focused on her solo work, I had performances with Dad. During the shows we played, we had the great privilege of working with the band Three Five Human. Powerful, powerful band with the combination of Tomi's world-class guitar playing (he was later to be a musical director for Justin Bieber!) and Trina's vocals. Their version of \"Tether\" with us is my favorite version ever. I watched every show they played from the side of the stage and felt a comradery with them in all our interactions. They are deeply ingrained in my memory of the best IG opening bands.\n\nAR.2005\n\nBack at the end of 2005, I wrote a wrap-up for the year on Indigo Girls' web site, a rare moment of focus on our on-line world. It took a while for us to get up to speed and really start doing enough content and digital documentation, and we are still old dogs learning new tricks these days. But I think this one is pretty thorough and detailed, so here's the link.\n\n2005-08-23: Notes from Amy - indigogirls.com\n\nMy perspective has probably changed a bit. After all these years a few things really stand out about this year and still carry on into the present. The impact of Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath were more far reaching and devastating than we knew. Even years after its landfall, it still seems to be unfolding in many ways. A region and culture, population and landscape forever changed. I look at the month of August on my calendar now and see we were in the midst of 2 day Honor the Earth board meeting, talking about energy development, native youth initiatives, sacred sites protection, military toxins, and sustainable agriculture when the news started coming in from New Orleans and surrounding areas. The news was fragmented and abstract, and very disturbing, almost apocalyptic feeling. Quite literally only a days drive from where we were, yet seemingly completely cut off from the rest of the Nation and desperate for help, there were so many ways in which our infrastructure failed the whole region. I made my way home, via NYC, and a week later, we were on the bus for a tour. I remember our bus driver Rick Stott who had just seen some parts of the Highway 10 corridor, described the horrors of what he saw and heard from other truck drivers. Earlier in the month, Emily and I had joined Pink at Tree Sound Studios in Atlanta to record her song, \"Dear Mr. President\". The lyrics in the song are even more relevant in the context of Katrina and the Bush administration's failure to engage or even show appropriate emotional connection to the Gulf Region's communities. Recording this song with Pink is one of the highlights of our career. Billy Mann and Pink were golden; consummate professionals, I learned so much from watching her sing and just talking to her about her process.\n\nHow do you sleep while the rest of us cry?\n\nHow do you dream when a mother has n"
