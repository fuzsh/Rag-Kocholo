        "text": "We were just happy to have this music at home to listen to it. Reflecting the one and a half years or so of work that we have put into it. We were not under the illusion that this was going to lead somewhere. We were also very self-critical. We had no self-confidence at the time. We were beginners, we were very young, and we knew it was extremely unperfect, especially for that time. There was singers like Ronnie James Dio or whatever. We knew we could never reach something like that. We just wanted to have our music on a tape.\n\nIan Christie\n\nAt the same time you were producing newsletters and constantly redesigning artwork, band logos, and Iâm assuming consuming metal.\n\nTom Gabriel Warrior\n\nIt was our passion.\n\nIan Christie\n\nConsuming hard rock voraciously.\n\nTom Gabriel Warrior\n\nIt was our passion. It was our life. As I said earlier, we couldnât fit into anywhere and so we created our own little world that we understood and of course we gave all our time to it. We took it very serious, but we knew of course it was an underground niche. The myth that Hellhammer is nowadays has nothing to do with what it actually was. It was a sanctuary for us and that was really it.\n\nIan Christie\n\nItâs really remarkable compared to bands I would say in hard rock and in punk rock you have The Stooges, who were floating around lost in Ann Arbor, Michigan, but somebody like The Ramones they had management. They were in a media capital. Even The Ramones they were practically Liberace compared to what Hellhammer...\n\nTom Gabriel Warrior\n\nWell, where was I going to find a manager in NÃ¼rensdorf? Even in Zurich, weâre talking about 1982 or something. There was barely a music scene to speak of in Switzerland. There was a handful of venues. There wasnât really a scene specifically not for heavier music. For extreme music. There was a few punk bands that were quite fantastic, but thatâs the end of the scene. The managers we had here was for major commercial music. If I would have come with that little Hellhammer tape, I wouldnât have even gotten into the door. We didnât even consider that, there was simply no chance. It wasnât like today where you can Google âextreme metal management.â\n\nIan Christie\n\nRight. Go to YouTube and getting singing tips.\n\nTom Gabriel Warrior\n\nWe formed Prowling Death Management, which was the same people who were the band. There you go. By now of course Prowling Death Records is a real record company in London, but back then it was formed in my childhood bedroom. Proudly put on our fliers when it was really the same guys.\n\nIan Christie\n\nThe first hurdle that Hellhammer overcame, that you overcame, in your long career I think would have sent 99.99% of all people crying back to find another interest. To take up tennis or something. You sent the demo out and the reviews came in. How were the reviews for the Hellhammer demos?\n\nTom Gabriel Warrior\n\nWell, the people who actually bothered to write back hated it. Thatâs the truth. First of all, we sat at home going through our record collection writing down the addresses on the back of our favorite metal albums. Then we sent the demos there. Most of the people didnât waste the stamp on it to reply. Those who did said, âNo thanks. Thereâs no way.â There was only one record company in America, Metal Boy Records, who said, âWe see some kind of promise. If you do a better demo, maybe.â There was one Swiss record company at the time.\n\nIan Christie\n\nThat was enough, right? A tiny pinpoint of light.\n\nTom Gabriel Warrior\n\nThatâs better than nothing. There was a Swiss record company actually here on this street, Langstrasse, called Disc Trade. They wrote back that we should go practice. That we were miserable and that we should go practice and there was no chance. The reactions werenât really encouraging.\n\nIan Christie\n\nAt least you had the heavy metal press to turn back on, right? They were encouraging. Metal Forces. Wait a minute. There was a lot of negativity thrown that way, but...\n\nTom Gabriel Warrior\n\nThe thing is we realized relatively early on that the more radical the negative reactions were, the more interested people became. Thatâs probably an effect of the punk wave because punk opened the doors to anybody. For the normal consumer the punks couldnât really play. Having journalists writing that we cannot play and that weâre really extreme, but itâs shit. A certain fraction of the people who read that became interested because it sounded like some of the punk bands. Even though that wasnât the intention, it got us a lot of attention. We got letters from all over the world and who wanted to buy our demo and so on, and so on. That was the beginning of at least something.\n\nIan Christie\n\nWith broader exposureâ¦ Congratulations on persevering through some hellaciously negative reviews at the time.\n\nTom Gabriel Warrior\n\nWhat else was I supposed to do? There was nothing else.\n\nIan Christie\n\nGo work for the train company?\n\nTom Gabriel Warrior\n\nIt was too late by that time. I was going to become an aircraft mechanic, but by that time, no.\n\nIan Christie\n\nOnce again, this wasnât a path. You didnât have a choice. You were already on the path and thatâs what it was.\n\nTom Gabriel Warrior\n\nBy the time we did the second Hellhammer demo, I was giving up my apprenticeship, yeah.\n\nIan Christie\n\nWith your first trip as a band out of Switzerland to Berlin to record the Apocalyptic Raids EP, I think everything changed. It seems that thatâs when you realized what the next level of possibility was. Can you talk about the realization that Hellhammer was moribund and something new would have to be launched? Something new meaning Celtic Frost.\n\nTom Gabriel Warrior\n\nThe recording of the Hellhammer EP was a wake-up call. [coughs] Sorry. We felt the limits of what we were able to do. We realized we had to improve massively. The record company told us that. The press told us that. We knew it ourselves. Being in a studio with a real producer and being exposed to that environment was an utter wake-up call. There was no way around it. At least at the time.\n\nIan Christie\n\nIt was inspiring to be in a place where they had producers who knew somewhat what to do with you.\n\nTom Gabriel Warrior\n\nI would say intimidating. Well, it was inspiring of course, but as I said we knew the vehicle of Hellhammer had reached a limit. We wanted to do more than just that.\n\nIan Christie\n\nWith Celtic Frost, almost immediately you then became an international touring band. You were part of the thrash metal wave. You came through the same record labels as Slayer, Metallica, countless bands.\n\nTom Gabriel Warrior\n\nYouâre skipping.\n\nIan Christie\n\nIâm skipping a lot, but I donât want to force you to re-read your Only Death Is Real book basically.\n\nTom Gabriel Warrior\n\nYou could have just brought it.\n\nIan Christie\n\nI do have it. Yeah. It does not fit in a pocket. Very quickly you were on tour in the United States. You were meeting your contemporaries from Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Iâm curious, after being isolated in your musical infancy in Zurich, who did you feel comradeship and kinship with when you came out into the world? Or was it still Celtic Frost as isolated?\n\nTom Gabriel Warrior\n\nThatâs actually a very difficult question. It was probably bands we didnât meet like Sisters of Mercy and Bauhaus, things like that. Iâm really sorry about my voice going away. Iâve been dealing with a heavy cold for a few days and I have to practice like this. This is the result. I hope you can finish this thing. Weâll see. I sound like Lemmy. [laughs]\n\nIan Christie\n\nYeah, the whisky, please?\n\nTom Gabriel Warrior\n\nThat would probably help.\n\nIan Christie\n\nYouâre talking about bands that at the time I think wouldnât have given respect to heavy metal to even tour with the heavy metal bands. Sisters of Mercy.\n\nTom Gabriel Warrior\n\nWe tried many times. We tried, but it was impossible at the time. Yeah.\n\nIan Christie\n\nI wanted to know, this is a little bit of a tangent, but itâs a very important one. Heavy metal 30 years later is I would say very respected and almost fetishized and all of a sudden has many doorways open that werenât open back in 1985. Has the world changed, did everybody finally understands Hellhammer? Not just Hellhammer specifically, but this extreme, forceful, heavy way of thinking. Has the world changed and all of a sudden everybody gets it or is there a misunderstanding about the fundamental elements that create good heavy metal?\n\nTom Gabriel Warrior\n\nThe world has changed massively. What was extreme yesterday is no longer extreme. That has helped Hellhammer of course.\n\nIan Christie\n\nJumping into this era of Celtic Frost touring internationally, releasing incredibly influential records. Morbid Tales, To Mega Therion. Then giving full flight to your metal avant-garde tendencies, but really a wide musical palette on Into the Pandemonium. Iâm curious. What were some key moments of validation once the negativity and passion werenât the sole engines?\n\nTom Gabriel Warrior\n\nThatâs a good question. I think merely recording Morbid Tales was an enormous validation. Any of the first three albums anyway.\n\nIâm not somebody who puts my head in the sand. I inform myself whatâs going on with this planet. Whatâs going on, how we treat animals, how we treat the environment, and I cannot consciously support that, but thatâs just me. Apparently most other people can. I canât but Iâm not a missionary. Iâm not in the church. I donât tell you what to think. I also think as a musician you should be careful with political statements. Lifestyle statements. Iâm just a fucking musician. Who am I to tell people what to do? I know itâs normal in Hollywood, but not for me. If somebody asks me, I will explain myself, but Iâm not a lifestyle guru. I can only hope that if I say something in an interview that people will think about it. Not that they might not kill an animal to have it on their table, but thatâs really the extent of what I should say and what I can say. At the end of the day I was just the singer of Hellhammer and what does that mean in this world? Nothing.\n\nIan Christie\n\nThank you.\n\nTom Gabriel Warrior\n\n[Tom is given a drink] No, itâs fine. Well, youâre much nicer than my ex-wife. [laughs]\n\nIan Christie\n\nNow tea has materialized. This goes into the visual side of what youâve always done. There have been occult trappings and a lot of fascination with darkness. I think that in the world of extreme music thereâs notâ¦ The animal rights question that I asked was interesting because itâs an actual real world clue to your morality.\n\nTom Gabriel Warrior\n\nLook Ian. I feel extremely passionate about that. Extremely passionate. I could fucking torture to death any human being who harms an animal, but thatâs just me. I know for millennia itâs been normal for people to kill animals, so whoâs Tom Warrior from NÃ¼rensdorf to tell people to change? I just think we came pretty late in the history of the earth. These beings have been around here for much longer than us and we come here and we enslave everything just for our egotistical needs. We destroy the environment. We destroy our fellow beings just so we are happy. Iâve been a meat eater too when I was younger, but one day something set something in motion and when you think about it, itâs not sustainable. Not for my conscience. I want to be able to look into the mirror at the end of the day. I enjoyed meat. I enjoyed the taste of meat, but I donât enjoy pain, and suffering and torture. We donât even kill these animals with compassion. We kill them brutally and in a stressful environment as many animals as possible per day for profit and whatever. I cannot be a part of this, but this is me. I have no right to tell these people what to do, nor do I want to tell them what to do. All I can think is, âMaybe theyâll think of this eventually too like I did.â\n\nAs I said earlier, as a musician, what right do I have to tell people what kind of lifestyle choice? If I have any competence, itâs extreme music. I hate the politicians interfering with my life, so who is Tom Warrior to tell people what to do?\n\nIan Christie\n\nAnother area youâve shown competence in is the visual aspects of music packaging.\n\nTom Gabriel Warrior\n\nThatâs a nice way to skirt the issue.\n\nIan Christie\n\nNo. I think youâve sealed that issue with a strong period. I have nothing to add. Your vision for Hellhammer, Celtic Frost and now Triptykon has always included a strong visual component. You mentioned previously the lack of music industry infrastructure in Switzerland but you did benefit from having a countryman, Hans Rudy Giger, who also had followed his own individualistic path to create his own completely vast and incredible visual universe and creating many universes. Youâve had the great fortune of having your paths intertwine since Celtic Frostâs To Mega Therion album. Youâve worked with the man for many years up until his untimely passing.\n\nTom Gabriel Warrior\n\nWell Giger was one of the few people to actually take us serious. To our utter astonishment, he actually noticed Hellhammer. He listened to Hellhammer and he told me at least that he could see some parallels in his astonishing work to Hellhammerâs minute little work. I think maybe this was because Giger for a very long time was also shunned and laughed at, and was pushed to be underground in Switzerland. In fact, he was pushed into the underground until the very end. The leading art museum in the city will not show Giger to this very day. For them heâs just some kind of idiot who paints penises in black. When for the rest of the world heâs a genius artist. I think Giger could relate most of all because he was also an outcast.\n\nAt the time when we contacted him we didnât even have a record deal. We were nobodies and he was really the only person in Switzerland at the time, the only person that mattered, who took it serious. I can only attribute that to the fact that he was also an underground artist and not taken serious. We talked about that many years later and he confirmed that.\n\nIan Christie\n\nWhen was your first meeting with him? In the flesh, initially it was corresponding through the post.\n\nTom Gabriel Warrior\n\nThe initial meetings all took place by phone and by letters. There was quite a number of letters sent back and forth. I have all those letters still. The meeting only took place in the 2000s. We actually once met him before, but we didnât make ourselves known. We felt such respect for him we didnât want to disturb him. The actual real first meeting only took place in the 2000s. Before that it was just on the phone and by letters and everything. It was extensive, but not in the flesh. We were so grateful we didnât want to bother him, believe it or not.\n\nIan Christie\n\nWe talked about the Hellhammer bunker and the small world that you as a band created with sound, and music and kinship. You became part of the inner world of Giger and his wife at their home with all kinds of things going on. What kind of a role did you play and do you continue to play actually?\n\nTom Gabriel Warrior\n\nIâm still part of the Giger estate. What itâs called now, the Giger Workshop, which of course still exists. His art still exists. His museum still exist. His exhibitions still exist. And Iâm very fortunate to still be a part of that, which to me is an honor beyond description. There again is something that as a teenager looking at Gigerâs books and Gigerâs posters I never thought it would happen just like with Hellhammer.\n\nItâs a huge honor and I try whatever I can to contribute to Gigerâs work. I was fortunate enough to be invited to be the curator of the Giger photo exhibition thatâs taking place right now at his museum. I really donât know why this honor was bestowed upon me. I told Giger many times over the years how much he meant to me and he didnât want to hear it. He was a very modest person. Every time I tried to tell him what he meant to me and to Celtic Frost, he ran out of the room. He didnât want to hear it. It was uncomfortable for him. Then again on my side I donât know why Iâm there and I donât know why they chose me, but I feel very honored of course and Iâll do whatever I can to enhance Gigerâs legacy in my tiny way because heâs a genius and Iâm just Tom Warrior.\n\nIan Christie\n\nCan you shed a little light on what the Giger reality was like? If you went to see him maybe for an hour, youâd lose track of space and time.\n\nTom Gabriel Warrior\n\nOne of Gigerâs ex-girlfriends is in this room and I probably should not shit any light on Gigerâs daily existence. Giger was a very unique person and then if I would disclose anything of his private life, and Iâm not trying to make it artificially exciting, but if I would shed any light of his existence I would intrude into his privacy. I know a lot of people intrude into Gigerâs privacy. I donât want to be part of that. Giger was a very unique person. He lived a very unique life. You had to be somehow very tolerant to understand this and to accept this. I cannot betray his trust by disclosing this. He was, in his own way, very open in private and this is really not the place to disclose it just because heâs dead.\n\nIan Christie\n\nWell this is place for you to be open in public, so Iâll turn the spotlight back on you.\n\nTom Gabriel Warrior\n\nMy pathetic life compared to Giger, whoâs basically the Hieronymus Bosch of the 21st century, thatâs quite a difference. My life is irrelevant. Giger on the other hand will be known still in 1,000 years because he was a genius. Iâm not saying that because I worked with him or because I was a friend. I was fortunate enough for example to witness Giger one day in his kitchen sketching something on a napkin. Just by the way he carried his pen, the way he drew, you could notice immediately. He has a talent that Iâve never seen in anybody else. It was just really evident without any worshiping that heâs a genius. He carried the pen in such a way itâs beyond description. Then you realize this is not the ordinary thing. Compared to that, seriously, Iâm a nobody.\n\nIan Christie\n\nThank you. Your visual dexterity is very unique. Itâs very unusual that a bandâs member, a band leader, can set forth the visual style as youâve done over many records. During this century though youâve actually, and Iâve always assumed that, but Iâve never asked, maybe under the inspiration and encouragement of Giger, youâve begun to make sculpture and I notice youâre wearing jewelry of your own design. This is the Triptykon logo. Did you even tell him about that?\n\nTom Gabriel Warrior\n\nAbout what?\n\nIan Christie\n\nAbout Tom Warrior death masks.\n\nTom Gabriel Warrior\n\nI gave him one and of course I was under no illusion that my âartâ would amount to anything, but I gave him one just as a gift for his birthday one day many years ago. I gave him one of my death masks. One I really liked and I thought, you know, his house is filled with gifts by many people, musicians and artists, thereâs fantastic gifts there, and I thought, âMy stuff is just going to be the bottom of the pile,â but to my astonishment he told me to hang it up. He told me where and itâs quite a prominent place. Nobody was more astonished than me about that. My little ridiculous death masks are just a hobby of mine and Giger is an artist. I donât know if he did it because he felt sorry for me. Seriously Iâm not trying to artificially... He hung it up, so he knew that I was doing it. He professed that he liked it, but I donât know.\n\nI do these death masks because I was always fascinated ever since I was a child of death masks. There was a point in my life where I was wondering what my death mask would look like one day and I realized when Iâm dead Iâm not going to see it. So at the end of the 2007 Celtic Frost US tour Les Baron, Gigerâs agent in America, arranged for me to go to Fangoria magazineâs premises and they have a workshop there and a few friends of his took a life cast of me and enabled me with this life cast to do my own death mask. It was just a curiosity of mine for my own purpose. To my astonishment somebody wanted to buy death masks, and then two people wanted to buy a death mask, and then it became an art project.\n\nIn reality it was just some spleen of mine to use my face as a canvas like I do on stage. To see my death mask while Iâm still alive to see it. Thatâs really all there is to it. I am very careful with the word art both in my death masks or in music. Art is a huge word and in todayâs society art is massively overstretched. Everybody calls themselves an artist. To me art takes talent. Iâm quite unsure if I actually have talent. Seriously. If other people call my work art whether itâs music or my death masks, itâs flattering but I cannot really take it serious. Art to me is Dali, or Bosch, or Giger, but not Tom Fischer.\n\nIan Christie\n\nBecause your associations are so diverse, Iâd like to ask you... Youâre also very careful with the words friends, colleague, peer and inspiration. Iâd like to know in the realm of peer who are some people when you come into contact with them you feel completely free, and the fog has been lifted, and there is someone that has been through something and you see eye to eye?\n\nTom Gabriel Warrior\n\nWell, thereâs you for one thing.\n\nIan Christie\n\nI was not fishing for that.\n\nTom Gabriel Warrior\n\nOne person I feel is a peer and which is also astonishing to me is Kevin Heybourne from Angel Witch, who as a young teenager I worshiped. I had everything by Angel Witch. This band was a major influence to me. Many years later I was fortunate enough to meet him and we became friends. Itâs a friendship that lasts to this day. I know his life was far from easy too, which is probably something that connects us. Heâs very different to me. Heâs a very unique person. Kind of difficult to access, but in spite of that, I feel a strong connection to him. Should I live long enough weâll probably do an album together. Weâve talked about it. Thatâs somebody I look at as a peer.\n\nIan Christie\n\nWow. Bill Steer from Carcass has been playing in Angel Witch so all of a sudden this project starts to take shape.\n\nTom Gabriel Warrior\n\nBill never talks to me. Iâve met him a million times with Angel Witch. Heâs always in the background not saying a word. I donât know whatâs his problem.\n\nIan Christie\n\nHis problem is heâs an incredibly shy person.\n\nTom Gabriel Warrior\n\nThatâs a shame. He looks fantastic. Heâs a fantastic guitar player.\n\nIan Christie\n\nFantastic guitar player.\n\nTom Gabriel Warrior\n\nHe used to be a fantastic member of Angel Witch. Itâs a shame.\n\nIan Christie\n\nWell, heâs wasting his time with this death metal stuff.\n\nTom Gabriel Warrior\n\nIâm glad you said that.\n\nIan Christie\n\nWhen you look down the tendrils of time into the bands and acts of today, maybe in your estimation Dark Throne is a younger band but theyâve been around 25 years now already or 30 actually. What lights up? What are some bands or some modes of operating as a heavy band that give you a little... Iâm not going to say faith in tomorrow. Iâm not going to put that burden on you, but where you see some fire today?\n\nTom Gabriel Warrior\n\nYouâre really asking me very difficult questions.\n\nIan Christie\n\nI came a long way to ask you these questions.\n\nTom Gabriel Warrior\n\nIâm generally very disillusioned with todayâs scene. Maybe thatâs a factor of my age and Iâm sorry about that but fortunately or unfortunately I was born in 1963 and because of that I was a witness to at least two periods that were extremely exciting and the kind of music that we talked about, heavy rock, heavy metal. One was the 1970s. The other one was the early 1980s.\n\nHaving lived through that time and having that time influence my life significantly, I find it extremely difficult to find something thatâs equally inspiring nowadays. Now maybe that makes me sound old, but youâre asking me for my personal opinion and unfortunately thatâs it. I wish it was different. Honestly. Sometimes I listen to these modern bands and theyâre all perfect beyond description. Theyâre much more perfect than any bands. We all wanted to be so perfect in the early â80s but we couldnât. Nowadays even the youngest musicians are so perfect.\n\nSometimes I wonder is that really the goal of heavy music? Maybe itâs the goal of jazz but heavy music to me is always anarchy, revolution, energy. I miss that in all the technical perfection and the technical perfection is even enhanced by computer technology in the studio. I wonder is that really the purpose of heavy music? To me itâs not. To me heavy music is passion. Itâs a fire. And if you play a mistake, fuck it.\n\nUnfortunately nowadays, at least the albums I hear they are produced to death and most of it is recorded directly into the computer. I like albums where you actually hear the air between the amp and the microphone. Where you hear the drums screeching. The screws on the drums. You donât hear that anymore. Thereâs a couple of modern bands that I like. Like Wounded Kings, or Scorpion Child, or Orchid, but what are these bands doing? Theyâre basically recreating music that existed in the â70s. Itâs not really modern metal per se. Maybe that reflects poorly on me or it reflects poorly on the current metal scene. I donât know. Iâm not the person to make that judgment, but thatâs the way I see it and I miss it hugely. I miss hearing albums with fire. Albums with some kind of dirt. With imperfections but with perfection in passion. I miss that. Thereâs a competition going on between guitar players. How many notes you can play in a minute and how perfect you can play that? How fast and how complicated your albums can be.\n\nLook at Obscura for example who are a phenomenal band, but what is the purpose? Is it the Olympics of heavy metal or are we talking about heavy, metal? Thatâs a question I pose to myself. Maybe Iâm an old fart. I know that, but Iâve spent an entire life in the scene and Iâm very passionate about it. I wish all of the young people playing music nowadays would just fucking thrash a guitar from time to time. Throw over a stack of Marshalls like I did it, because thatâs really the essence of that music. Not playing 10,000 notes perfectly. I have huge respect for that, but thatâs not all there is to it. If you want to do that, go to a university. To me personally, thereâs no place for that on the heavy metal stage. Thatâs why I went to do heavy metal.\n\nIan Christie\n\nAs you mentioned, being a little kid when Deep Purple played here in Zurich and seeing on television the news reports of mayhem, and fires and bottles smashed everywhere, and the kids just running wild when they heard this.\n\nTom Gabriel Warrior\n\nI said that many times tonight. My opinion is just my opinion and my opinion is heavily shaped by my fucked up youth. I know other people had a much more perfect youth and probably have a much more balanced view of how things should be. I grew up very fanatically, very radically, and of course that translates into the way I approach music. Everything I say is of course to be taken with a grain of salt. I know people are not Tom Warrior, and thatâs fine, but thatâs why heavy metal attracted me. There was some anarchy in it.\n\nIf I wanted perfection I could have gone to some political party where everythingâs by the book. Or I could have become a tax advisor or a banker because everything there is by the book and the more perfect you are, the better you are. Iâm into heavy metal because thereâs anarchy and because there you can actually smash a fucking guitar. I really miss that. I miss when heavy metal was like that. Itâs become as sterile as so many other things now in our times and I think thatâs a shame. Even punk nowadays is fucking designed. Whatâs wrong with people?\n\nIan Christie\n\nYou just opened the door for me to ask you about the unexpected âBlood Insanityâ 7\", a new release by Hellhammer in 2016. How did that come about? What was your intention?\n\nTom Gabriel Warrior\n\nWe were totally passionate in the early â80s about 7\" singles by new wave British heavy metal bands. Of course our unfulfilled dream was to release a 7\" just like that. Nobody wanted to give us a record deal. Nobody took us serious, and we didnât have the money, and we couldnât even buy strings or guitar picks. That single remained a dream. We drafted a little memo where it stated all the details about such a single, but there was no way we could have realized such a single.\n\nNowadays Iâm the owner of a record company in England and I have a name in the industry and I just need to call up some people and say, âLetâs do a single,â and they say, âYes.â At a certain point in time I thought, âWhy donât I do the single now?â I called up Bruce Day and Steve Warrior from Hellhammer. I said, âWhat do you think if we do the single now just so it exists while weâre still alive?â and they were enthusiastic so we said, âOK, letâs do it.â\n\nWe did on our own label and it was distributed by Sony, which is incomprehensible for Hellhammer but thatâs how it is nowadays. My work of 34 years in between has made this possible. Itâs just a little personal spleen. This single doesnât make us rich. There was a lot of people that said, âOh, now heâs making money from Hellhammer.â Itâs bullshit. This single is limited to 3,000 issues. It was hugely expensive in its creation. The single yielded peanuts as far as money is concerned. The purpose of the single was to see it existing while we are still existing. It was a little personal spleen for us to have a Hellhammer single while weâre still alive because that was our dream in 1983. Thatâs really the entire story of that single.\n\nIan Christie\n\nSomething in between Girlâs School and Holocaust in the 7\" filing bin.\n\nTom Gabriel Warrior\n\nI would rather file it between Aragorn and Venom. Eric Keller will agree to that.\n\nIan Christie\n\nWell, you just gave a shout out to a distinguished professor, a PhD who came out of the Hellhammer bunker. I was going to ask you that earlier and I am curious. What happened to this gang? Whereâs the Hellhammer gang? Where are the Bassersdorf kids today? All these years later did they all die in motorcycle accidents or horrible drug-related deaths or have they all gone on to unique...\n\nTom Gabriel Warrior\n\nI really donât know.\n\nIan Christie\n\nWhere are Bruce Day and Steve Warrior for example?\n\nTom Gabriel Warrior\n\nBruce Day has a scuba diving school in Indonesia. Steve Warrior lives not far from here in Zurich. Heâs had a very difficult life after Hellhammer. I really donât want to go too far with that because itâs his private life. Heâs doing reasonably okay nowadays. We are in contact, but he canât play bass anymore.\n\nBruce Day occasionally tours as a road manager for quite well known bands but he doesnât play an instrument anymore. As for the other bands who attended our rehearsals, I know some of them still, but some of them also, at least for me, they got lost in the haze of time unfortunately. Even so, without wanting to sound nostalgic, I carry these people in my thoughts all the time. Thereâs never a moment when I work with Triptykonâ¦ For example, when we were onstage in Wacken [Open Air Festival], which is probably the pinnacle of what you can achieve with the music that we were playing, these people are always part of me and my roots are always a part of me. Iâm never detached from that. I always have to see that experience in the Hellhammer bunker in my mind. Always. I am never tempted to be on some kind of star trip. I would have never been on that Wacken stage three times without these people. Some of those people were extremely instrumental. One of those people bought me my first Iceman guitar, which is a guitar type that I still play to this day. They gave their money, their time to make Hellhammer, and later Celtic Frost, huge. Again, Tom Warrior wouldnât exist without these people [points to audience] and the people we were talking about right now. Even at the moment when Iâm onstage in Wacken I think of these people and thatâs really the truth. I have no illusions about my own talent. I know very well that I would not be on such a platform without these people. Even if I donât know what theyâre doing nowadays, some of those.\n\nIan Christie\n\nI think the status of the Hellhammer bunker where so many of these events went down, if I understood correctly, the building... It was underneath a kindergarten, first off. Death metal and black metal had its...\n\nTom Gabriel Warrior\n\nIt was a kindergarten underneath a kindergarten.\n\nIan Christie\n\nUnder a kindergarten. A romper room under it.\n\nTom Gabriel Warrior\n\nThat took you a while.\n\nIan Christie\n\nThe building was demolished a few years ago and a new building was built, so of course youâd think itâs lost. Thereâs no more bunker. As it turns out, the bunker survived.\n\nTom Gabriel Warrior\n\nI think the actual bunker survived. They replaced the building above it, but in doing so they dismantled part of the bunker and I saved some of the stones of the Hellhammer bunker. I have them actually framed at home. Thatâs how important that place was to me. This was the bunker where we created the Hellhammer demo, Apollyon Sun, the Apocalyptic Raids EP. Where we formed Celtic Frost, where we wrote To Mega Therion. Where we wrote Into the Pandemonium. Of course I went there with my mountain bike and I filled my pockets with rubble from the part of the bunker they disassembled. I could not bear seeing it go. I had to preserve that because to me my entire life took shape in that place.\n\nIan Christie\n\nSo thank you very much for attending a once in a lifetime opportunity to hear...\n\nTom Gabriel Warrior\n\nTo hear me screech. [laughs]\n\nIan Christie\n\nTo hear a man known for his deep gravely voice use it to express the vast thoughts inside of that mind. Thank you, thank you Tom. [applause]"
