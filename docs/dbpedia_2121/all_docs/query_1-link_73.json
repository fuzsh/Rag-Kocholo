        "text": "What a weird way to end the year…\n\nWe’ve got a few remaining stragglers that need to find their seats on the 2023 year-end eligibility bus (unfortunately, Garth Brooks & Ronnie Dunn will be left in the terminal unless I can find a way to hear “Rodeo Man” in the next few days), and by sheer chance these are mostly a bunch of throwbacks to my plagiarism article from a month ago, with artists “interpolating” past works for a quick buck and a shot of hype here in the present. Do any of them hold up against their inspirations, or are they cheap knockoffs that would have been better left on the shelf? There’s only one way to find out…\n\nJason Aldean, “Let Your Boys Be Country”\n\nQuick question for Mr. Aldean: Have you ever actually listened to “Mammas Don’t Let Your Babies Grow up to Be Cowboys”? Because there’s a “don’t” in there that’s doing a lot of work, and it means that your song has the exact opposite message of the song that you stole the hook from. (Heck, there’s even a direct contradiction of the subject of vehicles, with Aldean imploring people to “let ’em ride ’round in trucks” while Waylon Jennings and WIllie Nelson caution listeners against letting them “drive them old trucks.”)\n\nPerhaps such a reversal would be okay if you were pulling a Kitty Wells and dropping an all-time clapback answer track, but this is just a generic rural glorification song filled with buzzwords and close-minded thinking. You’ve got the beer, the trucks, the Friday nights, the red dirt, the back roads, the hunting, the small town girls, the allusion to older (and better) songs…it’s just a bonfire and a brand-name whiskey away from filling up the whole blasted bingo card. Even worse, it’s got shortsighted lines like “let everything inside these county lines be his whole world” and “tell ’em there ain’t nothing greener than the grass you’re standing on right here,” actively discouraging people to go out, experience the wider world, and decide for themselves where the greenest grass is. Not only are you advocating for stunting the potential growth of these kids, but it’s really hard to convince people that you’re an authority on “country” when you’ve got hard-rock guitars blaring behind you from start to finish, creating an indistinguishable wall of noise and drowning out the steel guitar and everything else in the arrangement.\n\nAldean doesn’t put the force behind his voice that he’s had on past releases, but there’s a lot of aggression in the sound here, and with Aldean’s more-militant stance on “Try That In A Small Town” still ringing in our ears, “let your boys be country” feels less like a suggestion and more like a demand coming from him. He’s just not the right person to be delivering a track like this, and frankly, this track isn’t worth delivering at all.\n\nRating: 3/10. Nope.\n\nMatt Stell, “Breakin’ In Boots”\n\nThe opening line might be the hook from John Anderson’s “Straight Tequila Night,” but don’t be fooled: This is a much less interesting story about a serial heartbreaker who will…”leave your heart breakin’ in boots”? What exactly does that even mean? It doesn’t have a clever double meaning, and the idea of breaking in a pair of shoes has exactly zero to do with what’s going on here—it’s as if the writers thought it was so clever that they had to use it, despite the fact that it makes no sense. The song has the same “guy thinking about hitting on a girl” setup as Anderson’s track, but that’s where the similarities end. For one thing, the characters here are flatter and less compelling, with the with the picker-upper coming across as a generic dudebro looking for nothing more than a good time, and the object of their affection being a “cowboy killer” known for showing folks said good time and then walking away without a second thought. There’s no tragic backstory or romantic aspirations that might get us to root for the folks involved, and Stell himself sounds really sleazy when the song pushes him into his lower range (especially when it forces him to drag out words at the end of verses). I’m not a huge fan of the sound either: I think the tempo is a bit too fast and the drums push the song a bit too much, when the listener really could use time to reflect on what’s supposed to be a cautionary tale (also, we get yet another wall of noise on the chorus as the harder guitars and drums pair up to drown out everything else). All in all, this is a nothingburger that I’ll probably forget exists by the time I get around to my year-end lists.\n\nRating: 5/10. *yawn*\n\nHIXTAPE ft. Post Malone, “Pickup Man”\n\n…Okay, I have some questions.\n\nFirst of all, aside from the name recognition and crossover potential, what the heck is Post Malone doing here? This is the first time I’ve really listened to any of his work, and he’s a subpar vocalist at best, one who struggles to maintain his tone and sounds downright hoarse at times on this track, even on parts of the song that present very little technical challenge. (His flow is pretty rough at times too, which is surprising because isn’t this dude supposed to be a rapper in his day job?) The Joe Diffie recordings used here are from the mid-2000s, and it’s telling that even without his peak-90s fastball, he can still sing Malone under the table. (I still might take Malone over HARDY trying to sing this song, though.)\n\nSecond, aside from the obvious capitalization on their CMA Awards collaboration, what exactly was the point of releasing this song? On the surface, there’s a lot to like here (it’s an actual cover of the original song instead of a cheap derivative, and the production mimics the neotraditional sound and fun vibes of the ’94 original better than it has any right to), but it just begs the question: Why? If you’re going to copy the original track so closely that you have Diffie himself sing half the song posthumously à la “Tear In My Beer,” why would you ever choose to listen to this version over the original, especially when ’94 Diffie is so much better than ’23 Malone? It’s not a bad song, but it feels less like a heartfelt tribute and more like a cash grab to exploit the purchasing power of Post Malone’s fan base, and with the OG track residing comfortably on my iPad, I probably won’t revisit this cover much. It’s better than you might expect, but not good enough to unseat the original or make you remember it in six months.\n\nRating: 5/10. It exists, I guess.\n\nLady A, “Love You Back”\n\nThis is the lone entry that doesn’t have an obvious pre-existing inspiration (although that title is reminiscent of one of my favorite Easton Corbin songs), and honestly it’s probably the best of the bunch here. It’s the opposite of “Pickup Man” in the sense that it’s got a bunch of things got work against it rather than for it, and yet it succeeds more than it fails. I generally don’t like tracks that trade on nostalgia and I’m forever telling artists to just get over it already in the face of a breakup, but this one at least has some self-awareness in it: The good times were so good that they can’t let them go, but they know they have to because the feelings are one-sided (“a memory can’t love you back,” which is…okay, as far as hooks go) and they’re holding them back from what they really want in a long-term relationship. The level of detail is high enough to let listeners see just what the memories are all about, as well at what those memories are causing them to miss out on. The mix sounds pretty neutral overall despite the regular minor chords, but it’s got the sort of reflective vibe that the subject matter is looking for, and it builds to a natural climax as the song progresses. I also really like how the mandolin is given the spotlight at the very beginning, as it does a good job catching the listener’s ear and signaling the distinctiveness of the sound (even if it ultimately boils down to the same guitars, drums, and keyboards as everyone else). Charles Kelley and Hillary Scott remain capable vocalists who who do a nice job selling the story here (I actually get some “Need You Now” vibes from it, but this song appears far later in the timeline of a relationship), and together with Dave Haywood they put together some solid harmony work for the chorus. It’s been a while since we’ve heard from Lady A in any meaningful capacity, so it’s nice to know they can still throw together a decent effort to help break through the current radio malaise.\n\nRating: 6/10. It’s worth a few spins to see what you think.\n\nIt’s been a while since a song has made me feel this old.\n\nIn a world without Blake Shelton or Morgan Wallen, HARDY would probably be the biggest villain of this blog: Even as I praised his Lainey Wilson collab “wait in the truck,” I noted that:\n\n“HARDY has been responsible for some of the biggest tire fires in country music over the last last few years. He claimed the 2019 worst-song title with “REDNECKER,” he was a driving force behind the worst two songs of 2021 (he was a vocalist on “The Worst Country Song Of All-Time” and a co-writer of “Come Back As A Country Boy”), and he’s a co-writer on [2022’s] second-worst song as well.”\n\n—”Kyle’s Top 10 Country Singles of 2022,” Dec. 23 2022\n\nThe man with the ALL CAPS stage name and song titles has now returned to leave his mark on 2023 with “TRUCK BED,” the second official radio single from his recent album the mockingbird & THE CROW, and…honestly, the word that comes to mind when I listen to this thing is “basic.” There just isn’t much to any piece of this track, and thus it’s just not that interesting or enjoyable to listen to.\n\nFrom a production standpoint, Wikipedia indicates that the mockingbird & THE CROW has released more rock singles than country singles, and you can kind of tell by the sound we get here. Things start simply enough with a slick electric guitar, but the song’s unorthodox chord structure and use of an echoey whistle gives the mix a very unsettled and uncomfortable feel, and while you could argue that it accurately reflects the narrator’s situation and state of mind, it’s not terribly pleasant to listen to. The synthetic beat adds to the arrangement’s cold, off-putting vibe, the real drums that join it don’t seem to help matters…and then HARDY starts screaming, the heavy metal guitars jump in, and suddenly the song turns into an off-brand Godsmack album cut, completely wiping out whatever atmosphere had been established up to that point. I get the sense that whoever produces this drivel had no idea what to do with the song and just tossed things at the wall to see if they would stick, and the result is an inconsistent sound that doesn’t give the listener any reason to tune in to the track.\n\nHARDY is caught is a similarly-awkward position, seemingly unsure of whether to frame the narrator as sad, angry, clueless, understanding, or all of the above. In the end, what we get is a mostly-neutral performance that doesn’t rely illuminate the speaker’s true feelings at all (even when he starts channeling his inner metal artist and screams out the opening of the last two choruses, it feels devoid of actual passion, like he was just blindly following the guitar’s lead). He completely fails to make the narrator likeable or relatable in any way, and comes across as a garden-variety loser who, in his own words, “got what I deserve”: He drank this relationship to death, and he’s paying for it like he should. (Noticeably absent from his delivery is any sense of regret for his actions, as he seems to be more annoyed by the fact that a bird is disturbing him than the fact that whatever relationship he had is over.) Somebody call Frank Drebin, because as far as HARDY goes, there’s nothing to hear here.\n\nThe opening lines tell you pretty much everything you need to know about this song:\n\nI woke up on the wrong side of the truck bed this morning\n\nWith a bone dry bottle of Jack I was pouring\n\n“You don’t get any closer to today’s beer-truck meta than this situation, and it doesn’t get any better from here (seriously, the whole “bag of corn as pillow and camo jacket as blanket” part is about as forced an injection of “country” buzzwords as I’ve heard in a long time). The narrator got drunk against their partner’s wishes, said partner locked them out of the house, the narrator is stuck sleeping in their car that night, and that’s pretty much it. Honestly, the entire track says so little that it feels like nothing more than a vehicle to use the “wrong side of the truck bed” hook that’s neither as clever or catchy as the writers think. You could argue that the writers are trying to be over-the-top in their approach, but if so, much like “REDNECKER,” it’s another example of HARDY trying to tell a joke that isn’t that funny: “That f***ing bird” line might draw a slight smirk from the listener, and that’s it. Throw in the sheer repetitiveness of the chorus and how it dominates the song, lines that don’t even fit the beat (stretching that “she meant bizzzz-nesss” line the way it did just felt bizarre), and confusing lines like “at least I took my boots off this time” (…Should I be congratulating you? What does that line even mean?), and you’re left with lyrics that feel lazy and slapdash, and a song that seems like it was thrown together in fifteen minutes.\n\n“TRUCK BED” is par for the course for Michael Hardy at this point, which means that it’s not much of a song. The writing is poorly-constructed and overreliant on tropes and exactly one instance of worplay, the production is awkward, inconsistent, and doesn’t fit the song at all, and HARDY is the same unsympathetic, uninteresting character that he usually portrays. I still like “wait in the truck,” but on balance I think this man is doing more harm than good in country music right now, and he either needs to step up his game or cede the floor to better artists. The next time he wakes up “on the wrong side of the truck bed,” that truck should be parked far, far away from Nashville.\n\nRating: 4/10. Nope.\n\nIf you’re going to pull me away from Splatoon 3 on its launch day, you’d better have a good reason…but for once in his life, HARDY might have one.\n\nUp to this point, HARDY has been a plague on the house of country music, responsible for some of the hottest garbage we’ve seen over the last few years as both a performer (“REDNECKER,” “The Worst Country Song Of All Time,”) and as a writer (“Up Down,” “Hell Right,” “Come Back As A Country Boy”). As bad as he’s been, however, some semblance of redemption is never more than a song away, as a great tune can stand on its own merits regardless of who happens to be behind the mic. Michael Ray (the man behind junk such as “Think A Little Less” and “One That Got Away”) proved this earlier in the year with “Holy Water,” and now HARDY might have his own diamond in the rough, teaming up with Lainey Wilson for the presumed leadoff single for his next project, “wait in the truck.” The song is a dark tale of violence and retribution, the sort of tale that’s tailor made for a country song, and all of the pieces come together to create something that’s simultaneously unsettling and satisfying.\n\nFirst, let’s talk about the production, which does a nice job creating such a potent atmosphere with such a sparse arrangement. The primary melody driver here is an acoustic guitar with a darker, no-nonsense tone, and aside from an unobtrusive drum set and a few carefully-placed synth tones, that’s pretty much all you get. Less can be more, however, and I’m impressed at how potent an atmosphere this mix creates, calling back to the guitar solos of old Western movies to create an image of the solitary white-hatted vigilante enforcing their own code of justice. (Eventually a backup choir is called in to give the song some volume and power—not to mention a spiritual feel—but by then the story is mostly told, and the morally-ambivalent ending and request for forgiveness makes this feel like a fitting closer.) By creating such a strong atmosphere with such a small arrangement, it allows the sound to stay out of the way of the writing and keep the focus on the story. Honestly, I think it’s the chord structure that impresses me the most: How the heck did the producer create something this foreboding without using any minor chords? (The answer is apparently special tuning, slash chords, and added tone chords, but that’s a bit above my pay grade.) It’s an impressively-constructed mix that does exactly what it’s supposed to and nothing it shouldn’t, and one can only hope that HARDY’s team takes note of this style in leans into this direction more in the future.\n\nSpeaking of HARDY, can the guy behind “REDNECKER” really sound credible on a serious song with blood on the floor? Actually, yes: He’s positioned himself as a bro’s bro up to this point, and killing an abusive partner sight unseen is exactly the kind of straightforward, eye-for-an-eye response that the bro code demands when a wrong has been committed. All you really have to believe is that the narrator has enough of a sense of honor to go through with it, and HARDY’s emotionless demeanor helps seal the deal: They neither excited or repulsed by what they’re doing—it’s just what they feel they have to do. I’m torn on Wilson’s presence on the track: It allows us to get the perspective of both the victim and the vigilante, but I don’t feel like the perspective actually adds anything to the story here. This is partially the writing’s fault for not taking the opportunity to provide any backstory or other details, but Wilson’s delivery also feels a little too even-keel from someone who just went through a traumatic experience. Still, just making her a non-silent protagonist helps add a bit more punch to the story, so I suppose it was a chance worth taking. Overall, this was a solid effort from both artists, and they do a nice job selling the story to the audience.\n\nOkay, let’s talk about this story! Much like Taylor Swift’s “no body, no crime,” the narrator here finds themselves privy to an unsavory situation (in this case, domestic abuse), and takes it upon themselves to remedy it by killing the perpetrator. Unlike Swift’s song, however, there’s no deception at play: The narrator asks few questions, does the deed, accepts the consequences, and finds a life sentence a small price to pay for getting someone out of a bad situation. Despite the murder ballad’s reputation as a country staple, you don’t hear too many of them on the radio today, and I really like how this song sets up the story: We get exactly the level of detail we need to visualize the scenes, and the narrator’s insight into their thought process helps make them an understandable and even sympathetic character. (They never explicitly tell you they’re doing it because it has to be done, but the way they leap into action and then just wait for the other shoe to drop tells the audience everything they need to know.) I don’t condone violence in a situation like this, and the narrator’s decision feels a bit rash the more you think about it (maybe they should have gotten the victim some medical attention?), but at least we understand why certain decisions were made and why things turned out the way they did. It’s a gripping tale that keeps the listener engaged from start to finish, and I wish more story songs like this one (…okay, maybe with a little less violence) would find their way to mainstream radio.\n\nI didn’t think HARDY had a song like “wait in the truck” in him, but in a year of unexpected surprises this might be the biggest one of all. The producer sets the mood, the writing keeps us on the edge of our seats, and HARDY and Lainey Wilson tell a credible tale of how everything went down. It’s hands-down the best song I’ve heard in 2022, and while it may not be enough to save what’s been a tire fire of a year on mainstream radio, I hope it’s something that both HARDY and Wilson can build on, and if it does well (unlike Swift’s single), maybe Nashville will start thinking about adding a bit more grit and substance to their offerings.\n\n…Yeah, I don’t think it will happen either, but a person can dream, can’t they?\n\nRating: 8/10. Believe it or not, you don’t want to miss this one.\n\nBeer has never been this boring.\n\nDespite an illustrious career that’s spanned nearly twenty years, Dierks Bentley has never been able to grab a spot on country’s coveted A-list, and isn’t mentioned in the same breath as Bryan, Aldean, Rhett, or Thanos when someone lists the genre’s current stars. Part of this is by choice, as Bentley has been unafraid to sacrifice his Q rating in the name of passion projects (his bluegrass album in 2010, his Hot Country Knights alter ego in 2020), but part of this has been a noticeable inconsistency in his mainstream releases, with a periodic drift towards mainstream blandness (such as his previous single “Gone,” or most of his 2016 album Black). Unfortunately, despite teaming up with the genre’s flavor-of-the-month HARDY (hasn’t he ruined enough songs lately?) and the genre-blending artist BRELAND (good grief, not more all-caps names), Bentley finds itself stuck in the same old rut with his new release “Beers On Me,” a paint-by-numbers snoozefest whose only value is as a PSA for sobriety.\n\nThe production here is a limp, lifeless mix that works against the ultimate goals of the track instead of supporting them. Stop me if you’ve heard this one before: This is same old guitar-and-drum mix that everyone else leans on, and outside of a steel guitar that buried in the background and barely audible, that’s pretty much all you get. With its simple riffs, neutral tones, and slower pace, the sound winds up feeling incredibly heavy and lethargic, and lacks any of the punch, groove, or energy that might catch a listener’s ear and draw them into the story. Instead, the vibe is dull and gray, and makes the song feel like more of an extension of the listener’s daily slog rather than an escape from it. In turn, it makes the audience skeptical of the song’s offer: Why would they go to a bar and drink themselves into a stupor when the experience sounds this boring, and they could go do nearly anything else and have more fun? In other words, this mix is a terrible choice for the song, and it makes the track more of a grind to get through than it already is.\n\nMy first question about is vocal is this: Who on earth thought it was a good idea to put three singers on this track? It’s only written for a single performer, and neither HARDY nor BRELAND add any value to the song with their presence. (At least BRELAND’s not-quite-a-rap breakdown on the bridge is ultimately a wash; HARDY’s irritating persona/baggage and weak, disinterested delivery do more harm to the song than good.) There aren’t any technical issues with Bentley’s performance, but his lack of energy and enthusiasm makes him sound like he’s reading the lyrics off of cue cards and would rather be anywhere else in the world than the bar he’s supposed to be touting. He sounds like he’s trying to dissuade people from joining him instead of persuading them (which, to be fair, would be exactly what I’d sound like if I knew I would have to pay for everyone that showed up). The overall level of apathy on this track is just astounding, and if the listener is still awake by the time it’s over, they’re left wondering “If these three can’t be bothered to care about this track, then why should I?” A charismatic performer like Bentley should never be this boring or uninvested, and whoever let this slide as an album cut (much less a single) should be embarrassed.\n\nThe lyrics here are about as simple and cookie-cutter as you could get: The narrator’s buying, so bring your troubles to the bar and beer yourself to death because “the beer’s on me” (the fact that the title is missing the apostrophe bugs me far more than it should). Once again, alcohol gets pitched as a snake-oil cure for all of life’s troubles, and this time they don’t even bother to make the pitch that the experience will be fun or exciting (we get one line about “feel-good standard time,” and that’s it). In general, the writing is really bad here: We’ve got a lame “that’s on you, ’cause the beer’s on me” hook that’s neither witty or clever, groan-inducing lines like “leave the sweatin’ to the beer” and “I like my drinks like my roof: On the house,” and even some sleazy-sounding stuff like “I could be your sponsor if you like how that sounds.” (Spoiler alert: We don’t.) With their exclusive focus on beer, the lyrics don’t even offer the usual generic amenities to the listener: We hear nothing of music, dancing, or even the shoulder of a fellow patron to cry on. With so many places from so many other songs that offer a better atmosphere and more things to occupy your time, why would you ever waste your time at a place like this? You wouldn’t, and you shouldn’t bother with this halfhearted sales pitch either.\n\nI’ve heard a lot of drinking songs in my time, but they’re rarely botched as badly as “Beers On Me” is. Everyone from the writers to the singers to the producers just goes through the motions here, leaving us with a hollow shell of a track that all the lager in the world could never fill. No one walks away from this mess looking good, least of all Dierks Bentley and his all-caps collaborators BRELAND and HARDY, and the best thing I can say is that if they’re lucky, no one will remember this drivel even exists in a few months. Bentley remains an effective artist when he’s really invested in the material, so if this is the most feeling that he can muster for a radio single, maybe he should stick to his passion projects instead.\n\nRating: 4/10. Next!\n\nWell, at least they’re being honest with us.\n\n2020 turned out to be a rough year for Brantley Gilbert: After his #1 collaboration with Lindsay Ell “What Happens In A Small Town” generated some badly-needed momentum for his career (it was his first #1 since 2015), he proceeded to squander every last bit of it, with “Fire’t Up” stalling outside the Top 40 and “Hard Days” barely cracking the Top 30 on Billboard’s airplay chart. Apparently Gilbert decided he needed to take a big swing to get back into the country music conversation, because he and Valory closed the book on the Fire & Brimstone era, brought in HARDY (Mr. “REDNECKER”) and Toby Keith (Mr. Irrelevant), and dropped “The Worst Country Song Of All Time” on us, a backwards attempt at an “I’m so country!” song by trying to tell us what isn’t country. The irony is that though the title is intended to be tongue-in-cheek, the song is exactly as bad as advertised: It’s a lazy, ignorant, exclusionary track with a reheated Bro-Country sound and some truly terrible vocal performances from all three singers involved. It’s not the worst country song of all time, but there’s a pretty good chance it winds up as the worst country song of 2021.\n\nFor a song that’s trying so hard to differentiate itself from its peers, its production is disappointingly cookie-cutter. From its hard-rock electric guitars, deliberate tempo, and in-your face percussion (which is mostly real rather than synthetic this time), this unimaginative drivel sounds like a rejected mix from the Bro-Country era. (The dobro fills the role of the token banjo, and is buried so deep in the background that it’s hardly noticeable.) The one deviation from the script is handing the bridge solo over to a saxophone (which one performer labels a “tube whistle” for no reason), and based on Keith’s lines I think it’s supposed to be another signal of how “not country” the song is…except that some of country’s biggest stars, including Keith himself (and I’d include Garth Brooks’s “One Night A Day” here too if the man wasn’t allergic to YouTube), have included the instrument in their songs. I’d argue that the saxophone is the only redeeming feature of this mix, as the song’s vibe is stuck in an awkward spot that’s not bright enough to be fun yet not dark enough to be angry, leaving it without much of a tone at all and preventing the listener from feeling like they’re in on the supposed joke (we’ll talk about that later). Overall, this mix is generally stale and uninteresting, and doesn’t provide any meaningful support for the subject matter.\n\nNone of the three vocalists here acquit themselves terribly well, and their deliveries are loaded with malicious intent rather than good-natured fun. Keith is the easiest target of the three, because he sounds awful: With his tired, disinterested tone, his performance is so mailed-in he should reimburse the label for postage, and it should have never been included on the track in the first place. Gilbert and HARDY at least seem interested in singing the song, but while Gilbert stumbles a bit on the first verse (he struggles to fit in all the songs he wants to name-drop), the biggest problem with both men is the irritating attitude that permeates their performance. A song like this would be hard to redeem under any circumstances, but with a little charm and a lighter touch, you could maybe have some good-natured fun with the concept of what is and isn’t thought of as stereotypically “country.” Instead, Gilbert and HARDY adapt a caustic, mocking tone and come across like generic Bro-Country meatheads, and their underlying message comes through loud and clear: If any of our descriptions match you, you’re not “country,” and you’re not one of us. It’s only a few steps from this track to Robert Count’s tire fire “What Do I Know,” and the bitter flavor and exclusionary mindset of these performances wind up pushing the audience away rather than drawing them in. In the end, all three artists combine to make a bad song even worse, and frankly, they should all be ashamed of themselves for doing it.\n\nSpeaking of an exclusionary mindset: A lot of songs have tried to define “country” by what it is, but this track flips the script by trying to create “the worst country song of all time” by listing all the things that they believe country isn’t. (You can tell that HARDY had a hand in writing this junk, because it features the same awful, misguided sense of humor that plagued “REDNECKER.”) At its core, the song is nothing more than an inverted laundry list of tired, overused country tropes: It takes things like beer, trucks, and dirt roads, and declares them to be bad things in its quest for awfulness. Not only is the approach incredibly lazy, but by framing these attitudes as “un-country,” it draws a hard line between “real” country fans and the rest of the world, and goes even further by insinuating that those outside the country bubble are only worthy of hatred and scorn. I tend to be a big-tent kind of person when it comes to musical genres, and nothing drives me up a wall more than taking an “us vs. them” approach and projecting supposed moral superiority over those on the other side of the fence. (The fact that it tries to hide its malice behind the paper-thin “It’s just a joke, bro!” defense doesn’t help matters—in fact, it makes them look worse.)\n\nThe main question I have with defining “country” in such a sense is “Why?” Why can’t people who “hate beer,” “think trucks are a waste of gas,” and don’t happen to “know the words to ‘Family Tradition,’ ‘Folsom Prison,’ or ‘Walk The Line'” be country fans? (Spoiler alert: The first two statements apply to yours truly, and I only know the words to one of the songs in the third.) Macy Gray recently proposed changes to the American flag; would Gilbert, HARDY, and Keith permanently bar her from the country music community? Even statements that you might think would be unassailable fall apart upon closer scrutiny: There are definitely people in Russia and North Korea who “support Kim Jong-Un and Putin”—why should that disqualify them from being fans of country music? (The song also gets explicitly political with references to cancel culture and hating the Constitution, which bothers me because demonizing people they disagree with in this manner is also the modus operandi of the modern Republican Party, which is working really hard to subvert our entire form of government right now…) The only requirement for being part of country music is liking country music, and people are allowed to do so no matter who they are (for example, while I think throwing Morgan Wallen off the radio was the right call and I would keep him off the radio until he demonstrates a change in attitude and behavior, I wouldn’t take away his stereo or make him throw away his Hank Williams Jr. CDs). Country music should be a place for anyone who’s experienced the highs and lows of life (the joys of a romance, the pain of a loss, the stories of people and their times, etc.), and the last time I checked, no one died and made these three losers the gatekeepers of the genre.\n\nSimply put, I hate everything about “The Worst Country Song Of All Time.” I don’t like the generic sound, I don’t like the pretentious, closed-minded writing, and I don’t like the condescending, exclusionary attitudes of Brantley Gilbert, HARDY, or Toby Keith. In fact, the only good thing I can’t say about this track is that it didn’t quite provoke the angry, visceral reaction that Michael Ray’s “One That Got Away” did (it was darned close though). What aggravates me even more is that this review is exactly what the singers and label are looking for: This song is for the subset of country fans who subscribe to this backwards line of thinking and want to build a metaphorical wall between themselves and everyone else, and baiting uppity critics like me to rip the song to pieces will serve as confirmation that “those people” don’t understand “country” folks and want to destroy everything they treasure. The truth is that there are far more things to treasure besides beer, trucks, and “Mama’s homemade fried chicken,” and we should be able to celebrate all of them regardless of who we are or what instruments we prefer to hear. If Gilbert and his collaborators don’t understand that, they’re still free to enjoy country music, but I’m not sure I want them making it themselves.\n\nRating: 2/10. Complete rubbish.\n\nIs Bro-Country redeemable through spirituality? Your answer will likely predict your feelings about this track.\n\nMichael “HARDY” Hardy has only been on the mainstream scene for a few years, but he’s hasn’t made a great impression so far. His debut single “REDNECKER” wound up as the worst song of 2019, and despite “One Beer” eventually becoming his first #1 single, it wasn’t much of an improvement in my book. For his third single (the second from his weirdly-titled debut album A Rock), HARDY is taking a more-conventional (read: generic) approach, mixing faith and death with his usual Bro talking points to give us “Give Heaven Some Hell.” While I wouldn’t call this a terribly good song, it’s a clear step up from his previous work thanks to the work of the producer and the artist.\n\nBy the numbers, the production here is nothing to write home about: It’s pretty much the same guitar-and-drum mix that’s dominating the airwaves these days, with some spacious backgrounds synths thrown in to give the track an arena-ready vibe. The guitars aren’t as in your face as you might expect, however, and the reverb added to the moderately-bright electric axe that opens the track and carries the melody gives the song a surprising reflective and weighty feel, combining with the synthesizer and typical “slow Bro” tempo to move the listener to ruminate on the lyrics (whether such rumination is worthwhile, however, is up for debate). The drums don’t have much punch, but they do enough to help push the song forward and keep it from bogging down or feeling lifeless. There are a lot of minor chords here, but the lighter, brighter touch of the arrangement keeps the song feeling serious without getting too dark or pessimistic. In short, it accentuates the feel of the lyrics rather than getting in their way, which is lot better than the sonic messes we’ve been getting from HARDY up to now. It’s not great, but it gets the job done.\n\nAfter his past performances ranged from lifeless to obnoxious, I didn’t expect much from HARDY’s vocals here, but I actually think he does a decent sales job on this track. Part of the reason for this is that the narrator here is essentially the same guy we heard on “REDNECKER,” albeit with a bit more decorum to meet the solemnity of the moment, and it’s a rough-edged persona HARDY has been cultivating over the last two years. There’s still a hint of defiance in his delivery, but it feels more relatable this time around: When someone passes on, we tend to tell ourselves that their spirit will survive and live on in some version of the afterlife. HARDY brings just enough believability to the table here to feel credible as a run-of-the-mill Bro shaken by the realization of life’s fragility, and while it’s still not the most likeable of characters, the audience can still understand where they’re coming from and sympathize with them. Again, he won’t be winning any Oscars for his performance, but we won’t be blowing raspberries at him for it either, and that’s a step in the right direction.\n\nI’m not a fan of the lyrics here, because underneath all the song’s trappings of piety, both the narrator and the person that dies are just run-of-the-mill bros who want to do generic Bro-Country things: Play loud music, burn rubber in parking lots, go four-wheeling through mudholes, and drink potent alcoholic beverages. There’s detail here, but it’s the same old stuff that’s Nashville’s been shoveling at us for years, and while I get that everyone’s perception of what constitutes “heaven” is different, the activities here (not to mention the hook) seem to contradict the whole point of what such an afterlife is supposed to be. (In particular, that “hide your beer, hide your clear from the man upstairs” seems kind of dumb when said upstairs man supposedly “views the ends of the earth and sees everything under the heavens.”) The audience may feel for the departed and the narrator, but they’re not terribly interested in the story, and the production’s supplementary approach means that the writing’s shortcomings are on full display.\n\nIn the end, I view “Give Heaven Some Hell” roughly the same way I viewed Tim McGraw and Tyler Hubbard’s “Undivided”: The heart’s in the right place, but the execution leaves something to be desired, especially with lyrics like these that generate more questions than answers. It constitutes HARDY’s best work despite its flaws, but it also gives me the sense that his ceiling is relatively low: He’s a Bro-Country artist, and doesn’t seem likely to move on from that frame of reference for a while. There are better songs to celebrate the passing of a classic gool ol’ boy (may I suggest Joe Diffie’s “Prop Me Up (Beside The Jukebox If I Die)”?), but it’s not a terrible addition to the airwaves, and given the precarious state of the Pulse, we’ll take any good news we can get.\n\nRating: 6/10. It’s worth trying on for size to see what you think.\n\nWhen your song tries to be two different things, it usually winds up being neither of them.\n\nGiven that Michael “HARDY” Hardy’s debut single “REDNECKER” earned the distinction of being the worst country single of 2019 en route to a mediocre #26 Billboard airplay peak, you have to figure the dude had nowhere to go but up with whatever he chose as his follow-up release. Now that he’s finally given us “One Beer,” I can officially say that the song is not worse than “REDNECKER”…but it wasn’t for a lack of trying. This song, which mashes three singers (HARDY, Lauren Alaina, and Devin Dawson), two goals, and several musical genres, is the sonic equivalent of taking five different jigsaw puzzles and trying to put them all together into one giant picture, and the result is one big mess that leaves the listener more confused than anything else. There may be things to like and things to hate, but there’s nothing here worth remembering.\n\nFor the sake of comparison, let’s start by revisiting a track that plowed this same ground back in 2003 and got things mostly right in the process: Kenny Chesney’s “There Goes My Life.”\n\nLet’s start with the differences in the sound. Chesney’s track opens with a soft, reflective piano, transitions to an acoustic guitar and subdued snare drum that pushes the lyrics to the forefront, slowly builds in volume and complexity (steel guitar, electric guitar, a full drum set), and builds to a perfect crescendo at the end of the bridge. The tempo was deliberate, the noise level was careful not to trample on the writing, and that mix had a real warmth and humanity to it that accentuates the emotional impact of the song.\n\nIn contrast, HARDY opens with a mind-numbingly simple guitar riff marinated in audio effects, tosses in a drum machine on the chorus, and makes them the primary focus of the arrangement for the rest of the song. While the producer eventually adds a few other instruments here and there (pianos, guitars…actually, many of the same pieces from Chesney’s song can be found here). The result is a song that feels as sterile as a doctor’s office, and it generates a limp club-beat vibe that doesn’t fit the subject matter at all. This sound is not inviting enough to be thoughtful and not energetic enough to be danceable, which pretty much makes it good for nothing.\n\nSpeaking of nothing, that’s pretty much what HARDY brings to his vocal performance. His flow is basically his only redeeming quality: His voice is monotone and flat, his range is so limited that he’s uncomfortable when the song pushes him into his lower register (he voice tails off and gets raspy at the end of nearly every line), he delivers his lines with less feeling than an Amazon Echo, and worst of all, he doesn’t breathe any life into his characters and make them sympathetic. Where Chesney really made you feel for the protagonist as their dreams disappeared (and then brought his charisma to bear to make the rest of the song adorable instead of cheesy), HARDY never gives you the sense that he cares about the characters here, so why should the audience care? (What’s even more jarring is that the lyrics try to make a point about how alcohol consumption has unintended consequences, but HARDY’s stoic monologue explicitly refuses to take the same stand.)\n\nYou would think the track would make more use of the featured singers to prop up HARDY’s lackluster lead, but Alaina only shows up of the chorus harmony work, and Dawson is…er….well, I’m sure he’s here somewhere, but you’d never know it from listening to the song. The song squanders the talent of the singers who actually have talent, and make us sit through HARDY’s ear-grating performance, one that makes us pray to every spirit we can think of that the song is over when he reaches that long pause on the bridge.\n\nAnd then we get to the subject matter, and…*sigh*. It may be the same story that Chesney tells about two people who get surprised with an unexpected pregnancy and discover that it’s more of a blessing than a curse, but the lyrical construction of this song is vastly inferior. For one thing, the verses are nothing but disjointed laundry lists featuring choppily-sequenced snapshots:\n\nSeventeen in this small town\n\nWeak knees in a CVS\n\nDoor locked in the bathroom\n\nWhat’s it gonna be waitin’ on that test?\n\n…\n\nSesame Street on the TV\n\nA race car rollin’ on a cardboard bridge\n\nCrayon stick figure family\n\nStuck right there front center on the fridge\n\nThe detail is there (and it’s actually impressive), but the thread between the images is missing, and the song feels more like a context-less photo album than a true story. (The song also stops short at this point, while Chesney’s tune at least sent the kid to college and tied the ends of the tale together by having the kid fulfill their parent’s dream.) To their credit, the writers try to use the “one beer” hook to point out how alcohol can change the course of someone’s life, but the point lacks enough punch to overcome HARDY’s nonchalant reading of the text. (To their discredit, the extended schoolyard “K-I-S-S-I-N-G” song reference feels more lazy than clever.) In the end, the writers seemed to have good intentions, but all they do is keep the devil’s paving company in business.\n\nThe only good thing about “One Beer” is that it is, in fact, a better song than “REDNECKER,” but then again, so is the sound of a cat running its claws across a chalkboard. The writing has some flashes of competency, but neither HARDY nor the producer actually care about what’s being said, and the sound does it own thing while HARDY does nothing at all. (Lauren Alaina and Devin Dawson could have added a lot to the track, but they’re criminally underused and are reduced to bystanders gawking at a train derailment.) It’s a mess of clashing ideas wrapped in a layer of sheer indifference, and instead of convincing me that HARDY deserves a more-prominent place in the genre, it tells me we need to throw him out before he can do any more damage.\n\nRating: 4/10. No thank you.\n\nIs this what country music has become? Has the genre really devolved into a buck-measuring contest?\n\nI was already getting tired of hearing artists like Luke Bryan, Chris Young, and Easton Corbin prattle on about just how “country” they were. The last thing I wanted was for some offended good ol’ boy to step up to the mic and declare that they, in fact, were the redneckiest redneck that ever rednecked, and that you were a soft little city slicker in comparison. Unfortunately, that’s just what we got from HARDY, a Mississippi native and the genius behind Morgan Wallen’s all-time classic “Up Down,” who operates under the Big Loud record label. I don’t know what they were shooting for with “REDNECKER,” but it’s about the dumbest declaration of countriness I’ve ever heard, sung by the most insufferable narrator who completely fails at making the track sarcastic, fun, or worth listening to.\n\nLet’s start with the lyrics today, because frankly I hate everything about them. It’s not enough that the narrator has to proclaim how country they are just like every other song on the radio; no, they are offended that you think that your own redneck credentials measure up to theirs, and must point out in painstaking detail why yours are inferior. It’s meant to be sort of a “proxy song” where the listener imagines themselves saying this to someone else, but in my experience, people don’t fight over this kind of thing, they bond over it, and picking a fight where it’s not warranted or prudent just seems stupid to me. You could also try to make the argument that the narrator is being sarcastic or tongue-in-cheek, but there’s not enough hyperbole in the writing to stick the landing: Outside of the “my tick hound’s a little more blue” line, everything here sounds like it was ripped straight from HARDY’s competition: small towns, loud trucks, hay bales, sweaty brows, etc. (If they had gone really over the top with the lyrics—”I took a selfie with Hank Sr.! I gave Willie his first joint!”—then I might have bought this argument.) This narrator comes across as both dead serious and seriously annoyed that you would have the audacity to call yourself “redneck,” and while there’s no hard and fast definition of the term, I also take issue with claiming that having “got it on a tailgate” or being able to “piss where i want to” are valid criteria. To top it all off, the whole “rednecker” hook is the opposite of clever or witty, and stands as further proof that making up your own words/phrases for a hook (“singles you up”, “alcohol you later”) is not a viable strategy. This is the dumbest song I’ve heard in a looooong time, and this and “Up Down” form a strong case for never letting HARDY touch a pen, keyboard, or typewriter for the rest of his days.\n\nWriting this awful would be near impossible to redeem for the best of singers, and HARDY is nowhere close to having that sort of stature. The song is neither a range-tester or a tongue-buster, but it requires a huge amount of charisma and skill to make the narrator seem endearing or sympathetic. Unfortunately, HARDY (who sounds like yet another off-brand Florida Georgia Line clone), has neither charisma nor skill, and delivers his lines with such an aggravated seriousness that he makes you think he’s actually annoyed that you think you’re more redneck than he is. Given the absurdity of the discussion and the fact that the narrator is addressing his grievances towards “you”(at least A Thousand Horses had to decency to include the audience on “Preachin’ To The Choir”), the performance causes the listener to recoil at the accusation and wonder what the dude’s problem is. (Much like Brantley Gilbert, HARDY “doth protest too much, methinks.”) There’s no twinkle in the eye, no tongue placed in cheek, no knowing smile…he just comes across as an angry individual who feels the need to put you in your place for no good reason. As bad as the lyrics are, HARDY’s delivery manages to drag them down even further.\n\nAt this point, there’s no hope for the production to save this sinking ship, so it just goes with the flow and doesn’t even bother to try. The mix opens with a swampy electric guitar and real drum set, and doesn’t really move much from that spot (it brings in an organ for the choruses). With it’s slower tempo and darker instrument tones, the producer seems to be shooting for the same “outlaw” vibe that Justin Moore captured in “Kinda Don’t Care,” but it only reflects the worst qualities of that spirit, channeling all of the status-quo irritation and I-do-what-I-want-no-matter-who-it-hurts nihilism without any of the endearing charm and underlying self-awareness. It certainly fits the serious vibe of the vocals and writing, but at some point blind adherence to the party line at the expense of listenability becomes more trouble than it’s worth. The song’s structure and riffs are also paint-by-numbers simple, suggesting that the producer is just here so they don’t get fined—if HARDY and company want to go down this rabbit hole of defiance and isolation, they can at least sound like a mediocre Lynyrd Skynyrd cover band as they go.\n\nThere aren’t many songs that I would choose a Mitchell Tenpenny single over, but “REDNECKER” is definitely one of them. The sound is generic and uninspired, HARDY is angry and unlikable, and the writing is so putrid that not even Greenpeace would dare clean it up. It’s a early front-runner for my worst song of 2019, and if anything good can come out of this, it’s that hopefully this song will make people realize that the”I’m so country!” trend has been played out to its logical conclusion, and the genre can finally get over itself and move on to something more substantive and interesting.\n\nRating: 2/10. Absolute garbage."
