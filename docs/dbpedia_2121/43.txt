When this debut album was recorded and released in its homeland, pioneering U.K. garage act Artful Dodger was a duo, comprising Mark Hill and Pete Devereux. Earlier this year, Devereux ended his musical partnership with Hill to pursue his DJ career, leaving songwriter/ producer Hill—who helmed Craig David’s award-winning debut album, Born to Do It (and who is collaborating with David on his follow-up, due next year)—to carry the Artful Dodger banner solo. All of which doesn’t—and shouldn’t—tarnish It’s All About the Stragglers, which is one R&B-conscious, club-rooted, classically arranged album. American fans of the decidedly British 2-step sound (or garage as it’s also labeled) have already embraced the set’s U.K. crossover hits, including the David-fronted “Re-Rewind,” “Think About Me” (featuring Michelle Escoffery), and “Twentyfourseven” (with All Saints’ Melanie Blatt). But there’s more good stuff where these came from. The string-laden “I Can’t Give It Up” and the hip-hop-fueled “R U Ready” featuring, respectively, Nadia and MC Alistair, are as dancefloor-ready as they are radio-friendly. Fans of David take note: In addition to “Re-Rewind,” the British sensation appears on “Woman Trouble” and “What Ya Gonna Do?”—MP
