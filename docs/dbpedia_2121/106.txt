The album was recorded on a small budget in the empty production studios near Fareham of the Ocean Radio Group, then owned by Capital Radio. One of those stations was Power FM where the band also hosted a weekend dance show and headlined the 2000 day festival Power in the Park. [7]

The A.V. Club wrote: "Artful Dodger has always represented the lighter side of two-step, but without other artists' tracks to counter its airy levity, It's All About The Stragglers is a middling effort that makes for a less-than-thrilling introduction to an otherwise thrilling genre."[12] Exclaim! thought that "Craig David effortlessly commands the pulsing groove of 'Whatcha Gonna Do'."[13] Billboard called It's All About the Stragglers an "R&B-conscious, club-rooted, classically arranged album."[14] The Chicago Tribune opined that "chances are that teens will be befuddled by the studio geekery and dance experts will scoff at its conscious fluffiness, but tunes like 'Think about Me' are an apt reminder that not all contemporary pop has to be a guilty pleasure to be fun."[15]
