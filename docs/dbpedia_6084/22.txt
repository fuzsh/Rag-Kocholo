Indianapolis…Emmis Communications Corporation (Nasdaq: EMMS) today announced that the company has begun its time brokerage agreement with Bonneville International Corporation for WLUP-FM in Chicago. In a deal announced in October, Emmis entered into an agreement with Bonneville to swap three Phoenix radio stations – KTAR-AM, KMVP-AM and KKLT-FM – in exchange for WLUP-FM (The Loop) in Chicago and $70 million in cash, which Emmis is using to pay down debt. Emmis has owned WKQX-FM (Q101) in Chicago since 1988.

Marv Nyren, formerly Emmis Radio Regional Vice President/Market Manager of Emmis-Phoenix, has begun his duties as Regional Vice President/Market Manager of Emmis-Chicago.

The closing of the transaction is subject to several conditions, including approval from the Federal Communications Commission, and is expected to occur in early 2005. After the close of the transaction, Emmis will own 25 radio stations in eight markets.
