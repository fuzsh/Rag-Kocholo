Those eight teams will advance to knockout play, which will be single-elimination games until a champion is crowned in Las Vegas on Dec. 9 at T-Mobile Arena.\n\nThe Suns will be featured on ESPN for the first two games — against the Lakers and Jazz – of the four-game slate before a local broadcast and an NBA TV-aired game to close out group play.\n\nPhoenix Suns In-Season Tournament schedule\n\nFriday, Nov. 10 vs. Lakers – 8 p.m. (ESPN)\n\nFriday, Nov. 17 at Jazz – 8 p.m. (ESPN)\n\nTuesday, Nov. 21 vs. Blazers – 7 p.m.\n\nFriday, Nov. 24 at Grizzlies – 3 p.m. (NBA TV)\n\nKnockout rounds\n\nQuarterfinals: Dec. 4-5\n\nSemifinals: Dec. 7\n\nChampionship: Dec. 9\n\nThe teams that do not qualify for the knockout rounds will play two regular season games on Dec. 6 and 8.
