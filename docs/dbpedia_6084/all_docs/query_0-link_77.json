'R' 56252164 Nobody knows what works in radio anymore. Not long ago, a verse in the radio bible said, \"Local and live beats network and taped.\" Radio had an advantage over other media because it could quickly relate to local events .\n\nRush Limbaugh sent broadcasting's bible scholars back to the stone tablets, looking for something they missed. Limbaugh, aired locally on KFYI (910 AM), took over the rat- ings nationally, even on stations that did not air his programs live. Along comes Dr. Laura Schlessin-ger, also heard on KFYI, who seems to have a Limbaugh-like talent for walking on the airwaves. With at least adequate success across the country, there are also G .\n\nGordon Liddy, Michael Reagan, Ken Ham-blin, Ollie North and countless others who all grab microphones, take calls and beam bombast across the nation. There are enough national sports shows to fill several stations. And Howard Stern is a few books and movies all by himself. For the most part, these new success stories couldn't cafe less about the traditional beliefs of radio programmers. There was an adequate portion of the audience ready to hear what they had to offer .\n\nOne of the most fascinating of these newcomers is Art Bell, whose national show airs overnight on KFYI, and a special show called Dreamland that airs early evenings on weekends. Bell broadcasts from his house (reportedly a double-wide trailer) in Pahrump, to more than 300 radio stations looking for something to put on the air in the dark, pre-dawn hours when sleepless listeners search for connection and companionship. Bell leans toward the odd and unexplained, with a seemingly never-ending search for UFOs. But he may also spend a load of air time telling his nationwide audience about how he lured his cat Cut from under the front porch where it had hidden for days. In the latest issue, Time magazine called Bell's show \"the nation's top meeting place of the reality-challenged.\" It is Bell and his Web site that are linked to providing the information the Heaven's Gate followers were waiting for: There's an intelligently driven spacecraft at the tail of the Hale-Bopp comet, and it's time to leave your containers behind and head to the next level .\n\nThat would be laughable if the consequences were not so tragic. Maybe it's the cyberspace link that nearly everyone now has from his personal computer to nearly every other person on the planet that has helped de-emphasize local radio. In fact, more than 300 stations now broadcast over the Internet. But the old rules are out and there are no new rules. So why do we bother with local disc jockeys who add little content to music shows? Some announcer in a double-wide trailer in Anywhere, USA, can announce 14 songs in a row that you've already heard more times than you care to remember .\n\nActually, one local station, KOY (550 AM), already does this successfully. None of the shows on KOY originate from here. A few other local music stations offer satellite-delivered programming with moderate success. KFYI has added another of the successful national shows with the return of Kim Komando to the local air, Sundays from noon to 2 p.m. Also known as the Digital Goddess, Komando 's Komputer Klinic is an entertaining and fun adventure into the cyberworld .\n\nCall the florist If local radio dies, it's radio's fault. Who keeps programming over-researched bromides to an audience that has clearly expressed dissatisfaction with the pablum? The listeners just aren't buying it anymore. Call the florist and notify the family: Boring radio programmed by research-dominated dimwits doesn't have long to live. A local show with a local issue airs tomorrow when Barry Landers interviews Jim Howl during his noon-to-4 p.m. talk show on KHEP (1280 AM) .\n\nHowl was dismissed from his Channel 3 weather job amid suggestions of sexual harassment. Now Howl is rumored to be ready for a race for the governor's job. I'll spare you the jokes about sex and politics. Got a call last week from KTAR's Pat McMahon. He said with a chuckle that he thinks it was a new career high for him to have his name included in a column about Howard Stern .\n\nA reader had suggested that Stern's ego Was an act, while McMahon 's was real. Pat called to note that his name had been misspelled in the column. Word this week is that longtime Valley favorite Bill Heywood should be back on the air within about a month. Heywood was the wake-up warrior on KOY, KTAR and KFYI. A good source says Heywood will be back on a music station in his next assignment .\n\nCharlie Van Dyke can be reached at 708-6397 or at TVFMAMaol.com by electronic mail.
