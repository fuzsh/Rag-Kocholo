        "text": "Phoenix’s first radio station, KFAD, signed on in 1922. In 1929, the publisher of The Arizona Republic newspaper purchased KFAD, changing the call letters to KREP. In 1930, it became KTAR, which stood for “Keep Taking the Arizona Republic.”\n\nKTAR became an NBC affiliate. The Arizona Republic sold the station to Chicago ad man John Louis, Sr., in 1944. Louis purchased Phoenix’s KTYL-TV, Channel 12, in 1955, renaming it KVAR-TV. In 1959, the station became KTAR-TV. KTAR-FM signed on in 1960.\n\nLouis’ broadcast properties later became Pacific & Southern Broadcasting, headquartered in Phoenix with KTAR-AM-FM-TV as the flagship stations. The company merged with a Phoenix billboard advertising business in 1973, becoming known as Combined Communications Corporation.\n\nKTAR-AM’s middle-of-the-road, full-service format evolved into a news/talk format during the 1970s. KTAR-FM became easy listening KBBC-FM in the mid-1970s.\n\nCombined Communications merged with Gannett in 1979. FCC regulations prevented Gannett from owning the KTAR radio stations along with the TV station. Pulitzer Publishing Company, owner of Tuscon’s Arizona Daily Star newspaper, purchased KTAR-AM and KBBC-FM. The TV station adopted its current call letters, KPNX-TV.\n\nKBBC-FM flipped to KKLT-FM in 1982 and pioneered the “soft rock” version of the adult contemporary format.\n\nBonneville International purchased KTAR/KKLT in 2004. KKLT-FM became KPKX in 2004, carrying a variety of adult hits.\n\nIn 2006, Bonneville purchased KKFR-FM, Glendale, and renamed it KTAR-FM, beginning a simulcast of KTAR-AM’s news/talk programming. In 2007, news/talk programming moved exclusively to KTAR-FM. KTAR-AM flipped to a sports-talk format. In 2014, KPKX-FM, the original KTAR-FM, rejoined its original sister station as an FM simulcast of the KTAR-AM sports format. The FM station was renamed KMVP-FM.\n\nAs of 2014, Bonneville owns the radio stations."
