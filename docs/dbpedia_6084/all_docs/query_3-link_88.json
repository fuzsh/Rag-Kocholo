        "text": "Indianapolis…Emmis Communications Corporation (Nasdaq: EMMS) today announced that the company has begun its time brokerage agreement with Bonneville International Corporation for WLUP-FM in Chicago. In a deal announced in October, Emmis entered into an agreement with Bonneville to swap three Phoenix radio stations – KTAR-AM, KMVP-AM and KKLT-FM – in exchange for WLUP-FM (The Loop) in Chicago and $70 million in cash, which Emmis is using to pay down debt. Emmis has owned WKQX-FM (Q101) in Chicago since 1988.\n\nMarv Nyren, formerly Emmis Radio Regional Vice President/Market Manager of Emmis-Phoenix, has begun his duties as Regional Vice President/Market Manager of Emmis-Chicago.\n\nThe closing of the transaction is subject to several conditions, including approval from the Federal Communications Commission, and is expected to occur in early 2005. After the close of the transaction, Emmis will own 25 radio stations in eight markets.\n\nEmmis Communications – Great Media, Great People, Great Service ®\n\nEmmis Communications is an Indianapolis-based diversified media firm with radio broadcasting, television broadcasting and magazine publishing operations. Emmis has announced but not yet completed a swap of three Phoenix radio stations for one Chicago radio station.
