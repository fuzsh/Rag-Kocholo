        "text": "DENVER – Bonneville Denver announces Jerry Schemmel has been hired by Sports Radio 104.3 The Fan (KKFN-FM) as an on-air talent. The station will also begin airing Schemmel’s program “Amazing Americans” on Sunday mornings at 7:30 a.m. starting April 26, 2020.\n\nSchemmel is one of the most recognizable broadcasting voices in Denver sports history. He spent the last 10 seasons serving as the radio play-by-play voice of the Colorado Rockies. Prior to that, Schemmel was the radio and television voice of the Denver Nuggets for 18 years. His program “Amazing Americas” features sports interviews focusing on authentic stories of inspiration.\n\n“There is no more respected figure in Denver media than Jerry Schemmel. He’s a man of the highest integrity and professionalism,” said Sports Radio 104.3 The Fan program director Raj Sharan. “Jerry has served as the soundtrack of so many great Denver sports moments. It’s only fitting that in the year of our 25th anniversary, we welcome back one of the legendary voices in the history of our radio station.”\n\nIn addition to his sports broadcasting career, Schemmel spent the 2009 season as head baseball coach at Metropolitan State University of Denver and authored two books, “Chosen to Live” and “The Extravagant Gift.” An avid bicyclist, he rode across the country twice to raise funds for Colorado Children’s Hospital and HaitiChildren.\n\nSchemmel will also make regular appearances on Sports Radio 104.3 The Fan programming to provide analysis on the Rockies and Nuggets. He’ll also contribute content to 1043TheFan.com and the station’s social media channels.\n\nAbout Bonneville International Corporation\n\nBonneville International is an integrated media and marketing solutions company dedicated to building up, connecting, informing and celebrating families and communities.
