        "text": "Who Are These Guys?\n\nThe guys bring you three hours of energetic entertainment, endless sports information, top names in all of sports and invigorating sports talk with passionate sports fans. Roc & Manuch began their oddball relationship on Tuesday, September 7, 2004, on ESPN 860 KMVP from 2pm-4pm after the Dan Patrick show. Shortly after a year, the show moved to KDUS AM 1060 from 3pm-6pm. The show was originally called \"Calling All Sports\" but changed to \"AZSportsTalk\" when AM 1060 became an NBC Sports Radio affiliate in April 2013.\n\nPrior to NBC, the affiliate was Sporting News Radio and Yahoo Sports Radio. The guys also hosted a weekend national show for six months on Sporting News Radio. Shawn Crespin spent over six years with guys at KDUS and KQFN and most recently joined them on September 8, 2020. Jim Brinson, \"Jimmy B\" is back after spending time with Roc and Manuch at KQFN.\n\nAfter 13 years at KDUS AM 1060, the guys left to launch KQFN 1580 CBS Sports Radio and aired their show Monday-Friday 3pm-6pm from February 2017 to December 2018. 2019 brings a lot of excitement as their show was aired nationally on SB Nation Radio Monday-Friday 4pm-7pm EST and locally 2pm-5:30pm on AM 1060. Fox Sports 910 Monday-Friday 1pm-4pm has been their home since September 2019. The show is powered by the Law Offices of Lerner and Rowe.\n\nDan Manucci\n\n\"MANUCH\" earned a football scholarship from Kansas State University where he led the Big 8 in passing his senior year and was named 1978 All-Big 8 Honorable Mention. Manuch was drafted by the Buffalo Bills in the 5th round in 1979 and played QB for the Bills in 1979-80, 87, Toronto Argonauts 1981 and Arizona Wranglers of the USFL 1983. Manuch has TV and radio experience with the Cardinals, Sun Devils, Rattlers and High School Football. He is on the Advisory Board of National Football Foundation Valley of the Sun Chapter and participates in the local NFL Retired Players Association. He has been a co-host with Roc since 2004 and color guy for High School Football every Friday night on AIA Radio Network. Proud coach of SF 49er QB Brock Purdy. [email protected]"
