        "text": "Today, kicking off the America's Public Television Stations Summit, we heard from outgoing President and CEO Patrick Butler. His speech offered insights from the past, wisdom for the present, and a glimpse to the future, reminding all of us why we do what we do. I spent a lot of time re-reading the full speech, trying to decide which quote to share here with you all. I have landed on one, but the entire speech is filled to the brim with meaning and I encourage everyone to read it in full. For now, here are some of his words of inspiration that have most stuck with me: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure many people in this room have a similar story to tell about their own humble origins in broadcasting and their ambitions to channel its power for good, perhaps even for salvation. To think that we could dream such dreams, and make them come true, is to understand just how special our country is, and how honored we are to serve it. Even when it‚Äôs hard. Especially when it‚Äôs hard. In a nation divided, we build community. To bitter debate, we bring civility. To an anxious people, we provide safety. To a coarsening society, we offer culture. Where intolerance looms, we embrace diversity. To those who have little, we impart the priceless gift of education. In the darkness of disinformation, we shine the liberating light of truth.‚Äù https://lnkd.in/gDehYrje\n\nThe BBC is one of the world's most respected broadcasters, but it has its fair share of dodgy practices; one stands out. Not so long ago, I switched to Radio 2, and Tony Blackburn‚Äîone of the BBC's most experienced presenters‚Äîdid a 'shoutout' for a listener. I immediately switched off. 'Shoutouts' are a strangely popular bedrock of BBC broadcasting. I can only imagine that some time back, someone with sufficient managerial heft but bereft of any programming experience had the idea that because the BBC is partly funded by TV licence fees paid by the British public, the public should be on the radio. Bad idea. One of the outcomes is the 'shoutout'‚Äîa link presented by a show host that includes a message from a listener, e.g. \"Billy Bob from Brighton wants to send a shoutout to his mother, Eunice, driving to Bognor Regis\". At first consideration, it sounds harmless, but it's terrible and lazy radio. What a host says between songs or components on a show‚Äîis either a stand-by, step-back or step-in link. By default, when they open the microphone and start talking, they create a stand-by link‚Äîthe listener is standing by for something that is ideally compelling, interesting, entertaining or informative; essentially, something with *value*. There is expectation on the part of the listener. If the host doesn't deliver value, they are essentially wasting the attention paid by the listener. This risks being annoying. If the host does say something annoying, it becomes a step-back link‚Äîmetaphorically, the listener becomes increasingly detached from the programme and is one step closer to tuning out. Ideally, whenever a host switches on the microphone, they should do so with a step-in link in mind‚Äîsomething that will encourage the listener to metaphorically *step in* to the conversation. This can simply be nodding in agreement. And this is where one of radio's programming paradoxes kicks into gear. Radio is a mass medium aimed at the individual. Wait; it gets weirder: You have to consider the broader audience to create the intimacy of talking to a single listener. And this is where the BBC gets it wrong. A shoutout for Billy Bob from Brighton to his mother, Eunice, is only a step-in link for Billy Bob and Eunice (if they're listening); it's a step-back link for everyone else. The BBC think the shoutout secures an individual connection by creating links for individuals. It doesn't; it alienates all but the individuals concerned. Plus, because the host doesn't have to think of a link, a shoutout is lazy. Creating step-in links requires considerable thought and expertise. It also demands knowledge of the target audience's typical traits and an intimate understanding of human behaviour, notably its commonalities. This increases the chance that the listener will think, \"Hey, they're talking to me.\" For more free insights into successful #radio #broadcasting, click on the link below. #training https://lnkd.in/eyajfWcf\n\nFCC, TikTok and the future of US News‚ÅâÔ∏è This appears to be a timely and necessary proposal from Federal Communications Commission, especially as a growing number of U.S. adults under 30 consistently turn to TikTok as their primary news source‚ÄºÔ∏è Roughly one-third of U.S. adults under 30 rely on #TikTok for staying informed. This trend stands in stark contrast to numerous other social media platforms, where news consumption has either decreased or remained relatively constant in recent years. (Source: Pew Research Center: https://lnkd.in/gcnQPkxm). Federal Communications Commission aims to streamline license renewal applications for radio and television stations that produce community-oriented programming. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something special about when you hear a local voice on the airwaves or see a familiar face on your television set in the evening‚Äù (FCC Chairperson Jessica Rosenworcel) This should bode well for local news, the cornerstone of local broadcast television. Local news is the crucial element that distinguishes broadcast stations, serving as a true market differentiator. In many regions, news anchors have local celebrity status, and viewers undoubtedly develop feelings and favorites among their local channels. ‚ÄúAt the same time, some broadcasters who are pushing the FCC to impose retransmission consent rules on streaming services are pulling back on some of their local news output. In the last few months, executives at the The E.W. Scripps Company and Sinclair Inc. have shut down newsrooms and laid off journalists in an effort to cut down on expenses.‚Äù (TheDesk.net) While some broadcasters are retreating from local news and TikTok is taking over and dominates, there appears to be a continuing demand and market for local news in the U.S. From an external perspective, collaborating with local broadcast news, print news, and social media news content creators seems preferable to relying solely on a TikTok platform that is entirely foreign-controlled‚ÅâÔ∏è Distributing news is a no-brainer, and by advancing the ATSC 3.0 technology, you can seamlessly offer viewers the familiar CTV and mobile media experience they are accustomed to. Changing consumer behavior is a formidable challenge that requires significant resources and a considerable amount of luck. üçøü•§ I think and hope more episodes will follow. üîó #5G #Ad #Advertising #ATSC #ATSC3 #AVOD #Advertising #Broadcast #Broadcasting #cabletv #CTV #CTVAdvertising #CTVWars #ConnectedHome #DVB #ISP #FAST #media #mediadistribution #mediatech #MVPD #vMVPD #NAB #NabAmplify #NextGenBroadcast #NextGenTV #OTT #PayTV #PTMP #Streaming #Streamingmedia #StreamingWars #Telco #Telecom #Television #TVChannel #TVAdvertising #video"
