        "text": "Deleted Stations\n\nKDYW 833 Phoenix (1922-1924)\n\nThe first licensed station in Phoenix (but not the first on the air - see 6BBH & KFCB below). It didn't last long. All commercial stations were forced to use 833 kilocycles (aka 360 meters) until 1924.\n\nCurrent Stations\n\n6BBH 833 Phoenix (1921-1922)\n\nKFCB 833 Phoenix (1922-1923)\n\nKFCB 1260 Phoenix (1923-1927)\n\nKFCB 1230 Phoenix (1927-1928)\n\nKFCB 1310 Phoenix (1928-1929)\n\nKFCB 1390 Phoenix (1929)\n\nKOY 1390 Phoenix (1929-1940)\n\nKOY 550 Phoenix (1940-1999)\n\nKGME 550 Phoenix (1999-2000)\n\nKFYI 550 Phoenix (2000-)\n\n6BBH was an amateur station, partially built by Barry Goldwater (but that was not his callsign), which became the first radio station in Arizona. It was licensed for broadcast in October 1922 as KFCB. FYI: Using the \"W\" prefix in amateur calls didn't start until 1928. Unofficially they used a lower-case \"u\" to stand for United States in this era. This is why the original amateur callsign is 6BBH rather than W6BBH.\n\n\"Kind Friends Come Back\" was the slogan for KFCB. Like most stations then, it bounced all over the dial in its early years. It became KOY right after settling on 1390 in 1929.\n\nKOY moved to 550 in March 1940 and has been a favorite of the senior set since the '60s. Moved from 550 to 1230 in April 1999 when owner AMFM bought the programming and personnel of KGME and moved it to 550.\n\nKGME was known as SportsRadio 550 (previously The Game and SportsRadio 1360). It carried UofA sports until the move to 550, when it picked up ASU from KTAR.\n\nEffective September 25, 2000 KGME and KFYI swap frequencies. KFYI becomes \"NewsRadio 550\" while KGME becomes \"XTRA Sports 910\" while retaining the KGME legal-ID.\n\nKFAD 833 Phoenix (1922-1925)\n\nKFAD 1100 Phoenix (1925-1926)\n\nKFAD 930 Phoenix (1926-1928)\n\nKFAD 620 Phoenix (1928)\n\nKREP 620 Phoenix (1929-1930)\n\nKTAR 620 Phoenix (1930-)\n\nKFAD was just one of the multitudes on 833, the only frequency authorized for commercial radio at the time. It moved around quite a bit in its early years, finally settling on 620 in 1928. It was purchased by The Arizona Republic in 1928 who briefly changed its call letters to KREP, then finally KTAR.\n\n\"Newsradio 620\" got its call letters in 1930, which stood for \"Keep Taking the Arizona Republic.\" The Republic sold the station in 1946. Recently sold by Hearst-Argyle (along with KKLT and KMVP) to Emmis.\n\nKUET 710 Black Canyon City (1982-1985)\n\nKUET 710 Black Canyon City (1998-)\n\n500 watt daytimer that didn't last long. The station was audible only in the Black Canyon City area, maybe into Cave Creek & Carefree.\n\nStill using the old 500 watt transmitter, KUET never surrendered its license from the '80s. It is now owned by Z-Spanish and simulcasts KLNZ 103.5. A transmitter upgrade to 22,000 watts days and 3900 watts nights is in the works.\n\nKMEO 740 (1959-1986)\n\nKIDR 740 Phoenix (1986-)\n\nKMEO was an easy-listening station simulcasted with FM 96.9. Was a 1000 watt daytimer until an upgrade to 292 watts at night in 1977 (a mistake since KCBS in SF frequently overrides KIDR in many parts of the valley).\n\nKIDR has been Radio Unica (Spanish-language) since 1997 but carried children's programming from Radio Aahs from 1986-1996, BeatRadio from Minneapolis for a few months after that. Station was sold to the Catholic Radio Network and carried Gregorian Chants for about 2 months (I'm not kidding!) before CRN sold to Radio Unica. Carried Arizona Cardinals games in 1995.\n\nKIFN 860 Phoenix (1948-1976)\n\nKVVA 860 Phoenix (1976-1996)\n\nKMVP 860 Phoenix (1996-)\n\nThe first Spanish-language station in the valley, it came on the air in 1948. Became KVVA in 1976, upgraded to 1000 watts fulltime in 1978 (it had been a 1000 watt daytimer).\n\n\"ESPN Radio 860 KMVP\" was purchased by Pulitzer Broadcasting (KTAR owner) in 1996 when KVVA went bankrupt (KVVA-FM is still Spanish-language). With a 1000 watt transmitter that was designed to reach the south and west sides of town, it has a very poor signal for a station that is supposed to reach the entire valley. This station carries Jerry Colangelo's minor-league teams (Rattlers & Mercury).\n\nKPHO 910 Phoenix (1949-1971)\n\nKJJJ 910 Phoenix (1971-1986)\n\nKFYI 910 Phoenix (1986-2000)\n\nKGME 910 Phoenix (2000-)\n\nKPHO, the 3rd station in Phoenix (not counting KDYW) started out on 1230 in 1940 and moved to 910 with a power increase in 1949. The original owners of this station also started the first TV station in the state (KPHO-TV Channel 5). Meredith purchased the stations in 1952 and sold KPHO radio in 1971, when it became country-music KJJJ.\n\nKFYI, the home of Rush & Dr. Laura became an issues-oriented, mostly conservative, talk station in 1986.\n\nOn September 25, 2000 KFYI and KGME swapped frequencies. KFYI is now on 550 and KGME is on 910, now known as \"XTRA Sports 910.\" It is the 3rd frequency for KGME since April 1999. The KGME call letters will be used for legal ID only once the FCC approves the swap.\n\nKOOL 960 Phoenix (1946-1976)\n\nKARZ 960 Phoenix (1976-1977)\n\nKOOL 960 Phoenix (1977-1996)\n\nKPXQ 960 Phoenix (1996-1999)\n\nKCTK 960 Phoenix (1999-)\n\nGene Autry owned this station originally. It was first the local Mutual affiliate then swapped networks with KOY in 1949 and went to CBS. After the demise of network radio in the '50s it became an adult MOR station competing with KOY and KXIV. After a brief try as a country station (as KARZ) it became KOOL again, this time as an oldies station programmed seperately from KOOL-FM. Sold to Salem in 1996, it carried religious programming for a couple of years before swapping calls and formats with (the very briefly used) KCTK 1360. The station now carries secular syndicated talk programming.\n\nKCAC 1010 Phoenix (1961-1971)\n\nKXEG 1010 Tolleson/Phoenix (1971-)\n\nThe original \"Progressive Rock\" station from 1967-1971 founded by William Edward Compton. Compton sold this 500 watt daytimer and became involved with newly- born KDKB AM & FM (1510 & 93.3).\n\nKXEG, a religious station (Spanish at night), replaced KCAC in 1971. Changed city of license from Phoenix to Tolleson in the mid '70s. Recently sold to James Crystal Radio of Florida. The plan to keep the format the same and have entered into an LMA with Mortenesen Broadcasting, the new owner of KTKP.\n\nKUPD 1060 Tempe (1956-1980)\n\nKKKQ 1060 Tempe (1980)\n\nKUKQ 1060 Tempe/Phoenix (1980-1996)\n\nKDUS 1060 Tempe/Phoenix (1997-)\n\nOriginally a station that played \"Love Songs\" and was called \"Cupid.\" Tried to compete with KRIZ and KRUX as an AM/FM Top-40 station for a time in the '70s. This station was a complete mess in those days. In 1980 the KUPD call letters were assigned to the FM only and 1060 became Urban KKKQ, then KUKQ (see KUKQ above). Now KDUS.\n\nAfter KUPD went FM-only, Urban Contemporary was tried on 1060 using these call letters around 1980. Unfortunately, it was not a good idea to name a radio station catering to Black people with call letters having \"KKK\" in them. It became KUKQ after a few weeks. The Urban format didn't last. They tried Country, Alternative Rock, then syndicated talk before settling on being the 3rd sports station in the valley as KDUS.\n\nKDUS is the home of the Arizona Cardinals and Phoenix Coyotes as well as the national One-On-One Sports Network.\n\nKCCF 1100 Cave Creek (1996-1997)\n\nKFNX 1100 Cave Creek/Phoenix (1997-)\n\nThis station came on the air in early 1996 as a MOR-Adult Standards station with Bill Heywood doing mornings but it didn't last. Sold to North American Broadcasting a year later. KFNX became a Shlock-talk/infomercial station populated by F-bombing heavy-metal types, snake-oil \"holistic health product\" salesmen, and devotees of one Adolf Hitler. A complete waste of 50,000 watts. Mostly relays WALE in Rhode Island using a bad phone line, although there is some local content.\n\nKZON 1190 Tolleson (1957-196?)\n\nKRDS 1190 Tolleson (196?-1997)\n\nKMYL 1190 Tolleson/Phoenix (1997-)\n\nKMYL was no relation to the current 101.5. Don't know the format at first but it became a Spanish-language station for a while in the '50s.\n\nKRDS replaced Spanish KZON in the early '60s. Was a country station for several years, tried talk in the '70s before going religious around 1977.\n\nKMYL is a Big Band/Adult Standards competitor to KOY since it replaced religious KRDS in mid-1997. Simulcasted on sister-station KMYL-FM Wickenburg until early in 2000 when they sold the station.\n\nKPHO 1230 Phoenix (1940-1949)\n\nKRIZ 1230 Phoenix (1950-1978)\n\nKFLR 1230 Phoenix (1878-1985)\n\nKAMJ 1230 Phoenix (1985-198?)\n\nKMYL 1230 Phoenix (198?-198?)\n\nKAMJ 1230 Phoenix (1988?-1990)\n\nKPMX 1230 Phoenix (1990-1992)\n\nKISP 1230 Phoenix (1992-1995)\n\nKISO 1230 Phoenix (1995-1999)\n\nKOY 1230 (1999-)\n\nKPHO started out on 1230 as an NBC Blue/ABC affiliate. It received a power increase and moved to 910 in 1949. 1230 was not used for several months until KRIZ came on the air in 1950.\n\nKRIZ was a legendary rocker from about 1958-1978. Home of Pat \"Gerald\" McMahon in an earlier life. Sold out to Family Stations in 1978 and preached for 7 years as KFLR until it moved to FM 90.3. Transmitter was (and is) at 23rd Ave. & Buckeye Rd. (Just off I-17).\n\nKAMJ replaced KFLR when that station moved to FM. It was an adult-contemporary station that simulcasted with 101.5.\n\nKMYL was no relation to the current KMYL on 1190, this station replaced, and was succeeded by, KAMJ in the '80s.\n\nThe 2nd KAMJ was a sports-talker. Became KPMX soon after the format change.\n\nKISP, then KISO \"KISS 1230\" was an Urban, then classic-country station. This station was killed off on April 23, 1999 (although the call letters were used until mid-May) when AMFM bought the programming (but not the transmitter) of KGME and moved it to 550 (recently moved again to 910), kicking KOY up the dial to 1230.\n\nKASR 1260 Tempe (1988-1998)\n\nKASC 1260 Tempe (1998-)\n\nStudent-run low-power (Under FCC Part 15) AM station, also known as \"The Blaze\", located on the ASU campus. This 30-watter has enough signal to cover ASU and central Tempe but not much else (officially). Programming can be best described as \"eclectic.\" Was KASR until the FCC actually assigned those calls to a licensed station. Originally a carrier-current station on 680, which is still on the air according to their website.\n\nKHEP 1280 Phoenix (1956-1998)\n\nKTKP 1280 Phoenix (1998-)\n\nLong-time religious station. Daytime-only until the late '80s - now runs 2500 watts days and 49 watts nights. Became conservative-talk KTKP \"Radio Phoenix\" in 1998, but may return to religion since the station was recently purchased by Mortenesen Broadcasting.\n\nThe station has recently been sold to Mortensen Broadcasting and may return to religious programming.\n\nKTYL 1490 Mesa (1946-1952?)\n\nKTYL 1310 Mesa (1952?-1960?)\n\nKBUZ 1310 Mesa/Phoenix (196?-1979)\n\nKZZP 1310 Mesa/Phoenix (1979-1992)\n\nKXAM 1310 Mesa/Scottsdale/Phoenix (1992-)\n\nKTYL was Mesa's first station came on the air in 1946 on 1490 and moved to 1310 a few years later. Operated by the Harkins Theater group, they also founded the first FM station in the valley (KTYL-FM 104.7) in 1950, and Channel 12 in 1953 (then KTYL-TV).\n\nKBUZ was an easy-listening station which simulcasted with KBUZ-FM 104.7 from studios at Thomas Mall (44th St. & Thomas Rd. - now Arcadia Crossing) in the '60s and '70s.\n\nKZZP was the last gasp of AM rock (also on FM 104.7) in Phoenix. Jonathon Brandmeier got his start at this station.\n\nKXAM was Big Band from 1992-1996, then mostly-syndicated talk replacing KUKQ when it changed to KDUS. \"Indpendent 1310\" has a good variety of programming, both network and local. Weak 500 watt signal at night from the north side of Mesa, though.\n\nKRUX 1340 Glendale (1946-1957)\n\nKRUX 1360 Glendale (1957-1976)\n\nKNNS 1360 Glendale (1976-1977)\n\nKLFF 1360 Glendale (1977-1992)\n\nKNNS 1360 Glendale/Phoenix (1992-1994)\n\nKGME 1360 Glendale/Phoenix (1994-1999)\n\nKFDJ 1360 Glendale (1999)\n\nKCTK 1360 Glendale/Phoenix (1999)\n\nKPXQ 1360 Glendale/Phoenix (1999-)\n\nKRUX debuted in 1946 as a 250 watt station on 1340. Was known in its early days for overmodulation (and resulting FCC fines). Moved to 1360 with a power increase in 1957. KRUX was a legendary Rock & Roll station in the Valley from 1957 to 1975. KNNS (first one) Broadcast NBC's ill-fated News and Information Service for about a year and a half after KRUX bit the dust. Became KLFF when NBC-NIS kicked the bucket.\n\nKLFF was a big-band station catering to older people that lasted for years. KNNS (2nd one) Yet another try at an all-news station. It was about as successful as the '70s effort (NOT!).\n\nSportsRadio 1360 was originally called \"The Game\" when it debuted in late 1993 still using the KNNS call letters. Became KGME in March 1994. When New Century Arizona sold the 1360 frequency to Salem it sold the programming and personnel to AMFM who moved KGME to 550 (and later 910 as XTRA Sports 910), moved KOY from 550 to 1230, and killed KISO. 550 still ID'ed as KOY and 1230 still ID'ed as KISO until May 1999 when the call-letter switch was approved by the FCC. 1360 was upgraded from 5000 to 50,000 watts days in July 1998 when KGME was there (still 1000 watts at night).\n\nA total of 4 call letters were used on 1360 in 1999: KGME until May, KFDJ from May to August, KCTK in August and September, and KPXQ since. This station now carries religious programming.\n\nKONI 1400 Phoenix (1950-1954)\n\nKXIV 1400 Phoenix (1954-1978)\n\nKSUN 1400 Phoenix (1978-1984)\n\nKSUN 1400 Phoenix (1985-)\n\nEarly independent station when the others still carried network radio. Became KXIV in 1954.\n\nKXIV was owned by comedian/actor Dick VanDyke for several years. Carried Suns games in the early & mid '70s. Otherwise was a KOY/KOOL clone with a much poorer signal (1000 W days/250 W nights). Former call letters: KONI.\n\nKSUN was the successor to KXIV when Dick VanDyke sold the station. Left the air in 1984.\n\nThe current KSUN is not related to the old one except for the call letters and transmitter. It is a Spanish-language station.\n\nKPOK 1440 Scottsdale (1958-196?)\n\nKDOT 1440 Scottsdale (196?-1976)\n\nKOPA 1440 Scottsdale (197?-198?)\n\nKXAM 1440 Scottsdale (198?-19??)\n\nKSGR 1440 Scottsdale (198?-199?)\n\nKOPA 1440 Scottsdale (199?-1995)\n\nKSLX 1440 Scottsdale/Phoenix (1995-)\n\nKPOK was the first station in Scottsdale and tried to keep with the city's then-cowboy image.\n\nKDOT was an easy-listening station simulcasted with 100.7.\n\nKOPA was another Top-40 competitor to KRIZ when KRUX bit the dust.\n\nKXAM was no relation to the current AM 1310. Was an R&B station, formerly KOPA. This one must not have lasted long.\n\nThe 2nd incarnation of KOPA was AM-only and carried CNN Headline News. Nobody listened so then they just started simulcasting KSLX-FM again, changing the 1440 callsign in 1995.\n\nThe last daytimer in the valley - a waste of electricity carrying classic-rock (simulcasting KSLX-FM 100.7) for no reason whatsoever.\n\nKHAT 1480 Phoenix (1956-1972)\n\nKPHX 1480 Phoenix (1972-)\n\nKHAT was a daytime-only country station. Changed calls to KPHX and tried all-news in 1972-73. It didn't work and switched to Spanish-language in 1973. The home for Diamondbacks baseball in Spanish.\n\nKALF 1510 Mesa (1962-1968)\n\nKMND 1510 Mesa (196?-1971)\n\nKDKB 1510 Mesa (1971-198?)\n\nKDJQ 1510 Mesa/Phoenix (198?-1987)\n\nKJAA 1510 Mesa/Phoenix (1987-1991)\n\nKFNN 1510 Mesa/Phoenix (1991-)\n\nOriginal call letters for the current KFNN. It was a country station licensed to Mesa. This station came on the air in 1962 as a 10,000 watt daytimer with a transmitter near Country Club Dr. (AZ 87) & Broadway Rd. in Mesa.\n\n\"Command Country\" replaced KALF. Went bust in 1971 and was bought out by Dwight-Karma Broadcasting and became KDKB. Still around on FM 93.3.\n\nAfter KDKB went FM-only they tried soft-rock on 1510 as KDJQ. Didn't go.\n\nKJAA Replaced KDJQ about 1987 and tried to be a reincarnation of the by-now-defunct KJJJ. It didn't last long.\n\nKFNN is a financial-news station licensed to Mesa but now located in Phoenix. Formerly a 10,000 watt daytimer, it raised its power to 22,000 watts days and 100 watts nights in 1998. It moved its transmitter from near Broadway & Country Club in Mesa to a shared site with KCTK 960 in far-north Phoenix at the same time. The nighttime signal barely makes it south of Shea Blvd. Old call letters: KALF, KMND, KDKB, KDJQ, KJAA.\n\nKASA 1540 Phoenix (1964-)\n\nSpanish-language religious station since 1964. A 10,000 daytimer (OK, it runs a whole 19 watts at night) from a transmitter near 16th St. & Baseline Rd.\n\nKYND 1580 Tempe (1960-196?)\n\nKTUF 1580 Tempe/Phoenix (196?-197?)\n\nKNIX 1580 Tempe/Phoenix (197?-199?)\n\nKCWW 1580 Tempe/Phoenix (199?-1997)\n\nKMIK 1580 Tempe/Phoenix (1998-)\n\nKYND was the valley's first 50,000 watt station (although it was a daytimer until the KNIX era). KTUF was a Country station (owned by Buck Owens) simulcasting KNIX 102.5. Later became Since KTUF had simulcasted KNIX-FM 102.5 as KTUF for years Owens made it official. Went full-time 50,000 watts during this era.\n\nKCWW (aka KCW) was a classic-country station that was separated from KNIX in the early '90s. Sold by Owens Broadcasting to ABC/Disney in 1997.\n\nThe valley's only full-time 50 kW stick has been Radio Disney (ABC's only O&O here) since 1997."
