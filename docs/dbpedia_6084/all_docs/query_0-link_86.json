He was the one that taught me how to really listen to shortwave radio and will be missed (Bruce MacGibbon, Gresham, OR, Sept 30, DX LISTENING DIGEST) Bob, as well as Bruce, will be remembered as editors of SPEEDXGRAM ** AFGHANISTAN. KABUL RADIO STARTS BUZZING AGAIN KABUL: Two years ago, Massood Sanjer was reading the news in English for the Taliban's Radio Shariat. Today he is one of Kabul's popular disc jockeys, broadcasting from a studio adorned with posters of Shakira and Destiny's Child. Sanjer works for Arman FM, the nearest thing the Afghan capital has to MTV, with a mix of music, chat and jokes. For a country starved of entertainment through years of war and repressive Taliban rule, Arman FM is like a breath of fresh air. \"Once a colleague of mine on Radio Shariat made a mistake translating something,\" Sanjer recalled. \"They locked him up in a container for three days with just one piece of bread and a boiled potato.\" Sanjer, who put up the posters himself, cannot begin to compare his old and new lives. These days, he says, he can say anything he wants on air. But what makes Arman FM even more exceptional in this conservative Muslim land is that half its presenters are women, Sanjer shares his morning show with Zarlasht Madad, a soft-spoken young women recently voted the station's most popular. Arman FM was the brainchild of Afghan-Australian brothers Saad, Jahid and Zaid Mohseni and their cousin Najib Thamas. But its success since its launch in April has surpassed their wildest dreams. The presenters get 500 letters a day from Kabulis, 100 emails and when the lines are working, 1,500 phone calls, says Saad Mohseni, a former investment banker from Melbourne. \"We just wanted to give people what they want,\" he said. \"But the response has been phenomenal, What people want is mostly Indian music, songs from their favourite Bollywood movies, according to the requests which pour in every day, Sanjer says. Western music also gets a look in, especially Shakira's Arabic- influenced pop. Madonna goes down well too. But Mohseni cannot resist a plug for Australian culture. \"We play a lot of Kylie Minogue,\" he said. \"She is very popular, and given that she's also from Melbourne we like her.\" The Mohsenis put up half of the $500,000 to launch Arman; the name means Hope in the Dari language. The other half was supplied by USAID, the development arm of the US government. But Saad Mohseni, who plans to expand to other parts of the country when funding allows, insists the station is run like a business and is already making a profit from advertising. But it also aims to put something back by stimulating Afghans to start recording music again. Auditions are already being held for the 2003 Arman awards for local groups and singers, the winners will get the chance to cut their own CD. One of Arman's strengths is that it allows people to escape their problems and entertains rather than lectures. \"Most people believe they don't have to hear about religion on the radio,\" Mohseni said. \"I'm sure on other outlets they can hear more politics and religion, so we concentrate on general information and music.\" Sometimes though, problems of an entirely different nature do crop up. The station will soon start a kind of \"agony aunt\" advice show, after a young couple wrote in threatening suicide because the woman's parents were planning to marry her off to someone else. In the early days, Arman was criticised because some of its presenters used the slang Dari of the streets rather than the formal language used by broadcasters in the past. Its irreverent attitude and jokey manner also alienated some people. \"The criticism is like a drop in the ocean,\" Sanjer insists. \"It was the first time Afghans listened to a radio station with men and women chatting and laughing, but now they have got used to it. We don't get criticised any more.\" Judging by the reaction in the streets of Kabul, Arman FM has got it just about right for most people. White-bearded shopkeeper Farouq danced among the bolts of brightly- coloured cloth in his store as he described his love of music. \"Arman is very good music radio, without much news, so we can forget our problems while listening to it,\" he said. \"You can see I look old, but I enjoy my life like a teenager.\" - Reuters (via Mike Terry, DXLD) ** AFGHANISTAN [non]. 15615, APA R.

R2 has been readjusted and is now back on 612. I read this is operated by two 50 kW senders installed in the mid 1970's - not by the old 566 transmitter (Noel R. Green, UK, BC-DX Sept 22 via DXLD) RTE's 612 kHz Athlone transmitter is again radiating off channel at approx. 611.8 kHz today (Wednesday 24th), having briefly reverted to 612 kHz some time yesterday (Tuesday 23rd). So we're back to a howl on the channel this evening. I understand that RTE has two 50 kW 1970s transmitters in use at Athlone for this frequency, so it may be that one or both of the two units is faulty. The signal strength seems very weak at the moment, I'd be surprised if it is radiating anywhere near full power. Does anyone know the email address of RTE's transmitter maintenance department? 73s (Dave Kenny, UK, BDXC-UK via DXLD) What does it howl against on 612.0? (gh) Glenn, Can I rest assure your listeners that RTÉ's 2FM mediumwave transmitter in Athlone was purchased from Japan in 1979 - these were in fact two 50 kw transmitters. The old 1950's vintage went off the air around 1974 when the 500 kw transmitter opened in Tullamore. When 2FM started in 1979 most of the listeners were on mediumwave as FM (or VHF as was known in these parts until the mid 1980s) was a minority hobby. Now FM is the most popular and in recent years mediumwave has opted out from time to time to bring minority interests programmes such as services for asylum seekers etc. It has also be suggested in the recent past, when finances were better, that RTÉ would used the transmitter for a dedicated news/current affairs and sports station along the lines of BBC Radio 5 Live. I came across an interesting website some of your listeners may be interested in as it deals with Ireland's radio history including its shortwave broadcasting experiences.

In your recent report of the EDXC meeting, you're quoted as saying that Arthur Cushen's QSL collection is one of the four largest in the world and located in Invercargill, NZ. For the record, the Archives of the NZ Radio DX League are currently located at the Hocken Library, in Dunedin, New Zealand. The Archives contain many thousands of QSLs and other radio ephemera from a large number of NZ DXers. In fact, it's estimated that 100,000+ verifications may be in the current collection. Arthur Cushen's QSL collection does not form part of the NZRDXL Archives. It is managed by the Hocken Library together with the NZRDXL Archives because of similarity of material. Whilst Arthur's collection is historically significant, it forms only about 10% of the total material held at the Hocken Library, the bulk of which includes collections from a large number of other NZ DXers. Much more material (an estimated 200,000 + additional QSLs and associated ephemera) is available to be added to the Archives. The Heritage Committee and Administration Committee of the NZRDXL is currently considering proposals to actively manage the NZRDXL Archives. A core part of the project is to catalog and scan for on- line access all current QSLs in the combined Arthur Cushen and NZRDXL Archives collections. This aspect of the project has a budget in excess of Euro 100,000 for which funding will shortly be sought by a newly established non-profit charitable organisation. Work is scheduled to begin in early 2004 as part of a three-year plan. I believe the NZRDXL Archives, even as they are today, are the largest listener based such collection in the world.

The program consists of ranchero to up-beat dance music with very few announcements, at times just a few words in Spanish. Checked 7370 for a parallel, noted a carrier on 7370.1 with little or no audio. Possibly thinking it might be Radio América, ZP20 I fired off my details to Adán Mur requesting if they where transmitting on any of the above frequencies.

We have tested our new transmitter site, in Villeta, on several frequencies, and have had spectacular results; having received reports from twenty different countries! We hope to resume transmissions, soon, on the frequencies 7370, and 9905 kHz. That, of 41 metres, will serve the interior of Paraguay. That, of 31 metres, will serve the MERCOSUR region.

My opinion is that you have heard the University Station, in Managua, Nicaragua, which has recently commenced operations on 9905, with a power of 1 kW.

We`ve already thought about extending you an invitation under the general heading ``Christmas in Romania``. As usual, you will have to answer a few questions in writing. Stay tuned to RRI, give the correct answers and --- we`ll see you in December in Romania. The competition will be on until November 15 and as usual you wouldn`t like to miss out on quite a few interesting prizes, offered by the Local Councils of Arad and Valcea Counties. The big prizes are two 7- day stays in Romania for two (non inclusive of visa fees and transport fares to Romania) - the winners and one partner of their own choosing, between December 22nd and 28th, in Arad county and Valcea county, respectively. The winners will be given an opportunity to get to see the most interesting places in the two counties and experience, together with their hosts, Christmas as we do it in Romania. Here are the questions: When do Romanians traditionally celebrate Christmas? What`s the name of the river that crosses the county and the city of Arad ? On August 11th, 1999, the city of Ramnicu Valcea was the point of maximum visibility for a major astronomic phenomenon. What was that phenomenon?

Ex 1570 MW. Reading the MW column in the April issue of SWN I discovered, thanks to Kyriakos Dritsas, the e- mail address of a former manager of Atlantic Beacon now at R Vision Cristiana. As in the past (1987!) I've never received a reply after several attempts to the station, so I decided to try now again sending an e- mail to Mr. Wendell Seymour. He answered me quickly but saying me that at the time he did not see and answer the reception report, so he was not able to help me. I immediately sent another mail writing that I could send that reception report once again as it was in my computer memory! After that Mr. Wendell wrote me: \"I think that I could find an original Atlantic Beacon QSL card, send me the report and I will mail you a QSL card\". He understood that I WANTED that verification. So after 50 days I finally got my original Atlantic Beacon QSL card and my 166th EDXC Country verified. If you want to count the time from the first report, look well, it's just 16 years and 2 days! Isn't it a record?

The BBCWS launches DRM MW to Europe... VT MERLIN COMMUNICATIONS UNVEIL UK'S FIRST HIGH POWER MEDIUM WAVE DIGITAL TRANSMITTER --- PRESS RELEASE 29th September 2003 On the 24th September - Simon Tarrant, Managing Director, VT Support Services and Benny Ammar, Head of Go Digital, BBC World Service jointly unveiled the UK's first medium wave Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM) transmitter. The event took place at VT Merlin Communications site at Orfordness, East Anglia. The new transmitter joins the current analogue BBC World Service transmitters for Western Europe (648 kHz and 1296 kHz) located at the same site. The opening ceremony was attended by 60 guests from around the world, who watched Benny Ammar start the first official transmission. This £500,000 project was the first major investment in new transmission plant since Merlin Communications was acquired by the VT Group in 2001. The DRM digital radio system allows for crystal clear high fidelity reception of radio in the short, medium and long wave bands, and overcomes the problems of interference, fading and poor audio quality often associated with \"AM\" radio. The transmitter and associated digital equipment were supplied by Canadian Manufacturer Nautel, and German companies Telefunken and Fraunhofer Institute. The transmitter will allow high-quality reception of World Service in the Netherlands, much of Belgium, Luxembourg, and Northern France. During night-time the 1296 kHz signal may also reach Germany. Over the next year, engineers will accurately evaluate the coverage parameters.

Did anyone else note some odd interference during the WBCQ \"Area 51\" program on Sunday evening (0000 UT Monday hour 9/29/03) on 5105 kHz? This was during their \"Firesign Theatre\" hour, and seemed to stop during (or at the start of) the following hour of Allen Weiner's radio-receiver discussion. (The latter was very interesting, by the way; hope he airs repeats you can catch later this week.) I had never encountered interference just like this: it was a periodic noise burst, usually about three seconds long, like a hiss or high- audio-frequency buzz, that happened at intervals. The intervals varied from about 20 seconds to 45 seconds between incidents, with some gaps of over a minute at times. It almost sounded like it was part of the original audio; since the Firesign Theatre plays around with sound effects, when I first tuned in about 10 minutes into the hour's program, I actually thought it was part of the program, something intended to make it sound like poor radio reception. But then it obscured enough of the content that I decided that could not be intentional in the original. Yet it DID stop when the programming changed over to the next hour! Could it have been some digital artifact in the program recording? I know little of digital audio, MP-encoding and the like. If no one else heard it, I suppose it would have to be local RF interference, but it is a new one and the fact that it seemed linked to the program content argues against it being random electrical noise.

Radio K marks 10 years of student-run music September 30, 2003 By Chelsie Hanstad http://www.daily.umn.edu/articles/2003/09/30/6752 Radio K, the University`s student-run radio station, will celebrate its 10th anniversary in October. Over its 10 years in existence, Radio K has helped build a sense of community, both in the University and in the greater Twin Cities, Radio K marketing director Tracy Labernik said. The radio station was first formed in 1993 from two smaller stations already at the University. The first, KUOM, was the oldest radio station in Minnesota and was acquired in the 1920s. Students created the other, WMMR, in the 1940s. WMMR broadcast through a cable into residence halls, Radio K programming director Mark Wheat said. A budget crisis in the mid-1980s caused the Board of Regents to consider selling one of the stations. One student, Jim Musil, said they should not sell. He suggested they run KUOM as a student radio station. The regents combined the two stations, and on Oct. 1, 1993, students took over KUOM. Radio K is now one of the largest college radio stations in the country, with between 2,000 and 3,000 student listeners. It employs five full-time professional staff and 17 part-time student employees. The station also has larger facilities and a greater listening audience than many college stations. ``In the top 10, you might find two or three bigger,`` Wheat said. ``And none raise as much money.`` Twice a year, the radio station holds a pledge drive to raise money to meet its $500,000 operating budget. The most recent drive raised more than $85,000. Radio K often helps bring recognition to local groups. ``It brings attention to artists who normally don`t get it,`` said Danny Sigelman of the Electric Fetus in Minneapolis, a store that sells local bands` CDs. ``It`s an obvious contingent. People will come in and say, `I heard this on Radio K, do you have it?` `` In a time when corporations buy many local radio stations and decide which music to play, Radio K gives local musicians an opportunity to be heard in their hometown, local musician and promoter J.G. Everest said. ``No band really gets big in town without the help of Radio K,`` Everest said. Labernik said Radio K also provides many opportunities for high school students. It hosts an annual battle of the bands for high school musicians. The Breakfast Club is the station`s show for high school students` participation. Radio K is also involved in the timeshare of an FM station in St. Louis Park, Minn., with St. Louis Park High School, Labernik said. The high school uses the station during the day and Radio K uses it nights and holidays when school is not in session. The station also hosts several events for local charities, Labernik said. To celebrate its 10-year anniversary, the station organized a month-long celebration. Thirteen concerts featuring local bands, as well as special on-air programming, will go on through October (Minnesota Daily Sept 30 via Artie Bigley, DXLD) WTF --- K??? ** URUGUAY [and non]. Re 3-172: Glenn, Original info was mine, not from friend Colacce, and was delivered via Conexión Digital. Dorner doesn't mention the original source. That's not really important but what is new to me is the info about Radio Américas. Fqcy? SW? Didn't have that... ``Recently Radio Americas, a powerful shortwave station and AM station operated by Protestants began operations in Uruguay, a small country of about 68,000 square miles on the central Atlantic Coast.`` 73 (Horacio Nigro, Montevideo, Uruguay, Sept. 30, DX LISTENING DIGEST) I bet this was confused with the R. América in PARAguay, and it`s anything but powerful! (gh, DXLD) He is right. Paraguay. Rush of getting it out on Sat a.m. I read Conexión Digital and saw something regarding Nigro's piece, but it did not strike me that it was clear about the pending purchase by the Church. I no longer have that issue (I think), but I remember thinking that this would be interesting if true. I do not know in what issue he reported on that; it was in the middle perhaps of all my computer trouble and certain items were lost out of e-mail and could not be retrieved. Perhaps what I saw was a later report on the developments, but again it was uncertain. Colacce did report the item to me, and did mention that Nigro had written it in CD, too. But he wrote me that HE, Colacce, had read the items in the Montevidean papers; I cannot access the archives of the newspaper that first reported the news, and had no success in finding the information in the other daily. I did find the item on the Uruguayan portal. If I had heard the item from Nigro, or saw it clearly as an actual development reported by him, I would have credited him. But the news came from Colacce on Saturday morning; that was my first reception of a clear item from anyone about the station. Mr. Nigro does not read CRU/RCD as far as I know; I have no contact with him at all. That should set the record straight. There are a lot of questions about this. Exactly who in Italy is funding it is interesting -- the Bishops Conference? Radio Maria? An quasi or independent church agency? Or the Italian office of a church worldwide organization such as Church in Need? Matters like purchases of stations are always delicate; the Latin American Church, in addition, is not noted for openness with the press (Mike Dorner, LA of CRU, Sept 30, DX LISTENING DIGEST) No problem for the credits! It goes just for clarity on the most interesting facts about this item, for now: This stops my queries I have already started here in the Uruguayan radio field. And, secondly agree that the inner story of this transaction between R. Oriental and the Catholic church whatever be their branch is still a matter of dilucidation.

Bush administration aides see this as an unpredictably dangerous mix and are gathering more information about the intentions of a country that sits 1,000 miles south of Florida... ...The FARC's principal camp in Venezuela is in the Perijá mountains near an Indian village called Resumidero, according to maps and testimony from FARC deserters. The Resumidero base is home to one of the FARC's top leaders, Iván Márquez, and can accommodate 700 people. Márquez commands 1,000 fighters and, according to one deserter's account, oversees the training of hundreds more would-be guerrillas. A clandestine FARC radio station is located about 30 miles away, on the Colombian-Venezuelan border. Resumidero, which has 100 huts and three houses for Márquez and other leaders, is two days' walk from another camp called Asamblea, near the city of Machiques, which is about 35 miles inside Venezuelan territory. That camp, which has 25 houses and even Internet access, is used to train still more more fighters...

This is potentially a very serious issue for DXers as I have heard that trials in the UK a while ago showed that it could cause severe interference right across the shortwave bands.... Sunday 28 September, 2003 IARU SUBMITS PAPER TO EUROPEAN COMMISSION PLT WORKSHOP Listeners may have seen an item on the Internet where the European Commission is calling for input papers for a PLT workshop for national regulators to be held on the 16th of October in Brussels. PLT remains a major threat to HF communications. IARU Region 1 has submitted a detailed paper for the workshop to the European Commission, setting out the problems that PLT creates for HF communications in general, and radio amateurs in particular. The paper argues for sensible emission limits from PLT systems, and backs up its assertions by referencing work done by a number of organisations, including the RSGB, to monitor and assess the trials of PLT that have taken place in a number of countries over the last few years. Although it will not be allowed for amateur radio to be represented in person at the workshop on the 16th of October, the IARU hopes that its paper will carry some weight in the discussions (via Dave Kenny, BDXC-UK via DXLD) BPL AND OTHER SPECTRUM THREATS I'd like to make three points here: 1. Steady, continuing pressure is better than a large single emotional outcry. Why? They, the ones who wish to implement whatever just wait for the storm to blow over, so to speak. 2. Our collective power is votes, not money. Yes, make your well reasoned and hopefully technically sound comments to the FCC, but also write your representatives in Congress. It may also be helpful to write to the ones who are in charge of \"oversight\" committees. A concerned voter is a registered voter and may not vote for the incumbent if their concerns are not addressed. Final hint: mention/list memberships in relevant clubs, now you are a group and have group power. Strange as it might seem, power perceived is power achieved. 3. Finally the \"sky is falling\" commentaries occur are too often and too fatalistic. This causes people to throw up their hands and give up. Far too many people do not participate in government at any level anymore because they believe that it won't count. It does count, but don't expect to see instant results. An entity as large as a national government moves slowly. There are checks and balances, Congress will react, if it is properly motivated. Right now Chairman Powell is facing strong backlash from Congress over actions taken earlier this year. 4. We are approaching an election year. Candidates right now are grasping for issues to talk about to gain support for their campaigns. Opportunity knocks once again. Obligatory SWL connection: Our hobby makes us better informed. We know the Japanese tried and abandoned BPL and lost much money in the process. We know the problems some European countries are currently having with BPL. Why? We listen to shortwave radio and talk to each other. 73, (Mark N3IRJ Clark, Sept 25, swl at qth.net via DXLD) BPL COMMENTS I have sent the following letter to all five FCC Commissioners, all 3 congressional representatives and both senators from West Virginia, President Bush and Vice President Cheney. Please feel free to copy it, add your comments and send them on as well. We need to make some noise against this very bad idea before the FCC just sticks it down our throats. A google search for White House, Senate, House of Reprehensive, and FCC will get you the addresses for your respective congress person or senator. Please take the time to forward this on to them. The more contacts they get against this the better chance we have of stopping it. Larry N4SEA Cover letter: I am enclosing a copy of an e-mail letter I sent to each of the five FCC commissioners. The letter expresses my feelings concerning the BPL or Broadband Over Power Line issue. An issue I'm afraid the FCC is only looking at from one side. I would appreciate it if you could take the time to look at this and address it. It does require immediate attention. I also urge you or one of your staff to check out the links in the message to the FCC. They support my arguments against this very bad idea that the FCC seems very ready to put into being. Thank you. Larry R. Fravel, RT 1 Box 143 A, Shinnston, WV 26431-9722, 304-592- 0072 Actual letter: As an amateur radio operator and an internet/computer enthusiast and user I want to state that I am completely and utterly in disagreement with you comments concerning Broad Band over Power Lines (BPL) and its implementation. This so called great opportunity is only a great opportunity to those that would sell and provide the services. The amateur radio community, the short wave broadcast industry, the short wave listeners of the world, and to some extent the AM broadcast band broadcasters and listeners it will be a complete disaster. It has been proven in numerous tests conducted by the ARRL and others that BPL will and does cause harmful interference to licensed radio services to such an extent that in some instances the services become unusable. Now the NTIA has expressed similar concerns regarding this cash cow for the utility companies. As a licensed radio operator I am required by law not to cause harmful interference to any other licensed service, and Part 15 of the FCC regulations require that unlicensed radiators do not cause me or other licensed services harmful. Interference. When a signal between the frequency ranges of 2 MHz to 60 MHz is transmitted along thousands of miles of unshielded wire the wire becomes on giant antenna that radiates that signal in an omni-direction pattern and the signal overrides any other signal weaker than itself. This causes lack of reception of the weaker signal. That means that leg mate amateur radio communications that just might be in the process of providing disaster communications, homeland security communications, or assisting a ship or boat in danger of sinking is interrupted with terrible results. All because someone had to have that \"faster download and connection speed\". The reverse is also true. The power line wires also become giant receiving antennas and any transmitter that emits a signal greater than the one being carried on the power lines has the potential to interfere with the signal being carried over the power lines. The only difference here is that the signal being transmitted through the air and interfering with the BPL transmission is a licensed radiator and according to FCC regulations the owner of the receiving device has the onus on them to shield their device or replace it with one that will not receive the interference. Are you also going to require that the power companies, businesses, and all home owners replace all power cables throughout the country with coaxial cable, properly grounded of course, in order to help eliminate the interface from licensed radiators? I think not. Cable Television Operators have made the AM Broadcast band almost unusable in most areas of the country because of the high leakage interference and nothing is done about that. It is more \"cost effective\" (translated cheaper) for the cable company to ignore the problem rather than repair it until they are required to by the FCC - a very rare occurrence. It is next to impossible to get a power company to come out and investigate a case of power line interference without persistent complaints that sometimes take months to get through because \"they are under staffed\". Are you going to require the power companies the provide the proper staffing levels to handle the complaints? If you do any profit from this so called \"Nirvana\" will be eaten up in labor costs shortly after the first download is completed. Please refer to http://www.arrl.org/announce/regulatory/et03-104/ and http://www.arrl.org/tis/info/HTML/plc/ BPL is bad for all the reasons listed above and many more. It will cause devastating interference to those that are now licensed to use the radio spectrum. It will also cause the licensed users of the same radio spectrum to interfere with the BPL users. I urge you not to allow this to happen. Technology is a wonderful thing when properly applied and used. BPL is not one of those cases (Larry R.

The period began at quiet to occasionally active levels on 22-23 September. Geomagnetic activity increased on 24-25 September as a coronal hole rotated into geoeffective position producing mostly unsettled to minor storm levels. As the coronal hole high speed flow began to wane on 26 September activity was at unsettled to active levels. Activity form the remainder of the period, 27-28 September was at quiet to unsettled levels. FORECAST OF SOLAR AND GEOMAGNETIC ACTIVITY 01 - 27 OCTOBER 2003 Solar activity is expected to range from very low to low levels with a chance of isolated M-class events. Region 464 has the potential for isolated M-class activity early in the period before it rotates beyond the west limb on 03 October. Region 471 rotated onto the visible disk on 30 September and is most likely old Region 456 (S08, L=222), which was quite active as it rotated beyond the west limb on its last rotation. Region 471 may keep activity levels somewhat enhanced. No greater than 10 MeV proton events at geosynchronous orbit are expected during the period. The greater than 2 MeV electron flux at geosynchronous orbit is expected to reach high levels on 02 - 05 October, 07 - 09 October, and 17 - 26 October. The geomagnetic field is expected to range from quiet to major storm levels during the period. A returning coronal hole is expected on 05 - 08 October and could produce active to isolated minor storm levels. A large coronal hole is due to return on 14 - 22 October and is expected to produce major storm levels. :Product: 27-day Space Weather Outlook Table 27DO.txt :Issued: 2003 Sep 30 2211 UTC # Prepared by the US Dept. of Commerce, NOAA, Space Environment Center # Product description and SEC contact on the Web # http://www.sec.noaa.gov/wwire.html # # 27-day Space Weather Outlook Table # Issued 2003 Sep 30 # # UTC Radio Flux Planetary Largest # Date 10.7 cm A Index Kp Index 2003 Oct 01 125 20 4 2003 Oct 02 115 15 3 2003 Oct 03 110 12 3 2003 Oct 04 105 10 3 2003 Oct 05 100 10 3 2003 Oct 06 100 20 4 2003 Oct 07 100 20 4 2003 Oct 08 95 15 3 2003 Oct 09 95 12 3 2003 Oct 10 95 12 3 2003 Oct 11 95 10 3 2003 Oct 12 95 10 3 2003 Oct 13 100 30 5 2003 Oct 14 105 45 6 2003 Oct 15 110 35 6 2003 Oct 16 112 30 5 2003 Oct 17 112 25 5 2003 Oct 18 120 20 4 2003 Oct 19 125 20 4 2003 Oct 20 125 15 3 2003 Oct 21 130 30 5 2003 Oct 22 130 25 5 2003 Oct 23 130 20 4 2003 Oct 24 130 10 3 2003 Oct 25 135 10 3 2003 Oct 26 135 10 3 2003 Oct 27 130 10 3 (from http://www.sec.noaa.gov/radio via DXLD) ### |||||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| DX LISTENING DIGEST 3-172, September 29, 2003 edited by Glenn Hauser Items from DXLD may be reproduced and re-reproduced only if full credit be maintained at all stages and we be provided exchange copies.

BBC CREDIBILITY CONTINUES UNDER ATTACK from the September 24, 2003 Christian Science Monitor BBC row spurs call for reform --- Admissions of errors in an explosive report leave the state-funded broadcaster open to censure By Mark Rice-Oxley | Special to The Christian Science Monitor LONDON - A BBC reporter's admission of inaccuracies in an explosive broadcast accusing the government of overstating Iraq's weapons capability has added a new twist to a tortuous saga, raising questions about the role and regulation of the British Broadcasting Corp. Andrew Gilligan, who touched off a firestorm in May with allegations that the government misled the country about Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction, confessed last week that he had made several mistakes in the report. Mr. Gilligan stood by the main thrust of his broadcast - that the government exaggerated the WMD threat to make war more palatable to a skeptical public - but apologized for casual errors that, ironically, \"sexed up\" his own report.

Re British TV Licence --- Fascinating reading in the latest DXLD about the BBC TV license and detector vans. Makes one wonder: Is the license to a location or an individual or family or group of co-residents? I do seem to recall that it is NOT to each individual TV, though it may have been like that in the past. If to a location, what happens when people move? If to a family, what about when a family member temporarily moves to another location and takes a TV (like a kid going to boarding school or college dorm) but is intending to move back home later? How do they handle portable TVs, especially handheld pocket models? What do commercial establishments, like hotels with a TV in each room, pay? Some discounted rate, or the full rate per room? What about something like a sports bar with a whole batch of TVs in one room? How do the detector vans discern the difference between computer monitors or security-video monitors and broadcast-tuning TVs? If a US person temporarily residing in Britain brings over an NTSC TV and VCR or DVD player to play a collection of discs or tapes, is it detectable? Is a license fee required for it, even though it cannot receive British broadcast signals? 73, (Will Martin, MO, DX LISTENING DIGEST) ** U K. GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCES NEW POWERS TO COMBAT PIRATE BROADCASTERS New powers of arrest were introduced on the 18th of September in an attempt to combat pirate radio stations. The police, working with Radiocommunications Agency investigators, will now be able to arrest a pirate broadcaster or anybody suspected of supporting or facilitating illegal broadcasting. Previously police could only detain someone if they suspected them of giving a false name and address or another criminal act, such as a breach of the peace or assault. The new powers of arrest will also extend to acts of deliberate interference with radio communications and hoax calls, especially false distress calls. The Communications Minister Stephen Timms said: ``These new powers will be an important weapon in the campaign against pirate broadcasters. By interfering with communications services which are vital for public safety, pirates can put lives at risk. They also cause interference with other licensed radio users and can be a social nuisance to those who live near pirate stations.`` Pirates detained under t"
