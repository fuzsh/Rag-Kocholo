        "text": "One of the most unique opportunities in radio, for on-air at Hubbard Radio's myTalk 107.1 Minneapolis-St. Paul. This is the only pop-culture personality/talk radio brand in the U.S. After a successful 22-year run, the afternoon drive show \"Lori & Julia\" will soon be leaving the brand that they helped create. Looking for funny, smart, authentic, socially connected talent to contribute to the long-running Marconi-award winning brand that stands for topical, entertainment talk. A choice opportunity for radio, digital, podcasting entertainer(s). WTF - Where Talk is Fun https://lnkd.in/gGqCDxTy\n\nFrom last week's NAB: Data from the recent presentation by Joe D'Angelo, Senior VP of Broadcast Radio and Digital Audio, Xperi. On the left, the number of connected cars in these markets. To the right, the footprint of Hubbard Radio's WRMF West Palm extends beyond the West Palm market, and deep into the Miami market as well. It is the 1st inning of understanding this important information to support both radio sales and programming. But the sample size is only growing with more connected cars coming online. Special on-air tentpole events, format changes, most utilized traffic lanes for station specific audiences measured.\n\nJelly Roll, Beyonce', Noah Kahan and many others have offered the world exciting and varied sounds of music in 2023-2024. And, Taylor Swift continues to offer radio the opportunity to become the town hall meeting, for whenever she makes news or music or tours. (To the euphoria of Michael Jackson in 1983-84 and The Beatles in the 60's) Hubbard Radio's Patti Marshall and team at Q102 Cincinnati gave listeners the opportunity to qualify for a trip to see Taylor in Paris. Leading up to the finale' and the drop of the new album. #WKRQ\n\nYesterday afternoon, the Hubbard Radio programming team zoom call ended, when a breaking news alert came in from our friends at RAMP. It is an honor to work with our brands and leadership at KBHP, KPNW, KQMV, KTMY, WMBX, WTMX, WTOP, B105, WJJY and of course founding FM- KS95. Congratulations to all finalists, and all of our teams for serving the communities the way you do, every day. Local entertainment, local brands, local engagement, local leadership.

Only 11 other stations have ever received this honor.\n\nToday is National World Radio Day. I am often asked, how is radio doing in 2024? The answer: the consumer is actually spending more time listening to audio than in previous years. (Over 4 hours a day). Within the audio spectrum, radio remains #1 for daily reach, and for \"Share of Time Spent Listening\". Proud of our team of on-air talent, managers and programmers that make the difference at Hubbard Radio. (Courtesy of Edison Research/\"Share of Ear\" study)\n\nWrapping up our third, and final day of the Hubbard Radio Brand/Content Director meetings, joined by our market managers, in the very successful Cincinnati creative outpost of Hubbard Radio. Many things discussed: wins celebrated, the challenges, and the opportunities ahead. Some of the brightest outside industry thinkers and speakers joined the finest radio management team in the business. As Chair/CEO Ginny Morris put it, \"We play the long game\"."
