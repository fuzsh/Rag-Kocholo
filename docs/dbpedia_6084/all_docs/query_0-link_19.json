and (ii) the Company (immediately following such contribution and distribution) to merge with and into Acquiror, as a result of which the stockholders of the Company immediately prior to such merger will become stockholders of Acquiror; and\n\nWHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes, it is intended that such transactions will qualify as reorganizations within the meaning of Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code, respectively; and\n\nWHEREAS, the parties hereto have determined to amend certain provisions of this Agreement and to amend and restate this Agreement in accordance herewith.\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations, warranties and agreements set forth below, the parties hereto agree as follows:\n\nARTICLE I\n\nTHE MERGER\n\n1.01. THE MERGER. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, at the Effective Time: (i) the Company shall be merged with and into Acquiror (the Merger) and the separate existence of the Company shall cease and Acquiror shall continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the Surviving Corporation); (ii) the Articles of Incorporation of Acquiror, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall continue as the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation; (iii) the Bylaws of Acquiror, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall continue as the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation; (iv) the Persons listed on Schedule 1.01 shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation; and (v) the officers of Acquiror immediately prior to the Effective Time shall continue as the officers of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, the Merger will have all the effects provided by applicable law.\n\n1.02. EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of capital stock:\n\n(a) Subject to Sections 1.02(b) and 1.02(e) hereof, each share of Company Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger shall be converted into and shall become that number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Acquiror Common Stock equal to the Common Stock Conversion Number.\n\n(b) Each share of Company Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger and owned directly or indirectly by the Company as treasury stock, by Newco or by any of the Companys or Newcos respective Subsidiaries shall be cancelled, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.\n\n(c) Each share of the capital stock of Acquiror issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger shall remain outstanding.\n\n(d) Common Stock Conversion Number shall mean the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the aggregate number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock into which Company Stock shall be converted (the\n\nI-6\n\nAggregate Shares Delivered) by (ii) the number of shares of Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the Outstanding Company Stock).\n\nFor purposes hereof, the Aggregate Shares Delivered shall equal the quotient obtained by dividing the Aggregate Consideration by $31.00.\n\nFor purposes hereof, the Aggregate Consideration shall be $1,150,000,000.\n\nWithout limiting the provisions of Section 6.04, if, between the date hereof and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Acquiror Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class, by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares, or if any extraordinary dividend or distribution is made with respect to the Acquiror Common Stock, then the Aggregate Shares Delivered shall be correspondingly adjusted to reflect such stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares, extraordinary dividend or distribution or other similar event.\n\n(e) The holder of any shares (Dissenting Shares) of Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Merger that has validly exercised such holders appraisal rights, if any, under the Delaware General Corporation Law (the DGCL) shall not be entitled to receive, in respect of the shares of Company Stock as to which such holder has validly exercised appraisal rights, shares of Acquiror Common Stock unless and until such holder shall have failed to perfect, or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost, such holders right to payment for such holders shares of Company Stock under the DGCL. In such event, such holder shall be entitled to receive the Acquiror Common Stock (in addition to the shares of either Newco Common Stock or Newco Class B Common Stock received pursuant to the Distribution) which such holder would have been entitled to receive had such holder not exercised appraisal rights. The Company shall give Acquiror prompt notice upon receipt by the Company (i) prior to or at the meeting of stockholders at which the Merger, this Agreement and the Company Charter Amendment are voted upon, of any written objection thereto or written demand for appraisal of shares (any stockholder duly making such objection being hereinafter called a Dissenting Stockholder) and (ii) any other notices or communications made after such time by a Dissenting Stockholder which pertains to appraisal rights. The Company agrees that, prior to the Effective Time, except with the written consent of Acquiror, it will not voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demand. Each Dissenting Stockholder who becomes entitled under the DGCL to payment for such holders shares of Company Stock shall receive payment therefor after the Effective Time from the Surviving Corporation.\n\n1.03. EFFECTIVE TIME OF THE MERGER. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, a certificate of merger shall be duly prepared, executed and acknowledged by Acquiror and the Company and thereafter delivered to the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the Certificate of Merger) for filing pursuant to the DGCL on the Closing Date. The Merger shall become effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger with such Secretary of State on the Closing Date (the Effective Time).\n\n1.04. EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES.\n\n(a) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall retain a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to Acquiror to act as exchange agent (the Exchange Agent) in connection with the surrender of certificates evidencing shares of Company Stock converted into shares of Acquiror Common Stock pursuant to the Merger. Prior to the Effective Time, Acquiror shall deposit with the Exchange Agent the shares of Acquiror Common Stock to be issued in the Merger, which shares (collectively, the Merger Stock) shall be deemed to be issued at the Effective Time. At and following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall deliver to the Exchange Agent such cash as may be required, from time to time, to make payments of cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 1.06 hereof.\n\n(b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time evidenced Outstanding Company Stock (collectively, the Certificates), other than the Company, Newco or any of their respective Subsidiaries, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery of the\n\nI-7\n\nCertificates shall be effective, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and which shall be in such form and shall have such other provisions as Acquiror and Newco shall reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates representing the Merger Stock. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal duly executed and such other documents as may be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor certificates representing the shares of Merger Stock that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the terms hereof (together with any dividend or distribution with respect thereto made after the Effective Time to the extent provided in Section 1.05 hereof and any cash paid in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.06), and the Certificate so surrendered shall be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Stock that is not registered in the stock transfer records of the Company, a certificate representing the proper number of shares of Merger Stock may be issued to a transferee if the Certificate representing such Company Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence reasonably satisfactory to Acquiror and Newco that any applicable stock transfer tax has been paid.\n\n(c) After the Effective Time, each outstanding Certificate which theretofore represented shares of Company Stock shall, until surrendered for exchange in accordance with this Section 1.04, be deemed for all purposes to evidence the number of full shares of Merger Stock into which the shares of Company Stock (which, prior to the Effective Time, were represented thereby) shall have been so converted.\n\n(d) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Exchange Agent, in connection with the exchange of shares of Merger Stock for shares of Company Stock. Any Merger Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent that remains unclaimed by the former stockholders of the Company after six months following the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any former stockholders of the Company who have not then complied with the instructions for exchanging their Certificates shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for the exchange of Certificates.\n\n(e) Effective upon the Closing Date, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Stock thereafter on the records of the Company.\n\n(f) All Merger Stock issued upon conversion of shares of Company Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Stock.\n\n1.05. DISTRIBUTION WITH RESPECT TO SHARES REPRESENTED BY UNEXCHANGED CERTIFICATES. No dividend or other distribution declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to the Merger Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Merger Stock issuable upon surrender of a Certificate until the holder of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with Section 1.04. Subject to the effect of applicable law, following surrender of any such Certificate the Surviving Corporation shall pay, without interest, to the record holder of certificates representing shares of Merger Stock issued in exchange therefor (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such shares of Merger Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender of such Certificate and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such shares of Merger Stock. In no event shall the stockholders entitled to receive dividends or distributions be entitled to receive interest thereon. All such dividends or other distributions held by the Exchange Agent for payment or delivery to the holders of unsurrendered Certificates and unclaimed at the end of one year from the Effective Time shall be repaid or redelivered by the Exchange Agent to the Surviving Corporation, after which time any holder of Certificates who has not theretofore surrendered such Certificates to the Exchange Agent, subject to applicable law, shall look as a general creditor only to the Surviving Corporation for payment or delivery of such dividends or distributions, as the case may be.\n\nI-8\n\n1.06. NO FRACTIONAL SHARES.\n\n(a) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Acquiror Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender of Certificates pursuant to Section 1.04, Such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to any rights as a security holder of Acquiror. In lieu of any such fractional shares of Acquiror Common Stock, each holder of Outstanding Company Stock entitled to receive shares of Acquiror Common Stock in the Merger, upon surrender of a Certificate for exchange pursuant to Section 1.04, shall be entitled to receive an amount in cash (without interest), rounded to the nearest cent, determined by multiplying the fractional interest in Acquiror Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled (after taking into account all shares of Company Stock then held of record by such holder) by the closing sale price of a share of Acquiror Common Stock as reported on the NASDAQ or the NYSE, as the case may be, on the Closing Date.\n\n(b) As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of Company Stock in lieu of any fractional share interests, Acquiror shall promptly deposit with the Exchange Agent cash in the required amounts and the Exchange Agent will mail such amounts, without interest, to such holders; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no such amount will be paid to any holder of Certificates prior to the surrender by such holder of the Certificates which formerly represented such holders Company Stock. Any such amounts that remain unclaimed by the former stockholders of the Company after six months following the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation by the Exchange Agent, upon demand, and any former stockholders of the Company who have not then surrendered their Certificates shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment in lieu of any fractional interests.\n\n1.07. NO LIABILITY. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares on the day immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any governmental entity shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation (or Newco in the case of Newco Common Stock or Newco Class B Common Stock and dividends or distributions with respect thereto) free and clear of any claims or interest of any holder previously entitled thereto. None of the Surviving Corporation, Newco or the Exchange Agent will be liable to any holder of shares of Company Stock for any shares of Merger Stock or any Newco Common Stock or Newco Class B Common Stock, dividends or distributions with respect thereto or cash payable in lieu of fractional shares delivered to a state abandoned property administrator or other public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.\n\n1.08. LOST CERTIFICATES. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares of Merger Stock (and any dividend or distribution with respect thereto made after the Effective Time and prior to such issuance and any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.06) deliverable in respect thereof as determined in accordance with the terms hereof. When authorizing such payment in exchange for any lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the person to whom the Merger Stock is to be issued, as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, shall give the Surviving Corporation a bond satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation against any claim that may be made against the Surviving Corporation with respect to the Certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.\n\nARTICLE II\n\nCERTAIN PRE-MERGER TRANSACTIONS\n\nThe following transactions shall occur prior to the Effective Time:\n\n2.01. AMENDMENTS TO CHARTERS; FINANCING.\n\n(a) Prior to the Contribution, the Distribution and the Effective Time, the Company shall amend its Certificate of Incorporation substantially as set forth in Exhibit A hereto (the Company Charter Amendment) and Newco shall amend and restate its Certificate of Incorporation substantially as set forth in Exhibit B hereto (the Newco Charter Amendment).\n\nI-9\n\n(b) Prior to the Contribution, the Distribution and the Effective Time, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain financing in the amount of $700,000,000 on terms reasonably and mutually acceptable to the Company and Acquiror, which may be secured by the cash proceeds thereof, the Broadcasting Assets or the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of PBC and/or the Broadcasting Subsidiaries (the New Company Debt). Out of the proceeds of the New Company Debt, the Company, on or before the Closing Date, shall pay or provide for the Existing Company Debt and the Deal Expenses, and the balance of the proceeds of the New Company Debt, along with any other remaining cash and cash equivalents then owned by the Company, shall be contributed by the Company to Newco pursuant to the Contribution and Assumption Agreement to be entered into by the Company and Newco in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit C (the Contribution Agreement). The Acquiror shall assist the Company in any manner reasonably requested by the Company in connection with obtaining the New Company Debt.

For the purposes hereof, the term Employee Plan means any plan, program, contract or arrangement, whether oral or written, which (i) is an employee benefit plan, as such term is defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, whether or not subject to ERISA, or (ii) is an incentive, bonus, stock option, stock purchase, phantom stock, severance, fringe benefit or other compensatory plan, contract, or arrangement that is not an employee benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA. No Broadcasting Employee Plan is a multiemployer plan within the meaning of Sections 3(37) and 4001(a)(3) of ERISA.\n\n(b) The Company has delivered or made available to Acquiror true and complete copies of the plan documents, contracts, policy statements and summary plan descriptions that currently apply to the operation or funding of each Broadcasting Employee Plan.

A favorable IRS determination letter is currently in effect with respect to each funded Broadcasting Pension Plan, and no subsequent amendments have been or will be adopted or other action taken which would adversely affect the qualified status of any such Broadcasting Pension Plan.\n\nI-18\n\n(d) With respect to each funded employee pension plan (within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA) maintained by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their ERISA Affiliates within six years prior to the date hereof for the benefit of any of its employees (other than a multiemployer plan within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA), where applicable, (i) there has been no termination or partial termination within the meaning of Section 411(d)(3) of the Code, except to the extent that the Transactions will result in such a partial termination; (ii) there has been no accumulated funding deficiency, whether or not waived, within the meaning of Section 302(a)(2) of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, and there has been no failure to make a required installment by its due date under Section 412(m) of the Code; (iii) no non-exempt prohibited transaction (within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) has occurred which could result in the imposition of a material tax or liability against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; and (iv) with respect to each such plan which is covered by Title IV of ERISA, (A) no reportable event within the meaning of Section 4043(c) of ERISA has occurred, except a reportable event occurring as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any prior event which will not result in a liability to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates after the consummation of said transactions; (B) no notice of intent to terminate the plan has been provided to participants or filed with PBGC under Section 4041 of ERISA, nor has PBGC instituted or threatened to institute any proceeding under Section 4042 of ERISA to terminate the plan; and (C) no liability has been incurred under Title IV of ERISA to PBGC or otherwise (except for the payment of PBGC premiums) which has not been satisfied. Neither the Company, any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their ERISA Affiliates has ceased operations at a facility so as to become subject to the provisions of Section 4068(f) of ERISA, withdrawn as a substantial employer so as to become subject to the provisions of Section 4063 of ERISA or ceased making contributions on or before the Closing Date to any such plan which is a pension plan subject to Section 4064(a) of ERISA.\n\n(e) Neither the Company, any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their ERISA Affiliates has incurred or expects to incur any withdrawal liability under Title IV of ERISA (either as a contributing employer or as part of a controlled group which includes a contributing employer) in connection with a complete or partial withdrawal from a Multiemployer Plan that will be unsatisfied at the Effective Time; and, with respect to any Multiemployer Plan to which the Company or any ERISA Affiliate is, or within the preceding six years, was required to make or accrue a contribution, neither the Company, any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their ERISA Affiliates has received notice from such Multiemployer Plan that the plan is in reorganization or insolvency pursuant to Sections 4241 or 4245 or ERISA or that the plan is intended to terminate or has terminated under Sections 4041A or 4042 of ERISA.\n\n(f) The Company, its Subsidiaries and each of their ERISA Affiliates has complied in all material respects with its obligations under the provisions of Section 4980B of the Code with respect to any group health plan. Except as identified on Schedule 4.10(a), no Broadcasting Employee Plan provides health or death benefits (whether or not insured) to Broadcasting Employees beyond the termination of their employment or other services.\n\n(g) All Broadcasting Employee Plans which provide medical, dental health or long-term disability benefits are insured and, to the Companys knowledge, claims with respect to any participant or covered dependent under any such Broadcasting Employee Plan will not result in any uninsured liability to the Acquiror, the Company, PBC or any of their Subsidiaries.\n\n4.11. LABOR MATTERS.\n\n(a) Except as set forth on Schedule 4.11(a), neither PBC nor any Broadcasting Subsidiary is a party to any labor or collective bargaining agreement and there are no labor or collective bargaining agreements which pertain to any Broadcasting employees.\n\n(b) Except as set forth on Schedule 4.11(b), as of the date of this Agreement, (i) no employees of PBC or any of the Broadcasting Subsidiaries are represented by any labor organization and (ii) no labor organization or group of employees of PBC or any of the Broadcasting Subsidiaries has made a pending demand for recognition\n\nI-19\n\nor certification, and there are no representation or certification proceedings or petitions seeking a representation proceeding presently pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened to be brought or filed with the NLRB or any other labor relations tribunal or authority.

COMPLAINTS. As of the date of this Agreement, there is not, to the knowledge of the Company, any FCC investigation, notice of apparent liability or order of forfeiture pending or outstanding against any of the Stations respecting any violation, or allegation thereof, of any FCC rule, regulation or policy, or, to the knowledge of the Company, any complaint before the FCC as a result of which an investigation, notice of apparent liability, or order of forfeiture may issue from the FCC relating to any of the Stations.\n\n4.14. REPORTS. Excluding reports and statements which do not materially affect the business and operations of any of the Stations, all reports and statements currently required to be filed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with the FCC or with any other governmental agency with respect to the Stations have been filed and substantially complied with and shall continue to be filed and be in substantial compliance on a current basis until the Closing Date.

Acquiror has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted, except where the failure to have such power or authority would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Acquiror and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Acquiror has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and, subject to the items referred to in Sections 5.02 and 5.03, to consummate the Transactions. Subject to the items referred to in Sections 5.02 and 5.03, all necessary action, corporate or otherwise, required to have been taken by or on behalf of Acquiror by applicable law, its charter documents or otherwise to authorize (i) the approval, execution and delivery on its behalf of this Agreement and (ii) its performance of its obligations under this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions has been taken, except that this Agreement must\n\nI-20\n\nbe approved by the stockholders of Acquiror, and the Board of Directors of Acquiror must increase the size of such Board to comply with the Board Representation Agreement. Assuming that this Agreement and each Transaction Agreement constitutes or will constitute, as the case may be, a legal, valid and binding agreement of the Company or Newco, as the case may be, this Agreement and each other Transaction Agreement to which Acquiror is or will be a party constitutes or will constitute, as the case may be, a valid and binding agreement of Acquiror, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, subject to (i) the Enforceability Exceptions and (ii) in the case of the Board Representation Agreement to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the Communications Act), and the rules and regulations thereunder (the Rules and Regulations) regarding cross-ownership of radio and television stations, to the extent that such Rules and Regulations may prohibit Newco or any of its officers, directors or shareholders from designating or acting as a director or observer on Acquirors Board of Directors. Acquiror has heretofore made available to the Company true and complete copies of its Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws as in effect on the date hereof.\n\n5.02. NO BREACH.
