He will voice the Suns alongside analyst Tim Kempton, who will enter his 22nd season on the job.\n\nSuns games will air on the Arizona Sports app, 98.7, ESPN 620 AM and ArizonaSports.com.\n\nThe team also announced a television broadcast schedule that will include 70 games on Arizona’s Family and live streaming on Kiswe.

His honors include the Curt Gowdy Media Award (2007), the Arizona Sports Hall of Fame (2009), the Iowa Hall of Pride (2015) and the Suns’ Ring of Honor (2017).\n\nMcCoy’s final call came May 11 in Phoenix’s elimination loss at home against the Denver Nuggets in Game 6 of the Western Conference semifinals.\n\nHow to listen to Suns games on the radio\n\nGames will air on the Arizona Sports app, 98.7 and ArizonaSports.com.\n\nHow to watch Suns games on TV, streaming\n\nVisit the Phoenix Suns website to find channels for Arizona’s Family and learn how to stream games via the Kiswe app."
