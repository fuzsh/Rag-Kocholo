Turn! Turn! Promotes a Do-It-Yourself esthetic. We ask that performers build their own bills, do their own promotion, set the price for the event and figure out their money split. We believe this approach helps promote a music-community mindset, rather than a venue/performer divide.\n\nIn practice, details are often worked out day-of the event, so we often don’t know ahead of time how much the cover charge will be. Performers set the price for their shows and this is often determined after they all arrive at the venue. We encourage a sliding scale, $5~20, and this is generally what you should expect to pay.\n\nHow much do the bands make at Turn!?\n\nPerformers take home 100% of the door money after the door person is paid. The more you give at the door, the more the bands get! The bar takes $0.00 from the door.\n\nCan I pay with a credit card/phone/subdermal micro-chip?\n\nAdmissions to the event is CASH ONLY. This makes it easy for us to pass the money directly to the performers at the end of the event. There are ATMs within walking distance of the venue.\n\nWhat about my beer and nachos?\n\nThe bar accepts all payment types for food and drink. This is how the venue covers ALL of its operating expenses. The more regularly you eat and drink at Turn!, the more likely we will still be here doing this for you next year!\n\nWith love and gratitude, we hope this FAQ has been illuminating.\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nXO!T3"
