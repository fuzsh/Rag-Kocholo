Maurer, who has been with the station since 2012, moves up from the role of Editor to Assistant Program Director and News Director.\n\n\"There is no one more passionate about KTAR News and its talented content teams than Martha,\" added Hatch. \"We have watched her grow and achieve great success for 11 years and couldn't be more excited for her to lead this legendary brand into the future.\"\n\n\"It is an honor to continue supporting the mission of Bonneville Phoenix and the heritage brand that is KTAR News,\" said Maurer. \"I'm thrilled for this new opportunity to work with the best team in broadcasting and grow our news and talk content across multiple distribution channels.\""
