Main Majboor Tha\n\nThis story began one evening in the early 1980s. This was a time when my Hindi film experiences were largely restricted to the Sunday evening fare doled out by Doordarshan. I was just shy of ten years and my taste in movies was dictated by a man called Amitabh Bachchan, and in his absence, I had learned to spot the word ‘Action’ (or ‘Thrills’) in the credits. If that existed, then one could look forward to some fisticuffs at the end of three hours of songs and tears—a big incentive for a young boy. That evening, my mother (the certified movie buff in the family) and I took our positions in front of our black-and-white television set for our weekly Hindi movie fix. My father seldom watched the Sunday film, often preferring to go for a walk instead, but that day he was in the room as well. To my delight, the film —Majboor—starred Amitabh Bachchan, which sealed the deal for me. My father, on the other hand, shuffled in his seat and wondered aloud if the film would be worth it. A minute or two into the credits, he got excited and exclaimed, ‘Arre Salim–Javed, taholey toh dekhtei hobey!’ (‘A Salim–Javed film, have to watch it then!’) Apparently, these two gentlemen—Salim–Javed, as I learned then, was not one person, but a team of two—had written the story of the film and also the lines my hero would say. After the film ended, I thought about this and was quite intrigued that there could be other highlights in a film apart from the actors and the fight director. My father remembered a film called Deewaar, which was written by Salim– Javed, and he said it was one of the best that he had watched. I asked him if it had fights and my father mentioned there was just one. I made a mental note to watch Deewaar one day but with just one fight, it was not a top priority. Over the next couple of years, I started noticing this name—Salim–Javed— and was quite delighted to find that they had written many of my favourite films.\n\nSeeta Aur Geeta was their doing, as was Yaadon Ki Baaraat. Don had their name too, as did Haathi Mere Saathi. And wonder of wonders, my all-time favourite—Sholay—was also written by them. Long before I understood what film writing is all about or the difference between the screenplay and the story, I had added Salim–Javed to the list of names to watch out for in a film’s credits. As I read more about writing for the screen, I correlated much of that to the films of Salim–Javed. Satyajit Ray, film writer par excellence, talked about the importance of detailing events, locations and characters in a script. He talked about real dialogues. He talked about backstories of characters, even if they were not shown in the film. Salim–Javed followed many of those principles, without being conscious of them. Watching Salim–Javed’s classic films—Deewaar, Trishul, Kaala Patthar, Shakti—when I grew older, I realized how good they really were. When I met Salim sahib for an interview, he said, ‘One hit film, two hit films, even three hit films in a row can be a fluke. But ten or eleven hits1 in a row cannot be a fluke. If a stuntman leaps off a seven-storeyed building and lands on his feet, people would call it a miracle. Second time can also be called a miracle. But if he keeps doing it again and again, you’ll have to admit he has a technique.’ But almost in the same breath, he also said that as writers they had no conscious technique. They were not trying to make any social commentary with Deewaar and they were not inspired so much by Akira Kurosawa as by Sergio Leone. That gave me the idea of writing their story in the signature Salim–Javed style —a lot of interesting events that built to a crescendo, a bit of context to make sense, but not much of analysis. I believe they brought a certain swagger to the profession of writing, long— probably still—considered to be a back-room job. There were more prolific writers, writers who had given a greater number of hits. But none of them had succeeded in changing the dynamics of an industry, notorious for being set in its ways. None of them raised their collars and advertised their success the way Salim–Javed did. They struck me as two extremely humble men personally, who were extremely proud professionally. Strangely, there aren’t too many books on Hindi film writing. Books on Javed Akhtar and Gulzar largely focus on their careers as lyricists (and in Gulzar’s\n\nAkhtar and Gulzar largely focus on their careers as lyricists (and in Gulzar’s case, as a director). Actors, actresses, directors, music directors, lyricists have all got excellent biographies but not the people without whom the industry would have been just a blank sheet of paper. Here, then, is the story of two heroes. A story of a friendship that became a bitter rivalry and finally mellowed down to a cordial relationship. And of the philosophy with which they approached their work. In the process Salim Khan and Javed Akhtar ended up creating two film families that are doing many of the things that they were not able to do themselves. In a way, my father—who was not a Bollywood fan at all—started this story, and also laid down the benchmark of a good film dialogue. He remembered only one, and when a non-fan remembers something, it is likely to be bloody good. For as long as he lived, any discussion on film dialogues with him began and ended with just one line: ‘Main aaj bhi phenke hue paise nahin uthata . . .’ i It is not for nothing Deewaar is called the Perfect Hindi Film Screenplay.\n\nPrologue: The Tale of Two Zanjeers\n\n‘Whether it’s Zanjeer, Sholay or Seeta Aur Geeta, the fact that they keep coming back to old scripts proves there’s a scarcity of writing. So I am of the opinion that the original writers should be monetarily compensated’— Salim Khan ‘Salim sahib’s and my contract was with Prakash Mehra Productions (PMP) for our script to be made only in Hindi. The south Indian rights for Zanjeer were with us . . . The superhit Hindi films that are made into Telugu get up to Rs 3 crore. So we feel we also deserve a compensation of Rs 3 crore for the Zanjeer remake rights which we hold and have papers to prove it’— Javed Akhtar\n\nW hen the remake of Zanjeer was chosen as Telugu superstar Ram Charan Teja’s Hindi film debut, there was considerable curiosity tempered with a fair bit of dismay. Curiosity because this was the film from which Amitabh Bachchan’s ascendance to superstardom began. And dismay because every remake in Hindi cinema till now had been very disappointing. Apart from Ram Charan, the film also marked the debut of Prakash Mehra’s son Amit as producer. He ‘bought’ the rights to the remake Zanjeer from his brothers for Rs 4 crore. When the film was announced in 2012, Salim–Javed contacted Amit Mehra about the monetary compensation they were entitled to as writers of the original. They informed him that the rights resided with them and were not for his family to sell. Initially, they wanted an amicable, out-of-court settlement, and by all reports their demand was not high. Apparently, Amit Mehra tried the schmoozing for which ‘old-school’ Bollywood was famous. He sweet-talked Javed Akhtar, addressing him as ‘uncle’ and went to his home with dry fruits. (We are not sure if peanuts were part of his gift!) After this, he chose to ignore their calls and sent them a legal letter stating the remake rights were with him.\n\ntheir calls and sent them a legal letter stating the remake rights were with him. Salim–Javed were extremely hurt, and they responded by complaining to the Film Writers’ Association (FWA) with documents supporting their claim of rights. This was when they firmed their demand of Rs 3 crore for the Telugu remake rights of Zanjeer and added another Rs 3 crore for the Hindi remake rights as well. They argued that the original script was sold to Prakash Mehra Productions for a film starring Amitabh Bachchan, Jaya Bhaduri and Pran. Since the cast had changed, the film was obviously a different one using out of the same script, and the writers ought to be paid for that too. At this point, they refused an out-of-court settlement (which the producers of the new Zanjeer offered) because they wanted to set a precedent with the case. The disputes settlement committee of the Federation of Western India Cine Employees (FWICE) examined the documents presented by both parties and observed that Salim–Javed were indeed the rightful owners of the script, but since the committee did not have the authority to direct a legal settlement, the case went to the courts. Salim–Javed filed to stay the film’s release until they were paid for the rights. After hearing the arguments, the Bombay High Court, however, did not stay the release on the grounds that Salim–Javed delayed issuing the legal notice and that their actual objective was not to bring a stay, but to be adequately compensated for their work. While reserving judgement on the actual ownership of the rights, the court directed the two parties to arrive at an amicable out-ofcourt settlement. The lawyers for both the parties requested the matter to be taken in chamber, so the settlement amount would not be divulged to the public. Insiders believe that the amount was reasonably close to what the duo had asked for originally. Even taking a conservative view, one can safely say that it made Salim–Javed the highest paid writers of Bollywood in 2013 as well. For the two writers, this is typical of their relationship post their split. While they have been cordial when referring to each other, they have remained distant and are almost never seen together at public events. But whenever their rights have been threatened, they have put up a united front. This also completes a circle that started in the late 1960s, when the duo first came together, writing brilliant scripts and asking for commensurate compensation. For them, credit was as important as—if not more than—the\n\nmoney. Their desire to be known as the writers of a film is probably best described by a story connected to the original Zanjeer. After a lot of back-and-forth between heroes and producers, Zanjeer was eventually sold to Prakash Mehra for Rs 55,000. The sale was on the condition that Salim–Javed would be duly credited in all publicity material of the film. This was of paramount importance to the two, because they had already worked on scripts for three hit films before this and had received little or no credit for them. As the release date neared, Salim–Javed eagerly waited to see their names on a billboard for the first time but when the posters went up they were heartbroken. Prakash Mehra—caught up in the rigmarole of his first production—had forgotten all about his promise. What happened after this is indicative of the confidence and chutzpah that differentiated Salim–Javed from their peers. Sometimes, this was as important as their talent in establishing them as the only superstar writers of the Hindi film industry. When they reminded Prakash Mehra of the deal, he was apologetic but helpless. The posters were already up and there was nothing he could do at that stage. He promised to rectify the oversight in the subsequent rounds of postering. With anybody else, the matter would have ended here but these two writers were on a different kind of mission. Salim–Javed hired a poster painter. They gave him a stencil that said ‘Written by Salim–Javed’, and instructed him to paint it on all the posters of Zanjeer that he could find. The painter may have been drunk or in a hurry to complete this mammoth task; what he ended up doing was print the line pretty much anywhere on the poster instead of at the bottom, where credits usually appeared. On the morning of the release, Bombay woke up to find all posters of Zanjeer—from Juhu to Opera House—stamped with the name ‘Salim–Javed’. Be it Amitabh’s nose, Pran’s beard, or Jaya’s face, Salim–Javed was, quite literally, unmissable on the posters of Zanjeer. Both Salim Khan and Javed Akhtar appear a little embarrassed when they recount this incident now. Embarrassed, but not apologetic. Their logic and raison d’être for being here was very clear, and it was not to be anonymous back-room boys. Their work did not end with writing a story. They\n\nrecommended actors, negotiated distribution deals, participated in the publicity, and even advertised themselves. They had come for the money and the fame. And if they did not get it, they were willing to fight for it. What happened with the poster of the original Zanjeer repeated with the contract of the new one. The producers—two generations of them—had hoped to get away from honouring their commitments by sweet-talking the writers. After all, writers were creative types who could be cajoled with some persuasion. But Salim Khan and Javed Akhtar were a different breed altogether. Their writing talent was matched by their business acumen, their showmanship and their demand for fair credit. Many things have changed in the forty years since they got together—and then went their separate way—but their belief that content is king is not among them. This is their story.\n\nPart I:\n\nFLASHBACK\n\nSalim Khan: A Man on a Filmi Mission\n\n‘I had the art of conception but not the art of projection’ —Salim Khan\n\nOne of Salim Khan’s abiding memories is from when he was four or five years old and had stolen a key-wound motorcycle from a toy cart. When he came home with it and his mother found out, she was livid and made him go back to the cart-owner to return the toy and apologize. When he did so, all his friends laughed. Many decades later, Salim Khan says he still hasn’t forgotten the cackle of their laughter. Nor has he forgotten the lessons an upright mother can impart on a child. This theme of honesty above all else would return to many of the films he wrote. Born on 24 November 1935 in Indore, Salim Khan was the son of a police officer—fifth in a line of Pathans who had migrated from Afghanistan in search of a good education and a better life for their children. His great-greatgrandfather Anwar Khan joined the British cavalry and was posted in the Central Provinces (present-day Madhya Pradesh). The family put a premium on education and culture, which led to most of its members joining government service. Salim Khan’s father—Abdul Rashid Khan—joined the police force and rose to become the DIG of Indore, the highest position allowed to Indians in British India. As member of a well-to-do family, Salim’s life was quite comfortable until he lost his mother at the age of nine. She was suffering from tuberculosis, a dreaded disease during that time, and Salim was not allowed to go near her for the last four years of her life. She was in isolation at home and had to go away for long periods to Bhowali, a sanatorium for TB patients. He recalls one particularly traumatic episode, ‘One day, she saw me playing and asked the maid who I was because she couldn’t recognize me after staying away for so long. When the maid told her that I was her youngest son, Gullu, she called me but did not let me come near her. She made me stand at a distance from her and watched me for quite some time.\n\nmade me stand at a distance from her and watched me for quite some time. When I think about this now, I always think how traumatic it must have been for her to not be able to touch her own son. And even now, tears well up in my eyes.’ After his mother’s death, Salim grew closer to his father, but he too passed away five years later. ‘I was only fourteen,’ recalls Salim. ‘He passed away in January and I took my matriculation examination in March. As a child, I had a very good life. I had a car, a tonga to ferry me around, and all material comfort but I never got the love of parents.’ He had the idyllic upbringing typical of a small town, growing up with a large group of friends and an extended family. His favourite pastimes were sports and reading. And movies. He discovered the magic of movies fairly early in his life, even though movie watching wasn’t as common or easy as it is now. There were just three cinema halls in Indore that used to show English films (and another one in the nearby town of Mau), all of which he patronized. A regular at the Saturday matinee shows, his staple fare was, not surprisingly, the action—more specifically, sword-fighting—films made famous by Nadia. He remembers Hunterwali, and the several clones it spawned, as fondly as he does Bhagwan Dada, the charismatic comic star. This habit of watching movies carried on well into his teens and even after he left Indore. One of the movies he remembers watching as a teenager was Garden of Evil—a Western where two protagonists draw cards to decide who will stay to hold back the advancing Indians. Blessed with a good memory, he still remembers many details from his childhood, even the name of the barber who used to come home to give his father, him, and all his cousins haircuts at a bulk rate—Hariram Naii. Salim’s father—having been a police officer all over Madhya Pradesh—had extensive experience in handling dacoits of the region and had compelling stories to tell. Many of the more interesting ones stuck. There was a particularly cruel story about a legendary dacoit who cut off the ears and noses of all the policemen he caught. His name was Gabbar Singh. Salim studied at Indore’s St Raphael’s School and then at Holkar College. He was quite the ‘jock’ in college with a 1928 model Jaguar and a Triumph motorcycle that he rode around town. He also played cricket. As the star batsman of the college team, he was extremely popular and his skills were good enough for the college to request him to enrol for an MA in economics in order\n\nenough for the college to request him to enrol for an MA in economics in order to keep playing. He practised hard but when he realized he was not able to progress beyond a certain level he got bored of the stagnation. He tried several other things too. His penchant for war movies led to a fascination for flying and he started training to become a pilot. He even logged the hours required to get a commercial flying license but got bored of that too. Commercial flying is bound by strict rules and regulations, with no scope for showmanship. His dreams of swooping down and zooming back up over a girl’s house weren’t going to materialize ever, he realized. But a culture of reading and learning at home ensured that adrenalin-charged activities weren’t the only things that interested him. His father insisted that he read books and newspapers regularly, and subscribed to the Statesman newspaper from Calcutta (which took three days to arrive). Salim Khan always had an air of flamboyance about him and a flair for words. In college, he became the ‘official’ letter writer for all the lover boys in his class, letters that were handed over surreptitiously on the way to college or in a cinema queue. He’s quite proud of his letters and says that when he left for Bombay, the quality of his friends’ letters dropped so much that their girlfriends went ahead and married other people. ‘Sab ke sab Devdas ho gaye,’ he laughs. Incidentally, two of his close friends were called Jai Singh Rao Kalevar and Virender Singh Bias (names which he would soon immortalize). He also had a doomed love affair when he was in college. ‘Boys and girls used to fall in love in college, but the girl’s family would marry them off to older boys, who were already working and somewhat settled in life. The same thing happened to me,’ he says with detachment. His good looks and the gift of the gab often led to friendly banter about him being ‘hero material’. That banter turned out to be prophetic for he got an offer from Ramesh Saigal—maker of hits like Samadhi and Shaheed—to act in films, but he turned it down. The Barjatyas—who would eventually provide a brilliant launch vehicle for Salman Khan—were the ones responsible for Salim Khan’s foray into cinema. It was at the wedding of Tarachand Barjatya’s son that film director K. Amarnath spotted him and offered him an acting job in Bombay. He offered him Rs 1000 to move to Bombay and a salary while working in his films. The film industry\n\nwas not a respectable profession then but Salim Khan was a big movie buff and fast getting bored with his life in Indore. He was in the second year of his MA course and had had enough of imitating stars to entertain his friends. When this opportunity presented himself, he jumped at it. ‘Dilip Kumar ki dukan band karwa denge . . .’ he told everyone with his customary confidence. When he was about to leave, his elder brother painted a doomsday picture by saying that Salim would either return very soon or would keep asking for money. Salim Khan vowed that he would do neither. One of his first films was K. Amarnath’s Baraat (1960), for which he was hired at a salary of Rs 400 per month. Soon, he got into the Bombay grind of acting in not-so-significant roles in different kinds of films and soliciting work for more of the same. Probably his most well-noticed role (in hindsight) was the one he played in Vijay Anand’s Teesri Manzil (a tightly woven murder mystery written and produced by Nasir Husain). He had a role slightly bigger than the hero’s friend in the film where he is co-opted by Shammi Kapoor to impersonate him as Rocky the drummer. His entry scene in the film got a very good build-up and his dashing looks and impressive physique meant he could pass off as a hero. Almost. He played a bit part in yet another Shammi Kapoor starrer, Professor, but his bread-and-butter roles seemed to be the swashbuckling, sword-fighting, costume dramas that he had loved during his childhood. Except, audience tastes had changed since and these films were now categorized as B-grade fare. Kabli Khan (starring Ajit in the title role), Darasingh (starring, well, Dara Singh in the title role), Raaka (also starring Dara Singh), Chhaila Babu (starring Bhagwan Dada) were some of the quickly shot, quickly forgotten films he acted in. He remembers acting in about twenty-five films though many of them were never released. He spent about eight years in Bombay struggling to become a hero. By the end of it, conventional employment options were closed for him because he was too old to be eligible for competitive exams for the police, administrative or banking services. However, he did not want to go back to Indore because— thanks to his grand pronouncements before leaving—he was sure he would become the laughing stock of the small town. A little after he came to Bombay, he met Sushila Charak, a Dogra Rajput girl,\n\nA little after he came to Bombay, he met Sushila Charak, a Dogra Rajput girl, who, along with her family, happened to stay in Mahim, the same neighbourhood as Salim. Quite well known in the locality for his good looks and wit, he was often seen holding court at street corners. He caught Sushila’s eye then but the first time he spoke to her was when they bumped into each other near Churchgate station and she directed him to an address he was looking for. Their courtship started soon after this meeting and continued for nearly five years during which she refused several marriage alliances brought by her family. Eventually, they got married in 1964, and she changed her name to Salma. Her father, Baldev Singh Charak, was livid with her for marrying a Muslim and that too a film actor, a profession considered quite taboo among the middle classes at the time. About a year after their marriage, Salma and Salim had their first child in December 1965—a son, whom they named Abdul Rashid Salim Salman Khan. Her family cut off all relations with her and maintained no contact till after their third son, Sohail, was born and Salim Khan had built a reputation in the industry. But before fame found him, Salim Khan’s prospects were bleak. His struggles as an actor were becoming increasingly difficult and he was compelled to evaluate other options in the film industry. He zeroed in on writing, having seen Nasir Husain write scripts for his own films—and talk about their importance— when he was acting in Teesri Manzil. Salim had participated in the writing process and understood the value of the script in the making of a film. This realization played a major part in his becoming a screenwriter. He says that he figured out that while he knew only a little about writing, most other people knew even less, which gave him a fair shot at success. He started writing a few outlines—some of them based on stories he had heard from his police officer father—and tried peddling them to stars and producers. One of the big advantages he had compared to others in the film industry of the 1960s was that he was extremely well read and was an avid reader, even when he was busy acting. His favourite haunt was the Victoria Circulating Library in Mahim. In fact, he laughs when he remembers what the owner started saying after a few years, ‘I don’t have any new books for you. You have read everything here!’ Even when Salim bought something that was wrapped in a newspaper, he remembers reading that piece of paper before throwing it away. His reading habit, along with his academic background, gave him a gravitas that was respected by industry bigwigs like Raj Kapoor and Dilip Kumar and it\n\nthat was respected by industry bigwigs like Raj Kapoor and Dilip Kumar and it proved helpful in building an equation with them. Another star he was quite familiar with was Ashok Kumar. He even wrote a script and directly offered it to the actor. In his characteristic fashion, he says, ‘I told Dadamoni to listen for just fifteen minutes. “After that you’ll tell me to continue.”’ Ashok Kumar heard the whole script and liked it. Salim was with Dadamoni when producer Brij Sadanah came to sign him for a project and he seized the opportunity to peddle the script to Sadanah as well. Ashok Kumar also endorsed it. At the time, it was common for Hindi film producers to sign on stars without any story or script to base their offer on. The prevalent belief was that they would write something to suit the star. The script was eventually made into a film called Do Bhai, starring Ashok Kumar, Jeetendra and Mala Sinha, which was released in 1969. The story had elements of the popular Salim–Javed formula—an estranged child, an anti-hero, moral dilemmas, and several twists and turns. The film, unfortunately, did not do too well. Salim had decided to cut down on his acting assignments in order to concentrate on writing and though money was hard to come by, he had not lost his flamboyance. In Do Bhai, he was credited as Prince Salim. During this period, he joined Abrar Alvi as a writing assistant. The recommendation was made by actor Ajit, who had worked with Salim in several films and also knew Abrar Alvi quite well. All three of them were working on the Shammi Kapoor-starrer, Professor, when this connection happened. As an assistant, Salim spent three-four hours after lunch with the veteran writer. His salary was Rs 500 per month and for that, he would suggest plot ideas, how certain scenes or events would unfold and also be the sounding board for dialogues. He says that he used to suggest ideas he had read in popular novels or seen in Hollywood films. Once during this stint, he had a very interesting conversation with Abrar Alvi when they were discussing the importance of the writer in films. Salim said, ‘Abrar sahib, there will come a time when writers will be paid the same as stars . . .’ Abrar took a while to comprehend this and asked somewhat incredulously, ‘If Dilip Kumar charges twelve lakh for a film today, you think a writer can ever ask for that kind of money?’ Salim replied, ‘If the writer can prove that the film ran because of his script,\n\nSalim replied, ‘If the writer can prove that the film ran because of his script, then why not?’ Abrar dismissed this confidence as lunacy and said, ‘Miyan, don’t repeat this to anyone else. People will think you have gone mad.’ Salim Khan still remembers this conversation as if it happened yesterday. In the mid-1960s, around the time Salim decided to turn to screenwriting, he was also acting in a film called Sarhadi Lootera directed by S.M. Sagar. He was not the hero but had a romantic role in the action film. Those were the days when scenes were written on the sets by anonymous daily-wage writers, who never seemed to be in short supply. Salim, by this time, had started thinking of scripts and scenes as a writer and used to complain bitterly to the director about the poor quality of dialogues. He even offered to write the scenes himself. The director kept scouting for writers until one day, in desperation, he asked one of his assistants—the clapper boy—to write the day’s scenes because the writer hadn’t turned up. He liked the boy’s work so much that he made him the dialogue writer. The boy was about twenty-one years old. His name was Javed Akhtar.\n\nEnter Javed Akhtar\n\nWhen Javed Akhtar was born, his father—poet Jan Nisar Akhtar—a member of the Communist Party, went to the hospital along with some friends directly from the office. Since he was carrying a copy of The Communist Manifesto, he decided to change the tradition of reading the Azaan in the newborn child’s ears and read from the manifesto instead. This reading was not merely symbolic. Javed’s childhood and the atmosphere around him were such that he came to believe deeply in communism and hated the inequalities entrenched in Indian society. And this belief was evident in many of the films he would eventually write. Born on 17 January 1945 in Gwalior, he got his name from a line his father wrote the day he got married to Safia: ‘Lamha lamha kisi jadoo ka fasana hoga . . .’ Jan Nisar Akhtar borrowed a word from it to name his son Jadoo. For a long time, he remained Jadoo and it was only when he was about to be admitted to school that his name was changed to a more formal but similar-sounding Javed. Jan Nisar Akhtar came from a family of scholars and writers. He was an accomplished poet and he went on to become an acclaimed lyricist for Hindi films as well. His wife, Safia Akhtar, was also very well educated, and taught in a college. She had a keen appreciation of literature and poetry. Since she and her husband spent most of their married life away from each other (due to his status as a ‘Wanted’ member of the Communist Party), she regularly wrote letters to him. These letters were subsequently published as a collection called Zer-e-Lab (Under the Lip), which became very popular; that alone was enough for Safia to make a place for herself in the world of Urdu literature. Javed was extremely close to his mother and she, in turn, had assessed her firstborn’s talents very accurately. In a letter to her husband, she described the six-and-a-half-year-old Javed: ‘This boy has tremendous control and command over Urdu and is rather hesitant in English. He is extremely talkative but not very practical.’ Javed now adds that, ‘She described me as someone who makes big plans but doesn’t do anything about them. I’m much the same even today.’\n\nbig plans but doesn’t do anything about them. I’m much the same even today.’ When asked about his childhood memories, Javed quotes Woody Allen. The American actor–director, when asked, ‘Did you have a happy childhood?’ had replied ‘No, a normal one.’ Javed says the same thing because he managed to get through his childhood with a wealth of memories and influences despite some traumatic experiences. Javed lost his mother exactly one day after his eighth birthday. He remembers vividly the moment when his aunt took him and his younger brother Salman close to their mother’s body for a last glimpse and asked them both to promise Safia that they ‘would do something in life, become something in life’. When Javed went through a terrible phase of struggle during his early days in Bombay, this promise was always at the back of his mind. Jan Nisar Akhtar had already moved to the city at this time as he had to go underground became of his links to the Communist Party. Javed Akhtar says, ‘It can be shocking for a child of that age to lose both parents—one to life and another to death.’ For a long time in his childhood, Javed dreamed of a white shroud—similar to the one his mother’s body was wrapped in after her death— which traumatized him. As is evident, these elements of his childhood—an idealized vision of the mother, an estranged father and a recurring nightmare—reappeared in his films. Even when his father tried to reach out to him, he repelled these attempts. ‘I can remember times when he spoke about poetry or literature or writing, and that definitely did leave an impression on me. I suppose I wanted to pretend that I didn’t care; perhaps I used that as a kind of defence mechanism because if I had accepted that I cared, it might have hurt more,’ he says. Born to parents who were both poets, in a family where four generations before him had been acclaimed poets, Javed’s literary credentials were coded into his genes from birth. He was an avid reader, indiscriminately poring over books and magazines from an early age. Be it the poetry of Faiz, the short stories of Saadat Hassan Manto or Krishan Chander, the novels of Ismat Chughtai, he read it all. Javed Akhtar says he was most influenced by Krishan Chander and admired him a lot. His reading habit was so varied that in his early teens, he was reading both Maxim Gorky’s Mother and the detective thrillers (Jasoosi Duniya) of Ibn-e-Safi. The detective thrillers—be it Indian or American pulp fiction—\n\nwere a big favourite for their fast action, tight plots and economies of expression. He remembers the novels of Ibn-e-Safi for their fascinating characters with memorable names. ‘Ibn-e-Safi was a master at naming his characters. All of us who read him remember those names . . . There was a Chinese villain, his name was Sing Hi. There was a Portuguese villain called Garson . . . an Englishman who had come to India and was into yoga . . . was called Gerald Shastri.’ This technique of giving catchy names to characters would stay with him. The wide range of reading not only gave him the sensitivity with which progressive writers approached their subjects but also a very good sense of plot and speaking styles. Here, it would be apt to quote a paragraph from Ibn-e-Safi’s detective novel, House of Fear—featuring his eccentric detective, Imran. The conversation takes place just outside a nightclub: ‘So, young man. So now you have also starred frequenting these places?’ ‘Yes. I often come by to pay Flush,’ Imran said respectfully. ‘Flush! Oh, so now you play Flush . . .’ ‘Yes, yes. I feel like it when I am a bit drunk . . .’ ‘Oh! So you have also started drinking?’ ‘What can I say? I swear I’ve never drunk alone. Frequently I find hookers who do not agree to anything without a drink . . .’\n\nThis scene would find a real-life parallel as well as a fictional one in Javed’s life later. Javed’s memory, like Salim Khan’s, is incredible, for he remembers snatches of songs from Aarzoo, a film he was taken to see when he was about five years old. ‘Aye dil mujhe aisi jagah le chal jahan koi na ho . . .’ is the Talat Mahmood hit he remembers, though he has no recollection of who he went with. His first fully formed memory of a film was Mehmoob Khan’s Aan, which he saw the day he was enrolled is Class I of St Mary’s School in Lucknow. He had heard of someone called Dilip Kumar and saw him for the first time in Lucknow’s Basant Talkies, thoroughly enjoying the star’s acting and the film’s action. After that, he saw and liked a slew of films, some of which are still acknowledged as all-time classics. Films like Shree 420, Munimji, Do Bigha Zameen. He appreciated Jagriti for the large cast of children and Mother India for the rebel character of Birju—who, he believes, was an early version of the Angry Young Man. His fascination with the negative character, the anti-hero, started with Dev Anand in Jaal, a film he watched while in college. One\n\nparticular film had a deep impact on him, because its maker and actor, Guru Dutt, seemed to exude a rare mix of creative flair and artistic melancholy —Pyaasa. After his mother’s death, Javed lived with his maternal grandparents in Lucknow for some time before moving to Aligarh with an aunt while his younger brother Salman remained in Lucknow because ‘one family could not be burdened with two orphans’. It was at his aunt’s place in Aligarh that he started watching movies and reading books incessantly. He did his matriculation from there before his father brought him back to Bhopal, where he spent four years, living off friends and in hostels. His charm and obvious erudition made him hugely popular among his friends and helped him earn a living. As a student, he often did not know where his next meal would come from but he managed. He was a proficient debater who often represented his university in college festivals. He also put his phenomenal memory to good use by reading and remembering thousands of Urdu poems (which he still hasn’t forgotten). His deep interest in literature and fascination with cinema had existed long enough for him to analyse what film direction and writing was all about. His interest in writing peaked with films like Waqt and Kanoon, which had excellent dialogues (by Akhtar-ul-Imaan). He even conjured up a grand plan to use Akhtar-ul-Imaan as his writer if he ever made a film. Obviously, he hadn’t decided to become a writer then; but he wanted to learn film-making by becoming an assistant in Bombay. And he wanted to do it with Guru Dutt. Thus, with a dream of meeting—and maybe working with—Guru Dutt, Javed reached Bombay on 4 October 1964. Tragically, Guru Dutt committed suicide less than a week later (on 10 October) and Javed could never fulfil his dream of working with the maestro. To start earning money, he started doing odd jobs in the film industry—as an assistant to directors or as a clapper boy. During this time, he also wrote dialogues for scenes in films that were eventually credited to well-known screenwriters. He was employed by Kamal Amrohi as a clapper boy for Rs 50 per month. This was a period of intense struggle for young Javed, who had to really rough it out—literally in the elements. In various interviews, Javed remembers the first five years of his stay in Bombay as riddled with problems. He had no fixed\n\nfive years of his stay in Bombay as riddled with problems. He had no fixed address, and often had no idea in the afternoon where he would sleep that night. He had exactly three sets of clothes, which he rotated between wearing and laundering. In fact, he changed clothes at the laundry itself. He had no place to stay and frequently spent the nights on the studio premises. A few times, he was allowed to stay in a storeroom at Kamalistan, Amrohi’s studio, and one night, found three of Meena Kumari’s Filmfare Award trophies in a shoe cupboard. He recalls holding the trophy reverentially every night and pretending that he was receiving the award himself, rehearsing speeches even. This was good practise, which came in handy umpteen times later in his career. One thing that he did not give up even during this tough period was reading. By befriending a secondhand bookseller near Andheri station, he read late into the night in the dim light of the studio compound where he stayed. Just as another man was reading up everything he could lay his hands on in a Mahim lending library. After Kamalistan Studio was disbanded, Javed even spent a few days in a cave with some friends. The cave was infested with mosquitoes and Javed says they were so big that he could feel them ‘mounting him’ even before they bit! This did not continue for long as he moved into a flat that was rented at a princely sum of Rs 120 per month with a friend. When his friend moved out, Javed had a tough time finding a flatmate capable of bringing in Rs 60 every month. One of his drinking buddies offered to share the flat with him, but Javed turned him down because he wasn’t sure he would be able to earn enough to pay the monthly rent. This friend’s name was Shatrughan Sinha. Despite the fact that Jan Nisar Akhtar was in Bombay and had made a name as a lyricist and poet in the film fraternity, Javed faced these hard times by himself. His father had remarried and Javed found the situation extremely uncomfortable. He had initially moved in with his father but left the house after just a few days because he could not get along with his stepmother. He also never sought work using his father’s name or connections. He had, however, become very friendly with one of his father’s friends, Sahir Ludhianvi. The senior poet became very fond of the impetuous but prodigiously talented Javed. Sahir often acted as a buffer between father and son as he knew both their natures very well. He even supported Javed financially during this period but never made it look like a favour.2 As the struggles became grimmer, Javed got an offer—of Rs 600 per month— from a famous and successful writer to ghostwrite for him, a job that could last a\n\nfrom a famous and successful writer to ghostwrite for him, a job that could last a lifetime. After three days of thought, Javed rejected the offer, deciding that credit was as important to him as the money. After working with Amrohi and on odd jobs for about a year, he got a job at Rs 100 per month with director S.M. Sagar who was about to start his career with a stunt film called Sarhadi Lootera. He was taken on as an assistant director and clapper boy for the film. His primary role was to read out the day’s dialogues to the stars and help them rehearse. The dialogue writer hired for the film had left abruptly and a desperate Sagar entrusted Javed with the job temporarily. He did a good enough job for the first couple of scenes to be formally made the dialogue writer. The film’s second hero, interested in screenplays and dialogues himself, liked what Javed wrote. His name was Salim Khan.\n\nThe Start of a Dream Team\n\n‘As a writer, he had the courage and I had the intricacy’ —Javed Akhtar\n\nAlthough Sarhadi Lootera collapsed at the box office, it is remembered for creating a collaboration like no other. The film introduced the two men, but their formal partnership was still some time away. In fact, the thought of a partnership had not struck either of them at this point. Salim and Javed found common interests to bond over and kept in touch even after the film was completed. Javed used to stay in Andheri (which was pretty much a wilderness in the late 1960s) but moved to Bandra in 1968, where Salim stayed. They often got together in the evenings, watched movies, talked about their favourites and discussed story ideas. Javed wrote3 the dialogues for a film that boasted of pretty major stars— Dharmendra and Sharmila Tagore. Yakeen was a spy thriller where Dharmendra is a scientist in a top-secret government research project that is being targeted by foreign powers. They replace him with a lookalike who fools everybody, except the real Dharmendra’s dog. Like Sarhadi Lootera, this film did not do too well either. Interestingly, it has a small scene in which Dharmendra—who has no best friend in the movie—has to approach his girlfriend’s mother himself to ask for her hand in marriage. In the scene, he speaks highly of his government job, salary, perquisites and his good habits (including teetotalism). In hindsight, it is fascinating to see how, a few years later, a tongue-in-cheek reversal of this scene plays out in what is Hindi cinema’s most memorable film when Dharmendra’s best friend goes to cook his goose in front of the girl’s mausi! But apart from the flops, they had their fair share of heartbreaks at the pitching stage itself—even some funny ones. Javed Akhtar recounted the story of his first ever script narration. He had gone to a producer—Baboobhai Bhanji4 —after pulling a lot of strings and the man had listened to the script without interruption. After finishing, a nervous Javed Akhtar respectfully enquired what\n\nthe producer thought of the scene. To young Javed, the producer explained the perils of being original in Bollywood: ‘Darling, your story is good but there is a big risk involved . . . this hasn’t been used in any film yet.’ Javed half-jokingly adds a moral to the story, ‘I never wrote a story that has not come before.’ Indeed, Salim–Javed’s forte became giving an unprecedented spin to stories that ‘had come before’. They were still jobless when S.M. Sagar came to their rescue—or something like it—and asked them to develop a short story into a screenplay. They had no plans to become a team but agreed to do it for the money. They took about twelve days to write the screenplay and the film became Adhikar—starring Ashok Kumar, Deb Mukherji and Nanda. The story was credited to R.S. Verma, who seemed to have written for a creative writing competition called the Madhuri Film Story Contest and the ‘shooting scripts, dialogues & lyrics’ were credited to Ramesh Pant. There was no mention of Salim–Javed anywhere in the credits, though they were paid Rs 5000 for developing the screenplay. The story was a complicated love triangle. Boy meets Girl 1, falls in love and impregnates her. Boy marries Girl 2, following a misunderstanding. Girl 2 finds out about Girl 1 and brings the child from that relationship home, claiming it is hers. The story was completely different from the standard-issue Bollywood unwed-mother love triangle and the screenplay was good enough to impress Sagar’s assistant director, Sudhir Wahi. He suggested that the two youngsters try their luck at Sippy Films. Sippy Films was the banner of G.P. Sippy, who had strayed into film-making from a variety of jobs including import-export and construction. He had started off with B-grade thrillers but eventually made it big with two successive hits featuring two of the industry’s stars—the Shammi Kapoor starrer Brahmchari in 1968 and Bandhan featuring the hit pairing of Rajesh Khanna and Mumtaz in 1969. With two massive hits, G.P. Sippy had gained confidence and was joined in the film business by his son, Ramesh, who had dropped out from the London School of Economics and had spent the last seven years doing lowly jobs in different units. Ramesh had new-fangled notions and often talked about changing how the movie business worked. In an industry working on the same stories since time immemorial and shooting scenes written on the sets, he wanted\n\nstories since time immemorial and shooting scenes written on the sets, he wanted to create a strong story department. Though that wasn’t new to the film industry, the way Ramesh Sippy envisaged the department certainly was. Salim and Javed—still not a team formally—landed up at the Sippy Films office at Khar. They offered to narrate a script with a dialogue straight out of a film: ‘You may not necessarily do it but we assure you that you will want to hear it to the end.’ Ramesh Sippy was completely taken aback by their cockiness. He recounts: ‘I was tired and was lying down as they began to narrate. And midway I found myself sitting up and towards the end I was leaning forward, listening intently to everything they said . . . That was the first time I could see the whole film, smoothly flowing scene to scene in my head.’ After this session, Ramesh Sippy called his production controller, Narinder Bedi, and directed him to hire the two youngsters. Salim and Javed asked for a monthly salary of Rs 1000 each but were offered Rs 750 instead, with a promise of an increment if their work was satisfactory. ‘The salary never increased. It remained Rs 750 for many years . . .’ Javed laughs but admits they looked at the money as a memento of sorts and did not want it to be stopped. Thus, Salim Khan and Javed Akhtar joined the story department of Sippy Films. They started work on a very unusual story about a widow and widower, which was being sniggered at in filmi circles as box-office suicide because heart-throb Rajesh Khanna would die within a few reels of the film. The film was Andaz.\n\nPart II:\n\nTHE PARTNERSHIP\n\nAndaz\n\n‘Rajesh Khanna witnessed unbelievable popularity, such that no one had ever seen or imagined. In fact from 1969 to 1973, it was a one-horse race. It would be said of those days, that before any Indian child could say mama and papa, he would say Rajesh Khanna’ —Javed Akhtar, speaking after Rajesh Khanna’s death\n\nAfter making two successful films with Shammi Kapoor and Rajesh Khanna individually, G.P. Sippy pulled off a coup by signing them both for Andaz. Given the unusual story of the film, it is a wonder both stars agreed to be a part of it—thanks in no small measure to Sippy Films’ growing clout in the industry. Rajesh Khanna was becoming bigger with every release and was probably a bigger star than even Shammi Kapoor in 1971, when Andaz was being made. This would have been fertile ground for ego tussles, with both stars needing substantial handling and assurances on their respective roles. It is therefore remarkable that these issues didn’t crop up, or at least did not become a hindrance, considering this was the director’s first film. The writing credits for Andaz were shared between five different people. The story and screenplay were credited to Sachin Bhowmick, veteran screenwriter who had written some of Rajesh Khanna and Shammi Kapoor’s biggest hits, such as Aradhana, Aan Milo Sajna, An Evening In Paris, Brahmchari and Janwar. The dialogues were credited to Gulzar, who was fast gaining acceptance in the industry as a lyricist and writer. He too had written dialogues for major hits like Khamoshi, Ashirwad and Shagird. Additional script work was credited to Satish Bhatnagar, Salim Khan and Javed Akhtar of the Sippy Films Story Department. Sachin Bhowmick had suggested remaking a French film—Un Homme et une Femme (A Man and a Woman)—which had won the top prize at the 1966 Cannes Film Festival. Ramesh Sippy liked the story. ‘People had made films\n\nabout widows earlier but I wanted to tell this story in a commercial format. It was never my desire to make very arty films or things that defined a different space. I wanted to make good commercial cinema, with an edge. I saw Andaz as an entertaining film, but with characters carrying some baggage. And I felt Shammi Kapoor had reached a point in career where he needed to do more mature roles,’ he says. He approached the ‘dancing star’ and told him, ‘I’ve decided I’m going to make a film with you. And I’m not going to make the kind of film you’ve been doing all the time.’ This attitude of his was important, because this cockiness and chutzpah were things he had in common with Salim–Javed. Salim remembers that the story and cast had been decided—they had even recorded and picturized a song, and had signed on Gulzar to write the dialogues, but the screenplay was not ready. Salim–Javed came in and wrote the complete screenplay of Andaz. With two veteran writers (Bhowmick and Gulzar had been around for nearly a decade by then) involved, it is easy to dismiss the story department’s contribution as patchwork, which was mainly doing on-set additions and changes to suit the exact requirements of the day’s shooting. But it is interesting to note that Rajesh Khanna interacted with Salim–Javed enough (and was impressed enough) to request them to write his next film (Haathi Mere Saathi). Even Hema Malini remembers that towards the end of Andaz’s shooting, Ramesh Sippy was almost always huddled with the young writers (whose names she did not know then). Clearly, their contribution and promise were much more than the subsidiary credit they got. Andaz is the story of a widower Ravi (Shammi Kapoor) living in a sprawling estate with his daughter, Munni, and mother. He is a dutiful family man who is very concerned about his younger brother Badal (Roopesh Kumar), a bit of a wastrel, studying in the city. Ravi is actually an orphan adopted by the family. A single mother, Sheetal (Hema Malini), comes to the town with a son, Deepu, and starts teaching at the local convent. Ravi and Sheetal bond over their single-parent status and start developing feelings for each other. A flashback reveals Sheetal’s relationship with Raj (Rajesh Khanna), who impregnated her and died in an accident, and whose father refused to acknowledge Sheetal. A second flashback reveals that Ravi was married to Mona (Simi Garewal) who died because she concealed a fatal risk during her\n\nMona (Simi Garewal) who died because she concealed a fatal risk during her pregnancy to fulfil Ravi’s dream of having a child. When Ravi and Sheetal are about to take their relationship further, Badal returns home and tries to break them up by revealing Sheetal’s past as an unwed mother. But this ploy fails when it is revealed that Ravi wasn’t picked off the streets but is actually his mother’s biological son born out of wedlock. Badal then rapes and murders a domestic help Mahua (Aruna Irani), and tries to frame Ravi. But Ravi manages to clear his name and in the climax, Badal is arrested after a fight and Sheetal is accepted into Ravi’s family. Though they received credit only for ‘Additional Script Work’ (and were completely missing from the publicity material), there were some elements in the script that were very similar to their soon-to-be-developed signature style. These could be their own contributions or influences they picked up from lead writer Gulzar. He had a penchant for writing natural dialogue and while working with him, they ensured all the characters spoke in a different dialect or style. Mahua, for example, speaks in an unusual accent, which is common to people in the hills. Badal has a sleazy, lilting way of talking. This difference in talking styles of characters is something Salim–Javed would do throughout their career. Gulzar has very fond memories of working with the duo and the many evenings he spent with them. Andaz came in a long list of jubilee hits that Rajesh Khanna delivered from 1969 onwards, which cemented his superstar status, and created a hysterical fan following and unprecedented box-office clout. The film was promoted with him at the centre, even though his was a ‘special appearance’. A few weeks after Andaz’s release, Sippy Films took out an advertisement in the trade magazine Screen: ‘The Million Rupee Week – Ever since the movies began, no movie has grossed over a million rupees in its first week in Bombay as Andaz has done! Never before, perhaps never again!’ This ad appeared the day Haathi Mere Saathi was released in Bombay. The film went on to become an even bigger hit than Andaz. As it turned out, not only Rajesh Khanna, but even Sippy Films broke Andaz’s record soon after. And Salim–Javed played a major role in both.\n\nHaathi Mere Saathi\n\nHaathi Mere Saathi came to Salim–Javed purely on the basis of the rapport they had built up with superstar Rajesh Khanna during the shooting of Andaz. While the actor’s role in the film had been a very short one, it was enough for him to gauge the flow and flair these two young writers brought to the script— even though they received no official credit for it. Salim says, ‘Rajesh Khanna thought his guest role in Andaz was the best guest role ever written.’ During the shooting and after the success of that first film, the duo had struck up a friendship with the superstar and were regularly invited to his place for drinks. At one of these sessions, Rajesh Khanna told Salim of a predicament that was typical of a film star’s success in the 1970s. The superstar was in the process of purchasing a bungalow (which he named Aashirwad after he had bought it) on Carter Road in Bombay from actor Rajendra Kumar. To fund the purchase, he had taken a substantial signing amount from the producer—‘Sandow’ M.M.A. Chinnappa Devar—for acting in the remake of a south Indian hit. The signing amount of Rs 5 lakh—a suitcase full of cash—was something unheard of in those days, even by Rajesh Khanna’s standards. He seemed clueless even about the original movie’s language (Tamil) but knew that it was a terrible script. ‘I need the money to buy the house but I cannot act in the film the way it stands . . . Tum log kuch kar sakte ho?’ He assured them that he would negotiate with the producer to get them both money and credit. At the time, Salim and Javed were not officially a team as they were still employees of the Sippy Films Story Department. When they agreed to the proposal, Haathi Mere Saathi became the first film where the duo got joint credit. The somewhat fairy-tale-ish plot of the original film in Tamil and the profusion of animals in a circus-like setting had made Salim–Javed quite apprehensive about the reaction of the Hindi film audience. When they discussed this with Rajesh Khanna, he told them that they could change everything and write a fresh script. ‘You can make as many changes but keep just five\n\nwrite a fresh script. ‘You can make as many changes but keep just five characters the same . . . the four elephants and me,’ he warned them. Producer Devar came up with a similar but funnier claim, ‘I make film with Murugan [a popular deity in Tamil Nadu], Rajesh Khanna and Elephant.’ When they began work, the flow was quite smooth and they had a first draft ready in just twenty days. This would become a hallmark of most of their landmark projects, where the basic screenplay would be completed in one short burst of creativity. Rajesh Khanna had taken it upon himself to get the screenplay approved by the producer and the director (who happened to be the producer’s brother). While Salim and Javed were working on the script, the actor used his rapport with Laxmikant–Pyarelal and Anand Bakshi and recorded the title song. For the final presentation of the script, he called Salim–Javed, the director and the producer to his house and orchestrated a complete show. The narration started and at the right moment in the script, Rajesh Khanna pressed the Play button on his tape recorder and the sounds of ‘Chal chal chal mere saathi o mere haathi’ filled the room—creating a rousing atmosphere that floored the producer. The latter had only one objection—to a scene in which the hero got drunk. He shouted ‘Hero, no sharaafi’ (meaning ‘the hero cannot be a sharaabi’) because a drunk man cannot perform on the trapeze. The writers duly afflicted the hero with a fever instead! The detailed narration took place in Chennai a few days later with the help of an interpreter for the benefit of the predominantly Tamil unit. Javed says, ‘I recall we were often speaking so loudly that Mr Surinder Kapoor, Anil Kapoor’s father, once knocked at our door and asked if everything was okay. He was staying in the same hotel and shooting his own film in the city!’ The story combined two popular Hindi film plots—the rich-girl-poor-boy romance and the love triangle—presented as a carnival of music and animals. As a child, Raju (Rajesh Khanna) is saved by four elephants, and as his father lies dying, he instructs Raju to take care of them.5 Though Raju is heir to a massive fortune, his preoccupation with his elephants costs him his entire inheritance and his lady love, Tanu (Tanuja), whose father (Madan Puri) is opposed to their relationship. Eventually, Raju wins back Tanu, rebuilds his fortune with the help of his four elephants and starts a zoo called Pyar Ki\n\nDuniya.6 Raju’s continued preoccupation with his elephants makes Tanu feel neglected and, after the birth of her son, extremely apprehensive of his safety. When the lead elephant—Ramu—realizes they are the cause of the couple’s estrangement, he brings them together and sacrifices his life to save his master from the bullets of a rival circus owner (K.N. Singh). As is obvious, the story was particularly suited for children and family audiences. The film’s appeal was somewhat like a Disney film. It was a fablelike story with strong moral values, which did not degenerate into sermonizing but managed to keep the viewers—especially children, who loved it—hooked with its fast pace, stunts and music. The entire film was full of pretty clever stunts by the elephants, many of which were improvised on the sets. The producer, Devar, was an expert animal trainer himself and commandeered his elephant troupe like a ringmaster. The end result was a movie with action centred on the animals, making it look like a circus unfolding on screen. The Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) gave a special award to the film for spreading awareness about their cause. Laxmikant–Pyarelal’s music too was very well received and smashed several records. There were certain touches to the script that would become part of Salim– Javed’s signature in the coming years. Despite having Rajesh Khanna—the king of romance—as the hero, he is not overtly romantic. In fact, there is a humorous touch to his wooing, like the scene in which he proposes to Tanuja. There was a distinct message of socialism in a few scenes as well, where the cavalier attitude of the rich towards the poor is mentioned. Quite surprisingly, these lines were said by Tanuja’s character, who could well have conformed to the Hindi-film stereotype of the rich heroine and remained vacuous. Maybe it was the writers—with their social roots—speaking. However, Haathi Mere Saathi did not have any major ‘repeat-value’ dialogues which became Salim–Javed’s forte in the coming years. The reviews of the film ranged from moderate to positive. The writers were not identified by name but some of the reviews mentioned the script in passing. Hindustan Times said, ‘This is a Madras production and as can be expected, the producer is not content to rest on the laurels of the elephants’ performance alone and has woven a workable script around them.’\n\nHaathi Mere Saathi turned out to be a stunner at the box office. Even by Rajesh Khanna’s reputation for delivering blockbusters, it was a massive one. Not only was it the biggest hit of 1971 (which saw box-office biggies like Mera Gaon Mera Desh, Andaz, Caravan and Amar Prem), it also went on to become the highest-grossing Hindi film ever of the time, a record it maintained for a while. Until then Johny Mera Naam had been the highest grosser (having collected Rs 50 lakh in each of the film territories) but Haathi Mere Saathi raced ahead with collections in excess of Rs 1 crore per territory. The impact of the film—and the power of the revised script—is best described by fact that the producer remade it in Tamil, which turned out to be an even bigger hit than the original Tamil film on which Haathi Mere Saathi was based. The experience was not all milk and honey for Salim–Javed, though. For such a successful, record-smashing film, they were paid a paltry sum of Rs 10,000 and requests for a bonus were summarily turned down. Contrast this to the payment made to the music directors, Laxmikant–Pyarelal. Pyarelal recalls the producer coming to their houses with Rs 1 lakh each placed on a silver plate when they signed the film. ‘He repeated this when the work was completed!’ he smiles. Even the credit—partly negotiated by Rajesh Khanna himself—was given rather grudgingly, if one tracks the mentions in the trade advertisements. There was no mention of the screenwriters in any of the pre-release ads; the story was credited to the producer. The double-spread ad on the day of the film’s release (in Screen, dated 14 May 1971) credited ‘Saleem-Javeeth’ (sic) for the screenplay, but this was also removed after the third week. Well-known writer Inder Raj Anand was credited for the dialogues though Salim–Javed wrote nearly all the lines as well. In a later interview, the producer claimed that he had not signed them for the screenplay but merely for ‘story discussions’ on Rajesh Khanna’s request. He claimed that their contribution was merely a few actionscene suggestions. As a result of the producer’s refusal to acknowledge their contribution, Salim– Javed never worked with him again. Later, two major stars (Dharmendra and Rishi Kapoor), on being offered films by Devar, asked the producer to get the scripts written by Salim–Javed but the writers didn’t budge. In fact, their relationship with Rajesh Khanna also soured after this, because despite his promise to negotiate on their behalf, nothing had come of it. This was quite\n\npromise to negotiate on their behalf, nothing had come of it. This was quite symptomatic of the situation writers faced in 1960s, as remuneration and recognition were not given as a matter of course. Interestingly, producer Devar and director Thirumugham repeated the ‘animal’ formula in their next Hindi venture, Gaai Aur Gori. Starring Jaya Bhaduri and Shatrughan Sinha, the film told the story of a cow who ‘averts a train accident’, ‘fights a dog which attacks her mistress’ and ‘unites an estranged husband and wife’. Gaai Aur Gori released in 1973 and (needless to say) sank at the box office. That was the year Salim–Javed wrote Zanjeer. Salim–Javed thus ended 1971 with two films in the year’s top ten grossers —Andaz and Haathi Mere Saathi. While Rajesh Khanna’s charisma and both the directors’ deft handling of the scripts contributed substantially to the success of the films, the two writers’ efforts played an undeniable part as well. But as two cocky youngsters in an industry which placed a premium on grey hair, there was hardly any buzz about them. They were, of course, valued members of the Sippy Films Story Department and some of the script ideas they were peddling seemed to have serious potential. In fact, one of the script ideas was something quite unthinkable in the male-dominated Hindi film industry for it had the heroine playing a double role as the prime mover of the film. It was called Seeta Aur Geeta.\n\nSeeta Aur Geeta\n\n‘If the word “romp” didn’t exist before Seeta Aur Geeta, it would have been coined to describe this fun, cute film’ —Carla Miriam Levy aka @filmigeek, Bollywood fan and blogger\n\nSalim–Javed—in their second pairing (though not officially so)—did what they would soon develop into an art form. They took an extremely popular theme and gave it a distinctive twist to make it completely their own. In fact, after they were done with the script, the original was hardly remembered. They took the plot of The Prince and the Pauper—a story of two identical characters whose personalities and circumstances were completely dissimilar. This plot had already been used to great effect in the superhit Ram Aur Shyam, with the legendary Dilip Kumar essaying the two roles. Made just five years ago, the film was absolutely fresh in viewers’ minds but that did not stop Salim– Javed from giving it a distaff twist. Docile Seeta (Hema Malini) is brought up in a mansion by a cruel aunt (Manorama) who steals her monthly allowance (from her trust fund) and plans to control her inheritance by marrying her off to someone of her choice. Geeta (Hema Malini, again) is a flamboyant gypsy girl who performs roadside acrobatics for a living. When they accidentally switch places, Geeta falls in love with a doctor Ravi (Sanjeev Kumar) and takes the fight to Seeta’s aunt. Seeta, meanwhile, falls in love with Geeta’s street-performing partner, Raaka (Dharmendra), and helps him overcome his bad habits. Seeta’s aunt’s brother, Ranjeet (Roopesh Kumar), finds out about the switch and kidnaps Seeta. Geeta’s mother reveals that the two girls are twins and she—being childless—had taken away one. And justice is served to the villains in a rousing climax. Seeta Aur Geeta was the script with which Salim–Javed came into their own. It is obvious from each scene in the film that everybody associated with it was having lots of fun and that brought an infectious energy to every frame. Their\n\ntrademark touches—which would get stronger in the coming years—were visible throughout; you can almost hear them chuckle as you watch some of the scenes. Whistle-inducing dialogues—both comic and emotional—crackled through the film and exploded at regular intervals. When Geeta (thought to be Seeta) is caught by the police and brought to the station, she wreaks mayhem and is perched atop the ceiling fan when her uncle and aunt arrive. When the aunt says ‘Neeche aa jao, beti’, Geeta responds with ‘Upar aa jao, moti’.iii It was an incredibly popular line, which drew hysterical laughter when it was first uttered on-screen and had—what the film industry calls—tremendous repeat value. Not only this line, but each one of Hema Malini and Manorama’s interactions had a manic sense of humour. For example, ‘Hum tere chacha aur chachi lagte hain’, was parried with ‘Soorat se toh chamcha aur chamchi lagte ho’,iv and ‘Kahan chali gayi thi, Seeta meri beti?’ was met with ‘Mahabaleshwar gayi thi, haathi mere saathi.’v It was critical to have these interactions because Manorama as the Chachi— for all practical purposes—was the main villain. After watching her torturing Seeta, seeing the Chachi suffer at Geeta’s hands in a series of entertaining scenes is almost cathartic for the audience. And it wasn’t only with Manorama. Hema Malini had fantastic lines throughout the movie, which even top heroes would have killed for. Whether it was a comic situation where she brushes off her borrowed clothes with a droll ‘Main maange ke kapdon mein hamesha achhi lagti hoon,’vi or a fiery assurance to her grandmother—‘Jab tak tumhare aankhon mein aansoo hai, jab tak tumhare dil mein dard hai, jab tak iss ghar mein zulm hai, main yahan se nahin jaoongi’vii—Hema’s lines were mind-blowing. It helped that the director was completely in sync with the writers and Hema’s scenes were filmed in a way that brought maximum impact to the lines. When she confronts Roopesh Kumar about his misdemeanours, she keeps on bouncing a ping-pong ball on a racket while delivering her lines, making Roopesh squirm. It was a brilliant touch that brought out the character’s cool aggression perfectly. Another notable aspect of the script was the different styles of speech that distinguished each character.\n\nForeign-returned doctor Ravi’s dialogues were sprinkled with throwaway lines in English. The street performer Raaka had lots of local Bombay slang like laafa, khunnas, halkat, bhankas and bindaas.7 Geeta’s speech was like Raaka’s while Seeta had halting, almost incomplete sentences. Even a minor character like Seeta’s cousin, Sheila (played by Honey Irani) had a distinctive style—with a smattering of English words, the way modern young girls spoke in those days. Seeta Aur Geeta’s box-office performance was again stupendous, and it became the top-grossing film of 1972. Hema Malini was the second choice for the role and was taken only because the Sippys could not afford the fee Mumtaz wanted. However, after this film, Hema Malini became the undisputed No. 1 heroine of the industry. But what Seeta Aur Geeta did went beyond mere numbers and ranks. It changed the way women characters behaved and were perceived by the film industry. Suddenly, women doing action became the rage. In Gehri Chaal, Hema Malini was asked to fight the villains while male stars like Jeetendra and Amitabh Bachchan watched from the sidelines. Something similar happened in Salim–Javed’s own film too. Prakash Mehra insisted on Jaya Bhaduri featuring in the fight scene of Zanjeer because of Seeta Aur Geeta. Hema’s powerhouse performance—and the script—was the pivot for this change. After Seeta Aur Geeta, the similar storyline was rehashed in a slew of remakes over the next two years, one in Hindi the very next year starring Jeetendra (Jaise Ko Taisa), another in Telugu (Ganga Manga) and a third in Tamil (Vani Rani). The durability of this formula carried well into the 1990s, with hits like Chaalbaaz (starring Sridevi) and Kishen Kanhaiya (with Anil Kapoor in the title roles). Despite such success, Salim–Javed were miffed with the Sippys for giving credit for ‘their’ film to the Sippy Films Story Department. By this time, they were rapidly gaining acceptance among producers and had already sold a couple of story ideas for films. Their annoyance was recognized by the Sippys as much as their talent. G.P. Sippy was on a roll and wanted to make a major multistarrer. He very clearly understood that this would only be possible if they had a kick-ass script, which would be Salim–Javed’s and theirs only, he promised. And the next film would make history, he predicted.\n\nBut before box-office history could be rewritten, Salim–Javed had already written a character which would rewrite several careers and the history of the Hindi film industry. The character was Inspector Vijay Khanna of Zanjeer.\n\nZanjeer\n\n‘Arre, baap re baap’—A member of the audience during the scene where Inspector Vijay Khanna loses his temper with Sher Khan in the police station\n\nIn hindsight, it is easy to say that Zanjeer was an idea whose time had come. On the one hand, people were fed up with government inaction, apathy and corruption. There was rampant unemployment across classes and a thriving crime scene (often in connivance with the system). Zanjeer was able to tap into these rumblings of discontent and give them a cinematic voice in the fiery figure of the Angry Young Man8, an iconic character brilliantly conceived by Salim– Javed—and one that spawned a whole new breed of films. On the other hand, the most common form of entertainment—Hindi cinema—had moved far away from reality; its brand of fantasy and romance did not cut the mustard any more. After a dream run that lasted till 1971 (when he had six out of the year’s top ten grossers), Rajesh Khanna had delivered several flops in 1972. People—in a way —were sick of the saccharine-sweet romance and the dancing-around-trees routine. And yet, not one major star of the day was ready to act in the film. According to Salim Khan, he had decided upon a treatment of Zanjeer even before he teamed up with Javed. The inspiration had come from his father’s stories of dutiful police officers fighting in the ravines of Chambal. However, this was more of a concept and not a full script, and was first sold to Dharmendra (for a princely sum of Rs 2500). He was to be the main lead, Prakash Mehra would direct and Dharmendra’s brother, Ajit, would be a partner in the production. However, the partnership between Ajit and Prakash Mehra did not work out and Dharmendra dropped out of the film after his brother’s exit. The script was then offered to Dilip Kumar, who thought it would make a very good film but felt the lead character was too one-dimensional and did not\n\nallow enough scope for ‘performance’. Much later in his career—during the shooting of Shakti—Dilip Kumar told Salim Khan that there were three films he regretted not doing in his career: Pyaasa, Baiju Bawra and Zanjeer. The first actor who was signed for the film was Pran—for the role of Sher Khan. There must have been something in Salim–Javed’s narration for as soon as Prakash Mehra heard the script he could envision no other actor in the role. Once Pran was on board, he—being the good soul that he was—fixed up a meeting with Dev Anand. Salim–Javed felt it would be a case of horrible miscasting and their apprehensions were proved correct when Dev Anand asked for a couple of songs to be picturized on him. (Take a moment to imagine Dev Anand—God bless his soul and swagger—twirling a police baton and singing a romantic duet in Zanjeer. Now thank God and proceed.) Prakash Mehra had such confidence in the script that he refused Dev Anand— one of the biggest stars of the day. It then went to Raaj Kumar’s durbar. He too loved the script, probably because he had been an inspector before joining films, and agreed to do the role, but—and this was a big but—he wanted the film to be shot in Madras. One apocryphal story goes that he did not like the smell of Prakash Mehra’s hair oil and made this preposterous demand to wriggle out of having to work with him. You might wonder whether the script really was all that path-breaking if an actor could find it wanting when weighed against the smell of hair oil. But that’s what Raaj Kumar was all about. Salim–Javed, in the meantime, were completely sold on a new actor who seemed to have earned a reputation for delivering flop after flop. Every time a hero rejected Zanjeer, they pestered Prakash Mehra to take on this new hero. Mehra was more than a little surprised at their recommendation because the industry couldn’t stop making fun of ‘lambooji’. Javed Akhtar says, ‘I don’t know why the industry could not see what we thought was absolutely obvious— that Amitabh Bachchan was an exceptionally good actor!’ They had seen Amitabh Bachchan’s films—some more than once—and were convinced of the actor’s ability to portray the role of the angry police officer. During this time, Pran’s son was working in Madras and staying with a certain Ajitabh Bachchan, who took him to watch a film called Bombay To Goa, which starred his brother, Amitabh. Pran’s son liked the film so much that he heartily recommended the hero to his father, who passed on the recommendation to\n\nPrakash Mehra. Pran’s word added weight to what Salim–Javed had been saying all along and Mehra finally agreed to meet this new actor. Salim remembers that they introduced Prakash Mehra to Amitabh Bachchan at Rajkamal Studios, where the latter was shooting for Pyar Ki Kahaani. Partly out of desperation and partly out of respect for Salim–Javed, and Pran, Prakash Mehra signed Amitabh Bachchan for Zanjeer reportedly for a sum of Rs 60,000. It was probably the first time in the history of Hindi cinema that writers had expressed such strong opinions about the casting and even got their way, the confidence in their vision overshadowing commercial considerations. Left to himself, Prakash Mehra would have certainly chosen a more saleable hero. Salim–Javed’s mission to make Zanjeer a big, impactful film did not end here. They approached Jaya Bhaduri—a top star at that time—and narrated the story. She was hesitant since there was not much of a role for her. Salim recalls telling her frankly that there was no reason for her to act in Zanjeer except one— Amitabh Bachchan, with whom she was in a serious relationship then. She agreed, again thanks to the writers’ persuasive powers. This degree of passion and involvement to make a project viable and marketable was absolutely unique to Salim–Javed. During the making of Zanjeer, their ambition and desire to be noticed probably pushed them to deploy all their efforts towards ensuring its success. But they maintained this level of involvement in their projects even after they became major stars. In Zanjeer, young Vijay sees his parents gunned down by a faceless killer on the night of Diwali. He only sees a bracelet with a horse on the hand that fires the gun.9 He is adopted by a police officer’s family and grows up to be one too. He is, however, traumatized by recurring nightmares of the horse and his career is affected by his violent reactions to crime. In his twelfth posting, he meets Sher Khan (Pran) who runs gambling dens in Vijay’s area. He challenges Sher Khan to a fight and his daredevilry impresses the Pathan so much enough that he shuts down his illegal network. Vijay keeps getting tip-offs from an anonymous caller (Om Prakash) about smuggling activities and he starts capturing these consignments. This puts him in direct conflict with smuggling kingpin Teja (Ajit), whose public face is that of a respected businessman. In the course of one such investigation, Vijay meets a roadside knife sharpener, Mala (Jaya Bhadhuri), who witnessed a crime related to the case. Due to the risks to Mala’s\n\nlife, Vijay brings her home and eventually falls in love with her. Soon after Teja frames Vijay in a corruption case and has him jailed for six months. When Vijay is released, he vows to destroy Teja. He has a brief change of heart (due to Mala’s insistence that he refrain from violence), but ultimately, he—along with Sher Khan—attacks Teja in his mansion. This is where he finds out that Teja was the one who murdered his parents and proceeds to kill him—on the night of Diwali. ‘Jab tak baithne ko na kaha jaye, sharafat se khade raho. Yeh police station hai, tumhare baap ka ghar nahin.’ix If one must specify the moment when the Angry Young Man entered our collective consciousness, this would be it. And Zanjeer was full of such lines—in different styles to suit each character. Inspector Vijay Khanna’s lines were simple and he delivered them in an understated manner. Sher Khan’s lines were more bombastic: ‘Aaj zindagi mein pehli baar Sher Khan ki sher se takkar hui hai.’x And don Teja’s lines were as dapper as his suits. When his moll asks about the new inspector’s raids on his activities, he deadpans, ‘Kabir keh raha tha ek inspector ko paise ki zaroorat hai . . .’xi Such dialogues—with a breathtaking economy of expression—were not what the Hindi film audience had ever heard. A Hindi film heroine had never—okay, probably just once before10—used words like laafa, bhankas and halkat. But since Mala was a roadside vendor, this was the language that was natural to her character. Apart from the realistic dialogues and their suitability to the characters, the setting of the film was contemporary and mirrored the prevailing sentiment perfectly. The film was set at a time when the nation was growing up and coming to terms with terrible realities. Adulterated medicine killed children, illicit hooch flooded the markets, goons could be hired for a pittance and honest people were always cornered. When offered Rs 50,000 to kill Vijay, Sher Khan says, ‘Ek inspector ki jaan ki keemat pachaas hazaar rupiyah? Maloom hota hai bada hi imaandar insaan hai.’xii It was a succinct yet devastating comment on the times. Salim–Javed’s socialist inclinations came to the fore when they addressed the middle-class apathy towards initiating social change with a brilliant monologue\n\nspoken by Vijay. When Mala requests him to not risk his life and focus on setting up their home, Vijay bursts out, ‘Hum apne ghar mein aise hi khubsoorat parde lagwayenge aur main yeh jaanne ki koshish bhi nahin karoonga ki in pardon ki doosri taraf duniya mein kya ho raha hai . . .’xiii This one scene— though not the best known—exemplifies how good Salim–Javed were at their craft and how Amitabh Bachchan was the perfect voice for their words. In short, Zanjeer was that perfect balance of situation and talent—both writing and acting. However, Zanjeer faced the issue that projects without stars face even today. It did not sell. No distributor was willing to bet on a seemingly uncharismatic hero and an untested, violent plot. Salim–Javed swung into action once again. They worked their charm with the Sippys and held a special preview of Zanjeer for G.P. and Ramesh Sippy. Since the duo was writing Sholay for the Sippys and the cast was being decided, the pretext was to showcase Amitabh Bachchan for the role of Jai. Salim–Javed paid Rs 1000 out of their pockets to book the Blaze preview theatre and got the Sippys to attend. That swung the tide. When Amitabh Bachchan—a rank newcomer—was signed on for Sholay for Rs 1 lakh, it sent a message to the entire industry that this new actor was hot enough for the Sippys. That alone gave potential distributors of Zanjeer a lot of confidence.11 Salim–Javed were paid Rs 55,000 for Zanjeer’s script but given the value they added to the film—apart from the script—this seems like a pittance. They had a finger in pretty much every pie, from casting to distribution. And yet when the posters were printed they were forgotten, and so they had to get some improvised poster-painting done as well! Salim-Javed’s stunt of getting their names painted on the posters paid off. Zanjeer’s was the first poster that writer–director Vinay Shukla remembers seeing which had the names of the writers on it. ‘Who is this Salim–Javed?’ he had wondered when he saw the poster somewhere near Opera House, initially thinking they were one person. Director–writer Sriram Raghavan remembers the radio spots for Zanjeer, which promised listeners that it would be ‘Yaadon ki zanjeer mein lipta hua inteqam ka shola’.xiv As a ten-year old, he remembers being very excited by this line and, during a family movie outing, he was the only one rooting for Zanjeer\n\nwhile the rest wanted to go for Anamika (which had released just two weeks after Zanjeer). The trade publicity of Zanjeer was mounted around Pran and his run-in with Amitabh Bachchan. The first ads said ‘Friendship between the man of law and the outlaw’. There was no mention of the revenge plot, with the ad pitting Pran and Amitabh Bachchan as two adversaries, their faces dominating the page. Salim–Javed paid money out of their own pockets to release an ad on the day Zanjeer opened. It featured on a premium position—Screen’s inside back cover —and said: ‘Writers of Andaz, Hathi Mere Sathi, Seeta Aur Geeta now give you Zanjeer with Amitabh Bachchan’. (The same issue of Screen had a pre-shooting ad of Prakash Mehra’s next film—Hera Pheri—but without any mention of that movie’s writers.) This ad is very interesting because, probably for the first time in the industry, writers had got an exclusive ad in a trade magazine. And also because none of these films was exclusively or directly credited to them when they were released. In one fell swoop, Salim–Javed wrested the credit for writing these hits and announced it to the industry in style: they were the writers of not only Zanjeer but three major hits of the recent past as well. In short, they went from being rank newcomers to hot property in a single day. Their savvy in marketing themselves came to the fore, and it would aid them for the rest of their careers. Though Zanjeer is probably not among Salim–Javed’s best scripts, the impact of the violence, the dialogues and the seething anger in the hero was quite unprecedented. Javed watched Zanjeer several times in theatres and found the audience reaction to be unlike anything he had ever seen. ‘The reaction was very unusual. People didn’t clap or whistle in the theatre; they watched the film in total silence and awe.’ Referring to the audience reaction of ‘Arre baap re baap’, he says, ‘This is something I had never heard before, and have never heard since. By the time the audience saw Deewaar, they were already familiar with that kind of anger. In Zanjeer, it was a totally new experience for them.’ Salim–Javed had a fair bit of disagreement with Prakash Mehra during the making of the film because the director made some changes unilaterally, ostensibly due to ‘commercial considerations’. ‘Zanjeer would have been ten times better if he had followed the script faithfully,’ the writers said later.\n\nBut despite those changes, the impact of Zanjeer was instantaneous. One week after its release, Screen carried a picture of Amitabh Bachchan and Pran on the front page, calling them ‘Thespian Duo’. The caption of the photograph also mentioned the contribution of Salim–Javed’s script to their performance. The front page also carried a news item with the headline: ‘G.P. Sippy’s next is starstudded venture’. Amitabh Bachchan had well and truly arrived. Screen’s review called Zanjeer a ‘Well-made crime thriller with effective acting, visuals.’ The review in the Times of India said, ‘Zanjeer comes up with an unusual hero for the Hindi screen . . . Salim–Javed provide one of the cleverest scripts encountered in some time—a script which respects a clipping pace, keeps those inevitable inessentials down to the minimum, and springs a good many plausible surprises efficiently.’ The biggest beneficiary was undoubtedly Amitabh Bachchan, who would appear in similar roles for nearly two decades after Zanjeer. And his characters’ anger became a template for several heroes of his generation and those who came after him. Ten years later, when Ardh Satya was released—in which Om Puri delivered a brilliant performance as an upright cop—it was called ‘the arthouse Zanjeer’. And more than forty years later, producers were still paying top dollar—albeit unwillingly—for the rights of the film. Zanjeer was Salim–Javed’s first hit of 1973. But it was not the only script they wrote that had a revenge motive. The duo had already managed to sell an almost identical story to one of India’s canniest producers and that film released towards the end of 1973. It was called Yaadon Ki Baaraat.\n\nYaadon Ki Baaraat\n\nA son sees his parents being shot by a killer whose face he cannot see but he does notice an identifying mark on him. He grows up tormented and is always looking for the killer . . . Wait, isn’t that the story of Zanjeer? Well, yes. In an interview published posthumously, Nasir Husain had said, ‘It was too late when I realized that Salim–Javed had palmed off the same basic plot to me and Prakash Mehra. But our characters and treatment were completely different, and so both Zanjeer and my film were major hits in the same year!’ While agreeing that both stories had revenge as the main angle and the hero was the strong silent sort, it would be doing Salim–Javed a disservice to say that both the scripts were the same. In fact, Salim Khan disagrees with the veteran producer. ‘The films weren’t really similar. Only the vendetta angle is common between Zanjeer and Yaadon Ki Baaraat, which was there in Sholay also. Ajit’s character made the two films look similar. We had told Nasir Husain about it but he said nobody else was willing to play the role.’ They added a complex lost-and-found angle involving three brothers—which had earlier been seen in Yash Chopra’s Waqt in 1965—thus creating the template for this genre that Manmohan Desai would make famous in the coming years. The young writers and the producer first connected during the making of Husain’s Teesri Manzil, in which Salim Khan not only played a small role but also participated in the writing of the script. Evidently, he must have impressed Nasir Husain enough for the film-maker to test writers for the first time, and outsource the project to him and his partner. Husain’s son, director Mansoor Khan, says, ‘The plot of Yaadon Ki Baaraat was a little complex and he needed people to bounce ideas with. The screenplay was written by brainstorming, which would enrich each scene. The basic plot and characters as well as their key characteristics were defined by him.’ This is contradicted somewhat by Salim Khan, who claims that they wrote the\n\nThis is contradicted somewhat by Salim Khan, who claims that they wrote the complete screenplay and even a bit of the dialogues, since you can hardly write a script without indicating how the characters will speak to advance the action. Nasir Husain would take their basic lines and polish them for better impact, sometimes during shooting. Mansoor Khan recalls, ‘My father would always write the final scenes himself, putting pen to paper. He used a particular brand of a 300-page notebook to write in. He would then dictate it to an assistant, who would transcribe it in Hindi and get the script pages photocopied for the actors and the shooting.’ A lot of the juice in the script did emerge from the brainstorming and bouncing of ideas. There is an apocryphal story that when searching for a suitably grand name for the villain, the two writers and the director heard someone in the Nasir Husain Films’ office call out the publicity in-charge’s name—‘Arre Shakhaal saab . . .’ And G.P. Shakhaal’s name became immortalized as the villain’s in not one but two Salim–Javed films! In Yaadon Ki Baaraat, a painter12 sees the killer Shaakaal (Ajit) fleeing from the scene of a murder. To prevent him from becoming a police witness, Shaakaal kills him and his wife but his three sons manage to escape without seeing the killer face. However, in the ensuing confusion, they get separated while boarding a train on the tracks next to their home. Shaakaal’s accomplice Jack (Satyen Kappu) is framed for the murder and jailed. The eldest brother, Shankar (Dharmendra), grows up to be a thief. The middle brother, Vijay (Vijay Arora), grows up to be a normal, fun-loving guy who is just out of college. The youngest, Ratan (Tariq), becomes a musician who plays under the alias, Monto, along with his band, Monto and His Avengers. Shankar is constantly on the lookout for Shaakaal but unwittingly works for him on heists. Vijay falls in love with Sonia (Zeenat Aman), a millionaire’s daughter. When Shankar finally gets through to Jack, he learns that Shaakaal’s unique feature is his differently sized feet, because of which he wears a size-8 shoe on one foot and a size-9 shoe on the other. In a triple-barrelled pre-climax development, Shankar kidnaps Sonia to force her father to part with priceless antique jewellery. He also realizes that Shaakaal, whom he has been working for all this while, is his parents’ killer. And the three brothers discover each other when Ratan/Monto sings their family song. In the climax, the three brothers save Sonia, keep the jewellery from being smuggled\n\nclimax, the three brothers save Sonia, keep the jewellery from being smuggled and kill Shaakaal on the same railway track that once separated them. For a film like Yaadon Ki Baaraat, where the story hurtles through on pure adrenaline, a mere plot description does not sufficiently reflect the impact of the film. Lost-and-found sagas depend on how well the gears mesh and how one scene brings about the next. Director Sriram Raghavan says, ‘I was a kid then and I got a complete narration of Yaadon Ki Baaraat from my mom. We weren’t allowed too many movies then. But my parents had just seen the movie. I asked her to at least tell me the story. And she did—scene by scene! How the boys separated, how their paths crossed often but they kept missing the chance to realize they were brothers, and how they ultimately met and how the villain got his foot stuck in the railway tracks and was run down by a train. I was a kid, but I too could see the whole film in my head.’ This lost-and-found template reached its pinnacle in Amar Akbar Anthony, which had many of the distinctive features that Salim–Javed fine-tuned in Yaadon Ki Baaraat, Haath Ki Safai and Chacha Bhatija, lost-and-found films written over a span of four years. All these films had: – Dramatic separation, usually during a family crisis—connected by unique memento – Multiple meetings of family members as adults, without knowing each other – Fortuitous reunion, just in time for the climax\n\nIf you think about it, these elements have found repeated usage in such films. Yaadon Ki Baaraat is one of the best in this genre with typical Salim–Javed twists added into the age-old formula. For example, the ‘memento’, which connects the family, is a song instead of something physical like a locket, letter or tattoo. A song known to only three people in the world is a very cool concept and presents a more dramatic opportunity of reconnecting the brothers than a physical memento. Incidentally, there is a prevalent belief among Hindi film fans that Ratan, the youngest brother (played by a very young Aamir Khan), asks for the song to be completed because he went to the loo during the antara (Badle na apna yeh aalam kabhi, jeevan mein bichhdenge na hum kabhi . . .) and didn’t hear the full song. Actually, this is not true because Ratan returns in time for the repeat of the antara. Also, as a family song, it would have been sung several times and hence it is unlikely that one brother would not know the complete song.

Shankar, Vijay and Ratan meet several times in the film—unwittingly embracing, praising and helping each other without knowing their relationship.

What is interesting in the promotion material of Yaadon Ki Baaraat is Salim– Javed’s increasing prominence. This was only their second film with exclusive credit but with Zanjeer, they had made a strong statement by staking a claim to the success of their previous three films as well. Before the release of Yaadon Ki Baaraat, they got third billing on the posters—after the music director (R.D. Burman) and the lyricist (Majrooh Sultanpuri), both of whom were huge stars. Indeed the biggest draw of this film—as with all Nasir Husain productions—was the fantastic music. But by the time the film released, Salim–Javed had overtaken Majrooh and were placed right after RD in the credits. This is probably indicative of their respective contributions to the film’s success. This is interesting because it was quite uncommon to give certain members of a film’s crew greater prominence as the promotions progressed. The reviews of Yaadon Ki Baaraat were not gushing. Screen called it a ‘crime thriller of familiar sort’ and went on to say ‘its main handicap is the close resemblance . . . to the current hit Zanjeer in the matter of story idea and development which in any case have their debt to foreign sources’.
