        "text": "Gruppo UNA, the new signature of the Italian hospitality, announces important news in the MICE sector with the aim of achieving a noticeable growth in the segment, which in 2018 accounted 22% of total turnover. Among the initiatives put in place for 2019 stand out the launch of the new section of the website dedicated to the meeting industry, to the expansion of the team and a new Booking Office for the Milan and Varese areas.\n\nThe key concept is to put the client at the heart of the activities, improving perceived quality and making communication more useful and targeted.\n\nThe creation of an entire section of the website dedicated to meeting and events goes along this initiative, with which Gruppo UNA wants to propose itself as a responsive and proactive reality vis-a-vis the needs of the sales partners.\n\nAmong the news, the website gives the possibility to consult the complete offer of facilities and meeting rooms, to filter by roomâ€™s capacity and type of event, to download the dedicated product sheets complete with planimetry and technical characteristics- and to ask for an online quote filling the dedicated form.\n\nTo support this development project, Nicola Accurso - Head of Sales and Marketing, Brand, Communication, Revenue and Distribution - has recently strengthen the team with the entry of Claudia Vanni in the role of MICE International Sales Director: thanks to the deep knowledge of the sector, gained over the course of her twenty years experience in the hospitality field, Claudia will handle the management of the international world with the aim of further increasing the segment.\n\nWith the objective to make the response of Gruppo UNA even more effective and well-timed in a strategic area like Milan one, the new MICE Milan office, based at UNAHOTELS Expo Fiera Milano, wants to propose itself as a lean and agile model in the offers management for the MICE segment.\n\nThe base for the growth strategy for 2019, is an extremely wide offer, attested by the numbers of Gruppo UNA: 18.500 square metres of meeting and conference rooms, perfectly equipped in 18 destinations, 177 spaces for events, 4.500 rooms in 31 hotels and resorts specialized in MICE and 11 private villas for exclusive and original parties are the solid basis that made the segment successful in 2018 and that will contribute to achieving the new goals."
