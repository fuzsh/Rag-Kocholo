All this information is included in this Privacy Policy.\n\nIn addition, you may always be entitled to obtain from SARTORIA VANNI: a) updating, correction and integration of your personal data; b) cancellation, transformation into an anonymous form or the blocking of your personal data if processed in violation of the law, including the data deemed unnecessary for the purposes for which the data was collected or subsequently processed in the first place; c) certification that the operations described at letters a) and b) have been notified, even with regard to their contents, to the persons to whom your data has been communicated or disseminated, except in those instances where such certification turns out to be impossible or would require a clearly disproportionate deployment of means compared to the right protected.\n\nYou do, in any case, have the right to totally or partially oppose: a) processing of your personal data, for valid reasons, even if pertinent to the purpose of collection; b) the processing of your personal data for the purposes of advertisement or direct marketing mailings, or if used for the purposes of market surveys or commercial communications.\n\nYou may freely exercise your rights at any time by sending a written request to SARTORIA VANNI – to the mailing address or to the e-mail address info@sartoriavanni.com\n\nTo ensure that your personal data is always exact, up to date, pertinent and complete, please advise us of any variations by writing to info@sartoriavanni.com\n\nWe wish to inform you that the law regulating protection of personal data (Art. 130, paragraph 4, Legislative Decree 196/2003) permits SARTORIA VANNI – without any obligation to obtain your prior consent – to use your data for direct selling activities involving products similar to those you have already purchased, unless you refuse to allow such use of the e-mail address you communicate to us.\n\nItalian Privacy Authority Provision on simplification of requirements for processing operations for administrative or accounting purposes\n\nWe also wish to inform you that the Italian Privacy Authority's provision of 19 June 2008 permits SARTORIA VANNI to use your postal address for sending you - with administrative and accounting documents - adverts about products similar to those you have already purchased, unless you refuse to allow such use of the postal address you communicate to us.\n\n______________\n\nAll of the above constitute the minimum information that SARTORIA VANNI is obliged to provide you with: for any further information about processing of your personal data by SARTORIA VANNI, we invite you to read this entire Privacy Policy.\n\nHow and why we process your personal data\n\nPersonal data processing is conducted primarily by means of information systems and electronic devices by SARTORIA VANNI and other parties who, selected with care for their reliability and competence, conduct operations that are essential in order to achieve the purposes strictly related to the use of the website, its services and sale of products via the website (see below, ‘Parties who may process your personal data’).\n\nThe specific purposes for which your personal data is processed are summarized each time you communicate your personal data, in the notice presented in compliance with art. 13 of Legislative Decree 196/2003. In general, data is processed in order to provide the following services available to those who visit our site: 1. registration on the site, to enjoy the services we offer; 2 . subscription to additional specific services, such as our SARTORIA VANNINEWS newsletter, and other similar information bulletins about our activities, the creation of your wish list and sharing its content, inviting your friends to join the SARTORIA VANNI world; 3. payments, including anti-fraud checks for credit card payments; 4. handling of your requests: be they technical, commercial, concerning progress reports on your orders and generally speaking all information requests; 5. contacting the managers of our services; 6. evaluating requests on your behalf to be included in our personnel by submitting your CV.\n\nIn processing personal data that may, directly or indirectly, identify you, we aim to abide by the principle of strict necessity.\n\nIn some cases, as expressly cited in the notice, your personal data will be processed, if you expressly grant your consent, to create a user profile based on your preferences and your purchases, so that we can send you information that is pertinent to your needs and interests. With the exception of the case specified at art. 130, paragraph 4, of Legislative Decree 196/2003 (authorising the data controller to use your data to send you advertising e-mails about products and services similar to those you have already purchased, unless you refuse your consent for such use), SARTORIA VANNI may use your personal data to send you advertising about its products and services only if you grant your consent.\n\nYour personal data will be communicated to third parties only with your express consent, except for the cases when such communication is obligatory by law or is required for purposes envisaged by the law, for which the person’s consent is not required.\n\nSome of the services provided through our site also include diffusion of your personal data to other registered users.\n\nAny other type of processing, other than related to the specific purpose for which you have communicated your personal data will be indicated in the information notice and will be carried out by SARTORIA VANNI only if you have expressly granted your consent (this is the case, for example, when a customer profile is created based on your preferences and buying habits).\n\nThere are, however, instances of data processing for which the law established that your consent is not required: for example, we wish to inform you that SARTORIA VANNI can process your personal data without your consent if this is necessary to comply with the provisions of the law or whenever this is necessary to fulfil the contractual obligations it may have entered into with you (for example, when you have bought products or have requested specific services through our website).\n\nFinally, we wish to inform you that your personal data will not be transferred abroad to countries that do not belong to the European Union that do not provide a sufficient level of privacy protection. If such a transfer should be necessary to provide you with the services or to conclude a contract with SARTORIA VANNI for purchasing our products, we wish to assure you that your personal data will not be transferred to countries that do not belong to the European Union and do not provide a sufficient level of privacy protection unless specific agreements are concluded by SARTORIA VANNI with such parties, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.\n\nIt could happen that SARTORIA VANNI may find itself processing personal data of third parties, communicated directly to SARTORIA VANNI by its own users, such as when a user has bought a product to be delivered to a friend, or when the person who pays for a product is different from the addressee, or again, when a user wishes to inform a friend about a service or the sale of a specific product on SARTORIA VANNI.COM.\n\nIn these circumstances, SARTORIA VANNI will deliver the notice pursuant to art. 13 of Legislative Decree 196/2003 to the third party, when the personal data of the same is registered in its archives, it is however your own responsibility to obtain consent from this person before communicating his/her personal data to SARTORIA VANNI and to inform him/her about this Privacy Policy, because you will be the sole person responsible for communication of information and data about third parties without them having granted their consent or in the event that such data be used in an illicit or improper way.\n\nWe wish to inform you that the consent of these persons is not required when their data is communicated to SARTORIA VANNI in order to conclude a contract with SARTORIA VANNI in their favour.\n\nSARTORIA VANNI reserves the right to eliminate MY SARTORIA accounts and all related data if illicit contents is discovered that is harmful to the image of SARTORIA VANNI and/or its products or those of third parties or, in any case, may be considered offensive, may be seen to promote illegal or libellous activities, includes pornographic material, incite to violence, or promote discrimination based on race, gender, religion or sexual preferences.\n\nParties who may process your personal data\n\nSARTORIA VANNI has chosen to call on other companies for processing your personal data, for certain specific activities. The companies that conduct such operations have been carefully selected and are experienced, capable and trustworthy, and offer sufficient guarantees that they abide by the applicable laws and regulations that regulate data processing, including the security profile of such data.\n\nThese companies have therefore been appointed data supervisors, and they conduct their activities according to the instructions and under the control of SARTORIA VANNI. We verify on a regular basis that they have fulfilled the duties assigned to them and that they continue to offer sufficient guarantees of compliance with the provisions that govern the protection of personal data.\n\nOur employees assigned to specific services also process your personal data; the categories of employees involved in these activities depend on the purposes for which the data was communicated and are always specified in the notice displayed when you communicate your personal data.\n\nSecurity measures\n\nWe adopt security measures that are sufficient to reduce the risks of destruction or loss of data – even if accidental – to a minimum, to impede unauthorized access, illicit types of processing and processing that is not in accordance with the purposes of collection as indicated in our Privacy Policy.\n\nHowever, SARTORIA VANNI cannot guarantee its users that the security measures adopted to protect the site, data transmission and information on the site, limit or exclude any risk whatsoever of unauthorized access or dispersion of data via user devices: we advise you to ensure that your computer is equipped with appropriate software to protect data transmission on the network, both incoming and outgoing (such as up to date antivirus systems) and that your Internet service provider has also adopted adequate security measures to protect network data transmission (such as a firewall and antispamming filters).\n\nDeep links to other websites\n\nOur site includes deep links to other websites that may have no relation to us.\n\nSARTORIA VANNI does not control or monitor such websites or their contents. SARTORIA VANNI may not be held responsible for the contents of such sites and the rules they apply, even with regard to your privacy and processing of your personal data during your navigation on their pages.
