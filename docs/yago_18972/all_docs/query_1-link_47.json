Nothing surprising. I’ll tell you why.\n\nSee, the judic!ary and media think that everything is black and white. If a boy and girl are 18 and above, then they should be treated as adults. Adults are given lots of freedom in India. So freedom to live in a house alone or with a fellow room-mate sucha as family-member/girlfriend/boyfriend/wife/husband, etc is also given.\n\nNow, these judic!ary and media people don’t think of culture at all. They only care for black-&-white. If there was a rule allowing 12 year olds to get married, these people would have upheld even such a marriage.\n\nThey think from a low-level. They lack the understanding and context of higher-level-thinking, natural justice and dharma. They only know to check if something done is as per rules or not. Whether the rule itself violates the culture of the land is irrelevant to these people.\n\nChoti Soch (Small thinking) leads to Big Consequences. Desh-Drohis misuse these low-cerebral-people by placing them in high and responsible positions such as juges and media-chiefs.\n\nThen these useful-idiots go on and on ———- “According to Article123, Rule456, 18 year old boy and girl have freedom granted by Constitut!on of India to Adults who are Indian Nationals. By that logic and past judgement ruled in Case.No.188636 (Chotu vs Union-of-India, 1967), it is hereby declared that this Live-In relationship is legal in the eyes of the law. Any further interference by parents of either defendant shall be prosecuted as contempt of court.”\n\nThis is why Captain wrote/writes so much about Critical-Thinking, Clear-Thinking, Understanding-Culture and Natural-Justice.\n\nThis is why Captain calls these people “Bottom of the Cerebral Barrel”. These people only follow Black-&-White rules. They don’t understand/appreciate/safeguard the various cultural nuances of the Nation. That’s why they are called “Useful Idiots” by Captain.\n\nDelete\n\nReply\n\nPratikJune 1, 2018 at 7:32 PM\n\ncaptain, who actually made crop circles ?\n\nReplyDelete\n\nReplies\n\nCapt.

In March 1923, days before his third stroke, Lenin asked Trotsky to denounce Stalin and his so-called “Great-Russian nationalistic campaign” at the XIIth Party Congress.\n\nJEW Stalin ( Rothschild blood and groomed in Baku ) wielded more power with Rothschild —Stalin did not like Trotsky.\n\nIn October 1927, Trotsky was expelled from the Central Committee—see Rothschild blood is thicker than water\n\nIn February 1929, Trotsky was deported from the Soviet Union to Turkey. On 20 August 1940, in his study, Trotsky was attacked by Ramón Mercader an assassin sent by Stalin ( ice axe as a weapon)—Trotsky with an injured head ,fought back, broke the assassins arm and his guards killed the assassin. Trotsky died the next day, knowing who sent the assassin.\n\nTrotsky’s last words were “I will not survive this attack. Stalin has finally accomplished the task he attempted unsuccessfully before.”\n\nJEW Trotsky was one of the seven members of the first Politburo, founded in 1917 to manage the Bolshevik Revolution. In reality he was the prime force. Stalin expelled Trotsky from the Communist Party in November 1927.\n\nTHE NEOCONS IN AMERICA TODAY ARE FOLLOWERS OF TROTSKY DOCTRINE\n\nhttp://ajitvadakayil.blogspot.in/2015/04/lawrence-of-arabia-part-two-capt-ajit.html\n\nKARL MARX AND JON DEWEY PLANNED THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION IN ADVANCE..\n\nBOTH DEWEY AND MARX APPROACHED THE COMMIE REVOLUTION FROM OPPOSITE ANGLES—MARX FROM OUTSIDE TO INWARDS AND DEWEY FROM INSIDE TO OUTWARDS ..THERE WAS NO SCOPE FOR FAILURE..\n\nJOHN DEWEY WAS 41 YEARS YOUGER THAN MARX— AND WAS FAR SMARTER..\n\nMarx worked to achieve a political revolution originating from an oppressed group outside the state while Dewey advanced a reformist agenda of state-led political meliorism.\n\nhttp://ajitvadakayil.blogspot.in/2013/07/exhuming-dirty-secrets-of-holodomor.html\n\nDewey’s visited Soviet Russia a decade after the Bolshevik revolution to advise Stalin who was NOT a thinker..\n\nhttp://ajitvadakayil.blogspot.in/2018/05/discretion-subjective-objective-value.html\n\nRothschild’s agents Indian commies MN Roy and Abani Mukherji were tutored in Mexico by Rothschild’ man JEW John Dewey. This bong due then founded Indian Communism.\n\nJew Rothschild arranged JEWESS honey pots for both these desh drohi Bongs. MN Roy had white JEWESS Evelyn Trent while Abani Mukherji had white JEWESS Rosa Fitingov..\n\nJohn Dewey used MN Roy and Abani Mukherji to set up El Pueblo, the Socialist Party in Dec 1917 , ( after the Russian Tzar and family were murdered ) which was converted into the Communist Party of Mexico in 1919, the first Communist Party outside Russia.\n\nGETTING BACK—\n\nJOHN DEWEY PROVIDED THE CEREBRAL PUSH FOR THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION..\n\nJEW LENIN WAS JUST A EVIL MURDERER..\n\nJEW Lenin served as head of government of Soviet Russia from 1917 to 1924 and of the Soviet Union from 1922 to 1924.\n\nTHE INDIAN COMMIES MUST KNOW THAT RUSSIAN REVOLUTIN TOOK THE LIVES OF 16.2 MILLION RUSSIANS…\n\nPOOR INDIAN COMMIES – THEIR LAL LANGOTS ARE TWISTED FOREVER IN A KNOT – AT THE TRIVENI OF BOURGEOUS, PROLETARIAT AND COMMON MINIMUM PROGRAM..\n\nTHROW A CHAPPATI IN THE GENERAL DIRECTION OF THE GULLIBLE AND NAÏVE COMMIES.\n\nCapt ajit vadakayil\n\n..\n\nReplyDelete\n\nCapt.

Then they cry that people are sitting home unemployed. Bunch of backward idiots running the state.\n\n—> Some how i feel i foul play by many activists as well who wants India always to be a import driven economy.\n\n—> Good decision. But the govt has to get jobs for the 50,000/- people who will be unemployed now.\n\n—> ok, Vedanta will close and shift. What about unemployment after closing the plant? Vedanta has history of opening running and closing.\n\n—> Population and pollution hand in hand. The closure of the plant out of political consideration shall render thoussnds of employees jobless which shall worsen already deteriorated law and order situation. The country has 130 crores mouths to feed. The country can not afford closures in the name of pollution . Reduce population or face pollution.But no political or social leader has moral courage to speak the truth.\n\n—> Closure is not the solution. What about determining the actual environment impact of the plant and its redressal??..Giving in to popular demand is a myopic approach to a problem which had to handled more deftly.\n\n—> Was the government of Tamil Nadu and the State pollution control board waiting for the unfortunate death of 13 people, for closing down the plant?? If pollution is the real issue, why the pollution control board was keeping quiet all these years.\n\n—> Please forcefully collect all money ‘taken’ by TN political leaders from Sterlite and distribute it among the households who have lost their livelyhood due to closure of Sterlite.\n\n—> Instead of closing the plant and disemploying so many employees, can we not enforce Vedanta to implement preventive measures so as to solve the problems, which have caused so much unrest ? Please put a heavy penalty on Vedanta for creating this much nuisance.\n\n—> Check the money flow behind the protests. Quite often it is by the outside countries who will benefit from such closures. Ask the company to put in better polution control means and restart the plant.\n\n—> This gives goons a new weapon to extort money from Industries. How do we allow Governments to arbitrarily take such decisions?\n\nUNQUOTE=============================\n\nIf India’s Central and State Governments behave in this manner, then nobody will be willing to setup industries in India saying that India is unstable nation for investments……….losing investor confidence by such myopic tactics are a sh0t in the foot………………high population & high unemployment are a big big b0mb waiting to burst…………..\n\nReplyDelete\n\nReplies\n\nSangeethaMay 29, 2018 at 2:20 AM\n\nwhat was 50000 people doing when their jobs were being threatened ? This is the problem with Indian psyche now. Gandhi’s nonviolence is so much imbibed in our mind that we don’t even protest verbally.\n\nNow at least the 50000 people and all others like shop keepers whose livelihood also impacted should come out and show strength\n\nDelete\n\nrajusundarMay 29, 2018 at 1:06 PM\n\nonly if you know the extend of nefarious activities carried out by foreign forces you can understand gravity of the situation. all this is part of a well drawn planning done decades ago.\n\nThe coast sand dunes of Kerala are enriched with minerals viz. ilmenite, rutile, zircon, monazite, leucoxene (brown ilmenite), sillimanite and garnet. The state government decided to lease out\n\nstate owned land (in kollam & alappuzha districts) to Kerala Rare Earths and Minerals Limited (KREML), a joint sector company, to conduct mineral sand mining.\n\nthat the sand contains valuable minerals was known to germans who used to export coir from these areas to europe before independence. the traces of sand in coir made them do research and detected that radio-active minerals are present.\n\nsince then missionary activities were rampant in the southern coastal belt of kerala. the consequence of which was an entire community enmasse converted to christianity. people tend to respect church law more than rule of law.\n\nnow the church is in a position to hold any democratically elected government to ransom in the name of pollution due to high radioactivity in these areas. the sand mining mafias operating in these areas is against any government control over the sand and has been at loggerheads with any governmental agency carrying out mining there. there is an unwritten law in these areas that so much percentage of jobs in any pollutant industries located in coast is reserved to people coming from these areas in the name of job loss (traditional fishing), land rights and pollution. the respective state govt in kerala has always been very cordial with these groups who are very vocal about their demands (that they held communist strongmen CM of kerala hostage over cyclone okchi recently) and hence issues are resolved. no government can approach the people other than through the church who always will be intermediary/beneficiary in any talks.\n\nsimilarity can be drawn to tuticorin protests where almost similar pattern exists. so, what is really the problem over there?? is it pollution, jobs or land encroachment. Hell No!! the state has dealt very strongly with protest thereby inviting wrath of church. and about jobs?? time to harvest"
