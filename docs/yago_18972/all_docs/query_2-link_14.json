Luckily, Spain offers a lot of great spaces to choose from. However, the choice of venue depends on the objective of the event, the target audience, the message you want to convey, and the change in behavior you want to achieve at the end of the attendee journey. For instance, if you want to align your employees around innovation and the future, choosing a typical, classical, or not renovated space would not be credible, right? I am not into promoting spaces, but this hotel ticks all the boxes, and offers indulgent quality and a great customer journey making it an excellent choice for MICE events and special meetings. An image speaks a thousand words, so click on the button and enjoy this video to see for yourself üëáand, if you are in need to organize a meeting or event with surprise factor, do not hesitate to contact me. #corporatevents #eventswithpurpose #eventstrategy #eventdesign #eventmanagement #eventvenues #Spain #Ibiza #miceevents\n\nEveryone that knows me knows that I love my sports. According to STR, it really was the sporting events that drove hospitality demand this year across the world and not concerts like everyone thought.

IDeaS Revenue Solutions published a great playbook helping hotels take advantage of upcoming major events. ‚û°Ô∏è https://lnkd.in/gPFzxAiW #RevenueManagement #HotelManagement #Hospitality\n\nCan‚Äôt make it to #france for the #ParisOlympics2024?
