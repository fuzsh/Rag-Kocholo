He's moved from pretty boy romantic hero to do movies like Nalla Damayanthi.Comedy is hard to do, and Madhavan did a good job. I also thought his performance in Ayutha Ezhuthu was exceptional.

Bollywood has its talking camels and Tamil cinema has its typewriting snake (this line is dedicated to my friend, Prabhu Ram). See the link I provided above and you'll see what I mean.\n\nI will not agree that Bollywood has started making better films. Among the films mentioned by Hindustani ladka, except lagaan which was a novel attempt & lakshaya, the others are pretty ordinary films. They cannot be termed great.\n\nMumbai express definitely cannot be termed terrible (when U can call vaada great).\n\nEven if U argue that bollywood films are technically superior, the point to be noted is that the technicians are all from the south. Also, films by priyadarshan are all remakes of his mallu hits.\n\nRam gopal verma goes in for rehash of hollywood flicks - egs are road, kaun etc., etc.,\n\nTamil movies too have a share of good & bad films.\n\nSo, U cannot conclude that bollywood films are better.\n\nOriginally Posted by HindustaniLadka\n\nBollywood by far.

Saw the thread, but not much of\n\nreal interesting feedback there. Agree with your comments of\n\nMadhavan and Tamil cinema makers btw.\n\ninteresting discussion ...\n\ni think it's a comparison which needs to be looked at from several angles - one thing's for sure - as far the \"mass appeal\" films are concerned (the kind of films that play purely to the galleries and are quite simply, shots at box office glory) there's not much of a difference between hindi and tamil films. i mean, bombay has its shah rukh khans, karan johars and david dhawans, just as madras has its vijays, ajiths and k.s.ravikumars. no offence meant to these guys ... its just that they tend to look at movie-making as a business rather than as an art.\n\nbut when it comes to the really good films - the kind of thematic filmmaking which people like govind nihalani, mani ratnam etc. have come to be know for, i think tamil films have a slight edge, as of now. in spite of ramgopal varma, farhan akhtar et al, the general standard of hindi cinema is still quite deplorable. but it's a trend that's beginning to change, as more and more hindi filmmakers are turning towards serious subjects, with honest efforts to make films of substance.\n\nNot true\n\nOriginally Posted by HindustaniLadka\n\nBollywood by far.

Not AP.\n\nOriginally Posted by Girish11\n\nSorry for not clarifying well Ms.Chennai, I did not mention\n\nin the title Malayalam movies (do they also have short term...\n\nMollywood?, not sure) but in the very first post in my thread,\n\nyou can see, I did compare Bolloywood with both Tamil and\n\nMalayalam movies\n\nThanks for clarifying the thread! Ok, if you bring Mallu movies into the picture then I would say Mallu films are ahead of Bollywood in terms of realism & preserving their nativity. I used to be an avid follower of Mallu movies in the 80's especially whern Mohanlal, Mamooty & Shobana in their peak! The thing that gauges well for Mallu movies is that they never compromise on their nativity. Thankfully hero worship/violence is something that never became a trend in Mallu films. But now I lost touch with Mallu films. So, Im going to conveniently take Mallu movies out of the equation.\n\nI think in 60s, 70s and 80s the quality of Tamil movies was as good as Hindi movies if not better.\n\nAfter the 90s, when u strictly compare Tamil vs. Hindi movies then Hindi movies has the edge over the Tamil movies. Lets just compare an average Tamil movie vs. average Hindi movie. No doubt both movies are clichéd but they are clichéd in their own ways. To me, personally, the way our (Tamil) movies are clichéd irks me a lot than the way Hindi movies are clichéd. One thing that I dont like about Bollywood is they try to imitate the western movies by having glossy & glamorous portrayal of their characters and hence tend to loose the nativity of our own culture. But I can take that better than our Tamil movies where we portray a film which is too far-fetched from reality. Being unrelalistic is okay because it's after all cinema but making it \"crudely\" unrealistic is what I dislike more about our \"average\" Tamil movies. At least Hindi movies doesnt have the clichéd ness of Tamil movies which is abundant with too much of hero worship crap, heroes hijacking films for their personal image building exercise, crass/crude comedy tracks and loud dialogues. In terms of technical aspects of film making, Kollywood are almost at the same level as Bollywood.\n\nGood movies pop up here and there in both Hindi & Tamil (Teen Deewarein, Black, Autograph, Kaadhal). But I thought when the movies in Hindi are good they are really good. Im not sure whether there are not that much amount of art movies production in Hindi these days. Those days Hindi cinema had art film gurus like Sathrughan Sinha, Amol Palekar, Naseeruddin Shah & Om Puri! I know for sure that Tamil movies barely had the concept of parallel cinema at all. Neither does Tamil cinema that has gurus like K.Balachander, Bharathi Raja who gave some high quality movies in the 70s & 80s!\n\nI think both Hindi and Tamil movies are awesome. Of course, each one has its own pros and cons. Don't waana stereotype, but if Hindi movies can move out of that Punjabi wedding backgrounds and focus on more realistic movies like Company, Fiza, or Yuva, it would be good. But love stories have more glitz and glamor, so no complaints.\n\nTamil movies are better contentwise, but since the market is not that big as Hindi, production costs are low, and hence the movies don't carry that much glitz and glamor. But they really have great talents. If only all Tamils knew to speak Hindi, they all will conquer Bollywood in no time, with the enormous potential.....\n\nBut as an Indian in America, I'm proud of both industries...\n\nBollywood owns Kolly man:\n\nBollywood\n\nPluses:\n\nActing\n\nActors\n\nStory-Black especially\n\nCinematography, foreign locations, foreign fame, Choreography!\n\nMusic\n\nCons:\n\nSkin Shows\n\nRepetive plot themes\n\nKollywood:\n\nPluses:\n\nActing-(sometimes)\n\nActors-(lopsided)\n\nStory-(not rural based)\n\nMusic-(props to YSR and IR esp.)\n\nCons:\n\nDance steps-(village like)\n\nKuthu style\n\nadi-thadi\n\nslapstick comedy\n\nRip-off matrix tricks\n\nFolk dances-(nee enda oore-Thirupachi auugh!)\n\nHollywood copies-(certain movies)\n\nEnglish titles oppostion-(CORRUPT SYSTEM, NORTH INDIA AND USA RULES HA HA!)\n\nSo who wins, I think Bollywood, no title problems and I think Ajith, Maddy and Kamal have a great market there, the southies, ugh to village like, satyaraj especially!\n\ni feel that kollywood / south movies focuses more on story value rather than glamour as compared to bollywood. i would't say that kollywood do not have glamour, it does bt not as focused as bollywood. bollywood concentrates on beautiful heroins ( must be slim,fair etc) but look at the kollywood for instance, we still accept people like vijaykant,murali,bhagyaraj,cheran ( autograph) as our heroes but u dont see such ppl in bollywood as heroes do u!we look for quality and appreciate a person's talent no matter how he looks or even if he is not a hearthrob!\n\nn in no manner we can downgrade the movies produced by kolywood, we have so many good movies, the list would just go on!\n\nOriginally Posted by Raghu\n\n1) living legends like Super *, Dr.SPB, Dr.KJY, Dr.IR, ARR,Kamalhasan, Mamooty, Mohan Lal, Maniratnam,...etc\n\nI would like to add\n\nDirectors like Balachandar, Balu Mahendra, Faazil, Priyadarshan and\n\nActors/ Actresses like Sivaji, MGR, Gemini, Saavithri, Padmini, Sri Devi, Manoramma, Naagesh, Thangavelu, Vivek, Revathi, Naazar,\n\nMD- Vishvanaathan- Raamamoorthy,\n\nSingers-- P.

Further, I am sure you should\n\nbe knowing nothing about malayalam movies either or seen any.\n\nI am open to sincere criticizm and comparison, as you can\n\nsee, I am the one who started this thread and I have mentioned\n\nthat Bollywood movies have improved more during the last\n\ncouple of years compared to Kollywood movies, but this, what you are doing is by\n\nno means fair, please avoid such things. The simple fact\n\nthat you mentioned that Kamal is from AP shows how much\n\nyou know about Tamil movies. Please..........\n\nBollywood par with Hollywood??? One movie like Black does\n\nnot prove it, before saying such a thing, please be reasonable,\n\nwe all know hardly 10% of Bollywood movies are worth anything\n\nat all. You probably would say Kisna is one such movie in par\n\nwith Hollywood, I will not be surprised if you say that since you\n\nhave already praised so much about Kisna. In my opinion\n\nKisna would come under negative ratings, not even zero.\n\nIf anyone in participating here has seen Kisna, please give your\n\nhonest opinion about it.\n\nRe talents from all parts of India, I did specify that Bollowood\n\ndont give the deserved recognition to South Indian actors\n\n(Madrasi actors, in your language) and I did mention that the\n\nactresses do get the chances to add to the glamour. Your list\n\nmentions just 2 actors, Sunil Shetty and Kamal, Sunil Shetty,\n\nmany dont even know that he is a south Indian, he has got\n\nthe breaks being born and brought up in North, I dont even know\n\nif he can speak his mother tounge. Re Kamal, do you mean\n\nto say he got the breaks, recognition he deserved? If so,\n\npeople like Sunny deol could never have got a chance to act\n\nin so many movies compared to Kamal, mind you, I am making\n\nthe comparison with one of the lousiest Hindi actors, whereas\n\nthe place Kamal would deserve would be much higher that\n\nmany top actors you would imagine.\n\nYou cited tha South actors are terrible looking and that is the\n\nreason for not getting chances in Bollywood. We are discussing\n\nabout movies here, about actors, about acting, not modelling\n\nprojects my friend. Looks should not matter, Nasserddin shah/Om Puri acclaimed as one of the best actors by all cricitcs is not good\n\nlooking, nor is Mithun Chakravarthy who once used to be second only to Amitabh, nor the actor of Ray who just got an oscar.\n\nDo you mean to say only the guys who have a good physique\n\nand remove their shirts every now and then in movies are\n\ngood actors???\n\nAbout Kisna I have already given my comments, regarding comparison between Kisna and ME, I would prefer the hubbers\n\nhere who have watched both the movies do it to make you\n\nunderstand better.\n\nGirish11,\n\nPls don't waste your time with Hindustanladkha..All he knows is India is North India and Indian cinema is Hindi cinema.\n\nYes, all i know about India is North India. That must be why i lived in Andhra Pradesh for 5 years right? And why i have never actually lived in Northern India right? It is also why my mother tongue is Telugu right?\n\nAnyway, i have seen 2 Tamil films, a lot of Telugu films, and some Bengali films. But, i have seen thousands of Hindi films. In reality, most people in India don't give a crap what side of India the actress or actor the are watching is from. We need to get over this North/South seperation. The main reason why there are not as many actors from the south in Bollywood is because most of them do not even bother trying to get into bollywood and they stick to their regional films.\n\nThe good actors that make an actual effort can easily get roles and if they are good, they can become stars. But, for example, if a terrible actor or an ugly looking guy trys to get a starring role, it will only lead to his demise in bollywood. For example, Madhavan tried to get into Hindi films by starring in some movie called Rehna Tera something...but anyway, the movie flopped and he was never seen in bollywood again because no one(people from the North/South alike) liked his acting and his looks. For the same reason, Chiranjeevi(who is popular in Telugu films for some odd reason) would never survive in bollywood by playing starring roles because he is very fat, idiotic look and terrible at acting.\n\nAs for Sunil Shetty, many people don't know that he is from the South because the last thing people think about is what side of India an actor they are watching is from. People know that Kamal Hasan is from TN because he goes around telling everyone that he is.\n\nAbout Kisna, how you look at the film depends on your own personal likings and opinions, so lets not bother argueing on how good the film was.\n\nI disagree with ladka here. Cine goers in the north just cannot tolerate any one south of the Vindhyas as heroes. Heroines are a different proposition.\n\nA classic example is kamal haasan. Actors wih much lesser talent are bigger stars there just b'cos they are from the north.\n\nRe: Not true\n\n[quote=\"HindustaniLadka\"][quote=\"Girish11\"]\n\nOriginally Posted by HindustaniLadka\n\nAs for the fact that many actors that are popular in south films never get into bollywood...most of the actors that are popular in the south are terrible. For example, Chiranjeevi, Mamooty, and Madhavan are neither good looking nor good at acting, but they are still popular. Some good actors from teh south that have gotten into bollywood are Sunil Shetty and Kamal Hasan.\n\nAlso, how is Kisna a terrible movie? It is has great acting, music, direction and quality. Mumbai Express is a joke. If anything was over hyped, it is definetly Mumbai Express. The acting is pathetic even though Kamal Haasan is in it.\n\nthis guy is talking absolute nonsense, mamooty is one of the greatest actor in india. he has won the national award 3 times. still this guy thinks that he is not a good actor. he is also not bad looking too. please dont talk about the things you dont know.\n\nYou see?\n\nOriginally Posted by HindustaniLadka\n\nYes, all i know about India is North India.

It surely does not,\n\nso why brag about Bollywood without knowing anything\n\nabout Tamil or Malayalam movies???\n\nRe Madhavan, you are mistaken my friend, people in North\n\nknow him even before people of South recognized him,\n\nMadhavan has acted in some hindi tv series before he started\n\nacting in Tamil movies and it was not some unpopular flop\n\nserial, in fact it was a popular comedy serial, Further, Madhavan\n\ndid act in hindi movies after Rehna Hai tere dil mein, please check your\n\nfacts.\n\nhindustanladka the so called knows nothing! he thinks Indian movies are Hindi only and only Bollywood! that itself shows how much he knws how to appreciate a good work or art!\n\nhe in no way is capable to judge! c'mmon man what the heck! u r looking at looks? what has ppl like Salman Khan with good looks knw? he can;t act, he is surviving only with his stupid looks and his body! he cant act!!!\n\nmadhavan is good looking what u mean not good looking! madhavan can act, mammoty cant act???? u must be dreaming mate? someone to say ,mammooty cant act and chiranjeevi can;t act.\n\nhey looks can be very deceiving! bollywood actors has got looks but they can't act as good as out South ppl, all that they go around showing is their face and glamour.\n\nOnce there was this award show in South and Amitha Bachan was the guest and u knw what he said? He said I still admire the quality and the technology the South Indian Cinema posses even the Bollywood does not have it!\n\nWhat do you mean by the South Indian films do not have quality and is worsening over the time? South Indian movies always had quality and is getting better and better, look at movies like Kuruthi Poonal, Autograph,Pithamagan? I dont think any Bollywood movie will survive by making movies like this without any glamour! SOuth people appreciates quality and talents and not just a bunch glamour people who cant even act...Salman Khan sucks, Vivek Oberoi-- what does he do, plays with his looks?,priyanka Chopra-- what is this \"pageant\" doing in the cineworld? Bipasha Basu? -- well i need not tell much about her acting....\n\nHindustan Ladka, do not judge our South Indian actress and actors, i guess by seeing merely 2 tamil movies and a dozen ot Telegu movies and some Malayalam movies you are not in a position to comment anything at all!\n\nyou have mentioned in ur list the movie dhoom? well didnt u see Kaaka Kaaka?! it had all the technology ( camera) involved, so well picturised.\n\nmate did you see Sethu, did u see how Vikram acted? he even got an award, the same thing in Hindi-- cant remember the name, Salman Khan was never near to Vikram's acting!\n\nReconsider ur thoughts!\n\nsouth films are not always including the styles and gimmicks of superstars. there are films with great story line and brilliant performances. when there is a chandramukhi there is an autograph also. when there is films like thirupachi, attahasam there is also films like pithamagan, kathal. there is commercial films as well as quality ones. there are brilliant directors like mani rathnam, bharatiraja, adoor gopalakrishnan... , there are great music directors like ar rahman, ilayaraja.. , there are superb actors like mamooty, mohanlal, kamal hasan, prakash raj, vikram, raghuvaran, there are legendary singers like sp balasubramanyam, kj yesudas..., and also actresses like revathi, shobhana, suhasini..\n\nsouth films have a lot of talents and they are making great films also. if somebody dont have the facility or time to see and appreciate those films, its not their fault. i will say that they are unlucky.\n\nOriginally Posted by HindustaniLadka\n\nAnyway, i have seen 2 Tamil films, a lot of Telugu films, and some Bengali films.

You must be kidding. First watch the movie Alaipayuthae and then watch Saathya. You will know what I am talking about.\n\nYou must be ashamed of yourself for not knowing where Kamal Haasan is from. He is one of the very few versatile actors India ever has owned.\n\nYou are saying Mamooty is not handsome. Can you figure out how old he is, you cannot.\n\nLets forget about handsome actors. I bet you don't know about Bagya Raj.\n\nMany of his tamil hits were remade into hindi movies and were hit as well. Antha yezhu naatkkal, Yenga Chinna Rasu and many more. Watch these movies and you will realize you have seen the same story in hindi, but you didn't know that its bagya Raj's movie. Bhagyaraj, the director, made a grand entry into Hindi films with \"Aakhri Raasta\", a remake of \"Kaidhiyin Diary\". And Amitabh Bachchan who did a dual role in the film, was in total awe of its director.\"Aakhri Raasta\" was a dizzying success.\n\nDon't be a \"kinaththu thavaLai\" ( Frog dwelling in a well).\n\nHi HL, long time no see Seem to be in the thick of things as usual. Folks actually Hl is not alone.He's is reflecting a very widely held opinion up here that South movies is all about fat ugly heroes dressed outrageously prancing with young (imported) girls. This is an undeniable phase which I'm not sure we have passed completely. Even the great screenwriter Bagyaraj is extremely garish and clumsy in his sonmg sequences. Of course nothing very exclusive about this. That's been the case in Hindi too.Jeetendra's white shoes are legends by themselves.\n\nHindi films are bigger that does NOT mean better. I have seen several films that ppl talk a LOT about just to be disappointed. let us make a screenplay comparison. Don't take front of the line films.( For a Mahanadhi they have a Maqbool). But take a low key film like Guru-Paarvai . Pretty ordinary but a relatively taut screenplay. If it had been in Hindi it would have been promoted like anything and people would be all over it. There was nothing extraordinary about Dhoom (compare with Gilli) but it is already on several people's all-time list. 8)\n\nBuddhadeb Dasgupta once interviewed Mani Ratnam\n\nBD: After so many years we just hear of one Mani Ratnam and\n\nKamal Hassan from Tamil Cinema. Why ?\n\nMR: If people haven't seen 'Udhiri Pookkal' and '16 Vayathinile' ,\n\nare we to blame.\n\nLet me make things clear to everyone, i do not live in Northern India and I am not from Northern India.\n\nAnyway, i just saw some Telugu movie called Gowri and it had better special effects and technological aspects than any Hindi films i had ever seen, but...the producer ruined the film by putting in a horrible storyline, hideous actors/actress(amazingly enough, they weren't fat), and by putting in terrible songs. Most regional films are like this, they have one good aspect, but then they kill it. I know there are many terrible Hindi films, but they are atleast taken well and they have good looking actors and actresses. My point is that regional films may have some great directors, actors, and music writers, but there is no point in taking a movie if you are only going to focus only on one aspect of it and ignore the other aspects of it. For example, the guy who made \"Gowri\" put in great special effects, but every other part of the movie sucked.\n\nALso, about how some people say talent from the south is ignored in bollywood. Notice how many talented people from the south like Ram Gopal Varma, Mani Ratnam, AR Rehman, Aishwarya Rai, Kamal Hasan, and many more are very well known and greatly respected in bollywood. I know there are more people from northern India in bollywood, but htat is only because northern states have much higher populations and many of the talented people from the south focus mainly on regional films instead of bollywood films.\n\nOriginally Posted by HL\n\ntalented people from the south focus mainly on regional films instead of bollywood films\n\nAnd why would that be a wrong ? Don't get me wrong it'd be lovely if Shyam Benegal did a Tamil film, but that's never going to happen. But nobody thinks that's his fault. On the other hand if a regional film-maker doesn't 'reach-out' than he's wasting his talent eh ?\n\nPeople know that Kamal Hasan is from TN because he goes around telling everyone that he is.\n\nSo ...... Is it to be pushed under the carpet ?\n\nMuch as I love Kamal his Hindi sounds extremely affected and that's a major reason he isn't going to make it ever (though this is NOT the only reason). Maddy's Hindi was natural in 'Rehna Hai Tere Dil Main'. I like Maddy and hope his Hindi version of 'Nala Damayanthi' works.\n\nHi HL\n\nOriginally Posted by HindustaniLadka\n\nLet me make things clear to everyone, i do not live in Northern India and I am not from Northern India.\n\nAnyway, i just saw some Telugu movie called Gowri and it had better special effects and technological aspects than any Hindi films i had ever seen, but...the producer ruined the film by putting in a horrible storyline, hideous actors/actress(amazingly enough, they weren't fat), and by putting in terrible songs.

It is very rAjA-esque. Dont let the blood rush to your head, not saying it is copied, just saying it sounds a lot like an orchestral technique rAjA in his prime would have used. To diss Masakkali is to diss rAjA himself in some ways.\n\nBut to label two excellent albums as pedestrian just to make your point is, to me, counter-productive.

For remote or local audience there are always local language movies and as Hindi's reach is huge they may not be considering on the very inner issues and concentrating mainly on business with reach to audience where they can do big business.\n\nOriginally Posted by Sanguine Sridhar\n\nCR,\n\nYour view on Viv's point? Mostly movies based Upper Middle class??\n\nFirst of all, i'm not a major Hindi movie buff. I watch a few movies which i think would be interesting. with the disclaimer out of the way, let me continue... i agree with Viv's point. They make movies mainly about urban characters. Of course the \"popular\" Bollywood la Software Coolie-a kooda CEO range ku dhaan kaattuvaanga.\n\nRoad-a kootra kadhaiya irundha kooda Australia, Thailand la dhaan shoot pannuvaanga. Ulladai modhakkondu designer wear than pottukkuvaanunga.\n\nStill, movies like Omkara, Welcome to Sajjanpur (pakkala, rural movie dhaan nu nenaikkaren) are made\n\nAnd even inside the mainstream, can one imagine a film like TZP in Tamil? How many, bearing a very few would go for it?\n\nUrban/rural ellam irundhaalum, tharam anga nammala vida nalla irukku. Thaan solla vandha kadhaya endha vidha compromise-um illama (mudinja varaikkum) solla anga dhairiyamum soozhalum irukku.\n\nSo the context or theme they pick would be a common theme, which a tamilian and a punjabi can relate to almost with equal ease.\n\nand they can sit back and cash on any theme, because, the viewer base is large, so distribution would be wider in many cities and metros, and easily the cost would be made good (even if they pick urban themes)\n\nnaama urban themes panna, tamils who love urban subject mattum thaan parpaanga. so namma directors thayaguvaanga.\n\nOriginally Posted by crajkumar_be\n\nOriginally Posted by directhit\n\nidha thaan innoru thread la kettein, ofcourse in a +ve way, indha B/C centre laam bollywood la ledhaa nu what kinda movies do they see?\n\nThe multiplex cover means movies made for niche audiences can be profitable. dhairiyama padangal edukkalaam.

DCH was not such a mass hit but still got to be extremely profitable. And their makkal are not excessively fussy about \"B/C\" la odutha, illiya kind of arguments and undue weightage given to B/C? Who cares as long as you rake in profits and the film reaches the target audience, considering its budget etc\n\nur rite - their multiplex audience since they cover a huger area is apparently big and plus overseas collections give em courage to take movies only believing them and its more like the so called B/C have improved their taste as a result of that. inga namma total market itself is small/adhula b-c nu pirichu kaathula parandhu naalu paatu oru intro kuthu paatu dhaan kekkaranganu mudhirai kuthitaanga\n\nOriginally Posted by Shakthiprabha\n\nSo the context or theme they pick would be a common theme, which a tamilian and a punjabi can relate to almost with equal ease.\n\nnever..I have never related myself to a hindi movie...\n\nThey are picking a theme where the multiplex audiences would be satisfied...\n\nSP akka am not sure on a tamilian/punjabi relating to their themes IMO its more on terms of they dont care on seperate centers/audience\n\nOriginally Posted by Shakthiprabha\n\nSo the context or theme they pick would be a common theme, which a tamilian and a punjabi can relate to almost with equal ease.\n\nOriginally Posted by Vivasaayi\n\nOriginally Posted by Shakthiprabha\n\nSo the context or theme they pick would be a common theme, which a tamilian and a punjabi can relate to almost with equal ease.\n\nnever..I have never related myself to a hindi movie...\n\nIf they pick a rural context, u would be further driven away from relating to it, leave alone understanding the dialect and the accent.\n\nOriginally Posted by Shakthiprabha\n\nand they can sit back and cash on any theme, because, the viewer base is large, so distribution would be wider in many cities and metros, and easily the cost would be made good (even if they pick urban themes)\n\nnaama urban themes panna, tamils who love urban subject mattum thaan parpaanga. so namma directors thayaguvaanga.\n\nI quote this again.\n\nAnoop,\n\nEven without taking a patronizing tone regarding B/C audience, one can safely say that there have been good films (subjective - legal document range ku clause poda vendirukku!) which have been appreciated by B/C also, here and elsewhere. Yet, andha madhiri oru soozhal-a sustain panradhilla. And its not that urban audience watch only good cinema or whatever A class audience watch is good cinema.
