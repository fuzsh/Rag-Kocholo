She began acting professionally when she was 10, with a brief appearance in Walls of Glass, with Geraldine Page and Olympia Dukakis. She was an advertising model both in commercials and in print, and at 16 she landed small parts in Francis Ford Coppola's New York Stories and Oliver Stone's Born on the Fourth of July.\n\nAt 19, she auditioned and interviewed for Picket Fences, but producer David E. Kelley told her, \"I don't think you're quite right. The character has a really big heart and I just don't think you fit the bill.\" Shocked, she retorted: \"Then why the hell are you looking in New York?\" He was startled, and she left in a huff, but he called back a few weeks later, and she played Tom Skerritt's defiant daughter Kimberly Brock on Picket Fences for four years.\n\nOn Charmed, she was originally instructed to wear a push-up bra, but rebelled and refused after a few episodes. She has six dogs, five rabbits, four horses, three lovebirds, two cats, three tattoos, and one son. The boy's father, her husband David Donoho, works behind the scenes in film and television, primarily as a key grip. Donoho also created sound effects for the John Waters film Polyester (1981).\n\nFormer vegetarian.\n\nMother: Lauralei Combs (musician, b. 1958)\n\nHusband: Bryan Travis Smith (actor, m. 1993, div. 1997)\n\nBoyfriend: Storm Lyndon (school teacher, dated and broken engagement, 2000-01)\n\nHusband: David W.
