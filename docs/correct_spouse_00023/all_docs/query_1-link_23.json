        "text": "Holly Marie Combs is living her dream as a mother and a wife despite facing some challenges along the way.\n\nThe actress, who rose to fame as one of the sisters in \"Charmed,\" was told by doctors that she could not have children due to a medical condition.\n\nShe proved them wrong and gave birth to three sons, who are now her pride and joy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHolly Marie Combs and her sons, Finley, Riley, and Kelley Donoho, at the \"The Boxtrolls\" premiere in Universal City, California, on September 21, 2014 | Source: Getty Images\n\nHolly Marie Combs, known for her role in 'Charmed,' is not just a talented actress but also a dedicated wife and mother of three. From her early days in acting to her current role as a cherished parent, Combs has navigated through the trials and triumphs of life, motherhood, and love.\n\nHolly Marie Combs, known for her role in the \"Charmed\" series, arrives at the 1999 \"Teen Choice Awards\" in Santa Monica | Source: Getty Images\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite doctors' warnings, she ventured into motherhood for the third time, and her story reflects the essence of embracing life's challenges. Combs' inspiring journey is marked by significant milestones, intriguing twists, and an ever-optimistic outlook on life.\n\nHolly Marie Combs in her role as Kimberly Brock in \"Picket Fences\" on August 16, 1995 | Source: Getty Images\n\nOvercoming Health Challenges\n\nOn her path to achieving her dream of motherhood, Combs had to overcome various obstacles. At 24, she faced a fibroid the size of a baseball, which led to surgery and raised questions about her ability to have children, but she welcomed two sons with Donoho.\n\nHolly Marie Combs and David W. Donoho at \"The Last Samurai\" Los Angeles premiere | Source: Getty Images\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter her second pregnancy, Combs faced another obstacle in the form of a postpartum health issue that runs in her family. She was diagnosed with postpartum thyroiditis, a condition where the immune system attacks the thyroid gland, leading to various symptoms, including fatigue, hair loss, and more.\n\nHolly Marie Combs at the 2019 Wizard World Comic Con in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania | Source: Getty Images\n\nInitially, she mistook it for postpartum depression due to her feelings of exhaustion and being run down. Even her doctors warned against the prospect of having more children, mindful of the health hurdles she had already overcome. But, against all odds, her desire to expand her family remained resolute.\n\nHolly Marie Combs and David Donoho photographed in Los Angeles, California on May 11, 2004 | Source: Getty Images\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBalancing Career and Motherhood\n\nIn a candid interview with CBB back in 2008, Combs opened up about the challenges of balancing her career and motherhood. At the time, she was in Vancouver shooting a pilot for \"Mistresses,\" a project that took her away from her two sons, Finley and Riley, for an extended period.\n\nHolly Marie Combs and her sons, Kelley, Finley, and Riley Donoho, at the \"Titans of the Ice Age\" premiere in Los Angeles, California, on June 20, 2015 | Source: Getty Images\n\nIt was a decision born out of necessity, as Riley's ear infection prevented him from flying, and Finley was immersed in various activities. Although her then-husband, David Donoho, whom she has since divorced, offered her unwavering support, this separation was a first for her, and it tugged at her heartstrings.\n\nHolly Marie Combs and her son at the Los Angeles premiere of \"Spy Kids: All The Time In The World In 4D\" at Regal Cinemas L.A. Live on July 31, 2011 | Source: Getty Images\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe admitted that as a mother, it's a constant juggling act, and you never quite feel like you're giving your all to either role. Combs' career was flourishing, but the eternal dilemma of a working mother was apparent—the struggle to be a perfect actress and a perfect mom. Her career was taking her places, but she longed to be with her children. Combs admitted:\n\n\"You never feel like you're 100 percent at either one.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCombs, who grew up as an only child, understood the value of a big family. Her own childhood inspired her to create a family of her own, a journey she embarked on with her second husband, Donoho. She cherished the idea of having someone who had known you your whole life, especially in times of life-altering transitions.\n\nHolly Marie Combs and David Donoho at the 2016 Rhonda's Kiss event in Los Angeles, California, on November 3, 2016 | Source: Getty Images\n\nA Star On-Screen and Off-Screen\n\nCombs' professional journey has mirrored her personal life in its distinction. Her role as Piper Halliwell in \"Charmed\" endeared her to millions of viewers worldwide. The show, with its enchanting storyline, wove a spell that captivated audiences for eight seasons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCombs' portrayal of Piper, a witch with a kind heart and a strong spirit, left an indelible mark on the world of fantasy television. Reflecting on her experience with \"Charmed,\" she revealed the toll it took on her creatively and emotionally. The eight-season journey was demanding, and she felt the need to step back. She took a well-deserved break to focus on her growing family.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCombs chose to spend quality time with her children and reconnect with loved ones after dedicating eight years to the series. She revealed:\n\n\"And that was the greatest gift I could have asked for.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring a nearly four-year hiatus, Combs welcomed her third child, Kelley. This break allowed her to savor precious moments with her young sons, something she cherished deeply. Her most significant goal was to ensure her kids knew they were raised by their mother, and not nannies.\n\nHolly Marie Combs and son Kelley James Donoho at the premiere of Focus Features' \"Kubo and the Two Strings\" on August 14, 2016 | Source: Getty Images\n\nIn 2010, Combs made her return to television with a role in ABC Family's \"Pretty Little Liars,\" marking a new chapter in her acting career. Her character, Ella Montgomery, was a beloved figure in the show, adding depth to the storyline.\n\nHer decision to return to the screen was a result of a desire to find something worth leaving her kids for, a project that would let her balance her professional and personal life seamlessly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNavigating Love and Relationships\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCombs' journey through life has encompassed its share of challenges and triumphs. She is no stranger to the complexities of love and relationships, having experienced divorce not once but twice. Her first marriage to Bryan Travis Smith lasted from 1993 to 1997, and her second marriage to Donoho extended from 2004 to 2011.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead of viewing these experiences as setbacks, Combs sees them as valuable learning opportunities that contributed to her personal growth and inner strength. In 2016, just five months after her divorce from Donoho, fate had a delightful surprise in store. Combs crossed paths with Mike Ryan, a restaurateur, and love bloomed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheir relationship was unique, as Ryan had a daughter of his own, making their connection even more special. Combs revealed that they were at a point where they were content with living out the rest of their lives as single parents, but life had different plans. Their love story flourished when they least expected it. Combs shared:\n\n\"Just when I stopped looking for the perfect person, the perfect person showed up.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRyan's proposal was a thoughtful reflection of their blended families, symbolizing their harmonious union. In 2019, the couple exchanged vows in an intimate outdoor ceremony in Carmel, California. The wedding was a heartwarming event attended by family and friends, including some of Combs' former costars.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Combs approaches her 50s, she admits, she is \"not feeling it at all.\" She radiates a sense of timelessness, living her best life with her teenage sons and her husband, Ryan. Her journey from a gifted actress to a devoted mother and partner is a testament to her determination and extraordinary ability to embrace life's ups and downs with grace and unwavering spirit."
