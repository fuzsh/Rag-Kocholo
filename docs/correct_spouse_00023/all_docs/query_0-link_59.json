Well, let’s hope these exclusives change all that and bring a smile to all the “Charmed” fans, as well as ours. Enjoy.\n\nHolly Marie Combs\n\nDate of Birth\n\n3 December 1973, San Diego, California, USA\n\nBirth Name\n\nHolly Marie Combs\n\nNickname\n\nHolz\n\nHeight\n\n5′ 2″ (1.57 m)\n\nMini Biography\n\nHolly moved to New York at the tender age of 7. Already her stunning looks had turned heads, resulting in jobs in print ads and commercials. Soon these experiences lead to a desire to act, a dream shared by Holly’s mother, who herself was only 24. After a few bit parts, Holly landed a leading role as Kimberly in TV drama “Picket Fences” (1992). This show ran for 4 years, winning Holly critical acclaim and a Young Actors award. After the show ended, Holly starred in more roles in TV movies, enjoying her marriage and career success. This wasn’t to last; in 1997, she divorced husband Bryan Travis Smith and yearned for more challenging roles. Then in 1998, Holly’s good friend Shannen Doherty told her about a new television show based around three sisters who happen to be witches, who save the world from evil. Holly auditioned for the middle sister, won the role and is now known world wide for her portrayal of Piper Halliwell in the WB smash hit show “Charmed” (1998). Holly now lives in Burbank with her husband and their three sons.\n\nSpouse\n\nDavid W. Donoho (14 February 2004 – present) (filed for divorce) 3 children\n\nBryan Travis Smith (28 February 1993 – 1997) (divorced)\n\nTrivia\n\nShe (along with actresses Tangi Miller and Alyson Hannigan) is a spokesperson for breast cancer, and will appear in a new four page brochure (to be featured in Vogue, Glamour, Self, Mademoiselle, and Women’s Sports and Fitness) to raise awareness about the disease. [May 2000]\n\nEducation: Professional Children’s School N.Y. Coached by the great Ernie Martin\n\nDaughter of David Combs and Lauralei Combs.\n\nHobbies include gardening and horseback riding.\n\nPets: 3 horses – Jake, Jezebel and Jesse. 4 fish – all un-named. 4 birds – only two of which are named, Lollie and Flower. 6 dogs – Travis, Hugo, Sugar, Thunder, Lola and Fly Guy. 2 Cats – Blue and Selena. 2 rabbits – Thumper and Jack. The cats and rabbits are the only pets that live indoors.\n\nWas engaged to Storm Lyndon but they split up late in 2000.\n\nWas a bridesmaid at the wedding of Alyssa Milano. [1999]\n\n#62 in FHM’s 100 sexiest women countdown [2002]\n\n#78 in Stuff magazines 103 sexiest women countdown [2003]\n\nMarried “Charmed” (1998) key grip David W. Donoho on February 14, 2004\n\nSons, Finley Arthur Donoho, born on April 26, 2004, Riley Edward Donoho, born on October 26, 2006, and Kelly James Donoho, born on May 26, 2009. All three of her sons were born by C-section, Kelly, by emergency C-section, at 35 weeks.\n\nUpon Shannen Doherty’s departure from “Charmed” (1998), Holly Marie Combs’ character Piper became the oldest sister, despite being the youngest of all four actresses who have played Halliwell sisters in the series.\n\nThe scar in her eyebrow was caused by her walking into a marble table when she was learning to walk.\n\nHer mother had her when she was only 15.\n\nHer favorite books include, “The Garden of Eden” by Ernest Hemingway and “Practical Magic” by Alice Hoffman.\n\nShe is a huge Remy Zero fan.\n\nWas the only cast member of “Charmed” (1998) to want the show to continue.\n\nEnjoys horror movies.\n\nFilmed an unaired pilot called Rockenwagner.\n\nIs good friends with Charisma Carpenter.\n\nAlthough not credited, (she only said 3 or 4 words) she was in a poker-school scene with Rusty (Brad Pitt) in Oceans 11, where she was addressed by her real christian name.\n\nSecond son Riley Edward Donoho (born October 26, 2006).\n\nThird son Kelley James Donoho (born May 26, 2009).\n\nFirst son Finley Arthur Donoho (born April 26, 2004),.\n\nPersonal Quotes\n\nI have no interest in a guy who doesn’t know the right end of a screwdriver.\n\n[About having a child, shortly before getting pregnant] “For some reason everybody on the set – except for me – thinks I should get pregnant for real. It’s like they all got together and I’ve been nominated! Honestly, the thought of having a baby scares me!”\n\n(About topless pictures of her on the internet.) “I did one topless scene when I was 20. There was no thought in my mind that they could freeze that moment into 15 different pictures. The worst, I was thinking, was that stupid guy friends of mine could rewind it and play it again.”\n\nI was the product of very young parents, and they had wild ways. My mother was in a punk band. Rebelling would have been learning to play piano.\n\n(On the miracle of motherhood.) Now, as an actress and a person, it has completely broadened my horizons because I have such a deep level of empathy for everyone. It opens you up and you’re like a bleeding heart. It’s funny, because you can be such a guarded person in your personal life and try to protect yourself from all these worries and hurts, but when you have a kid, you’re suddenly this feeling being. When Finley gets his vaccinations, it kills me, and you can’t protect yourself from that. My heart is being ripped out with every shot. It’s a deeper level of emotion that I wasn’t prepared to feel, but it’s completely amazing. It has opened me up both as a person and as an actress. Everything has a deeper meaning now.\n\n(On her baby, Finley) Thank God, he’s such a good traveler. He adapts so well. He can pretty much sleep anywhere. I was very, very worried about him having a normal kind of life and being comfortable and not carted around everywhere, but he’s so good. We went on location in Las Vegas with my husband and we’d go out to the casino and he thinks there’s just a lot of people in the living room. Like, wow, it’s kind of loud and there’s a lot of people here today.\n\n(On Alyssa & Rose’s escapades with her baby, Finley) They take him in the makeup trailer and do bad things to his hair. The girls gave him a mohawk the other day. So I can’t let him out of my sight for very long.\n\n(On motherhood) It’s weird. When you become a mom you just learn how to function sleep deprived and you do get used to it. I came back to work when he was three months old and the first few months were rough. And then somehow you learn to exist on no sleep. And now when he does upon occasion sleep through the night, which is like a full six hours, you’re pretty sure he’s suffocating. So you don’t sleep anyway.\n\n(On motherhood) It’s changed just about everything about my life. It definitely puts everything in perspective. Things that were so important to you mean absolutely nothing and the status of his diaper means absolutely everything.\n\nThe WB never treated us well, so we didn’t expect a lot of farewell wishes and flowers or cards.\n\nThere are occasional food fights. We had Friday-night grape night. Because when I had the scene with Josh and the wine, we started picking up the plastic grapes and throwing them at each other. By Friday night we were so tired, and the director couldn’t control us! There were grapes all over the floor.\n\nFelicity Huffman is just flawless; she’s above and beyond TV and movies and this Earth.\n\nSalary\n\n“Charmed” (1998) $60,000 per episode (seasons 1 through 4)\n\nWhere Are They Now\n\n(November 2003) Expecting her first child with David W. Donoho in April 2004.\n\n(April 2004) Had her first son on April 26, 2004 at 1:30 pm, named Finley Arthur Donoho.\n\n(April 2006) Expecting her second child with David W. Donoho in October 2006.\n\n(October 2006) Had her second son on October 26, 2006 at 12:57 pm, named Riley Edward Donoho.\n\n(June 2009) Had her third son on May 26, 2009 named, Kelley James Donoho. She hid her pregnancy because of a “high risk pregnancy”."
