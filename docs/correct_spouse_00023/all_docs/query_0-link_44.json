        "text": "Holly Marie Combs (born December 3, 1973 in San Diego, California) is an American actress who has worked in movies and television series. She is most likely known best for her role as Piper Halliwell on Charmed. From 2002 until 2006, when the series ended, Holly was a producer for the show.\n\nHolly was born when her mother, Lauralei Combs (nee Berckhem), was just 15 years old. Lauralei married Holly's biological father, but the two split up after two years, feeling they were too young to make a marriage work. While Holly was learning to walk she hit her head on a marble table, resulting in a scar over her right eyebrow. Holly went through many different homes with her mother, often having very little privacy, while Holly's mom attempted to pursue an acting career. When Holly was seven, she and her mother moved to New York City. Holly was 12 when Lauralei married her stepfather. In New York City Holly attended Beekman Hill Elementary and then The Professional Children's School of Acting. It is reported that one of her teachers was the great Ernie Martin. Already, Holly's beauty was turning heads and she landed many print ads and commercials. Holly soon grew to love acting, just like her mother had.\n\nIn 1993, Holly married Brian \"Travis\" Smith, but they divorced in 1997. Later, she became engaged to Storm Lyndon, but they split in 2000. Since 2001, Holly has lived with David W. Donoho, who worked as key grip on Charmed. They married on February 14, 2004 and had a son, Finley Arthur Donoho, on April 26, 2004. They are now expecting their second child in August/ September 2006. Holly lives in the Bell Canyon, San Fernendo Valley, California.\n\nHolly has a huge collection of animals, being a dedicated animal lover. These include:\n\n3 horses (Jesse, Jake and Jezebel),\n\n5 dogs (Thunder, Sugar, Hugo, Lola and Travis - Lola given to her by Alyssa's mother Lin Milano),\n\n3 cats (?, Selena and Blue), 2 lovebirds (Lollypop and Flower), 4 rabbits and koi fish.\n\nHolly used to have a turtle also, but due to the salmonella risk that it posed to the bubbly new arrival Finley, it had to go. But the turtle went to a good home, in the pond of a dear friend of Holly's. Past pets include 2 disabled hamsters and a huskey named Wiley, which Don Johnson gave to her.\n\nAlthough she had a number of minor roles in the late 1980s, including a brief speaking part in Oliver Stone's Born on the Fourth of July. Holly's major acting debut arrived in the 1992 TV drama series Picket Fences. She auditioned for the role of Kimberly while she was in New York. The casting agent told her that she wasn't right for the part because, \"She didn't have a big enough heart.\" Holly retorted, \"If you're looking for someone with a big heart, what the hell are you doing in New York?\" She immediately got the job. Picket Fences ran for four years, winning Holly critical acclaim and a Young Actor's award.\n\nHolly was with her best friend Shannen Doherty when she saw the pilot script for Charmed on the backseat. Holly told Shannen that she wanted to audition. When they did, Holly auditioned for the role of \"Prue Halliwell\" and Shannen for \"Piper Halliwell,\" but they ended up changing roles because they didn't \"fit.\" Alyssa Milano and Holly both became producers for Charmed in the fifth season.\n\nCharmed debuted in 1998 and was a hit TV series, which ended in May 2006.\n\nHer favorite color is blue.\n\nHolly enjoys Italian food, salami, bacon and cheeseburgers.\n\nAs for music, she is a huge Remy Zero fan.\n\nHer favorite books include, 'The Garden of Eden' by Ernest Hemingway and 'Practical Magic' by Alice Hoffman.\n\nHolly is a spokesperson for Breast Cancer.\n\nHer mother was in a \"punk rock band\".\n\nHolly thinks she's had a gypsy childhood; believed that to rebel in her household was to learn how to \"play the piano,\"\n\nHolly became a certified scuba diver at 13.\n\nShe has four tattoos.\n\nFilmography\n\nA promotional photo from Charmed.Charmed (1998-2006) (TV)\n\nPicket Fences (1992-1996) (TV)\n\nSee Jane Date (2003) (TV)\n\nOcean's Eleven (2001) (uncredited)\n\nLove's Deadly Triangle: The Texas Cadet Murder (1997) (TV)\n\nRelativity (1997) (TV)\n\nDaughters (1997) (TV)\n\nMemories of Murder (2007) (rumored)\n\nSins of Silence (1996) (TV)\n\nA Reason to Believe (1995)\n\nA Perfect Stranger (1994) (TV)\n\nChain of Desire (1992)\n\nDr. Giggles (1992)\n\nSimple Men (1992)\n\nBorn on the Fourth of July (1989) (uncredited)\n\nNew York Stories (1989) (uncredited)\n\nSweet Hearts Dance (1988)\n\nWalls of Glass (1985) (uncredited)"
