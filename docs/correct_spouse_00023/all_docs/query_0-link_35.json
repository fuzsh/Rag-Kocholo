At age 8, Holly and her mother left San Diego for New York where Lauralei could pursue an acting career while she was still young. With a keen interest herself in the performing arts, Holly later enrolled at The Professional Children's acting school.\n\nStarting her career with a few commercials and minor movies roles in the late 80's, the turning point in her career came in 1992, when she won the role of Kimberly Brock in the hit tv series Picket Fences created by David E Kelley. She maintained her position as one of the most prominent TV actors when she earned her first award in 1993 of \"Best Young Actress in a New Television Series\" at the \"Young Artist Awards\" ceremony.\n\nIn the late 90's, Holly again achieved recognition when she was cast as Piper Halliwell in Charmed, a tv series produced by Aaron Spelling, creator of other hit TV series such as Beverly Hills, 90210, along with Shannen Doherty (Beverly Hills, 90210), and Alyssa Milano (Who's the Boss?). Despite being the youngest of all three actresses, she played the second eldest of three sisters who discover by accident they are witches and then have to deal with the consequences of this revelation. The show quickly became a hit, running for a total of eight seasons from 1998 to 2006, and held the record for the second best pilot ratings of the WB TV shows just behind the tv show Smallville.\n\nOn the big screen, Holly has had roles in a number of popular movies including Born on the Fourth of July (1989, although uncredited), Dr Giggles (1992), and a special appearance in Ocean's Eleven. In 2008 she signed a contract with Lifetime Television for their new comedy-drama pilot Mistresses to play the leading role of Jane, a woman who has left her career to become a stay at home mom to her kids, also co-starring Brooke Burns who, incidentally is the ex-wife of her Charmed co-star Julian McMahon (Cole Turner).\n\nHolly has two sons Finley Arthur (born 2004) and Riley Edward (born 2006) with her former husband David W. Donoho. Married restauranteur Mike Ryan in 2019.\n\nRoles\n\nStarring Roles\n\nSeries Role Year(s) Season(s) Picket Fences Kimberly Brock 1992–1996 1 2 3 4 Charmed Piper Halliwell 1998–2006 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Pretty Little Liars Ella Montgomery 2010–2013 1 2 3\n\nGuest Starring Roles\n\nSeries Role Episode Airdate Relativity Anne Price 1x14 - Billable Hours January 18, 1997\n\nSpecials and Made-for-TV Movies\n\nTitle Role Airdate Series/Banner A Perfect Stranger Amanda Hale September 12, 1994 Sins of Silence Sophie DiMatteo February 20, 1996 Daughters Alex Morrell 1997 Love's Deadly Triangle: The Texas Cadet Murder Diane Zamora February 10, 1997 See Jane Date Natasha Nutley August 16, 2003 Point of Entry Kathy Alden November 3, 2007\n\nTalk, News and Game Show Appearances\n\nSeries Episode Airdate The Sharon Osbourne Show February 20, 2004\n\nMemorable Moments\n\nAwards and Accolades\n\n\"Best Young Actress in a New Television Series\" - \"Young Artist Awards\" - 1993\n\nKimberly Brock in Picket Fences\n\nTrivia\n\nBy the end of the show, Holly was making $102,000 per episode of Charmed.\n\nOriginally auditioned for the role of Prue Halliwell on \"Charmed\", but the role was given to Shannen Doherty and she was cast as Piper Halliwell (which Shannen originally auditioned for).\n\nIs of Irish descent\n\nHer mother, Lauralei was 15 years old and her biological father was 17 years old when Holly was born; her mother remarried when she was 12 years old\n\nMoved to New York City when she was 7 years old\n\nAttended the Professional Children's School\n\nMarried her first husband, actor Bryan Travis Smith in February of 1993; they divorced in 1997.\n\nMarried her second husband, David Donoho in February of 2004; they have three sons: Finley (born in April of 2004), Riley (born in October of 2006) and Kelley (born in May of 2009); they divorced in 2011\n\nAnnounced her engagement to her boyfriend, Mike in September of 2017\n\nQuotes\n\n\"I have no interest in a guy who doesn't know the right end of a screwdriver.\"\n\n\"I was the product of very young parents, and they had wild ways.
