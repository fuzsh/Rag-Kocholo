        "text": "'Pretty Little Liars' star divorcing\n\n'Pretty Little Liars' star Holly Marie Combs and David Donoho, a TV production worker whom she married in 2004, are going their separate ways. Combs reportedly has asked Donoho for custody of their three children.\n\nCharmed star Holly Marie Combs files for divorce from second husband David Donoho. Holly Marie Combs clearly does not have a 'charmed' love life, given that she's just filed for a divorce from her second husband.\n\nThe former Charmed star has announced her split from husband of seven years David Donoho.\n\nThe 37-year-old actress cited irreconcilable differences as her official reason for calling it quits.\n\nwho have been told the marriage has been rocky for 'quite a while.'\n\nThe couple have three young sons together: Finley, 7, Riley, 5, and two-year-old Kelley.\n\nThe website says that Combs has requested joint custody.\n\nThe second divorce could be quite costly for the actress, who now stars on ABC Family's Pretty Little Liars, given that she never signed a prenup.\n\nMost of her fortune was amassed on the now defunct WB Network series Charmed, where she starred as good witch Piper Halliwell for eight years.\n\nShe met Donoho back in 2004 when he was working as key grip on her show.\n\nThis is the star's second divorce: she was previously married to Bryan Travis Smith from 1993-1997.\n\nWhile Combs is divorcing, her Charmed co-star Shannen Doherty recently tied the knot for a third time.\n\nShe married Kurt Iswarienko on October 15 of this year in Malibu.\n\nThe 40-year-old was also married to actor George Hamilton's son Ashley for seven months in 1993-1994 and had her seven-month marriage to producer Rick Salomon annulled in 2003.
