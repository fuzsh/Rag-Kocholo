        "text": "What is Holly Marie Combs's Net Worth and Salary?\n\nHolly Marie Combs is an actress and producer who has a net worth of $8 million. Holly Marie Combs is known for her roles in the television series \"Picket Fences,\" \"Charmed,\" and \"Pretty Little Liars.\" She is the only actor who appeared on all 179 episodes of \"Charmed,\" including the unaired pilot. She was the producer of Charmed seasons 5–8 which aired from 2001 to 2006.\n\nShe has also appeared in many television films, such as \"Island City,\" \"Sins of Silence,\" \"Daughters,\" and \"See Jane Date.\" On the big screen, Combs's credits include \"Sweet Hearts Dance,\" \"Born on the Fourth of July,\" \"Dr. Giggles,\" and \"Chain of Desire.\"\n\nEarly Life and Education\n\nHolly Marie Combs was born on December 3, 1973 in San Diego, California to teenage parents. Her parents eventually got married, but separated after two years due to feeling too young to make their marriage work. Combs subsequently lived in a number of different homes with her mother while her mother tried to break into acting. When she was seven, Combs moved with her mother to New York City; her mother eventually remarried there. Combs was educated at Beekman Hill Elementary and the Professional Children's School.\n\nTelevision Career\n\nCombs began her television career on soap operas in the early 1990s, playing Louisa Young in two episodes of \"Guiding Light\" and Denise Jones in five episodes of \"As the World Turns.\" However, her breakthrough role came on the CBS family drama series \"Picket Fences,\" which ran from 1992 to 1996. Combs played the main role of Kimberly Brock, the daughter of Tom Skerritt's character Sheriff Jimmy Brock. For her work, she won a Young Artist Award and shared a SAG Award nomination for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series. While \"Picket Fences\" was still running, Combs appeared in the television films \"A Perfect Stranger,\" \"Island City,\" and \"Sins of Silence.\" In 1997, she starred in two fact-based television crime films, \"Love's Deadly Triangle: The Texas Cadet Murder,\" in which she portrayed convicted murderer Diane Zamora, and \"Daughters,\" in which she played one of two daughters of a murdered heiress. The same year, Combs appeared in an episode of the short-lived ABC series \"Relativity.\"\n\nIn 1998, Combs began playing the main role of Piper Halliwell, the middle of three witch sisters, on the fantasy drama series \"Charmed.\" She starred alongside Alyssa Milano and Shannen Doherty, who played her sisters. After Doherty left the show at the end of season three, Combs became the eldest sister on \"Charmed\" for the remaining five seasons through 2006. In addition to appearing in all 178 episodes of the series, Combs served as a producer for the final four seasons. Meanwhile, in 2003, she starred opposite Charisma Carpenter in the television film \"See Jane Date.\" Combs landed her next main role in 2010 on the teen drama series \"Pretty Little Liars\" as Ella Montgomery, the mother of Lucy Hale's character Aria. After serving as a series regular for the show's first three seasons, she became a special guest star for the remaining four seasons through 2017. Among her other credits, Combs starred alongside Shannen Doherty on the reality road trip show \"Off the Map with Shannen & Holly,\" and starred in the 2016 Hallmark Channel movie \"Love's Complicated.\"\n\nFilm Career\n\nCombs appeared in her first film when she was 12 years old, playing the brief role of Abby Hall in the 1985 romantic comedy \"Walls of Glass.\" She had a bigger part three years later in the dramedy \"Sweet Hearts Dance,\" playing the daughter of Don Johnson's and Susan Sarandon's characters. After that, Combs appeared in the anthology film \"New York Stories\" and Oliver Stone's Academy Award-winning anti-war drama \"Born on the Fourth of July,\" both released in 1989. Early the next decade, she was in \"Nobody Can Hear You Scream.\"\n\nCombs had a big year on film in 1992, appearing in three titles, the first being Hal Hartley's \"Simple Men.\" She next starred alongside Larry Drake and Cliff DeYoung in the slasher film \"Dr. Giggles.\" Combs's final film of the year was Temístocles López's \"Chain of Desire,\" a remake of the French film \"La Ronde.\" She returned to the big screen in 1995 with a supporting role in the independent drama \"A Reason to Believe.\" Combs hasn't appeared in any major motion pictures since then, although she did make an uncredited cameo appearance in Steven Soderbergh's 2001 remake of \"Ocean's Eleven.\"\n\nPersonal Life\n\nCombs has been married multiple times. She wed her first husband, Bryan Travis Smith, in 1993; they divorced in 1997. After being cast on \"Charmed\" the following year, Combs began dating the show's key grip David Donoho, whom she eventually married in early 2004. Together, they had three sons before divorcing in late 2011 on account of irreconcilable differences. Combs wed her third husband, restaurateur Mike Ryan, in 2019.\n\nReal Estate\n\nIn February 2000, Holly paid $780,000 for a one-acre horse property in Bell Canyon, California. She listed this home for sale in July 2019 for $2.2 million. She did not find a buyer until March 2021 when she accepted $1.85 million.\n\nIn 2010 Holly acquired a 25-acre property in Blanco, Texas. She renovated the structures and renamed the property Sparrows Nest Ranch."
