        "text": "Edina ( ee-DY-nə) is a suburban city in Hennepin County, Minnesota, United States. A first-ring suburb of Minneapolis, Edina has garnered a reputation as a predominantly wealthy community. Formerly a center of strong conservative sentiment in traditionally liberal-leaning Minnesota, Edina has become less of a Republican stronghold since the turn of the century and has been represented by all Democrats since 2019.\n\nEdina began as a small farming and milling community along Minnehaha Creek in the 1860s and became one of Minneapolis's first incorporated suburbs in 1888. After years of being a streetcar suburb, Edina grew into a prototypical post-war suburb in the 1950s. The city was largely built to be car-centric and plays host to the nation's oldest indoor mall, the Southdale Center. The object of white flight from Minneapolis, Edina embraced sundown laws and racial covenants to keep the community white.\n\nMajor corporations, such as Dairy Queen, Great Clips, Edina Realty, and Caribou Coffee, have headquarters in Edina, and the city today is known for its shopping, parks, and high quality of life. In 2019, the population was estimated to be 52,857.\n\nHistory\n\nSettlement\n\nEdina began as part of Richfield Township, Minnesota. By the 1870s, 17 families, most of them immigrating as a result of the potato famine in Ireland, had come to Minnesota and claimed land in the southwest section of what was then Richfield Township. They were followed by settlers from New England and Germany, who claimed additional land near Minnehaha Creek. The Baird and Grimes neighborhoods (which are both listed on the National Register of Historic Places), and the Country Club District (then known as Waterville Mills) are located in the northeast part of Edina, and were among the first areas to be established. The area then known as the Cahill Settlement, at West 70th Street and Cahill Road, was also an early community center and the home of Cahill School.\n\nIn 1888, the residents of the township held a meeting to consider founding a new village, thus separating themselves from Richfield Township. The idea was favorably accepted by those within the community and a committee was established to oversee the transition.\n\nNaming\n\nAfter the decision was made to form a new village, a debate ensued regarding the naming of the new village. Several town meetings were held in the Minnehaha Grange Hall, during which the names Hennepin Park, Westfield and Edina were suggested. Minutes taken by Henry F. Brown, a farmer and future owner (1889) of the Edina Mill, are summarized as follows:\n\nA long debate ensued with regard to the name by which the corporation shall be called. A motion was made and passed to reconsider the vote taken at the previous meeting of the name of the proposed village, Westfield. Another motion was then made by Andrew Craik to call the proposed village Edina (upon moving to the township in 1869 from Edinburgh, he bought and renamed the mill to the Edina Mill). Before the motion could be decided, James A. Bull, a member of the five person committee, made another motion to adjourn, which was seconded by the majority. However, the chairman of the meeting called this motion out of order, at which time disorder ensued with Baird, Wilson, Ryan and Bull declaring their intent to no longer serve as members of the committee if a gag law was to prevail. During this heated moment the meeting became somewhat boisterous until, after a few minutes order was restored. Seeing that no more work could be done at this time, a final motion was made and passed to reschedule the meeting to a future date.\n\nAt the next meeting, the name Edina was finally chosen with a vote of 47 for and 42 against.\n\nThere has been a prevailing myth about the decision to name the new village Edina, which states that two opposing communities—the Irish Cahill community and the Scottish Mill community—fought about whether to give the community an Irish name (Killarney Lakes) or a Scottish name (Edina). The 1860 census, however, indicates that there were no Scottish people in Edina in 1860, and only a couple were present at the time of Edina's founding (1888).\n\nMorningside\n\nMain article: Morningside, Minnesota\n\nThe first suburban development in Edina occurred during the early 1900s in Morningside, a neighborhood in the northeastern part of the village. As Morningside grew, conflict arose between its residents who wanted more city services, and the residents of the rest of the village who wanted to maintain Edina's rural character. As a result of that conflict, Morningside seceded from Edina in 1920 and became a separate village. In 1966, however, the Village of Morningside once again became part of Edina.\n\nHistorical racial discrimination\n\nAccording to historian Deborah Morse-Kahn, the Quaker village that existed where Edina would be built included African Americans who \"became very involved in community life—especially as leaders.\" At the November 1898 general election, J. Frank Wheaton, a Republican African-American, was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives representing District 42, which included all of Edina. Wheaton beat his white Democratic opponent in every city of Minneapolis ward and in every village within the legislative district, including Edina, even though the legislative district had only approximately 100 African Americans residents out of a total of 40,000 residents.\n\nIn the early 20th century discriminatory policies led nearly all of the African Americans who had been living in Edina to move away. James W. Loewen described the suburb as a sundown town. Researchers point in particular to Samuel Thorpe's development of the Country Club district, which used deed restrictions as means to exclude non-whites, stating explicitly that:\n\nNo lot shall ever be sold, conveyed, leased, or rented to any person other than one of the white or Caucasian race, nor shall any lot ever be used or occupied by any person other than one of the white or Caucasian race, except such as may be serving as domestics for the owner or tenant of said lot, while said owner or tenant is residing thereon.\n\nOther developments, like that built by N. P. Dodge Corporation just a mile away, followed suit in attempting to protect land values through racial policies. Though the Supreme Court ruled these kinds of discriminatory housing clauses unenforceable in its Shelley v. Kraemer decision of 1948, reports of discrimination persisted through the 1950s and 1960s. According to the Edina Historical Society's story about the first black family in Morningside (then a separate village) in 1960, attempts to keep them out included tactics like trying \"to get [their] lot condemned for drainage.\" In response, then-mayor Ken Joyce wrote a note dismissing the drainage concern and challenging citizens \"to live the Golden Rule\". Shortly thereafter the village voted in favor of inclusion.\n\nJewish residents were also affected by exclusionary deed covenants. In the 1960s, some residents boasted that Edina had \"Not one Negro and not one Jew.\"\n\nGeography\n\nMany major highways run through or are close to Edina, making it readily accessible to those within the metropolitan area. Minnesota State Highways 62 and 100 divide the City into four sections. U.S. Highway 169 and Minnesota State Highway 100 extend north and south. Interstate 494 and Minnesota State Highway 62 extend east and west.\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 15.97 square miles (41.36 km2), of which 15.45 square miles (40.02 km2) is land and 0.52 square miles (1.35 km2) is water. Residential areas comprise the largest portion of the City, which is now more than 95 percent developed. Within Edina are many different neighborhoods; Highlands, Indian Hills, Morningside, Country Club District, Cahill Village, Chapel Hill, South Harriet Park, Interlachen, Rolling Green, Presidents, Sunnyslope, White Oaks, Parkwood Knolls, Braemar Hills, Birchcrest, Dewey Hill and Hilldale.\n\nDemographics\n\nHistorical population Census Pop. %± 1890 531 — 1900 749 41.1% 1910 1,101 47.0% 1920 1,833 66.5% 1930 3,138 71.2% 1940 5,855 86.6% 1950 9,744 66.4% 1960 30,482 212.8% 1970 44,031 44.4% 1980 46,073 4.6% 1990 46,075 0.0% 2000 47,425 2.9% 2010 47,941 1.1% 2020 53,494 11.6% U.S. Decennial Census\n\n2018 Estimate\n\nAs of the 2010 Census, there were 47,941 people, 20,672 households, and 12,918 families residing in the city.

The former senior pastor, John Crosby, led CPC to be a congregation of over 5,000. In 2006, the church celebrated the 50th anniversary. The church was a leader in the movement to establish ECO as a breakaway movement from the Presbyterian Church (USA).\n\nRecreation\n\nParks\n\nEdina's parkland and open space totals more than 1,550 acres (6.3 km2). The Edina Park and Recreation Department oversees 44 parks, which include amenities such as baseball, football and soccer fields; softball diamonds; basketball and tennis courts; outdoor skating rinks; playground equipment for young children; and picnic shelters. The Department also maintains eight miles (13 km) of scenic pathways for bicycling, walking, jogging, cross-country skiing and snowshoeing.\n\nBesides overseeing the parks, the Edina Park & Recreation Department is also responsible for the operation of 10 arts, community, and recreation facilities within the city including Braemar Golf Course, Braemar Ice Rink, Centennial Lakes Park, and Edinborough Park.\n\nPrivate country clubs\n\nThere are two country clubs located in Edina, the Edina Country Club and the Interlachen Country Club.\n\nIn popular culture\n\nThe interior of a 1950s rambler in Edina's Highlands neighborhood was used in the Coen brothers' 2009 film A Serious Man.\n\nLead singer Craig Finn from the band The Hold Steady is from Edina and has made several allusions to the town in their songs. For example, the song \"Hornets! Hornets!\" from the album Separation Sunday describes a wild night in the town, ending with the line \"I drove the wrong way down 169 and almost died up by Edina High.\" Also, the song's title is a reference to Edina High School's mascot, the Hornet.\n\nIn the movie , star forward Adam Banks, when asked his name and where he is from, introduces himself as \"Adam Banks Edina, Minnesota\".\n\nIn the movie Jingle all the way, some of the exterior house scenes were shot in Edina's Brucewood neighborhood, near Arden Park.\n\nPart of the 1994 movie Little Big League was shot at one of Countryside Park's baseball diamonds.

It enrolls approximately 8,500 K–12 students and is served by 1,139 teachers and support staff.\n\nEdina has one high school, Edina High School. The area is served by two middle schools: (South View Middle School and Valley View Middle School) and six elementary schools (Concord, Creek Valley, Cornelia, Highlands, Countryside, and Normandale).\n\nPrivate schools\n\nThere are three private schools in Edina: Our Lady of Grace Catholic School, Golden Years Montessori, and Avail Academy-Edina Campus.\n\nColleges\n\nThe Minnesota State University, Mankato satellite campus.\n\nTransportation\n\nMany major highways run through or are close to Edina, making it readily accessible to those within the metropolitan area. Minnesota State Highways 62 and 100 divide the City into four sections. U.S. Route 169 and Minnesota State Highway 100 extend north and south. Interstate 494 and Minnesota State Highway 62 extend east and west.\n\nTransit\n\nBefore streetcar service was abandoned in 1954, the Twin City Rapid Transit Company's Lake Minnetonka Line went through Edina paralleling 44th Street on dedicated right-of-way. After streetcar service was abandoned, the right-of-way was developed as single family housing.\n\nBus service\n\nMetro Transit, the Twin Cities regional transit authority, operates daytime buses in Edina, primarily along France Avenue and through business parks along Interstate 494. Edina's Southdale Transit Center is one of the southwest Twin Cities primary transit hubs.\n\nThe E Line, an arterial BRT route, is currently planned to travel from the University of Minnesota through Downtown Minneapolis and Uptown to the Southdale Transit Center in Edina. It is expected to be operational by 2026.\n\nCommuter rail\n\nThe Dan Patch Line and successor Minneapolis, Northfield and Southern Railway operated interurban service through Edina until 1942. Although in poor condition and rated for speeds less than 35 mph, the tracks are still used by freight trains. Under the Dan Patch Corridor proposal, commuter trains would operate between Minneapolis and Northfield with a station in Edina. A feasibility study was conducted in 2000 and found that ridership would be high but there would be a significant cost to upgrade the corridor for commuter trains. Due to this and strong opposition from residents living near the rail line, the proposal was put on hold until other commuter rail lines could be built. In 2002 a legislative gag order was placed on the project, which forbid the Metropolitan Council, MnDOT, and county rail authorities from discussing, studying, and building commuter rail on the Dan Patch Line. In 2017 the Edina City Council conducted a study on the pros and cons of passenger rail on the Dan Patch Line. The conclusion was to not pursue passenger rail at that time (as of 2018).\n\nNotable people\n\nThe following is a list of notable people who were either born in, lived in, are current residents of, or are otherwise closely associated with the city of Edina:\n\nImages for kids\n\nMinnehaha Grange Hall\n\nEdina Cinema, a theater in downtown Edina that opened in 1934, but closed in 2020\n\nOverlooking the 12th hole on Braemar Golf Course\n\nSee also"
