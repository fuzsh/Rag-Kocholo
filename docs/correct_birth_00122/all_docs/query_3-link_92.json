        "text": "So finally, I feel like I have a moment and my wits about me to write a blog!!! üôÇ\n\nIt‚Äôs been a long few weeks on the road, but it definitely is ending on a positive note‚Ä¶.I am at home in Indialantic, FL!!! The best part of the trip is today, where I am spending time alone ‚Ä¶. went to church at Holy Name of Jesus this morning, getting my work in now and going to hit the beach later this afternoon‚Ä¶. nothing like home sweet home and silence! üôÇ\n\nThis is the first time in 4 years where I did not step on site at the Sony Ericsson Open and I have to tell you, it feels pretty good. We will see if it effects our overall social media #‚Äôs but I sure hope not!! üôÇ\n\nHopefully, you like the videos we have been putting out the last few weeks cause we have tried to bring something completely different and new‚Ä¶..\n\nSo let‚Äôs talk more about the Juice infomercial! Did you like the Juice informercial parody with Victoria Azarenka?! I am seriously obsessed with infomercials and have always wanted to do one, so Robin and I were able to make it happen‚Ä¶And to have world #1 undefeated player Vika as the spokesperson was awesome!\n\nWhat is really surprising to me is how many people actually thought we were being real!!! hahaha FYI people, please count the #‚Äôs 555-JUICE-ME‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs too many #‚Äôs to be a real phone number‚Ä¶. HEEEELLLLOOOO!!!!! lol\n\nAnyway, Juice infomercial was super fun to shoot with some of our great US juniors Gabby, Bryce, Racquel, Emma and Dominique‚Ä¶ all very talented and very funny!!! Watch out for these kids, they will be doing some good stuff in the years to come!! We also brought in some local juniors to ‚Äúkeep it real‚Äù with Joe, Elise and Audrey‚Ä¶.. these kids were great actors and were awesome‚Ä¶.Joe got into it and its fun talking marketing with some uber smart young ones! I really miss working with kids since I stopped teaching, so working with all these kids definitely was a highlight of the past few weeks.\n\nSo I did spend two days in Miami for Mardy Fish‚Äôs appearance at Tennis Plaza‚Äôs Grand Opening in Aventura. We had a great turnout and Mardy definitely got some kids motivated to play!! We had the kids interview Mardy which was quite cute and they asked some great questions. Tennis Plaza also had Mardy sign the wall to commemorate the visit and he wrote ‚ÄúTennis Plaza and Wilson rock!‚Äù ‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs right! haha\n\nOne of my favorite parts of the night was when two other brands had their players show up at the same time‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm a bit competitive, so to see that they did not plan out their appearances as well as we did‚Ä¶ well I have to say I take a bit of pride in that‚Ä¶ so sue me, I like to do better! üòâ\n\nThat‚Äôs all from FL, off to Chicago in the AM!!\n\nUntil later,\n\nTracy\n\n6 hours of sleep in 3 days is not a good thing, but it was definitely worth it!!!\n\nWe are proud to say that Wilson Tennis is proud to officially own the Guinness World Record for the ‚ÄúMost people to bounce a tennis ball on their tennis racket in one location‚Äù!!!\n\nIt was a crazy day for the Wilson team and we started the morning at 4am to make sure we had everything ready for the Guinness event and it was incredible to have so many people on hand for this event.\n\nI have to say that it‚Äôs humbling and an honor to have so many great people assist us with the event. To make an event of this size happen, it would not be possible without our volunteers. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!\n\nWe all pulled together and it was an amazing experience.\n\nOne of the coolest things about my job is that I often get to combine my interests with the sport & brand.\n\nI always had a Guinness book as a kid and tried to figure out a way to get into the book and now WE ARE IN THE GUINNESS BOOK!!! AMAZING!!\n\nKnock that off the bucketlist!! üôÇ\n\nAnd the day didn‚Äôt end after Guinness, it was onto our 2012 photoshoot!!!!! We spent the rest of the day shooting Juan Martin Del Potro, Feliciano Lopez, Petra Kvitova & Kei Nishikori‚Ä¶. some exciting stuff to come in 2012!!\n\nStay tuned.\n\nMuch more to write but should probably help the boys in the suite.\n\nSo for now, check out the recap video of Guinness\n\nUntil later,\n\nTracy\n\nSo ok, it‚Äôs 12am and I am sitting in the suite, trying to get through emails and do the thing I am supposed to do for Wilson, social media!! I actually miss writing posts and interacting and it‚Äôs been less than 24 hrs of not doing it!! haha\n\nRight now, it‚Äôs a crazy time for us, we have the Guinness World Record event with Mardy Fish and Andrea Petkovic coming up on Friday (RSVP for event) and on top of that, we will have a photoshoot on Friday and Saturday with some of our top players like Juan Martin Del Potro & Petra Kvitova‚Ä¶.trying to multitask on things this big‚Ä¶. not too easy.\n\nSo today was spent ungripping junior rackets for the Guinness event to make sure they are ready to go for 7:30am on Friday!!! And tomorrow will be much of the same‚Ä¶. this is what I like to call b***h work‚Ä¶. so that‚Äôs the bad part‚Ä¶.\n\nThe good part is that the Wilson Next Gen‚Äôrs are playing well and ready to make their move on tour! Keep an eye out for big hitters Kristyna Pliskova, Laura Robson, Jessica Pegula, Benoit Paire, Kristina Mladenovic, David Goffin and more!!\n\nSome good qualies matches on tomorrow, so hope to see you on site.\n\nAlright back to the grind before another day of prep work‚Ä¶.\n\nUntil later,\n\nTracy\n\nWTA Tennis World #11 Andrea Petkovic announced that she will join Mardy Fish in Wilson‚Äôs attempt to set the Guinness Book of World Record for the ‚ÄúMost people to bounce a tennis ball on their racquet in one location‚Äù on August 26, 2011 at the Billie Jean King Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows, NY.\n\nPetkovic is having a stellar year, using her Wilson Six.One Team BLX racquet to win her 2nd career singles title, reach the quarterfinals of Australian Open and French Open and catapult her to a career high #11 in the world.\n\n‚ÄúWe are psyched to have Andrea on board for the event. Her fun and energetic personality is perfect for getting everyone on the courts,‚Äù said Mike Steck, Wilson Racquet Global Director of Marketing. ‚ÄúAnd we can‚Äôt wait to see what dance moves she busts out after we break the record!‚Äù\n\nFish and Petkovic are encouraging kids to get fit and get into sport. One of the first things players learn when starting tennis, is to bounce the ball on their racquet and the Guinness World Record attempt will have players of all ages do just that. The first 500 kids to participate in the world record attempt will receive a free Wilson junior racquet and a can of tennis balls so they can get started right away!\n\nFor more information on the event and how to win a trip to New York to help Andrea Petkovic, Mardy Fish & Wilson break the record, go to:\n\nhttp://apps.facebook.com/wilsongww/\n\nTo RSVP to join Mardy and Andrea on August 26th at the BJK Tennis Center\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/#!/event.php?eid=149051131837926\n\nThe United States #1 pro tennis player & ATP World Tour #9 Mardy Fish will appear at the 2011 Atlanta Championships Wilson Kid‚Äôs Day on Sunday July 17th at the Racquet Club of the South.\n\nWilson Racquet Sports is proud to be the Official Ball of the Atlanta Tennis Championships as well as the Official Apparel and Footwear of the tournament. Tournament officials and the ball boys and girls will be outfitted in 2011 Wilson gear.\n\n‚ÄúAtlanta is an outstanding tennis community and we are proud to be part of this years championships,‚Äù said Steve Huber, Wilson Sporting Goods Regional Sales Manager.\n\nFresh off reaching the quarterfinals of Wimbledon, Mardy Fish is ready to defend his title in Atlanta, but will first have a day of tennis with next generation of young American players.
