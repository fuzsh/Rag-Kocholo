        "meta_description": "Neal, Donald J. (Don)   Donald J., age 91, of St. Louis Park, MN., passed away peacefully surrounded by his family on November 20, 2023. He is preceded in death by parents Leona and Albert Neal of Lake Forest, IL, brother Gordon Neal of Winnetka, IL and niece Amy Helck of Colorado and survived by his wife of 63 years, Pat; children Julie Neal (Molly) of Minneapolis, David Neal (Janice) of Denver, CO; grandchildren, Katie Neal of Dallas, TX and Ellie Neal of Santa Clara, CA; nieces Mallory (Marty) Zemelis of Illinois, Carrie Moreland (Rick) of North Carolina; grandnephew Luke Zemelis of Illinois; and extended family and friends.  Born in Lake Forest, IL, Don attended Gorton School, Lake Forest High School and Graduated from Lake Forest College in 1954. After college, Don served in the US Navy on the USS Ingersoll through 1957 when he was honorably discharged. Don's career of 40 plus years was spent in the marine industry serving the upper Midwest in sales management for Outboard Marine Corp.   While work travel was extensive, Don's time with the family while living in Bloomington, Mn (10 yrs) and Elm Grove, Wisconsin (35 yrs) and St. Louis Park (17 yrs) were always most important. Don and Pat also spent a lot of time at their cabin in Sioux Narrows, Ontario on Lake of the Woods to enjoy the wilderness and fish. He was the best fishing guide for family and friends. He always knew where to find the walleye!  Don's love of classical music was always present. He listened to KSJN and his extensive catalog and attended Minnesota, Milwaukee and Chicago Symphony Orchestra concerts. Don was athletic and loved playing and watching sports. He played ice hockey weekly throughout his life until he was 86. He was an avid Wild, Viking, Badger and Brewer fan.   The family would like to thank his special and devoted caregivers at Towerlight in St. Louis Park, Park Nicollet Hospice and Shema Home Care.  Memorial Service 11:00am Thursday, December 28th with visitation beginning at 10:00am at Washburn- McReavy Edina Chapel, 5000 West 50th Street, Edina. Private Interment at Fort Snelling. Memorials preferred to The Minnesota Orchestra.  washburn-mcreavy.com Edina Chapel 952-920-3996",
