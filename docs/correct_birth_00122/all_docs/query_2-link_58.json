        "text": "Since retiring from tennis in 2015, former ATP No. 1 Mardy Fish has largely strayed away from the spotlight. A few interview appearances here and there, Fish — the current captain of the United States Davis Cup team — has had to find a new hobby in his years away from the court.\n\nAnd so he has. Fish has quietly racked up quite the resume as an amateur golfer. This week, he'll put his game to the ultimate test; Fish received special dispensation to take part in this week's PGA Tour event, the 3M Open.\n\nFish isn't the first high-profile athlete to take part in the PGA competition. Three-time American Century Championship winner Tony Romo and NBA superstar Stephen Curry have made appearances on the Tour, although neither was able to make the cut.\n\nFish, a Minnesota native, doesn't plan on competing for the tournament prize. However, he does feel making the cut is a viable target. After all, he's been playing golf all his life.\n\n“I certainly don't expect to compete to win the tournament necessarily, but making the cut is something that I'm eyeing big-time,\" Fish said.\n\nI’ve worked really hard during the last couple of months to get myself into this type of golf shape, long irons into par-4s and long holes and stuff like that. I've played golf my whole life, ever since I could stand, and so you're just hitting a little white ball around.\n\nFish has some work to do to meet that goal after shooting a 10-over 81 in Thursday's opening round, which was tied with Wesley Bryan for the worst round of the day. But there's always Friday.\n\nMORE: 3M Open 2022 betting preview\n\nHere's everything you need to know about Fish's temporary addition to the Tour roster.\n\nWhy is Mardy Fish playing in the 3M Open?\n\nMuch of Fish's involvement in the 2022 3M Open has to do with his Minnesota roots. The 40-year-old is a Minnesota boy through and through; he grew up 30 minutes away from TPC Twin Cities, the site of the 3M Open.\n\n“It’s special that it’s here as well,” Fish said. “I’m born just down the road and spent the first five years of my life here and root for the Vikings and the Twins and the Timberwolves. I didn’t go to college. My dad went to the University of Minnesota, so a lot of roots were laid down here a long time ago.\"\n\nI’m just excited that it’s here and where I’m from and where I was born. And I don’t get to come back very often and so this is a special, certainly a special trip.\n\nThat doesn't mean Fish isn't a force with the club in his hands. Numerous golfers, including Jack Nicklaus himself, have sang praise for Fish and his skill on the course. In fact, it was the Golden Bear who nudged Fish to pursue golf professionally.\n\n“We played nine holes and he drove the ball on every single hole in the middle of the fairway, further than I have seen anybody hit it who is not a professional,” Nicklaus said. “He shot 31 for nine holes. I said, ‘Mardy, what are you doing? You have got a talent and you are young enough to take advantage of it. You need to go play golf.’ ”\n\nFish was taken aback.\n\nNicklaus took his compliment even one step further. In 2019, the 18-time major champion recommended Fish receive a sponsor exemption to play in the 3M Open. He was eventually rebuffed, with tournament director Hollis Cavner opting to chose a pair of former amateurs with a point to prove. Their names? Matthew Wolff (who won the 3M Open title that year) and Collin Morikawa (who finished runner-up).\n\nThat's pretty good company to be in.\n\nTo Fish's credit, he's made his mark on the amateur scene. In 2020, Fish snatched the American Century Championship crown, posting a 63 in the final round to break Lee Trevino's course record.\n\nNow, he has his chance to strut his stuff against the pros. From the court to the course, it seems Fish just has a knack for competition.\n\nTennis players to pursue golf\n\nThere are three certainties in life: Death, taxes and... playing golf when you get older and retire.\n\nFish has certainly made headlines with his 3M Open participation, but he's not the only pro tennis player to trade in his racket for a set of clubs.\n\nAsh Barty\n\nBarty made headlines earlier this year when she retired from the game of tennis to \"chase after other dreams that I've always wanted to...I'm really, really excited.\"\n\nOne of those dreams is the game of golf.\n\nAsh Barty has enjoyed a foray into golf, most recently winning the ladies golf championship at the Brookwater Golf and Country Club in early April just weeks after her tennis retirement.\n\nShe has continued down the golf path.\n\nThe former tennis star participated in the inaugural Icons Series event at the Liberty National course.\n\nShe sports a 4 handicap.\n\nPete Sampras\n\nOne of the most decorated tennis players of all-time, winning 14 Grand Slam titles and 64 singles titles, Sampras sports a 0.5 handicap.\n\nAndy Roddick\n\nThe former No. 1 tennis player not only sports a 1.5 handicap, but he co-owns a golf course, Sweetens Cove Golf Club, with NFL legend Peyton Manning.\n\nRafael Nadal\n\nThe King of Clay sports a 0.3 handicap, Nadal actively participates in celebrity golf tournaments and hosts his own event annually.\n\nRecently, he and his golf team from the Manacor Academy finished in first position at the Qromia Hexagonal Golf Circuit, which was held at the Arabella Golf course.\n\nHe also finished second in the Balearic Mid-Amateur golf championship in 2022.\n\nOther tennis players and their handicaps"
