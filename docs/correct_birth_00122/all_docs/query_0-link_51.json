        "text": "STATELINE – Mark Mulder, who relishes playing in front of packed galleries just like when he played in front of full stadiums as a Major League pitcher, stated his case to claim another title in the American Century Championship celebrity golf tournament at Edgewood Tahoe.\n\nHe won the ACC three straight years (2015-17) and is on top of the leaderboard with 45 points after scoring 25 points in Saturday's second round, to go with 20 on Friday.\n\nMeanwhile, Mardy Fish, who won the tournament in 2020 when no spectators were allowed on the course, proved he also can be a contender when the course is packed with fans.\n\nLeaderboard\n\nMulder said he feeds off having spectators back at full capacity. Fans were allowed in limited numbers in 2021.\n\n\"I love the energy. I love the fans being out there and having them back,\" Mulder said.\n\n\"(Holes) 17 and 18, I hit wedge on both shots. And I'll go home, and I'll never hit a wedge from 190 yards again. That's how much adrenaline I have on 17 and 18. And the ball just goes.\n\n\"These last couple of years, I think that's why it's been very difficult for me to kind of mentally lock into this tournament because there wasn't the same energy. There wasn't the same crowd. So I almost — I was almost distracted out there. I would hit a bad shot and it was like, oh, let's go find it, hit it again, and that was my demeanor.\"\n\nFish scored 27 points in Saturday's round, including an eagle on No. 18, to go with 15 points on Friday to surge up the leaderboard into second place with 42 points.\n\nThe former professional tennis player and current captain of the United States Davis Cup team saw a much different scene Saturday than the past two years. Spectators lined the fairways all along the course, especially packed in around holes No. 16-18.\n\nHe said it seemed like there were 50,000 people in those areas.\n\n\"Certainly the most fans I've ever seen out here or ever in a golf tournament that I've been a part of,\" Fish said.\n\nHe said hole No. 17, which runs next to the beach, can be especially stressful.\n\n\"I told Alfonso (Riberio) when we were out there, I was happy to get it airborne every time on 17. It's pretty nerve-wracking — there's a lot of people out there.\n\n\"Again, we're not here because of our golf. It's something else that we probably did pretty good. And so if I were to play tennis in front of those people, it would be no problem. But golf's a little different. A little more nerve-wracking.\"\n\nFormer Major League pitcher Derek Lowe has 38 points after two rounds, tied with Minnesota Vikings wide receiver Adam Thielen.\n\nLowe said he tries to not take the ACC too seriously.\n\n\"Try to step back and look at your surroundings and be happier here, and obviously we would all love to win and compete. But there's always tomorrow,\" Lowe said.\n\nHe said the tournament has been too quiet the past two years. But on Saturday, he played in the group following Justin Timberlake, Aaron Rodgers and Steph Curry.\n\n\"They had the crowd. We kind of — there's the leftovers, but this is tremendous. This is the biggest event we have, obviously one of the best golfing events you can possibly go to,\" Lowe said.\n\nThielen agreed.\n\n\"It's unbelievable. It's just so good to have a full crowd here. And this tournament is so special. There's nothing better. It's such a special event. And then these fans make it. When they come out to watch a bunch of guys that can't play golf, that's pretty cool.\"\n\nTony Romo, who won the ACC twice, in 2018-19, is tied with Mike Modano, each with 37 points.\n\nNHL standout Joe Pavelski is in the mix near the top the leaderboard with 35 points after two rounds, tied with Annika Sorenstam.\n\nHe scored 22 points in Saturday's second round, thanks to seven birdies, to go with 13 points from Friday and has 35 points heading into Sunday's final round.\n\n\"Just happy to kind of put my name back in there and kind of stay connected to those leaders a little bit, and you never know,\" Pavelski said.\n\nMaking fun of celebrities: The starter in the ACC, who announces the golfers about to begin their rounds, has been having fun with the celebrities, pointing out little-known facts about each.\n\nHere are a few of the facts — and roasts — about the celebrities. Saturday's announcements are first, followed by what he will say before Sunday's rounds begin.\n\nTONY ROMO\n\nHe was a member of the 1998 Racine County All-County Boys Basketball Team after averaging 24, 9 and 5\n\nAt Eastern Illinois, he was the Ohio Valley player of the year and an All-American all three years he was there.\n\nSTEPH CURRY\n\nIn his two MVP seasons, he made more three-pointers than Larry Bird made in his whole career. But last year at the ACC he only made 17 3s — an uncharacteristic 31%.\n\nHe made a name for himself in 2008 at Davidson College, carrying them to the Elite 8. He is still the all-time scoring leader at the school.\n\nCHARLES BARKLEY\n\nIn 1993 his basketball talent was stolen by the nerdlucks in a plot to abduct the Looney Tunes and Michael Jordan.\n\nAccording to Basketball Reference, his nicknames include: The Prince of Pizza, The Incredible Bulk, The Leaning Tower of Pizza, Bread Truck, Boy Gorge, Love Boat, Food World, The Crisco Kid, Wide Load from Leeds, Ton of Fun, The Chuckster, the Chuck Wagon, Sir Charles and the Round Mound of Rebound.\n\nANNIKA SORENSTAM\n\nIn two years at the University of Arizona she won seven titles and became the first freshman to win the D-I championship\n\nTwenty-one years ago she carded the only 59 in LPGA history at Moon Valley Country Club.\n\nMARDY FISH\n\nBorn in Edina, Minnesota, he was featured in a local news segment hitting shots over the net from the baseline at the age of 2.\n\nIn 2007 he created a foundation to provide children with the opportunity to participate in safe and impactful fitness, while empowering them to live healthy and productive lives.\n\nCOLIN JOST\n\nA New York Times best-seller, he has a very punchable face and also won $5,000 on \"The Weakest Link.\"\n\nAfter getting his start on \"Kappa Mikey,\" He is now the longest-tenured Weekend Update anchor in Saturday Night Live history.\n\nNICK JONAS\n\nHe followed up his Hannah Montana debut with the role of Nate Gray in \"Camp Rock\" and \"Camp Rock 2: the Final Jam.\"\n\nFrom Wyckoff, New Jersey, he is the older brother of Tik Tok star Frankie Jonas. Please welcome Jefferson \"Seaplane\" McDonough (his avatar's name in the \"Jumanji\" film franchise).\n\nPATRICK MAHOMES\n\nHe holds the NCAA record for most passing yards in a single game with 734 in 2016.\n\nThere are nine NFL teams who feel pretty dumb for not picking him in the first round of the 2017 NFL Draft.\n\nLARRY THE CABLE GUY\n\nHe got his start on the radio with the Ron & Ron Show and the Bob & Tom Show. His first TV appearance was on \"Caroline’s Comedy Hour.\"\n\nHe stars as Larry Guthrie in \"Tooth Fairy 2,\" just one of the four movies he plays someone named Larry.\n\nDYLAN DREYER\n\nShe is the granddaughter of Doris Milke, a record-setting winner on the original \"Price is Right\" in 1963\n\nShe got her start at WICU-TV in Erie, Pennsylvania, and can now be seen on \"The Today Show.\"\n\nTRAVIS KELCE\n\nBefore making it to the NFL, he had a job as a telemarketer making $8 an hour, and now he has a Reuben named after him.\n\nIn showtime’s \"Moonbase 8\" he plays Travis Kelce, a NASA trainee living on a lunar camp in the U.S. desert. Spoiler alert: He dies in the first episode.\n\nBarkley bet: Multiple sportsbooks are taking wagers on the tournament and a popular wager is that Charles Barkley will finish among the top 70 in the 87-person field.\n\nBarkley, the NBA Hall of Famer and NBA analyst on TNT, is tied for 73rd as he has minus-8 points after two rounds.\n\nCaesars Sportsbook by William Hill opened Barkley at +$5.00 (wager $1 to win $5) to finish among the top 70. The betting public overwhelmingly supported Barkley’s chances, with 96% of the wagers and 95% of the money wagered in favor of him cracking the top 70, according to Caesars.\n\nBarkley earlier in the week said he would finish in the top 70,\n\nThe tournament uses a Stableford scoring system that rewards points for pars, birdies and eagles. Bogeys are worth 0 points, and a double-bogey or worse is minus-2 points.\n\nPlayers are encouraged to pick up their ball once they’ve reached a double bogey.\n\nKorbel Closest to the Pin Challenge: Korbel California Champagne hosted its annual Celebrity Hole-in-One Contest, bringing together 12 players and one Korbel distributor representative all vying for the winning title to benefit the Tahoe Family Resource Center.\n\nSince a hole-in-one was not made, the Closest-to-the-Pin shot won $5,000 for the South Lake Tahoe Family Resource Center.\n\nAlfonso Ribeiro was closest at 3 feet, 3 inches; followed by Joe Pavelski at 4-9.\n\nACC TOURNAMENT AIRTIME\n\nSunday: NBC. Peacock, 11:30 a.m.-3 p.m. PT (Live)\n\nFire rescue program: Tahoe Douglas Fire Protection District fire chief Scott Lindgren is using the ACC to raise awareness for a fire rescue helicopter program he is trying to start.\n\n\"We almost burned this whole place down last year, and we do not have a designated fire rescue helicopter to protect us up here. We drastically need it,\" Lindgren said. \"And we just want to help get the word out what we're trying to do to protect this amazing place from burning down.\"\n\nCharles Barkley is lending his support to the effort. Barkley helped raised funds after the Angora Fire in 2007.\n\n\"I look forward to coming every year. And obviously you guys live here, and I admire and respect what you all do. Fire danger is a really, real issue forever,\" Barkley said. \"You know, I came up here 15 years ago and saw catastrophic damage. It broke my heart. I'd actually never seen fire damage before.\n\n\"I'm glad I brought some awareness to something that's really, really important. Hey, fire danger is not going anywhere. And I'm not going into climate change or whatever, but fire damage is a really, really big deal.\""
