        "meta_description": "Schuster, Gordon Lewis Age 91, of Edina, MN, passed away Friday, July 24. Born Aug. 13, 1918 in Hope, MN to Lillie and Lewis Schuster, he was 1 of 7 siblings: 1 brother and 5 sisters. He is survived by his wife of 64 years, Patricia; sons, Tom and Marty; daughter, Katie; and sisters, Betty Bauer and Shirley Hauritz. He also shared his devotion and affection for family with many grandsons, granddaughters, nieces, nephews, their many children and even one great-granddaughter. Gordon attended and graduated from Owatonna High School and obtained his Associate's Degree from Dunwoody Institute Minneapolis, MN where he became a draftsman in Mechanical Engineering. His career began as a draftsman for King Coil Mattress Co. of Minneapolis followed by designing industrial ovens at Despatch Oven Company, also of Minneapolis. He rose through the ranks at Despatch to become President and subsequently sold out his interest to purchase a fledgling industrial abrasive belt machinery manufacturing company, Timesavers Inc., Crystal, MN consisting of 10 employees in 1958. By 1976, Timesavers had grown to 220 employees with machines being shipped around the world. The company's success for exporting products worldwide won the President's \"E\" Award for exports from the US Department of Commerce. Gordon sold his interest to International Metals and Machines and remained the company's chairman until 1992, retiring at the age of 75. Gordon's passion for hunting grew out of his extensive \"backyard\" hunting near his home in Hope, MN as a young boy where he supplied pheasants, ducks, geese, deer and fish to help feed his family of 9 through the depression years. His adult years of hunting took him to the far reaches of North America and Africa. He documented many of his 100+ big game hunts in his book \"From Hope to Zambezi\" along with many stories of his adventures while hunting Big Horn Sheep, Grizzly Bear, Moose or Elk in North America or Africa's many antelopes or larger more dangerous game. He was an active member of the Safari Club and held several Boon and Crockett record book trophies from his hunts. He felt his most prominent hunting achievement was his 3 Grand Slams of North American Big Horn Sheep. Gordon took several hunting and fishing trips each year, more regionally to locations in the upper Midwest with family and friends. He was known for his generous support of local charities, educational organizations, and wildlife preservation groups. In lieu of flowers, the family requests donations be sent in the name of G.L. Schuster to either of the following foundations: Peggy Atwood Schuster Memorial Fund at Blake School, 110 S. Blake Road, Hopkins, MN 55343, Tel: 952-988-3450 or The Dunwoody College of Technology, Gordon L. Schuster Scholarship Fund 818 Dunwoody Blvd., Minneapolis, MN 55403, Tel: 612-374-5800. Memorial Service 11AM Thursday, July 29 at Christ Presbyterian Church, 6901 Normandale Road, Edina (West 70th St. & Hwy 100). Reception to follow in the Fireside Room. Private Interment at Lakewood Mausoleum. Washburn-McReavy Edina Chapel 952-920-3996",
