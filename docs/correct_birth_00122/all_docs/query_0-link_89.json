One of my “life changing moments” happened the day I asked Dick Sternberg this simple question; “Are you a writer who fishes, or a fisherman who writes?” Sternberg’s answer, “I’m a fisherman who writes,” was all I needed to hear and from that day on, I’ve tried to be like Dick, a fisherman who writes.\n\nSternberg’s career as a writer began after he’d served as a fisheries biologist for the MN DNR, and the list of his accomplishments is a lone one. An icon among freshwater anglers, hall of fame angler and outdoor writer Dick Sternberg has been everywhere and done everything that most anglers could imagine doing. Yesterday, Sternberg, along with his wife Annabelle and our mutual longtime friend Carl Bergquist, shared my boat with me.\n\nMy first fishing trip with Sternberg, arranged by Carl Berguist, happened 20-something years ago.

That part of the plan worked surface conditions on the west side of the lake were favorable. Water temperatures ranged between 76 and 77 degrees, and there was a light algae bloom that helped cut down on water clarity. There was a chop on the surface too, further diminishing water clarity.\n\nThe only problem was that the wind worked against fishing mid-lake structures, which have been the focal point of most recent reports.

The impact of fishing patterns is undeniable and anglers who want to be productive, are forced to make adjustments.

Walleyes following their preferred food source, move in and out with them, appearing in a variety of depths, changing locations from one day to the next.\n\nFor some, the nomadic behavior causes problems because the moving schools of fish are more difficult to âpatternâ. There are some anglers taking advantage of it though, finding small schools of walleye in a wide range of locations, depth ranges and feeding moods.\n\nThe best way to describe their method might be âstalk. locate and fishâ.

With the warm temps, slush has popped up on many area lakes, but has not been much of a issue for anglers.\n\nLake trout fishing was slow but steady for many anglers. Some real quality lakers were caught this last week on ...\" Read >> Ely MN Ice Fishing Report February 7, 2024\n\nJeff Sundin February 5, 2024 \"Lucky, Lucky, Lucky Kids\"\n\nOur kids, Joelle, and Pat were back up at the lake trout hole again this weekend. As you can see, the weather was gorgeous, and they are continuing to dial in the best fishing patterns for catching trout too. It seems like every weekend we get at least a few photos, sometimes we see a lot of them.\n\nLast weekend, Jo came very close to capturing a wall mounter, estimated to be over 25 pounds. That fish broke the line, just below the ice which I’m sure was disappointing now. On the other hand, that fish will be the one that keeps the fire of desire burning. The chase for Mr. Big is on, and will likely continue for a good long time!\n\nJo’s report came in via text message on Sunday evening and starts with; “We were on the ...\" Read >> Lake Trout Fishing Trip February 5, 2024\n\nJeff Sundin February 1, 2024 \"Noting the Note-Able\"\n\nEarlier this week, the Hippie Chick and I were traveling west on Highway 2 near Grand Rapids. On that single trip, we saw more trucks towing wheelhouses than we’d seen on all our other trips, all winter long, combined. The problem is that they were all heading east, heading for home instead of coming this way to go ice fishing. I’m speculating, but it wouldn’t surprise me if for a lot of those folks, the “wheelhouse” ice fishing season was already over for this year.\n\nThe weather outlook for this week in north central Minnesota reminds me of a classic March ice fishing pattern. Overnight, air temperatures dip below freezing, the surface ice on area lakes turns solid and dry. Travel conditions during mornings start off good, then warm afternoon temperatures turn the ...\" Read >> Ice Fishing Update February 1, 2024 Fisheries Plans\n\nLake of the Woods, LOW Tourism January 31, 2024\n\n\"Access to the lake has been expanding and all the resorts and rental operators have either day houses or sleeper fish houses on the ice. Some continue to transport anglers to their rental fish houses; others now offer access to ice roads so there are numerous options for driving yourself. Road rules, fees and weight restrictions vary from site to site, so be sure you communicate with the resort or outfitter you are fishing with and understand their specific weight restrictions when accessing their ice roads.\n\nMost folks who have traveled here had a great week of ice fishing on the south side of Lake of the Woods. Good reports about catching saugers, along with some nice size walleyes came from anglers fishing in several different areas. Most ice fishing on the south end of the lake happens in ...\" Read >> Ice Fishing Report Lake of the Woods January 31, 2024\n\nEly Area, Arrowhead Outdoors Ice Fishing Report January 31, 2024\n\nIce Report\n\nWarm temps have cooled off the ice making process. Little progress was made this last week. 6 to 12 inches of ice is being reported on local lake trout lakes. 12 to 16 inches of ice is being reported on other area lakes. Thanks to warm temps, slush and water on the ice has become very common on area lakes. This issue is expected to grow as water temperatures remain in the forecast.\n\nFishing Report\n\nLake trout fishing remains slow for many anglers. Many of the lakers being caught this last week, were caught with a ...\" Read >> Ely MN Ice Fishing Report January 31, 2024\n\nJeff Sundin January 29, 2024 \"Home Run At The Perch Hole, or Just Another Beautiful Day?\"\n\n\"I wasn’t sure where I wanted to take them, and my “game plan” changed a time or two during preparation. By the time Steve showed up here with the Connick’s, Jake, Andie, Harper and Emmy, I’d decided that perch fishing would offer the best odds of a decent first ice fishing experience. It was not a slam dunk, there were a lot of holes drilled, and we made several moves. But by the time we wrapped up, everyone agreed that the day couldn’t have been better if we’d written the script ahead of time.\n\nIce conditions on the lake were good, there was about 15 inches of solid ice and about 4 inches of snow on top of it. There was just enough snow to make me happy running my snowmobile and Steve’s 4-wheeler breezed through it too. There were a handful of folks driving light pickup trucks, but they ...\" Read >> Grand Rapids Perch Report January 29, 2024\n\nWired2Fish January 25, 2024 \"Best Upgrades for an Older Fishing Boat\"\n\n\"I was unbelievably blessed by the wife and family of a dear friend upon his passing a couple years ago. Iâve written about it before, but Neal Webster was like a grandaddy to me. And when he passed, his wife gave me his 2001 Triton. At the time, I was working hard to payoff a mountainous molehill of debt that I had accrued in a previous life. Which, praise God, is gone now minus whatâs owed on a house and land. So I have an older boat and thought I would share how I make it fish a lot newer with the best upgrades for fishing boats.\n\nIn my earlier effort to payoff my debt, I had gotten rid of my previous newer boat. So, I had no boat of my own at the time. I believe whole heartedly that this boat now is a grace from God as is that family that I didnât deserve, but Iâm oh so thankful for. All this said, my ride has surpassed the legal ...\" Learn More >> Best Upgrades for an Older Fishing Boat\n\nJeff Sundin January 25, 2024 \"Hippie Chick Tops The leader Board\"\n\nWell, we finally found the time, along with a compelling reason to get out on the ice. And as of Wednesday, the Hippie Chick is officially 2 crappies ahead of me for the 2024 fishing season.\n\nMaybe you’re wondering, so, how many did you guys catch altogether yesterday? We caught 2, I mean she caught 2, and I didn’t fish. I know that doesn’t sound very good, but the fishing trip was a lot different than what we’d usually be doing together, and for us the trip was a great success!\n\nWhat we were doing exactly was "
