        "text": "(Agencies)\n\nUpdated: 2004-12-17 09:53\n\nAndy Roddick beat Mardy Fish 6-3, 6-3 in the Minnesota Tennis Challenge exhibition Wednesday night.\n\nRoddick, playing for the first time since firing coach Brad Gilbert over the weekend, was fighting a cold but still managed to win. He said the match was more fun than it was work.\n\n\"You're playing for fun and making a bunch of people laugh,\" he said. \"I feel guilty because I think I actually get more kicks out of it than (the fans) do.\"\n\nBefore the singles match, Fish, born in nearby Edina, paired with Roddick for a doubles match against twins Bob and Mike Bryan, who won 8-6 in a pro set.\n\nFish injured his left wrist in the first set of the singles match but played the second set.\n\n\"It hurts a little bit,\" he said. \"It's a little early to tell how bad it is. We'll see how it feels tomorrow.\"\n\nThe foursome ¡ª on a four-day, three-city bus tour ¡ª have matches in Mobile, Ala., on Friday and Nashville, Tenn., on Saturday. Andre Agassi is scheduled to play with the group on Friday."
