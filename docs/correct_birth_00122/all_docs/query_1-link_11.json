He reviewed the win with our Darren ‘Doogie’ Wolfson, and also talked about his battle vs. anxiety.\n\n***Click the video box on this page to watch our chat with Fish***\n\nThe celebrity tournament was played without fans at Edgewood Tahoe Golf Course because of the coronavirus pandemic. The $600,000 purse and additional money will be donated to organizations supporting COVID-19 relief efforts, the Equal Justice Initiative and Lake Tahoe regional non-profits.\n\nFish birdied the par-5 16th and 18th holes for a 21-point day and 76-point total — nine better than Williams — under the modified Stableford scoring system.\n\nOn Saturday, Fish birdied the final five holes for a course-record 9-under 63 and event-record 37-point round. The left-hander won after finishing in the top five five times in his previous six starts.\n\nFish is the current U.S.A. Davis Cup captain. At one point during his tennis career, he was the highest-ranked U.S. born player."
