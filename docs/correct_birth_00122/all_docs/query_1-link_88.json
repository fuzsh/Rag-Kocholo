His most pleasing Grand Slam results include quarterfinal appearances at the 2007 Australian Open, 2008 U.S. Open, and 2011 Wimbledon Championships. Fish reached the final of the men's singles event at the 2004 Summer Olympic Games but lost to Nicolás Mass.\n\nBackground\n\nMardy Simpson Fish was born on December 9, 1981, in Edina, Minnesota, United States. Tom Fish, the player's father, was a professional tennis trainer, and his mother, Sally, was a stay-at-home mom. He has a sister named Meredith as well.\n\nHe went to Vero Beach High School before moving on to Boca Prep International School. In 1984, when he was two years old, he was photographed playing tennis in his hometown. In 1999, while attending the international school, Simpson resided with Rick's family. They were both members of the same tennis and basketball teams. When he was 14, the player won the Vero Beach City Championships. In adulthood, he won six singles wins and eight doubles titles on the ATP Tour, and he finished sixth in the ATP singles titles ranking list in 2011. The forehand was Mardy Fish's poorest shot throughout his career. Using the forehand strategy to spin the ball over the net was difficult for him. When using the forehand and backhand volleys, though, he barely missed a ball.\n\nCareer Highlights\n\nMardy Fish began playing tennis when she was a student at Boca Prep International School. As a junior, he had a 58-25 singles win/loss record (32-19 in doubles), and he rose to No. 14 in the world (and No. 19 in doubles) in 1999. He went professional in 2002.

He also won the tournament in 2006, defeating eighth seed Juan Mónaco, Rainer Schüttler, Vince Spadea, Tommy Haas, and Jürgen Melzer 3-6, 6-4, 6-3 in the final.

He lost in the second round at Wimbledon to Florian Mayer, 6-7, 6-3, 6-4, 6-4, and he also competed in the Hall of Fame Tennis Championships in Newport, where he won his fourth title and first on grass, defeating Belgian Olivier Rochus in three sets. He lost in the second round of the 2011 Brisbane International against Stepanek, 3-6, 1-6, and then in the second round of the 2011 Australian Open to Tommy Robredo, 6-1, 3-6, 3-6, 3-6.
