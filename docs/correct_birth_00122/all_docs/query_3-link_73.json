        "text": "Wisconsin hockey great Joe Pavelski enters the final round of the 2024 American Century Championship in second place, trailing former professional tennis player Mardy Fish.\n\nThe golf tournament is held on the south course at the Edgewood Tahoe Resort in Lake Tahoe. It includes a star-studded field of current and former athletes, musical artists, actors and more.\n\nRelated: Why Wisconsin football will or won’t break through to College Football Playoff in 2024\n\nPavelsi enters Sunday’s final round with 50 points in the modified Stableford scoring format. Instead of scoring in relation to par, this format rewards 10 points for an albatross, eight points for a hole-in-one, six points for an eagle, three for a birdie, one for a par, zero for a bogey and -2 for a double bogey or worse.\n\nHe trails Fish’s 57 points and leads NFL wide receiver Adam Thielen (45 points), former MLB pitchers Derek Lowe (42) and Mark Mulder (42), LPGA legend Annika Sorenstam (41) and NBA legend Ray Allen (38).\n\nPavelski is currently a free agent after playing the last six years with the Dallas Stars. He has played in the NHL since 2006 after spending two seasons at Wisconsin. The veteran, who leads the NHL in all-time playoff goals by an American-born player, did recently announce that he does not intend to play this upcoming season — though did not use the word ‘retire.’\n\nHe will look to chase down Fish when the leaders tee off on Sunday.\n\nContact/Follow @TheBadgersWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Wisconsin Badgers news, notes and opinion."
