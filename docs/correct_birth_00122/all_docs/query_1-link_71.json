        "text": "Every four years, players across the ATP and WTA Tours get another shot at major glory.\n\nAnd with three grand slams already down in 2024, the Paris Olympics provides that extra shot in the arm as players across the board gun for gold.\n\nThe big names are descending on Roland-Garros for a second time this season, with the famous venue of the French Open playing host to the Olympic tennis tournament.\n\nIga Swiatek and Rafael Nadal, two dominant forces on the Parisian clay, will be in action, while Andy Murray, a two-time Olympic gold medallist, is making his final appearance before retirement.\n\nNovak Djokovic is also set to feature, while Carlos Alcaraz and Coco Gauff will play at their first Olympics, though Jannik Sinner, the men's world number one, has had to withdraw due to illness.\n\nHere, we outline the main storylines ahead of the tournament starting on Saturday.\n\nMurray's last hurrah\n\nThis will be it for Murray. The three-time grand slam champion, and former world number one, is finally bowing out.\n\nThe 37-year-old, who won gold in the men's singles at London 2012 and Rio 2016, as well as claiming silver in the mixed doubles at the first of those Games, confirmed his impending retirement on Tuesday.\n\nMurray is the only man with multiple singles gold medals since tennis returned to the Olympic program in 1988. He will become the first British athlete to appear in four singles draws at the Games, too.\n\nHe is one of just eight players in the Open Era to have won 200 or more matches at majors, while only Nadal, Djokovic and Roger Federer have won more ATP 1000 matches than Murray since the format's introduction in 1990.\n\nThe Scot will bow out as the British player with the most singles titles on the ATP Tour in the Open Era (46).\n\nThe Dream Team\n\nThere are so many stars for fans in Paris to take in, but arguably the main attraction will be the doubles dream team of Nadal and his heir apparent Alcaraz, who are pairing up to represent Spain.\n\nThis team counts the record champion at Roland-Garros (14) in Nadal, and the reigning champion in Alcaraz.\n\nWhile four-time major champion Alcaraz is featuring at his first Olympics, Nadal is a veteran campaigner at the Games, having scooped gold in the singles at Beijing 2008 and in the doubles in Rio eight years ago.\n\nNadal is one of two players to secure an Olympic gold in both the men's singles and doubles since tennis returned to the Olympics in 1988, alongside Nicolas Massu (both at Athens 2004).\n\nLike Murray, Nadal is set to bow out in the coming months, and what better way to go than winning gold with the player who could well go on to match his feats?\n\nNadal's great rival Djokovic, meanwhile, will surely also be playing at his final Games.\n\nDjokovic will become the player with the joint-most appearances in men's singles at the Olympics (five, equalling Yen Hsun Lu) since the sport returned to the Games 36 years ago.\n\nThe Serbian is the player with the most matches played (19) and joint-most matches won (13, level with Federer) at the Olympics since 1988.\n\nSwiatek's Roland-Garros return\n\nWomen's world number one Swiatek loves Roland-Garros just as much as Nadal does.\n\nFour of the 23-year-old's five grand slam titles have come at the venue, including her success earlier this year. In fact, Swiatek has won four of the past five French Open titles.\n\nSwiatek lost in the second round in Tokyo, but given her dominance in Paris in recent years, she has to be considered the favourite in the women's draw.\n\nIndeed, only Margaret Court (95.2%) has a higher winning percentage at Roland-Garros than Swiatek (94.6%) in the Open Era.\n\nThat being said, the incumbent world number one has won gold at the Olympics only twice: Steffi Graf in 1988 and Justine Henin in 2004.\n\nAryna Sabalenka rivalled Swiatek throughout this season's clay-court swing. The Belarusian, who will be competing under a neutral banner, lost in the second round in Tokyo three years ago.\n\nGauff flying the flag\n\nThere was heartbreak for Gauff three years ago, as she missed out on what would have been her maiden Games after testing positive for COVID-19.\n\nAll being well, that won't be an issue this time around, and the 20-year-old will have the honour of bearing the United States flag at Friday's opening ceremony. She will be the first tennis player to fly the flag for Team USA.\n\nGauff, the world number two, has reached the quarters, the final, the quarters again and the semi-finals in her last four appearances at the French Open - will she finally break her Roland-Garros duck?\n\nIf she does, then Gauff will join Graf (1988), Jennifer Capriati (1992), Lindsay Davenport (1996) and Venus Williams (2000) as the women to win Olympic gold before turning 21.\n\nFormer world number one Naomi Osaka, who lit the torch in Tokyo, should not be discounted either.\n\nShe is looking to become the second Japanese player to secure an Olympic medal since tennis' return to the Games, after Kei Nishikori's bronze in Rio.\n\nOlympic silver medallist Laura Muir described fellow Team GB member Andy Murray as \"inspirational\" ahead of the Paris Games.\n\nMuir, who came second in the 1,500m in Tokyo three years ago, will again compete this year in the hopes of sealing a first gold medal in Paris.\n\nThree-time grand slam winner Murray has confirmed he will retire from tennis after the Games, having previously won gold on two occasions.\n\nThe Scot's first Games appearance was in Beijing in 2008, losing in straight sets to Lu Yen-hsun in the first round.\n\nFour years later, Murray triumphed on home soil by beating Roger Federer at London 2012, beating the Swiss in straight sets in the final.\n\nThe Briton became the first male tennis player to win two Olympic singles titles when he beat Argentina's Juan Martin del Potro at Rio 2016.\n\nMurray withdrew from the singles event at the most recent grand slam at Wimbledon, competing in the doubles alongside brother Jamie but going out in the first round.\n\nDan Evans will partner Murray in the doubles in Paris, with Muir praising the Scot's influence both on and off the court across his 19-year professional career.\n\n\"I think it's just he's been at the top for so long, and it's just been so nice to see him progress through everything,\" Muir told Stats Perform.\n\n\"He's had so many hard times and he's come back and he's fought so hard and he's been so patient and such a big sportsmanship person at the same time.\n\n\"I think he's just hugely inspirational, not just in the sport of tennis but through Scottish sports and also lots of other sports on the team as well.\n\n\"Just to see someone fight for so long and do so well, it's been so nice to see.\n\n\"So it'll be such a shame that we won't see more of him to come, but it's just so nice to be able to finish it with the Olympics - he's hugely inspirational person both on and off the court.\"\n\nFellow 1,500m hopeful Jake Wightman, who finished 10th at the Tokyo games, echoed Muir's words on Murray's glittering career.\n\n\"I think probably him winning Wimbledon for the first time is like a iconic moment within my sporting history, just because I'd watched Wimbledon most years and never seen a Brit perform anywhere near that level,\" Wightman told Stats Perform.\n\n\"You'd obviously had Tim Henman going to a certain point, but it had been an era of just watching [Rafael] Nadal and Federer for a long time battling it out.\n\n\"So to see somebody in Britain, a British athlete, being able to go and do that was, I think, something that we may not see for a long time.\""
