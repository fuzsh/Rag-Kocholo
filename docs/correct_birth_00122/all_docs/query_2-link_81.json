        "text": "American former tennis pro Mardy Fish will trade the racquet for the driver this weekend, as he becomes the first-ever man to play on both the PGA and ATP tours.\n\nThe 40-year-old has received a sponsor's exemption to take to the course at the 3M Open in Minneapolis, which begins on Thursday.\n\n\"No one's ever played an ATP and PGA Tour event before,\" Fish told Tennis.com.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nREAD MORE: Eye-watering amount 'cashed up bogan' Cameron Smith has won\n\nREAD MORE: Kangaroos selection tussle causing headaches\n\nREAD MORE: 'Sore losers' a stain on epic Origin finale\n\n\"It's special that it's here as well; I was born just down the road. This is certainly a special trip.\"\n\nFish had excelled in celebrity events in recent years, and was once called \"the best non-professional golfer I have ever seen play\" by the legendary Jack Nicklaus.\n\n\"We played nine holes and he drove the ball on every single hole in the middle of the fairway, further than I have seen anybody hit it who is not a professional,\" Nicklaus said in a 2018 interview.\n\n\"I said, 'Mardy, what are you doing? You have got a talent and you are young enough to take advantage of it. You need to go play golf.'\"\n\nFish's most-recent outing was at the celebrity American Century Championship, where he finished in sixth place.\n\nFormer Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo won the event after a play-off, beating former MLB pitcher Mark Mulder and Dallas Stars NHL forward Joe Pavelski.\n\nFish won that event in 2020, jumping into Lake Tahoe in celebration."
