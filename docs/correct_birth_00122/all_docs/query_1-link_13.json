        "text": "Great story of courage, Congratulations Fish. Big respect for a huge talented player..... All the best to you Mardy! You're a great guy and we've missed seeing you play on the tour. Kudos for all it has taken you to return and enjoy tennis and life in general again. Great performance on your match after a long while, Mardy. Welcome back. Looking forward to your next tournament. Thank you, Mardy Fish for being a much-needed role model for those people dealing with mental/anxiety disorders! Bravo to your comeback! Nice, tough guy. No doubt. His personal win is more important than winning, say, 17 slams. You are the hero. You set a GREAT model to my two children. Good luck and have fun on courts. So very happy to see Mardy back on the court. He is by far my most favorite American tennis player. It was a joy to watch him. I wish him only the best for his life on and off the court. But hope it is on the court. Congratulations Mardy on your journey back. Wishing good health and many more matches to Mardy Fish! :) The best for Mardy Fish after struggling so hard !! He is a great player and person! Respect! Well done Mardy. Don't give up and keep on having fun. All the best for your full comeback. A great story but not only a great story, a great tennis player! Massive talent and great player; it's great to see him back :) Only folk who have been to despair and back can understand how he felt and the guts and strength it takes to fight back. Full of admiration. Respect Mardy! Go for it! I have always liked Mardy Fish. My husband suffers from atrial fibrillation and I have great admiration for the way Mardy has fought his ill health and his demons to return to the tour. My very best wishes go out to him and I hope he continues to play. With Fish back maybe the US Davis Cup will have a chance next year."
