        "text": "The former top-10 player Mardy Fish has pulled out of the US Open, which begins in New York on Monday. The withdrawal is Fish's latest setback in his bid to make a comeback on tour after dealing with heart issues. The US Tennis Association said the 31-year-old American cited \"personal reasons\" for his withdrawal. The draw for the year's last grand slam tournament will be made on Thursday.\n\nOn Wednesday, Fish's Twitter feed carried this message: \"Friends, unfortunately my health won't allow me to compete this year at the US Open. Thank you for all your support.\"\n\nFish has missed months of action at a time over the past two seasons. On Tuesday, he stopped playing in the third set of his match against Jarkko Nieminen at a hard-court tournament in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, because of heat stroke. He has played only eight matches on the ATP World Tour in 2013, winning three and losing five. He has not played at a grand slam tournament this season, and he has entered only five other events on the main tour.\n\nA year ago, Fish reached the fourth round at the US Open but withdrew before he was to face Roger Federer, saying it was for \"precautionary measures\", on doctor's orders. Fish missed about two and a half months earlier last season because of an accelerated heartbeat. The night after he lost a match at Key Biscayne, Florida in March 2012, Fish's heart started racing uncontrollably. That May, doctors induced extreme palpitations to try to pinpoint the problem. He returned for last year's Wimbledon.\n\nDuring a hard-court tournament in Washington earlier this month, Fish spoke about the difficulties he's faced the last two seasons.\n\n\"I struggled mightily during the US Open last year. So those sort of post-traumatic experiences that I've had that I have now are what I need to get over right now,\" he said. \"But it's a process. It's not an easy game. And fitness is as big a part of it as playing, and sometimes that's trouble spells trouble for me.\"\n\nAsked then whether his heart or mind is the source of greater problems, Fish replied: \"It's a little bit of both. A lot of it's mental, what I went through, and obviously a little bit of it was physical, too. I can't say it any differently than: It's just going to be a day-to-day thing right now.\"\n\nFish, who was born in Minnesota and now lives in Los Angeles, reached a career-best ranking of No 7 in 2011; he is 173rd this week. He is a three-time grand slam quarter-finalist â€“ once each at the US Open, Wimbledon and the Australian Open. His most recent appearance in a last eight came at Flushing Meadows in 2011."
