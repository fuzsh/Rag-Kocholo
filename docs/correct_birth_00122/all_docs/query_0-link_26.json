        "text": "City in Minnesota, United States\n\nCity in Minnesota, United States\n\nEdina ( ee-DY-nə, ih-DY-nə)[8] is a city in Hennepin County, Minnesota, United States and a first-ring suburb of Minneapolis. The population was 53,494 at the 2020 census,[3] making it the 18th most populous city in Minnesota.\n\nEdina began as a small farming and milling community along Minnehaha Creek in the 1860s and became one of Minneapolis's first incorporated suburbs in 1888. After years of being a streetcar suburb, Edina saw expanded development as a car-centric suburb in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nThe city is known for its shopping, parks, and high quality of life and also plays host to the nation's oldest indoor mall, the Southdale Center.[9][10][11]\n\nEdina began as part of Richfield Township, Minnesota. By the 1870s, 17 families, most of them immigrating as a result of the Great Famine of Ireland, had come to Minnesota and claimed land in the southwest section of what was then Richfield Township.[13] They were followed by settlers from New England and Germany, who claimed additional land near Minnehaha Creek.[14] The Baird and Grimes neighborhoods (which are both listed on the National Register of Historic Places) and the Country Club District (then known as Waterville Mills) in the northeast part of Edina were among the first areas to be established. The area then known as the Cahill Settlement, at West 70th Street and Cahill Road, was also an early community center and the home of Cahill School.[15]\n\nIn 1888, the residents of the township held a meeting to consider founding a new village, thus separating themselves from Richfield Township. The idea was favorably accepted by those within the community and a committee was established to oversee the transition.[16]\n\nAfter the decision was made to form a new village, a debate ensued regarding the naming of the new village. Several town meetings were held in the Minnehaha Grange Hall, during which the names Hennepin Park, Westfield and Edina were suggested. Minutes taken by Henry F. Brown, a farmer and future owner (1889) of the Edina Mill, are summarized as follows:\n\nA long debate ensued with regard to the name by which the corporation shall be called. A motion was made and passed to reconsider the vote taken at the previous meeting of the name of the proposed village, Westfield. Another motion was then made by Andrew Craik to call the proposed village Edina (upon moving to the township in 1869 from Edinburgh, he bought and renamed the mill to the Edina Mill). Before the motion could be decided, James A. Bull, a member of the five person committee, made another motion to adjourn, which was seconded by the majority. However, the chairman of the meeting called this motion out of order, at which time disorder ensued with Baird, Wilson, Ryan and Bull declaring their intent to no longer serve as members of the committee if a gag law was to prevail. During this heated moment the meeting became somewhat boisterous until, after a few minutes order was restored. Seeing that no more work could be done at this time, a final motion was made and passed to reschedule the meeting to a future date.[17]\n\nAt the next meeting, the name Edina was finally chosen with a vote of 47 for and 42 against.[16]\n\nThere has been a prevailing myth about the decision to name the new village Edina, which states that two opposing communities—the Irish Cahill community and the Scottish Mill community—fought about whether to give the community an Irish name (Killarney Lakes) or a Scottish name (Edina). The 1860 census, however, indicates that there were no Scottish people in Edina in 1860, and only a couple were present at the time of Edina's founding (1888).[14]\n\nThe name \"Edina\" may also come from the language of the nearby Dakota tribe. The word Dakota: Idéna means \"to catch fire.\"[18]\n\nMain article: Morningside, Minnesota\n\nThe first suburban development in Edina occurred during the early 1900s in Morningside, a neighborhood in the northeastern part of the village. As Morningside grew, conflict arose between its residents who wanted more city services, and the residents of the rest of the village who wanted to maintain Edina's rural character. As a result of that conflict, Morningside seceded from Edina in 1920 and became a separate village.[19] In 1966, however, the Village of Morningside once again became part of Edina.[20]\n\nEdina was not the first settlement in its location. According to historian Deborah Morse-Kahn, the Quaker village that existed where Edina would be built included African American families of Civil War veterans and freed slaves \"became very involved in community life—especially as farmland owners, civic and cultural leaders.\"[21] At the November 1898 general election, J. Frank Wheaton, a Republican African American, was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives representing District 42, which included all of Edina. Wheaton beat his white Democratic opponent in every Minneapolis city ward and in every village within the legislative district, including Edina, even though the legislative district had only approximately 100 African American residents out of a total of 40,000 residents.[22]\n\nIn the early 20th century suburban development brought discriminatory policies that led to nearly all of the African Americans who had been living in Edina to move away.\n\nHistorian James W. Loewen described the suburb as a sundown town.[23][24][25] Researchers point in particular to Samuel Thorpe's development of the Country Club Historic District, which used deed restrictions as means to exclude non-whites, stating explicitly that:\n\nNo lot shall ever be sold, conveyed, leased, or rented to any person other than one of the white or Caucasian race, nor shall any lot ever be used or occupied by any person other than one of the white or Caucasian race, except such as may be serving as domestics for the owner or tenant of said lot, while said owner or tenant is residing thereon.[21][25][26][27][28]\n\n— James W. Loewen, Sundown Towns: A Hidden Dimension of American Racism\n\nOther developments, like that built by N. P. Dodge Corporation just a mile away, followed suit in attempting to protect land values through racial policies.[29] Though the Supreme Court ruled these kinds of discriminatory housing clauses unenforceable in its Shelley v. Kraemer decision of 1948, reports of discrimination persisted through the 1950s and 1960s.[21][30] According to the Edina Historical Society's story about the first black family in Morningside (then a separate village) in 1960, attempts to keep them out included tactics like trying \"to get [their] lot condemned for drainage.\"[30] In response, then-mayor Ken Joyce wrote a note dismissing the drainage concern and challenging citizens \"to live the Golden Rule\". Shortly thereafter the village voted in favor of inclusion.[30]\n\nJewish residents were also affected by exclusionary deed covenants. In the 1960s, some residents boasted that Edina had \"Not one Negro and not one Jew.\"[31]\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 15.97 square miles (41.36 km2), of which 15.45 square miles (40.02 km2) is land and 0.52 square miles (1.35 km2) is water.[32] Residential areas comprise the largest portion of the City, which is now more than 95 percent developed.\n\nWithin Edina are many different neighborhoods; Highlands, Indian Hills, Morningside, Country Club District, Cahill Village, Chapel Hill, South Harriet Park, Interlachen, Rolling Green, Presidents, Sunnyslope, White Oaks, Parkwood Knolls, Braemar Hills, Birchcrest, Dewey Hill and Hilldale.[33]\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 1890531—190074941.1%19101,10147.0%19201,83366.5%19303,13871.2%19405,85586.6%19509,74466.4%196030,482212.8%197044,03144.4%198046,0734.6%199046,0750.0%200047,4252.9%201047,9411.1%202053,49411.6%2022 (est.)52,437[4]−2.0%\n\nEdina, Minnesota - Demographic Profile\n\n(NH = Non-Hispanic) Race / Ethnicity Pop 2000[35] Pop 2010[36] Pop 2020[37] % 2000 % 2010 % 2020 White alone (NH) 44,367 41,535 42,158 93.55% 86.64% 78.81% Black or African American alone (NH) 527 1,424 1,892 1.11% 2.97% 3.54% Native American or Alaska Native alone (NH) 61 78 91 0.18% 0.16% 0.17% Asian alone (NH) 1,408 2,914 4,809 2.97% 6.08% 8.99% Pacific Islander alone (NH) 11 16 7 0.02% 0.03% 0.01% Some Other Race alone (NH) 48 88 231 0.10% 0.18% 0.43% Mixed Race/Multi-Racial (NH) 464 785 2,304 0.98% 1.64% 4.31% Hispanic or Latino (any race) 539 1,101 2,002 1.14% 2.30% 3.74% Total 47,425 47,941 53,494 100.00% 100.00% 100.00%\n\nNote: the US Census treats Hispanic/Latino as an ethnic category. This table excludes Latinos from the racial categories and assigns them to a separate category. Hispanics/Latinos can be of any race.\n\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 47,941 people, 20,672 households, and 12,918 families residing in the city. The population density was 3,103.0 inhabitants per square mile (1,198.1/km2). There were 22,560 housing units at an average density of 1,460.2 per square mile (563.8/km2). The racial makeup of the city was 88.1% White, 3.0% African American, 0.2% Native American, 6.1% Asian, 0.7% from other races, and 1.8% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino residents of any race were 2.3% of the population.[38]\n\nThere were 20,672 households, of which 29.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 53.7% were married couples living together, 6.4% had a female householder with no husband present, 2.3% had a male householder with no wife present, and 37.5% were non-families. 33.1% of all households were made up of individuals, and 18% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.31 and the average family size was 2.98.\n\nThe median age in the city was 45.2 years. 24.2% of residents were under the age of 18; 4.5% were between the ages of 18 and 24; 21% were from 25 to 44; 29.6% were from 45 to 64; and 20.7% were 65 years of age or older.

The median value of owner-occupied housing units was $424,500.\n\nEdina hosts Venkateswara Temple, a Hindu Temple, for the over 40,000 Hindus residing in the Minneapolis-St Paul area.\n\nChrist Presbyterian Church is a congregation within ECO: A Covenant Order of Evangelical Presbyterians with 5,388 members in 2012.[39] CPC was founded in 1956. During Roger Anderson's ministry, the church began to grow rapidly. CPC became the largest Presbyterian congregation in the upper Midwest,[40] and one of the largest Presbyterian churches in the nation, with membership passing 1,700. The former senior pastor,[41] John Crosby, led CPC to be a congregation of over 5,000. In 2006, the church celebrated the 50th anniversary.[42] The church was a leader in the movement to establish ECO as a breakaway movement from the Presbyterian Church (USA).[43]\n\nEdina Community Lutheran Church (ECLC) is a progressive Lutheran congregation within the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America that was founded in Edina on September 23, 1948 and has been a Reconciling in Christ congregation since 1985. In September 2023, the Church celebrated the 75th anniversary of its founding.[44] A ECLC June 25, 2023 Sunday service live stream went viral online when during the Sunday service co-pastor Anna Helgen lead the congregation in a “sparkle creed” prayer in honor of LGBT Pride Month in which God is described as “nonbinary” and Jesus as having “two dads.”[45]\n\nEdina serves as headquarters for several large companies: Jerry's Foods, Lund Food Holdings, Edina Realty, Regis Corporation,[46] Dairy Queen,[47] and Orange Julius.[48]\n\nThe town's most notable shopping centers are Southdale Center,[49] Galleria Edina, and 50th & France, which is shared with Minneapolis.\n\nAccording to the city's Comprehensive Annual Financial Report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, the top ten largest employers in the city are: Fairview Southdale Hospital, Edina Public Schools, the City of Edina, BI Worldwide, Regis, Barr Engineering, Lund Food Holdings, International Dairy Queen Inc., SunOpta, Edina Realty, and FilmTec Corporation, respectively.[50]\n\nDue in part to its strong boys and girls ice hockey programs, Edina was named by ESPN in 2020 as the \"center of the center\" of the American ice hockey universe.[51] Since 2016, Edina's Braemar Ice Rink has hosted Da Beauty League, a 4-on-4 ice hockey league with rosters made up of current NHL, AHL, ECHL, and college hockey players wishing to maintain their offseason playing shape.[52]\n\nIn December 1979, the first bandy game in the USA was played at Lewis Park Bandy Rink in Edina. It was a friendly game between the Swedish junior national team and Swedish club team Brobergs IF.[53]\n\nEdina's parkland and open space total more than 1,550 acres (6.3 km2). The Edina Park and Recreation Department oversees 44 parks, which include amenities such as baseball, football and soccer fields; softball diamonds; basketball and tennis courts; outdoor skating rinks; playground equipment for young children; and picnic shelters. The Department also maintains eight miles (13 km) of scenic pathways for bicycling, walking, jogging, cross-country skiing and snowshoeing.[54]\n\nBesides overseeing the parks, the Edina Park & Recreation Department is also responsible for the operation of 10 arts, community, and recreation facilities within the city including Braemar Golf Course, Braemar Ice Rink, Centennial Lakes Park, and Edinborough Park.\n\nThree Rivers Park District, Hennepin County's regional park board, operates the Nine Mile Creek Regional Trail through Edina.[55]\n\nTwo prominent Twin Cities waterways, Minnehaha Creek and Nine Mile Creek, make their way through Edina on their ways to the Mississippi and Minnesota Rivers respectively. Both are sites for major regional parks and trails.\n\nThere are two country clubs located in Edina, the Edina Country Club and the Interlachen Country Club.\n\nMain article: Edina Public Schools\n\nEdina Public Schools is the public school district (ISD 273) that serves Edina. It enrolls approximately 8,500 K–12 students[56] and is served by 1,139 teachers and support staff.[57]\n\nEdina has one high school, Edina High School. The area is served by two middle schools: (South View Middle School and Valley View Middle School) and six elementary schools (Concord, Creek Valley, Cornelia, Highlands, Countryside, and Normandale).\n\nThere are three private schools in Edina: Our Lady of Grace Catholic School, Golden Years Montessori, and Avail Academy-Edina Campus.\n\nThe Minnesota State University, Mankato satellite campus.\n\nMany major highways run through or are close to Edina, making it readily accessible to those within the metropolitan area. Minnesota State Highways 62 and 100 divide the City into four sections. U.S. Route 169 and Minnesota State Highway 100 extend north and south. Interstate 494 and Minnesota State Highway 62 extend east and west.[58]\n\nBefore streetcar service was abandoned in 1954, the Twin City Rapid Transit Company's Lake Minnetonka Line went through Edina paralleling 44th Street on dedicated right-of-way. After streetcar service was abandoned, the right-of-way was developed as single family housing. [citation needed]\n\nMetro Transit, the Twin Cities regional transit authority, operates daytime buses in Edina, primarily along France Avenue and through business parks along Interstate 494.[59] Edina's Southdale Transit Center is one of the southwest Twin Cities primary transit hubs.\n\nThe E Line, an arterial BRT route, is currently planned to travel from the University of Minnesota through Downtown Minneapolis and Uptown to the Southdale Transit Center in Edina. It is expected to be operational by 2026.[60]\n\nThe Dan Patch Line and successor Minneapolis, Northfield and Southern Railway operated interurban service through Edina until 1942. Although in poor condition and rated for speeds less than 35 mph, the tracks are still used by freight trains. Under the Dan Patch Corridor proposal, commuter trains would operate between Minneapolis and Northfield with a station in Edina. A feasibility study was conducted in 2000 and found that ridership would be high but there would be a significant cost to upgrade the corridor for commuter trains. Due to this and strong opposition from residents living near the rail line, the proposal was put on hold until other commuter rail lines could be built. In 2002 a legislative gag order was placed on the project, which forbid the Metropolitan Council, MnDOT, and county rail authorities from discussing, studying, and building commuter rail on the Dan Patch Line.[61] In 2017 the Edina City Council conducted a study on the pros and cons of passenger rail on the Dan Patch Line. The conclusion was to not pursue passenger rail at that time (as of 2018). The legislativ gag order was repealed by the Minnesota Legislature on May 21, 2023.\n\nThe following is a list of notable people who were either born in, lived in, are current residents of, or are otherwise closely associated with the city of Edina:\n\nThe interior of a 1950s rambler in Edina's Highlands neighborhood was used in the Coen brothers' 2009 film A Serious Man.[108]\n\nLead singer Craig Finn from the band The Hold Steady is from Edina and has made several allusions to the town in their songs. [109]For example, the song \"Hornets! Hornets!\" from the album Separation Sunday describes a wild night in the town, ending with the line \"I drove the wrong way down 169 and almost died up by Edina High\".[110] Also, the song's title is a reference to Edina High School's mascot, the Hornet.[111]\n\nIn the movie D2: The Mighty Ducks, star forward Adam Banks, when asked his name and where he is from, introduces himself as \"Adam Banks Edina, Minnesota\".[citation needed]\n\nIn the movie Jingle All the Way, some of the exterior house scenes were shot in Edina's Brucewood neighborhood, near Arden Park.[citation needed]\n\nPart of the 1994 movie Little Big League was shot at one of Countryside Park's baseball diamonds.[112] The umpire wears an Edina Athletic Association T-shirt."
