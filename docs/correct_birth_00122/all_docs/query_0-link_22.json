He was out of the top 100 in the world rankings earlier this year but has jumped up to number 35, thanks to an 11-match winning streak and earning the title at his last two tournaments.\n\n\"Yeah, I mean this is the longest match winning streak I've had. You know, I just sort of want to â€“ desperate to keep it going,\" he said."
