        "text": "Mardy Fish has won three tournaments on the main ATP Tour, and has reached the final of two Masters Series events: Cincinnati in 2003, and Indian Wells in 2008.\n\nHis best result at a Grand Slam tournament came at the 2007 Australian Open, where he reached the quarter-finals before losing to compatriot Andy Roddick, and the 2008 US Open, where he also reached the quarter-finals before losing to World No. 1 Rafael Nadal. His biggest win in singles came when he defeated the then World No. 1 Roger Federer at the Pacific Life Open in 2008.\n\nFish uses his strong serve and powerful backhand to win points from the baseline. He would often move around the court and find his way to the net to put away a ball by volleying. In short, he is an all-court player."
