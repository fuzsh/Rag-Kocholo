        "text": "Edina (i /iːˈdaɪnə/ ee-DY-nə) is a city in Hennepin County, Minnesota, United States, and a first-ring suburb situated immediately southwest of Minneapolis. Edina began as a small farming and milling community in the 1860s. The population was 47,941 at the 2010 census.[1]\n\nGeography[]\n\nMany major highways run through or are close to Edina, making it readily accessible to those within the metropolitan area. Minnesota State Highways 62 and 100 divide the City into four sections. U.S. Route 169 and Minnesota State Highway 100 extend north and south. Interstate 494 and Minnesota State Highway 62 extend east and west. Minnesota State Highway 7 is within three miles (5 km) of the city. Interstate 394 is within five miles (8 km).\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 16.0 square miles (41.5 km²). 15.8 square miles (40.8 km²) of it is land and 0.3 square miles (0.8 km²) of it (1.87%) is water. Residential areas comprise the largest portion of the City, which is now more than 95 percent developed. Within Edina are many different neighborhoods, including Highlands, Indian Hills, Viking Hills, Morningside, Country Club District, Cahill Village, South Harriet Park, Interlachen, Rolling Green, Sunnyslope, White Oaks, Parkwood Knolls, Dewey Hill and Hilldale.\n\nDemographics[]\n\nAs of the census[2] of 2000, there were 47,425 people, 20,996 households, and 12,870 families residing in the city. The population density was 3,011.4 inhabitants per square mile (1,162.6/km²). There were 21,669 housing units at an average density of 1,376.0 per square mile (531.2/km²). The racial makeup of the city was 94.28% White, 1.15% African American, 0.13% Native American, 2.99% Asian, 0.04% Pacific Islander, 0.35% from other races, and 1.07% from two or more races.

In the 1850s, 17 families, most of them immigrating as a result of the potato famine in Ireland, came to Minnesota and claimed land in the southwest section of what was then Richfield Township. They were followed by English and Scottish farmers, who claimed additional land near Minnehaha Creek. The Baird and Grimes and Country Club Districts (both which are listed on the National Register of Historic Places), are located in the northeast part of Edina and were among the first areas to be established.\n\nIn 1888, the residents of the township held a meeting to consider founding a new village, thus separating themselves from Richfield Township. The idea was favorably accepted by those within the community and a committee was established to oversee the transition.\n\nNaming[]\n\nAfter the decision was made to form a new village, a debate ensued regarding the naming of the new village. Several town meetings were held in the Minnehaha Grange Hall, during which the names \"Hennepin Park\", \"Westfield\" and \"Edina\" were suggested. Minutes taken by Henry F. Brown, a farmer and future owner (1889) of the Edina Mill, are summarized as follows:[4]\n\n“ A long debate ensued with regard to the name by which the corporation shall be called. A motion was made and passed to reconsider the vote taken at the previous meeting of the name of the proposed village, Westfield. Another motion was then made by Andrew Craik to call the proposed village Edina (upon moving to the township in 1869 from Edinburgh, he bought and renamed the mill to the Edina Mill). Before the motion could be decided, James A. Bull, a member of the five person committee, made another motion to adjourn, which was seconded by the majority. However, the chairman of the meeting called this motion out of order, at which time disorder ensued with Baird, Wilson, Ryan and Bull declaring their intent to no longer serve as members of the committee if a gag law was to prevail. During this heated moment the meeting became somewhat boisterous until, after a few minutes order was restored. Seeing that no more work could be done at this time, a final motion was made and passed to reschedule the meeting to a future date. ”\n\nAt the next meeting, the name Edina was finally chosen with a vote of 47 for and 42 against.\n\nThere has been a prevailing myth about the decision to name the new village Edina, which states that two opposing communities—the Irish Cahill community and the Scottish Mill community fought about whether to give the community an Irish Name (Killarney Lakes) or a Scottish name (Edina). The 1860 census, however, indicates that there were no Scottish people in Edina in 1860, and only a couple were present at the time of Edina's founding (1888).\n\nMorningside[]\n\nThe first suburban development in Edina occurred during the early 1900s in Morningside, a neighborhood in the northeastern part of the village. As Morningside grew, conflict arose between its residents, who wanted more city services, and the residents of the rest of the village, who wanted to maintain Edina's rural character. As a result of that conflict, Morningside seceded from Edina in 1920 and became a separate village. In 1966, however, the Village of Morningside once again became part of Edina.\n\nEdina today[]\n\nToday, many of the street names in Edina are named after families whose farms once occupied that area, for example: Grimes Avenue, Code Avenue, Gleason (Gleeson) Road, Cooper Avenue and Wyman Avenue.\n\nEdina has a reputation for being one of the most affluent suburbs of Minneapolis.[5] Edina citizens are considered wealthy (e.g. median household income for 1999 in Edina was $66,019,[6] compared to $37,974 for Minneapolis and $47,111 for the state of Minnesota),[7] which led to the once derogatory term of \"cake eaters\" (a reference to the \"Let them eat cake\" quote misattributed to Marie Antoinette). The term is now largely used in jest in regional sports rivalries. Such usage can be seen, for example, in the Disney film, The Mighty Ducks, in which the term is used in reference to the Adam Banks character. Up until the 1960s, the name \"cake eater\" had been attributed to the Washburn (Minneapolis) Millers, a high school located in a prosperous neighborhood of nearby Minneapolis. Additionally, popular culture in Minnesota references that Edina is an acronym for the phrase \"Every Day I Need Attention\" once again referencing the stereotypical Edina resident as somewhat wealthy and aloof.\n\nEdina is home to some billionaires, most notably Richard M. Schulze and the late Carl Pohlad.[8][9]\n\nEducation[]\n\nPublic schools[]\n\nFor a detailed article see Edina Public Schools\n\nMost of Edina is in Independent School District (ISD) 273, which serves children primarily from Edina. There are approximately 7500 K-12 students served by 1139 teachers and support staff in six elementary schools (Grades K-5), two middle schools (Grades 6–9), and one senior high school (Grades 10–12). The district administrative offices are located at the Edina Community Center.\n\nEdina High School is often listed in the top 100 schools in the United States in academics (most recently in Newsweek, 2005).[10] A recent study showed that 85% of EHS students graduate, that 85% of EHS grads go to college and that 85% of Edina High School graduates completed college within 5 yrs after high school graduation.[11] A recent follow-up study showed that ten years after graduation from Edina High School 43% of EHS graduates had obtained advanced postgraduate degrees or were pursuing graduate degrees at the time of the study.\n\nPublic Schools in Edina Elementary Schools Junior High Schools High School Concord South View Middle School Edina High School Creek Valley Valley View Middle School Cornelia Highlands Countryside Normandale French Immersion\n\nPrivate schools[]\n\nThere are three private schools in Edina. Our Lady of Grace (OLG), which is a Catholic school that serves students from kindergarten through eighth grade, St. Peters Lutheran School, and Calvin Christian School.\n\nColleges[]\n\nCardinal Stritch University, Devry University, Minnesota State University, Mankato education site, Minnesota School of Business, Broadview Institute and the Keller Graduate School of Management are located in Edina.\n\nPlaces of worship[]\n\nEconomy[]\n\nEdina is home to the headquarters of salon chains Regis Corporation (owner of Regis Salons, Supercuts, TGF Haircutters, and Great Clips),[12][13] and of Dairy Queen and Orange Julius.[14][15]\n\nShopping[]\n\nEdina has numerous retail shopping centers, including Southdale Center.[16][17] Other shopping centers include Yorktown, Centennial Lakes Plaza, and the Galleria which has a collection of unique local shops, favorite specialty stores and distinct dining wrapped within a sophisticated, relaxed atmosphere. The city shares another thriving commercial area at West 50th Street and France Avenue South with Minneapolis, known as \"50th & France\".\n\nEdina has only municipal liquor stores; no other liquor stores are allowed. Edina maintains three liquor stores, which are located at 50th & France, Southdale (York Ave.), and Vernon & Interlachen Blvd.\n\nHotels[]\n\nThere are two hotels in Edina: the Residence Inn by Marriott which is adjacent to Edinborough Park, and the Westin Edina Galleria Hotel & Residences[18] at 69th Street and York Avenue. A 7-story Aloft hotel is to be built by Starwood Hotels and Resorts, near Highway 100 and 77th Street, by the year 2018.[19] The lack of hotels in Edina dates back to the early 1930s when Edina was still officially a \"dry\" city. There are several hotels in a region several blocks north of I-494; this area was once part of Edina. After successful petitioning, the area was annexed to Bloomington, which allowed alcohol sales at the time.\n\nLargest employers[]\n\nAccording to the city's 2009 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report,[20] the largest employers in the city are:\n\n# Employer # of Employees 1 Jerry's Foods 4,500 2 Fairview Southdale Hospital 2,500 3 Macy's 1,200 4 Edina Public Schools 1,172 5 Nash Finch 350 6 Dairy Queen 300 7 City of Edina 262 8 J. C. Penney 250 9 Edina Realty 210 10 ConAgra Foods 196\n\nRecreation[]\n\nParks[]\n\nEdina's parkland and open space totals more than 1,550 acres (6.3 km²). The Edina Park and Recreation Department oversees 44 parks, which include amenities such as baseball, football and soccer fields; softball diamonds; basketball and tennis courts; outdoor skating rinks; playground equipment for young children; and picnic shelters. The Department also maintains eight miles (13 km) of scenic pathways for bicycling, walking, jogging, cross-country skiing and snowshoeing.\n\nEdina Parks Alden Park Fred Richards Golf Course Rosland Park Arden Park Garden Park Sherwood Park Arneson Acres Park Garden Park Addition St. John's Park Birchcrest Park Heights Park Strachauer Park Braemar Baseball Park (Courtney Fields) Highlands Park T.
