        "text": "From coaching the U.S. Davis Cup team to speaking out as a mental health advocate, Mardy Fish has been able to do all that and improve his golf swing since retiring from tennis in 2015. The former world No. 7 will get to show off the latter in a big way this week when he makes his PGA debut at the 3M Open in Minneapolis, becoming the first tennis player to participate in a pro golf event.\n\nâNo oneâs ever played an ATP and PGA Tour event before,â said the Minnesota native. âItâs special that itâs here as well; I was born just down the road. This is certainly a special trip.â\n\nFish has indeed been among the best celebrity golfers, winning the 2020 American Century Championships in Lake Tahoe along with a pair of Diamond Resorts Invitational titles in 2016 and 2018.\n\nFollowing a sixth-place finish in Lake Tahoe last week, the 2004 Olympic silver medalist announced his forthcoming debut on Twitter and has already earned a ringing endorsement from golf legend Jack Nicklaus.\n\nâWe played nine holes and he drove the ball on every single hole in the middle of the fairway, further than I have seen anybody hit it who is not a professional,â Nicklaus told Steve Flink in 2018, calling Fish âthe best non-professional golfer I have ever seen play.â\n\nâI said, âMardy, what are you doing? You have got a talent and you are young enough to take advantage of it. You need to go play golf.ââ\n\nFish has also remained a big part of the tennis world, working with rising American talent and imparting wisdom from his own career and mental health struggles in a Netflix documentary entitled âUntold: Breaking Point,â released last summer.\n\nâMental health doesnât care what your name is or what you do for a living,â Fish told me before the 2021 US Open. âEveryone is in their own bubble with stresses, pressures, and expectations on themselvesâno matter what job title they have. Mine just happened to involve playing in front of a lot of people, but my issues would be no different from any other personâs.â"
