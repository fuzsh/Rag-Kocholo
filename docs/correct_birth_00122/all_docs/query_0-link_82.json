I am incredibly jealous.\n\nA Country Star In The Stands\n\nI am not a sports person but I will do my best to break it all down! Dierks Bentley was in Minnesota taking in the SDP Invitational, which is an elite hockey tournament in the midwest.\n\nThis time around, it was in Eden Prairie, Minnesota. The tournament kicked off on Thursday, April 11th and went through the following Sunday.\n\nDierks, Is That You?\n\nThe organizer of the popular social media account 'YouthHockeyHub' shared a photo of Dierks in the stands, rocking a flannel and cap. He is seen intensely gazing out onto the ice and taking in the game.\n\nRELATED: The 20 Best Dierks Bentley Songs\n\nHow fun! The guy next to him doesn't seem to know he is sitting next to a country star or maybe he does and is playing it cool. I definitely would not be. Ha!\n\nWhy Was He At A Hockey Tournament?\n\nDierks is very vocal about his love of hockey. He often posts videos from games he goes to and also shares snippets of he and his family playing hockey!
