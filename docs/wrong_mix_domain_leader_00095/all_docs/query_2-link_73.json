Cardiorespiratory measurements provide robust objective data, to correlate with each of the different clinical phenotypes. It has important implications for the management and treatment of this syndrome. The aim of this study was to correlate the genotype with the quantitative cardiorespiratory data obtained by neurophysiological measurement combined with a clinical severity score. This international multicenter study was conducted in four European countries from 1999 to 2012. The study cohort consisted of a group of 132 well-defined RTT females aged between 2 and 43 years with extended clinical, molecular, and neurophysiological assessments. Diagnosis of RTT was based on the consensus criteria for RTT and molecular confirmation. Genotype-phenotype analyses of clinical features and cardiorespiratory data were performed after grouping mutations by the same type and localization or having the same putative biological effect on the MeCP2 protein, and subsequently on eight single recurrent mutations. A less severe phenotype was seen in females with CTS, p.R133C, and p.R294X mutations. Autonomic disturbances were present in all females, and not restricted to nor influenced by one specific group or any single recurrent mutation. The objective information from non-invasive neurophysiological evaluation of the disturbed central autonomic control is of great importance in helping to organize the lifelong care for females with RTT. Further research is needed to provide insights into the pathogenesis of autonomic dysfunction, and to develop evidence-based management in RTT. Â© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The Pediatric Heart Network (PHN), with 15 years of experience in multicenter clinical research, has tackled numerous challenges when conducting multicenter studies. Recent findings This review describes the challenges encountered and the strategies employed to conduct high-quality, collaborative research in pediatric cardiovascular disease. Summary Sharing lessons learned from the PHN can provide guidance to investigators interested in conducting pediatric multicenter studies.

In a multicenter, randomized, controlled, longitudinal study, 374 clinically stable schizophrenia patients were interviewed at entry with standardized assessment instruments and followed for 12-26 months. In the multivariate analysis, male sex, married marital status, urban abode, and more frequent relapse over the study period were independently associated with paranoid schizophrenia. The socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of Chinese patients with the paranoid subtype of schizophrenia are different from those of their Caucasian counterparts who are more likely to be women and have a better outcome.

Transfusion practices differ among hospitals and it is unknown which transfusion practices improve survival. This report describes the experience of the PRospective Observational Multicenter Major Trauma Transfusion (PROMMTT) Study Data Coordination Center in designing and coordinating a study to examine transfusion practices at ten Level 1 trauma centers in the U.S. Methods PROMMTT was a multisite prospective observational study of severely injured transfused trauma patients. The clinical sites collected real-time information on the timing and amounts of blood product infusions as well as colloids and crystalloids, vital signs, initial diagnostic and clinical laboratory tests, life saving interventions and other clinical care data. Results Between July 2009 and October 2010, PROMMTT screened 12,561 trauma admissions and enrolled 1,245 patients who received one or more blood transfusions within 6 hours of ED admission. A total of 297 massive transfusions were observed over the course of the study at a combined rate of 5.0 massive transfusion patients/week. Conclusion PROMMTT is the first multisite study to collect real-time prospective data on trauma patients requiring transfusion. Support from the Department of Defense and collaborative expertise from the ten participating centers helped to demonstrate the feasibility of prospective trauma transfusion studies. The observational data collected from this study will be an invaluable resource for research in trauma surgery and it will guide the design and conduct of future randomized trials.

These results were evaluated by key trial constituencies. Issues reported by principal investigators fell into two categories: acceptance by key regulators and the scientific community, and usability for researchers and clinicians. Issues reported by the coordinating center, participating sites, and study subjects were those faced when integrating new technologies into existing clinical trial systems. We then defined elements of a PROMIS Tool Kit required for integrating PROMIS into a multi-center clinical trial environment. The requirements identified in this study serve as a framework for future investigators in the design, development, implementation, and operation of PROMIS Tool Kit technologies.\n\nImpact of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Management Information System (PROMIS) upon the Design and Operation of Multi-center Clinical Trials: a Qualitative Research Study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDiener, Lawrence W.; Nahm, Meredith; Weinfurt, Kevin P.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nNew technologies may be required to integrate the National Institutes of Healthâs Patient Reported Outcome Management Information System (PROMIS) into multi-center clinical trials.

For a one-way design, Tukey et al. (1985, Biometrics 41, 295-301) suggested assessing trend by examining the slopes of regression lines under arithmetic, ordinal, and arithmetic-logarithmic dose scalings. They reported the smallest p-value for the three significance tests on the three slopes for safety assessments. Capizzi et al. (1992, Biometrical Journal 34, 275-289) suggested an adjusted trend test, which adjusts the p-value using a trivariate t-distribution, the joint distribution of the three slope estimators. In this paper, we propose an adjusted regression trend test suitable for two-way designs, particularly for multicenter clinical trials. In a step-down fashion, the proposed trend test can be applied to a multicenter clinical trial to compare each dose with the control. This sequential procedure is a closed testing procedure for a trend alternative. Therefore, it adjusts p-values and maintains experimentwise error rate. Simulation results show that the step-down trend test is overall more powerful than a step-down least significant difference test.\n\nPractical considerations for estimating clinical trial accrual periods: application to a multi-center effectiveness study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCarter, Rickey E; Sonne, Susan C; Brady, Kathleen T\n\n2005-01-01\n\nBackground Adequate participant recruitment is vital to the conduct of a clinical trial. Projected recruitment rates are often over-estimated, and the time to recruit the target population (accrual period) is often under-estimated. Methods This report illustrates three approaches to estimating the accrual period and applies the methods to a multi-center, randomized, placebo controlled trial undergoing development. Results Incorporating known sources of accrual variation can yield a more justified estimate of the accrual period. Simulation studies can be incorporated into a clinical trial's planning phase to provide estimates for key accrual summaries including the mean and standard deviation of the accrual period. Conclusion The accrual period of a clinical trial should be carefully considered, and the allocation of sufficient time for participant recruitment is a fundamental aspect of planning a clinical trial.

Furthermore, DLB is often misdiagnosed as Alzheimer's disease. These data motivate harmonized multicenter longitudinal cohort studies to improve clinical management and therapy monitoring. The Italian DLB study group of the Italian Neurological Society for dementia (SINdem) developed and emailed a semi-structured questionnaire to 572 national dementia centers (from primary to tertiary) to prepare an Italian large longitudinal cohort. The questionnaire surveyed: (1) prevalence and incidence of DLB; (2) clinical assessment; (3) relevance and availability of diagnostic tools; (4) pharmacological management of cognitive, motor, and behavioural disturbances; (5) causes of hospitalization, with specific focus on delirium and its treatment. Overall, 135 centers (23.6Â %) contributed to the survey. Overall, 5624 patients with DLB are currently followed by the 135 centers in a year (2042 of them are new patients). The percentage of DLB patients was lower (27Â Â±Â 8Â %) than that of Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia (56Â Â±Â 27Â %) patients. The majority of the centers (91Â %) considered the clinical and neuropsychological assessments as the most relevant procedure for a DLB diagnosis. Nonetheless, most of the centers has availability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; 95Â %), electroencephalography (EEG; 93Â %), and FP-CIT single photon emission-computerized tomography (SPECT; 75Â %) scan for clinical applications. It will be, therefore, possible to recruit a large harmonized Italian cohort of DLB patients for future cross-sectional and longitudinal multicenter studies.\n\nOrganizational structure and communication strategies of the bypass angioplasty revascularization investigation: a multicenter clinical trial.\n\nPubMed\n\nNaydeck, B L; Sutton-Tyrrell, K; Burek, K; Sopko, G S\n\n1996-06-01\n\nEfficient communication is a challenge for the many operating components of a multicenter randomized clinical trial. Traditional management theory states that communications generally flow along a path established by a hierarchical organizational structure. A multicenter clinical trial does not fit traditional organizational models well and requires modification of traditional communication techniques. While the scientific community typically views a clinical trial as one large and cohesive enterprise, at each site the trial may actually be conducted as a small project related to the medical specialty of the investigator. Therefore overall trial management must be accomplished through collaboration rather than through direct management. In the Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation (BARI), the BARI clinical coordinating center has designed and utilized several mechanisms that facilitate effective communication and administrative control of a multicenter clinical trial. These mechanisms provide a framework of communication techniques that accommodate the specific needs of a complex organization.\n\nA Multi-center Milestone Study of Clinical Vertebral CT Segmentation\n\nPubMed Central\n\nYao, Jianhua; Burns, Joseph E.; Forsberg, Daniel; Seitel, Alexander; Rasoulian, Abtin; Abolmaesumi, Purang; Hammernik, Kerstin; Urschler, Martin; Ibragimov, Bulat; Korez, Robert; Vrtovec, TomaÅ¾; Castro-Mateos, Isaac; Pozo, Jose M.; Frangi, Alejandro F.; Summers, Ronald M.; Li, Shuo\n\n2017-01-01\n\nA multiple center milestone study of clinical vertebra segmentation is presented in this paper. Vertebra segmentation is a fundamental step for spinal image analysis and intervention. The first half of the study was conducted in the spine segmentation challenge in 2014 International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) Workshop on Computational Spine Imaging (CSI 2014). The objective was to evaluate the performance of several state-of-the-art vertebra segmentation algorithms on computed tomography (CT) scans using ten training and five testing dataset, all healthy cases; the second half of the study was conducted after the challenge, where additional 5 abnormal cases are used for testing to evaluate the performance under abnormal cases. Dice coefficients and absolute surface distances were used as evaluation metrics. Segmentation of each vertebra as a single geometric unit, as well as separate segmentation of vertebra substructures, was evaluated. Five teams participated in the comparative study. The top performers in the study achieved Dice coefficient of 0.93 in the upper thoracic, 0.95 in the lower thoracic and 0.96 in the lumbar spine for healthy cases, and 0.88 in the upper thoracic, 0.89 in the lower thoracic and 0.92 in the lumbar spine for osteoporotic and fractured cases. The strengths and weaknesses of each method as well as future suggestion for improvement are discussed. This is the first multi-center comparative study for vertebra segmentation methods, which will provide an up-to-date performance milestone for the fast growing spinal image analysis and intervention.

The authors describe the development of a research database incorporating the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society standardized terminology for critical care EEG monitoring. The database includes flexible report generation tools that allow for daily clinical use. Key clinical and research variables were incorporated into a Microsoft Access database. To assess its utility for multicenter research data collection, the authors performed a 21-center feasibility study in which each center entered data from 12 consecutive intensive care unit monitoring patients. To assess its utility as a clinical report generating tool, three large volume centers used it to generate daily clinical critical care EEG reports. A total of 280 subjects were enrolled in the multicenter feasibility study. The duration of recording (median, 25.5 hours) varied significantly between the centers. The incidence of seizure (17.6%), periodic/rhythmic discharges (35.7%), and interictal epileptiform discharges (11.8%) was similar to previous studies. The database was used as a clinical reporting tool by 3 centers that entered a total of 3,144 unique patients covering 6,665 recording days. The Critical Care EEG Monitoring Research Consortium database has been successfully developed and implemented with a dual role as a collaborative research platform and a clinical reporting tool. It is now available for public download to be used as a clinical data repository and report generating tool.\n\nNon-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT): Europe's first multicenter post-market clinical follow-up study validating the quality in clinical routine.\n\nPubMed\n\nFlÃ¶ck, Anne; Tu, Ngoc-Chi; RÃ¼land, Anna; Holzgreve, Wolfgang; Gembruch, Ulrich; Geipel, Annegret\n\n2017-11-01\n\nNon-invasive prenatal tests (NIPT) for the determination of fetal aneuploidies from maternal blood are firmly established in clinical routine. For the first time, the accuracy of an NIPT for the determination of trisomies 21, 18 and 13 in singleton pregnancies was assessed by means of a prospective German-wide multicenter post-market clinical follow-up study, to reliably evaluate the quality in clinical routine. The study covered the indications for testing, the test results, the rate of invasive diagnostics and the pregnancy outcome. 2232 cases were tested for trisomy 21. Of these, 1946 cases were additionally examined for trisomy 18 and 13. Sensitivity and specificity for trisomy 21 (43/43) and for trisomy 13 (2/2) were 100%, for trisomy 18 the sensitivity was 80% (4/5) with a specificity of 99.8%. Three false-positive results for trisomy 18 were observed (FPR 0.15%). The no-call rate was 0.5%. In this subgroup, 27.3% (3/11) aneuploidies were diagnosed. The rate of invasive procedures was 2.6%. NIPT provides a very high quality for the fetal trisomies 21, 13 and 18 in clinical routine. The results support the recommendation that NIPT should be offered after genetic counseling and only in conjunction with a qualified ultrasound examination.\n\nDermatology Medical Education: A Multicenter Survey Study of the Undergraduate Perspective of the Dermatology Clinical Clerkship.\n\nPubMed\n\nDavari, Parastoo; Millsop, Jillian W; Johnson, Mary Ann N; Takahashi, Stefani R; Peng, David H; Badger, Joanna; Bahr, Brooks A; Shinkai, Kanade; Li, Chin-Shang; Fazel, Nasim\n\n2017-12-15\n\nLimited data are available regarding the undergraduate dermatology clinical clerkship curriculum in the United States. Our primaryaim is to assess medical students' perspectives of the dermatology clinical clerkship. A multicenter survey study was conducted, which included four California dermatology academic programs. A 17-item questionnaire was designed to investigate medical student perception with regard tothe overall educational value of the various teaching aspects of the dermatology clinical clerkship. A total of 152 medical student surveys were completed. Over half of the medical students felt proficient in diagnosing the most commondermatologic conditions. Eighty-seven percent of medical students were very satisfied with the dermatology clerkship. Ninety-one percent of students felt the length of the clerkship was appropriate. The vast majority of medical students reported a high level of proficiency in the treatment and diagnosis of common skin disorders. In contrast, our findings suggest that medical students may not begaining sufficient hands-on experience in conducting certain dermatologic procedures following the dermatology clerkship. Overall, medical studentperception of the dermatology clinical clerkship was mostly positive.\n\nInfant lung function tests as endpoints in the ISIS multicenter clinical trial in cystic fibrosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nDavis, Stephanie D; Ratjen, Felix; Brumback, Lyndia C; Johnson, Robin C; Filbrun, Amy G; Kerby, Gwendolyn S; Panitch, Howard B; Donaldson, Scott H; Rosenfeld, Margaret\n\n2016-05-01\n\nThe Infant Study of Inhaled Saline (ISIS) in CF was the first multicenter clinical trial to utilize infant pulmonary function tests (iPFTs) as an endpoint. Secondary analysis of ISIS data was conducted in order to assess feasibility of iPFT measures and their associations with respiratory symptoms. Standard deviations were calculated to aid in power calculations for future clinical trials. Seventy-three participants enrolled, 70 returned for the final visit; 62 (89%) and 45 (64%) had acceptable paired functional residual capacity (FRC) and raised volume measurements, respectively. Mean baseline FEV0.5, FEF75 and FRC z-scores were 0.3 (SD: 1.2), -0.2 (SD: 2.0), and 1.8 (SD: 2.0). iPFTs are not appropriate primary endpoints for multicenter clinical trials due to challenges of obtaining acceptable data and near-normal average raised volume measurements. Raised volume measures have potential to serve as secondary endpoints in future clinical CF trials. Copyright Â© 2015 European Cystic Fibrosis Society. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The Clinical Trials in Organ Transplantation (CTOT)-05 protocol was an observational, multicenter, cohort study of 200 heart transplant recipients followed for the first posttransplant year. The primary endpoint was a composite of death, graft loss/retransplantation, biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR), and cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) as defined by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). We serially measured anti-HLA- and auto-antibodies, angiogenic proteins, peripheral blood allo-reactivity, and peripheral blood gene expression patterns. We correlated assay results and clinical characteristics with the composite endpoint and its components. The composite endpoint was associated with older donor allografts (pâ<â0.03) and with recipient anti-HLA antibody (pâ<â0.04). Recipient CMV-negativity (regardless of donor status) was associated with BPAR (pâ<â0.001), and increases in plasma vascular endothelial growth factor-C (OR 20; 95%CI:1.9-218) combined with decreases in endothelin-1 (OR 0.14; 95%CI:0.02-0.97) associated with CAV. The remaining biomarkers showed no relationships with the study endpoints. While suboptimal endpoint definitions and lower than anticipated event rates were identified as potential study limitations, the results of this multicenter study do not yet support routine use of the selected assays as noninvasive approaches to detect BPAR and/or CAV following heart transplantation.

In clinical trials, the processes leading to publication can be complex from choice and prioritization of analytic topics through to journal submission and revisions. As little literature exists on the publication process for multicenter trials, we describe the development, implementation, and effectiveness of such a process in a multicenter trial. Methods The Hepatitis C Antiviral Long-Term Treatment against Cirrhosis (HALT-C) trial included a data coordinating center (DCC) and clinical centers that recruited and followed more than 1,000 patients. Publication guidelines were approved by the steering committee, and the publications committee monitored the publication process from selection of topics to publication. Results A total of 73 manuscripts were published in 23 peer-reviewed journals. When manuscripts were closely tracked, the median time for analyses and drafting of manuscripts was 8Â months. The median time for data analyses was 5Â months and the median time for manuscript drafting was 3Â months. The median time for publications committee review, submission, and journal acceptance was 7Â months, and the median time from analytic start to journal acceptance was 18Â months. Conclusions Effective publication guidelines must be comprehensive, implemented early in a trial, and require active management by study investigators. Successful collaboration, such as in the HALT-C trial, can serve as a model for others involved in multidisciplinary and multicenter research programs.

In a prospective study at three Northern European sites physical activity and clinical disease characteristics were measured in 134 COPD patients (GOLD-stage II-IV; BODE index 0-9) and 46 controls. Wearing time, steps per day, and the physical activity level (PAL) were measured by a multisensory armband over a period of 6 consecutive days (in total, 144 h). A valid measurement period was defined as â¥22 h wearing time a day on at least 5 days. The median wearing time was 142 h:17 min (99%), 141 h:1 min (98%), and 142 h:24 min (99%), respectively in the three centres. A valid measurement period was reached in 94%, 97%, and 94% of the patients and did not differ across sites (P = 0.53). The amount of physical activity did not differ across sites (mean steps per day, 4725 Â± 3212, P = 0.58; mean PAL, 1.45 Â± 0.20, P = 0.48). Multivariate linear regression analyses revealed significant associations of FEV1, 6-min walk distance, quadriceps strength, fibrinogen, health status, and dyspnoea with both steps per day and PAL. Previously unrecognized correlates of activity were grade of fatigue, degree of emphysema, and exacerbation rate. The excellent compliance with wearing a physical activity monitor irrespective of study site and consistent associations with relevant disease characteristics support the use of activity monitoring as a valid outcome in multi-center studies.

One hundred and fourty-three patients with pelvic anaerobic bacteria infection were classified into 70 cases treated by levornidazole in study group and 73 cases treated by Ornidazole in control group. Those patients in two groups were both administered at a dose of 0.5 g twice daily for 5 - 7 days. The rate of clinical efficacy, bacteria clearance and adverse effect were recorded and compared between two groups. at the endpoint, the rate of clinical efficacy were 80% (56/70) in study group and 81% (59/73) in control group, which did not reach significant difference (P > 0.05). The rate of bacteria clearance were 97% (36/37) in study group and 92% (22/24) in control group, which also did not reach significant difference (P > 0.05). The rate of adverse reaction of 3% (20/70) in study group was significantly lower than 22% (16/73) in control group (P < 0.05). it is effective and safe to treat pelvic anaerobic infections with levornidazole and sodium chloride injection.\n\nFactors predicting survival in ALS: a multicenter Italian study.\n\nPubMed\n\nCalvo, Andrea; Moglia, Cristina; Lunetta, Christian; Marinou, Kalliopi; Ticozzi, Nicola; Ferrante, Gianluca Drago; Scialo, Carlo; SorarÃ¹, Gianni; Trojsi, Francesca; Conte, Amelia; Falzone, Yuri M; Tortelli, Rosanna; Russo, Massimo; ChiÃ², Adriano; Sansone, Valeria Ada; Mora, Gabriele; Silani, Vincenzo; Volanti, Paolo; Caponnetto, Claudia; Querin, Giorgia; MonsurrÃ², Maria Rosaria; Sabatelli, Mario; Riva, Nilo; Logroscino, Giancarlo; Messina, Sonia; Fini, Nicola; Mandrioli, Jessica\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe aim of this multicenter, retrospective study is to investigate the role of clinical characteristics and therapeutic intervention on ALS prognosis. The study included patients diagnosed from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2013 in 13 Italian referral centers for ALS located in 10 Italian regions. Caring neurologists collected a detailed phenotypic profile and follow-up data until death into an electronic database. One center collected also data from a population-based registry for ALS. 2648 incident cases were collected. The median survival time from onset to death/tracheostomy was 44Â months (SE 1.18, CI 42-46). According to univariate analysis, factors related to survival from onset to death/tracheostomy were: age at onset, diagnostic delay, site of onset, phenotype, degree of certainty at diagnosis according to revised El Escorial criteria (R-EEC), presence/absence of dementia, BMI at diagnosis, patients' provenance. In the multivariate analysis, age at onset, diagnostic delay, phenotypes but not site of onset, presence/absence of dementia, BMI, riluzole use, R-EEC criteria were independent prognostic factors of survival in ALS. We compared patients from an ALS Registry with patients from tertiary centers; the latter ones were younger, less frequently bulbar, but more frequently familial and definite at diagnosis. Our large, multicenter study demonstrated the role of some clinical and demographic factors on ALS survival, and showed some interesting differences between referral centers' patients and the general ALS population. These results can be helpful for clinical practice, in clinical trial design and to validate new tools to predict disease progression.\n\nA Multicenter Study of Volumetric Computed Tomography for Staging Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRusch, Valerie W.; Gill, Ritu; Mitchell, Alan; Naidich, David; Rice, David C.; Pass, Harvey I.; Kindler, Hedy; De Perrot, Marc; Friedberg, Joseph\n\n2016-01-01\n\nBackground Standard imaging modalities are inaccurate in staging malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). Single institution studies suggest that volumetric computed tomography (VolCT) is more accurate but labor intensive. We established a multicenter network to test interobserver variability, accuracy (relative to pathologic stage) and prognostic significance of semi-automated VolCT. Methods Six institutions electronically submitted clinical and pathologic data to an established multicenter database on patients with MPM who had surgery. Institutional radiologists reviewed preoperative CT scans for quality then submitted via electronic network (AG mednet) to biostatistical center (BC). Two reference radiologists, blinded to clinical data, performed semi-automated tumor volume calculations using commercially available software (Vitrea Enterprise 6.0), then submitted readings to BC. Study endpoints included: feasibility of network; interobserver variability for VolCT; correlation of tumor volume to pTN stages, and overall survival (OS). Results Of 164 cases, 129 were analyzable and read by reference radiologists. Most tumors were <500cm3. A small bias was observed between readers, as one provided consistently larger measurements than the other (mean difference=47.9, p=.0027), but for 80% of cases, the absolute difference was â¤ 200cm3. Spearman correlation between readers was 0.822. Volume correlated with pTN stages and OS, best defined by 3 groups with average volumes of: 91.2, 245.3, 511.3cm3, associated with median OS of 37, 18, 8 months respectively. Conclusions For the first time, a multicenter network was established and initial correlations of tumor volume to pTN stages and OS shown. A larger multicenter international study is planned to confirm results and refine correlations.

An electronic survey was distributed to the members of the American Glaucoma Society (AGS). Each participant was asked 2 study-specific questions and 1 standard question common to all 8 RCTs assessing the study's impact on clinical practice. RCTs included in the survey were the Advanced Glaucoma Intervention Study (AGIS), Collaborative Initial Glaucoma Treatment Study (CIGTS), Collaborative Normal Tension Glaucoma (CNTG) Study, European Glaucoma Prevention Study (EGPS), Early Manifest Glaucoma Trial (EMGT), Glaucoma Laser Trial (GLT), Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study (OHTS), and Tube Versus Trabeculectomy (TVT) Study. A 5-point Likert scale was used for rating all responses. The practice setting and duration of glaucoma practice was determined for all AGS members who responded. A total of 206 (23.0%) of 894 AGS members participated in the survey. Among those who responded, 46.4% were self classified as academic practitioners and 53.6% worked in a private practice setting. Mean Likert scores for the standard question evaluating the overall impact of the RCT were OHTS 4.47, CNTG Study 4.13, AGIS 3.78, TVT Study 3.53, EMGT 3.48, CIGTS 3.44, GLT 3.39, and 2.69 EGPS. Substantial differences were observed in the clinical impact of several RCTs in glaucoma. The reported impact of each study likely reflects several factors including study timing, design, conduct, and interpretation of results.\n\nWeb-based documentation system with exchange of DICOM RT for multicenter clinical studies in particle therapy\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKessel, Kerstin A.; Bougatf, Nina; Bohn, Christian; Engelmann, Uwe; Oetzel, Dieter; Bendl, Rolf; Debus, JÃ¼rgen; Combs, Stephanie E.\n\n2012-02-01\n\nConducting clinical studies is rather difficult because of the large variety of voluminous datasets, different documentation styles, and various information systems, especially in radiation oncology. In this paper, we describe our development of a web-based documentation system with first approaches of automatic statistical analyses for transnational and multicenter clinical studies in particle therapy. It is possible to have immediate access to all patient information and exchange, store, process, and visualize text data, all types of DICOM images, especially DICOM RT, and any other multimedia data. Accessing the documentation system and submitting clinical data is possible for internal and external users (e.g. referring physicians from abroad, who are seeking the new technique of particle therapy for their patients). Thereby, security and privacy protection is ensured with the encrypted https protocol, client certificates, and an application gateway. Furthermore, all data can be pseudonymized. Integrated into the existing hospital environment, patient data is imported via various interfaces over HL7-messages and DICOM. Several further features replace manual input wherever possible and ensure data quality and entirety. With a form generator, studies can be individually designed to fit specific needs. By including all treated patients (also non-study patients), we gain the possibility for overall large-scale, retrospective analyses. Having recently begun documentation of our first six clinical studies, it has become apparent that the benefits lie in the simplification of research work, better study analyses quality and ultimately, the improvement of treatment concepts by evaluating the effectiveness of particle therapy.\n\nA cooperative network of trained sites for the conduct of a complex clinical trial: a new concept in multicenter clinical research.\n\nPubMed\n\nDavidson, Robert M; McNeer, J Frederick; Logan, Leanne; Higginbotham, Michael B; Anderson, Jerome; Blackshear, Joseph; Chu, Alan; Hettleman, Bruce; McGrew, Frank; Meesse, Roderick; O'Connor, Christopher; Schneider, Ricky; Wagner, Galen S\n\n2006-02-01\n\nThe purpose of this report is to present a model of physicians in full-time clinical practice participating as investigators in multicenter clinical trials, sponsored by a pharmaceutical or medical device company. This gas-exchange substudy was conducted as a pilot study to establish the feasibility of the 10-member EXERcise testing group of the Duke University Cooperative Cardiovascular Society (EXERDUCCS) consortium to perform a complex multicenter trial using cardiopulmonary exercise testing. An active interchange of information was established involving the principal investigator for the substudy, a dedicated full-time project coordinator, a medical director of the overall EXERDUCCS network site, the project coordinator for the sponsor, and all the participating EXERDUCCS investigators and coordinators. The sponsor set as a goal of enrollment of 6 subjects per site, and 8 of the 10 sites met this goal. As a result of the successful enrollment and completion of the study and substudy by the EXERDUCCS sites, the sponsor subsequently increased the payment stipends to the sites to compensate for the extra work and expense incurred. This cooperative experience accomplished several goals: (1) it allowed a complex clinical trial to be successfully completed in a time frame which would not have been possible using only single unconnected sites; (2) it educated the physician-investigators (and their personnel) in exercise cardiopulmonary; and (3) it prepared the sites for future clinical trials involving this methodology.\n\nParticipation of a coordinating center pharmacy in a multicenter international study.\n\nPubMed\n\nJeon, Jihyun Esther; Mighty, Janet; Lane, Karen; McBee, Nichol; Majkowski, Ryan; Mayo, Steven; Hanley, Daniel\n\n2016-11-15\n\nThe activities of a coordinating center pharmacy (CCP) supporting a multicenter, international clinical trial are described. Serving in a research support role comparable to that of a commercial clinical trial supply company, a CCP within the Johns Hopkins Hospital Investigational Drug Service (JHH IDS) uses its management expertise and infrastructure to support multicenter trials, such as the recently completed Clot Lysis: Evaluating Accelerated Resolution of Intraventricular Hemorrhage, Phase III (CLEAR III) trial. The role of the CCP staff in supporting the CLEAR III trial was overall investigational product (IP) management through coordination of IP-related operations to ensure high-quality care for study participants at study sites in the United States and abroad. For the CLEAR III trial, the CCP coordinated IP supply activities; provided education to site pharmacists; developed study-specific documents, including pharmacy manuals; communicated with trial stakeholders, including third-party IP distributors; monitored treatment assignments; and performed quality assurance monitoring to ensure compliance with institutional, state, federal, and international regulations regarding IP procurement and storage. Acting as a CCP for a multicenter international study poses a number of operational challenges while providing opportunities for the CCP to contribute to research of global importance and enrich the skill sets of its personnel. The development and implementation of the CCP at JHH IDS for the CLEAR III trial included several responsibilities, such as IP supply management, communication, and database, regulatory, and finance management.

Specifically, multi-center projects can support large-scale prospective, longitudinal studies that investigate relatively uncommon outcomes, such as anterior cruciate ligament injury. This project was conceived to assess within- and between-center reliability of an affordable, clinical nomogram utilizing two-dimensional video methods to screen for risk of knee injury. The authors hypothesized that the two-dimensional screening methods would provide good-to-excellent reliability within and between institutions for assessment of frontal and sagittal plane biomechanics. Nineteen female, high school athletes participated. Two-dimensional video kinematics of the lower extremity during a drop vertical jump task were collected on all 19 study participants at each of the three facilities. Within-center and between-center reliability were assessed with intra- and inter-class correlation coefficients. Within-center reliability of the clinical nomogram variables was consistently excellent, but between-center reliability was fair-to-good. Within-center intra-class correlation coefficient for all nomogram variables combined was 0.98, while combined between-center inter-class correlation coefficient was 0.63. Injury risk screening protocols were reliable within and repeatable between centers. These results demonstrate the feasibility of multi-site biomechanical studies and establish a framework for further dissemination of injury risk screening algorithms. Specifically, multi-center studies may allow for further validation and optimization of two-dimensional video screening tools. 2b.\n\nA web-based clinical trial management system for a sham-controlled multicenter clinical trial in depression.\n\nPubMed\n\nDurkalski, Valerie; Wenle Zhao; Dillon, Catherine; Kim, Jaemyung\n\n2010-04-01\n\nClinical trial investigators and sponsors invest vast amounts of resources and energy into conducting trials and often face daily challenges with data management, project management, and data quality control. Rather than waiting months for study progress reports, investigators need the ability to use real-time data for the coordination and management of study activities across all study team members including site investigators, oversight committees, data and safety monitoring boards, and medical safety monitors. Web-based data management systems are beginning to meet this need but what distinguishes one system from the other are user needs/requirements and cost. To illustrate the development and implementation of a web-based data and project management system for a multicenter clinical trial designed to test the superiority of repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation versus sham for the treatment of patients with major depression. The authors discuss the reasons for not using a commercially available system for this study and describe the approach to developing their own web-based system for the OPT-TMS study. Timelines, effort, system architecture, and lessons learned are shared with the hope that this information will direct clinical trial researchers and software developers towards more efficient, user-friendly systems. The developers use a combination of generic and custom application code to allow for the flexibility to adapt the system to the needs of the study. Features of the system include: central participant registration and randomization; secure data entry at the site; participant progress/study calendar; safety data reporting; device accounting; monitor verification; and user-configurable generic reports and built-in customized reports. Hard coding was more time-efficient to address project-specific issues compared with the effort of creating a generic code application. As a consequence of this strategy, the required maintenance of the system is\n\nSingle-Incision Multiport/Single Port Laparoscopic Abdominal Surgery (SILAP): A Prospective Multicenter Observational Quality Study.\n\nPubMed\n\nMantke, Rene; Diener, Markus; Kropf, Siegfried; Otto, Ronny; Manger, Thomas; Vestweber, Boris; Mirow, Lutz; Winde, GÃ¼nther; Lippert, Hans\n\n2016-09-07\n\nIncreasing experience with minimally invasive surgery and the development of new instruments has resulted in a tendency toward reducing the number of abdominal skin incisions. Retrospective and randomized prospective studies could show the feasibility of single-incision surgery without any increased risk to the patient. However, large prospective multicenter observational datasets do not currently exist. This prospective multicenter observational quality study will provide a relevant dataset reflecting the feasibility and safety of single-incision surgery. This study focuses on external validity, clinical relevance, and the patients' perspective. Accordingly, the single-incision multiport/single port laparoscopic abdominal surgery (SILAP) study will supplement the existing evidence, which does not currently allow evidence-based surgical decision making. The SILAP study is an international prospective multicenter observational quality study. Mortality, morbidity, complications during surgery, complications postoperatively, patient characteristics, and technical aspects will be monitored. We expect more than 100 surgical centers to participate with 5000 patients with abdominal single-incision surgery during the study period. Funding was obtained in 2012. Enrollment began on January 01, 2013, and will be completed on December 31, 2018. As of January 2016, 2119 patients have been included, 106 German centers are registered, and 27 centers are very active (>5 patients per year). This prospective multicenter observational quality study will provide a relevant dataset reflecting the feasibility and safety of single-incision surgery. An international enlargement and recruitment of centers outside of Germany is meaningful.

Responsiveness focus on the non-medical aspects of health services delivery. This study was aimed to assess responsiveness level in public and private physiography clinics. In this multicenter cross sectional study, 403 patients refers to 16 public and 64 private physical therapy clinics were studied randomly in Ahvaz, Iran, from 2013 to 2014. Data were collected based on a valid health system responsiveness questionnaire that was developed by WHO. Health system responsiveness questionnaire for outpatients care includes seven components and 25 questions. Statistical relationship between responsiveness level of centers and patients characteristics was analyzed using Pearson coefficient, Independent t-test and one-way ANOVA. Out of 403 patients, 299 (74.19%) patients were women. The mean (Â±SD) age of the patients was 42(Â±14.18) years and 92.1% of patients were 65> years. Responsiveness status in private and public physiotherapy clinics was assessed excellent (26.93Â±5.2) and very well (21.08Â±5.8) respectively. In private clinics, the mean score of communication dimension (3.96Â±1) and autonomy dimension (3.95Â±0.9) was higher than other dimensions. In public clinics the mean score of dignity (3.30Â±0.8), autonomy (3.16Â±0.9), and prompt attention (3.12Â±1) was higher than other areas respectively. In public and private clinics, quality of basic amenities area had the lowest score. The results showed that the some patients and center characteristics such as gender and work shift were factors affecting assessment of responsiveness. Responsiveness level in private centers was better than publics.\n\nMulticenter AIDS Cohort Study Quantitative Coronary Plaque Progression Study: rationale and design.\n\nPubMed\n\nNakanishi, Rine; Post, Wendy S; Osawa, Kazuhiro; Jayawardena, Eranthi; Kim, Michael; Sheidaee, Nasim; Nezarat, Negin; Rahmani, Sina; Kim, Nicholas; Hathiramani, Nicolai; Susarla, Shriraj; Palella, Frank; Witt, Mallory; Blaha, Michael J; Brown, Todd T; Kingsley, Lawrence; Haberlen, Sabina A; Dailing, Christopher; Budoff, Matthew J\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe association of HIV with coronary atherosclerosis has been established; however, the progression of coronary atherosclerosis over time among participants with HIV is not well known. The Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study Quantitative Coronary Plaque Progression Study is a large prospective multicenter study quantifying progression of coronary plaque assessed by serial coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA). HIV-infected and uninfected men who were enrolled in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study Cardiovascular Substudy were eligible to complete a follow-up contrast coronary CTA 3-6 years after baseline. We measured coronary plaque volume and characteristics (calcified and noncalcified plaque including fibrous, fibrous-fatty, and low attenuation) and vulnerable plaque among HIV-infected and uninfected men using semiautomated plaque software to investigate the progression of coronary atherosclerosis over time. We describe a novel, large prospective multicenter study investigating incidence, transition of characteristics, and progression in coronary atherosclerosis quantitatively assessed by serial coronary CTAs among HIV-infected and uninfected men.\n\nA Multicenter Study of the Presentation, Treatment, and Outcomes of Cervical Dural Tears.\n\nPubMed\n\nO'Neill, Kevin R; Fehlings, Michael G; Mroz, Thomas E; Smith, Zachary A; Hsu, Wellington K; Kanter, Adam S; Steinmetz, Michael P; Arnold, Paul M; Mummaneni, Praveen V; Chou, Dean; Nassr, Ahmad; Qureshi, Sheeraz A; Cho, Samuel K; Baird, Evan O; Smith, Justin S; Shaffrey, Christopher; Tannoury, Chadi A; Tannoury, Tony; Gokaslan, Ziya L; Gum, Jeffrey L; Hart, Robert A; Isaacs, Robert E; Sasso, Rick C; Bumpass, David B; Bydon, Mohamad; Corriveau, Mark; De Giacomo, Anthony F; Derakhshan, Adeeb; Jobse, Bruce C; Lubelski, Daniel; Lee, Sungho; Massicotte, Eric M; Pace, Jonathan R; Smith, Gabriel A; Than, Khoi D; Riew, K Daniel\n\n2017-04-01\n\nRetrospective multicenter case series study. Because cervical dural tears are rare, most surgeons have limited experience with this complication. A multicenter study was performed to better understand the presentation, treatment, and outcomes following cervical dural tears. Multiple surgeons from 23 institutions retrospectively identified 21 rare complications that occurred between 2005 and 2011, including unintentional cervical dural tears. Demographic data and surgical history were obtained. Clinical outcomes following surgery were assessed, and any reoperations were recorded. Neck Disability Index (NDI), modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association (mJOA), Nurick classification (NuC), and Short-Form 36 (SF36) scores were recorded at baseline and final follow-up at certain centers. All data were collected, collated, and analyzed by a private research organization. There were 109 cases of cervical dural tears among 18â463 surgeries performed. In 101 cases (93%) there was no clinical sequelae following successful dural tear repair. There were statistical improvements ( P < .05) in mJOA and NuC scores, but not NDI or SF36 scores. No specific baseline or operative factors were found to be associated with the occurrence of dural tears. In most cases, no further postoperative treatments of the dural tear were required, while there were 13 patients (12%) that required subsequent treatment of cerebrospinal fluid drainage. Analysis of those requiring further treatments did not identify an optimum treatment strategy for cervical dural tears. In this multicenter study, we report our findings on the largest reported series (n = 109) of cervical dural tears. In a vast majority of cases, no subsequent interventions were required and no clinical sequelae were observed.\n\nClinical Decision Support for a Multicenter Trial of Pediatric Head Trauma\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSwietlik, Marguerite; Deakyne, Sara; Hoffman, Jeffrey M.; Grundmeier, Robert W.; Paterno, Marilyn D.; Rocha, Beatriz H.; Schaeffer, Molly H; Pabbathi, Deepika; Alessandrini, Evaline; Ballard, Dustin; Goldberg, Howard S.; Kuppermann, Nathan; Dayan, Peter S.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nSummary Introduction For children who present to emergency departments (EDs) due to blunt head trauma, ED clinicians must decide who requires computed tomography (CT) scanning to evaluate for traumatic brain injury (TBI). The Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) derived and validated two age-based prediction rules to identify children at very low risk of clinically-important traumatic brain injuries (ciTBIs) who do not typically require CT scans. In this case report, we describe the strategy used to implement the PECARN TBI prediction rules via electronic health record (EHR) clinical decision support (CDS) as the intervention in a multicenter clinical trial. Methods Thirteen EDs participated in this trial. The 10 sites receiving the CDS intervention used the EpicÂ® EHR. All sites implementing EHR-based CDS built the rules by using the vendorâs CDS engine. Based on a sociotechnical analysis, we designed the CDS so that recommendations could be displayed immediately after any provider entered prediction rule data. One central site developed and tested the intervention package to be exported to other sites. The intervention package included a clinical trial alert, an electronic data collection form, the CDS rules and the format for recommendations. Results The original PECARN head trauma prediction rules were derived from physician documentation while this pragmatic trial led each site to customize their workflows and allow multiple different providers to complete the head trauma assessments. These differences in workflows led to varying completion rates across sites as well as differences in the types of providers completing the electronic data form. Site variation in internal change management processes made it challenging to maintain the same rigor across all sites. This led to downstream effects when data reports were developed.

Semistructured interviews with five US stakeholder groups. We completed 11 interviews, involving patients (nÂ =Â 15), researchers (nÂ =Â 10), Institutional Review Board and regulatory staff (nÂ =Â 3), multicenter research governance experts (nÂ =Â 2) and healthcare system leaders (nÂ =Â 4). Perceptions of the benefits and value of research were the strongest influences toward data sharing; cost and security risks were primary influences against sharing. Privacy-protecting methods that share summary-level data were acknowledged as being appealing, but there were concerns about increased cost and potential loss of research validity. Stakeholders were open to data sharing in multicenter studies that offer value and minimize security risks.\n\nNifedipine versus fenoterol in the management of preterm labor: a randomized, multicenter clinical study.\n\nPubMed\n\nValdÃ©s, E; Salinas, H; Toledo, V; Lattes, K; Cuellar, E; Perucca, E; Diaz, R; Montecinos, F; Reyes, A\n\n2012-01-01\n\nTo compare the efficacy of nifedipine and fenoterol in the management of threatened preterm labor (TPL). A randomized and multicenter study assessing the tocolytic effect of nifedipine versus fenoterol in patients admitted to the participating maternity units with a diagnosis of TPL and a cost-savings study for economic assessment. For a power of 80% and an Î± error equal to 0.05, 132 consecutive patients were recruited during the study period; 66 patients were assigned to each group. A Ï(2) analysis and a mean differences test were performed according to variable types and survival curves per intention-to-treat. Demographics were similar in both groups. The latency period was similar in both groups (26.7 vs. 25.6; p = 0.3). There were no differences in the results obtained. Nifedipine failed more frequently to obtain tocolysis when used as a first-line agent (80 vs. 90%, p = 0.0001). The group treated with fenoterol showed more drug adverse events (57.8 vs. 19.0%, p = 0.0001). The economic assessment did not evidence a significant difference in terms of cost savings between groups treated with either drug. The present study failed to demonstrate either clinical or economic superiority of any of the two drugs used in TPL management. The highest failure percentage of nifedipine when used as a first-line agent should encourage further research. Copyright Â© 2012 S.

We compared clinical characteristics of community-acquired (CA), hospital-acquired (HA), and healthcare-associated (HCA) BSI. We performed a prospective nationwide multicenter surveillance study from 9 university hospitals in Korea. Total 1,605 blood isolates were collected from 2006 to 2007, and 1,144 isolates were considered true pathogens. HA-BSI accounted for 48.8%, CA-BSI for 33.2%, and HCA-BSI for 18.0%. HA-BSI and HCA-BSI were more likely to have severe comorbidities. Escherichia coli was the most common isolate in CA-BSI (47.1%) and HCA-BSI (27.2%). In contrast, Staphylococcus aureus (15.2%), coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (15.1%) were the common isolates in HA-BSI. The rate of appropriate empiric antimicrobial therapy was the highest in CA-BSI (89.0%) followed by HCA-BSI (76.4%), and HA-BSI (75.0%). The 30-day mortality rate was the highest in HA-BSI (23.0%) followed by HCA-BSI (18.4%), and CA-BSI (10.2%). High Pitt score and inappropriate empirical antibiotic therapy were the independent risk factors for mortality by multivariate analysis. In conclusion, the present data suggest that clinical features, outcome, and microbiologic features of causative pathogens vary by origin of BSI. Especially, HCA-BSI shows unique clinical characteristics, which should be considered a distinct category for more appropriate antibiotic treatment.

As the accrual is closing to the target size, the coordinating data center needs to project the accrual closure date on the basis of the observed accrual pattern and notify the participating sites several weeks in advance. In the past, projections were simply based on some crude assessment, and conservative measures were incorporated in order to achieve the target accrual size. This approach often resulted in excessive accrual size and subsequently unnecessary financial burden on the study sponsors. Here we proposed a discrete-time Poisson process-based method to estimate the accrual rate at time of projection and subsequently the trial closure date. To ensure that target size would be reached with high confidence, we also proposed a conservative method for the closure date projection. The proposed method was illustrated through the analysis of the accrual data of the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project trial B-38. The results showed that application of the proposed method could help to save considerable amount of expenditure in patient management without compromising the accrual goal in multi-center clinical trials.

Much of the variability in reported standardized uptake value (SUV) data seen in the literature results from the variability in methodology applied among these studies, i.e., due to the use of different scanners, acquisition and reconstruction settings, region of interest strategies, SUV normalization, and/or corrections methods. To date, the variability in applied methodology prohibits a proper comparison and exchange of quantitative FDG PET data. Consequently, the promising role of quantitative PET has been demonstrated in several monocentric studies, but these published results cannot be used directly as a guideline for clinical (multicenter) trials performed elsewhere. In this chapter, the main causes affecting whole-body FDG PET quantification and strategies to minimize its inter-institute variability are addressed.\n\nBiomarker combinations for diagnosis and prognosis in multicenter studies: Principles and methods.\n\nPubMed\n\nMeisner, Allison; Parikh, Chirag R; Kerr, Kathleen F\n\n2017-01-01\n\nMany investigators are interested in combining biomarkers to predict a binary outcome or detect underlying disease. This endeavor is complicated by the fact that many biomarker studies involve data from multiple centers. Depending upon the relationship between center, the biomarkers, and the target of prediction, care must be taken when constructing and evaluating combinations of biomarkers. We introduce a taxonomy to describe the role of center and consider how a biomarker combination should be constructed and evaluated. We show that ignoring center, which is frequently done by clinical researchers, is often not appropriate. The limited statistical literature proposes using random intercept logistic regression models, an approach that we demonstrate is generally inadequate and may be misleading. We instead propose using fixed intercept logistic regression, which appropriately accounts for center without relying on untenable assumptions. After constructing the biomarker combination, we recommend using performance measures that account for the multicenter nature of the data, namely the center-adjusted area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. We apply these methods to data from a multicenter study of acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery. Appropriately accounting for center, both in construction and evaluation, may increase the likelihood of identifying clinically useful biomarker combinations.\n\nResults of a Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Masked, Placebo-Controlled Clinical Study of the Efficacy and Safety of Visomitin Eye Drops in Patients with Dry Eye Syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nBrzheskiy, Vladimir V; Efimova, Elena L; Vorontsova, Tatiana N; Alekseev, Vladimir N; Gusarevich, Olga G; Shaidurova, Ksenia N; Ryabtseva, Alla A; Andryukhina, Olga M; Kamenskikh, Tatiana G; Sumarokova, Elena S; Miljudin, Eugeny S; Egorov, Eugeny A; Lebedev, Oleg I; Surov, Alexander V; Korol, Andrii R; Nasinnyk, Illia O; Bezditko, Pavel A; Muzhychuk, Olena P; Vygodin, Vladimir A; Yani, Elena V; Savchenko, Alla Y; Karger, Elena M; Fedorkin, Oleg N; Mironov, Alexander N; Ostapenko, Victoria; Popeko, Natalia A; Skulachev, Vladimir P; Skulachev, Maxim V\n\n2015-12-01\n\nThis article presents the results of an international, multicenter, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled clinical study of Visomitin (Mitotech LLC, Moscow, Russian Federation) eye drops in patients with dry eye syndrome (DES). Visomitin is the first registered (in Russia) drug with a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant (SkQ1) as the active ingredient. In this multicenter (10 sites) study of 240 subjects with DES, study drug (Visomitin or placebo) was self-administered three times daily (TID) for 6Â weeks, followed by a 6-week follow-up period. Seven in-office study visits occurred every 2Â weeks during both the treatment and follow-up periods. Efficacy measures included Schirmer's test, tear break-up time, fluorescein staining, meniscus height, and visual acuity. Safety measures included adverse events, slit lamp biomicroscopy, tonometry, blood pressure, and heart rate. Tolerability was also evaluated. This clinical study showed the effectiveness of Visomitin eye drops in the treatment of signs and symptoms of DES compared with placebo. The study showed that a 6-week course of TID topical instillation of Visomitin significantly improved the functional state of the cornea; Visomitin increased tear film stability and reduced corneal damage. Significant reduction of dry eye symptoms (such as dryness, burning, grittiness, and blurred vision) was also observed. Based on the results of this study, Visomitin is effective and safe for use in eye patients with DES for protection from corneal damage.

We sought to report the prevalence and clinical profile of subtypes of delirium in a multicenter study. This is a point prevalence study nested in the \"Delirium Day 2015\", which included 108 acute and 12 rehabilitation wards in Italy. Delirium was detected using the 4-AT and motor subtypes were measured with the Delirium Motor Subtype Scale (DMSS). A multinomial logistic regression was used to determine the factors associated with delirium subtypes. Of 429 patients with delirium, the DMSS was completed in 275 (64%), classifying 21.5% of the patients with hyperactive delirium, 38.5% with hypoactive, 27.3% with mixed and 12.7% with the non-motor subtype. The 4-AT score was higher in the hyperactive subtype, similar in the hypoactive, mixed subtypes, while it was lowest in the non-motor subtype. Dementia was associated with all three delirium motor subtypes (hyperactive, OR 3.3, 95% CI: 1.2-8.7; hypoactive, OR 2.8, 95% CI: 1.2-6.5; mixed OR 2.6, 95% CI: 1.1-6.2). Atypical antipsychotics were associated with hypoactive delirium (OR 0.23, 95% CI: 0.1-0.7), while intravenous lines were associated with mixed delirium (OR 2.9, 95% CI: 1.2-6.9). The study shows that hypoactive delirium is the most common subtype among hospitalized older patients. Specific clinical features were associated with different delirium subtypes. The use of standardized instruments can help to characterize the phenomenology of different motor subtypes of delirium. Copyright Â© 2017 American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry.

Multicenter research confers many distinct advantages over single-center studies, including larger sample sizes for more generalizable findings, sharing resources amongst collaborative sites, and promoting networking. Well-executed multicenter studies are more likely to improve provider performance and/or have a positive impact on patient outcomes. In this manuscript, we offer a step-by-step guide to conducting multicenter, simulation-based research based upon our collective experience with the International Network for Simulation-based Pediatric Innovation, Research and Education (INSPIRE). Like multicenter clinical research, simulation-based multicenter research can be divided into four distinct phases. Each phase has specific differences when applied to simulation research: (1) Planning phase , to define the research question, systematically review the literature, identify outcome measures, and conduct pilot studies to ensure feasibility and estimate power; (2) Project Development phase , when the primary investigator identifies collaborators, develops the protocol and research operations manual, prepares grant applications, obtains ethical approval and executes subsite contracts, registers the study in a clinical trial registry, forms a manuscript oversight committee, and conducts feasibility testing and data validation at each site; (3) Study Execution phase , involving recruitment and enrollment of subjects, clear communication and decision-making, quality assurance measures and data abstraction, validation, and analysis; and (4) Dissemination phase , where the research team shares results via conference presentations, publications, traditional media, social media, and implements strategies for translating results to practice. With this manuscript, we provide a guide to conducting quantitative multicenter\n\nNext-generation sequencing diagnostics of bacteremia in sepsis (Next GeneSiS-Trial): Study protocol of a prospective, observational, noninterventional, multicenter, clinical trial.\n\nPubMed\n\nBrenner, Thorsten; Decker, Sebastian O; Grumaz, Silke; Stevens, Philip; Bruckner, Thomas; Schmoch, Thomas; Pletz, Mathias W; Bracht, Hendrik; Hofer, Stefan; Marx, Gernot; Weigand, Markus A; Sohn, Kai\n\n2018-02-01\n\nSepsis remains a major challenge, even in modern intensive care medicine. The identification of the causative pathogen is crucial for an early optimization of the antimicrobial treatment regime. In this context, culture-based diagnostic procedures (e.g., blood cultures) represent the standard of care, although they are associated with relevant limitations. Accordingly, culture-independent molecular diagnostic procedures might be of help for the identification of the causative pathogen in infected patients. The concept of an unbiased sequence analysis of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from plasma samples of septic patients by next-generation sequencing (NGS) has recently been identified to be a promising diagnostic platform for critically ill patients suffering from bloodstream infections. Although this new approach might be more sensitive and specific than culture-based state-of-the-art technologies, additional clinical trials are needed to exactly define the performance as well as clinical value of a NGS-based approach. Next GeneSiS is a prospective, observational, noninterventional, multicenter study to assess the diagnostic performance of a NGS-based approach for the detection of relevant infecting organisms in patients with suspected or proven sepsis [according to recent sepsis definitions (sepsis-3)] by the use of the quantitative sepsis indicating quantifier (SIQ) score in comparison to standard (culture-based) microbiological diagnostics. The clinical value of this NGS-based approach will be estimated by a panel of independent clinical specialists, retrospectively identifying potential changes in patients' management based on NGS results. Further subgroup analyses will focus on the clinical value especially for patients suffering from a failure of empiric treatment within the first 3 days after onset [as assessed by death of the patient or lack of improvement of the patient's clinical condition (in terms of an inadequate decrease of SOFA-score) or\n\nOptimization of a whole blood phenotyping assay for enumeration of peripheral blood leukocyte populations in multicenter clinical trials.\n\nPubMed\n\nHensley-McBain, Tiffany; Heit, Antje; De Rosa, Stephen C; McElrath, M Juliana; Andersen-Nissen, Erica\n\n2014-09-01\n\nVaccination with viral vectors or adjuvants can induce early changes in circulating peripheral blood leukocytes that are predictive of a protective immune response. In this study, we define an 11-color whole blood antibody staining Trucount Panel (TP1) to enumerate and phenotype the major leukocyte populations in a human vaccine experimental medicine trial setting. TP1 can be prepared up to 8weeks prior to use, enabling bulk preparation at a central laboratory and distribution to clinical sites. Cells in whole blood must be stained within 4h of draw to accurately detect the major cell populations. Staining of cells with TP1 followed by storage and shipping at -80Â°C to a central laboratory has little to no effect on the cell concentrations observed. We also present data from an HIV vaccine multicenter clinical trial obtained using the optimized TP1 assay protocol and show that the data produced accurately correlates with complete blood count (CBC) data. Taken together, these data indicate the optimized TP1 panel assay can be used in a multicenter clinical trial setting to increase our understanding of systemic responses to vaccination or disease.

Multicenter, retrospective, and analytical review was conducted of the visual status and clinical characteristics of patients with RP at first presentation from January 2007 to December 2011. Main outcome measure was the World Health Organization's visual status classification in relation to sex and age at presentation. Data analysis by SPSS (version 15) and statistical significance was assumed at P<0.05. One hundred and ninety-two eyes of 96 patients with mean age of 39.08Â±18.5 years and mode of 25 years constituted the study population; 55 (57.3%) were males and 41 (42.7%) females. Loss of vision 67 (69.8%) and night blindness 56 (58.3%) were the leading symptoms. Twenty-one (21.9%) patients had a positive family history, with RP present in their siblings 15 (71.4%), grandparents 11 (52.3%), and parents 4 (19.4%). Forty (41.7%) were blind at presentation and 23 (24%) were visually impaired. Blindness in six (15%) patients was secondary to glaucoma. Retinal vascular narrowing and retinal pigmentary changes of varying severity were present in all patients. Thirty-five (36.5%) had maculopathy, 36 (37.5%) refractive error, 19 (20%) lenticular opacities, and eleven (11.5%) had glaucoma. RP was typical in 85 patients (88.5%). Older patients had higher rates of blindness at presentation (P=0.005); blindness and visual impairment rate at presentation were higher in males than females (P=0.029). Clinical presentation with advanced diseases, higher blindness rate in older patients, sex-related difference in blindness/visual impairment rates, as well as high glaucoma blindness in RP patients requires urgent attention in southwestern Nigeria.\n\nPREVENtion of HeartMate II Pump Thrombosis Through Clinical Management: The PREVENT multi-center study.\n\nPubMed\n\nMaltais, Simon; Kilic, Ahmet; Nathan, Sriram; Keebler, Mary; Emani, Sitaramesh; Ransom, John; Katz, Jason N; Sheridan, Brett; Brieke, Andreas; Egnaczyk, Gregory; Entwistle, John W; Adamson, Robert; Stulak, John; Uriel, Nir; O'Connell, John B; Farrar, David J; Sundareswaran, Kartik S; Gregoric, Igor\n\n2017-01-01\n\nRecommended structured clinical practices including implant technique, anti-coagulation strategy, and pump speed management (PREVENT [PREVENtion of HeartMate II Pump Thrombosis Through Clinical Management] recommendations) were developed to address risk of early (<3 months) pump thrombosis (PT) risk with HeartMate II (HMII; St. Jude Medical, Inc. [Thoratec Corporation], Pleasanton, CA). We prospectively assessed the HMII PT rate in the current era when participating centers adhered to the PREVENT recommendations. PREVENT was a prospective, multi-center, single-arm, non-randomized study of 300 patients implanted with HMII at 24 participating sites. Confirmed PT (any suspected PT confirmed visually and/or adjudicated by an independent assessor) was evaluated at 3 months (primary end-point) and at 6 months after implantation. The population included 83% men (age 57 years Â± 13), 78% destination therapy, and 83% Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) Profile 1-3. Primary end-point analysis showed a confirmed PT of 2.9% at 3 months and 4.8% at 6 months. Adherence to key recommendations included 78% to surgical recommendations, 95% to heparin bridging, and 79% to pump speeds â¥9,000 RPMs (92% >8,600 RPMs). Full adherence to implant techniques, heparin bridging, and pump speeds â¥9,000 RPMs resulted in a significantly lower risk of PT (1.9% vs 8.9%; p < 0.01) and lower composite risk of suspected thrombosis, hemolysis, and ischemic stroke (5.7% vs 17.7%; p < 0.01) at 6 months. Adoption of all components of a structured surgical implant technique and clinical management strategy (PREVENT recommendations) is associated with low rates of confirmed PT.

To assess the clinical features, outcomes, and prognostic factors of this disease, we retrospectively analyzed 185 HIV-negative CD patients from four medical centers in southern China. The median age was 37Â years. One hundred and twenty-one patients (65.4%) were classified as unicentric CD (UCD) and 64 patients (34.6%) were classified as multicentric CD (MCD). The histology subtype was hyaline-vascular for 132 patients (71.4%), plasma cell for 50 patients (27%), and mixed type for 3 patients (1.6%). The 5-year overall survival (OS) of 185 CD cases was 80.3%. All UCD patients underwent surgical excision, whereas the treatment strategies of MCD patients were heterogeneous. The outcome for UCD patients was better than MCD patients, with 5-year OS rates of 93.6% and 51.2%, respectively. In further analysis of the MCD subgroup, a multivariate analysis using a Cox regression model revealed that age, splenomegaly and pretreatment serum albumin level were independent prognostic factors for OS. This multicenter study comprising the largest sample size to date suggested that MCD is a distinct entity from UCD with a significantly worse outcome. Older age (â¥40Â years), splenomegaly, and hypoalbuminemia were risk factors for poorer MCD prognosis. Â© 2017 The Authors.

We conducted a prospective multicenter study to determine the minimal number of samples and culture media required for accurate diagnosis of PJI. Over a 2-year period, consecutive patients with clinical signs suggesting PJI were included, with five perioperative samples per patient. The bacteriological and PJI diagnosis criteria were assessed using a random selection of two, three, or four samples and compared with those obtained using the recommended five samples (references guidelines). The results obtained with two or three culture media were then compared with those obtained with five culture media for both criteria. The times-to-positivity of the different culture media were calculated. PJI was confirmed in 215/264 suspected cases, with a bacteriological criterion in 192 (89%). The PJI was monomicrobial (85%) or polymicrobial (15%). Percentages of agreement of 98.1% and 99.7%, respectively, for the bacteriological criterion and confirmed PJI diagnosis were obtained when four perioperative samples were considered. The highest percentages of agreement were obtained with the association of three culture media, a blood culture bottle, a chocolate agar plate, and Schaedler broth, incubated for 5, 7, and 14 days, respectively. This new procedure leads to significant cost saving. Our prospective multicenter study showed that four samples seeded on three culture media are sufficient for diagnosing PJI.

However, studies characterizing CRC clinicopathological features in cases from developing countries are still lacking. The goal of this study was to evaluate clinicopathological and demographic features in one of the largest CRC studies in Latin America.The study involved over 1525 CRC cases recruited in a multicenter study in Colombia between 2005 and 2014 as part of ongoing genetic and epidemiological studies. We gathered clinicopathological data such as age at diagnosis, sex, body mass index, tobacco and alcohol consumption, family history of cancer, and tumor features including location, histological type, and stage. Statistical analyses were performed to test the association between age of onset, sex, and clinical manifestations.The average age at CRC diagnosis was 57.4 years, with 26.5% of cases having early-onset CRC (diagnosed by age 50 years). Most cases were women (53.2%; Pâ=â0.009), 49.2% were overweight or obese, 49.1% were regular alcohol drinkers, 52% were smokers/former smokers, and 12.2% reported relatives with cancer. Most tumors in the study were located in the rectum (42.7%), were adenocarcinomas (91.5%), and had advanced stage (T3-T4, 79.8%). Comparisons by sex found that male cases were more likely to be obese (36.5% vs 31.1%; Pâ=â0.001), less likely to have a family history of cancer (9.7% vs 15.3%; Pâ=â0.016), and more likely to have advanced-stage tumors (83.9% vs 76.1%; Pâ=â0.036). Comparisons by age of onset found that early-onset cases were more likely to be women (59.3% vs 51.0%; Pâ=â0.005) and report a family history of cancer (17.4% vs 10.2%; Pâ=â0.001).To our knowledge, our study is the largest report of clinicopathological characterization of Hispanic CRC cases, and we suggest that further studies are needed to understand CRC etiology in diverse Hispanic populations.\n\nClinical manifestations of colorectal cancer patients from a large multicenter study in Colombia\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBohorquez, Mabel; Sahasrabudhe, Ruta; Criollo, Angel; Sanabria-Salas, MarÃ­a Carolina; VÃ©lez, Alejandro; Castro, Jorge Mario; Marquez, Juan Ricardo; Mateus, Gilbert; BolaÃ±os, Fernando; Panqueva, Cesar; Restrepo, Jose Ignacio; Puerta, Juan Dario; Murillo, Raul; Bravo, MarÃ­a Mercedes; HernÃ¡ndez, Gustavo; Rios, Angela; Prieto, Rodrigo; Tomlinson, Ian; Echeverry, Magdalena; Carvajal-Carmona, Luis G.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAbstract Colorectal can"
