He was elected to the Knesset (parliament) as a member of the Labour Party in December 1973 and joined Prime Minister Golda Meir's cabinet as minister of labour in March 1974. After Meir resigned in April, he became party leader and, in June, Israel's first native-born prime minister. During the 1977 electoral campaign, he stepped down as prime minister and Labour leader owing to a controversy over technical irregularities in his finances. He was defense minister in the Labour-Likud coalition governments of 1984-90, taking a hardline position during the Palestinian intifada. In February 1992 he regained the leadership of the Labour Party in a membership vote. After Labour's victory in the June general elections, he again became prime minister. Negotiations with the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) culminated in September 1993 in a historic accord in which Israel recognized the PLO and agreed to limited Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Along with his foreign minister Shimon Peres and PLO leader Yasir Arafat, he received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1994. While attending a peace rally he was assassinated by a Jewish extremist opposed to Israel's concessions to the PLO.\n\nRabinowitz, Yehoshua (b. Nov. 13, 1911, Vishneva, Russia [now in Belarus] - d.

A Navy aviator, he served aboard aircraft carriers in World War II and commanded the carrier Bennington after the war. In 1955, he was chosen to head Navy missile development and brought in the nuclear-tipped Polaris missile on time and on budget. It was the first solid-fuel long-range missile launchable from a submerged submarine. The retired vice admiral was appointed by Pres. Lyndon B. Johnson to head the CIA in 1965.\n\nRabuka\n\nRabuka, Sitiveni (Ligamamada), byname Steve Rabuka (b. Sept. 13, 1948, Nakobo, Cakaudrove province, Fiji), Fijian leader. He commanded the Fiji contingent in Lebanon in 1980 and Fiji's 2nd Battalion with the Sinai Peacekeeping Force in 1984. In between, he served as general staff officer in charge of training; in 1985 he became staff officer (Operations and Training) and was ranked third in the Fijian army. On May 14, 1987, he led a coup that overthrew the recently elected coalition government of Timoci Bavadra. Although Rabuka justified the coup as being necessary to preserve the peace between Indians and ethnic Fijians and to protect the land rights and political power of the latter, his move paved the way for some of the worst violence in the islands' history. On September 25 he staged a second military takeover in his effort to consolidate a power base. This move evoked angry responses, particularly from Australia and New Zealand, which imposed economic sanctions on Fiji. He called a meeting of diplomats from major countries on September 28, but they were prepared to recognize only Gov.-Gen. Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau as head of state. Despite the opposition, Rabuka declared Fiji a republic in October, ending its 113-year link with the British crown. Rabuka's rank as lieutenant colonel had been confirmed in 1982, and after the first coup he was promoted to full colonel and made commander of the Fiji military forces by the governor-general. Following the second coup, he was made brigadier-general and became head of an Interim Military Government. As internal and foreign confidence in Fiji continued to decline and the country neared economic collapse, he admitted defeat and on December 5 announced that he would relinquish power to a civilian government. In 1991 he left the armed forces and was deputy prime minister and minister of home affairs. He subsequently served as elected prime minister (1992-99, 2022- ) and has also been foreign minister (1994, 2022- ) and leader of the opposition (2018-20).\n\nRabun, William (b.

July 24, 1948, Thompson Falls, Mont.), governor of Montana (1993-2001). A Republican, he worked in the Montana attorney general's office for 12 years, then successfully ran for the post himself in 1988. He ran for governor in 1992 after incumbent Republican Stan Stephens retired. Democrats, who then held both houses of the legislature by wide margins, had a spirited primary contest, with state Rep. Dorothy Bradley the winner; Racicot was nominated by a wide margin. In an unusually civil and specific campaign, both called for a 4% sales tax to be voted on in referendum, but Bradley favoured more government while Racicot called for downsizing. He won 51%-49%, and Republicans captured the state House. The sales tax was turned down, but he cut spending and state employment and turned the deficit into a surplus, reformed the expensive workmen's comp law, sponsored a 7% income tax rebate, and proposed welfare reforms. He supported a successful campaign finance referendum and persuaded voters to elect large Republican majorities to both houses in 1994. He was famously unassuming, lobbying legislators himself, speaking at a high school commencement with just one graduate, keeping his phone number listed and driving his own car, declining a salary increase though he was the nation's lowest paid governor. Like many mountain state Republicans, he wanted to revive the Tenth Amendment reserving powers to the state and opposed what he considered unwise federal policies like allowing the herd of bison in Yellowstone National Park to grow too large. He was reelected in 1996, beating former state senator Judy Jacobson, who was chosen only eight days before the election after the original nominee, Chet Blaylock, died of a heart attack. He was chairman of the Republican National Committee in 2002-03.\n\nRacovita, Constantin Mihai (b. c. 1700 - d.

Dec. 19, 1891, Zakopane, Poland - d. July 30, 1993, London, England), Polish diplomat; brother of Roger Adam hrabia Raczynski. He joined the Polish foreign service in 1919, beginning in Copenhagen, then serving as first secretary in the Polish legation in London (1922-26). Thereafter he was deputy chief and then chief of the Eastern Department in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Warsaw.

In 1945 Britain recognized the postwar Communist government established in Warsaw.

The Wijdenbosch administration was forced to call elections a year early in 2000, as citizens of the South American former Dutch colony formed massive protests to call for the president's resignation over the economy's decline. Radhakishun, in response to the calls to step down, told reporters, \"I'm not going anywhere.\" Still, the elections took place in May and the Wijdenbosch administration lost to Radhakishun's former party - the New Front coalition led by Ronald Venetiaan. Radhakishun had been a leader of one of the parties in the New Front, but in 1996 he defected to serve under Wijdenbosch.

(1949-52), and served as vice president of India (1952-62) - and chancellor of the University of Delhi (1953-62) - before becoming president. He urged his countrymen to work for a classless and casteless society. While India's first president, Rajendra Prasad, more than once attempted to assert powers which Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru denied were properly his and was as often rebuffed, Radhakrishnan took the opposite view, that the president's powers were ultimately no more than the right to be informed and to advise. He was knighted in 1931 but no longer used the title after India became independent.\n\nRadi, Abdelwahed (b. Jan. 4, 1935, Salé, Morocco - d. March 26, 2023), justice minister of Morocco (2007-10).

July 11, 1871, Desno Trebarjevo, Hungary [now in Croatia] - d. Aug. 8, 1928, Zagreb, Yugoslavia [now in Croatia]), Croatian politician. An admirer of the Czechoslovak leader Tomás Masaryk, Radic and his brother Antun founded the Croat People's Peasant Party (HPSS) in 1904. A member of the National Council which represented the South Slavs of the Habsburg monarchy in the months before the creation of Yugoslavia (1918), he was deeply suspicious of the motives of Nikola Pasic and of the Serbs in general. He was imprisoned in 1919, and on his release (1920) he sought foreign support for an autonomous Croatian republic. In July 1923 he went abroad to seek support for a Croatian peasant republic, visiting Moscow and affiliating the HPSS with the Communist Peasant International, but returned disappointed to Zagreb in August 1924. The Belgrade government accused him of cooperation with the Comintern and in January 1925 disbanded the party, and imprisoned him and the other HPSS leaders until July 1925 when, in an apparent volte-face, he accepted the constitution and agreed to cooperate with the Serbian Radical Party. He served for some months as minister of education (1925-26). In 1927, unexpectedly collaborating with Svetozar Pribicevic, a Serbian Democratic leader, he formed the peasant-democratic alliance that demanded a federalist reorganization of Yugoslavia. On June 20, 1928, Punisa Racic, a Montenegrin deputy of the Radical Party, shot down the Croat leaders during a parliamentary sitting. Two, including Radic's nephew Pavle, died instantly, three others, including Radic, were seriously wounded. His death soon afterwards brought an end to any semblance of Croat-Serb cooperation and precipitated the establishment of the royal dictatorship.\n\nRadicová\n\nRadicová, Iveta, née Karafiátová (b.

In 1998 he was elected as the Serb member on the three-man inter-ethnic presidency, ousting incumbent Momcilo Krajisnik of the SDS party. Radisic was the president of the Bosnian Serb Socialist Party, a branch of Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic's ruling party. In the election, Radisic was the joint candidate of the Western-backed three-party Sloga (Unity) coalition led by Bosnian Serb president Biljana Plavsic. His victory over Krajisnik was seen by the international community as a step forward in strengthening the peace process. In contacts with Western officials, Radisic said that he fully accepted the Dayton peace accords which created a single Bosnian state with two entities. While having little previous experience of government, he was seen by western officials as a pragmatic leader. He also supported economic reforms. In 1999 he temporarily suspended his participation in the collective presidency in protest at the decision of the international arbiter to proclaim the disputed northern town of Brcko a neutral district. He remained on the presidency until 2002, serving two terms as chairman (1998-99, 2000-01).\n\nRadivojevic, Velimir (b.

In late 1979 he introduced the no-confidence motion in the House of Commons that defeated Joe Clark and his Progressive Conservative government. On Feb. 7, 1982, Rae was elected leader of the Ontario NDP. Later that year he was elected to the provincial legislature for the riding of York South. In 1987 the NDP finished a poor second in the Ontario provincial election, and there were calls for Rae's resignation. In 1989 he considered running for the leadership of the federal NDP because there seemed to be a brighter future for him in federal than in provincial politics. On Sept. 6, 1990, however, all this was forgotten. The NDP won a majority in the Ontario general election and formed its first government in Ontario history. On October 1 Rae was sworn in as Ontario's first NDP premier. A committed federalist, he also took on the post of intergovernmental affairs minister because he believed that people wanted to hear about federal-provincial relations from the premier. The NDP lost the elections of 1995 and he resigned as leader in 1996. He later broke with the NDP and in 2006 unsuccessfully ran for the leadership of the federal Liberal Party. In 2008-13 he was again a member of the House of Commons and in 2011-13 was interim leader of the Liberal Party. In 2020 he was appointed permanent representative to the United Nations.\n\nRae, Maitland Easton (b.

One of the few French leaders to have first pursued a career in the private sector, he began his political career as a supporter of Pres. Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and later was vice-president of Liberal Democracy - a pro-market party that eventually joined Pres. Jacques Chirac's Union for a Popular Movement (UMP). He was president of the Regional Council of Poitou-Charentes (1988-2002), a senator, and minister for small business (1995-97) under President Chirac. After Chirac's reelection in 2002, the relatively unknown Raffarin was chosen as prime minister because of his reputation as an unassuming provincial. It was Raffarin who coined the phrase la France d'en-bas - the ordinary people down below - with whom he identified. With good humour and broad shoulders, he loyally absorbed attacks more properly directed at his master Chirac until his authority had all but ebbed away. In 2003 he oversaw changes of the pensions and health insurance systems which were radical by French standards and triggered widespread opposition from trade unions and the left. He also pushed through a new decentralization programme. But heavy defeats for the ruling UMP at regional and European elections in 2004 prompted Chirac to order a slowdown of controversial reforms and a switch to a more \"social\" domestic agenda. Raffarin survived a reshuffle but his powers were circumscribed. As a new wave of social protests broke out in 2005, his popularity took a nosedive. He reached a disapproval rating of 76%, the highest in the Fifth Republic. The long-suffering Raffarin finally bowed out after the debacle of the failed referendum on the EU constitution.\n\nRaffles, Sir (Thomas) Stamford (Bingley) (b.

Aug. 23, 1934, Bahraman village, near Rafsanjan, Kerman region, Iran - d. Jan. 8, 2017, Tehran, Iran), president of Iran (1989-97). He became a disciple of Ruhollah Khomeini in 1958 and acquired the Shi`ite Muslim title of hojatolislam (a rank below ayatollah). He was in Qom immediately preceding and during the religious unrest and riots of 1963 that led to the expulsion of Khomeini from Iran. He then became Khomeini's chief fundraiser inside the country. In 1964 he himself was arrested for antistate activities. He was arrested on a number of other occasions, serving his longest jail term in 1975-77 on charges of links with left-wing terrorists. After the shah's overthrow and Khomeini's return in 1979, he emerged as a leading member of the Revolutionary Council and became acting interior minister. He was elected to the Majlis (parliament) in 1980 and served as its speaker for the next nine years, gradually becoming the second most powerful figure in Iran's government. In 1987 he was appointed to the Council of Guardians, which ensures legislation conforms to the constitution and Islamic law. Intimately involved in the prosecution of the Iran-Iraq War (1980-88), he helped persuade Khomeini to agree to the ceasefire of August 1988. In 1989 he was elected president with over 90% of the vote. He quickly garnered increased powers for a previously weak executive office and skillfully promoted pragmatic policies in the face of resistance from Islamic hardliners. He was reelected in 1993. In 1997 he became president of the Expediency Council, a powerful arbitration body. He withdrew from parliament in 2000 after receiving an unexpectedly poor election result. In 2005 he unsuccessfully ran for president again. He was often, but not always, considered to be an ayatollah. In 2007-11 he was chairman of the Assembly of Experts.

March 17, 1920, Tungipara village, Faridpur district, Bengal, India [now in Gopalganj district, Bangladesh] - d. Aug. 15, 1975, Dacca [now Dhaka], Bangladesh), Bangladeshi leader. Although jailed briefly as a teenager for agitating for Indian independence, he began his formal political career in 1949 as a co-founder of the Awami League, which advocated political autonomy for East Pakistan, the detached eastern part of the nation of Pakistan. For a short time he held office in the United Front government of 1954, but his separatist politics led him into trouble with successive regimes. His imprisonment in 1966-68, for allegedly plotting against the Punjabi-dominated Pakistan government, incited mob violence that led to the downfall of Pres. Mohammad Ayub Khan in 1969. In the elections of December 1970, the Awami League took all but two of East Pakistan's seats, and thus a majority of all seats, in the National Assembly. After he and Pres. Agha Mohammad Yahya Khan failed to agree on a formula for Bengali autonomy, civil war broke out in March 1971. East Pakistan was proclaimed an independent republic called Bangladesh, with Mujib, newly imprisoned in West Pakistan, as the first president. The troops sent from West Pakistan to regain control of the eastern province were defeated with the help of India in December. In January 1972 he was released, stepped down as president, and became prime minister. In January 1975, faced with a disintegrating economy and widespread corruption in his government, he took tighter control and assumed the presidency again, now with sweeping executive authority. Just seven months later he was killed, along with most of his family, during a military coup.\n\nRahman, Reaz (b. July 1940), Bangladeshi diplomat.

Jan. 19, 1936, Bagbari, Bogra district, East Bengal, India [now in Bangladesh] - d. May 30, 1981, Chittagong, Bangladesh), president of Bangladesh (1977-81). He came to political prominence following the August 1975 military coup in which Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the new nation's first leader, was killed. He was appointed chief of army staff by the new president, Khundaqar Mushtaq Ahmed, and attained still greater powers under Ahmed's successor, Abu Sadat Mohammad Sayem. When Sayem resigned the presidency for health reasons in April 1977, General Zia was the heir apparent. He promised reform and a return to democratic elections, but an attempted coup in November 1977 slowed the process. Nevertheless, eight months later Bangladesh's first elections held under universal suffrage took place. The results endorsed Zia's policies. During Zia's presidency, Bangladesh's relations with Pakistan improved, though there were continued border tensions with India. Zia was assassinated during a coup attempt led by Maj.Gen. Mohammad Abdul Manzoor, who in 1971 had fought beside him in the battle to win independence for Bangladesh (formerly East Pakistan).\n\nZillur Rahman\n\nRahula\n\nRahman, (Mohammad) Zillur (b.

He became a Grimaldi (i.e., received his mother's family name) in accord with a sovereign ordinance of March 18, 1920. Educated in England, Switzerland, and the University of Montpellier in France, he served in the French army (1944) during World War II and after the war studied at the University of Paris. His mother having renounced her rights to succession in 1944, Rainier succeeded as ruling prince upon the death of Louis II in 1949. He brought Hollywood glamour to Monaco by marrying (April 18, 1956) U.S. actress Grace Kelly, who became Princess Grace de Monaco (b. Nov. 12, 1929, Philadelphia, Pa. - d. in an automobile accident Sept. 14, 1982, Monte Carlo, Monaco); they had three children - Caroline (b. 1957), Albert (b. 1958), and Stéphanie (b. 1965). He led Monaco into an age of skyscrapers, international banking, and business. By the 1990s, gambling accounted for less than 5% of Monaco's annual income, the bulk of revenue coming from value added tax, tourism, commerce, and industry. Billionaires and millionaires poured in, drawn by the absence of income tax and the protection offered by the presence of policemen and security cameras on almost every street. Critics said the property boom had turned the former coastal beauty spot into a \"little Manhattan.\" In 1993 Monaco gained the political recognition he sought for his principality with its entry into the United Nations.\n\nRainiharo (b. 17... - d.

Aug. 30, 1981, Tehran, Iran), prime minister (1980-81) and president (1981) of Iran. He joined the Iranian Liberation Movement in 1960 and was imprisoned three times for his political activities and tortured by the security police, Savak; in 1980 he exhibited the scars on his feet to the UN Security Council. He headed the Ministry of Education in the first cabinet formed after the 1979 revolution. As a leading member of the clergy-dominated Islamic Republican Party (IRP), he was elected by the Majlis (parliament) on Aug. 11, 1980, as the second prime minister of the Islamic Republic of Iran. For more than nine months following the resignation of Mehdi Bazargan, Iran had had no prime minister. Three candidates for the post proposed by Pres. Abolhassan Bani-Sadr were rejected by the IRP, and Raja´i became prime minister against the advice of the president. He soon came in conflict with Bani-Sadr over his choice of ministers; only two-thirds of those originally put forward by Raja´i were included in the cabinet approved by the Majlis on September 10. Six weeks after Raja´i became prime minister, Iraq launched its attack against Iran. According to Tehran radio, he replied to an offer of Soviet military assistance by telling the Soviet ambassador that \"Iran is not ready to exchange its independence for Soviet aid.\" In New York City in October to address the UN Security Council, Raja´i declared that \"a fair settlement can be found only if the aggressor is conquered and punished, this is our final position.\" When Bani-Sadr fell from power in 1981, Raja´i was elected president by an overwhelming majority. But less than a month after taking office, he was killed by a bomb blast at the prime minister's office in Tehran.\n\nRajalin, Johan friherre von (b. Nov. 19, 1715, Karlskrona, Blekinge, Sweden - d.

June 20, 1949, Palatuwa, Matara district, Southern province, Ceylon [now Sri Lanka]), president (2019-22) and defense minister (2020-22) of Sri Lanka; brother of Chamal Rajapakse and Mahinda Rajapakse. Defense secretary under Mahinda Rajapakse's presidency in 2005-15, he came to be known as \"The Terminator\" for his ruthless crushing of Tamil rebels to end a decades-long civil war. He denied allegations that at least 40,000 minority Tamil civilians were killed by troops under his command during the closing months of the war, but the accusations bolstered his tough-guy image in the eyes of the majority Sinhalese. He was also considered the architect of \"white van\" abductions under Mahinda, when dissidents and journalists were grabbed in unmarked vehicles and disappeared, allegedly the victims of extrajudicial killings. He made no bones about winning the 2019 elections with the overwhelming support of his own majority Sinhala-Buddhist community. Soon after coming to power he drastically cut taxes to win over his financial backers. Then the COVID-19 pandemic hammered tourism and overseas remittances - both mainstays of the economy - leaving the country facing a foreign-exchange crisis. His banning of agrochemicals in April 2021, reversed six months later, led to crop failures. The country defaulted on its debt for the first time in its history in May 2022 and declared bankruptcy in July. After protesters angry over power blackouts, shortages of basic goods, and rising prices stormed the presidential palace, Rajapakse fled via Maldives to Singapore, from where he emailed his resignation. He returned to Sri Lanka in September.\n\nRajapakse, Sir Lalita (Abhaya) (Lalita also spelled Lalitha), original name Louis Alexander Rajapakse (b. May 3, 1900 - d. May 25, 1976), justice minister of Ceylon (1947-53); knighted 1952. He was also ambassador to France (1965-66) and high commissioner to the United Kingdom (1967-69).\n\nM. Rajapakse\n\nRajapakse, (Percy) Mahinda, also spelled Rajapaksa (b. Nov. 18, 1945, Weeraketiya, Hambantota district, Southern province, Ceylon [now Sri Lanka]), prime minister (2004-05, 2018, 2019-22) and president (2005-15) of Sri Lanka; brother of Chamal Rajapakse. He turned to politics at the age of 24, entering parliament from the district of Hambantota, a constituency his father had represented between 1947 and 1960. He was in the forefront of many a struggle to safeguard workers' rights; in 1992, he led a 182-km protest walk from the capital Colombo to the deep south Kataragama. He was a controversial minister in Pres. Chandrika Kumaratunga's cabinet from 1994 to 2001. As labour minister he moved to introduce a labour charter, but his reforms were resisted by employers who pressured Kumaratunga to oust him from the ministry. His labour charter was not implemented. In 1997 he was shifted to the fisheries ministry where he became even more popular among the public by setting up houses for fishermen who had been living in temporary dwellings for decades. Despite his work as fisheries minister, the country's Buddhist clergy, who oppose fishing as a sin, took the extraordinary step of conferring an honour on him for his services to the country as a politician. In 2002 he became the leader of the opposition and in 2004 prime minister of a coalition government. In 2005 he was elected president, mainly with the votes of the majority Sinhala community, while his opponent Ranil Wickremesinghe drew the bulk of votes of the minority Tamil community - including areas in the north and east, where there was a boycott campaign by the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). He also took the defense and finance portfolios in the new cabinet. After the 26-year civil war ended with the defeat of the LTTE in 2009, he was reelected in 2010. He pushed through laws increasing presidential powers and filled the government with family members and friends. In 2015 he was defeated by Maithripala Sirisena, a former ally who broke with him in 2014. Rajapakse's new party, Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna, pulled off a stunning victory in local elections in February 2018. In October 2018 Sirisena appointed him prime minister after dismissing Wickremesinghe in a constitutionally questionable move. He was also appointed minister of finance and economic affairs. But Wickremesinghe had a majority in parliament, and when Sirisena's attempt to dissolve it was struck down by the Supreme Court, Rajapakse resigned in December. He again became prime minister (and minister of defense, finance, economic and policy planning, Buddha Sasana, cultural affairs, religious affairs, urban development, water supply, and housing) after his brother Gotabaya was elected president in 2019. Following a strong win in 2020 parliamentary elections, he retained his position as prime minister (keeping the portfolios of finance, Buddha Sasana, religious and cultural affairs, and urban development and housing; in 2021 he exchanged these for economic policies and plan implementation). In 2022 he resigned after a hard-hitting economic crisis led to weeks of sometimes violent protests.\n\nRajapakse, (Lakshman) Namal, also spelled Rajapaksa (b. April 10, 1986, Colombo, Sri Lanka), Sri Lankan politician; son of Mahinda Rajapakse. He was minister of youth and sports (2020-22) and development coordination and supervision (2021-22).\n\nRajapakse, Shashindra (Kumara), also spelled Rajapaksa (b.

[now in Dashoguz velayat, Turkmenistan] - d. Oct. 24, 2004), economy and finance minister of Turkmenistan (1996-2000). He was also head of the Central Statistics Office (1984-87) and chairman of the State Committee for Statistics (1987-90) and the State Planning Committee (1990) of the Turkmen S.S.R. and minister of state property (1992-93) and nature protection (2001-04) and a deputy prime minister (1992-93, 1994-96) of Turkmenistan.\n\nRajaratnam, Sinnathamby (b. Feb. 25, 1915, Ceylon [now Sri Lanka] - d. Feb. 22, 2006, Singapore), foreign minister of Singapore (1965-80). One of the founder members of the People's Action Party, he was first elected to the Legislative Assembly in 1959 and served in the Kampong Glam constituency for 29 years. Soon after being elected, he was appointed minister of culture (1959-65). In 1963 he made the first television speech to be broadcast to Singaporeans. As Singapore's first foreign minister, he worked from scratch to set up the Foreign Service and formulated a foreign policy to put then little-known Singapore on the map of international politics. At home he introduced the policy of multiracialism, insisting that the three main races be accorded equal importance and significance. Based on this sentiment he penned the Singapore Pledge: \"We the citizens of Singapore pledged ourselves as one united people. Regardless of race, language, or religion...\" He was also minister of labour (1968-71) and second deputy prime minister (1980-85); his last government post was that of senior minister (1985-88).\n\nRajasa, (Muhammad) Hatta (b.

Sept. 28, 1927, General Roca, Río Negro province, Argentina), justice and education minister of Argentina (1986-87).\n\nA. Rajoelina\n\nRajoelina, Andry (Nirina) (b. May 30, 1974), president of the High Authority of Transition (2009-14) and president (2019-23, 2023- ) of Madagascar. A former disc jockey, nicknamed \"TGV\" (after the French high-speed train) for his quick-fire personality, he was elected mayor of Antananarivo in December 2007, defeating the ruling party's candidate. On Dec. 13, 2008, the government closed down his private television network \"Viva\" after it broadcast an interview with former president Didier Ratsiraka. In 2009, accusing Pres. Marc Ravalomanana of being a dictator starving his people, Rajoelina used his charisma to mount a brazen challenge for the country's top office. In January he called for a general strike that turned violent and claimed dozens of lives. On January 31 he proclaimed himself in charge of Madagascar's affairs. On February 3 the government removed him as mayor. On February 7 he announced the setup of a transitional government. Turmoil and uncertainty persisted until March 17, when Ravalomanana gave up, having lost the support of the army. Rajoelina, who had turned the initials of his nickname into his movement's name: Tanora Gasy Vonona, or Young Dynamic Madagascan, repeatedly condemned what he said were shrinking freedoms on the island and also fiercely criticized a massive project to lease vast swathes of farmland to South Korean industrial giant Daewoo. He promised to organize a fresh presidential election within two years. The existing constitution, however, required a president to be at least 40, which ruled him out. In 2014 he handed over power to elected president Hery Rajaonarimampianina. In the 2018 elections, however, he defeated both Ravalomanana and Rajaonarimampianina. In 2023 he was easily reelected in a poll boycotted by most of the opposition after media reports had revealed he had acquired French nationality in 2014, by which he should have lost his Madagascan nationality under local law.\n\nP. Rajoelina\n\nRajoelina, Patrick (b. 1954), foreign minister of Madagascar (2021-22).\n\nRajoy\n\nRajoy (Brey), Mariano (b. March 27, 1955, Santiago de Compostela, Spain), prime minister of Spain (2011-18). In 1977 he joined what would later become the Popular Party (PP). He was elected to the parliament of Galicia in 1981 and to the national parliament in 1986. In the PP government of Prime Minister José María Aznar he was minister of public administration (1996-99), education and culture (1999-2000), the presidency (2000-01, 2002-03), and interior (2001-02) and first deputy prime minister (2000-03). In 2003 Aznar handpicked Rajoy as the party's new leader; he took over in 2004, when the PP was expected to claim another victory in the general elections, but it was defeated. Rajoy again failed to lead the PP to victory in 2008. As the European sovereign debt crisis continued to escalate, however, the PP ousted the ruling Socialists in a landslide victory in 2011, winning the biggest parliamentary majority in nearly three decades. Rajoy, a social conservative, was especially outspoken about curbing abortion rights and in his opposition to same-sex marriages. Nevertheless, he helped lead the party from the hard right to centre-right. Many hoped that Rajoy and the PP would help steer the country out of spiraling recession, but at first the turmoil intensified; he had to handle a nationwide banking crisis, involving the creation of a so-called bad bank, and introduced unpopular austerity measures as unemployment reached 25% in 2012. In the December 2015 elections, he fell short of a majority, but no alternative government could be formed. New elections in June 2016 did not materially change the situation, and he was ultimately confirmed in October 2016 when the Socialists abstained from the vote. In 2017 he imposed direct rule on Catalonia after its attempt at secession. In 2018 his government was brought down by a Socialist censure motion following a corruption scandal involving the PP. He then resigned the party leadership and his parliamentary seat.\n\nRakcevic, Zarko (b.

Propped up by 25,000 Russian troops, he signed a peace accord with opposition forces in 1997. In 1998 he joined the People's Democratic Party of Tajikistan. Reelected in 1999, 2006, 2013, and 2020, he ruled in an authoritarian manner, placed tight curbs on opposition and Islamic fundamentalist activities, and developed close links with Russia and Uzbekistan.\n\nRákosi\n\nRákosi, Mátyás, original surname (until 1904) Rosenfeld (b. March 14, 1892, Ada, Hungary [now in Vojvodina, Serbia] - d. Feb. 5, 1971, Gorky, Russian S.F.S.R. [now Nizhny Novgorod, Russia]), Hungarian leader. An early adherent of Social Democracy, he was taken prisoner on the Russian front in 1915 and returned to Hungary as a Communist in 1918. In March-August 1919 he served as commissar for socialist production in the Communist government of Béla Kun, on the fall of which he escaped to Moscow. He was entrusted with various missions abroad. In 1924 he was dispatched to refound a Hungarian Communist Party, but he was apprehended by the Hungarian police in 1925 and, after a trial in which he defended himself with great courage and fluency, was sentenced in 1927 to 8½ years in prison from the date of his arrest. On the expiration of this term he was rearrested and sentenced (1934) to life imprisonment on new charges. In 1940 he was allowed to go to Moscow in exchange for some Hungarian battle flags captured by Russia in 1848-49. He returned with the Soviet army at the end of 1944 and became general secretary of the Hungarian Workers' (Communist) Party (1945-56). In 1945 he was also a member of the High National Council, the collective head of state. He soon consolidated political power in his hands, serving as deputy prime minister (1945-52) and prime minister (1952-53). Following Stalin's death in 1953, he was partially demoted in favour of the reform-minded Imre Nagy. In 1955 he was able to effect the dismissal of Nagy, but in July 1956 he was forced to resign from his party position by Nikita Khrushchev in order to placate the Yugoslav leader Marshal Tito, whom Rákosi had offended. His Stalinist methods and his subservience to Moscow had made him widely unpopular, and shortly before revolution broke out in October 1956, he fled again to the U.S.S.R. In 1962 he was stripped of his membership in the Hungarian party.\n\nRakotoarijaona\n\nJ. Rakotomalala\n\nRakotoarijaona, Désiré (b. June 19, 1934), prime minister of Madagascar (1977-88).

[executed] Sept. 11, 1941, Oryol, Russian S.F.S.R.), chairman of the Council of People's Commissars and people's commissar for foreign affairs of the Ukrainian S.S.R. (1919, 1920-23).

He was also minister of religion and education (1944).\n\nRakowski\n\nRakowski, Mieczyslaw (Franciszek) (b. Dec. 1, 1926, Kowalewko, Bydgoszcz province, Poland - d. Nov. 8, 2008, Warsaw, Poland), prime minister of Poland (1988-89). An officer in the Polish Army in 1945-49, he joined the Communist party in 1946 and from 1975 was a member of its Central Committee. In 1958-82 he was deputy editor-in-chief and then editor-in-chief of the prestigious weekly Polityka. In those years he was, in the eyes of popular opinion, a \"liberal-minded\" party man. In 1981 he became vice-president of the Council of Ministers and was appointed chairman of a committee dealing with the free trade union Solidarity. Subsequently, his popular image as a liberal changed completely, especially after a television appearance at the Lenin Shipyard in which he displayed considerable arrogance and contempt toward workers. After his appointment in 1985 as a deputy speaker of the Sejm (parliament), his political career seemed to decline. However, in 1987 he was elected to the Politburo and a secret document called \"Rakowski's view\" was circulated, including an accurate appraisal of the Polish political and economic situation. His appointment as prime minister in 1988 still came as a surprise. Viewed as an opportunist and a staunch opponent of Solidarity, he was not generally popular. Although a hardline Communist, he was convinced that far-reaching economic reforms were badly needed in Poland and that the free market economy should be introduced. One of his first \"economic\" moves was to close down the unprofitable Lenin Shipyard in Gdansk, the cradle of Solidarity. This was widely recognized as a political rather than an economic move and met strong protest by the shipyard's employees, one of whom was Lech Walesa. In 1989 he resigned as premier and was elected first secretary of the Communist party, which dissolved itself in 1990.\n\nRakusan, Vít (b.

He was also president of the Supreme Court (1849-61).\n\nG. (I.) Rallis\n\nRallis, Georgios (Ioannou) (b. Dec. 26, 1918, Athens, Greece - d. March 15, 2006, Athens), prime minister of Greece (1980-81); son of Ioannis Rallis; grandson of Dimitrios Rallis and Georgios Theotokis; nephew of Ioannis Theotokis. In 1950 he went into politics, being elected to parliament thereafter under the banner of the main right-wing party in its different mutations - Populist Party, Greek Rally, and Konstantinos Karamanlis's National Radical Union, which he helped found in 1955. He served in several cabinet posts from 1954 - minister of the presidency of the government (1954-56, 1974, 1974-77), communications and public works (1956-58), interior (1961-63, 1974), public order (1967), social welfare (1967), education (1976-77), coordination (1977-78, 1980-81), and foreign affairs (1978-80). Being a staunch anti-Communist he quit the party with others after disagreeing over the reform of the electoral law, which, he prophesied, would bolster the extreme left. Although his prophecy was vindicated, he rejoined Karamanlis in 1961 and was reelected. After the 1967 military coup, he was arrested repeatedly for his anti-regime activity. With the collapse of the dictatorship in 1974, he joined the first national unity government under Karamanlis, and when the New Democracy party won a landslide victory he became Karamanlis's closest cabinet aide. When in May 1980 parliament elected Karamanlis president of the republic, Rallis was chosen by New Democracy to succeed him as party leader and prime minister. The vote in the party's parliamentary caucus was 88 for Rallis against 84 for his sole adversary, Defense Minister Evangelos Averoff-Tossizza, a favourite of the party's right wing. Rallis's political moderation and candour guaranteed that the party would abide by Karamanlis's middle-of-the-road policies, and this tipped the scales in his favour. However, he lost the 1981 elections to the Panhellenic Socialist Movement, and thereafter he was replaced as party leader. He ran for parliament for the last time in April 1990.\n\nRallis, Ioannis (Dimitriou) (b. 1878, Athens, Greece - d. Oct. 26, 1946, Athens), foreign minister (1932-33) and prime minister (1943-44) of Greece; son of Dimitrios Rallis. He was also minister of marine (1920-21), economy (1921-22), interior (1933, 1944), communication (1933), aviation (1933-34), agriculture (1943-44), national defense (1943-44), labour (1943-44), and provisioning (1943).

He was parliamentary secretary to the government of Bihar (1937-39) and vice-president of the Bihar branch of the All-India Trade Union Congress (1940-46). He became a member of the All-India Congress Committee and during World War II was twice imprisoned by the British (1940 and 1942-43). In 1946 he became the youngest member of the provisional government. After independence he held a number of ministerial posts, including labour (1947-52), communications (1952-56), transport and railways (1956-62), transport and communications (1962-63), labour, employment, and rehabilitation (1966-67), agriculture and irrigation (1974-77), and, perhaps most effectively, defense (1970-74, 1977-79). Breaking with Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1977 over her \"state of emergency\" rule, he formed the Congress for Democracy, which, in alliance with the Janata Party, defeated Gandhi in that year's general elections. He wanted to be prime minister, but lost out to Morarji Desai. His Congress for Democracy then merged with Janata. He was deputy prime minister for some time in 1979, then became leader of the opposition. In 1980 he left the Janata Party and joined the Congress (U) party of Devaraj Urs, and in 1981 he formed his own Congress (J) party.\n\nRam Lal, Thakur, earlier known as Ram Lal Chauhan (b.

He entered government service in 1948 as a subregistrar but soon gave this up to become an actor. He also produced and directed films himself. An enthusiastic and successful campaigner for worthy causes, during India's border conflict with China in 1962 and the war with Pakistan in 1965, Rama Rao was active in raising money for national defense funds. In 1968 Pres. Zakir Husain conferred on him the Badmashri (Lotus) order. In March 1982 he turned to politics and founded the Telugu Desam (\"Land of the Telugus\") party to bring back, in his own words, \"the 3,000-year-old heritage of the Telugu people.\" After a nine-month-long campaign in which he traveled more than 35,000 km and was seen and heard by 30 million people, his party emerged victorious in the January 1983 legislative assembly elections in Andhra Pradesh. He became chief minister of the state, but was forced to quit the following year after a conflict with Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. He was reinstated later in 1984. Reelected in 1985, he served a four-year term before retiring. He made another comeback in 1994 but quit the state post in 1995 amid a row over the role of his new wife in the affairs of the state. His son-in-law, Chandrababu Naidu, toppled him as chief minister by wooing many lawmakers and some of his sons to his side. Thousands of people poured into the state capital of Hyderabad on hearing the news of Rama Rao's death. The state government, led by his estranged family, declared a seven-day mourning period.\n\nRama Rao, V. (b. Dec. 11, 1935, near Masulipatam [now Machilipatnam, Andhra Pradesh], India - d.

He never lost his star appeal and commanded the kind of adulation normally associated only with much younger stars. He became heavily involved in politics in the 1950s and built up support through his fan clubs. Throughout his life he campaigned for the rights of Tamils, and in the 1980s he was closely identified with the Tamil separatist movement in Sri Lanka. In 1972 he founded the All-India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam Party, which promoted the Tamil cause.
