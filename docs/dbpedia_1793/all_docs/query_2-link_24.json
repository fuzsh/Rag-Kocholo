During World War II many of these individuals were imprisoned because of the movement’s opposition to state Shinto. Makiguchi died in prison in 1944. Nonetheless, Toda, who was released from prison in July 1945 was instrumental in reorganizing the society under its present name of Soka Gakkai in February 1946. By July 1968 it was estimated that the number of households associated with the movement was in excess of 6.5 million.

Apart from being a symbol of martyred innocence, Husayn is popularly venerated in Iran in his role of hajat-deh (need-giver), who “grants prayers and brings succor when addressed with proper demonstrations of self abasement and helplessness.” Mary Heglund, “Two Images of Husain: Accommodation and Revolution in an Iranian Village,” in Nikki R. Keddie, ed., Religion and Politics in Iran (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1983), 218–235. The ‘Ashura ceremonies, which are held annually, celebrate the “martyrdom” of Husayn, who is considered by Shi’as to be the Third Imam. He died on the tenth day of Moharram in 680 CE. Husayn and 72 companions were ambushed and slaughtered by the oppressive, tyrannical Ummayad ruler Yazid\n\nin the City of Karbala.
