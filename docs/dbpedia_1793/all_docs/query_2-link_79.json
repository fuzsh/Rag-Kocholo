The first of these was with Grand Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in Neauphle-le-Chateau, France, on January 2, 1979. I have subsequently interviewed the former prime minister, Shahpour Bakhtiar, the former president, Abo'l-Hasan Bani-Sadr; two of the surviving highest ranking generals who took over the army after the Shah's departure on January 16, 1979; the former British ambassador to Iran, Sir Anthony Parsons; the former American ambassador to Iran, William Sullivan; the former director of the Iranian National Oil Company, Hasan Nazih who was the first important nationalist figure to break with Khomeini, and many other Iranians most of whom prefer to remain anonymous. I was also present during an exclusive interview with the former Empress, Farah Pahlavi, conducted by my wife, Kathryn Arjomand. Furthermore, at the time of the outbreak of the revolution I was working on a project on religion and the state in Shi'ism (The Shadow of God and the Hidden Imam, published by the University of Chicago Press in 1984). In 1977 and 1978, the research on the project brought me to encounters with \"The Signs of God\" (literal translation of ayatollah), including the late Grand Ayatollahs Kazim Shari'at-madari and 'Abdollah Shirazi and the Grand Ayatollah Shehab al-Din Najafi Mar'ashi, who were then quite accessible and could talk fairly objectively and openly about the issues that were suddenly to become capital with the establishment of Islamic government. I am grateful to all the above for their assistance with this project. The crucial period for the writing of the manuscript was the year I spent at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton (1984-85). I am most grateful to the Institute's faculty of the School of Social Science, to the fellow members with whom I discussed my work, and to the staff, especially Lucille Allsen whose editorial suggestions while typing the manuscript I came to value. I also wish to express my gratitude to the State University of New York at Stony Brook for providing me with a grant-in-aid to start the project at an\n\nviii\n\nPreface\n\nearly stage, and to Professors Lewis Coser, John Gagnon, Dick Howard, and James Rule for their comments on an earlier draft of this book at a symposium organized by the Department of Sociology. Professor A. K. S. Lambton read and commented on an earlier draft of the manuscript. I am very grateful to her. Finally, I wish to thank the editors of Government and Opposition and Middle Eastern Studies for their kind permission to use materials previously published in their journals.

It is clear that the Islamic revolution in Iran is a cataclysm as significant and as unprecedented in world history as the French revolution of 1789 and the Russian revolution of 1917. It has indeed a good claim to being considered the surprise of the century, a century not devoid of surprises. Few considered the rise of theocracy in a modernized state a possibility, and even fewer thought it might result from a popular revolution. What added to the wry poignancy of the event was that the Ayatollah succeeded in raising the banner of Islamic theocracy in the land of the Shah, the last King of Kings who, until the day of his departure, commanded a large army equipped with the latest weapons. The unfolding of the Islamic revolution ran completely counter to the conventional wisdom about revolutions, and more generally, about the philosophy of history. A White House aide who had to face some of its most unpleasant consequences expresses the surprise caused by this revolution very well when he writes: \"The notion of a popular revolution leading to the establishment of a theocratic state seemed so unlikely as to be absurd.\" And further, \"what was truly 'unthinkable' . . . was not the Shah's demise but the emergence of a clerical-dominated Islamic republic.\"1 The inability to understand the unfolding of the Islamic revolution is by no means confined to American observers. It also characterizes many of the key actors in the revolution who paid dearly for their incomprehension and consequent misreadings of the events and trends. In fact, the widespread inability to comprehend the Islamic revolution persists in the Iranian emigre communities and accounts for a mushrooming of the most fantastic conspiracy theories among them. The fact that a phenomenon is surprising and defies understanding in terms of stereotypes does not mean that it is incomprehensible. What it does mean is that there is something wrong with the conventional wisdom of the scholars and with the common sense notions of the participants in the revolutionary events. Both of these beliefs are actually quite close as they both stem from the modern myth of revolution. Revolution is one of the most powerful myths of modern politics. During the nineteenth century, revolutions came to be seen as glorious milestones in the liberation of humanity from oppression and its inexorable march toward progress and freedom. Under the 3\n\n4\n\nIntroduction\n\nimpact of twentieth century Marxism, the modern political myth of revolution was fused with the notion of the struggle and inevitable victory of the rising classes. Equipped with such preconceptions, most observers and many participants did not make much headway in comprehending the unfolding revolution in Iran, a revolution that was neither \"bourgeois\" nor \"proletarian\" and whose slogans emphasized neither democracy nor progress. Those who were disposed to see the revolution of 1979 in Iran from the perspective of the wars of national liberation and the Third World anti-imperialist struggle could persist longer in their misconceptions, but their dismissal of Islam as a mere camouflage for nationalism or socialism can now clearly be seen as no less erroneous. For the observers and participants who adhered to this last view, Ayatollah Khomeini would variously be a Gandhi to be succeeded by a Nehru or—for those of a more extreme persuasion—\"the Chiang Kai-Chek of Iran\" but a Chiang (and here we are forced to mix China and Afghanistan in our metaphor) who would pave the way for an Iranian Babrak Karmal. To the chagrin of these observers, the Ayatollah was not to be \"Bazarganized\"2 as was the third-worldist president of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Bani-Sadr. Discard the conventional wisdom and dispassionately discount the modern political myth of revolution, and you will have no difficulty understanding Iran's Islamic revolution. I hope the following pages will demonstrate that the Islamic revolution, though unprecedented in some respects, can indeed be understood in terms of familiar categories and concepts. They should make the Islamic revolution comprehensible in two ways: by putting it in the context of the relationship between Shi'ism and political order in the history of Iran, and by comparing it to other revolutions. Revolution can be defined as the collapse of the political order—the prevalent system of authority—and its replacement by a new one. Modern revolutions occur in political orders that are dominated by the state. However, in addition to the state, political order comprises other institutions and corporate entities that have some measure of autonomous authority in the religious, judiciary, or economic spheres. The most important of these is usually the religious institution, that is, the church or its equivalent. As will be seen in Chapter 1, a distinctively Shi'ite dualistic system of authority became prevalent in Iran in the nineteenth century. The modernizers of the twentieth century sought to destroy this dualistic political order and to replace it by one exclusively dominated by a centralized bureaucratic state. They succeeded in erecting such a monolithically secular political order, but only to see it taken over by the surviving forces of theocracy in 1979. Modern revolutions occur not in stagnant societies, but in those undergoing considerable social change. In Iran, as in the rest of the Middle East and the Third World, the centralized bureaucratic state has been the chief agent of social change in the twentieth century. Social change results in social dislocation and normative disturbance. The dislocated groups and individuals need to be reintegrated into societal community3 and may also demand inclusion in political society. Modern states try to meet these needs by increasing controlled political participation but often fail. The rival integrative social and\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\npolitical movements that consequently arise to meet these demands have often been a major contributing factor to the occurrence of revolutions. In Iran, the most effective of these movements drew its inspiration from Shi'ite Islam and was led by Shi'ite men of religion. The collapse of the political order in revolutions is caused by two sets of factors: its internal weaknesses and vulnerabilities, and the concerted action of the social groups and individuals opposing it. Assessing the vulnerability of a political order obviously brings the state to the forefront of discussion. So does understanding the motives of the supporters of revolution, albeit less obviously and less directly. The groups and individuals who support a revolution can have political motives for opposing the regime, notably resistance to loss of power and demands for political participation and citizenship, which are often set in motion by modernization of the state. They can also have moral motives. These often require the preconditions of social dislocation and normative disturbance, which are in turn largely or partly the consequence of the economic and developmental policies of the state. An adequate explanation of the causes and preconditions of the Islamic revolution in Iran must therefore begin with an account of the prior rise of the modern bureaucratic state and the impact of its policies. It should also be stated at the outset that the theory of revolution implicit in this book distinguishes between the preconditions and causes of revolutions, on the one hand, and their consequences, on the other. It assumes that one set of factors bears on the preconditions and causes of a revolution; a separate set of factors determines its direction and can predict its outcome. According to this theory, the rise of the modern state and its consequences, concentration of power in a centralized bureaucratic state and increasing integration of the various segments of society into a unified nation-state, constitute the most important preconditions of modern revolutions; the factors making for a temporary paralysis of the state compose these revolutions' most important immediate causes. By contrast, the direction and consequences of modern revolutions is to be sought in the international development of the general myth of revolution and the specific ideologies on which it has been grafted, the latest of these being the contemporary Islamic ideology. A historical perspective is necessary to understand both the causes and the consequences of the revolution in Iran. Regarding its causation, the Iranian revolution of 1979 is distinctly modern in that its occurrence is inconceivable without the prior rise of the centralized state, its transformation of Iranian society, and finally, its paralysis after the onset of crisis in 1978. At the same time, Islamic ideology, which has determined the direction of the Iranian revolution—though novel in that it incorporates the modern myth of revolution, could not have succeeded without the unusual institutional assets of its proponents, the Shi'ite men of religion. The story of the Islamic revolution in Iran must therefore begin with the establishment of Shi'ism as the state religion in 1501, and it should include a brief account of the consolidation of Shi'ite clerical power and the prevalence of a dual system of authority until the onset of centralization and the expansion of the power of the state.\n\n6\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis historical background is indispensable for explaining why, when a modern political revolution occurred in Iran in 1979, it was destined to be an Islamic revolution with the goal of establishing a theocracy. Part I covers the historical background of the Islamic revolution with special attention to the rise of the modern state and its impact on the hierocracystate relationship. As the book is addressed not only to the specialist but also to the general reader, those who are not particularly interested in the sociology of state formation or in the finer points of Iranian history may prefer to begin with Parts II and III and then return to Part I for the amplification of the historical context. Part II deals not only with the immediate causes of the revolution of 1.979 but also with its consequences. Chapter 5 traces the emergence of an Islamic revolutionary movement under Khomeini's leadership in its immediate sociopolitical context. The collapse of the Pahlavi political order and the fall of the Shah are explained in Chapter 6. Chapter 7 deals with the revolutionary power struggle after the collapse of monarchy. It underscores the determination and consummate skill with which Khomeini and his militant followers, as the bearers of the Islamic ideology and advocates of theocratic clericalism, triumphed over the other contending groups. Finally, the consolidation of Islamic theocracy and its distinctive institutional structure are treated in Chapter 8. Together, these chapters give an analytical account of the transition from one monistic political order to another, from the temporal absolutism of the Shah to the theocratic absolutism of Khomeini. The reader will find the measured intrusion of my value judgments in Chapters 6 and 7 at variance with the detached and dispassionate tone of the rest of the book. It would have been misleading for me to present my account under the guise of scholarly objectivity and to hide my deep emotional, if not active, involvement in the events I analyze in these chapters. Nor was it necessary. But a brief comment regarding my judgment on the new middle class, which lost the revolutionary struggle between September 1978 and June 1981, may be in order because the reader may find this judgment too severe. Perhaps it should be considered together with the backhanded compliment I pay the new middle class in the epigram to Part III. Although the analysis of Part II is self-sufficient in accounting for the course of revolutionary events in causal terms, it is hardly adequate for a full understanding of the Islamic revolution in Iran. More is needed. We need to assess the significance of the Islamic revolution, both in the history of Shi'ism and in world history. This is the objective of Part III. Chapter 9 assesses the paradoxical impact of the Islamic revolution on the Shi'ite tradition, which amounts to nothing short of a revolution in Shi'ism. Last but by no means least, in Chapter 10 I have sought to bring out the significance of the Islamic revolution in Iran as the last of the \"great revolutions\" by comparing it to other revolutions. No major event in world history can be understood without, at the same time, throwing new light on earlier events of the same kind. In fact, in making the Islamic revolution intelligible in comparative perspective, quite a few surprises regarding the neglected or misinterpreted aspects of\n\nIntroduction\n\n1\n\nother revolutions are brought to light, thereby enhancing our understanding of revolution in general. As I hope to persuade the reader, the Islamic revolution in Iran forces us to reassess the balance of progressive and reactionary aspects, of traditionalism and modernism, in all revolutions. A glossary of Persian words is supplied with the appendices to make the reading easier and terms are translated when they first appear in the text. No diacritical marks are used in the text. When dual dates are given, the first figure refers to the common era (A.D.) and the second to the Islamic calendar (A.H. ). A chronological table of significant events in the history of Iran since the sixteenth century is also provided at the beginning of the book. I have tried to avoid using technical terms if possible. The one important exception is the use of the term \"hierocracy\" with reference to the Shi'ite religious institution. Neither \"clergy\" nor \"church\" would have conveyed the requisite sense of a system of authority.4 I have also used the term \"teleology\" to refer to the direction and intended consequences of revolutions. Whenever possible, the evidence for the trends described and the arguments put forward has been summarized in table form. The tables, all of which contain important information, are referred to in the text to illustrate or substantiate a point but placed in the appendix in order not to impede the flow of argument and ease of reading.\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nI RISE OF THE MODERN STATE AND THE TRANSFORMATION OF SOCIETY Seek not faith in covenant from this world, weakly stayed This ancient crone has a thousand bridegrooms betrayed Hafiz of Shiraz (d. 1389-90)\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\n1 Religion, Government, and the Social Structure in the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries\n\nEstablishment of Religious Uniformity and Consolidation of the Shi'ite Clerical Power in Iran The various Shi'ite branches of Islam have their nucleus in \"the Party\" (shi'a) of 'Ali, the son-in-law of Mohammad, who became the fourth and last universally recognized \"rightly guided\" Caliph in 656 and died in 661. Of these, a group organized into a religious sect by the mid-eighth century was to survive various crises of succession and become known as the Imami Shi'a on account of their doctrine of Imamate (divinely inspired leadership). The sect was also referred to as the \"Twelvers,\" because of their belief in a line of twelve Imams as divinely inspired, infallible leaders of a community of believers and teachers in religion. The Twelfth Imam, Mohammad al-Mahdi, is believed to have gone into hiding in the year 874. He is considered to be the Lord of the Age, to reappear at the End of Time. Twelver Shi'ism bore the permanent imprint of the doctrine of the Imamate formulated under the leadership of the Sixth Imam, Ja'far al-Sadeq (d. 765). To assure the lasting sectarian organization of the Shi'a as a disciplined sect under institutionalized religious authority, he dissociated supreme religious authority from actual political rule and rested it on divine inspiration and on 'Urn (knowledge). Later generations of Shi'ite scholars, the 'ulama (the learned), derived their religio-legal authority from this basic premise without any reference to reigning political authority. Throughout the medieval period, the Twelver Shi'a reached an accommodation with non-Shi'ite rulers and were therefore considered the moderate branch of Shi'ism. Extremism (gholovv) in other Shi'ite sects was denounced, and its recurrence among the Twelvers considered anathema. In contrast to the mainstream, Sunni Muslims, however, the Twelver Shi'a refrained from granting the ruling powers any religious authority, which was invested exclusively in the 'ulama. In this way, the 'ulama were able to persist, supported by the community, and to flourish independent of government and of political vicissitudes. The establishment of Shi'ism as the state religion of Iran dates from the\n\n11\n\n12\n\nRise of the Modern State and the Transformation of Society\n\nfoundation of the Safavid Empire in 1501. The empire of the Safavids was created by the military force of a millenarian Sufi warrior order. At that time, the population of Iran was overwhelmingly Sunni, but Sufism (Islamic mysticism) was widespread, as was the devotion to the House of the Prophet that included the Imams of the Twelver Shi'a. For most strata of society, religious life was organized by the Sufi orders and controlled by the Sufi shaykhs. The members of the Safavid Sufi order were Turkman tribesmen who had adopted certain \"extremist\" Shi'ite notions such as the divinity of the first Imam, 'Ali. They considered their shaykh the reincarnation of 'Ali and of the holy Imams, the incarnation of God and the Lord of the Age, the Mahdi. The Shi'ism of these tribesmen was indeed extremist, and their millenarian zeal in the battlefield a most useful means of conquest. Once the conquest of Iran was completed, however, millenarianism lost its political utility to the new dynasty and became more of a liability than an asset. The Safavids invited a number of Arab Shi'ite theologians to their kingdom to spread the orthodox creed of the moderate Twelver Shi'ism among the predominantly Sunni population of Iran. The inflow of Shi'ite theologians and jurists from the Arab lands, notably from the Jabal 'Amil region in present-day southern Lebanon, continued for two centuries, and they soon trained a large number of Iranian 'ulama with whom they intermarried. Meanwhile, despite their origins in Sufism, or perhaps because of it, the Safavid rulers took strong measures to suppress rival Sufi Orders, which dominated the religious life of the masses in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. The Shi'ite 'ulama, for their part, incorporated many of the features and practices of popular Sufism into the official belief system during the seventeenth century. These developments eliminated the rivalry of the Sufi shaykhs as popular religious leaders and enabled the emergent Shi'ite hierocracy in Iran to control the daily religious life of the masses to an extent unknown in other Islamic lands. There remained, however, important obstacles to the consolidation of clerical power under the Safavids. These limited the possibilities open to the Shi'ite 'ulama for exploiting their domination of the masses. First, the Safavid state remained \"caesaropapist\" to its last day, with the monarch enjoying religious legitimacy as the descendant of the holy Imams and the Lieutenant of the Lord of the Age. The monarch possessed the prerogative of making clerical appointments and controlled the endowments (awqaj) that constituted the source of financial support for institutions of religious learning. Second, the Shi'ite jurists had to face the rivalry of an estate of notables who constituted the corps of Safavid clerical and local administrators—the sayyeds. This group possessed a clerical or quasi-clerical status and could boast of considerable religious charisma of lineage as the descendants of the Prophet and the Imams. The collapse of the Safavid Empire as a result of the Afghan invasion in 1722 put an end both to the religious pretensions of the rulers and the political dominance of the sayyeds. Thus obstacles to the consolidation of Shi'ite clerical power in the form of religious or quasi-religious pretension by royalty and from the notables also disappeared in the eighteenth century. The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries witnessed the rise of a distinct\n\nThe Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries\n\n13\n\ngroup of Shi'ite religious professionals as the guardians of the Sacred Law. The religious institutions under the control of this Shi'ite hierocracy were still heteronomous—still neither administratively nor financially independent of the state. The ruler appointed the chief religious official, the shaykh al-hlam, of the cities. Nevertheless, the Shi'ite hierocracy became increasingly differentiated from other branches of the state, and the last Safavid monarch appointed a special functionary, the Mollabashi, as its head. After the collapse of the Saf avid empire in 1722, the members of the Shi'ite hierocracy were forced to subsist on their own, totally independent of the state. The state, furthermore, assumed a ruthlessly hostile posture toward Shi'ism and its custodians under Nader Shah (1736-48) who was hoping to build a pan-Islamic empire after his conquests in the east and India. The rigors of forced self-subsistence resulted in an immediate and drastic decline in religious learning; but in the long run, it bore fruit in the form of a religious/intellectual movement known as the Osuli movement. It is interesting to note that the final obstacle to the growth of Shi'ite clerical power in Iran was a doctrinal one. Ever since the disappearance of the Twelfth Imam in 874, the transfer of his authority to the 'ulama had been problematic. For over a century, the prevailing attitude was staunchly traditionalist: no jurist or rather no human authority could derive any legal norms other than what was explicitly transmitted through the Traditions (akhbar} of the Imams. In the eleventh century, Akhbari traditionalism was overcome by the proponents of rational theology and jurisprudence. The science of jurisprudence and the practice of deriving legal norms developed progressively until, around the beginning of the fourteenth century, the principle of ejtehad (the competence of the jurists to derive new legal norms from the sources of the Sacred Law) was explicitly adopted. The adoption of the principle of ejtehad constituted an intellectual revolution in medieval Shi'ism. It greatly enhanced the juristic authority of the Shi'ite 'ulama, the most prominent of whom were henceforth given the designation of mojtahed (he who practices ejtehad). The orthodox Shi'ism that the Safavid rulers brought into Iran and sponsored in order to replace the extremism of the period of conquest was the Shi'ism of the mojtaheds. Nevertheless, the traditionalist orientation had not disappeared in the Shi'ite scholarly community and was vigorously revived in seventeenth century Iran. The revival of Akhbari traditionalism during the second half of the seventeenth century was connected with the resistance of the sayyeds to the growth of hierocratic power in Iran. The Akhbaris rejected the principle of ejtehad and denied the authority of the 'ulama to engage in jurisprudence and to derive new legal norms. Akhbari traditionalism, which rejected jurisprudence and advocated simply the study and collection of the Traditions of the Imams, became a major force in the second half of the seventeenth century and completely dominant during the decades following the collapse of the Safavid empire. The Osuli movement flourished outside Iranian territory in the holy cities of Ottoman Iraq and consisted of a revival of Twelver Shi'ite jurisprudence that dominated the last decades of the eighteenth and the whole of the nine-\n\n14\n\nRise of the Modern State and the Transformation of Society\n\nteenth centuries. It consisted in the vigorous reaffirmation of the principle of ejtehad and thereby resulted in very considerable enhancement of the power and the independence of the Shi'ite hierocracy. The revival of religious jurisprudence greatly augmented the prerogatives of the Shi'ite mojtaheds (doctors of jurisprudence) as the authoritative interpreters of the Sacred Law. The failure of Nader's policy to promote Sunnism and restrict certain Shi'ite practices proved that Iran's conversion to Shi'ism was irreversible. Henceforth, their unrivaled dominion over the religious life of the masses was not just the result of the absence of rival Sufi shaykhs, but had a firm doctrinal basis, which gained virtually universal acceptance in the nineteenth century. By the end of the century, the Shi'ite hierocracy controlled the religious life of over 90 percent of the population of Iran. The Osuli movement assured the independence of religious authority from the political authority of the ruler and, consequently, the autonomy and autocephaly of the Shi'ite hierocracy. Furthermore, it assured a large measure of financial autonomy for the hierocracy through the authorization of the collection of religious taxes on behalf of the Hidden Imam. As this last point is of some consequence, I should perhaps point out that a novel interpretation of a part of the religious tax of khoms, known as \"the share of the Imam\" (sahm-e imam), was introduced by the Osuli jurists, and that an instance of cooperation between the hierocracy and the state during the first Perso-Russian War (1811—13) enabled the Shi'ite mojtaheds to secure the tacit consent of the state to their right to its collection. From the nineteenth century onward, the Shi'ite hierocracy collected this voluntarily discharged religious tax as the lawful recipients of \"the share of the Imam.\" Finally, the independence of the hierocracy from the Iranian government was enhanced by the fact that the leading mojtaheds resided in the holy cities of Iraq, which were under Ottoman rule. The upper rank of the Shi'ite hierocracy consisted of the mojtaheds, who enjoyed tremendous power and prestige during the nineteenth century. By virtue of their judicial and religious authority, they heard the complaints of the people against injustice and tyrannical misrule and, on occasion, took up their cause. However, even though it is useful to conceive of the Shi'ite 'ulama as a hierocracy, the extent of their organization into a system of authority should not be exaggerated. There was no formal hierarchy of authority among the mojtaheds, and the congeries of clerics at the lower ranks could be differentiated only by the patronage of different mojtaheds and by a nonformalized scale of prestige and learning. Because of their amorphous internal organization, therefore, the Shi'ite 'ulama could not act as a unified body except on rare occasions, such as the wars against Russia in 1811 to 1813 and 1826 to 1827. This inability was made painfully clear in the face of the millenarian heresy of the Bab who put forth the \"extremist\" claim of being the Lord of the Age in the 1840s. The hierocracy was unable to suppress the heretics or prevent the younger tollab (seminarians) from joining them. It was the state that stemmed the tide of Babism, suppressing a series of millenarian insurrections and an attempt to assassinate the king (1848-52).\n\nThe Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries\n\n15\n\nDuring the long reign of Path 'Ali Shah (1797-1834), both the Qajar dynasty and the Shi'ite hierocracy consolidated their respective political and religious authority. Safavid caesaropapist monism had given way to a hierocracystate dualism. A rough division of the political and the religious functions of government was worked out, and the Shi'ite hierocracy assumed independent control of the latter. These comprised the religious, the judicial, and the educational institutions. At the same time a number of tracts on political ethics and political theory written by the Shi'ite jurists legitimized this division. These tracts stressed the interdependence of religion and kingship, and the importance of concord and collaboration between the state and the hierocracy.1 Close ties between the hierocracy and urban petty bourgeois strata, that is, merchants and craftsmen, are probably more the rule than the exception in preindustrial societies. As Weber explains, these ties could give rise to enduring alliances against the patrimonial and feudal powers. On the basis of \"opposition to political charisma,\" the elective affinity between bourgeois and religious powers, which is typical of a certain stage in their development, may grow into a formal alliance against the feudal powers; this happened rather frequently in the Orient and also in Italy at the time of the struggle over lay investiture [the Investiture Contest of the eleventh century].2\n\nThe formation of such an alliance was hindered by the heteronomy of the religious institution and its subordination to the state during the Safavid period. Under the Qajars, from the last decades of the eighteenth century onward, the autonomy of the Shi'ite hierocracy made an alliance with civil society—with urban guildsmen, merchants, and shopkeepers—possible and likely. In the last quarter of the nineteenth century, an enduring alliance against the state between mosque and bazaar came into being. Against the background of noticeable growth of the economic power of civil society, this alliance was cemented by the common opposition of the two parties to foreign penetration that resulted from the political privileges and economic concessions granted to imperialist powers by a servile state. It was an alliance in defense of the respective cultural and economic interest of the hierocracy and the bourgeois strata. Popular bourgeois support in this period greatly enhanced the power and prestige of the great mojtaheds who began to assume the lofty title of ayatollah (sign of God). 3 A very important factor in determining the capacity of a hierocracy to act against the state or upon society is the character and extent of autonomy of its organization. As we have pointed out, the autonomy of the Shi'ite hierocracy became established in principle in the early years of the nineteenth century, although the appointment of the imam jom'eh (prayer leaders of the cathedral mosques) and shaykh al-Islams of the major cities remained with the ruler. By contrast, the Shi'ite hierocracy was still very loosely organized in 1900 and lacked the elaborately hierarchical structure characteristic of the Catholic Church. The principle of juristic authority in Shi'ism, that is, ejtehad,\n\n16\n\nRise of the Modern State and the Transformation of Society\n\nonly made possible the division of the clerical professionals into the mojtahed (jurist) and the non-mojtahed. The divisions within these two categories were still informal and not legally or doctrinally based. Ranking among the mojtaheds had come to depend on the number of their followers (moqalleds); those with the larger followings were referred to singly as the marja'-e taqlid (source of imitation) and occupied the positions of leadership in the Shi'ite hierocracy. There was another informal but all-important division within the Shi'ite hierocracy around 1900. The prominent 'ulama could be divided into two groups: \"those who have no relations with the functionaries of the state, do not administer the Sacred Law and avoid luxuries,\" and \"those whose quest for worldly dominion (riyasat-ma'abi) outweigh their religious aspect,\" who intermingled with the functionaries of the state, held religious courts, and usually amassed large fortunes. This latter group issued verdicts in legal disputes and acted as intermediaries between government and people. For this group, judiciary function constituted a source of income whose enlargement resulted in the issuance of a plethora of contradictory verdicts. Ranking well below these categories in prestige and authority were the preachers (ahl-e menbar; vo\"az) who had close ties with the nobility because of their role in the latter's religious ceremonies (rawzeh-khani and ta'zieh). To these observations we should add that the imam jom'ehs and shaykh al-lslams were the appointees of the state, thus belonging to the group of 'ulama seeking worldly dominion, and that some members of this latter group possessed extensive landholdings and controlled endowed (vaqf) properties. When the holy cities of Arab Iraq eclipsed Isfahan and Tehran as centers of religious learning in the second half of the nineteenth century, the dichotomy between the \"worldly\" 'ulama and those who piously withdrew from political engagements, found a corresponding geographical dimension.4\n\nCollapse of the Saf avid State and Tribal Domination of Urban Society in the Eighteenth Century The eighteenth century is among the most turbulent in Iran's long history. It witnessed the collapse of the centralized Saf avid empire in 1722, followed by seven decades of internecine tribal warfare, and finally, the establishment of Qajar monarchy in the 1790s. Tribalism subsided in the nineteenth century, but generally speaking, the central government remained weak and the kingdom minimally integrated. Iran entered the twentieth century with the Qajar governmental system on the verge of complete breakdown and bankruptcy. Like most dynasties in the history of Iran, the Safavid House established an empire at the beginning of the sixteenth century through a tribal confederation. The power of the Qizilbash tribes, which constituted the military backbone of Safavid state in the sixteenth century, was drastically reduced by 'Abbas the Great (1587—1629), the number of Qizilbash troops being cut from 60,000 to 30,000. Nevertheless, the Qizilbash tribes remained successfully integrated into the centralized Safavid state through the subsequent cen-\n\nThe Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries\n\n17\n\ntury. The Qizilbash troops constituted one of the four branches of the Safavid army, the Qurchis, and their leaders held governorships. Indeed, one can argue that in 1722 they constituted the most important branch of the army. They received over one-third of the army budget and their head, His Excellency the Qurchi-bashi, the Pillar of Royalty (rokn al-saltaneh), was ranked the most important amir (commander) and given precedence over the three amirs who headed the other branches of the Safavid army.5 The most important component of 'Abbas the Great's centralization policy was the creation of new troops: a corps of musketeers (tojangchi) numbering 12,000 and a corps of royal slaves (qollar or gholaman). The revenue from the royal domains (khasseh) was used to pay the new troops. Furthermore, 'Abbas inaugurated the policy of converting the state provinces (mamalek) into royal (khasseh) provinces, governed by intendants appointed directly by the king, in the latter part of the 1590s. From 1600 onward, Allahverdi Khan, the qollar-aqasi (commander of the qollar) and the first royal slave to attain equality of status with the Qizilbash commanders, began the reorganization of the army in conjunction with Sir Robert Sherley. The slave corps under his command was increased from 4,000 to 25,000 men.6 Shah Safi (1629-42) and 'Abbas II (1642-66) continued 'Abbas the Great's policies of centralization. Safi's grand vazir, Saru-Taqi, reformed and rationalized the administration of royal domains, extending it to cover the government of the inner provinces not threatened by war. 'Abbas II absolished more governorships and placed them under the khasseh administration.7 Although the size of the slave corps might have become smaller under 'Abbas II (down to 10,000 according to Chardin), their importance as the tool for centralization of power was undiminished. Both 'Abbas I and 'Abbas II relied on the royal slaves for provincial administration, as the Mamluks had been relied upon by the Muslim rulers in the medieval period. By the time of 'Abbas I's death, eight of the fourteen major provinces were administered by the royal slaves. During 'Abbas II's reign some twenty-three to twenty-five of the thirty-seven governorships were held by royal slaves.8 To gain some perspective on the extent and nature of the centralization of the Safavid state, comparisons with Western European states during the age of absolutism are helpful. The first point to note is that the crucial importance of the royal domains as a source of revenue for the central government and for the maintenance of the nontribal regular army makes the Safavid state more similar to the Prussian than to the French variant of European absolutist state. Khasseh revenue under 'Abbas II was estimated by Chardin at some 44 percent of the total government revenue, and the amount collected by the khasseh department in 1722 is just under one fourth (the real revenue from the royal domains may well have been higher, some of it being reported in other categories). The Ottoman Register of 1727/1140 for Tabriz, conquered after the fall of the Safavids and almost certainly reflecting the status quo ante, shows a larger figure for royal domains (khass-e shahi) than for all other land assignments (9.5 as against 8.4 million aspers).9 This is similar to the fiscal pattern in Prussia where, by 1740, the revenue from the royal do-\n\n18\n\nRise of the Modern State and the Transformation of Society\n\nmains was almost equal to public taxes.10 Beyond this, however, differences between Iran and Western Europe are much greater than similarities. The first important difference is that the tribal component of the Safavid army, the Qurchis, which remained numerically preponderant, finds no counterpart in the armies of the absolutist states of Europe. The concentration of financial resources and the fiscal power of the Safavid state was also considerably lower than its European counterparts. Given the comparable levels of economic prosperity as attested to by such perceptive travelers as the Protestant French knight, Chardin, and the Ottoman bureaucrat, Katib Chelebi,11 the weaker fiscal basis of the central state in Iran is demonstrated by Table 1 (see Appendix). From the figures given in Table 1 we may conclude that both in absolute terms and relative to the size of population, the concentration of fiscal resources under the state is much greater in France and even Spain and England than in eighteenth century Iran at the height of centralization under the Safavids.12 The comparatively modest size of the central bureaucracy of the Safavid state in Isfahan corresponds to this difference. We know that in France, \"when the Court and the Government installed themselves at Versailles, the bureaux occupied exclusively the two long wings on either side of the forecourt.\"13 The Safavid Shah's bureaucracy was considerably smaller: it consisted of some forty-eight functionaries and well over one hundred scribes (see Appendix, Table 2). The remuneration of the functionaries of the central government consisted of fixed salaries supplemented by specified levies on land grants and, occasionally, on religious endowments.14 Multiple office holding was common, and there was a tendency for the commanders and other high functionaries of central government to hold specific governorships, with offices connected in a stereotyped manner.15 In sharp contrast to the growth of absolutist states in Europe, the history of Iran in the eighteenth century is marked by the resurgence of the tribalism to which the Safavid state succumbed. According to Lambton, the decades preceding the collapse of the Safavid empire witnessed a tribal reassertion not only among the Afghan tribes, which were eventually to overthrow the empire in 1722, but also among other tribes, the Baluchis, the Kurds, the Lors, and the Bakhtiyaris.16 The tribal resurgence became overwhelming after the collapse of Safavid central authority. Nader-qoli, who began his career as a general in the service of the Safavid crown prince by raising troops to recapture the capital, expelled the Afghans in 1729 and ruled Iran as Nader Shah after 1736. Though from a tribal background, he was not a tribal chief and could not create a typical tribal confederation. Nevertheless the forces he amassed to reconquer Iran and to conquer India were overwhelmingly tribal. His militarist government collapsed with his assassination in 1747, and Iran became the arena of a devastating struggle among the tribal warlords. Karim Khan Zand was successful in creating a tribal confederation and in unifying and pacifying the country, ruling it from Shiraz by the mid-1760s. Tribal anarchy returned after his death. The devastation of Iranian cities and country-\n\nThe Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries\n\n19\n\nside by the tribal warlords continued until Aqa Mohammad Khan, chief of the Qajar tribe, created a tribal confederacy along the traditional lines and succeeded in establishing the Qajar monarchy in the 1790s. His coronation took place in 1796. Eighteenth century chronicles have preserved harrowing accounts of the devastation of the major cities, especially Isfahan, Qazvin, Shiraz, and Yazd, as a result of repeated sieges, sacks, and depredations.17 During the seven decades between Safavid and Qajar rule, the main cities lost at least twothirds of their inhabitants.18 The last major catastrophe befell the city of Kerman. It was sacked by Aqa Mohammed Khan Qajar in October 1794. Hearing of the flight of the last Zand ruler who had held the city, \"he grew so angry that he ordered the slaughter of the inhabitants of Kerman. About, 8,000 women and children were distributed as slaves among the army; all the men were either killed or deprived of their sight.\"19 Nader's military campaigns and the internecine struggle of the tribal warlords resulted in the imposition of a crushing tax burden on the countryside. During his last years, Nader confiscated religious endowments (awqaf) throughout the country20 and raised the taxes fantastically, executing the tax collectors who pointed out that the new figures were unrealizable. We have a graphic eyewitness account of the encounter between Nader Shah and the tax collectors of the province of Pars. Having ordered his designated tax commissioner for Pars to choose the ten least corrupt tax agents, Nader had the remaining seventy-three decapitated together with some other wrongdoers. (The executioners were ordered to build two towers with the severed heads and, as some of the tax collectors had fled overnight, killed other persons \"so that the tower of [severed] heads should not be defective\".)21 Nader Shah then sent off the surviving collectors to Pars, giving the tax commissioner the following instruction: \"You are permitted to decapitate up to fifty persons from the army if their accounts are irregular. As for beating and [cutting off] nose and ears in cases of irregularity, there is no limit [to your authority].\"22 The crushing tax increases caused a series of rebellions (1744-47). Mutilated and blinded victims of Nader's fiscal severity were still to be seen in 1765 and later.23 Mirza Mohammad Kalantar also documents the tax exactions of the Bakhtiyari and Zand warlords of the interregnum24 and points to instances of the abandonment of agrarian land as a result of excessive taxation.25 The years of anarchy intervening between the death of Karim Khan and the supremacy of Aqa Mohammad Khan (subsequently Shah) also demonstrated the military weakness of the cities and their inability to defend themselves against tribal forces. In these years sundry armed cohorts in the cities did come into existence and mayors or urban notables did assume control of the cities for brief periods.26 In February 1785, with most tribal elements already expelled from Isfahan by the Zand ruler who had died near the city, the mayor Baqer Khan summoned four to five thousand musketeers from the surrounding area and some Lezgi troops resident in Isfahan. Styling himself Shah Baqer, he \"ascended the throne with royal splendor.\"27 His rule lasted four-and-a-half days, when he was attacked and wounded by Zand soldiers and\n\n20\n\nRise of the Modern State and the Transformation of Society\n\nhad to flee the city. Reinstated as governor by Aqa Mohammad Khan Qajar, he was put to death four months later by the returning Zand.28 In one remarkable instance in 1791, the citizens of Shiraz under the mayor Haji Ebrahim ingeniously divided the tribal army loyal to the Zands into small groups after a pay parade, disarmed them, and even took away their clothes. \"By this means the whole tribal army, naked and disarmed, was removed from the city. Nobody knew what happened to the others [i.e., those who had not appeared at the parade]. Then their families were expelled from the city.\"29 Haji Ebrahim and the citizens of Shiraz successfully defended the city against Lotf 'Ali Khan Zand and opened its gates to the Qajar monarch. Nevertheless, the military weakness of the cities and their penetration by tribal military contingents is evident. Even though he was proved wrong in that particular instance, it was not without reason that the last Zand ruler Lotf 'Ali Khan contemptuously dismissed the rebellious mayor of Shiraz, Haji Ebrahim, with the following remark: \"This traitor is only a citizen and his followers are merchants and dealers. They cannot compete with the victorious army, which is trained in handling musket and sword only.\"30 If the eighteenth century began with the resurgence of tribalism, it ended with the reassertion of central monarchical authority. After the unification of Iran, Aqa Mohammad Khan, who claimed Safavid descent through his grandmother, set out to revive the Safavid empire. In January 1794, he conferred the governorship of the provinces of Pars, Kerman, and Yazd upon his chosen successor, Crown Prince Baba Khan, and made Haji Ebrahim, the mayor of Shiraz, his grand vazir. \"After the pattern of the Safavids, the Shah conferred upon Haji Ebrahim the honorific title E'temad al-Dawleh\" (Trust of the State).31 However, if the Safavid central bureaucracy was of modest size by French standards, Aqa Mohammad Khan's was excessively small by Safavid standards. No chart or table is necessary to represent it; it can be depicted more elegantly and just as rigorously in prose. The grand vazir apart, Aqa Mohammad Khan had two financial officers, a mostawfi in charge of taxation and a lashkar-nevis in charge of army accounts. Both traveled constantly with him. He himself administered justice and supervised accounts. He \"had no official private secretary, no minister of justice, no minister of court. He ran a highly personal administration and, finances aside, paper work was almost non-existent\"32\n\nThe Qajar Government and the Social Structure of Iran in the Nineteenth Century In 1797, the year after his coronation, Aqa Mohammad Khan was assassinated. His nephew Baba Khan succeeded him as Path 'Ali Shah after eliminating the competing pretenders. The long reigns of Path 'Ali Shah (1797-1834) and later of Naser al-Din Shah (1848-96) freed Iran from frequent bloodshed over succession to the throne and offered the population of Iran a cen-\n\nThe Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries\n\n21\n\ntury of general internal peace and relative economic prosperity. The population of Iran increased from some six million in 1800 to under ten million in 1900. As is indicated in Table 3 (see Appendix), the depopulation of cities was arrested and there was a slight increase in the rate of urbanization. The tribal and nomadic population probably declined, though it still remained substantial. The assertion of central authority during the first decade of Path 'Ali Shah's reign was very impressive. The tribes were subdued and some transplanted. Many tribal chiefs were executed, others or their close relatives were forced to reside at the royal court as hostages.33 Path 'Ali set up a sumptuous court in the new capital, Tehran. The administrative staff of the Zand dynasty were co-opted eagerly and the bureaucracy was expanded considerably. The two financial officials in charge of taxation and army accounts each became the head of a department and their ranks were upgraded to mostawfi al-mamalek (finance minister) and vazir of the army respectively. Other ministerial posts were created for a controller-general (saheb divan) and the head of the state secretariat (monshi al-mamalek). The royal treasury was divided into the public treasury and the privy purse, though in practice the two were not kept strictly separate. Haji Ebrahim of Shiraz was confirmed as prime minister (sadr-e a'zam) and presided over the central bureaucracy. The Garden of Lalehzar near the Shah's palace became the residence of prime ministers, though the ministers did not acquire fixed offices and conducted government business from their homes or other places.34 In the first decade of the nineteenth century, state revenues reached the Safavid level.35 It is variously estimated at 2 million tumans (£2,000,000 [1807]) for 1807 and 3 million for 1808-1809, as compared to roughly the same revenue for the Ottoman Empire, with a population twice as large as that of Iran, and to a revenue of 7 million tumans in the previous decade from the territories of the East India Company, with a population five times as large.36 However, the Qajar state's newly acquired vigor and fiscal strength were wasted in two major wars against Russia (1811—13 and 1826-27), in which Iran was defeated, suffering significant loss of territory and population. From the second quarter of the nineteenth century onward, the picture is one of irreversible decline in the fiscal, and military, resources of central government. As is shown in Table 4 (see Appendix), during the nineteenth century, state revenue in cash (about 85 percent of total revenue) and kind (about 15 percent) 37 declined in real terms while the population and economy of Iran grew considerably. The figures in Table 4, though they reveal the general trend, do not adequately reflect the true fiscal weakness of Qajar government; nor do they convey the fiscal chaos and financial insolvency of central government. Even in the best of years, central government probably controlled less than half of this revenue.38 Taxes were frequently in arrears and were often either never remitted or partly or wholly remitted under the threat or actuality of military expeditions.30 The finance minister was forced to issue\n\n22\n\nRise of the Modern State and the Transformation\n\nof Society\n\ndrafts against provincial revenue. These drafts (barats) were rarely honored upon presentation and often realized no more than half of their nominal value. In bad times, they are reported to have been traded for as little as one-tenth of their nominal value.40 The fact that state revenue from taxes was low did not mean that the burden of taxation on the subjects was light. On the contrary, the inefficiency of the central government in collecting taxes greatly increased the tax burden.41 Governors were expected to collect above the tax assessment, the difference being officially termed the tajavot-e 'amal (difference of the operation), and invariably did so. Sale of office was a marked feature of Qajar government,42 and governors had to recuperate the considerable sums they had paid for their offices and make a large profit to maintain their clients. With the exception of the most important men of the realm who enjoyed longer tenure, governors or deputy governors were rotated fairly frequently— on average, perhaps once every two or three years.43 Some of the governors amassed huge fortunes. For instance, the Georgian eunuch Manuchehr Khan Mo'tamed al-Dawleh, who held the governorships of Isfahan, Khuzestan, and Pars, died in 1847, leaving an estate of 3.5 million tumans or nearly one-and-a-half times the theoretical revenue of the state.44 Furthermore, tax farming was the regular practice: collection of taxes in different areas was farmed out to the highest bidders, and tax farms were negotiable and transferrable. Taxes could be arbitrarily increased by tax farmers.45 The Iranian economy in the nineteenth century was, needless to say, overwhelmingly agrarian. As in all agrarian societies, land itself—which could be assigned temporarily or permanently—constituted the major fiscal resource of the state other than taxes in cash and kind. In addition to using the state revenue, Path 'AH Shah granted tuyul (a land assignment or a grant to collect the taxes of a given area, or a specific tax) in lieu of salary, as benefice for service to the king or in exchange for the obligation to provide military contingents. According to Lambton, the dominant type of tuyul was a grant of land belonging to the royal domains. Furthermore, there was a strong tendency for land or taxation rights alienated by the state as tuyul to become hereditarily transmitted, even alienable by sale, and converted into private property. This tendency, which prevailed unchallenged in the second half of the century, was manifest in the vehement opposition to the forcible assertion of the theoretical right of the state to repossess tuyul by Haji Mirza Aqasi—referred to by one contemporary writer as \"the destroyer of the notable\"-in the late 1830s and 1840s.4e Mention has been made in passing of Nader Shah's order for confiscation of all religious endowments. Under the Safavids, these endowments were very extensive, and much of the distribution of benefices to the local notables and Shi'ite clerics, as well as the financing of the institutions of learning, drew on this important resource, which as far as I can tell, is not included in the figures from the Tazkirat al~Muluk that I have used for government revenue. The extent of Nader's actual confiscation of the endowments is not clear. However, as it occurred in the last year of his reign, it resulted in much usur-\n\nThe Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries\n\n23\n\npation of religious endowments by their administrators during the ensuing period of anarchy, at least in the Isfahan area.47 This can only have meant an increased claim by benefices and pensions on state revenue from taxation. As endowed land under state control decreased considerably, the royal domains (now referred to as khaleseh instead of khasseh) assumed increasing importance among the resources of central government. Thanks to large-scale confiscations by Nader and Aqa Mohammad, Path 'AH Shah began his reign with extensive royal domains, comparable as a source of revenue to the khasseh under the Safavids.48 Furthermore, the cornerstone of the centralizing policy of Haji Mirza Aqasi, the prime minister of Mohammad Shah (who reigned 1834-48), consisted in the extension and improved cultivation of the royal domains.49 In crucial contrast to the Safavids, the Qajars failed to centralize and regularize the administration of the royal domains. Under Naser al-Din Shah in the second half of the nineteenth century, the royal domains were \"for the most part in a state of decay and made little contribution to the revenue.\"50 During the last ten years of his reign, Naser al-Din resorted to sale of khaleseh land on an appreciable scale, a practice that was transformed by his successor into a means of dispensing favors during the closing years of the nineteenth century.51 At the beginning of the twentieth century, less than 5 percent of government revenue came from the royal domains;52 the percentage could not have been much higher in 1876.53 In addition to its greater fiscal weakness, the Qajar polity differed from the Safavid in regard to military organization. Throughout the nineteenth century, Qajar government intermittently but constantly pursued two goals: to break the military power of the tribes and to create a standing army; they succeeded in the first but failed in the second. Path 'All Shah's success in subduing the tribes has already been mentioned. Under his successors Mohammad and Naser al-Din, \"the power of the tribes was further reduced and the authority of the central government asserted.\"54 The tribes remained under the obligation to supply the state, on demand, with irregular cavalry whose number was theoretically about 20,000 in the middle of the nineteenth century.55 However, we find no systematic integration of tribes into the Qajar political and military organization comparable to the Safavid pattern. On the other hand, several attempts were made to create a standing army. These foundered because of the fiscal weakness of Qajar government. Rawlinson, who was himself instrumental in pursuing both the goals of the Qajar state, commented on the consequences of the success of the first and the reasons for the failure of the second: To a nation devoid of organization in every other department of government a regular army was impossible. . . . [In the attempt to create a standing army] the resources of the country were lavished on the army to an extent which grievously impoverished it; above all, the tribes, the chivalry of the Empire, the forces with which [Nader] overran the East, and which, ever yielding but ever present, surrounded, under [Aqa] Mohammad Khan, the Russian armies with a desert, were destroyed.58\n\n24\n\nRise of the Modern State and the Transformation of Society\n\nAs was the case with taxation, the century opens with a rosy picture but darkening gloom sets in after Iran's defeat by Russia in 1813. Although the supply of slaves was somewhat replenished by Aqa Mohammad Khan's invasion of Georgia, the Safavid slave corps of qollar could not be reconstituted. Furthermore, the use of royal slaves as governors was rare and had practically disappeared in the second half of the nineteenth century. However, in the first decade of the nineteenth century, the slave soldiers, gholaman, figure prominently in the Shah's guard, which according to Malcolm, was composed of 3,000 to 4,000 men from \"Georgian slaves, and sons of the first nobles of Persia.\"ST In mid-century, the royal bodyguard consisted of 2,500 \"excellent horsemen\" and in 1890 of 2,000 men.58 In the first decade of the nineteenth century, the crown prince, 'Abbas Mirza, created a standing army of 12,000. Though it continued to exist on paper after the Perso-Russian wars, it disintegrated and attempts to revitalize it in the 1830s and 1840s had no lasting effect.59 It was not until 1879 that the so-called Cossack regiments were set up under Russian officers. These were the only effective military force at the disposal of central government other than the king's bodyguard. By 1890, there were two Cossack regiments of 560 privates, 13 noncommissioned and 25 commissioned officers each. These constituted what came to be known as the Cossack Brigade, changed to the Cossack Division in 1916.°° It is true that the Shah's son Zill al-Soltan, the governor of the provinces of western and southern Iran, had an efficient private standing army that numbered 15,800 men in 1886.81 However, this very fact made Naser al-Din Shah so apprehensive about the potential for rebellion that he ordered most units of Zill al-Soltan's army to be disbanded and deprived him of all his governorships except that of Isfahan in February 1888. Having surveyed the fiscal and military bases on which it rested, we can now turn to the nature and goals of government in Qajar Iran. The government was unmistakably patrimonial in Weber's classic typology. The kingdom was an extension of the household of the ruler and subject to his personal authority. The ruler's authority was delegated to officials who represented the royal person in administration. There was a natural tendency to delegate administrative authority to the members of the royal family and to personal servants (nokar) and stewards of the royal household.02 Qajar princes were appointed to provincial governorships, and if they were minors, a tutor was put in charge of their instruction and government transactions. A vazir was also appointed to assist the prince and look after the interests of the central government. Each prince set up a provincial court, which was a replica of the Shah's court in Tehran. This practice points to a striking feature of Qajar patrimonialism, or more precisely, of the political economy of royal polygamy. Aqa Mohammad was a eunuch but his successor, Path 'Ali, made up for his infertility. The humorous historian, Rostam al-Hokama, having enumerated Path 'Ali Shah's one hundred and two sons and given each a real or fictitious title, proceeds to remark: \"Let it not be hidden to scholars that many of these princes each have ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, sixty, seventy and eighty children and offsprings in the name of God. Furthermore there\n\nThe Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries\n\n25\n\nare as many female children [to the king] as male, may God preserve them from affliction.\"03 The English traveler Fraser, commenting on the expensive mode of providing for the royal progeny, points out that \"every chief town and district, nay, every petty ballook and considerable village, comes to be assigned to one or other of these royal scions. . . . Nor is this all—each of these princes, taking an example from his father or grandfather, must have a huge harem filled with women of all sorts—a perfect hotbed of profligacy. . . .\" Fraser proceeds to deplore the financially exhaustive and morally corrupting consequences of \"the sensuality and vice of a race of royal drones, the most profligate and depraved, and the most noxious to their country, that perhaps any land and age have ever produced.\"64 Under Qajar patrimonialism, the kingdom was quite literally an extension of the royal household and the harem. This is clearly demonstrated in the revealing diary kept by the courtier E'temad al-Saltaneh in the 1880s and 1890s. Amineh Aqdas, the Shah's favorite wife in his later years, frequently intervened in administration of the state on behalf of influential individuals.85 To reclaim the regiment assigned to a cousin of his, the general Shehab al-Dawleh took sanctuary (bast) [sic!] at the doorstep of the same Amineh Aqdas, incidentally, a Kurdish peasant who had entered the harem as a servant. He got his regiment back.68 Other individuals approached the harem favorites, male and female, or the influential midget eunuch, Agha Mohammad, to gain favors from the Shah.87 In 1887, Naser al-Din Shah's favorite, Malijak II, a boy of eight, received the commissions of brigadier and then general. In the subsequent year, he was given charge of a cavalry regiment of 500 while his younger brother was given the rank of brigadier.68 A figure like the blind Shaykh Asadollah, who was the Koran cantor (qari) and instructor of the ladies of the harem (also a multiple secret agent who reported to the Shah on the public opinion, to prime minister Amin al-Soltan about the Shah and the harem, and vice versa) must be counted among the most influential men of the realm.89 Delegation of authority on the basis of personal and family ties did not stop at the royal level and pervaded all central and provincial administration. The prime minister also appointed sons, relatives, kinsmen, and stewards to the most important offices. The personal nature of authority entailed the prevalence of widespread nepotism and created a strong hereditary tendency. Some of the more notorious instances of inheritance of office are to be found in the latter part of the century when minors occupied such important offices as that of the minister of finance and imam jom'eh of Tehran, and Naser alDin's last prime minister, Amin al-Soltan, inherited forty offices from his father, the head of the royal kitchen.70 Furthermore, each important official maintained a host of retainers.71 The personal nature of authority and utter insecurity of tenure also fostered the development of patron-client networks. There was a tendency for the weak to attach themselves to the strong, and the strong needed to secure enormous revenues to attract clients by their openhandedness and hospitality.72 The personal nature of authority and the ubiquity of clientism explains the curious fact that the high officials were at\n\n26\n\nRise of the Modern State and the Transformation of Society\n\nonce very wealthy and at the same time heavily in debt in order to maintain their influence by lavish entertaining, gifts, and large entourages.73 Clientism, intrigue, and insecurity of office also go a long way toward explaining the inability of Qajar government to pursue consistent policy and the tremendous influence of the British and Russian missions among the notables, many of whom sought to put themselves under the protection of Britain and Russia.74 As in other patrimonial governments, office was not distinct from property. Offices were often sold and farmed, and office holders treated them as property. Furthermore, the property of the official, as a rule accumulated as a result of tenure of office, was not immune from confiscation and mulcting upon dismissal.75 In theory, the purpose of the Qajar king, as the Shadow of God on Earth, was to rule with justice, provide internal security, defend the country against external enemies, and promote the prosperity of the subjects. In practice, the twin goals of Qajar government can be said to have been the maintenance of the royal household and taxation and its distribution to notables, government officials, Shi'ite clerics, and others as benefices for past and present services to the ruling House. This assertion can be sustained by the figure for government expenditure given in Table 5 (see Appendix). It should also be pointed out that distribution of benefices was fully sanctioned by the ethos of patrimonialism. By bestowing such benefices, the ruler became the benefactor (vali-ne'mat, literally \"the lord of benefit\") and the recipient became bound to him for having \"tasted his salt,\" obligated to be loyal to the ruler's house and to pray for its prosperity and everlasting rule (du'a-gu'i) ,76 Not only did the Qajar state enable the official class and their retinue to enrich themselves from tax collection, tax farming, subdelegation of offices, and grants of land as tuyul, it also distributed about one-quarter of its annual revenue in the royal household and among the notables as pensions and allowances. As can be seen in Table 5 (see Appendix), pensions (vazifeh), or annuities (mostamarri), as distinct from salary (mavajeb), constituted an important component of government expenditures, accounting for some 15 percent. These carried with them no office service as obligation, were usually granted in perpetuity, and were subject to a scramble among the heirs, relatives, and competitors upon the decease of the recipient.77 Furthermore, the enormous expenditure on the army included a large amount of revenue for officials and the notables. This very substantial distributive component of the military budget consisted of the difference between the cost of maintaining the nominal strength of the army in the government accounts and that of the actual number of men serving and paid. During the last years of Naser al-Din's reign, his son Kamran Mirza, the Regent, who was also the governor of Tehran and minister of war, received money to maintain a nominal army of over ninety thousand when the actual number under arms was between fifteen and thirty thousand.78 In sharp contrast to the distribution of government revenue to the royal household and the class of officials and notables stands the miniscule expenditure on national education. Colleges (madrasas) were financed from\n\nThe Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries\n\n27\n\nthe existing religious endowments or new endowments by princes, officials, and notables as individuals. The state spent virtually nothing on public works, hospitals, and social services.79 What there was in the way of these services was supported by charitable endowments by the individual princes and notables, by the Shah, and by other individuals such as wealthy merchants.\n\nEmergence of the Modern Idea of the State and Failure of Centralizing Reforms Against this background let us examine the incipient attempts at the reform and modernization of the state. Some comparisons with Western Europe are helpful at the start. In his concise and magisterial essay on state formation, Barker points out that, in the seventeenth century, the European state was still not distinct from \"family, property and society.\"80 From about 1660 onward for some two centuries, there followed the \"disengaging of the idea of the state as a service-rendering organization.\" The institution of absolutism and the proclamation of national sovereignty were the two hallmarks of this gradual process of disengagement. Fiscal factors were of considerable importance in the institution of absolutism. The intendants, the instruments of absolutism in seventeenth century France, began as temporary tax commissioners but gradually became permanent administrators controlling a whole range of economic, but also judiciary, matters. An analogous development took place with the Prussian Councillors of Taxes (Steuerrathe*), who were transformed into administrators of towns.81 No parallel development can be found in Iran. There, the functions of the tax commissioners (mohassels) remained restricted to ad hoc exaction of taxes in the eighteenth century. They became noticeably less conspicuous in the nineteenth century. Crucial to the process of disengagement of the state from dynastic, proprietary, and social interlinkages was the development of the idea of the state. The Hobenzollern rulers of Prussia, who assumed the title of King in 1701, built their absolutism around the idea of impersonal devotion to duty of state. In Prussian theory, the King was the \"carrier of State power,\" and \"the first servant of the state.\" The contribution of the French Revolution to the process was the establishment of the doctrine of national sovereignty as the foundation of the state. With Napoleon's repeated endorsement by national plebiscites, the ruler of the modern nation-state also became \"the first representative of the nation.\"82 These ideas, central to the disengagement of the idea of the state from dynastic rule and patrimonial government, began their impact on Iran's political ethos early in the nineteenth century. The sociopolitical consequences of the incorporation of Iran into the world economy was negligible before the very end of the nineteenth century. By contrast, the consequences of the incorporation of Iran into the modern international system of sovereign states were considerable. The most important of these was the reception of the modern idea of the state. This is not to say that internal developments were irrelevant. The collapse of the Safavid\n\n28\n\nRise of the Modern State and the Transformation of Society\n\ndynasty after two and a half centuries created a serious and unresolved crisis of legitimacy that continued until the very end of the eighteenth century. This prolonged crisis of legitimacy fostered the growth of the abstract idea of \"the Iranian State\" (dawlat-e Iran) and helped disengage it from the concept of dynastic rule as a God-ordained \"turn\" (dawlat) in power.83 Nader, having served as a lieutenant of the Safavid princes (and nominal kings), Tahmasp II and 'Abbas III, had himself \"elected\" king in 1736 by a nationwide gathering modeled after the Mongolian tribal pattern. He also sought to revive the legitimacy of the rule of the Turkman tribe. Despite these efforts, his dynasty lacked legitimacy and his one descendant who did rule in Khorasan until the last decade of the century was forced to lay heavy emphasis on his maternal descent from the Safavids. Even the Qajars at first claimed to be of Safavid descent and gave up this pretention only when Path 'AH Shah was fully assured of an alternative legitimation by a close alliance with the Shi'ite hierocracy.84 Meanwhile, the rulers of Iran (most notably Karim Khan Zand, who never assumed the title of Shah) occasionally sought to legitimatize their rule as \"servants of the state (dawlat) of Iran.\" This abstract idea of the state developed hand in hand with the growing notions of Iranian nationality. Nader's formula for disengaging his rule from Godordained Safavid dynastic sovereignty is highly significant. The inscription on his seal is as follows: \"The Seal of State and Religion having been displaced fan allusion to the collapse of the Safavid dynasty], God has given order to Iran in the Name of Nader.\"85 The formula, though somewhat confused, indicates a shift of emphasis from religiously legitimized dynastic rule of the Safavids as the propagators and protectors of Shi'ism to the destiny88 of Iran. In the Zand period the shift of emphasis became much stronger and the implicit notion of Iran's destiny became linked to that of serving \"the Iranian State.\" Quite possibly with a touch of anachronism, 'Ali-Mardan Khan, one of the triumvirate of Bakhtiyari-Zand coalition of 1750, which ruled in the name of a Safavid minor, is reported to have said, \"We do not claim sovereignty. We are the servants of the Iranian State (khidmatgozar-e dawlat-e iran).\"&1 Karim Khan Zand, who assumed the titles of Representative of the State (vakil al-dawleh) and Representative of the Subjects (vakil al-ra'aya) in preference to king, was more emphatic in his references to the Iranian State he claimed to represent, and in one instance is reported to have specified \"service to the Iranian State\" as the sole criterion for the receipt of salaries and pensions from the government.88 These internal developments were undoubtedly important. Nevertheless, it should be noted that most of the instances of references to the Iranian State and to the ruler as its representative are in the diplomatic context, in remarks to the British emissary or those transmitted to the Ottoman Sultan. In the nineteenth century, diplomatic representation of the powers in Iran became permanent, and Iran was incorporated into the international system of sovereign states. This incorporation greatly enhanced the notions of the state and service to the state. The modern conception of the state as an impersonal\n\nThe Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries\n\n29\n\norganization in charge of the commonweal of the nation became more current and more clearly understood. Qa'em-Maqam, the elder, a Zand bureaucrat, entered the service of the Qajars, became the minister of the crown prince, 'Abbas Mirza, and conducted the ultimately abortive military reforms of the first decades of the nineteenth century in Azerbaijan. His son, Mirza Abo'l-Qasem Qa'emMaqam, who succeeded him as the crown prince's minister and became the prime minister of Mohammad Shah in 1834, was an opponent of absolute arbitrary authority of the ruler and a strong advocate of service to the state. On the occasion of what he considered excessive royal largesse, he opposed the king and reprimanded him, saying: \"We both have authority in the service of the Iranian State and are not entitled to more than one hundred thousand tutnans of the subject's money. You are greater than me in the service of the state. If you wish to be in charge of the hospitality of the nation of Iran, appoint yourself to that task and take eighty thousand tumans, leaving twenty thousand to me. Otherwise, I will undertake this function and you should graciously make do with twenty thousand tumans.\"™ When cutting many of the pensions and benefices, Qa'em-Maqam ridiculed a basic tenet of the ethos of patrimonialism that justified the distribution of benefices by reportedly saying: \"the state needs soldiers, not du'a-gus (those praying for the perpetuity of the dynasty in exchange for their benefices).\"1'0 The new political ethos was unpalatable to the king, who ordered his prime minister to be executed after some eighteen months in office. Qa'em-Maqam's successor, Haji Mirza Aqasi is, according to Sadr al-Tavarikh, the first grand vazir to be designated \"The First Person of Iran\" (shakhs-e avval-e Iran, that is, the first servant of the state).\"91 Significantly, it was the representatives of foreign states (doval-e kharejeh) who first designated him thus. A decree of Naser al-Din in November 1872, establishing some ministries and a cabinet, designated the prime minister as the \"First Person of the State\" responsible to the king.92 By the end of the century, the use of the title First Person for the prime minister became routine.93 The decree of August 5, 1906, which granted Iran a parliament, referred to the prime minister as the First Person of the State. Later in the twentieth century, this designation is modified to the \"First Person of the Nation\" (mamlekat) and applied to the king. The incorporation of Iran into the international system of sovereign states induced attempts at modernizing the state, which in Iran as in the Ottoman empire began with efforts to modernize military organization and create a standing army. To underscore the importance of the international influence, it is worth pointing out that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (set apart from all others in Table 4 on government expenditure) was the first to become a hierarchically organized and highly differentiated department on the basis of functional division of labor.94 Furthermore, beginning with Amir Nezam in 1848, the impetus to the modernization of the state and administrative rationalization of other departments came from men in the diplomatic service.95 The international influence also softened the political ethos of patrimonialism and put an end to brutal practices necessitated by the excessive\n\n30\n\nRise of the Modern State and the Transformation of Society\n\npersonalism of the system of delegated authority. Although previous prime ministers such as Haji Ebrahim, Qa'em-Maqam, and Amir Nezam had been executed upon dismissal, usually with their relatives and dependents, by 1873 Naser al-Din was concerned that Iran might look \"uncivilized and barbarian\" in European eyes.90 When the king dismissed the reforming prime minister, Moshir al-Dawleh, in September, he remained alive; henceforth, Iranian prime ministers could count on that after dismissal from high office. Even though the idea of the modem state gained currency and became the ideal of the reformers, repeated attempts to realize it by reorganizing and modernizing Qajar government ran into insurmountable obstacles and ended in failure. Inspired by the abortive military reforms of the Ottoman Sultan Selim III, the first reforms to modernize the Iranian state began in Azerbaijan by the crown prince and regent, 'Abbas Mirza, and his minister, Mirza Bozorg Qa'em-Maqam, during the first decade of the nineteenth century. The defensive character of this modernization is evident from the complete primacy of military organization, from their historical context—the Perso-Russian wars—and from their geographical concentration on Azerbaijan, the region on the border of Czarist Russia. The measures to reorganize the military system were referred to as nezam-e jadid (the New Order). It consisted in the creation of a new standing army of 12,000, organized and trained according to modern military methods, first by fugitive Russian officers and then by French, British, and other European advisors. This standing army was supported by 24,000 tribal horsemen and by irregular volunteers in wartime. 'Abbas Mirza developed military industries and sent students to England to be trained as military engineers arid technicians. He also built Western-style fortresses under the supervision of a French engineer.07 To sustain his military reforms, the crown prince and his minister undertook a number of centralizing measures along the traditional lines. Lands belonging to the khaleseh (royal domains) were identified, surveyed, and registered, and repair of the irrigation network of connected wells (qanat) was undertaken to increase government revenue from water dues, to be charged after an initial period of grace.98 New judges were appointed and an attempt was made to centralize the judiciary system through a divan-khaneh (the ruler's bureau of justice); tax assessments were to be submitted for approval to the same organ.09 To improve communication, hostels and carriage houses were set up on major roads.100 'Abbas Mirza's reforms ended in failure after Iran's devastating defeat by Russia in 1827. Nevertheless, their importance is attested by the permanent imprint on the Persian language: the term nezam (order) and its derivative, nezami, have come to mean \"army\" and \"military,\" and the designation he introduced for the new infantry, sarbaz (he who is ready to lose his head), has become the common word for \"soldier\" in modern Persian.101 The most serious attempt to reform and centralize the state was undertaken by Naser al-Din Shah's first prime minister, Mirza Taqi Khan Amir Nezam from 1848 to 1951. As was the case with 'Abbas Mirza and Qa'em-\n\nThe Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries\n\n31\n\nMaqams, the cornerstone of Amir Nezam's modernization program was military reorganization. Amir Nezam sought to impose the obligation to supply soldiers—or the equivalent of their wages—by geographical area instead of granting land (tuyul) in exchange for the provision of contingents. This measure was aimed at assuring the loyalty of soldiers to the central government, rather than to the landlords, and at rationalizing recruitment. He also upgraded the fortifications, built guardhouses, forbad billeting and the customary direct exactions by soldiers and, to some extent, purged the army accounting books of pay for fictitious troops.102 The nominal strength of the army—that is, the potential mobilizing number—appears to have been increased from under 93,000 in January 1849 to over 137,000 in January 1852 (94,750 infantry, 23,419 cavalry). The effective strength of the army must also have been increased considerably because Sheil estimates it at about 70,000.103 Military reforms were as usual supported by increased centralization. Amir Nezam fixed the young Shah's personal allowance at 2000 tumans a month, cut pensions, undertook reassessment of land taxes, established tax auditors directly responsible to him, and collected overdue taxes.104 The divan-khaneh was given increasing prominence in the judiciary system and attempts were made to control the religious courts indirectly.105 Last but not least, Amir Nezam set up an extensive network of secret agents in order to increase the control of central government.106 Amir Nezam's military reforms were effective immediately and had a marked effect on improved internal security. Their effect, however, was not lasting and gradually eroded. By 1890 the nominal strength of the army was just over 90,000, but Curzon estimated the actual number serving to be one-third of this figure.107 Nor was soldier recruitment rationalized: Landlords, especially tribal landlords, continued to be relied on for supplying contingents. Cities did not supply soldiers for the army. Soldiers were haphazardly conscripted for life, badly and irregularly paid, and dismissed for part or most of the year. The cavalry usually sold the fodder allotment for their horses and let their beasts graze in the meadows. Real gains were made in strengthening central authority by Amir Nezam's reforms. Furthermore, improved communications, especially the creation of telegraph lines in the second half of the century, put provincial governors within instant reach of central government and greatly enhanced its authority. Reforms were halted for the best part of a decade with the dismissal of Amir Nezam, but Naser al-Din then carried out a number of successive administrative reorganizations in 1858, 1864, and 1866. These set up six centralized ministries, eliminating the position of prime minister and putting the ministers under the direct control of the Shah, but they proved unsatisfactory and Naser al-Din reverted to appointing Mirza Hosayn Khan Moshir al-Dawleh as prime minister in 1871. His reforming ministry lasted from November 1871 until September 1873. Reforms in the Ministry of Justice came first; they had in fact already begun in March 1871. Building on two earlier decrees issued\n\n32\n\nRise of the Modern State and the Transformation of Society\n\nin 1858 and 1862, Moshir al-Dawleh continued the effort to centralize the judiciary system by strengthening the central divan-khaneh. A court of appeals, an executive court, a legislative court to draw up regulations, and three specialized courts for dealing with criminal, commercial, and property cases were established in the Ministry of Justice. Other measures sought to regularize and rationalize the judiciary process.108 No radical reorganization of the army was attempted, and the reforms were confined to preventing peculation and other abuses along traditional lines. On the other hand, an attempt was made to distinguish salary (mavajeb) from pension (mastamarri) sharply. Salary was to be paid to the office and not, as had been the practice, to the person, and an administrative order by the prime minister early in 1872 stated that the crown had no special relationship to sons, kin, and government.109 In 1876, the Shah abolished the qarasuran corps, which were controlled by provincial governors and local notables, thereby limiting the governors' power and increasing central control of the armed forces.110 Given the familial nature of authority under patrimonialism, it is not surprising that, when Moshir al-Dawleh denied pensions to families of officials after their death, he was called immoral by his critics among the nobility. Furthermore, contrary to Moshir's reformist proclamations and intent, offices continued to be sold, especially to provincial governors who drew no salary. Nor did the crown cease to have a special relationship to sons, kin, and government.111 Naser al-Din also set up a Council of State, modeled after Napoleon's, which functioned intermittently from 1871 to 1891. This consultative body often met with no agenda and it was difficult to stop story telling and irrelevant discussions. The Shah also sought to promote functional division of labor among the ministries, but government continued to be plagued persistently by interference of one powerful official in the departmental domain of another.112 Frustrated by these difficulties, Naser al-Din became increasingly indifference to administrative reform by the 1880s. The one lasting result of attempts at reorganizing government administration was expansion of the central bureaucracy, which in the latter part of the century dwarfed that of the Safavids'. In the absence of increased sources of revenue, this set the stage for the bankruptcy of the Iranian state in the 1890s and 1900s. After 1890, there was rapid deterioration of state finances and fragmentation of power. To secure cash through pishkesh (gift), the Shah increased the turnover of governors, who tended to grant tax remissions and new pensions, especially to the 'ulama, in order to forestall disturbances in the provinces to which they were newly appointed.113 The Shah appointed a number of children with sonorous titles to high office. In addition to provincial governorships, departments of state were farmed out. There were flagrant court scandals and widespread demoralization. The Shah's harem grew to comprise some two hundred wives, and the court spending became reckless, while the treasury was run as a private bank by the prime minister and his brother. Tax collectors became more oppressive and there was a general breakdown of order caused by the lutis (local toughs), urban riots, and brigandage in the countryside.114 Thus, the gains made in strengthening the\n\nThe Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries\n\n33\n\nauthority of central government during the early years of Naser al-Din Shah's reign were eroded in his last years. The conditions deteriorated further under his successor, Mozaffar al-Din Shah (1896-1907), especially after the premiership of Amin al-Dawleh from 1897 to 1898 and the failure of his proposed reforms,115 and Iran entered the twentieth century with a disintegrating central authority and a financially bankrupt central government. The imposing presence of the imperialist powers, Russia and Britain, in the closing decades of the nineteenth century offered the crisis-ridden Iranian state alternatives for warding off insolvency other than increased centralization and more efficient taxation: granting concessions to foreign companies in exchange for royalties and foreign loans. From 1890 onward, these alternatives, especially loans, were used to prevent bankruptcy. Consequently, by the eve of"
