many people who helped me in various ways big and small, which are briefly acknowledged here. First of all I thank all the film directors, producers, camerapersons, actors, critics, and television producers who supplied me with copies of their films, videos, and biographies, and sometimes with stills of their films. Many of them also granted me interviews, in person or by telephone, mail, e-mail, and even tape recording. Underscoring the globalization and diasporization of Iranians—including mediamakers—these interviews spanned the globe, from Iran to various European countries, and from New Zealand to the United States. And underscoring the duration of the project, they extended in time from the mid-1970s to the late 2000s. The interviewees and filmmakers were Abbas (Abbas Attar), Nader Afshar Naderi, Jamsheed Akrami, Mohammad Reza Allamehzadeh, Farshad Aminian, Amir Amirani, Taghi Amirani, Jahanshah Ardalan, Shoja Azari, Fuad Badie, Ramin Bahrani, Bahram Baizai, Rakhshan Banietemad, Manuchehr Bibian, Arlene Dallalfar, Mahmud Dorudian, Ghasem Ebrahimian, Esmail Emami, Tanaz Eshaghian, Shirin Etessam, Anna Fahr, Golshifteh Farahani, Shahriar Farah­vashi, Simin Farkhondeh, Bahman Farmanara, Aryana Farshad, Jalal Fatemi, Tina Gharavi, Ali Ghelichi, Ebrahim Golestan, Shahla Haeri, Mohammad Reza Haeri, Khosrow Haritash, Melissa Hibbard, Mohammad Ali Issari, Erica Jordan, Pirooz Kalantari, Shahram Karimi, Maryam Kashani, Mehrdad Kashani, Maryam Keshavarz, Laleh Khadivi, Hossein Khandan, Fakhri Khorvash, Abbas Kiarostami, Bahman Kiarostami, Masud Kimiai, Parviz Kimiavi, Kim Longinotto, Bahman Maghsoudlou, Moslem Mansouri,\n\nDariush Mehrjui, Ziba Mir-Hosseini, Bahman Mofid, Mojtaba Mirtahmasb, Behnaz A.

Each volume’s bibliography provides details of the interviews. I interviewed several cinema and television administrators in Iran during the Pahlavi and Islamic Republic periods to gain insight into official procedures and perspectives. Those interviewed included Gholamhosain Alaqeh­band, Mohammad Beheshti, Mohammad Hasan Khoshnevis, Kambiz Mahmoudi, and Alireza Shojanoori. To gain insight into the movies’ sociohistorical contexts of production and reception I interviewed spectators, witnesses, relatives, and scholars. These included Mehrdad Amanat, Zia Ashraf Nasr, Hamid Khan Bakhtiari, Cosroe Chaqueri, Mohammad Ali Djamal­ zadeh, Houshang Golmakani, Faezeh Golshan, Jalal Golshan, Shusha Guppy, Ahmet Gurata, Latifeh Haghighi, Jafar Hakimzadeh, Amir Hassanpour, Badi’eh Misaqiyeh (Eshraghian), Reza Nafisi (my uncle), Parviz Navi, Alaviyeh Okhovat (my grandmother), Batul Okhovat (my mother), Amir Bahman Samsam, Emmanuel Sevrugian, and Ali Shakeri. The Foundation for Iranian Studies in Washington kindly supplied me with transcripts of interviews with major cinema, television, and culture industry leaders of the Pahlavi era, including transcripts of lengthy interviews with Farrokh Gaffary, Shahrokh Golestan, Kambiz Mahmoudi, Mohammad Naficy, Arby Ovanessian, and Mehrdad Pahlbod. Likewise, the Boroumand Foundation in Washington, which documents human rights violations in Iran, provided me with newspaper clippings on the Rex Cinema fire in Abadan and political persecutions in Iran. Poori Soltani, a senior research librarian at the National Library of Iran, graciously supplied me with data on film periodicals. Hosain Tousi, the director general of mcig’s Research and Cinematic Relations immediately after the revolution, provided me with the early, unpublished regulations and xiv\n\nac k no w l e d gmen t s\n\nguidelines governing film review and censorship under the Islamic Republic. Hasan Khoshnevis, director of the National Film Archive of Iran, facilitated my research and film viewing at the archive in Tehran and sat for interviews with me. I also benefited from discussions with other colleagues at the national film archive, namely Gholam Haidari, Fereydoun Khameneipour, and Ladan Taheri. To examine nonfiction films about Iran, I visited the United States National Archives and Records Services and the Library of Congress’s Motion Picture, Broadcasting, and Recorded Sound Division, both in Washington, to examine records of usia/usis films and other documentaries. A visit to the Defense Audiovisual Agency at Norton Air Force Base, San Bernardino, California, produced information on military newsreels and raw footage shot by U.S. military units inside Iran after the Second World War. The ucla Film and Television Archive helped me with information on Hearst News and Hearst Metrotone News newsreels. A visit to the University of South Carolina helped with materials on the following newsreels about Iran: Fox News, Fox Movietone, Paramount News, Pathé News, Universal Newsreel, UPITN, Visnews, and Pathé Sound News. The British National Film Archives and the British Film Institute in London were helpful on various newsreels and documentaries on Iran. I also visited the British Public Records Office to examine the files of the British Council’s cultural activities in Iran. In the United States I obtained the Confidential United States Central Files on Iran’s Internal Affairs and the Foreign Affairs Records of the Department of State Relating to Internal Affairs of Iran for the Second World War and the Cold War through microfilm and Internet research. These British and American diplomatic files are rich in documents relating to Iran’s sociopolitical and cultural conditions, if one persists long enough in sifting through thousands of pages of unrelated materials. They proved invaluable in my charting the rivalry among the former allies after the Second World War to influence the hearts and minds of Iranians through cinema. At the Danish Film Institute in Copenhagen, the archivist Mikael Braae helped me with screening and translating the railway film Iran, the New Persia. Another archivist, Palle Bøgelund Petterson, supplied additional printed information and films. Professor I. B. Bondebjerg, head of the University of Copenhagen’s Department of Media, Cognition, and Communication, facilitated my visit and research in the Danish capital. In Washington I was able to examine the collection of Antoin Sevruguin’s photographs at the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery thanks to Massumeh Farhad, the chief curator and the curator of Islamic art. In Heidelberg I interviewed Sevruguin’s grandson, Emmanuel ac kno wled gments\n\nxv\n\nSevrugian, for further insight into his grandfather’s photographic and filmic career. At the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, I examined the M. Eleanor Fitzgerald Papers for materials on Nilla Cram Cook, with assistance from the archivist Christel Maass. Finally, I visited the Brigham Young University Archives to examine Merian C. Cooper’s papers on Grass and King Kong, and I visited the Museum of Modern Art in New York to view the original blackand-white and tinted versions of Grass, as well as footage shot for its remake. I gained further information about films on Iran by corresponding with the Imperial War Museum in London (for wartime newsreels), the Scottish Film Archive and the British Petroleum Company Limited (for oil films), the United Nations Visual Material Library (for un films on Iran), the Sherman Grinberg Film Library (for various newsreels), the John E. Allen Inc. Film Library (for Kinogram and Telenews newsreels), and the Abraham F. Rad Contemporary Jewish Film Archive in Jerusalem. For television newscasts and documentaries on Iran, I visited and corresponded with various television archives, including the abc News Television Archive, the cbs News Film/Tape Documentary Archive, the nbc News Television Archive, the pbs News Tape Archive, the bbc News Television Archive, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the ctv Television Network (Canada), and the Vanderbilt Television News Archive in Nashville. Abazar Sepehri, head Middle Eastern librarian at the University of Texas, Austin, helped me many times to track down Persian-language sources and articles. Likewise, Jet Prendeville, the art and architecture librarian at Rice University, assisted me in tracking down English and foreign-language film sources. Academic colleagues in various disciplines in the United States were very helpful. Paula Amad and Peter Bloom provided me with copies of the film Yellow Cruise and with relevant materials on it; Jennifer Fey commented on my paper on Rakhshan Banietemad, as did Janet Afary on the chapters on Reza Shah and the preface, Marianne Hopmann on my discussion of the oral tradition, and Majid Naficy on parts of chapter 6 (vol. 2) and the preface (vol. 1). George Marcus, Chuck Kleinhans, Mehdy Naficy, Nahal Naficy, Azar Nafisi, and Mohammad Nafissi commented on the preface. Philip Lutgendorf shared with me his unpublished paper on Indian cinema, and Natasa Durovicova shared her articles on sound and dubbing. Camron Michael Amin provided information on U.S. government files on Iran, and Amir Hassanpour provided information on Kurdish cinema and satellite television. Jalil Doostkhah helped with the names of the Isfahan circle of intellectuals. Mehrnaz SaeedVafa was extremely helpful throughout my research, supplying me with films xvi\n\nac k no w l e d gmen t s\n\nand assisting me in tracking down information on Iranian cinema and filmmakers. Colleagues in Iran were also very helpful. Houshang Golmakani, editor in chief of Mahnameh-ye Sinemai-ye Film, made sure that I received issues of the journal, sent me stills that I requested, and assisted with other inquiries. Mohammad Atebbai of Iranian Independents put several documentaries at my disposal. The documentarian Pirooz Kalantari was conscientious and generous in supplying me with documents, books, films, photographs, and other research materials from Iran, far beyond his own works. Shahin Kharazmi of Tehran’s Industrial Management Institute supplied me with data on media uses and audience demography in Iran. Esmail Emami facilitated my meeting with members of the Iranian Society of Documentary Filmmakers in Tehran. Mohammad Tahaminejad and Homayun Emami also helped with information on documentary cinema. Elsewhere, the art curator Rose Issa in London shared with me videos and posters of Iranian movies. The journalist Homa Sarshar and the Center for Iranian Jewish Oral History in Los Angeles kindly supplied me with a copy of the film A Mother for Shamsi. Mehdi Zamani facilitated my interview in Los Angeles with the actor Bahman Mofid, while Mohammad Ali Yazdi did the same for my interview with Sohrab Shahid Saless. The photographer and artist Soody Sharifi kindly put at my disposal her photograph of the “movie set.” Sima Shakhsari of the University of California, Berkeley, helped to identify Iranian blogs and movie blogs. Debra Zimmerman of Women Make Movies made Iranian films available for my viewing, as did Barbara Scharess, the director of programming at Chicago’s Gene Siskel Film Center. I helped launch two long-lasting annual film festivals at universities in the United States. I worked with Geoffrey Gilmore in 1990, then of the ucla Film and Television Archive, to curate one of the first and longest-running festivals of Iranian cinema in the United States. In Houston I worked with Marian Luntz, the film curator of the Museum of Fine Art, and Charles Dove, cinema director at Rice University, to organize an annual festival of Iranian films there. Programming and curating these festivals, which still continue, provided me with important venues and opportunities for further research, film viewing, interviews with filmmakers, and the promotion of Iranian cinema. At Rice University my research assistant Danny Stuyck and the visual resource assistant Kathleen Hamilton scanned still images for the book. Michael Dyrby Jensen translated a Danish text for me. The anthropology doctoral student Nahal Naficy was a valuable, resourceful, and cheerful help as my primary bilingual research assistant. She wrote the draft of the caption on Sharifi’s “movie set” artwork (chapter 4, vol. 2). At Northwestern University ac kno wled gments\n\nxvii\n\nmy research assistants Neha Kamdar, Daniel Bashara, John Nicolau, Jason Roberts, and Racquel Gates helped with the book’s images and bibliography. The research phases of the book were funded in large part by summer research grants that I received from the deans of humanities at Rice University, Gayle Stokes and Gary Wihl, which allowed me to take research trips and to visit archives in various countries, as well as to write. The Art History Department’s Segal Fund at Rice University paid for my research assistants and equipment. A travel-to-collection grant from ucla’s Von Gruenbaum Center for Middle East Studies made possible my research visit to the Museum of Modern Art in New York. The writing phase of the book was primarily funded by major national grants from the National Endowment for Humanities Fellowship (neh05020401) and the American Council of Learned Societies, the Social Science Research Council, and the National Endowment for Humanities International and Area Studies Fellowship (r14820–363000, neh fa-51979, osr 05020401), which Rice University matched, thus allowing me to spend the academic year 2004–5 entirely on writing the bulk of the manuscript. Gary Wihl also kindly provided subvention funds for the publication of this multivolume book, as did Barbara O’Keefe, Northwestern University’s dean of the School of Communication. Northwestern University in Qatar also contributed. I thank all these institutions and individuals for their generous assistance. My editor Ann Klefstad went through the manuscript as usual with a finetoothed comb, helping to sculpt the text. Ken Wissoker, editorial director at Duke University Press, was a delight to work with; he guided the project with openness, patience, wisdom, and élan. A project as extensive as this naturally involves not only professional colleagues but also family and friends in various witting and unwitting capacities. My siblings—Naficeh, Nahid, Nasrin, Nooshin, Mehdy, and Majid—all helped in one way or another with research, information gathering, and the mailing of films and other materials for the book. I interviewed my mother and my paternal grandmother about their social lives and experiences with cinema. I learned to appreciate Iranian popular culture, perhaps initially from the joyful and lilting manner in which my mother sang the popular songs of her youth, songs that her strict Muslim parents had forbidden to her. My father’s research-mindedness and intellectual curiosity, which turned our childhood outings into lessons in local botany and medical anthropology, became a model for my commitment to academic research and education. During my research travels many family members and friends in various places xviii\n\nac k no w l e d gmen t s\n\nprovided me with a home away from home: Mehdy Naficy and Fariba JafarShaghaghi in Heidelberg; Mohammad Nafissi and Georgiana Parry-Crooke in London; Fatemeh Ebtehaj and Hamid Hakimzadeh in London; Azar Nafisi and Bijan Naderi in Washington; Nastaran and Vahid Naficy in Tehran; and Paul and Helen Edwards in Helena, Montana. Montana’s majestic and enduring natural world offered an implacable contrast against which human history, particularly one as recent and as marred with moral and political ambiguities as that of the cinema and entertainment fields, found its proper perspective. This book has been with me for so long that it feels like a third child, older than my two biological children, Cameron and Shayda, both of whom are now thriving, idealistic young people close to the age at which I unknowingly began this project. My life partner Carol (Kelly) Edwards has been with me every step of the way, through thick and thin, in Iran, in the United States, and in many other places in between. All three have been unconditionally supportive of my life choices, my career and its demands, including this book project (Kelly scanned many of the stills). I hope that I have, in the end, been deserving of their respect, love, and trust.\n\nac kno wled gments\n\nxix\n\norga niz at ion of t he volumes\n\nT\n\nhe book is divided into four volumes, covering the social history of over a century of Iranian cinema, from around 1897 to about 2010. The history of Iranian society and the cinema it produced in this period is bookended by two revolutions: the 1905–11 Constitutional Revolution, which brought in a constitutional monarchy, and the 1978–79 Islamic Revolution, which installed a republican theocratic state. While the impact of the first revolution on cinema and film culture was apparently limited and inchoate, the latter revolution profoundly affected them, resulting in their unprecedented efflorescence. As a work of social history and theory, these volumes deal not only with such chronological developments in society and in the film industry but also with the synchronic contexts, formations, dispositions, and maneuvers that overdetermined modernity in Iran and a dynamically evolving film industry and its unique products. I locate the film industry and its mode of production, narratives, aesthetics, and generic forms in the interplay of deeply rooted Iranian performative and visual arts and what was imported, adopted, adapted, translated, mistranslated, and hybridized from the West. The interplay between Iranian and Islamic philosophies and aesthetics complicated and channeled cinema, particularly that involving women, in ways unique to Iran, which are discussed throughout the volumes. Likewise, the contribution of Iranian ethnoreligious minorities, both widespread and profound, gave Iranian cinema additional specificity. The volumes also situate Iranian cinema at the intersection of state-driven authoritarian modernization, nationalist and Islamist politics, and geopolitics\n\nduring its tumultuous century, charting the manner in which local, national, regional, and international powers competed for ascendancy in Iran, affecting what Iranians saw on screens, what they produced, and the technologies they adopted. The logic of dividing the work into four volumes is driven by both sociopolitical developments and the evolution of the film industry. While these volumes are autonomous, each contributes to the understanding and appreciation of the others, as certain theoretical, stylistic, industrial, commercial, cultural, religious, sociopolitical, biographical, authorial, and governmental elements form lines of inquiry pursued throughout, gathering momentum and weight. Each volume has a table of contents, a bibliography, an index, and, when needed, appendices.\n\nVolume 1: The Artisanal Era, 1897–1941 This volume offers a theory linking Iranian modernity and national identity with the emergence of an inchoate artisanal cinema and with an othered cinematic subjectivity. Qajar-era cinema consisted of the exhibition of foreign actualities and narratives and the production of a limited number of domestic actualities and comic skits by pioneer exhibitors and producers, all of whom are featured. The image of women on the screens and the presence of women as spectators in movie houses proved controversial, resulting in the first act of film censorship. Borrowing from the curtain reciting tradition, live movie translators (dilmaj) helped increase narrative comprehension and the enjoyment of Western movies. Reza Shah Pahlavi dissolved the Qajar dynasty in 1925 and ruled until 1941. During his rule, the first Pahlavi period, the state implemented an authoritarian syncretic Westernization program that attempted to modernize and secularize the multicultural, multilingual, and multiethnic Iranians into a homogenous modern nation. Cinematic representations of a fast modernizing Iran in documentaries and fiction movies were encouraged, photography and movie production were tightly controlled, movie houses were regulated, and perceived affronts to Iran in Western documentaries were taken seriously. The veil was outlawed and dandies flourished. All these developments receive extensive coverage in this volume. Despite efforts to centralize and control cinema, film production proved marginal to state formation and remained artisanal. Only one silent feature film was produced domestically, while all sound features were produced by an Iranian expatriate in India. This xxii\n\no r g ani zat i on of t he v olu mes\n\nlatter fact and others discussed in the volume show Iranian cinema’s transnational nature from the start.\n\nVolume 2: The Industrializing Years, 1941–1978 During the second Pahlavi period (Mohammad Reza Shah, 1941–79), cinema flourished and became industrialized, producing at its height over ninety films a year. The state was instrumental in building the infrastructures of the cinema and television industries, and it instituted a vast apparatus of censorship and patronage. During the Second World War and its aftermath, the three major Allied powers—the United Kingdom, the United States, and the ussr—competed with each other to control what Iranians saw on movie screens. One chapter examines this fascinating history. In the subsequent decades, two major parallel cinemas emerged: the commercial filmfarsi movies, popular with average spectators, forming the bulk of the output, and a smaller but influential cinema of dissent, the new-wave cinema. The commercial filmfarsi movies, exemplified by the stewpot and tough-guy genres discussed extensively in two chapters, were for entertainment purposes and drew their power and charm from their stars and their rootedness in Iranian traditions, which were juxtaposed favorably and often comically or melodramatically with modern Western traditions. A dynamic nonfiction cinema evolved, which receives a chapter. Ironically, the state both funded and censored much of the new-wave cinema, which grew bolder in its criticism and impact as Pahlavi authoritarianism consolidated. The new-wave films, produced by the collaboration of Westernized filmmakers with modernist dissident writers, did well in international film festivals, starting the globalization of Iranian cinema. The impending revolution could retrospectively be read in the fear-driven narratives of the new-wave films and in the various cultural struggles around official culture and arts festivals, the censorship of films, religious sermons on audiocassettes, poetry reading nights, television trials and confessions, and underground filming, all of which I discuss at length.\n\nVolume 3: The Islamicate Period, 1978–1984 Identified toward the end of the Shah’s rule as one of the agents of moral corruption in the country, movies and movie houses became targets of a risorg a n izatio n o f the vo lumes\n\nxxiii\n\ning anti-Shah movement, resulting in the destruction of a third of all movie houses nationwide. This volume charts both such revolutionary destruction and the subsequent rebuilding and evolution of the film and media industries. Many above-the-line personnel in these industries found themselves sidelined, banned, arrested, deprived of property, or exiled. The star system, a major attraction of filmfarsi cinema, was thus dismantled. Movies were banned, cut, redubbed, and painted over to remove offending features. After such iconoclastic destructions and purification the new Islamic regime undertook a wide-ranging effort to institutionalize a new film industry whose values would be commensurate with the newly formulated Islamicate values. The first rules and regulations governing film production and exhibition were adopted in 1982. Like the second Pahlavi regime, the ayatollahs’ regime put into place a strong, centralized, and draconian system of state regu­ lation and patronage to encourage politically correct movies. The import of foreign movies oscillated but was eventually banned, leaving the field open for a new domestic cinema. The long war with Iraq, the gendered segregation of space, and the imposition of the veil on women encouraged certain ideological and aesthetic trends. Foremost was the reconceptualization of cinema from a despised agent of corruption and othering to an agent of nation building and selfing. However, the resulting Islamicate cinema and culture were neither homogeneous nor static. They evolved with considerable personal, institutional, and ideological struggles.\n\nVolume 4: The Globalizing Era, 1984–2010 The revolutionary experience, the bloody eight-year war with Iraq, and the perceived Western cultural invasion of Iran all encouraged soul searching, national epistemophilia, and a desire for self-representation, resulting in an array of documentary films and film forms about the revolution, war, and the various social ills and inequalities that accumulated under the Islamist regime. The state-run television and fiction film industries, too, funded and supported filmmakers committed to Islam who made powerful “imposed war” movies in which sacred subjectivity replaced modernist subjectivity. Women’s presence both on camera and behind the camera increased significantly in all genres and types of films, in both the television and movie industries, leading to a veritable “women’s cinema.” The veil evolved from a repressive social institution to a dynamic social practice and critical aesthetics. A deepening sociopolitical and cultural struggle over cinema, media, and xxiv\n\no r g ani zat i on of t he v olu mes\n\nculture, and ultimately the legitimacy of the Islamic Republic, emerged in the country. This was reflected in, and shaped by, a new form of public diplomacy, chiefly between Iran and the United States, during Mohammad Khatami’s presidency, which intensified under his successor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. In a new “cultural turn” the antagonistic governments began to recruit all sorts of mutual domestic, diasporic, and international film, television, radio, and Internet media and formations to serve this diplomacy, sometimes with dire consequences for the participants. Foreign and exile videos and satellite televisions were officially banned, but enforcement was chaotic, encouraging a thriving culture of resistance that continues to date. With the rise of opposition to the Islamic Republic regime a dissident Internet cinema emerged. The postrevolution era bred its own dissident art-house parallel cinema, involving some of the best Pahlavi-era new-wave directors and a new crop of innovative postrevolution directors, placing Iranian cinema on the map of the vital world cinemas. They brought self-respect and prestige for Iranians at home and abroad. The displacement, dispersion, and exile of a massive number of Iranians, many in the visual and performing arts and cinema and television, resulted in new formations in Iran’s social history and cinematic history—a diasporic formation of people with a complex subjectivity and an “accented cinema,” made by first-generation émigrés and their second- and third-generation descendants. Both the wide circulation of Iran-made films and those Iranians made in the diaspora, as well as the vast diasporic dispersion of Iranians helped globalize Iranian cinema. One chapter deals with each of these developments.\n\norg a n izatio n o f the vo lumes\n\nxxv\n\na wor d a bou t il lus t r at ions\n\nI\n\nhave used several types of illustration here, each providing supplementary or complementary material to the text. Production stills show something of the behind-the-scenes process. Frame enlargements, taken directly from films or videos, offer visuals for textual analyses of the films’ aesthetic and generic systems. Posters offer not only an encapsulated rendition of the film by artists other than filmmakers but also showcase the art of poster design and production, which form important components of the movies’ publicity, exhibition, and reception. Like the movies themselves, this art also evolved over time, an evolution discernable in the posters included in the present volumes. Cartoons and other material objects about cinema demonstrate the wider circulation of things filmic among Iranians. The flyers announcing film screenings and cultural and political events featuring screenings served as important vehicles in exile for advertising, political agitprop, and film exhibition immediately after the 1978–79 revolution. They provide a good sense of the films, of the political culture of the time, and of the sponsoring groups. Finally, the many tables in the book offer other forms of data for the analysis of the films’ cultural contexts, such as audience demography, production output, film export and import, organizations involved in production, and the regulations concerning censorship and banning of movies. Because of the diversity of sources and the deterioration of some films and videos, the quality of the pictorial illustrations varies.\n\na bbr e v i at ions\n\napi Anglo Persian Institute bc British Council c idcya Center for the Intellectual Development of Children and Young Adults faa Fine Arts Administration fidci Film Industry Development Corporation of Iran\n\nff Filmfarsi (Farsi-language films)\n\ngfw Golestan Film Workshop\n\nmca Ministry of Culture and Art\n\nmcig Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance\n\nmos Mithout (without) sound, filming without sound\n\nnefc National Educational Film Circuit nioc National Iranian Oil Company nirt National Iranian Radio and Television\n\npfc Progressive Filmmakers’ Cooperative (Kanun-e Sinemagaran-e Pishro)\n\npfoi People’s Fadaian Organization of Iran pmoi People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran pogo Public Opinion Guidance Organization savak Sazman Ettela’at va Amniat-e Keshvar (Homeland Intelligence and Security Organization) usia United States Information Agency usis United States Information Service voks All-Union Society for Cultural Relations (Soviet Union)\n\n1 in t er nat iona l h ag gl ing ov er ir a ni a n publ ic scr eens\n\nO\n\nn 25 August 1941 (3 Shahrivar 1320) at 8 p.m. the electricity in Tehran was cut, plunging the entire city, including the Shah’s palaces, into dark‑ ness and forcing panic‑stricken spectators to rush out of movie houses. They soon learned the reason for the electrical outage: Iran’s invasion by the Al‑ lied powers, despite Iran’s official neutrality in the Second World War. Within three weeks Reza Shah abdicated and left the country for a permanent exile, replaced by his son Mohammad Reza Shah. Between 1941 and 1947, when the country remained occupied by the Allies and under various Iranian mar‑ tial law regimes, there was an intense struggle over what types of documen‑ tary and fiction films Iranians could see on public screens, a struggle in which not only the Iranian state but also the major Allied powers participated through their embassies, official cultural organizations, and commercial film companies. While occupying Iran and riding roughshod over the country’s affairs and institutions, the major Allied powers—­the United States, the United King‑ dom, and the Soviet Union—­treated Iran like a partial ally, allowing domestic forces to act with relative impunity. A period of unprecedented freedom and chaos ensued in which interested parties vied to shape public opinion and achieve political ascendancy. The new young Shah, though inexperienced,\n\nwas interested in reestablishing the state’s hegemony over the vast, war‑torn country. The various prime ministers used the age‑old strategy of equilib‑ rium (movazeneh) to involve the Allies in Iranian affairs and to balance those interests against each other to ensure the country’s independence (McFarland 1981:6). Many traditions that Reza Shah had banned returned, but in modi‑ fied form. For example, after his abdication, Tehran Radio began a daily reci‑ tation of the Quran, reduced to weekly broadcasts by 1943. Religious schools returned. The chador for women and the turban and religious attire for men also returned in some areas. However, many of the women who did don the chador—­­for example, in Tehran and Isfahan—shunned the somber and official black chador (chador siah) of the past in favor of wearing the lighter colored prayer chador (chador namaz). The face mask that some women had worn previously was not restored. Religious holidays were observed again and religious lamentation, self‑flagellation, processions, and taziyeh performances returned. Many religious periodicals began publication. At the same time, Westernization was propelled forward by the presence of occupying forces and their languages, cultures, and social norms and practices. Dissident in‑ tellectuals and writers, such as Sadeq Hedayat, returned from exile, while imprisoned intellectuals, such as the Group-­53 communists arrested by Reza Shah, were released, and dandies proliferated. Differences among the Allies ensured that domestic factions—­the Shah, communists, Islamists, the secular intelligentsia, students, armed forces, ba‑ zaar merchants, and the press—­could each find foreign backing of one sort or another. Thus a cacophony of voices could be heard across the land. The socalled golden age of the Iranian press was afoot, as both the numbers and the circulation of published periodicals rose as never before (or perhaps since). Of 464 periodicals published in Iran between 1941 and 1947, only 41 had been in existence at the time of the invasion. These periodicals were published in eight languages: 433 in Persian, 10 in Turkish, 7 in Polish, 5 in Armenian, 3 in Kurdish, 3 in French, 2 in English, and 1 in Russian. The majority served as mouthpieces of various political factions, providing less information than the representation of sectarian views in the marketplace of ideas. Eighteen of the periodicals were published by foreign occupying powers: seven Polish, six Soviet, four British, and one American (McFarland 1981:158). During this pe‑ riod, Baba Shamal, a satirical periodical, frequently published cartoons—­full page on the cover and smaller caricatures, stories, and jokes inside—­in which it used popular films and actors, such as King Kong and the Marx Brothers, to critique anything from domestic and foreign politicians to the unhygienic conditions in Iranian movie houses. 2\n\ni nt e r nat i o n a l ha g g li n g\n\nThe United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union published periodicals both in their national languages and in Iranian languages as part of their public diplomacy strategy to influence Iran (Poland, a fourth Allied power, published only in Polish). Starting in February 1946 the Iran-­America Rela‑ tions Society (also known as the Iran-­America Society) began publishing an illustrated bilingual monthly magazine in Persian, Majalleh‑ye Iran va Amrika (Iran and the U.S.A.).1 In the first year, it carried advertisements for Iranian film companies, such as Caravan Film Corporation, and for American media conglomerates, such as the Radio Corporation of America. The latter adver‑ tised the arrival of the latest radio receivers, phonographs, musical recordings, film projectors, television sets, and household appliances, giving evidence of American commerce with Iran and the rise of Iranian interest in film and en‑ tertainment fields. The British legation in Tehran published one periodical in English, Tehran Daily News, and three in Persian. The Soviets were the most active, publishing one periodical in Russian and four in Persian. Like the Iran-­America Relations Society, the Iran and Soviet Cultural Relations Soci‑ ety in Tehran published a monthly magazine, Payam‑e No (New Message) (later Payam‑e Novin), which unlike the American monthly was a literary journal run by communist and leftist intellectuals, including Karim Keshavarz and Bozorg Alavi (Alavi 1997:261–62). Taqi Arani edited the short-­lived but influ‑ ential leftist literary and political journal Doniya (World), only twelve issues of which appeared between 1934 and 1935. It covered cinema under two main categories, as an industry (a modern medium of communication and trans‑ portation, along with radio, photography, and airplanes) and as an art form (a modern medium of materialist expression, along with theater, art, music, lit‑ erature, and translation) (Momeni 2005/1384:16). The Allied powers’ interjection into the Iranian public sphere extended to radio broadcasting, as did the influence of Iranian ethnic groups, the airing of whose languages had been discouraged under Reza Shah in the name of modern nationalism. Tehran Radio’s broadcast schedule for 1941, for exam‑ ple, shows that nightly news programs of fifteen to thirty minutes in Persian, Russian, Turkish, Arabic, and English dominated (the only other programs aired every night were the national anthem, Iranian and Western music, and a hygiene program). By 1944, the schedule of foreign-­language newscasts had grown to include news in French, while other foreign programs had also been added, including an Indian army program, the Voice of England program, a So‑ viet program, and a dance music program (McFarland 1981:517). The world’s leading broadcasting organization, the bbc, competed with a fledgling Ameri‑ can Forces Radio Network (Morley 2001). i nter natio nal haggling\n\n3\n\nThe Allies’ cultural arms competed to woo Iran into their particular spheres not only by publishing periodicals and broadcasting radio news but also by controlling what Iranians saw on movie screens. Their commercial film distributors in Iran, some of whom also ran commercial movie houses, contended with each other. Initially, the United States and the United King‑ dom collaborated in preparing and screening newsreels, but in the war’s after‑ math this collaboration turned into intense competition. That cooperation on cinematic matters during the war turned into confrontation in its aftermath was emblematic. The British felt that screening their films abroad benefited them ideologically, because movies “projected Britain” to the world, as well as economically, because “trade follows the film” (Jarvie 1992:110). The British and the Americans also competed against the Soviet Union, increasingly so during the Cold War. The public screening of educational, propaganda, and entertainment mov‑ ies was one arena in which Cold War ideological struggles played out most vis‑ ibly. The earliest significant instance of this four-­way power struggle involv‑ ing Americans, Britons, Soviets, and Iranians occurred with the formation of a government-­controlled film circuit for showing nontheatrical movies to Ira‑ nians nationwide (documentaries and short films). Iran and the United States were most involved in this endeavor.\n\nAmerican Involvement: The National Educational Film Circuit and Nilla Cram Cook (1910–1982) In 1945, the Iranian government established the National Educational Film Circuit (nefc) as a nationwide, nontheatrical film exhibition circuit for edu‑ cational movies. Although it was short lived, the complex form that it took and the diverse national, political, diplomatic, military, and commercial play‑ ers, film types, and film formats (16mm and 35mm) involved in this attempt at controlling what Iranians saw on the screen, makes a detailed examina‑ tion of the nefc worthwhile as a case study of complex negotiations over pub‑ lic diplomacy and national identity involving cinema. Iranian ministries and armed forces cooperated with the U.S. embassy, particularly its press attaché in Tehran, to run the nefc. Three of the committee’s eight members came from the Ministry of Education, who scheduled films for schools in Tehran. Three others came from the Ministry of the Interior’s Department of Theaters (Edareh‑ye Namayeshat). One of these was an American woman, Nilla Cram Cook, who headed the nefc. The other two members from the Ministry of 4\n\ni nt e r nat i o n a l ha g g li n g\n\nthe Interior were the legal advisor and lieutenant Mehdi Golsorkhi, the head of the Iranian army’s film unit, who played an instrumental role in the oper‑ ation of both the film circuit and in establishing the Artesh (Armed Forces) Film Studio. The remaining two nefc committee members were university professors responsible for the Persian-­language film scripts and commentar‑ ies that were delivered by live narrators during the screenings.2 The U.S. em‑ bassy in Tehran supplied all the noncommercial, nontheatrical films that the nefc showed. By a decree from the Iranian cabinet, the Ministry of the Interi‑ or’s Department of Theaters and the Ministry of Education shared the charge of censoring films and plays.3 The involvement of the ministries for internal security and public education in film censorship points to the role of propa‑ ganda and education in Iranian cinema. The placement of Cook at the head of the Department of Theaters and of the nefc meant that an American diplomat was in charge of censoring not only all the performing arts but also all nontheatrical and educational films in the country. Cook thus emerged as the censorship czar of the performing arts. Her involvement with the Iranian government had started in 1943, when the Ministry of the Interior hired her to run the Department of Theaters and a dance studio called the National Opera and Ballet (Cook 1949:406).4 A bo‑ hemian poet, dancer, and dramatist whose father, George Cram Cook, was a founder of the Provincetown Players in Massachusetts, Cook, like many Ira‑ nian film pioneers, was a complicated chameleon. She loved Eastern mysti‑ cism, Persian arts and poetry, and Indian mythology, religion, and culture, and she had experimented with different lifestyles (figure 1). She had “re‑ claimed” Hinduism, adopting the name Nagini, and spent some months in Mahatma Gandhi’s ashram, a controversial experience she wrote about mov‑ ingly in My Road to India (1939). She was a mysterious, multilingual hybrid who had lived in Greece, India, and Iran and who knew English, modern Greek, Italian, Turkish, Sanskrit, Hindi, and Persian. She converted to Islam, spent twelve years translating the Quran, and wrote an unpublished novel set in Iran. She disappeared in the 1950s only to resurface in 1982, when her death was announced in Austria (she had been living in Aspang near Vi‑ enna).5 While she was an official of the Iranian government, who signed all the exhibition licenses for movies and theater performances in the country, she was also a U.S. diplomat, who bore the title of “assistant to the press at‑ taché” of the U.S. embassy and who gave regular reports to the U.S. embassy about nefc operations, some of which I have used in writing this section.6 Newspapers in the United States gave accounts of her exploits in Iran. The Des Moines Register reported on her efforts as the “director of state theaters and i nter natio nal haggling\n\n5\n\n1 Nilla Cram Cook, Iran’s first censorship czar for cinema and the performing arts after the Second World War.

Some Iranians, such as the film historian Ja‑ mal Omid, claim that the young Shah’s government was too weak and naive to resist Allied pressure. The implication here is that the Americans imposed Cook on the Iranians. However, it may also have been Iranian cleverness to agree to Cook’s appointment to lure the United States into Iran as part of the country’s strategy of equilibrium, which allowed it to safeguard itself against the two traditional meddling powers, the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union. Other reasons may also have been involved, ones that require contextuali­ zation. Some time after the occupation of Iran, on 29 January 1942, the Brit‑ ish, Soviet, and Iranian governments signed the tripartite Treaty of Alliance governing their relationships and conduct in Iran during wartime, promising to evacuate the country six months after the termination of hostilities. Article III 2b of the treaty allowed the Allies to commandeer “all the means of com‑ munication throughout Iran, including railways, roads, rivers, aerodromes, 6\n\ni nt e r nat i o n a l ha g g li n g\n\nports, pipe lines and telephone, telegraph and wireless installations,” while Article III 2d gave them ”such measures of censorship control as they may require for all the means of communication” specified above. Granting the occupying foreign powers such total control of the country’s means of trans‑ portation and communication, while supposedly respecting its “territorial in‑ tegrity,” “sovereignty,” and “political independence,” was an unprecedented privilege in modern times (Shamim 1971:15–16). Although the list of Iranian media that the Allies were to commandeer did not include film, it likely was a silent partner in the agreement (note that radio was named). Soon, the Ameri­ cans became the chief supplier of lend-­lease war equipment and material to the Soviet Union through the Iranian transportation system, particularly the railway. It is probable that Cook was appointed as the czar of film and theater censorship in Iran to satisfy the Treaty of Alliance’s provisions. In the first half of the twentieth century a tradition of appointing foreign‑ ers as heads of sensitive government departments in Iran had been estab‑ lished as a means of creating, streamlining, and modernizing government bureaucracies. In the 1900s, for example, the Belgian Joseph Naus served as the country’s director of general customs, and the Russian colonel Vladimir Liakhov was head of the Iranian Cossack Brigade; in the 1910s, the American Morgan Shuster reorganized the country’s tax administration, the British na‑ tionals Hart and Henson were, respectively, the Ministry of Finance inspector and the director of customs, the Frenchman Moultire served as the director of the postal service, and the Swedish Colonel Jahrmalssen created the gen‑ darmerie force; and in the 1920s, the American financier Arthur Millspaugh was the treasurer general of Iran. Some of these people, as well as others not named here, served admirably in modernizing the administrative structures of the country, and some of them served the politics of their own countries, of other powers, or of their own and became pawns in political rivalries of vari‑ ous kinds. They formed what following Abdollah Mostofi we may call a “se‑ cret republic” of foreigners within Iran (1997:1036). In the context of this long list of foreign appointees, Cook’s hiring as the head of film censorship does not appear as such an anomaly. Her appointment merely fortified this foreign republic that worked both to modernize and Westernize Iran—­one of the ear‑ liest attempts at Western public diplomacy in Iran. Still, the appointment of a foreigner to such a high and sensitive position did create rancor. Cook claimed that the minister of the interior had “left the actual censorship of the cinema and the theater entirely up to me.” However, she had to expend much time and energy to fight off the “intrigues” orga‑ nized against her by local commercial exhibitors whose movies she censored. i nter natio nal haggling\n\n7\n\nFor example, in 1945 on order of the minister of the interior, she banned the screening of Hollywood gangster movies, a lucrative genre. One reason was to appease the Soviets. Another was that a study by the interior minister, a jurist and a former prosecuting attorney, had turned up evidence that gang‑ ster movies had inspired juvenile delinquency in Iran. Cook contended that in places where Iranian taste was not yet “corrupted” by Hollywood movies, documentaries were greeted with more enthusiasm than gangster movies. 8 To combat negative influences, the minister of the interior ordered Cook to re‑ view all motion picture licenses that the police had issued. He also instructed her to draft new regulations that would stiffen the punishment for the exhibi‑ tors of movies and shows that were “subversive to public morality” by subject‑ ing them to one year mandatory imprisonment. Previous regulations had al‑ lowed exhibitors convicted of such practices to get out of a three-­month jail term by paying a fine (Cook 1949:408–9). Harsher regulations and punishments, as well as the banning of popu‑ lar movies and genres, may have been the real causes of exhibitors’ dissatis‑ faction. If these were the reasons, they were not publicized, but others were: the previous censor in a petition to the interior minister questioned the ca‑ pabilities of Cook, “a female foreigner,” to deal with the subtleties of the Per‑ sian language and to properly conduct movie-­house inspections when she was spending her evenings rehearsing ballets (Cook 1949:409–11). Years later Omid claimed that “Cook’s sympathies were limited to safeguarding the Allies’ interests in Iran, and she paid no attention to, or had little knowl‑ edge of, the traditions and cultural values of Iranian society” (1995/1374:872). However, Cook was not as ignorant of Iranian history, culture, and art as critics claimed. She also headed the National Opera and Ballet, for whose performances she borrowed not only from Western theater but also from Ira‑ nian performing arts traditions, including mythology, poetry, tribal dances, and zurkhaneh (house of strength) performances, which she had studied. In search of discovering what she called a “Persian lyric stage,” she also experi‑ mented with choruses, chants, processions, and war dances, whose postures, attire, makeup, hairstyle, movements, and lyrics she borrowed from sculp‑ tured friezes of Persepolis, images on the coins recovered from the ruins of Susa, and classical Persian poetry (Cook 1949:412–19). Nesta Ramazani, who danced in Cook’s company, testifies in her memoirs to Cook’s deep love for Persian poetry and performance arts and to the way it inspired her ballet ideas and choreography (2002:164–236). In describing her efforts at creating and performing Iranian ballets for foreign audiences abroad, Cook’s identification with Persian culture comes through, as she includes herself in phrases such 8\n\ni nt e r nat i o n a l ha g g li n g\n\nas “It is essential, if we would be truly Iranian, to satirize ourselves on the forestage.” Her mining of ancient Persian arts traditions, based on the belief that “you must first find yourself,” countered what most Iranian dramatists and modernists, who looked mainly to the West for inspiration, were doing—­ with the exception of Abdolhosain Sepanta. Some of the protests against Cook may have been aimed at the Ministry of the Interior and at the police, which the critics could not attack directly for fear of reprisal. Others criticized her mostly because they wanted the line of authority in censorship changed. For example, the pro-­Hollywood and pro-­ Allies film magazine Holivud (Hollywood) wanted Cook ousted, suggesting that censorship be transferred from the Ministry of the Interior to the Minis‑ try of Education (Omid 1995/1374:873). But controversy worked to undermine Cook’s authority to the point that police and film exhibitors often reached their own, separate understandings of film censorship, bypassing her operations. Film exhibition thus proved im‑ provisational, echoing the chaos and spontaneity of cinema’s mode of pro‑ duction and narratives. Such chaos had some counterhegemonic effects, as filmmakers and entertainers took advantage of Cook’s situation to criticize the state. The noted actor Ezatollah Entezami, for example, claims that he and others slipped oppositional material past her desk because of her limited knowledge of Persian (quoted in Omid 1995/1374:888).9 Yet what Iranians as‑ cribed to their own cleverness and to Cook’s naiveté was, according to Cook, an “administrative policy” at the time, one meant to court left-­w ing approval by a “display of liberalism.” As a result, comic forestage songwriters and skit performers such as Entezami were given free reign to criticize society, “spar‑ ing neither municipality, nor courts, nor clergy,” as long as no names were used (Cook 1949:410). At any rate, as Ramazani notes, “Under the protection of the minister of the interior, she was able to fight off the intrigues organized against her by commercial and political interests and to lighten considerably the heavy hand of censorship. Numerous satires appeared in the theaters at this time” (2002:7). In 1946 Cook finally stepped down, or was forced to step down, from both her posts as the censorship czar and as the director of the ballet company. Soon, however, she founded the Studio for the Revival of the Classical Arts of Iran, which received funding in 1947 from the Department of Propaganda and Radio to take her Ballet of Azarbaijan on a successful tour of Turkey, Greece, Italy, and the Arab countries.10 Another key figure in nefc operations was Lieutenant Golsorkhi who, while maintaining his position as the head of the Iranian army film unit, i nter natio nal haggling\n\n9\n\nprojected nefc films and maintained the film equipment, on loan from the U.S. embassy. The U.S. press attaché praised his technical “ingenuity and resourcefulness.”11 In May 1945, the Iranian army seemed reluctant to con‑ tinue the cooperation of Golsorkhi with the nefc. The U.S. embassy in Teh‑ ran “feigned” an interest in working with the army’s rival, the gendarmerie, a ruse that “quickly changed the army’s attitude” and made it place resources at Golsorkhi’s disposal. His screenings became a regular feature of the Officers’ Club, “one of the finest buildings in Tehran and the center of much of its social life.”12 They were so popular that the army established Artesh (Armed Forces) Cinema on the club grounds, whose inauguration in 1945 was cele‑ brated with the Shah in attendance. The nefc operation primarily involved exhibiting 16mm educational films imported from the United States to Iranians in the Officers’ Club, in the army and gendarmerie barracks, in city schools and clubs, and in villages around Tehran. Golsorkhi carried the 16mm film projectors, which the U.S. embassy owned, in an old weapons carrier, modified to hold a large generator. Yet this equipment proved insufficient for the nefc’s expanding operations, so the new American press attaché, T. Cuyler Young, requested more 16mm sound projectors with microphones and more vehicles to meet the film screening needs of Isfahan, Fars, Hamadan, Kermanshah, and Kurdistan (the U.S. Per‑ sian Gulf Command Special Services Division supplied some of the equip‑ ment).13 Five Iranian operators in training would man the additional projec‑ tors and vehicles. He also requested a 35mm projector with which the film circuit could show entertaining shorts made in Hollywood. In what was a precursor to the usis (United States Information Service) film-­screening pro‑ gram via mobile film units of the 1950s, these projectors were transported in a jeep and a trailer owned by the Iranian army and in a 1942 Chevrolet fur‑ nished by the United States Office of War Information. Iranian technicians operated these makeshift mobile units and showed films not only in Tehran barracks but also in villages. Many of these screenings took place outdoors, where a narrator with a microphone translated and commented. The U.S. embassy supplied the nefc from its own film library in Tehran, which included the erpi (Western Electrical Research Products Inc.) Class‑ room Films.14 These were screened in schools, in adult education classes, and in Iran-­A merica Relations Society classes along with live commentaries read from scripts. By 1946, its third year of operation, the society had screened sixty films at fourteen meetings on subjects of science, education, health, ag‑ riculture, industry, and entertainment and had offered thirty-­three lectures in English and Persian on a variety of topics (Saleh 1946/1325:1).15 No edu­ 10\n\ni nt e r nat i o n a l ha g g li n g\n\ncational films dubbed into Persian were available on a regular basis at this time and Young, who would later become a professor at Princeton University, did not consider this a problem, since “Iranians regard the documentaries in English as quite harmless from a propaganda point of view.” Indeed, if they had been dubbed into Persian they might have come under harsher scrutiny.16 The embassy’s film library also contained many instructional films, such as Fight Syphilis, Livestock and Mankind, People of the Ozarks, Wise Use of Land Pays, The Farmer’s Wife, and Teen Aged Farm Hand, which the press attaché felt were not of sufficient interest to show. A commercial film importer, Iran Cinema, supplied more entertaining fare. Managed by two businessmen, Arnold Jacobson, a Jew, and Ali Vakili, a Muslim, Iran Cinema was the largest cinema chain in the country. It had the exclusive rights to import Paramount and mgm movies and offered to put at the disposal of the Department of Theaters some two hundred theatrical shorts. Among these were the mgm travelogue series The Voice of the Globe, about the forty-­eight contiguous states, which the U.S. press attaché thought suitable for screening at functions organized by both the Iran-­America Re‑ lations Society and the Public Opinion Guidance Organization (pogo). The screening of these theatrical shorts had given the society a new lease on life, so there was reason to believe that entertainment movies could function simi‑ larly in other venues. Cook herself owned the rights to fifty-­t wo Disney mov‑ ies, which she wanted to show via the nefc. Iran Cinema made another novel and grandiose proposal, this time to cre‑ ate a network of at least three hundred 16mm “little cinemas” in towns and villages that up to then had never seen movies. With its network of theatri‑ cal cinemas in the country, its exclusive rights to distribute mgm movies, and its contracts with other film companies, Iran Cinema was in a good position to make this proposal, which according to Cook would have been “a veritable landslide for American film interests.”17 Cook actively championed Iran Cin‑ ema’s proposal in American diplomatic, military, and commercial circles. In a letter to the U.S. press attaché in Tehran, for example, she noted that Jacob‑ son was ready to purchase surplus 16mm projectors of the U.S. army at full value to equip his proposed little cinemas, that he had a proven track record as a manager of a successful chain of theaters, and that he had proved he “cared for nothing but American films.” His quid pro quo in this proposal was that if the Americans helped him equip and supply his little theaters with commer‑ cial movies on 16mm format, he would establish a regular circuit of American documentaries in those theaters.18 In addition to a desire for more diverse programming, there were reasons i nter natio nal haggling\n\n11\n\nfor suggesting that 35mm Hollywood movies be added. Films could subtly in‑ culcate an American lifestyle and values. The little cinemas could widen the reach and deepen the impact of these movies among the public at large.\n\nBritish Involvement: The British Council and the Anglo-­Persian Institute Britain established the Empire Marketing Board (emb) in 1926 to create a sense of unity throughout the empire and to revive imperial trade in vari‑ ous commodities in the colonies through propaganda including posters, pam‑ phlets, and exhibitions. The president of emb, Sir Stephen Tallents, published The Projection of England, which provided the ideological underpinning for this effort. In the book he argued that “if we are to play our part in the new world order, we need to master every means and every art by which we can communicate with other peoples. The need is especially urgent between our‑ selves and the other parts of the Empire. We are experimenting together in a novel political organization, in which are joined together peoples most widely separated from each other in space and character” (Tallents 1932:18). Soon, John Grierson set up the emb Film Unit to make “documentary” films. This unit grew from a staff of two in 1930 to thirty within three years and was later renamed the General Post Office (gpo) Film Unit when the parent institu‑ tion, emb, ceased operations and transferred its function to the gpo. By the start of the Second World War, the British documentary movement, through these government film units and other commercial and industrial producers, had created a sizeable trove of around three hundred films (Barsam 1992:77). Some would find their way to Iran during the war years and after. One conduit for moving these films was the British Council (bc), created in 1934 and chartered in 1940. The institution was set up as an independent body, but because it was to serve the aims of the British Empire, the govern‑ ment served as its primary funder and end user. Its overall aim was (and con‑ tinues to be) to promote a wider knowledge and appreciation of Great Britain in the world by means of cultural, educational, and technical cooperation—­an arm of the British public diplomacy. The British Council created the Anglo-­ Persian Institute (api), with branches in several cities, including Tehran, Shi‑ raz, and Isfahan. In 1944, the institute’s director, J. Sanderson, in a public speech in Shiraz stated the establishment’s goals as contributing to world peace by demonstrating to Iranians by means of English language, literature, film, lecture, music, drama, and the other arts “just what England is like and 12\n\ni nt e r nat i o n a l ha g g li n g\n\nwhat she stands for.”19 Wherever Britain had consulates and api branches, the bc taught English language classes and set up reading rooms, which car‑ ried local and British newspapers, books, and other information. These activ‑ ities were augmented by the screening of British films at bc, api, and other sites with twenty-­five mobile film vans, which in the 1940s traveled to the far reaches of the country.20 The British mobile film units had a long history in Iran, apparently dating back to 1908, when one unit was reported to have screened films in Abadan (Javdani 2002/1381:18), perhaps to the future em‑ ployees of the emerging Anglo-­Iranian Oil Company. According to Moham‑ mad Ali Issari, the British Council’s film officer, the mobile unit program be‑ gan small, with four used units obtained from the British operations in Iraq (Naficy 1982a). These British institutions in Iran, run by British diplomats, Foreign Office personnel, and their staff, were modeled on “lighthouses,” which were to cast the light of Western enlightenment on largely illiterate natives.21 Iranian film exhibitors with connections to the Soviet Union also tapped into this idea, naming many movie houses Mayak, the Russian term for “lighthouse bea‑ con” (later these theaters were called by their Persian name, Didehban). In Tehran, starting in 1941, British films were primarily screened at the bc headquarters in the Victory House on Ferdowsi Avenue, where British diplo‑ mats hosted dignitaries and members of the press. An indication of both the fluidity and the competitiveness of Allied relations with each other and with Iranian intellectuals is provided by Bozorg Alavi, who after his release from internment under Reza Shah for being a communist, worked at the British Victory House, under L. P. Elwell-­Sutton, until the end of the Second World War, when he joined the Iran-­Soviet Cultural Relations Society. The Shah’s regime derisively dubbed him and others as “British Communists.” Alavi was in charge of receiving war news from British sources, editing it, and deliver‑ ing it to Radio Tehran for broadcast on the Allied Radio (Radio Mottafeqin) (Alavi 1997:242–44). The British also screened newsreels and documentary films, some very pro-­Shah, at commercial cinemas, accompanied by Persian narration. Finally, they had a hand in establishing the first newsreel cinema in Tehran in 1943, the 352-­seat Akhbar (News) Cinema, managed by Jacob‑ son. They also helped create the film magazine Holivud, edited by the bc em‑ ployee Alireza Amirmoez. They also made Persian-­language news magazines and magazines for women and children and broadcast radio programs, which matched those of the Soviets in volume. Among the feature documentaries was Roy Boulting’s Desert Victory (1943), “a lucid and breath-­taking exposition” (Barnouw 1993:147) of the El i nter natio nal haggling\n\n13\n\nAla­mein battle in North Africa in which the Allied forces, headed by the Brit‑ ish field marshal Bernard Law Montgomery, defeated the German forces of Erwin Rommel. The intimate coverage of the fighting soldiers in this fero‑ cious battle elicited warm audience responses in Tabriz, Urumieh, Maragheh, and other northeastern cities and did much to “bolster British prestige” (Sadr 2003/1381:80). Akhbar Cinema typically screened five British newsreels a week with a Persian soundtrack, such as War Pictorial and British Movie­tone, received from the British embassy in Cairo. These films were given press screenings; reviews increased audiences, who turned to the films as reliable sources of war news. The cinema also screened The Royal Family of Persia, made by British filmmakers, which was heavily publicized. Holivud featured a still from the film on its cover and devoted five pages to it. By now, rivalry between the former allies was seeping into the realm of cinema: The Royal Family of Persia was made only eight months after Iran, a Soviet film that had featured the Allied lend-­lease war efforts as well as the Shah and his family, including queen Fawziah (Tahaminejad 2004a:27, 32). Reports from British authorities in various cities give a good sense of the movies Iranians saw and of their reactions in 1945. The vice-­consul in Tabriz reported that Charlie Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy movies were popular in Azarbaijan. He noted a “consistent demand” for agricultural and medical documentaries, citing among successful examples Pare Lorenz’s Power and the Land (1940) and the newsreel of the Potsdam Conference. The vice-­consul in Hamadan urged that educational documentaries with subjects close to ru‑ ral life be screened for the adult population instead of news films of national leaders who are “almost like fairies to the provincial, and their constant show‑ ing makes films in general seem unreal.” After requesting that his mobile film unit be repaired, the consul in Kermanshah reported that films on ag‑ ricultural, technical, medical, and textile themes were in particular demand. Likewise, the consul in Ahvaz, after reporting that citizens were “weary of war films,” suggested that technical and medical films be shown. Apparently, the film Surgery of Chest Diseases was in high demand in Ahvaz. On the other hand, the consul in Khorramshahr considered that educated people were too few in the city to justify showing any films other than entertainment movies.22 In cities where the Anglo-­Persian Institute operated, film screenings gen‑ erally took place in small theaters on the premises. To feed both the mobile and the stationary film circuits, the British Council imported a substantial number of movies. Young, the U.S. press attaché, who kept tabs on the British imports, reported that in one week in June 1945, Victory House had acquired thirty-­six films from Britain for its documentary circuit, “a typical week’s ac‑ 14\n\ni nt e r nat i o n a l ha g g li n g\n\nquisition.”23 The api’s film screenings aimed to cover all age groups and both sexes. In the Iranian year that fell on 1946–47, the api in Tehran screened forty-­seven “film shows,” with each show consisting of one to three films. It screened films on every Saturday, inside during the winter and outdoors in the garden or on the rooftop in the summer, with an average attendance of two hundred people. In summer, films for schoolchildren screened Friday mornings (the Iranian weekend), with “the house always full three quarters of an hour before the program began.” The institute’s “Ladies’ Section,” with 293 members, held regular tea parties, talks, musical recitals, and film shows during the year for women members only. Finally, in addition to these regular programs, the api held many specialized film screenings for professional au‑ diences throughout the year.24 Medical films such as Behind the Doctor (about the diagnosis of diphtheria) were screened by the api branch in Isfahan to forty physicians on the inaugural meeting of the Isfahan Medical Associa‑ tion.25 Most of the films were accompanied by explanatory talks delivered by live narrators in the dilmaj tradition. The screenings were also often followed by question-­and-­answer sessions with audiences.26 For the Iranian year that coincided with 1947–48, the api in Tehran held regular film and filmstrip screenings in its restaurant every Tuesday eve‑ ning accompanied by talks by well-­known British scholars.27 The Ladies’ Sec‑ tion saw two documentary films on water supply.28 “Children’s Holiday Film Shows” were held on Saturday mornings, when more than 250 “specially-­ selected” boys and girls with the average age of fifteen watched the following program on each occasion: one elementary biological film, one sports film, one “life in Britain” film, one scientific film, and one Mickey Mouse movie. In the summer of 1947, “Film Shows in the Garden” were held once a week for members and guests. The institute was creative in enriching and enlivening its educational and documentary fare with specially invited audiences or with invited guests and demonstrations. For example, in one week police films were shown to the Iranian chief of police and his entourage.29 In another week, the api screened The Great Game, on soccer, to a “specially-­invited au‑ dience of well-­known Tehran footballers,” preceded by a half-­hour talk on British soccer, translated into Persian. In April 1947, two sports films were shown; the first, on boxing, had a live demonstration by the welterweight and heavyweight boxing champions of Tehran who showed some of their tech‑ niques and “gave a couple of exhibition rounds.” The second film, on fencing, had a live demonstration by a Miss Tomblin on the techniques of the foil and saber.30 Although British Council film officers programmed the films (under J. H. i nter natio nal haggling\n\n15\n\nGrimes’s supervision) and organized the screening events in each location by providing speakers, guests, translators, and live film narrators, the officers of the Foreign Office Embassy Information Department operated the mo‑ bile vans and film projectors until 1950, when the bc absorbed the Informa‑ tion Department’s film unit. Until then, this linkage with the political arm of the embassy further tainted the chartered independence of the bc, which was already under question because the British government funded it and be‑ cause it enlisted some of the British Consul’s employees to act as its agents. The British film endeavor in Iran was more serious in tone, more education‑ ally oriented, and more diverse, and its nationwide reach was wider than the American or Soviet efforts. The British also exhibited much creativity in film presentation and audience preparation, and they took care to document their presentations and audience reactions, as film officers had to fill out film evalu­ ation forms (the above accounts were based on these evaluation reports). Also, unlike the official Soviet film efforts and the official American film effort through the usia, which did not survive the 1940s and the 1960s, respec‑ tively, the British Council’s film program continued to evolve and to serve Ira‑ nians until the revolution of 1978–79.\n\nThe Soviet Union’s Involvement: voks and Sovkino Soviet influence through cinema began as early as 1917, with the formation of the Farhang Club in Rasht, an offshoot of Tehran’s Farhang Scientific Com‑ pany. This was in addition to all the exchange relations that existed between Russia and Iran, through Russian nationals and Iranian Russians who im‑ ported films and film equipment to Iran, established movie houses, and had exhibited movies in the country since the beginning of cinema. Founded by Hosain Jowdat and led by the secretary of the Russian consulate, Karim Ke‑ shavarz, the Farhang Club received a monthly subsidy of forty tomans from the Russian legation. The club had a theater, a reading room, and a cinema, whose proceeds were used for welfare purposes. Iranian plays, such as Hasan Moqaddam’s Jafar Khan Is Back from Europe, as well as those by European au‑ thors such as Molière, Racine, Victor Hugo, and Ruy Blas were performed there. The Farhang Club also had a women’s offshoot, which staged plays for women whose performers were also, and unusually, women, such as Fatemeh Nashuri, Parirokh Vahdat, and Banu Khojastegi (Floor 2005:245–46). The club lasted until 1931, but it is not known what movies it screened. In 1941 the Soviet occupation authorities in Gilan Province sent a Caucasian troupe 16\n\ni nt e r nat i o n a l ha g g li n g\n\nto the city of Rasht, where Soraya Qajar, the manager of the Russian depart‑ ment store, rented the City Hall auditorium for plays and movies, the latter called East Cinema (279). Soviet cultural inroads were formalized after the Allied occupation. In the 1940s, the Soviet Union maintained branches of its worldwide All-­Union So‑ ciety for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries (voks; Vsesoiuznoe Ob‑ shchestvo Kul’turnoi Sviazi s Zagranitsei) in some sixty countries. In Iran it had one of the most extensive programs, with branches in key strategic cities: Tehran, Mashhad, Tabriz, Isfahan, Bandar Pahlavi, Kermanshah, and Ahvaz. Founded in 1925, voks was an arm of the Soviet public diplomacy, charged with “furthering the exchange of ideas and visits between the ussr and the capitalist countries” (F. F. 1954). In 1941 the Tabriz branch of voks organized a theatrical troupe of Iranians and Russians to perform plays, as did the Azari autonomous republic government (Ferqeh‑ye Demokrat), which staged plays in Azari and broadcast them on the radio (Floor 2005:278). voks organized its activities under various committees. Typical was the Cinema Committee, formed in 1944, to which some sixty directors, screen‑ writers, and actors belonged. This committee was “concerned with dissemi‑ nation of information abroad about Soviet films, exchange of ideas and expe‑ rience with foreign film organizations, and providing of material assistance to admirers of the Soviet cinema” (Nemzer 1949:273). According to a report by the Central Intelligence Agency, by 1948 the Soviet Union was exhibiting propaganda films and feature movies throughout Iran by means of its Teh‑ ran embassy, thirteen regional consulates, and several cultural organizations. Only the organizations concerned with films and film screenings as part of the country’s public diplomacy are discussed here. In Tehran, voks opened the House of Culture (Khaneh Farhang) in Jan‑ uary 1945, headed by Grigori Galishian and his assistant Sobhan Qaliov. Within a year the staff grew to twenty. Like the Iranian government’s Public Opinion Guidance Organization (pogo), voks had sections: science, medi‑ cine, sports, music, fine arts, theater, films, rural reconstruction, and indus‑ trial arts. These promoted different aspects of Soviet society. Each was super‑ vised by a Soviet national, and voks’s director in Iran was a member of the board of the Iran-­Soviet Cultural Relations Society, which was also a venue for Soviet film in Mashhad, Isfahan, Rasht, Tabriz, and Rezaiyeh (Urumi‑ yeh). The first director of Persian-­language talkies, Sepanta, served as the society’s secretary in Isfahan. The secretary to the Mashhad branch was the writer Shahid Nurai. The society’s Tabriz branch, established in August 1944, housed several halls for lectures and movie screenings. The fine arts commit‑ i nter natio nal haggling\n\n17\n\ntee incorporated many of the existing theatrical troupes to create a new per‑ forming arts venue called the Drama and Opera Performers’ Society, housed in the House of Culture (Haiat‑e Honarpishegan‑e Deram va Opret) (Ranjbar Fakhri 2004/1383:489).31 While the pogo aimed to centralize the Pahlavi stat‑ ist ideology of syncretic Westernization, the Iran-­Soviet Cultural Relations Society’s purpose was to inculcate a statist socialist ideology. Generally, lec‑ tures were held twice a week in two languages (apparently Persian and Az‑ ari), as well as concerts, art exhibitions (including photographs of the Soviet Union), and movie screenings. The Soviet society tapped into Azari nation‑ alism and autonomy, as it recognized Azari as a literary language, unlike the Iranian government, which stifled it, and it provided audio recordings, radio broadcasts, folksongs, poetry readings, and movies in European and Azari languages. These diverse offerings were apparently highly successful because they were among the rare sources of entertainment and enlightenment in the city, available free of charge, which invited local talents to participate and to shine (Abdollahzadeh 1984/1363:5). A film titled Soviet Propaganda Film—­Iran, Tabriz 1945–46, posted on You‑ Tube, documents many of the accomplishments of the Iran-­Soviet Cultural Relations Society in the Azari autonomous republic.32 Its Azari voice-­over ex‑ tols Azari nationalism and the educational and industrial progress achieved under the leadership of Jafar Pishehvari, who is shown in various social func‑ tions. The voice-­over justifies the continued Soviet occupation of Iran to “pro‑ tect Iran from foreigners.” The film shows the excitement about and contribu‑ tions of the population to building roads, schools, electrification, textile and shoe factories, and hospitals. Dancing, poetry, theater, and other forms of cul‑ ture are booming, and for the first time students are taught in their native Az‑ ari language. A teacher asks a female student to name three “beautiful words” that begin with the letter alif (a). Answer: ana (mother), Azarbaijan, and azadi (freedom). Many other short news films about Azari nationalism and the in‑ dependence movement are now posted on YouTube. The majority of the Iran-­Soviet Cultural Relations Society’s board of direc‑ tors in Tehran between 1945 and 1947 were either members of the Commu‑ nist (Tudeh) Party or were pro-­Soviet sympathizers and intellectuals, such as Said Naficy, Alavi, and Keshavarz.33 However, prominent cosmopolitan fig‑ ures like Naficy were members of both the Iran-­Soviet Cultural Relations So‑ ciety and the Iran-­America Relations Society. The Iran-­Soviet Cultural Re‑ lations Society in 1944 had ambitious goals for film: the dissemination of Soviet educational films; the making of documentaries about Iranian arts,\n\n18\n\ni nt e r nat i o n a l ha g g li n g\n\nscenery, and social life to publicize the country’s “greatness” abroad; facilitat‑ ing the insertion into Soviet movies of historical and literary items related to Iran; the training of Iranian film actors; and the creation of the foundations for a film industry in Iran (Tahaminejad 2004a:35). The engine of the Soviet Union’s film effort in Iran was Sovkino, the giant film distribution company, with representatives in Tehran and Tabriz, which imported Soviet films and distributed them throughout the country. The com‑ pany also supplied projectionists and equipment for film screenings that voks and the Iran-­Soviet Cultural Relations Society organized.34 Mobile film units also operated in zones occupied by Soviet forces in the northeast. Sovkino op‑ erated at least one commercial theater in Tehran, Setareh (Star) Cinema, and one in Rasht, Homay Cinema. A cia report notes that in addition to Mayak Cinema, in which the Soviet embassy had a 25 percent share, three to four other commercial movie houses in Tehran were “Soviet controlled,” and all screened Soviet movies.35 Soviet films were screened regularly in the commercial cinemas of Teh‑ ran and in those of large provincial cities (Mashhad, Ahvaz, Isfahan) and of small towns (Borujerd). In February of 1942 (Esfand 1321), one such movie house in the capital city, Tehran Cinema, showed Soviet newsreels to which the Soviet ambassador and the Soviet military attaché in Iran invited domestic and foreign diplomats and dignitaries. A review in the Siasat (Politics) news‑ paper, the official Tudeh Party organ, reported that the scenes of the defense of Moscow against the Nazis were so moving that they “affected the heart of every spectator.” When the Soviets finally took back their cities from the en‑ emy, “the sound of spectator applause echoed throughout the hall” (quoted in Tahaminejad 2004a:30). In April 1943, Iran Cinema showed a documentary about Iran, which the Soviet Union’s press attaché in Tehran had organized, an event that was attended by the prime minister, the leader of the parlia‑ ment, the court minister, and other dignitaries and members of the press. Af‑ ter official speeches in Russian and Persian and the screening of a short film about the battle of Stalingrad (perhaps the same one as that shown at Tehran Cinema), the film about Iran was shown. Directed by Iosif Poselski, the film, which Ettela’at Haftegi (Weekly Information) called Manazer‑e Iran (Views of Iran, 1941) had been shot during the Second World War, and it showed not only the country’s natural scenery but also its historical monuments, its ar‑ tistic achievements, and scenes from modern cities (Tehran, Mashhad, Shi‑ raz, Isfahan) with their new educational, cultural, sports, and public health centers and modern avenues and palaces, including those of the Shah and\n\ni nter natio nal haggling\n\n19\n\nhis family. The film bore a soundtrack containing Persian music, Persian-­ language narration, and poems by Ferdowsi, Hafez, and Sadi. Apparently, the Soviets had presented a print of the film to the Shah, who had put it at the dis‑ posal of Iran Cinema, instructing its owner to use the proceeds for aid to the blind (Tahaminejad 2004a:32). Finally, Iran and Mayak Cinemas in Tehran screened a propaganda movie known as Oath (Sowgand), which was praised by the pro-­Soviet Iranian press as emblematic of the socialist victory, whereby a great industrial city is constructed out of nothing by “labor, effort, unity, and faith” (Tahaminejad 2004a:32). In Isfahan, the Soviet consulate invited the town’s dignitaries to a screening in Mayak Cinema of sports documenta‑ ries and a feature film called Republic of Uzbekistan (Jomhuri‑ye Ozbakestan). To accommodate various classes of audiences, Soviet movies were shown by invitation, free of charge or at a discount. The social realism of the movies, screened with Persian or Turkish subtitles, provided a contrast to the gritty realism of Hollywood crime and gangster movies, which were popular. If the American practice of importing morally suspect fiction films, such as gang‑ ster movies, and educationally valuable documentaries on health and devel‑ opment seemed contradictory and perplexing to Iranian jurists, Sovkino’s im‑ portation of movies into Iran appeared consistent and carefully calibrated to Iranian taste. It included not only war movies but also movies about the noble society of patriots, Central Asian fairy tales, or innocent scenes of forest and deep-­sea life (Cook 1949:408–9). These movies were widely available, chiefly because they were screened free of charge (at least in the Soviet zone of in‑ fluence in the northwest), while admittance was charged for Western movies (McFarland 1981:201). Despite their wide availability and the pro-­Soviet exhib‑ itors’ strategies to attract viewers, Soviet movies were apparently not as well attended as U.S.-­made movies due to their “lack of entertainment value.”36 It appears that despite, or perhaps because of, its internal contradictions, Ameri‑ can public diplomacy proved more effective in winning the hearts and minds of Iranians than the homogeneous Soviet public diplomacy. Iranian nationalism, which rose under the Pahlavis, may also have diluted interest in Soviet movies, particularly after the end of the Second World War, when the Soviet Union illegally occupied Iran. An anonymous eyewitness de‑ scribes a scene that demonstrates this popular unease with Soviet cultural in‑ roads at this time: The Soviets had taken over Homay Cinema in Rasht and re‑ named it Sharq (East) Cinema, where they presented performances imported from Leningrad and Azerbaijan, as well as Soviet war and propaganda mov‑ ies. One night, the National Musical Society under the leadership of Ruhollah Khaleqi was to perform at the Sharq, where a crowd had gathered. Uncontrol‑ 20\n\ni nt e r nat i o n a l ha g g li n g\n\nlable joy met Khaleqi’s decision to perform for the first time the national‑ istic chorale known as “O Bejeweled Land” (“Ey Marz‑e Porgohar”), which would become the popular national anthem for Iranians, countering the official “King of Kings Anthem.” “The audience was thunderstruck in their seats, listening with amazement and astonishment to the exciting rhythm and the provocative lyrics of this chorale.” When it was over, the spectators gave the troupe a standing ovation, requesting encores, kissing and hugging the per‑ formers; and one wealthy patron threw a wad of paper money onto the stage. To the reporter, the contrast between the hall’s usual fare—­“only, and only, Soviet propaganda and war movies, full of blood and fire, which only spread death and mourning”—­and that night’s performance, which “turned the hall into an expansive garden of light and delight,” was astonishing.37 After the defeat of the Azari autonomy movement and the expulsion of So‑ viet forces, leftist and Soviet cultural centers suffered attacks. The leftist press reported that government forces, “gendarmes, knife-­wielders, and toughs sent by Tehran” attacked the city of Zanjan, killing people and robbing the dead of their goods, even of their gold teeth. They also destroyed property, including Azar Cinema, which had been constructed by the Democratic Government of Azarbaijan under Jafar Pishehvari (jami 1976/1355:405–6). The destruc‑ tion in Tabriz, the seat of the independence movement’s government, was worse. A local newspaper there, Vazifeh (Duty), referred to Western newsreels about Nazi atrocities shown in Iranian movie houses to create a vivid paral‑ lel image of the destruction of Tabriz and the maltreatment of its citizens by government forces (474). This reference shows the powerful impressions that wartime newsreels had left on Iranians, providing a visual vocabulary to be invoked for domestic situations. Communism was popular among the intelligentsia disaffected with capi‑ talism and with the Shah. The release of the notorious Group-­53, consisting of fifty-­t hree communists and intellectuals, led to the formation of the Tudeh (Mass) Party in 1941, perhaps the most intellectually exciting and socially powerful political party. And it was under the sponsorship of the Iran-­Soviet Cultural Relations Society that the first Congress of Iranian Writers took place in Tehran in 1946, featuring a who’s who of writers. However, the edu‑ cated class was small, as borne out by the U.S. State Department’s estimate that 85 to 90 percent of Iran’s population of 15 million was illiterate.38 Un‑ like the American and British cultural efforts, which were designed to reach both the Iranian masses and the elites, ironically, those of the Soviet Union, which championed the world’s toiling masses, seemed to have been either directed primarily at the intelligentsia or they managed to primarily attract i nter natio nal haggling\n\n21\n\nthem, for the Soviet Union’s success was “greatest among school teachers, col‑ lege students, and young writers.”39 Ervand Abrahamian’s figures corroborate the heavy representation of these strata in the Tudeh Party (1982:330–31). The names of the writers who were either members or sympathizers constitute a who’s who of postwar modern literature and poetry: Mahmud Afrashteh, Jalal Al‑e Ahmad, Ahmad Aram, Taqi Arani, Malek al-­Shoara Bahar, Sadeq Chu‑ bak, Mahmud Etemadzadeh (Behazin), Ebrahim Golestan, Fakhreddin Gor‑ gani, Sadeq Hedayat, Mahmud Javaheri, Morteza Keyvan, Loretta (Varto Tar‑ ian), Khalil Maleki, Naqi Milani, Mohammad Moin, Nader Naderpour, Said Naficy, Abdolhosain Nushin, Rasul Parvizi, Ahmad Shamlu, Mohammad Ta‑ fazzoli, Feraidun Tavalloli, and Nima Yushij (Ali Esfandiari). Several were involved in theater, such as Nushin and Loretta, and at least one, Golestan, later became a prominent new-­wave and documentary filmmaker (Golestan resigned from the party in the late 1940s, along with Khalil Maleki and Al‑e Ahmad). In addition, many Tudeh members went to the movies frequently. The par‑ ty’s success with the urban working classes and workers’ unions also gave it unprecedented political muscle, with the strong participation of Azari and Christians. Of the twelve members of the executive committee of the Union of Cinema Attendants in 1944–46, for example, three were Christians (Abra‑ hamian 1982:336). Before the Tudeh Party was officially banned, members hung out openly at modernist cafés with other members of the intelligentsia and attended movie houses frequently. For example, Morteza Keyvan, an ac‑ tive party member and a gifted writer, in letters to his friend Mostafa Far‑ zaneh in Paris, states that he went to the movies perhaps once or twice a month for relaxation. This was during the two years of his political activism, both clandestine and open, on behalf of the party, which ultimately led to his execution (Farzaneh 2005/1384:102, 104, 109, 118). Nighttime work for the party even interfered with his moviegoing. In a letter to the filmmaker Fe­ raidun Rahnema in Paris, he laments his having missed Orson Welles’s Mac‑ beth (1948) due to “work” every night that the film was on (“You will curse me for having missed it”), but he gives the good news of planning to see Welles’s The Stranger (1946) that night, if “work” does not interfere again. It appears that most of the films he wished to see were highbrow Western movies, some of which he saw in the original language in a Tehran cinema club (Keyvan 2003/1982:232–33). He also went to popular films, such as John Farrows’s The Night Has a Thousand Eyes (1948) but was critical of it. He states that “the film does not have much except great music and some superb mise-­en-­scène,” but\n\n22\n\ni nt e r nat i o n a l ha g g li n g\n\nthat Edward G. Robinson’s “remarkable” acting “is truly watchable” (Keyvan 2003/1982:259). The darkness and anonymity of movie houses continued to make these es‑ tablishments conducive to meetings of the political opposition, particularly Tudeh members and other leftists. Alavi’s sister, for example, reports that she used to drop off packages of books at the Mayak Cinema box office in Tehran to be delivered to her brother, who was in prison as a member of the Group­53 (Alavi’s own account in his novel Her Eyes of using movie houses for left‑ ist gatherings is probably autobiographical) (Alavi 2004/1383:43). At the same time, the Tudeh Party used the auditorium of the Mayak Cinema for less clan‑ destine purposes, like official celebrations. One example was the graduation party for women who had passed literary night classes in 1946 (72). These uses show the integration of movie houses into leftist political and cultural activities. One Tudeh sympathizer drawn to Marxism through cinema and Soviet cultural activities was Bijan Jazani, who in the 1960s would ironically be‑ come both a capitalist filmmaker, making advertising films, and a leader of the Marxist underground guerrillas, Fadaiyan‑e Khalq‑e Iran (People’s Fadai‑ yan of Iran, pfoi). As his wife, Mihan Jazani, tells it, in his youth Bijan was very knowledgeable and "
