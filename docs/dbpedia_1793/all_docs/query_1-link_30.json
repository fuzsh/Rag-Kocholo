        "text": "APPENDIX (E).\n\nObservations by Major [afterwards Sir Henry) Rawlinson on a Persian Memorandum\n\nRelative to the Situation oj the Cities of Mohammerah and Feitahiah.\n\n[Enclosed in Sir Stratford Canning's despatch No. 155 of the 18th July, 1844.]\n\nObservations.\n\nPersian Memorandum.*\n\nFrom the point of confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates\n\nat Korna, the river flows in a general direction of south\n\neast to Bussorah; it is subject to few windings, and the\n\ndistance has been fixed by survey at 38 miles.\n\nIf the title of Ears is here used in its general application\n\nto the province of that name the description is altogether\n\nincorrect, not a single rivulet that rises within the frontiers\n\nof the said province finding its way to the Shat-el-Arab.\n\nThe expression may, however, have a general reference to\n\nthe Persian territory; and even then, the assertion that all\n\nrivers rising within that territory disembogue, like the\n\nKarun, into the Shatt-el-Arab, will require to be greatly\n\nmodified—the fact is that the Kai-un itself does not dis\n\nembogue into the Shatt-el-Arab, the main body of the river\n\nfinds its way by a separate channel (the Bamishere) to the\n\nsea, and is merely connected with the Shat-el-Arab by the\n\nartificial cut of the Hafar, on the right bank of which is\n\nsituated the town of Mohammerah. Independently of this\n\nHafar canal there is only one other stream which joins the\n\nShatt. el-Arab between Korna and the sea and ttiat is the\n\nSoweib, which carries off the superfluous waters of the great\n\nIbur of Howeizeh, a huge marshy lake, in which the river\n\nChoaspes or Kerkha and the minor streams of the Tib and\n\nDowairej exhaust themselves, and which is also fed from\n\nthe Tigris through the channel of the Had.\n\nThere is much confusion in this description. The Bakh-\n\ntiari rivers descending to the south-west from the culmina\n\nting ridges of Aosteran Koh, Miyaneh Koh, Zardeh Koh,\n\nand Mungusht fall into three distinct channels. The Dizful\n\nriver to the west, the Karun in the centre, and the Tab or\n\nJerrahi to the east. The waters of the Eeili mountains on\n\nthe contrary flow on the one side into the Kerkha and form\n\non the other side the petty streams of the Gangir, the Abi-\n\nJestan, the Teb, and the Dowairij, which are lost in the\n\nmarshy plains of Settacene. The streams of Koh Griluyeh\n\nunite and fall into the sea at Hindiyan. The river of\n\nShuster is the Kerkha itself, and that of Bizful joins the\n\nformer at Bandi-Kir, while the river of Bebahan, or which\n\nflows near Bebahan, is the main stream of the Tab or\n\nJerralii. The general direction of these streams is south\n\nwest, and the only channels by which any part of their\n\nwaters join the Shatt-el-Arab are the Soweib and Hafar.\n\nIt is begging the question altogether to lay it down as an\n\naxiom that the Shal t-el-Arab is the boundary between Persia\n\nand Turkey. Sultan Murad's treaty expressly names\n\nBussorah as the Turkish limit, and under this head includes\n\nof course the acknowledged dependencies of the city which\n\nhave always been the lands on either side of the Shatt-el-\n\nArab watered by that river. The claim of Persia to Mo\n\nhammerah consists in the latter city being on the ITafar,\n\nwhich is now a continuation of the Karun, and not on the\n\nShatt-el-Arab, but until the present year Persia has never\n\nreceived Maliyat or revenue from Mohommerah.\n\nThe measured distance between Bussorah and Mohammerah\n\nby the river, which has few sinuosities, is 25 miles, and a\n\nMOHAMMERAH is situated to the east of the\n\nShatt-el-Arab, which is formed by the junction of\n\nthe Tigris and Euphrates at a village named\n\nKorna, distant 10 farsangs from Bussorah.\n\nAll the rivers, great as well as small, on the\n\nconfines of Fars, flow into the Shatt-el-Arab, which\n\ncontinues its course till it disembogues into the\n\nPersian Gulf The historical term used to describe the body of water between the Arabian Peninsula and Iran. . The Karun is one of the streams\n\nwhich thus unites with the Shatt el-Arab, the\n\nlatter river passing Bussorah and forming, on the\n\nwest, the boundary of Nejd and Arabistan.\n\nThe right of Turkey to the ports which are\n\nsituated on the western bank of the river is not\n\ncontested, but those to the east of the Shatt-el-\n\nArab, which forms the boundary of Fars, depend\n\nupon that province.\n\nAll the rivers, great as well as small, which rise\n\nupon the borders of Fars, traverse the territory of\n\nthe Bakhtiaris, of the Fili Lurs, of Karoua (?), of\n\nKoh Giluyeh, of Shuster, of Dizful, and of Beba\n\nhan, and flowing towards the east (\"vers rorient\")\n\ndisembogue into the Shatt-el-Arab and thence into\n\nthe Persian Gulf The historical term used to describe the body of water between the Arabian Peninsula and Iran. , the western shore of which is\n\nformed by Arabistan and Nejd. The Gulf and\n\nthe above-mentioned river divide the two conti\n\nnents, and Mohammerah becomes in consequence a\n\npart of the territory of Fars, to which province\n\naccordingly it has always paid its revenue. The\n\ndistance between the latter city and Bussorah is\n\n4 farsangs by land, by water the interval may be\n\ntraversed in an hour. The port of Mohammerah is\n\nsituated on the banks of the Karun, a river which\n\nin its descent from Shuster becomes first a con-\n\n* Communicated to the Foreign Office by Colonel Sheil, Iler Majesty's Minister at Tehran, in his despatch\n\nNo. 41, April 16, 1844.\n\n[2440 c—10] Q"
