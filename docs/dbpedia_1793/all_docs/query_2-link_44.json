        "text": "This groundbreaking study from 1956 identified some 125 Islamic astronomical handbooks with tables and explanatory text prepared in Muslim lands between 750 and 1900. Before this publication two such works, called zij, zijes, (زيج ، ازياج , zîj, azyâj) in Arabic, were known, namely those of al-Khwarizmi (Indian tradition) & al-Battani (Greek tradition). Both of these, by historical accident, were known in al-Andalus and were the only zîjes to become known in medieval Europe . The number of zîjes now known is closer to 225 and these, together with countless other tables not contained in zîjes have confirmed Kennedy's impression that one of the most impressive achievements of the Muslim astronomers was the compilation of tables for all sorts of purposes. An interim report on all of these tables was published in 2001 in D. A. King & J. Samsó & B. R. Goldstein, ”Astronomical tables and handbooks from the Islamic world (750-1900)” in the journal Suhayl (www.academia.edu/34693241/). A new survey of all zîjes by Dr. Benno van Dalen of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences is nearing completion: see www.badw.academia.edu/BennovanDalen and www.bennovandalen.de/Research/research.html."
