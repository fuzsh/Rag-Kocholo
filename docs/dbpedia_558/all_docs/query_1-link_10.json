Mic Sokoli comes from a family of patriots. Led large fighting units of the League in many battles. He was noted for strategy, readiness and bravery. He took an active part in the battles in Skopje, Prizren, Ferizaj, Gjilan, Gjakovë against Mehmet Ali Pasha, distinguished himself in the battle of Nokšić against the Montenegrin aggressors, fought in Plavë e Gucia, Hot, Grudë, Tuz. Then in the Plain of Kosovo in the great battle of Shtime, Carraleva and recently in that of Slivova where he also fell heroically. At the battle of Slivova near Shtime, in (April 1881) against the Ottoman forces of Dervish Pasha, he performed a rare act of bravery, placing his chest on an enemy cannon and fell heroically on the battlefield, inspiring all other warriors to continue fight with courage and pride. Mici died heroically at the age of 42, leaving behind his wife and two children - a son and a daughter. More than a century later, one of his grandsons continued where Mici left off - where the Albanian League left off. He had inherited from Mici's genes bravery and military prowess. The grandson of Mic Sokol, he was martyred fighting for national unity and his name is Tahir Sinani. Many events and fighters of the Era of the Albanian League of Prizren were immortalized through the historical epic, but the first place is occupied by Mic Sokoli, the chief of Krasniqe, the son of Sokol Rama from Malësia e Madhe. Mic's unparalleled heroism became legend, and songs about him echoed down the years, reaching us. /KosovaPress/",
