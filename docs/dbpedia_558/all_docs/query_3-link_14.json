        "text": "Introduction\n\nRenal dysfunction remains a global issue of the twenty-first century, which can be caused by several kidney disorders. Among them, chronic kidney disease (CKD) is the most common renal disorder, characterized by great prevalence in the adult population [1–5]. To date, more than 697.5 million CKD cases (of all stages) have been reported worldwide [1–9]. A tremendous increase (29.3%) of CKD new cases, has been reported from 1990 to 2017, while at the same time the global all age mortality raised to 41.5% [10, 11]. Based on World Health Organization (WHO), it has been estimated that 5–10 million people died annually due to kidney disorders [12]. To extend the life span of patients suffering from CKD and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), dialysis (peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis) or renal transplantation compromise the gold standard care of treatment [13–15]. From an economical point of view, the treatment of kidney disease in developed countries can exceed 2–5% of the annual national health care budget [16]. Also, private medical services can offer advanced treatment options for patients with kidney disease. However, only a small number of patients can afford the high medical costs of private services, indicating that a great number of people will not receive the appropriate treatment and eventually will die from kidney disease complications [17–19]. Renal transplantation can affect positively the long-term survival of the patients, which may improve significantly the patients' quality of life. Successful renal transplantation may cost less than a 5-year dialysis treatment [20–22]. On the other hand, due to the increasing number of patients with CKD, the median wait time for a suitable transplant is 3.6 years [23–25]. Based on the National Kidney Foundation, in the United States of America (U.S.A.) on average 121.700 people have been deposited in organ transplant lists, and more than 100.000 are waiting for compatible kidney transplants [25].\n\nIn the context of organ transplantation, novel tissue engineering approaches can be used, which eventually will lead to in vitro development of organs. In this way, kidney transplants could be efficiently produced using state-of-the-art methods, such as decellularization and bioprinting [26, 27]. Indeed, bioprinting compromises a novel method of the twenty-first century, that theoretically could result in successful organ production [26–29]. However, the proper development of highly organized structures, such as complete organs, with functional properties, requires still more research [30, 31]. Indeed, in the case of kidney, which is characterized by several different components, the bioprinting method may be unsuitable. On the other hand, decellularization has been proposed over a decade as a novel approach for producing tissues and organs [32, 33]. Decellularization aims to the elimination of the cellular populations, while the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the organ remains intact. [32, 33]. Then, the produced acellular scaffold can serve as a suitable matrix for cell homing, proliferation and differentiation. This in turn could result in the development of functional organs in vitro, attenuating in this way the organ transplantation issue.\n\nKidney is characterized by a complicated structure, where the nephron is the basic structural and functional unit. Human kidneys are consisting of 1–1.5 million nephrons, which include the Bowman’s capsule, descending tubule, the loop of Henle, ascending tubule, and collection ducts [34, 35]. Blood is filtered as it passed through these components, therefore their preservation (without the presence of cells) after the application of the decellularization procedure is highly important [34, 35]. In the past, several research teams have tried to develop acellular kidney scaffolds, using different decellularization approaches, however, the results arising from these studies are still controversial [36–40]. Variations in the results could be due to the utilization of different decellularization solutions (ionic vs nonionic) and approaches (dynamic vs bioreactor settings), therefore more research is required towards this field [34, 35]. Moreover, adequate preservation of kidney’s ECM is related to proper cell adhesion, growth, and differentiation, key properties which are required for the production of functional kidney transplants [39]. Until now, perfusion decellularization, utilizing the renal artery for the delivery of the decellularization solutions in the kidney matrix, is the most used method for the production of acellular whole kidney scaffolds [40–42]. In this way, using the vascular network of the kidney, the decellularization solutions can efficiently reach all organ’s components, ensuring the elimination of the resident cells. However, perfusion decellularization method is requiring advanced and high-cost equipment (bioreactor), while the canulation of the renal artery and in general the whole decellularization process must be performed by experienced personnel. Although the broad use of the above method to develop whole kidney scaffolds, it has been reported in literature extended ECM and capillary network damage, which can induce unfavorable results regarding the repopulation efficiency [43, 44]. For this purpose, alternative decellularization strategies are of major importance to be evaluated. Based on our previous experience, we have used cost-effective approaches for the successful decellularization of a great number of different organs, such as human umbilical artery, porcine aorta, rat trachea and esophagus [45–48]. The above organs were decellularized effectively, using general equipment and devices such as the rotary shaker or the magnetic stirrer. In this way, the aim of the current study was the validation of two different cost-effective strategies for whole rat kidney decellularization, to produce a properly defined bioscaffold. Specifically, the first approach utilized the cyclic force to decellularize effectively the rat kidney, therefore a rotary shaker device was used. The second approach involved the decellularization of whole rat kidney, using a magnetic stirrer. The physical and mechanical differences between the two decellularization strategies, may have variable impact on the kidney matrix. Therefore, an analytic evaluation of the acellular kidney matrix, produced from both approaches, including histological analysis, biochemical and DNA quantification, cytotoxicity assessment, was performed. In this study, rat kidneys were selected for the evaluation of the proposed decellularization strategies. Rat kidney is characterized by similar morphology as the human, therefore can compromise an ideal model, to study various tissue engineering applications. To validate the functionality of the produced kidney scaffolds, recellularization of the acellular scaffolds using human mesenchymal stromal cells (ΜSCs) was performed. The obtained results could reveal significant information regarding kidney decellularization, which may effectively be used in large scale experimental procedures, including kidneys derived from large animal models or cadaveric donors.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nPreparation of rat kidneys\n\nKidneys were harvested under aseptic conditions from female Wistar rats (n = 50), weighing 300–350 gr. The animals were provided by the laboratory animal facility of the Biomedical Research Foundation Academy of Athens (BRFAA). Care and handling of the animals were performed according to the international guidelines of animal care, which are conformed with the Helsinki declaration. Furthermore, the whole study has been approved by the Bioethics Committee of BRFAA (ref 25–2019). Obtained kidneys, immediately after their harvest from the animals, were placed in 50 ml falcon tube with Phosphate Buffer Saline 1x (PBS 1x, Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany), until the initiation of the decellularization procedure. The total storage time of kidneys did not exceed 2 h.\n\nDecellularization procedure of rat kidneys\n\nIn this study, two different decellularization approaches in whole rat kidneys (n = 30) were evaluated. The first approach involved the incubation of whole rat kidneys (n = 15) with the decellularization buffers (based on the following protocol) under cyclic rotation. For this purpose, a rotary shaker was used, and this method will be referred from now on, as the rotary shaker approach. The second approach involved the incubation of whole rat kidneys (n = 15) with the decellularization solutions using a device composed of a 100 ml glass beaker and a magnetic stirrer. The agitation of whole rat kidneys was performed at 250 rpm, and this method will be referred as the magnetic stirrer approach.\n\nThe decellularization protocol used in both approaches was the same and involved the following steps. Initially, the incubation of rat kidneys in CHAPS buffer, pH: 7 (8 mM CHAPS, 1 M NaCl and 25 mM EDTA, in PBS 1x, Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany) for 12 h at room temperature. The second step involved the incubation of rat kidneys in SDS buffer, pH:7 (1.8 mM SDS, 1 M NaCl and 25 mM EDTA, in PBS 1x, Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany) for additional 12 h at room temperature. Finally, the rat kidneys were placed in α-minimum essentials medium (α-ΜΕΜ, Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany) supplemented with 40% v/v Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS, Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany) for 12 h at 37 °C. Briefly wash of whole rat kidneys with PBS 1x, was performed after the use of each decellularization solution. The above protocol was repeated for 2 more cycles (5 whole rat kidneys/cycle).\n\nHistological analysis\n\nNon-decellularizaed (n = 5) and decellularized (n = 5/cycle) whole rat kidneys obtained after the 1st, 2nd and 3rd cycle from the rotary shaker (n = 15) and magnetic stirrer (n = 15) approaches, were fixed overnight in 10% v/v neutral formalin buffer (Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany). The next step involved the dehydration of all samples, embedding in paraffin and final sectioning at 5 μm. To proper validate the impact of the two decellularization approaches regarding the kidney’s ECM, histological analysis using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E, VWR, Avantor, Radnor, PA, USA), sirius red (SR, VWR, Avantor, Radnor, PA, USA) and alcian blue (AB, Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany), were performed. For this purpose, the sections of each sample were deparaffinized, rehydrated, stained and mounted. Finally, representative images of whole rat kidneys were acquired with Leica DM L2 light microscope (Leica Microsystems, Weltzar, Germany) and processed with Image J v.1.46 (Wane Rasband, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, USA).\n\nIn addition, indirect immunofluorescence (IF) was performed in non decellularized and decellularized kidney samples obtained from both approaches. Briefly, the sections of each sample were deparaffinized, rehydrated and incubated and blocked. Then incubation with the primary monoclonal antibody against fibronectin (1:1000, Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany) was performed. After this step, brief washes of the sections, followed by the incubation of the FITC -conjugated IgG secondary antibody (1:80, Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany), were performed. Finally, the DAPI stain was added, and all samples, were dehydrated and glycerin mounted. The samples were observed under the LEICA SP5 II confocal microscope and the images were acquired using the LAS Suite v2 software (Leica Microsystems).\n\nPore size measurement\n\nDetermination of pore size in non decellularized and decellularized whole rat kidneys were performed, using the Image J v.1.46 (Wane Rasband, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). Briefly, the pore size measurement of all samples, was performed in the sections stained with H&E. Τhe pore size was determined using 5 different visual fields per sample. The pore size measurement was performed manually, by two different independent observers, to ensure the accuracy of the results. Non decellularized whole rat kidneys were used as the control group. Also, 3D isosurface of non decellularized and decellularized whole rat kidneys were developed using the plugin “Interactive 3D Surface Plot” of Image J v.1.46.\n\nBiochemical analysis and DNA quantification\n\nBiochemical analysis and DNA quantification were performed in non decellularized (n = 5) and decellularized (n = 5/cycle) samples obtained from both approaches (n = 30). Specifically, for collagen quantification, representable kidney samples were digested in 125 μg/ml papain buffer (Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany) at 60 °C for 12 h. Collagen content in all samples was quantified using the hydroxyproline assay kit (MAK008, Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany) followed the manufacturer’s instructions.\n\nFor the quantification of sulfated glycosaminoglycans (sGAGs), representable kidney tissues (native, n = 5, decellularized, n = 15/approach) were digested using 1 ml of lysis buffer, consisted of 0.1 M Tris pH:8, 0.2 M NaCl and 5 mM EDTA in PBS 1x (Sigma Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany), and 25 mg/ml proteinase K (Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany) at 56 °C for 12 h. Then, inactivation of proteinase K was performed by incubation of samples at 96 °C for 5 min. SGAGs were photometrically measured at 525 nm with the use of 1% w/v dimethylene blue (Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany). The sGAG concentration of each sample was obtained through interpolation to a standard curve. The standard curve was developed based on chondroitin sulphate standards of 3, 6, 12, 25, 50, 10 and 150 μg/ml.\n\nFinally, the DNA content was spectrophotometrically measured in each sample at 260–280 nm. Briefly, after kidneys lysis with the lysis buffer contained the proteinase K, the DNA of each sample was properly isolated, and eluted in 50 μl of RNA-se free water. Then, spectrophotometrically DNA quantification, using the Nanodrop device (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was applied. Further verification of the DNA quantification results was performed, using DNA electrophoresis on 1% w/v agarose gel. Images were acquired and processed with UVITEC Imaging System (Cleaver scientific, Warwickshire, UK).\n\nCytotoxicity assay\n\nTo determine the cytotoxicity of decellularized whole rat kidneys obtained from both approaches, cell contact and tissue extract cytotoxicity assays, were performed. For the contact cytotoxicity assay, decellularized kidney samples from both approaches (n = 18), were placed in 6 well plates (Orange Scientific, Braine-l’Alleud, Belgium). Then, 1 × 105 Wharton’s Jelly (WJ) Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) of passage 3 (P3) were added in each well, followed by incubation at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 72 h. Native rat kidney tissue (n = 3) seeded with 1 × 105 WJ-MSCs P3 was served as the negative control, while WJ-MSCs P3 with 1.5 mM SDS (Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany) served as the positive control. To observe better the cell morphology, Giemsa stain was applied. More specifically, all samples were washed with PBS 1x and fixed in 10% v/v neutral buffer formalin for 10 min. Then, 1 ml of complete Giemsa stain was added to each well and remained for 5 min. Extended washes with distilled water, were performed and finally the 6-well plates were air-dried.\n\nThe performance of tissue extract cytotoxicity assay required the initial digestion of non decellularized (n = 3) and decellularized kidneys (n = 18) from both approaches. Specifically, representable segments of each sample were digested with 25 μg/ml proteinase k in PBS 1x (Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany), at 56 °C, overnight. The volume of the buffer contained the proteinase K was 1 ml. The next day, heat inactivation of the samples contained the proteinase K, was performed at 96 °C, for 5 min. Then, the total volume of tissue extracts (1 ml), was supplemented in α-MEM, and used as the culture medium for WJ-MSCs. WJ-MSCs P3 at a density of 1 × 105 cells, were seeded and cultivated in the presence of tissue extracts for a time period of 72 h. WJ-MSCs P3 cultivated with the regular culture medium were served as the negative control group, while WJ-MSCs P3 cultivated in the presence of 1.5 mM SDS, were served as the positive control group. The WJ-MSCs P3 were isolated, cultured and expanded as has been described previously by our group [45]. The regular culture medium consisted of α-ΜΕΜ supplemented with 15% v/v fetal bovine serum (FBS), 10 U/ml Penicillin (Gibco), 10 mg/ml Streptomycin (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco). Finally, Giemsa stain, in the same way as previously described, was used to validate better the cell morphology. Images were acquired with light microscope DM L2 (Leica Microsystems) and processed with Image J v1.46 (Wane Rasband, National Institutes of Health).\n\nRepopulation of decellularized whole rat kidneys\n\nAfter the performance of the above procedures, a comprehensive evaluation of the decellularization procedures in rat kidneys was performed by two independent observers. Based on the results of the above analysis, we selected only the decellularized kidneys after the 2nd cycle, obtained from both approaches, for the recellularization experiments. The kidneys used for the repopulation assay, were obtained from female Wistar Rats, weighing 300–350 gr, while the WJ-MSCs P3 were derived from male donors. Decellularized rat kidneys (n = 5/approach) were seeded with human WJ-MSCs P3. WJ-MSCs used in this study, were expanded and prepared based on the previous published protocol from our group [49]. Quality assessment of WJ-MSCs, based on the minimum criteria of MSCs Committee of International Society for Cellular Therapies (ISCT), was performed before the seeding experiments. Dynamic cell seeding of WJ-MSCs in decellularized rat kidneys, was selected as the best recellularization approach. Specifically, 5 × 106 WJ-MSCs P3 were placed with decellularized whole rat kidney in a 50 ml conical falcon tubes, contained 20 ml of the regular culture medium. Then, the 50 ml falcon tube contained the WJ-MSCs P3 and decellularized whole rat kidneys, were placed in a thermal shaker for 4 h at 37 °C and agitated at 210 rpm. Finally, the falcon tubes with the seeded rat kidneys were placed in a sterile incubator, at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 30 days.\n\nHistological analysis of repopulated kidneys\n\nHistological analysis was performed, to evaluate the successful recellularization of the rat kidneys. For this purpose, H&E staining and immunohistochemistry (IHC) against collagen IV, were performed. Briefly, recellularized rat kidneys (n = 5/ approach) were fixed overnight in 10% neutral formalin buffer, dehydrated, paraffin-embedded and sectioned at 5 μm. Before, the histological stains, the sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, stained and mounted. The EnVision FLEX Mini kit, high pH (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) was used for the immunohistochemistry, based on the manufacturer’s instructions. Initially, the endogenous peroxidase was blocked and then, the sections were incubated with the antibody against collagen type IV (1:500, ABT123, Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany) for 2 h. Briefly washes were performed to all samples, followed by the addition of mouse secondary IgG antibody. The sections were incubated for 1 h. Then, briefly washes were repeated, and DAB solution was added to the samples. The sections were counterstained with Harris hematoxylin (Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany), and finally were dehydrated and mounted. The stained samples were observed in Leica DM LS2 microscope (Leica, Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). The images were acquired with IC Capture v 2.4 software (Imaging source, Bremen, Germany).\n\nTo further validate the human origin of cells seeded in the kidney scaffolds, immunofluorescence against Human Nuclear Antigen (HuNu), was performed. Specifically, the slides were deparafinized, rehydrated and blocked. Then, incubation with anti-HuNu (1:1000, ab191181, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) was performed for 2 h. Then, briefly washes were performed. Incubation with IgG-conjugated Alexa-Fluor 647 (1:50, ab150115, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) for 1 h was followed. Also, incubation with Collagen type IV (1:500, ABT123, Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany) for 2 h, was performed at the same slides. Briefly washes were performed to all samples. Then, incubation with secondary IgG-FITC conjugated (1:50, Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany) was performed for 1 h, followed by brief washes. The slides were dehydrated and glycerin mounted. Finally, the slides were observed under the LEICA SP5 II confocal microscope and the images were acquired using the LAS Suite v2 software (Leica Microsystems).\n\nEvaluation of kidney repopulation efficiency\n\nThe evaluation of repopulation efficiency involved the cell nuclei counting in histological images (stained with H&E) of all samples. The cell nuclei counting was performed, using the Image J v.1.46 (Wane Rasband, National Institute of Health) software. More specifically, all images were converted to 8 bit, followed by an adjustment in threshold, in order the cell nuclei to be visibly black. Then, these dark particles, which were corresponded to cell nuclei, were analyzed with the tool “Analyze Particles”.\n\nDNA evaluation of all samples (native, n = 5, decellularized, n = 5, recellularized, n = 10) was performed, as has been referred in the previous section. Briefly, each sample was digested using a lysis solution contained 25 mg/ml proteinase K (Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany), and finally, the DNA was eluted in 50 μl of RNA-se free water. The DNA was quantified by spectrophotometric measurement at 260/280 nm, using the Nanodrop device (Thermo Fischer Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Finally, the cell nuclei number was correlated with pore size in samples obtained from both approaches. Representable non decellularized and decellularized rat kidney samples, were used as the negative and positive control group, respectively.\n\nDetermination of ATP in repopulated kidneys\n\nThe determination of ATP was performed in all rat kidney samples (native, n = 5, decellularized, n = 5, recellularized, n = 10) using the Enzylight ATP assay (BioAssay Systems, Hayward, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Specifically, non repopulated rat kidneys segments obtained from the rotary shaker approach or the magnetic stirrer approaches, were digested with the use of collagenase IV (Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany), followed by the determination of ATP. Non decellularized rat kidney segments and WJ-MSCs P3 cultured in the presence of 1.5 mM SDS, were served as negative and positive control groups, respectively.\n\nDetermination of ADP/ATP ratio in repopulated kidneys\n\nDetermination of the ADP/ATP ratio was performed to evaluate the viability of seeded WJ-MSCs P3 on the repopulated kidneys. For this purpose, the ADP/ATP assay kit (MAK189, Sigma- Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany) was applied, following the manufacturer’s instructions, and as has been performed previously by our laboratory. Repopulated kidney segments obtained from the rotary shaker (n = 5) or the magnetic stirrer approaches (n = 5), were completely digested using collagenase IV (Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany), followed by the determination of ADP/ATP ratio. Non decellularized kidney segments (n = 5), and WJ-MSCs P3 (n = 5) cultured in the presence of 1.5% SDS, were served as negative and positive control groups for this assay, respectively.\n\nGenomic DNA Isolation from repopulated kidneys\n\nTo validate the presence of human MSCs obtained from male donors, genomic DNA isolation, followed by the detection of sex determining region Y (SRY) gene, were performed. Genomic DNA was isolated from non decellularized (n = 5), decellularized (n = 5), and repopulated either with the first (n = 5) or the second (n = 5) approach. The DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (ID 6984, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was used for the genomic DNA isolation, according to manufacturer’s instructions. Polymerase-chain reaction (PCR) was performed, using the Taq PCR master mix (Cat No 201443, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) in final volume of 20 μl. The amplification was performed with specific primers for the SRY and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, human) and GAPDH (rattus) genes (Table ). The PCR of samples were performed on a Biometra T Gradient Thermoblock PCR Thermocycler (Biometra, Gottingen, Germany), using the following cycles. Initial denaturation at 95 °C for 15 min, denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 66 °C for 90 s and final extension at 72 °C for 3 min. A total number of 35 cycles was used. The PCR products, were loaded on 1% w/w agarose gel and images were acquired and processed with UVITEC Imaging System (Cleaver scientific, Warwickshire, UK).\n\nTable 1\n\nGeneSpeciesForward SequenceReverse SequenceAmplicon Size (bp)SRYHomo sapiensTCGGGTAACATTGGCTACAAAGAGTTATCGTAAAAAGGAGCATCTAGGTAG52GAPDHHomo sapiensAAAGGGCCCTGACAACTCTTTGGTGGTCCAGGGGTCTTACT117GapdhRattusAGGTCGGTGTGAACGGATTTGGGGGTCGTTGATGGCAACA95\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nGraphPad prism v 6.01 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) was used for the statistical analysis of the current study. Comparison in collagen, sGAG, DNA content, cell nuclei counting and ATP content between the different experimental conditions was performed with unpaired nonparametric Kruskal Wallis and Mann–Whitney U test. Statistically significant differences between group values were considered when p-value was less than 0.05. Indicated values were presented as mean ± standard deviation.\n\nResults\n\nHistological analysis of decellularized whole rat kidneys\n\nThe efficacy of whole rat kidney decellularization was evaluated using two different approaches. Same decellularization solutions were applied in both approaches. In the first approach, whole rat kidneys were immersed in the decellularization solutions, and the whole process was performed under rotational agitation. On the other hand, in the second approach, a device composed of a glass beaker and a magnetic stirrer, was used for the decellularization of whole rat kidneys (Fig. ). Three decellularization cycles were applied in both approaches, followed by histological analysis of rat kidneys. In both approaches, the rat kidneys were becoming translucent after the first cycle, indicating the initiation of cell elimination. In the 2nd cycle, rat kidneys from both approaches presented similar macroscopic morphology. At the 3rd cycle, the matrix integrity of decellularized rat kidneys, obtained from the rotary shaker approach, appeared to be affected more compared to those obtained from the magnetic stirrer approach. Indeed, cracks were observed in the matrix of the rotational agitated kidneys, whereas no damage was evident at the matrix of decellularized kidneys from the magnetic stirrer approach. Furthermore, histological analysis of whole rat kidneys, where cell loss, nephron composition, and overall ECM organization, were evaluated. For this purpose, H&E, AB and SR for the evaluation of ECM/ cell nuclear remnants, sGAGs and collagen composition in rat kidneys, were applied.\n\nIn both approaches, the cell elimination was observed after the first cycle of the application of the current decellularization protocol, as it was indicated by H&E staining (Fig. ). At the second cycle, nephron composition and ECM organization appeared to be retained in the decellularized rat kidneys and were comparable with the non-decellularized kidneys. However, after 3 decellularization cycles, the nephron composition and the overall ECM structure appeared to be disorganized (Fig. ). Whole rat kidneys decellularized with the rotary shaker approach after the 3rd cycle, characterized by a more damaged ECM, compared to those that were decellularized with the magnetic stirrer approach. SGAGs in decellularized kidneys appeared to be significantly affected after 3rd cycle in both approaches, as it was indicated by the weaker staining intensity (Fig. ). On the other hand, collagen was preserved even after the 3rd decellularization cycle in both approaches (Fig. ).\n\nFurther histological analysis involved the indirect immunofluorescence against fibronectin in combination with DAPI stain in all samples (Fig. S1). Based on the immunofluorescence results, we observed the preservation of fibronectin both in the cortex and medulla of the decellularized rat kidneys (Fig. ). Specifically, fibronectin and the overall kidney composition were retained after the decellularization in both approaches. No DAPI staining was observed in the decellularized samples, indicating the absence of the nuclear materials (Fig. ). Based on the current histological evaluation the glomerulus of bowman’s capsule, proximal convoluted tubules, the loop of Henle, ascending convoluted tubules and collecting ducts were retained intact, without the presence of any cellular population, in decellularized kidneys (after the 2nd cycle).\n\nEvaluation of pore size in rat kidney samples\n\nDifferences in tissue architecture and ECM integrity were observed between the samples of each approach, as has been indicated by the histological analysis (Fig. ). To evaluate better the impact of each approach in tissue microarchitecture, pore size was determined in all samples. Specifically, the pore size in non decellularized whole rat kidney was 11 ± 2 μm. The pore size of the decellularized kidneys obtained from the rotary shaker approach after the 1st, 2nd and 3rd cycle, was 27 ± 5, 46 ± 6 and 60 ± 7 μm, respectively (Fig. and Fig. S2). Accordingly, the pore size of decellularized kidneys after the 1st, 2nd and 3rd cycle, with the magnetic stirrer approach was 24 ± 6, 32 ± 6 and 42 ± 6 μm, respectively (Fig. and Fig. S2). All samples were characterized by an increase in pore size, when compared to the non decellularized kidney (p < 0.001). Moreover, statistically significant differences regarding the pore size were observed in the samples after the 2nd (p < 0.05) and 3rd (p < 0.05) cycle, between the two approaches. No statistically significant differences in pore size were observed between the decellularized kidneys after the 1st cycle in both approaches (p = 0.592).\n\nBiochemical and DNA quantification\n\nFurther evaluation of decellularized kidney ECM involved the quantification of hydroxyproline, sGAG and DNA content.\n\nHydroxyproline content was reduced in all samples after the 1st decellularization cycle. The total hydroxyproline content of non decellularized samples was 17 ± 2 μg hydroxyproline/mg of dry tissue weight. The hydroxyproline content of decellularized kidneys with the rotary shaker approach after the 1st, 2nd and 3rd cycle, was 13 ± 2, 12 ± 2, 4 ± 1 μg hydroxyproline/mg of dry tissue weight, respectively (Fig. ). The hydroxyproline content of decellularized kidneys with the magnetic stirrer approach after the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd cycle was 14 ± 2, 13 ± 2 and 6 ± 1 μg hydroxyproline/mg of dry tissue weight, respectively (Fig. ). No statistically significant differences were found in hydroxyproline content between non decellularized and decellularized kidneys (from both approaches) until the end of the 2nd cycle. Statistically significant differences in hydroxyproline content were observed between the samples obtained from both approaches after the 3rd cycle, and non decellularized samples (p < 0.001). No statistically significant differences were observed between the decellularized samples of each approach, within the same cycle (p > 0.05).\n\nThe sGAG content of decellularized kidneys with the first approach after the 1st, 2nd and 3rd cycle, was 2.8 ± 0.7, 2.5 ± 0.6 and 0.4 ± 0.1 μg hydroxyproline/ mg of dry tissue weight, while in the 2nd approach was 3.1 ± 0.9, 2.7 ± 0.6 and 0.6 ± 0.1 μg sGAGs/mg of dry tissue weight (Fig. ). The sGAG content of all samples was statistically significant reduced (p < 0.001) compared to the non decellularized samples (6.8 ± 0.7 μg sGAGs/mg of dry tissue).\n\nThe DNA content of decellularized samples was significantly reduced after the 1st cycle, in both approaches. Specifically, the DNA content of non decellularized samples was 1134 ± 60 ng DNA/mg dry tissue weight (Fig. ). The DNA content of decellularized samples with the first approach after the 1st, 2nd and 3rd cycles, was 260 ± 73, 83 ± 15 and 46 ng DNA/mg dry tissue weight (Fig. ). The DNA content of decellularized samples with the second approach after the 1st, 2nd and 3rd cycles, was 210 ± 58, 54 ± 29 and 36 ± 10 ng DNA/mg dry tissue weight. Statistically significant differences (p < 0.001) in DNA content were observed between non decellularized and decellularized samples from both approaches (and all cycles). Furthermore, no dense bands were evident in decellularized samples, during the DNA electrophoresis (Fig. ).\n\nCytotoxicity assay\n\nCytotoxicity of decellularized tissues is mostly exerted due to incomplete removal of the decellularization solutions. This may result in impaired tissue cell seeding, thus affecting the overall function of the produced scaffold. For this purpose, contact cytotoxicity and tissue extract assay in decellularized kidney samples, were performed. The results of the contact cytotoxicity assay indicated that the cell growth and attached to all decellularized kidney samples (Data not shown). The WJ-MSCs exhibited the same morphology as the cells of the negative control group (Fig. ). To further evaluate the cell growth in the presence of decellularized rat kidney samples, Giemsa stain was applied. The results were in accordance with the aforementioned observations, indicating no presence of any cytotoxic agents in the produced decellularized kidney scaffolds from both approaches (Fig. ). Furthermore, the extract cytotoxicity assay confirmed the above results, showing no alteration in the cell morphology when cultured with the tissue extracts from decellularized kidney samples (Fig. ).\n\nEvaluation of repopulated whole rat kidney scaffolds\n\nTo further investigate the biocompatibility of the produced whole rat kidney scaffolds, repopulation with WJ-MSCs P3 was performed. Considering the above data (histological, biochemical, and cytotoxicity analysis), we determined that the kidney scaffolds after the 2nd cycles from both approaches, characterized by better ECM preservation and cell elimination characteristics, thus we continued our evaluation for the decellularized kidney biocompatibility with the aforementioned samples (Table S1) Histological analysis with H&E staining, revealed the presence of WJ-MSCs to the entire kidney scaffolds derived either from the 1st or the 2nd approach (Fig. ). Moreover, IHC against collagen type IV, confirmed the presence of MSCs in the produced kidney scaffolds. Higher magnification, showed that the WJ-MSCs were in close proximity with the collagen type IV (Fig. ). In addition, based on indirect IF results, HuNu was detected in the repopulated kidney scaffolds, confirming further the human origin of the seeded cells (Fig. ).\n\nTo further evaluate the repopulation efficiency, cell nuclei counting and DNA quantification in repopulated kidneys, was achieved (Fig. ). Non decellularized rat kidneys were characterized by 316 ± 48 cell nuclei/optical field. On the contrary, the cell nuclei number/optical field in decellularized kidneys was 8 ± 2. Repopulated whole rat kidneys with the rotary shaker and the magnetic stirrer approach were characterized by 91 ± 26 and 171 ± 26 cell nuclei/visual field, respectively (Fig. ). Statistically significant differences regarding the cell nuclei number/optical field were observed between the repopulated kidneys from both approaches (p < 0.001). Indeed, the number of cell nuclei/optical filed in the repopulated samples of the magnetic stirrer approach was increased by 53% compared to the repopulated samples of the rotary shaker approach. In the same way, the DNA amount in the repopulated kidneys from both approaches, appeared to be increased compared to decellularized whole rat kidneys. Specifically, the DNA amount was 400 ± 38 and 542 ± 56 ng/dry tissue weight in the repopulated samples of the 1st and the 2nd approach, respectively (Fig. ). Statistically significant differences were observed between the repopulated kidney of the 1st and the 2nd approach (p < 0.001). In addition, no sign of cytotoxic effects in repopulated kidney samples obtained from both approaches was evident (Fig. ). The seeded WJ-MSCs in repopulated kidneys from both approaches were characterized by higher ATP levels compared to the positive control group. Specifically, negative control group, positive control group, and repopulated samples from the rotary shaker and magnetic stirrer approaches, characterized by 77 ± 5, 2 ± 1, 28 ± 3, and 34 ± 5 μM of ATP, respectively (Fig. ). Statistically significant differences were observed between the negative control group and the rest of the samples (p < 0.001). Additionally, the ADP/ATP ratios of the repopulated rat kidneys from both approaches were similar to those obtained from the negative control group (Fig. ). Further evaluation of the repopulation efficacy involved the correlation between the cell nuclei and pore size in the repopulated rat kidneys obtained from both decellularization approaches. The results of this analysis showed a negative correlation between the number of cell nuclei and the pore size of the kidney scaffolds (Fig. ). Finally, SRY and GAPDH presence was confirmed only in the repopulated kidney scaffolds. This result was in agreement with the aforementioned results, confirming further the presence of WJ-MSCs (derived from male origin) in the kidney scaffolds (Fig. .) Gapdh alone was also detected in the non decellularized kidney, while no Gapdh and SRY were detected in decellularized kidney scaffolds (Fig. ).\n\nDiscussion\n\nModern tissue engineering strategies are focusing on the production of completely bioengineered organs, to reduce the required transplantation time [45–52]. Currently, renal transplantation is the gold standard treatment in patients suffering from end-stage renal function [53, 54]. However, the great need for available kidney transplants cannot be covered by the living and deceased donors [55, 56]. Therefore, the innovative tissue engineering approaches may assist to this issue, by increasing the pool of donated organs, through the production of bioengineered renal transplants.\n\nAdditionally, bioengineered kidneys can be used as biomimetic models for drug screening. In terms of personalized medicine, humanized kidneys (with patient’s cells) can be used as disease models, in order to explore thoroughly specific cellular functions, including aberrant gene expression and signaling pathways, that may lead to disease therapy [57–65]. Taking into consideration the above data, the aim of this study was the evaluation of two different approaches, in order to achieve whole rat kidney decellularization. The kidney biocompatibility and repopulation efficacy were also evaluated in the current study.\n\nIn this direction, the macroscopic evaluation revealed that rat kidneys started to become translucent after the 1st cycle in both approaches. The kidney ultrastructure was preserved after the 2nd cycle in both approaches. However, extensive damage of the kidney matrix was observed only in the samples of the rotary shaker approach after the 3rd decellularization cycle. The preservation of kidney ultrastructure during decellularization, is of significant importance. Indeed, damaged kidney ultrastructure, due to the long-term exposure to decellularization detergents, could be linked with altered biomechanical properties. This in turn, could hamper the overall functionality of the produced scaffold, therefore limiting its application in tissue engineering approaches.\n\nTo further evaluate the impact of the proposed decellularization strategies, comprehensive histological analysis was performed. H&E stain revealed the initiation of cellular and nuclear material elimination after the 1st decellularization cycle in both approaches. Completely absence of cellular and nuclear materials was observed after the 2nd decellularization cycle in both approaches, while the ECM composition and nephron structure were preserved. On the other hand, after the 3rd cycle, the renal matrix appeared to be disorganized in both approaches. Taken together the data obtained from the macroscopic analysis and histological evaluation, more damage of renal matrix appeared to be performed in samples obtained from the rotary shaker approach compared to the magnetic stirrer approach. Histological analysis, involved the performance of AB and SR stains. SGAGs appeared to be significantly affected after the 3rd cycle in both approaches. On the other hand, collagen was well preserved in decellularized kidneys (obtained from both approaches), after the completion of all decellularization cycles. Based on these results, we assumed that the proper cell elimination and preservation of kidney ECM, was performed after the 2nd cycle in both approaches. Moreover, the results of the proposed cost-effective approaches were comparable with the previously described perfusion decellularization strategies for whole rat kidney scaffold production. Indeed, Chani et al. [44] used the perfusion decellularization in kidneys derived from Sprague–Dawley rats, where extensive damage of decellularized kidneys, was observed. In the study of Caralt et al. [66] and Wang et al. [40], also extensive kidney damage was evident after the application of the perfusion decellularization approaches. In the majority of these approaches, Triton X -100 and SDS, were used as the primary decellularization agents. In addition, to remove completely the cellular and nuclear remnants some research groups, added an enzymatic treatment step, mostly with the use of trypsin [44, 66]. In our study, the only decellularization agents used, were the CHAPS and SDS. From our previous laboratory experience regarding the decellularization of other organs (e.g., arteries, trachea and esophagus), the current agents, have been used with great success [45–48]. Triton X-100, which is used widely, in the decellularization protocols worldwide, may be responsible for the removal of sGAGs and decrease in fibronectin and vimentin content in decellularized tissues, as has been indicated in the past by other research teams [32, 33]. In addition, SDS, an ionic reagent, can cause severe damage to sGAGs and collagen, through disruption of protein–protein interactions [32, 33]. Additionally, SDS can effectively modify the orientation of collagen fibers in the ECM of the decellularized organs [32, 33, 67–69]. Though, until date, SDS has been used in the majority of the decellularization protocols that have been published in the literature. The concentration of SDS significantly varies between published protocols from 0.1 to 2% [49, 66]. These variations in SDS concentration may be responsible for the contradictory results that are observed between the studies. In addition, prolonged enzymatic incubation of tissue (with trypsin) may result to the removal of key ECM proteins, including laminin, fibronectin and elastin [32, 33]. For those reasons, we utilized a different decellularization protocol, where only chemical agents, were used. Moreover, the concentration of SDS in our study, was only 0.05%, which was proved effective for the removal of cellular and nuclear materials, without causing extended ECM damage. To properly assess the impact of our decellularization approaches in kidney ECM, indirect IF against fibronectin in combination with DAPI staining, was performed. Fibronectin was preserved in decellularized kidneys after the 2nd cycle in both approaches, while DAPI staining was observed only in the non decellularized kidney samples. It is known that fibronectin plays an important role in regulating the proliferation and migration of tubular epithelial cells in the kidney, through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway [70]. Fibronectin is an abundant renal ECM protein, where endothelial and epithelial cells can adhere through ανβ1 interactions [71–73]. Also, conformational changes in fibronectin, possibly caused by its damage during the decellularization, may lead to impaired cell adhesion and proliferation, which can lead to renal fibrosis [73]. In our study, the fibronectin was well preserved (both in medulla and cortex) in the decellularized kidneys obtained from both approaches. The preservation of fibronectin in decellularized kidney matrix may act positively to the organ recellularization.\n\nBiochemical analysis involving hydroxyproline, sGAG quantification and DNA content evaluation, was the next step of the whole rat kidney decellularization assessment. Hydroxyproline content appeared to be retained until the 3rd cycle in both approaches, whereas the sGAG content significantly decreased after the 1st decellularization cycle in both approaches. The decrease in sGAG content has also been reported previously by other research teams, when SDS is used as decellularization agent [45, 48, 69, 74, 75]. SDS is an anionic detergent, consisted of a hydrophobic 12-carbon chain and a polar sulfate head group [69, 76]. The polar sulfate head group of SDS can bind to the negative charged sites of the sGAGs, causing subsequently their removal [69, 76]. Also, a significant decrease in DNA content was observed in all samples after the 1st, 2nd and 3rd cycles, indicating the successful elimination of the resident cellular populations. In addition, the produced decellularized kidney scaffolds bear no cytotoxic effects. Contact and tissue extract cytotoxicity assay showed that the cells retained their morphology in the presence of the decellularized tissue. Also, the cells were successfully proliferated and got in contact with the decellularized kidney samples, indicating the complete absence of any cytotoxic agents in the produced acellular kidney scaffolds. The above results seemed to be similar with the results of previous studies [45, 48, 69], confirming further the success of the proposed strategies in whole rat kidney decellularization.\n\nIn this study, repopulation of the produced renal scaffolds with WJ-MSCs P3 was performed, in order to evaluate the functionality of the decellularized kidneys. The MSCs were selected as the desired cellular population for the seeding experiments in the current study. MSCs, are multipotent stem cells of mesodermal origin, capable of differentiating to other cell lineages [77]. Unlike to specialized cells, like endothelial and epithelial cells, MSCs can be easily handled in vitro, and can be expanded in great numbers, which are favored for the tissue engineering applications [78, 79]. Also, MSCs are immune-privileged cells, which are lacking the expression of HLA class II molecules, indicating a potential broader use for the development of universal donor tissue engineered organs [80]. Based on the above data, decellularized kidneys obtained from both approaches after the 2nd cycle, were characterized by the best quality characteristics (macroscopic, microscopic evaluation, biochemical and DNA analysis, and cytotoxicity results), thus were selected for the seeding experiments. Under static seeding conditions, WJ-MSCs P3 repopulated successfully the kidney scaffolds obtained from both approaches. However, increased number of cells were observed in the kidney scaffolds obtained from the magnetic stirrer approach, in comparison to the scaffolds obtained from the rotary shaker approach, as it was indicated by cell counting and DNA analysis. Additionally, immunohistochemistry, showed that WJ-MSCs P3 were in close proximity with the collagen IV in the repopulated kidney scaffolds. The majority of the seeded cells were appeared in the cortical region of the kidney scaffolds, as it was indicated by the histological analysis. The same outcome has been observed in the study of Remuzzi et al. [81], where infused embryonic stem cells (ESCs), were used. Also, similar results were presented in the study of Ross et al. [82] In their study, also ESCs were infused through the renal artery and appeared to repopulate efficiently the decellularized kidney scaffold, in a similar way as in our study. Moreover, seeded MSCs on kidney scaffolds, expressed HuNu, as it was observed by indirect IF. HuNu is a specific human nuclear antigen, which confirmed the human origin of the observed seeded cells in the repopulated kidney scaffolds. Moreover, to crosscheck the human origin of the seeded cells, SRY detection, was applied. In the repopulation experiments, we used WJ-MSCs obtained from male donors, while the kidneys were obtained from female rats. It is known, that SRY, is a male-specific gene, located at the Y chromosome. SRY gene was able to be detected only at the repopulated kidney scaffolds, thus confirming the aforementioned results. Specifically, SRY and GAPDH, were detected at the repopulated kidneys. No SRY or Gapdh expression was detected in the decellularized kidney samples. The latter result, provided additional evidence that decellularized kidneys of this study, were cell-free scaffolds, and only a small amount of fragmented DNA may be existed. However, this DNA amount, was not able to be amplified (after 35 cycles), confirming further the elimination of tissue resident cells. Furthermore, the seeded WJ-MSCs were metabolically active and characterized by good viability, as it was indicated by the results of ATP and ADP/ATP ratio assays, respectively. The presented results provided important cues for the preservation of key structural proteins in the acellular kidney scaffolds, which are related to the cell–cell and cell-ECM interactions, promoting the cell growth.\n\nTaking into consideration the above data, we assume that the magnetic stirrer approach may have more beneficial outcomes in terms of cell elimination, and kidney matrix composition compared to the 1st decellularization strategy. In both approaches, equal volume of the decellularization solutions was applied. However, these outcomes may be related to the increased mass transfer that can be achieved with the 2nd approach, ensuring the greater delivery of decellularization agents in the kidney matrix, compared to the 1st approach [83, 84]. These resulted in better tissue histoarchitecture with the least damage of the ECM, in combination with the proper cell and nuclear elimination. Indeed, decellularized kidneys after the 3rd cycle of the rotary shaker approach, characterized by extended cracks in the organ matrix. Moreover, decellularized kidneys obtained from the magnetic stirrer, characterized by smaller pore size compared to the 1st approach. The pore size is playing a significant role in cell permeability and attachment in scaffolds [85–87]. It has been shown, that MSCs can migrate efficiently in scaffolds with pore sizes of 17 μm [85–87]. The pore size of the decellularized kidney scaffolds was ranged between 32 (magnetic stirrer approach) and 46 (rotary shaker approach) μm, and the mean size of the used MSCs was 13 μm. In this way, the MSCs could efficiently penetrate the kidney matrix, and also successfully proliferated, as confirmed by histological analysis.\n\nBefore summarizing our data, it is worthy to mention the limitations of the current study. To better assess the repopulation efficacy of the produced acellular kidney scaffolds, seeding with kidney tubular epithelial cells must be performed. However, complete recellularization of highly organized matrices is a demanding task, requiring a great number of cells. In this way, specialized cells are characterized by demanding in vitro handling and impaired cell proliferation. On the other hand, stem cells, including ESCs, induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) and MSCs can overcome these limitations, can efficiently be differentiated to specialized cells, and thus are more favorable for tissue engineering applications. A second limitation of this study may be the lack of biomechanical analysis data, in order to have a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed decellularization approaches. There are studies in literature, where the mechanical properties including the determination of the tensile strength, have been performed in kidneys, providing evidence for the impact of the decellularization in tissue elasticity [44, 88]. Finally, the evaluation of removal of α-gal epitopes from the decellularized kidneys with the current decellularization strategies, may add valuable data for the proper production of acellular kidney scaffolds [89]. These epitopes are widely distributed in animal-derived organs and are responsible for the initiation of hyperacute rejections in humans [89]. Considering that the proposed decellularization strategies or the decellularization reagents may be used for the development of acellular kidneys derived from large animal models, the assessment of the a-gal epitopes removal is of major importance. The next step of the experiments will include the above assays, in order to gain more data regarding our proposed decellularization strategies.\n\nCurrently, CKD is the 18th leading cause of death (worldwide), thus the increase in the number of renal transplants is of major importance [90]. Therefore, the administration of shortage of kidney donors, may be properly handled with the organ production with the tissue engineering approaches.\n\nIn conclusion, two alternatives, to perfusion decellularization approaches, strategies were presented, ensuring the cost-effective production of acellular kidney scaffolds. These scaffolds were assessed thoroughly for their biocompatibility, including histological, biochemical and cytotoxicity analysis. The produced scaffolds were properly seeded with MSCs, ensuring in this way their functionality. Recellularized kidney scaffolds can be used as tools for nephrotoxicity drug screening [91]. The nephrotoxicity evaluation of cisplatin, tenofovir, and cyclosporin may be performed in bioengineered kidneys, thus overcoming the strict bioethical issues of using living models [92]. Moreover, recellularized kidneys with patients’ cells, may provide significant data, regarding the molecular pathways of disease pathogenesis, thus bringing personalized medicine one step closer to its clinical utility. Performing this study, we provided evidence for the efficient production of acellular kidney scaffolds, utilizing cost-effective decellularization strategies. As a proof of concept, the findings of the current study can be used as the basis for the production of acellular kidney scaffolds derived from large animal models and cadaver donors."
