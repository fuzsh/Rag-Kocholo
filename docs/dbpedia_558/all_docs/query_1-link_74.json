Since 1996 and onwards he has continued his career as an Associate Professor of History and Academic Director in the Center for Peace and Global Citizenship, of Haverford College, Pennsylvania, USA.\n\nHis latest 2018 publication is called The Greeks and the Making of Modern Egypt: from Muhamad Ali To Nasser. Alexander Kitroeff’s researching interest focuses on the study of nationalism and ethnicity in modern Greece and its diaspora and manifestations across a broad spectrum, from politics to sports. Furthermore he studies the history of Greek Sports with emphasis on the Panathinaikos Athletic Club. He recently completed a book-length ms. on the history of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America and is preparing an expanded, updated edition of a book he published in 2010, a history of the Athens-based Panathinaikos sports association Ελλάς, Ευρώπη, Παναθηναϊκός: 100 Χρόνια Ελληνική Ιστορία. Earlier publications include a book on the history of the Greeks in Egypt between the two world wars, a book on the Greeks in the Americas and a volume with articles on the history of Jews in Greece. He is also collaborating with film director Maria Iliou for whom he has acted as historical consultant in four documentaries. Their current project is a 5-part history of the city of Athens, from 1821 to present day. He is the grandson of former president of Panathinaikos in 1934, Georgios Giannoulatos.\n\nAndreas Economou was born in 1982 in Athens, Greece and is the founder and origin of Belle Époque.\n\nHe studied geology in the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens and journalism in the ANT1 School of Journalism in Athens, Greece. He began a lengthy research on the history of Greek Sports in 2009 and since then, the study and organizing of the Panathinaikos Athletic Club historical archives, dated from 1926, has been his primary passion.\n\nHis books have retained the title of best-selling sports publications in the bookstores of Athens for several consecutive months. His work has been presented in important cultural venues in Athens, including the Acropolis Museum.\n\nMaria Tsiouraki born in 1976 in Athens is a founding member and managing director of Belle Époque.\n\nShe studied journalism in the ANT1 School of Journalism in Athens, Greece, but also has a degree in preschool social studies. Having worked in the preschool education sector 12 consecutive years (1996-2010) in various facilities, she then worked for the Melissia branch of the internationally renowned non-profit organization “The Smile of the Child”.\n\nIn 2016 together with her sister Alexandra they founded Jasmine Events, an event management company and ultimately in 2018 she co-founded Belle Époque with Andreas Economou."
