        "text": "Hollywood was so scared to death by a woman’s agency, it spent a decade after her arrival trying to conjure up tough guys to make anyone forget she ever existed.\n\nRobert Wise’s “Born to Kill” so shocked on its release in cinemas, it was almost immediately banned from heartland American theatres, causing studio RKO to disown its noir problem child just days after its birth. After being placed on a Production Code blacklist for overly salacious crime pictures, “Kill” further had the dishonor of being named in a 1948 murder trial, since the 12-year-old offender had seen the film in the three weeks prior his killing of an eight-year-old.\n\nAll this, over a woman.\n\nThat woman is Helen Brent, played…\n\n12th Robert Wise (after Star Trek: The Motion Picture, The Sound of Music, Curse of the Cat People, Mademoiselle Fifi, The Haunting, The Day the Earth Stood Still, The Body Snatcher, A Game of Death, The Andromeda Strain, West Side Story and Rooftops)\n\nWatched for Curated Cupcake Cinema!\n\nWould make a sizzling erotic thriller, this, if it had been made in the early 90s. Wouldn't be as successful as what Wise and co. ended up with (the implication of sex is sometimes more exciting than a sex scene), but that potent premise of bad people doing even worse things for lust and money wouldn't be out of place in an Eszterhas script. It also gives Trevor a superb lead role…\n\n”What an assured man!”\n\n\"You gotta know what you want in life, be sure you're gonna get it, and you can't miss. I found that out early.”\n\n“Most people don't know what they want out of life in the first place.”\n\n“I'll bet you do.”\n\n“Do I?”\n\n“Yes...”\n\n“Yes, I do. Exactly. Don't you?”\n\n“I know what I want when I see it.”\n\nCurated Cupcake Cinema #24\n\nNoirvember #9\n\n(Previous review here.)\n\nWhy settle for a turnip when you can have a Wilde man instead!\n\nFilm noir lives and dies by its casting and you couldn't ask for a more deliciously evil rogue than Lawrence Tierney as Sam Wilde in Born to Kill, a panther ready to pounce from unchecked…\n\n\"Honest, Sam, you go nuts about nothin'. Nothin' at all. You gotta watch that. You can't just go around killin' people whenever the notion strikes you. It's not feasible!\"\n\n\"Why isn't it?\"\n\n\"Alright, Sam. Alright, it is.\"\n\n(Previous review here.)\n\nI might be swayed to rearrange the header for my Masculine Sexual INTENSITY list because Lawrence Tierney is just so INTENSE.\n\nFour points:\n\n1. Production Code Administration chief Joe Breen said of Born to Kill that it \"ought not to be made because it is a story of gross lust and shocking brutality and ruthlessness.\"\n\n2. Lawrence Tierney once offered wisdom to Eddie Muller: \"Never get in a fight with a guy who knows how to handle a knife.\"\n\n3.…\n\n\"You're the coldest iceberg of a woman I ever saw, and the rottenest inside. I've seen plenty, too. I wouldn't trade places with you if they sliced me into little pieces.\"\n\nImpending carpal tunnel syndrome strikes again. Ouch. We'll see how long until this pain passes. If only I could get some new wrists.\n\nHere's what you came for, the meat of the matter: Robert Wise's Born to Kill is just a barn burner of a noir, isn't it? I've lost count of how many times I've seen it, but it's like dark magic every time. My heart always beats a little faster for actors who are fellow Brooklynites, so the pairing of Claire Trevor and Lawrence Tierney is an absolute…\n\nCurated Cupcake Cinema - #24\n\n\"Has it occurred to you, neither of us looks like a scoundrel, do we?\"\n\nThe best noirs don't have an ounce of redemption in their characters. We don't need no stinkin' redemption... just Claire Trevor making us weak in the knees is more than enough!\n\nThe non-traditional story here, that of a femme fatal and a homme fatal playing a four way affair against their respective lovers is what is most intriguing and makes this a much more bleak exercise in the smoke of mirrors of the classic, more simplistic noirs of the time. Audiences just weren't ready it either back in '47 and so this RKO picture died a fairly quick death at the…\n\nSweet jesus is this movie horny.\n\nLaury Palmer goes out with another guy because she's so into Sam Wild (Lawrence Tierney), she feels like she has to make it a little harder for him. Sam kills both of them because she's not allowed to be with anyone else. Marty (Elisha Cook Jr.) ultimately dies because he's probably in love with Wild, too. Wild and Helen Brent (Claire Trevor) barely manage not to grope one another in public the first time they meet, and the rest of the movie happens entirely because all they want is one another, no matter the cost. Terrible choice follows terrible choice, for ends that will be worth it, as long as they end up together. And, lord, are Tierney and Trevor convincing in their roles -- I can't believe the Hayes office didn't demand every shot of them just looking at one another be cut for indecency.\n\nTL; DR: Very horny. Very hot. Very good.\n\nSam Wilde (Lawrence Tierney) and Helen Brent (Claire Trevor) are both outsiders, looking upon polite society and all of its privileges from below and desperately wanting to stake their claims in that rarified air. For Helen, because of a life spent hiding inside that world, adopted into a home and status to which she has no true right, sticking there has meant burying deep everything that defines who she truly is. Around her rotten core — the core Sam sees immediately — Helen has wrapped an ingratiating smile, and harmless manner, and an appropriately bland, acceptable fiancé. She has forbidden the parts of her that threaten her place to see the light, tamped them down so hard she has told…\n\nIt’s kind of funny that in 40’s movies a husband and wife couldn’t be photographed in bed together, but Lawrence Tierney and Elisha Cook Jr. could snuggle up side by side and the censors wouldn’t bat an eye over it.\n\nTierney’s the male lead here. You may know him as Joe Cabot, the crime boss from Reservoir Dogs. And if that’s the case, it might be difficult for you to imagine that he was once considered something of a sex symbol. But before decades of hard drinking and bar fights left him looking like The Thing, he had the square jaw and defined cheek bones of a more traditional Jack Kirby character.\n\nNot that he’s any kind of superhero here.…\n\n“I was afraid something like this would happen, the way you go off your head.”\n\n“I think you’ve had too much to drink.”\n\n“He’s the sort of guy who punches first and asks questions later.”\n\n“You think the world is yours, crashing around tearing it to pieces.”\n\n“All you’re crazy about is money and yourself.”\n\n“We still have time for kisses before the police get me.”\n\nSome films noir sneak up on you. Not Born to Kill. It comes out with guns blazing, knives flashing, and fists pumping. It’s one of the best minor noirs. If it had more distinctive cinematography, it would be one of the greatest.\n\nSam Wild (Lawrence Tierney) is just no good. Why is he in…"
