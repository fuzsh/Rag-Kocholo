        "text": "Although he had never directed a musical, Wise began the 1960s by entering into the unusual relationship of codirecting West Side Story (1961) with Jerome Robbins, who had directed and choreographed the long-running Broadway hit on which the film was based. The resulting film was a tremendous critical as well as commercial success—Wise’s biggest hit to date—and received 10 Academy Awards, including best picture and best director. A clever contemporization of William Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet, scripted by Ernest Lehman (with whom Wise had collaborated on Somebody up There Likes Me and Executive Suite), it featured Natalie Wood and Richard Beymer as an updated version of the famous star-crossed lovers, with Academy Award-winning supporting performances by George Chakiris and Rita Moreno. Much of the action was highly stylized, but Wise established the crucial reality of the world in which it unfolded by opening the film with helicopter shots of New York City neighbourhoods.\n\nThe romantic comedy Two for the Seesaw (1962), based on the 1958 play by William Gibson, was considerably less successful, despite the unlikely chemistry generated by Robert Mitchum and Shirley MacLaine. Wise then went to England to make the suspenseful psychological thriller The Haunting (1963). Julie Harris and Claire Bloom starred in that suggestive version of Shirley Jackson’s novel The Haunting of Hill House (1959), which is widely considered to be among the best ghost stories on film.\n\nWise’s next film, The Sound of Music (1965), was a huge hit that became the highest-grossing film in history to that date. Based on the real-life story of the Trapp family, who escaped Nazi-held Austria in 1938, it starred Julie Andrews as the family’s governess, a role first made famous by Mary Martin in the original Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II stage hit. Wise, who used the Austrian Alps to great effect, won his second Academy Award for best director, and the film won for best picture, while Andrews was nominated for best actress.\n\nThe Sand Pebbles (1966) was even more ambitious: an epic three-hour-long adventure that starred Steve McQueen and Richard Attenborough as sailors on a U.S. gunboat in China in 1926 and Richard Crenna as their captain. The sprawling film was nominated for best picture, and McQueen was nominated for best actor. Wise’s return to the big-budget musical, Star! (1968), in which Andrews portrayed stage star Gertrude Lawrence, was a tremendous box-office failure.\n\nLast films\n\nFor the remainder of his career, Wise limited the number of films he directed. After making the The Andromeda Strain (1971) from Michael Crichton’s best-selling novel about a toxic virus from outer space, he directed the melodramatic Two People (1973), with Peter Fonda and Lindsay Wagner; The Hindenburg (1975), chronicling the events around the famous dirigible disaster; the thriller Audrey Rose (1977), with Anthony Hopkins; and the big-budget Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979), the first entry in the franchise of movies based on the Star Trek television series. Wise took a 10-year hiatus and then filmed Rooftops (1989), a gritty nonmusical variation on West Side Story that failed to find an audience. At age 84 he directed his last film, the made-for-TV A Storm in Summer (2000), starring Peter Falk.\n\nWise served as president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences from 1984 to 1987. Among the most prolific and accomplished directors of his generation, he was the recipient of the Director’s Guild D.W. Griffith Award (1988) and the American Film Institute’s Lifetime Achievement Award (1998).\n\nMichael BarsonThe Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica"
