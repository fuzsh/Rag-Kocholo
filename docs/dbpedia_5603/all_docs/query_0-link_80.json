        "text": "Director / Editor / Producer\n\n(1914-2005) Born September 10, Winchester, Indiana, USATop 250 Directors/ 50 Key Noir Directors\n\nKey Production Country: USA\n\nKey Genres: Drama, Crime Drama, Crime, Film Noir, Science Fiction, Thriller, Gothic Film, Psychological Western, Melodrama, Psychological Drama, Western, Musical Drama\n\nKey Collaborators: Albert S. D'Agostino (Production Designer), Nelson Gidding (Screenwriter), Boris Leven (Production Designer), Ernest Lehman (Screenwriter), Thomas Reilly (Editor), William H. Reynolds (Editor), Cedric Gibbons (Production Designer), Walter E. Keller (Production Designer), Julie Andrews (Leading Actress), Robert Mitchum (Leading Actor), Robert Ryan (Leading Actor), Eleanor Parker (Leading Actress)\n\n\"Robert Wise began as a film editor, working with distinction on Orson Welles's Citizen Kane (1941) and The Magnificent Ambersons (1942)... Wise made movies until he was well into his eighties. Films such as The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951), and Star Trek (1979) point back to his early experiments with special effects during the 1940s. Some have criticized him for rigidly adhering to genre rather than evolving his own discernible directorial style. A tall order, perhaps, considering his range. Nonetheless, Wise's films were all stamped with the same degree of professionalism. And they were undeniably successful, winning awards as well as pleasing the movie-going hordes.\" - Matthew Coniam (501 Movie Directors: A Comprehensive Guide to the Greatest Filmmakers, 2007)\n\n\"After directing a number of routine B pictures in the late 40s, Wise made what many consider the best boxing drama ever filmed, The Set-Up (1949), a mercilessly candid portrait of the seedy world of the professional ring... Wise followed this in the 50s with such high quality films as The Day the Earth Stood Still, Executive Suite, Somebody Up There Likes Me, I Want to Live and, Odds Against Tomorrow.\" - The MacMillan International Film Encyclopedia, 1994\n\n\"Although Robert Wise's most celebrated film was The Sound of Music (1965), shot in splendid Todd-AO and De Luxe Color, his forte was gritty, small-budget, black-and-white realistic dramas. Robert Wise became one of Hollywood's leading directors by moving from genre to genre, from style to style, in a workmanlike manner. Although he did so without imposing any discernible personal stamp on his films, he directed some of the finest boxing dramas, sci-fi movies, and horror films.\" - Ronald Bergan (Film - Eyewitness Companions, 2006)\n\n\"Variable American director and former editor, notably with Orson Welles on Citizen Kane (1941) and The Magnificent Ambersons (1942)… Although he has tackled every kind of subject, his best work is with intimate, almost claustrophobic themes - the business battles of Executive Suite (1954), the death-cell drama of I Want to Live (1958), the occult horror of The Haunting (1959).\" - Margaret Hinxman (The International Encyclopedia of Film, 1972)\n\n\"Robert Wise was marked as a director to watch very early in his career. Among Val Lewton alumni, he occupies a middle position between Jacques Tourneur at the top and Mark Robson at the bottom. His temperament is vaguely liberal, his style vaguely realistic; but after The Sound of Music and The Sand Pebbles, the stylistic signature of Robert Wise is indistinct to the point of invisibility.\" - Andrew Sarris (The American Cinema, 1968)\n\n\"American director whose work became more variable as his career progressed - generally at his best with small-scale or sinister subjects. But, strangely, his two Academy Awards have been for big, splashy musicals - West Side Story and The Sound of Music - a far cry from the days when he edited films for Orson Welles.\" - David Quinlan (Quinlan's Film Directors, 1999)\n\n\"A much maligned director who has a good pictorial sense and the ability to integrate a hint of realism and an interest in social issues into all types of projects.\" - William R. Meyer (The Film Buff's Catalog, 1978)\n\n“A former film editor turned director and sometime producer who has quietly emerged as a filmmaker of considerable stature.” - The Encyclopedia of Hollywood, 2004"
