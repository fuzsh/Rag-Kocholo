        "text": "Robert Wise was an American film director who made 39 feature films in a career spanning from 1940s to 1990s. He made films on all genres which made him a very versatile director. The genres in which he showed exceptional talent included horror movies, movies with film noir, westerns, sports films, science fiction movies, musicals and many others. He won 2 Oscars for film direction and was revered as a great director in the film industry. Though he was master craftsman with immense artistic powers he never left a personal imprint in any of his films. In his opinion the director should tailor himself to the film and not the other way round. He became especially famous throughout the world for his two musicals ‘West Side Story’ and ‘The Sound of Music’. He was committed to thorough realism in the films he made and carried out the job like an efficient craftsman. He was considered not only an artisan for the perfection he produced in films of various genres but also an artist who kept within the budget."
