        "text": "Abstract Zombies have exploded their fictional boundaries in what is essentially a return to their supposed beginning in social reality. These horror icons have changed through their various manifestations in film, fiction and media, however, becoming more than just metaphor for capitalism or social conservatism. Although clear connections exist between the collective symbolism of zombies and movements such as the Occupy protests or on the other hand between zombie annihilation fantasies and colonial history, no single metaphorical interpretation seems able to contain the zombie phenomenon. They have become a powerful social technology capable of creating and dismantling meaning. This ability to simultaneously construct and destroy make zombies a powerful tool in deciphering individual transformations in post-apocalyptic fictional worlds and also a key influence in forging links between those transformations and real social change. In this chapter I argue that zombies are the same kind of ‘meaning machines’ J. Jack Halberstam discussed when she attempted to revise the definition of Gothic horror in her book Skin Shows. Via Kristevian abjection, I also explain why it is important that the Romero zombie has become the dominant cultural manifestation of this particular monster. Ultimately I examine the role the technology of the zombie plays in physically re-mapping human bodies in the post-apocalypse and do this through a sustained analysis of the AMC series The Walking Dead. I find these cartographies often transgress the boundaries of the fictional worlds they manifest in and establish themselves directly in our own social reality; this is best revealed by a sustained consideration of Afro-Orientalism as political alliance between the characters in the same television series. Finally, in attempting to demonstrate the function of zombies in these processes, I discuss unexpected but potentially important connections to the field of critical posthumanism – ending on the strange subject of zombie sexuality.

Based on the author's experience of expatriation, the essay records, with humour, nostalgia and rationalisation alternately, a variety of emotions and dis/advantages to her condition that bring to mind the theories of Klein, Winnicott, Bion and Kristeva. With their focus on self-hate and guilt, lack of holding and continuity, false and true self, severed links and bond, disorientation, these theories help explain the likely sources of the text's ruptures. Close reading and deconstructive approach, in turn, confirm the psychoanalytical theories as they highlight what Jacqueline Rose would consider writing that reveals unconscious phenomena. Indeed in its attempt to deconstruct the metaphor of losing north, the text loses ground increasingly while its voice remains continually floating, language drifting away from the speaker's centre of self. Although the text clearly struggles to engage in a Derridian practice of word play to get beyond unitary meaning, the textual voice follows a unidirectional, indeed unidimensional thread, avoiding affective planes, erasing the feminine, thereby perpetuating its own entrapment. Losing North thus illustrates a particular exploitation of Derridian word play, fabricating associations while probing, and grappling with, meanings of disorientation to avoid letting trauma seep into it and particularly the emotions related to the maternal.\n\nWith its reflections on the self caught between countries and languages, Nancy Huston’s essay Losing North leads itself to a psychoanalytical and textual exploration of loss and dis-orientation resulting from the experience of exile borne in part of a need to distance the self from childhood traumatic experiences, namely her mother’s walking out on the family, never to return.

Analysing both graphic adaptation and film, an expected finding is that Muth performs the adaptation sharing some techniques from the film of Lang, but also innovating in his own medium through the use of line, page layout and language. Furthermore, I discuss Linda Hutcheon's theory of adaptation, by taking into consideration the narrative codes that film and comics share and the way both media perform an 'illusion of movement,' each one in its own way. The interaction between comics and 'audience' not only as readers, but also as spectators through conceptual inferences puts comics into a hybrid status between printed and shown media. Hutcheon asserts that comic adaptations should be seen both as 'told' and 'shown' media. The chapter engages semiotic analysis to explore the role of the reader that includes actively constructing the narrative of graphic media. There are plenty of references to the deep bond between films and comics. In her book Los lenguajes del cómic 1 , Barbieri states that both media share some aspects of their respective languages; similarly Scott McCloud describes film photograms as very, very slow comics 2. The dialogue between both media allows producing plenty of adaptations in both ways: the Batman and Superman franchise is just the tip of the iceberg. Watchmen, Marvel superheroes and many others have opened a field of comic book to film adaptation that is growing every year. The same applies conversely: movies get adapted into comics. The chapter analyses this phenomenon, with particular reference to Fritz Lang's M adaptation into a graphic novel by Jon J. Muth. In most cases, the concept of adaptation has been related to a lower copy, an opaque version of an 'original,' a simplification. Researchers like Thomas Leitch have tried to revert this mistaken idea. In his article, Leitch casts down some prejudices that rule in both spectators' and critics' minds. He states that adaptations should be understood as an autonomous work which has its own singularities such as those provided by the medium the adapter is using: you can tell a story using different media (films, novels, comics, opera), and that decision will change the way the characters, the plot and the context of that story is developed. In her book A theory of adaptation, Linda Hutcheon also discusses this issue. This paper is part of the Book \"Framescapes: Graphic Narrative Intertexts\" (2016), available in http://www.inter-disciplinary.net/publishing/product/framescapes-graphic-narrative-intertexts/\n\nTalking animal stories are an unusual medium in portraying the relationship between humans and animals. The agent of the story is generally an animal, which despite various anthropomorphic qualities, bears clear traits of the non-human. Many British talking animal stories feature wild animals that are captured by humans and thus temporarily forced into a pet position, from which they encounter both adult humans and children. The consequence is a triangular relationship, in which the reader will often find not the animal but the adult human constructed as ‘the Other’, while the child, fascinated by the animal’s intrinsic wildness, instinctively bonds with the animal. In these stories, both child and animal often share an uncorrupted animal instinct and a naïve immediacy of experience. Often, child characters heal the (wounded) animal, and, by releasing it back into the wild, prove morally superior to patronizing adults rationally assessing the animal’s use or chances of survival. The child, on the other hand, either actively or in imagination seeks to enter the animal’s world. Both the animal and the child longing-to-be-animal are often constructed as pre-Christian and pre-enlightenment figures, unbound by adult rationality. Yet, in most of these stories, the child characters’ struggle to retain their innate animality proves futile; adults successfully trivialize or channel into imagination their children’s yet untamed animal instincts. The animal can escape back into the wild. The child, usually, cannot. The triangular relationships between animal, children, and adults in talking animal stories approach the animal-human bond from an unusual perspective. Additionally, they also reflect predominant constructions of childhood and of ‘the animal’, and both re-enact and challenge the controversial dichotomies of human/animal, instinct/reason, and nature/culture, and in doing so give voice to Western society’s intrinsic fascination with and fear of the animal ‘other’."
