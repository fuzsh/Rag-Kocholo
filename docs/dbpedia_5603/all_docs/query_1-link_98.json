        "text": "By Gregory N. Joseph\n\nROBERT WISE (1914–2005) was the Oscar-nominated film editor of Orson Welles’ “Citizen Kane,” which many describe as the greatest movie of all time, and subsequently went on to become a hugely respected director in his own right with a breathtakingly eclectic body of work that embraced horror, noir, Western, war, science fiction, sports, musicals and drama.\n\nIntimate stories or epics, it didn’t matter, and, when called upon, that most daunting of cinematic tasks, an effective mix of both, which precious few directors can do.\n\nHe won two Academy Awards each for “West Side Story” (1961) and “The Sound of Music” (1965) — for Best Picture and Best Director — box office-shattering musicals that couldn’t have been more different in style or approach. (He co-directed “West Side Story” with Jerome Robbins, who handled the musical and dance sequences in that film and shared the directing Oscar.)\n\nOther films directed by Wise include “The Curse of the Cat People” (1944), “The Body Snatcher” (1945), “Born to Kill” (1947), “The Set-Up” (1949), “The Day the Earth Stood Still” (1951), “Executive Suite” (1954), “Somebody Up There Likes Me” (1956), “Helen of Troy” (1956), “Run Silent, Run Deep” (1958), “I Want to Live!” (1958), “The Haunting” (1963), “The Sand Pebbles” (1966), “The Andromeda Strain” (1971), “The Hindenburg” (1975), and “Star Trek: The Motion Picture” (1979), the very first big screen version of that franchise, for which I met him for a profile I was writing to coincide with the release of that picture.\n\nRichard Attenborough, who appeared in “The Sand Pebbles,” expressed great admiration for Wise and described him as “a genuinely sweet man who loved his actors — but who had a steel rod for a spine.”\n\nI was soon to learn the truth of that.\n\nWise — who had been president of the Directors Guild of America (1971–75) and president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (1984–87), and who would go on to be honored with the American Film Institute’s Life Achievement Award in 1998 — was unconcerned about the worldwide tribe of Trekkies circling like hungry sharks if he didn’t get every detail just so in this first big-screen incarnation of that beloved franchise.\n\nTake the costumes, for instance.\n\n“I never saw the series,” he announced calmly, noting that he had changed the costumes because “the ones on the TV show were nothing.”\n\nI asked him about working with Steve McQueen on “The Sand Pebbles,” one of my favorite movies and one for which I thought McQueen deserved the Oscar as best actor (truth to tell, I had saved up for an entire summer to buy the film’s sumptuous sound track album by the terrific Jerry Goldsmith).\n\nSomehow our conversation turned to the film’s conclusion, in which McQueen’s character is killed. I delicately registered my disappointment at that turn of events.\n\n“Steve argued vehemently about that too — he didn’t think the character should die, either,” Wise admitted. “So I shot it both ways.” It was clear he had never intended to use anything but the ending showing the character’s death despite the star’s objections.\n\nAt another point, we discussed “The Sound of Music” and dubbing the voice of Christopher Plummer, who at that juncture, at least, was not recalling the film with affection, referring to it as “the sound of mucus.”\n\nWise smiled. “Chris’ voice was very good — but just not quite good enough.”\n\nIt was not the first time Wise would do this. Marni Nixon — who would ironically have a supporting role as Sister Sophia in “Sound of Music” — would do Natalie Wood’s singing voice as Maria in “West Side Story,” which also featured Jimmy Bryant doing Richard Beymer’s singing voice as Tony, and Tucker Smith as Ice and the singing voice of Russ Tamblyn’s Riff for “Jet Song” (although Tamblyn did his own singing for “Gee, Officer Krupke!” and “Quintet”).\n\nNo apologies.\n\nWise, who worked with some of the biggest names (and egos) in Hollywood, forged a reputation as an exacting craftsman known for meticulous preparation and legendary professionalism while honoring whatever disparate genre he was working in — and somehow staying within budget, which not all directors, even the very, very best can do (see Orson Welles).\n\nSteel spine, indeed."
