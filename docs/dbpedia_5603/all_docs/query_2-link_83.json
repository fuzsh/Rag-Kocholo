In fact, the odds are against you.” – Mastery\n\n“When you show yourself to the world and display your talents, you naturally stir all kinds of resentment, envy, and other manifestations of insecurity… you cannot spend your life worrying about the petty feelings of others.” – The 48 Laws of Power\n\n“Understand: people will constantly attack you in life. One of their main weapons will be to instill in you doubts about yourself – your worth, your abilities, your potential. They will often disguise this as their objective opinion, but invariably it has a political purpose – they want to keep you down.” – The 50th Law\n\n“When our emotions are engaged, we often have trouble seeing things as they are.” – The Art of Seduction\n\n“People are more complicated than the masks they wear in society.” – The Art of Seduction\n\n“Grand strategy is the art of looking beyond the present battle and calculating ahead.

I prefer to profit by others’ experience.” – The 48 Laws of Power\n\n“Sadness of any sort is also seductive, particularly if it seems deep-rooted, even spiritual, rather than needy or pathetic—it makes people come to you.” – The Art of Seduction\n\n“You must understand the following: In order to master a field, you must love the subject and feel a profound connection to it. Your interest must transcend the field itself and border on the religious.” – Mastery\n\n“Events in life mean nothing if you do not reflect on them in a deep way, and ideas from books are pointless if they have no application to life as you live it.” – The 33 Strategies of War\n\n“Power is a game, and in games you do not judge your opponents by their intentions but by the effects of their actions.” – The 48 Laws of Power\n\n“Do not wait for a coronation; the greatest emperors crown themselves.” – The 48 Laws of Power\n\n“Any man who tries to be good all the time is bound to come to ruin among the great number who are not good.” – The 48 Laws of Power\n\n“It is not much good being wise among fools and sane among lunatics.” – The 48 Laws of Power\n\n“It is your own bad strategies, not the unfair opponent, that are to blame for your failures.
