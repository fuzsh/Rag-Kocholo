        "text": "Picture Offers Lesson on Foreign Ventures\n\nBy BOSLEY CROWTHER\n\nIt is likely that audiences seeing the film Robert Wise has made from Richard McKenna's popular novel, \"The Sand Pebbles,\" will not see it simply as a tale of the involvement of a United States Navy gunboat on the Yangtze River in China in 1926.\n\nAlthough it gives a fascinating picture, characteristically exotic and confused, of the challenges to our tiny forces when they found themselves suddenly exposed to the explosion of the Nationalist revolution engineered by Chiang Kai-shek, it is not as historical romance that it is likely to grab the audience, but as a weird sort of hint of what has happened and is happening ln Vietnam.\n\nThe environment is pertinent in this picture, which opened at the Rivoli last night. Broad, ocher Oriental rivers spreading among gray green hills and cut by a shallow-draft gunboat flying the American flag; old cities crowded with people, yellow faces in black blouses and student caps, peasants toiling slowly in rice paddies - in these we sense a realm of present peril.\n\nIn the shock of the gunboat's captain as he finds his long-time prestige and power suddenly unbalanced and assaulted by the rebellious Chinese, we sense the reverberating tremors of our own, national shock and dismay when we found ourselves grimly confronted with a more recent Oriental responsibility.\n\nIn the ire and resentment of his crewmen as they have to take on the task of fetching American citizens out of the bristling hinterland, we feel the tightening muscles and the quivering nerves of American men in Vietnam. And in the open suspicion and frank withdrawal of the focal \"China sailor\" in this case, we catch the current vibrations of antagonism towards our present jam.\n\nThus, because it is so graphic and metaphorically so aligned with our current dilemma in the Far East, \"The Sand Pebbles\" as a film has a great deal more pertinence and likely impact than it has as a book. And this realization compels us to scan it the more inquisitively. What is it these fellows are saying, in\n\nThe Cast THE SAND PEBBLES: screenplay by Robert Anderson; from the novel by Richard McKenna; Produced and directed by Robert Wise; an Argyle Solar Production presented by 20th Century-Fox. At the Rivoll Theater, Broadway and 49th Street. Running time: 191 minutes.\n\nJake Holman........Steve McQueen\n\nFrenchy................Richard Attenborough\n\nLieut. Collins.........Richard Crenna\n\nShirley Eckert........Candice Bergen\n\nPo-han.................Mako\n\nMr. Jameson.........Larry Gates\n\nEnsign Bordelles....Charles Robinson\n\nStawski................Simon Oakland\n\nHarris...................Ford Rainey\n\nCho-Jen...............Paul Chinpae\n\nChien...................Tommy Lee\n\nMama Chunk.........Beulah Quo\n\nVictor Shu.............James Hong\n\nBronson................Joe Turkel\n\nCrosley................Gavin MacLeod\n\nShanahan.............Joseph di Reda\n\nMajor Chin............Richard Loo\n\nthis brooding and turbulent film, which ranges from crew's mess confrontations to the bloody business of breaking through a river blockade? They are saying, in implications that might be more forcefully arranged in the script that Robert Anderson has shaken loose from the book, that the use of American forces to protect our interests and our nationals in a foreign land, especially one in political turmoil, is a fruitless and ironic enterprise.\n\nThey are saying that the diplomatic systems of showing the flag and saving face and rushing to the rescue of nationals (missionaries in this case) who don't want to be saved and especially the old vestigial practice of taking a superior attitude towards an \"inferior\" race - are arrogrant, hypocritical and conducive to remote, vainglorious death.\n\nThis is particularly spoken in the monosyllabic things said and in the desperate deeds done by the sailor who stands out from all the rest of the goof-offs, yardbirds and barflies, in the crew of the wheezy San Pablo - the Sand Pebbles, as she is tagged. He is a lonely, alienated machinist's mate"
