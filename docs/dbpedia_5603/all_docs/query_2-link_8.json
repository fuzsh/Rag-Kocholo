        "text": "Oliver Stone (born September 15, 1946, New York, New York, U.S.) is an American film director, screenwriter, and producer known for his ambitious and often controversial movies.\n\nStone, the son of a wealthy stockbroker, was raised in New York City. He briefly studied at Yale University before dropping out to teach English in South Vietnam. Upon his return, Stone lived in Mexico for a year and again attended Yale for a short period. In 1967, during the Vietnam War, he enlisted in the U.S. Army. He distinguished himself in combat, earning two Purple Hearts and a Bronze Star. Stone then enrolled in film school at New York University (B.A., 1971), studying under director Martin Scorsese.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nOscar-Worthy Movie Trivia\n\nStone was deeply affected by his war experiences, and his student films, such as Last Year in Viet Nam (1971), dealt directly with the consequences of the Vietnam conflict. After graduating, he directed the horror movies Seizure! (1974) and The Hand (1981), the latter of which starred Michael Caine. Stone also began experimenting with screenwriting, and he won an Academy Award for best adapted screenplay for Midnight Express (1978), which was based on the true story of a man brutally abused while imprisoned for drug smuggling in Turkey.\n\nStone devoted much of the early 1980s to writing screenplays, including Conan the Barbarian (1982); Scarface (1983), which was directed by Brian De Palma and starred Al Pacino and Michelle Pfeiffer; and Year of the Dragon (1985). He returned to directing with Salvador (1986), which he also wrote. In the film, a journalist (played by James Woods) documents the atrocities committed during the El Salvador uprisings of 1980–81. Stone again drew on the trauma of the Vietnam War in Platoon (1986), for which he won another Academy Award, this time for directing. The film navigates the perils of war from the perspective of a new recruit who quickly realizes that the idealism that motivated his decision to enlist was misguided. Stone drew upon personal experience once more for Wall Street (1987), using memories of his father’s career as a stockbroker to conjure an indictment of the greed and deceit governing the financial world. In 1988 he adapted Eric Bogosian’s Off-Broadway play Talk Radio to film.\n\nStone emphasized the continuing ramifications of the Vietnam War with Born on the Fourth of July (1989). The film, based on the autobiography of Vietnam veteran Ron Kovic, chronicles the evolution of a young man, played by Tom Cruise, from patriotic soldier to paraplegic antiwar activist. Stone won an Academy Award for directing that movie and received a fourth career nomination for his writing. The year 1991 saw the release of both JFK, a polarizing investigation of the circumstances surrounding the assassination of Pres. John F. Kennedy, and The Doors, a stylish account of the rise and fall of the titular American rock band. For JFK Stone used actual footage of from the Zapruder film as well as recreated scenes in a way that some say added to the conspiracy furor surrounding the Kennedy assassination. InHeaven & Earth (1993), Stone approached the Vietnam War and its aftermath from the perspective of a young Vietnamese woman.\n\nStone again courted controversy with Natural Born Killers (1994), a film, written by Quentin Tarantino, about the savagely violent exploits of a married couple, played by Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis. While Stone claimed that the film was meant to be critical of sensationalized violence, some critics found it guilty of exactly what it purported to condemn. Stone then cast Anthony Hopkins in the title role of Nixon (1995), a measured take on the life of the U.S. president. He also developed the screenplay for Evita (1996), an adaptation of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical about Argentine politician Eva Perón (played by Madonna).\n\nStone revisited some of his favored motifs, power and violence, in Any Given Sunday (1999), about professional football, and in Alexander (2004), a poorly received biography of Alexander the Great starring Colin Farrell. World Trade Center (2006), a retelling of the events of September 11, 2001, from the viewpoint of two police officers, returned Stone to the center of public debate. While the film was critically acclaimed, some questioned the propriety of making the film so soon after the tragedy. W. (2008), his biopic of Pres. George W. Bush, drew ire from both extremes of the political spectrum for its refusal to pass definitive judgment, positive or negative, on its subject. Stone later directed Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps (2010), a sequel to the 1987 film that was set amid the global financial crisis of 2008, and Savages (2012), an ensemble thriller about marijuana trafficking that, in its depiction of seedy mayhem, was reminiscent of his earlier U Turn (1997). Snowden (2016) centers on the real-life American intelligence officer who exposed the NSA’s secret surveillance programs by leaking classified documents."
