Parents may visit imaginationlibrary.com to sign up.\n\nDolly Parton's Imagination Library mails books to more than 2 million children a month and must place book orders a month in advance. Depending on when you register your child, it may take up to eight to twelve weeks for the first book to arrive. After that, the books will come every month.\n\nFor example, if you registered your child on January 6th and were approved by your local affiliate in January, you would receive your first book in March."
