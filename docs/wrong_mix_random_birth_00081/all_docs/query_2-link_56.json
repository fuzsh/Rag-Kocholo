        "text": "Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library is a partnership with the community to provide free, age-appropriate books to all children ages birth to five years, who live within the Westmoreland zip code area.\n\nFund details…\n\nImproving early childhood literacy creates opportunities for children to thrive and succeed in school and help their communities grow and prosper. The Imagination Library helps supply books to families, regardless of income and background.\n\nWestmoreland has a DPIL program, established through the Caring Community Foundation by the commitment of local donors. The Dollywood Foundation supports the program by providing the structure and book selection, procurement and fulfillment processes. Local funders and partners cover the at-cost book and mailing expenses and local promotional costs for children registered in the coverage area (zip code 66549).\n\nWe mail books to all children monthly, so expenses are ongoing and donations are continually needed. We want to build an endowment to provide a sustainable funding model to be able to support early childhood literacy in Westmoreland, now and into the future. $10,000 will establish an endowment to accomplish this!"
