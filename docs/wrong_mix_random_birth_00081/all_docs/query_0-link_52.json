The flagship program of the The Dollywood Foundation has mailed well over 100 million free books in Australia, Canada, The Republic of Ireland, United Kingdom and the United States. Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library mails more that 1.4 million high-quality age-appropriate books each month to registered children from birth to age five. Dolly envisioned creating a lifelong love of reading, inspiring them to dream. The impact of the program has been widely researched and results suggest positive increase in key early childhood literacy metrics. Penguin Random House is the exclusive publisher for Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library.\n\nFor more information, please visit imaginationlibrary.com.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nHow long does it take to start receiving books?\n\nHow do I know if my child was accepted into the program?\n\nAddress Change\n\nI was told my local Imagination Library is closing because of lack of funds.
