        "text": "History of the Program:\n\nThanks to generous donors like Kathy Evans, the Morgenstern Family, the Muskegon County Great Start Collaborative, Country Dairy, and all those who donated through the Nichols \"Matching in March\" campaign, we are able to bring this wonderful program to families in Muskegon and Oceana counties.\n\nKathy was awarded the Patricia B. Johnson Award for Community Leadership and Innovative Grantmaking in 2014, which included an Impact Grant from the foundation to the nonprofit of her choice. She chose United Way of the Lakeshore, using the funds to help launch the Dolly Parton's Imagination Library program in our community. The Morgenstern children and grandchildren made a donation to United Way of the Lakeshore in honor of Richard and Nancy Morgenstern as a Christmas gift that same year. This generous donation was also used to help establish the Dolly Partonâ€™s Imagination Library program. A grant from the Muskegon County Great Start Collaborative rounded out the initial funding to get the Library up and running. With their help, we were able to start a pilot program for children age birth to five in Holton and Muskegon Heights.\n\nIn 2017, Nichols generously offered to match up to $25,000 in donations during March is Reading month, raising nearly $50,000 to expand the program! In 2018, Nichols generously offered another match - up to $35,000! Thank you, Nichols, for your continued commitment to our littlest learners.\n\nWe are so grateful for the support of those who understand the importance of having this program in our community!\n\nIn 2018, Country Dairy generously offered to match up to $5,000 in donations for children enrolled in the Dolly Parton Imagination Library Program that live in Oceana County. Since then, they have continued to be a great partner and support for our littlest readers."
