        "text": "In 2021, The Headwaters Foundation and Rappahannock County Public Library were thrilled to bring Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library to the youngest readers in Rappahannock County. Our community became the 39th county in Virginia to offer this program, thanks to contributions from the Phillip and Penny Kardis Family Fund and the Friends of the Rappahannock County Library.\n\nSince launching in 1995, Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library has become the preeminent early childhood book gifting program in the world. The flagship program of The Dollywood Foundation, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, has gifted well over 160 million free books in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, and The Republic of Ireland.\n\nThe Imagination Library mails more than 1.8 million high-quality, age-appropriate books each month to registered children from birth to age five. Dolly envisioned creating a lifelong love of reading, inspiring them to dream. The impact of the program has been widely researched and results suggest positive increases in key early childhood literacy metrics. Penguin Random House is the exclusive publisher for Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library."
