        "text": "Greenbelt, MD – Dolly Parton’s 30+ year legacy of supporting early literacy across the country is celebrated in a new documentary, “The Library That Dolly Built” (2020, not rated, 72 min.), which will receive its local premiere at the Old Greenbelt Theatre on April 2 at 8 pm. The film is a feature-length documentary, covering the history, impact, and future of Dolly Parton’s worldwide book gifting program. The family-friendl screening will be free and open to the public, and it is co-presented by the Prince George’s County Memorial Library System (PGCMLS) and the Old Greenbelt Theater, in association with Land Grant Films. Mayor Colin A. Byrd of Greenbelt, Maryland and Roberta Phillips, CEO, Prince George’s County Memorial Library System, will deliver opening remarks.\n\n“The Library That Dolly Built” showcases the music of Dolly Parton and is narrated by actress and author Danica McKellar. It includes footage of behind-the-scenes operations for Imagination Library, original interviews, and depicts the profound impact of providing 100 million free books to children around the world. John Gibeau who runs an Imagination Library program in rural Minnesota explains through tears how some children in his community only have access to books because of the program. His town has no library, school or bookstore.\n\nThrough the Books from Birth program, PGCMLS partners with Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library to provide one free book per month to children under the age of five who reside in Prince George’s County. Children are able to build their personal libraries and develop advance early literacy skills in preparation for entering school. The PGCMLS Books from Birth program has provided 15,119 children with over 217,500 free books, demonstrating the tremendous local reach of the Imagination Library.\n\nDolly Parton has gifted her story, her music, her inspiration and her Imagination Library to people throughout the world. Her Imagination Library, however, will be remembered as the sweetest gift of all. Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library is now active in all 50 states in the U.S. and five countries and delivers more than 1.5 million free, age-appropriate books to children every month.\n\nAbout Prince George’s County Memorial Library System\n\nThe Prince George’s County Memorial Library System (PGCMLS), consisting of 19 branches, offers strategies for lifelong learning.

Completed in 1938, the Old Greenbelt Theatre is an iconic building in Greenbelt, a federally planned New-Deal-era community. The Theatre is remarkable not only for its original design but also for having survived eras of economic instability without being split into a duplex or a different kind of venue altogether, as has been the fate of so many historic single-screen cinemas. The building is owned by the City of Greenbelt, and the nonprofit organization Friends of Greenbelt Theatre now operates the Old Greenbelt Theatre. The lobby and facade of the Old Greenbelt Theatre was remodeled in 2014-2015. The original auditorium was renovated (with new seats, screen, upgraded sound, and other improvements) in 2019. This year, the Friends of Greenbelt Theatre are adding a permanent, state-of-the-art Screening Room and Media Arts Literacy Lab in the storefront next door to the cinema at 125 Centerway, part of its Beyond the Screen Initiative.\n\nAbout PGCMLS Books from Birth\n\nBooks from Birth was launched in 2017 as a partnership between the Prince George’s County Memorial Library System and Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library. The program provides children under the age of five who reside in Prince George’s County with one free book per month to build a home library and support early literacy. Books from Birth and PGCMLS’ services are essential to increasing early literacy, promoting kindergarten readiness, and ensuring that Prince George’s County is a child-friendly county. Families can register for Books from Birth at pgcmls.info/freebooks.\n\nAbout Land Grant Films\n\nLand Grant Films is a documentary program housed in the School of Journalism and Electronic Media at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.

About The Imagination Library Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library is a book gifting program that mails free, high-quality books to children from birth until they begin school, no matter their family’s income. After launching in 1995, the program grew quickly. First books were only distributed to children living in Sevier County, Tennessee where Dolly grew up. It became such a success that in 2000 a national replication effort was underway. By 2003, Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library had mailed one million books. It would prove to be the first of over 135 million books gifted to children around the world. Dolly’s home state of Tennessee pledged to pursue statewide coverage in 2004 and global expansion was on the horizon. After the United States, the program launched in Canada in 2006 followed by the United Kingdom in 2007, Australia in 2013 and the Republic of Ireland in 2019.\n\nAbout The Dollywood Foundation\n\nThe Dollywood Foundation was created in 1988 by Dolly Parton to inspire the children in her home county to achieve educational success. Initial efforts focused on decreasing the dropout rate in the county’s high school. In the early 90’s Dolly promised every 7th-grade and 8th-grade student she would personally give them $500 if they graduated from high school. This effort, called the Buddy Program, reduced the dropout rate for these two classes from 35% to 6%. More importantly, the program catalyzed the community to provide additional resources to sustain this improvement in the dropout rate. In 2016, The Dollywood Foundation led Dolly's efforts to assist families who lost their homes during the devastating wildfires which swept through her home county. The Foundation's My People Fund distributed over $12,000,000 In direct assistance to over 900 families In Sevier County.
