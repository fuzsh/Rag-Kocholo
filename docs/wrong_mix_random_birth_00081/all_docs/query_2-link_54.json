        "text": "An Early Start to a Lifetime Love of Books\n\nFounded in 1995, Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library has been honored with many awards, from the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval, Best Practices Award from the Library of Congress Literacy Awards, the National Education Association, the Carnegie Medal of Philanthropy, and others. The program now reaches two million books mailed each month with one in seven children under the age of five in the US receiving Imagination Library books. In February 2024, Colorado’s statewide Imagination Library program celebrated its millionth book mailed since its 2021 launch.\n\nDolly Parton’s Imagination Library’s mission statement is: “Create a love for books and reading – give every child the start they need in education and life.” Children who are enrolled in the program receive free, high quality, and age appropriate books chosen by a panel of early literacy experts.\n\nEarly Literacy as a Community Value\n\nHigh Plains Bank has been involved in Imagination Library since 2013, providing this valuable resource to customers in every branch location including Bennett, Flagler, Keenesburg, Longmont, and Wiggins. This year, the bank joined forces with the Longmont Community Foundation as the designated non-profit organization making it possible to mail free books to High Plains Bank customers and their families.\n\n\"We're proud to partner with High Plains Bank and Dolly Parton's Imagination Library to provide the joy of reading to many more children in our community,\" shares Eric Hozempa, Longmont Community Foundation CEO.\n\nShared Values to Change Lives “Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library is thrilled to be in collaboration with High Plains Bank,” says Michelle Anthony, Regional Director, The Dollywood Foundation. “At High Plains Bank, they say family first, then community, then the bank. Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library shares these same values making this a perfect partnership!”\n\nMost early education and literacy experts agree that access to books not only increases early literacy rates, but fosters a love for books and promotes a culture of reading at home.\n\n“High Plains Bank is proud to participate in Imagination Library,” says John Creighton, High Plains Bank CEO. “Fostering a love of reading and lifelong learning has been a family passion for many generations. This initiative aligns with our goal to help communities thrive. We are grateful for the Longmont Community Foundation's help to make this initiative a reality.”"
