        "text": "Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library helps boost your children’s education by providing free children’s books. By reading regularly with your children during their preschool years, you can give them a tremendous boost toward a successful education.\n\nDolly Parton’s Imagination Library will provide age-appropriate books for you to read with your child. There are many reasons parents do not read to their child, but we can eliminate one of them. Every child will receive books of their own, at no cost, thanks to United Way of Cumberland County, Partnership for Children of Cumberland County, and Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library.\n\nEach month a new, carefully selected book will be mailed in your child’s name directly to your home. They can look forward to new and exciting reading adventures from Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library each month.\n\nPlease use the following registration form only if your child resides in Cumberland County. If you have any questions email dollypartonprogram@unitedway-cc.org\n\n*The children of Cumberland County, North Carolina are able to receive free books each month due to generous individual donors and grants from organizations like Association of Bragg Spouses, Bragg N’ Barn Thrift Shop, Florence Rogers Charitable Trust, Junior League of Fayetteville, and the Youth Growth Stock Trust."
