        "text": "What are online parent accounts?\n\nParent Accounts provide authorized adults the ability to login and access information and features such as:\n\nChild Status - Allows the authorized adult to see if their child is currently receiving books or not.\n\nEdit Address - This feature allows the authorized adult to edit their child's address.\n\nAffiliate Info - See the local affiliate partner's contact information that pays for the books and mailing.\n\nBooks Mailed - The authorized adult can see the titles mailed each month as well as the dates each title was mailed.\n\nHow do I get my login information?\n\nIf an email address was added to your child's record upon registration, this will serve as your username. If you do not know the password, please request a new password using the New Password/Forgot Password link on the login page. If your link has expired or is invalid, you can request a new link at any time by visitingwww.imaginationlibrary.com/bos\n\nHow do I change my address?\n\nIf you need to update or remove a child's record from the system, please use the online system www.imaginationlibrary.com/bos. Please also remember to complete an official USPS change of address, even if you are moving within state. Here is a link to more USPS information: https://moversguide.usps.com\n\nI'm moving out of state. How do I find an affiliate in my new area?\n\nUse this link to check availability in your new area: https://imaginationlibrary.com/check-availability/\n\nHow do I know if my child was accepted into the program?\n\nIf you provide an email address with your registration you will be notified via email when the registration is approved or entered into our system. If you do not have an email address you will need to contact your local affiliate to find out more information but it can take up to 90 days for books to start arriving after approval.\n\nHow long does it take to start getting books?\n\nMailing files are processed at the beginning of each month for books to be mailed from Tennessee the following month. It can take up to 90 days from date of registration to start receiving books.\n\nWhy is our book late? / Why haven’t we received our book this month?\n\nUnfortunately we have received many reports of regional and national mail delays. Books are arriving, but not within the normal time frames. The Dollywood Foundation has let us know that the USPS has assured them that following recent challenges, things are catching back up and should return to normal soon.\n\nAre the books age appropriate?"
