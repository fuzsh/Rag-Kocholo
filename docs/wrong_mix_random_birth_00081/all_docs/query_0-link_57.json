        "text": "Imagination Library provides children with a free new book every month through their fifth birthday.\n\nDolly Parton started Imagination Library in 1995 to fight illiteracy in her eastern Tennessee community. Research shows that disadvantaged children come to school years behind their peers in pre-reading skills, and rarely catch up, and that the children still struggling to read in 3rd grade are the ones who eventually drop out.\n\nEvaluations indicate that Imagination Library is getting kids more interested in reading, as well as, getting parents more comfortable reading to their children.\n\nChildren are mailed an age-appropriate book directly to their homes each month to build their own private library. Only 2 out of 10 low-income children in Polk County enter Kindergarten ready to read. For that reason, low-income sites are targeted when enrolling children.\n\nLocal sponsors currently include the Friends of the Bartow Library, Bartow Rotary, Lake Wales Library Association and Floridaâ€™s Natural Growers Foundation.\n\nThe program is currently available for all of Polk, Hardee and Highlands counties. The average sponsorship cost per child in Polk County is only $2.50 per month and a $3,000 sponsorship provides 100 children with one book per month for a full year!"
