        "text": "Marion's Literacy Success Plan\n\nMarion Imagination Library (register below)\n\n+\n\nMy First Library Card\n\n+\n\nReading 20 minutes daily.\n\nThe Dolly Parton Imagination Library of Ohio started a new chapter in early childhood literacy across Ohio. Through a partnership with Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library to put more books in the hands of Ohio’s children, we are working to ensure that every student enters kindergarten ready to succeed. In just a few minutes, you can give your child the gift of books!\n\nFor those children living in MARION COUNTY, it must be a PARENT (or legal guardian) of the child who registers the child, NOT a GRANDPARENT.\n\nWhat Is Imagination Library?\n\nEach month a new, carefully selected book will be mailed in your child's name directly to your home. The first book is always the children's classic The Little Engine That Could. Best of all, it is a FREE GIFT to your child because your county partner is raising the funds to make it happen.\n\nWho Is Eligible?\n\nChildren under the age of five in Marion County.\n\nWhat Are My Responsibilities?\n\nBe a resident of Marion County\n\nSubmit an official registration via the button above or the paper English form, Spanish form completely filled out by the authorized adult.\n\nNotify Marion Public Library any time your address changes. Books are mailed to the address listed on the account.\n\nRead with your child and have fun! Let's Read 20 for additional help and literacy-related activities.\n\nWhen Will I Receive Books?\n\nEight to ten weeks after your registration form has been received, books will begin arriving at your home and will continue until your child turns five or you move out of the covered area.\n\nHow can you help us keep the books coming for Marion County children?\n\nGrow our fund...\n\nWe have set up a fund at Marion Community Foundation for community members to contribute to this great program that creates a foundation for literacy success.\n\n--> ANY amount of donation is acceptable - $5, $10, $20... All funds will go toward delivering books\n\n--> $26 covers the cost of a child receiving the books for one year = 12 books\n\n--> $130 covers the cost of a child receiving the books from age 0 till they turn age 5 = 60 books.\n\nYou can make your donation online to the MARION COMMUNITY FOUNDATION fund for Marion Imagination Library.\n\nYou can deliver/mail a check or cash donation to Marion Community Foundation, 504 S. State Street, Marion, Ohio 43302\n\nMore info available on this downloadable DONOR SHEET.\n\nMarion Public Library is proud to PARTNER with other local agencies to ensure Marion County's participation in this literacy initiative.\n\nWe thank these major local contributors:\n\nDr. Dalsukh A. and Dr. lla Madia\n\nAnonymous\n\nMarion Rotary Club members\n\n100 Women Who Care members\n\nDayspring Wesleyan Church\n\nRay & Charlotte Baldauf Charitable Fund\n\nUnited Way of North Central Ohio, Inc.\n\nMid Ohio Energy Cooperative Community Fund\n\nMarion Junior Service Guild\n\nMolly & Larry Geissler\n\nPOET Never Satisfied Grant\n\nAmerican Legion Club #162\n\nStephen J.
