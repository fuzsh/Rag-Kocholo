        "text": "Country music legend Dolly Parton has said her charity will donate $1,000 (Â£797) a month to families affected by devastating wildfires in Tennessee.\n\nThe singer said she would provide help \"until they get back up on their feet\".\n\n\"I've always believed that charity begins at home,\" Parton said in a video statement.\n\nAt least seven people have been killed in the fires in Sevier County, Tennessee, and around the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.\n\nParton's Dollywood Foundation has set up a fund, external where people can donate to help victims of the fires.\n\n\"I know it's been a trying time for my people, and this assistance will help,\" she said.\n\nThe wildfires came to the doorstep of Dollywood, Parton's theme park in Pigeon Forge, Sevier County.\n\nA spokesman said guests were evacuated from some of its properties, and that several cabins and holiday structures were damaged.\n\nAround 45 people have been treated in hospital as a result of the wildfires, and over 700 buildings have been damaged.\n\nMandatory evacuations are under way around Gatlinburg, a city seven miles (11 km) southeast of Pigeon Forge.\n\nParton, 70, appeared in a public service advertisement on Sunday, asking people nearby to take steps to avoid spreading the fire.\n\nLater, she spoke of her misery at the toll the blazes had taken.\n\n\"I have been watching the terrible fires in the Great Smoky Mountains, and I am heartbroken.\n\n\"I am praying for all the families affected by the fire - and the firefighters who are working so hard to keep everyone safe,\" she said."
