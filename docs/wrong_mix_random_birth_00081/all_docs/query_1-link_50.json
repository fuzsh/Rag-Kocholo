        "text": "The Dollywood Foundation will donate $1,000 a month for six months to Sevier County families who lost their homes in the wildfires, the organization announced on Wednesday night.\n\n\"As you may know by now, there have been terrible wildfires in the Great Smoky Mountains, the same mountains where I grew up and where my people call home,\" Dolly Parton wrote in a statement. \"I have always believed that charity begins at home, and my home is someplace special. That's why I've asked my Dollywood companies ... to help me establish the 'My People Fund.' \"\n\nWhile damage is still being assessed, several hundred families are currently without homes â€“ lost to multiple wildfires that ravaged portions of Gatlinburg, Pigeon Forge and Sevierville.\n\n\"We wanted to provide a hand up to those families who have lost everything in the fires,\" Parton said. \"I know it has been a trying time for my people, and this assistance will help them get back on their feet.\"\n\nThe Dollywood Foundation is accepting donations to contribute to the My People fund. To donate, visit www.dollywoodfoundation.org.\n\nChecks can be mailed to the Dollywood Foundation, 2700 Dollywood Parks Blvd., Pigeon Forge, TN 37863.\n\nMore information will be released on Friday.\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nPREVIOUS STORY:\n\nDollywood is poised to make a significant contribution to help with the recovery from the deadly wildfire that swept through Sevier County on this week, County Mayor Larry Waters said Wednesday night.\n\nAt a vigil for victims, Waters said he expects an announcement at 9 p.m. but did not offer any details. A spokesman for Dollywood would not comment on the announcement but advised people to tune into Dolly Parton's NBC special \"Christmas of Many Colors,\" which is scheduled to begin at 9 p.m.\n\nAt least seven people were killed by the wildfires that pushed into Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge on Monday and Tuesday. Officials said hundreds of homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed.\n\nMore State Headlines:"
