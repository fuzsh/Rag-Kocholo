        "text": "The Imagination Library of Kansas is Now Statewide\n\nThe magic of Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library is open to any Kansas child from birth to their 5th birthday. Children receive free, age-appropriate books mailed directly to their home every month. Our goal is for every Kansas child to receive high-quality books that will nurture a love for reading and continue to enrich their lives throughout school and beyond! Enroll now through this easy form.\n\nImagination Library of Kansas 501(c)(3)\n\nOverview\n\nFollowing the state partner model for Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library set forth by The Dollywood Foundation, the Kansas Children’s Cabinet and Trust Fund received approval from the Kansas Legislature to establish an Imagination Library of Kansas 501(c)(3). The Imagination Library of Kansas 501(c)(3) will serve in the capacity of a fundraising entity for the statewide program of Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library as a non-profit, tax-exempt organization. The 501(c)(3)’s purpose is to ensure the sustainability of the Imagination Library of Kansas by facilitating partnerships with the private sector at the state level.\n\nAbout Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library\n\nSince launching in 1995, Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library has become the preeminent early childhood book-gifting program in the world. The flagship program of The Dollywood Foundation, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, has gifted over 200 million free books in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, and The Republic of Ireland. This is achieved through funding shared by The Dollywood Foundation and Local Community Partners. The Imagination Library mails more than 2.5 million high-quality, age-appropriate books directly to children’s homes each month. Each child enrolled in the program receives one book per month from birth to age five–at no cost to families. Dolly envisioned creating a lifelong love of reading and inspiring children to Dream More, Learn More, Care More and Be More.\n\nThe program’s impact has been widely researched, and results demonstrate its positive impact on early childhood development and literacy skills. Penguin Random House is the exclusive publisher of Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library.\n\nLearn more about Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library."
