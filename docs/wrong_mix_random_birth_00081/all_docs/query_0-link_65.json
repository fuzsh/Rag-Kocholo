This initiative is dedicated to fostering a love for reading among children from birth to age five.\n\nEvery month, enrolled children receive a carefully selected, age-appropriate book mailed directly to their homes, absolutely free of charge.\n\nWhy is this Program Special?\n\nIt sounds almost too simple to be true, but by reading regularly with your children during their early years, you are giving them the biggest boost toward a successful education they will ever get.\n\nBy offering the Dolly Parton Imagination Library to kids in our community, United Way aims to inspire a lifelong love for reading from the very beginning of a child's journey. We hope to enhance early learning experiences, nurture creativity, and promote the building blocks of literacy through high-quality books.\n\nWho is Eligible?\n\nThe program is open to all children under the age of 5 who live in Champaign County, Illinois. It is completely free to families. Your child can look forward to new and exciting reading adventures from Dolly Parton's Imagination Library until they turn five years old as long as you live within a covered geographic area."
