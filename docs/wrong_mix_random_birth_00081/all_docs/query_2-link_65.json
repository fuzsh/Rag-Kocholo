        "text": "We all know the importance of early childhood development, but not all families have access to the tools or resources they need for their children to have a successful start. For example, 88% of children who are not reading by kindergarten still struggle with language skills in grade 3.\n\nWhat is Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library?\n\nDolly Parton’s dream was to foster a love of reading among preschoolers and their families. She wanted to ensure that every child would have access to quality books, regardless of their family’s income. This initiative which launched in 1996 is now a national and global program managed by the Dollywood Foundation and brought to you by United Way Blackhawk Region.\n\nUnited Way Blackhawk Region is committed to childhood development and has made Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library available to families in Beloit, Edgerton and Janesville – for FREE.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nDolly Parton’s Imagination Library mails each enrolled child one high quality, age-appropriate book every month from birth until their 5th birthday. Many of the families enrolled might not be able to afford such a luxury. To reach as many of these children as possible, you can sponsor a child for $30 a year.\n\nWho chooses the books?\n\nEach year, the esteemed Blue Ribbon Book Selection Committee, a specially selected panel of early childhood literacy experts, is responsible for reviewing hundreds of potential titles for inclusion in Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library.\n\nWho can receive books?\n\nAny child, birth to age 5 who lives in Beloit, Edgerton or Janesville is eligible to receive books. However, funding is limited. A waiting list will be instituted when enrollment reaches capacity.\n\nHow much do the books cost and who pays for the books?\n\nThere is no cost to the families who receive books. Books are paid for by the Dolly Parton Foundation and as the proud local sponsor, United Way Blackhawk Region pays for postage and handling to mail books to children’s homes. Funds are donated by our generous community, through businesses and individual donations.\n\nI’d like to register my child for Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library!\n\nI’d like to give the gift of reading by donating to Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library!\n\nDid you know that it only costs $30 to support a child’s participation in the program for a year or $150 to support a child from birth to age 5?\n\nDonations can be made payable to United Way Blackhawk Region’s Imagination Library by check or you may donate online via PayPal. (You’ll be redirected to the Imagination Library website; once there, click PayPal button.)\n\nDonations will be directed first to children who live in the same community as the donor. Should the donor reside outside of Beloit, Edgerton or Janesville, the donation will be directed to the community with the greatest need/waiting list.\n\nI have more questions …\n\nCheck out the Frequently Asked Questions about Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library (PDF). If you have additional questions, please contact Laura Nilson at 608.314.8420 or email lnilson@lubr.org.\n\nSpecial Thanks\n\nTo the Dolly Parton Foundation, our generous sponsors, community partners, and all early-literacy advocates."
