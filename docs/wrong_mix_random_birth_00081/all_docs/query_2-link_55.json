        "text": "Your donation supports the D41 Kids Foundation involvement with the \"Dolly Parton Imagination Library\" program.\n\nThe Dolly Parton Imagination Library is our affiliate program that puts books into the hands and hearts of children under the age of 5 who reside within the boundaries of Glen Ellyn School District 41. Specially-selected, age-appropriate, high-quality books are delivered to registered children each month. The books are personalized with the child’s name, and mailed directly to the child to create a gifting experience that makes books exciting. By surrounding children with books at an early age, the research shows that children develop a positive attitude about reading, expand emerging literacy skills, and are more equipped with literacy readiness when they enter kindergarten.\n\nAmazingly, the yearly cost for a child is only $29. That’s correct! It costs only $29 to covers the yearly cost of mailing 12 books to a child! There is no charge to the families, and all costs are covered by the D41 Kids Foundation, thanks to the generosity of people like you!!\n\nD41 Kids Foundation is a 501 (c) (3) charitable organization."
