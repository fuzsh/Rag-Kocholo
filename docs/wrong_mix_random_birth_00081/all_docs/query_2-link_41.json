        "text": "Dolly Parton launched the Imagination Library in 1995 to benefit the children of her home county in East Tennessee. Dolly's vision was to foster a love of reading among her county’s preschool children and their families. By mailing the gift of high quality, age-appropriate books directly to their homes each month, she wanted children to be excited about books and to feel the magic that books can create. She could also ensure that every child would have books, regardless of their family’s income.\n\nThe Harold Grinspoon Charitable Foundation has partnered with the Dolly Parton Imagination Library as their local affiliate in the Springfield Massachusetts area, providing books each month to local children up to age 5. The goal and vision of the Harold Grinspoon Imagination Library program is for all preschoolers in Springfield to be ready for kindergarten with reading readiness skills and a love of learning."
