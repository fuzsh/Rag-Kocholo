        "text": "An Initiative of The Community Foundation of Harrisonburg and Rockingham County\n\nFREE books for ALL children under 5 years old who are residents of Harrisonburg and Rockingham County\n\nThe Community Foundation wants every child in our area under 5 years old to have a consistent and reliable source of high-quality books. Through the Imagination Library, children will create home libraries and build literacy until they turn five years old. We are changing children’s stories one book at a time.\n\n*Registrations received within 10 weeks of the child’s 5th birthday cannot be processed in time for the child to receive a book from the Imagination Library.\n\nWe are very excited to announce that we have a $250,000 match gift from an anonymous donor to build the Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library Endowment. For every dollar raised, up to $250,000, the donor will match each gift, dollar for dollar. This Endowment will help fund the on-going cost of the program. An opportunity like this one seldom has never before seen at our Community Foundation. Help us create something wonderful for our area’s children under five years old.\n\nYou can help us reach a total $500,000!
