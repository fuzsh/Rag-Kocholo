        "text": "ABOUT OUR IMAGINATION LIBRARY\n\nThe Community Foundation of Harrisonburg and Rockingham County wants every child under 5 years old to have a consistent and reliable source of high-quality books. Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library, an initiative of The Community Foundation of Harrisonburg and Rockingham County is a monthly book gifting program that mails FREE, age-appropriate books personalized with the child’s name directly to the child’s home UP UNTIL the child turns five years old. All children under the age of 5 in Harrisonburg and Rockingham County are eligible. Children within 10 weeks of their 5th birthday are unfortunately not able to be enrolled. We want to change these children’s stories by establishing reading routines, creating home libraries, and preparing children for future academic success.\n\nThe Imagination Library is a Community Foundation initiative in collaboration with The Dollywood Foundation and other funding and community partners.\n\nHOW IT WORKS\n\nThe Imagination Library is the result of a partnership between The Community Foundation and Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library. Through the program, books are mailed in the child’s name directly to their home from birth to when the child turns age 5 at absolutely NO COST to the family. Themes of the books include: love of reading and learning; regard for diversity of people; promotion of self-esteem and confidence. The books also include a book sharing guide on the inside flap to help increase interaction between caregivers and children during book time. The Imagination Library could help every family in Harrisonburg and Rockingham County build a home library of as many as 60 books and spend quality time together.\n\nABOUT DOLLY PARTON’S IMAGINATION LIBRARY\n\nSince launching in 1995, Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library has become the preeminent early childhood book gifting program in the world. The flagship program of The Dollywood Foundation has mailed well over 100 million free books in Australia, Canada, The Republic of Ireland, United Kingdom and the United States. The Imagination Library mails more than 1.4 million high-quality, age-appropriate books each month to registered children from birth up until they turn age five. Dolly envisioned creating a lifelong love of reading, inspiring them to dream. The impact of the program has been widely researched and results suggest positive increases in key early childhood literacy metrics. Penguin Random House is the exclusive publisher for Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library."
