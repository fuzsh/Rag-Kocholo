        "text": "Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library FAQs\n\nWhat are online parent accounts?\n\nParent Accounts provide authorized adults the ability to login and access information and features such as:\n\nChild Status – Allows the authorized adult to see if their child is currently receiving books or not.\n\nEdit Address – This feature allows the authorized adult to edit their child’s address. Once edits have been made, the local program affiliate will review and approve any changes.\n\nAffiliate Info – See the local affiliate partner's contact information that pays for the books and mailing. For Delaware, please email answers@delawarelibraries.libanswers.com with the subject line Imagination Library.\n\nBooks Mailed – The authorized adult can see the titles mailed each month as well as the dates each title was mailed.\n\nHow do I get my login information?\n\nIf an email address was added to your child's record upon registration, this will serve as your username. If you do not know the password, please request a new password using the New Password/Forgot Password link on the login page. If your link has expired or is invalid, you can request a new link at any time by visiting www.imaginationlibrary.com/bos.\n\nHow do I change my address?\n\nIf you need to update or remove a child's record from the system, please use the online system www.imaginationlibrary.com/bos\n\nHow do I know if my child was accepted into the program?\n\nIf you provide an email address with your registration you will be notified via email when the registration is approved or entered into our system. If you do not have an email address you will need to contact your local affiliate to find out more information but it does take 8-10 weeks for books to start arriving after approval.\n\nHow long does it take to start getting books?\n\nWe process mailing files at the beginning of each month and those books are mailed the following month.\n\nA good estimator is to add at least 8-10 weeks to the day you were entered and that is when you will start to receive books.\n\nWhy is our book late? / Why haven’t we received our book this month?\n\nUnfortunately we have received many reports of regional and national mail delays. Books are arriving, but not within the normal timeframes. The Dollywood Foundation has let us know that the USPS has assured them that following recent challenges, things are catching back up and should return to normal soon.\n\nAre the books age appropriate?\n\nYes, all books within the program are age-appropriate and are selected by early childhood experts. More information about our Book Committee can be found at www.imaginationlibrary.com and select \"Choosing Our Books under your country's menu.\n\nEvery child receives the same welcome book, regardless of age, and the following month the age-appropriate titles will start to arrive.\n\nI’m moving out of state. How do I find an affiliate in my new area? Use this link to check availability in your new area: https://imaginationlibrary.com/check-availability/\n\nHappy Reading!\n\nFor more information - please visit this web page - Dolly Parton's Imagination Library - LibGuides at Delaware Division of Libraries"
