LAS VEGAS, NV - Petroglyph Games, Inc. (Petroglyph) today announced Rise of Immortals, an online, free-to-play PC game that expands on the hit Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) genre with new, innovative features designed to appeal to both core and casual players.

Rise of Immortals is set in the world of Graxia, 300 years after the events of "Guardians of Graxia," Petroglyph's fantasy-based PC game released last year. Rise of Immortals features the popular action-strategy gameplay of traditional MOBA games, but adds enhanced socialization features, along with persistent character progression â€“ a first for the MOBA genre. Instead of an account-based leveling system, players can advance their Immortals through a diverse, persistent skill tree, customizing and upgrading the characters to unlock unique abilities that persist from match to match.

In addition, Rise of Immortals features a social hub where players can show off their enhanced Immortals, chat, emote, browse leaderboards, shop, manage friend and guild lists and more. Players also have the option of taking their Immortals through cooperative Player versus Environment (PvE) scenarios to learn the game, try out new abilities, and earn persistent experience before jumping into Player versus Player (PvP) matches online.

"Many people at Petroglyph are huge fans of MOBA gameplay, so developing Rise of Immortals was truly a passion project for the studio," said Steve Wetherill, executive producer of Rise of Immortals for Petroglyph. "We recognize that there can be a high barrier to entry in current MOBA games on the market, and we wanted to expand the genre with a title that offers new features that will appeal both to current fans, as well as those who are new to this type of game."

In addition to today's unveil of Rise of Immortals, Petroglyph also announced that signups are now open for the game's upcoming closed beta test. Players interested in trying this innovative and enhanced MOBA-style game can apply today to be part of the online testing by visiting https://www.riseofimmortals.com. Petroglyph will continue to expand the beta test over the next several weeks, prior to the game's official launch in the spring of 2011.
