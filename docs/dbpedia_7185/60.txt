Petroglyph Games is a video game developer based in Las Vegas, Nevada. The company was formed by a group of former Westwood Studios employees who had resigned when Electronic Arts merged Westwood Studios into the EA Pacific studios in Los Angeles to form EA Los Angeles. Other former Westwood employees initially accepted EA's relocation offer, but eventually returned to Las Vegas to work with Petroglyph. Coincidentally, the old Westwood Studios building is not that far away from the current Petroglyph building.
