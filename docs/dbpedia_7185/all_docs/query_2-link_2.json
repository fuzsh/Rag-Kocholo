        "text": "Reflecting on 20 Years at Petroglyph Two decades ago, a small, dedicated group of developers working out of a one-room office embarked on a journey with a shared vision. Throughout this time, we've had the privilege of creating a number of games that have hopefully brought as much joy to play as it was to create them. From our early classics like STAR WARS™ Empire at War and Universe at War, to recent titles such as Command & Conquer™ Remastered Collection and The Great War: Western Front™, we've strived to push the boundaries of strategy gaming, introducing new IPs and crafting immersive gameplay experiences. Our achievements over these 20 years owe much to the creativity, dedication, and passion of our team, past and present, as well as the incredible support from our awesome community of players. As we mark #20YearsOfPetroglyph, we look forward to the future with great enthusiasm. Here's to the next chapter of Petroglyph, and a heartfelt thank you to everyone who has been a part of this wonderful voyage!"
