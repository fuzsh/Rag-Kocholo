        "text": "by: Russell -\n\nMore On: Rise of Immortals\n\nAs noted above Petroglyph has announced Rise of Immortals, a new online Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) game that's not only going to be designed to appeal to core and casual players...but it's free! Now I've never played any game in the MOBA genre (I've never even done arena battles in World of Warcraft), but I'm always up for a new game if it's free to play. They're also going to have signups for an upcoming closed beta test, so I might just check that out. Read on to check out the official press release."
