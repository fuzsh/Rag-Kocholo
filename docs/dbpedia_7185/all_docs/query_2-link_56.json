        "text": "Petroglyph Games, Inc. visa:2 rank:48096\n\nFollow | Edit or Claim 603 3rd Ave Cando, North Dakota 58324Alert: One LC denied or withdrawn!\n\nReport\n\nContact\n\nVisa\n\nSalary\n\nOccupation\n\nLocation\n\nReview\n\nPetroglyph Games, Inc. has filed 0 labor condition applications for H1B visa and 2 labor certifications for green card from fiscal year 2020 to 2022. Petroglyph Games was ranked 48096 among all visa sponsors. Please note that 0 LCA for H1B Visa and 1 LC for green card have been denied or withdrawn during the same period.\n\nNote: Before Petroglyph Games, Inc. can hire foreign workers permanently or temporarily, it must file labor certifications with the Department of Labor(DOL), demonstrating that it is paying the required wage for the positions in the geographic region where the jobs are located. Above table reports Labor Condition Application(LCA) for H1B visa and Labor Certification(LC) for green card filed by Petroglyph Games, Inc.. The data only indicates the number of applications filed by Petroglyph Games, Inc.. It does not mean that Petroglyph Games, Inc. actually got the visa and hired the workers.\n\nOur LCA data includes LCA submitted for not only new employment, but also continuation or change in previously approved employment, new concurrent employment, change in employer and amended petition. Usually, only LCA for new employment needs H1B Visa quota if it is not cap-exempt.\n\nPetroglyph Games, Inc. has applied for 2 LC and LCA from fiscal year 2021 to 2023. But this does not mean they really hired 2 foreign workers during this period. The visa applications might have been denied. When an employee renews or transfers his H1B visa or change work location under some circumstances, he will also file a new LCA application.\n\nDepartment of Labor(DOL) typically certifies more than 3 times the number of foreign work requests than the number of H1B visas issued by USCIS. So there is no one to one relationship between the number of workers certified by the DOL and the number of H1B work visas issued by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)."
