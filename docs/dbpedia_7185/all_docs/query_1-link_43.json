        "text": "LAS VEGAS, Nevada - Petroglyph today announced the release of Guardians of Graxia, a PC fantasy turn-based strategy game based on the world of Graxia, exclusively on GamersGate. Released earlier this summer, Guardians of Graxia is also available as a standalone board game.\n\n\"Guardians of Graxia features rich and immersive gameplay that combines the best of card and board aspects on the PC,\" said George Chastain, producer of Guardians of Graxia. \"With multiple successful game titles already launched by Petroglyph this year, we look forward to releasing another top-quality, independently developed and published title.\"\n\nThe game uses cards to represent units and actions on a tiled map surface in the form of massive floating continents high above the world of Graxia. There are more than 240 unique units and spells available to play and four Guardian units to lead your armies into battle in the initial release. Upcoming releases will expand upon the single player campaign and skirmish modes with additional maps and units.\n\n\"Guardians of Graxia provides plenty of diverse and challenging encounters at every game turn,\" said Mathew Anderson, community manager of Guardians of Graxia. \"We are excited to first launch the game on GamersGate, a provider of excellent service who shares our passion for expansive, strategic fantasy games.\"\n\nTo purchase the game on GamersGate, please visit www.GamersGate.com/DD-GOG/guardians-of-graxia.\n\nAbout Guardians of Graxia\n\nGraxia is a planet with mystical energies allowing for entire continents to drift high in the sky. These floating landmasses are filled with the cities and dens of many magical races. Guardians create enchanted portals which are the only means to cross from one drifting continent to another. The portals are used by Guardians to transport armies to conquer the land found on the other side. In time, Guardians have become Heroes of Graxia through vanquishing their forces by saving the lands from tyranny.\n\nTo learn more about Guardians of Graxia, please visit www.guardiansofgraxia.com.\n\nAbout Petroglyph\n\nFounded in 2003, Petroglyph is an award-winning, independent game development studio located in Las Vegas, Nevada.
