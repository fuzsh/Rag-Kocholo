        "text": "OSLO, Norway – May 29th, 2019 – “Not all men seek rest and peace; some are born with the spirit of the storm in their blood”. Let their thirst henceforth be quenched, as publisher Funcom and the developers at Petroglyph announce that Conan Unconquered today released on PC. Conan Unconquered is a real-time strategy game that combines resource management, war strategy and pure savagery to create the ultimate RTS experience.\n\n“No game we have created has ever challenged the player’s skill to a higher level,” warns Executive Producer Ted Morris at Petroglyph.\n\nSuch a warning from the development team with games like Command & Conquer, Dune II and Star Wars: Empire at War on their resumé, should not be taken lightly. However, the gaming veterans promise a silver lining. At least the first few waves you face won’t be all that bad.\n\nConan Unconquered takes you to the world created by fantasy author Robert E. Howard during the early 1930s, and the subsequent comics and cult classic movies from the 1980s. You are tasked with defending a city against the terrible legions of the cruel sorcerer Thugra Khotan, Conan’s nemesis in the short story Black Colossus (1933). You must manage your resources wisely, create dwellings and research facilities, and set up fortifications as best you can. You must direct your army to fend off every wave of attack, all the while using your hero to explore, gather resources, find invaluable artifacts and gain experience.\n\nThe game can be played solo, in co-op multiplayer or you can compete against other players in challenge mode. In co-op mode players will share resources and most of the buildings and fortifications, but they will face tougher foes than they would have in a single-player game. The challenge comes in trying to coordinate between one another.\n\nThe map and attacking waves are generated at random every time, but in challenge mode you get to challenge your friends to beat you on the exact same map and with the exact same enemies as you just faced. Each challenge even comes with its own leaderboard.\n\nThe game is currently available for $ 29.99 (pricing may differ across territories) on https://buy.conanunconquered.com/ and on Steam."
