        "text": "Rock art is very fragile and the application of any material, including water and especially oil from your skin, can cause irreparable damage so please don’t touch, walk, or climb on it.\n\nObserve and photograph, but leave what you find for future generations.\n\nArtifacts and rock art on public land are protected; excavating, removing, damaging, or otherwise defacing any archaeological resource is a felony punishable by fines and imprisonment.\n\nHelp protect these resources; report vandalism.\n\nBureau of Land Management’s resource protection hotline 800.722.3998\n\nIt is difficult to date rock art even with today’s scientific dating method. Sophisticated methods of C-14 dating have been designed to analyze the tiny particles of organic matter which collect in the grooves of petroglyphs after having been etched onto the rock surface.\n\nDespite the continual refining of these methods, there are still significant problems related to the contamination of the organic matter. In some instances, rock art can be related to artifactual material that is datable and thought to be contemporary with the rock art, but often it is impossible to generate anything other than an estimated timeframe.\n\nRock art is composed of separate designs called elements. These elements are arranged in groups on the sides of rock faces, and are referred to as panels.\n\nPhoto with description Anthropomorphs = Human figures\n\nPhoto with description Zoomorphs = Animals; the four-legged kind as well as birds and insects.\n\nWherever there has been human activity, there is rock art. Speculated reasons for rock art are many. Possibly it contained sacred knowledge and was ceremonial marked game trails designated cultural territories functioned as astronomical markers pertaining to such phenomena as the solstices and equinoxes.\n\nWhatever the meaning, it was deeply significant to those who created it."
