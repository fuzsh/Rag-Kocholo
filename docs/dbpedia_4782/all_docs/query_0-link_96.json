        "text": "Newcastle Knights\n\nNewcastle Knights Match Previews and Score Predictions\n\nNewcastle Knights Betting\n\nIf you are looking to bet on the Newcastle Knights, why not try one of these fantastic bookies that offers lots of markets on the NRL.\n\nRugby League Bookies\n\nAlthough there is a long history of professional Rugby League in Newcastle going back to the days of the Newcastle Rebels it wasn’t until 1988 that the Newcastle Knights joined the National Rugby League but ever since then they have continued to build and have featured some of the world’s best players, have developed on of the league best stadiums and largest fan bases and most importantly the club have known success on the field with titles in both 197 and 2001).\n\nBased in the city of Newcastle to the North of Sydney, the Newcastle Knights are instantly recognisable thanks to their distinctive red and blue playing strip which is echoed by the colours of their stands at the impressive Hunter Stadium.\n\nThe Knights have also had success in bringing through high quality youngsters who have not only represented the club but many have gone on to play for New South Wales and Australia with Andrew Johns arguably their most famous player.\n\nNewcastle have a good balance of high quality internationals such as coupled with exciting youngsters and those who have the skills to be amongst the best on any given day. The Newcastle Knights are a team who are sure to be targeting a place in the end of season playoffs.\n\nNewcastle Knights NRL\n\nThe Newcastle region and the wider Hunter Valley is a hot bed of the sport and that passion comes through whenever the host play at home thanks to the large crowds that they get for every match and for the great backing that they give.\n\nThe club have also produced some true stars of the game including the likes of Robbie O’Davis, Danny Buderus, Paul Harragon and most famously, Andrew Johns.\n\nLocation\n\nThe club are based in the metropolitan area of Newcastle in the state of New South Wales which is located to the north of Sydney.\n\nThe city and surrounding area is the second most populous area in the state and whilst Newcastle is home to a number of sporting teams, it is the Knights who dominate the sporting conscious of the city.\n\nStadium\n\nThe Newcastle International Sports Centre, known to most as various sponsored names including the McDonald Jones Stadium, Marathon Stadium, EnergyAustralia Stadium, AusGrid Stadium, or the Hunter Stadium, is home to the Knights and it is one of the largest and most impressive purpose built Rugby League Stadiums in the world.\n\nIn the main, the stadium consists of 2 large stands down both touchlines with a smaller stand at each end of the pitch to make for a capacity of around 33,000 fans.\n\nThe stadium is easily recognisable as the home of the Knights as it features the clubs colours throughout including on the seats and the Eastern Grandstand at the ground is named the Andrew Johns Stand in honour of their former star half back.\n\nThe ground is located in the New Lambert suburb of the city, which is just outside of the main city centre and close to the cities port and coast.\n\nNicknames\n\nAs well as their Knights moniker, the club are also known as the Novocastrians, which is also the name given to those from the city of Newcastle.\n\nRivals\n\nThe Knights are a relatively young side and are based away from the key heartlands of the sport, although the Hunter region is its self a heartlands of the sport but it has kept itself separate in the main from Sydney/Queensland.\n\nPerhaps due to that or for a few other reasons, the club do not have a really heated rivalry with any other club although when a big club is in the town, the fans in the stadium always make it seem like it is the biggest game for the club.\n\nColours / Playing Kit\n\nThe clubs playing strip and home stadium are always easy to recognise as it is a combination that you do not see too often with their shirts been red and blue in colour. The exact style changes regularly and has included a mostly blue shirt, a mostly red shirt, vertical stripes, and a chevron based design.\n\nHistory\n\nThere has been a long history or Rugby League in the city and region for almost as long as the sport as been played in Australia but whilst competition in New South Wales and Queensland dominated things for much of the sports history in Australia, Rugby League has always had an independent spirit, including having its own competition- the Newcastle Rugby League.\n\nAfter turning down an offer from the NSWRL competition in 1982 to form a team due to worries over weakening the local competition, the league did decide to developed a club for the 1988 season when the best of the local competition joined up to the Newcastle Knights under the stewardship of head coach Allan McMahon.\n\nThings turned out well of the club almost from the off and by 1990, they finished in 5th place to feature in the end of season play-offs.\n\nIn 1991, the cub won their first trophy at the Nissan Sevens and in 1995, the reached the semi-finals of the play-offs.\n\nWhen the Super League wars broke out in Australia, the team spurned the advances of Rupert Murdoch, who formed the Hunter Mariners in retaliation but the city remained loyal to Knights and that loyalty was rewarded with the clubs first title in 1997 when they defeated the Sea Eagle in the Grand Final.\n\nThis was a big success for the city as around 70% of the team were juniors from Newcastle but that joy soon turned to anger when 3 of the players tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs.\n\n1998 was another good year for the club but after a couple of disappointing years, the club rebounded with their second title after an Andrew Johns inspired side defeated the Parramatta Eels to win the big trophy.\n\nUnfortunately, things have not managed to hit them heights again for some time, with the club picking up the wooden spoon in 2005, 2015, 2016 and 2017 but after spells of off of the field issues and financial problems, which has included the league itself taking over the ownership of the club, things are now on the up once more.\n\nNewcastle Knights Live Streaming\n\nThe club have lots of fans over here in the UK and if that is you ,you will know just how difficult it can be to watch them live on tv as they are far from one of the NRL’s glamour clubs but the good news is that there are now a number of ways to watch Rugby League live from Australia."
