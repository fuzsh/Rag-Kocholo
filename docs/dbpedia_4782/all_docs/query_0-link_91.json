        "text": "Melbourne Rebels have confirmed that Wallabies prop Matt Gibson has signed a new deal with the club until the end of 2025.\n\nHaving made his debut for the club during the 2019 season, Gibson has featured in 49 games for the club since then.\n\nHe made his Test debut for Australia against Argentina last year and has five Test caps to his name.\n\nHis re-signing will be a boost to Australia as they look to build towards the World Cup scheduled this year and the 2025 Lions series to follow.\n\n“I was thinking about the last year and obviously, had a tough start to the season, but it was a good year for me with rugby and starting a new family at the beginning of this year, so I'm really excited to stay in Melbourne and continue to grow off that,” he told the club's official website.\n\n“I love this environment – the internal competition and hunger in the group is great and really pushes you to keep growing as a player.\n\n\"I'm also looking forward to getting my fifty Caps. Loyalty is a big thing for me, and I’m excited to commit all my time, energy, and knowledge to one club\"."
