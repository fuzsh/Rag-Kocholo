        "text": "Donated by Life Member Mark Stowers\n\nInaugurated in 1978-79 to honour the memory of Pat Jordan, who died in a freakish accident in February 1979. Pat was a great supporter of Baseball in the Newcastle area, where he was actively involved with the Carrington Baseball Club. He also played a major role in the development and encouragement of Junior baseball in our Club, organising annual visits of his junior teams to compete against ours in Canberra, or hosting our teams in their visits to Newcastle.\n\nSo that his name and work would always be remembered, the Club endorsed a perpetual trophy in his honour, to be awarded each year to its most promising junior player."
