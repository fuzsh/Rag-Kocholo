        "text": "Paramore fans are used to waiting a while between records, but the five-year break following After Laughter is the longest hiatus the band has taken since its inception.\n\nLuckily, the wait for new music from their faves was coming to an end.\n\nWhen the group’s website and social media profile photos were updated in early September, fans went hunting for clues about new music — and they weren’t disappointed. Paramore lead singer Hayley Williams, guitarist Taylor York and drummer Zac Farro had planted a few online Easter eggs to tease the release of \"This Is Why\" — the title track for their forthcoming album.\n\nThen on Sept. 28, the group surprised fans by announcing the release date for their new album and dropping the single concurrently with a new music video. \"It was the very last song we wrote for the album. To be honest, I was so tired of writing lyrics, but Taylor convinced Zac and I both that we should work on this last idea. What came out of it was the title track for the whole album,\" Williams said in a statement. \"It summarizes the plethora of ridiculous emotions, the rollercoaster of being alive in 2022, having survived even just the last three or four years.\"\n\nAhead of their upcoming tour — which begins Oct. 2 in California and ends Nov. 19 in Mexico — here are four things to know about Paramore’s forthcoming album, This Is Why, out on Feb. 10, 2023.\n\nThe Band Has Been Teasing A Comeback For A While\n\nIn an interview with NME in May 2020, Williams hinted at the band’s next era. \"We’ve thought about [the next Paramore album],\" she said. \"Taylor’s mentioned things like: ‘Oh, God – I miss guitars. We’ve found ourselves listening to a lot of older music that we grew up being inspired by. T and I liked stuff that was a bit more ratty sounding: The Rapture, Yeah Yeah Yeahs. All three of us loved Queens Of The Stone Age’s Songs For The Deaf.\"\n\nIn a July 2022 interview with Music Connection, GRAMMY-winning mixing engineer Manny Marroquin revealed that Paramore’s new album, also called P6 by fans, had been completed.The news spread through social media like wildfire.\n\nTwo months later, the group kicked off the promo cycle by posting a range of cryptic dates on their website, causing fans to channel their inner Sherlock to decipher the clues — 9.1 discord, 9.7 blank, 9.9 wr0ng, 9.12 LA, 9.16 - pre-save t.i.w., 9.19 - NY and 9.28. Each clue represented a mini-milestone for the band’s new era, including the launch of a new Discord, the wiping of their social media pages to signal a new era, fall concert dates, a preview of the new single, and updated profile pics on social media.\n\nThe Trio Will Return To Their Guitar-Driven Roots\n\nThis Is Why will be a return to Paramore's rock roots — but not the emo-pop-rock sound first heard on their 2005 debut, All We Know Is Falling. (On a recent episode of her new podcast \"Everything Is Emo,\" Williams revealed that the indie rock band Bloc Party played an integral role in helping Paramore figure out the energy of their music.)\n\nWith Williams’ signature belt and a riffy, rocking chorus, \"This Is Why\" is a bit of a departure from the band’s synth-pop and new-wave-infused 2017 effort, After Laughter. The track bears a bit of a resemblance to some of the ‘80s pop heard on Williams’ solo album, Petals for Armor,\" leaving fans to speculate about whether or not the group will ever return to the rock sound that brought them initial success. However, Paramore has gone on record about their intentions to get back to guitar-driven music, so other songs on P6 may lean further into their rock roots than the title track.\n\nBut change can be good, and experimenting with new sounds can yield magic — as was the case with After Laughter, which itself was a sonic departure from their eclectic 2013 self-titled album. According to Williams, experimentation is essential because it keeps things fresh. The singer told Rolling Stone that the band was pleasantly surprised by the album’s production process and had no plans to make a carbon copy of their previous material.\n\n\"The music we were first excited by wasn’t exactly the kind of music we went on to make,\" Williams said. \"Our output has always been all over the place, and with this project, it’s not that different. We’re still in the thick of it, but some things have remained consistent from the start. 1) More emphasis back on the guitar, and 2) Zac should go as Animal as he wants with drum takes.\"\n\nThe Group Collaborated With Their Longtime Producer And The Mixing Engineer Behind Rihanna’s \"Work\"\n\nFor P6, Paramore reunited with longtime collaborator Carlos De la Garza, who previously produced the band’s self-titled album, After Laughter, and Williams’ solo projects Petals for Armor and Flowers For Vases/descansos. (Fun fact: De la Garza is the father of two members of the LA-based punk band the Linda Lindas — guitarist Lucia and drummer Mila — who count Paramore among their music heroes.)\n\nTo ensure a cohesive sonic experience for This Is Why, the trio recruited 11-time GRAMMY-winning mixer Manny Marroquin, who has mixed tracks for Kanye West, Lizzo, Rihanna, Megan Thee Stallion, and Selena Gomez, among others.\n\nThe Group May Play New Music On Their Fall Concert Tour\n\nIn October, the trio is hitting the road for a limited fall tour through North America, and there’s a possibility that they’ll preview some new music for fans in attendance. This time around, the GRAMMY-winning rockers are skipping the arenas in favor of cozier venues to provide fans with a more intimate experience — and they’re taking a few up-and-coming bands along for the ride, including Young the Giant and Japanese Breakfast.\n\nEverything We Know About The New Whitney Houston Biopic 'I Wanna Dance With Somebody'\n\nThe rock scene may no longer be the dominant force it once was — blink-182's One More Time... is the only Billboard 200 chart-topper this year to predominantly fall under this category. But 2023 has still been an interesting and eventful period for those who like their guitar music turned up to eleven.\n\nOver the past 12 months, we've had the two biggest groups of the Swinging Sixties returning to the fray in style, a new European invasion, and a wave of blockbuster albums that may well go down as modern classics. And then there's the revivals which will no doubt spark nostalgia in any kids of the 2000s, a resurgence in all-star line-ups, and a residency that could possibly change how we experience live music.\n\nAs we gear up for the holiday season, here's a look at 10 trends that defined rock music in 2023.\n\nEuropean Rock Traveled To America\n\nFrom Lacuna Coil and Gojira to Volbeat and Rammstein, the Billboard charts aren't exactly strangers to European rock. But 2023 was the year when the continent appeared to band together for a mini invasion. Italian quartet Måneskin continued their remarkable journey from Eurovision Song Contest winners to bona fide rock gods with a Best New Artist nod at the 2023 GRAMMYs, a top 20 placing on the Billboard 200 albums chart for third album Rush!, and a Best Rock Video win at the MTV VMAs.\n\nMasked metalers Ghost scored a fourth consecutive Top 10 entry on the Billboard 200 with covers EP Phantomime, also landing a Best Metal Performance GRAMMY nomination for its cover of Iron Maiden's \"Phantom of the Opera,\" (alongside Disturbed's \"Bad Man,\" Metallica's \"72 Seasons,\" Slipknot's \"Hive Mind,\" and Spiritbox's \"Jaded\"). While fellow Swedes Avatar bagged their first Mainstream Rock No. 1 with \"The Dirt I'm Buried In,\" a highly melodic meditation on mortality which combines funky post-punk with freewheeling guitar solos that sound like they've escaped from 1980s Sunset Strip.\n\nAge Proved To Be Nothing But A Number\n\nThe theory that rock and roll is a young man's game was blown apart in 2023. Fronted by 80-year-old Mick Jagger, The Rolling Stones reached No.3 on the Billboard 200 thanks to arguably their finest album in 40 years, Hackney Diamonds, with lead single \"Angry\" also picking up a Best Rock Song GRAMMY nod alongside Olivia Rodrigo's \"aallad of a homeschooled girl,\" Queens of the Stone Age's \"Emotion Sickness,\" Boygenius' \"Not Strong Enough,\" and Foo Fighters' \"Rescued.\" (The latter two will also battle it out with Arctic Monkeys' \"Sculpture of Anything Goes,\" Black Pumas' \"More than a Love Song,\" and Metallica's \"Lux Aeterna\" for Best Rock Performance.)\n\nThe eternally shirtless Iggy Pop, a relative spring chicken at 76, delivered a late-career classic, too, with the star-studded Every Loser. And Bruce Springsteen, KISS, and Paul McCartney all proved they weren't ready for the slippers and cocoa life yet by embarking on lengthy world tours.\n\nDeath Was No Barrier To Hits\n\nJimmy Buffett sadly headed for that tropical paradise in the sky this year. But having already recorded 32nd studio effort, Equal Strain on All Parts, the margarita obsessive was able to posthumously score his first new entry on the Billboard Rock Chart since 1982's \"It's Midnight And I'm Not Famous Yet.\"\n\nBut he isn't the only artist to have recently achieved success from beyond the grave. Linkin Park reached the U.S. Top 40 with \"Lost,\" a track recorded for 2003 sophomore Meteora, but which only saw the light of day six years after frontman Chester Bennington's passing.\n\nPerhaps most unexpectedly of all, The Beatles topped the U.K. charts for the first time since 1969 thanks to \"Now and Then,\" a psychedelic tear-jerker in which surviving members McCartney and Ringo Starr brought previously unheard recordings from George Harrison and John Lennon back to life.\n\nThe Giants Stayed Giant\n\nFoo Fighters also overcame the death of a core member on what many rock fans would consider this year's most eagerly awaited album. Drummer Taylor Hawkins, who passed away in early 2022, doesn't feature on the poignant but vibrant But Here We Are. Yet the two-time GRAMMY nominated LP still proved to be a fitting tribute as well as an encouraging sign that Dave Grohl and co. can extend their legacy:lead single \"Rescued\" became their 12th number one on Billboard's Main Rock Chart.\n\nThe Best Rock Album category for the 2024 GRAMMYs proves that veterans were alive and mighty in 2023. Along with the Foos' latest LP, the nominees include another Grohl-affiliated band,, Queens of the Stone Age's first album in six years, In Times New Roman..., Paramore's This Is Why, Metallica's 72 Seasons and Greta Van Fleet's Starcatcher.. (Metallica's 72 Seasons also struck gold with its singles, three of which landed at No. 1 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock chart, where lead single \"Lux Æterna\" spent 11 consecutive weeks on top.)\n\nOf course, we also have to give a shout-out to U2. Not for March's Songs of Surrender album (for which they re-recorded 40 of their biggest and best tracks), but for the immersive, eye-popping Las Vegas residency at The Sphere which potentially reinvented the future of live music.\n\nThe Rock Supergroup Continued To Thrive\n\n2023 spawned several new rock supergroups including Mantra of the Cosmos (Shaun Ryder, Zak Starkey and Andy Bell), Lol Tolhurst x Budgie x Jacknife Lee, and Better Lovers (various members of The Dillinger Escape Plan and Every Time I Die). But it was an already established all-star line-up that took the GRAMMY nominations by storm.\n\nConsisting of Phoebe Bridgers, Lucy Dacus, and Julien Baker, boygenius bagged a remarkable seven nods at the 2024 ceremony. Throw in a well-received headline set at Coachella, U.S. Top 50 follow-up EP, and even a \"Saturday Night Live\" showing alongside Timothée Chalamet, and the trio couldn't have asked for a better way to continue what they started together in 2018.\n\nThe Early 2000s Enjoyed A Revival\n\nThe cyclical nature of the music industry meant that the era of choppy bangs and super-skinny jeans was always going to come back into fashion. And following throwbacks from the likes of Olivia Rodrigo and Willow, the original punk-pop brigade returned this year to prove they could still mosh with the best of them.\n\nPossibly the defining nasal voice of his generation, Tom DeLonge headed back into the studio with blink-182 for the first time in 12 years, with the resulting One More Time... topping the Billboard 200. Linkin Park (\"Lost\"), Papa Roach (\"Cut the Line\"), and a reunited Staind (\"Lowest in Me\") all scored No. 1s on the Mainstream Rock Airplay Chart, while Sum 41, Bowling For Soup, and Good Charlotte were just a few of the high school favorites who helped cement When We Were Young as the millennial's dream festival.\n\nThe Emo Scene Went Back To Its Roots\n\nAfter channeling the new wave and synth-pop of the 1980s on predecessor After Laughter, Paramore returned from a six-year absence with a record which harked back to their mid-2000s beginnings. But it wasn't their own feisty brand of punk-pop that Best Rock Album GRAMMY nominee This Is Why resembled. Instead, its nervy indie rock took its cues, as frontwoman Hayley Williams freely admits, from touring buddies Bloc Party.\n\nParamore weren't the only emo favorites to rediscover their roots. Fall Out Boy reunited with Under the Cork Tree producer Neal Avron and old label Fueled By Ramen on the dynamic So Much (for) Stardust. And while Taking Back Sunday further veered away from their signature sound, the Long Islanders still embraced the past by naming seventh LP 152 after the North Carolina highway stretch they used to frequent as teens.\n\nCountry Artists Tapped Into Rock Sensibilities\n\nWe're used to seeing rock musicians going a little bit country: see everyone from Steven Tyler and Bon Jovi to Darius Rucker and Aaron Lewis. But the opposite direction is usually rarer. In 2023, however, it seemed as though every Nashville favorite was suddenly picking up the air guitar.\n\nZach Bryan repositioned himself as Gen-Z's answer to Bruce Springsteen with the heartland rock of his eponymous Billboard 200 chart-topper (which is up for Best Country Album at the 2024 GRAMMYs alongside Kelsea Ballerini's Rolling Up the Welcome Mat, Brothers Osborne's self-titled LP, Tyler Childers' Rustin' in the Rain, and Lainey Wilson's Bell Bottom Country). Meanwhile, Hitmaker HARDY — who first cut his teeth penning hits for Florida Georgia Line and Blake Shelton — leaned into the sounds of hard rock and nu-metal on his second studio LP, The Mockingbird & the Crow.\n\nBut few committed more to the crossover than the one of country's greatest living legends. Dolly Parton roped in a whole host of hellraisers and headbangers including Richie Sambora, Joan Jett & The Blackhearts, and Rob Halford, for the 30-track Rockstar — her first rock-oriented project of her glittering 49-album career.\n\nPost-Grunge Reunions Were Abundant\n\nFans of the mopey '90s scene known as post-grunge had all their dreams come true this year thanks to several unexpected reunions. Turn-of-the-century chart-toppers Staind and Matchbox Twenty both returned with new albums after more than a decade away. Creed, meanwhile, announced they'd be headlining next year's Summer of '99 cruise after a similar amount of time out of the spotlight.\n\nThe insatiable appetite for all things nostalgia, of course, means that any band — no matter how fleeting their fame — can stage a lucrative comeback. Take Dogstar, for example, the unfashionable outfit boasting Hollywood nice guy Keanu Reeves. Twenty-three years after appearing to call it a day, the Los Angeles trio surprised everyone by hitting the Bottlerock Napa Valley Festival before dropping a belated third LP, Somewhere Between the Power Lines and Palm Trees and embarking on a headlining national tour.\n\nThe New Generation Gave The Old Their Dues\n\nSay what you want about today's musical generation, but they know to pay respect where it's due., Olivia Rodrigo, for example, doffed her cap to '90s alt-rock favorites The Breeders by inviting them to open on her 2024 world tour.\n\nNew working-class hero Sam Fender invited fellow Newcastle native Brian Johnson to perform two AC/DC classics at his hometown stadium show. While ever-changing Japanese kawaii metalers Babymetal debuted their latest incarnation on \"Metali,\" a collaboration with one of their musical idols, Rage Against the Machine's Tom Morello.\n\nWhether new artists are teaming up with the old or veterans are continuing to receive their flowers, 2023 proved that rock is alive and well.\n\n2023 In Review: 5 Trends That Defined Hip-Hop\n\nFollowing a few rocky years, Bonnaroo 2023 made a triumphant comeback to Great Stage Park (affectionately dubbed \"The Farm\") under glorious skies. The Manchester, Tennessee festival was completely sold out this year, drawing more than 80,000 people for four days of music, laughter, food, and plenty of sun.\n\nFrom the Midnight and their showstopping saxophonist, to Amber Mark’s masterful lyricism and Three 6 Mafia's guests (which included a surprise cameo by country star Jelly Roll), to young musician Ben Goldsmith’s country-inspired tunes and Hayley Williams joining Foo Fighters to perform \"My Hero.\" And if all-day music wasn’t enough, Bonnaroo 2023 featured numerous food vendors and relaxing areas, and even a place to get married.\n\nWhile at times the lines were long, the sun was hot, and getting from one remote area to another proved difficult, rousing sets by headliners and larger-than-life moments at the smaller tents made everything worth it. Here are 10 of the most exciting sets from Bonnaroo 2023.\n\nSuki Waterhouse Shines Despite Difficulties\n\nSuki Waterhouse ⎹ Dusana Risovic for Bonnaroo 2023\n\nAfter a severely delayed set due to technical difficulties, Thursday’s performance at That Tent saw English actress-turned-singer Suki Waterhouse playing through much of her debut album, I Can’t Let Go.\n\nDrenched in pink light with an enveloping fog, Waterhouse’s cinematic performance and comforting vocals could draw anyone into the tent. She flitted through \"Moves,\" \"Bulls— on the Internet,\" \"My Mind\" and TikTok favorite \"Good Looking\" with a robust collection of layered drums and guitar for support.\n\nBig Freedia Fires Everybody Up\n\nBig Freedia ⎹ Charles Reagan for Bonnaroo 2023\n\nAcross the park, Big Freedia treated audiences to an extra-special taste of New Orleans bounce. The 1:45 a.m. set time after a sweltering day did not deter the amped-up audience, many of whom likely attended Thursday’s Pride Parade — also helmed by Big Freedia.\n\n\"I just want to wish everyone happy Pride,\" Big Freedia, donning an outfit made of rainbow feathers, said to momentous cheers. \"We about to turn up, we about to celebrate!\"\n\nFolks from the audience jumped on stage for a 2 a.m. twerk contest, dancing along with Big Freedia as she performed \"Azz Everywhere\" and \"Rock Around the Clock.\" It was a lot of energy to be had for the wee morning hours, but if there’s anything the Bonnaroo crowd does better than others, it’s the late nights.\n\nBlack Midi Brings The Noise\n\nTranslating a distinctively chaotic discography into a sensical live set isn’t an easy task. Compound that with a fickle festival audience in the hot sun, and sometimes it can be downright impossible. Yet, Black Midi's experimental arrangements seemed to delight the audience relatively quickly on Saturday.\n\nWith songs that took a slower cadence (\"Still\") and others that were characterized by sharp tonal shifts and dramatic tempo changes (\"Eat Men Eat!\", \"953\"), the bulk of the excitement came in not knowing what to expect next. It was the kind of organized mayhem that invited people to start chucking inflatable dinosaurs, rubber chickens, bananas, toilet paper, anything they had in hand.\n\nThe charm in Black Midi’s music, at least on that stage, was that it didn’t take itself too seriously. In translating their mind-melting, seemingly random studio style to the Bonnaroo stage, Black Midi taught us, song after song, that some shows just have to be some degree of chaos.\n\nRina Sawayama Cycles Through Every Genre\n\nRina Sawayama ⎹ Cora Wagoner for Bonnaroo 2023\n\nTo see Rina Sawayama live is a gift. The rising pop (and rock, and country) artist shined on Friday at the Which Stage, moving with elegance through choreographed dance routines. Her performances included a two-dancer ensemble and various spur-of-the moment outfit and character changes.\n\nThere’s a transporting magic wrought by Rina’s one hour set; every song she performed felt like an individual production with a story to tell, beginning with the fearlessly reflective \"Hold The Girl\" and ending with the rousing \"This Hell\" (featuring a surprise cameo by MUNA, who had just finished playing the What Stage).\n\nFor a set that started with hard rock, cycled through bubblegum pop, and ended with country, it felt every bit as extraordinary and arresting as she is. Rina Sawayama doesn’t demand your attention — she’s not begging for it. She simply acquires it whether you like it or not.\n\nParis Jackson Conjures Pixies And Nirvana\n\nParis Jackson ⎹ Gary Miller/WireImage\n\nParis Jackson may have just one album under her belt, but that didn’t stop the 25-year-old singer/songwriter from packing sets on Saturday and Sunday at two different stages. The crowd clearly couldn’t get enough of their Nirvana-inspired music as they overflowed the Toyota Music Den on Saturday to listen to acoustic versions of her new tracks, and then This Tent on Sunday for the full-instrumental versions of those songs.\n\nHighlights of both sets included her lighthearted guitar tuning interlude — a seemingly out-of-place folk song her bandmate plays as she tunes her guitar in her earpiece — and \"bandaid,\" the title track off of her forthcoming new album.\n\n\"Most of my songs are about heartbreak,\" Jackson told GRAMMY.com during a backstage chat. \"This is the most raw and vulnerable I’ve ever been in my lyrics, but it’s still vague enough for people to make it about what they want it to be about.\"\n\nThough a departure from her old sound— which leaned more towards indie folk, watching her perform \"bandaid\" and her other two singles \"Just You\" and \"Lighthouse\" felt like we were watching her come into her own. The depth of the songwriting felt right at home amongst the covers of Blind Melon’s \"No Rain\" and Pearl Jam’s \"Even Flow.\"\n\nKendrick Lamar Performs On His Birthday\n\nKendrick Lamar ⎹ Roger Ho for Bonnaroo 2023\n\nThe first of the weekend’s headliners to perform, Kendrick Lamar, spent his 36th birthday eve putting on a theatrical performance that blended cuts from last year’s Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers (\"Count Me Out\") with back catalog material (\"A.D.H.D.\", \"Backseat Freestyle\").\n\nAfter a modest, humble response to the audience singing him \"Happy Birthday\" at the stroke of midnight, Lamar leaned into the melodrama, as he rapped alongside a group of suit-wearing doppelgängers dancing with uncanny, uniform movements. For his second-to-last act, Lamar brought out his cousin Baby Keem, who brought vigorous rhymes to the stage for \"family ties\". And even though Kendrick’s set ended 20 minutes early with \"Savior,\" its high energy and dramatic visuals were the cherry on top to an already exhilarating Friday evening.\n\nThe Band Camino Brings Their Music Back Home\n\nThe Band Camino ⎹ Nathan Zucker for Bonnaroo 2023\n\nTennessee’s own The Band Camino were slated to appear at two canceled Bonnaroos in a row, and by this year's festival the Memphis band were visibly happy to be there. They revived their song \"California\" just for Bonnaroo, and played the ever-popular \"2/14\" alongside some of their newer singles, \"What Am I Missing\" and \"Last Man in the World\" — the latter of which was a huge hit with the crowd.\n\nSpeaking to GRAMMY.com backstage, vocalists Spencer Stewart and Jeffery Jordan discussed the song’s provenance: \"We were trying to write something that was verbally heavy-hitting, that paints a really good picture about what it feels like to be with this very special person. It feels like everyone else is gone and you’re just left with this one person left; you’re the last people in the world.\"\n\nLil Nas X Rides ’Til He Can’t No More\n\nLil Nas X ⎹ Pooneh Ghana for Bonnaroo 2023\n\nThe main stage at Bonnaroo is always a grand marvel, and Lil Nas X gave the Bonnaroo audience nothing short of that, drawing an enormous crowd on Saturday just after nightfall. Bobbing and weaving across a stage he shared with giant costumed animals, a six-person dance ensemble, and swirling rock formations, it’s obvious the rapper has an insatiable desire to entertain and magnetize.\n\nAs expected, songs like \"Old Town Road\" and \"What I Want\" proved their staying power as fans from all walks of life sung along unabashedly, celebrating Nas X's Black queer joy.\n\n\"It's f—ing Pride month, y'all better make some noise for this gay ass s—!\", Lil Nas X yelled, prompting applause from both the audience and his dancers, who were just as integral a part of the show as he was. The GRAMMY-winning performer gave each of his dancers gave the audience a chance to hype up the crowd, too, showcasing their dancing abilities to songs by J. Balvin, Lola Brooke, and Beyonce.\n\nWith dance arrangements full of vogueing, ass shaking, and straight-up boogie, the Nas X show was a spectacle to behold, and kept the crowd whipped up in a frenzy until the very last notes of GRAMMY nominated \"Industry Baby.\"\n\nParamore Dabbles In Nostalgia\n\nHayley Williams and Zac Farrow of Paramore ⎹ Pooneh Ghana for Bonnaroo 2023\n\n\"Does anybody here tonight feel like cashing in on a little nostalgia? Anyone here feel like taking a trip down memory lane?\" yelled Hayley Williams of Paramore. The four-piece formed just 70 miles north in Franklin, Tennessee in 2004, and led the audience right back to 2007’s Riot!, where a young Hayley Williams boldly sang \"Once a whore you’re nothing more/I’m sorry that’ll never change\" (\"Misery Business\").\n\nShe doesn’t sing that lyric live anymore because of its misogynist tone, but their setlist resembled something of a greatest hits record. The band powered through standouts for those who had been supporting \"since day one\" (\"All I Wanted\", \"Last Hope\"), and incredible renditions of their newer songs, like \"Rose-Colored Boy\", performed with samples of Whitney Houston’s \"I Wanna Dance with Somebody\" and Tom Tom Club's \"Genius of Love\" intermixed.\n\nIn a raw and potent performance before a thousands-strong audience — it was the band’s second appearance at the festival — Paramore proved that they will remaina treat to see live for years to come.\n\nPixies Prove They're Larger Than The That Tent\n\nBeing the gold-standard of alt rock is just what the Pixies are all about, and their Sunday evening performance at the That Tent seemed intent on showing everyone that.\n\nThe That Tent was spilling out from every corner, uncomfortably so, as the reclusive ‘80s stalwarts rocked and rolled through through favorites from albums past— including \"Here Comes Your Man\" and \"Where is My Mind\" — and songs from their newest project, Doggrel — \"Who's More Sorry Now?\" and \"Get Simulated.\"\n\nIt was 23 songs in just an hour’s time. And in true Pixies fashion, they did this all without a setlist, coursing seamlessly from song to song without a plan, solely from the heart. As the band closed with a Neil Young cover (\"Winterlong\") to raucous applause, everyone was reminded that, much like the festival, you don’t always need a plan to have a good time.\n\nCMA Fest Turns 50: Lainey Wilson, Brett Young, Reba McEntire & More Share Memories From The Country Staple\n\nIf there's one word to describe this year in pop, it would be \"unpredictable.\" Take fan favorites Beyoncé and Rihanna for starters: as fans began pondering when they'd hear new music again, both superstars made significant returns to their solo artistries, further elevating their statuses as elite pop divas.\n\nPop's unexpected nature is what makes it so beloved, especially in 2022 as artists showcased just how far their versatility can stretch. TikTok showed off its influence once again, with songs like Nicki Minaj's \"Super Freaky Girl\" birthing endless viral dance challenges. There was plenty of dancing outside of TikTok as well, as artists like Drake, The Weeknd and Beyoncé had everyone grooving under the disco ball.\n\nFrom pop stars unleashing their naughty sides to singles that transported us back to the '2000s and beyond, there were several major moments in pop music this year. Dive into eight of the genre's most dominant trends below.\n\nY2K Pop Divas Made Comebacks\n\nThroughout 2022, the influence of late '90s and early '00s culture was reflected on fashion runways, TikTok and even a multitude of television reboots. So it was only natural that it also seeped into the music realm, with some of the era's biggest pop stars having a refreshing revival.\n\nMore than two decades after the release of her debut Spanish-language album Mi Reflejo, Christina Aguilera returned to her Latina roots (Aguilera's estranged father is an Ecuador native). The long wait was worth it, with the star sounding more confident than ever before as she celebrated her rich heritage. After starting this new era with the female empowerment anthem \"Pa Mis Muchachas\" (alongside fellow Latina artists Becky G, Nicki Nicole and Nathy Peluso), Aguilera continued to flex her versatility and vulnerability with songs like the impassioned Mexican ranchera \"La Reina\" and the somber \"No Es Que Te Extrañe\" that found the artist healing her childhood trauma.\n\nY2K pop sweetheart Mandy Moore, who returned after an 11-year music hiatus with 2020's Silver Landings, kept the momentum going with her seventh album In Real Life. The folk-inspired record showcased Moore's strength as a songwriter and new motherhood.\n\nBut arguably the most unexpected return came from Britney Spears. Following the official termination of her conservatorship last November, the pop star freed herself from a decade of restrictions. Spears found her way back to the studio for the first time since the release of 2016's Glory album, and joined fellow pop legend — and longtime supporter — Elton John for \"Hold Me Closer.\" The song draws elements from John's classics like 1971's \"Tiny Dancer,\" 1976's \"Don't Go Breaking My Heart\" and 1992's \"The One,\" but adds a modern twist with shimmering dance melodies. \"Hold Me Closer\" debuted at No. 6 on the Billboard Hot 100, proving that Spears can still score a hit with ease.\n\nR&B Artists Danced Under The Disco Ball\n\nPop has seen a disco revival seeping in over the last few years (even including the return of ABBA!), but what made this year so different is witnessing more R&B-leaning artists putting a fun spin on dance music as a whole.\n\nLeading the charge was Beyoncé, who ignited a full-on dance party with her latest album (and first since 2016's Lemonade). After trying her hand at Afrobeats with 2019's soundtrack album, The Lion King: The Gift, Queen Bey transformed into Queen of the Dance Floor with 16 hip-shaking tunes whose influence call back to Studio 54 and Black ballroom heydays. The album is not only a tribute to her late Uncle Johnny (who she credits for introducing her to house music), but Black queer culture as a whole.\n\nNearly two years after 2020's After Hours, The Weeknd aptly kept the club open until sunrise with his fifth album, Dawn FM. Jam-packed with '80s elements from new wave to synth-pop, the record is an energetic joyride kookily narrated by comedian Jim Carrey.\n\nWhile he's widely known as a rap superstar, Drake channels his R&B crooning alter-ego from time to time. His seventh album, Honestly, Nevermind, arrived as a surprise in June — and he was clearly ready to kick off summer with a party. The album found the artist at the center of the dance floor as he explored house music with bouncy songs like \"Sticky\" and \"Massive.\" The experimentation paid off: the album became Drake's 11th Billboard 200 chart-topper.\n\nThrowback Samples Were Inescapable\n\nWhile sampling is more of a historical music staple than a trend, this year many artists had fun traveling back to the '70s, '90s and early '00s to add nostalgic doses into their hits. Beyoncé evoked the spirit of Donna Summer on \"Summer Renaissance,\" which pulls from the disco queen's 1977 jam, \"I Feel Love.\" Elsewhere, Charli XCX lifted the Stonebridge Mix of Robin S.'s 1992 \"Show Me Love\" for her own dance floor hit, \"Used To Know Me,\" while NYC-based EDM duo Sofi Tukker sampled Suzanne Vega's \"Tom's Diner\" for their infectious tune \"Summer In New York.\"\n\nThrowbacks were perhaps most predominant within mainstream rap hits. Tyga's \"Sunshine,\" a collaboration with Jhené Aiko and the late Pop Smoke, samples Lil Flip's 2004 hit of the same name, while Jack Harlow used Fergie's 2006 No. 1 smash \"Glamorous\" to create his own hit. Rap newcomers Armani White and Central Cee also traveled to the early '00s, with the former's N.O.R.E. sample heard throughout his debut single, \"Billie Eilish\" and the latter using Eve and Gwen Stefani's \"Let Me Blow Ya Mind\" for \"Doja.\"\n\nNicki Minaj and Yung Gravy took us back to the '80s, as Minaj flipped Rick James' 1981 single \"Super Freak\" into \"Super Freaky Girl, and Yung Gravy's viral \"Betty (Get Money)\" was based on Rick Astley's 1987 hit \"Never Gonna Give You Up.\"\n\nArtists Tapped Into Their Edgy Sides\n\nPop music can surely be wholesome, so it's always fun when artists try their hands at edgier sounds. Sam Smith has long proven they can do more than a heartfelt ballad, and their TikTok anthem with Slut Pop star Kim Petras found the pair at their naughtiest.\n\nDove Cameron shed her Disney Channel beginnings with February's \"Boyfriend\" single, which celebrated her queer identity with dark, spine-tingling production. She raised the intensity levels with August's \"Breakfast,\" which flipped gender politics on its head.\n\nMaggie Lindemann also traded pure pop for pop-punk for her debut album, ​​Suckerpunch. Continuing the Gen Z angst that rattled 2021, Lindemann unapologetically rebels against the music she was previously associated with thanks to singles like the nostalgic \"Cages\" and the incredibly flirtatious \"She Knows It.\"\n\nEven Taylor Swift got in on the fun. The singer, who previously showcased her edgy side with 2017's reputation, further leaned into that style with her hazy tenth album, Midnights. A complete left turn from 2020's folk-inspired LPs, folklore and evermore, Midnights captured the restlessness, revenge fantasies, self-criticism, and curiosity that come with what she detailed as \"13 sleepless nights scattered throughout my life.\"\n\nBlack Pop Divas Made Long-Awaited Returns\n\nAfter Rihanna and Beyoncé officiated their pop icon statuses with 2015's Anti and 2016's Lemonade, respectively, the two opted to take mini hiatuses from solo music. Beyoncé steadily remained in the music sphere, hopping on several collaborations including a remix of Megan Thee Stallion's 2021 hit \"Savage.\" The song scored GRAMMY Awards for Best Rap Song and Best Rap Performance, the latter of which helped crown Beyoncé as the artist with the most wins in GRAMMY history with 28. (She followed up the achievement by recording \"Be Alive\" for the King Richard soundtrack, which earned Oscar and Golden Globe nominations for Best Original Song.)\n\nBut Beyoncé focused the spotlight back on herself with her seventh studio album. The July release was a pop culture phenomenon, weaving itself into casual conversations, memes, TikTok dance challenges and more. The album is a celebration of not only Beyoncé's career, but Black influence on dance music as a whole.\n\nRihanna was more quiet following Anti — only appearing on a few collaborations here and there, including Calvin Harris' \"This Is What You Came For,\" DJ Khaled's \"Wild Thoughts\" with Bryson Tiller and Kendrick Lamar's GRAMMY-winning \"Loyalty\" — to focus on building her Fenty beauty and lingerie empire. But fans never stopped craving new music from the star herself, and their prayers were finally answered in September in major fashion: The superstar announced in September that she'll headline the Super Bowl LVII halftime show, which will mark her first live showing in over five years.\n\nRihanna quickly kept the excitement going with two appearances on October's Black Panther: Wakanda Forever soundtrack, \"Lift Me Up\" and \"Born Again\" — her first solo music in more than six years.\n\nRap's TikTok Takeover Was Still In Effect\n\nRap was one of the biggest genres on TikTok last year, and the trend remained strong in 2022. The dominance was seen through dance challenges and viral memes, with Lil Uzi Vert's infectious Jersey club smash \"I Just Wanna Rock\" creating an explosive wave that culminated in a dance-heavy music video.\n\nDrake and 21 Savage's \"Rich Flex,\" a highlight from their collaboration album, Her Loss, was transformed into a silly tongue-in-cheek meme. Brooklyn rap newcomer Lola Brooke had TikTokers feeling confident as ever as they used \"Don't Play With It\" to soundtrack their selfie videos. Even Lil Wayne and Soulja Boy's nostalgic jams had a resurgence, with 2008's \"Lollipop\" and 2018's \"Pretty Boy Swag\" spawning their own TikTok trends.\n\nEd Sheeran Was Pop's Big Brother\n\nDespite being one of the biggest pop stars in the world, Ed Sheeran has maintained the humble spirit that made him so beloved. The British singer/songwriter has always shown a love for collaboration, even releasing a guest-filled project in 2019. But in 2022, Sheeran put collaborations into overdrive.\n\nSheeran kicked things off by teaming up with his old pal Taylor Swift on a duet version of his = track, \"The Joker and the Queen.\" In March, he dropped not one but two singles with Colombian star J Balvin, \"Sigue\" and \"Forever My Love,\" where Sheeran traded his guitar for a reggaeton bassline.\n\nThe singer then traveled across genres — and the globe — pairing with Jamaican dancehall singer Ishawna (who previously sampled 2017's \"Shape of You\" on her single \"Equal Rights\") for \"Brace It\" and guesting on Nigerian hitmaker Burna Boy's love song \"For My Hand.\" Not forgetting his own roots, Sheeran also showcased his admiration for local British hip-hop with appearances on Manchester rapper Aitch's \"My G\" and rap collective D-Block Europe's \"Lonely Lovers.\"\n\nBands Proved Rock & Roll Is Here To Stay\n\n\"Rock 'n' roll is dead\" has been an ongoing debate ever since hip-hop became the industry's most dominant genre in 2017. Even so, rock acts continued to spotlight the historic genre this year, and helped it endure in arguably the biggest way it has in years.\n\nAfter a five-year hiatus, Paramore thrilled fans with the announcement of their sixth album, This Is Why. Set for a February 2023 release, the new album era kicked off with the funky eponymous lead single in September.\n\nRock mainstays Red Hot Chili Peppers satiated genre diehards by dropping two albums within six months in 2022: April's Unlimited Love and October's Return of the Dream Canteen.\n\nOn the more alternative side, Arctic Monkeys re-emerged with a vintage focus for October's The Car, which drew from baroque pop, funk, early '70s rock and classic film scores. And after a brief pandemic-induced postponement following 2020's Notes on a Conditional Form, The 1975 returned with their fifth album, Being Funny in a Foreign Language. Singles like \"Part of the Band,\" \"Happiness\" and \"I'm in Love with You\" found the band in a lighthearted, '80s dance-pop-inspired spirit.\n\nAfter a year filled with viral moments and comebacks, there's no doubt that artists will continue to keep pop unpredictable in 2023.\n\n5 Essential Power Pop Albums From 2022: Dazy, Young Guv, The Beths & More"
