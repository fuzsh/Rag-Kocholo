Explore ground-level forest trails, then climb to high walkways and towers. Become part of a world of magic and mischief: create a cacophony on outdoor musical instruments and match pairs on our giant memory game, or strike a Plotters’ Portrait pose and cause chaos with our spinning signposts.\n\nVisitors young and old will love getting lost amongst exhilarating views, sky-high turrets and treetop tunnels, before spreading out on the stargazing deck and slipping down the slide. Send your fellow plotters coded messages through the Talking Tubes, and spot enemies in the Mischief Mirrors. And for the very smallest rebels, there’s a dedicated toddler area: think mini turrets, climbing equipment, slide and a chalkboard for drawing secret squiggles.\n\nFor centuries, Raby Castle has been home to men and women who stood up for their beliefs and changed the course of history; plus those who weren’t so lucky and ended up in big trouble. Which will you prove to be: a Plucky Plotter or a Rotten Rebel? Find out in The Plotters’ Forest.\n\nBirthday Parties, Private Events and Groups\n\nWe are now offering Raby Rebels the chance to host their very own birthday party or group event in The Plotters’ Forest. Enjoy exclusive hire of our new woodland playground– just for you and your guests. Experience a world of magic and mischief as you get lost amongst exhilarating views, sky-high turrets and treetop tunnels before finishing your event at the Plotters’ Pantry where you can head up onto the rooftop deck for further celebrations.\n\n“I just wanted to write and say thank you for a wonderful party. Amelie and her friends had an amazing time. A big thank you to Daisy and Diane who were brilliant. They were both a great help in making the party run smoothly.” – Caroline\n\nTo find out more and make an enquiry please email admin@raby.co.uk"
