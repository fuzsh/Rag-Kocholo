        "text": "The photographs in the attachment are from 1965, at Moorland Park, the Newcastle club's original tiny track - 33 seconds for four laps, and narrow - so given the extravagant handlebars displayed by Keith and his team-mates there was never a chance of getting all four riders in line abreast on the start line - Keith showing an eye for the camera as he strains at the tape (a few years later there was a pukka starting gate, but woe betide anyone colliding with it due to its solid construction).\n\nThe 'lucky coincidence' mentioned in the photo caption was the publication of Harold Smith's 1966 Cycle Speedway Annual, in which we found the name and address of a Newcastle club (Keith and his mates), and this led to a regular Test series between Newcastle and South Shields, which both teams in their ignorance thought was a first, and only discovered much later the extent of activity on post-war Tyneside involving both locations.\n\nKeith was chuffed to merit a mention in Rod's '50 years of CS' and in Dave Murphy's 75th Anniversary edition, and he turned out for Hawbush in some matches when he was working in London, but his true legacy is the massive website chronicling the history of the sport in the North East, covering its origins in the years after World War II and through the seventy years running up to the revival at Cramlington, and which led to a phone call I received from a voice not heard for forty years."
