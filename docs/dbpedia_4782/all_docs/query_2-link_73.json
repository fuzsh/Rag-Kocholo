        "text": "There are so many things I'd like to change about the sport (off-sides, pk tiebreakers, VAR, competitive parity, time wasting, etc.). But on the topic of the SL, here's how I'd set it up:\n\nThe SL would consist of 5-7 League champions from the Top ranked leagues and the 12 group champions from a prelim group stage. This makes it a real \"Champions League\". Later years would include the reigning SL champ as well as the SL Cup champion (Europa Cup winner) for a 19-Team League.\n\nThe prelim group stage has 12 groups of 5 teams each seeded by their coefficient rankings. Each team in a group plays the others just once however (2 Home and 2 Away) to lessen fixture congestion. I'd modify the points system as follows:\n\n3-Point AWAY Wins | 2-Point HOME Wins | 1-Point Advantaged DRAW.\n\nAn Advantaged Draw is based on an in-game stat that favors the team with the most effective attacking movements short of a Goal. This stat IMO is the Dropped Save.\n\nA Dropped Save is when you force the keeper to make a save that knocks the ball to the ground or out of bounds. If two teams have the same amount then the team that forced the game's 1st dropped save gets the Advantage Draw point. If no dropped saves in the game, then the away team gets advantage.\n\nThe 12 group winners go on to the SL Champions League while the #2 and #3 teams in the group proceed to the SL Cup qualifiers (Europa).\n\nThe SL Cup will start with Home-Away matches for the paired teams. A round of 24, then a round of 12, and then a round of 6 until we have 3 finalists left.\n\nThese 3 finalists will then be merged back in with the mid-table SL teams to create the SL Cup's final runoff of matches. This may seem overly complicated but I feel it keeps the SL mid-table games competitive and interesting.\n\nNow in the SL Champions League, the 19 teams will play each other just once (9 Home, 9 Away) using the modified points systems described earlier. 18 games total.\n\nTeams that finish in the Bottom 4 Spots (#16 to #19) suffer a huge drop to their ranking coefficient, thus group seeding gets more difficult for them in the future. This makes it like a relegation battle at the bottom of the table.\n\nThe #1 team secures home field advantage and their spot in the SL Final game. The #2 team plays a single home match against the #5 team while the #3 plays a home match against the #4 team.\n\nThose winners then play each other at the higher ranked team's home in the Semi-Final. Then the winner plays the #1 team in the Final to crown the overall champion. This makes for better TV than simply crowning the #1 team as champion.\n\nMid-table SL teams would essentially be competing for an advantaged position in the SL Cup Final Runoffs in order to keep the mid-table league games competitive.\n\nThe #10, #11, #12 SL teams play AWAY to the 3 SL Cup finalists mentioned earlier. This is a single game with the Advantaged Draw rule applying as mentioned earlier.\n\nThose 3 match winners then play AWAY against the #7, #8, #9 SL Teams at their home.\n\nThe #6 SL team then joins those 3 match winners to form the SL Cup QF teams. The #6 gets home field advantage while the other matches' home advantage is based on ranking. Semi-Finals and Cup Final then follow with the same rules applying.\n\nPotential Issues:\n\nFixture Congestion: The SL teams in this system play an exhausting 18 games in the regular campaign, not to mention the 4 prelim group games and potential extra Cup/Finals runoff games. I used the points system, home advantage runoffs and other tricks to reduce the quantity of matches while ensuring that every team in the Champions SL still plays the others at least once.\n\nI'd like to see this modified points system get used in the domestic league campaigns along with a similar reduction in the number of domestic league fixtures. This would allow less congestion for these SL/SLC games to be played. These are just ideas and I know the purists will object to a lot of my approaches to the problems anyway.\n\nWhen it comes to financial and competitive fairness, I'm actually against the use of salary caps and other money-based tactics to control the unfair advantage some clubs have over others. I feel that rich clubs (and people) always have an army of lawyers and accountants that would give them many ways to get around such regulations.\n\nInstead, I'd favor a more football-related strategy by establishing a Player Tier system to maintain fairness. Professional Footballers would be ranked into 3 Tiers based on their positional stats and rankings over the course of a full season. They would rise or fall in levels only after a full season of stats have been assessed.\n\nThe top 10 players in each position in a league would be Tier-1 while the next 10 ranked for each position would be Tier-2.\n\nTier-3 would include all u-21 players and the remaining lower-ranked positional players in the league.\n\nInternational Transfers would carry over their previous Tier ranking to their new league for their 1st season.\n\nA team can only have two T-1 players, four T-2 players and an unlimited number of T-3 players for any single domestic game roster.\n\nThese limits can be raised for European competitions however, or simply changed around a bit if people feel they're too restrictive. The main thing is that it establishes competitive results through fair football merits rather than money.\n\nIf a team has too many T-1 players on its full roster, they'll simply have to loan them out to other teams OR spread them out effectively throughout the various games.\n\nNot only would it make the matches more competitive, but then it helps us see how good these players and managers really are when they're working with a more even playing field.\n\nFor me the system they were proposing wasn't too outlandish, save for there should be no permanent members.\n\nIf I were running a Super League I'd mirror what they do in Euroleague Basketball and offer medium term \"A licenses\" for a period of 5-10 years. The license would be reviewed the year before expiry, to be renewed a club would have to show it had won X number of domestic titles and placed in the top 3 of it's domestic league X number of times. This eliminates the argument that the teams competing wouldn't compete properly in the domestic league as they would have to do so to ensure their continued Super League status. There would also be some sort of financial requirement for the A license to be renewed, eg not carrying toxic levels of debt and not breaching FFP.\n\nThe league wouldn't be a completely closed shop with shorter term \"B licenses\" issued to teams who win certain domestic leagues (based on the highest UEFA country ranking), and the winner of the Champions league. These shorter licenses might be for two seasons or one.\n\nControversial perhaps, but I would also have an annual \"wildcard\" slot which could be given to a team who perhaps has had it's prospects transformed overnight by being bought by billionaires and could thus reasonably complete in the transfer market with the Super League sides, or perhaps a team that has simply performed well over the past few seasons in domestic and European competition.\n\nThis is what more or less what they do in Euroleague Basketball and to be honest that works quite well."
