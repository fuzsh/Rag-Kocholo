        "text": "Choose a Staff Member:\n\nAndy Pringle\n\nTitle\n\nWomen's Soccer Assistant Coach\n\nAndy Pringle first joined the UNLV staff as goalkeeper coach in February of 2013. He was promoted to full-time assistant in spring 2014 and led the team during the head coaching transition, and then was kept on staff by Chris Shaw and elevated to the top assistant position. Pringle[apos]s roles with the team will include: goalkeeper training, scouting opposition, assisting with recruitment, assisting with training and development of players in practice and game settings, and game day organization. As the goalkeeper coach in 2013, he oversaw Kylie Wassell to a season that included five shutouts, 86 saves and a GAA of just 1.16 in over 2,000 minutes play, en route to being named all-conference. Before moving to Las Vegas in 2012, Pringle built an extensive club and high school coaching resume in Southern California and still runs a goalkeeper school there. In addition to his role at UNLV, he now works as the Director of Coaching for a local club as well as goalkeeper coach for Nevada ODP. He currently holds a USSF C license and NSCAA Advanced National Goalkeeping Diploma. Pringle is also currently attending classes at UNLV while working on his degree. Growing up in Newcastle, England, Pringle was a product of the Newcastle United youth system, enjoying four years there before moving on to several other professional clubs. In the U.S., he won the U19 National Championship with Nomads of San Diego and played in the A-League and USL."
