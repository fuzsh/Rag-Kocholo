        "text": "Australian Survivor: Titans v Rebels is the ninth season of the Network Ten incarnation of the competitive reality TV show Australian Survivor.\n\nIntroducing a cast of 24 new players, Titans v Rebels featured high-octane gameplay at every juncture as allegiances flowed dynamically and relationships imploded and mended on a daily basis. Season highlights include the breakdown of the Middle-Aged Mafia, the volatile friendship-rivalry between Rebels Feras Basal and Kirby Bentley, and the constant shifts in power after the merge. After weeks of intense strategy and numerous blindsides, Feras emerged as the Sole Survivor, defeating Titan Caroline Courtis in a unanimous vote.\n\nProduction[]\n\nThe season was filmed in Upolu, Samoa, also the location of the previous season.[2]\n\nTwists/Changes[]\n\nTitans v Rebels: Divided into two tribes, the \"utterly ruthless\" Titans would take on the Rebels who live by a \"different set of rules\".[3]\n\nHidden Immunity Idol\n\nBuried Treasure: In addition to the idols initially hidden at each tribe camp, another idol was contained in a padlocked treasure chest, the key to which was given to the tribe that won the fourth Reward Challenge. Along with the idol was another key which could be given to a member of the opposing tribe to unlock their chest.\n\nLeave Feast: On Day 24, members from both tribes were offered a choice between a feast and a clue to a newly planted Hidden Immunity Idol. Those who picked the clue would head back to camp immediately to commence their search.\n\nMock Vote\n\nSaboteur: The tribe that lost the fifth Immunity Challenge would vote to send one member to the opposing tribe and \"sabotage\" them in the upcoming Immunity Challenge. If the opposing tribe lost, the \"saboteur\" would rejoin their original tribe before the vote at Tribal Council.\n\nTribe Switch: The tribe that lost the eleventh Immunity Challenge would not vote to eliminate a member. Rather, they were informed that the members who received votes would draw rocks to determine who would permanently switch to the other tribe.\n\nTribe Switch: On Day 15, a tribe switch occurred, shuffling the final 19 into two new tribes.\n\nLimited Voters and Voting Options: On Day 21, the losing tribe competed in an individual Immunity Challenge where only the first three members to finish would be able to vote; they would also be ineligible from receiving votes.\n\nEarly Merge: This season merged with 14 castaways remaining.\n\nSafety Without Power: The winner of the first post-merge Reward Challenge also received immunity at the first post-merge Tribal Council, but would not be able to vote.\n\nUltimate Vote: This advantage grants its holder the right to unilaterally decide the outcome of a Tribal Council, provided everyone else voted against them at that Tribal Council. Like the Hidden Immunity Idol, this advantage is played after the votes are cast, but before they are read. This advantage was secretly introduced as part of one of the items at the Survivor Auction on Day 32 and must be played within the next three Tribal Councils.\n\nFinal Tribal Council Format: Two finalists faced a jury of nine.\n\nCastaways[]\n\nContestant Tribe Affiliation Finish Votes\n\nAgainst Original Tribe First Post-\n\nSwap Tribe Original Tribe1 Switched Tribe Second Post-\n\nSwap Tribe Merged Tribe Frankie Guascoine\n\n33, Bondi, NSW\n\nSalon Owner Titans 1st Voted Out\n\nDay 2 8 Jessica Danaher\n\n33, Melbourne, VIC\n\nProfessional Academic Titans 2nd Voted Out\n\nDay 5 10 Peta Bennett\n\n33, Perth, WA\n\nBar Manager Rebels 3rd Voted Out\n\nDay 7 6 Tobias Grant\n\n41, Byron Bay, NSW\n\nConstruction Manager Rebels 4th Voted Out\n\nDay 9 5 Nathan Freeman\n\n28, Melbourne, VIC\n\nAFL Agent Titans Titans Titans 5th Voted Out\n\nDay 14 10 Viola Jokudu\n\n22, Sydney, NSW\n\nPowerlifter Titans Titans Titans Rebels 6th Voted Out\n\nDay 16 6 Sarah Moore\n\n24, Newcastle, NSW\n\nFirefighter Rebels Rebels Rebels Rebels 7th Voted Out\n\nDay 18 5 Garrick Wildman\n\n59, Gold Coast, QLD\n\nLoss Prevention Officer Rebels Rebels Rebels Titans 8th Voted Out\n\nDay 20 6 Charles Noonan\n\n35, Melbourne, VIC\n\nLitigation Lawyer Titans Titans Titans Titans 9th Voted Out\n\nDay 21 3 Kelli Harris\n\n52, Cairns, QLD\n\nPsychologist Rebels Titans Rebels Titans Titans 10th Voted Out\n\nDay 25 12 Scott Butler\n\n31, Hobart, TAS\n\nArt Director Rebels Rebels Rebels Titans Titans Tasi Quit\n\nDay 27 0 Winna Bhun\n\n25, Sydney, NSW\n\nCompetitive Eater Titans Titans Titans Titans Titans 11th Voted Out\n\nDay 29 8 Eden Porter\n\n39, Melbourne, VIC\n\nCinema Area Manager Titans Titans Titans Rebels Rebels 12th Voted Out\n\nDay 31 13 Aileen Chong\n\n27, Melbourne, VIC\n\nWaitress Rebels Rebels Rebels Titans Titans 13th Voted Out\n\n1st Jury Member\n\nDay 33 7 Jaden Laing\n\n28, Upper Coomera, QLD\n\nStrongman Titans Titans Titans Rebels Rebels 14th Voted Out\n\n2nd Jury Member\n\nDay 35 8 Valeria Sizova\n\n31, Sydney, NSW\n\nEntertainment Business Owner Titans Titans Titans Titans Titans 15th Voted Out\n\n3rd Jury Member\n\nDay 37 3 Alex Coe\n\n26, Perth, WA\n\nMaths Teacher Rebels Rebels Rebels Rebels Titans 16th Voted Out\n\n4th Jury Member\n\nDay 39 13 Rianna Bowley\n\n31, Adelaide, SA\n\nParamedic Rebels Rebels Rebels Rebels Rebels 17th Voted Out\n\n5th Jury Member\n\nDay 41 7 Kitty Blomfield\n\n42, Gold Coast, QLD\n\nBusiness Owner Titans Titans Titans Rebels Rebels 18th Voted Out\n\n6th Jury Member\n\nDay 42 4 Kirby Bentley\n\n37, Melbourne, VIC\n\nAFLW Coach Rebels Rebels Rebels Titans Titans 19th Voted Out\n\n7th Jury Member\n\nDay 44 9 Raymond Chaney\n\n27, Central Coast, NSW\n\nRetail Rebels Rebels Rebels Titans Titans Eliminated\n\n8th Jury Member\n\nDay 45 25 Mark Warnock\n\n35, Townsville, QLD\n\nFormer Diplomat Titans Titans Titans Rebels Rebels 20th Voted Out\n\n9th Jury Member\n\nDay 46 10 Caroline Courtis\n\n55, Melbourne, VIC\n\nMidwife Titans Titans Titans Rebels Rebels Runner-Up 12 Feras Basal\n\n28, Sydney, NSW\n\nHR Manager Rebels Rebels Rebels Titans Titans Sole Survivor 4\n\nNotes:\n\n^1 After the Titans lost the sixth Immunity Challenge, Kelli returned to the Rebels tribe, leaving everyone back on their original tribes.\n\nSeason Summary[]\n\nThe season began with the twenty-four contestants divided into two tribes of twelve: The \"Titans\", known for being the top of their profession, and the \"Rebels\", known for their free-spirited nature. In the early days of the game, both tribes forewent tribal strength in favor of personal loyalties. On the Titans, the \"Middle-Aged Mafia\" alliance of Caroline, Eden, Kitty, and Mark established dominance; while on the Rebels, Feras and Kirby aligned early, but gradually grew suspicious and distrustful of one another.\n\nFollowing a tribe switch on Day 15, the Middle-Aged Mafia maintained their control on the new Rebels tribe, though at the cost of Mark's trust when they chose to blindside his ally Viola. Meanwhile with the new Titans, Valeria rose to power, finding herself the swing-vote between Feras and Kirby's feuding alliances. The two tribes merged into Tasi on Day 26, consisting of seven members from each original starting tribe.\n\nThe post-merge game was dominated by an unpredictable and fluid power structure. Though the original Rebels initially gained the upper-hand, the dysfunction between Feras and Kirby persevered, leading to the elimination of the latter at the final five. Though Mark had gone on an immunity run, he ultimately lost the Final Immunity Challenge to Feras, who chose to take Caroline to the Final Tribal Council with him.\n\nFacing the jury, Caroline was heavily criticized for her passive gameplay, while Feras was critiqued for his indecision surrounding his Hidden Immunity Idol plays. In the end however, the jury valued Feras' honesty and risks more over Caroline's strategic control, giving him the title of Sole Survivor in a unanimous 9-0 vote.\n\nEpisode Air Date Challenges Eliminated\n\n(vote) Finish Ratings Reward Immunity 1 \"We've All Seen This Movie\" January 29, 2024 Rebels Rebels Frankie\n\n(8-4) 1st Voted Out\n\nDay 2 2 \"The Invisible Hand\" January 30, 2024 Rebels1 Rebels Jessica\n\n(6-4-1) 2nd Voted Out\n\nDay 5 Titans1 3 \"The Cuddle Club\" January 31, 2024 Titans Titans Peta\n\n(6-3-3) 3rd Voted Out\n\nDay 7 4 \"B Is for Blindside\" February 4, 2024 Rebels Titans Tobias\n\n(5-3-0)2 4th Voted Out\n\nDay 9 5 \"Where Angels Fear to Tread\" February 5, 2024 Rebels Titans Kelli\n\n(9-1)3 Sent to Titans\n\nDay 12 6 \"The Saboteur\" February 6, 2024 Rebels Rebels Nathan\n\n(6-3-1) 5th Voted Out\n\nDay 14 7 \"Get, or Get Got\" February 11, 2024 None Titans Viola\n\n(6-2-1) 6th Voted Out\n\nDay 16 8 \"The Divorce\" February 12, 2024 None Titans Sarah\n\n(4-3-0)2 7th Voted Out\n\nDay 18 9 \"Excited for the Actions\" February 13, 2024 Titans Rebels Garrick\n\n(6-3-1) 8th Voted Out\n\nDay 20 10 \"Bad Hair Day\" February 18, 2024 None Rebels Charles\n\n(1-1-0\n\n2-1)2,4,5 9th Voted Out\n\nDay 21 Aileen Kirby Feras 11 \"It's Not Sarong, It's So Right\" February 19, 2024 None Titans Alex\n\n(4-3)6 Sent to Titans\n\nDay 23 12 \"To Infinity and Beyond\" February 20, 2024 None Rebels Kelli\n\n(8-1) 10th Voted Out\n\nDay 25 13 \"Revenge Is a Dish Best Served Russian\" February 25, 2024 Valeria7 Scott\n\n(no vote) Quit\n\nDay 27 Winna 14 \"A Line in the Sand\" February 26, 2024 None Rianna Winna\n\n(6-5-1-1) 11th Voted Out\n\nDay 29 15 \"Master and Apprentice\" February 27, 2024 Mark\n\n[Caroline,\n\nKitty,\n\nValeria] Jaden Eden\n\n(6-6;\n\n6-4)5,8 12th Voted Out\n\nDay 31 16 \"The Wedge\" March 3, 2024 Survivor\n\nAuction Kitty Aileen\n\n(7-4) 13th Voted Out\n\n1st Jury Member\n\nDay 33 17 \"Floater or Flexible?\" March 4, 2024 None Rianna Jaden\n\n(5-4-0)2 14th Voted Out\n\n2nd Jury Member\n\nDay 35 18 \"The Best Actor Award\" March 5, 2024 Alex\n\n[Feras,\n\nKitty,\n\nValeria] Kirby\n\n(Rianna)9 Valeria\n\n(1-0)10 15th Voted Out\n\n3rd Jury Member\n\nDay 37 19 \"How Do Rainbows Work?\" March 10, 2024 Alex\n\n[Caroline,\n\nKirby,\n\nRianna] Rianna Alex\n\n(6-2) 16th Voted Out\n\n4th Jury Member\n\nDay 39 20 \"Pride & Paranoia\" March 11, 2024 None Kirby Rianna\n\n(5-2) 17th Voted Out\n\n5th Jury Member\n\nDay 41 21 \"How to Build A Resume\" March 12, 2024 None Kirby Kitty\n\n(4-1-0)2 18th Voted Out\n\n6th Jury Member\n\nDay 42 22 \"Dilemmas of the End\" March 17, 2024 None Mark Kirby\n\n(4-1)8 19th Voted Out\n\n7th Jury Member\n\nDay 44 23 \"A Nation of One\" March 18, 2024 None Mark Raymond\n\n(2-2;\n\ntiebreaker)11 Eliminated\n\n8th Jury Member\n\nDay 45 24 \"The Fire That I Can Bring\" March 19, 2024 None Feras Mark\n\n(1-0) 20th Voted Out\n\n9th Jury Member\n\nDay 46 Jury Vote Caroline\n\n(9-0) Runner-Up Feras\n\n(9-0) Sole Survivor Notes:\n\n^1 This Reward Challenge was played in four rounds, with the winner of each round taking a different reward item.\n\n^2 A Hidden Immunity Idol was played, negating all votes against its user.\n\n^3 In a surprise twist, instead of voting out players, the Rebels would vote for one person to be swapped to the Titans.
