        "text": "Following the announcement of Joe Schmidt’s Wallabies squad, we pick our winners and losers from the Australia team to tackle the Springboks in their Rugby Championship opener.\n\nNew Zealander Schmidt has made bold selections as he takes on Rassie Erasmus’ charges for the first time in his new role after clashing with the Boks in the World Cup final last year.\n\nWhile the Wallabies squad starts to take shape under the ex-Ireland coach’s tutelage, injury has hit in key positions forcing some alterations.\n\nWinners\n\nFilipo Daugunu\n\nFilipo Daugunu has taken his opportunities in the Wallabies squad since Schmidt came in with both hands and after strong showings in the mid-year internationals, he retains his role.\n\nThis is despite the fact the world-class Marika Koroibete has been recalled to the squad and that he was red-carded in the clash against Georgia.\n\nThankfully for the flyer, he was able to serve out his suspension before the clash against the Springboks and will look to add to his three tries in three Test matches this year.\n\nHe will be put under enormous pressure, however, as he goes up against the brilliant Cheslin Kolbe.\n\nCarlo Tizzano\n\nInjuries create opportunities for others and that is the case for flanker Carlo Tizzano, who earns his Test debut for the Wallabies against the world champions. He comes in following the injuries to Luke Wright and Fraser McReight, who was in stunning form in July, and beats the likes of Tom Hooper and Luke Reimer to a starting role.\n\nTizzano was stuck behind McReight for the Junior Wallabies at youth level and earns his first cap after a tough journey to the Gold and Green. Following the Western Force’s exclusion from Super Rugby, he headed to the Waratahs in 2020 where he contended with Michael Hooper for the number seven jumper. He would move abroad to join Ealing Trailfinders before returning to the Force where he has shone for the side.\n\nLuke Reimer\n\nMany Brumbies fans weren’t pleased that Reimer was not called into the first Wallabies squad of the year but following the injuries in the back-row, he finally gets his opportunity to impress.\n\nHe is just yet another busy Australian flanker who thrives at the breakdown, which will be key for the Wallabies considering the fact that the Boks have included two openside flankers and fetchers on their bench along with the superb Malcolm Marx.\n\nLen Ikitau\n\nLen Ikitau has bounced back from his Rugby World Cup heartbreak in style, featuring in 12 of the Brumbies’ 16 Super Rugby Pacific matches.\n\nWhile he did not play in the two Tests against Wales, he did start against Georgia and has impressed Schmidt enough to catapult into the starting line-up ahead of the excellent Josh Flook.\n\nWhen on form, Ikitau is one of the finest outside centres in the game and he will be eager to express himself and show his class once again.\n\nNoah Lolesio\n\nThe Wallabies are yet to settle on who their starting half-backs are but Noah Lolesio looks to be leading the race for the number 10 shirt as things stand.\n\nHe was another who Eddie Jones did not fancy in 2023, with Ben Donaldson and the now-NRL convert Carter Gordon favoured, but has also responded to his World Cup disappointment well and has seemingly returned to Australia a more rounded player after a spell in France with Toulon.\n\nHe has a massive opportunity to strengthen his hold on the jersey this weekend against the Boks.\n\nTom Wright\n\nA similar storyline to Lolesio as Tom Wright was given two opportunities under Jones in 2023 before being dropped entirely from the squad and failed to crack the team for the World Cup.\n\nHowever, he looks to have the backing of the new boss as he starts at full-back for the fourth straight game this year.\n\nThe Springboks will be wary of his counter-attacking threat after he scored an absolute belter against Wales but Wright will remember the pressure he was put under in Pretoria last year too.\n\nIsaac Kailea\n\nThe Springboks are arguably the best scrummaging team on the international scene, if not they are at least the most aggressive, and it is a huge show of faith that Schmidt has backed the powerful Isaac Kailea to front up against the wily Frans Malherbe.\n\nKailea only made his Test debut in the first game against Wales but has come off the bench in each of the Wallabies’ Tests this year. A reluctant prop, he made the switch to front-row in 2018 after starting out his career as a back-rower and has enjoyed a meteoric rise, particularly this year.\n\nWallabies: Rookie prop backed to tackle mighty Springboks scrum as Joe Schmidt snubs Marika Koroibete\n\nLosers\n\nMissing props\n\nWhen all fit and firing, Angus Bell and Taniela Tupou are arguably the Wallabies’ best props but both will miss the clash against the Springboks – a telling blow considering the scrum battle that awaits.\n\nBell has struggled with injuries throughout 2024 and has just returned to fitness and with a view of what is still to come this year, it is understandable that Schmidt is not keen to throw him right back into the mix against a well-oiled team like South Africa.\n\nMeanwhile, Tupou misses the clash as he is on bereavement leave and while it is a blow for Australia, Schmidt is keen to see what Zane Nonggorr can do, explaining that the side cannot be too overly reliant on certain players.\n\nJosh Flook\n\nThe quality in the Wallabies’ midfield is apparent with Flook snubbed entirely from the matchday 23 despite an excellent first two caps against Wales. Flook has been churning out standout performances for the Reds for several seasons now and would have loved to turn out in front of a sold-out home ground this weekend, but it is not to be.\n\nFraser McReight\n\nArguably the Wallabies’ form player throughout the July internationals, along with fellow back-rower Rob Valetini, which makes McReight’s untimely injury even more gutting.\n\nThe 25-year-old has really come into his own this year after cementing his position in the starting XV last year and his absence is a crucial blow for the side.\n\nWestern Force half-backs\n\nThe Springbok players may well be pleased that they will not have to deal with Nic White’s gamesmanship this weekend with Cobus Reinach addressing the half-back’s sledging, shoving and antics earlier in the week.\n\nThe experienced number nine is overlooked along with his Western Force partner Donaldson, who was reportedly in line for a start earlier in the week.\n\nBoth players can add huge value to the matchday 23 but ultimately, Schmidt has backed the Reds pairing of Tate McDermott and Tom Lynagh on the bench with Jake Gordon and Lolesio in the starting XV."
