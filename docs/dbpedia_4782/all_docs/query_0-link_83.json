        "text": "Coach Damien Hill has followed Test five-eighth James O'Connor out the door at the Melbourne Rebels with the Super Rugby side appointing Wallabies coaching co-ordinator Tony McGahan.\n\nThe Rebels announced on Monday that they had signed McGahan as head coach for two seasons.\n\nMcGahan, who was most recently part of Robbie Deans' unsuccessful campaign against the British and Irish Lions, will take over from Hill next month.\n\nMcGahan enjoyed success at Irish giants Munster, winning Europe's Heineken Cup in 2006 and 2008 and he also coached them to a win over the touring Wallabies in 2010.\n\n\"Tony comes to Melbourne highly regarded as an international coach with a record of success at the top level,\" said Rebels chief executive Rob Clarke.\n\n\"In particular, his time at Munster was a memorable period with multiple titles in the Heineken Cup and Celtic League (now RaboDirect Pro 12).\"\n\nClarke paid tribute to Hill, who was asked to re-apply for his job midway through his second season as head coach.\n\n\"Hilly is a quality man, and he has made a significant contribution to our club,\" said Clarke.\n\n\"During our foundation period Damien has had to deal with a variety of challenging circumstances both on and off the field.\n\n\"At all times he has managed himself professionally, with integrity and has always earned the highest level of respect from his players and staff.\"\n\nThe Rebels have only managed four wins this season, with their final game on Friday night against the Highlanders.\n\nThe departure of Hill continues the raft of sweeping changes at the fledgling franchise.\n\nThe Rebels announced on Sunday that O'Connor would not be given a new contract.\n\nAmong the players leaving are Wallaby half-back Nick Phipps, Gareth Delve, Tim Davidson, Nic Henderson, James King, Richard Kingi, Ged Robinson and Cooper Vuna."
