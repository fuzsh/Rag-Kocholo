        "text": "The Penobscot Bay YMCA recently welcomed Jan Leth and Chad MacDermid to its Board of Directors.\n\nJan Leth moved to Maine in 2012, after serving decades as World Wide Chief Creative Officer for Digital at Ogilvy Advertising, a global full-service marketing and communications company. He now resides in Camden with his young daughter and wife.\n\nChad MacDermid, a transplant with his family from New York seven years ago, runs his own company, MacDermid Fine Art Solutions, which specializes in fine art logistics and consulting with clients ranging from individual artists and artist foundations to art institutions and collectors. He resides in Camden with his wife and two children and loves being a part of the year-round Midcoast community.\n\n“We are thrilled to welcome Jan and Chad to our board of directors where they will bring invaluable perspectives to help us grow,” said Whitney Files, Chief Executive Officer for the Penobscot Bay YMCA, in a news release. “As parents with children actively involved in our programs, they both share a deep, personal commitment to our mission, making them perfect additions to our team.”"
