        "text": "Words by Rod Thompson for Newcastle Weekly.\n\nThe Maitland Pickers have dominated Tooheys Newcastle Rugby League (Real NRL), and state rivals, over the past few seasons.\n\nAnd, new president John Gorman is determined to maintain that supremacy on and off the field.\n\nHe’s following in the illustrious footsteps of Frank Lawler, who recently called time on his role in the top job after nine consecutive years.\n\nHis predecessor not only built a strong organisation for local juniors to be proud of, he tasted plenty of success with the Pickers winning the 2022 Denton Engineering Cup, 2020 and 2022 NSW President’s Cups, 2021 and 2022 Real NRL Club Championships, an under-19 crown (2018), an open title (2019), and locked in a partnership with Club Maitland City to introduce an A grade netball side into the elite Hunter-based competition.\n\n“I’ve got big shoes to fill,” Gorman said.\n\n“Frank’s done amazingly well.\n\n“However, I’ve been lucky enough to have worked with him for the past three seasons.\n\n“So, it’s made the transition a lot easier.\n\n“Plus, he’s only a phone call away – he’ll still help us out.\n\n“It’s not like we’ve lost him from the Pickers.\n\n“But, for me personally, it’s a massive privilege to take on this responsibility.\n\n“We’re in such a strong position at the moment.\n\n“So, to be elected as president is an honour.”\n\nThe frightening thing, for Maitland’s opponents, is that Gorman believes the Pickers are in better shape in 2023 than what the club was at the start of last year.\n\n“That’s really saying something,” he told the Newcastle Weekly.\n\n“You only have to look out on the paddock (recently) – we had six guys (Garry Anderson, James Bradley, Chad O’Donnell, Jayden Butterfield, Lincoln Smith and James Taylor) in the Newcastle Rebels and two (Reid Alchin and Cal Burgess) – in the Newcastle Knights’ NSW Cup line-up.\n\n“The latter pair could be back with us at some stage of the season if they don’t kick on at the Knights.\n\n“So, that’s a huge achievement to boast eight (senior) reps running around.\n\n“We’ve got a good crop of youngsters coming through as well.\n\n“All our junior affiliates want to get on board a lot more… they see the pathways now.\n\n“They basically just want to feed into that.\n\n“I’m still receiving messages from clubs wanting to align their under-16s with us as of this year.\n\n“So, there’s a ton of interest.\n\n“We’ll possibly field two under-17 teams, too… one will be West Maitland and the other East Maitland.\n\n“They’ve been training with us since pre-season began in November, so it’s a really exciting time ahead.”\n\nWhile the obvious goal is to defend the Denton Engineering Cup, Gorman admitted Maitland had eyes on a bigger prize as well.\n\n“To go back-to-back would be perfect,” he said.\n\n“However, from a Pickers’ perspective, it’s all about winning the Newcastle Rugby League Club Championship.\n\n“That’s an enormous thing for us.\n\n“We’d love to secure it for a third consecutive season.\n\n“Even though COVID cost us a first grade crown in 2021, we still picked up the Club Championship and did it again last year.\n\n“So, that’s a high priority to claim the hat-trick in 2023.\n\n“Thankfully, we’ve retained the nucleus of the squad, although Perry Le Brocque retired.\n\n“We have also snared a couple of kids from Group 21 to have a crack.\n\n“Muswellbrook/Denman’s Bailey Taylor will be very handy and keep a few guys on their toes.\n\n“A young Morpeth junior, Luke Sharpe, is returning as well.\n\n“He’s been down in Sydney with the Roosters and was supposed to spend the pre-season with the Wests Tigers.\n\n“However, he’s come home for family reasons, to our benefit.\n\n“I don’t think people really appreciate how good our nursery is.\n\n“For example, guys like Brock Lamb, Sam Anderson and Garry Anderson – they’re all juniors or homegrown products.”"
