        "text": "It's no secret that world football, particularly the Premier League, has grown in popularity in the U.S. by leaps and bounds over the last decade-plus. Many fans have found a sense of community in the sport, whether it's waking up early on the weekends to drag themselves to a bar to root on their favorite team, or engaging in fan clubs and supporters' groups, shrinking the geographic distance between themselves and their new obsession.\n\nBut for newer fans, the prospect of immersing oneself in a whole new world can be a bit daunting. There are new traditions to absorb, personalities to explore, and, of course, rules to learn. But don't worry, USA Insider has you covered. Today's topic: the ins and outs of the Premier League table.\n\nRELATED: Where to Watch the Premier League\n\nHow much are wins and draws worth in the Premier League?\n\nPositioning on the Premier League table, in the end, generally boils down to cumulative point totals, which are derived from assigning different point values to wins and draws. A win gives a team three points while only one point is awarded for a draw. No points are credited for a loss.\n\nPhoto: Richard Sellers/Sportsphoto/Allstar via Getty Images\n\nWhat happens if two teams have the same number of points?\n\nIf there are multiple teams that finish with the same number of points, placement in the Premier League table is determined by the goal difference which is, simply put, the number of goals scored subtracted by the number of goals conceded. For example, if Arsenal scores 90 goals and concedes 30, their goal difference is a +60. The team with the higher goal difference is considered a step above their counterpart, even if they have the same point total.\n\nRELATED: Who Is Moises Caicedo, the Midfielder at the Center of Premier League's Most Dramatic Transfer Saga?\n\nPhoto: Shaun Botterill/Getty Images\n\nHas anyone won the Premier League on goal difference?\n\nOne club has won the Premier League title based on goal difference. In captivating fashion, Manchester City defeated crosstown rivals Manchester United during the 2011/2012 campaign on goal difference. The Citizens and the Red Devils both finished with 89 points but, thanks to their higher goal difference of 64 to United’s 56, Manchester City took home the glory. Making the achievement all the more dramatic, City were actually losing to Queens Park Rangers on the final day of the season, 2-1, as the game entered the 90th minute. Two goals in short order from Edin Dzeko, and, in the dying seconds of the game, Sergio Aguero, gave City the league title over their bitter rivals.\n\nRELATED: What are the Rule Changes for the Premier League in 2023/24?\n\nWhat happens if two teams have the same points and goal difference?\n\nIf two teams have the same point and goal difference, according to Premier League guidelines, positioning is determined by the total number of goals scored, followed by the club who’s earned the most points in the head-to-head matches. If an additional qualifier is needed to resolve positioning, it then comes down to which team scored the most away goals in the head-to-head matches.\n\nPhoto: Catherine Ivill/Getty Images\n\nHas any team gotten 100 points in the Premier League?\n\nOnly one club in Premier League history has ever accumulated 100 points, and that prestigious honor goes to Manchester City in 2017/2018. Under Pep Guardiola, the boys in sky blue reached the 100-point threshold thanks to a stoppage-time goal from Gabriel Jesus on the final day of the season against Southampton.\n\nPhoto: Charlotte Wilson/Getty Images\n\nHas any team gone undefeated in the Premier League?\n\nThroughout the existence of the English Premier League, there has only been one team to survive a campaign completely unscathed, and that’s Arsenal. After fully embracing manager Arsene Wenger’s scheme, the Gunners took the 2003/2004 season by storm as they cruised unbeaten to a title that year. In fact, they won 49 games in a row between May 2003 and October 2004.\n\nPhoto: Alex Livesey/Getty Images\n\nWhich team has won the most Premier League titles?\n\nWhile 51 teams, including this year’s addition of Luton Town, have played in England’s Premier League, astonishingly, there have only been seven different winners since the league began in 1992. The elite pool of victors includes Arsenal, Blackburn Rovers, Chelsea, Leicester City, Liverpool, Manchester City and Manchester United. From that list, the Red Devils maintain a strong advantage, with 13 titles to City’s nine."
