Now it’s gone back to opens and it shows the boys that are a little bit older can still play with the best.\n\n“It’s good to get back in there ... some more experienced players with a couple of young guys.”\n\nHe described it as a “buzz” and “honour” to wear the Newcastle uniform again, especially after being part of the successful country title campaign in 2016 but missing the final with suspension.\n\nSchillings’ club coach Matt Lantry endorsed the role as skipper saying “he’s a quiter leader but he talks, everybody listens”.\n\nKick-off is 7:30pm.\n\nPLANS: Centre of excellence a game-changer says Knights’ boss\n\nDAILY\n\nYour morning news\n\nToday's top stories curated by our news team.
