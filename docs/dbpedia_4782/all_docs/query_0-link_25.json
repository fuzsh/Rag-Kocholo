        "text": "Sunderland Star Suffers Setback https://ift.tt/wSZLnef Sunderland winger Jack Clarke has suffered an ankle ligament injury and is set to be out of action for up to six weeks, according to a statement on the club’s official website. Clarke sustained the injury during Sunderland’s recent 2-1 defeat against Birmingham City. The 23-year-old subsequently missed the Black Cats’ last match against Swansea City as a result. The winger will now undergo a period of rehabilitation and is anticipated back in training in April. How will this impact Sunderland? The absence of the tricky winger will undoubtedly be a significant one, with Clarke being Sunderland’s standout performer this season. With 15 goals and four assists so far, the former Leeds United man has been the centrepiece of Sunderland’s attack this season. Clarke is currently the club’s top scorer by 1o goals, with Jobe Bellingham second on five goals, and has 11 more goal contributions than Dan Neil who has eight. Using data from Fotmob, Clarke’s importance is clear to see. Apart from the obvious goal contributions, Clarke is evidently Sunderland’s most creative and effective player. The winger currently has an average of 0.46 goals per 90 and has the club’s highest average match rating, with an average of 7.84. He also boasts 11 big chances created and has created 30 more chances than anyone else at the club. Clarke has created 77 chances this season compared to Patrick Roberts who is the second most creative with 47. What games will Clarke miss? Assuming that Clarke is back in action in six weeks, he should be back for the clubs’ clash away at West Bromwich Albion on April 13th. So what games will the Black Cats play without their star man? Clarke will miss matches against; Norwich City (A), Leicester City (H), Southampton (A), Queens Park Rangers (H), Cardiff City (A), Blackburn Rovers (H), Bristol City (H) and Leeds United (A). While Clarke is unavailable, Sunderland have some challenging games. Mike Dodds’ men have to play three of the current top six, playing just once at home, as well as travelling to fellow play-off hopefuls Norwich City. Five of Sunderland’s next eight matches are against teams in the top half of the table and these games will no doubt be even more of a challenge without their most important attacking outlet. These next eight games will be a real test of character for Sunderland. Currently eight points off the play-offs, Sunderland will need a positive points return to make up ground on their competitors. Should the Black Cats manage to put a positive run together, they could put themselves in a very strong position for the return of their star winger and carry a lot of positive momentum into the run-in which could push them to a top-six finish for the second consecutive season. <p>The post Sunderland Star Suffers Setback first appeared on LSM Sports.</p> Tim Bell Read More At Look Sports Media\n\nMark Spry Heidi Haigh Paraag Marathe Andrea Radrizzani Mike Durham steve haussmann design Steve Lunn Mark Robinson Neil Doherty Liam Sheedy Liam Holton Des Gibson Neil Fullerton Darragh Maloney Daragh Ó Conchúir Jennifer Keeley Phil Merrick Debbie Fishman Sammie Mennell VAR has reached a new low-which is exactly what the FA wants. However, what they didn't want, was for their offices phone lines/emails to be crammed with anger and complaints re: the horror of yesterday as Coventry fought back from 3-0 down to have Man Utd reeling on ropes and then have a last second 4-3 winner chalked off. I've said this many times before and to referee Keith Hackett-the FA want this chaos/confusion and rid of VAR so as to go back to referees/linesmen decisions. There is a saying: '6 of one, half a dozen of other' or 'much of a muchness'. VAR or on field refs are EXACT SAME. Powers that be will always corrupt in favor of moneymen. World Rugby denied Scotland in last minute of Australia semi final so as to have dream final of NZ v Australia. Same here: RICH dream final of City v Utd as opposed to nobody watching NZ blitz Scots or City blitz Coventry . So VAR technicians will computer generate the 'line' to find the 'correct' offside. Lastly: 'how wide is their line'!!!! Same as Horse Racing - there IS no such thing in this digital/beam age of a 'dead heat'. Once again for the zillionth time....all to do with money. The ruination of money and power: if circumstance evidence is enough to convict in most serious crime worldwide, then its here for all to see. The Irish GAA were one of worst offenders calling hundreds of games as 'draws' so as to have lucrative replays. I was at all 4 games of the notorious Meath v Dublin saga. And that my friends was then followed by the Wicklow game which was also a draw!! By the way, they call me a 'conspiracy theorist'. Yea, right. Thats what the suits and ties 'brand' us.\n\n4 Morgan Whittaker replacements Plymouth Argyle should consider in the summer – Opinion https://ift.tt/nJNe62l Plymouth Argyle‘s Morgan Whittaker is expected to be a highly sought-after player, as the 23-year-old deadly inside forward has recorded a staggering 25 goal contributions already this season. The Greens have already had to fend off interest for the deadly in-form attacker, with rumoured interest from Italian giants Lazio and Premier League sides Brentford and West Ham to name a few. The potential sale for the Championship newcomers could yield huge financial rewards, having only acquired Whittaker for £1 million, at the start of the season, but replacing the player, regardless of money, will be a big challenge. Listed below, are some potential names Argyle could potentially look at, for replacing Whittaker. Plymouth Argyle’s Potential Targets Ruben Rodrigues – Oxford United Keen-eyed fans will perhaps point out that Rodrigues’ numbers this season dwarf those of Whittaker, it’s Rodrigues’ consistency and ability to adapt and flourish in stepping up the pyramid of English Football. This is the Portugueses’ first season in professional English football, having moved from Notts County last season. After three sensational years at Notts, which saw the talented winger record 54 goals in 139 games, Rodrigues made the jump up to League One and has since adapted well to the step up, netting seven times along with three assists. Similar, but not quite to the same extent as Whittaker, Rodrigues has a licence and confidence to shoot, averaging 1.78 shots per 90. Whilst Rodrigues wouldn’t perhaps immediately replace the goals that Arygle will crave, he will offer a real versatility, even more so than Whittaker, with the Portuguese attacker boasting the ability to play in a range of attacking positions. Kwame Poku – Peterborough United Peterborough have already sold one of their incredibly exciting wingers this season, to Coventry, as Ephron Mason-Clark joined the Sky Blues in January and for any Championship clubs that missed out, look no further than Kwame Poku. Ghanian winger, Poku, is on course for a sensational double-figure haul for both goals and assists this season in League One, as he continues to prove that he’s one of the best attackers in the league. If it’s the constant threat of goal, through the use of long-range efforts and quick feet to find deadly positions that Argyle desires to recreate from Whittaker, then Poku may very well be the man. A staggering 3.03 shots per 90 and 0.94 shots on target per 90 explains the threat of goal that Poku creates, ranking 20th out of 353 players for shots per 90. Of course, we need to take the step down in League into account, but Poku’s all-round game pips Whittaker, with a greater passing accuracy (81.8% compared to 74.3%) and a higher expected assists (4.99 compared to 4.31) Chris Conn-Clark – Altrincham A name that will be gathering plenty of attention, and for goo...\n\nThese Championship Players Are Ready For The Premier League – Opinion https://ift.tt/cZdLWAY The Championship season is nearing its conclusion and for the teams who miss out on the playoffs or automatic promotion, there will be a sense of anxiety as the Premier League’s PSR rules could lead to top-flight clubs looking for bargains in the second tier of English Football. Currently, the Championship is full of talent, highlighted by being the former home of several star players including Jude Bellingham and Viktor Gyokeres who have both gone on to excel further since leaving the second tier. Leicester, Leeds, Ipswich and Southampton’s players are excluded as two of the four teams will be automatically promoted in May ensuring that their star players are safe ahead of the 2024/25 campaign. Therefore, let’s take a look at the five players I have selected… Gabriel Sara The Canaries pulled off a coup in the summer of 2022 when signing Sara for a reported £11 million from Brazilian side Sao Paulo. The midfielder had been a regular with his former side and at just 23 at the time of the move, had plenty of room to realise his full potential. Fast forward to the current season and he has been involved in 30% of his side’s 76 goals from the middle of the pitch with 12 goals and 11 assists in league action thus far. The Brazilian is the key player in Norwich’s push to finish in a play-off place and has almost certainly proven he is ready to display his talent on a bigger stage. There are very few weaknesses in his game but it is in forward areas where he is at his most devastating. A player who is capable of playing in either of the six, eight or ten roles will be an attractive proposition for top-level sides that require versatility in the middle positions. Sammie Szmodics The Republic of Ireland international has EFL fans running out of superlatives to assess his goalscoring exploits. It is almost inevitable that he will collect the Golden Boot as top scorer and that is all the more impressive when you consider that Rovers sit five points off the bottom three at the time of writing. His 24 goals have him four clear of his nearest challenger. The 28-year-old has become the player he is today the hard way, proving his scoring credentials in League One and Two with Peterborough and Colchester respectively. Blackburn may be looking to cash in and if Szmodics can polish up areas of his all-round game he could be the kind of poacher that many Premier League sides are currently lacking. Jacob Greaves The defender’s inclusion in this list may come as a surprise but he deserves to be recognised off the back of his commanding displays at the heart of the Hull City defence. The 23-year-old has been an almost ever-present for the Tigers who have been a credit to the division for some of their play this season. Greaves has been commanding in the air, winning on average 4.2 aerial duels per game, leaving him third out of all Championship defenders...\n\nThe Long Euro Soccer-Football Weekend in Review: A Quick Recap By Antonio J. Soave June 17, 2024 Germany-Scotland The inimitable tournament began on Friday with an expected victory by host country, Germany. Germany’s dominance was obvious from the get-go, with Scotland not having much of a chance at any point throughout the match. Scotland simply did not have the firepower to match up with one of the world’s best teams. Netherlands vs. Poland The Holland match against Poland was a real test for the Dutch. I don’t think they expected the kind of fight that the Polish put forth. The Netherlands seemed stunned at times, not quite believing that a weaker Poland could create such a threat, especially without its international superstar, Robert Lewandowski, on the field. Out with an injury, Poland stepped forward with poise and confidence. Ultimately, Wout Weghorst came off the bench for the Dutch rescuing advancing goal. The Dutch striker, Weghorst, who has played with the English club Burnley, scored within minutes of replacing Cody Gakpo of Liverpool. Belgium-Slovakia The opening minutes of the Belgium-Slovakia game were brilliant, with a tremendous rush from Jeremy Doku and a near finish by Romelu Lukaku. Then came another near miss by the world-class Lukaku, where Slovakia’s goaltender managed to get a hand on it. And later in the first half, Lukaku sent another sure goal just wide of the net at about the 42 minute mark. But Slovakia was the real story behind the game. On a defensive breakdown by Belgium, Slovakia capitalized with a volley by Ivan Schranz. As the Fox television announcer stated: “They handed that goal on a plate to Slovakia.” That Slovakian tally came after just 6 minutes and 7 seconds. But with over 88 minutes left, we would have thought that DeBruyne, Lukaku and Doku would have been able to convert. It was not to be. This is the first time Euro competition history that a team such as Slovakia—which was ranked #48—beat a tournament favorite, Belgium, that was ranked #3. But there is one word of advice: Just stay on your feet, fellows. Don’t dive, don’t embellish. It even happened with the great DeBruyne, who should be above that sort of behavior. Then there was the mistake by Slovakian goalkeeper Dubravka, which could have –and could have—resulted in a Belgian conversion by Leandro Trossard. What if … Well, that did not happen either, and Belgium was held to zero. This is a demonstration, though, that there is no substitute for hard work, persistence, and resolve. Now, make no mistake: Belgium was probably the better team on an individual basis. But the modern game is not just about possession; it is about conversion—it’s about scoring goals. It’s also about excellent defending and aggressive play ...
