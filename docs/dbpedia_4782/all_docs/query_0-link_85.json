        "text": "William V. Cross\n\nCaptain, George Patton’s 3rd Army, WWII\n\nBusiness Executive\n\nROCKPORT — After a long and wonderful 101 years of life, William V. Cross, being a true patriot, poetically passed on July 4th at his home on Beauchamp Point in Rockport. A life filled with the love of his life, Lois Jane, innumerable warm and meaningful friendships, numerous professional accomplishments, and a significant impact on the lives of others including his large family who loved and adored him as he did them.\n\nBill was born in Memphis, Tennessee, September 1, 1922 to Irma Lorena and Early Thomas Cross. His family was relocated several times with Armco, but spent most of their time in Middletown, Ohio. After high school he attended Purdue University where, in his sophomore year, he was swept off the dance floor by Lois Jane Vaughn at a Delta Upsilon mixer. In his charming way, he won her heart even though she was pinned to another fellow. The two were married on June 24, 1944 at the Alpha Chi House the day before Lois Jane’s graduation, and 4 months later he left for overseas.\n\nBill enlisted in the Army on December 8, 1941, the day after Pearl Harbor, and attended basic training while in college. He was commissioned in Armor in 1944, and was assigned to the 65th Infantry Division where he was appointed Company Commander at the age of 22. The 65th fought through France, Germany and Austria where they met up with the allied Russian forces. His unit liberated Mauthausen, one of the notorious Nazi concentration camps in Austria. Bill received two Purple Hearts, a Bronze Star for heroic service, a Good Conduct Medal, and returned home in 1946 as a Captain.\n\nIn 1947, Bill joined Nalco Chemical Co as an industrial engineer. After 37 years, he retired as the Executive Vice President of Sales in 1984. For the next ten years he was a consultant to the Pulp and Paper industry setting up co-generation operations.\n\nWhile visiting his former manager in Camden in 1972, Bill and Lois Jane knew immediately this was the place they wanted to live, and bought a home that very weekend in Rockport. The following year they became members of the Megunticook Golf Club. In 1977 they purchased Nimaha, the home of their dreams on Beauchamp Point. Their house was always filled with family, friends, parties, music, dancing and laughter.\n\nLocally, Bill and five friends founded the Camden Conference in 1987… it’s basic mission to “foster informed discourse on world issues”. To date, over 500 speakers from 6 continents have participated.\n\nHe was involved with the Camden Rockport Historical Society, the Mary Cramer Museum, and the Lime Kiln Restoration Project. As a long-time member, he was instrumental in merging the Rockport and Camden Methodist churches into their current John Street location. In 2019, he was Volunteer of the Year at the Penobscot Bay YMCA…an organization that was very dear to him. For years he organized activities every weekday morning at Quarry Hill. Additionally, Bill established scholarships at UMaine, NC State, Miami of Ohio, and the University of Washington for Pulp and Paper Tech majors.\n\nOne of Bill’s greatest joys was being a member of the Megunticook Golf Club for over 50 years. There he served as President and served on many committees and boards. Often, he could be found on the courts playing a competitive game of tennis or swinging away on the golf course.\n\nIt can’t be denied that Bill had the biggest, most loving heart, was welcoming to all, and was admired by all generations. He had a twinkle in his eye when he smiled at you, and he never forgot a name, phone number or birthday. He looked mighty fine driving his ‘68 Firebird convertible, took daily walks for miles where he knew every dog along his route, and most of all, he really, really loved to cut up the dance floor. He was a prankster, a true patriot who loved this country, a strong believer in God, an epic phone-talker, a scotch drinker and the king of growing the most colorful dahlias. And finally, he was SO SO very thankful for those close friends who took him under their wings the last few years.\n\nBill was predeceased by his wife of 68 years, Lois Jane Vaughn Cross, and one grandchild.\n\nHe is survived by his children, Bill and wife Cory of Silverton, Oregon, Tom and wife Debbie of Westminster, Colorado, Bob and wife Fedelia of Oglala, South Dakota, Cindy and husband David Alvin of Wellesley, Massachusetts; 14 grandchildren, 17 great grandchildren, and 3 great great-grandchildren.\n\nAs one can see, Bill/Billy-Boy/Chip/Dad/Pop/Pops truly led a life filled with endless love and gratitude for all his blessings. He will be so deeply missed, but we know he is joyfully on the dance floor in the arms of his beloved Lois Jane. Thank you for all you taught us and for always reminding us that anything is possible if you put mind to it and T-H-I-N-K. May your glowing legacy live on forever.\n\n“Love you so much”.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, we welcome a donation in his memory to the Penobscot Bay YMCA, PO Box 840, Rockport, ME 04856.\n\nA Celebration of Life will be held in his honor."
