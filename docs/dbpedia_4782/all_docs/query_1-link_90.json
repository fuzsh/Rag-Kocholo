        "text": "I'm back from my little trip to Melbourne. Below is a bit of a write up on it. Whether you're a Novocastrian or not or just inexperienced at any travel by plane as I am currently then take whatever info from my experience here that may help you in your own Rugby travels.\n\nDISCLAIMER: I am at times taking the piss here so please try to engage your sense of humour when reading the following.\n\n\"A Country Hicks' Short Trip to Melbourne\"\n\nDetails\n\nPackage: Sorted thru Flightcentre, no probs with these guys.\n\nGame tickets: Ticketek, seated high but not right up the top, nice view of the whole ground but I would have liked to have been closer\n\nFlights: In & out with Virgin Blue, Newcastle to Melbourne airport then back. Virgin were very good. Oh yeah & they have a sign up near checking in that says something like \"Don't joke about having bombs in your bag\". Good thing I saw that because I was going to make a similar joke - quite possibly avoided a Nate Myles/Anasta-type situation there.\n\nTransport from & back to MEL Airport: Sunbus service. NOTE: Nothing wrong with these guys but I may use the SkyBus next time that was right outside the terminal exit (T3) & have buses every 10min that go into the city, probably a cheaper option. http://www.skybus.com.au/\n\nStayed at: Mantra on Jolimont. http://www.mantra.com.au/victoria/m...urne/accommodation/hotels/mantra-on-jolimont/\n\nNo frills. Basics with a few extras. Close to the MCG & the other grounds like AAMI. $79 per night per head was the rate at the time I stayed. Apparently there is a bit of train noise (I had been told) but given that I collapsed on the bed intoxicated after trying to erase the memories of the Crusaders performance earlier that night I don't think I heard any (really went against my diet with my alcohol consumption the other night). Had a Zac Guildford nightmare too, not him on a bike nude drunk chasing me but rather that bomb he did in his own 22m that went almost straight up & down (\"Why Zac!!! Why!!!!\"). Mantra has a bar, cafe/restaurant, & a few other perks - their breakfasts were very good, no pancakes though. May experience a few other places but I would use this place again if need be.\n\nGame: Rebels v Crusaders at AAMI Park\n\nSet out on Sat morning, Sat game at 7:30pm, home Sun afternoon\n\nGeneral Pros of trip\n\nCrusaders: It has been years since I've been at a ground to watch the Saders play live & despite them losing I still enjoyed actually getting to see them.\n\nThe Staff at AAMI Park: Quite literally everyone I encountered was very kind & helpful.\n\nFood & Drink at AAMI Park: In addition to regular footy grub AAMI Park has a few different burgers, chicken or fish on top of chips, hotdogs, dim sims, & few other things that I can't remember off the top of my head. Carlton mid str & Bulmers was on tap, they have a number of pre-mix drinks - all in all a good collection. The higher alcohol content options became very handy as the game went on.......\n\nThe Crowd: Tame! Compared to what I'm used to. Incredibly well behaved so from a family perspective I think it gets plenty of points. Just over 18000.\n\nPre-Game Games/Viewing: I enjoyed watching MGS v Scotch & the Women's sevens Emeralds v Flames. The kiwi welcoming I thought was a nice touch for kiwi fans. The introduction of each Rebel player on the big screen showing the charities each player was involved in was good also, I didn't know that each Rebel player had a charity.\n\nMerchandise: They look like they have a very comprehensive Rebel merch store (for anyone in the Hunter or elsewhere that's a Rebels fan). Maybe online would be cheaper? (seems to to be that way with most supporter merch). My Ma asked me \"Do they have Crusader gear?\". I can't believe she was serious.\n\nGeneral Cons of the Trip\n\nCrusaders: They were both a plus & a minus. The negative was how they played but don't worry boys, to quote Whitney Houston \"I will always love you\".\n\nTime: Really felt rushed. Ideally should have gone down Friday & given myself a bit more time. Or perhaps being inexperienced it just added to the stress & with experience I may get used to it.\n\nMy right ear: 15min away from landing I just couldn't pop it. I was deaf a few hours after landing.\n\nOdds n' Ends\n\nAAMI Park, stadium/atmosphere, etc: AAMI park looked good outside & in, it echoed, we had good cover from rain, & felt like the stadium went up real narrow. All-in-all good but I think I feel more at home at old or traditional styled grounds, in particular the 'ground with grass hills' type of ground. Pretty much just personal pref though.\n\nMelbourne itself: I was only there for the game but I got a ride around Melbourne before hand. To my eyes Melbourne really just looks & feels like Sydney but add trams, slightly more overcast weather, & loads of AFL shite. And with that I've just offended every Sydneyite & Melbournian saying each is pretty much like the other - nicely done ASH .\n\nOverall: Highly recommend. I really want to watch an international Rugby match there at some point.\n\nLASTLY, HAPPY MOTHERS DAY TO ALL THE MUMS OUT THERE!!!\n\nPremier one mens GF replay won by Hamilton 40-23 against Merewether-Carlton.\n\nMy boys lost a tight one 31-30 against Maitland Blacks at the Blacks home ground - heartbreaking!\n\nWomens have Wanderers v Uni postponed till next week, weeknight game I believe. Yet to hear result of the other game.\n\nRest of this round results found below:\n\nhttp://myrugby.rugby.com.au/myrugby/competitions/competitions.asp?orgid=013700\n\nBIG NEWS out of this round is that Merewether-Carlton will be stripped of the points they got against my guys last round because their gun player Wade (who had come back from the Knights) was unregistered!\n\n(just taking a quick mo to report that whilst watching the Super Rugby! Saders winning - I'm in a good mood so far this evening )\n\nIn addition there was a real bit of fire in the recent two weeks of the Rugby News. There is a bloke that calls himself the Green Hornet & ran a blog called the Hornets nest. I don't believe he runs it anymore but he was given the opportunity to put in a column in the Rugby News book to add a bit of humour. He most certainly went a bit too far in the edition below (go to page 18).\n\nhttp://www.portprint.com.au/rugbynews2012/RugbyNews_Issue5/pageflip.html\n\nThe response from the president of Lake Mac was in this weeks Rugby News here (go to page 33). There is also a small paragraph on it earlier in the book.\n\nhttp://www.portprint.com.au/rugbynews2012/RugbyNews_Issue6/\n\nMy view is that yes Lake Mac \"Disneyland\" is not always the nicest ground to play at. Many players joke that its \"Dettol baths immediately\" after any games there. However, they are a very good club at allowing others to use their grounds for Rugby, regular season & other comps. Our relocated game against Hamilton in the women's would not have gone ahead had it not been for the generosity of Lake Mac Rugby Club. I have to say I agree with the sentiment of the Lake Mac president in his letter. I think what makes it worse is that the Green Hornet is a supporter of Merewether-Carlton, a rich club - by comparison to most clubs in the comp. The whole segment of the Green Hornet smacked of \"looking down ones nose at those less fortunate\", he may of had good intentions of trying to raise issues in regards to Lake Mac's facilities but IMO did it in a very tasteless way. The only positive is it had added some real spice to the weekly newsletter which is pretty good quality as it is.\n\nI don't think the Hornet should stop writing his bit but he does need to pull his head in a bit.\n\nThis weeks Rugby News from Newcastle, featuring Robbie Deans on the cover.\n\nPage 24 (continues page 27) is dedicated to my club Newcastle Uni's reunion of our premiership sides from the winning sides of 1961 & 1962 on Sat 2nd June & 3rd of June. The 1962 team was undefeated. Uni was coached by Wallaby Ron Harvey & captained by Brian O'Shea who now has an consultant role to the IRB. The teams of that time were charactised by speed at the breakdown & magnificant long range tries. An old boy was telling me not too long ago Uni's game has been traditionally built around out pacing the oppo. Former Uni players are coming together from all over the country for the reunion.\n\nDo read the rest of the article, it is quite in depth.\n\nhttp://www.portprint.com.au/rugbynewsissue7/\n\nSpecial mention to the Stuart Trench memorial day this Saturday at Lynn Oval Stockton (which is mentioned in the Rugby news link). Lynn Oval is the old stomping ground of the Stockton Schooners Rugby club from my home suburb. I would go if only I wasn't in Tamworth playing rep! I did not know Stuart personally - bit before my time in Rugby, but he had contributed a lot to Rugby in the Stockton area I believe. Griffins Rugby was what evolved out of the Stockton Rugby club & other Port area teams - they are now based in Mayfield, Dangar Park, where May East were before being booted out of the premier comp.\n\nThe Rugby situation for Stockton kids & adults (like myself) is that we must play for \"over town\" clubs due to none locally (Stockton is a bit isolated, here is a link to see for yourself link http://maps.google.com.au/maps?hl=en&psj=1&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.,cf.osb&biw=1280&bih=685&q=Stockton NSW&um=1&ie=UTF-8&hq=&hnear=0x6b7314a0ef845961:0x5017d681632f4d0,Stockton NSW&gl=au&ei=MzC-T8a5Ea-wiQfgtLnEDw&sa=X&oi=geocode_result&ct=image&resnum=1&ved=0CBMQ8gEwAA).\n\nDespite having no club there are a number of Stocktonians I know playing Rugby across the comp play & I'm sure they are doing it with typical \"Stocko aggro\" & are proud of it. I know a number of Stocktonians & former Schooner players in the current comp that referee, coaches, & support the comp.\n\nThe memorial day will be Griffins v Cooks Hill. Not absolute, but in general, this is a real battle of the working class v the high end, lol. Cooks Hill is nicknamed by my mates as \"Trendy town\" , it contains the excellent dining street called Darby St.\n\nCooks Hill Brown Snakes have a very interesting (to put it one way) team song, one particular part of the lyrics is \"Put it in the wrong hole we are the brown snakes\" make of that what you will\n\nGo Griffins!"
