I think the game was locked up when I went on and we broke it open a bit.\"\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\nJarom Haines in action for the Kurri Kurri Bulldogs.\n\nThe 22-year-old is in his second full season with the Kurri Kurri Bulldogs in the Newcastle Rugby League competition after starting off with the Western Suburbs Rosellas when he made the move from Moree.\n\nThroughout his playing days, he's spent some time at halfback and fullback, but his preferred position is in the number six jersey.\n\n\"I prefer to play a five-eighth role because it's a combination of both positions,\" Haines said.\n\nHe will now prepare for a few training sessions with the squad in the week leading up to the game against the Rangers.\n\n\"Last year they did just one beforehand, and they got touched up a bit. They're taking a different approach,\" Haines said.\n\nThere will be a training session held on the Central Coast before the Newcastle players will travel down to Sydney for another training and bonding session.\n\nThe squad flies up to Brisbane on Friday, June 28, will train together on Saturday before the game on Sunday.\n\n\"I'm excited, really. I'm going to grab it with both hands, make the most of it,\" Haines said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAd\n\nGet the latest Moree news in your inbox\n\nSign up for our newsletter to stay up to date.\n\nEmail address\n\nWe care about the protection of your data.
