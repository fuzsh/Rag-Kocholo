        "text": "Transcript\n\nA printed pamphlet which is offers an announcement from Charles to the people of Scotland, May 1639, Catalogue ref: SP 45/10/225\n\nBy the King\n\nCharles by the grace of God, King of ENGLAND, SCOTLAND, FRANCE and IRELAND, Defender of the Faith, &c.\n\nTo all our loving Subjects whom it shall or may concern, greeting. Whereas we are thus farre advanced in Our Royall Person with Our Armie, and the attendance of Our Nobilitie and Gentry of this Kingdome, and intend to be mostly at Our good town of Barwicke, with purpose to give Our good people of Scotland all just satisfaction in Parliament, assoone as the present disorders, and tumultuous proceedings of some there are quieted; and will leave Us a fair way of comming like a gratious King to declare Our good meaning to them. But finding some cause of Impediment, and that this Nation doth apprehend (that contrarie to their professions) there is an intention to invade this Our Kingdom of England. We doe therefore to cleare all doubts, that may breed scruples in the mindes of Our good Subjects of either Kingdome, reiterate this Our just and reall Protestation: That if all civill and temporall obedience be effectually and timely given and shewn unto Us, we doe not intend to invade them with any hostility. But if they shall without Our special Authoritie and Command raise any armed Troups, and draw them downe within ten miles of Our Border of England we shall then interpret that as an Invasion of Our said Kingdome of England, and in that case doe expressly command the Generall of Our Army, and Our Superior Officers of the same, respectively to proceede against them as Rebells, and Invaders of this Kingdome of England, and to the utmost of their power to set upon them and destroy them, In which they shall doe a singular service, both to our honour and safety.\n\nGiven at Our Court at Newcastle the fourteenth day of May, in the fifteenth yeer of Our reign.\n\nGod save the King.\n\nSimplified transcript\n\nAn announcement from Charles to the people of Scotland, May 1639 (Catalogue ref: SP 45/10/225)\n\nBy the King\n\nCharles, by the grace of God, King of England, Scotland, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith etc.\n\nTo all our loving subjects, greetings. We have advanced with our army and our nobles and gentry of this kingdom. We intend to be mostly at Berwick, to give our good people of Scotland all justice in Parliament, as soon as the present disorderly actions of some there are quieted. We will come like a gracious King to declare our good will to them. But we find there is a barrier. This nation knows (unlike their claims) there is an intention to invade England. So to clear all doubts, that may breed worries in your minds, we repeat our just and real demand. If all civil obedience is effectively and quickly given to us, we do not intend to invade with any hostility. But if they raise any armed troops without our authority, and bring them down to within ten miles of the border of England, we shall then interpret that as an invasion of our kingdom. In that case, we command the general and senior officers of our army to proceed against them as rebels and invaders of England, and to the utmost of their power to set upon them and destroy them. In this they shall do a great service to both our honour and safety.\n\nGiven at our court at Newcastle, the 14th day of May, in the 15th year of our reign.\n\nGod save the King."
