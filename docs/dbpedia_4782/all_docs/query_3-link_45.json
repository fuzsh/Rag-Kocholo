        "text": "Before the Battle\n\nFrancis Lord Rawdon, second Earl of Moira and later Marquis of Hastings, was born into an Anglo-Irish family in Moira, County Down, Ireland in 1754. His father, John Rawdon, was the first Earl of Moira and served as a peer in the Irish parliament. Rawdon received his education at Harrow, England, and embarked on his military career at age fifteen. With assistance from his uncle, Lord Huntingdon, Rawdon secured a commission as an ensign in the Fifteenth Regiment of Foot in August 1771. Although he gained admittance at Oxford University that year, Rawdon terminated his studies and settled on purchasing a commission as a lieutenant in the Fifth Regiment of Foot in 1773. The following July, Rawdon arrived in Boston.[1]\n\nRawdon quickly formed a contemptible view of Britain's North American colonists. A man looking for action and hoping to make a name for himself, Rawdon did not care about the politics of the colonies. Moreover, he perceived the colonists as unworthy opponents on the battlefield. Similar to many other British officers in 1775, Rawdon viewed them as inferior. In his own writing, he dismissed the colonists as \"scoundrels\" and stated that he desired a \"more reputable enemy;\" to fight.[2] Rawdon did not participate in the events at Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775. After another lieutenant suffered wounds that day, Rawdon was transferred in his place to the grenadier company and served under Captain George Harris.[3]\n\nThe Battle of Bunker Hill\n\nRawdon experienced his first fighting two months later during the Battle of Bunker Hill. On June 17, he took part in storming the colonists' redoubt on Breed's Hill. General John Burgoyne recognized Rawdon's courage and leadership that day in correspondence to English government officials later in the month. Burgoyne wrote: \"Lord Rawdon has this day stamped his fame for life.\" Thus, Rawdon's heroism secured a lasting military reputation.[4] The colonists' galling musket fire decimated the British infantry's assault twice, and Rawdon later wrote of the attack in a letter to his uncle Lord Huntingdon:\n\nOur men at last grew impatient, and all crying out, 'Push on! Push on!' advanced with infinite spirit to attack the works with their small arms. As soon as the rebels perceived this, they rose up and poured in so heavy a fire upon us that the oldest officers say they never saw a sharper action. They kept up the fire till we were within ten yards of them; nay, they even knocked down my captain, close by side me, after we got into the ditch of the entrenchment.[5]\n\nRawdon exemplified bravery and decisiveness that afternoon. During the last attack Rawdon's company commander, Captain George Harris twice tried to enter the redoubt.[6] During his second attempt, a musket ball grazed Harris' head and he toppled into the arms of Rawdon who saved him from being trampled by the grenadiers. Rawdon ordered four soldiers to take Harris back to the beach, but on exposing themselves from the ditch, colonists hit three of the four. Rawdon took command of the remaining troops and charged the wall of the redoubt where he successfully breached the position.[7] Rawdon's action compelled General Burgoyne to write to Lord Stanley, \"Lord Rawdon behaved to a charm; his name is established for life.\"[8] Besides a musket ball piercing his cap, Rawdon miraculously came through the battle unscathed. He eagerly wrote his uncle, \"I was everywhere in the thickest of the fire and flatter myself that I behaved as you could wish.\"[9]\n\nRawdon's perception of the colonists' fighting ability morphed during the battle. In addition to proving their tenacity, the colonists inflicted heavy casualties on British forces. Rawdon himself witnessed their slow, reluctant retreat from the rail fence. As he described to his uncle: \"The rebels were obliged to abandon their post, but continued a running fight from one fence, or wall, to another, till we entirely drove them off . . .\" After the battle, Rawdon remarked that the loss of officers and rank and file were \"very great.\" For example, only eleven Grenadiers remained in his company. At the same time, Rawdon exaggerated the number of colonists whom they fought, claiming it was 6,000.[10] It is estimated that between 1,400 and 1,800 colonial forces engaged directly in the day's battle.[11]\n\nFootnotes\n\n[1] Paul David Nelson, Francis Rawdon-Hastings, Marquess of Hastings Soldier, Peer of the Realm, Governor-General of India (Teaneck, N.J.: Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 2005), 20-24.\n\n[2] Richard M.
