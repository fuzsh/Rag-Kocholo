Quite simply, an industry icon.A\n\nlso appearing on Friday night are the UK’s finest disco collective, Horse Meat Disco.The four-strong DJ collective of Jim Stanton, James Hillard, Luke Howard and Severino Panzetta have become a mainstay of leading festival stages and with monthly residencies in London, New York, Berlin and Lisbon they have established themselves as one of the world’s most successful disco club brands.\n\nBehind this exciting new project are John Dance, Marty Smith and Rob Seaman. With over 30 years experience in the music industry Marty has key local knowledge in the North East’s nightlife scene, working at some of the region’s most famous venues.\n\nRob has worked in the Balearic Islands since the early 90s. During his time there he was Director of the world famous Café Mambo where he was instrumental in bringing BBC Radio 1’s weekly broadcasts to the venue. He also worked with Pete Tong on his Wonderland nights and the Swedish House Mafia during their inaugural year at Pacha.\n\nHe then moved to Mallorca, working as VIP Director for Ibiza Rocks before launching the groundbreaking youth concept hotel BH Mallorca with its 7,000 capacity live events venue and festival level production.Rob brings with him an incredible wealth of experience, expertise and a network of talent that would be hard to match.\n\nSays Rob: ‘Our aim is to build on the excellent reputation Newcastle already has and raise its profile still further. We are booking international artists from different genres and can mix up the styles on the same night in the different rooms. We will have something to offer everyone at The Lofts and look forward to welcoming music fans not just from the local area but from throughout the UK’."
