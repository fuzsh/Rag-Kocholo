        "text": "15 musicians and the football clubs they support\n\nMusic and football have a lot in common than most people think. The greatest players who have graced the game have compared the beautiful game to the art form of music in various ways through the years. As Ronaldinho recently wrote in The Playerâs Tribune in his article âLetter To My Younger Selfâ: âWhen you have a football at your feet, you are free. You are happy. Itâs almost like you are hearing music. That feeling will make you want to spread joy to others.â\n\nWhile Zinedine Zidane heralded the intertwining of music and football in his life growing up in a poor suburb of Marseille in France. In his interview with The Guardian in 2004, he said: âI was lucky to come from a difficult area. It teaches you not just about football but also life. There were lots of kids from different races and poor families. People had to struggle to get through the day. Music was important. Football was the easy part.â\n\nFootball and music transcend the mind and reach the soul. Whether itâs your favourite team scoring a great goal or defending one, or a piece of melody and lyric that touches you, these little moments are the culmination of creative and hard-working minds reaching out through technology to make you feel joyous.\n\nNot surprisingly a lot of the musicians both current and from the past have supported football teams. With the Grammy Awards coming up, we decided to put the record straight about musicians and the clubs they support. This list consists of the musicians who have supported and currently support their favourite football teams.\n\n#14 Richard Ashcroft (The Verve) â Manchester United\n\nRichard Ashcroft of The Verve in the Old Trafford dressing room\n\nRichard Ashcroft is one of the great lyricists and singer/songwriters of our generation. Although he was born in Wigan, the lead singer of the 90's band âThe Verveâ is a huge Manchester United fan. The Verve were together responsible for a number of hit albums and songs, the most famous of which were â âBittersweet Symphonyâ, âThe Drugs Donât Workâ and âLucky Manâ.\n\nHe has since focused on a solo career releasing a number of solo albums. Songs like âOn A Beachâ and âYou On My Mind In My Sleepâ, from his solo work are stand-outs. He was reportedly at the Nou Camp for THAT 1999 Championâs League Final against Bayern Munich.\n\nHe was also pictured in a video with a No.11 Manchester United jersey with his last name at the back.\n\nAshcroft hasnât got as much recognition outside the UK, despite his obvious talent and genius. However, just to show you how well respected he is in the music community, Oasis brothers Noel and Liam dubbed him âCaptain Rockâ and even dedicated a song called âCast No Shadowâ to him.\n\nHe did, however, don the clubâs jersey in a celebrity charity game between Manchester United and Celtic. The musical genius is a proper Red Devil.\n\n#13 Ed Sheeran - Chelsea\n\nEd Sheeran at Stamford Bridge with Christine Bleakley and Frank Lampard Sr.\n\nItâs safe to say Ed Sheeran is pretty popular these days. The English Pop/Folk singer is well known for his hit songs like âI See Fireâ, âThe A Teamâ and âThinking Out Loudâ. While just this year he released two singles from an upcoming album called âDivideâ which instantly became hits. The English singer, who is of Irish descent, is a Chelsea fan, according to this tweet a few years ago.\n\nHowever, he does state that his heart will forever be with Framlingham town FC!\n\n#12 Drake - Manchester United/Chelsea\n\nDrake poses with Manchester Unitedâs Rio Ferdinand\n\nHip-hop sensation Drake is one of the biggest stars of the genre currently. His hits since his first album with the song âBest I Ever Hadâ to the song âStarted From The Bottomâ, right upto âHotline Blingâ on his recent album âViewsâ which released last year â have all cemented Drake as one of the biggest hip-hop artists on the planet.\n\nWhen it comes to supporting football clubs though, it was thought that he was a Manchester United fan after this picture with former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand. But since then his loyalties have been questioned by a lot of fans, after he was pictured in a number of different clubâs jerseys.\n\nHere he is pictured with Chelsea legends, Ashley Cole and John Terry\n\n#11 Iron Maiden - West Ham United\n\nIron Maiden Steve Harris playing in a charity game\n\nThe in-your-face British heavy-metal band Iron Maiden are from Leyton(East London) and theyâre all West Ham fans. Steve Harris, the bandâs founder was actually scouted by a scout named Wally St Pier and was asked to play for West Ham Unitedâs youth team.\n\nHowever, Harrisâ interest in Rock and Roll made him switch careers and concentrate on music rather than pursue football. But even after the band Iron Maiden achieved worldwide success, Harris and his band mates remained loyal West Ham supporters.\n\nThe catch-phrase âUp The Ironsâ used by Iron Maiden at concerts and on a lot of t-shirts and merchandise is actually a paraphrase of the slogan âUp The Hammersâ which is used by West Ham Supporters. Harris even has the club crest engraved on his guitar.\n\nTheyâre proper Hammers fans and they even have close ties with the club. Harris personally knows Slaven Bilic, the previous West Ham boss, and even invited him to play with the band on stage. Believe it or not, Bilic is a metal-head, an Iron Maiden fan and has a side-project band.\n\n\"I have known Bilic for a number of years now,\" said Harris to a newspaper reporter. \"The first time I met him was when he played for West Ham - my son, George, was the mascot when we met at the game and we have stayed in contact.â\n\n\"We saw each other over Christmas and chatted - I know he is one of our big fans.\"\n\n\"Bilic is really a great guy and is doing a fantastic job at West Ham. With regards to being a guest at a concert, I'm not sure if he will - but if he can make it, we will see... he is a sought-after man and he has to do his job first,\" Harris added.\n\nFootball and music fans everywhere are waiting for this to happen! Now we know why West Ham play such tough football.\n\n#10 Lana Del Rey - Liverpool\n\nLana Del Rey pictured with Liverpool legend Steven Gerrard at Anfield\n\nLana Del Rey, whose real name is Elizabeth Woolridge Grant, is a singer from New York City who has quickly risen to fame after becoming a YouTube sensation and signing a record deal in 2011. She has since produced hits like âYoung and Beautifulâ â which was used in the movie âThe Great Gatsbyâ and also the heavily remixed song âSummertime Sadnessâ.\n\nLana Del Rey at Anfield\n\nLana Del Rey is reportedly a Liverpool fan she was quoted in NME Magazine saying, âI was introduced to Liverpool FC by my manager, Ben, whose mood is dependent on the Liverpool results [and] I love watching Luis SuÃ¡rez play.â\n\nAlthough Luis Suarez has moved on to Barcelona, itâs great for Liverpool fans to know that this talented signer with a heavenly voice is one of the voices among the Kop. Maybe a bit of her âSummertime Sadnessâ was because Suarez left Liverpool that summer, you never know.\n\n#9 Adele â Tottenham Hotspur\n\nAdele used the Spurs scarf at one of her concerts.\n\nAdele is a British icon and an incredible singer. Everything she touches turns to gold. Her voice and her music have earned her one of the biggest fan bases in the world and she continues to re-invent herself with each album. Her album â21â with hits like â âSomeone Like Youâ, âRolling In The Deepâ and âSet Fire To The Rainâ all became number 1âs worldwide and that album holds the record for âThe most sold album of the 21st centuryâ and âThe fourth highest sold album of all timeâ in the UK.\n\nAdele was born and raised in Tottenham itself so itâs no surprise that she is a Spurs fan. She has been pictured at White Hart Lane a few times including this game where Spurs lost to Chelsea 5-1 in the FA Cup.\n\n#8 Alex Turner (Arctic Monkeys) â Sheffield Wednesday\n\nAlex Turner of the Arctic Monkeys with Sheffield Wednesday players\n\nAlex Turner, Jamie Cook, Matt Helders and Nick OâMalley are the Arctic Monkeys. Theyâre one of the biggest bands in Britain and they were all born and raised in High Green, a suburb of Sheffield. The four band members all support their childhood team Sheffield Wednesday. Bassist Nick OâMalley even vaguely recalls seeing the infamous Hillsborough disaster which killed 96 Liverpool fans in 1989 at the Owlsâ ground.\n\nThe lads from Sheffield have visited Hillsborough stadium on numerous occasions to support their team. The Arctic Monkeys have even put the clubâs crest on their tour gear. While Alex Turner even has customised Chris Waddle (a Sheffield Wednesday legend) guitar picks. Itâs safe to say that theyâre die-hard fans of the Owls and support them dearly.\n\n#7 Thom Yorke and Ed O'Brien (Radiohead) â Manchester United\n\nRadiohead are a British band who have sold over 30 million records\n\nRadiohead are one of the greatest bands in the world who are still together after their formation in Oxfordshire in 1985. After numerous successful albums through the years and releasing their ninth album, called âA Moon Shaped Poolâ, last year in May 2016, Radiohead have established themselves as one of the most revered bands today.\n\nThey are â Thom Yorke, Jonny Greenwood, Ed OâBrien, Colin Greenwood and Philip Selway. Everything they make is different, brilliant, mesmerising and they are undoubtedly the ultimate alternative rock band.\n\nWhen it comes to football, it is believed that their front-man Thom Yorke supports Manchester United. Itâs strange though because United pretty much represent a lot of what Thom rebels against in his music. A number of sources online say he is a United fan, but there is no photographic evidence to suggest so.\n\nEd OâBrien, however is a big Manchester United fan and has confirmed the same in numerous interviews. In one of them, he says, âIâm also a big soccer fan â Manchester United â so I check out the MU sites, and there are a lot.â\n\nOâBrien studied Economics at the Manchester University, so it probably could be the reason why he supports the Red Devils.\n\n#6 Robert Plant (Led Zeppelin) â Wolverhampton Wanderers\n\nPlant was appointed vice-president of Wolves in 2009\n\nLed Zeppelin is one of the most illustrious Classic Rock bands to have ever existed. All the Led Zeppelin albums have been certified as âPlatinumâ with seven of their nine studio albums reaching number 1 on the UK charts. Led Zeppelin consisted of â Robert Plant, Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones and John Bonham. Their lead singer Robert Plant is widely regarded as one of the greatest singers in the history of Rock music.\n\nHe is a massive Wolves fan and has supported Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. for the last 55 years. He was announced as the clubâs vice president in 2009, after which he was quoted saying, \"First of all, I'm flattered, but I'm embarrassed to be honest. There are so many other people who are so important and relevant to the club, especially the people I sit next to at Molineux in the Steve Bull Stand.â\n\n\"They've seen so many more games than me and they're able to keep a closer eye on what's going on.\"\n\nIt is also believed that the wolf on the cover of his solo album, 'Now and Zen,' is a tribute to his boyhood club, Wolverhampton Wanderers.\n\nRobert Plant surely has âA Whole Lotta Love' for his childhood favourites Wolves and was even pictured with that particular song name on the back of his jersey at a charity game for the club. Itâs no wonder Wolves are always rocking from the stands.\n\n#5 Roger Waters and David Gilmour (Pink Floyd) â Arsenal\n\nPink Floyd playing football!\n\nâFour-star caviar daydream/ Think Iâll buy me a football teamâ, wrote Roger Waters on the song âMoneyâ by Pink Floyd. We donât really know whether he was being serious or sarcastic, but one thing is for certain that Roger Waters and David Gilmour are both Arsenal fans.\n\nUnless youâve been living under a rock, you would have and should have heard of Pink Floyd â one of the pioneers of psychedelic rock music. Roger Waters, David Gilmour, Richard Wright and Nick Mason are the four geniuses that made up the band before they separated. Their album âDark Side Of The Moonâ, alone sold more than 250 million copies worldwide and remains the bandâs hallmark album.\n\nDavid Gilmour was quoted in an interview saying that he was a season-ticket holder at Highbury, âI did have season tickets at the Arsenal for quite a few years. That was around the time they won the double. I'm sort of a really fickle football fan. I watch any team that's doing well and become unfaithful when they're not. But I do have a soft spot for Arsenal.â\n\nAlthough the song, âThe Gunnersâ Dreamâ on âThe Final Cutâ was about WWII and the IRA attacks in the UK in 1982, the title was apparently aptly decided by the two Arsenal fans Waters and Gilmour, to serve as a hint at their favourite football club.\n\nPink Floyd used Liverpool's infamous chant âYouâll Never Walk Aloneâ in their song âFearlessâ, leading many people to believe that perhaps the Floyd were Liverpool fans, but that is not the case.\n\nRoger Waters recently confirmed the fact that he is a Gunner, in a video on social media, highlighting an incident that took place in Gaza and what Celtic fans did in response to it. Towards the end of the video, he says, âIâm an Arsenal supporter myselfâ.\n\n#4 Michael Jackson â Fulham\n\nFulham owner Mohamed Al Fayed unveils Michael Jackson statue\n\nThe late âKing Of Popâ, Michael Jackson was one of the foremost icons of pop-music in his time. The legendary singer and dancer had a controversial life, but his music is loved by millions, if not billions around the world. MJâs songs â âSmooth Criminalâ, âBillie Jeanâ, âThrillerâ and âBeat itâ remain his all-time classics but he was also a close friend of Fulham FC owner Mohamed Al Fayed.\n\nHe visited Fulhamâs home ground Craven Cottage a few times and was confirmed as a Fulham fan. After his untimely demise, the clubâs owner even built a statue in his honour at the stadium.\n\nHowever, the statue was removed from Craven Cottage by new owner Shahid Khan after he bought the club from Al-Fayed in 2013 and moved to the National Football Musuem in Manchester in 2014. Strangely enough, Fulham got relegated from the Premier League in May 2014, shortly after the removal of the statue. The clubâs ex-owner Al-Fayed suggested that the removal of Michael Jackson's statue caused the clubâs relegation after 13 seasons in the top-flight, citing that it was a lucky charm for the club.\n\n#3 Damon Albarn (Blur & Gorillaz) â Chelsea\n\nDamn Albarn with Jose Mourinho at Chelseaâs training ground\n\nWe now come to our top 10, and kick it off with Damon Alborn, the brains behind the band âGorillazâ. Most people donât know what he looks like, but if youâre a die-hard fan of Albarnâs work, or from the UK, you would know that he was the lead singer of the British band Blur.\n\nThose who played FIFA RTWC 1998 on the PC back in the day wouldâve heard the Blur smash hit âSong 2â in the opening credits. Since then he's gone on to major success as the creator of Gorillaz making hits like âFeel Good Incâ, âClint Eastwoodâ, âStyloâ and â19-2000â â the last which was again used in FIFA 2002.\n\nHe is a life-long Chelsea fan and was delighted when Jose Mourinho re-joined the London club back in 2013 saying, \"Mourinho - I'm delighted he's back! To us he is the special one. I've met him, I've been very lucky to meet him.â\n\nHe also knows his football pretty well as he said back then, \"As for the team, On his day, Eden Hazard is spellbinding, I think Willian's been a bit of revelation this season and I like (Nemanja) Matic, but I still like the old crew.â\n\n#2 The Beatles â Liverpool or Everton or Arsenal?\n\nThe Beatles are regarded as the greatest band of all time\n\nOk so letâs set the record straight. The Beatles were arguably the greatest band ever (according to most people), they pretty much own every record in the music industry from most number one singles to number one albums to highest all-time album sales â you name it.\n\nHowever, the plain fact is that none of the Beatles took football very seriously. They represented the city of Liverpool more than Liverpool football club. Weâll still give you a bit of the theories nonetheless.\n\nPaul McCartney supposedly leans towards Everton because his family are all Evertonians. In an interview with Radio Merseyside he said, âHereâs the deal: my father was born in Everton, my family are officially Evertonians, so if it comes down to a derby match or an FA Cup final between the two, I would have to support Everton.â\n\nâI support them both[Liverpool and Everton]. They are both great teams. But if it comes to the crunch, Iâm Evertonian.â\n\nGeorge Harrison wasnât really much of a football fan. He was quoted, when asked about which club he supported saying, âThere are three teams in Liverpool and I prefer the other one.â â Not much of a football fan, quite clearly.\n\nJohn Lennon wasnât a big football fan either, but it is believed he supported Liverpool as a child. However, a drawing he made when he was 11 years old showing an FA Cup Final between Arsenal and Newcastle in 1952 has baffled Beatles and Liverpool fans for years. The drawing was used in his 1974 album âWalls and Bridgesâ. Newcastle beat Arsenal 1-0 to win the FA Cup in that final.\n\nHowever, he was not a fan of either club or football in general and it was just a memory he drew as a child.\n\nFinally, Ringo Starr is apparently an Arsenal fan because his Londoner father took him to only Arsenal games in his youth. But the drummerâs children are season ticket holders at Anfield. So in the end, it just leaves everything ambiguous with the Beatles.\n\n#1 Oasis - Manchester City\n\nBrothers Noel and Liam Gallagher are life-long Manchester City fans\n\nThe notorious brothers Noel and Liam Gallagher who are known as Oasis are life-long Manchester City fans. Weâve all probably sung âWonderwallâ at some point in our lives after precisely 4 or more drinks.\n\nOasis are well known for hit numbers like âDonât Look Back In Angerâ, âStop Crying Your Heart Outâ and âChampagne Supernovaâ. Both brothers Noel and Liam support Manchester City and grew up in Manchester itself. Liam was quoted saying, âI love Mancini (former Manchester City and Premier League winning manager), he is nearly as cool as me,â back when Roberto Mancini was City boss.\n\nHis brother Noel admitted to âcrying like a babyâ when Sergio Aguero scored THAT famous goal that won Manchester City the Premier League title back in 2011/12. The older Gallagher said in one interview, âThe first game my dad ever took me to was City v Newcastle United at Maine Road in 1971. That was it; City became my team.â\n\nNoel Gallagher even interviewed Pep Guardiola at the start of the 2016/17 season.\n\nYou could say theyâre pretty die-hard."
