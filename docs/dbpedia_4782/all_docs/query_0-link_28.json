        "text": "One of the breakout stars of the 2023 NRLW season has re-committed to the Newcastle Knights for another two years.\n\nSheridan Gallagher made every post a winner following her successful transition from professional football to become an integral part of the Hunter club’s premiership-winning team.\n\nThe tough-as-teak winger, who debuted against the St George Illawarra Dragons in round one, scored a try in Newcastle’s 24-18 grand final victory over the Gold Coast Titans in October, enabling the side to secure back-to-back titles for the first time in history.\n\nIt capped a meteoric rise for Gallagher in rugby league circles.\n\nIn 2021, the 22-year-old took the field for the Western Sydney Wanderers in the A-League Women’s (ALW) competition before captaining the Young Matildas at the 2022 FIFA U20 Women’s World Cup in Costa Rica.\n\nShe’ll now remain with the Knights until at least the end of 2025.\n\nDirector of football Peter Parr was delighted to retain the services of Gallagher.\n\n“Given Sheridan had only played two games of rugby league before the 2023 season, it is phenomenal what she has achieved by playing every game and winning a premiership,” he said.\n\n“She was also named our Rookie of the Year.\n\n“So, it is clear she will continue to grow and improve in the future.”\n\nNewcastle’s 2024 squad, under new coach Ben Jeffries, is shaping up well as the Knights focus on a three-peat of crowns.\n\nThe main losses, at this stage, are Tiana Davison and Jasmin Strange, who are heading to the Sydney Roosters.\n\nIronically, Jeffries and the girls will kick off their 2024 campaign with a blockbuster against the Chooks at McDonald Jones Stadium on Thursday 25 July.\n\nThe players and coaching staff are expected to hit the training paddock in late May or early June, seven weeks prior to the season opener.\n\nNewcastle Knights NRLW 2024 squad: Abigail Roache, Caitlan Johnston, Felila Kia, Georgia Roche, Hannah Southwell, Jesse Southwell, Jayde Herdegen, Jules Kirkpatrick, Kayla Romaniuk, Laishon Albert-Jones, Nita Maynard, Oliva Higgins, Shanice Parker, Simone Karpani, Tamerah Leati, Tamika Upton, Tayla Predebon, Viena Tinao, Yasmin Clydsdale; Lily-Ann White, Leah Ollerton\n\nFor more sports stories:\n\nALM: Jets re-focus on next assignment\n\nCessnock claims bragging rights in John Bull Shield showdown\n\nREAL NRL: Newcastle Rebels name strong squad to defend title"
