        "text": "Tackling the laws of rugby\n\nRugby is governed by laws, not rules. The laws of the game are designed to produce an entertaining and free-flowing contest for possession in an attempt to score the most points.\n\nThe laws of rugby are constantly evolving and are the same all over the world, wherever the game is played. In general, the laws governing play are straightforward about whatâs allowed, but three crucial parts can be somewhat confusing: the tackle situation, advantage, and offsides:\n\nIn a nutshell, when a tackle is made in rugby the requirements are that the tackler releases the tackled player, who then releases the ball so that players who are on their feet can use it.\n\nAdvantage simply means that when one team makes an error, the other team can try to capitalize on it instead of the referee immediately stopping the action. If the players canât capitalize on the error, play restarts where the original mistake took place.\n\nSpecific offsides laws exist for different phases of play, but essentially players canât be involved if theyâre in front of a teammate who last played the ball or are behind the ball when the opposition has it.\n\nKey rugby terms\n\nFor the first time rugby player or viewer, the sport can appear to be a chaotic collection of indecipherable movements and haphazard collisions.\n\nIn reality, rugby is highly technical and organized with specific laws governing all aspects of play. To get you on the right track early, here are the four most important parts of rugby to familiarize yourself with before watching a match.\n\nLineout: Looks somewhat like a jump-ball in basketball, with both teams lining up opposite each other, but one team then throws the ball down the middle of the tunnel. Lineouts restart play after the ball, or a player carrying it, has gone out of bounds.\n\nMaul: Occurs when a player carrying the ball is held by one or more opponents, and one or more of the ball-carrierâs teammates bind on the ball-carrier. All the players involved are on their feet and moving toward a goal line. Open play has ended.\n\nRuck: One or more players from each team, who are on their feet and in contact, close around the ball on the ground. Once a ruck has been formed, players canât use their hands to get the ball, only their feet.\n\nScrum: A contest for the ball involving eight players who bind together and push against the other teamâs assembled eight for possession of the ball. Scrums restart play after certain minor infractions.\n\nKey positions and scoring\n\nLike most sports that didnât originate in North America, the game of rugby can be difficult to comprehend at first glance because of the large number of players involved, the seemingly random calls of the referee, and the wide variety of strategies employed by different teams to score points and get wins.\n\nThe following sections outline who all the players are, explain what the referee is generally looking for during the rugby match, and spell out the basic skills required to be successful on the pitch.\n\nRugby positions\n\nA rugby team has 15 positions. Each one wears a specific number and has individual responsibilities:\n\n1 and 3 are the props\n\n2 is the hooker\n\n4 and 5 are the locks\n\n6 and 7 are the flankers\n\n8 is, conveniently enough, the eightman\n\nThis group is collectively referred to as the pack or the forwards. This groupâs main goal is to win possession of the ball. These players are usually the heavyweights of the team, using their bulk and strength to try to overpower their opponents.\n\nA rugby team has another group as well â the backs or back line:\n\n9 is the scrumhalf\n\n10 is the flyhalf\n\n11 and 14 are the wings\n\n12 and 13 are the inside and outside centers\n\n15 is the fullback\n\nRugby scoring\n\nThe aim of rugby is to score more points than the opposition. This is done in four different ways:\n\nTry: The most valuable play is to score a try, which means touching the ball down in the opponentâs in-goal area or on their goal line. Doing so is worth five points and earns that team the right to attempt a conversion kick.\n\nConversion kick: This kick is worth an additional two points. The conversion kick is taken from a spot in line with where the ball was originally grounded, so scoring as close to the posts as possible is best.\n\nPenalty kick: Penalties for various infractions can be used to take a kick at goal, which is worth three points.\n\nDropped goal: A dropped goal, which occurs when the player drops the ball on the ground and then kicks it just as it bounces, is worth three points if it goes through the uprights."
