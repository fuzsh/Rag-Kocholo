I heard whispers that the new NRLW coach for 2024 would be a woman.

Aussies were awful in the second game and they had no idea how to use Tamika. Wouldn’t want him anywhere near our team\n\nThere is a trial match on this weekend, Newcastle Rebels (all best talent from the real NRL teams) v a combined Newcastle Knights NSW cup/Jersey Flegg team\n\nSo will be interesting to see what players Jersey Flegg based on the team but would be no real NSW cup talent as most 1st choices are pretty much in the NRL trial v sharks\n\nLook this will be an interesting match.\n\nWouldn’t put it past me if the Real NRL Rep squad puts a number on the Knights Cup/Flegg squad.\n\nIt probably be good to see demand more respect from the knights toward the Newcastle Local Comp\n\nLook this will be an interesting match.\n\nWouldn’t put it past me if the Real NRL Rep squad puts a number on the Knights Cup/Flegg squad.\n\nIt probably be good to see demand more respect from the knights toward the Newcastle Local Comp\n\nMany maggots in the team?"
