The Newcastle Rebels flexed its collective muscle to dispose of the Central Coast Roosters 36-14 in the NSWRL 2023 Men’s Country Championships opener at the weekend.

In its first outing in the tournament since 2016, the Adam Bettridge-coached team ran in seven tries to three at Morry Breen Oval on Saturday 4 March.

The scoreboard flattered the Roosters in the end, with Central Coast crossing twice in the final nine minutes while the Rebels were down to 11 men following the sin-binnings of James Taylor and Jack Welsh.

Newcastle, who pushed the Knights’ NSW Cup squad in a trial match last month, enjoyed a 14-4 lead at the break, thanks to tries to talented hooker Luke Huff, winger James Bradley and second-rower Wyatt Shaw, as well as a goal to Chad O’Donnell.

Central Coast’s lone points came via centre Toby Marks.

The Rebels then stepped it up a notch in the second half.

A four-pointer to Maitland Pickers centre Timanu Alexander pushed the visitors ahead 18-4.

Soon after, Macquarie Scorpions flyer Joe Woodbury showed a clean pair of heels to dive over in the corner. O’Donnell extended the margin to 24-4, courtesy of a successful conversion.

Six minutes later, Cessnock’s Huff fired a ball out to Woodbury, who grabbed his double. O’Donnell made no mistake for a 30-4 scoreline.

Almost immediately, Central Newcastle fullback Cameron Anderson added his name to the tryscoring list, too. O’Donnell converted, increasing the Rebels’ advantage to 36-4.

In the 70th minute, Taylor, Welsh and Roosters’ Rhys Ryan all received their marching orders.

With a one-man overlap, Central Coast managed to post late tries to Isaac Blackhall and Jack Smith, with Lachlan Hanneghan adding the extras with the boot.

In other first round northern pool clashes, the Western Rams annihilated the Northern Tigers 64-18 while the Northern Rivers Titans proved too good for the North Coast Bulldogs 42-6.
