Today the Newcastle Rugby League named a 26-player A-Plus Contracting & Polywelding Newcastlle Rebels squad to compete in this year’s Open Men’s New South Wales Rugby League Country Championships.

All the players from last year’s victorious A-Plus Contracting & Polywelding Newcastle Rebels team, which are still available for selection this year, have been selected again. 2024 coach Garth Brennan has also brought in a host of experienced players, including former NRL and Super League players Blake Ferguson (Kurri Kurri), Will Smith (West Newcastle) and Peter Mata’utia (Lakes United).

On announcing the squad, coach Garth Brennan said, ‘I wanted to reward all of the players that were part of last year’s successful campaign, so they have all been selected again this year and with the new players we’ve added, I think we will have a very competitive squad’.

Newcastle Rugby League, General Manager, Adam Devcich added ‘the Country Championships concept is all the stronger for having the best players in our region buying into it. So, from the outset I’d like to thank all the players and Garth for putting their hands up to be involved’.

The A-Plus Contracting & Polywelding Newcastle Rebels will start training towards the end of January and will play the Central Coast in Round 1 of the NSWRL Open Men’s Country Championships at Cessnock Sportsground on Saturday 2nd March 2024.
