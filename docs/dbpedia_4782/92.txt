The experienced trio, all signed with Newcastle Rugby League clubs for the 2024 season, were on Wednesday announced as part of a 26-player Rebels squad for the upcoming NSWRL Country Championships.

"Their motivation is right, they are doing it for the right reasons and want to give back to younger kids in the game," Rebels coach Brennan said. "Blake Ferguson, for example, I don't remember too many Australian players that have come back and played country football, which is a credit to Blake to be willing to do that. They were all overwhelmingly keen to be involved."

Premiers Maitland and fellow grand finalists South Newcastle unsurprisingly dominate the squad with six players from each club named. Cessnock, Wests (3), Lakes United, Kurri and Central (2) had multiple players included. Northern Hawks have a sole representative while Macquarie, who have had bulk player turnover since last season, are the only club not represented.

The squad will begin training in late January, twice a week, ahead of their first game against Central Coast at Cessnock Sportsground on Saturday, March 2. The match is a must-win as the Country Championships is an elimination tournament.
