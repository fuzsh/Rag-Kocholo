In an exciting initiative, the Newcastle Rugby League has today named an Emerging Newcastle Rebels squad that will play a Penrith Development representative squad. The Penrith squad will travel to the Hunter to play the Emerging Rebels on Saturday, 9 June.

The team will be coached by the 2017 Macquarie Scorpions premiership-winning first grade coach, Adam Bettridge. Bettridge and his selectors have named a 22-man squad of 18 to 20-year-olds, that include players from all eight Newcastle Rugby League District clubs.

The squad is dominated by players from the Lakes United Seagulls, who have eight representatives. The squad will train together for the first time this Wednesday night from 6.30pm at Harker Oval.
