The Board also includes four non-voting student Regents, one from each NU campus, that serve during their tenure as student body president.\n\nThe Board provides strategic leadership to the University, promoting and advocating for the advancement of the University's mission of education, research and outreach. Among its many duties, the most important include selecting the President of the University and approving the budget and tuition rates."
