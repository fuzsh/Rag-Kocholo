        "text": "If a supervisor or manager suspects that an employee's position has changed significantly enough to warrant a reclassification, they can choose to contact their Compensation Analyst to begin an informal discussion or simply go to job Builder and enter a formal reclass request. An informal discussion with a Compensation analyst is an opportunity to make an initial determination of the impact that changes have had on the position and the organization. If the Compensation analyst feels that the duties of the position have significantly changed, a formal review will be recommended. Once an employee has been performing the full scope of higher level duties for 30 days or more, the department may submit a request for review.\n\nIt is extremely important to request a formal reclassification review only when appropriate, and to make sure that the request is thoroughly prepared. Although about 90 to 95% of jobs that are formally submitted for reclassification review are upwardly reclassified, the ones that are denied can cause frustration for the employees involved.\n\nBack to Top\n\nDeterminant Factors in Classifying Jobs\n\nFreedom to Act\n\nAuthority, autonomy, independence of action, degree to which job tasks are dictated by policy, procedures, manuals, supervisor or department head.\n\nAre your tasks routine and repetitive or are they performed under broad guidelines?\n\nDo you independently determine work methods and tasks or is your work performed under established guidelines?\n\nAre you closely supervised or are your tasks more general involving established guidelines and work is reviewed less frequently?\n\nDo you take or recommend action under general supervision and established policies or take and recommend action under direction and generally defined objectives?\n\nComplexity\n\nThe difficulty of problems encountered in the course of work and the types of knowledge needed to solve them. Measures problem-solving skills along two scales; one, the types of problems encountered from routine to most difficult and two, the knowledge required to solve them from simple recognition and referral to the devising of solutions based on interpretation of policy and understanding of departmental objectives.\n\nDoes your job require special or unique skills?\n\nWhat types of problems do you have to solve?\n\nHow difficult are the problems you have to solve?\n\nDoes your job require a certain depth of knowledge or expertise?\n\nConsequences of Error\n\nMeasures the impact of errors made in the course of work and the consequence of error according to magnitude from those easily rectified to those that cause major unit disruption.\n\nHow do your errors impact those around you?\n\nAre your errors easily rectifiable or do they require involvement from others?\n\nWhat degree of impact is there if mistakes are made: Little or no impact from errors?\n\nWho is impacted by mistakes? Is it your department, the campus, external agencies?\n\nAre mistakes reversible?\n\nScope\n\nThe variety of work assigned, the degree of organizational skills required to complete the work, the knowledge of organizational units inside or outside the university and the diversity of deadlines and priorities governing the work.\n\nWhat is the variety of functions assigned?\n\nIs your scope limited and highly specific to the objectives of the department or is your scope broad requiring complete responsibility for a complex division?\n\nIs the coordination of activities diverse in nature?\n\nDo your functions have a significant affect on the department operations?\n\nSupervisory Responsibilities\n\nNumber, types and level of positions supervised, functions supervised, degree of supervisory authority, e.g. work leader or full supervisor, complexity and diversity of work supervised.\n\nDifficulty of supervision\n\nNumber and levels supervised\n\nVariety of functions supervised\n\nFull supervisor or a work leader\n\nDiversity of work supervised\n\nResponsibility for Resources\n\nThe extent of the resources for which the employee has responsibility including, but not limited to, human, financial, facilities, material, and information systems.\n\nNumber of employees supervised\n\nVariety of functions supervised\n\nLevels supervised (e.g. professional, technical, administrative, service)\n\nSpace managed (e.g. square footage)\n\nType of space managed (e.g. office, labs, classrooms)\n\nBudget size\n\nBudget sources and amounts (e.g. state, gifts, extramural, contracts & grants, reg fees, income, recharges, etc.)\n\nComplexity of the budget - Amount, kind, discretion on spending, and complexity as determined by number and types of accounts, where and who money comes from.\n\nCommunications\n\nTypes of verbal and written communications, who you typically communicate with, what information you typically are responsible for communicating and method of delivery.\n\nWho do you typically communicate with (e.g. administrative staff, major division heads, and department managers, the Chancellor or Regents)?\n\nWhat are you communicating about (e.g. routine procedures, diversified procedures, operational policy, long term planning)?\n\nHow often do you communicate with the various constituencies (yearly, quarterly, monthly, weekly, daily)?\n\n\"Majority Rule\"\n\nClassification title and level are dependent primarily on where the majority (50% or more) of job duties lie.\n\nBack to Top\n\nCommon Misconceptions About Reclassification\n\nThe employee on the line was cordial, clear and direct: “I just got my degree, so when do I get reclassified?” This call represents one of the common misconceptions about the University’s classification system. Classification is based solely upon the duties assigned to a position, not the qualifications of the incumbent. Put simply, we classify the JOB, not the person. We receive daily inquiries about classification, with the most common misconception revolving around this person-position distinction. Besides educational attainment, other person-related factors that we do not take into consideration when classifying a position include:\n\nLongevity — The length of time a person has worked at the University may positively affect a persons performance on the job, however, it is not a factor we use in determining the level of a position.\n\nSpeed — How fast a person can work or how much they can produce compared to others is a factor of performance. Reclassifications do not take into account an employee's performance.\n\nRetention — “She’s been offered a promotion”, more than one supervisor has complained. “If I can’t match it, I’ll lose my best employee.” While we understand your dilemma, the fear of losing an employee cannot be considered in classification decisions. The Equity Guidelines may be of interest to you and can be discussed with your Compensation Analyst.\n\nFinancial Need — “I just bought a new home, my daughter’s a sophomore at Vassar, I need a new car and my dog has ringworm.” Most of us could find a way to spend more money, and some occasionally have dire need, but classification cannot take personal financial conditions into consideration.\n\nDedication — We often hear about employees who, “Always arrive early, leave late, never take breaks, work weekends, etc.” Again this is a performance issue and should be addressed during annual merits.\n\nPersonality — An employee's unique personality to work in unusual conditions and with difficult co-workers is not a factor that can be considered when classifying a position. Unique skill and/or ability required for a position, however, can be considered and should be spelled out in the job description.\n\nFuture Projects — We only classify duties being currently performed, not those that might be added to a job down the line. As such, we suggest that reclassification request be delayed until new projects or assignments have begun.\n\nWhat, then, are some of the factors taken into consideration when making classification decisions? In brief, classification is based upon several factors: the nature, variety and difficulty of the duties; the responsibility for staff and resources; the knowledge and originality required; and the authority and relative autonomy of the position (see previous section \"Determinant Factors\")\n\nBack to Top\n\nReclassification Deadlines & Effective Dates\n\nOnce an employee has been performing the full scope of higher level duties for 30 days or more, the department may submit a request for review. Upon electronic receipt of a reclassification request, the compensation analyst has 30 - 90 days* to render a decision for all Tier 1 (non-MSP) positions, therefore departments should be prepared to provide any additional information the analyst may require within that time frame. If needed documentation cannot be made available or the employee being reviewed is not available for consultation, then the reclassification request will be denied and the department will be asked to re-submit when all supporting information can be provided.\n\nFor non-represented positions, the effective date of a reclassification is the first full day of the first full pay period following electronic receipt of a completed request.\n\nFor represented positions, the effective date of a reclassification varies depending on the type of reclassification (within-unit or out-of-unit) and the collective bargaining unit. Please refer to the applicable collective bargaining unit agreement and/or consult with your Compensation Analyst.\n\nRetroactive effective dates are not normally granted. It is the department’s responsibility to submit revised job descriptions reflecting changes of duties in a timely manner. Retroactive actions can seriously affect exemption status (FLSA), bargaining unit membership and pay issues.\n\nNon-Exempt to Exempt Reclasses:\n\nUpon reclassification from a non-exempt to an exempt position, all compensatory time balances must be cleared out within 30 days of the effective date of the action.\n\n* This time frame may either be shortened or lengthened depending on variables such as workload, staffing, and special projects.\n\nBack to Top"
