        "text": "<p>Hey cc, I’m curious to your opinions.\n\nHeres the gist of my situation:</p>\n\n<p>Major: Chemical engineering (I’ve been doing biomed research internship in HS, but i’m still not sure if whether I want to go into energy or biomed research)</p>\n\n<p>Distance: not really an issue, one school is a half hour drive further.</p>\n\n<p>Cost: not really an issue, I get good FA at Stanford and regents brings my cost down to my EFC, which is about 1k more than the cost of Stanford. (Scholarships should cover most of either school other than like the mandatory family contribution of 1k or so).</p>\n\n<p>People: I know a few people in Stanford pretty well from our last graduating class, and I know a dozen people pretty well in Berkeley for the same reason. (most likely know 20 or so at Berkeley and at least one at Stanford pretty well from this years class, still waiting on RD)</p>\n\n<p>Town: I like Berkeley’s town quite a lot, its cheap and close. Stanford seems to be rather isolated from Palo Alto, and the stuff costs a lot. </p>\n\n<p>Campus: I like Stanford’s campus quite a lot more. I love the Romanesque center and the general missionary revival style of the central campus. The people seemed to know each other a lot more and there seems to be less separation between the engineerings and the “normal” people, albeit there is still seem to be a divide. (just from my observations)</p>\n\n<p>Academics: I’ve heard many conflicting statements about either schools. Initially i thought it would be easier to get a high GPA at stanford, but from the people I’ve heard, ihum at Stanford can easily bum your grade (Just down to a B, but still), and the high caliber math students in the “on track” 5x series can bump your grade down as well. While at Berkeley, I can finish COC GE reqs with 1 semester of English, and according to the students there I know, it wouldn’t be hard to get a 4.0 (they are all pretty smart people though). </p>\n\n<p>Reputation/Future reputation/Budget cuts: Probably goes to Stanford, since they don’t seem to have any budget issues, and it looks to be a safer “investment” in the long run. I don’t I would need to worry about classes either way since regents now get priority registration, but budget cuts might influence the long term rep of Berkeley?</p>\n\n<p>Housing: since i’ll be living off of FA, Stanford’s all 4 years of housing seems like a much better choice. Though regents do get 4 years of housing if they want, I don’t want to be the token sophomore who didn’t move out of the dorms.</p>\n\n<p>I have a bit of a predisposition myself, but I really want to consider the options before I choose. What do you guys think? Any other major points about either university that I should consider?</p>"
