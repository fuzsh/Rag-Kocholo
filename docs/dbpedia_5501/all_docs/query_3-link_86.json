        "text": "Self-Help Aid\n\nStudent self-help options includes Federal Work-Study and Federal Direct Student Loans. Students who accept and use self-help options are committing to either working while attending school and/or repaying loans borrowed as a student to supplement other financial aid and savings to pay for educational expenses.\n\nSelf-help aid includes loans, which require repayment over a set amount of time and usually with interest. Most federal loans have a six-month grace period, giving you time to land a job after graduation before your first payment is due. And if you’re worried about debt, LendEDU.com reports that our students who use loans graduate with nearly 10% less debt than the national average.\n\nSelf-help aid also includes Federal Work-Study, a financial aid program that provides part-time jobs for students who are determined eligible by the FAFSA. The program encourages community service work and work related to your course of study.\n\nLearn About Loans »"
