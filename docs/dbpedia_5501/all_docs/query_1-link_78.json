        "text": "This Policy shall be applicable to all faculty and staff of Regent University, full-time and part-time, regular and temporary, and to any applicant for employment who has been offered and has accepted an available position.\n\nRegent University employees are expected to conduct themselves in a professional and Christ-like manner at all times and are expected to live by exemplary standards. Regent University requires that members of the Regent community—including faculty and staff—refrain from the illegal use of drugs and the abuse of addictive substances controlled by law. Regent University also forbids the use of alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, and cannabis oil products on campus and prohibits the abuse of these substances. The Apostle Paul exhorted the body of Christ that, if they truly loved their fellow man, they would set aside their personal freedom by refraining from behavior that might be a stumbling block to their weaker brother. Regent University encourages members of the Regent community to exercise their personal responsibility and, guided by Paul’s admonition, appropriately set aside their personal freedom and refrain from the use of alcohol and tobacco.\n\nIn addition to complying with the above guidelines, Regent University employees are also prohibited from engaging in the following activities:\n\nUsing, purchasing, selling, possessing, distributing, or accepting illegal drugs or drug-related paraphernalia while on or off the job and on or off campus;\n\nUsing, purchasing, selling, or distributing alcohol, marijuana, or cannabis oil while on campus;\n\nUsing, purchasing, selling, or distributing alcohol, marijuana or cannabis oil at University-related activities off-campus;\n\nShowing up for work or being on the job while impaired by illegal drugs and/or alcohol, marijuana or cannabis oil;\n\nTransporting illegal drugs, drug-related paraphernalia, and/or alcoholic beverages, marijuana, or cannabis oil in a University-owned, leased, or hired vehicle.\n\nFor purposes of this subsection, “on the job” shall be deemed to include meal periods, breaks, stand-by duty, and any time that an employee is acting in his or her capacity as a Regent University employee, whether on or off University property.\n\nAlthough the medically-authorized use of prescription drug(s)/medication(s) is not prohibited, any employee who is taking prescription or nonprescription drug(s)/medication(s) and has reason to believe, based on information provided by his or her physician, pharmacist, or the drug/medication label, that the drug/medication may impair the ability to safely and effectively perform the duties and responsibilities required of his or her position, shall promptly advise his or her immediate supervisor of the use of such drug(s)/medication(s). If an employee is prescribed medical marijuana or cannabis oil for a medical condition and needs to use the products on Regent campus, the employee must submit documentation from a medical provider.\n\nIn accordance with the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act of 1989, as amended, it is the Policy of Regent University that, as a condition of employment, an employee will notify the University of any criminal drug statute conviction for a violation occurring in the workplace no later than five (5) days after such conviction.\n\nRegent University recognizes that one of its most valuable assets is its employees, and its most important responsibility is to students whom it serves. In furtherance of this purpose, any employee who has a drug related or alcohol related problem is encouraged, for his or her own benefit, as well as the benefit of fellow employees and students, to voluntarily seek treatment for such problems through a treatment program of his or her choice. Any employee who believes he/she has a problem with drug and/or alcohol abuse is urged to seek counseling and treatment at a clinic of his or her choice. A list of some of the available clinics which provide counseling and/or treatment in this area are provided in this policy. All counseling and treatment sessions, as well as referrals, will be handled in a confidential manner.\n\nDisciplinary Sanctions for Employees\n\nRegent University will impose disciplinary sanctions on employees for violations of these standards of conduct.\n\nAny employee found to be engaging in those activities prohibited by this policy will be subject to discipline up to and including termination. Any employee engaged in illegal activity as outlined in this policy will be referred to the proper authorities.\n\nAny employee found to be in violation of this policy and/or who has received a final conviction in local, state, or federal court will be subject to discipline up to and including termination.\n\nUsing alcohol, marijuana, cannabis oil, or illegal drugs while at work is considered gross misconduct and warrants immediate termination.\n\nAny employee who voluntarily admits, in the absence of reasonable suspicion or of any conduct which alone would subject the employee or student to discipline, that he or she has a drug-related or alcohol-related problem may be referred to one of the clinics listed in this policy, and shall not be disciplined solely as a result of the admission."
