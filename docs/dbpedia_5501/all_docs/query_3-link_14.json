USG institutions are classified according to the following functional sectors:\n\nResearch Universities, which offer a broad array of undergraduate, graduate, and professional programs and are characterized as doctoral-granting with a Carnegie Classification of very high or high research activity. Associate degrees are typically not offered at research universities. The Nexus degree can be offered at research universities. While teaching is a core focus at all USG institutions, the emphasis on basic and applied research is much heavier at research universities than any other institutional sector. It is expected that institutions operating within this sector will be world-class research institutions with significant commitments to receipt of external funding, philanthropic giving, and fundraising at the highest levels.\n\nInstitution Primary Section/Function Secondary Sections/Function Secondary Sections/Function Georgia Institute of Technology Research University n/a Georgia’s technological research institution Georgia State University Research University State College University of Georgia Research University n/a Georgia’s land-grant institution and Agricultural experiment station Augusta University Research University n/a State’s dedicated health/sciences/medical college\n\nComprehensive Universities, which offer a number of undergraduate and master’s-level programs with some doctoral programs. Typically, associate-level degrees are not offered at comprehensive universities. The Nexus degree can be offered at comprehensive universities. Master programs at comprehensive universities are characterized as master’s-dominant. While teaching is a core focus at all USG institutions, the emphasis on basic and applied research is heavier at comprehensive universities than state universities or state colleges, but not emphasized as heavily as research universities. It is expected that institutions within this sector will be committed to being world-class academic institutions.\n\nInstitution Primary Section/Function Secondary Sections/Function Secondary Sections/Function Georgia Southern University Comprehensive University n/a Approved for doctoral programs Valdosta State University Comprehensive University n/a Approved for doctoral programs Kennesaw State University Comprehensive University n/a Approved for doctoral programs University of West Georgia Comprehensive University n/a Approved for doctoral programs\n\nState Universities, which offer a number of undergraduate and master’s-level programs, but very few doctoral programs. Associate-level degrees can be offered at these universities, but they are also typically limited. The Nexus degree can be offered at state universities. While teaching is a core focus at all USG institutions, the emphasis on research activity at these state universities includes some basic research, but is typically more focused on institutional or applied research.\n\nInstitution Primary Section/Function Secondary Sections/Function Secondary Sections/Function Albany State University State University State College n/a Clayton State University State University n/a n/a Columbus State University State University n/a Approved for doctoral programs Fort Valley State University State University n/a State’s 1890 land grant institution Georgia College & State University State University n/a State’s public liberal arts institution; approved for doctoral programs Georgia Southwestern State University State University n/a n/a Middle Georgia State University State University State College n/a Savannah State University State University n/a n/a University of North Georgia State University n/a State’s military college; approved for doctoral programs\n\nState Colleges\n\nBalanced Bachelor’s and Associate State Colleges\n\nInstitutions included in the balanced bachelor’s and associate-level state colleges group offer bachelor’s degrees, associate programs, and general education courses, but no graduate programs. These state colleges are characterized as balanced bachelor’s and associate-level degrees with bachelor’s programs focused on specialized academic and economic development program areas and regional, college-educated workforce needs. The Nexus degree can be offered at state colleges. The emphasis at these state colleges is on teaching and service with limited focus on basic or applied research activity.\n\nAssociate Dominant-Select Bachelor’s State Colleges\n\nInstitutions included in the associate dominant state colleges group are characterized as offering associate-dominant programs and general education courses, with very few, select, professionally-oriented bachelor’s degree programs. The select bachelor’s programs are focused on specialized academic and economic development program areas and regional, college-educated workforce needs. The emphasis at these state colleges is on teaching and service with limited focus on basic or applied research.\n\nInstitution Primary Section/Function Secondary Sections/Function Secondary Sections/Function Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College State College - Balanced Bachelor’s & Associate Degrees n/a State’s agricultural state college Atlanta Metropolitan State College State College - Balanced Bachelor’s & Associate Degrees n/a n/a College of Coastal Georgia State College - Balanced Bachelor’s & Associate Degrees n/a n/a Dalton State College State College - Balanced Bachelor’s & Associate Degrees n/a n/a Georgia Gwinnett College State College - Balanced Bachelor’s & Associate Degrees n/a n/a Gordon State College State College - Balanced Bachelor’s & Associate Degrees n/a n/a East Georgia State College State College - Associate Dominant, Select Bachelor’s n/a n/a Georgia Highlands College State College - Balanced Bachelor’s & Associate Degrees n/a n/a South Georgia State College State College - Associate Dominant, Select Bachelor’s n/a n/a\n\nInstitutions with a Blended Function\n\nAt times a USG institution may be approved by the Board to advance aspects of a mission from different functional sectors. When this occurs, an institution will have a blended institutional function with a primary sector function and a secondary function sector. While the institution will follow the function of their primary sector, it will also be authorized to function in accordance with aspects of the secondary sector function.\n\nNo institution may operate as an institution with a blended function unless approved by the Board of Regents. When the Board approves an institution as having a blended function, the Board will also approve the institution’s primary functional sector. The guidelines for obtaining Board approval to operate as an institution with a blended function and a list of institutions currently approved for a blended function can be found in the Academic & Student Affairs Handbook.\n\nThe Chancellor may, from time to time, direct institutions with a blended function on whether and to what extent the institution will implement primary functional sector requirements or secondary functional sector requirements.\n\n2.9 Institutional Effectiveness: Planning and Assessment\n\nEach University System of Georgia (USG) institution shall have a strategic planning process that maintains a current strategic plan in which institutional priorities are defined and through which the institution’s mission is carried out in accordance with the strategic directions and guiding principles established by the Board of Regents. The faculty and staff of each institution shall be involved in developing the planning process and shall be included in the structure by which the plan is implemented.\n\nIn addition, each institution shall have a formal process by which systematic assessment of institutional effectiveness is conducted and the results of assessments are used to achieve institutional improvement. Assessment processes may differ from institution to institution, but each institution shall assess:\n\nBasic academic skills at entry;\n\nGeneral education;\n\nDegree programs; and,\n\nAcademic and administrative support programs and/or functions.\n\nThe faculty and staff of each institution shall be involved in developing assessment processes and included in the structure by which those processes are implemented and used for improvement.\n\nEach institution shall link its substantive budget allocations and other major academic and administrative decisions to its planning and assessment processes to improve institutional effectiveness. In addition, institutional planning, assessment, and improvement processes are expected to contribute to the realization of the USG vision, mission, goals, and strategic initiatives.\n\nA current copy of each institution’s strategic plan shall be maintained in the University System Office. The plan will contain a description of the planning structure and process by which institutional priorities are set as well as the institution’s current priorities and goals. The plan shall also describe the processes used for assessing and improving institutional effectiveness.\n\n2.10 Presidents’ Meetings\n\nWhen directed by the Chancellor, the presidents of the University System of Georgia (USG) institutions shall convene in order to make recommendations to the Chancellor and through the Chancellor to the Board of Regents regarding all educational and administrative matters of concern to the USG as a whole.\n\n2.11 Title of Emeritus or Emerita\n\nThe title of President Emeritus or President Emerita may be conferred only by the Board of Regents on the recommendation of the Chancellor.

The Board of Regents will hold institutions accountable for their results.\n\nEach institution must maintain accreditation by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges and ensure that all programs requiring accreditation by law, regulation, or Board of Regents’ Policy are appropriately accredited.\n\n3.2.1 Faculty Membership\n\nIn all University System of Georgia (USG) institutions, the faculty will consist of the Corps of Instruction and the administrative officers.\n\n3.2.1.1 Corps of Instruction\n\nFull-time professors, associate professors, assistant professors, instructors, lecturers, senior lecturers, principal lecturers, and teaching personnel with such other titles as may be approved by the Board, shall be the Corps of Instruction. Full-time research and extension personnel and duly certified librarians will be included in the Corps of Instruction on the basis of comparable training. Persons holding part-time and adjunct appointments or other honorary titles shall not be considered to be members of the faculty.\n\n3.2.1.2 Administrative Officers\n\nFaculty status of full-time administrative officers will necessarily vary with the size and complexity of the institution. Administrative officers shall be appointed by the President of the institution and shall hold office at the pleasure of the President.\n\nTo ensure accountability and effective academic management, the President shall consult with the USG chief academic officer on significant personnel actions involving the institution’s chief academic officer to include appointment, qualifications for the position, and termination.\n\nA faculty member who has academic rank and rights of tenure in the Corps of Instruction and who accepts an appointment to an administrative office, other than President, shall retain the responsibilities and privileges of faculty membership, his or her academic rank, and rights of tenure as an ex officio member of the Corps of Instruction, but shall have no rights of tenure in the administrative office to which he or she has been appointed.\n\nThe additional salary, if any, for the administrative position shall be stated in the employment contract and shall not be paid to the faculty member when he or she ceases to hold the administrative position.\n\n3.2.1.3 Other Faculty Members\n\n3.2.2 Regents’ Awards for Excellence in Teaching and Student Success\n\nThe Board of Regents rewards excellence in teaching and student success through a system-wide awards program.\n\nEach institution is invited to annually nominate one teaching faculty member for each of the following awards: Felton Jenkins, Jr., Hall of Fame Faculty Award; Regents’ Award for the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning; and Regents’ Award for Excellence in Online Teaching. Additionally, each institution is invited to annually nominate one faculty or staff member for the Regents’ Excellence in Student Success Award and one academic department or program for each of the following awards: the Regents’ Excellence in Teaching Department/Program Award and the Regents’ Department/Program Excellence in Student Success Award. The USG Chief Academic Officer shall publish specific procedures, nomination guidelines, and award criteria.\n\nIn addition to the Regents’ Awards for Excellence in Teaching and Student Success, institutions shall develop and implement systematic programs to recognize and reward faculty and staff for excellence in teaching and service to students and professional staff for outstanding job performance and innovation on the job.\n\n3.2.3 Faculty Meetings, Rules, and Regulations\n\nThe faculty council, senate, assembly, or other comparable governance body at all USG institutions shall meet and shall appoint a secretary who shall keep a record of the proceedings. All meetings should comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including the Georgia Open Records Act and Georgia Open Meetings Act.\n\nThe faculty or the council, senate, assembly, or other comparable faculty governance body at an USG institution, shall, subject to the approval of the President of the institution:\n\nMake statutes, rules, and regulations for its governance;\n\nProvide committees as may be required;\n\nMake statutes, rules, and regulations for students regarding admission, suspension, expulsion, classes, courses of study, the learning environment, and requirements for graduation; and,\n\nMake regulations necessary or proper for the maintenance of high educational standards.\n\nA copy of each institution’s statutes, rules, and regulations made by the faculty shall be filed with the Chancellor and shall be published, implemented, and disseminated in accordance with SACSCOC regulations. The faculty shall have primary responsibility for those aspects of student life that relate to the educational process, subject to the approval of the President of the institution.\n\n3.2.3.1 University System of Georgia Faculty Council\n\nThe University System of Georgia Faculty Council (USGFC) shall provide a faculty voice on academic and educational matters and Board of Regents’ policies related to the profession, including but not limited to tenure and promotion, academic freedom, and post-tenure review. The USGFC shall be mindful and respectful of matters that are more appropriately handled at the institutional level but may make recommendations that have University System level impact or implications.\n\nMembership of the USGFC shall be comprised of one voting representative from each USG institution who is a member of that institution’s faculty and selected by a process determined by the faculty or faculty body of that institution. A copy of each institution’s process to determine its USGFC representative shall be maintained at the institution level and provided to the University System Office upon demand. The organization and governance of the USGFC shall be implemented according to policies and procedures established by the membership of the USGFC in the USGFC by-laws in consultation with and approved by the Chancellor or the Chancellor’s designee.\n\nNothing in this policy or the USGFC by-laws shall supersede the authority and responsibilities of institutional presidents provided by Board of Regents’ Policy. With respect to matters specific to their institutions, institution presidents remain the official medium of communication between their institutional faculties and the Chancellor.\n\n3.2.4 [Reserved]\n\n3.3.1 Core Curriculum: Core IMPACTS\n\nThe USG core curriculum, Core IMPACTS, is designed to ensure that students acquire essential knowledge in foundational academic areas and develop career-ready competencies. There are seven Core IMPACTS areas. As presented in the table below, IMPACTS is a mnemonic for students to appreciate the impact of the overall core curriculum.\n\nStudents at all institutions must meet the Core IMPACTS requirements in all specified areas. However, institutions have considerable flexibility to tailor courses that meet these requirements to their institutional missions. Students must complete all Core IMPACTS requirements in order to earn associate of arts, associate of science, nexus, bachelor of arts, or bachelor of science degrees.\n\nThe Core IMPACTS framework establishes common system-wide Learning Outcomes and Career- Ready Competencies for each area, ensuring that courses completed in an area at one institution or through eCore are fully transferable to the same area at any other USG institution. Students do not have to complete all of the requirements for a Core IMPACTS area to transfer credit within that area. In some cases, a student may transfer from a sending institution that has a higher amount of credit in a core area than the receiving institution to which the student is transferring. In those cases, students should still get full credit for courses at the receiving institution, with the excess credit being applied to another core area.\n\nSystem-wide Learning Outcomes and Career-Ready Competencies have been established for each Core IMPACTS area. To be included in a Core IMPACTS area, courses must address the approved Learning Outcomes and Career-Ready Competencies for that area. More details are available in the Academic and Student Affairs Handbook.\n\nEach institution’s Core IMPACTS requirements must add up to 42 semester credit hours, with minimum credit hours in each area as follows:\n\nCore IMPACTS Area Shorthand Credit Hours Institutional Priority Institution At least 3 credit hours Mathematics & Quantitative Skills Mathematics At least 3 credit hours Political Science & U.S. History Citizenship At least 3 credit hours Arts, Humanities & Ethics Humanities At least 6 credit hours Communicating in Writing Writing At least 6 credit hours Technology, Mathematics & Sciences*\n\nSTEM\n\nAt least 7 credit hours* Social Sciences Social Sciences At least 3 credit hours\n\n*At least 4 of the STEM credit hours must be in a lab science course. Given the importance of the STEM disciplines, any institution that wishes to drop STEM below 10 hours must make a compelling intellectual case that its core proposal will not lead to students knowing less about STEM. [An example of such a compelling case might be if the institution proposed to put 3 or more hours of math in the Institution area and 7 hours of natural science in the STEM area.]\n\n(BoR Minutes, October 2009, October 2014, October 2015; March 2016; October 2023)\n\n3.3.2 Academic Approval for Off-Campus Instructional Sites\n\nAn “off-campus instructional site” is a site located geographically apart from the main campus at which an institution provides instruction and where students go to access support services. An off-campus instructional site is not independent of the institution’s main campus.\n\nInstitutions wishing to offer courses or degree programs externally must adhere to the guidelines, criteria, and nomenclature contained in guidelines issued by the Chancellor or his or her designee, which are maintained in the Academic and Student Affairs Handbook. The designation of an off-campus instructional location as a campus, center, or consortium requires approval by the Board of Regents through its Committee on Academic Affairs.\n\nThe procedures for approving facilities for off-campus instruction are outlined in the Board of Regents’ Policy on Off-Campus Institutional Sites. Institutions shall not initiate requests for new off-campus instructional facilities prior to the approval of related academic proposals unless authorized by the Chief Academic Officer to proceed concurrently during the academic review process.\n\nIt is desirable in most instances to have the closest qualified institution respond to off-campus credit course needs. In cases where requests for services exceed the qualifications or ability of the closest institution, attempts should be made to have such requests met by other qualified USG institutions. Prior to the offering of off-campus course work, the President of the institution proposing such work will notify the president of any other USG institution located in closer geographic proximity to the site proposed for the off-campus course work. In the event that the involved institutions are unable to arrive at a mutual agreement on the offering of off-campus credit courses, the matter will be referred to the Chancellor for final resolution.\n\n3.3.3 Distance Education\n\n“Distance education” is defined as a formal educational process in which the majority of the instruction in a course occurs when the student and instructor are not in the same place and the instruction is delivered using technology. Instruction may be synchronous or asynchronous. No institution may offer programs completely online prior to the Board of Regents’ approval of the academic program or programs to be offered completely online.\n\n3.3.4 United States and Georgia History and Constitutions\n\nAll USG institutions shall give instruction in the history of the United States, in the history of Georgia, and in the essentials of the United States Constitution and the Constitution of Georgia. No undergraduate student shall receive a certificate of graduation or a degree without successfully completing coursework or passing a satisfactory examination on the history of the United States, the history of Georgia, and the provisions and principles of the United States Constitution and the Constitution of Georgia.\n\n3.3.5 University System and Technical College System of Georgia Articulation Agreement\n\nThe articulation agreement is based on the principles of serving student needs, avoiding duplication of mission, using state resources efficiently, and expanding opportunities for post-secondary attainment in Georgia.\n\nA Post-secondary Oversight Council comprised of appropriate System Office staff from the TCSG and USG will meet on a regular basis to assure compliance with this articulation agreement, address other articulation issues if they arise, and encourage the development of programs and policies to support Georgia’s college completion goals.\n\n3.3.5.1 Associate Degrees\n\nAssociate of Applied Science Degrees\n\nIn order to minimize duplication of program offerings across TCSG and USG, the following procedures are required for all new Associate of Applied Science (A.A.S.) degrees. All new A.A.S. degrees proposed for implementation at USG institutions will be submitted through the following process:\n\nThe USG institution submits the degree proposal to the USG System Office. If the degree duplicates an existing AAS degree at a TCSG institution near the proposing USG institution, the proposed degree must have a letter of support signed by the respective TCSG college president.\n\nUSG System Office staff will present the proposal to the TCSG System Office for review by System Office staff.\n\nIf recommended by TCSG System Office staff, the proposal will be reviewed by the TCSG Board.\n\nThe TCSG Board will return the proposal to USG with a recommendation for support or nonsupport.\n\nUSG System Office staff will share the recommendation from the TCSG Board with the USG Board. The USG Board will take final action on the proposal.\n\nAssociate of Arts (A.A.) and Associate of Science (A.S.) degrees are primarily for students who intend to transfer to another institution for completion of a four-year degree program. These degrees are generally awarded through successful completion of a planned program of study at USG institutions.\n\nAssociate of Arts Degrees (A.A.)\n\nTCSG institutions will not offer Associate of Arts degrees.\n\nAssociate of Science Degrees (A.S.)\n\nAll new Associate of Science degrees proposed for implementation at TCSG colleges, regardless of delivery system will be submitted through the following process:\n\nThe TCSG institution submits the degree proposal to the TCSG System Office. The proposed degree must have an articulation agreement signed by the respective TCSG and USG institutions’ presidents.\n\nTCSG System Office staff will present the proposal to the USG System Office for review by System Office staff.\n\nIf recommended by USG System Office staff, the proposal will be reviewed by the Board of Regents (BOR).\n\nThe BOR will return the proposal to TCSG with a recommendation for support or non-support.\n\nTCSG System Office staff will share the recommendation from the BOR with the TCSG Board. The TCSG Board will take final action on the proposal.\n\nBachelor Degrees\n\nBachelor degrees are offered only through USG institutions. Technical certificates and diplomas are generally awarded for the successful completion of a planned program of study through the colleges of TCSG. These programs are typically not designed for transfer.\n\n3.3.5.2 General Education Course Transfer\n\nThis policy outlines the mechanisms through which TCSG general education courses are approved for transfer to USG institutions and is set forth to ensure that students who transfer between TCSG and USG institutions will not be required to repeat the course work approved for transfer that was successfully completed at another institution.\n\nUSG institutions and TCSG institutions will accept general education courses for transfer between their respective institutions as articulated in the TCSG USG Course Transfer Chart referenced in the USG Academic and Student Affairs Handbook. Courses will only be accepted from institutions accredited by the SACSCOC. Both the USG and the TCSG are committed to and responsible for assuring that faculty teaching these courses meet the SACSCOC comprehensive standard for faculty qualifications.\n\nNew TCSG general education courses proposed to be added to the TCSG USG Course Transfer Chart for transfer to USG institutions into any of the Core IMPACTS domains will follow the same review procedure required for new Core Curriculum courses proposed by USG institutions:\n\nThe TCSG System Office staff will present the proposed course(s) to the USG System Office.\n\nThe USG System Office will convene a meeting of the appropriate disciplinary Regents Academic Advisory Committee(s). Non-voting faculty designated from the TCSG will be invited to participate.\n\nCourse(s) approved by a Regents Academic Advisory Committee for transfer into any of the Core IMPACTS domains will be recommended to the USG General Education Council for review.\n\nCourse(s) approved by the USG General Education Council will be reviewed by System Office staff who will submit the courses to the USG Board of Regents for final action.\n\nUpon receipt of USG Board of Regents approval for the designated course(s), TCSG colleges will clearly publicize the designated approval categories to TCSG students, and the USG will update the TCSG USG Course Transfer Chart and notify all USG institutions.\n\nThis same process would apply to any TCSG courses already on the USG Course Transfer Chart that have been significantly modified.\n\n3.3.6 Academic Credit Earned Through Extra-Institutional and Prior Learning\n\nUniversity System of Georgia (USG) institutions shall provide students with opportunities to be evaluated and earn academic credit for assessed extra-institutional and prior learning toward the completion of a degree program, including course credit earned from military experience.\n\nOnce transcribed to the student record, credits awarded for extra-institutional and prior learning at a USG institution shall be applied toward a degree program, regardless of how the credit was earned. Credits awarded for extra-institutional and prior learning by one USG institution shall transfer as the designated course to another USG institution if a student has passed a higher-level course in the course sequence offered at the previously attended USG institution.\n\nInstitutions shall maintain a review process for extra-institutional and prior learning that adheres to SACSCOC policies and guidelines, minimizes the number of credits that do not contribute to progress toward a degree program, and does not improperly affect student eligibility for financial aid. Additional guidance for awarding credit for extra-institutional or prior learning is provided in the Academic & Student Affairs Handbook.\n\n3.3.6.1 Course Credit Earned from Military Experience\n\nEach USG institution shall maintain a policy and procedures that outline the awarding of academic credit for appropriate courses in the curriculum for military experience to students who are veterans or military service members based on the guidelines contained in the Academic & Student Affairs Handbook. When awarding credit, USG institutions shall reference the Joint Service Transcript (JST), DD-214, or transcripts from the Army/American Council on Education Registry Transcript System (AARTS), Community College of the Air Force (CCAF), Coast Guard Institute (CGI), and other appropriate transcripts that summarize the skills and experiences obtained during military service. In evaluating military transcripts, institutions should consult the American Council on Education (ACE) Guide to determine the course recommendation made by that organization.\n\n3.3.6.2 Course Credits for Standardized Examinations\n\nEach USG institution shall maintain a policy and procedures that outline the awarding of academic credit for appropriate courses in the curriculum for successful completion of college-level curricula and standardized examinations offered by nationally recognized organizations, such as Advanced Placement Program (AP), the International Baccalaureate Program (IB), the College Level Examination Program (CLEP), and DANTES Subject Standardized Test Program (DSST). The policy and procedures shall apply to both in-state and out-of-state students and comply with the guidelines set forth in the Academic & Student Affairs Handbook.\n\nA student may opt not to accept credits. If a student believes that the assessment of his or her work from standardized examination and subsequent awarding of credits is in error, the student may file an appeal with the appropriate academic department office and request a re-assessment. As with other academic matters, if the issue is not satisfactorily resolved at the department level, the student may then appeal to the dean of the respective school or college, with a final appeal to the vice president for academic affairs, whose decision in the matter will be final.\n\n3.3.7 Learning Support Programs\n\nEach USG institution that admits students required by Board of Regents or USG policy to enroll in Learning Support courses as they attempt core curriculum courses shall provide a program or programs to support the academic needs of students who enroll in Learning Support. Institutions may set higher standards for placement and the program may include other Learning Support components. The USG chief academic officer will issue administrative procedures regarding the operation of these programs.\n\n3.4.1 Semester System\n\nAll University System of Georgia (USG) institutions shall operate on the semester system.\n\n3.4.2 Uniform Academic Calendar\n\nThe academic calendar for each USG institution shall consist of two semesters, each with at least 15 weeks of instructional time, as defined by federal regulations issued by the United States Department of Education. The 15 weeks of instructional time shall not include registration or final examinations.\n\nAll USG institutions, with the exception of Medical School and Dental School at Augusta University and the College of Veterinary Medicine and School of Law at the University of Georgia, shall begin and end classes for fall semester and spring semester within the prescribed periods set forth in the Academic & Student Affairs Handbook. Each institution will determine all other necessary dates for the semester, including the possibility of flexible scheduling within and between semesters. Each term must be separated by a minimum of one day.\n\nThe President of a USG institution or his or her designee has the authority to set the Academic Calendar for the institution within the parameters of this policy. Requests for exceptions to this policy must be submitted in writing by the President of the institution and approved in writing by the USG Chief Academic Officer.\n\n3.4.3 Religious Holidays\n\nEach USG institution shall establish a process for evaluating requests for leave to observe religious holidays.\n\n3.4.4 Instructional Time\n\nA minimum of 750 minutes of instruction or equivalent is required for each semester credit hour. A course offered in fewer than 15 instructional weeks shall contain the same total hours (contact hours, preparation time, content, and requirements) as the same course offered in the standard 15-week semester.\n\n3.5.1 Grade Point Average\n\nAll University System of Georgia (USG) institutions shall be on a 4.00 grade point average (GPA) system, calculated to and truncated at two significant digits.\n\n3.5.1.1 Grades Approved in Determining the Grade Point Average\n\nThe following grades are approved for use in institutions in the determination of the Grade Point Average:\n\nGrade Grade Point Average A Excellent (4.00) B Good (3.00) C Satisfactory (2.00) D Passing (1.00) F Failure (0.00) WF Withdrew failing (0.00)\n\nThe University of Georgia and Georgia State University shall be on the following grade point average system, calculated to and truncated at two significant digits, with the following numeric equivalents.\n\nGrade Grade Point Average A 4.00 A- 3.70 B+ 3.30 B 3.00 B- 2.70 C+ 2.30 C 2.00 C- 1.70 D 1.00 F 0.00\n\nIn addition, Georgia State University will be allowed to use an A+ designation, with the equivalent numerical value of a 4.30. The University of Georgia and Georgia State University shall not use plus/minus grades in the calculation of the HOPE Scholarship grade point average.\n\n3.5.1.2 Cumulative Grade Point Average\n\nThe cumulative grade point average in each USG institution will be calculated by dividing the number of hours scheduled in all courses attempted in which a grade of A, B, C, D, F, or WF has been received into the number of grade points earned on those hours scheduled. The cumulative grade point average will be recorded on the student’s permanent record. Institutional credit shall in no way affect the cumulative grade point average.\n\nOther averages may be computed by each institution for internal uses as may be required.\n\n3.5.2 Symbols Not Included in Determining the Grade Point Average\n\nThe following symbols are approved for use by USG institutions in the cases indicated, but shall not be included in the determination of the GPA:\n\n“I” indicates that a student was doing satisfactory work but, for non-academic reasons beyond his or her control, was unable to meet the full requirements of the course. The requirements for removal of an “I” are left to the respective institutions. However, if an “I” is not satisfactorily removed after three academic terms of residence, the symbol “I” will be changed to the grade “F” by the appropriate official.\n\n“IP” indicates that credit has not been given in courses that require a “CP” continuation of work beyond the term for which the student signed up for the course. This symbol cannot be substituted for an “I.”\n\n“K” indicates that a student was given credit for the course via a credit by examination program approved by the respective institution’s faculty (e.g., CLEP, AP, Proficiency). “K” credit may be provided for a course the student has previously audited if the institutional procedures for credit by examination are followed.\n\n“S” indicates that credit has been given for completion of degree requirements other than academic course work. The use of this symbol is approved for dissertation and thesis hours, student teaching, clinical practicum, internship, and proficiency requirements in graduate programs. Exceptions to the use of this symbol for academic course work must be submitted to the USG chief academic officer for approval.\n\n“U” indicates unsatisfactory performance in an attempt to complete degree requirements other than academic course work. The use of this symbol is approved for dissertation and thesis hours, student teaching, clinical practicum, internship, and proficiency requirements in graduate programs. Exceptions to the use of this symbol for academic course work must be submitted to the USG chief academic officer for approval.\n\n“V” indicates that a student was given permission to audit this course. Students may not transfer from audit to credit status or vice versa. Students may register, however, on a credit basis for a course that has previously been audited.\n\n“W” indicates that a student was permitted to withdraw without academic penalty. Each institution, following guidance outlined in the Academic and Student Affairs Handbook, shall determine the last date within a term for withdrawals without academic penalty. Exceptions in cases of hardship will be determined by the appropriate official of the respective institution.\n\n“WM” indicates a student was permitted to withdraw under the Board of Regents policy for military service refunds as provided in Board Policy. The use of this symbol indicates that this student was permitted to withdraw without penalty at any time during the term.\n\n3.5.3 Grade Point Average Upon Academic Renewal\n\nUndergraduate students who are either returning to a University System of Georgia (USG) institution or are transferring to a USG institution may be eligible for Academic Renewal, which signals the initiation of a new grade point average to be used for determining academic standing. This provision allows USG degree-seeking students who experienced earlier academic difficulty to make a fresh start and have one final opportunity to earn an associate or bachelor’s degree.\n\n3.6.1 Creation of Academic Programs\n\nNew degree programs to include nexus, associate, bachelor’s, master’s, and doctoral degrees shall not be added to curricula of a University System of Georgia (USG) institution unless recommended by the President of the institution and the Chancellor and approved by the Board of Regents.\n\nUSG institutions that offer programs that provide academic credit but award certificates, post-baccalaureate certificates, or post-graduate level certificates rather than degrees must notify the USG chief academic officer pursuant to guidelines set forth in the Academic and Student Affairs Handbook.\n\n3.6.2 Termination of Academic Programs\n\nThe termination of academic programs, degrees, or majors shall be submitted to the Chancellor for review and recommendation for action by the Board of Regents. Institutions must notify the USG Executive Chief Academic Officer at least two years prior to a formal request to terminate programs, degrees, or majors as outlined in the Academic and Student Affairs Handbook, including a teach-out plan in accordance with SACSCOC policies.\n\n3.6.2.1 Temporary Suspension of Academic Programs\n\nA temporary suspension of an academic program, degree, or major may be approved by a president for a period not to exceed two (2) academic years to allow for program review, to consider enrollment problems, to deal with faculty shortages, or for other similar reasons. The imposition and removal of a temporary suspension shall be reported to the USG Executive Chief Academic Officer.\n\n3.6.3 Comprehensive Academic Program Review\n\nEach USG institution shall conduct comprehensive academic program reviews for Career Associates, Associate degrees with a designated major, bachelor degrees and graduate degrees. Consistent with efforts in institutional effectiveness and strategic planning, each USG institution shall develop procedures to evaluate the effectiveness of its academic programs to address the quality, viability, and productivity of efforts in teaching and learning, scholarship, and service as appropriate to the institution’s mission. Institutional review of academic programs shall involve analysis of both quantitative and qualitative data, and institutions must demonstrate that they make judgments about the future of academic programs within a culture of evidence. Planning and conduct of academic program reviews shall be used for the progressive improvement and adjustment of programs in the context of the institution’s strategic plan and in response to findings and recommendations of the reviews. Adjustment may include program enhancement, maintenance at the current level, reduction in scope, or, if fully justified, consolidation or termination.\n\n3.7 Research\n\nThe Board of Regents shall continue efforts to provide adequate funds for increased research programs of the highest quality at University System of Georgia (USG) institutions through state appropriations and other outside sources.\n\nIn addition, the Board has approved the following special research centers:\n\nThe Agricultural Experiment Stations of the University of Georgia.\n\nThe Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI) of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.\n\nThe Marine Resources Program of the University of Georgia with three units:\n\nThe Marine Institute on Sapelo Island;\n\nThe Marine Resources Extension Center on Skidaway Island; and,\n\nThe Skidaway Institute of Oceanography on Skidaway Island.\n\n3.8.1 General\n\nThe faculty shall recommend to the president of the institution the candidates for degrees that the institution has been authorized by the Board to confer. A record of all degrees awarded shall be filed in the office of the Registrar of the institution conferring the degree.\n\nAbsent the approval of the USG chief academic officer, no degree program shall exceed the following credit hours, exclusive of physical education activity/basic health or orientation course hours that the institution may require:\n\nAssociate degrees shall consist of 60 credit hours;\n\nBachelor’s degrees shall consist of 120 credit hours;\n\nNexus degrees shall consist of 60 credit hours; and\n\nMaster degrees shall consist of 30 credit hours\n\n3.8.2 Associate Degrees\n\n3.8.2.1 Transfer Degrees\n\nAssociate of Arts (A.A.) and Associate of Science (A.S.) degrees are primarily intended to be transfer degrees leading to the baccalaureate degree, although some provide students with a recognized two-year degree credential and employment opportunities upon graduation. All A.A. and A.S. degrees shall consist of 60 semester credit hours; 42 hours of the required core curriculum coursework as outlined in Board Policy, 18 hours of lower division requirements related to preparatory or prerequisite work for a bachelor’s degree field of study, and do not include institutional requirements in physical education, activity, basic health, or orientation. Associate degrees beyond 60 credit hours require the approval of the USG chief academic officer.\n\nAssociate degrees with a major field of study are subject to USG policies on comprehensive program review and all relevant SACSCOC standards for a distinct program of study. Distinct transfer associate-level degree programs of study must have appropriate student learning outcomes, must be assessed, must demonstrate continuous improvement based on assessment results, and may be advertised as available programs of study at the institution.\n\n3.8.2.2 Career Degrees\n\nCareer degrees include the Associate of Applied Science (A.A.S.) and Associate of Science in allied health areas (A.S. in designated health fields).\n\nCareer degrees are primarily designed to prepare students for employment upon graduation. A.A.S. degrees are generally awarded through successful completion of a planned program of study at Technical College System of Georgia institutions. USG institutions that have been approved by the Board of Regents to offer career associate degrees must designate specific disciplinary areas of study (e.g., A.A.S. in Criminal Justice or A.S. in Nursing) that are considered distinct programs of study. Career degrees are subject to Board of Regents and USG policies on comprehensive program review and all relevant SACSCOC standards for a distinct program of study. Career degree programs of study may be advertised as available programs of study at the institution.\n\n3.8.3 Nexus Degrees\n\nNexus degrees are comprised of 42 hours of general education and 18 credit hours of specialty requirements that consist of 12 credit hours of upper division courses (e.g. 3000-4000) and 6 credit hours of substantive experiential learning. The substantive experiential learning must have significant emphasis on developing competencies and capabilities in a strategic career field aligned to the talent demand areas and needs of the state of Georgia. Nexus degrees are subject to Board of Regents and USG policies on comprehensive program review and all relevant SACSCOC standards for a distinct program of study.\n\n3.8.4 Bachelor Degrees\n\nBachelor of Arts (B.A.) and Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degrees are comprised of general education and designated major of study requirements. Bachelor degrees consist of 120 credit hours and have a coherent program of study. Bachelor degrees are subject to Board of Regents and USG policies on comprehensive program review and all relevant SACSCOC standards for a distinct program of study. Bachelor degrees beyond 120 credit hours require the approval of the USG chief academic officer.\n\n3.8.5 Master Degrees\n\nMaster degrees are comprised of 30 hours of a coherent program of study beyond the bachelor’s degree. Master degrees are subject to Board of Regents and USG policies on comprehensive program review and all relevant SACSCOC standards for a distinct program of study. Master degrees beyond 30 credit hours require the approval of the USG chief academic officer.\n\n3.8.6 Ph.D. Programs\n\nPh.D. programs shall be limited to research universities. Comprehensive universities do not normally offer Ph.D. degrees. In exceptional cases, however, they may offer the Ph.D. when:\n\nThe program supports the central mission of that university;\n\nThere is demonstrated demand for the program;\n\nThere is demonstrated need for graduates of the program; and,\n\nThere is assurance of high academic quality.\n\nAll such program proposals will be subject to Board approval processes for graduate programs. The USG chief academic officer will seek counsel from appropriate USG leaders and other research universities, and then make recommendations to the Chancellor and the Board of Regents as to whether a comprehensive university has met these criteria.\n\nIn the case of applied doctorates, the Chancellor may recommend exceptions to the above policy under guidelines adopted by the USG chief academic officer.\n\n3.8.7 Diplomas Earned at Institutions Under a Previous Name\n\nUpon request, a USG institution may issue a certificate to a graduate who received a diploma under a previous name of the institution in line with the requirements set forth in the Academic & Student Affairs Handbook in order to memorialize the individual’s status as an alumnus or alumna of the institution.\n\n3.8.8 Honorary Degrees\n\nHonorary degrees are subject to approval by the Board of Regents. Honorary degrees may be conferred by USG research, comprehensive, state universities and state colleges to persons of notable achievement in an academic field, the arts and letters, the professions, or public service. An institutionally approved process for advancing candidates for consideration in a timely fashion shall include recommendations by a faculty committee and selection by the president of a candidate to be communicated to the Chancellor. Honorary degrees may be conferred upon candidates recommended by the Chancellor and approved by the Board of Regents.\n\nCurrent elected or appointed national office holders or officials of the State of Georgia to whom the USG institutions are directly or indirectly answerable, as well as persons who are announced candidates for national or state elective offices are ineligible for honorary degrees. Current Regents and all current USG employees are also ineligible.\n\n3.9 Academic Advisement\n\nAcademic advising is an ongoing process across each University System of Georgia (USG) institution to ensure student success from admission to graduation. Each USG institution shall maintain an academic advising framework to develop cognitive and non-cognitive skills in each student that promote a productive academic mindset and result in a clear understanding of educational, professional, and personal goals and a plan to achieve those goals.\n\nThe USG Chief Academic Officer shall establish guidelines in the Academic and Student Affairs Handbook related to academic advisement.\n\n3.9.1 Undergraduate Academic Advisement\n\nEach USG institution shall maintain a collaborative framework for undergraduate academic advising that enables each undergraduate student to establish a clear purpose for the student’s college studies by choosing a degree program or one of a small number of affinity groups of disciplines (academic focus areas), and follow a clear course sequence organized into a degree pathway to graduation that is informed by design principles that are aligned with student success and completion.\n\nThe academic advising framework shall also include provisions for advising students throughout their undergraduate education, including provisions for monitoring and documenting student progress toward educational goals and providing outreach for students who are at risk of not meeting educational goals.\n\n3.10 Academic Textbooks\n\nThe University System of Georgia (USG) Chief Academic Officer shall establish guidelines in the Academic & Student Affairs Handbook regarding the designation and sale of textbooks required for coursework at USG institutions, including provisions that:\n\nPromote increased communication between students, faculty, and college bookstores concerning the use of textbooks in the classroom, the designation of required versus recommended texts, textbook costs (including a designation of free and low-cost textbooks and textbook alternatives), textbook adoption schedules, alternative acquisition methods, and other factors affecting the designation and sale of textbooks in order to increase the options available to students in meeting their cost of education while maintaining academic rigor and quality of instruction;\n\nEnsure that bookstore operations, whether managed internally or outsourced to private vendors, offer the best value to students in acquiring textbooks and actively promote alternative options to help minimize student cost;\n\nRequire a review process at the institution for determining if faculty may use self-authored texts in their classroom; and,\n\nProhibit faculty from reselling sample texts provided by publishers or profiting from any financial incentives offered by publishers in the assignment of specific texts.\n\n4.1.1 Institutional Responsibility\n\nAdmission, discipline, promotion, graduation, and formulation of all rules and regulations pertaining to students of University System of Georgia institutions are matters to be handled by the institutions within the framework of policies and regulations issued by the Board of Regents. Students failing to comply with Board of Regents’ or institution rules, regulations, or directives may face disciplinary actions.\n\n4.1.2 Financial Needs Analysis\n\nApplicants for student financial aid programs that are based on need must file an acceptable needs analysis which has been approved by the United States Department of Education.\n\nUniversity System of Georgia (USG) institutions shall accept and process the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) for federal and state student aid programs. USG institutions may elect to accept and process other needs analysis systems approved by the United States Department of Education.\n\n4.1.3 Student Voting Privileges\n\nStudents are encouraged to vote in all federal, state, and local elections. A student whose class schedule would otherwise prevent him or her from voting will be permitted an excused absence for the interval reasonably required for voting.\n\n4.1.4 Fraternities and Sororities\n\nEach University System of Georgia institution may decide whether social fraternities and sororities shall be established at the institution and whether each social fraternity or sorority shall be local only or affiliated with national groups. Each institution may promulgate rules and regulations concerning the establishment, organization, governance, and discipline of social fraternities and sororities.\n\n4.1.5 Students with Disabilities\n\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires colleges or universities to make necessary modifications to ensure that the institution does not discriminate or have the effect of discrimination against a qualified student with a disability. The USG is committed to providing equal educational opportunities to all students, and offers students with disabilities a variety of services and accommodations to ensure that both facilities and programs are accessible.\n\nThe USG has established sets of common standards and procedures for evaluating and administering accommodations for students with disabilities, which can be found in the Academic Affairs Handbook.\n\nThe policy is pursuant to the provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act. The USG is a “public entity” within the meaning of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12131, and 28 C.F.R. § 35.104, and, therefore, subject to Title II of the ADA, and its implementing regulations, 28 C.F.R. Part 35. It is also a “recipient” of “federal financial assistance” within the meaning of Section 504, 29 U.S.C. § 794, and 34 C.F.R. § 104 and is therefore subject to Section 504 and the relevant implementing regulations, 34 C.F.R. Part 104 (BoR Minutes, November 2008).\n\n4.1.6 Admission of Persons Not Lawfully Present in the United States\n\nA person who is not lawfully present in the United States shall not be eligible for admission to any University System institution which, for the two most recent academic years, did not admit all academically qualified applicants (except for cases in which applicants were rejected for non-academic reasons).\n\n4.2 Undergraduate Admissions\n\nIndividuals seeking undergraduate admission to any University System of Georgia (USG) institution shall meet the requirements for one of the categories listed below and any additional requirements that may be prescribed by the institution. Meeting minimum requirements does not guarantee admission to any USG institution.\n\nThese policies must be applied in accordance with the standards, procedures, and guidelines provided in the Academic & Student Affairs Handbook. Any exceptions to these admission policies may be made only with written approval of the USG Chief Academic Officer.\n\n4.2.1 Admission Requirements for Programs Leading to an Associate or Baccalaureate Degree\n\nThese policies must be applied in accordance with the standards, procedures, and guidelines provided in the Academic & Student Affairs Handbook.\n\n4.2.1.1 Freshman Requirements\n\n4.2.1.2 International Freshman Requirements\n\nFreshman applicants educated outside of the United States shall demonstrate academic preparation comparable to that required of applicants completing high school within the United States. Freshman applicants whose native language is not English shall be required to demonstrate proficiency in the English language.\n\n4.2.1.3 Exceptions to Freshman Requirements\n\nUSG institutions may admit freshman applicants not meeting freshman requirements but showing evidence of college readiness using the following alternative categories.\n\nLimited Admissions Category\n\nIn recognition of the fact that a limited number of applicants do not meet established standards but do demonstrate special potential for success, institutions are authorized to grant admission to a limited number of such applicants. Institutions shall establish minimum criteria for Limited Admission, which shall include the use of multiple measures whenever possible, such as interviews, portfolios, and records of experiential achievements. In addition, institutions shall require a high school diploma or state-issued high school equivalency diploma or certificate. Research, comprehensive, and state universities shall also require that applicants complete the RHSC and have at least the minimum SAT or ACT scores provided in the Freshman Requirements policy, as well as the minimum FI as specified in the Academic & Student Affairs Handbook.\n\nPresidential Exceptions\n\nEach institution Presidents or his or her designee may grant exceptions to the Limited Admission requirements if the applicant shows promise for academic success and has at least a high school diploma or a state-issued high school equivalency diploma or certificate.\n\nPresidential Exceptions are included as part of the institution’s maximum percentage for Limited Admission.\n\nApplicants with Outstanding Scores\n\nInstitutions may grant admission to applicants who demonstrate very high academic ability by achieving a Total SAT or Composite ACT score in the upper five percent of national college-bound seniors for the most recent test year and who show other evidence of college readiness.\n\nAdmission of Students with Disabilities\n\nBecause the core curriculum of each institution requires students to complete college-level courses in English, mathematics, social science, and science, all students must complete the RHSC in these areas. Applicants with disabilities that preclude the acquisition of a foreign language may petition for admission without this requirement according to procedures established by the USG.\n\nStudents with disabilities are expected to meet the sector’s minimum SAT or ACT score requirements, but should request the appropriate testing accommodations from the agencies administering the SAT or ACT.\n\n4.2.1.4 Dual Enrollment Requirements\n\nDual Enrollment provides academically talented high school students with the opportunity to enroll in college-level courses. Institutions shall establish criteria for the admission of high school students to participate in Dual Enrollment in accordance with the guidelines set forth in the Academic & Student Affairs Handbook.\n\nEach Early College represents an approved partnership between a Georgia public school system and a USG institution. Early College participants are eligible for enrollment in college courses while they are enrolled in an Early College.\n\n4.2.1.5 Transfer Requirements\n\nInstitutions shall establish minimum transfer admission criteria of at least the following:\n\nInstitution Sector Minimum Transfer GPA Research Universities 2.30 Comprehensive and State Universities 2.00 State Colleges Eligible to continue or return to sending institution\n\nThe transfer GPA is based on transferable credit hours from postsecondary institutions previously attended. It is obtained by dividing the total number of transferable credit hours attempted at all postsecondary institutions previously attended into the total number of quality points for those courses. It excludes institutional credit hours (such as Learning Support courses) and vocational course hours.\n\nStudents with fewer than 30 transferable semester credit hours must meet the freshman admission requirements at the institution to which they are applying.\n\n4.2.1.6 International Transfer Requirements\n\nTransfer applicants educated outside of the United States shall demonstrate academic preparation comparable to that required of applicants completing their coursework within the United States. Transfer applicants whose native language is not English shall be required to demonstrate proficiency in the English language.\n\n4.2.1.7 Exceptions to Transfer Requirements\n\nIn recognition of the fact that a limited number of transfer applicants do not meet established standards but do demonstrate special potential for success, institutions are authorized to grant admission to a limited number of such applicants. Institutions shall use multiple measures whenever possible to assess potential for success. The number of applicants who may be granted admission is restricted by institutional sector as set forth in the Academic & Student Affairs Handbook.\n\n4.2.1.8 Non-Traditional Requirements\n\nInstitutions may admit as many non-traditional students as is appropriate based on institutional mission, academic programs, and success in retaining and graduating non-traditional students in accordance with the guidelines set forth in the Academic & Student Affairs Handbook.\n\nNon-Traditional Freshmen\n\nAn applicant who has been out of high school at least five years, whose high school class graduated at least five years ago, and who has earned fewer than 30 transferable semester credit hours may be evaluated as a non-traditional freshman.\n\nNon-Traditional Transfers\n\nAn applicant who has been out of high school at least five years or whose high school class graduated at least five years ago, and who has earned 30 or more transferable semester credit hours may be evaluated as a non-traditional transfer.\n\n4.2.1.9 Persons Aged 62 or Over\n\nPursuant to the provisions of the Georgia Constitution, the USG establishes the following rules with respect to enrollment of persons 62 years of age or older in USG programs. To be eligible for enrollment under this provision such persons:\n\nMust be residents of Georgia, 62 years of age or older at the time of registration, and shall present a birth certificate or other comparable written documentation of age to enable the institution to determine eligibility.\n\nMay enroll as a regular or auditing student in courses offered for resident credit on a “space available” basis without payment of fees, except for supplies, laboratory or shop fees.\n\nShall meet all USG and institution undergraduate or graduate admission requirements. However, institutions may exercise discretion in exceptional cases where circumstances indicate that certain requirements such as high school graduation and minimum test scores are inappropriate. In those instances involving discretionary admission institutions will provide diagnostic methods to determine whether or not participation in Learning Support will be required prior to enrollment in regular credit courses. Reasonable prerequisites may be required in certain courses.\n\nShall have all usual student and institutional records maintained. However, institutions will not report such students for budgetary purposes.\n\nMust meet all USG, institution, and legislated degree requirements if they are degree-seeking students.\n\nMay not enroll in dental, medical, veterinary, or law schools under the provisions of this policy.\n\n4.2.2 Admission Requirements for Undergraduate Programs Not Leading to the Baccalaureate Degree\n\nThese policies must be applied in accordance with the standards, procedures, and guidelines provided in the Academic & Student Affairs Handbook.\n\n4.2.2.1 Admission to Career Programs\n\nAdmissions requirements for career certificates and career degrees (Associate of Applied Science degrees and Associate of Science degrees in allied health areas) depend upon the extent to which the general education component is based on Core Curriculum courses. There are two sets of admissions requirements, as specified in the Academic & Student Affairs Handbook:\n\nPrograms with a Core-based general education component allowing more than 12 semester hours of Core curriculum course work; and,\n\nPrograms with non-Core general education components allowing 12 or fewer semester hours of Core Curriculum coursework.\n\nStudents admitted in the career degree or certificate category who have not completed a career degree may apply for admission to programs that lead to a baccalaureate degree if they meet regular or Limited Admission requirements. Students admitted in this category can only be admitted into a program leading to a baccalaureate if:\n\nOn admission to the institution they would have met the requirements for regular or Limited Admission; or,\n\nThey show exceptional promise and are admitted as a Presidential Exception. Students admitted in this category must fulfill all learning support and RHSC requirements\n\n4.2.2.2 Admission of Non-Degree Students\n\nInstitutions may admit applicants to enroll as non-degree students for a maximum total of 18 semester credit hours, including institutional credit. ESL coursework does not count towards the 18 semester hour limit.\n\n4.2.2.3 Admission of Postbaccalaureate Students\n\nInstitutions may admit applicants who have earned a baccalaureate degree from a regionally accredited institution to enroll as non-degree postbaccalaureate students in courses with no limitation on the number of hours of undergraduate credit these students can earn.\n\n4.2.2.4 Admission of Transient Students\n\nInstitutions may admit applicants who are enrolled in another institution to temporarily enroll as transient students, as outlined in the Academic & Student Affairs Handbook.\n\n4.2.2.5 Admission of Auditors\n\nInstitutions shall establish criteria for the admission of applicants to register as auditors in accordance with the guidelines provided in the Academic & Student Affairs Handbook.\n\n4.2.3 Additional Admission Policies\n\n4.2.3.1 Institution Admission Requirements\n\nIn addition to the Board of Regents’ and USG admission requirements, each USG institution may establish additional requirements for admission to the institution or to special programs at the institution provided that the requirements are not less stringent than any Board of Regents’ policy or guideline.\n\n4.2.3.2 Referral of Students to Other Institutions\n\nInstitutions should assist Georgia applicants who have been denied admission in identifying another USG institution that more appropriately matches their academic credentials.\n\n4.2.3.3 Right to Refuse Admission\n\nAn applicant may be declared eligible for admission, registration, enrollment, or re-enrollment at a USG institution only after satisfying all requirements established by the Board of Regents and the institution. The institution may consider the character and qualifications of the applicant in making admission decisions. In order that this examination and appraisal may be made, the applicant shall furnish to the institution such biographical and other information, including references, as may be required by the institution.\n\nEach USG institution reserves the right to refuse admission to:\n\nA non-resident of Georgia;\n\nAn applicant whose admission would cause the institution to exceed its maximum capacity;\n\nAn applicant whose request for admission is only to a program that is already filled;\n\nAn applicant whose transcript is from an unaccredited institution; or\n\nAn applicant who is otherwise ineligible for admission.\n\n4.2.3.4 Right to Limit Admissions\n\nThe Chancellor may limit the number of students admitted to an institution.\n\n4.3.1 Out-of-State Enrollment\n\nEach USG institution is required to file an annual report detailing the number of out-of-state students enrolled during the previous academic year (BoR Minutes, April, 1995, p. 21).\n\n4.3.2 Classification of Students for Tuition Purposes\n\n4.3.2.1 Description of Terms Used in the Policy\n\nTerms used in the Tuition Classification Policy not found below can be found in the Tuition Classification Glossary of Terms.\n\n4.3.2.2 United States Citizens\n\n4.3.2.3 Non-Citizens\n\nA non-citizen student shall not be classified as in-state for tuition purposes unless the student is legally in this state and there is evidence to warrant consideration of in-state classification as determined by the Board of Regents. Lawful permanent residents, refugees, asylees, or other eligible noncitizens as defined by federal Title IV regulations may be extended the same consideration as citizens of the United States in determining whether they qualify for in-state classification.\n\nInternational students who reside in the United States under non-immigrant status conditioned at least in part upon intent not to abandon a foreign domicile shall not be eligible for in-state classification.\n\n4.3.3 Tuition Differential Waivers\n\nSee Section 7.3.4 of this Policy Manual for instances in which an institution may waive the differential between in-state and out-of-state tuition.\n\n4.3.4 Verification of Lawful Presence\n\nEach University System institution shall verify the lawful presence in the United States of every successfully admitted person applying for resident tuition status, as defined in Section 7.3 of this Policy Manual, and of every person admitted to an institution referenced in Section 4.1.6 of this Policy Manual.\n\n4.4.1 Regents’ Opportunity Grants Program\n\nThe 1978 General Assembly (H.B. 1463) amended the law creating the Georgia Higher Education Assistance Authority so as to authorize the Board of Regents to award grants, scholarships, or cancelable loans to economically disadvantaged students who are residents of Georgia enrolled in a graduate or professional degree program in a USG institution.\n\nIn compliance with provisions of this Act, the Board adopted the following criteria for the award of such scholarships:\n\nEach institution shall submit an annual request to the Chancellor for a specific number of scholarships and grants based upon estimated numbers of eligible candidates in the following year. The Board of Regents shall annually allocate the available positions to the institutions based on the objectives and needs of the USG institutions. The Board of Regents will notify the Higher Education Assistance Authority of the total amount of funds they are to disburse to each institution.\n\nTo attract the most talented students from the target groups to USG programs, 100 scholarships and grants in the amount of $5,000 each per academic year shall be offered. These scholarships and grants may be utilized as part of a total student financial aid package.\n\nEach institution awarding the scholarships and grants shall be responsible for determining compliance with the intent and the terms of the law establishing the scholarships and shall maintain adequate records of students receiving scholarships and grants. A recipient does not have the right to transfer this scholarship to another USG institution. Each institution will make an annual report to the Chancellor on the utilization of these funds.\n\nTo remain eligible to receive funds under this program, the recipient must maintain good standing and minimum status of effective full-time graduate study, as defined by the ins"
