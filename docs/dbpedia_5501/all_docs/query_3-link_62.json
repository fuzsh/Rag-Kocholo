        "text": "The University of Maryland admission review process is guided by the principles outlined in the Statement of the Philosophy of Undergraduate Admissions. In keeping with this philosophy, the admission review factors listed above will allow the Admission Committee to identify those applicants, who as individuals and as a group, will enrich and benefit from the campus learning environment, and thus benefit the entire student body.\n\nThe undergraduate admissions process is rigorous and individualized. As the university must make fine distinctions among large numbers of highly qualified applicants, the ability to consistently assess all information presented in the application becomes increasingly important. Therefore, the university employs a holistic review process that engages the expertise of professional educators whose judgments—based upon consideration of each applicant’s credentials measured by all admissions criteria—build an entering class that will best complement the existing student body and meet the university’s mission objectives.\n\nIn this context, academic merit is assessed on the basis of each applicant’s achievements and potential in a broad range of academic categories, as influenced by the opportunities and challenges faced by the applicant. These categories include:\n\nEducational Performance\n\nPotential for College Success\n\nPotential to Promote Beneficial Educational Outcomes and to Contribute to Campus and Community Life\n\nStudents’ Persistence and Commitment to Educational Success.\n\nAt UMD, we value all of your strengths and talents. We know there is more to you than grades and SAT scores. While they are important, we also want to know about your interests and background and what makes you unique. We review all application components and our thorough review process considers more than 24 factors.\n\nEach category of the holistic review is assessed by a combination of quantitative and qualitative factors. These factors are flexibly applied, so the listing does not reflect order of importance.\n\nHigh school achievement\n\nGrades in academic subjects\n\nProgression of performance\n\nBreadth of life experiences\n\nGeographic origin\n\nGender\n\nSAT I or ACT scores*\n\nWork experience\n\nRecognition of special achievements\n\nExtenuating circumstances\n\nSocio-economic background\n\nWritten expression of ideas (as demonstrated in the essay)\n\nRank in class (actual or percentile)\n\nExtracurricular activities\n\nSpecial talents or skills\n\nCommunity involvement\n\nCommunity service\n\nDemonstrated leadership\n\nLearning differences\n\nQuality of coursework\n\nResidency status\n\nFamily educational background\n\nAcademic endeavors outside of the classroom\n\nEnglish as a second language/Language spoken at home\n\n*UMD has decided to extend its practice to make SAT and ACT scores optional through to the Spring and Fall 2025 application cycles. For more information please review our Application FAQs."
