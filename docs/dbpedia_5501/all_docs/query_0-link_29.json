        "text": "International Students\n\nInternational services staff members are charged with meeting the needs of the Universityâ€™s large and diverse international student population and ensuring compliance with all government regulations affecting non-immigrant students. They also provide an extensive series of orientation programs and activities prior to the start of fall semester for new students that introduce them to their respective campus and community; inform them of their responsibilities related to their immigration status and to requirements concerning health insurance; and ensure their basic needs are met before classes begin. Advising services and programs for students continue throughout their stay to help them interpret and understand U.S. culture, become involved in campus and community life, and integrate their learning with conditions in the home country. International student advisors assist students from abroad with all non-academic questions and concerns, refer them to other offices as needed, and work with all campus units to ensure their success.\n\nInternational Scholars, Staff and Faculty\n\nIn addition to a large international student population, the University has a significant number of J-1 visiting scholars with and without University appointments, and international staff and faculty on various other non-immigrant (temporary) statuses. There are also some international staff and faculty members who are in the process of adjusting their non-immigrant status to permanent residency (\"green card\").\n\nThe two most common non-immigrant statuses used by these individuals include the J-1 Exchange Visitor category, and the H-1B temporary worker category. It is the role of each international services office to work with academic units that invite J-1 scholars to its campus to ensure that they receive the required document (DS-2019) needed to obtain the J-1 visa abroad, enter the U.S. legally, and remain in legal status throughout their stay at the University.\n\nIt is the role of the IC on the Ann Arbor campus to handle all immigration related work for employment-based non-immigrant (e.g., H-1B, TN, E-3, O-1) and immigrant (ie: green card) petitions on all three campuses, including Michigan Medicine. Also, if international faculty or staff members are already present in the U.S., the IC on the Ann Arbor campus works with the hiring unit to enable the faculty or staff member to come to U-M in the appropriate non-immigrant status to be legally employed. In these cases, IC staff members provide immigration advice and guidance to the inviting departments and to international staff and faculty; and ensure compliance with all government regulations affecting these individuals."
