(a) The governing board of every state institution of higher education is directed to designate special depository banks, subject to the approval of the comptroller, for the purpose of receiving and keeping certain receipts of the institution separate and apart from funds now deposited in the state treasury. The receipts here referred to are described in Subsection (b) of this section. The comptroller is directed to deposit the receipts, or funds representing such receipts, enumerated herein, in the special depository bank or banks nearest the institution credited with the receipts, so far as is practicable, and is authorized to withdraw such funds on drafts or checks prescribed by the comptroller. The comptroller is authorized to promulgate rules and regulations to require collateral security for the protection of such funds pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 404, Government Code. For the purpose of facilitating the clearance and collection of the receipts herein enumerated, the comptroller is hereby authorized to deposit such receipts in any state depository bank and transfer funds representing such receipts enumerated herein to the respective special depository banks. Banks so designated as special depository banks are hereby authorized to pledge their securities to protect such funds.\n\n(b) The governing board of every state institution of higher education shall deposit in the state treasury all cash receipts accruing to any college or university under its control that may be derived from all sources except auxiliary enterprises, noninstructional services, agency, designated, and restricted funds, endowment and other gift funds, student loan funds, funds retained under Chapter 145 of this code, and Constitutional College Building Amendment funds. The comptroller is directed to credit such receipts deposited by each such institution to a separate fund account for the institution depositing the receipts, but he shall not be required to keep separate accounts of types of funds deposited by each institution. For the purpose of facilitating the transferring of such institutional receipts to the state treasury, each institution shall open in a local depository bank a clearing account to which it shall deposit daily all such receipts, and shall, not less often than every seven days, make remittances therefrom to the comptroller of all except $500 of the total balance in said clearing account, such remittances to be in the form of checks drawn on the clearing account by the duly authorized officers of the institution, and no disbursements other than remittances to the state treasury shall be made from such clearing account. All money so deposited in the state treasury shall be paid out on warrants drawn by the comptroller as provided by law.\n\n(c) The legislature is authorized to create revolving funds for the handling of funds of institutions of higher education, as enumerated herein, by making provision in each biennial appropriation bill enacted by the legislature.\n\n(d) Nothing in this section affects the provisions of Title 47, Revised Civil Statutes of Texas, 1925, usually referred to as the State Depository Law. However, the limitation of deposits contained in Article 2532, Revised Civil Statutes of Texas, 1925, as amended, shall not apply insofar as the specific funds enumerated in this section are concerned.\n\n(e) This section prevails over Sections 51.001-51.007 of this code to the extent of any conflict.\n\n(f) Interest earned on the receipts deposited under this section to an institution's separate fund account in the state treasury shall be credited to that separate fund account.\n\n(g) Revenues collected at institutions of higher education and deposited in the state treasury pursuant to this section and Section 34.017, Natural Resources Code, and the interest earned thereon, are dedicated to the institution which collected and deposited the funds irrespective of the year the funds were collected, deposited, or earned. These funds may be only used for the support, maintenance, and operation of the institution as provided for by law. Section 403.094(h), Government Code, does not apply to funds described in this section.\n\n(h) Tuition revenues and revenue collected under Section 34.017, Natural Resources Code, that are deposited in the treasury pursuant to this section, and the interest earned on those revenues, shall be treated as designated funds in the general revenue fund. Notwithstanding a pledge of those revenues made or to be made in the proceedings approved by the governing board of an institution of higher education authorizing the issuance or incurrence of bonds, the deposit of those revenues in the treasury to the credit of an account in the general revenue fund does not:\n\n(1) affect in any manner the pledge of the revenues or the governing board's ability to pledge the revenues to secure and pay bonds issued or incurred by the governing board in accordance with law;\n\n(2) cause the bonds to constitute a debt of the state or be payable from the full faith and credit of the state;\n\n(3) change the character of the revenues as separate revenue of the institution collecting the revenue; or\n\n(4) cause the revenue to be considered general revenue for purposes of Sections 17 and 18, Article VII, Texas Constitution.\n\nActs 1971, 62nd Leg., p. 3072, ch. 1024, art. 1, Sec. 1, eff.

A deposit to the unclaimed money fund does not affect the ownership of the amount deposited. The institution shall:\n\n(1) adopt procedures for owners to make and receive payments of claims against the fund; and\n\n(2) maintain a database that permits members of the public to search for ownership of unclaimed funds.\n\n(c) The institution of higher education shall use the fund to pay the claims of persons establishing ownership of amounts transferred to the fund and shall hold and account for the unclaimed money fund as educational and general funds of the institution. If the fund balance is insufficient to pay a valid claim, the institution shall pay the claim from the institution's other educational and general funds.\n\n(d) Each fiscal year, after deducting funds sufficient to pay anticipated expenses of and claims against the unclaimed money fund, the institution shall use the balance of the fund as other educational and general funds of the institution.\n\n(e) In consultation with institutions of higher education, the comptroller by rule may establish minimum requirements for notice to owners of unclaimed money deposited in the unclaimed money fund and for charges for that notice. The rules may not provide stricter requirements than the comptroller applies for amounts of less than $25 in the custody of the comptroller under Chapter 74, Property Code.\n\n(f) If an institution of higher education maintains an unclaimed money fund under this section, Chapter 74, Property Code, does not apply to a credit balance to which this section applies.\n\nAdded by Acts 2011, 82nd Leg., R.S., Ch. 1049 (S.B. 5), Sec. 1.02, eff.

The legislature finds that higher education is vitally important to the welfare, if not the survival, of Texas and the United States at this stage in history and that the quality of higher education is dependent upon the quality of college and university faculties. The legislature finds, therefore, that money spent on recognized means for producing an excellent system of public higher education is money spent to serve a public purpose of great importance. The legislature finds further that a sound program of faculty development leaves of absence designed to enable the faculty member to engage in study, research, writing, and similar projects for the purpose of adding to the knowledge available to himself, his students, his institution, and society generally is a well-recognized means for improving a state's program of public higher education. The legislature's purpose in establishing the faculty development leave program provided for by this subchapter is to improve further the higher education available to the youth at the state-supported colleges and universities and to establish this program of faculty development leaves as part of the plan of compensation for the faculty of these colleges and universities.\n\nActs 1971, 62nd Leg., p. 3072, ch. 1024, art. 1, Sec. 1, eff.

The agreement must be reviewed at least annually by the institution and the municipality and may be modified at that time by a written agreement signed by each party.

If a campus peace officer elects to appeal the institution's action to an independent third party hearing examiner under this section, the officer or institution may appeal the examiner's decision to a district court only as provided by Subsection (j).\n\n(d) If a campus peace officer elects to appeal to a hearing examiner, the officer and the head of the institution's law enforcement agency or their designees shall attempt to agree on the selection of an impartial hearing examiner. If the parties do not agree on the selection of a hearing examiner before the 10th day after the date the appeal is filed, the parties immediately shall request a list of seven qualified neutral arbitrators from the American Arbitration Association or the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, or their successors in function. The officer and the agency head or their designees may agree on one of the seven neutral arbitrators on the list. If the parties do not agree before the fifth business day after the date the parties receive the list, the parties or their designees shall alternate striking a name from the list, and the single name remaining after all other names have been struck is selected as the hearing examiner.

If the hearing examiner cannot begin the hearing before the 45th day after the date of selection, the campus peace officer may, within 48 hours after learning of that fact, call for the selection of a new hearing examiner using the procedure prescribed by Subsection (d).\n\n(f) In a hearing conducted under this section, the hearing examiner has the same duties and powers that a civil service commission has in conducting a hearing or hearing an appeal under Chapter 143, Local Government Code, including the right to issue subpoenas. The hearing examiner may:\n\n(1) order that the campus peace officer be reinstated to the same position or status in which the officer was employed immediately before the demotion, suspension, or termination or, in the case of a promotional bypass, to the position or status with respect to which the officer experienced the bypass; and\n\n(2) award the officer lost wages and any other compensation lost as a result of the disciplinary action or promotional bypass, as applicable.\n\n(g) In a hearing conducted under this section, the parties may agree to an expedited hearing procedure. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, in an expedited procedure the hearing examiner shall issue a decision on the appeal not later than the 10th day after the date the hearing is completed.\n\n(h) In an appeal that does not involve an expedited hearing procedure, the hearing examiner shall make a reasonable effort to issue a decision on the appeal not later than the 30th day after the later of the date the hearing is completed or the briefs are filed. The hearing examiner's inability to meet the time requirements imposed by this section does not affect the hearing examiner's jurisdiction, the validity of the disciplinary action or promotional bypass, or the hearing examiner's final decision.\n\n(i) The hearing examiner's fees and expenses shall be paid in equal amounts by the parties. The costs of a witness shall be paid by the party who calls the witness.\n\n(j) A district court may hear an appeal of a hearing examiner's decision only on the grounds that the hearing examiner was without jurisdiction or exceeded the examiner's jurisdiction or that the decision was procured by fraud, collusion, or other unlawful means. An appeal must be brought in the district court having jurisdiction in the municipality in which the institution is located.\n\nAdded by Acts 2007, 80th Leg., R.S., Ch. 258 (S.B. 11), Sec. 15.02, eff.
