        "text": "\"After three years in ministry, I knew that I loved what I was doing, but I was also deeply aware that I needed to immerse myself more in biblical and theological study. I have loved my time at Regent—so much in fact, that I’m considering pursuing further graduate studies, while still planning to be ordained in the Anglican church. I am certain that no matter what I do, I will continue to serve Christ and to minister in his church.\"\n\nMichael Chase (MDiv 2013), Canada\n\n\"I came to Regent at a crossroads in my life: newly married, unsatisfied with my job, and in search of a calling. Beginning with the diploma program and now continuing into a master’s, I’ve learned how to thoughtfully, generously, and fruitfully engage with the world, through a truer understanding of God and myself, alongside classmates and teachers with similar intentions. My plan for the future is still a work in progress, but I already know that this time has been foundational for my vocation, my family, and my faith.\"\n\nLucas Lee (MATS 2015), Canada,\n\n\"Regent has been a truly life-transforming experience. It has provided me with an environment in which to wrestle with deep questions, not only in the classroom but also with classmates, and opened me up to the vast world of Christian faith and theology. I am grateful for the opportunity to establish a firm foundation on which to keep building for the rest of my life.\"\n\nNicholas Overton (MATS 2013), Australia, Political Lobbyist/Advocate"
