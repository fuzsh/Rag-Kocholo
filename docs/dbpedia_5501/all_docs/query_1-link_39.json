He has been serving with FUGE Camps in various roles since 2005, serving as a camp pastor since 2009.

Known for their high energy, and passion, AMB constantly seeks to point others to Christ through their music and lives. Seeking to tear down the divide that seems to have been made between the stage and the seats, AMB can be found in every aspect of camp. Austin Miller Band has had the opportunity to partner with Lifeway to lead worship for FUGE Camps both as a full summer band and now as contract musicians. They have also had the opportunity to play for many events from kids camps, to DNOWs, to college retreats, and much more. Front man, Austin Miller, serves as Worship Director at Hope Community Church in Shelby, NC. He understands the importance of youth ministry and desires to see students experience the freedom that comes in Christ. Be on the lookout for music from AMB that serves the Church and that reaches those far from God that they may experience Hope in God.
