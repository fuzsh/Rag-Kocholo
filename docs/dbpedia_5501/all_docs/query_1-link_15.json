The city is part of the larger metropolitan areas where you’ll discover a wealth of attractions and activities. Enjoy the diversity of quiet parks and vibrant downtowns, as well as cultural offerings from opera and art shows to festivals and concerts.\n\nLearn\n\nRegular Lunch & Learns offer a convenient opportunity for faculty and staff to relax, connect and gain information on subjects such as investments and financial planning, health and fitness, home buying, personal development, and innovation. Our Center for Teaching & Learning gives faculty robust opportunities for professional development and custom training.

Our diversity is another of our greatest strengths, with students, faculty and staff coming from many cultural and denominational backgrounds. We ranked #3 for safety according to NICHE 2016 and place great emphasis on campus security.\n\nAt Regent, you’ll find a place to grow your faith alongside your career. Weekly university chapel, as well as regular visits from renowned speakers, provides instruction and encouragement.
