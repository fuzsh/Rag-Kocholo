        "text": "I transferred to Regent after receiving my Associate's from Tidewater Community College. I normally don't write reviews, but I had to write this one after reading the other reviews. After I retired from the military I went to work overseas as a security and training contractor. I was gone so much and so often that my only option was to take classes online. There were a couple of classes in my degree field (Government/Pre-Law) that were offered on campus only, which caused me to skip a couple of deployments,... Read More which cost me a LOT of money - in no way do I blame Regent for this situation. I opted for the accelerated program where the semesters were 8 weeks instead of 16 weeks. The work was rigorous and challenging. I must say that one of the things I learned was how to manage my time and how to prepare for my classes so I could complete the reading and writing assignments on time. When I was overseas there were times when there were internet outages that caused me to be late for submissions; my professors were understanding and accommodated me. When the time came for my Senior Thesis (a 25-page paper), I was deployed overseas and there was no way I could come to the college. My professor had me open a Youtube channel and send her the link in Private setting, and record myself discussing my paper! And then when I was only a class or two from graduating, I had to take a class that was offered EVERY OTHER YEAR, and when I had to take it, it was the off year - and I was deployed overseas. I wrote to the Department Chair and explained that I would have to wait a whole year to take the class and graduate, was there anything that can be done? He opened a special 'audit' session just for me and a couple of other students for which we could get credit! The military advisors: My only experience with them is in-person. I would call and make an appointment, show up, and get the information I needed. They gave me their cards to call their direct number, and with a couple of exceptions when they were out of the office, they were either available to help me or returned my calls promptly. NO, Regent University is not \"praise Jesus all day every day in every class.\" Regent University is a Christian-based university that requires a Biblically-oriented take on classes, with Scriptural references. The Biblical thing was disclosed up front and very clearly, so that's what I did. I included Biblical verses in my written posts and papers, and discussed how they applied to my assignment. I interacted with plenty of classmates who did not, but I don't know whether they were penalized or not. If somebody doesn't agree with being required to include Biblical stuff in their work, then don't include it and accept the possible academic hit, or pick another school. After I graduated I enrolled in the Career Switcher program for teacher preparation. Professor Whiting was absolutely the best in accommodating my overseas schedule and managing the program. The one thing that I DID NOT like about Regent is that when I registered for my first two classes nobody informed me that classes opened a week before the actual advertised start date. I checked two weeks early, nothing. 10 days early, nothing. So, I waited until the night before to check in, and !voila! assignments were posted 7 days out from the beginning! I was already a week behind in my reading and writing assignments, and there was no way I could catch up. By the middle of the first week, all the reading and most of the posts should already be completed, and reading for the second week's assignments should be well underway. I got a 'D' in Modern Political Philosophy - which is an automatic re-take - and... AND, the GI Bill clawed their money back, and I had to pay for the re-take out of my own pocket - and I got a VERY generous 'C' in Research Methods. Professor Chup in the Philosophy class actually called me up. He kept me on the phone for about 30 minutes trying his best to engage me on the subject matter so he could give me a passing grade, but I was not up to it. My GPA was shot to hell right out of the gate. I had to make an appearance to my academic advisor. As I explained the problem he sat up straight in his chair and took notes. Then I assured him it would not happen again. I squared myself away and got organized, and graduated with a 3.66 GPA.\n\nRead Less\n\nI'll start this review by explaining that I am Active Duty military and all of my classes my be approved in AFVEC and funded by tuition assistance through the base education office. Regent University is not my first school, I completed three years of consistent, online education and had none of the issues that I am about to blame on Regent. Avoid this school at all costs if you are Active Duty military I have been active duty for 19 years. I have pursued higher education via online college since... Read More 2017. I changed degree paths and schools to Regent university in Feb/March 2022 (theological and Biblical studies).My previous online university did not once give me an issue over a span of five years. I cannot explain the amount of stress that Regent puts on a person that is active duty, there is nothing simple about being active duty and getting classes approved and paid for at Regent. 1st - Regent only has two military advisors....at all. Most recently, I sent multiple emails and I spent more than 4 hours on hold attempting to get in touch with anyone to help me with billing and registration issues. Finally I called the general support number and told them about my experience and they assured me that they had sent the military advising dept. an email and that they would call me at specified time, I never received a call or a response to the emails; I did however receive an email from Regent stating they are dropping me from classes for failure to pay; pay for classes I haven't even taken. More explanation in the next point. 2nd - Regent expects you to pay $1400 a quarter to be an online student, even if you don't take any classes. They sent me the email I referenced above; the email states that I haven't paid my $1,400 a semester so they are dropping me...I haven't been able to register for a class due to Regent's inability to keep up with their students and their failure to reach back out to me. Tuition assistance does not pay by semester but by class. Every single tuition assistance request I sent to Regent I also had to send them proof that I am still active duty. Tuition assistance does not cover the cost of one class at Regent. I owe money for each class that I take and I must pay out of pocket. They say that you get book vouchers to make up for this, but, the online book store marks up books by over 100% in some cases, the only way to afford the books on the \"book voucher\" is to buy an access code to them in an online library. So you are forced to purchase an e-version of the book. 3rd - I had transcripts sent to Regent in March of 2022, its now October of 2022 and my student records have no been updated. Base Education has informed me that due to Regent not updating my transcript, they will no longer approve tuition assistance for Regent university. So not only is Regent saying they will drop me for non payment by base education (tuition assistance), base education states they will not approve any classes at Regent until they update my transcripts. Catch 22?! I have called relentlessly, I have emailed persistently and waited patiently and Regent has been the absolute worst experience of any school I've attended in my adult life. The curriculum is not bad, the instructors I had the pleasure of studying under are amazing but I will never recommend anyone using tuition assistance, or transferring from another school attend Regent.\n\nRead Less\n\nWhere do I begin? I was an online student in the MDiv program, and it was the worst experience of my life. Each class is crammed into 8 weeks when it's clear most classes were meant to take a semester. When I asked for extensions on my assignments, I was never granted enough time, because there are no breaks between terms, and I had to finish my makeup work in addition to my new classes. There was never enough time. The school advertises its online courses as convenient, but it hasn't actually been... Read More designed for that. Most classes require large research papers (sometimes even 2!) on top of other weekly requirements. I was even refused an extension for a class that I just couldn't keep up with and was told that I had to retake the class and redo all of the same assignments I had already completed. They said it had to do with FAFSA, but when I called FAFSA, they had no idea what I was talking about. Additionally, the school is very conservative politically. The college operates on an extremely close-minded mentality. Not every professor, but it is very evident among the leadership and administration. Different opinions are rarely if ever, allowed or encouraged. I felt deeply discouraged as I was predominantly being taught \"worldview\" structures over knowing Jesus more. There was also an ongoing issue with my transcripts. It seems many Advising and Admissions staff aren't properly trained because I was misinformed about my transcripts so many times that I lost count. I was also lied to outright about my enrollment status and how that would affect Financial Aid. I wasn't told about the mistake until 6 months later, and it was far too late to do anything about it by then. Finally, I was actually removed from the system twice. I was granted extensions to finish coursework and ended up making all A's, but their system is so broken that it registered my extensions as failed classes. I was actually dropped from the university because of this lack of communication between departments, which was then reported to FAFSA and nearly ruined my future plans to continue my studies. Someone eventually helped me get back on, but it was too late to start class in the Spring, my family and I were left with no compensation at all. None of my complaints mattered as almost every single person I spoke to placed all the blame on me. I was insulted and shouted at by administrators in Advising and Admissions and was told by a senior member of the complaints process that I was a problem student because I had the \"audacity\" to complain. I was also told by Advising that studying an MDiv to prepare for ministry is actually pointless and then hung up on me. A terrible school. They are condescending to anyone who has a complaint or doesn't outwardly agree with every stance they take politically. The Spiritual Formations professors (I only had 2 of them before I left), were great, but the rest of the Divinity professors actively choose favorite students, actively discourage dissenting opinions, and speak about stress and anxiety as side-effects of bad Christians.\n\nRead Less\n\nA GARBAGE SCHOOL Nothing but a nightmare from the get go. For registration, they had several boxes to check in one section regarding financial aid. There was no spot to check VOC REHAB. Therefore, I couldn´t register. Over 15 phone calls and emails and no corrective action taken, yet daily, I was bombarded with register or you won´t get in this semester. I finally sent a heated reply and as I found out is typical when you point out their abject failures, \"Yo aren´t a good Christian.\" I accepted that... Read More I would have to take some classes on Christianity, but thought the other classes would focus on academics. Nope. Praise Jesus, all day, every day, every class. The VA said they were the only college they had ever dealt with that gave them so many problems with payment for textbooks. Wound up having to pay out of pocket and then wait to be repaid by the VA and thats not a minor expense. On top of that, carrying a straight A average, I was unable to log in to my classes after week 3 without IT support each time. They still haven´t fixed the problem and there is no way I will continue with these clowns. Neither have they rolled over my credits from my previous college in weeks. A complete trash school. I went to a brick and mortar college in the 90s. Excellent. American Military University online in 2012. Very good school. Always on the Dean´s List etc. This \"college\" is an utter sham and they are deceitful as hell while thumping the bible. They exemplify why I don´t go to church even though I believe in God and pray daily. RUN!\n\nRead Less\n\nI am an online student. Regent University, where to start? I am currently a Senior at Regent; I am using VA Vocational Rehabilitation Chapter 31. I will start with the military aspect of the school. I am not sure if it is my Voc Rehab counselor fault or the school's military advisors, but 90 credits later, I am still paying for books while both sides claim the other is at fault. I have missed semester check-in twice due to slow billing. It was a good thing they held my classes. I currently have a... Read More GPA of 3.5, and my GPA in my major classes is 3.7, but I have no idea how to be a Paralegal. Why? Because I am required to spend more time researching scripture and applying scripture to my lessons than learning about the job itself. I understood that going to a Christian school that my education would incorporate scripture, but to the extend that Regent does it, is insane. To read the Bible for the first time and not be over experienced in the Bible makes this task daunting and nearly impossible. I have spent more time reading the Bible and using it as an encyclopedia than reading my class books and studying for tests. If not for the pain, I would have transferred out of this school to find a school to accept all my credits AND have my Voc Rehab counselor agree to it. Regent offers tons of accredited degrees that can be obtained online but save yourself some hassle and go somewhere else. There is a reason that over 25% of students transfer out of this school. It is great they help people connect to God, but they do so at the expense of knowledge and education in the career field the student wants to learn. I feel cheated on my future degree. I am glad I am not paying for it.\n\nRead Less\n\nThe MBA program at Regent was a horrible experience, especially if you plan on using military benefits. There are hardly any on-campus classes, and only online classes available during the summer, so youll rarely receive your full housing allowance. If I had known this, I would have gone to ODU instead. The courses are only 8 weeks long, which may sound great, but they assign a months worth of work in 2 weeks. You learn nothing of value at the end of your 8 weeks because youre just rushing to get... Read More work done. The summer sessions overlap so your struggling to finish work in one class while starting another. Additionally, many of the professors seem to be on some kind of power trip. They use intimidation and fear to get what they want, acting as if they are all powerful, and every allowance provided is a special gift. If you question anything, or debate a teacher on a grade or assignment, then youre called ungrateful. Professors are slow to respond, dont show up to class at all, or send you important messages using methods that you receive no notification for. This doesnt work for a program that should be designed for working adults, military, or people with families. No one actually teaches you unless you get an on-campus class. For online classes, you spend thousands of dollars to teach yourself things you dont know anything about. You spend hundreds on required books that you never even use, or only use once. There is the rare great professor, but theyre hard to to find. The advisors are a piece of work. You call and leave a message and no one gets back to you. You send a direct email and you get no response. You finally get someone and they dont even give you the right answers, or make you take more classes than youre supposed to. For a Christian school, they dont seem to have many Christian values.\n\nRead Less"
