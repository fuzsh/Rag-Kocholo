        "text": "All students at RU are expected to adhere to the University’s alcohol and drug policies found within the University’s Standard of Personal Conduct in the Student Handbook. These policies are as follows:\n\n5.2.2. Alcohol, Drugs, Tobacco and other Smoking or Smokeless Products:\n\n5.2.2.1. The Bible calls us to a sober mind and sound judgment. The University requires that members of the Regent community—faculty, staff and students—refrain from the illegal use of drugs and the abuse of addictive substances controlled by law. Consistent with this policy, the use, possession, manufacture, distribution or sale of illegal drugs or drug paraphernalia is prohibited. The University has zero tolerance for the illegal use of drugs and the abuse of addictive substances controlled by law. Students with a valid prescription for controlled medications are permitted to possess and use those medications on campus. The misuse, sale, or distribution of prescription medications is prohibited.\n\n5.2.2.2. In keeping with a call to a sober mind and sound judgment, Regent also forbids the use, consumption, possession, cultivation, distribution, or sale of alcohol, tobacco, marijuana or other controlled substances on University premises, including University housing, at any official function, any event supported by Regent University funds or any event identified with or directly linked to the University. Non-tobacco and nicotine alternative smoking products, such as nicotine vapor products, are also prohibited. The Apostle Paul exhorts the body of Christ that, if they truly loved their fellow man, they would set aside personal freedom by refraining from behavior that might be a stumbling block to weaker brethren. Regent University encourages members of the Regent community to exercise personal responsibility and, guided by Paul’s admonition, appropriately set aside personal freedom and refrain from the use of alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana.\n\n5.2.2.3. Any use of alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, or controlled substances that results in a criminal violation, e.g., drunken driving, public nuisance, disorderly conduct, possession use of these substances by a minor, etc., is considered a substance abuse violation and will be dealt with through the disciplinary process, whether or not the student is charged with or convicted of a crime. Depending on context, a violation of this policy can also be a violation of the Hazing policy (see section 5.2.9.).\n\n5.2.2.4. Any incident that occurs as a result of the use of alcohol, marijuana, or other controlled substances that, in the judgment of the University administration, reflects negatively on the image of the University or disrupts the campus’ learning or living environment, will be considered a violation of the Standard of Personal Conduct and shall be dealt with accordingly. In some instances, violations could result in removal from student housing or suspension or dismissal from the University.\n\nDisciplinary Sanctions\n\nRegent University will impose disciplinary sanctions on students for violations of these standards of conduct. Students who violate the alcohol or drug policies and/or are discovered to be abusing these substances are provided with and/or required to receive counseling, substance abuse education and other holistic support. Repetitive or severe violations of the University’s substance policies can result in a student being suspended or dismissed as well as referred to authorities for prosecution where appropriate. Sanctions for drug and alcohol violations will be consistent with Federal, state, and local laws and ordinances. Students who proactively seek support from the University for substance abuse are addressed from a redemptive approach, where appropriate, and includes counseling, accountability and other appropriate treatment. Sanctions are issued at the discretion of the University. The University, at its sole discretion, reserves the right to adjust sanctions issued to students based on the nature of a violation. Sanctions for drug and alcohol violations can include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nUse, Possession, Consumption, Distribution, Sale, Cultivation of Alcohol, Tobacco & Marijuana or other Smoking or Smokeless Products (inclusive of e-cigarettes, vaping, etc.)\n\n1st Offense: $100 fine, Housing and/or University probation for a minimum of one semester. In addition, students under the age of 21 will receive have a conduct letter sent to a parent or guardian. Educational sanctions may also be issued at the discretion of the University.\n\n2nd Offense: $150 fine, required counseling with two-way release, and housing/University suspension or dismissal depending on the severity of the violation. In addition, students under the age of 21 will receive have a conduct letter sent to a parent or guardian. Educational sanctions may also be issued at the discretion of the University.\n\n3rd Offense: Permanent dismissal and banned from campus indefinitely.\n\nOther Drugs (including, but not limited to, crack, cocaine, heroin, meth, etc., including abuse of prescription drugs)\n\n1st Offense: University suspension for a minimum of two semesters, parental notification if under 21, required counseling with two-way release, letter from counselor speaking to student’s personal growth, renewal, transformation, etc. and readiness to return to the University, $150 fine and University probation for full academic year or more upon return.\n\n2nd Offense: Permanent dismissal and banned from campus indefinitely.\n\nAlcohol and Drug Prevention Event and Programs\n\nAll students, both online and on-campus, are educated about the University’s alcohol abuse and drug policies through in-person and/or virtual orientation programs that detail the University’s alcohol and drug policies along with the possible sanctions/consequences that can result from violating these policies. Student leaders that work in the residence halls (i.e. Resident Assistants & Life Group Leaders) as well as student athletes participate in annual trainings which include alcohol and drug education. On-campus departments, such as the Psychological Services Center (PSC) and Student Engagement, facilitate annual events on-campus that promote alcohol and drug abuse education. Some of these student events include:"
