        "text": "Critical insight and very thought-provoking thank you Richard Lemuel Sewell! However, LinkedIn readers please ask yourself a few questions before and after reading my repost: 1) Did you know? 2) Did you want to know? 3) Now that you know‚Ä¶What difference does it make to you? It‚Äôs amazing how American educational institutions determine what information is omitted and/or included in the curriculum used to teach ‚Äúall of our‚Äù students. How many educators understand the need, importance, and impact of Critical Race Theory (CRT) in our institutions of higher learning OR the importance of teaching African and ‚ÄúBlack‚Äù history is American history in secondary education? Does this or can it impact the dynamics of intrapersonal, interpersonal, institution and structural communication or even change the trajectory of race relations in our society? The omission of critical truths (good, bad, ugly and indifferent) has created false narratives in our society about an entire race of people with devasting implications‚Ä¶Did you know? Now what?\n\nüéì Earning a doctorate is a journey filled with immense challenges and profound sacrifices. The strain on one's mental health is significant, and the right academic environment can make all the difference. Selecting the right institution and dissertation team, particularly your Chair, is crucial to maintaining your sanity and successfully completing your degree. Trusting that your leaders are genuinely guiding you towards building a lasting legacy is vital. From personal experience, I can attest that organizational trauma is real and deeply impacts students' daily lives. As we navigate graduation season, I am working to reclaim my power and focus on the valuable lessons learned, rather than the frustration I've endured. For anyone feeling betrayed, enraged, or unsupported during your dissertation journey, you're not alone. This is precisely why I founded the R.E.L.E.A.S.E Support Group‚Äîto provide a community where your experiences are acknowledged and your feelings validated. If you're in need of support, DM me for an invitation. Let‚Äôs navigate these challenges together. I tell myself often, stop suffering alone.

I hope that you will suffer betrayal because that will teach you the importance of loyalty. Sorry to say, but I hope you will be lonely from time to time so that you don‚Äôt take friends for granted. I wish you bad luck, again, from time to time so that you will be conscious of the role of chance in life and understand that your success is not completely deserved and that the failure of others is not completely deserved either. And when you lose, as you will from time to time, I hope every now and then, your opponent will gloat over your failure. It is a way for you to understand the importance of sportsmanship. I hope you‚Äôll be ignored so you know the importance of listening to others, and I hope you will have just enough pain to learn compassion. Whether I wish these things or not, they‚Äôre going to happen. And whether you benefit from them or not will depend upon your ability to see the message in your misfortunes.‚Äù Link:\n\nThis Juneteenth, we commemorate the end of slavery in the United States and celebrate liberty and education for all. AWPT understands the invaluable role education plays in achievement and success, and today, we reflect on the importance of education in the history of emancipation in America. According to the National Museum of African American History and Culture, ‚ÄúFor the nearly four million, mostly illiterate and recently freed African Americans, education was a crucial first step, after emancipation, to becoming self-sufficient. Learning to read was not only desirable, it was oftentimes necessary to protect freedoms, find employment, and communicate with separated family members.‚Äù To learn more about Juneteenth, visit https://lnkd.in/gqvPZFF."
