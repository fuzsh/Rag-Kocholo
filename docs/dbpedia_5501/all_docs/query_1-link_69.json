        "text": "The University of Minnesota (University) is committed to investing in its employees and fostering a culture of excellence. The Regents Tuition Benefit Program (Program) provides eligible employees access to University credit-bearing education opportunities at a reduced tuition cost. This Program is an employee benefit offered by the University.\n\nThe Program covers:\n\n100% of the tuition cost for eligible employees pursuing their first baccalaureate degree and who are admitted into a University baccalaureate program.\n\n75% of the tuition cost for eligible employees enrolled in all other courses or degrees covered under the Program.\n\nEligible employees must be enrolled in the University's credit-bearing courses for which registration requirements have been met. Employees may take courses at any University campus as the Program is not restricted to their primary work location. If an eligible employee is seeking a degree, they must follow the policies, requirements, and procedures of the college in which they are enrolled and will only be awarded a degree in programs where they have been formally admitted.\n\nEmployee Eligibility\n\nThe Program is available to faculty, P&A, civil service and labor represented employees who hold appointments of at least 75 percent time.\n\nEmployees on approved leaves of absence from qualifying appointments, including sabbatical or professional development leaves, may use this program.\n\nEmployees on academic year appointments may use this program for summer session courses if they were employed the preceding spring term and they will be employed the following fall term.\n\nWith the required approval, former eligible civil service and labor represented employees who are on the layoff list have access to the Program, but are limited to two courses per term.\n\nExcluded from coverage under this policy are graduate assistants, professionals-in-training, employees of affiliate organizations, and family members and/or dependents of employees.\n\nCosts Covered\n\nThe Program applies only to tuition costs. Non-tuition fees are not covered, including but not limited to books and course materials, supplemental material fees, course fees, technology fees, collegiate fees, late payment fees. Tuition and non-tuition fees are billed to the employee's student receivable account. Employees who are not Minnesota residents will have a non-resident tuition waiver included with their tuition benefits.\n\nThe University manages and funds this program at the University level. Departments may not use any additional University funding including non-sponsored, private, public, noncurrent, discretionary, professional development and/or departmental scholarship or grant funds to cover the employee contribution portion of the tuition cost.\n\nIn specific situations where a department requests or requires the employee to enroll in a particular University course, it may be permissible for the department to pay the tuition cost in full as a professional development business expense but not in conjunction with the Program. Refer to Administrative Policy: Business Expenses for guidance on this type of expense allowability.\n\nEligible Courses\n\nCourses Covered\n\nThis program covers credit bearing courses offered for academic credit that appear on a University transcript.\n\nCredit bearing courses not covered under this program include study abroad courses offered through the Learning Abroad Center (Twin Cities) or individual campuses.\n\nIt is the prerogative of the University to restrict the coverage of additional programs/courses not currently addressed in this policy.\n\nLocal units and departments may choose to allocate funds toward non-covered courses. Units may not augment funds for courses where tuition benefits are provided by the Program.\n\nTaxation of Benefit\n\nThe value of this benefit may be taxable income to the employee. Employees are responsible for understanding tax consequences prior to enrolling. See the Appendix: Tax Implications of Regents Tuition Benefit Program for more information.\n\nTiming and Approval\n\nEmployees should submit the Request for Regents Tuition Benefit Program form prior to the first day of the term. Late submissions are not guaranteed to be covered under the Program.\n\nEmployees are expected to have a discussion with their supervisor if they are interested in taking any class or class component (e.g., lab or discussion) at the same time as their work schedule or hours. Supervisors are expected to discuss work schedules and accommodations for classes that occur during regular work schedules. Supervisors need to indicate whether or not they approve this time away; but if a request is denied, rationale for this denial must be shared with the employee and indicated on the Request for Regents Tuition Benefit Program form. Any time away must be administered in accordance with rules, laws or labor agreements under which the employee is governed.\n\nThe Senior Director for Total Rewards may grant an exception to this policy and associated procedure under rare and unusual circumstances, provided the exception remains consistent with Board of Regents policy. Any exceptions granted will be documented in writing."
