        "text": "UT Dallas Policy Navigator :: Student Code of Conduct :: UTDSP5003 (v7)\n\nStudent Code of Conduct - UTDSP5003\n\nPolicy Statement\n\nSection A. General Provisions\n\nSubsection 1: Purpose\n\nPursuant to the Regents Rules, the University of Texas at Dallas (UT Dallas) has developed its policy regarding student conduct and discipline in accordance with The University of Texas System (UT System) model policy. Each student is charged with notice and knowledge of and compliance with the contents and provisions thereof. Reporting to the Dean of Students, the Office of Community Standards and Conduct seeks to support the mission of The University of Texas at Dallas by promoting integrity, civility, and community on campus. Recognizing that students make mistakes, we strive to help them acknowledge their personal responsibilities as members of the University community through fairly and consistently upholding the Student Code of Conduct. By doing so, we help bring student actions into congruence with the expectations set forth by the University while challenging them to demonstrate ethical decision making and personal integrity.\n\nAs members of the UT Dallas community, all students are expected to uphold the Comet Creed: As a Comet, I pledge honesty, integrity, and service in all that I do. Additionally, students are required to obey federal, state, and local laws and to comply with UT System and University rules and regulations.\n\nThe conduct review process is an administrative process and meant to be educational in nature. This process is separate from and may be carried out prior to, simultaneously with, or following civil or criminal proceedings. Outcomes including finding of responsibility and sanctions shall not be subject to change because of criminal or civil outcomes.\n\nSubsection 2: Scope\n\nThis policy applies to student organizations as well as individual students. Student organizations are accountable for the conduct and actions of their members.\n\nAn individual who is not currently enrolled as a University student remains subject to the disciplinary process for conduct that occurred while a student. Each student shall be responsible for their conduct from the time of application for admission through the actual awarding of a degree even when the conduct occurs prior to the beginning of classes and in between semesters. This includes conduct that is discovered after the awarding of a degree.\n\nA student is accountable for conduct that occurs on or off campus. University officials will review off-campus conduct pursuant to this policy. Factors considered in determining when to initiate a formal investigation for off campus conduct include, but are not limited to, whether the conduct impairs, interferes with, or obstructs any institutional activity or the mission, processes, and functions of the institution and whether the conduct adversely affects University interests.\n\nSubsection 3: Definitions\n\nUnless the context requires a different meaning, the definitions following apply to this policy.\n\nA \"day\" means Monday through Friday except for days on which the University is officially closed or when regularly scheduled classes are suspended due to emergency situations.\n\n\"Dean\" means Dean of Students and refers to the administrative officer or officers responsible for the administration of the disciplinary process. The Dean of Students may designate individual(s) to administer disciplinary cases under this policy.\n\n\"Vice President\" means the Vice President for Student Affairs or the Vice President for Student Affairs' designee.\n\nA \"student\" means a person enrolled or formerly enrolled at the University and is eligible to continue enrollment in the semester or summer session that follows; a person accepted for admission or readmission to the University; a person who engaged in prohibited conduct at a time when he or she met any of the prior.\n\n\"University\" or \"institution\" means The University of Texas at Dallas.\n\n\"UT System\" means The University of Texas System.\n\n\"University rule\" means a rule, a regulation, a policy, or instruction contained in the University's Handbook of Operating Procedures or other official University publication or document.\n\n\"Discipline Committee\" means individuals selected in accordance with procedures adopted by the University pursuant to the recommendation of the Vice President for Student Affairs to hear disciplinary charges, make findings of fact, and, upon a finding of responsibility, impose the appropriate sanction(s).\n\n\"Campus\" consists of all real property, buildings, or facilities owned or controlled by UT Dallas.\n\n\"Faculty\" means any tenured or non-tenured, full or part-time instructor whose responsibility includes teaching.\n\n\"Hearing advisor\" means the individual who is responsible for oversight of administrative duties during or prior to the hearing.\n\n\"Complainant\" is defined as The University of Texas at Dallas or the person making a referral to the Dean.\n\n\"Respondent\" is defined as the student or student group alleged to have violated the Student Code of Conduct.\n\n\"Sanction\" is a consequence imposed in response to a violation of University rules, policies or procedures.\n\n\"May\" is used in the permissive sense.\n\n\"Shall\", \"must\", \"should\", and \"will\" are used in the imperative sense.\n\n\"Hearing Panel\" or \"Hearing Officer\" refers to individuals selected from the pool of faculty, staff, and student members of the Discipline Committee to participate in individual hearings.\n\n\"Staff\" means non-faculty employees of the University.\n\n\"Student organization\" means enrolled students who make up a common interest group that may or may not be registered through the Student Organization Center, sponsored by a campus school or department, or who officially represent the University.\n\nA \"witness\" means someone who may have information related to an alleged violation of this policy.\n\nAn \"advisor\" is a person who provides support to the student(s) throughout the conduct process. An advisor may be an attorney. The advisor may only confer with and advise a student. The advisor may not verbally advocate to the Dean or Hearing Panel/Hearing Officer on behalf of a student.\n\nSubsection 4: Confidentiality of Disciplinary Process\n\nIn accordance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA), a student's disciplinary files are considered \"educational records.\" These records are confidential and may only be accessed by the student, the Dean, or University officials with legitimate educational interests and as otherwise provided by law.\n\nIn cases involving student conduct, the Dean will notify the referring individual of the outcome of a disciplinary process as necessary for the referring individual to perform their duties and as permitted by law. In cases of academic dishonesty, the Dean will promptly notify the appropriate faculty member regarding the outcome of the disciplinary process so that the outcome may be properly recorded. In either case, the Dean will notify other appropriate University officials as necessary and as permitted by law.\n\nSection B. Administration of Discipline\n\nSubsection 5: Dean of Students\n\nThe Dean has primary authority and responsibility for the administration of student discipline.\n\nIt shall be the Dean's responsibility to investigate allegations that a student has violated a Regents' Rule, University rule, or any provision of federal, state, and/or local laws, with the exception of the Sexual Misconduct Policy [UTDBP3102] and some cases of discrimination [UTDBP3090].\n\nIn carrying out these responsibilities, the Dean works cooperatively with academic administrators and faculty members in the disposition of academic dishonesty and with staff members in Residential Life in the disposition of campus housing violations. The Dean may seek, as needed, additional information from individuals who have expertise relative to cases, especially in instances of academic dishonesty involving technical material, projects, or assignments.\n\nSubsection 6: Faculty Role in Academic Violations\n\nJudgments of academic dishonesty are distinguished from academic judgments concerning whether a student has or has not completed an assignment as required. The former involve considerations of misconduct and sanctioning and are the responsibility of the Dean.\n\nUnder authority delegated by the Dean, a faculty member who has reason to suspect that a student has engaged in academic dishonesty may conduct a conference with the student in compliance with the following procedures:\n\nthe student may be informed that they are believed to have committed an act or acts of academic dishonesty in violation of the Student Code of Conduct;\n\nthe student may be presented with any information in the knowledge or possession of the instructor which tends to support the allegation(s) of academic dishonesty;\n\nthe student will be given an opportunity to present information on their behalf;\n\nafter meeting with the student, the faculty member may:\n\nchoose not to refer the allegation(s) if it is determined that the allegation(s) are not supported by the evidence; or,\n\nrefer the allegation(s) to the Dean on the electronic referral form and attach all supporting documentation of the alleged violation. The faculty member is given the opportunity to suggest a recommended sanction or remedy to be applied on the electronic referral form; however, final sanction decisions are made by the Dean of Students or Hearing Panel Chair/Hearing Officer that are appropriate for the circumstances;\n\nthe faculty member must not impose any independent sanctions upon the student in lieu of a referral to the Dean.\n\nIt is important that referrals are submitted within a reasonable time period; generally within one week after the alleged incident.\n\nIf the faculty member chooses not to meet with the student, they must forward the appropriate documentation to the Dean. The faculty member is encouraged to inform the student of the allegation(s) and notify the student that the information has been forwarded to the Dean for investigation.\n\nUpon receipt of the referral form and supporting material/documentation from the faculty member, the Dean shall proceed under Section E. If the student is found in violation of the Student Code of Conduct, the Dean or Hearing Panel/Hearing Officer will review the student's prior disciplinary record and assess sanctions appropriate to the circumstances. The Dean will inform the student and the faculty member of the decision.\n\nIf a student withdraws from a course and is ultimately found responsible for academic dishonesty, a grade sanction (ie. \"F\" or lowered grade) in the course that is assessed by the Dean or Hearing Panel/Hearing Officer will replace any withdrawal notation on the transcript.\n\nPending disciplinary action, the student remains responsible for all academic exercises and syllabus requirements. The student may remain in class if the student's presence in the class does not interfere with the professor's ability to teach the class or the ability of other class members to learn. (See Subsection 7 for additional information regarding the removal of a student from class).\n\nSubsection 7: Faculty Role in Removal for Misconduct\n\nPrimary responsibility for managing the classroom environment rests with the faculty. Misconduct reported by faculty will usually involve disruptive behavior in class or in relation to a class. Under authority delegated by the Dean, a faculty member who has reason to believe that a student has engaged in disruptive behavior may do one of the following:\n\nIf the disruptive behavior was directly witnessed by the faculty member or if the faculty member has clear documentary evidence, the case should be referred directly to the Dean with the reasons and/or evidence for the charge and a recommendation for resolution. The Dean shall proceed under Section E; or\n\nIf the disruptive behavior was not directly witnessed by the faculty member but was witnessed or reported by students or others, the faculty member may meet with the student(s) involved and discuss the alleged violation and the evidence that supports the allegation. Such meetings should be documented to the greatest extent possible. After such meeting or meetings, the faculty member may refer the allegation(s) with the assembled documentation to the Dean with a recommendation for resolution, or choose not to refer the allegations to the Dean if the faculty member concludes that they are not supported by the evidence.\n\nIf the faculty member considers the behavior of the student menacing or threatening, they may request the Dean remove the student from the class with immediate effect until the matter is formally resolved. This request will be considered, pending review of the information regarding the incident(s).\n\nStudents who engage in any acts that result in disruption of a class may be directed by the faculty member to leave the class for the remainder of the class period. This provision is not designed to be used as a means to admonish classroom dissent. The expression of a disagreement with the instructor is not in itself disruptive behavior.\n\nA student who repeatedly engages in disruptive classroom behavior shall be referred by the faculty member to the Dean who will proceed under the provisions of Section E.\n\nA student will not be removed permanently from the classroom without review by the Dean.\n\nSubsection 8: Staff Role in Removal for Misconduct\n\nA member of the University staff who has been subject to or has witnessed conduct that is prohibited by the Student Code of Conduct may do either of the following:\n\nCall the campus police to determine next steps for the offending person. The police will report the matter to the Dean. The Dean shall proceed under Section E; or\n\nReport the matter to their supervisor and the Dean of Students by completing the misconduct referral form which can be found on the Dean's website. The report should include the staff person's written account of the incident and any additional documentation that might be available. The Dean shall proceed under Section E;\n\nIf the misconduct or disruptive behavior was not directly witnessed by the staff person but was witnessed or reported by students or others, the staff person should inform their supervisor and refer the matter and the witnesses to the Dean. The Dean shall proceed under Section E.\n\nSection C. Student Standards of Conduct\n\nSubsection 9: Code of Conduct\n\nThe University of Texas at Dallas has rules and regulations for the orderly and efficient conduct of their business, and each student is accountable for knowledge of and compliance with the Student Code of Conduct and other University policies.\n\nBecause the value of an academic degree depends on the absolute honesty, integrity, and character of the student, the University expects all students to maintain a high level of responsibility with respect to their behavior. As a member of the University community, it is imperative that a student maintain a high standard of individual responsibility and civility.\n\nThe Dean may initiate disciplinary proceedings under Section E against a student accused of a violation of the Code of Conduct upon complaint by a faculty member, staff member, student, or other source.\n\nAny behavior which may have been influenced by the use of drugs or alcoholic beverages shall not in any way limit the responsibility of the student for the consequences of their actions.\n\nInstructors are encouraged to set clear expectations regarding collaborations that are permitted to occur and materials that can be used on work done outside the classroom (homework, take home exams, etc. ). Students should assume any external assistance is prohibited unless clearly notified otherwise by the instructor.\n\nDisciplinary action may be initiated for misconduct which includes:\n\nPlagiarism: The adoption or reproduction of ideas, words, statements, images or works of another as one's own or work offered for credit without appropriate attribution.

Hazing\n\nSubsection 10: Hazing Defined\n\nThe University of Texas at Dallas is committed to providing a safe educational environment for students and will not tolerate hazing by any group or individual associated with the University. Engaging in hazing, submitting to hazing, or failing to report first-hand knowledge of hazing incidents are prohibited by state law.\n\nHazing is defined by Texas State law (Texas Education Code, Chapter 37: Subchapter F: Hazing) as: \"any intentional, knowing, or reckless act, occurring on or off the campus of an educational institution, by one person alone or acting with others, directed against a student for the purpose of pledging, being initiated into, affiliating with, holding office in, or maintaining membership in an organization if the act:\n\nis any type of physical brutality, such as whipping, beating, striking, branding, electronic shocking, placing of a harmful substance on the body, or similar activity;\n\ninvolves sleep deprivation, exposure to the elements, confinement in a small space, calisthenics (exercise), or other similar activity that subjects the student to an unreasonable risk of harm or that adversely affects the mental or physical health or safety of the student;\n\ninvolves consumption of a food, liquid, alcoholic beverage, liquor, drug, or other substance, other than as described in number five below, that subjects the student to an unreasonable risk of harm or that adversely affects the mental or physical health or safety of the student;\n\nany activity that induces, causes, or requires the student to perform a duty or task that involves a violation of the Penal Code;\n\nor involves coercing, as defined by Section 1.07, of the Texas Penal Code, a student to consume:\n\na drug;\n\nor an alcoholic beverage or liquor in an amount that would lead a reasonable person to believe that the student is intoxicated, as defined by Section 49.01, Texas Penal Code.\n\nThe above includes hazing that is with or without the consent of participants. The University charges each student with notice and knowledge of full Texas State laws regarding hazing which can be found in Texas Statute Title 2, Subtitle G, Chapter 37, Subchapter F. Any person with knowledge that a specific hazing incident has occurred on or off campus must immediately report the incident to the Dean.\n\nSubsection 11: Immunity\n\nPer Texas Statute Title 2: \"Any person who voluntarily reports a specific hazing incident involving a student in an educational institution to the Dean of Students or other appropriate official of the institution is immune from civil or criminal liability that might otherwise be incurred or imposed as a result of the reported hazing incident if the person:\n\nreports the incident before being contacted by the institution concerning the incident or otherwise being included in the institution's investigation of the incident; and\n\nas determined by the dean of students or other appropriate official of the institution designated by the institution, cooperates in good faith throughout any institutional process regarding the incident.\n\nImmunity extends to participation in any judicial proceeding resulting from the report.\n\nA person is not immune if the person:\n\nreports the person's own act of hazing;\n\nreports an incident of hazing in bad faith or with malice\".\n\nSection E. Disciplinary Proceedings and Disposition\n\nIf there is a more specific policy that specifies the proceedings for investigation, such as the Sexual Misconduct policy [UTDBP3102], that policy will govern; however, all the powers provided herein to the Dean for investigations involving student witnesses, including summons, interim disciplinary action, and withholding transcripts, grades, and degrees may be delegated to the investigator designated to that policy.\n\nSubsection 12: Investigation\n\nAll allegations and information relating to a violation of this policy shall be given to the Dean.\n\nAction under this policy may go forward regardless of other possible or pending administrative, civil, or criminal proceedings arising out of the same or other events.\n\nThe Dean shall investigate the alleged violation. The investigation shall include an attempt to confer with the accused student concerning the allegations. Following completion of the investigation, the Dean may:\n\ndismiss the allegation;\n\nproceed administratively under Subsection 13; or\n\nprepare a hearing notice based on the allegation and proceed under Subsection 14.\n\nPending a hearing or other disposition of allegations against a student, the Dean may take such immediate interim disciplinary action as is appropriate to the circumstances when such action is in the best interest of the institution. This includes but is not limited to a suspension and ban from the campus when it reasonably appears that the continuing presence of the student poses a potential danger to persons or property or where the student poses a potential threat for disrupting any activity authorized by the University. In the case of interim discipline involving a partial or full ban from campus or a prohibition from attending any course, a hearing will generally be held under the hearing procedures specified in Subsection 13-15 within ten (10) days after the interim disciplinary action was taken; however, if the Dean determines there is good cause, the 10-day period may be extended for a reasonable period.\n\nNotwithstanding the above, the Dean may withhold the issuance of an official transcript, grade, diploma, certificate, or degree to a student alleged to have violated a rule or regulation of the System or the University that would reasonably allow the imposition of such sanction. The Dean may take such action pending a hearing, resolution by administrative disposition, and/or exhaustion of appellate rights if the Dean has provided the student an opportunity to give a preliminary response to the allegations and, in the opinion of the Dean, the best interests of the UT System or the University would be served by this action.\n\nIn cases involving a violation of the Sexual Misconduct Policy [UTDBP3102], the investigation will be conducted by the Title IX Coordinator or their designee.\n\nSubsection 13: Administrative Disposition\n\nIn any case, except in a case finding a violation of the Sexual Misconduct Policy [UTDBP3102], where the accused student elects not to dispute the facts upon which the allegations are based, the student may execute a written waiver of the hearing procedures and accept the sanction(s) or reserve the right to appeal the sanction(s) as outlined in Section G.\n\nIn the event a student disputes the facts and/or allegations or at the discretion of the Dean, a hearing before a Hearing Panel or Hearing Officer may be arranged.\n\nIn any case finding a violation of the Sexual Misconduct Policy [UTDBP3102], the case will proceed under Subsection 14 of this Policy unless both the accused and the accuser agree to the terms of the administrative disposition and thus waive the hearing and appeals.\n\nSubsection 14: Hearing Panel/Hearing Officer\n\nThe University of Texas at Dallas has a Discipline Committee that consists of faculty, staff, and students. In those cases in which the respondent disputes the facts and/or allegations upon which the alleged conduct violations are based, or at the discretion of the Dean of Students, such allegations shall be heard and determined by a fair and impartial Hearing Officer or a Hearing Panel, consisting of an appropriate number of faculty, staff, and students drawn from the Discipline Committee. UT Dallas faculty serving on the Discipline Committee are appointed by the academic senate, staff are named through a selection process, and students are selected through an application process.\n\nThe Dean decides whether the case will be heard by a Hearing Panel or a Hearing Officer. If a Hearing Panel will preside over the hearing, the following members of the Discipline Committee will serve:\n\nAcademic Dishonesty: At least three members, consisting of faculty and students, and chaired by a faculty member;\n\nMisconduct violations: At least three members, consisting of faculty, staff, and students, and chaired by a faculty or staff member;\n\nViolations of the Sexual Misconduct Policy [UTDBP3102]: At least three members consisting of faculty and staff.\n\nIf a Hearing Officer will preside over the hearing, the following members of the Discipline Committee will serve:\n\nAcademic Dishonesty: One faculty member;\n\nMisconduct violations: One faculty or one staff member;\n\nViolations of the Sexual Misconduct Policy [UTDBP3102]: One faculty member or one staff member.\n\nA Hearing Panel or Hearing Officer is entitled have the advice and assistance of legal counsel from the Office of the General Counsel of the UT System and may request legal representation.\n\nA Hearing Panel or Hearing Officer shall:\n\nmaintain an orderly hearing and permit no person to be subjected to abusive treatment and may eject or exclude anyone who refuses to be orderly;\n\nrender and provide the Dean and the respondent a written decision that contains findings of fact and a conclusion as to whether the respondent is responsible for the violations as charged;\n\nupon a finding of responsibility, assess the relevant sanction(s);\n\nin cases involving a crime of violence, notify the alleged victim of the decision. The alleged victim, upon receipt of information regarding the decision, shall be bound to keep in confidence such information; and\n\nparticipate in an annual training conducted by the Office of Community Standards and Conduct.\n\nA Hearing Panel chair abstains from voting unless a decision by the committee results in a draw.\n\nSubsection 15: Student Rights and Hearing Procedures\n\nThe following rights and procedures are provided to the respondent and/or complainant as specified:\n\nThe respondent shall be given written notice of the time, place, and location of the hearing at least five (5) days in advance.\n\nThe respondent shall be advised in writing of the alleged violations of which they are being charged.\n\nAll parties will make available to the Dean of Students a list of witnesses, a summary of expected witness testimony, and copies of documents to be presented at the hearing at least three (3) days prior to the hearing.\n\nEach party shall have the right to appear, present documentary evidence, present and question witnesses and be assisted by one advisor of their choice. An advisor may not serve as a witness. An advisor may confer with and advise their respective party, but shall not be permitted to question witnesses, introduce evidence, make objections, or present arguments to the Hearing Panel or Hearing Officer. If the respondent's advisor is an attorney, the Dean's advisor may be an attorney from the Office of the General Counsel of the UT System. If the student chooses an advisor who is an attorney, the student must give notice of the name and address of the attorney to the Dean at least three (3) days before the time set for commencement of the hearing.\n\nThe respondent may challenge the impartiality of a member of the Hearing Panel or Hearing Officer. The challenge must state the reasons for the challenge, and be received through email by the Dean of Students at least three (3) days prior to the hearing. The member challenged shall determine whether they can serve with fairness and objectivity.\n\nFormal rules of evidence do not apply. No evidence other than that admitted at the hearing shall be considered by the Hearing Panel or Hearing Officer.\n\nThe chair of the Hearing Panel or Hearing Officer shall rule on all procedural matters and on objections regarding exhibits and testimony of witnesses.\n\nThe chair of the Hearing Panel or Hearing Officer has the discretion to exclude evidence which in their judgment is immaterial, irrelevant, or unduly repetitious;\n\nStatements of witnesses should generally be based upon the personal knowledge or observation of the incident.
