        "text": "You should be prepared to provide a narrative explanation within the appeal. The narrative will outline the reason(s) for your appeal, the resources or services used so far, and the plan for success if the appeal is approved. Keeping in mind that becoming Ineligible is the result of 3 consecutive semesters under a 2.0 cumulative GPA, you should provide insight into the circumstances or challenges you have faced over those semesters, and then also describe how they may have changed (worsened or improved) during the last semester.\n\nCourses such as directed research, dissertation, or a thesis are for ongoing projects. Students are likely to enroll in multiple units across multiple terms. The grading of these types of units must follow the grading basis of the course, usually S/P/F.\n\nS = Superior (superior achievement and progress on said project has been made)\n\nP = Passing (student has made appropriate progress on their project)\n\nF = Failure (Student did not make progress on the project)\n\nIn most cases, students will earn a ‘P’ indicating the project is continuing and the student is making satisfactory progress.\n\nIt is extremely important that students receive a grade for each semester of work toward their projects.\n\nThe Graduate College also has a Faculty Advisors Toolkit with additional tips and resources.\n\nInstructors can change posted grades for the current term during the Open Grading Period.\n\nFall and Spring: Open Grading Period begins on Reading Day and 14 days from the last day of finals. Summer, Winter, & 5 or 7 Week Sessions: Open Grading Period begins on the last day of classes and lasts for 14 days.\n\nFor more information on how to change a grade after submitting rosters and how to change a final grade after the open grading period, visit: Instructor Center Resource Guide: Changing a Grade After Submitting Rosters.\n\nThere is no set limit to the number of rooms you may reserve in a week, although it is contingent upon the number of rooms scheduled for classes and other events. However, only one large room (51+ seats) or two small rooms (50 or fewer seats) per week may be reserved free of charge. If you choose to reserve more rooms during a one-week period, the first large room or the first two small rooms will be free of charge and the rest of the rooms will incur a rental fee.\n\nDepending on how many requests we have received from academic departments and other clubs, the answer can be anything from a few hours to a few days. This is one reason why we require the request to be submitted at least two weeks in advance- at busy times, it can sometimes take a week or more to process your request.\n\nYou can let us know in the \"Additional Information\" box at the bottom of the request that you will need a high tech room. Once you receive confirmation of your reservation, you are responsible for contacting Classroom Technology Services (CTS) at 520-621-3852. They will take care of unlocking the equipment in the room to make it available for your use. CTS may charge for the use of equipment; these fees are not included in any invoice sent by Room and Course Scheduling, and should be paid to CTS.\n\nThere are a few possible answers for this question. One reason this might happen is because the room already has a course or an event scheduled for that time. Another possibility is that you asked for a room that was too large or too small for the size of your event. We always look for available rooms that are the right size to hold the number of people you are planning for.\n\nCourse Component: The type of structure a course has (Lecture, Lab, Independent Study, etc).\n\nInstructor Contact Hours: Instructors must meet with students a minimum of 15 contact hours per unit; see the Credit Definition policy for more information.\n\nDefault Section Size: Departments may input correct enrollment number and section size. This may be adjusted in the Schedule of Classes when scheduling individual sections.\n\nWorkload Hours: For single-component courses, Workload Hours should be identical to the Minimum Units for the course. For multi-component courses, the sum of Workload Hours for all required components should equal the Minimum Units for the course.\n\nOEE Workload Hours: This field not in use at UA.\n\nFinal Exam: Yes/No option to indicate whether the course utilizes a synchronous final exam. If yes, each course is assigned a final exam time dependent upon the meeting pattern of the course during the semester.\n\nProvider for Authentication: This field not in use at UA.\n\nLMS Extract File Type: This field not in use at UA.\n\nAuto Create: Selected to have components prepopulate on the Adjust Class Association in the Schedule of Classes.\n\nGraded Component: The component of the course that is graded or where the student receives credit on their transcript. The Primary component and Graded component should be the same.\n\nPrimary Component: the component of the course receiving/generating the most workload hours. The Primary component and Graded component should be the same.\n\nOptional Component: Departments may dictate whether or not to offer optional components for individual class offerings each semester. If offered, the department may choose to make the component required for that class in the Schedule of Classes.\n\nGenerate Class Mtg Attendance: This field not in use at UA.\n\nInclude in Dynamic Date Calc: This field not in use at UA.\n\nInstruction Mode: This field not in use in the Course Catalog. Instruction mode is defined for each section in the Schedule of Classes.\n\nAttendance Type: This field not in use at UA.\n\nRoom Characteristics Required: This field not in use in the Course Catalog. Room requests are defined for each section in the Schedule of Classes.\n\nWhat is the difference between a single component and multiple component class?\n\nThe components used at the UofA are colloquium, discussion, independent study, laboratory, lecture, seminar, studio, workshop. A single component course uses only one component. A multiple component course uses 2 or more of the components, i.e. Lecture/Laboratory.\n\nWhen should I use multiple components?\n\nMultiple components are used when an instructor would like to use different instructional methods to present course content. Example: General Chemistry uses a lecture component to present general knowledge and concepts and a laboratory component to allow the supervised practical hands-on experimentation putting into practice the information being presented in the lecture.\n\nThe Description is the shortest version of the course title, which appears on the student transcript. Character limit is 30.\n\nThe Long Course Title is the longest version of the course title, which appears in the Course Catalog and Schedule of Classes. Character limit is 100.\n\nThe Course Description is the long entry describing course content and structure. While there is no official character limit, most course descriptions are between 2 sentences and 2 paragraphs in length.\n\nAll courses will provide options for students who are unable to come to campus due to illness or other temporary circumstances, as well as for graduate students who may need to remain remote for the duration of the semester. Undergraduate students planning to learn remotely online should enroll in Live Online or iCourses but can request a special exemption if needed for degree progress or completion. Exceptions are not guaranteed and may not be possible for some courses. Students should connect with their academic advisor and review the information below on how to adjust their schedule.\n\nGenerally no, a web cam turned on during class is not a requirement. That said, consider simple etiquette practices in the digital learning environment such as muting the microphone when not speaking, evaluate your background and try to find a blank space to sit in front of as opposed to lying on a bed, for example. If the course is Live Online (synchronous) and you live in a different time zone, you may want to contact the instructor to let them know you are in a different one, especially if the difference in time will be significantly different than when the course is offered.\n\nSome examinations may require the use of a webcam.\n\nThe Live Online format is a fully online course that is offered in a synchronous format. In other words, the instructor and students meet at a regularly scheduled time/day using a virtual platform Flex In-Person, on the other hand, is a hybrid model that involves some in-person (on campus) meetings as well as utilizing virtual platforms and D2L . These are two distinct course formats. A significant number of courses offer both formats leaving the choice to the student as to which format best meets their needs.\n\nReview the course formats overview\n\nYes. This policy is for all classes taken as regular grading, for all students, in all academic career levels, for all program requirements.\n\nGraduate students can opt to earn a Pass/Fail grade instead of an A, B, C grade in letter-graded graduate courses. For a student who chooses this option and earns a Pass (equivalent to A, B, or C) those units will count toward degree completion, but will not affect GPA. A course that was initially letter-graded (A, B, C) but converted to Pass for Spring 2020 will count toward required letter-graded units.\n\nThe University will add a transcript note to classes taken in Spring 2020 Pass/Fail about the extraordinary nature of this grading basis. Many institutions, including our AAU peers, are adjusting their grading policies for this term and providing similar notes.\n\nThe Graduate College at the University of Arizona will calculate the GPA for students seeking graduate admission using only letter-graded courses. That is, P/F grades will not calculate into the GPA. However, for the Spring 2020 term, the credit units accrued for courses in which a student earned a Pass \"P\" will be included. This allows us to count the \"P\" grades toward the units required to calculate admission without affecting the GPA. We will not count \"F\" grades toward the required units.\n\nThe academic eligibility status of a graduate student at the end of the Spring 2020 term will be determined by the student’s most recent status, except in the case when a student who was on probation earns a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or greater, in which case their status will become \"eligible.\" Specifically, graduate students currently on academic probation will have their probation hold lifted if they bring their cumulative graduate GPA up to 3.0 at the end of Spring 2020.\n\nMaster’s and Doctoral Students whose Spring 2020 term was affected by Covid-19-related changes may extend their time to degree by one semester without submitting a petition. Coursework for Master’s students normally expires after 6 years. This extension would allow for 6.5 years to complete coursework for those affected by Covid-19 during the Spring 2020 term. Normally, Doctoral students must complete all degree requirements (e.g., oral defense, dissertation submission) within 5 years of passing their comprehensive exams. This extension would allow for 5.5 years to complete requirements for those affected by Covid-19 during the Spring 2020 term.\n\nContinue to check the Schedule of Classes, as a seat may open up.\n\nTo add a class that is full, you need to have the instructor's approval. In the past this has been done using a Change of Schedule (drop/add) form. Today, instructors can enter a student ID number in their Instructor Center to give you electronic permission to enroll. You complete the enrollment process in your UAccess Student Center prior to the permission expiration date. Student Permissions can replace the Change of Schedule (drop/add) form.\n\nConsult with the offering department and/or instructor about adding the class or being placed on a waiting list.\n\nConsult with your academic advisor about registering for a comparable class.\n\nDo you qualify for Back2UA? If so, you do not need to apply for re-admission. If you are a domestic undergraduate student who has missed no more than two consecutive terms (fall/spring), you may return without applying for readmission. To qualify, you must be in good academic standing, having exited the UA with a GPA of 2.0 or higher.\n\nIf you believe you qualify, the first step is to contact your academic advisor. He or she will help you assess your previous coursework and develop a plan to jump right back in. After meeting, your advisor can release the advising hold that will allow you to register along with your class during priority and open registration.\n\nContact your advisor\n\nSome students may still need to apply for readmission. These include:\n\nNon-degree seeking students\n\nStudents who were on probation or were disqualified when they left\n\nNot sure if you meet the Back2UA requirements? Give Admissions a call at 520-621-3237 or visit the Back2UA Admissions page.\n\nFERPA provides that an institution may release general directory information (that is, the items of directory information that have been designated for general, not limited, release) to anyone, but there is no obligation to do so. Since students can restrict their directory information in various ways, you must check a student's UAccess account to confirm that this is no applicable restriction prior to releasing information. If you have any question or doubt about a request for directory information or a student's restriction status, do not release the information and contact the Office of the Registrar for guidance.\n\nA University student’s records are protected under FERPA, regardless of the student’s age and regardless of whether the parents are paying the student’s tuition. A parent generally will not be granted access to those records unless the student has provided written authorization that specifically identifies which information may be released to the parent. The submission of a parent affidavit permits you to disclose student record information, but you are under no obligation to do so or to speak to parents.\n\nThe University may disclose to third parties any student information that is designated as directory information, provided the student has not restricted such information from disclosure. Students must request a restriction through UAccess, which will remain in effect unless and until the student changes it. Students who have requested a restriction but then wish to have specific directory information released in a specific circumstance may do so by providing a written authorization to the Office of the Registrar.\n\nStudents who wish to restrict the release of their names as directory information should carefully consider the following:\n\nYour name will not appear in university publications, including the commencement bulletin.\n\nThird parties will be denied all your directory information and will be informed that the University has no information available about your attendance.\n\nInternally, relevant information may be shared relatively freely with University personnel who can help to assess or address the situation, such as the Dean of Students Office, the Threat Assessment and Management Team, and/or University Police, as well as to University personnel and students who need the information to protect their own health and safety. Externally, the University may share information that it determines to be \"necessary to protect the health or safety of the student or other individuals.\" Factors considered in making this assessment include but are not limited to the severity of the threat to the health or safety of those involved, the need for the information, the time required to deal with the emergency, and the ability of the parties to whom the information is to be given to deal with the emergency. This determination and any such external disclosures are made by the Office of Public Safety, the University Police, the Dean of Students, Campus Health, and others specifically authorized to do so by the University Registrar.\n\nAn \"education record\" for purposes of FERPA includes any record that contains personally identifiable information (broadly conceived) about one or more students and that is maintained by the University or by any person acting for the University – regardless of whether the record is \"educational\" or \"academic\" in nature. The term also encompasses any such information or data recorded in any medium, including not only traditional printed paper records, but also electronic files and data, handwritten documents and notes, photographs, audio and video tapes, email messages, microfilm, and microfiche.\n\nCommon examples include (but are not limited to):\n\nadmissions files for students who are accepted and enrolled, including applications, recommendations, high school transcripts, and rater evaluations\n\nbiographical information about students such as date and place of birth, gender, nationality, race, ethnicity, and identification photographs\n\ncommunications in typed, handwritten, emailed, or other recorded form to, from, or about students\n\ncourse work including papers, exams, grades, and evaluations\n\ndisciplinary records\n\ninternship program records\n\npersonal information shared through course assignments, class discussions, evaluations, and office hour visits\n\nstudent financial and financial aid records\n\nstudent identification number (SID)\n\ndetails about student status such as academic specialization and activities, class schedules, and courses taken\n\nThe Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, commonly referred to as FERPA or the Buckley amendment, is a federal law designed to protect the privacy of a student’s education record. FERPA applies to all educational agencies or institutions that receive federal funding for any program administered by the Secretary of Education, including the University, and their employees. FERPA also applies to private persons and entities that perform services involving information from student records on the University's behalf; in such cases, the private persons and entities must observe the same FERPA requirements that are applicable to the University and its employees. As is outlined in more detail in our \":annual Notification of FERPA Rights {LINK}, FERPA grants all University students (including minors), the following specific rights:\n\nThe right to inspect and review their own education records (as defined by the statute), with certain limited exceptions, within 45 days after the University's receipt of a request\n\nThe right to seek the amendment of their education records in certain circumstances\n\nThe right to consent to the disclosure of personally identifiable information contained in their \"education records\" in many circumstances\n\nThe right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education about alleged failures to comply with FERPA.\n\nIn general, students have a right to access their own education records, as well as to control access to those records by others; in general, the University and its employees are prohibited from releasing or disclosing \" personally identifiable information\" from a student's education record to anyone other than the relevant student —including even the student's parents, and even if the student is a minor— without that student's prior written consent. However, FERPA allows disclosure without student consent in several circumstances, including but not limited to the following:\n\nTo University employees who have a job-related need to know the information contained in the records in order to perform their institutional duties. (e.g., faculty members sending grades to the Registrar’s Office or faculty or staff concerned about a student’s behavior making a report to the Dean of Students Office, the Threat Assessment and Management Team, and/or University Police)\n\nOf “directory information,” as described in more detail below\n\nTo the parents (or legal guardians) of a \"dependent student,\" as defined in the Internal Revenue Code (under University policy, such disclosures will be made only when the requesting parent or guardian has provided a current, notarized affidavit, along with a copy of the relevant page of the parent's or guardian's most recent income tax return indicating the student's dependent status; otherwise, prior written consent from the student is required).\n\nOf relevant appropriate information to those who need to know and/or can provide assessments and/or assistance in situation involving a significant perceived threat to the health and safety of students and/or others; such information may also be shared relatively freely internally under the “university employee” exception described above, but, in general and whenever reasonably possible, should be shared externally only by University Police, the Dean of Students, Campus Health, or others specifically authorized to do so by the University Registrar\n\nFERPA permits disclosure in the above circumstances, as well in several additional, less common ones, but does not require any such disclosure; we may and should exercise appropriate discretion and caution. More information about these circumstances and how they are handled is available from the Office of the Registrar and/or the Office of General Counsel.\n\nYes, but you will have to change your degree date to the term in which you will complete the coursework for that course. All coursework (required or elective) must be complete on the day before the graduation date. Taking an incomplete in a course in your final semester means that you did not finish all coursework in time for your degree date.\n\nIf you plan to take a course at an Arizona Community College, you should refer to the Course Equivalency Guide which is part of a statewide collaboration called AZTransfer, to ensure that the courses will apply appropriately to your degree program. Community college courses listed in AZTransfer with direct Arizona equivalencies do not need a pre-approval to transfer to Arizona. If you are taking the course at an Arizona four-year school or an out-of-state school, please visit Transfer Credit Preapproval for more information and instructions.\n\nIf you are utilizing Chapter 1606 or 30, you must verify your enrollment at the end of each month to initiate payments. Log in to the Web Automated Verification of Enrollment or call 1-877-823-2378.\n\nIf you are utilizing Chapter 33 Post 9/11, STEM Extension, or Fry Scholarship for terms starting after 12/17/2021, you must verify your enrollment at the end of each month to initiate your monthly housing allowance payment. Students with a US mobile number on file will receive an opt-in text to receive a monthly text to verify enrollment. Students who do not have a US mobile number on file with the VA will not be able to use text verification, instead they will be automatically enrolled in email verification. Further information can be found at Enrollment Verification - Education and Training (va.gov).\n\nThe Post 9/11, STEM Extension, and Fry Scholarship are last payer, the VA requires schools to report the net cost for in-state tuition and fees assessed by the institution for the program of education after the application of any waiver of, or reduction in, Tuition and Fees; and any scholarship, or other Federal, State, institutional or employer-based aid or assistance (excluding loans and title IV funds) that is provided directly to the institution and specifically designated for the sole purpose of defraying tuition and fees.\n\nTwo weeks prior to the first day of the semester, a “Pending Military Benefit” service indicator will be placed on accounts for students who have submitted their veteran benefit certification request. This code will prevent late fees being charged on tuition balances while awaiting the VA payment. Please be aware, you will continue to receive invoices and emails from the Bursar’s Office until your VA tuition payment has been applied and your balance has been paid in full.\n\nThe Military-Connected Benefits and Certifications Office (MCBC) will start submitting enrollment certifications in the order they are received to the VA Regional Office in Muskogee, Oklahoma 60 days prior to the start of the term. Students are encouraged to finalize enrollment and submit their request as early as possible. Once a request is received it typically takes 10-15 business days to report enrollment to the VA, with an additional 2-4 weeks for the VA to process claims.\n\nUtilize Priority Registration to finalize schedule and submit your veteran benefit certification request as early as possible.\n\nThe VA requires the University to verify enrolled courses are meeting a degree requirement (major/minor/general education core, etc.). For undergraduate students, this is determined using the student’s advising report. If a course does not appear to meet a degree requirement, and an exception has not been placed in the report, advisor approval is required. An email will be sent to the academic advisor and the student will be Cc’d in the email.\n\nThe Post 9/11 and Fry Scholarship pays the monthly housing allowance directly to students at the end of each month. On or around the first of the month, students will receive payment for the previous month’s enrollment. Please be aware that your first and last payments of the term are always prorated. It is the responsibility of the student to make payment to the University for the housing/dorm charges.\n\nNote: Effective terms beginning after 12/17/2021, students must verify enrollment at the end of each month to initiate payment.\n\nIf you are utilizing Chapter 33 Post 9/11, STEM Extension, or Fry Scholarship, financial aid (grants, loans, etc.) will pay towards any balance you currently show due. Title IV Federal Financial Aid does not affect the amount of tuition charges reported to the VA. The VA requires schools to report the net tuition & mandatory fee costs after any tuition specific aid (scholarships, waivers, discounts, etc) has been applied.\n\nThe VA requires schools to report units only on the first submission with zero tuition & fee costs to ensure students receive book/supply stipends and housing stipends in a timely manner. The MCBC Office will submit a second submission reporting the net tuition & fees charges after the drop date of each session.\n\nWhen the VA payment is received (2-4 weeks after drop date of each session) and applied to your Bursar account, you will be refunded your expected funds (depending on your eligibility % and scholarships, it may be all of it or a partial amount). Students should verify their banking information is accurate prior to the start of the term.\n\nTo ensure your funds arrive as early as possible, meet with your advisor, review your advising report, and utilize priority registration to submit your veteran benefit certification request immediately after finalizing your enrollment.\n\nLevel of benefits is determined by the Department of Veterans Affairs and is based on the rate of pursuit for each day of the term. Rate of pursuit is determined by the start and end dates of each course and the number of units for which you are enrolled. University staff do not have access to your detailed benefit information. Questions about housing allowance or book stipend payments can be answered by the Muskogee VA Office at 1-888-442-4551.\n\nHow do I apply for Department of Defense Tuition Assistance (TA)?\n\nThe Army, Marine Corps, Navy, and Air Force each have their own TA application forms and procedures and students should apply for TA through their specific branch education center.\n\nVirtual Education Centers by Branch:\n\nArmy\n\nMarine Corps\n\nNavy\n\nAir Force\n\nA student using TA must be pre-approved prior to enrolling in a course. Once TA has been approved by the student’s military branch, the student should enroll in the course. This must be done prior to the first day of class or TA will not be approved by the Department of Defense.\n\nBeing in Arizona for 1 year does not necessarily make you a resident for tuition purposes. You will need to meet all of the requirements: one year showing physical presence, intent beyond the circumstance of being a student, and evidence of one year of financial independence, unless you meet one of the exceptions.\n\nStudents who are already attending UA as a non-resident, would need to submit a Petition to Change Residency (during the petition period) for a change of residency classification for tuition.\n\nNewly admitted students who feel they have been misclassified, would complete a Domicile Affidavit and submit to the Residency Classification Office for further review of their residency classification.\n\nUniversity of Arizona transfer students were provided an option to opt-in to the Reverse Transfer program upon admission. If you opted-out during the admission process, you will have an opportunity to opt-in if you change your mind.\n\nTo opt-in after admission, please complete the consent form and submit the form to the Office of the Registrar either by email at reghelp@arizona.edu or in person in the Administration Building Room 210.\n\nIf you opted-in to the Reverse Transfer program, your academic records will be shared with other previously attended two-year academic institutions for the purposes of credit evaluation. There are two ways this occurs:\n\nNational Student Clearinghouse Institutions: You do not need to do anything. The Office of the Registrar submits enrollment records after each major term for participating schools to pick up the information in the National Student Clearinghouse Reverse Transfer portal. If you are unsure whether your former institution(s) participate in the National Student Clearinghouse, please contact your former institution.\n\nNon-National Student Clearinghouse Institutions: The Office of the Registrar will send a transcript to the two-year institution at no cost if requested directly by the institution. Please contact your institution to have them request the transcript.\n\nNOTE: In order to receive a transcript at no cost for reverse transfer purposes, students must have at least 12 transfer units accepted from a two-year institution, and have earned at least one unit at The University of Arizona.\n\nIf an Incomplete grade is received, the Office of Registrar will evaluate the worst-case scenario. An E grade will be assumed for the incomplete and the GPA will be calculated. If the resulting GPA is over 2.500, the student will have met the criteria for Second Start.\n\nIf the resulting GPA is less than 2.500, the record will be evaluated again after the final grade is posted.\n\nAll units completed will be used to calculate the GPA.\n\nEx: The student completed five classes (15 units) with grades of C, C, B, A, E in her first term back so she earned a GPA of 2.200. She does not qualify for Second Start. Without the grade of E, this student's GPA would have been 2.750.\n\nCompleted units are the total number of units the student finishes in the term. Earned units are the total number of units the students successfully completes in the term. Completed units are evaluated for the 12 units required.\n\nEx: If the student attempted four classes (12 units) and received grades of A, B, B, and E, then the student earned only 9 units, but the student completed 12 units. This record will be evaluated for the 2.500 GPA required.\n\nEx: If the student attempted four classes and received grades of A, C, B, and W, then the student earned 9 units. The student also completed only 9 units. This record will not be evaluated for the 2.500 GPA required until the end of the next term, if the student has completed 12 units by that time.\n\nYes, but you will have to change your degree date to the term in which you will complete the coursework for that course. All coursework (required or elective) must be complete on the day before the graduation date. Taking an incomplete in a course in your final semester means that you did not finish all coursework in time for your degree date.\n\nYes, but you will have to change your degree date to the term in which you will complete the coursework for that course. All coursework (required or elective) must be completed on the day before the graduation date. Taking an incomplete in a course in your final semester means that you did not finish all coursework in time for your degree date.\n\nFor most classes, a grade of D is the lowest passing grade that will earn course credit. Some colleges require a grade of C or better to receive credit for core or upper-division courses, or courses taken as a prerequisite.\n\nStudents should contact an academic advisor for specific requirements for their program.\n\nGraduate and professional programs have specific requirements for passing grades.\n\nA student may appeal their final course grade by using the following procedures. The current process, deadlines, and the grade appeal form are defined by the Office of the Registrar.\n\nPrior to filing an official grade appeal, the student should discuss the concerns with the course instructor or faculty member responsible for the course. It is important for a student to initiate this conversation as soon as possible in order to meet the deadline should they choose to file an appeal.\n\nIf concerns over a course grade are not resolved satisfactorily after speaking with the instructor, students may file a grade appeal. Valid reasons for appeal include:\n\nviolation of university policy\n\nfailure to follow published course policies\n\ninconsistent grading within the student’s course section\n\ndisagreement over factual accuracy of graded work\n\nInvalid reasons for appeal include:\n\ndisagreement with published course policies\n\ndifferences in grading policies between other courses or sections of the same course\n\nimpact of disputed grade on student’s academic progress or eligibility\n\nThe steps of the grade appeal process are available at this link: Grade Appeal.\n\nCourses such as directed research, dissertation, or a thesis are for ongoing projects. Students are likely to enroll in multiple units across multiple terms. The grading of these types of units must follow the grading basis of the course, usually S/P/F.\n\nS = Superior (superior achievement and progress on said project has been made)\n\nP = Passing (student has made appropriate progress on their project)\n\nF = Failure (Student did not make progress on the project)\n\nIn most cases, students will earn a ‘P’ indicating the project is continuing and the student is making satisfactory progress.\n\nIf a transferred course has been rejected, and your Advisor would like to use it in your degree plan, please submit a Transfer Credit Appeal. If you transferred a course that you think is equivalent to a University of Arizona course required in your major, and it is currently receiving elective credit, please submit a Course Equivalency Request.\n\nThere is no set length of time. Once the petition is received in the General Petitions Office, it will be reviewed to make sure that all the necessary documentation is attached (Is the petition form signed? Are all the required instructor statement forms included, did the Dean's Office sign the petition, etc.). If anything is missing the student will be contacted. Other departments or offices at the University may be contacted for additional information if the student mentions them but does not include any information for the Committee (e.g. If the student says in his/her statement, \"My advisor told me not to drop the course during the semester\", the advisor might be contacted to verify this or provide additional information.)\n\nOnce the petition seems complete, it is routed to each Committee member, individually, for his/her review and vote. The committee member can request additional information if they have questions. A petition needs 3 of 5 agreeing votes for there to be a final decision. Each reader takes a different amount of time depending, in part, on how many petitions they are reviewing at once, time of the semester, etc.\n\nStudents intending to submit a petition for more than one semester should provide a personal statement for each term to explain how the extenuating circumstances affected the student’s academic performance in that term. Supporting documentation should be specific to each term of the petition but if the support documentation applies to both semesters, they do not need to be duplicated.\n\nFor online medical petitions, all submissions require the submission of a personal statement and the medical provider form for each term. The medical provider form may include multiple terms, and can be used in separate petition submissions, but must include dates of treatment or onset that reflect the terms requested.\n\nThe Online Retroactive Medical Withdrawal for medical reasons (the student’s medical reasons, no one else’s) is available on UAccess Student Center.\n\nStudents can submit the Petition for Retroactive Academic Withdrawal form for sex-based harassment or discrimination by emailing a completed form to equity@arizona.edu. Students can contact the Office of Institutional Equity (OIE) at 520-621-9449\n\nUse the General Petition form for all other requests to waive University Academic Policy.\n\nWhile many student petitions have some merit, University policy, precedent, or a lack of convincing evidence might justify denying the request. The following are some of the factors that influence Committee decisions:\n\nThe student is ultimately responsible for knowing and following University policies and procedures.\n\nThe student has the responsibility to meet deadlines and to check for errors in course registration in a timely fashion. Demonstrating that this responsibility has been satisfied, or alternatively, that the petitioner could not possibly satisfy the responsibility, weighs heavily with the committee.\n\nThe committee rarely intervenes in situations where individual Colleges can act to remedy a situation.\n\nThe committee will act on the basis of the materials presented. In some cases, the committee cannot grant the request because of missing materials.\n\nIf your petition is denied, you may make an appointment to meet with the co-chair of the Committee for additional explanation or clarification of the petition decision. After meeting with the co-chair, petitions may be resubmitted for reconsideration but this is not likely to result in a changed verdict unless the student has something new to add or new documentation that the committee has not seen and should take into account. New information must be submitted in order for a petition to be reconsidered. Meeting with the co-chair does not mean the decision will be overturned."
