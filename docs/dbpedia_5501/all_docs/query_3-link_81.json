        "text": "There are two programs available to facilitate postsecondary educational opportunities for State employees and their dependents, as well as dependents of public school teachers: fee waiver for State employees and fee discount for children of State employees and public school teachers.\n\nInstitutions\n\nFee Waiver\n\nFee Discount\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nCompleted forms must be submitted directly to the enrolling higher education institution for approval and processing. The Tennessee Higher Education Commission does not accept, approve, or process Fee Waiver forms.\n\nFee Waiver Form for State Employees (PDF File)\n\nFee Waiver Rules for State Employees (PDF File)\n\nThe fee waiver program allows full-time employees of the executive, judicial, or legislative branch of State government to take one course, undergraduate or graduate, at any State supported college, university, or College of Applied Technology, as well as the Tennessee Language Center.\n\nFull-time employee is defined as employee of one of the three branches of government in a position classified as “full-time” and expected to work 1,950 per year, or an employee, regardless of classification who is expected to work 1,600 hours per year and who receive employment benefits provided to all full-time employees.\n\nThe employee must have been employed by the State at least six continuous months immediately prior to the first day of the class.\n\nPublic school teachers are not eligible for this program.\n\nAll fees are waived except for parking fees, lab fees and fees over and above tuition charged for courses within a particular discipline. Additionally, special fees for on-line courses are not waived except for on-line courses taken through the Regents Online Degree Program.\n\nAn employee may receive the waiver for only one course per semester or mini-semester, not to exceed a maximum of four (4) courses per academic year. (A mini-semester is an abbreviated semester scheduled between the end of Fall and beginning of Spring semesters or between the end of Spring and beginning of Summer semesters.) The one possible exception to this rule relates to the number of classes that may be taken during two terms that make up the Summer semester. A state employee can take one class in each of the two terms of the Summer semester under two conditions:\n\nFirst, the two Summer semester courses can not overlap.\n\nSecond, one or both of the Summer semester courses will not result in the employee utilizing the fee waiver to more than four (4) courses for each academic year. This presumes the employee has not used the fee waiver during one of the institution’s mini-semesters.\n\nThe fee waiver form must be signed by the employee and by the employee's supervisor or other person in the employee's department/agency who by virtue of his position has knowledge of and can verify that the employee meets the eligibility requirements.\n\nEnrolling in a course using the fee waiver is on a space available basis. Some institutions limit when a person utilizing a fee waiver may register for courses. Each institution's procedures vary and the employee is encouraged to contact the Bursar or admissions office of the institution to determine when they may register and when the form must be submitted.\n\nCompleted forms must be submitted directly to the enrolling higher education institution for approval and processing. The Tennessee Higher Education Commission does not accept, approve, or process Fee Discount forms.\n\nFee Discount Form for Children of Licensed Public School Teachers and Children of State Employees (PDF File)\n\nFee Discount Rules for Children of Licensed Public School Teachers (PDF File)\n\nFee Discount Rules for Children of State Employees (PDF File)\n\nThe fee discount program provides a 25 percent discount on enrollment fees for undergraduate courses, generally referred to as tuition or maintenance fees, to the child of a(n):\n\nfull-time employee of the executive, judicial, or legislative branch of State government;\n\nteacher licensed by the Tennessee Department of Education (TDOE) who works full time in a Tennessee public school;\n\ninstructor licensed by a branch of the U.S. Armed Forces to teach Reserve Officer Training Corps in a public school;\n\ntechnology coordinator currently employed full time by a public school system;\n\nretired state employee with 25 years of service;\n\ndeceased state employee who died while employed by the State, whether or not the death was job related or in the line of duty, or who died after entering retirement with 25 years of service;\n\nretired public school teacher with a minimum of 30 years of full-time creditable service in Tennessee public schools;\n\nretired public school teacher who received a disability retirement after a minimum of 25 years of full-time creditable service;\n\ndeceased teacher who:\n\nwas licensed by TDOE and employed full time in a Tennessee public school at the time of death;\n\ndied after entering retirement with 30 years of service of full-time creditable service in Tennessee public schools; or\n\ndied after entering disability retirement with 25 years of service of full-time creditable service in Tennessee public schools;\n\nThe discount will be applied to any number of courses up to and including full-time study.\n\nFee discounts are only available for courses classified as undergraduate as defined by the institutions.\n\nFor a state employee, “full-time” means the position must be classified as “full-time” and expected to work 1,950 per year, or regardless of classification expected to work 1,600 hours per year and receives employment benefits provided to all full-time employees.\n\nFor a teacher or technology coordinator, “full-time” means the position must require them to be on the job on school days throughout the school year at least the number of hours during which schools in the local board of education are in session.\n\nTo be eligible the child must:\n\nBe under the age of 24 as of the first day of classes; and\n\nLive with or previously lived in a parent-child relationship with the eligible employee/teacher.\n\nMany questions arise as to who may be considered a dependent eligible for this discount:\n\nThe discount is available to any legally adopted or stepchild living in a parent-child relationship.\n\nThis would also include grandchildren being raised by a grandparent who is an eligible State employee or public school teacher.\n\nThe key to this issue is whether the eligible State employee or public school teacher has legal custody of the child and whether the child is considered a dependent of the employee/teacher.\n\nThe discount will be applied to any number of courses up to and including full-time study.\n\nThe fee discount form must be signed by the employee and by the employee's supervisor or other person in the employee's department/agency who by virtue of his position has knowledge of and can verify that the employee meets eligibility requirements.\n\nIn the case of a retired state employee or retired teacher, living or deceased, the retirement verification must be made by the Division of Retirement (TCRS). The otherwise completed form should be mailed or faxed to the attention of the Retired Payroll Section for verification as follows:\n\nTCRS, 15th Floor Andrew Jackson Building, 502 Deaderick Street, Nashville, TN 37243 or fax 615-401-6818.\n\nVoice Toll-Free: 800-922-7772\n\nTelecommunication Device for Deaf Persons (TDD): 800-766-4952\n\nIf faxing the form you must include a mailing address to which the form can be returned to the employee as most institutions will require an original signature verifying eligibility.\n\nThe employee or their dependent is responsible for submitting the fee discount form to the institution in a timely fashion. Each institution's procedures vary and the employee or their dependent is encouraged to contact the Bursar's office of the institution to determine when the form must be submitted.\n\nFee Waiver: Any full-time employee of the executive, judicial or legislative branch of State government. The benefit is not available to public school teachers. Full-time employee is defined as employee of one of the three branches of government in a position classified as “full-time” and who is:\n\nexpected to work 1,950 hours per year; or\n\nexpected to work 1,600 hours per year, regardless of classification and who receives employment benefits provided to all full-time employees.\n\nFee Discount: Any child of a full-time employee of the executive, judicial or legislative branch of State government under the age of 24 and living in a parent-child relationship. Full-time employee is as defined in the Fee Waiver response to this question. The fee discount is also available to:\n\nThe child of a state employee retired after 25 years as a State employee (public school teachers are not considered state employees) even if the retired employee has died since retirement but before his/her child begins receiving the benefit of the fee discount;\n\nThe child of a former State employee who died while employed by the State, whether or not the death was job related or in the line of duty may also receive the discount;\n\nThe child of a teacher licensed by the Department of Education or by a branch of the U.S. Armed Forces to teach Reserve Officer Training Corps, and technology coordinators currently employed in a public school system; and\n\nThe child of a public school teacher/technology coordinator, whose parent/school teacher dies while he/she is receiving the discount, may continue to receive it as long as the student is otherwise eligible. (This provision does not apply to the child of a former public school teacher who dies prior to their child becoming eligible for the discount).\n\nFor the purpose of eligibility, the child’s age is determined as of the day classes begin. Additionally, for the purpose of eligibility of public school teachers, the person must be licensed to teach by the Tennessee Department of Education or certified by a branch of the U. S. Armed Services to teach ROTC, but could hold an administrative position.\n\nFee Waiver: Any State employee as defined above may take one course per term, undergraduate or graduate, at any State supported college or university, any Tennessee College of Applied Technology, or the Tennessee Language Center. Generally, all fees are waived except for the cost of books, application fees, off-campus facility fees, parking fees, lab fees, and fees over and above tuition charged for courses within a particular discipline. Additionally, special fees for on-line courses are not waived except for on-line courses taken through the TN eCampus.\n\nFee Discount: The child of a State employee/public school teacher as defined above will receive a 25 percent discount on enrollment fee for undergraduate courses which is calculated by the number of hours taken and generally referred to as tuition. No other fees are included in the discount.\n\nFee Waiver: You must have been employed by the State at least six months prior to the beginning of the class.\n\nFee Discount: No.\n\nFee Waiver: Not applicable.\n\nFee Discount: The discount is available to any legally adopted or stepchild living in a parent-child relationship. This would also include grandchildren being raised by a grandparent who is an eligible State employee/public school teacher.\n\nFee Waiver and Fee Discount: Employees of these agencies are not entitled to the benefits of either program. While they may be “regarded” as a State agency for a particular purpose, they would not be considered a State agency for the purpose of these programs unless the agency is a part of the executive, legislative or judicial branch of State government. Similarly, agencies that contract to perform a responsibility that would otherwise be the duty of the State agency or local board of education would not be eligible under the law. Other factors to consider that will help make this determination is whether the employees/teachers accrue sick or annual leave pursuant to the statute authorizing such leave for State employees, or in the case of public school teachers, pursuant to that board's policy.\n\nFee Waiver: An employee may receive the waiver for only one course per semester or mini-semester, not to exceed a maximum of four (4) courses per academic year. (A mini-semester is an abbreviated semester scheduled between the end of Fall and beginning of Spring semesters or between the end of Spring and beginning of Summer semesters.) The one possible exception to this rule relates to the number of classes that may be taken during two terms that make up the Summer semester. A state employee can take one class in each of the two terms of the Summer semester under two conditions.\n\nFirst, the two Summer semester courses can not overlap.\n\nSecond, one or both of the Summer semester courses will not result in the employee utilizing the fee waiver to more than four (4) courses for each academic year. This presumes the employee has not used the fee waiver during one of the institution’s special mini-semesters.\n\nFee Discount: The discount will be applied to any number of courses up to and including full-time study.\n\nFee Waiver: The fee waiver form must be signed by the employee and by the employee's supervisor or other person in the employee's department/agency who by virtue of their position has knowledge of and can verify that the employee meets the eligibility requirements.\n\nFee Discount: The fee discount form must be signed by the employee and by the employee's supervisor or other person in the employee's department/agency who by virtue of their position has knowledge of and can verify that the employee meets the eligibility requirements.\n\nIn the case of a retired state employee, the retirement verification must be made by the Division of Retirement. The otherwise completed form should be mailed or faxed to the attention of the Retired Payroll Section for verification as follows:\n\nTCRS, 10th Floor Andrew Jackson Building, 502 Deaderick Street, Nashville, TN 37243 or fax 615-401-6818.\n\nVoice Toll-Free: 800-922-7772\n\nTelecommunication Device for Deaf Persons (TDD): 800-766-4952\n\nIf faxing the form you must include a mailing address to which the form can be returned to you as most institutions will require an original signature verifying eligibility.\n\nThe employee or their dependent is responsible for submitting the fee waiver form to the institution in a timely fashion. Each institution's procedures vary and the employee or their dependent is encouraged to contact the Bursar's office of the institution to determine when the form must be submitted.\n\nCompleted forms must be submitted directly to the enrolling higher education institution for approval and processing. The Tennessee Higher Education Commission does not accept, approve, or process Fee Waiver or Fee Discount forms.\n\nFee Waiver: The employee is responsible for submitting the fee waiver form to the institution, which is generally due when enrolling in classes. However, each institution's procedures vary and the employee is encouraged to contact the Bursar's office of the institution to determine when the form must be submitted.\n\nFee Discount: The employee or their dependent is responsible for submitting the fee discount form to the institution in a timely fashion. Each institution's procedures vary and the employee of their dependent is encouraged to contact the Bursar's office of the institution to determine when the form must be submitted.\n\nFee Waiver: Enrolling in a course using the fee waiver is on a space available basis. Some institutions limit when a person utilizing a fee waiver may register for courses. Each institution's procedures vary and the employee is encouraged to contact the admissions office of the institution to determine when they may register.\n\nFee Discount: Use of the fee discount will not affect when you are able to register for courses."
