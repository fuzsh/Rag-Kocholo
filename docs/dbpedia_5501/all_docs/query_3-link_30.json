        "text": "IMPORTANT INFORMATION ON SAT AND ACT:\n\nEffective fall 2023 through spring 2027 admission cycles, students will have the option to submit SAT or ACT exam scores as part of their application. However, students should carefully consider whether they would like to send their test scores, and should carefully review the information and FAQs on the SAT/ACT Test Optional Policy available here.\n\nThe University will continue to collect Regents exam scores and use them for proficiency determinations and will continue to run the proficiency index based on Regents exam scores (when available) and an applicant’s high school GPA. If an applicant does not have any relevant Regents Exam scores, proficiency in English and math will be assessed based on high school GPA or High School Equivalency exam scores.\n\nWhat are CUNY’s proficiency requirements?\n\nStudents can demonstrate that they meet the University’s proficiency requirements in English and Math based on their SAT, ACT, or NY State Regents test scores:\n\nEnglish\n\nStudents may meet the proficiency requirement in English by documenting any one of the following:\n\nSAT I Verbal score of 480 or higher or SAT Critical Reading score of 480 or higher or SAT Evidence-Based Reading and Writing (EBRW) section score of 480 or higher\n\nACT English score of 20 or higher\n\nNY State English Regents score of 75 or higher\n\nMathematics\n\nStudents may meet the proficiency requirement in mathematics by documenting any one of the following:\n\nSAT Math score of 500 or higher\n\nSAT Math Section (exam date March 2016 and thereafter), score of 530 or higher\n\nACT Math score of 21 or higher\n\nNY State Regents:\n\nCommon Core Regents: Score of 70 or higher in Algebra I or a score of 70 or higher in Geometry or a score of 65 or higher in Algebra 2.\n\nScore of 80 or higher in Integrated Algebra or Geometry or Algebra 2/Trigonometry AND successful completion of the Algebra 2/Trigonometry or higher-level course.\n\nScore of 75 or higher in one of the following:\n\nMath A or Math B\n\nSequential II or Sequential III\n\nCUNY’s Proficiency Index\n\nStudents who do not achieve the required scores on SAT, ACT, or New York State Regents Exams can satisfy the proficiency requirements with:\n\nan English proficiency index score of 65 or higher\n\na math proficiency index score of 60 or higher\n\nDetailed information about the proficiency index is available below.\n\nHow do the University’s proficiency requirements affect admission to CUNY for freshmen?\n\nBaccalaureate Programs\n\nCandidates for freshman admission to a bachelor’s degree program must show that they are proficient in English and math on the basis of the SAT, ACT, New York State Regents, or meet the proficiency index scores in order to be admitted.\n\nStudents who do not meet the proficiency requirements should speak to an admissions counselor to get more information about the best choice for their individual circumstances.\n\nThree groups of students may be admitted to a bachelor’s program without first demonstrating proficiency:\n\nApplicants who already have a bachelor’s degree or higher from an accredited program. (However, ESL applicants may be asked by their college to take Accuplacer ESL to assess their English language skills);\n\nApplicants who meet the proficiency requirement in math, who meet the University’s definition of ESL, and who meet all other admissions requirements may be admitted. These students must meet proficiency in English within two years of initial enrollment;\n\nApplicants who qualify for the SEEK program. SEEK students must meet the University’s proficiency requirement in English within one year of initial enrollment, and must meet the proficiency requirement in mathematics within two years of initial enrollment.\n\nAssociate Programs\n\nCandidates for freshman admission to an associate program do not have to demonstrate proficiency in English or math based on the SAT, ACT, New York State Regents, or CUNY’s proficiency index to be admitted. Students who do not meet the proficiency requirement in one or more areas have several options:\n\nEnroll in a free summer/winter immersion program.\n\nParticipate in CUNY Start, Math Start, or CLIP.\n\nEnroll in the necessary corequisite courses at a CUNY community college, or in an associate program at a comprehensive college.\n\nOnce enrolled in an associate program, students may be required to take one or more corequisite courses to build their skills in any area in which they have not demonstrated proficiency.\n\nHow do proficiency requirements affect admission to CUNY for transfer students?\n\nCandidates for transfer admission to a bachelor’s degree program must show that they are proficient in English and math in order to be admitted. Transfer applicants for an associate degree program do not have to demonstrate proficiency to be admitted. Proficiency requirements can be met based on the SAT, ACT, NYS Regents exams, CUNY’s proficiency index, or prior English or math college-level courses:\n\nTransfer Students From Outside CUNY\n\nStudents with a 3-credit college-level English course with a grade of ‘C’ or better from an accredited college or university (where English is the primary language of instruction) have satisfied the proficiency requirement in English.\n\nStudents with a 3-credit college-level math course with a grade of ‘C’ or better from an accredited college or university have satisfied the proficiency requirement in math.\n\nTransfers from a CUNY College\n\nAll students who wish to transfer from a CUNY associate program to a CUNY bachelor’s program must meet the University’s proficiency requirements in English and mathematics to be admitted. Students may meet these requirements via the SAT, ACT, New York State Regents, or the proficiency index. Additional ways of meeting proficiency requirements:\n\nStudents who have successfully completed the top-level remedial Reading/ESL Reading course at a CUNY college satisfy the reading portion of the English proficiency requirement. Likewise, students who have successfully completed the top-level remedial Writing/ESL Writing course at a CUNY college satisfy the writing component of the English proficiency requirement.\n\nStudents who successfully complete a 3-credit college-level English course at a CUNY college satisfy the proficiency requirement in English.\n\nStudents who have successfully completed Elementary Algebra (or approved alternative offered by the college) or a 3-credit college-level math course at a CUNY college satisfy the proficiency requirement in math.\n\nWhat is the Proficiency Index and how will it work?\n\nThe proficiency index is a formula that combines overall high school grade point average with SAT and Regents scores to determine whether the student has a good chance of succeeding in a credit-bearing math or English course without any additional support. The proficiency index scores will be used to determine whether the student is eligible to begin in college level English and math or if remedial intervention is necessary.\n\nThere are separate proficiency formulas for math and English. Both use information that is already part of the application for freshman admissions: student’s overall high school GPA at the time of application, SAT scores, and Regents scores. If an applicant has both SAT scores and Regents scores, the formula will use both scores, but if they have only Regents or only SAT, it will use whichever is available. If an applicant does not have any relevant Regents Exam or SAT scores, proficiency in English and math will be assessed based on high school GPA or High School Equivalency exam scores. The formula places more weight on high school grades than test scores, but higher test scores can help offset lower grades and vice versa.\n\nWhat Proficiency Index scores are needed to achieve proficiency in English and math?\n\nEnglish: a score of 65 or more\n\nMath: a score of 60 or more\n\nHow will English as a Second Language (ESL) applicants be assessed for placement into courses?\n\nESL applicants who do not meet the benchmark scores in math will be assessed via the proficiency index in math; for English proficiency, ESL applicants will be evaluated in the following way:\n\nESL applicants who do not have a New York State English Regents score will not be assessed via the English proficiency index. They will be required to take Accuplacer ESL to determine English proficiency and appropriate ESL or English course placement.\n\nESL applicants who have a New York State English Regents score will be assessed via the English proficiency index. Those who do not meet the English proficiency index benchmark score will be required to take Accuplacer ESL to determine English proficiency and appropriate ESL or English course placement.\n\nAccuplacer ESL is a computer adaptive test designed for English language learners. The results of the test will be used to determine proficiency and placement so that students may receive the support needed to be successful in their courses. Accuplacer ESL consists of the following five test sections that are taken on a computer:\n\nWriteplacer ESL: is a timed (60 minutes) essay response. Students will read a brief statement and will be asked to write an essay in response to a question. The essay response should be at least 300 words, and students will need to express and develop their opinion or point of view. It is very important that students support their position by providing reasons and examples.\n\nReading Skills: is an untimed, multiple choice test consisting of 20 questions. Students will be given a short reading passage and will need to answer questions related to the reading passage.\n\nLanguage Use: is an untimed, multiple choice test consisting of 20 questions. Students will be asked to fill in the blank with the correct word or phrase and to choose the sentence that best combines two sentences.\n\nListening: is an untimed, multiple choice test consisting of 20 questions. Students will be asked to listen to conversations with multiple speakers presenting different topics, and answer questions about the conversation.\n\nSentence Meaning: is an untimed, multiple choice test consisting of 20 questions. Students will be asked to select the word or phrase that either 1) makes the sentence grammatically correct or 2) indicates that the student understands the meaning or detail presented in the sentence.\n\nThe test sections will be taken in the order that they appear above. Students who achieve a composite score of 105 or higher will meet CUNY’s English proficiency requirements, and will be eligible to enroll in the required college-level English composition course. Students with a composite score below 105 will be placed into the appropriate ESL course, based on their performance on the test. View Accuplacer ESL test preparation resources.\n\nCan students appeal their Accuplacer ESL test results?\n\nStudents cannot appeal their Accuplacer ESL test results. However, students may speak to the college ESL Coordinator if they believe that the course placement is incorrect.\n\nHow will ESL students be notified about scheduling to take Accuplacer ESL?\n\nESL students will be notified about Accuplacer ESL after they have accepted the offer of admission from the college they are planning to attend. The college will send an email with a test appointment or instructions on how to schedule an appointment to take the test. A valid photo identification is required to take the test. Students may not use electronic devices or a dictionary during the test.\n\nCan the TOEFL, IELTS, PTE, DUOLINGO, and other similar exams be used to satisfy CUNY’s English proficiency requirement?\n\nThe TOEFL, IELTS, PTE, Duolingo, and other similar exams are used for admissions purposes only, and cannot be used to satisfy proficiency requirements in English. ESL applicants who do not meet CUNY’s English proficiency requirements will be assessed via the Accuplacer ESL to determine appropriate ESL or English course placement.\n\nHow do students in a top-level ESL developmental course demonstrate proficiency to take college level English courses?\n\nTo pass top-level reading or writing ESL developmental courses, students must have an overall course average of 70% or higher. Course averages are determined by two factors: 65% of the grade is determined by the instructor, based on student performance, and 35% of the grade is determined by the final exam.\n\nWho is required to meet the Ability to Benefit (ATB) testing requirement for NY State Aid eligibility?\n\nAll New York State residents who have a foreign high school diploma are required to meet the New York State ATB standards to be eligible for TAP and NY State Aid. Students are required to meet the scores listed on the following ATB test modules:\n\nReading: a score of 233 or higher\n\nWriting: a score of 235 or higher\n\nArithmetic: a score of 230 or higher\n\nView ATB test preparation resources.\n\nIs it possible to make special arrangements for testing?"
