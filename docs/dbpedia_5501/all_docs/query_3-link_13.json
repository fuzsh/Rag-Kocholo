        "text": "The U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to limit affirmative action in higher education is likely to have the biggest impact on a relatively small group of schools – primarily highly selective private colleges and universities, according to a new Pew Research Center analysis.\n\nWhile there is no comprehensive list of colleges and universities in the United States that consider race and ethnicity as a factor in admissions decisions, many schools report information about themselves in a standard format called the Common Data Set (CDS) and make it available online. Among the items on the CDS is a list of 19 academic and nonacademic factors that might go into a school’s admissions decisions. Schools can rate each factor as, in descending order of significance, “very important,” “important,” “considered” or “not considered.”\n\nWe examined CDS forms from 123 selective colleges and universities – which we defined as those that admit half or fewer of their applicants – to see whether they considered race and ethnicity as a factor in deciding whom to admit, and if so, how significant a factor it was. We only looked at schools that had filled out that portion of the CDS in at least one of the past three academic years.\n\nOf these schools, 74% (91 out of 123) said they did consider race and ethnicity, with 10 of those describing it as an important factor. The vast majority of those schools (82) are private, not-for-profit institutions.\n\nAbout a quarter of the schools we examined (32, or 26%) said they did not consider race and ethnicity at all. Of those, most (22) are public colleges and universities.\n\nRelated: More Americans Disapprove Than Approve of Colleges Considering Race, Ethnicity in Admissions Decisions\n\nAs an earlier Center analysis found, most colleges and universities admit most of the people who apply to them. In the 2021-22 school year, only 202 out of 1,550 four-year colleges and universities admitted half or fewer of the people who applied to them, based on our most recent analysis of data from the federal government’s Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System.\n\nThis analysis about the consideration of race and ethnicity in admissions decisions is limited to public and private not-for-profit institutions that offer bachelor’s degrees and higher credentials, and have published a recent CDS on their website. For more details, refer to the “How we did this” box.\n\nHighly selective and private colleges more likely to consider race and ethnicity\n\nIn general, consideration of race and ethnicity is more common among schools with the lowest admission rates.\n\nIn the Center’s analysis of selective schools with publicly available CDS data, all 24 schools that admit fewer than 10% of applicants say they consider race and ethnicity when deciding whom to admit, although only one rated it as an important factor. And among the 48 schools that admit between 10% and 30% of applicants, all but seven consider race and ethnicity in admissions, with five rating it as an important factor.\n\nBut among the 51 schools that admit between 30% and half of all applicants, just over half (26, or 51%) consider race and ethnicity, and only four call it an important factor. Nearly half of those schools (25, or 49%) say they don’t consider race and ethnicity at all.\n\nAmong the colleges in our study group, the average admissions rate is lower among schools that consider race and ethnicity than among those that don’t (21.7% vs. 37.4%).\n\nAlso, consideration of race and ethnicity is more common for private colleges and universities, at least among the institutions we studied. All but 10 of the 92 private colleges and universities we examined (89%) considered race and ethnicity in deciding whom to admit, with 10 of those ranking it as an important factor.\n\nBut among the 31 public schools, only nine (29%) considered race and ethnicity at all, and none rated it as an important factor. (One partial explanation: Nine of the 22 public schools that don’t consider race and ethnicity in admissions are in California, where voters banned the practice in a 1996 ballot initiative.)\n\nNotably, the schools that rated race and ethnicity as an important factor in admissions decisions had, in aggregate, less diverse student bodies than those that didn’t. In those 10 schools, White students made up nearly 56% of undergraduate enrollment (excluding non-U.S. residents), compared with just over half among schools that said they considered race and ethnicity as one factor among many, and 41% among schools that said they didn’t consider it at all. In that last group of schools, Hispanic students accounted for nearly a quarter of aggregate undergraduate enrollment – largely because the group includes several big public universities in California and Florida with sizable Hispanic student populations."
