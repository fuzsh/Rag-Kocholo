        "text": "Facts\n\nRoth taught at Wisconsin State University for a year as a non-tenured instructor. His contract did not provide him any right to employment with the university after it expired. Roth was not rehired after the year ended, so he sued the university Board of Regents on the grounds that he should have received notice and a hearing. He argued that the absence of these procedures infringed on his property right in his job and his liberty interest in making statements adverse to the university, which he argued were the reason why he was not rehired. He received summary judgment in the lower courts.\n\nOpinions\n\nMajority\n\nPotter Stewart (Author)\n\nWarren Earl Burger\n\nByron Raymond White\n\nHarry Andrew Blackmun\n\nWilliam Hubbs Rehnquist\n\nThere was no apparent incursion on a liberty interest, and the property right was limited to what the contract provided. It lasted only one year, and the property right did not extend to being offered another contract. Future employment does not give rise to a constitutionally protected property interest unless the contract provides for it. The university did not need to offer notice or a hearing.\n\nDissent\n\nThurgood Marshall (Author)\n\nTo comply with due process requirements, the university should have told the professor why it did not rehire him for the following term. This would alleviate the risk that a state entity might act capriciously or unreasonably toward its employees. An employee may not be terminated for any reason, or for no reason, if the contract does not guarantee future employment. Property rights extend to government jobs, and any person may receive a government job unless the government has a reason to deny it. The university would not be overly burdened by briefly outlining the reasons why a certain employee is terminated or not offered future employment.\n\nDissent\n\nWilliam Orville Douglas (Author)\n\nDissent\n\nWilliam Joseph Brennan, Jr. (Author)\n\nWilliam Orville Douglas\n\nConcurrence\n\nWarren Earl Burger (Author)\n\nCase Commentary\n\nAlthough the outcome in this case seems relatively intuitive, its extensive discussion of the doctrine on procedural due process can guide courts on many decisions that are less straightforward because of the clear rules that it establishes for finding liberty and property rights."
