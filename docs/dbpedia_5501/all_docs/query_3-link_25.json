        "text": "Go to Alphabetical Topic Index\n\nWelcome to Pepperdine University. Pepperdine is a Christian university committed to the highest standards of academic excellence and Christian values, where students are strengthened for lives of purpose, service and leadership. As an employee of Pepperdine, you are instrumental in supporting this mission of the University. We hope that you find your position with Pepperdine rewarding, challenging, and fulfilling.\n\nThe purpose of the Pepperdine University Policy Manual (the \"Manual\") is to acquaint its employees with its employment policies, procedures, standards, and benefits. The Manual answers many common questions about employment at Pepperdine, but cannot anticipate every situation or answer every question. If you need additional information or have any questions, please consult with your supervisor or Human Resources.\n\nNothing contained in this Manual or any other materials distributed by Pepperdine constitutes or creates a contract of employment between Pepperdine and any employee or creates any contractual obligation of any kind whatsoever.\n\nPepperdine reserves the right to change, cancel, or eliminate at any time, any of its employment policies, procedures, guidelines, standards, or benefits, whether or not they are referenced in this Manual. All Pepperdine employees are encouraged to make sure that they have, and are responsible for obtaining, up-to-date information regarding their employment.\n\nThe employment relationship at Pepperdine is based on the mutual consent of the employee and the University. Accordingly, either the employee or the University can terminate the employment relationship, at will, with or without cause, at any time during the employment relationship. The only exception is when a different relationship is set forth in an individualized written employment agreement between the employee and the University, signed by an authorized University representative.\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nSECTION 1 EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY EMPLOYER\n\n1.1 GENERAL POLICY STATEMENT\n\n1.1.A.

- EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY EMPLOYER\n\n1.1 GENERAL POLICY STATEMENT\n\nPepperdine is an Equal Employment Opportunity Employer and does not unlawfully discriminate on the basis of any status or condition protected by applicable federal, state, or local law. Pepperdine is committed to providing a work environment free from all forms of harassment and discrimination. Engaging in unlawful discrimination or harassment will result in appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal from the University.\n\nPepperdine is religiously affiliated with the Churches of Christ. It is the purpose of Pepperdine to pursue the very highest employment and academic standards within a context which celebrates and extends the spiritual and ethical ideals of the Christian faith. While students, faculty, staff and members of the Board of Regents represent many religious backgrounds, Pepperdine reserves the right to seek, hire and promote persons who support the goals and mission of the institution, including the right to prefer co-religionists.\n\nIt is the intent of the University to create and promote a diverse work force consistent with its stated goals and mission.\n\n1.1.A NOTICE TO APPLICANTS AND EMPLOYEES\n\nAll University employment application forms shall refer to the University's Equal Employment Opportunity Employer policy (the \"EEO Policy\"). Further, all applicants for employment shall be requested, but not required, to submit an Applicant Data Record (addressing the applicant's race, gender and age). The Applicant Data Record shall not be made available to those making hiring or employment decisions. Such information shall be used only by Human Resources in performing statistical analysis in order to ensure that the EEO Policy is respected.\n\n1.1.B DEVELOPMENT\n\nThe University commits to providing resources each year for providing programs, workshops and/or seminars to its employees in order to further the EEO Policy.\n\n1.2 ADVERTISEMENT AND RECRUITING SOURCES\n\nAll University advertisements shall include the phrase \"Equal Opportunity Employer\" or \"EOE.\" The University will endeavor to utilize recruiting resources likely to produce a diverse pool of applicants. Human Resources may periodically analyze the performance of any and all employment recruiting resources.\n\n1.2.A COMMITTEES\n\nWhere a committee is involved in hiring and/or promotion, all reasonable efforts shall be made to ensure a diverse composition of the committee.\n\n1.3 RESPONSIBILITIES OF HUMAN RESOURCES\n\nHuman Resources shall be available to any employee who desires to discuss possible violations of the EEO Policy. Where so informed, or otherwise on notice of any possible violation(s) of the EEO Policy, Human Resources shall take such steps as it believes necessary or appropriate to resolve any failures to comply with the EEO Policy.\n\nHuman Resources shall have the authority to request and receive any and all information from University departments regarding all matters affecting the University's EEO Policy, including but not limited to new appointments, promotions, transfers, terminations, and complaints of discrimination and their final dispositions.\n\nGo to Alphabetical Topic Index\n\nGo to Table of Contents\n\nSection 2 - JOB POSTING/APPLICATION PROCESS\n\n2.1 OVERVIEW\n\nAll full-time academic and nonacademic positions, except those designated below, shall be posted a minimum of five working days before a final selection and appointment is made. Positions may be designated for promotion from within (See also: TRANSITIONS). Human Resources will be responsible for the posting of staff job notices on https://jobs.pepperdine.edu as soon as practical after receiving notice of the availability of the position.\n\nExceptions to the above shall include faculty, librarian and student positions; temporary and part-time positions; certain program positions which fall outside the normal scope of operations; positions requiring a unique, specialized skill set and/or location (pre-approved by the Chief Operating Officer's Office); positions into which current employees are to be demoted; certain reevaluations not involving a major change in duties, reporting level, or salary; transitions resulting from reorganizations at the level of vice-president or above; and major administrative positions reporting to the vice-presidential level or above which call for compensation of $60,000 per year or more. In the latter two cases, the Chief Operating Officer's Office is to be notified prior to implementing such changes.\n\n2.2 JOB POSTINGS\n\nOpen positions are posted on the Pepperdine University website at https://jobs.pepperdine.edu. The site is maintained by Human Resources.\n\nAll job postings indicate the \"open for hire date\" before which no final applicant selection or hiring decision may be made.\n\nAdvertisements in newspapers, professional journals, and internet job boards are posted upon request and are the financial responsibility of the hiring department. All advertisements and job postings must include an approved statement that the University is an Equal Opportunity Employer and comply with all applicable laws.\n\n2.3 APPLICATION PROCESSING\n\nApplications for posted positions must be submitted on https://jobs.pepperdine.edu for an applicant to be considered.\n\nApplications meeting the minimum posted qualifications will be made available to the hiring manager for consideration. The hiring manager is responsible for contacting applicants directly to arrange for interviews.\n\nHiring supervisors shall check references on all final candidates interviewed before a hiring decision is finalized (i.e. it is permissible to make an offer of employment contingent upon a successful reference check). Applicant permission to check references should be obtained prior to contacting references. When considering an internal applicant, please contact Human Resources to review applicant files.\n\n2.4 BACKGROUND SCREENING\n\n2.4.A NEW EMPLOYEES\n\nPepperdine requires background screenings on all individuals prior to employment as well as existing faculty and staff prior to transfer or promotion[1]. Department supervisors or their designee shall serve as the point person for the department's background screening process in collaboration with Human Resources. Department supervisors are responsible for the screening process for their area, including maintaining and destroying the confidential results and ensuring compliance with University policy, and state and federal laws. Offers of employment are to be made contingent on the applicant consenting to and passing the background screening process. Applicants will initially be notified of the background screening requirement by the online job posting which will include language consistent with University policy. If a background check screening is still in progress on the employee's start date, the employee may begin working with the understanding that their continued employment is contingent upon successful completion of the check.\n\nIf a background screen report yields negative information, the candidate will have the opportunity to contest any reporting inaccuracies with the University's background screening provider. If the negative information is correct, the department supervisor will consult with General Counsel and/or Human Resources regarding future employment decisions for the individual based on the position specifics.\n\n[1] Faculty promotions are defined as promotions from teaching into administrative roles, such as transitions to assistant dean, associate dean, dean, or division chair.\n\n2.4.B EXISTING EMPLOYEES\n\nDepartment supervisors may require background screenings on an individual or an entire department at any time as long as there is a legitimate business reason to do so. Prior to performing background screenings on current employees or entire departments, department supervisors should consult General Counsel or Human Resources.\n\nIf a background screen report yields negative information, the employee will have the opportunity to contest any reporting inaccuracies with the University's background screening provider. If the negative information is correct, the department supervisor will consult with General Counsel and Human Resources regarding employment decisions for the individual based on the position specifics.\n\nLegitimate business reasons to conduct a background screening include all lawful reasons. Examples of legitimate business reasons would include, but are not limited to: access to cash, checks, raw materials or inventory with a marketable street value, donor lists, or other proprietary information; access to residences, offices or personal property; and when required by law.\n\n2.4.C EMPLOYEES OF THIRD-PARTY VENDORS\n\nEmployees of third-party vendors who are assigned to University campuses for their regular shifts shall have background checks conducted by their employer prior to reporting to work at a Pepperdine campus. Vendors include but are not limited to security firms, bookstores, housekeeping, and catering services. The Pepperdine manager responsible for the contract with the third-party vendor must have discretion regarding whether negative information from the screening precludes assignment of a third-party employee to Pepperdine.\n\n2.4.D ALL EMPLOYEES\n\nThere may be rare occasions that require employment without contingency of an applicant successfully passing a background screening; in these situations the department supervisor must obtain express written consent from the Provost or Chief Operating Officer.\n\n2.4.E DEFINITIONS\n\nEmployees include faculty and staff, whether part-time or full-time, regular, contract or restricted, exempt or non-exempt.\n\nHuman Resources maintains a clerical temporary pool and assumes responsibility for background screenings of those employees. Supervisors of all other temporary employees will decide whether background check screenings are appropriate.\n\nNegative information is any information that would have the potential to impact an employment decision. This may include, but is not limited to, convictions, inaccurate previous employment or education data, etc.\n\n2.4.F PROCEDURES\n\nThe information requested on the screening must be job and/or business related. For University employees, department supervisors are to have access to the results and associated documentation. Background screenings shall meet the minimum standards described in the Background Check Guidelines in Human Resources. The department supervisors shall attend training and sign the Human Resources Confidentiality Agreement. Background screening content shall remain confidential and shared only when legitimate business needs warrant it.\n\nPlease contact Human Resources at (310) 506-4397 for further information, training and best practices.\n\nPolicy approved by the University Management Committee on February 16, 2012.\n\n2.5 HIRING\n\nWhen a final hiring decision is made, the hiring manager should make a job offer and a salary offer within the range (if any) that has already been approved. If a supervisor wishes to offer a higher salary, he or she must obtain appropriate approval BEFORE discussing the possibility with the job candidate.\n\nTo be placed on the payroll, a new hire must show proof of legal right to be employed in the United States by completing an I-9 form and must complete a W-4 form within the first 3 days of employment. (See also: NEW EMPLOYEES)\n\nGo to Alphabetical Topic Index\n\nGo to Table of Contents\n\nSection 3 - EMPLOYEE CATEGORIES\n\n3.1 REGULAR STAFF\n\nA regular staff position is normally an ongoing position. An end date is not usually set at time of hire, although either the University or the employee may terminate the employment relationship at will at any time.\n\n3.2 RESTRICTED POSITIONS\n\n\"Restricted\" refers to a position which has been approved for a limited period rather than on an ongoing basis, and whose incumbent will qualify for all the benefits of regular employment. Generally, a position will be designated \"restricted\" if the duration of the initial approval exceeds the normal, three-month term for a temporary position.\n\n3.3 TEMPORARY STAFF\n\nA temporary employee is one who is hired on an \"as needed\" basis for completion of a specific task or project or due to the temporary absence of a regular employee. Temporary assignments are approved for limited periods of time, usually up to three months.\n\nStaff benefits are not granted, with the exception of sick leave. Temporary employees will accrue sick leave at the rate of one hour of sick leave for every 30 hours worked up to a maximum of 24 hours per calendar year.\n\nTemporary positions do not require posting, but if requested by the hiring manager, Human Resources will post temporary job openings. Human Resources offers an in-house temporary staffing service to assist with your immediate or short-term clerical employment needs. If temporary staffing needs are urgent or involve highly specialized skills which suggest the advisability of turning to an agency, agency fees are the responsibility of the hiring department.\n\nTo request service, please contact Human Resources. The University discourages the use of temporary employment agencies.\n\n3.4 STUDENT WORKERS\n\nA student worker is defined as an individual whose employment is incidental to the pursuit of a full-time course of study at the University. Individuals who have been admitted to the University, are enrolled at least part time during an academic year as defined by the school or college, and are simultaneously employed in a student position will be classified as student workers. Such employees will be considered staff members only when they fill approved regular full-time positions requiring a minimum of 30 hours per week, and when their class schedules do not conflict with their regular working hours. Student employees are not eligible for staff benefits.\n\nStudent workers will accrue sick leave at the rate of one hour of sick leave for every 30 hours worked up to a maximum of 24 hours per calendar year. Student workers unable to report to work due to illness or injury should notify their supervisor before the scheduled start of their work, if possible. The supervisor must also be contacted on each additional day of absence. Student workers who must miss work because of emergencies or other unexpected circumstances must notify their supervisor as soon as possible. Any injury or illness that requires a student worker to leave work during the work day must be immediately reported to the supervisor.\n\n3.5 FULL-TIME STAFF\n\nA full-time employee is one who works 30 hours or more per week and is hired to fill an approved regular full-time staff position.\n\nFull benefits are available to regular full-time employees working 40 or more hours per week. Except as otherwise noted, prorated benefits are available to regular full-time employees who are approved to work at least 30, but less than 40, hours per week.\n\nRegular full-time employees changing to part-time status may be continued under the Group Health Plan for a limited period of time. Contact Human Resources for details.\n\n3.6 NINE TO TWELVE MONTH POSITIONS\n\nIt is recognized that some staffing needs are greater during the academic year. Accordingly, positions may be designated as \"9 to 12 month\" positions, typically with assignments extending from August through April. The University will continue medical benefits and other insurance contributions during the three non-worked months for incumbents of such positions with assignments of at least 30 hours per week. Affected employees are responsible for any dependent coverage payments. For employee recognition purposes, a full year of service will be credited for each year of service in a 9 to12 month position.\n\nTo qualify as a 9 to 12 month position, a job must be initially created as such or modified to that status by Human Resources.\n\nFor employees to receive benefits continuation for the non-worked months, they must be given written offers of continued employment for the period immediately following the summer months.\n\n3.7 PART-TIME STAFF\n\nA regular part-time staff employee is one who works in a regular staff position less than 30 hours per week.\n\nRegular part-time staff who work 20 or more hours per week are eligible for the following benefits on a prorated basis when approved by the administration: prorated sick leave, vacation, holiday pay, and time off due to death in the family. Part-time staff employees who work fewer than 20 hours per week will be eligible for prorated sick leave and holiday pay only. Participation in the Retirement Plan will be made available providing all eligibility criteria are met.\n\n3.8 EXEMPT STAFF\n\nExempt employees are generally defined to be those who:\n\nmeet state and federal earnings tests (two times the state minimum wage based on a 40-hour work week); and\n\nare employed in positions that are professional, executive, or administrative as determined by Pepperdine.\n\n3.9 NONEXEMPT STAFF\n\nNonexempt employees are generally defined to be those who are:\n\npaid on an hourly basis;\n\nsubject to payment for overtime; and\n\nentitled to break (or \"rest\") periods and lunch periods as prescribed by State and Federal regulations (NOTE: while these regulations specify two ten-minute breaks per day, the University grants breaks of 15 minutes).\n\n3.10 MULTIPLE POSITIONS\n\nShould an employee accept more than one staff or student position, the regularly assigned schedule of work may not exceed 40 hours per week.\n\n3.11 STATUS CHANGE: EFFECTS OF\n\nIf an employee's status changes from part-time to full-time the employee should receive an explanation of any change in benefits. The employee must contact Human Resources and sign a statement that applicable benefits have been explained.\n\n3.12 ACTING STATUS\n\n\"Acting\" refers to a regular employee being hired to temporarily fill a vacant position. The employee retains all of the benefits of regular status. Depending on the agreement by which the employee transferred out of his or her prior assignment into the \"acting\" position, the end of the temporary assignment will involve a return to the former position, transfer to another position, or termination of employment due to \"end of assignment.\"\n\nGo to Alphabetical Topic Index\n\nGo to Table of Contents\n\nSection 4 VOLUNTEERS\n\n4.1 OVERVIEW\n\nThe University has benefited immeasurably over the years by the services of volunteers. Appreciative of these special friends of the University and aware of the legal ramifications of volunteer service, the University has adopted this policy to protect both the interests of the University and of the volunteers. The following does not govern or restrict the activities of on or off-campus service organizations or students who provide services closely related to their educational goals or otherwise assist departments to fulfill degree requirements.\n\n4.2 VOLUNTEER ASSIGNMENT\n\nPersons appropriately qualified, who wish to perform a service to the University without remuneration, may be recommended to an appointment. Such appointments are without salary or benefits and successive reappointments do not confer tenure or any continuing or other employment status. Appointment and reappointment are at the discretion of the department or school. Regular staff employees who accept volunteer appointments will be limited to volunteer assignments outside of the department of primary responsibility and income, and their regular employment duties must be dissimilar to those of the volunteer position.\n\n4.3 PROCEDURES\n\nBefore starting an assignment, a volunteer should be directed to Human Resources for completion of necessary documentation and issuance of an I.D. card.\n\nIt is the supervisor's responsibility to provide appropriate task instruction and orientation to the campus, and to ensure that the volunteered service continues to be a positive contribution to the efforts of the University. It is also the supervisor's responsibility to notify Human Resources in writing when a volunteer terminates his or her assignment. No notice or administrative approval is required for either the supervisor or the volunteer to end the volunteer relationship. Additionally, it is the supervisor's responsibility to ensure volunteers follow all University policies as well as all relevant safety precautions related to the volunteer duties.\n\nVolunteers may not operate University vehicles.\n\nGo to Alphabetical Topic Index\n\nGo to Table of Contents\n\nSection 5 - PEPPERDINE PROHIBITS UNLAWFUL EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION AND HARASSMENT\n\nAs stated above in the EEO Policy (Section 1), Pepperdine prohibits unlawful discrimination and harassment. This policy includes conduct that occurs on Pepperdine's campus, while traveling on University business, or at University related social functions, whether on or off campus. The University does not tolerate unlawful discrimination and harassment of its employees by vendors, guests and other visitors to campus.\n\n5.1 UNLAWFUL DISCRIMINATION AND HARASSMENT DEFINED\n\nDiscrimination\n\nUnlawful discrimination may occur when an employee is treated less favorably with respect to the terms and conditions of employment because of his or her membership in a protected class. Terms and conditions of employment include but are not limited to decisions relating to recruitment, hiring, promotion, transfers, termination, and benefits.\n\nHarassment\n\nUnlawful harassment includes verbal, physical or visual conduct when the conduct creates an intimidating, offensive or hostile working environment, or unreasonably interferes with job performance, when directed at an employee because of the employee's membership in a protected class. Verbal harassment may include but is not limited to epithets, derogatory comments, or slurs. Physical harassment may include but is not limited to assault, impeding or blocking movement, or any physical interference with normal work or movement. Visual forms of harassment may include but are not limited to derogatory posters, cartoons or drawings.\n\nSexual Misconduct\n\nSexual misconduct includes sex discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking, as defined in the University's Sexual Misconduct Policy and under other applicable laws.\n\nA. Romantic Relationships\n\nPepperdine wishes to promote positive relations among employees and to avoid conflicts of interest, misunderstandings, the appearance of favoritism, possible claims of sexual harassment, and the diminished morale and dissension among employees that may result from romantic relationships between its employees. Romantic relationships between supervisors and employees within the same direct reporting line are strongly discouraged. Employees involved in romantic relationships bear responsibility for the negative consequences that may arise out of such relationships and may be subject to disciplinary action, including but not limited to, termination of employment.\n\nB. Sexual Harassment Prevention Awareness-Raising Education Program\n\nAll employees are required to regularly participate in the University's Sexual Harassment Prevention Awareness-Raising Education Program. At its discretion, the University may require its employees to engage in other similar programs.\n\n5.2 DISABILITY ACCOMMODATION\n\nAn employee requiring accommodation should notify his or her supervisor or Human Resources in writing as soon as the need for accommodation becomes known to the employee. Pepperdine takes all such requests seriously and will promptly determine whether the employee is a qualified individual with a disability and will engage in an interactive process to determine whether a reasonable accommodation exists which would allow the employee to perform the essential functions of the job without imposing an undue hardship on the University or other employees.\n\n5.3 RETALIATION PROHIBITED\n\nPepperdine prohibits and does not tolerate retaliation against any employee who in good faith files a complaint of unlawful discrimination, harassment, failure to accommodate or is involved as a witness or participant in the complaint or investigation process. Engaging in unlawful retaliation will result in disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal from the University.\n\n5.4 COMPLAINT PROCEDURE\n\nThe University encourages any employee who feels that he or she has been subject to, or is otherwise aware of, unlawful discrimination, harassment, failure to accommodate or retaliation, to report the incident immediately. Please refer to Section 31.1 Employee Grievance Procedure for instructions on how to file a complaint.\n\nIn addition to the reporting avenues discussed in the Employee Grievance Procedure, employees aware of any incidents of sexual misconduct (including sex discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking), should report such incidents to the University Title IX Coordinator. Information regarding the University Title IX Coordinator is located on the University's website at https://community.pepperdine.edu/title-ix/. Complaints of sexual harassment may be handled under the University's Sexual Misconduct Policy or any other policy or procedure the University deems appropriate.\n\nThe University encourages individuals to immediately bring any concerning behavior to the University's attention even if such behavior does not constitute unlawful discrimination, harassment, failure to accommodate or retaliation to Human Resources.\n\nSupervisors are required to immediately report any potential incidents of unlawful discrimination, harassment, failure to accommodate or retaliation to Human Resources.\n\n5.5 SAFE AND SECURE WORKPLACE\n\nPepperdine is committed to providing a safe and secure workplace for its employees. The University will not tolerate any type of workplace violence committed by or against employees. Workplace violence is defined as any act of violence or threat of violence that occurs in a place of employment (not including lawful acts of self-defense or defense of others)\n\nViolating this policy will result in disciplinary action up to and including dismissal and may also result in criminal prosecution. The University reserves the right to take all immediate action that it determines is necessary to prevent or mitigate a perceived threat or act of workplace violence. Actions including stay-away orders, interim leaves of absence, and work from home, may be taken by the University, with or without notice or cause.\n\nAll employees and supervisors must immediately report all acts of workplace violence or threats of workplace violence which they have witnessed, received, or have been told that another person has witnessed or received, to the Pepperdine Department of Public Safety, immediate supervisor, Dean's office, or to Human Resources. The University maintains a Threat Assessment Team to evaluate, investigate, and respond to all credible threats or incidents of violence. Please see additional details and resources in the Workplace Violence Prevention Plan.\n\nThis policy prohibits retaliation or harassment against anyone who makes a good faith report of a violation of this policy. The University also prohibits individuals from making intentionally false or misleading reports of violence or threats of violence. Individuals who make such reports will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including dismissal under the University's disciplinary policies.\n\nApproved by the University Management Committee (UMC) on July 18, 2024\n\n5.6 MANDATED REPORTER OF CHILD ABUSE\n\nCalifornia law identifies several categories of individuals who are considered \"mandated reporters\" of child abuse and neglect. Such employees, as a term and condition of employment at the University, are required to sign a Mandated Reporter Acknowledgement Form, which discusses the employee's legal obligations.\n\nApproved by UMC: 3/23/2021\n\nGo to Alphabetical Topic Index\n\nGo to Table of Contents\n\nSection 6 - PERSONAL APPEARANCE AND CONDUCT\n\n6.1 PERSONAL APPEARANCE AND PROFESSIONAL ATTIRE\n\nPersonal appearance and professional attire is necessary to fulfill the mission of the University. Each employee is responsible to convey a professional image to all Pepperdine community members through his or her contact with others. Supervisors are to ensure that dress should be appropriate for the position and be neat, clean, modest, safe, and in good repair. All employees are expected to exercise appropriate hygiene and respect the reasonable sensibilities of coworkers.\n\nFor positions that require it, all Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) must be worn at all times to ensure employee safety. Departments may have their own dress code relevant to the work function.\n\n6.2 CONDUCT\n\nIn harmony with its Christian philosophy and purposes, the University expects the highest standard of moral and ethical behavior from all of its employees within the course and scope of their employment.\n\nThe expectations include, but are not limited to:\n\nhonesty;\n\nsobriety;\n\ndependability;\n\nfollowing established procedures and regulations;\n\nprompt compliance with all requirements and lawful orders or directions of supervisors;\n\ntreating everyone with respect and dignity and generally assuming goodwill;\n\nappropriately raising concerns with one's supervisor;\n\nefficiency in performance of the job;\n\nabstaining from the use of vulgar or offensive language;\n\navoiding conduct that may bring reproach or embarrassment to the University; and\n\nawareness of how one's conduct may reflect upon the University's Christian mission and reputation.\n\nWhile no attempt will be made to intrude on the purely personal and private lives of employees, any employee whose conduct and performance does not comply with the above stated expectations may be subject to discipline, including suspension or immediate dismissal, without prior notice.\n\nThe following general rules of conduct while on University property have been established. The points below are only examples of conduct and do not comprise an exclusive list of conduct that may lead to discipline up to and including dismissal:\n\nreporting for work, or working under, the influence of liquor, drugs, or narcotics (as specified by the Food and Drug Administration);\n\nuse, sale, or possession of intoxicating liquors, narcotics, or abuse of prescription drugs;\n\nintentionally falsifying records;\n\nsleeping on the job;\n\nunauthorized removal of property belonging to the University, its employees, students, or guests;\n\ninciting, or attempting to incite, others by word or action to the use of violence; or threats of, actual violence;\n\nillegal gambling;\n\nsmoking in \"No Smoking\" areas;\n\npossessing or carrying firearms, weapons, or explosives;\n\nany deliberate or negligent destruction or misuse of equipment, property, or material;\n\nfrequent tardiness or unauthorized absence from work station;\n\ninsubordination;\n\nfailure to report absences, or reporting them improperly (applies to employees and/or their supervisors); or\n\nother \"failures of good behavior\" not mentioned specifically above which are not in concert with the University's Christian mission or are covered in other University instructions and regulations or federal, state, or local laws.\n\nEmployees are expected to be good stewards of University resources and hold operational costs to a minimum. Supplies should be used with care and never removed from University property unless in transit to another Pepperdine location.\n\nFurther, employees remain employed at will at all times and employment may be terminated by either the employer or employee without cause or notice.\n\n6.3 PERSONAL TELEPHONE CALLS\n\nThe unreasonable use of University telephones for personal calls is prohibited.\n\n6.4 CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n\nThe relationship between the University and its employees is one of trust, and all employees should avoid conflicts of interest and commitment.\n\nEmployees should not have direct or indirect interests or commitments, financial or otherwise, which conflict with the proper discharge of University duties. The primary professional allegiance of all employees lies with the University and the advancement of its mission. Employees should not solicit or accept any gift, service, or favor that might reasonably influence the discharge of their duties or that they know or should know is being offered with the intent to influence their official conduct. Employees should not accept other employment or engage in business or professional activities outside of the University when such work might reasonably cause real or apparent conflicts of interest or conflicts of commitment. Employees should not transact business in their official capacity with any business or entity of which employees or their Family Members are an officer, agent, or member, or in which the University owns a substantial interest, without the explicit prior knowledge and approval of the appropriate senior administrator. \"Family Member\" means a person's spouse, significant other, ancestors, children, grandchildren, great grandchildren, siblings (whether by whole or half-blood), and the spouses of children, grandchildren, great grandchildren, and siblings.\n\n6.4.A DEFINITIONS AND EXAMPLES\n\nA conflict exists when a University representative's direct or indirect personal interests are inconsistent with or interfere in any way with the best interests of the University. An institutional conflict may also exist when the University's mission could be compromised by an external relationship held at the institutional level. There are generally two types of conflicts: conflicts of interest and conflicts of commitment.\n\nA conflict of interest exists when an employee has an interest that affects or provides an incentive to affect the employee's conduct of his or her University responsibilities. Examples of conflicts of interest include:\n\nOwning or acquiring a financial interest in any business entity that supplies goods, services, or finances to the University when the employee has decision-making authority for those transactions.\n\nUsing University property or facilities in a way that may result in personal financial gain to an employee or an employee's family member.\n\nUsing University facilities or an employee's position at the University, to advocate, endorse or market a product or endorse or render a service, unless done in conjunction with an employee's University duties, and for the University's benefit.\n\nAccepting a charitable gift that is contingent upon the outcome of any research or business transaction conducted by the University (an institutional conflict of interest).\n\nA conflict of commitment exists when the commitment to unrelated job activities adversely affects an employee's capacity to meet University responsibilities. An example of a conflict of commitment is an employee's inability to timely meet University assigned deadlines as a result of providing services to another employer.\n\n6.4.B DISCLOSURE AND OBLIGATION\n\nEmployees should disclose conflicts of interest or commitment to the appropriate supervisor or senior administrator as soon as possible after they realize that a conflict may arise or currently exists.\n\nIn addition, on an annual basis, by no later than March 31st, each University employee that holds: (i) a title that includes \"director,\" (ii) requisition approver status, or (iii) a University issued credit card, is required to complete a Conflict of Interest and Outside Activities reporting form.\n\nEmployees shall include on the annual reporting form:\n\nThe amounts and sources of all outside earned income in excess of $1,000 from any one source earned while employed by the University during the preceding calendar year, and the amount of time spent to earn this income.\n\nIncome they received from any trust, partnership, limited liability company, corporation or other entity for which they are a trustee, beneficiary, director, officer, employee, or agent thereof, and holds 10% or more ownership interest therein. \"Ownership\" means voting power in a corporation, a proprietary interest in a partnership, limited liability company or similar entity, or interest in a trust as trustee or beneficiary.\n\n\"Any income received, directly or indirectly, by any of their Family Members from the University (other than wages earned as a University employee). For example, if an employee's spouse or child owns a company that does business with the University, the employee should disclose that income.\n\nWhether they or a Family Member has any investments made in conjunction with, or a business relationship with other University employees, Regents, or persons or companies doing business with the University.\n\n6.4.C PROCESS FOR RESOLVING POTENTIAL AND ACTUAL CONFLICTS\n\nThe annual disclosures will be reviewed in the first instance by the Executive Vice President, General Counsel, and President. Disclosures that indicate a potential conflict shall be forwarded to the appropriate senior administrator for action.\n\nThe senior administrator or his or her delegate (e.g. dean or department head) will review the conflict with the employee, and conduct a careful assessment of whether a particular activity or relationship is acceptable, unacceptable, or requires further review by the senior administrator.\n\nIn some cases, resolution of a conflict will mean eliminating the conflict altogether. In other cases, appropriate management may allow the situation to go forward with assurances that the integrity of the University will be protected. The latter situation may require ongoing review, monitoring, and documentation by the senior administrator. Adequate written evidence of the conflict's resolution must be filed with the annual disclosure form in the Executive Vice President's office.\n\nViolation of this policy shall subject the employee to disciplinary action, which may include, among others, reimbursement to the University of all profits or benefits obtained, demotion, suspension, and termination.\n\n6.5 OFFICER AND EMPLOYEE SERVICE AS FIDUCIARIES\n\nAn individual officer and/or employee of Pepperdine University is occasionally requested or appointed to serve as a trustee, personal representative, administrator, administratrix, executor, executrix, conservator, guardian or other fiduciary (including, but not limited to investment or financial advisor) for a person who is, or who may reasonably be expected to become, a significant financial contributor to the University. Such requests and appointments may arise because of the personal relationship that may develop between the individual and an officer or employee while acting as the University's representative. Service as a fiduciary presents a substantial possibility for a conflict of interest between the fiduciary's duties of care and loyalty toward a contributor or his or her estate, on the one hand, and the obligations of the officer or employee to the University, on the other hand. In addition, such service may result in legal liability on the part of the University for the acts and omissions of the fiduciary.\n\nThe University has adopted this policy in order to minimize any conflict of interest and exposure to legal liability.\n\n6.5.A DEFINITIONS\n\nAs used herein, the following terms shall have the meanings specified:\n\n\"Applicable Officer or Employee\" means senior officers of the University and all other employees serving in a fund-raising capacity.\n\n\"Family Member\" means any spouse, domestic partner, child, grandchild, parent, grandparent, brother, sister, brother-in-law or sister-in-law.\n\n\"Fiduciary Position\" means the office of the trustee, personal representative, administrator, administratrix, executor, executrix, conservator, guardian or other fiduciary,(including but not limited to investment or financial advisor), whether such office is created by private agreement, appointment, court order otherwise, in any jurisdiction.\n\n\"Proscribed Fiduciary Position\" means a Fiduciary Position with respect to:\n\na Substantial Contributor;a trust as to which Substantial Contributor is a settlor or beneficiary; or the estate of a Substantial Contributor.\n\n\"Substantial Contributor\" means any individual (other than a Family Member) who has contributed, or may reasonably be expected to contribute, by inter vivos gifts or testamentary disposition, in excess of $50,000 to the University or any of its affiliates.\n\n6.5.B NO SOLICITATION\n\nExcept as authorized pursuant to Section 5.5.3 no Applicable Officer or Employee of the University shall solicit any appointment to, accept any appointment to or continue in a Proscribed Fiduciary Position whether or not such Proscribed Fiduciary Position requires any time during the normal working hours of such officer or employee. Any Applicable Officer or Employee who is requested or gains knowledge of an appointment or prospective appointment to serve in a Proscribed Fiduciary Position shall give prompt written notice of such request or appointment to the Senior Vice President for Advancement and Public Affairs.\n\nAny Applicable Officer or Employee who violates this policy, or any part of it, shall be subject to discipline up to and including termination.\n\n6.5.C EXCEPTIONS\n\nA strong presumption exists that an Applicable Officer or Employee should not serve in any Proscribed Fiduciary Position. Nevertheless, an Applicable Officer or Employee may serve in a Proscribed Fiduciary Position, but only upon the satisfaction of all of the following conditions:\n\nSuch officer or employee shall request in writing to the Senior Vice President for Advancement and Public Affairs that the general policy be waived. Such request shall set forth the following information:\n\nThe circumstances in which the request or appointment to serve in the Proscribed Fiduciary Position arose.\n\nThe reasons why service in such Proscribed Fiduciary Position (i) is in the University's interests and (ii) will not present a significant possibility for conflict of interest and legal liability to the University.\n\nA description of how such officer or employee will act to minimize conflicts of interest and commitment and legal liability to the University.\n\nAn acknowledgement that the Substantial Contributor has been informed of (i) the University's policy, (ii) the possibility for conflicts of interest to arise during the term of service in the Proscribed Fiduciary Position, and (iii) the advisability that the Substantial Contributor consider the appointment of the other persons (including trust companies, Family Members and the University) to serve in the Fiduciary Position.\n\nIf possible, the Substantial Contributor shall have given his or her informed written consent to the service of such officer or employee in such Proscribed Fiduciary Position.\n\nSuch officer or employee shall agree to serve in the Proscribed Fiduciary Position with all care, skill, diligence and loyalty required by applicable law and consistent with the standards set forth in Section 6.5.D\n\nAll compensation earned by such officer or employee, whether in the form of statutory fees, trustee fees, court awards or otherwise, in excess of unreimbursed expenses actually, reasonably and directly incurred by such officer or employee in the course of serving and substantiated by proper receipts, shall belong to and shall promptly be paid to the University. In cases where it is clear that the individual officer or employee is spending material additional time in excess of their normal workload in carrying out fiduciary duties, the supervising officer over such officer or employee may elect to allocate up to one-half of the fiduciary fee to the individual as supplemental one-time compensation, which does not carry with it any fringe benefits.\n\nThe University may impose other conditions upon any exception to the general policy, as the University may deem appropriate in the circumstances.\n\nEach exception to the general policy shall be within the discretion of the University. A waiver in one instance shall not constitute a waiver in any other instance or circumstance. No exception shall be effective unless and until communicated in writing to the officer or employee requesting such exception.\n\n6.5.D STANDARDS FOR SERVICE AS A FIDUCIARY\n\nA person serving in a Fiduciary Position should observe the following standards:\n\n(1) Bonding or Insurance. The officer or employee acting as an executor, trustee or other fiduciary should communicate such capacity to the Insurance and Risk Management department and ensure that the University is carrying a fiduciary bond or liability insurance in an amount that will protect the estate or trust and its beneficiaries from any misappropriation, misapplication of fiduciary funds, or other insurable loss. Custodian arrangements with a fiscally sound financial institution may alternatively be explored. Otherwise, significant personal liability (covering any loss or depreciation) may arise due to breach of fiduciary duty.\n\n(2) Competence. All fiduciaries must be competent by training and experience to serve in such capacity, and should undertake continuing education to maintain and update knowledge in this area.\n\n(3) Support Service. All fiduciaries must have adequate support personnel and services available to properly and efficiently render recording, accounting, tax and investment services.\n\n(4) Audit Review. An independent audit or adequate internal control procedures should be made of trusts, estates or other accounts on a random and periodic basis.\n\n(5) Accounting. Upon reasonable request from any estate, trust or account beneficiary, a fiduciary must provide a detailed written accounting of account transactions and obligations. Automatic annual accountings to every beneficiary are recommended for all accounts, and required by law for many trusts.\n\n(6) Exoneration. Wills, trusts or other instruments governing administration should generally not include exculpatory provisions which would relieve the officer or employee of malpractice or misfeasance liability, unless the instrument is carefully reviewed by independent counsel representing the creator of the instrument.\n\n(7) Fees. Fee information is often specifically contained within the trust or estate instrument. Otherwise, reasonable compensation is the rule. Again, fiduciaries must avoid even the appearance of self-dealing or conflict of interest.\n\n(8) Investments.\n\n(a) Generally, Fiduciary roles that involve investments must have investment services available for evaluations and advice. In any case, these fiduciaries must be financially sophisticated with investments and alternatives and capable of evaluating the competence and prudence of the in-house or outside advisory services. Records must be kept of all investment decisions made and the basis for them.\n\nThere is a duty to:\n\n(1) review investments periodically;\n\n(2) dispose of imprudent or nonproductive assets; and\n\n(3) inform and consult regularly with beneficiaries. Fiduciaries who hold funds without investing them can be held liable for loss of interest.\n\n(b) Trustees generally have a duty to:\n\n(1) take control of and preserve the trust estate properly;\n\n(2) make the trust property productive; and\n\n(3) keep the trust property separate and identified. Bank accounts used must yield a reasonable rate or interest.\n\n(9) Applicable Laws. An employee serving in a Fiduciary Capacity shall comply with all laws such as the California Professional Fiduciaries Act to the extent applicable.\n\n6.5.E ADDITIONAL DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF TRUSTEES\n\n(1) Persons acting as trustees are responsible for taking reasonable steps to enforce claims and defend actions regarding trust property.\n\n(2) Trustees overseeing more than one trust cannot knowingly become a trustee of another trust adverse to the interests of the beneficiaries of the first trust.\n\n(3) Trustees must deal with beneficiaries impartially.\n\n6.6 POLITICAL ACTIVITY\n\nWe honor and value the right of individuals to engage in political discourse and expression. We honor the principles of academic freedom. We also honor and adhere to laws that limit a non-profit entity, like Pepperdine, from engaging in certain political activity. To help ensure the University abides by its legal obligations, employees should not present their political views in a way that a reasonable and prudent observer would be likely to think that they are speaking on behalf of the institution. To provide more specific guidance, the following guidelines apply to political activity:\n\n(1) Candidates for Public Office. Consistent with its legal obligations, no employee shall expend University funds or use University resources on behalf of or against a political candidate.\n\n(2) Public Policy Issues. Unless expressly authorized by the University, any statement taking a position or expressing any opinion in connection with any proposed or current legislation, ballot measure, proposition, regulation, law or ruling (collectively \"Political Statements\") made by an employee or agent of the University should be solely attributed to such individual and should not be attributed to the University. Only the University's President, Executive Vice President, or Provost may authorize individuals to make Political Statements on behalf of the University.\n\n(3) Affiliation Statements and Disclaimers. An employee should exercise prudence when he/she chooses to participate in a political campaign, or to make Political Statements, to avoid creating an impression that the University is speaking. The individual should make reasonable efforts to distinguish his or her personal opinion from the University. This may be done in various ways, appropriate to the specific medium. For example, the employee may include a clear and unambiguous disclaimer so that a reasonable person would not believe the Political Statement to be an endorsement by the University. In some settings, a disclaimer would not be necessary—in scholarly publications, for example. In the editorial section of a newspaper, which is by definition and obviously devoted to opinion, there may be little or no need for a disclaimer. However, in materials clearly created solely to persuade voters (e.g., campaign circulars, television advertisements), there will be a need for a disclaimer.\n\n(4) Nothing contained in this policy should be viewed as constraining academic freedom. Likewise, and subject to the guidance in paragraph 3, nothing contained in this policy should be construed to prohibit an employee from identifying himself/herself as a Pepperdine employee who is employed in a particular position. However, any participation, commitment, contract, Political Statement, or expenditure undertaken by an employee or agent in the name of the University that is contrary to this policy is unauthorized and shall be void and unenforceable.\n\nGo to Alphabetical Topic Index\n\nGo to Table of Contents\n\nSection 7 - EMPLOYEE FILES AND REFERENCES\n\n7.1 EMPLOYEE FILES\n\nAn employee may examine the contents of his or her file by making an appointment with Human Resources and may receive copies of any documents which they are legally entitled to. Beyond the employee, access to files is generally limited to the following:\n\nHuman Resources staff;\n\nthe employee's supervisor(s);\n\nprospective supervisors preparing to interview the employee for posted job openings (the prospective supervisor must have already decided to interview the candidate and must inspect the files of all those the prospective supervisor also decided to interview);\n\nlaw enforcement agents with proper, legal authorization;\n\ninternal and external auditors;\n\nGeneral Counsel staff or others providing legal services to the University or as otherwise compelled by law; and\n\nothers with a legitimate need to know.\n\nThe contents of official files are the property of Pepperdine University.\n\n7.2 REFERENCES\n\nIt is the University's policy to only provide job title and dates of employment. Final salary information will also be provided if the individual requesting the information obtains a written authorization signed by the individual whose salary information will be released.\n\nGo to Alphabetical Topic Index\n\nGo to Table of Contents\n\nSection 8 - SUPERVISOR'S RESPONSIBILITIES\n\n8.1 GUIDELINES\n\nThe following guidelines are minimum requirements of responsibility expected from each supervisor.\n\n8.2 TO THE UNIVERSITY\n\nKnow thoroughly the functions of the supervised department/unit within the larger context of the University:\n\nKnow all policies and procedures.\n\nKnow what a department/unit is charged with doing.\n\nUnderstand the function and purpose of each position.\n\nKnow where the work comes from and where it goes.\n\nKnow the required standards of quality.\n\nUnderstand the volume of work to be handled.\n\nKnow the departmental budget and stay within it:\n\nDiscuss cost concerns with departmental staff.\n\nPractice preventative maintenance in order to avoid equipment breakdown and loss of production.\n\nAnalyze jobs periodically to improve efficiency and reduce/avoid duplication of effort.\n\nEnsure that assigned work is produced on time, within budget, and up to expected standards:\n\nProvide job descriptions for all employees to ensure they know what responsibilities have been assigned to them.\n\nProvide adequate training, tools, and supplies to enable employees to accomplish assigned duties.\n\nProvide employees a safe environment in which to work.\n\nAllow sufficient time for planning work assignments.\n\nPrioritize work so that the department can best achieve the University's objectives.\n\nDetermine what constitutes a full day's work under normal conditions and ensure that each employee produces a full day's work.\n\n8.3 TO THE IMMEDIATE SUPERVISOR\n\nShow courtesy and respect.\n\nCooperate, follow directives, and execute instructions as directed.\n\nAlways assume full responsibility for work assigned.\n\nReport the status of any important phase of operation fully, simply, and accurately when requested.\n\nAlert your superior to any significant change in either working conditions or in the ability to meet production schedules.\n\nLook for better ways of doing things and offer ideas and suggestions for improvements.\n\nMake every effort to relieve the immediate supervisor of unnecessary job details, whenever possible and as appropriate.\n\n8.4 TO OTHER SUPERVISORS\n\nDemonstrate courtesy, respect, understanding, and tolerance.\n\nCooperate and be willing to help.\n\nSet a good example.\n\nExchange ideas for improvements in all areas of policy and operation.\n\n8.5 TO SUBORDINATES\n\nIt is expected that supervisors will:\n\nPromote and model the University's mission.\n\nSet a good example.\n\nTreat subordinates as individuals, worthy of respect.\n\nBecome acquainted with the staff individually.\n\nRepresent subordinates to superiors in a professional and accurate manner.\n\nPraise work that is well done.\n\nReprimand in private.\n\nEvaluate carefully, objectively, and honestly.\n\nConduct an annual written employment review for direct reports.\n\nNever permit personal friendships and/or relationships to cloud an objective opinion.\n\nRomantic relationships between supervisors and employees within the same direct reporting line are strongly discouraged.\n\nNever permit individual personalities or prejudices to cloud an objective opinion.\n\nPlace an employee in a position according to skills, ability, and attitude.\n\nTake time to give proper and adequate introductions and orientation to new employees.\n\nMake every effort to interpret and explain policies accurately.\n\nEnsure that job instructions and day-to-day orders are clearly understood.\n\nProvide employees with every opportunity to develop and improve skills and earnings.\n\nImprove confidence in dealings with subordinates by being considerate, firm and fair.\n\nRefrain from requiring subordinates to perform non-University business tasks.\n\nAssume responsibility for the action or the job done.\n\nMaintain a safe workplace and become familiar with the University's policies on unlawful discrimination and harassment, safety policies, programs and procedures.\n\nRefrain from representing the University by making statements to outside agencies (i.e., media outlets, government bodies, investigators, etc.) before consulting with Public Relations, Human Resources, and/or General Counsel Offices as appropriate.\n\nGo to Alphabetical Topic Index\n\nGo to Table of Contents\n\nSection 9 - EMPLOYMENT OF RELATIVES\n\nSince its inception, Pepperdine University has been well served by families. In some cases, several generations of the same family have been involved in the life and work of the University. While valuing and encouraging the contribution these families make, the University is committed to fostering a work environment free from the employment problems commonly associated with nepotism. It is, therefore, the intent of this policy to avoid any real or apparent conflict of interest that may arise from members of the same family working for the University.\n\nEmployees' relatives will not be eligible for employment with the University in positions where potential problems of favoritism, morale, supervision, safety, security or conflict of interest exist. Therefore, employees may not supervise relatives within the same reporting line or hierarchy. Relatives include an employee's spouse, significant other, ancestors, children, grandchildren, great grandchildren, siblings (whether by whole or half-blood), and the spouses of children, grandchildren, great grandchildren, and siblings. For example, an Assistant Director should not hire a relative of the Director as a Receptionist. In cases where related employees assignments are in different departments and/or otherwise assure the absence of favoritism or nepotism, exceptions may be approved by the Executive Vice President.\n\nEmployees, whether or not in the same reporting line, shall not use the influence or authority of their University positions to the undue advantage of their relatives in University employment matters.\n\nEmployees who are members of the same family are not considered agents for each other in human resource matters. They should not interfere with the University's employer/employee relationship with their relative(s) nor expect undue access to the various aspects of that relationship.\n\nIf a supervisor and employee within the same reporting line or hierarchy become related by marriage or adoption, or a supervisor finds him/herself within the same reporting line or hierarchy as a relative due to University reorganization, the relatives will have six months to make arrangements to be in compliance with this policy. If after six months the two relatives are still out of compliance, the Vice President and Chief Business Officer will propose a solution to the Executive Vice President.\n\nComplaints of unfair treatment on the basis of family connections with regard to specific employment actions (hiring, promotion, termination, assessment, salary administration, etc.) should be made in writing to the Vice President and Chief Business Officer.\n\nGo to Alphabetical Topic Index\n\nGo to Table of Contents\n\nSection 10 - NEW EMPLOYEES\n\n10.1 DOCUMENTATION\n\nAll new employees must complete an I-9 form on the first day of employment and present documents establishing their identity and eligibility to work in the United States. Failure to submit documentation before the employee's third day of employment will subject the new hire to termination of employment. The employee must also complete and sign a W-4 form and a direct deposit form.\n\nThese procedures must be followed both for initial hiring and (with few exceptions) re-employment of former employees for both regular and temporary positions.\n\n10.2 ORIENTATIONS\n\nAn orientation for new employees is generally held monthly on a Monday from 9:00 a.m. – 3:00 p.m. by Human Resources. All employees not employed within the past two years must attend. Culture and community are central to Pepperdine's identity and New Employee Orientation is one of several methods used to successfully on-board new faculty and staff members. While department-specific information and various University receptions contribute to the on-boarding process, Orientation familiarizes new employees with University-wide policies and procedures that enable them to begin work immediately. New Employee Orientation provides opportunity for recent hires to understand the culture and mission of the University, learn job processes specific to Pepperdine policy, as well as recognize professional demeanor expected of all University faculty and staff. The various benefit programs that the University provides for all eligible employees is also described.\n\n10.3 I.D. CARDS\n\nAn identification card is issued at no cost to each staff member upon hire. Replacement cards may be obtained through Human Resources at a cost of fifteen dollars ($15) each. The I.D. card should be carried at all times while on the University campus.\n\n10.4 ANNUAL AND INTRODUCTORY PERIOD EMPLOYMENT EVALUATIONS\n\nPerformance evaluations should be provided to each employee annually. It is a supervisor's responsibility to document his or her evaluation of subordinates' performance and review it with them to provide feedback. Annual evaluations must be turned in to Human Resources for placement in the employee's personnel file. Recommended forms may be obtained through Human Resources. All employment evaluations should be in writing and signed by both the supervisor and employee.\n\nUnless otherwise specified in the hiring agreement, each staff employee serves an initial Introductory Period of 90 calendar days. At the end of 90 days, he or she may:\n\nbe removed from Introductory status;\n\nbe extended in an Introductory status (maximum extension is up to an additional 90 days); or\n\nbe terminated from the position for failure or unwillingness to perform.\n\nThe appropriate alternative should be indicated on the Introductory Employee Assessment form, which will be placed in the employee's file.\n\nWhen an introductory employee has been on the job approximately 60 days, Human Resources will send the Introductory Employee Assessment form to the supervisor. The form should be completed by the supervisor. The form is to be returned to Human Resources before the completion of the employee's 90-day introductory period. It is vital that the supervisor:\n\nconscientiously and accurately respond to the evaluation form as part of a continuing assessment process;\n\ncontact Human Resources BEFORE discussion with the employee if the employee is not to be continued in the position;\n\nshare the responses with the employee; and\n\nindicate if the employee is to remain in the position or be released.\n\n10.5 PARKING\n\nAll staff employees are provided parking in an assigned lot. Access to parking lots and parking permits will be furnished to new employees and renewed annually by the Department of Public Safety and the Card Services department. New parking permits remain the property of Pepperdine University. Employees whose vehicles display California handicapped parking permits may use the appropriate designated spaces. The Department of Public Safety publishes and enforces regulations for operating and parking motor vehicles on the Malibu campus.\n\nGo to Alphabetical Topic Index\n\nGo to Table of Contents\n\nSection 11 - TRANSITIONS\n\nAny University employee may apply for an open position for which they qualify by completing an on-line application. Management should make employees available for interviews as part of their responsibility for:\n\nsatisfying critical needs for the deployment of personnel resources to locations in the University where they are most needed;\n\nproviding opportunities for employee development and/or advancement; and\n\nretaining highly valued employees.\n\nIf an employee is transferring within a department or between departments, the transition must occur on the first day of the corresponding pay period. It is the responsibility of the hiring supervisor to contact the current supervisor to arrange a mutually acceptable date for the transition to occur. Normal notice is two weeks before a transition is effected; however, a shorter or longer notice period may be arranged through mutual agreement between the two parties.\n\nGo to Alphabetical Topic Index\n\nGo to Table of Contents\n\nSection 12 DISCIPLINARY ACTION\n\n12.1 REPRIMANDS\n\nWhen a problem arises requiring counseling and a reprimand which may lead to termination, the supervisor should issue a verbal warning and outline specific steps the employee should take to avoid future difficulties. A verbal warning should be memorialized in writing.\n\nUpon recurrence of the same or similar problem, or other substantial issues, the supervisor should counsel the employee and issue a memo which references any previous discussions or memos and points out that the problem(s) could result in dismissal. The employee should be asked to sign the memo, indicating receipt of a copy. The supervisor should send a copy to the appropriate department head, and the original to Human Resources.\n\nIf an incident is severe enough to warrant immediate dismissal, the managing supervisor must notify Human Resources immediately for guidance.\n\n12.2. SUSPENSION\n\nIf a significant situation occurs, or an employee's presence is so disruptive that prompt action is necessary, the supervisor should take the following immediate actions:\n\nSuspend the employee without pay for a definite period of time (normally one to three days). For exempt employees, federal regulations impose special rules: please contact Human Resources prior to taking action.\n\nExplain that if an investigation reveals the employee to be not at fault, he or she will be reinstated and will be paid for lost time.\n\nPrior to commencing the suspension, schedule an appointment with the employee for the end of the suspension period.\n\nConduct an investigation of the precipitating events. Collaborate with Human Resources and involve other departments as needed (General Counsel, Public Safety, etc.).\n\nObtain all documents (time sheets, absentee reports, warning memos, etc.) pertinent to the employee and the problem.\n\nDiscuss the situation with management and Human Resources.\n\nArrive at a tentative decision in the matter prior to meeting with the employee (if the decision is for dismissal, request Human Resources to begin termination procedures).\n\nInterview the employee as scheduled.Discuss all the facts with the employee and arrive at a final decision.\n\nIf the decision is to retain the employee, indicate when the employee should return to work and whether he or she will receive payment for lost time. Notify Human Resources immediately to cease termination procedures. When an employee is retained but is to be disciplined, he or she should be given written notice as soon as he or she is scheduled to return to his or her position, outlining the reason for the suspension, the supervisor's performance or behavior expectations for the employee, and the consequences of repeated violations of them.\n\nIf the decision is unfavorable to the employee, the supervisor should follow the steps outlined under INVOLUNTARY TERMINATIONS in the following section.\n\nGo to Alphabetical Topic Index\n\nGo to Table of Contents\n\nSection 13 TERMINATIONS\n\n13.1 OVERVIEW\n\nThe employment relationship is based on the mutual consent of the employee and the University. Accordingly, either the employee or the University can terminate the employment relationship, at will, with or without cause, at any time during the employment relationship. The only exception is when a different relationship is set forth in an individualized written employment agreement between the employee and the University, signed by an authorized University representative.\n\nThe policies governing involuntary terminations, including layoffs, specifically limit the discretion of individual supervisors and department heads. The review and approval process (described in section 12.3) is intended ensure that the University's human resources are managed to the best interests of the University as a whole.\n\n13.2. VOLUNTARY TERMINATIONS\n\nAn employee wishing to end his or her employment with the University should provide notice in writing of the effective date of separation. Normal expectation for termination notice is two weeks. At the University's discretion, an affected employee will receive pay in lieu of the required notice. It is the supervisor's responsibility to see that all University property (keys, I.D. card, credit cards, computers, etc.) is turned in by the employee. The supervisor should contact Human Resources immediately and provide the Human Resources representative with the time sheet or absentee report, signed written resignation, and necessary memos and documents. All terminating employees should report to Human Resources for an exit interview.\n\n13.3. INVOLUNTARY TERMINATIONS\n\nA supervisor should contact Human Resources prior to discussing termination with an employee. Human Resources will evaluate the proposed action and make a recommendation to the Vice President and Chief Business Officer prior to taking action. Human Resources will notify the supervisor of the disposition of his or her request to terminate. If the decision is to terminate, Human Resources will assist the supervisor in composing a final memorandum to the employee. The supervisor should then take the following steps:\n\nExplain the reasons for dismissal.\n\nIssue the memo to the employee, restating the facts of the decision.\n\nAsk the employee to sign the memo (only to indicate that he or she has received a copy, not to indicate agreement with the content).\n\nObtain the employee's I.D. card, keys, and any other University property which may be in his or her possession.\n\nCoordinate with Human Resources to terminate all computer and other system access.\n\nHuman Resources will coordinate an exit interview for the employee. Human Resources will also explain the insurance continuation/conversion options available to the employee, either during the exit interview or by mail.\n\nFor security reasons it is extremely important to collect any and all keys from the employee prior to him or her vacating the premises. Please contact Human Resources if you have concerns regarding this very important step.\n\n13.4. REDUCTION IN FORCE\n\nThe University strives to be a good steward of the resources entrusted to it, the most valuable of which is its human resources. Accordingly, whenever it becomes necessary to reduce staffing levels because of economic conditions, lack of work, reorganization, or other business reasons, the University will deal with the affected individuals in an open, honest manner and will adhere to the following procedures.\n\n13.4.A CRITERIA AND PROCESS\n\nWhen a reduction in force is necessary, the determination of who will be retained and who will be separated will typically take into consideration (i) the operational needs of the University in order to continue to best fulfill its mission, and (ii) the relative qualifications, competence, demonstrated ability and past performance of potentially affected employees.\n\nBefore announcing or implementing a reduction in force, the appropriate administrator will consult with Human Resources. Human Resources will collaborate with the administrator to make a recommendation to the appropriate senior administrator who will determine the disposition of the proposed action.\n\n13.4.B NOTICE PERIOD\n\nAffected employees will be given at least two weeks' notice unless a longer period of notice is required pursuant to the terms of an individual employment contract or applicable law.\n\nNotice of a reduction in force shall be in writing and shall state the reason for the reduction in force and the effective date of separation from the University. All such notices and any announcement concerning a reduction in force should be coordinated in advance with Human Resources.\n\n13.4.C FINAL PAY AND BENEFITS\n\nAffected employees should be asked to coordinate with Human Resources on or before the employee's last day of work to obtain information concerning benefit options and to receive the final paycheck.\n\nAffected employees will be paid for accrued but unused vacation as of the date of separation and shall be entitled to continue to participate in the University's group health insurance plans at his or her expense in the manner and to the extent permitted by law.\n\n13.4.D CONSIDERATION FOR ALTERNATIVE POSITIONS\n\nAffected employees will be given consideration for any available position at the University for which they apply, based on their respective skills, experience, educational background and past performance.\n\nGo to Alphabetical Topic Index\n\nGo to Table of Contents\n\nSection 14 PAYROLL AND TIME REPORTING\n\n14.1. OVERVIEW\n\nAdherence to payroll procedures and published deadlines is mandatory. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring their staff adhere to the following:\n\nEnsuring all time worked is accurately recorded;\n\nmaintaining accurate records concerning vacation, sick leave, floating holiday or any other absences taken, and preventing excessive vacation or sick leave or duplication of floating holiday;\n\nsubmitting time records to Payroll for absences of exempt employees of one day or more; and\n\ndaily (or \"regularly\") recording time worked or not worked, whether authorized or unauthorized, by hourly employees.\n\nAll employees are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of payroll data at all times.\n\n14.2. PAY PERIODS\n\nHOURLY (nonexempt) employees are paid on a biweekly basis according to the time records submitted. Time records will cover a two-week period, commencing on a Monday at 12:01 a.m. and ending on a Sunday, fourteen days later at 12 midnight.\n\nAll time records submitted must be for the period as determined by the Payroll Office. Payday will be every other Friday, one week following the last Sunday indicated on the time record. If a holiday occurs on Friday, payday will be the previous Thursday. Under certain circumstances, payday may be advanced to the last working day prior to a holiday period.\n\nMONTHLY (exempt) employees will be paid on the 26th day of the month. When the 26th falls on Saturday or Sunday, payday will be the preceding Friday. Under certain circumstances, payday may be advanced to the last working day prior to a holiday period.\n\n14.3. RATE CHANGES\n\nChanges in rates of pay must be made effective on the beginning of a pay period.\n\n14.4 TIME RECORDS\n\nAll nonexempt employees are subject to wage and hour regulations. Each employee in this category must record the number of hours actually worked each day on a time sheet.\n\nAn hourly employee permitted to come to work without having been notified that there will be no work, must be paid half the normal work time scheduled, not to be less than 2 hours or more than 4 hours, regardless of the reason work is unavailable. Pay will be at the appropriate rate for that day.\n\nTime records must be approved by supervisors and forwarded to the payroll department according to the published schedule. To ensure that employees are paid punctually, correctly completed time sheets must be received on schedule.\n\n14.5 MEAL AND REST PERIODS\n\nEach nonexempt employee working at least five (5) consecutive hours per shift shall be entitled to a meal period of a minimum of thirty (30) minutes by no later than the end of the fifth hour of work. Employees on a shift of more than five, but less than six hours, may choose to voluntarily waive the meal period in writing. Nonexempt employees who work more than ten (10) hours in a shift, will be provided a second, unpaid meal period of at least 30 minutes. Depending on the circumstances, an employee may be permitted to waive the second meal period if the employee took the first meal period, if the total hours worked for the shift is no more than twelve (12) hours, and if the employee signs a meal waiver form. Meal periods are not considered as time worked, given that the meal period is at least thirty (30) minutes long and the employee is completely relieved of all duty and free to leave the work area and premises.\n\nNonexempt employees are expected and authorized to take a net, fifteen (15) minute rest period for each four (4) hours worked or major portion thereof, generally one to be taken in the work period prior to the meal period and one in the work period following the meal period. Employees are to be free from any work responsibility or interruption during their rest period; however, in cases of emergency, employees will be expected to reschedule their rest period at some other time during the applicable four (4) hour period. Rest periods are considered as time worked for which there shall be no deduction from wages. Employees whose total daily work time is less than three and one-half hours are not entitled to a rest period.\n\n14.6 LACTATION ACCOMMODATION\n\nUpon request, employees who require lactation accommodation will be provided a reasonable amount of break time for this purpose. The break time will, to the extent possible, run concurrently with any paid break time already provided, and to the extent additional break time is needed, such additional time will be unpaid. You may use your own office or an available private room near your work area for privacy. To ensure privacy, you should make arrangements for these breaks with your supervisor/manager. Please contact Human Resources for instructions on use of lactation rooms.\n\n14.7 REPORTING TIME OFF/ABSENCE\n\nTo report an absence, employees must notify their department heads, supervisors, or other designated persons as early as possible and no later than the beginning of the regularly scheduled shift. The designated person receiving the call will log the following:\n\nemployee's name;\n\ndate and time called;\n\nwho called;\n\nreason for absence; and\n\nexpected length of absence.\n\nAll employees should understand that calling in only notifies the University and does not necessarily excuse the absence.\n\nEmployees requesting time off for various reasons (including vacation) must put this request in writing and receive written approval before taking the specified day(s) off.\n\nAny employee who must take time off because of an emergency must obtain permission from his or her immediate supervisor during the first working hour of the day or before leaving the workstation.\n\nSupervisors are responsible for reporting time off for NONEXEMPT employees by certifying the correctness of the time records.\n\nFailure to adhere to the above may result in disciplinary action or termination of employment.\n\n14.8 TARDINESS\n\nAny employee who will be late in reporting to work must notify their immediate supervisor during the first thirty minutes of the normal start of work. It is the responsibility of the employee to keep the supervisor fully informed.\n\nGo to Alphabetical Topic Index\n\nGo to Table of Contents\n\nSection 15 THE WORK DAY/WORK WEEK\n\n15.1 THE WORK DAY\n\nThe workday is any consecutive twenty-four hours, beginning at the same time each calendar day.\n\n15.2 THE WORK WEEK\n\nA workweek is seven consecutive days starting with the same calendar day each week.\n\n15.3 STANDARD WORK SHIFT\n\nThe normal workweek commences at 12:01 a.m. Monday and ends at 12 midnight on the following Sunday. Normal hours of work during such a workweek are 8 a.m. until 5 p.m. each day, Monday through Friday.\n\n15.4 SPECIAL SHIFT\n\nA special shift is defined as an authorized shift wherein the stop and start hours are not the same as the standard shift hours. Such shifts are established in increments of full calendar weeks.\n\nSpecial shifts for hourly employees will be prepared on a work schedule. If shift hours are not the same for each day of the week, the difference in schedule must be shown on the time sheet. An employee will be considered assigned to a shift if over half of his or her straight time hours fall during hours regularly assigned to that shift.\n\n15.5 OVERTIME: NONEXEMPT EMPLOYEES\n\nNormally, all work should be completed within regular working hours. Overtime should be scheduled only in special circumstances, and only after securing approval of the department head.\n\n15.6 OVERTIME: EMERGENCY\n\nEmergency overtime is required when a nonexempt employee is designated as critical support personnel or is notified by telephone to report to work. Employees so notified must be paid for a minimum period of four hours. Pay will be at the appropriate rate for that day.\n\n15.7 FLEX TIME\n\nThe University allows some employees the opportunity to work a flexible schedule known as \"flex-time.\"\n\nFlex-time: Any employee who hires into or transfers into a department in which flex-time is allowed may be eligible to work a flexible time schedule in certain instances.\n\nA regular nonexempt employee, whose work is determined by supervision to be of a nature which allows a flexible schedule may, with the approval of the immediate supervisor, and the appropriate administrator, and Human Resources, work during the regular work week without regard to a standard fixed time for beginning or ending work provided:\n\nthe employee takes a minimum of thirty minutes and a maximum of one hour for lunch break during the middle of the work day and by no later than the end of the fifth hour of work;\n\nthe employee takes no more than two (2) fifteen-minute breaks near the middle of each four hour work period; and\n\nthe employee's time sheet accurately reflects the time work begins and ends, including times in and out for lunch.\n\nFor a normal daytime shift, flex-time is restricted to scheduling a shift between the hours of 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Other regular shifts may be adjusted accordingly, with work beginning a maximum of one (1) hour before the regularly assigned shift or ending a maximum of two (2) hours after the regularly assigned shift. \"Core\" hours must be covered and are defined to be those hours when telephone and personal contact with any department must be available. \"Core\" hours for every department must be from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday, except for holidays. All flex-time schedules should take into account ensuring coverage for \"Core\" hours. Exempt employees will normally be expected to be active in their normal capacity during the \"core\" hours.\" \"Flex-time\" is an option for individual employees and for different departments only if there is every indication that there is normal or increased productivity during those hours when supervisors may not be expected to be present.\n\nVacation and sick leave will continue to be accrued on the basis of approved numbers of hours each week. Holiday pay continues to be computed by dividing the number of hours the employee is regularly scheduled to work per week by 40 and multiplying the result by 8 hours for each holiday.\n\nGo to Alphabetical Topic Index\n\nGo to Table of Contents\n\nSection 16 REMOTE WORK\n\n16.1 INTRODUCTION\n\nDue to the University's commitment to providing exceptional service to constituents, it is expected that staff members be present and available during normal business hours. Remote work may be a viable work option in certain, unique circumstances which, when properly implemented and administered, benefit both the University and the remote worker. Remote work may not decrease service to students or constituents and additional staff members may not be hired to augment remote work arrangements. Remote work does not change the basic terms and conditions of employment with the University. All University staff members, including remote workers, are subject to all University policies and procedures.\n\n16.2 DEFINITIONS\n\nRemote work is the substitution of telecommunication technologies, including, but not limited to, telephones, facsimile machines, computers, electronic mail, and modems for travel to the University's offices. Remote work is not a right, but rather, a privilege which may be granted at management's sole discretion to high performing individuals whose duties are suited to such an arrangement.\n\nRemote workers are staff members who work for the University from a home, or other remote office, for all or part of the regularly scheduled workweek.\n\nA flexible work schedule is an alternative to the traditional 40-hour work week within normal business hours. It allows employees to vary their arrival and/or departure times. Remote work does not imply a flexible work schedule.\n\n16.3 POLICIES\n\nCriteria for Remote Work\n\nRemote work arrangements are approved on a case-by-case basis. Supervisors will first determine if the position is conducive to remote work, and then determine if the employee is eligible for remote work. Additional considerations are listed below.\n\nPositions Appropriate for Remote Work Assignments\n\nIn determining whether an individual's position is appropriate for a remote work assignment, supervisors will consider factors including, but not limited to:\n\nWhether the work can be performed remotely (e.g., whether the work requires the staff member's physical presence at his/her Pepperdine campus workplace; the input necessary for completion of the position's work duties [information, materials, public contact]; whether the staff member supervises other staff member(s));\n\nWhether the work can be evaluated by review of objective, measurable factors without the supervisor being able to directly observe the work being performed;\n\nWhether there will be any impact on the staff member's ability to provide quality customer service, as our commitment to students and constituents should in no way be diminished (e.g., being available during business hours); and\n\nWhether remote work will negatively impact a department's ability to perform its functions.\n\nStaff Eligible for Remote Work Assignments\n\nIn determining whether a staff member is well-suited for a remote work assignment, supervisors will consider factors including, but not limited to:\n\nLength of Employment;\n\nStaff member should be high performing individual who has demonstrated sustained high performance;\n\nStaff member should have excellent attendance records;\n\nStaff member should be mature, self-disciplined and capable of working with little on-site supervision;\n\nStaff member must be able to function in an environment that is less structured and more autonomous than a traditional work environment;\n\nStaff member should have a high degree of organizational and planning skills;\n\nStaff member should be able to set and meet deadlines; and\n\nStaff member should have sufficient expertise in the use of computer technology to make remote work successful.\n\nFor purposes of this policy, the term \"in good standing\" means that the staff member must be minimally meeting expectations as reflected in his/her most recent performance evaluation and must not have been on a performance improvement plan during the last review cycle.\n\nProcedures for Submitting a Remote Work Request\n\nRequests to remote work may be initiated by the staff member. Staff member requests to remote work should be submitted on the etrieve form entitled \"Remote Work Agreement\" on the Human Resources website. Supervisors will review requests for remote work assignments. The decision to approve or deny a request for a remote work assignment will be initially made at the supervisor's discretion. Upon the supervisor's approval, Human Resources will review the request for final University approval. As described in this policy, multiple factors will be considered prior to a final determination, such as nature of the work, multiple workstations, and employee performance, to name a few.\n\nIn order to facilitate arrangements under which staff members may remote work as part of their work schedule, the University has adopted policies and procedures made available by Human Resources, found on the Human Resources website. Supervisors will establish departmental guidelines for remote work. Once the guidelines have been created, they will be reviewed for approval by Human Resources.\n\nApproved by UMC: 6/17/21\n\nGo to Alphabetical Topic Index\n\nGo to Table of Contents\n\nSection 17 LEAVES OF ABSENCE\n\n17.1 OVERVIEW\n\nAn authorized supervisor may approve a period of absence up to 30 days, provided the absence is for a reason permitted under University policy, and provided the supervisor promptly notifies Human Resources of the absence and the reason it has been approved.\n\nIf, however, it is anticipated that the period absence will exceed 30 days, or extends beyond 30 days, a written request for a Leave of Absence must be promptly submitted to Human Resources for review and approval. All requests for a leave should include the reason for the leave, date or anticipated date(s) the leave will begin, and duration of the leave.\n\nFailure to return to work at the end of an approved period of absence, or to request an approved extension may result in disciplinary action up to and including dismissal.\n\n17.2 SICK PAY\n\nEligible staff accrue sick pay beginning on the first day of employment. Employees may use sick pay for an absence due to their own illness or injury or for preventative care appointments (that cannot be arranged outside regular work hours). Employees may also use up to one half of the employee's yearly accrual of sick pay when caring for an eligible family member or designated person as permitted by law, or for bereavement leave under section 17.8.\n\nThe following sick pay accrual rates for regular staff assume 40-hour per week assignments. These are prorated for eligible employees working fewer hours.\n\nSick pay may be accrued to a maximum of sixty (60) days, i.e., 480 hours.\n\nEmployees unable to report to work due to illness or injury should notify their supervisor before the scheduled start of their work day if possible, but no later than the beginning of the employee's regular reporting time on each day of absence. The supervisor must also be contacted on each additional day of absence. Employees who must miss work because of emergencies or other unexpected circumstances must notify their supervisor as soon as possible. Any injury or illness that requires an employee to leave work during the work day must be immediately reported to the supervisor.\n\nThe University attempts to coordinate sick pay with State Disability Insurance and California Paid Family Leave Insurance benefits. Employees who wish to benefit from the coordination of benefits are responsible for filing for State Disability I"
