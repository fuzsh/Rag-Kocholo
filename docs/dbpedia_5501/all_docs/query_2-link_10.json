        "text": "Disability\n\nA physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activity such as walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, or working.\n\nPhysical or Mental Impairment\n\nPhysical or mental impairments may include but are not limited to: mobility/orthopedic impairments, visual impairments, specific learning disabilities, attention deficit disorder, psychological disorders, neurological impairments, or chronic medical conditions such as cancer, diabetes, or AIDS. The definition of disabilities do not include nonchronic impairments of short durations with little or no long-term impact, such as broken limbs, sprained joints, concussions, appendicitis, and influenza. Physical characteristics such as left-handedness and personality traits such as being irresponsible or having poor judgment, are not covered impairments.\n\nMajor Life Activity\n\nA function such as caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, sitting, standing, lifting, reaching, working, or other everyday activities. Exercising cognitive functions is also a major life activity. Multiple impairments that combine to substantially limit a major life activity may also be considered a form of disability.\n\nQualified Individual with a Disability\n\nA person with a disability who is able to perform the essential functions of his or her academic activities, with or without reasonable accommodation.\n\nReasonable Accommodation\n\nAny change or adjustment to an academic environment that permits a qualified student with a disability to participate in the academic process, without constituting a fundamental alteration or imposing an undue hardship on the university. Accommodations must be considered and made on a case-by-case basis. Some examples of accommodations that may be considered are modifying examinations, providing copies of visual aids, permission to audio record lectures, or preferential seating.\n\nUndue Hardship\n\nDetermined on the basis of the size of the university, the nature and cost of the accommodation, and whether the individual with the disability will pose a health and/or safety threat. An accommodation would generally be determined to represent an undue hardship if it would be unduly costly, extensive, substantial, or disruptive, or would fundamentally alter the nature or operation of the university.\n\nFundamental Alteration\n\nA change, exception, or alternative that would significantly change or alter the fundamental components of the course, program, or university.\n\nWhen reviewing documentation for the provision of accommodations, we look for 3 main qualifications. The qualifications are as follows:\n\nVerification of the diagnosis of disability that the accommodations are being requested for (should be from a provider who is qualified to speak on behalf of the disability being referenced).\n\nExplanation of how the diagnosis affects you (specifically in the academic setting).\n\nSpecific college-based recommendations for accommodations to help mitigate the effects of the disability mentioned above (helpful if it provides the reason for why these accommodations would be helpful.\n\nAdditionally, we look for documentation to be provided on official letterhead with the specific information from the provider including contact information, license number, signature, and practice information. The Disability Services Office may reach out to the provider to obtain additional information if needed to properly assist the student.\n\nPlease note that the Office of Disability Services has developed and provided a Disability Verification Form to ease the process for students and providers and to ensure that all necessary information is provided. Students are in no way required to provide this form, but all documentation will be measured against the standards above.\n\nDocumentation can be submitted in the online software AIM as the final step in the application process.\n\nIn order to best prepare the student for success and in order to ensure efficient service and implementation of accommodations to all students, the Office of Disability Services has the following suggested deadlines for both submitting an initial request and requesting the notification to the professors.\n\nStudents are encouraged to reach out to the office to send the Faculty Notification or get started with the process of accommodations as soon as possible, preferably well in advance of the start of the semester. The communication between provider, student, and the office can take some time. Additionally, if the student is approved for accommodation that may require the provision of materials such as captioned videos, notes, or alternative textbooks, this request should be made as early as possible to give the Office of Disability Services sufficient time to gather and disperse the materials.\n\nIt is also important for the student to note that no accommodation will be applied retroactively. This means that accommodations will not apply to any assignments or course materials, assignments, classes, tests, etc. before the notification of accommodations was sent by the Disability Services Office to the professors. To ensure that all course and class material is covered under their accommodations, student should submit their requests BEFORE the start of the semester or session.\n\nWe recognize that it is not always possible to submit an application prior to the start of the term. In order for accommodations to have an impact on the student experience, we have established suggested deadlines for applications for accommodation, as follows:\n\n8-Week Courses\n\nFor 8-week courses, regardless of session, please refer to the following suggested deadlines:\n\nFor initial requests – It is recommended that a student reach out and submit documentation no later than the end of Week 5 of that session.\n\nFor Faculty Notification – It is recommended that students select and request the professors to be notified no later than the end of Week 6 of that semester.\n\n15-Week Courses\n\nFor 15-week courses, regardless of semester, please refer to the following suggested deadlines:\n\nFor initial requests – It is recommended that a student reach out and submit documentation no later than the end of Week 10 of that session.\n\nFor Faculty Notification – It is recommended that students select and request the professors to be notified no later than the end of Week 13 of that semester.\n\nPlease note that while these deadlines are suggested, students may submit new requests and faculty notification requests after the identified deadlines. However, students should be aware that any requests submitted after this deadline may not be processed and sent to the necessary parties before the end of the session/semester. In addition, as stated above, accommodations are not retroactive and will only be offered after the student has submitted the proper application and documentation, and the Office of Disability Services has had time to evaluate this submission. Also, where adaptive materials, such as audio books are requested, it takes time with the publisher to process the request.\n\nIn accordance with the Americans with Disability Act and its amendments, Service Animals are welcome on campus in order to assist individuals with qualifying disabilities. This applies to individuals visiting to obtain information about Regent, attend class, or access any of the campus services (Regent Giftshop, the Regent Ordinary Café, etc.)\n\nStudents are not required to provide documentation to, nor are they required to register the animal with, the Office of Disability Services. However, students are encouraged to reach out to the Office of Disability Services about the animal being on-campus frequently, and may be asked if the animal is a service animal as opposed to a pet or comfort animal.\n\nRegent University adheres to the definition of a Service Animal as defined by the American with Disabilities Act and its subsequent Amendments. Service animals are working animals- dogs or miniature horses in places that can accommodate them- who are specially trained to perform a certain task or work. These tasks and work could be anything from guiding people with vision impairments, alerting people with hearing impairments, pulling wheelchairs, alerting and protecting a person with a seizure, or other specialized tasks related to a person’s disability. Animals who have not received specialized training, or whose sole task is to provide comfort or emotional support, are typically not considered service animals and would not be considered under these policies. Students seeking and Emotional Support Animal, should refer to the Emotional Support Animal tab below.\n\nRegent University reserves the right to ask the following questions to determine whether an animal is fit to be qualified as a service animal:\n\nIs the dog a service animal required because of a disability?\n\nWhat work or task has the dog been trained to perform?\n\nIn accordance with the Fair Housing Act, Regent University Office of Disability Services is happy to allow the Emotional Support Animals to live in campus housing. However, this is considered an accommodation, and must be requested and approved before the animal is permitted on and in campus housing. A student should request permission to keep an Emotional Support Animal (ESA) on campus, through the online request form mentioned in the Requesting Accommodations Section, as well as supplying the appropriate and sufficient documentation.\n\nDocumentation is expected to meet the standards outlined in the Documentation Guidelines section included above. Additionally, if a letter is submitted rather than the Disability Verification Form, it should meet the criteria identified below.\n\nLetters or documentation should be from a treating clinician, physician, psychologist, psychiatrist, counselor/therapist, etc. and should include the following information:\n\nYour complete name\n\nThe dates of service including the date of your most recent visit to the provider\n\nVerification that you have a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits you in at least one major life activity or bodily function (specify diagnosis)\n\nThat the ESA is needed to alleviate a symptom or effect of the disability\n\nThis letter or documentation should be on official letterhead from the provider, and should include the provider’s signature and identifying license information. This letter should be submitted to the Office of Disability Services and may be required to renew each year.\n\nEmotional Support Animals will NOT be permitted on campus or in campus housing, until the accommodation has been approved from the Office of Disability Services and Student Housing has given permission to the student. This is because of necessary steps to ensure that the proper roommates’ agreements are in place. If an animal is brought to campus before the accommodation is fully approved, the student may be asked to remove the animal from campus, regardless of where the student has traveled from.\n\nPlease note that emotional support animals will only be permitted in the Regent Student Housing area and are not permitted elsewhere on campus such as in classrooms. Any walks the animal may require should be done within the Student Housing area."
