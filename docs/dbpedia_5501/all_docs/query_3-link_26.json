        "text": "If you would like to further educate your students or department, SCCR has presentations on various topics including what the Honor Code is, how to file an Honor Code report, and common cheating and detection. SCCR can also review syllabi and give feedback. Email SCCR to schedule a presentation that meets the specific needs of your class or team.\n\nSchedule a presentation\n\nWhen you are aware of or suspect an Honor Code violation, speak to the student before reporting the incident. SCCR also recommends clearly explaining what you think may have happened and what evidence you have to support the allegation. It can be hard for a student if the first time they learn of an allegation is in an email notification from SCCR. Letting the student know beforehand also advises them to be on the lookout for a communication from SCCR.\n\nFaculty and staff should make sure students have the opportunity to respond by asking the student what happened. After that discussion, let them know how it will impact their grade, whether you will report the violation to SCCR if you still believe academic dishonesty occurred and what the student can expect next.\n\nAll students enrolled in a University of Colorado Boulder course are responsible for knowing and adhering to the Honor Code. Violations of the policy may include: plagiarism, cheating, fabrication, lying, bribery, threat, unauthorized access to academic materials, clicker fraud, submitting the same or similar work in more than one course without permission from all course instructors involved, and aiding academic dishonesty. All incidents of academic misconduct will be reported to the Honor Code (honor@colorado.edu; 303-492-5550). Students who are found responsible for violating the academic integrity policy will be subject to nonacademic sanctions from the Honor Code as well as academic sanctions from the faculty member. Additional information regarding the Honor Code academic integrity policy can be found on the Honor Code website."
