        "text": "Division\n\nStudent Affairs\n\nDepartment\n\nDean of Students Office\n\nEffective Date\n\n05/05/2021\n\nGuiding Principle\n\nAmnesty Through Responsible Action is part of University of Wisconsin-Whitewater’s comprehensive environmental approach to address high-risk behaviors. Because the health and safety of the members of the UW-Whitewater community is of primary concern, we want to remove the perceived barriers that prevent students from seeking immediate medical attention. This program has been designed for the student who is concerned for the well-being of a fellow student and enables the university to more effectively address the issue of civility and good citizenship with our students.\n\nIn cases where individuals are incapacitated due to alcohol and/or other drugs, it is imperative that someone calls for medical assistance. In the interest of student safety, this program serves to remove or reduce punitive consequences faced by students in violation of Non-Academic Misconduct (UWS 17 and/or UWS 18).\n\nAmnesty Through Responsible Action allows the student who required medical assistance to receive medical attention without a violation of UWS 17 and/or UWS 18. It would also provide relief from similar violations for those who assisted the student in need.\n\nThese guidelines apply to disciplinary actions related to the personal consumption of alcohol and/or other drugs by the injured student or those providing medical aid or making a report. The guidelines do not operate to provide amnesty for offenses or violations related to alcohol, use or possession of other drugs illegally, or other crimes, and they may not apply to students involved in repeated violations of university alcohol and/or other drug policies.\n\nNOTE: Relief from disciplinary action will not be granted to students who do not seek medical assistance. Students who are confronted by University Staff (e.g. RAs, Hall Directors, University Police) will be addressed under the normal student conduct process and applicable laws.\n\nResponsible Action\n\nAmnesty Through Responsible Action is designed to create an environment where all University of Wisconsin-Whitewater students look out for one another. This policy encourages students and student organizations to seek help for students they observe have consumed alcohol or other drugs to levels of extreme intoxication or other medical emergency. Conditions include vomiting, loss of balance, unresponsiveness or other conditions that may require medical intervention.\n\nWhen a person's life is in danger due to alcohol and/or other drug consumption, University of Wisconsin-Whitewater students are expected to seek immediate assistance, including calling 9-1-1. The purpose of these guidelines is to foster student responsibility and learning, while simultaneously ensuring the safety of our students and community.\n\nWisconsin Good Samaritan Statute\n\n\"Any person who renders emergency care at the scene of any emergency or accident in good faith shall be immune from civil liability for his or her acts or omissions in rendering such emergency care.\"\n\nTo read Wisconsin's Statute: Wis. Stat 895.48(1)\n\nProtection for Victims of Crime\n\nWisconsin law prohibits the issuing of citations for alcohol beverages violations to certain underage victims in connection to sexual assault or certain other crimes and prohibits certain disciplinary sanctions if the underage person is a student.\n\nTo read Wisconsin's Law: 2018 Wisconsin Act 279\n\nCaller\n\nWhen a person calls on behalf of an individual who requires life-saving emergency evaluation, the caller will not be subject to disciplinary actions from the university IF the following conditions are met:\n\nCaller must remain with the impaired individual until assistance arrives.\n\nCaller must be completely cooperative with emergency responders.\n\nCaller must complete any programs deemed necessary by the Dean of Students Office. Any fees associated with the educational program will be waived.\n\nThe caller may be required to meet with the Dean of Students Office or other University officials.\n\nFuture or repeat incidents will be handled on a case by case basis and may be referred to the Dean of Students Office or University Police.\n\nFailure to call for assistance in an alcohol and/or other drug related emergency is a very serious matter and could be considered an “aggravating circumstance” factored into disciplinary action against the student should violations of Non-Academic Misconduct (UWS 17 and/or UWS 18) occurred in relation to the incident.\n\nPerson in Need of Medical Attention\n\nWhen a student requires life-saving emergency evaluation and/or treatment at a medical facility for an overdose of alcohol and/or other drugs, the student will be required to meet with a staff member from the Dean of Students Office to discuss the incident and to connect with appropriate resources and support. The student will be required to complete an alcohol and/or other drugs education program through the Dean of Students Office. Any fees associated with the education program will be waived.\n\nIn the event of a student in need of life-saving medical evaluation, the Dean of Students Office may contact a Parent/guardian.\n\nWhen the student’s behavior involves other UWS 17 and/or UWS 18 violations, or the student exhibits a pattern of problematic behavior with alcohol and/or other drugs, they may be subject to additional disciplinary action.\n\nFuture or repeat incidents will be handled on a case by case basis and may be referred to the Dean of Students Office or University Police.\n\nAmnesty Through Responsible Action may also apply in the following situations:\n\nStudent Organizations: Student organizations should seek immediate medical assistance for their members or guests when any potential life-safety issue is observed, including medical emergencies related to the use of alcohol and/or drugs.\n\nA student organization that seeks immediate assistance from appropriate sources will not be charged with violations of the Student Organization Code of Conduct. The organization may be required to complete educational programming required by the Dean of Students Office.\n\nThe organization may be held accountable for other violations of the Code of Conduct related to the incident (e.g. endangering the health or safety of others, etc.).\n\nStudent organizations that fail to seek immediate medical assistance for members or guests in need of attention could be charged with violations of the Code of Conduct.\n\nVictims of Crime: In cases where a student has been a victim of sexual assault and/or a violent crime while under the influence of alcohol and/or other drugs, neither the Dean of Students Office, University Housing, nor UW-Whitewater Police Department will pursue disciplinary actions against the student victim (or against a witness) for their improper use of alcohol (e.g., underage drinking) and/or other drugs. A student victim who is under the influence of alcohol and/or other drugs at the time of a sexual assault and/or violent crime is entitled to university and community assistance and encouraged to seek help.\n\nUW-Whitewater is appreciative to UW-Madison for providing resources used to implement this policy\n\n“I am fully supportive of students and student groups actively ensuring the well-being of others by taking responsible steps to seek assistance for individuals who are intoxicated and/or impaired. Our police department looks forward to active participation in this program and City of Whitewater police officers will assess on a case-by-case basis.”\n\nAaron Michael Raap\n\nChief of Police\n\nCity of Whitewater\n\nApril 20, 2021\n\nDiscrimination, Discriminatory-Harassment and Retaliation\n\nDISCRIMINATION, HARASSMENT AND RETALIATION POLICY\n\nThe University of Wisconsin-Whitewater strives to foster an environment of respect for all members of the university community free from discrimination and harassment. Incidents of discriminatory conduct are detrimental to the individuals directly involved and diminish the university community. UW-Whitewater is committed to the elimination of discrimination and discriminatory harassment toward anyone in the UW-Whitewater community. In accordance with federal and state laws and University of Wisconsin System policy, this policy outlines expectations of conduct and procedures applicable to students, employees, and guests of UW-Whitewater.\n\nSCOPE\n\nThis policy applies to all areas of UW-Whitewater programs, activities, employment practices and operations, including the conduct of all students and employees that arises out of their employment, educational or academic status, as well as to the conduct of all guests, visitors, vendors, contractors, subcontractors and others who do business with UW-Whitewater.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nRegent Policy Document 14-6 states that institutions shall have, “1) policies and procedures consistent with this Board policy for the prevention and prohibition of discrimination, harassment and retaliation against students or employees; and 2) procedures in place to ensure prompt and corrective action whenever discrimination, harassment or retaliation may occur.” “Each institution shall develop a process to notify prospective and current students, student organizations, job applicants and employees of its institutional policies and procedures regarding discrimination, discriminatory harassment, and retaliation.” Please see Procedures section below.\n\nDEFINITIONS\n\nDiscrimination: Conduct that adversely affects any aspect of an individual’s employment, education, or participation in UW-Whitewater’s activities or programs or has the effect of denying equal privileges or treatment to an individual on the basis of that individual’s protected status or another category as defined in this policy.\n\nDiscriminatory Harassment: A form of discrimination consisting of unwelcome verbal, written, graphic or physical conduct that: 1. Is directed at an individual or group of individuals on the basis of the individual or group of individuals' actual or perceived protected status, or affiliation or association with person(s) within a protected status (as defined above): and 2. Is sufficiently severe or pervasive so as to interfere with an individual’s employment, education or academic environment or participation in institution programs or activities and creates a working, learning, or living environment that a reasonable person would find intimidating, offensive or hostile. To constitute prohibited harassment, the conduct must be both objectively and subjectively harassing in nature. Harassment may include but is not limited to verbal or physical assaults, threats, slurs or derogatory or offensive comments that meet the definition set forth in this policy. Harassment does not have to be targeted at a particular individual in order to create a harassing environment, nor must the conduct result in a tangible injury to be considered a violation of this policy. Whether the alleged conduct constitutes prohibited harassment depends on the totality of the particular circumstances, including the nature, frequency, and duration of the conduct in question, the location and context in which it occurs, and the status of the individuals involved.\n\nRetaliation: Adverse action taken against an individual in response to, motivated by or in connection with an individual’s complaint of discrimination or discriminatory harassment, participation in an investigation of such complaint and/or opposition to discrimination or discriminatory harassment in the educational or workplace setting\n\nSexual Harassment: Conduct on the basis of sex that satisfies one or more of the following:\n\nAn employee of the institution conditions the provision of an aid, benefit, or service of the institution directly or indirectly on an individual’s participation in unwelcome sexual conduct;\n\nUnwelcome conduct of a sexual nature directed towards a student, an employee, or a person participating in a program or activity of the university that, when using the legal “reasonable person” standard:\n\nIs so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies the person equal access to the institution’s education program or activity; or 2. Is so severe or pervasive and objectively offensive that it has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual’s academic or work performance or participation in a university sponsored or supported activity, or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive academic, working, or program or activity related environment.\n\nPOLICY STATEMENT\n\nIt is the policy of UW-Whitewater to maintain an academic and work environment free from discrimination, discriminatory harassment, and retaliation for all students, employees and guests.\n\nUW-Whitewater will not tolerate discrimination or harassment by or toward students, employees, and guests on the basis of sex, race, religion, color, creed, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin, ancestry, age, marital status, pregnancy, political affiliation, arrest or conviction record, veteran’s status, or any other prohibited basis defined by federal or state law or UW System policy.\n\nRetaliation toward an individual for filing a complaint of discrimination or discriminatory harassment, participation in an investigation of such complaint and/or opposition to discrimination or discriminatory harassment in the educational or workplace setting is also a form of harassment and is therefore prohibited.\n\nUse of institution technology (computers, e-mail systems, voice mail system, and webpages) for the purposes of discrimination, discriminatory harassment, or retaliation is also prohibited. Such behaviors will not be tolerated and will be handled in accordance to the procedures outlined in this policy.\n\nAny person who believes they have been subjected to this type of prohibited activity should immediately report it to the appropriate institution officials or offices as listed in “Procedures” section below. Students who file a complaint under this policy have the right to appeal of the chancellor’s or dean’s decision to the Board of Regents, as permitted under Wisconsin Statute §36.12(2)(b).\n\nThe following protections shall apply to this policy in regard to an individual’s protected status:\n\nStudents - No student may be denied admission to, participation in or the benefits of, or be discriminated against in any service, program, course or facility of UW-Whitewater because of the student's race, color, creed, religion, age, sexisms, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin, ancestry, disability, pregnancy, marital or parental status, military service, veteran status, or any other category protected by law, including physical condition or developmental disability as defined in Wisconsin Statute §51.01(5).\n\nEmployees - No employee or prospective employee may be discriminated against on the basis of race, color, creed, religion, age, sexisms, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin, ancestry, disability, pregnancy, marital or parental status, genetic information, arrest or conviction record, military service, veteran status, use or non-use of lawful products off university premises during nonworking hours, declining to attend a meeting or participate in any communication about religious matters or political matter, or any other category protected by law.\n\nPROCEDURES\n\nProcedures for Reporting Discrimination or Harassment:\n\nAny member of the university community who has been either a target of or a witness to discrimination or harassment has a right to take action either by confronting those involved directly or by reporting the incident to a university official (as described under \"1. Complaint Intake\"). While every effort will be made to respect both the confidentiality and the wishes of the complainant, university officials have an ethical and legal obligation to take action to prevent and stop illegal harassment or discrimination and may therefore be compelled to take some action, even if the complainant is unsure of what action is desired. Incidents reported to university officials will be handled in a manner that protects the privacy and due process rights of everyone involved. Specific incidents of alleged discrimination or discriminatory harassment will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the procedures outlined below. Due consideration will be given to the protection of individual First Amendment rights to freedom of speech, expression, and academic freedom.\n\nThe following procedures have been established to provide a framework for handling such concerns.\n\nComplaint Intake\n\nUniversity officials prepared to deal with concerns about discrimination and harassment include: Title IX Coordinator; Dean of Students office staff; Chief Human Resources Officer; Deputy Title IX Coordinators; University Police; University Housing staff; Associate Vice Chancellor of Equity, Diversity, Inclusion and Support Programs & Senior Diversity Officer; and supervisors, such as Department Chairs, Directors, and Deans.\n\nWhen someone raises a concern about discrimination or harassment, they should be directed to the appropriate university official listed above. That official will then: 1) Listen and help clarify both the concern and the desired outcome 2) Explain the options available which may include an offer of University/community resources, explanation of the University/legal adjudication processes, offer of interim protection measures, and/or offer of academic accommodations 3) Attempt a resolution if desired by the individual with the concern and 4) Submit a complaint intake form to the appropriate office: Hate Bias Student Discrimination Employee Discrimination\n\nThe university official to whom a report of sexual violence or sexual harassment has been made will fill out a Sexual Misconduct Form.\n\nInformal Resolution\n\nInformal resolution has the goal of ending offensive behavior and resolving the concern rather than assessing blame and exacting a penalty. If a concern can't be resolved informally, or if the behavior is so serious or persistent as to warrant disciplinary action, it should be handled through formal procedures.\n\nIf an informal resolution is to be attempted by one of university official listed above, the university official will meet with the individual accused of the offending behavior to explain the concern and get a response. The university official will endeavor to respect the complainant’s wishes with respect to confidentiality and participation in meeting with the accused individual. While informal resolution may result in some mutually agreeable action, such as an apology or a behavior contract, no record of a complaint resolved informally will be placed in the respondent’s personnel file or student record.\n\nFormal Procedures\n\nThe purpose of formal action is to determine if the UW-Whitewater policy on discrimination, harassment and retaliation has been violated and, if so, to enact disciplinary sanctions and/or prescribe a course of action that will resolve the situation. Disciplinary sanctions may include but are not limited to a written reprimand, probation, suspension, dismissal or expulsion.\n\nFormal procedures are set in motion when a signed written complaint is filed with one of the university officials listed above. The complaint must contain the name and signature of the complainant, details of the situation precipitating the complaint, and a statement of desired outcome. When a signed complaint has been received, the university official receiving the complaint will notify the appropriate department as indicated below, who will set in motion the appropriate process and notify the individual or group against whom the complaint has been made.\n\nThe process for filing a complaint, investigating and hearing complaints and grievances against individuals depends upon the status of the accused (faculty, academic staff, university staff, or student). The following policies guide these processes: Faculty: Complaints against Faculty will be reviewed by the chancellor, or designee, and processed in accordance with Faculty Personnel Rules (UW-W Chapter 3), and Chapter 6 - Rules Governing Complaints and Grievances Against Faculty. Academic Staff: Complaints against Academic Staff will be investigated by the Office of Human Resources or the Vice Chancellor of Administrative Affairs or designee in accordance with Academic Staff Personnel Policies and Procedures University Staff: Complaints against University Staff will be investigated by the Office of Human Resources or the Vice Chancellor of Administrative Affairs or designee in accordance with UW System Administrative Policy 1241: Complaint Procedures and UW System Administrative Policy 1233: Grievance Procedures. Students: Complaints against students will be investigated by the Dean of Students Office and or referred to the appropriate department or unit, in accordance with UWS Chapter 14 and UWS Chapter 17. Guests: Complaints against guests or otherwise non-students or employees will be investigated by University Police, and other campus departments as necessary, in accordance with USW Chapter 18.\n\nIn determining whether discrimination or harassment has occurred, the investigating body will apply state and federal statutes, regulations, and case law relevant to the basis of discrimination being alleged. Where there is a question as to whether the action or conduct constitutes discrimination or harassment, appropriate legal counsel will be consulted. If the relevant policies above do not contain their own procedure for appeals, the following appeal process will apply. Appeal Process For conduct defined in this policy, where the sanction is prescribed by the University Administrator, the Respondent may appeal in writing within 14 days of the date of the written decision to the Chancellor or their designee (i.e. Appellate Administrator).\n\nThe Appellate Administrator has 30 days from date of receipt of an appeal to respond and shall sustain the decision unless the Appellate Administrator finds any of the following:\n\nThe information and evidence presented as a result of the investigation does not support the findings or decision.\n\nAppropriate procedures were not followed which resulted in material prejudice to the respondent\n\nThe decision was based on factors proscribed by state or federal law.\n\nAlleged violations of other UWS Chapter codes will follow each chapters appeal process. Discretionary Appeal to the Board of Regents For conduct defined in this policy, institutional decisions shall be final, except the board of regents may, at its discretion, grant a review upon the record, upon written request submitted by the Respondent within 14 days of the final institutional decision, as permitted under s.36.12(2)(b), Wisconsin State Statute. Record Keeping Timelines\n\nA record identifying a specific individual will be kept only if the person has been notified of the existence of the report and been given an opportunity to attach a counter statement; in that case, the record will be kept for six years and destroyed if no further reports have been filed.\n\nAll reports of discrimination and harassment must be handled in a timely fashion. Complaints must be filed with UW- Whitewater within 300 days of the alleged violation. Other timelines are determined by the procedures that apply to the status of the accused (faculty, academic staff, university staff, or student).\n\nA copy of this policy and the procedures for implementing it will be distributed annually to all UW-Whitewater students, faculty, academic staff, and university staff. In addition, educational programs will be conducted regularly to sensitize members of the university community to the issues covered by this policy. This will be performed by the Quality Assurance Improvement Manager.\n\nUse of these procedures does not prevent the complainant from seeking legal redress. Time limits for filing complaints under the various laws differ.\n\nRESPONSIBILITIES\n\nPosition/Office: Title IX Coordinator, Dean of Students / Office of Dean of Students, Chief Human Resources Officer / Human Resources Department / University Police, Chief of Police Responsibilities: The above-mentioned positions and offices have the responsibility to maintain and consistently manage the implementation of this policy.\n\nCONTACTS\n\nThose designated to recieve questions and feedback on the policy\n\nSubject\n\nContact\n\nPhone\n\nFax/Email\n\nChief Human Resources Officer\n\nConnie Putland\n\n262.472.1024\n\nputlandc@uww.edu\n\nDean of Students\n\nElizabeth Watson\n\n262.472.1533\n\nwatsone@uww.edu\n\nTitle IX Coordinator\n\nVicki Schreiber\n\n262.472.1024\n\nschreibv@uww.edu\n\nChief of University Police\n\nMatthew Kiederlen\n\n262.472.4660\n\nkiederlm@uww.edu\n\nUpdated 01.13.2023\n\nDefinition Overview\n\nThis policy applies to any event sponsored by a Student Organization or University Department held anywhere on the UW-Whitewater campus.

This policy may be enforced through citations issued by the UW-Whitewater Police Department, as applicable, through non-academic misconduct sanctions with respect to students, through cancellation of contracts such as housing contracts with students, and/or through appropriate disciplinary processes applying to employees.\n\nScope\n\nThis policy applies to all UW-Whitewater students, faculty, staff, and guests\n\nThis Policy defines restrictions for firearms and dangerous weapons on UW-Whitewater property and in connection with UW-Whitewater activities.\n\nThe Wisconsin Administrative Code at UWS 18.10(3) prohibits a person from carrying, possessing, or using any dangerous weapon on university lands or in university buildings or facilities, unless it is for law enforcement purposes or the person receives written approval of the Chancellor. Chapter 18 permits police to confiscate and remove dangerous weapons from university lands.\n\nOn July 8, 2011, Governor Scott Walker signed 2011 Wisconsin Act 35 into law. Effective November 1, 2011, it is lawful in the State of Wisconsin for licensed individuals to be armed with a concealed weapon, or to carry particular weapons in an open or concealed manner, as long as there is no indication of a criminal or malicious intent. This law provides certain exemptions for schools and universities, however, which are implemented further in this policy.\n\nBackground\n\nUW-Whitewater is committed to maintaining a safe campus environment and to ensuring that it acts to the extent possible to shield its students and employees from harm, including from firearms and other dangerous weapons on university property and in connection with university activities and events.\n\nPolicy Statement\n\nProhibited Behavior at UW-WhitewaterPROHIBITED BEHAVIOR AT UW-WHITEWATER\n\nNo Firearms or Dangerous Weapons in UW-Whitewater Buildings\n\nIndividuals are prohibited from carrying firearms and dangerous weapons into buildings or portions of buildings that are owned, occupied, or controlled by UW-Whitewater. UW- Whitewater shall place signs in prominent places near all of the entrances to UW- Whitewater buildings notifying the UW-Whitewater community and visitors of this ban. This ban on firearms and dangerous weapons inside UW-Whitewater buildings applies equally to Licensees.\n\nNo Firearms or Dangerous Weapons by Employees\n\nEmployees of UW-Whitewater, including student employees, are prohibited from carrying firearms or other dangerous weapons while engaged in any employment activity on behalf of UW-Whitewater, whether on or off campus.\n\nThis ban does not apply to firearms or other dangerous weapons carried solely in the employee’s own motor vehicle.\n\nNo Firearms or Dangerous Weapons in Residence Halls\n\nNo individual may possess firearms or any other dangerous weapons in the residence halls.\n\nNo Firearms or Dangerous Weapons in UW-Whitewater Owned Vehicles\n\nNo individual may possess firearms or any other dangerous weapons in UW-Whitewater owned or operated vehicles. UW-Whitewater may place signs in prominent places in UW- Whitewater vehicles as appropriate notifying the campus community of this ban.\n\nNo Firearms or Dangerous Weapons at UW-Whitewater Special Events\n\nNo individual may possess firearms or any other dangerous weapons at UW-Whitewater special events (see definition above), except in vehicles driven or parked in a parking facility in connection with the event. UW-Whitewater shall place signs in prominent places at UW-Whitewater events notifying the campus community of this ban.\n\nExemptions to Prohibited Behavior\n\nThe above bans on firearms and dangerous weapons do not apply to sworn law enforcement personnel. In addition, from time to time, the Chancellor or Chancellor’s designee may grant exemptions under unique, limited circumstances (e.g., if an unloaded firearm is required as part of an artistic performance or if a firearm or weapon is required in a laboratory by a research project). Persons seeking such an exemption should first consult with the UW-Whitewater Police Chief, who shall refer the request for an exemption along with the Chief’s recommendation to the Chancellor or Chancellor’s designee. Such an exemption must be obtained from the Chancellor or Chancellor’s designee in writing, in advance.\n\nQuestions and Answers\n\nQ1: What is the difference between firearms, guns, dangerous weapons, and concealed carry weapons?\n\n“Firearm” is defined as a weapon that acts by force of gunpowder. “Gun” is the same as firearm.\n\n“Dangerous weapon” is defined as any firearm, whether loaded or unloaded; any device designed as a weapon and capable of producing death or great bodily harm; any ligature or other instrumentality used on the throat, neck, nose or mouth of another person to impede, partially or completely, breathing or circulation of blood; any electric weapon; or any other device or instrumentality which, in the manner it is used or intended to be used, is calculated or likely to produce death or great bodily harm.\n\n“Concealed Carry Weapons” or “CCWs” are those weapons that a Licensee may carry in a concealed fashion, except as prohibited in certain locations. CCWs are: a handgun, electric weapon, a knife other than a switchblade knife, or a billy club.

Such permission must be obtained from the Chancellor or Chancellor’s designee in writing and in advance.\n\nQ13: Do the prohibitions apply to law enforcement?\n\nNo. Sworn law enforcement officers, including UW-Whitewater police officers, are exempt from the prohibitions.\n\nQ14: Can I get special permission to bring a firearm or dangerous weapon to UW- Whitewater if I am licensed and have had appropriate training?\n\nNo. Exceptions will not be made on this basis.\n\nQ15: Will signs be posted explaining the prohibitions?\n\nYes. Prior to the effective date of the new law, UW-Whitewater will post conspicuously post signs stating the prohibitions at the entrances to all UW-Whitewater buildings.\n\nQ16: Are stun guns or Tasers permitted on campus?\n\nStun guns and Tasers are both electric weapons that are considered to be within the definition of “dangerous weapons.” They thus are prohibited in UW-Whitewater buildings, or portions of buildings owned, occupied, or controlled by UW-Whitewater, including residence halls, and at special events (see response to Q11 above). They also are prohibited outside UW-Whitewater buildings on UW-Whitewater grounds except when carried in a concealed manner by a Licensee, and except in personal vehicles. All employees, including those who are Licensees, are barred from carrying stun guns and Tasers while in the course of performing duties for UW-Whitewater, on or off campus, except in personal vehicles. Law enforcement is not subject to the prohibitions on electric weapons.\n\nQ17: Is pepper spray permitted on campus?\n\nPepper spray that is lawful in Wisconsin is not considered to be a dangerous weapon.

It is important to note that:\n\nIt is not a complete statement of all procedures, policies, rules and regulations of the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater, nor is it a complete statement of state or local laws that may be applicable to student organizations;\n\nThe University reserves the right to change without notice any procedure, policy, and/or program, which appears in the University Recognition Policy for Student Groups;\n\nOther departments may have their own procedures and policies that apply to student organizations;\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin System Administrative Codes Chapter 17 and Chapter 18 that govern most University activities may also apply to individual student conduct within student organizations.\n\nIn conjunction with UC-Student Activities & Involvement and the Division of Student Affairs the following policy has been adopted regarding the standards and procedure for recognized student organizations at the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater. The policy acknowledges support of the primary mission of the institution and the need to preserve the orderly processes of the university as well as the need to observe student and recognized student organization rights and responsibilities. UC-Student Activities & Involvement, subject to approval by the Assistant Chancellor for Student Affairs of the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater, shall be responsible for revisions of this policy. UC-Student Activities & Involvement is responsible for distribution of updates.\n\nPolicy Statement\n\nStudent organizations granted University Recognition are a vital part of our University community. Student organizations sponsor activities and services which help to improve the quality of student life, provide opportunities for students to meet other students and faculty/staff of the University, and serve as a laboratory for students to practice the skills associated with leadership. Volunteer associations of students who have been granted the privileges of University recognition may be an asset to achieving the University's goals of student learning and retention. It is hoped that all recognized student organizations, as part of the University community, join in helping to create an environment that enables all students to accomplish their educational goals while at the University.\n\nThe following guidelines have been developed to clarify the relationship between the University and a student organization, and to provide for a consistent application of the criteria for University recognition.\n\nRelationship\n\nUniversity recognition of a student organization means that the student organization has completed the requirements for University recognition and is eligible for the privileges extended to recognized student organizations (outlined later in this document). University recognition, therefore, does not imply University endorsement of the activities of the student organization. University recognition also does not imply that the student organization has been granted agency status by the State of Wisconsin, the University of Wisconsin System, or the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater. While faculty and staff members of the University serve in advisory capacities to student organizations, it is presumed that students of legal adult age are adults and, therefore, make and are accountable for their decisions and behavior as individuals and as members of organizations.\n\nUniversity Recognition: Requirements and Process\n\nStudent Activities & Involvement is the University office with the responsibility to administer the Student Organization Program, including the University Recognition Processes. The requirements and process of obtaining University Recognition are as follows:\n\nSubmission of the student organization's governing documents (constitution, by-laws, etc.);\n\nSubmission of constitution or by-laws of the national or international organization with which the student organization is affiliated (if applicable);\n\nIdentification of a UW-Whitewater employee to serve as a campus advisor to the student organization;\n\nCompletion of recognition form;\n\nCompletion of Student Leader training by the President/Leader and a member of the organization that is both a student and in good standing within the organization (includes both Antihazing Training and Campus Expectations Overview)\n\nSubmission of signed Recognition Agreement by both the Advisor and President/Leader.\n\nApplication materials will be reviewed by staff in Student Activities & Involvement to ensure compliance with all applicable University policies, as well as state and federal laws (i.e., Title IX). The decision to grant University Recognition shall be made by Student Activities & Involvement staff. Student groups interested in applying for University recognition must do so by December 15th for the following semester, or by May 15th for the following academic year.\n\nRecognition requirements apply to all recognized student organizations, including those on probation or suspension.\n\nChange of Information\n\nDuring the academic year there may be changes in officers, advisor, or constitutions of student organizations. It is the responsibility of each student organization to update their org's information on Connect for any and all changes. If changes are made in the organization constitution, a revised constitution must be submitted electronically to Student Activities & Involvement, and is subject to review.\n\nNotification of University Recognition\n\nOnce a student organization has completed the University Recognition Process, the organization's request for recognition will be reviewed by staff in Student Activities & Involvement. If the membership requirements for the organization adhere to the University's Non-Discrimination Policy for Recognized Student Organizations, if the organization has no outstanding bills with the University, and if the student organization is in good standing with Student Activities & Involvement, the organization will be granted or extended the privileges of University recognition. At this time, contact will be made with the student contact person and the advisor(s) indicating that the organization is in good standing and is extended the privileges of University recognition. This process is completed at minimum once per academic year.\n\nNotification of Advisor Appointment\n\nFaculty or staff members serving as advisors to recognized student organizations will receive a letter from Student Activities & Involvement. The letter serves as an appointment letter, acknowledging the official capacity in which that faculty or staff member will serve as the advisor to a student organization.\n\nRights, Benefits, and Services\n\nRights And Benefits Of University Recognition\n\nUse of the University's name to identify the student organization's affiliation.\n\nUse of name must adhere to the campus licensing policy and identity standards.\n\nThe University reserves the right of approval on a case-by-case basis;\n\nReserve and use University facilities that are available for non-instructional use;\n\nUtilize Student Activities & Involvement services and programs developed and offered to recognized student organizations.\n\nBe included on official lists of recognized student organizations;\n\nUtilize University services and facilities, and participate in University events that are open to all recognized student organizations; and\n\nBe granted UW-Whitewater email account and web services.\n\nUniversity Services Available to Recognized Student Organizations\n\nStudent Activities & Involvement\n\nStudent Activities & Involvement is dedicated to developing student leaders and to promoting student involvement in the campus and community. Student Activities & Involvement is responsible for the administration of all policies and procedures related to student organizations. Student Activities & Involvement staff will help student leaders and advisors successfully fulfill roles.\n\nStudent Activities & Involvement sponsors the following events and activities in which recognized student organizations might find it worthwhile to participate.\n\nInvolvement Fairs - held twice annually in September and January/February, the Involvement Fairs are sponsored to help organizations recruit new members and to provide students the opportunity to meet with representatives of the various student organizations.\n\nHomecoming - student organizations are encouraged to participate in the undergraduate homecoming experience to show pride in UW-W and to demonstrate Warhawk spirit.

Those that do not comply will be held accountable via the UW-Whitewater/Recognized Student Organization Code of Conduct.\n\nThe University has the rights and responsibility to place organizations on emergency suspension when deemed appropriate.\n\nRecognized student organizations are expected to recruit and orient new members with dignity and respect. Adherence to the UW-Whitewater Anti Hazing Policy is expected at all stages of student participation in the organization.\n\nRecognized student organizations are expected to extend membership privileges, including voting and eligibility to hold office, to all students without regard to race, color, creed, religion, national origin, disability, ancestry, age, sexual orientation, pregnancy, marital or parental status, veteran status or gender (except as otherwise permitted by Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972). With the exception that, per the UW System Board of Regents Resolution 9279 (adopted 12/06) student organizations that select their members or officers on the basis of commitment to a set of beliefs (e.g. religious or political beliefs) may limit membership, officer positions, or participation in the organization to students who affirm that they support the organization's goals and agree with its beliefs. It is acknowledged that the UW System Policy does not align with Federal Law (Christian Legal Society v Martinez - 08-1371).\n\nRecognized student organizations are expected to exercise reasonable precaution to ensure that their events, services, and programs are safe to all participants and do not cause damage to property or persons. It is the role of Student Activities & Involvement and the Office for Risk Management & Safety to provide guidance to student leaders and advisors on these matters.\n\nRecognized student organizations are expected to follow University policy, guidelines and procedures pertaining to the use of facilities and services provided both on and off campus.\n\nRecognized student organizations are solely responsible for any contract they enter into with third party vendors. The University will not be held liable for these contracts.\n\nRecognized student organizations are expected to conduct their activities in a manner that represents themselves and the University appropriately. While this is a subjective expectation, Student Activities & Involvement staff should be consulted if any activity is in question.\n\nRecognized student organizations and individual members are not exempt from federal, state, or local laws, and are not exempt from University policy. As a result of the action of members who appear to act on behalf of the recognized student organization, student organizations and individual members may be subject to disciplinary action through the Recognized Student Organization Code of Conduct, or the University of Wisconsin System Administrative Code Chapters 17 and 18.\n\nMembers of an organization that is being investigated and adjudicated for alleged violation of University policy are expected to fully cooperate with University officials. Failure to cooperate may result in revocation of University Recognition.\n\nStudent organizations may extend membership to individuals not enrolled at UW-Whitewater provided the majority of the organization's membership is comprised of currently enrolled students.\n\nStudent organization leadership roles must be held by students currently enrolled at UW-Whitewater.\n\nAll Student organization leaders are considered aware and informed of the inherent risk and liability to which they expose themselves, their organization and the University. All reasonable steps to reduce risk and limit liability should be taken.\n\nUW-Whitewater may establish additional requirements for recognition consistent with this policy.\n\nUW-Whitewater Non-Discrimination Policy for Recognized Student Organizations\n\nThe University of Wisconsin-Whitewater is committed to the concepts of equal opportunity, non-discrimination and diversity, and recognizes a special obligation to prepare people of all cultures, orientations and abilities to accept the responsibilities as leaders of tomorrow. Consistent with this, all recognized student organizations must comply with the concepts of nondiscrimination and equal opportunity when recruiting and selecting members. In addition, the University recognizes the important role that student organizations play in this educational process; and is committed to non-discrimination in the recruitment and selection procedures of University faculty and staff members who will, ultimately, serve as advisors of recognized student organizations.\n\nAs part of the criteria for University Recognition, all student organizations must adhere to the concepts of non-discrimination and equal opportunity as they relate to race, color, gender, sex, creed, religion, age, ancestry, national origin, disability, sexual orientation, pregnancy, political affiliation, marital or parental status, veteran status, or arrest and conviction record, in their educational programs and activities. In holding with the tenets of non-discrimination, the University stresses the importance of eliminating discriminatory and/or culturally insensitive language, behavior and content from University sponsored activities and urges all recognized student organizations to cooperate in this effort.\n\nWith very narrow exceptions, student organizations may not discriminate in their selection of officers or members.\n\nUW-Whitewater Anti-Hazing Policy\n\nStudents, student organizations, athletic teams and other student groups of the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater community are strictly prohibited from engaging in any type of hazing activity. Hazing is defined as \"any action taken or situation created, intentionally, whether on or off campus, that produces mental or physical discomfort, embarrassment, harassment, or ridicule.\" This includes any action that endangers the health or well-being of an individual, is personally degrading, has an adverse effect on the academic performance of the student, or which violates any federal, state or local statute or University policy. Individual or group consent to a hazing activity in no way validates the activity or excludes those perpetuating it from being charged with a crime.\n\nIndividual members, organizations and groups who violate this policy are subject to University disciplinary action, as set forth in the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater Student Non-Academic Disciplinary Procedures under UW System Administrative Code, Chapter 17. This document is available for review at the Office of Student Affairs, the Whitewater Student Government Office, or at the Library Reserve Desk.\n\nAdditionally, any University student organization, group or individual student violating this policy or the Wisconsin Statute on Hazing, is subject to sanctions that may be imposed by the judicial or coordinating body of which the organization is a constituent member and/or a court of law. The Wisconsin Statute on Hazing, 948.51, is available for review at Student Activities & Involvement, the Library Reference Desk, or from your state representative. Examples of activities or situations that could meet the definition of hazing include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nKeeping the date of initiation/induction a secret; requiring signatures for initiation.\n\n\"Kidnapping\" of any member, leaving members stranded in a remote location to find their way home, or scavenger/treasure hunts.\n\nAny form of forced physical activity and/or exercise, whether extreme or not (i.e. push-ups, sit-ups or other calisthenics, runs, walks, etc.).\n\nPhysical harassment such as paddling, hitting, beating, slapping, pushing or striking.\n\nMarking or branding.\n\nPersonal servitude of any kind (i.e. phone duty, cleaning, yard work, doing errands, etc.).\n\nForcing or encouraging ingesting of any type of liquid or solid matter, edible or non-edible (i.e. alcohol, chewing tobacco, goldfish, raw onions, spoiled food, dirt, etc.).\n\nRequiring the carrying of any item around campus, such as paddles, rocks, books, shields, etc.\n\nRequiring the wearing of unusual, embarrassing or uncomfortable clothing.\n\nSleep deprivation or requiring/encouraging anyone to sleep anywhere other than their own residence or bed.\n\nPreventing personal hygiene, communication with certain groups, and/or restricting places that new members can go on campus or in the community.\n\nVerbal abuse such as yelling or screaming or labeling with silly or embarrassing nicknames.\n\nAny activity that interferes with a student's academic pursuits (class attendance, studying, etc.).\n\nRequiring or suggesting that members vandalize, destroy or steal property or commit crimes.\n\nRequiring anything of one group of members that is not required of another.\n\nEvaluation of what specific conduct may constitute hazing shall be made with reference to what a reasonable person might consider hazing under those particular circumstances.\n\nEnforcement of the UW-Whitewater Anti-Hazing Policy shall be the administrative responsibility of the Dean of Students Office, Andersen 2130, and Student Activities & Involvement, University Center Room 146. Individuals or groups seeking additional information about this policy or reporting possible violations should contact staff in Student Activities & Involvement at 262-472-6217.\n\nSubmit a conduct complaint electronically\n\nRelated Documents\n\nFor policies related to posting, mailbox stuffing, fundraising, sign boards, chalking, table tents, and other things related to student organizations.\n\nSubmit a conduct complaint electronically\n\nDefinitions\n\nAdvisor: UW-W unclassified or classified staff member who has agreed or is appointed to serve as an advisor to a Recognized student organization.\n\nApplication: The process for new student organizations to receive University Recognition.\n\nDisciplinary Probation: A status of a Recognized student organization meaning that, through the process outlined in the Student Organization Conduct Policy, the student organization may agree or is placed on Disciplinary Probation as a result of a violation of University policy. Disciplinary Probation is accompanied by sanction(s) and a timeline for return to Good Standing. Disciplinary Probation signifies a warning status that any further violation of policy may result in Disciplinary Suspension or Revocation of University Recognition.\n\nDisciplinary Suspension: A status of a Recognized student organization meaning that the student organization continues to be Recognized, but the Rights and Benefits of Recognition are suspended. Therefore, the student organization on Disciplinary Suspension will be held accountable for their behavior during the period of time that they are on Disciplinary Suspension. Any violation of University policy, federal or state law, or city ordinance during the time of the Disciplinary Suspension may be grounds for the immediate Revocation of University Recognition. All violations will be dealt with through the process outlined in the Student Organization Conduct Policy. Upon the conclusion of the suspension period the student organization must re-apply for University Recognition (see Re-application for University Recognition, below).\n\nEmergency Suspension: All activities of a Recognized student organization may be immediately suspended if University officials have reason to believe that the safety of individuals or the community may be in jeopardy. An Emergency Suspension is followed by an investigation as outlined in the Student Organization Conduct Policy.\n\nEvent(s): Any activity sponsored, co-sponsored, or organized by a Recognized student organization.\n\nGood Standing: A status of a Recognized student organization meaning that all requirements for University Recognition are fulfilled and full rights and benefits of University Recognition are extended to the student organization.\n\nNot-For-Profit: Per the UW System, for eligibility for SUF allocable funding, this term is not the same definition as used for state or federal tax purposes. Thus, registration as a student organization will not automatically result in exemption from state or federal income tax or state sales tax. If an organization has obtained tax-exempt status from taxing authorities, however, documentation of that status would demonstrate that the organization is organized on a “not-for-profit” basis.\n\nRe-Application for University Recognition: Upon the conclusion of the terms set forth in the Disciplinary Suspension, the student organization must re-apply to receive the full benefits of University Recognition. A request for re-application consists of the completion of the requirements set-forth in this policy to Renew University Recognition. Upon receipt of the re-application, staff in Student Activities & Involvement will conduct an administrative review to ensure that all conditions of the Disciplinary Suspension have been met. If these conditions are met, then the organization will be placed on Disciplinary Probation for a period of one year from the date of Renewal.\n\nRenewal: The annual process for previously Recognized student organizations to continue their University recognition. Organizations not completing the Renewal process annually will need to Apply for University Recognition.\n\nRevocation of University Recognition: Through the process outlined in the Student Organization Conduct Policy, a student organization may have their University Recognition revoked. University Recognition may also be revoked if a student organization on Disciplinary Suspension violates University policy, city law or ordinance, and/or State or federal law. If this occurs, then University officials may determine it appropriate to revoke the University’s Recognition of the student organization.\n\nStudent: In regards to student organization policy, means any person who is enrolled in three or more credits at UW-Whitewater for the current academic semester. A person is still considered a student until the next instructional semester begins or they have graduated.\n\nUniversity Affiliated Organization: An organization comprised mostly of students that is part of a University program and directly connected to the mission of a University office. Some examples of University Affiliated Organizations are: Whitewater Student Government, Leadership Involvement Teams, Homecoming Steering Committee, Marching Band and Cheerleading/Stuntmen Squads. This category of student group does not apply to intercollegiate athletic teams governed by NCAA. University Affiliated Organizations are not required to complete the process for University Recognition, but do fall under the jurisdiction of the Student Organization Conduct Policy.\n\nUniversity Recognized Student Organization: A student group that has completed the University Recognition process. All rights and benefits of Recognition are extended, provided the student organization is in good standing.\n\nPolicy History\n\nRevised May 22, 2020 Revised August 12, 2020 Revised May 1st 2017 Revised October 20th 2016 Revised April 1st 2005\n\nLast review : 08/19/2022\n\nScheduled Review for Student Handbook\n\nNext review: 07/01/2023 | Dean of Students\n\nWhat is FERPA?\n\nThe essence of FERPA can be summarized by the following two points - confidentiality and access. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 - commonly known as FERPA, the Privacy Act, or the Buckley Amendment - is a federal law designed to protect the privacy of educational records. FERPA governs and protects your rights to your individual educational records.\n\nThe following primary rights are protected under FERPA:\n\nStudents' rights to review and inspect their educational records;\n\nStudents’ rights to have their educational records amended or corrected;\n\nStudents’ rights to control disclosure of certain portions of their educational records.\n\nWhat are educational records?\n\nAn educational record is any record (in any medium), with certain exceptions, maintained by UW-Whitewater that is directly related to you as a student. This record can contain your name, several students’ names, or information that can personally (individually) identify you.\n\nWhat are not educational records?\n\nPersonal notes of faculty and staff\n\nMedical and counseling records used solely for treatment\n\nUniversity Police Department records\n\nFinancial records of a parent or spouse\n\nCan I review and inspect my records?\n\nRequests to review your records must be made in writing and presented to the appropriate office responsible for the record. The written request must indicate specifically the records you wish to review. The office will have up to 45 days to honor your request. For most students the areas responsible for your record will include the Registrar’s Office, dean and department chair’s offices of your major, academic advising offices, and possibly the Dean of Students Office.\n\nDirectory Information (Public Records)\n\nFERPA allows for the release of specified items of information not generally considered harmful or an invasion of privacy if disclosed. UW-Whitewater, in accordance with FERPA, has designated the following categories of information about individual students as directory (public) information. This information will be released to any inquirer unless you specifically request that all of the items on the following list be withheld.\n\nName\n\nAddress\n\nEmail address\n\nTelephone number (excluding cell)\n\nDates of attendance\n\nEnrollment status (full/part time)\n\nClassification (e.g., sophomore, senior, graduate student)\n\nMajor/minor/degree program\n\nDegrees and dates of graduation, including anticipated graduation dates\n\nPrevious institutions attended\n\nAwards and academic honors\n\nParticipation in officially recognized sports and activities\n\nPhysical factors (weight and height) of members of athletic teams\n\nNon-Directory Information (Private Records)\n\nNon-directory information includes items which are considered private, or protected, and which cannot be identified as directory information. Examples of private information include, but are not limited to:\n\nSocial security number\n\nRace\n\nReligion\n\nNational origin\n\nGender\n\nGrades\n\nWho can request access to your records?\n\nUnder FERPA, prior written consent must be obtained before a student’s educational record may be disclosed to a third party, with some exceptions. FERPA allows UW-Whitewater school officials to share your educational record information (public and private information) without your written consent with other UW-Whitewater university officials who have a legitimate educational interest. Legitimate educational interest means a university official has the need to know specific information in your educational record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibilities. The school official does not have authorization to transmit, share, or disclose any or all of that information to a third party who does not have a legitimate educational interest. Instances in which prior written consent is not required for release of your record:\n\nWhen there is a significant threat to the health and safety of you or other individuals\n\nIn accordance with a lawful subpoena or court order\n\nRelease of directory information, if not restricted\n\nIf you are under the age of 21, FERPA permits UW-Whitewater to inform your parent/guardian if you are found in violation of alcohol or drug rules.\n\nRestricting your directory information:\n\nYou have the right to restrict the release of all directory information. If you wish to do so, you must complete and file the “Request to Prevent Disclosure of Directory Information” form available in the Registrar’s Office. Please consider very carefully the consequences of restricting your directory information. Should you decide to restrict the release of your directory information, any future requests for such information from non-university parties or organizations will be refused. For example, UW-Whitewater could not:\n\nAn enrollment verification to your health insurance provider or a prospective employer\n\nYour name in the commencement booklet\n\nYour GPA\n\nYour student schedule\n\nYour academic standing\n\nYour student ID number\n\nYour student employment record\n\nRecords of campus disciplinary proceedings are considered protected with the exception of a crime of violence or of a non-forcible sex offense. FERPA affords the university discretion to disclose the final results of a disciplinary hearing regarding an incident alleged to involve acts of violence or of a non-forcible sex offense to the public. Disclosure to the victim is required.\n\nRespect the rights of others\n\nThe university expects that you will respect the rights of faculty and other students as you participate in the educational process. Follow the guidelines below to ensure the privacy of other students:\n\nWhen e-mailing groups of students, always use blind carbon copy (Bcc :).\n\nDo not post personal information about other students on websites or share personal information via e-mail.\n\nIf you participate in a course that uses a course management system (e.g., D2L) you may have access to personal information and academic work produced by other students and faculty members. Examples include class lists, discussion board postings, drafts of papers, and other work produced in the course. Do not share information about classmates, course work content, or its authors to anyone outside the course.\n\nPersonally Identifiable Information Access Exceptions\n\nCircumstances where personally identifiable information may be released without prior written consent:\n\nTo any third party designated by a Federal or State Authority to evaluate a federal- or state- supported education program\n\nIn connection with financial aid for which the student has applied or which the student has received, if the information is necessary for such purposes as to:\n\nTo a victim of an alleged perpetrator of a crime of violence or non-forcible sex offense. (Only the final results of the disciplinary proceeding, regardless of whether the postsecondary institution concluded that a violation was committed.)\n\nTo anyone if the disclosure is in connection with a disciplinary proceeding at a postsecondary institution if it determines that the student is an alleged perpetrator of a crime of violence or non-forcible sex offense and with respect to the allegation against him or her the student has committed a violation of the institution’s rules or policies\n\nTo organizations conducting studies on behalf of schools\n\nIn connection with Statewide Longitudinal Data Systems\n\nTo accrediting organizations\n\nTo parents of a dependent student\n\nTo comply with a judicial order or subpoena (reasonable effort to notify)\n\nIn a health or safety emergency\n\nTo schools in which a student seeks or intends to enroll\n\nHow to Protect Your Own Records\n\nKnow what information you have elected to withhold and/or disclose, and review it regularly\n\nBe careful about sharing private information via cell phones and other wireless technology\n\nTake caution when using websites, electronic communication, and social media. Do not reveal information that compromises your privacy or the privacy of others\n\nEducate yourself about safe computing and protecting your privacy\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\nWill my family have access to my information?\n\nGenerally not. Without your express, written permission, your family, like all other third parties, may have access only to your directory information. We encourage you to talk with your family to discuss grades, classes, class schedules, financial statements, or other private information. The only way for your family to receive this information is for you to provide it to them. Student records (e.g., grades and financial statements) are available on the WINS account. You should never share your NetID and password with your family or others.\n\nWill the university contact my parents if I get in trouble?\n\nIf you are under the age of 21, FERPA permits UW-Whitewater to inform your parent/guardian if you are found in violation of alcohol or drug rules.\n\nDoes FERPA prevent the university from sharing information about troubled students?\n\nUW-Whitewater may disclose information from education records, without consent, to appropriate parties whose knowledge of the information is necessary to protect the health or safety of you or other individuals.\n\nComplaints\n\nYou have the right to file a complaint with the US Department of Education concerning alleged failures by UW Whitewater to comply with the requirements of FERPA. The complaint must contain specific allegations of facts providing cause to believe that a violation of FERPA has occurred.\n\nFamily Policy Compliance Office\n\nU.S. Department of Education\n\n400 Maryland Avenue, SW\n\nWashington, DC 20202-8520"
