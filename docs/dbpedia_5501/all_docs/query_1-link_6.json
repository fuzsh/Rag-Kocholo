But know this: the plans of God are steadfast and unshakeable. God is doing remarkable things through those who desire to serve Him.\n\nThis is why my father founded Regent University—to provide passionate individuals with a place to sharpen their skills and prepare them to help transform the world through Christian leadership.\n\nRegent University is an academic environment where Christian leaders are taught to discern and respond to the times. Through the years, we have created a university that is a leading center for Christian thought and action. Our graduates are servant leaders who are providing godly solutions to many of the challenges we face as a society.\n\nIf there were ever a time to get involved in a worthy cause, this is that time. Regent University exists for such a time as this. America—and the world—need Christian leadership, and you may be one of those leaders.\n\nI invite you to seize this opportunity. Be a part of what God is doing in these dramatic days. Cooperate with God, and become a leader to your generation. And know that we at Regent University stand ready to assist you in fulfilling your academic and professional goals."
