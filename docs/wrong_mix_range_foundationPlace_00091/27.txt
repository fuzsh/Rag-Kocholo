I just love it when I can do good while shopping. Tiny Showcase has been running a unique print sale since 2005 wherein a percentage of the money from each print sold is donated to a charity chosen by the artist.

Deth Sun, for example, has chosen to donate $250 to the San Francisco SPCA no matter how many copies of Infinite Possibilities he sells.

Buying Mensa Masters by Amy Ruppel will benefit Direct Relief International.

When you pick up ghostpatrol’s Bear in Socks and Gloves, you indirectly donate to The Devils in Danger Foundation.

Cute! Jay Ryan’s Untitled benefits the University of Maryland’s The Art Gallery.

Unfortunately, Tim Gough’s The Fire Breather is sold out, but that’s good for the University of Maryland’s The Art Gallery.

Note: Each run is printed on archival Hahnemühle German Printmaking Paper. The archival ink is specially treated and sprayed, giving it an archival lifespan of over 60 years. Your art, properly cared for, will last a goodly long time.
