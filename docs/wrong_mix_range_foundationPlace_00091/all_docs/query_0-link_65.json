The Ordinance governs the way pests are managed on all City properties, but does not apply to private property. Specifically, the law applies to any City staff or contractors managing unwanted insects, rodents, birds, weeds, or other organisms for buildings & landscapes that are:\n\nOwned by the City, even if in other counties, or\n\nLeased from the City (with leases signed after 1996), such as golf courses or vendors at SF Airport.\n\nThe IPM ordinance contains requirements for:\n\nHow integrated pest management (IPM) is implemented\n\nLimitations on pesticide products - San Francisco Reduced Risk Pesticide List\n\nExemptions to the Reduced Risk Pesticide List\n\nPosting and notification for pesticide treatments\n\nRecordkeeping and data requirements\n\nAccountability\n\nFor simplicity's sake, we have assembled a printable Compliance Checklist. Some key resources for City operations are:\n\nIPM technical resources: Information on specific pests and management techniques\n\nList of departmental IPM coordinators for the City & County of San Francisco\n\nSigns for posting: Posting is required 3 days before to 4 days after pesticide spraying\n\nReporting pesticide use data (password required)\n\nRequest exemptions for pesticides not listed on the Reduced Risk Pesticide List (City IPM staff only)\n\nSign up for emails to be notified of upcoming IPM TAC meetings or other events\n\nReduced Risk Pesticide List\n\nThe Reduced Risk Pesticide List is maintained and updated annually by San Francisco's IPM Program, which includes the Department of the Environment and other City department stakeholders. These pesticide products may only be used as a last resort after other, non-chemical management options have been exhausted, and in keeping with limitations listed. The List is only appropriate for City staff or contractors managing pests on City property. It is not relevant to US Green Building Council LEED requirements, which are described elsewhere.\n\nEach product on the list has been::\n\n1. Screened using the SF Pesticide Hazard Screening Protocol\n\n2. Reviewed by the SF IPM Technical Advisory Committee (IPM TAC). The IPM TAC is convened by the Department of the Environment and is composed of City IPM Coordinators, contractors, IPM specialists from non-City agencies, and other interested parties. Each year, the TAC considers product hazards, potential for exposure, data gaps, and existence of safer alternatives before placing products on the List\n\n3. Presented at a public hearing\n\n4. Approved by the Commission on the Environment\n\nThe SF Reduced-Risk Pesticide List is not appropriate for non-City-owned properties or other agencies because it:\n\nIncludes products available only to professionals\n\nIncludes products that are more hazardous than required for household use\n\nIs tailored to the special needs of San Francisco facilities and local microclimates\n\nLease and contract language\n\nLeases: Because all properties leased from the City fall within the requirements of the IPM Ordinance, the ordinance must be referenced in any new lease agreements. Properties leased by the City should also include such language when possible. Here is some sample language:\n\nLeasee, and any pest management contractors operating on the leased property, shall comply with all requirements of San Francisco's Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Ordinance (Chapter 3, San Francisco Environment Code) These requirements include, but are not limited to: Using pesticides as a last resort, using only pesticides on the current SF Reduced Risk Pesticide List, posting notifications of all pesticide applications three days before treatment, leaving these postings for at least four days after treatment, and reporting all pesticide use by staff or contractors. Details can be found at the San Francisco Department of the Environment website, /node/3898?repaired.\n\nService contracts: City departments who contract for landscape rennovations or similar services should include the following language in the contracts to ensure that activities are conducted according to the law's requirements.\n\nVendor shall comply with all requirements of San Francisco's Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Ordinance (Chapter 3, San Francisco Environment Code). These requirements include, but are not limited to: Using pesticides as a last resort, using only pesticides on the current SF Reduced Risk Pesticide List, posting notifications of all pesticide applications three days before treatment, leaving these postings for at least four days after treatment, and reporting all pesticide use in a format acceptable to the San Francisco Department of the Environment. Pesticide use on green roofs, or for any other purpose not permitted under the current SF Reduced Risk Pesticide List, is prohibited without an exemption from the San Francisco Department of the Environment. Details can be found at the San Francisco Department of the Environment website, /node/3898?repaired.\n\nSafe disposal of pesticides\n\nCity departments who need to safely dispose of pesticide products - or other hazardous waste - can schedule pickups by the Department of Public Health.\n\nPesticide use trends (on City properties)\n\nView the latest data here; including interactive graphs.\n\nOther accomplishments:\n\nDecreased pesticide use by about 70-80% since the start of the program.\n\nDecreased the in-City use of glyphosate - the active ingredient in Roundup - by 96% since 2010.\n\nProhibited pre-emergent herbicides (with the exception of airport runways, which are subject to FAA regulations).\n\nOne of the first cities to ban the use of single-feed rodenticides (2006), due to data on adverse impacts to predatory birds. This ban followed a community process incorporating nonprofits and the SF Department of Public Health.\n\nBanned the use of gopher baits as a precautionary measure (2009), due to the potential for adverse impacts on other wildlife.\n\nRemoved the last neonicitinoid insecticide from City properties (2014). \"Neonics\" have been implicated as contributing to declines in worldwide bee populations, in combination with other factors.\n\nResources\n\nIPM Plans - Model IPM plans created by San Francisco departments or other agencies\n\nIPM Plan for the California Academy of Sciences\n\nGuidelines -\n\nPest Prevention By Design Guidelines - Compendiums of design elements for preventing or reducing pest infestations. Available for both structures and landscapes.\n\nResearch -\n\nCompost Tea: Literature review on production, application and plant disease management\n\nMeetings, exemptions, and other public information\n\nAnnual public hearing - Every year, the Integrated Pest Management Program holds a public hearing regarding pest management activities on City properties. This year's hearing will be held on Wednesday, July 10, 5pm-7pm, in City Hall Room 416. The supporting materials are posted here.\n\nExemptions granted - City departments must request special exemptions to use pesticides that are not on the current Reduced Risk Pesticide List. In a few cases, exemptions may also be granted to posting requirements. All exemptions that are approved are automatically posted on this page.\n\nReports of any federal or state pesticide violations - including unsafe application or use in violation of the pesticide label - should be directed to the SF Agricultural Commissioners Office, housed at the Department of Public Health's Pesticide Use Enforcement Program at (415)252-3862.\n\nComplaints, comments, or concerns about pesticide use or pest problems on City properties can be registered directly with the relevant City department by calling \"311,\" or can be entered in our list. We will direct the issue to the appropriate City agency.\n\nIntegrated Pest Management Technical Advisory Committee Meetings (IPM TAC)\n\nNewest presentations (Sept, 2020 - Present): See the SF IPM YouTube Channel\n\nOlder Presentations: Videos courtesy of Pestec\n\nAugust 7, 2014. \"Bed bug management in multiunitresidential housing.\" Presentation by Dr. Andrew Sutherland, University of California Statewide Integrated Pest Management Program.
