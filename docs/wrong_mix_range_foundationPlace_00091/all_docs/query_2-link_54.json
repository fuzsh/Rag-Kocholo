The needs of these children are greater than public funding are able to provide. The Children's Foundation of America identifies and accesses resources to support foster care, adoption, residential treatment, mental health and community-based programs of the highest quality, so that children in need or who have been the victims of trauma, abuse, neglect or abandonment may lead healthy, productive lives."
