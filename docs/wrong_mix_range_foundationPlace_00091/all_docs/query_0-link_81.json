        "text": "CIG program goal\n\nOur goal is to close the education achievement gap for students from pre-kindergarten through fifth grade (pre-K–5) who come from underserved and under-resourced communities in the Bay Area.\n\nProgram investment opportunity and model\n\nThe achievement gap in foundational literacy and numeracy begins at an early age, and the gap follows many of these students throughout their educational and career journey. The issue is particularly acute for students who are from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds, students who are English language learners, and students of color who are from low-income families in high-need communities, are not performing at proficiency level, or are at risk of falling behind. Students have also been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and disrupted instructional time. This disruption has resulted in lack of access to basic needs, a steep learning loss, isolation, and lack of social-emotional learning opportunities.\n\nIt is never too early. Studies have shown that return on investment for education is optimal when efforts are made to support children at an earlier age. \"Early skills breed later skills because early learning begets later learning.\" (Source: \"The Productivity Argument for Investing in Young Children\" by James J. Heckman and Dimitriy V. Masterov, 2007.)\n\nThrough CIGs, Cisco invests in nonprofit partners who are equipping low-income pre-K–5 students with the literacy and numeracy skills necessary to be successful early in their educational pathway. The goal is to provide a strong foundation for future learning and access to higher education and career opportunities, including science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) subjects and fields.\n\nWe offer annual cash grants to selected direct-service nonprofit partners that are diverse in size, leadership, and service offerings to foster a local ecosystem consisting of organizations addressing the challenge at hand.\n\nWe seek to fund promising program models with potential for replication and scaling across communities, as well as new innovations that have potential to close the achievement gap.\n\nWe use other corporate resources to offer integrated support to grantee partners, including employee volunteerism, Cisco technology donations, advisory support, and networking opportunities.\n\nApplying this approach for deeper engagement over multiple years, we invest and partner with service organizations to help strengthen their organizational capacity to take their program/service to the next level in order to position them for long-term viability and impact on the students and their families.\n\nFocus area\n\nPre-K–5 education: Foundational literacy and numeracy, along with integration of social-emotional learning in instructional support\n\nPast and current CIG grantee partners\n\n826 Valencia (Bay View, San Francisco)\n\nBay Area Tutoring Association (San Jose)\n\nCatholic Charities CYO of the Archdiocese of San Francisco (East Palo Alto)\n\nChapter 510 (Oakland)\n\nChildren Rising (Oakland)\n\nGirls Inc. of Alameda County (Oakland)\n\nJamestown Community Center, Inc. (Mission District, San Francisco)\n\nOlimpico Learning (Santa Clara County)\n\nPartners in School Innovation (Bay View, San Francisco)\n\nProject Read (Redwood City)\n\nRaising a Reader (Bay Area)\n\nReading Partners (Bay Area)\n\nSafe Passages (Oakland)\n\nSan Jose Grail Family Services (Alum Rock School District, San Jose)\n\nSan Jose Public Library Foundation (in support of the social-emotional learning evaluation work under development by the Extended Learning Community of Practice)\n\nSilicon Valley Education Foundation (Santa Clara and San Mateo counties)\n\nThink Together (San Jose)\n\nThe CIG program involves a volunteer employee review committee. Serving for a one-year term, specially trained committee members review written applications, meet with applicants, and serve as champions for selected grantee partners. Employee champions often extend their annual commitment to advocate for grantee partners through the cycles of their grant partnership with Cisco. The committee uses the following evaluation criteria to make funding recommendations to the Cisco Foundation.\n\nAddresses a significant unmet need\n\nThe proposed program addresses a problem that affects a large number of lives within the target area. The significant unmet need requires urgent action.\n\nTakes an innovative and impactful approach to the social problem\n\nThe proposed program is innovative in its approach to meet the needs of the target population and has significant/lasting impact on the people being served.\n\nServes at least 65 percent underserved population\n\nThe target audience of the program includes a minimum of 65 percent economically underserved populations relative to the average standards of the target geography.\n\nIncorporates metrics to monitor program progress and measure impact\n\nThe program clearly defines and utilizes SMART metrics (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Timely) to monitor progress and measure impact. The highest priority and funding consideration are given to proposals that clearly articulate the planned result of their efforts, as well as the metrics that will be used to measure that result.\n\nBuilds strategic partnerships\n\nThe organization collaborates with public/private entities for greater program impact and reach.\n\nShows potential to be replicable, scalable, and sustainable\n\nProgram design has potential to be replicated and scaled to other communities. The long-term plan for the program enables it to flourish significantly beyond the resources provided by Cisco.\n\nShows potential to make use of technology\n\nCIGs do not require the program to include the use of technology. However, greater consideration will be given to organizations that are using technology or can incorporate it into program delivery and reach of services.\n\nShows potential to leverage a strong relationship with Cisco employees and peer-learning opportunities within a community of practice among extended learning service providers.\n\nCIGs do not require the program to have an employee volunteerism component. However, greater consideration will be given to organizations that are using or can use Cisco employee volunteers, expertise, or leadership in their organization and/or in program delivery.\n\nPossesses outstanding leadership\n\nThe organization has a credible track record in the relevant area and an outstanding leader and/or management team with qualities that help advance the organization's mission.\n\nAligns with Cisco goals and values\n\nThe organization meets all the criteria, guidelines, and requirements as defined for Cisco's Community Impact Grant program.\n\nOrganizational requirements\n\nProgram serves communities within 50-mile radius of Cisco headquarters in San Jose: Cisco seeks to partner with qualifying nonprofit organizations that offer programs to benefit communities within a 50-mile radius of Cisco's corporate headquarters in San Jose, California. The physical headquarters of the organization need not be within this radius, as long as an affiliate office operates and/or administers programs within the specified area.\n\nUnderserved population: The goal of the CIG program is to benefit people who are underserved. Funding from the CIG program is meant to support organizations that serve a population that is more than 65 percent economically underserved relative to the average standards of the target geography.\n\n501(c)(3) tax exemption status: CIGs support only nonprofit organizations that are recognized by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as tax-exempt under Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)(3) and are classified by the IRS as a public charity. Programs applying through a fiscal sponsorship must submit the grant application through the fiscal sponsor organization and include required documentation for both the sponsored project/program and the fiscal sponsor.\n\nPercentage for core mission support: Cisco understands that core mission support functions are vital and integral to the success of the organization and to the provision of services. With this in mind, an organization's overhead can be up to 25 percent. (Exemptions from this requirement are determined on a case-by-case basis. Organizations must be exceptionally aligned with Cisco's values and criteria, and clearly explain and justify their overhead costs.)\n\nAll applications must be completed using our online application form. Cisco will not consider incomplete proposals or paper-based applications.\n\nIneligible programs and/or activities\n\nProposals in the following areas are not eligible for a CIG:\n\nMiscellaneous exclusions: general operating expenses, other than those that are directly associated with the program itself; individuals; research programs; membership-based activities; programs that promote or serve only one culture, race, religion, population group, or political viewpoint—rather than the community at large; and religious, political, or sectarian organizations. (Note: A direct service program run by a faith-based organization may be eligible. See our grant giving policies.)\n\nHospitals: private or public hospitals; hospital foundations; medical centers, research centers, and so forth. (Programs based in a hospital may be eligible; however, grant funds must go exclusively to direct service in the community, not to general hospital operating expenses.)\n\nSchools and scholarships: private, public, or charter schools; school foundations, booster clubs, and/or fundraising organizations affiliated with a particular school; colleges/universities; scholarships, stipends, or loans within a program; and/or school-related activities such as field trips and research programs.\n\nEvents: athletic events, competitions, or tournaments; conferences, seminars, workshops; festivals, field trips, or other recreational events; fundraising events or sponsorships (including benefit dinners, walks/runs, concerts, and sports teams).\n\nPhilanthropic: capital building funds, challenge grants, and grant-making organizations (all other foundations, including private foundations, family foundations, and school foundations).\n\nPolicy on the funding of equipment\n\nIn general, Cisco does not fund the purchase of computer hardware or software, but it may consider doing so only in cases where: 1) such resources are used in a strategically innovative manner, thereby extending their impact well beyond everyday/staff use; and 2) such resources are not available through other, more cost-effective means such as in-kind donation. Applicants must demonstrate that they have thoroughly explored such avenues without success.\n\nPolicy on board of directors review and approval\n\nCisco requires applicants to certify that the chairperson or at least one officer of the organization's board of directors has reviewed the grant proposal and that the organization's board is aware of the application and supports its submission. Cisco also requires applicants to certify the accuracy of the proposal and to confirm that the organization complies with the policies stated on this website.\n\nPolicy on reviews of accuracy/compliance\n\nAll applicants are subject to reviews of their representations in their grant applications, their compliance with the policies stated above, and, if applicable, their adherence to the terms of the grant contract. If such a review reveals significant inaccuracies or violations of the policies stated above, or if an organization does not cooperate with the review, the organization may be required to return any granted assets and forfeit future funding eligibility.\n\nWritten grant contract\n\nGrantee organizations are required to sign a donation agreement electronically before donations can be delivered.\n\nReporting and performance tracking\n\nCisco looks for grant proposals in which concrete measures of success can be used to assess performance. Organizations that receive funding will be required to use our online grant platform to customize performance metrics for their project and to measure their progress at midyear and at the end of the grant year. Informal quarterly/periodic check-ins will be conducted over the life of the partnership. Meaningful participation in this process is a requirement for continued funding eligibility.\n\nCisco grant giving policies\n\nIn addition, organizations must adhere to Cisco policies related to nondiscrimination, religious proselytizing, nonsupport of violence and terrorism, advocacy, lobbying, and other political activities and other areas listed in grant giving policies."
