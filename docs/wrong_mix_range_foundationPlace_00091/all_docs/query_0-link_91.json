        "text": "At a time when domestic violence runs rampant in our society, there are a number of community based organizations that serve the San Francisco Bay Area. The Ariana Mae Hatami Foundation (AMHF) is a place where we work through and in partnership with local agencies that are aligned with our purpose. We provide added resources so that victims of domestic violence will receive an extra layer of help. Our purpose is to help connect people, be a liaison to someone who is lost or does not know where to turn because they have become victimized.\n\nGo to the interactive map that guides you to your nearest crisis center, safe haven, counseling service, or church that have partnered with AMHF to provide support to women in critical need.\n\nUnder the Ariana Mae Hatami Foundation (AMHF), there are no social classes or racial boundaries in order to receive the aid (financial or emotional) that is available to meet the needs of women who truly need it. AMHF operates on the “big heart” philosophy that was conceived from the young woman herself. Ariana told the people around her that she has a big heart and from that fundamental principle, we will strive to remove barriers that would otherwise cause additional hardship.\n\nRelationship abuse and domestic violence are a fateful everyday occurrence. Our daughter, Ariana did not realize she was in danger of her life until it was too late. This foundation was created to help others realize the warning signs and to seek help."
