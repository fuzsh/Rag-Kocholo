        "text": "Did you know we share our home with one of the most powerful and important species in our ecosystem? Pumas (also called mountain lions) have long called the Bay Area home. As our urban edge expands, our homes overlap more and more. Pumas play an important part in keeping our ecosystem healthy, which is why it is important we learn to appreciate and live safely alongside them! That is where the Bay Area Puma Project comes into play.\n\nThe Bay Area Puma Project (BAPP) is a project of the Felidae Fund, a world class organization dedicated to research and education. BAPP's goal is to research the Bay Area's puma population and help the residents understand their natural neighbors. Together, we can build a safe world that protects our natural ecosystems.\n\nWe've got good news: you have an incredibly unique set of skills that will help protect the natural world. We need people just like you to help us create change right now in our very own backyard.\n\nTogether, we can make a difference."
