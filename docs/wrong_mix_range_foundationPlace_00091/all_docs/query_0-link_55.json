        "text": "HSH and our partners offer housing assistance to people who are experiencing homelessness or are about to lose their housing within 14 days.\n\nCoordinated Entry Access Points\n\nContact a Coordinated Entry Access Point to get assistance.\n\nAccess Point staff provide housing problem solving (including relocation assistance) and assess your needs. If you’re eligible, they connect you with housing resources and other community services for people experiencing homelessness in San Francisco.\n\nOther Housing Problem Solving\n\nFive other locations offer problem solving both for people over 18 and for families. They do not provide housing assessments or other Coordinated Entry services.\n\nOther Resources\n\nPeople at risk of homelessness can apply for San Francisco’s Emergency Rental Assistance Program.\n\nUnaccompanied minors (under age 18) can contact Huckleberry House or Diamond Youth Shelter to access shelter and other resources.\n\nSurvivors of violence are welcome at all Access Points. Visit sf.gov for additional resources.\n\nOther agencies offer housing for low-income people, including the San Francisco Housing Authority and the San Francisco Mayor’s Office of Housing and Community Development."
