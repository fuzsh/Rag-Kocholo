        "text": "The Wisdom Study\n\nThe WISDOM Study (Women Informed to Screen Depending on Measures of risk) is working to revolutionize breast cancer detection by testing a novel, personalized approach to breast screening based on each woman’s individual risk (genetics, lifestyle, health history, breast density), compared to annual mammograms- the standard of care, based on 30-year-old data. Through advances in medicine over these years we’ve learned that breast cancer isn’t just one disease, and women’s risk for developing these diseases varies. When it comes to breast screening, one size may not fit all. That’s why WISDOM is using the best tools in modern medicine and gathering evidence to determine the best, safest way to screen all women for breast cancer. A way that identifies the most aggressive cancers, and reduces false alarms, unnecessary procedures and the stresses that come with these experiences.\n\nLearn more at thewisdomstudy.org\n\nHelen Diller Comprehensive Cancer Center: Art for Recovery\n\nHelen Diller Comprehensive Cancer Center: Art For Recovery helps cancer patients express themselves through art. In 2009, Hilary Newsom created the event In Our Shoes, showcasing shoes transformed into objects d’art, that are then auctioned off along with other packaged items.\n\nLearn more at cancer.ucsf.edu\n\nStanford Supportive Care Center (SSCC)\n\nStanford Supportive Care Center (SSCC) provides work that is of great importance to The PlumpJack Family. The Cancer Survivorship Program sponsored by the SSCC recognizes the life-changing role this disease plays in the lives of all touched by it, even survivors. In honor of Tessa Newsom, whose oncologist, Dr. Ernest Rosenbaum, founded the program, PlumpJack came together with leaders in the wine community to create Tessa's Cuvee, available at PlumpJack stores.\n\nBreast & Ovarian Cancer Emergency Fund (BOCEF)\n\nThe Breast & Ovarian Cancer Emergency Fund provides quick and compassionate financial assistance to breast cancer patients with limited financial resources, as well as those with no (or inadequate) access to health insurance. PlumpJack supports the BOCEF through its participation in This Old Bag: Power of the Purse. Hilary Newsom has co-chaired the event the last 10 years, which auctions celebrity-owned handbags for the fight against breast cancer.\n\nLearn more at bayareacancer.org\n\nUNICEF\n\nHelen More than half of Ukraine's estimated 7.5 million children have been displaced. The out-flux of people — mostly children and women — fleeing violence in Ukraine dwarfs all other refugee crises of recent years in terms of scale and speed. As of March 24, more than 4 million people — including 1.8 million children — had crossed into Poland, Romania, Moldova, Slovakia, Hungary and other neighboring countries. UNICEF USA helps save and protect the world's most vulnerable children. UNICEF USA is rated one of the best charities to donate to: Less than 3% of every dollar spent goes to administrative costs.\n\nLearn More at Unicefusa.org\n\nThe Representation Project\n\nThrough film, education, and activism, The Representation Project awakens consciousness, spotlights the cost of these stereotypes, and invites everyone to build a more equitable future. Together, they are bending the long arc of history toward intersectional gender justice. This is a person-by-person and community movement.\n\nLearn more at therepresentationproject.org\n\nThe Holy Family Day Home\n\nHoly Family Day Home (HFDH) is the oldest childcare center of its kind in San Francisco providing early-education child care to the children of working families. Through a combination of philanthropy and employee-driven volunteer programs, the PlumpJack Family supports HFDH throughout the year: supplying the Kindergarten class with backpacks filled with school supplies; providing Thanksgiving lunch; and mounting holiday giving trees at PlumpJack properties to purchase warm children’s clothes and gifts during the holidays.\n\nLearn more at holyfamilydayhome.org\n\nThe Hidden Genius Project\n\nThe Hidden Genius Project was founded in 2012 by five Black male entrepreneurs/technologists who were unnerved by the dramatic juxtaposition between the high unemployment of black male youth and the plethora of career opportunities within the local technology sector. To address this challenge, the founders established a program to connect young Black males with the skills, mentors, and experiences that they need to become high-performing entrepreneurs and technologists in a 21st century, global economy.\n\nLearn more at hiddengeniusproject.org"
