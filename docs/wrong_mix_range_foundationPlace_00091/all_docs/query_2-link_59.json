ZSFG has updated masking guidelines effective May 1, 2024, including all inpatient and outpatient locations on campus. Get more information»\n\nEveryone is welcome here, no matter your ability to pay, lack of insurance, or immigration status. We’re much more than a medical facility; we’re a health care community promoting good health for all San Franciscans.\n\nWe’re part of a large group of neighborhood clinics and healthcare providers in the San Francisco Health Network operated by the San Francisco Department of Public Health. In partnership, we provide primary care for all ages, specialty care, dentistry, emergency and trauma care, and acute care for the people of San Francisco."
