        "text": "SD Mayer & Associates LLP, an accounting, technology and financial advisory services solutions provider, today announced that it raised $15,000 for North Bay fire relief efforts. This includes $5,370 raised by staff, a dollar-for-dollar match by the company, and a vehicle donated by Founder and Managing Partner Stephen D. Mayer. This donation will help support the immediate needs of the tens of thousands of survivors affected by last year’s horrific fires.\n\n“October’s North Bay fires were the most destructive in California history, and many of our friends and families are still devastated,” said Mayer. “One of the core pillars of our business is to be active members in our communities. I am proud of our team for immediately launching a fundraising effort to support North Bay fire survivors.”\n\nFrom early October through the end of 2017, 45 staff members raised a total of $5,370 through community fundraisers and their own contributions. SD Mayer then doubled these efforts via a dollar-for-dollar company match. Mayer personally donated his family van to a family who had lost everything, including their vehicle, in the fires.\n\n“Thousands of families have yet to recover from this unimaginable tragedy, and we are at a crucial moment in which we must ask ourselves, ‘What can I do to help?’” said Mayer. “These donations will never truly replace what was lost, but SD Mayer is committed to doing everything we can to help our community during the long, difficult process of rebuilding. Our firm feels humbled and grateful to be in a position to provide support, and we urge others to contribute what they can to the North Bay fire relief efforts.”\n\nThis is a proud day in the history of San Francisco’s oldest all boys school.\n\nIt is with deep gratitude that we announce a $500,000 challenge grant from the Mayer Family that will support the installation of a new turf field on Riordan’s campus. If as a community we can raise $500,000, the Mayer Family will match every dollar. This will be the largest alumni gift in the school’s history.\n\nMore information regarding construction plans for the state-of-the-art field will be announced in the coming months. To date we have received $800,000 in gifts and pledges towards this project, which has an estimated cost of $2.4 million. If we are able to raise the necessary funds, we will break ground in 2019.\n\nThe Mayer Family Field honors a family with a distinct legacy of philanthropic support to Archbishop Riordan High School, starting with Patricia and the late David Mayer who made the investment in a Riordan education for their sons Michael ’71, Steve ’72 and Tim ’74.\n\nThe field has been described as our largest classroom, and a new surface will certainly impact the great young men that we serve now and in the future.\n\nWith this incredibly generous commitment from the Mayer Family, our work is enhanced, but far from complete. If you would like to support this project, please contact Mr. John Ring, jring@riordanhs.org or (415)586-8200 ext. 264. You can also make an immediate gift online here."
