Johnson. She outlines the systemic issue of state and local governments punishing people who experience homelessness and calls for fixing the affordable housing problem. \"It is now up to us to insist that our local and state officials instead enact policies that will end homelessness by providing safe, secure and affordable housing for all of us.\" Dr. Kushel writes.

Are you an organization that wants to authentically involve community members in your program development or evaluation? The UCSF BHHI recently released a report on the largest representative study of homelessness in the United States since the mid-1990s—the California Statewide Study of People Experiencing Homelessness (CASPEH). The CASPEH was guided by a Lived Expertise Advisory Board—a group of advisors from across the state of California who represent a range of lived and living experiences of homelessness. Join Kara Young Ponder, PhD, Lived Expertise Advisory Board Members Michelle Ochoa, Dez Martinez, and Robynne Rose-Haymer as they discuss the nuts and bolts of how they did research together from designing survey questions to helping train field staff, analyzing data and disseminating findings.\n\nRead the Full Article\n\nImage\n\nVideos\n\nWebinar: Black Californians’ Experiences of Homelessness: Findings from CASPEH\n\nBlack Californians are nearly four times more likely than White Californians to experience homelessness.
