        "text": "Incarceration and justice reform’s ripple effects continue to be felt heavily in our society. Our prison news coverage delves into the complex issues surrounding the penal system, shedding light on the ongoing challenges and reforms that impact the lives of those behind bars and the communities they return to- including reporting by prison journalist Steve Brooks, who was selected to participate in the inaugural cohort of the California Local News Fellowship. A state-funded initiative based at the UC Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism to strengthen local public affairs reporting, Brooks will be a part-time contributing writer for Bay City News Foundation. He covers issues of incarceration, criminal justice and human rights.\n\nWith California’s senior population expected to grow by two-thirds in the next two decades, one of the biggest questions is how prepared the state is to meet that challenge. Stay up to date with the latest stories regarding aging in the Bay Area.\n\nEveryone, especially now, needs to have hope. We are publishing a series of stories and profiles that showcase the remarkable volunteers, first responders and everyday heroes who are stepping up to serve our communities. Tell us about the heroes in your life here and sign up for our weekly newsletter here.\n\nData is the starting point for many stories about where we live, how our world is changing and what we might expect in the future. Find the serious and the silly here with comparisons from the Bay Area, which viewed together help to define our region.\n\nThe Bay Area is a hub of artistic expression, attracting artists, writers and musicians from around the globe to live, work and create. We highlight some of the offerings here and invite you to sign up for a weekly newsletter with the weekend’s top choices for streaming movies and in-person events.\n\nWildfires have been devastating for Bay Area communities in the last few years with tremendous loss of life, property and forests. Scientists, fire officials and local leaders worry that climate change and dry conditions are setting us up for another dangerous season. We track the trends and provide news you can use here.\n\nThe history of the Bay Area is full of colorful people, impactful events and stories of innovation and change. We highlight some of those defining features as a way to learn about our evolution as a region.\n\nThe San Francisco Bay Area is fertile ground to investigate the role of policing in diverse communities and police violence against Black and other people of color — and to learn what has worked to cut that violence while ensuring safety in these communities. With 8 million people, the Bay Area is a diverse region made up of separate jurisdictions that have different experiences with police reform efforts, some longer-standing (Oakland and Richmond), others more recent (San Francisco), and one just announced (Vallejo). With this as a backdrop, we applied a solutions journalism lens to evaluate four types of policing reforms that have been attempted, with mixed results, to achieve more public safety, more community trust, and less police violence in Vallejo.\n\nSometimes you just want to listen, not read or watch. This Week in the Bay gives you an entertaining, quick recap of the most compelling stories from the last few days. Voices of the Bay brings you the backstories of ordinary people in the Bay. And our other special audio projects bring in-depth coverage of critical issues from Local News Matters to you."
