        "text": "THE PROCESS\n\nLaunch\n\nResilient by Design launched in May 2017 with an open call to engineers, architects, designers, artists, dreamers, community members and students to come together and create teams of experts willing to tackle the challenge of building resilience to climate change. Of the 51 teams entered, 9 of the selected local and global Design Teams completed the Bay Area Challenge.\n\nCollaborative Research Phase\n\n(Fall of 2017) the teams explored the Bay Area, looking closely at places nominated by the community as especially vulnerable to the threats of sea level rise, severe storms, flooding, and earthquakes. This also included studying the intricacies of the Bay Area, from the effects of gentrification and regional transportation challenges, to the unique cultural histories of local communities.\n\nCollaborative Design Phase\n\nIn January 2018, after each team presented 3-5 design opportunities, the RbD Research Advisory Committee assigned teams to specific locations. Over the next four months, the Design Teams developed their solutions for tackling sea level rise and creating resiliency, while working closely with community partners to ensure the concepts actually match community needs. This included collaborating with Y-PLAN, a youth engagement group that brings real life civic planning into the classroom, to draw student voices and youth perspectives into the design work.\n\nChallenge Summit\n\nFinally in May 2018, the Teams each revealed their innovative designs to an esteemed Jury who deliberated and made a case for how each design makes an important contribution, as part of a constellation of approaches.Each design concept was shared as part of a larger package of how communities can approach resiliency. The key considerations for assessing the strengths of the designs included:\n\nemphasis on multi-stakeholder, multi-benefit problem-solving strategies\n\ndemonstration of feasibility from a technological and engineering perspective\n\nrecognition of the need for a regional strategy\n\nfocus on equitable and measurable community engagement\n\nability to integrate ideas into existing sea level rise action plans. We’ve come a long way since the initial “Resilient by Design: Bay Area Challenge\", which concluded in 2018.\n\nFunders\n\nMany thanks to all the generous funders who supported this innovative design challenge: The Rockefeller Foundation, Bay Area Regional Collaborative, seedfund, Santa Clara Valley Water District, City and County of San Francisco, Metropolitan Transportation Commission, Marin Community Foundation, Resources Legacy Fund, and Coastal Conservancy.\n\nWHAT’S NEXT?\n\nThe work is not done. The nine design proposals serve as a catalyst for the community work moving forward and set the Bay Area on a path to a more resilient future. Many are committed to turning these ideas—invested in and created by communities—into real-world models and solutions for other cities to implement. Several of the Proposals have advanced from concepts to engineered designs with local partners.\n\nKEY PARTICIPANTS\n\nRbD Executive Board\n\nAllison Brooks, Bay Area Regional Collaborative\n\nTom Butt, City of Richmond\n\nAmy Chester, Rebuild by Design\n\nArian Covert, Bay Area Council\n\nAmy Hutzel, State Coastal Conservancy\n\nKiran Jain, Neighborly\n\nAshwini Kantak, City of San Jose\n\nDwayne Marsh, Government Alliance on Race & Equity\n\nJohn Rahaim, City & County of San Francisco\n\nLaura Tam, San Francisco Bay Area Planning and Urban Research Association\n\nFrancesca Vietor, The San Francisco Foundation\n\nRbD Staff\n\nAmanda Brown-Stevens\n\nHanah Goldov\n\nEmma Greenbaum\n\nTira Okamoto\n\nZoe Siegel\n\nMirisa Villarreal\n\nRbD Jurors\n\nLauren Alexander Augustine, National Academy of Sciences\n\nSarah Icioka, Desire Lines\n\nRoberto Moris, Research Centre for an Integrated Risk Management\n\nLiz Ogbu, Studio O\n\nHenk Ovink, International Water Affairs, Netherlands\n\nShelley Poticha, Natural Resources Defense Council\n\nDenise Reed, The Water institute of the Gulf\n\nJerry Schubel, Aquarium of the Pacific\n\nCynthia Smith, Smithsonian Design Museum\n\nHelle Soholt, Gehl Architects\n\nDavid Waggonner, Waggonner and Ball Architects\n\nResearch Advisory Committee\n\nRatna Amin,m SPUR\n\nKit Batten, PG&E\n\nJosh Bradt, San Francisco Estuary Partnership\n\nDana Brechwald, ABAG\n\nEllie Cohen, Point Blue Conservation Science\n\nTian Feng, BART\n\nJohn Gibbs, WRT\n\nLettitia Grenier, San Francisco Estuary Institute\n\nNahal Ghoghaie, Resilient Communities Initiative\n\nJesus Hernandez, Neighborhood Support Project-JCH Research\n\nJeffrey Koseff, Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment\n\nDavid Lewis, Save the Bay\n\nRoger Lin, Center on Race, Poverty, and the Environment\n\nLindy lowe, Port of San Francisco\n\nBruce Riodan, Climate Readiness Institute\n\nRupal Sangvi, HealthxDesign\n\nParin Shah, Asian Pacific Environmental Network\n\nCathy Simon, Perkins + Will\n\nMark Stacy, Civil and Environmental Engineering, UC Berkeley\n\nRick Thomasser, Bay Area Flood Protection Agencies Association\n\nElizabeth Wamper, Great Communities Collaborative\n\nCorinne Winter, Winter Consulting\n\nScience Advisory Team (from San Francisco Estuary Institute)\n\nRobin Grossinger\n\nScott Dusterhoff\n\nKatie McKnight\n\nJeremy Lowe\n\nErica Spotswood\n\nLettitia Grenier\n\nJulie Beagle\n\nApril Robinson\n\nFinance Advisory Team\n\nBrian Benn, Environmental Risk & Financial Solutions\n\nMichael Paparian, Environmental Finance Consultant\n\nShalini Vajjhala, re:focus partners\n\nKathy Schaefer, UC Davis Watershed Sciences Center\n\nRobert Spencer, Urban Economics\n\nMark Northcross, NHA Advisors"
