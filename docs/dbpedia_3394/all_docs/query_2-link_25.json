paired in the Third Round of the 1984/85 UEFA Cup.\n\nThe Spanish Real Madrid, managed by Amaro Amancio, boasted such Spanish stars like Camacho, Gallego, Santillana, as well as foreign stars such as West Germany’s Uli Stielieke, and new Argentine signing Jorge Valdano.\n\nMore importantly a new group of youngsters from the Castilla nursery soon to be known as ‘El Quinta del Buitre’ were now part of the first team.\n\nThese included Emilio Butragueno (‘El Buitre’), as well as Michel , Sanchis and Rafael Martin Vazquez.\n\nThey had qualified with some difficulty from their opening two Rounds. While SSW Innsbruck was eliminated with ease, the Yugoslavians of Rijeka had been a tougher test, and after losing (1-3) away, Madrid had overcome the deficit at home (3-0).\n\nThey were lagging behind in the League to Barcelona and in general were having one of their worst domestic seasons in nearly a decade.\n\nOn the other hand, The Belgians of Anderlecht, winners in 1983 and finalists the previous season of this competition were riding high domestically and in Europe.\n\nThey were still unbeaten in League play and were well on their way to reclaim their League crown last won in 1981.\n\nThe Manager was former star Paul van Himst, who would go on to manage the National team.\n\nThe team was spearheaded by led by skipper Frank Vercauteren and new 18-year-old star Enzo Scifo.\n\nThe Belgian contingent included Internationals such as Erwin vandenbergh, Rene vandereycken, Alex Czerniatinski and George Grun.\n\nThe foreigners on their books were Danish stars such as Morten Olsen and Frank Arnesen and Yugoslav defender Luka Peruzovic.\n\nThey had been impressive in the competition up to that point; having eliminated West Germany’s Werder Bremen and had hammered Italy’s Fiorentina (1-1 away and 6-2 at home).\n\nThe first leg, on November 28th, was played in Brussels’ Parc Astrid Stadium.\n\nAnderlecht were in more confident mood and Real Madrid played their usual poor away game.\n\nAnderlecht were missing the experienced midfielder Rene vandereycken, otherwise were in full strength.\n\nAmancio had deprived his team of the attacking talents of the experienced Juanito (suspended by Real Madrid themselves) as well as former Anderlecht star Juan Lozano.\n\nFrimann’s entry in the second half enabled Vercauteren to have more control of the match and within minutes the goals came.\n\nPhoto From: France Football, Issue 2017, December 4, 1984\n\n(Michel, Camacho and Alex Czerniatisnki)\n\nAfter constant pressure, Anderlecht finally scored in the 66th minute by vandenbergh and the floodgates were opened. Per Frimann after a one-two with Scifo at the center sent vandenbergh through and he beat Miguel Angel with a low shot.\n\nJust two minutes after a quick counter attack, the ball reached Vercauteren on the left side side touchline who sent in a cross in the goalmouth for Alex Czerniatisnki to head home.\n\nCzerniatinski was immediately booked for over celebration.\n\nPhoto From: France Football,

Estadio Santiago Bernabeu.\n\nReal Madrid started with former Anderlecht star Juan Lozano and Emilio Butragueno starting upfront, with San Jose replacing Chendo in defense.\n\nAnderlecht sacrificed one striker (vandenbergh) to bring in an extra midfielder (Per Frimann) and had only Czerniatisnki upfront and still missing Rene vandereycken.\n\nAnderlecht believed they had all but qualified and their overconfidence was their undoing as Real Madrid achieved one of its most European comebacks that it would become known for in the coming years.\n\nReal Madrid scored their six goals in the first 50 minutes as they attacked relentlessly and without mercy.\n\nEnzo Scifo admitted afterwards that they had it so easy in the League and in Europe from the beginning of the season that they believed they just needed to show up to qualify.\n\nAn anonymous Real Madrid player later said that the Spaniards had expected to meet a team that would defend every portion of the field instead they met a team that behaved like sheep.\n\nMorten Olsen later remarked that they should have marked Juan Lozano out of the game instead they allowed him total freedom.\n\nReal opened the scoring in the third minute when a free kick from the right by Lozano from the left was headed in by Sanchis.\n\nFor the second goal in the 16th minute, Emilio Butragueno headed in a cross from Valdano from the right side.\n\nFor the third goal in the 29th minute, Gallego sent Emilio Butragueno clear on the right side who immediately passed across for Valdano to stab home in an empty net.\n\nAnderlecht pulled a goal back in the 34th minute, when Frimann scored after a scramble in the goalmouth.\n\nFor Real’s fourth goal in the 39th minute was similar to their third goal, with Gallego sending Butragueno clear on the right and he crossed for Valdano to score.\n\nFor Real’s fifth in the 47th minute, Camacho crossed from the left that was pushed back by the Anderlecht defense into the path of Butragueno who scored.\n\nFor the final goal in the 50th minute, a cross from the left reached Butragueno who after a scramble scored.\n\nReal Madrid qualified and went on to win the UEFA Cup in May by defeating Hungary’s Videoton.\n\nAnderlecht did go on and win their League title.\n\nDecember 7, 1984\n\nReal Madrid Club de Fútbol (Spain) 6-Royal Sporting Club Anderlecht (Belgium) 1\n\nUEFA Cup- Third Round,

In his absence Germany manager Berti Vogts installed Borussia Dortmund’s Matthias Sammer as his new libero.\n\nSammer performed so well that Vogts decided to keep faith with the younger Sammer even after Matthaus was back from injury.\n\nFor a while this seemed to have excluded Matthaus from the National team permanently.\n\nHowever, Matthaus was recalled by 1998 after Sammer himself had to retire prematurely due to injury.\n\nPhoto From: World Soccer, October 1999\n\n(Lothar Matthaus)\n\nPhoto From: World Soccer, May 1997\n\n(Matthias Sammer)\n\n3- Event:\n\nBrazil’s loss vs. Uruguay in the Final of the 1950 World Cup at Maracana on July 16, 1950.\n\nConsequence:\n\nBrazil’s goalkeeper Moacir Barbosa was forever established as the scapegoat and lived a virtually ostracized life in poverty.\n\nHe passed away on April 7, 2000.\n\nIn an interview he remarked that under Brazilian Law the maximum imprisonment penalty is 30 years but he has been paying for nearly 50 years for his mistake.\n\nPhoto From: L'Equipe Magazine, April 25, 1998\n\n(Moacir Barbosa)\n\nPhoto From: L'Equipe Magazine, April 25, 1998\n\n(Ghiggia’s winning goal, July 16, 1950, World Cup, Brazil 1-Uruguay 2)\n\nPhoto From: O Brasil Na Copa America, Author Airton Silveira Fontenele, 1989\n\n(Moacir Barbosa)\n\n4- Event:\n\nFive Scotland players led by skipper Billy Bremner breaking a 1 AM Curfew and being thrown out of a Copenhagen nightclub for drunken behavior, following Scotland’s victory (1 to 0) vs. Denmark on September 3, 1975 in a European Championship Qualifying match.\n\nConsequence:\n\nThe five players in question were Bremner along with Willie Young, Joe Harper, Pat McCluskey and Arthur Graham.\n\nA Scottish official witnessed a drunken Bremner and McCluskey trying to turn a bed upside down as a prank.\n\nAs a punishment all five players received life suspensions, though it was later overturned in the following years.\n\nIn any case this ended Billy Bremner ‘s international career.\n\nPhoto From: Scotland, The Team, 1987\n\n(Billy Bremner)\n\n5- Event:\n\nFrance’s European Championship qualifier at Bucharest vs. Romania on October 11, 1995.\n\nConsequence:\n\nThis match was later described by experts/observers/players/etc as the pivotal turning point in the birth of the golden age of the French national team of late 90’s and early 2000’s.\n\nThe French refer to this match as the birth of the ‘Zidane Genration’.\n\nFrance, under Aime Jacquet, had to win to have any chance to qualify for the 1996 Euros in England and an away match vs. group leaders Romania seemed a daunting task.\n\nFrance won this match 3 to 1 and this paved the way to qualification.\n\nZidane scored one of the goals, along with partner Youri Djorkaeff, and established himself as the playmaker of this generation.\n\nThe backbone of the future France squad was established with players such as Karembeu, Lizarazu, Dugarry, Djorkaeff and veterans such as Didier Deschamps and Marcel Desailly.\n\nGoalkeeper Fabien Barthez even took part in this match, deputizing for the unavailable starter Bernard Lama.\n\nPhoto From: Onze-Mondial, Issue 82, November 1995\n\n(Youri Djorkaeff scoring France’s second, October 11, 1995, EC Qualifier, Romania 1-France 3)\n\nPhoto From: Onze-Mondial, Issue 82, November 1995\n\n(Zinedine Zidane, October 11, 1995, EC Qualifier, Romania 1-France 3)\n\n↧\n\nMagazine Awards, Part Six\n\nFrance Football’s Ballon d’Or:\n\nYear 1977:\n\nPlayer of the year: Allan Simonsen (Denmark and Borussia Moenchengladbach)\n\nPhoto From: France Football, Issue 1655, December 27, 1977\n\n(Allan Simonsen)\n\nOnze’s Onze d’Or:\n\nYear 1982:\n\nPlayer of the year: Paolo Rossi (Juventus and Italy)\n\nPhoto From: Onze, Issue 84, December 1982\n\n(Paolo Rossi)\n\nWorld Soccer’s Player of the Year:\n\nYear 1987:\n\nPlayer of the year: Ruud Gullit (AC Milan and Holland)\n\nManager of the Year: Johann Cruyff (Ajax Amsterdam)\n\nTeam of the year: Porto\n\nPhoto From: World Soccer, December 1987\n\nWorld Soccer Player of the Year\n\nFrance Football’s African Ballon d’Or:\n\nYear 1981:\n\nPlayer of the year: Lakhdar Belloumi (GC Mascara and Algeria)\n\nPhoto From: France Football, Issue 1865, January 5, 1982\n\n(Lakhdar Belloumi)\n\nFrance Football’s African Ballon d’Or\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nShort International Careers, Part Five\n\n1- Stefano Borgonovo\n\nItalian Stefano Borgonovo’s best season was during the 1988/89 where he was on loan at Fiorentina from AC Milan.
