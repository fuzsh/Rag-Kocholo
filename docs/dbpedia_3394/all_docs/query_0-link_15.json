This anniversary sparked conversations about the historical significance of the Lei Ãurea, and provoked new criticisms about how far Brazil had come in its treatment of Black people since that historical decree. It was in light of this renewed interest in the Lei Ãurea that actor/filmmaker/activist ZÃ³zimo Bulbul debuted AboliÃ§Ã£o (Abolition), his first and only feature film as a director and the product of more than ten years of thorough research. Bulbul intended to use this anniversary as an opportunity to critically reflect on the conditions of Black Brazilians after the emancipation and to demonstrate that the abolition in fact had been a farcical scam. Notwithstanding that there were other films1 produced at that time which covered the Lei Ãurea and racism in Brazil, Bulbulâs film explored these topics in a particularly unique way - it was the first Brazilian film shot by a nearly all-Black crew to portray the reflections of Black Brazilians on their own post-abolition condition.\n\nOne of the major aspects which made Bulbulâs filmmaking process stand-out from the other works that explored the conditions of Black people in Brazil is the breadth of locations which the film covers. The crew of Abolition traveled with their camera through sites and cities that remain crucial to the development of Afro-Brazilian culture. These included Bahia and Pernambuco (Northeast), Manaus (North), Rio Grande do Sul (Deep South), and SÃ£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro (Southeast). Another of Abolitionâs achievements is the way that Bulbul managed to shed light on a diverse array of situations in which Black people were living. For example, the crew captured interviews with key icons from the Afro-Brazilian community, such as Abdias do Nascimento, LÃ©lia Gonzalez, Carlos Medeiros, Beatriz Nascimento, Grande Otelo, Joel Rufino dos Santos and Benedita da Silva. In the film, these interviews are occasionally shown on-screen sharing perspectives informed by their own Blackness, but in other moments, voices from the interviews materialize as the camera shifts its attention to Black bodies that are, despite being part of our social urban fabric, perpetually rendered invisible throughout our history: workers, the homeless population, the impoverished living in the slums, the street artists and so on.\n\nWhy Abolition?\n\nIâve been involved with the work of recuperating Abolitionâs historical materials on a daily basis since I began the graduate studies program in Communications at Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro two years ago, and I recently concluded the program with a masterâs dissertation on the film. As I began conducting research for my dissertation, I encountered a scarcity of information on Bulbulâs lone feature film. There are only a few academic works that cover the cineasteâs lifeâall of which barely discuss Abolitionâand I had not come across any work that provides it with a thorough analysis. This makes clear that despite receiving awards at Brazilian film festivals, as well as overseas,2 the documentary went on to make only a minor impact on the world of film academia. Noel dos Santos Carvalho, a film teacher and researcher from Universidade de Campinas (UNICAMP), attests to how the film was met with indifference: âWith its 150 minute duration, Abolition did not find approval with the audience. Not even among Black people. The conversation around it was limited to a small circle of intellectuals and Black activistsâ.3 Carvalhoâs testimony poses several questions: Why was Abolition seen by so few people? Why was its impact so minimal? What is the filmâs legacy among todayâs Black researchers?\n\nAside from investigating these questions, this article will bring together some of the memories and recollections from the Abolition film crew that I gathered while interviewing them for my masterâs thesis. These memories and recollections are vital towards gaining an updated understanding of the film today, as it is important to appreciate that Abolition was the universal effort of many forces of Black creativity. In the eyes of researcher Heitor Augusto (2018), investigating the creation of Abolition allows us to comprehend the nuances of a film that was conceived and executed by Black creators during a moment when new ideas, projects, and perspectives, both in Black Brazilian cinema and intellectual thought at large were emerging. The core crew members of Abolition were/are trailblazers in that they executed roles that were unprecedented for Black professionals. However, perhaps even more importantly, they reclaimed the legitimacy of their enunciative position and their right to tell their own stories. From behind the camera (or even because of it) this crew contributed to the theorization and structuring of Black cinema, a field that was practically nonexistent in Brazil at that time.\n\nIn conversation with the film crew\n\nOn January 28, 2020, on a hot Rio de Janeiro afternoon, I first encountered Vantoen Pereira Jr. Pereira Jr. played a decisive role as a facilitator on Abolitionâs production, and he still works to promote the film and fights to preserve its memories. In my conversation with Pereira Jr., he started off by bringing me back to the origin of Abolition, towards the earliest days when Bulbul first began developing the project.\n\nAccording to Pereira Jr., Abolition began to take shape around 1977 on an immersive trip that he and Bulbul took to BÃºzios, a city located in Rio de Janeiroâs lake areas. He recounts that Bulbul, who had just returned from a self-imposed exile4, rented a house at Rasa beach and immediately began writing. Bulbul set out to incorporate some of the social, historical, and aesthetic investigations to be found within his previous films Alma no Olho (Soul in the Eye, 1973) and Dia de Alforria (Emancipation Day, 1981). In addition, Bulbul had gathered new ideas and information throughout his journey through Africa, Europe and the United States, and he was eager to incorporate this into a new project. While working in BÃºzios, Bulbul used a typewriter to register his memories and recollections from this journey.\n\nThen, in 1986, after nearly a decade of research during which he was working towards a final draft of the screenplay, Bulbul put together the crew that would bring Abolition to life. From the very beginning, Bulbul expressed his predilection for having an all-Black crew since he believed that only professionals from the Black community would be able to bring the specific perspectives needed to make the film. However, though the race criteria was important to Bulbul, it was not the determining factor as to who would get hired to work on Abolition. While I will touch on this point further on, I find it imperative to now introduce eight crew members from Aboliton and explain the important role they played in its production. But before delving into these testimonies, I must stress the importance of analyzing Abolition through the point of view of the professionals whose jobs arenât typically perceived with the same level of prestige enjoyed by screenwriters and directors (both roles personified by Bulbul in the case of Abolition). The conception and the construction of a work of cinema such as Abolition is necessarily based on the input of a collective, and by bringing to light the voices and experiences of the crew members on this predominantly Black film set, we are able to delve deeper into the film, following the tracks left by their accounts and collective memories. We can then begin to comprehend how the need for collectivity, or âaquilombamentoâ5 stems from the desire to forge a space where people can show each other affection, actively listen to one another, forge new connections, and discover identities.\n\nDeusa Dineris\n\nThe first crew member that I would like to highlight was the only Black woman to be a part of the making of Abolition, Deusa Dineris. Dineris was one of the filmâs most important contributors and she was invited to join the project in 1986, right before shooting started. At the time, she had been working as an advertising executive for the advertising company Momento Filmes.6 During the filmâs funding stage, the producers identified the need to create a co-production in order to compete for a grant from Embrafilme, and therefore Momento Filmes acted as the co-producer. Through this co-production, Dineris got involved with the film; but she explains that her involvement only happened by chance, since she wasnât working in cinema at that time.\n\nDineris and Bulbulâs first encounter took place at Momentoâs headquarters. She knew very little about Abolition, only that the crew was made of eleven men and one Black woman, Anya Sartor, who was expected to work as the continuity supervisor despite having a previous career in acting. Just before shooting began, Sartor had to withdraw from the project for personal reasons. This left a major gap within the production crew, and there was now the challenge to find another Black woman who could fill in for Sartor. Bulbul believed it was necessary to have a racialized feminine perspective as part of the crew and to the surprise of Dineris, Bulbul and owner of Momento Filmes (JerÃ´nimo CÃ©sar) decided to invite her to fill the position vacated by Sartos. Although Dineris initially showed reluctance in accepting this offer due to her lack of experience in the film industry, in the end, Bulbul managed to convince her to work on the film.\n\nDineris on the the set\n\nâ\n\nImage From the collection of Deusa Dineris\n\nIn our interview, Dineris recollected that being the only Black woman on the crew was not a challenge for her, as she had three prior experiences working for publicity agencies where there were no other racialized women on staff. However, the real challenge for her was accepting a job that she had no previous experience in. By working on the documentary, she likely became the first Black woman to serve as a continuity supervisor on a Brazilian film. The fact that it took so long for a female to fill this role may come as a shock to many. But it is important to keep in mind that it was only in 1984 â 4 years before Abolition â that the first feature length film directed by a Black Brazilian woman hit the theaters. This was AdÃ©lia Sampaioâs Amor Maldito.\n\nIn a film industry dominated by white men, the presence of Dineris was of fundamental importance to Abolition. Throughout the interviews I conducted with the filmâs eight crew members, each emphasized that the presence of Dineris on the predominantly male film set allowed the film to be less oriented towards the male-gaze. However, during the production of Abolition, there remained the all too common gender-oriented working dynamic that privileged men. Dineris recounts that because the crew was so small, she accumulated new tasks beyond her initial role as the continuity supervisor, becoming actively engaged as assistant director and producer. âWhile the crew would go to the bar after the shooting, Iâd stay indoors working and getting everything ready for the next morningâ, she recalls. Such unbalanced divisions of labor reveal that there was still gender stereotyping throughout the making of Abolition.\n\nâ\n\nDespite these obstacles, Dineris reveals that being part of the film had a direct influence on the growth of her own budding racial identity. It is no coincidence that, after working on the documentary, Dineris decided to quit the advertising business and become engaged with the Black struggle, eventually launching an event-production company7Â solely dedicated to promoting Black artists.\n\nDeusa Dineris during the shooting of Abolition at the Pelourinho square in Salvador, Bahia\n\nImage From the collection of Deusa Dineris\n\nDineris has preserved both her personal memories and memorabilia from the period of making Abolition. On the day of our interview, she brought pictures, a book autographed to her by the journalist Edmar Morel (who is featured in the film), and a publicity folder produced for the release of the movie. She passed that folder onto me as a gift, remarking on the importance of sharing it with future generations in order to show the ways in which Brazilian films were advertised during the pre-Internet era.\n\nMy conversation with Dineris and the act of investigating her role in the film was one of the most thought-provoking parts of my research, and her narrative is crucial towards understanding what working dynamics were like on the film set of Abolition. A Black cinema â that is, a cinema made by Black creators â must be mindful of intersectionality. In its efforts toward building a nearly all-Black crew, Abolition contributed to larger efforts of inserting Black professionals in the film industry, all the while reproducing gender stereotypes and sexist microaggressions in its division of labor.\n\nVantoen Pereira Jr.\n\nââ\n\nVantoen Pereira Jr. and ZÃ³zimo Bulbull\n\nComing from a career in photography, Vantoen Pereira Jr. joined the crew of Abolition with former experiences in the arts. But it was through Bulbul, who was like an uncle and godfather, that he first began to learn about cinema. Since Bulbul never had children, he and Pereira Jr. were able to forge something like a father-son relationship. I would like to stress that this close relationship, as well as Pereira Jr.âs previous experience as a still photographer for well-regarded directors such as Nelson Pereira dos Santos, JosÃ© Medeiros and Roberto Farias, helped create a familial atmosphere on the set of Abolition.\n\nThe official role that Periera Jr. had on Abolition was assistant cinematographer alongside DP Miguel Rio Branco, but his involvement in making the film went beyond thatâhe witnessed and contributed to early research in BÃºzios, and he read over Bulbulâs initial screenplay drafts. Bulbul also had a profound influence on Periera Jr., as he was able to develop his photographerâs eye while working on the set of Abolition. Bulbul changed my \"understandings around image-making, visual poetics and working practicesâ, Pereira Jr. said. During our conversation, Pereira Jr. walked me through each step of Abolitionâs filmmaking process. He made sure to reiterate that Abolition is a very meaningful film, and insisted that we can glean much more from it than what was initially grasped during the time of its release.According to him, it was a film for the future, to be explored by generations to come.\n\nPereira Jr. is not merely a source for valuable archival material related to the film (as he has preserved photographs and documents from the film sets), but he also serves as a precious carrier of memories related to Abolitionâs production previously known only to him. Of these memories, Pereira Jr. recollects that Bulbul often stressed the âimportance of familyâ throughout the filmmaking process; according to him, Bulbul emphasized this idea because he believed that it was an important force in providing a reconnection and reconstruction for Black families who were torn apart as a result of centuries of slavery. Pereira Jr. also discussed how community building and the power of encounter were key ideas that influenced Bulbul throughout his career, even claiming that one of Bulbulâs intentions with Abolition was to explain why thousands of Black families were separated and decimated since the Lei Ãurea.\n\nPereira Jr. was instrumental to both Abolition and to my research. In our conversations he shared fresh information and diligently helped me contact the rest of the crew. As I look back at those moments when I held my interview with seven of the crew members, sharing the same space for the first time in years, I realize how important it was to have them all together in a friendly environment.\n\nSeverino DadÃ¡\n\nSeverino DadÃ¡ worked as the editor for Bulbulâs second film, the documentary Aniceto do ImpÃ©rio em dia de Alforria? (1981). In our conversation, DadÃ¡ recalled that he was first to be formally invited by Bulbulâwith whom he had been friends since the 1970sâto work on Abolition. The two shared thoughts throughout the entire pre-production process, from providing input on the screenplay to helping Bulbul choose the interviewees. Every member of the crew who worked on Abolition is reverent towards DadÃ¡, who is famous for his encyclopedic knowledge, and recognized for his fundamental contributions to Brazilian cinema. DadÃ¡ is one of the most active film editors within the history of Brazilian Cinema, his credits amounting to more than 300 films. His fondness for Bulbul was visible when he spoke about Abolition, as he emotionally recalled the intimate friendship which he had with the filmmaker that contributed to this crucial chapter in Brazilian cinema history.\n\nBefore working on Abolition, DadÃ¡ had already enjoyed a prolific career as an editor, having worked with prominent Brazilian directors such as NelsonPereira dos Santos and RogÃ©rio Sganzerla. A native of Pedra, a small city located in the backcountry of Pernambuco state in the Northeastern Coast of Brazil, DadÃ¡ began his career as a radio announcer. However, he soon migrated to cinema once he joined the independent film club circuit. His life-trajectory soon intersected with Brazilâs immediate political history as he was incarcerated and tortured by the military during Brazilâs military dictatorship8. Both DadÃ¡âs background as a native of Pernambuco and his political activism were vital to the ways in which he contributed to Abolition. Also, as one of the few white crew members, his political convictions and perspectives as a nordestino9 offered a fresh perspective to the film.\n\nOne of the many stories DadÃ¡ told me recounts the day that Bulbul was informed of Embrafilmeâs decision to fund Abolition. The director invited the editor to SÃ£o JoÃ£o Batista Cemetery in Botafogo on the South Side of Rio de Janeiro, in order to deliver an ebÃ³, which is a type of offering that is part of the tradition of various Afro-Brazilian religions. The ebÃ³ was being delivered by Bulbul to express his thankfulness for receiving the awarded grant that would make the production of the film possible. As they entered the cemetery, a police car that was circling in the vicinity approached them. One of the officers stepped out the vehicle, and he recognized both DadÃ¡ and Bulbul. That officer was Paulo Copacabana, who had worked as an actor in some films, including Roberto Fariasâs O Assalto ao Trem Pagador (Assault on the Pay Train, 1962) and J.B. Tankoâs Bom Mesmo Ã© Carnaval (Carnival is Truly Good, 1962). As he questioned them for their reasons of being in front of the cemetery late at night, DadÃ¡ and Bulbul explained they were about to execute a thanking ritual. Copacabana then proceeded to put them both inside the police vehicle and drove them to a nearby bar in order to celebrate the film grant; they all sat togetherâDadÃ¡, Bulbul, Copacabana and another cop, who eventually paid the bill.\n\nAnother less humorous anecdote recounted by DadÃ¡ involved PelÃ©, elected in 1980 as the Athlete of the Century by the French paper LâEquipe. As an international superstar and the Black symbol of soccer at the time, PelÃ© was invited to be interviewed and share his thoughts on racism in sports. PelÃ© declined the invitation, explaining that he believed racism did not exist in Brazil. Disappointed with his stance, Bulbul and DadÃ¡ were forced to look for another figure to be interviewed in the film, someone who had a more critical perspective on racial issues in sports, especially in soccer. They ultimately invited Paulo CÃ©zar Caju, who was known throughout his career as a lone critical voice of racism in soccer. Caju promptly accepted being interviewed for the documentary, where he devoted harsh criticisms towards PelÃ© due to his lack of engagement in the Black struggle. The response to this was immediate: PelÃ©âs lawyer contacted Bulbul to communicate the athlete's wishes to have the interview removed from the film, as it tarnished his image. Despite such extreme pressure, Cajuâs opinions remained in the final cut.\n\nThis situation illuminates the difficulties one faces when trying to begin a conversation about racism in Brazil. What Bulbul encountered with PelÃ© is a common situation in Brazil: eitherBlack figures refuse to acknowledge structural racism or they give the packaged, standardized answer that, despite the existence of prejudice in society, they themselves were never the target of it. Iâm left to wonder how painful it must have been forBulbul to hear from Brazilâs most important athlete that racism is a fiction by which he was never hurt. The episode serves as a clear testament to the obstacles that the film had to overcome in providing a more truthful representation of Black life in Brazil.\n\nAlexandre Tadeu, Edson Alves, and Biza Vianna\n\nâ\n\nAlexandre Tadeu, a film electrician, met Vantoen Pereira Jr. when they worked together on Roberto Fariasâs Pra Frente Brasil (1982) and they quickly became friends. Soon thereafter, Tadeu met and became friends with Bulbul, as they both frequently attended the bars and night life of Lapa, a historic neighborhood in downtown Rio de Janeiro. Their favorite place to meet became âTangarÃ¡â, a tavern where they would exchange new ideas about cinema. Tadeu recalls that they never directly talked about Abolition during those encounters and that he only became familiar with the project when editor Severino DadÃ¡ took Bulbul to the offices of Memento Filmes. As a staff member of Memento Filmes, Tadeu naturally became involved with the production of Abolition, offering the crew support with company rental equipment. Tadeu also remembers that during post-production, he would accompany DadÃ¡ and Bulbul in the cutting room, and after a long shift of work they would head to SÃ£o Salvador square, in Laranjeiras, to discuss all of the editing choices of the day.\n\nEdson Alves, aka âEdinhoâ, was a professional lighting technician and electrician who had a brief stint working on the set of Abolition for ten days. His work can be prominently seen in the fictional sequences in early half of the film.10 However, despite the fact that Ediho only worked on the set for a short period, his presence was very important to Deusa Dineris, who recounted in our interview that she learned many of the ins and outs of a film set from Edinho. I would like to emphasize this relationship between Edson and Dineris it reflects the importance of aquilombamento on the making of Abolition. It was made evident throughout the interviews I conducted that the sense of shared identity and communion that Abolitionâs production offered the crew was a respite from the previous experiences that they had in white-dominated working environments which precluded this form of collectivity.\n\nBulbulâs widow, Biza Vianna, shared with me that the couple were forced to break the agreement they had made to never work together, especially on film shoots. She joined the project at the last minute because it urgently needed a costume designer for the aforementioned fictional sequence in which Princess Isabel reads the proclamation of emancipation. Vianna had a career working in fashion and theater, so she joined the crew and was responsible for both the costume of the fictional characters and the clothing of the crew members who would eventually be shown on-screen in key sequences. Vianna used Zapatistas Army of National Liberation as an inspiration for dressing the crew as a way to suggest an image of a Latin-American resistance. She considers her role on the film to have been small, but other members of the team such as Pereira Jr. and FlÃ¡vio Leandro think otherwise, stressing the importance of Vianna as both a professional and Bulbulâs partner, whose legacy she oversees today.\n\nAlexandre Tadeu, Fernando Spencer, Severino DadÃ¡ e ZÃ³zimo Bulbul, during the film editing\n\nMiguel Rio Branco\n\nâ\n\nLastly, it is paramount to explore the role of cinematographer Miguel Rio Branco, the only white man on the Abolition shooting crew. Prior to joining the production, his work as a photographer had shown a predilection for popular culture, as can be seen in the series Maciel (1979). Maciel documents the precarious conditions in the oldest areas of Pelourinho, a historic neighborhood in Salvador, Bahia. Years later, Rio Branco directed Nada levarei quando morrer, Aqueles que mim deve cobrarei no inferno (1985), a key short film in his career.11 By the time he worked on Bulbulâs documentary he already was a nationally and internationally acclaimed artist, especially praised for his photography. In August of 2019 I travelled to Araras, a city on the mountains of Rio de Janeiro, to interview Rio Branco and record his memories from working on Abolition. Rio Branco did not maintain close contact with Bulbul and the rest of the crew after shooting completed, and therefore his thoughts on the final version of the film are enigmatic. According to Biza Vianna, Rio Branco distanced himself from the documentary upon its completion, ânever [making] any effort to learn about the filmâ.\n\nAlthough Bulbul had wanted to assemble an all-Black crew, he faced challenges when it came to choosing a DP, since, according to DadÃ¡ and Flavio Leandro, there were very few Black cinematographers in Brazil. Bulbul believed that Rio Brancoâs vast oeuvre12 of photographing Black bodies would provide him with the necessary experience to shoot Abolition. When I brought this up to Rio Branco during our conversation, he disagreed that this was the reason that had led Bulbul to choose him as DP. According to him, âAs long as you have the ability to gaze and possess technical knowledge, you can photograph any type of body, black or whiteâ. I believe that this statement deserves further scrutiny.\n\nRio Brancoâs understanding is opposite to that of EustÃ¡quio Neves, another well-regarded Brazilian photographer who has discussed his struggles during the 1980s to find the right camera equipment appropriate for capturing different shades of dark skin. Neves became known for having developed alternative and multidisciplinary techniques to manipulate film negatives and positives to suit this purpose. According to Neves:\n\nLighting standards werenât developed having darker skins in mind, but rather to the Caucasiansâ. It used to be very difficult to photograph a Black woman in a white wedding dress. One ended up having to lighten the skin instead of portraying the color as it was originally. I used to believe that I didnât know how to photograph, until I realized the issue wasnât me, but the standards.13\n\nâNevesâs statement reveals that it wasnât just a matter of having a pure ability to take good photographs, since properly photographing Black bodies involved overcoming different technological factors and social norms that were created by the photographic industry and which went unchallenged for many years. As Abolition would be a film that mostly rendered Black bodies, the aesthetic choices behind the filmâs cinematography was a matter taken into serious consideration by Bulbul. Not only was Bulbul forced to reckon with the technical limitations of producing an authentic image of Black bodies, but he also had to consider the cinematographerâs subjective gaze. It was therefore necessary to count on a DP who could be sensitive to these issues. Despite his declared indifference to the systemic prejudices of technical cinematography at the time, Rio Brancoâs success with Maciel led Bulbul to believe that the photographer could deliver an image similar to what he had in mind. Despite the disparate choice, the partnership between Bulbul and Rio Branco yielded beautiful results, as the film went on to win the Best Cinematography award at the Festival de BrasÃ­lia. Rio Branco revealed that he was surprised to receive this award, since he believed that the filmâs strengths were its research and screenplay, particularly the unprecedented coverage of the emancipation of slavery by Black creators.\n\nThere was also a disagreement between Bulbul and Rio Branco over Bulbulâs decision to pre-conceive the form in which the film would take, as this implied that there would be very little room for debate and experimentation in the film's mode of visuality. Of course, this âpreconceived formâ was in fact a reflection of Bulbulâs clarity of vision for Abolition. The film was the very definition of a passion project for Bulbul, who therefore knew how he wanted the film to look and what form of construction it should take. For a white cinematographer such as Rio Branco who was used to having greater autonomy in the decision-making process on the set of a film, being relegated to the role of an observer felt like a disappointment. The friction between Rio Branco and Bulbul, of which remnants can still be felt today, reveals the social hierarchy of race within working relationships, and how it was and still is difficult for white people to take directions from Black professionals.\n\nIn fact, as a white man, Rio Branco was amazed that he was even invited to work on Abolition.14 During our conversation he expressed that: âIn the United States they would never cast me as the DP of a film like this, and my presence in it shows that we Brazilians enjoy the possibility of a bigger interracial relationship than other countriesâ. However, when we look at the history of racial disparities within the Brazilian film industry, they reveal that Brazilian cinema has always been a predominantly white industry. A thorough examination of the Brazilian film industry sponsored in 2017 by GEMAA (Study Group for Affirmative Action)15 revealed a severely segregated landscape throughout the history of Brazilian cinema. GEMAAâs study looked at the highest grossing Brazilian films between 1970 and 2016. Their findings revealed that gender and racial inequality have always been the norm within the Brazilian film industry. The study claims:\n\nBetween 1970 and 2016, the highest grossing films (works seen by more than 500 thousand people) were predominantly directed by white men (98%). We couldnât identify a single director who was a person of color, though we must state that 13% of the titles couldnât be analyzed due to lack of data. When it comes to gender, we noticed a very low number of women working as directors: only 2%. And none of them were Black.16\n\nWhen analyzing the screenwriters of those titles, âonly 8% were women and the only Black woman we could identify in the sample was JulcilÃ©a Telles, who was the co-writer of the sex comedy A Gostosa da Gafieiraâ.17 Despite the fact that GEMAAâs study only took into consideration feature-length fiction films, I believe the landscape wouldnât be much different had other modes or formats of filmmaking been considered.\n\nThere is one final element related to Bulbul hiring Rio Branco that is important to note. In my conversations with the film crew, they revealed that Bulbul saw this hiring as a strategic decision: by inviting in a member of the Brazilian elite,18 Bulbul was inverting the common social hierarchy in which white men had all of the decision-making power on a film set. When we consider the hiring from this perspective, we see the irony in Bulbulâs choice. Itâs surely no accident that Rio Branco is the only crew member that is never featured on-screen throughout the film. This indicates that the self-reflexivity of Abolition was not intended to include the position of its own DP.\n\nIn concluding my analyses of the roles that each crew member had on Abolition, I would like to highlight one last component related to the personal dynamics of the crew. Throughout the interviews I conducted, each crew member mentioned the importance of âtavern talkâ, an expression of Bulbulâs that was meant to be applied and understood as an ethical value. Cultivating a bohemian lifestyle was seen by Bulbul as an important ritual that one must always engage in, and even include it within work processes. Upon listening to the crewâs memories of working on the film, I soon realized that many decisions that went into the construction of the film were made during encounters at bars and taverns. It is worth noting here that the word âbohemiaâ, beyond its connotations of pleasure and entertainment, also connotes a social-cultural practice that takes into account lived experiences from different subjectivities. There are political implications to be gleaned when considering that a nearly all-Black crew was circulating and, to a certain extent, occupying areas of Rio de Janeiro, a city that still to this day disguises its hostility towards Black bodies. Congregating within these spaces and sharing discussions among one another certainly played a significant role in the filmâs construction and in the way that the crew bonded throughout the filmmaking process.\n\nThe Commercial Distribution and Further Legacy of Abolition\n\nAbolition was finished in 1988 after extensive periods of research, production, and post-production. Bulbulâs expectations for the film were high, as he had just completed a work of unprecedented depth that was to be released in the same year that marked the centennial of the Lei Ãurea, one of the most important moments for Brazilian Black activism in the 20th century. This was a period of intense conversations and debates around many topics involving racial issues, and the representation of Black people in film and television was among the most discussed. Bulbulâs goal was to make a major contribution to that conversation.\n\nEveryone involved with the film hoped Abolition would spark a meaningful and broad conversation around these issues, and they all hoped that the film would be released in the commercial circuit and screened at various film festivals. One of the reasons that the crew hoped the film would achieve this success is summarized by researcher Noel dos Santos Carvalho, as he claims the documentary âobjectively manifests the political stances taken by Black activism since the 1970sâ.19 Bulbul believed Abolition would also serve as a counternarrative to other contemporary productions around the centennial celebration of the emancipation. Bulbul made sure to detach himself from any production that he believed posed an opposition to his political values, which, according to Carvalho, led him to refuse taking part in a special production by Rede Globo, Brazilâs biggest communications conglomerate, that would celebrate the anniversary. He claimed, âThere were artists and Black activists who pressed me to be there. But I donât work for free for [Globoâs founder] Roberto Marinho. And besides, I found their show a demagogic pieceâ.20\n\nBulbul was completely engaged in securing a commercial run for his film, and his widow Biza Vianna recalls how releasing the documentary became one of the biggest frustrations of his life. Abolition did not resonate with the public nearly to the extent he had hoped for. When I asked the crew and Vianna about why the film was received so poorly, they all referred to a boycott coming from certain players and intelligentsia within Brazilâs film circles, and within Embrafilme, the state-owned company responsible for distributing the documentary.\n\nÂ Â Â Â\n\nThe topic of Brazilian commercial film distribution was analyzed by researcher PatrÃ­cia Selonk, who highlighted the role played by Embrafilme as the main sponsor of our films since the companyâs conception in 1969 until its implosion in 1990. According to Selonk, Embrafilme provided a certain level of infrastructure and helped forge a new public interest in Brazilian cinema despite the fact that the market was dominated by foreign studios. However, Embrafilmeâs practices were also met with criticism from filmmakers who made the accusation that they prioritized certain films while delaying the commercial release of others:\n\nJÃºlio Bressane and RogÃ©rio Sganzerla were critical of Embrafilme for its close ties with specific producers, such as Luis Carlos Barreto. The companyâs chief of distribution, Marco AurÃ©lio Marcondes, would justify his practices on the basis that these filmmakersâ works were underground, therefore wouldnât be the recipient of a major financial injection by any distributor.21\n\nAlthough the fundamental role of Embrafilme was to sponsor new works of Brazilian cinema, they often made insufficient efforts to distribute the films that they had funded to make. When analyzing Abolitionâs commercial run â or lack thereof â the mindset of those at the head of Embrafilme becomes evident. The crew members Iâve interviewed assert that the documentary was never officially released, and its distribution was limited to screenings at film festivals in 1988, among which were the Festival de BrasÃ­lia and the Cine Rio Festival.22 During the latter festival, Vianna recollects that the film was not programmed as part of the main section, in which films were projected within an actual film theater. On the contrary, Abolition was only programmed in a sidebar of outdoor screenings. Similarly, the first showing of Abolition was at an outdoor screening in Bulbulâs hometown, the affluent neighborhood of Ipanema. The screening took place at Nossa Senhora da Paz square and was packed with many viewers and guests. One of them, according to Vantoen Pereira Jr., was a young Spike Lee, who was in Brazil promoting his second feature, Sheâs Gotta Have It.\n\nEdinho Alves and Alexandre Tadeu explain that the film crew ended up taking the task of distributing the documentary into their own hands. They improvised a communications strategy, which included spreading posters around the city and booking screenings outside of Rio de Janeiro. Regardless of their initial success in attracting a large crowd to the filmâs premiere, Abolition would go on to barely make an impact on the national film market, never enjoying an official commercial run.\n\nBeyond Embrafilmeâs active disengagement from helping to distribute Abolition, another factor that contributed to the filmâs poor reception is its duration. The current cut of Abolition is two hours and thirty minutes long, and according to FlÃ¡vio Leandro, this negatively influenced the audienceâs ability to embrace the work. The length of the film proved to become a point of contention between Bulbul and his crew. The first cut was over four hours long, and it required a strenuous effort on the part of the film crew to convince him to acquiesce to a shorter version.\n\nTherefore, without adequate institutional support or the financial means to distribute Abolition independently, the documentary was only shown overseas years after its completion:\n\nAbolition was awarded at Festival de BrasÃ­lia â88 and it also won something in Cuba and while I was at a film festival there, I was invited to show the film in New York. I was also awarded there, but in my country not even a line was written on the papers on the film and on the awards. I came back to Brazil profoundly sad with the international recognition the film enjoyed, while here nothing happened, neither with the film, nor with me. I expected to be known, to show the film, I wanted to be out there talking about it, discussing both Brazilian film history and the topics touched by my documentary, but in the end it felt like âshut up, nigger, thereâs no racism in Brazil! Youâre making these things up!â That brought a great deal of frustration.22\n\nThe lack of acknowledgement and financial support for Black filmmakers, even those with proven abilities such as Bulbul, caused the cineaste to take a long hiatus as a director. Only in 2001, when he received a grant from Rio de Janeiroâs state production fund dedicated to short films, did he produce and direct another film, the documentary Pequena Ãfrica (2001).23 In the same year he also finished Samba no trem (2001).24 Despite not working as a director between 1988 and the early 2000s, Bulbulâs life was filled with remarkable experiences. He would go on to cement his important legacy with the creation of the Centro Afro-Carioca de Cinema (Afro-Carioca Center for Cinema). The frustrations that Bulbul experienced throughout the release of Abolition drove him to take a personal journey that resulted in the idea to create a space where he could show his films as well those of other Black filmmakers.\n\nIn 1997, when he had the opportunity to travel to Burkina Faso to participate in the 15th Panafrican Film and Television Festival of Ouagadougou,25 he realized how much his work was recognized and appreciated.\n\n(...) They gave me warm reception. From the airport to the hotel and throughout the duration of the festival, I was respected as a Black Brazilian, as a filmmaker and as a guest. When I saw all those people at the opening ceremony, more than 20 thousand people gathered at a track field, it moved me. The difference between âFESPACOâ and other film festivals around the world is that over there regular people from Burkina and the neighboring countries engage with the event, while âCannesâ or even âFestival do Rioâ are held to the elite, not to the people. 26\n\nExperiences such as those at FESPACO helped to forge Bulbulâs conviction that a new landscape for Brazilian cinema needed to be established. It wasnât enough to just make films, there was also an urgency to create a circuit for the screening of Black-directed films. As Abolitionâs distribution saga illustrates, Black creators faced a double impediment: even when they were able to overcome the difficulties in completing their films, they still had to fight a distribution and exhibition system that was specifically designed to exclude them from theater screens.\n\nTeam photo with Edmar Morel\n\nFinal considerations\n\nIn conclusion, I wish to share with you my individual trajectory throughout the course of conducting research for my Masterâs thesis. I consider myself a member of a generation of Black youth that have been promoting long-silenced conversations and reclaiming the memories of those who have paved the way for us to finally occupy spaces to which we have been historically denied. The very possibility of being able to conduct my research was the result of those who have paved the way before me. In my eyes this is the true legacy of Abolition: providing greater esteem for Black culture, giving it the regard and study it deserves, and scrutinizing history for the purposes of making intellectual contributions to society at large. As an art form, cinema is a tool that has the power to affect, to move and to create new ways of seeing and understanding. To be able to watch and identify myself in a documentary made 32 years ago illustrates how cinema can be timeless.\n\nThis change was made possible by the social policies implemented throughout Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silvaâs and Dilma Rousseffâs administrations, as they pushed for programs aiming to fight for equal access to education. The implementation of race-based affirmative actions and the establishment of programs such as Universidade Para Todos (PROUNI, University for All,)27 provided an important aid that allowed a younger Black and unprivileged generation to go to college, graduate and find better opportunities within the job market. My own trajectory intersects with these policies: as a recipient of a scholarship from PROUNI, I managed to finish college and subsequently enroll in an advanced studies program. At that program, I was inspired to conduct the research from which this article stems.\n\nItâs also important to highlight the expansion of broadband internet throughout new territories in Brazil, as well as the arrival of cheaper technological devices that enabled the rising of new voices from underprivileged areas of Brazilian society. These voices are now creating radical works of art that continue to push forward the conversations kept alive by Bulbul and others. I would also like to take the opportunity to acknowledge that I was only able to start my research on Abolition due to an unofficial, sole hyperlink that is available on a Facebook page devoted to the film (@AbolicaoZozimoBulbul). In the early stages of my research, before I was provided with an official link to the film, that page allowed me to re-watch the documentary multiple times, thus structuring the analysis Iâve developed during my masterâs thesis. That same hyperlink, and , and the film available on Cinelimite, makes it possible for Abolition to be seen by a wider range of people. Â Bulbulâs accomplishment is a work that must be revisited today so that we can finally acknowledge it as an important and unique historical documentation of our country and a pioneering work of Black cinema throughout the world.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nAUGUSTO, Heitor.

In 1974, Bulbul attempted to obtain permission from Brazilâs censorship bureau that would allow him to screen his latest film, âAlma no Olhoâ. However, he was called upon by the military to be interrogated. âThey were suspicious about the film and its authorship, so they requested Bulbul to decode the images, since they thought there was some implicit subversive leftist message. After this event, which lasted for days, feeling psychologically pressured by the general political atmosphere, and fearful of the repressive state forces that were then persecuting artists, he traveled to New York intending to remain away from Brazil for a while.â (CARVALHO, 2012, p. 14)\n\n5. The âquilombosâ (âmaroon communitiesâ) were constituted, according toBeatriz Nascimento, as spaces for resistance, for political organization and for reframing cultural and social values for Black people and their descendants. âAquilombarâ, which in English could be interpreted as âgathering ourselves as a quilomboâ, is a political and epistemological notion that hase merged specifically out of the cultural-historical Afro-Brazilian process.

The program, which also sponsors students interested in further specialization, is funded through a system of tax-exemption organized by the national government.\n\nIn 2007, I worked as a cataloguer at the Cinemateca Brasileira, Brazil's largest film archive. Â A major part of the job was analyzing materials that had recently been donated to the archive and it was not uncommon to run into large collections of 16mm films, still kept in Kodak and Ansco film boxes, complete with nicely handwritten notes displaying what they contained. Despite the quantity of home movies that arrived at the archive, prior to this moment I had rarely heard or read about Brazilian home movies and amateur films. After having the opportunity to view some of these films, I quickly became fascinated with them. It was surprising to me that they provided a chance to see life in Brazil in the 1920s and 1930s from a different point of view, meaning not only a glimpse into the lives of amateur filmmakers and their common aesthetics â trembling cameras, faces directly gazing into the camera, jump cuts and discontinuity â but also images of city life that were made from an unofficial perspective. Despite the fact that home movies of this period were produced by bourgeois families, they remain extremely valuable historical documents because they provide us with a closer look at elements that went beyond the middle class home, such as images of Â historical events, people enjoying leisure time and living within public spaces. In my young cataloguerâs mind, it was obvious that this topic needed further research.\n\nMy first encounter with home movies became the starting point of a long path of research that began with a project that focused on the collection of home movies that are deposited at Cinemateca Brasileira. Working on this collection resulted in my dissertation, \"Filmes domÃ©sticos, uma abordagem a partir da Cinemateca Brasileiraâ, the research for which was undertaken at the Federal University of SÃ£o Carlos. My goal in this project was to build further knowledge about this collection of home movies and to bring more visibility to what was an emerging field in Brazilian film historiography. My research focused on establishing the historical roots underlying the arrival of amateur film equipment in Brazil. Later, my aforementioned path of research led me towards learning about the amateur cinema clubs and festivals throughout the 1920s and 1950s that formed in Rio de Janeiro and SÃ£o Paulo. As Brazilian home movies remain a field with numerous research possibilities, I am currently studying one of the most important film festivals of the 1960s, the \"Festival de Cinema Amador JB/Mesbla\" organized by the Jornal do Brasil newspaper, which screened the first short films of filmmakers such as RogÃ©rio Sganzerla, Andrea Tonacci, Neville D'Almeida, and many other important filmmakers, editors, producers, actresses and actors who were amongst its participants.\n\nI begin with this personal note because more than ten years ago, home movies and amateur films were not a common topic of discussion among those working in the fields of audiovisual preservation and academia in Brazil. But since then, many âHome Movie Dayâ events have been organized in film archives and festivals across the country. As a field of research in Brazil, the history of domestic filmmaking once mainly relied on foreign references, but over the past few decades numerous dissertations and theses have been written about the national history of home movies. In this regard, I wish to highlight the recent publication of the book Cinema domÃ©stico brasileiro (1920-1965) by researcher and professor ThaÃ­s Blank, a pioneer work within our field. Blankâs work focuses on a wide-ranging field of research that begins with Â examining the historical roots of home movies and its different genres, taking different collections deposited in Brazilian archives as primary sources. The book provides close investigation of films and contains thorough archival research. The author delineates the process of patrimonialization of domestic cinema and the increasing interest held by national and regional archives in preserving an area of film production (home and amateur movies) that allows different perspectives regarding film history and a deeper understanding of local and regional histories.\n\nThe last part of Blank's book is dedicated to the migration of raw material in home movies from their original state to their incorporation into documentary films. The archival fever that has overtaken contemporary cinema has also given a new centrality to home movies and amateur films, materials often used in weaving a personal and experimental cinema. Here I mention some Brazilian short and feature films derived from a much more extensive list that prominently utilize or incorporate home movies:\n\nSupermemÃ³rias (Danilo Carvalho, 2013), an experimental film using Super 8mm film from the city of Fortaleza that has been screened in numerous film festivals and has received academic attention.\n\nJÃ¡ Visto, Jamais Visto (Andrea Tonacci, 2013), an intricate montage film made with Andrea Tonacciâs personal archive and \"left overs\" from his lifelong career in filmmaking.\n\nExtratos (Sinai Sganzerla, 2019), a short-film made with 16mm footage shot by RogÃ©rio Sganzerla and Helena Ignez (the directorâs parents as well as the major figures of Brazilian underground experimental filmmaking in the late 60s and 70s) during their years in exile, as they escaped the Brazilian dictatorship installed in 1964.\n\nFartura (Yasmin ThaynÃ¡, 2019), a collage film with photographs and home videos of Â Black families and their affective bonding through the sharing of food and common festivities.\n\nAcademic research and contemporary cinema has evidently played a pivotal role in the discovery of home movies as a valuable source for history and artistic creation. What also stands as one of the most important conquests of the field is the launch of LUPA - LaboratÃ³rio UniversitÃ¡rio de PreservaÃ§Ã£o Audiovisual, a university film archive dedicated to film preservation education and collecting amateur films from the State of Rio de Janeiro. Part of the Department of Cinema and Video Studies of UFF - Universidade Federal Fluminense, one of the only films schools in the country with a mandatory course on film preservation integrated in the curriculum, LUPA began operating in 2017. Guided by the energy of coordinator Rafael de Luna Freire, film preservationist and professor of the same department, the initial LUPA project nurtured the desire to create a space where the work of researchers and film preservationists could walk hand in hand, shortening the gap between universities and film archives.\n\nAnother one of LUPAâs foremost prerogatives is to contribute to the preservation of those film materials that still receive little attention from film archives: amateur films and the wide array of orphan films from the state of Rio de Janeiro. As the concept indicates, orphan films are those which do not possess a clear status of authorship or legal right holdings. They can also be understood as film materials that don't belong in the traditional cinematic dispositif (a narrative feature screened in a movie theater), as they have different functionalities: educational, scientific, nostalgic, along with the myriad other forms of appreciation the moving image can assume. What Iâve learned from my experience with these kinds of materials is that, rather frequently, people are not aware of the historical research value they hold and are unsure where to take these artifacts when practical help in film conservation is needed. As the only film archive dedicated to this kind of production in Rio de Janeiro, LUPA soon received its first donation: The J. Nunes Collection. The J. Nunes Collection holds nine reels of 9.5mm film shot in the 1930s and 1940s. Digitized at the laboratory of Cinemateca Brasileira, these images are now available on LUPA's website.\n\nThe J. Nunes Collection gives us an interesting look at amateur film culture and how the production and consumption of moving images worked in the 1930s and 1940s. During this time period, amateur films were often produced by PathÃ© and many portrayed quotidian life in the streets. The images within the J. Nunes Collection provide insights into how leisure time was enjoyed by a middle-class family in Rio de Janeiro: bullfights, religious festivities, trips to the country and a day at the beach. Carnaval was definitely the favorite pastime of this particular family. The films dedicated to this national festivity also show different forms of capturing the extremely popular celebration, each one with a particular aesthetics.\n\nâPathÃ© Baby apresenta: O Carnaval de 1936 was most likely made by hired professionals who sold images to PathÃ© or produced films exclusively in the 9.5mm format. The film is introduced with steady titles (âPathÃ© Baby presentsâ) and serves as news coverage of the parades and street festivities taking place on the Avenida Rio Branco. The corsos,1 with people parading in cars (at the time a very important indicator of social status), the \"ranchosâ2 and the \"sociedades carnavalescas\"3, which paraded with large, ornamented cars and gentlemen riding horses: all these can be seen in the six minute reel. These professional reels were sold by PathÃ©, the French giant that served as the main supplier in feeding a demand for cinematic home viewing in Brazil, while also offering film projectors and accessories. PathÃ© maintained a consumer market the company had inaugurated in 1912 with the 28mm PathÃ©-KOK system, known as \"Cinematographe du Salon\", or âcinema in the living roomâ. In 1913 this French system was already sold in Rio de Janeiro by Companhia Cinematographica Brasileira. In 1922, PathÃ© launched its most successful system for domestic cinema, the 9.5mm PathÃ©-Baby, and in September of 1923 the company established the SocietÃ© Franco-Bresilienne du PathÃ©-Baby, a branch for the Brazilian market. Two months later, the company was permitted by Brazilian authorities to start its commercial activities in Rio de Janeiro. Understanding that the history and preservation of film technology and equipment is a crucial aspect of film history, LUPA has acquired and organized a collection of film cameras and equipment, part of which have been made available to different exhibitions.\n\nIn O Carnaval de 1936 and Tourada, Festa da Igreja da Penha e Carnaval, images of carnaval are captured by amateur hands, noticeable through the shots in which the camera comes in close proximity to the dressed up âfoliÃµes\".4Â Even though some of the locations in these films are the same as those that were captured in the more professional cinematic productions of Rio, here we find a rarer depiction of these areas, with spontaneous street celebrations, followed by the adults and children of the Nunes family playing and singing while dressed up as Chinese dancers. The beauty and the energy of the crowded streets, the body movements, the joy of a group of children; this spontaneity gives the spectator a very intense feeling of the cultural and existential meaning of carnaval, a feeling of rare translation. Expressions of joy can also be found in the core images of Festa da Penha, a religious celebration in a traditional neighborhood of Zona Norte, and in the scenes of the bathers in BalneÃ¡rio da Urca. The film displays a day spent at the beach and views of the Urca Casino and the Sugar Loaf, both famous sites for tourists. In a different film, Amador J.Nunes saÃºda todos os amigos e presentes, amateur dexterity can be seen in nicely shot intertitles, as the film begins as a sort of reflexive home movie: a woman holds an amateur 16mm camera and points it directly at the main camera which is shooting. Â This reflexive gesture denotes the popular interest in cameras and in the act of filming itself, and we understand from the film that amateurism is about the sheer love of image making and the subjective cinematic experience.\n\nThe process of safekeeping these images and making them accessible are gestures of extreme importance towards building the perception that home movies and amateur films are vital materials to be studied and preserved. As a regional film archive, LUPA has amassed different collections in the past few years, including important personal archives such as documentation regarding Carlos Fonseca, film critic and producer with a long career in cultural management at institutions such as Instituto Nacional de Cinema (INC), as well as the materials of many other amateur filmmakers and collectors. Â These new collections have been revised and organized by students, and the documentation is made available through LUPA's website even while the cataloguing work is still in process, making LUPA an indispensable space for practice and experimentation with strategies for granting access to archival collections. Decentralizing preservation efforts is an urgent issue in Brazil and LUPA is an example of how we can observe that home movies and amateur films are important sources for local histories. The maturation of what was a new field of study ten years ago is a cause for celebration, as amateur and orphan films solidify their place as one of the central initiatives in contemporary film preservation.\n\n1.

Attraction and Retraction\n\nUsually, we would begin an analysis of black representation in Brazilian cinema by listing a group of films associated with the Cinema Novo movement: Aruanda (Linduarte Noronha, 1960), The Turning Wind (Barravento, Glauber Rocha, 1962), Five Times Favela (Cinco vezes favela, Carlos Diegues, Leon Hirszman, Marcos Farias, Miguel Borges and Joaquim Pedro de Andrade, 1962), Bahia of All Saints (Bahia de todos os santos, Trigueirinho Neto, 1961), The Big Market (A grande feira, Roberto Pires, 1961), Ganga Zumba (Carlos Diegues, 1964). One can disrupt this corpus by offering an expanded view, mentioning two films that do not adhere to the stereotypical, paternalistic or submissive portrayals of black people often found throughout Brazilian cinema. Closer to the filmic language of Cinema Novo, we have Compasso de Espera (Marking Time, Antunes Filho, 1972). Compasso is linked to the movement's second phase where urban themes and the contradictions of the middle class are present in films such as The Dare (O Desafio, Paulo CÃ©sar Saraceni, 1965) and Bebel, Advertisement Girl (Bebel, garota propaganda, Maurice Capovilla, 1968). Soul in the Eye (Alma no Olho, ZÃ³zimo Bulbul, 1973), on the other hand, the first film by black filmmaker ZÃ³zimo Bulbul (made with leftover film stock from Compasso de Espera), distances itself from the Cinema Novo films, finding its strength in John Coltraneâs jazz and performance elements. ZÃ³zimo Bulbul stars in Compasso and directs Soul, so these films form a diptych via an umbilical relationship. Inspired by Eldridge Cleaverâs book Soul on Ice (1968),1 Soul in the Eye is Bulbulâs seminal work. It was made in the context of Cinema Novo but marks itself right from the start with an ambiguous distancing, an oscillation which would accompany the filmmaker throughout his oeuvre, both aesthetically and politically. Consequently, the films of Antunes Filho and Bulbul are simultaneously close and distant from the priorities that the Cinema Novo movement had delineated in the 1960s.\n\nâDespite eventual criticism towards black representation in the films of the Cinema Novo movement, Noel dos Santos Carvalho points out that the movement marked an important change of attitude in that respect:\n\nCinema Novo put black people front and center, away from the stereotypes spread in the past by the chanchadas, the films of the Vera Cruz Company and such. Its anti-racism was based on: 1) condemning racial stereotypes; 2) ignoring the concept of race in favor of the generalistic concept of people; 3) dealing with aspects of black history, religiosity and culture. (...) However, we want to emphasize the change of attitude, the disruption represented by a group of films that took black people away from stereotypical roles and made them the protagonists of their own stories.2\n\nApplying cinema as a tool for thought and anti-racist political practice marks the common ground among Cinema Novo films. However, when considering the form and approach of the films, particularly those associated with black matters, Bulbulâs films appear distant from the Cinema Novo movement. In 1982, amid obscure transactions by Embrafilme,3 Bulbul harshly criticized Carlos Diegues and Walter Lima Jr., and even turned down an offer to work on King Chico (Chico Rei, Walter Lima Jr., 1985), because he considered it âhistorically abhorrentâ, and âmildâ, made to be shown âon Globoâ.4 He opposed the filmâs representation of black people but also the kind of filmic experience it provided, which to ZÃ³zimo was innocuous and lacking invention.\n\nThe plot thickens. Years later, in the epigraph of his first feature film, Abolition (AboliÃ§Ã£o, 1988), Bulbul inserts a dedication to two members of the Cinema Novo movement, Glauber Rocha and Leon Hirszman. It was a controversial move because, upon returning to Brazil after a self-imposed exile in Europe,5 it was noticeable how his relationship of attraction-retraction to Cinema Novo remained intact. In fact, today, it seems more accurate to evoke Bulbul as the filmmaker who worked with forms and themes that required an experimental style that no other Cinema Novo filmmaker had the tools to create. This dichotomy offers us a way to determine just how much of an alien Abolition is, be it in relation to Brazilian documentaries, to Cinema Novo or even to Bulbulâs own oeuvre. When considering the relations between cinema, Blackness and racism in Brazil, we identify in Abolition a sort of forcefield which indicates that, rather than integrating or not integrating hegemonic movements, ZÃ³zimo chose to follow his own path.\n\n2. Atlantic Cinema\n\nAbolition deals with filmic language within a specific technical and aesthetic dimension by extrapolating its documentary values and proposing a singular experience. Abolition is therefore linked to a group of films that deal with the relationship between documentary and fiction. It is organized in registers, interviews, archive footage and staged scenes in order to expose the opportunistic articulation between the historical lie of the abolition of slavery and the lived reality of black people in contemporary Brazil. Today, more than thirty years after its debut, Abolition seems less like âan expanded Alma no Olhoâ6 and more like an experience which resonates with these formally exploratory documentary and fiction works. It can accordingly be seen as an âAtlanticâ film, i.e., a film made to bring forth a cosmos of free associations. Other examples include films such as The Age of Earth (A Idade da Terra, Glauber Rocha, 1980), Twenty Years Later (Cabra Marcado para Morrer, Eduardo Coutinho, 1984), ÃrÃ­ (Raquel Gerber, 1989), and The Thread of Memory (O Fio da MemÃ³ria, Eduardo Coutinho, 1991). Atlantic Cinema is a cinema of crossing, a cinema pervaded by colonial and racial themes that are at the same time direct and indirect, objective and subjective. Atlantic Cinema contains a myriad of signs in movement through historical ages and facts, with a broad and dilated referential, in an audio-logo-visual polyphony embedded in the filmâs form.\n\nThe film, with its unique approach, was not well-received by black filmmakers, black researchers or the black public â who, frankly, donât usually have access to movie theaters. In a later essay on Bulbul, Noel dos Santos Carvalho reinforces the perception that Abolitionâs experimentalism could not accomplish its intended effect, as it constituted âan inventory of speeches, performances and lectures regarding the abolition of slavery, which in part accounts for its irregular nature, its repetitions and excessesâ. Carvalho also points out that âfrom the perspective of narrative structure, itâs the most didactic of these films, which adds to its irregular natureâ and he adds: âAbolition, with a running time of 150 minutes, couldn't find acceptance from the audience. Not even among the black population. It was restricted to a small circle of intellectuals and activists of the black movementâ. In his essay âEsboÃ§o para uma HistÃ³ria do Negro no Cinema Brasileiro\"7 Carvalho calls attention to the fact that the crew of the film was composed almost exclusively of black men and women (the exceptions being Miguel Rio Branco with his experimental cinematography and Severino DadÃ¡ with his precise editing), noting that âwhat we see is mediated by the gaze of this crew. So, itâs not only about telling the history of black people in Brazil, but having a black perspective of historyâ. In both cases, there seems to be a consensus that the eventual qualities of the film are present on a purely symbolic level, i.e., âoutâ of the film itself, whether due to the initial effort to try and problematize the abolition of slavery from a black gaze, or due to the representation of the ethnic composition of the crew. Ahead, I will propose some ideas based on the internal structure of the film, to affirm it as a major representation of Atlantic Cinema, the group of films that have formed a singular trajectory in Brazilian film.\n\n3. Material and Treatment\n\nIn an interview with Peter Hessli in February 1994, American cinematographer Arthur Jafa makes a distinction between material and treatment. Not being able to choose the material with which to work, African diasporic creativity, self-affirmed by finding new uses, appropriates and deeply transforms the materials at hand: âSo a lot of our creativity coalesced around the notion of treatment, that is, transforming in some meaningful fashion, given materials. (...)â Unlike photography and painting, in which the image, as a material product, is the point of arrival, the image produced by cinema is merely a point of departure. The equipment and materials needed to make a film are even more inaccessible to black populations, and so when black people appropriate it, itâs noticeable in very subtle ways. Jafa gives this example: John Coltrane taking My Favorite Things away from its original territory and, with a particular treatment, creating openings which were unthinkable until then, âAfrican-American creativity has been shaped by the specific circumstances Black people found themselves in; we werenât generally able to dictate the materials we were given to work withâ. What makes Abolition extremely exceptional is that, unlike Bulbulâs first film, made with leftover film from Compasso de Espera, unlike the Cuban âarchive cinemaâ of Nicolas LandriÃ¡n and Santiago Ãlvarez or even Jafa himself, this film seems to be controlled both ways: in the style of its production and approach, there is a complete ownership of the creation and transformation of the material and the treatment. Said material and this treatment, coupled with the choice of a predominately black crew, indicate conscious aesthetic choices.Â\n\nBesides all this, Abolition holds its place in the realm of âAtlantic Cinemaâ for the cosmic quality it possesses. In the film, a linear narrative and a propagandistic representation of reality give way to a field in which Bulbul articulates interviews, archive recordings and photos. Organized in a non-linear way, the film is an ample space without a center, a work in favor of orality, a trancelike sequence of shots, staged interviews, rhythmic editing and local energy. Abolition cannot be simply reduced to a film that features a black gaze on black history, because history for the diasporic is never an ends but a means, a strategy always aimed at the future, for survival in a tough environment. This strategy has one purpose: to make life in the present possible. This seems to me to be he most potent definition of âancestryâ: the ability to tell oneâs own history with enough power to break it apart and retell it, to build a singular historicity. So, this is not about an absent or idealized blackness, nor an integrated and coherent resistance movement which unravels in the light of mistakes and conflict. This is about a black manâs gaze encompassed by a black and non-black cosmos which involves him and with which he negotiates his very existence.\n\nAbolition cannot be simply reduced to a film that features a black gaze on black history, because history for the diasporic is never an ends but a means, a strategy always aimed at the future, for survival in a tough environment.

This seems to me to be he most potent definition of âancestryâ: the ability to tell oneâs own history with enough power to break it apart and retell it, to build a singular historicity.\n\n4. âWhat about May 14th, 1888?â\n\nThe opening minutes of Abolition are crucial to understanding the way the film moves and develops. An intertitle with an historical marker exemplifies critical irreverence: May 12th, the day before the signing of the Lei Ãurea, the documentation of Brazilâs official abolition of slavery. Further ahead, another intertitle: May 14th, 1888. In a text about the film, Bulbul asks: âhow was May 14th, 1888?â Playing around with the dates moves the historical axis from the abolition as key event, in favor of relating its causes and consequences to the brutal, incomprehensible present, far from the grasp of history. Every image in the opening of the film is accompanied by the sound of the shutter cracking like a whip. We hear the voices of Clementina de Jesus, Tia Doca and Geraldo Filme singing \"Canto I\", from the 1982 album O Canto dos Escravos, part of the repertoire of work songs collected by philologist Aires da Mata Machado Filho in the late 1920s, in SÃ£o JoÃ£o da Chapada, Diamantina, Minas Gerais. The shutter/whip accentuates each change of image â ultimately amassing a collection of photos and paintings that depict the horrors of slavery â in cuts that sometimes follow the rhythm perfectly and other times in a syncopated manner. The association between the shutter and the whip is meant to be in understood critically, signaling new and unexpected ways to think about racial issues in Brazil.\n\nFinally, a third intertitle indicates: May 13th. âDia de brancoâ (âday of the white [person]â), a once-common racist saying that was used to refer to the days of the work week in Brazil. A storm hits the city as the Abolition film crew arrives at the Imperial Palace, in Rio de Janeiro, where the shooting will take place. The key grip, a young black man, sets up a light. The lights are for the behind the scenes, there is no interview or any other reason for them. The film then proceeds to show a Congada8 coming into a church with banners. This elliptical manner of free associations, without explicit reason, is a prevalent structural element of the whole film. The variations in rhythm of editing and the interior lighting in the shot indicates a free conception of film form. All of the interviews in the film suggest a dramatic staging, contrary to the historical staging of the signing of the Lei Ãurea. The Ã¼ber-fake feeling of this fictional signing of the Lei Ãurea conveys to us that the law that freed the slaves was all an act. The purposefully idiotic intonation of actress Camila Amado, playing Princess Isabel, contrasts with the following scene, a long Carnaval parade in the SambÃ³dromo,9Â intercut with hilarious shots of the delirious Princess screaming from the balcony of her palace. From the portrayal of the colonial Princess who believed she was playing a key historical role, to the complex expression of Carnaval one hundred years later, an uncertain feeling stands out - something between beauty, discomfort and irony. In the Carnaval of Rio, Black bodies play instruments, dance, sing and work by pushing allegorical vehicles in the procession.10\n\nThe sequence of dedications which come soon after is peculiar: âto the master Glauber Rochaâ, to Leon Hirszman and \"to black filmmaker HermÃ­nio de Oliveira\", followed by a mention of the Movimento Negro Unificado (Unified Black Movement) over the images of carnavalgoers leaving the SambÃ³dromo and heading to the Central do Brasil station. This station is where people usually take the train to the Zona Norte and Zona Oeste neighborhoods, as well as to the municipalities in Baixada Fluminense. At this moment in the film, we spot the great samba composer Catoni among the passerbys. We leave the harmonious sounds and dancing bodies of the Carnaval for the Central do Brasil station, and then move into the trains that take the black carnivalgoers to their homes in the Rio suburbs. Cut to a puppet theater show for children which deals directly with racism. Then, shots of the crowded Rio-NiterÃ³i ferry feature a synthesizer-heavy soundtrack reminiscent of Krautrock. Black construction workers and shoeshiners, a dog taking a dump, a woman at work, as we go into her house. A baby, a birth certificate dated 1868, and, then we stumble upon an impressive interview with Mr. Manoel, a former slave who, at 120 years of age, gives the following statement: âtoday we live in bitterness, we didnât get paid but we had satisfaction. We were satisfied with the food, everyone was satisfiedâ.\n\nA tone of subtle irony can be detected when we cut from the interview with the grandson of Princess Isabel, JoÃ£o de Orleans e BraganÃ§a, to the crew of black technicians with their equipment in hand leaving the Imperial Palace in a hurry. Then, with a single statement, Maria Beatriz do Nascimento dismantles the official truths of the Royal family by demonstrating how the political pact which culminated in the abolition of slavery threw the lives of the black population into precariousness. The passage from a Monarchy to a Republic:11 âblack people stopped obeying their masters and started being controlled by the Stateâ.\n\nJoel Rufino sitting on a curb on the idyllic Pedra do Sal, the original stronghold of Rioâs urban samba. Bulbul and his editor, Severino DadÃ¡, make use of an Eisensteinian montage, intercutting the Rufino interview with shots of waves hitting rocks. The sound design allows the urban soundscape and the musical soundtrack to coexist within the interview. Joel Rufino presents Aunt Carmen as a bastion of the PraÃ§a Onze, a location in Rio which at the start of the 20th century was known as Little Africa. Writer and actress Thereza Santos makes the assertion, while standing in a storm, that after the abolition the living conditions of black women grew worse.\n\nAbolition, in effect, sets itself far from Cinema Novo by posing a different set of questions. The film relates to Brazilian history by parodying its sociological rules, and its style is similar to that of Frederick Wisemanâs in its use of cinema to apprehend reality by capturing objective information as well as fragmentary and temporary aspects. Such seemingly random displacements accentuate the polyphony and allow for an ambiguous relationship, either emphasizing Bulbulâs very presence, or sharing a space with the spectator, the crew, and the characters. It is not just about black gaze or Bulbulâs gaze; he captures a reality in the film that extrapolates subjectivity, organizing it by fields of action: modulation, intersections, fragments, rhythm and cutting, symbols, posters and words shown on screen.\n\n5. Atlantic Trance\n\nIn Abolition, Bulbul allows for sections of the film to modulate through and from subtle changes in themes, signs and elements. One example of this is the samba and the various forms in which it is presented. There are sections in crossing, marked by intersections of the central issue with other âpresencesâ, fragments and details which make it unstable: Native Brazilians, Northeasterners,12 and even white people, aiming at a tridimensional black gaze, i.e., opening up to a cosmological and sociological assimilation that is broader than what white hegemony allows. There is a fragmented and incomplete field intercut by shining presences. This field is marked by a very peculiar use of talking heads, shaped by the interaction of the camera with the interviewee: the theatrically beat-down presence of Benedita da Silva; LÃ©lia Gonzalez talking and gesticulating in the sunlight. The bishop Dom HÃ©lder CÃ¢mara providing a critical analysis of beaches overflowing with white bodies while Jards MacalÃ© sings Rio sem tom, a song he wrote to criticize the fact that Tom Jobim had sold a song to Coca-Cola.13 Perhaps due to the influence of orthodox Marxism, ZÃ³zimo noticeably devoted very little time to Afro-Brazilian religions, favoring Dom HÃ©lderâs strange interview. Even so, there is a precious interview with MÃ£e Filhinha, the founder of the IIÃª AxÃ© Itayle terreiro14, in Cachoeira, Bahia.\n\nSome critics and researchers have commented that Abolition is repetitive. I think this repetition is a necessary asset in the filmâs structure, organized by intertwining themes and treatments. There is a trace of repetition which, like the absence of a narrator, can be understood as an aesthetic choice. And, like in The Age of the Earth, the repetition aims to provoke a state of trance, of hallucination. To repeat in order to hallucinate. Repetition brings forth the Atlantic trance. The consensus regarding Glauberian expression as an allegory begets very particular ways of exploring dynamic stasis, the static progression of the dispute between antagonistic forces, which indicates that, when it comes to Brazilian racism, everything is transformed in order to keep the status quo intact. As a complement to that field, there is the written word, posters, watchwords, and intertitles to rectify and break open the shots.\n\nSome critics and researchers have commented that Abolition is repetitive.

And, like in The Age of the Earth, the repetition aims to provoke a state of trance, of hallucination. To repeat in order to hallucinate. Repetition brings forth the Atlantic trance.\n\nA particularly dark moment in the film is that of the anti-interview with anthropologist Gilberto Freyre, author of the classic study Casa Grande & Senzala.15 Unable to speak due to his poor health condition, Freyre is represented by hisson, who limits himself to repeating platitudes from Freyreâs work regarding the value of the âafroblackâ element (his words). The camera moves slowly out of the room, as if to indicate an abandonment, which is reinforced by the underexposed cinematography. Other particularly interesting moments: the presence of communist politician LuÃ­s Carlos Prestes just twenty minutes into the film indicates a movement towards the unexpected, as it allows for a white political leader to speak in its first few minutes. Black sociologist and journalist Muniz SodrÃ© walks through the corridors of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (I have to note how weird it is to see black people inside a Brazilian university in 1988). Francisco LucrÃ©cio and Correia Leite tell the story of how the Frente Negra16 Â was founded in the 1930s. The Revolt of the Lash gets a special mention in the interviews of historian Edmar Morel and of the daughter of JoÃ£o CÃ¢ndido.17 Two repentistas18 sing about the Abolition and the situation of black people in the history of Brazil.The widow of black poet and cultural agitator Solano Trindade complains that her husbandâs memory is being erased. Abdias do Nascimento, a playwright, activist and politician, talks about his experience with the Black Experimental Theater.19 Reminiscent of Kanye West, a current icon who has blamed black people for slavery, singer Agnaldo TimÃ³teo insists that first and foremost black people have to change their mentality. Composer Nei Lopes drinks beer while Paulo Moura plays his saxophone, in contrast with the part of SÃ£o Paulo which is inhabited by people from the Northeast, cornered between misery and the commodification of life itself. Then, ZÃ³zimo exposes the violence of the Military Regime on black bodies. Despite the reflexive tone usually attributed to this film, AboliÃ§Ã£o doesnât only express the vision of its author. Simultaneously close and away from Bulbul, a cinema with a collective soul is born, in a panel of diffuse presences, always elusive.\n\n6. The Party is Over\n\nThe price paid for being black in Brazil is huge. ZÃ³zimo Bulbulâs trajectory in Brazilian cinema is linked to a personal effort to conquer his own ground to work in, and to make it possible for a black filmography to arise. The generosity of Bulbulâs Atlantic aesthetics is contrasted at times by a collective tendency to reinforce militant watchwords and the demand for basic rights. When a black person fails to correspond to what minority groups, society and even his brothers and sistas expect of him, his walk is even harder. Just ask Albert Ayler, John Coltrane or Itamar AssumpÃ§Ã£o. The list of black men and women who were misunderstood by the black movement because they failed to follow what the community considered appropriate is a long one. These black people are usually unlucky. Bulbulâs name is on that list, and so Abolition might have been a huge disappointment to those who followed his work. Either way, the film bets on collective experimentalism as a way to survive, even though it doesnât end on an optimistic note.\n\nAmid images of streets filled with trash and the luxury of show houses, Grande Otelo calls on the black âtaskforceâ: âNothing was ever abolished and today we have it even worse, because now black and white people are slaves.â Next, black street children impress us with their direct, political discourse: âWe are still slaves. No work, no healthcare, no educationâ¦â The tragic symbolism is exacerbated. These crescendo signals the end is near, just as the mamulengo doll announces: âAnd thus, ladies and gentlemen, we end our tragicomedy in various acts, without ever reaching the ending! The abolition of slavery in Brazil. Or, to put it bluntly: black people can go fuck themselves.â An intertitle announces the ending: âthe party is overâ. The camera is pointed at the Central do Brasil station, then moves slowly down behind the grates of Campo de Santana. The last shot is the Central do Brasil station seen from behind iron bars, materializing, with the camera movement, the mutual imprisonment and the thin dialectics of oppression.\n\n1.

Embrafilme is the main producer of Brazilian films since the companyâs conception in 1969 until its implosion in 1990. Embrafilme provided a certain level of infrastructure and helped forge a new public interest in Brazilian cinema despite the fact that the market was dominated by foreign studios. However, Embrafilmeâs practices were also met with criticism from filmmakers who made the accusation that they prioritized certain films while delaying the commercial release of others.\n\n4.

The film tells the story of a boy from a favela who receives white pants as a gift, and proud of this symbol of social status, wears his white pants while walking through the city of Rio de Janeiro. SÃ©rgio Ricardoâs first film reveals his desire to call attention to Brazilâs lower social classes, something that will become a common theme throughout his filmography (as noted by Gustavo Menezes de Andrade in his 2017 dissertation). Looking at his career as a whole, this wasn't the first time that an interest in exploring the lives of the lower classes manifested itself. For example, besides working as an actor, SÃ©rgio Ricardo began his career as a musician and composer. In his song âZelÃ£oâ, made one year prior to Menino da CalÃ§a Branca, he sings about a favela musician who lost his home to a flood.\n\nMulti-talented, SÃ©rgio Ricardo both directs Menino da CalÃ§a Branca and composes its soundtrack, on which he explores the sonorities of Bossa Nova using only his voice, guitar and flute. In this article, we aim to highlight the major themes of this short film about a favela child in the city of Rio de Janeiro, analyzing the way the plot develops alongside the music in the film, while also taking into account the larger context of music in Brazilian cinema at that time.\n\nMenino da CalÃ§a Branca is not the first occasion that a Brazilian film showed images of a favela in Rio de Janeiro. For example, there is the case of a lost 1935 film by Humberto Mauro, Favela dos meus amores. But it was Rio, 40 Graus (Rio 100 Degrees F.) by Nelson Pereira dos Santos which would become an important reference for filmmakers of the 1960s who were looking to film in favelas. This 1955 film portrays the lives of five children from the favela in their daily struggle for survival. Nelson Pereiraâs film is considered by many researchers, such as Mariarosaria Fabris (2007), as having been influenced by Italian Neorealism in its compassionately humanist way of looking at the lower classes (holding an âethical postureâ, as Cesare Zavattini recommended). The film is similar to the films of the Neorealists that often have sad endings, where characters have no hope for a better future.2\n\nRio, 40 Graus contains images made in favelas such as Morro do CabuÃ§u, and we can even see and hear the samba school Unidos da CabuÃ§u rehearsing in the favela in the filmâs final sequence. It is worth mentioning that Nelson Pereira dos Santos decided to edit Menino da CalÃ§a Branca for free because he got excited when he saw SÃ©rgio Ricardoâs initial material. In fact, while SÃ©rgio Ricardo was finishing up edits of Menino da CalÃ§a Branca, the Centro Popular de Cultura (CPC)3 put together the collective film project titled (Five Times Favela). This work would be composed of five short films by directors of the emerging Brazilian Cinema Novo movement: Leon Hirzsmanâs Pedreira de SÃ£o Diogo, CacÃ¡ Dieguesâ Escola de Samba, Alegria de viver, Miguel Borgesâ ZÃ© da Cachorra, Marcos Fariasâ Um favelado and Joaquim Pedro de Andradeâs Couro de gato (Cat Skin).4\n\nâ\n\nSÃ©rgio Ricardo said in an interview that Menino da CalÃ§a Branca was considered to be included in Cinco Vezes Favela, but it ended up being denied for its âexcessive lyricismâ.5 He added in the interview that maybe the film didn't have the didacticism intended by the CPC. It is coincidental that, among the five films chosen for Cinco Vezes Favela, Cat Skin is also a story about favela children. As the themes of Menino da CalÃ§a Branca and Cat Skin are similar, this article will compare both films, while taking into account their influential predecessor, Nelson Pereira dos Santosâs Rio, 40 Graus.\n\nTo begin, what could this accusation of excessive lyricism be referring to in Ricardoâs film? Like Nelson Pereira and Joaquim Pedro, SÃ©rgio Ricardo filmed on location in a favela (the now extinct Macedo Sobrinho). In the first shot of Menino da CalÃ§a Branca we see slum shacks with shabby rooftops, and as the opening titles run, we hear the song âEnquanto a tristeza nÃ£o vemâ (âWhile the Sadness Doesn't Comeâ). Then a boy appears (played by Zezinho Gama), playing games such as hopscotch and hide-and-go-seek alone and with his friends. No details of the favela setting are spared, as we can see an open-air sewage ditch that runs through an alley. Menino da CalÃ§a Branca does not beautify any aspects of favela life."
