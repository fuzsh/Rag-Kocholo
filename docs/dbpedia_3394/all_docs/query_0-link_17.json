        "text": "The aim of the present review is to provide information to researchers and practitioners concerning the reasons for the altered viability and the medium- and long-term consequences of cryopreservation of manipulated mammalian embryos. Embryo manipulation is defined herein as the act or process of manipulating mammalian embryos, including superovulation, AI, IVM, IVF, in vitro culture, intracytoplasmic sperm injection, embryo biopsy or splitting, somatic cell nuclear transfer cloning, the production of sexed embryos (by sperm sexing), embryo cryopreservation, embryo transfer or the creation of genetically modified (transgenic) embryos. With advances in manipulation technologies, the application of embryo manipulation will become more frequent; the proper prevention and management of the resulting alterations will be crucial in establishing an economically viable animal breeding technology.\n\nPreimplantation embryos from cattle, sheep, and goats may be cryopreserved for short- or long-term storage. Preimplantation embryos consist predominantly of water, and the avoidance of intracellular ice crystal formation during the cryopreservation process is of paramount importance to maintain embryo viability. Embryos are placed into a hypertonic solution (1.4 - 1.5 M) of a cryoprotective agent (CPA) such as ethylene glycol (EG) or glycerol (GLYC) to create an osmotic gradient that facilitates cellular dehydration. After embryos reach osmotic equilibrium in the CPA solution, they are individually loaded in the hypertonic CPA solution into 0.25 ml plastic straws for freezing. Embryos are placed into a controlled rate freezer at a temperature of -6Â°C. Ice crystal formation is induced in the CPA solution surrounding the embryo, and crystallization causes an increase in the concentration of CPA outside of the embryo, causing further cellular dehydration. Embryos are cooled at a rate o..."
