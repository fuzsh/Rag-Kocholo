        "text": "Short International Careers, Part Nine\n\n1- David Gerald Unsworth\n\nEverton defender David Unsworth caught the eye of Terry Venables in Everton’s FA Cup winning run of 1994/95.\n\nFor the Umbro Cup that was to take place in the summer of 1995, Unsworth was called up as a replacement after Tony Adams had to withdraw because of injury.\n\nHis only cap was in the very first match on June 3rd, 1995 vs. Japan (2-1 win).\n\nHe was never called up again.\n\nPhoto From: Calcio 2000, Issue 27, February 2000\n\n(David Unsworth)\n\n2- Pascal Baills\n\nFrench defender Pascal Baills was a teammate of Laurent Blanc at Montpellier. His solid performances allowed Montpellier to reach the quarterfinals of the Cup Winners Cup in 1990/91 where they were eliminated by Manchester United.\n\nHe earned his only cap a few weeks after this elimination when he came on as a substitute for Pascal Vahirua in the 56th minute of France’s EC Qualifier vs. Albania at Paris (March 30, 1991, France 5-Albania 0).\n\nHis total International career amounted to 34 minutes. He was never called up again as a big move to Olympique Marseille in the offseason did not increase his chances, since he was unable to break into such a competitive squad full of Internationals.\n\nPhoto From: Onze-Mondial, Issue 25, February 1991\n\n(Pascal Baills with Montpellier, 1990/91)\n\n3- Massimiliano Cappioli\n\nItalian Midfielder Massimiliano Cappioli was a member of the Cagliari squad that earned promotion to the Serie A in 1990 and qualified for the UEFA Cup in 1993.\n\nThese performances earned him a move to AS Roma in 1993. Arrigo Sacchi selected him only once in a Friendly vs. France in Naples on February 16, 1994 (1-0 France win).\n\nHe replaced Giovanni Stroppa in the 65th minute. Therefore his International career amounted to 25 minutes.\n\nPhoto From: Guerin Sportivo-January 30-February 5, 1991\n\n(Massimiliano Cappioli with Cagliari, 1990/91)\n\n4- Jerry Murrien de Jong\n\nDutch defender Jerry De Jong was signed by PSV Eindhoven in the summer of 1989. He earned only 3 caps in his career and all were during the 1990/91 season and all were European Championship qualifiers.\n\nNovember 21, 1990-Holland 2-Greece 0\n\nDecember 19, 1990-Malta 0-Holland 8\n\nApril 17, 1991-Holland 2-Finland 0\n\nHe is the father of current Dutch International Nigel De Jong.\n\nPhoto From: Het Nederlands Elftal, de histoire van oranje, 1989-1995, Authors: Matty Verkamman and Henk Mees\n\n(Jerry De Jong before his first ever cap, November 21, 1990, EC Qualifier, Holland 2-Greece 0)\n\n5- Paul Steiner\n\nLong serving Koln defender Paul Steiner was previously uncapped when he was surprisingly chosen, as a 33 year old, as one of the final 22 members of West Germany’s 1990 World Cup winning squad by Franz Beckenbauer.\n\nHis only cap was prior to the World Cup, when he replaced Klaus Augenthaler in the second half of a Friendly vs. Denmark on May 30, 1990 at Gelsenkirchen (1-0 win). He never played for Germany again.\n\nPhoto From: Fussball Magazin, January february 1984\n\n(FC Koln’s Paul Steiner, 1983/84)\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nThe First Time ….., Part Nine\n\n1-The First time that a Republic of Ireland International came on as a substitute was in a World Cup Qualifier on April 8, 1934 (Holland 5-Ireland 2).\n\nAlfred Horlacher replaced William Jordan in the 40thminute.\n\nPhoto From: Football Association of Ireland-75 Years, Author Peter Byrne, 1996\n\n(Alfred Horlacher, May 11, 1930, Belgium 1-Ireland 3)\n\n2- The First Time ever that a Danish player became a Professional was when\n\nCarl William Hansen of BK 1903 Copenhagen joined Scotland’s Rangers Glasgow in 1921.\n\nPhoto From: IFFHS, Danmark (1908-1940), Sverige (1908-10940)\n\n(Carl William Hansen, October 1918 before an International , October 6, 1918, Denmark 4-Norway 0)\n\n3- The First Time that an English League match was televised was on August 29, 1936, Arsenal 3-Everton 2.\n\n4- The First Time that a Welsh international was ever sent off was in a World Cup Qualifier, on September 28, 1973 (Poland 3-Wales 0), when Trevor Hockey was sent off in the 39th minute.\n\n5- The First Time that a Home Team (British) lost at home to a foreign opposition was when Scotland lost a Friendly vs. Austria on December 13, 1950 at Glasgow (0-1 loss).\n\nPhoto From: Österreichs Fußball Länderspiele Chronik 1902 – 1993, Author: Anton Egger\n\n(Austria squad, December 13, 1950, Scotland 0-Austria 1)\n\nPhoto From: Österreichs Fußball Länderspiele Chronik 1902 – 1993, Author: Anton Egger\n\n(Theodor Wagner and William Alexander Woodburn, December 13, 1950, Scotland 0-Austria 1)\n\n↧\n\nFootball’s Quarrels and Feuds, Part Seven\n\n1- Stephane Demol and Leo Clijsters, 1986-1991\n\nBelgian International defenders Stephane Demol and Leo Clijsters had an ongoing feud as both were vying for the Libero position in the national Team. On the plane to Mexico for the 1986 World Cup, apparently Demol made a public jibe that Clijsters was only coming to carry everyone’s luggage.\n\nLater on, the very first time that started a match together in the heart of defense with Clijsters as Libero and Demol as Stopper, Demol was overheard telling Clijsters that it was the last time he would be playing as Libero since he would replace him.\n\nMore often than not it was Clijsters that would start as the Libero.\n\nPhoto From: Foot Foot Magazine, May 1990\n\n(Leo Clijsters)\n\nPhoto From: Foot Foot Magazine, May 1990\n\n(Stephane Demol)\n\n2- Mario Corso and Giovanni Ferrari, 1962/64\n\nThere were many who felt that Internazionale Milano defender Mario Corso was unjustly excluded from Italy’s 1962 World Cup Finals squad for Chile.\n\nThe player himself certainly held a grudge. During a Friendly between Inter and the Czechoslovakian National team in March 1964, Italy’s 1962 World Cup selectors Manager Giovanni Ferrari and Paolo Mazza (who made up the Technical Commission) were in the audience.\n\nAfter scoring a goal, Mario Corso rushed towards the VIP stands and made an obscene gesture directed at them.\n\nHe was fined for his actions.\n\nPhoto From: 100 Anni del Campionato del Calcio\n\n(Mario Corso)\n\nPhoto From: Calcio 2000, Issue 19, May 1999\n\n(Giovanni Ferrari in his playing days)\n\n3- Edgar Davids and Fabio Capello, 1997\n\nWhen Fabio Capello returned to manage AC Milan in 1997, he sidelined Dutch midfielder Edgar Davids. The temperamental Davids made his displeasure very public. As a result Davids was transferred to Juventus in the November transfer window and found a new lease on life by helping them win the Scudetto.\n\nCapello for his part explained to the media that Davids was a very difficult character. He claimed that he was so difficult that even his former Ajax Manager Louis van Gaal did not sign him for Barcelona like he was doing with his other players and urged the media to ask van Gaal.\n\nPhoto From: World Soccer, January 1999\n\n(Edgar Davids)\n\nPhoto From: Onze-Mondial, Issue 131, December 1999\n\n(Fabio Capello)\n\n4- Hugo Sanchez and Leo Beenhakker, 1992\n\nBy the 1991/92 season, Mexican striker Hugo Sanchez was at his seventh season at Real Madrid. He had missed a lengthty part of the season due to injury. When he was fit, Dutch Manager Leo Beenhakker felt he was not ready to start matches and sidelined him for some matches which angered the striker famous for his ego.\n\nSanchez grew angrier and verbally attacked the Management. Things deteriorated to such a point that he was axed from the team by Club President Ramon Mendoza and trasnfered back to Mexico at the conclusion of the season.\n\nPhoto From: World Soccer, Summer 2008\n\n(Leo Beenhakker)\n\nPhoto From: Foot Magazine, March 1986\n\n(Hugo Sanchez)\n\n5- Stephem Keshi and Aad De Mos, 1990/91\n\nNigerian defender Stephen Keshi left Anderlecht at the end of the 1990/91 season because of his difficulties dealing with Dutch Manager Aad De Mos. He even said many felt had left the club because of the Manager.\n\nPhoto From: World Soccer, June 1989\n\n(Aad De Mos)\n\nPhoto From: France Football, Issue 2375, October 15, 1991\n\n(Stephen Keshi)\n\n↧\n\nThe uncapped, Part Seven\n\n1- Frans van Rooy\n\nDutch midfielder Frans van Rooy started at out PSV Eindhoven. Due to stiff competition he was first loaned to Belgian club Antwerp, before joining them outright.\n\nHe was tipped to be capped for Holland’s Friendly vs. Brazil at Rotterdam on December 20, 1989 (0-1 Brazil win), however, an injury deprived him of that chance and he was never called up again.\n\nPhoto from: Voetbal International, October 26, 1985\n\n(Frans van Rooy at PSV Eindhoven, 1985/86)\n\n2- Fausto Pari\n\nItalian midfielder Fausto Pari was one of the unsung heroes of Sampdoria’s Scudetto win in 1991.\n\nArrigo Sacchi called him up in his first ever squad for the EC Qualifier vs. Norway on November 13, 1991 (one to one tie).\n\nHowever, he never even made the bench and was not called up again.\n\nPhoto from: Calcio 2000, Issue 22, August 1999\n\n(Fausto Pari)\n\n3- Peter Luccin\n\nPeter Luccin was one of the bright young hopes of France in the late 90s when he starred at a young age for clubs such as Bordeaux, Olympique Marseille and Paris St. Germain. He was often tipped as a future International.

He was expected to shine in a squad containing Roberto Baggio and Gianluca Vialli among others. His first and only season coincided with the implementation of the rule that clubs could sign as many foreigners as they liked, but only three could play at a given time. Juventus’ other three foreigners: German stopper Jurgen Kohler, Brazilian sweeper Julio Cesar and German midfielder Andreas Moeller were ahead of Platt in the pecking order and as a result his play was limited.\n\nAt the end of the season he joined Sampdoria to have more playing time.\n\nPhoto From: World Soccer, April 1991\n\n(David Platt at Aston Villa, 1990/91)\n\n2- Richard Witschge and Barcelona 1991/93\n\nYoung Dutch midfielder was seen as the bright future of Holland at Ajax. It was inevitable that he would join a big club like Barcelona in 1991. Barcelona Manager Johann Cruyff saw much potential in him having coached him many years before at Ajax.\n\nHowever, he was also victim of League regulations that allowed four foreigners but only three could play. The three foreign players ahead were more experienced (Ronald Koeman, Michael Laudrup and Hristo Stoichkov) and naturally played more. After two disappointing seasons, he left to join French club Bordeaux and Brazilian Romario replaced him at Barcelona in 1993.\n\nPhoto From: World Soccer, September 1991\n\n(Richard Witschge at Barcelona, 1991/92)\n\n3- Colombian stars at Real Valladolid 1991/92\n\nSpanish club Real Valladolid already had Colombian Leonel Alvarez on their books when they signed eccentric goalkeeper Rene Higuita and Captain Carlos Valderrama in the summer of 1991. They went even further by hiring their National Team Manager Francisco ‘Pacho’ Maturana.\n\nHowever, the Colombian experiment was a fiasco and the three players were all shipped out by midseason. An isolated Maturana was fired by the end of the season.\n\nPhoto From: World Soccer, September 1991\n\n(Carlos Valderrama at Real Valladolid, 1991/92)\n\nPhoto From: Soccer International, Issue 4, April 1990\n\n(Rene Higuita)\n\n4- John van Loen and Anderlecht 1990/91\n\nDutch striker John van Loen was signed from Roda JC Kerkrade in the summer of 1990.

The emergence of 16 year old Ghanaian revelation Nii Lamptey and the consistency of Luc Nilis blocked his path.\n\nHe was relieved to return to the Dutch league and joined Ajax at the end of the season.\n\nPhoto From: Foot Magazine, Issue 107, September 1990\n\n(John van Loen at Anderlecht, 1990/91)\n\n5- Georges Leekens and Anderlecht 1987/88\n\nFuture Belgium National Team manager Georges Leekens was regarded as a rising Manager at Cercle Brugge when he was appointed as Anderlecht Manager in 1987.

All three had reputations as hard men and physically tough players.\n\nThe office with the names of all 3 is shown, with two WBA players looking at it, one says ‘I don’t know what this will do to the opposition but I am terrified’\n\nCartoon VI:\n\nPhoto From: France Football, Issue 2309, July 10, 1990\n\nExplanation: Diagrams of the goals in the first round of 1990 World Cup for Group A, containing Italy, Czechoslovakia, Austria and USA\n\nFor clearer view see:\n\nCartoon VII:\n\nPhoto From: Mondial, Old Series, Issue 1, February 1977\n\nExplanation: This shows Bayern Munich’s Gerd Muller nearing 600 career goals.\n\nCartoon VIII:\n\nPhoto From: Placar, Issue 13, June 12, 1970\n\nExplanation: This cartoon references Pele’s famous long distance shot that narrowly missed the goal in Brazil and Czechoslovakia match during the 1970 World Cup (June 3, 1970, 4-1 Brazil win)\n\nFor clearer view see:\n\nCartoon IX:\n\nPhoto From: Start1988_june 06_№24\n\nExplanation: A portrait of Gianluca Vialli\n\nCartoon X:\n\nPhoto From: Foot Magazine, Issue12, April 1982\n\nExplanation: A portrait of Kevin Keegan\n\nCartoon XI:\n\nPhoto From: 90 minutes, March 12, 1994\n\n(By Nick Davies)\n\nExplanation: If you watched Chelsea matches (1993/94) , you could always see a few cars behind the goal. This cartoon references that fact by showing a car salesman trying to sell a car and Chelsea’s Dennis Wise accidentally breaks the glass with a shot.\n\nNote: can someone explain the reason the cars were there?\n\nAlso the car salesman looks very much like Vinnie Jones, can someone explain if that is the case, if so what is the reason?\n\n↧\n\nTeams of the year, Part Three\n\nFrance Football annually ranks National Teams per calendar year, and ESM (European Sports Magazines) select the ‘Team of the season’ by position\n\nFrance Football’s Team of the Year\n\nYear 1980:\n\nEurope: West Germany\n\nAfrica: Algeria\n\nSouth America: Argentina\n\nThe rankings and matches of the year\n\n(Magazine / Language : France Football, Issue 1813, January 6, 1981 / French)\n\n(Magazine / Language : France Football, Issue 1814, January 13, 1981 / French)\n\nPhoto From: Onze, Issue 55, July 1980\n\n(West Germany squad, Top, left to right:Ulrich Stielike, Karlheinz Förster, Horst Hrubesch, Hans-Peter Briegel, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, Bottom, left to right: Klaus Allofs, Manfred Kaltz, Bernard Dietz, Harald Anton ‘Toni’ Schumacher, Bernd Schuster, Hans Peter ‘Hansi’ Muller , June 14, 1980, European Championships, West Germany 3-Holland 2)\n\nFF National Team of the Year\n\nESM’s Team of the Year\n\nSeason 1996/97:\n\nAngelo Peruzzi (Italy and Juventus)\n\nJocelyn Angloma (France and Internazionale Milano)\n\nCiro Ferrara (Italy and Juventus)\n\nFernando Hierro (Spain and Real Madrid)\n\nRoberto Carlos (Brazil and Real Madrid)\n\nLuis Enrique (Spain and Barcelona)\n\nClarence Seedorf (Holland and Real Madrid)\n\nRaul (Spain and Real Madrid)\n\nAlessandro Del Piero (Italy and Juventus)\n\nDavor Suker (Croatia and Real Madrid)\n\nRonaldo (Brazil and Barcelona)\n\nPhoto From: World Soccer, July 1997\n\n(Team of the season 1996/97)\n\nESM team of the season\n\n↧\n\nWhen Calcio Ruled the Football World-A Personal Journey-Part Five (1986/87)\n\nThe 1986/87 season started in the aftermath of the 1986 World Cup that Diego Maradona had dominated single handedly.\n\nIn doing so he had signaled a power shift. He was now the undisputed number one player on the planet, replacing the ageing Michel Platini.\n\nThe previous season’s Scudetto triumph could not hide the fact that Juventus was clearly fading after dominating for most of the 1970s and 80s.\n\nLegendary manager Giovanni Trappatoni left Juventus that summer after a decade filled with triumphs to take over at Internazionale Milano.\n\nJuventus appointed former Como Manager Rino Marchesi who many felt had done a good job by keeping up a small team like Como in the elite.\n\nJuventus had actually achieved a major coup that summer by acquiring the highly coveted Welsh striker Ian Rush of Liverpool. Due to a foreign players transfer embargo on all teams (except newly promoted ones), he was loaned back to Liverpool that season, in line to replace the following season Platini, who many already expected to depart.\n\nOtherwise the squad remained intact with Platini, Michael Laudrup as foreigners and with a backbone of veterans such as Scirea, Cabrini, Brio, Manfredonia and Bonini. Inter property Aldo Serena was loaned for another season at Juventus. Their main acquisitions were Beniamino Vignola (returning after a season at Verona) and Roberto Solda from Atalanta.\n\nAfter the World Cup triumph, many expected Maradona to lift Napoli even higher. The previous season’s third place had opened the door to European Football and just like the previous season, they made some efficient purchases.\n\nThe side managed by Ottavio Bianchi signed the young Italian International midfielder, the appropriately named, Fernando De Napoli from Avellino, along with future Italian International striker Andrea Carnevalle from Udinese. Their other key arrivals included Francesco Romano from Triestina and Giuseppe Volpecina from Pisa.\n\nPhoto From: Guerin Sportivo, September 24-30, 1986\n\n(Napoli new signing Andrea Carnevalle)\n\nThese additions made a squad that already contained current and former Italian Internationals such as Salvatore Bagni and Bruno Giordano even stronger.\n\nInternazionale Milano also reinforced itself for the coming campaign. In addition to handing over the reins to Trappatoni, talented midfielder Gianfranco Mateolli arrived from Sampdoria (He would earn his only caps for Italy that season), Adriano Piraccini joined from Bari and Oliviero Garlini from Lazio.\n\nThe side was already high on quality and contained Walter Zenga, Riccardo Ferri, Giuseppe Bergomi, Giuseppe Baresi, Marco Tardelli, Alessandro Altobelli, Pietro Fanna and West Germany’s Karl-Heinz Rummenigge.\n\nThey had made a change as far as their second foreigner, gone was Republic of Ireland veteran Liam Brady, who was offloaded to Ascoli. In his place came Argentina’s former Captain Daniel Passarella from Fiorentina.\n\nOther veterans such as Evaristo Beccalossi and Fulvio Collovatti were offloaded to Brescia and Udinese respectively, while Giampiero Marini retired.\n\nThis was Silvio Berlusconi’s first full season as owner of AC Milan. He made some team additions while still retaining Nils Liedholm (for the time being) in control of the team. An ageing Paolo Rossi was offloaded to Verona and in his place came Giuseppe Galderisi from the opposite direction. AS Roma Defender Dario Bonetti, Atalanta Midfielder (and soon new International) Roberto Donadoni arrived along with Fiorentina pair of goalkeeper Giovanni Galli and Daniele Massaro. The English pair of Ray Wilkins and Mark Hateley were still retained, however, as the season progressed it became apparent that both would soon be replaced with the Dutch pair of Ruud Gullit and Marco van Basten.\n\nPhoto From: Guerin Sportivo, September 24-30, 1986\n\n(AC Milan’s Roberto Donadoni)\n\nPhoto From: Guerin Sportivo, December 10-16, 1986\n\n(Paolo Rossi at Verona)\n\nArgentinean talent Claudio Borghi had also been signed to be integrated once the embargo was lifted.\n\nSampdoria appointed the Yugoslav Vujadin Boskov as Manager and registered the arrivals of foreign pair of West German Hans-Peter Briegel from Verona and AS Roma’s Brazilian midfielder Toninho Cerezo.\n\nAS Roma, still under the Swede Sven-Goran Eriksson (although Angelo Sormani actually possessed the license to manage), held on to the Pole Zbigniew Boniek and other ageing stars like Bruno Conti and Roberto Pruzzo. Their main acquisition was Denmark’s Klaus Berggreen from Pisa.\n\nThe rest of their arrivals were relative young unknowns such as Marco Baroni, Paolo Baldieri and Massimo Agostini.\n\nOther notable transfers included the arrival of Swedish striker Johnny Ekstroem at newly promoted Empoli (in November), Argentinean striker Ramon Diaz moving from Avellino to Fiorentina, Dutch striker Wim Kieft joining Torino from Pisa and the double transfer of veteran strikers Francesco Graziani (from AS Roma) and Argentinean striker Daniel Bertoni (from Napoli) to Udinese.\n\nBefore the season had even started Udinese seemed destined to be one of the relegated teams, since the League had imposed them a nine-point handicap due to a match fixing scandal (Totonero 1986).\n\nAs for myself, at the end of previous season I had by chance discovered the magazine ‘Soccer America’ and had subscribed to it. This weekly magazine kept me up to date with all the scores and the news.\n\nThis was the only specialized Soccer magazine in the United States at the time (At least that’s what I believe, I never came across another). Their coverage of the European Soccer scene and International matches in general was very informative, specially given the lack of interest in the nation as a whole.\n\nWhile there was still no television coverage to speak of, at least I could read about the events and the scores.\n\nThis was still a better alternative than the previous year, when I was completely in the dark for the entire season.\n\nAs far the events on the field, both Juventus and Napoli started the season in strong fashion. Until the eighth match of the season the teams were equal on points and undefeated.\n\nThey had both been eliminated on the European front at that stage. Napoli had been defeated by French Club Toulouse in the First Round of the UEFA Cup and Juventus had been eliminated by Real Madrid in the second round of the Champions Cup.\n\nThe turning point of the season was on Matchday 9 (November 9th), when Napoli visited Juventus in the table-topping clash of the season.\n\nJuventus struck first early in the second half through Michael Laudrup, however, a more confident Napoli struck back with three goals through Ferrario, Giordano and Volpecina. This win signaled Napoli’s title winning potential in addition to Juventus’ decline and capitulation.\n\nPhoto From: Mondial, new series, issue 83, February 1987\n\n(Diego Maradona between Massimo Bonini and Sergio Brio, November 9, 1986, Juventus 1-Napoli 3)\n\nJuventus never really recovered from this loss and in the following weeks went further behind and suffered more heavy losses vs. AS Roma and Sampdoria.\n\nInter became Napoli’s closest challengers and narrowed the gap.\n\nBy Matchday 14, the two teams were level on points as Napoli suffered its first defeat of the season at the hands of Fiorentina (1-3).\n\nHowever, by the following week Napoli was back on top after a win at Ascoli coupled with Inter’s loss at Verona.\n\nNapoli started the second half of the season with five consecutive wins, but Inter still kept pace.\n\nBy March, AS Roma crept up the table and was runner-up, but quickly lost pace and Inter was back on.\n\nInter’s Daniel Passarella was involved in an ugly incident, when he kicked a ball boy in a match vs. Sampdoria on March 8th (1-3 loss), who was guilty in his eyes of delaying in giving him the ball. He was fined, suspended (6 matches) and apologized.\n\nWith seven matches left, Inter defeated Napoli (1-0) to close the gap somewhat.\n\nBy Matchday 26 (April 12th), there were some worries in the Napoli camp as they were defeated (0-3) at Verona. Inter won that same day to close the gap to 2 points.\n\nThis was as close Inter got and in the coming weeks they imploded and lost composure by losing two of their last four matches.\n\nThe title decider was on Matchday 29 (May 10th), Napoli hosted Fiorentina and the one-one tie gave them the point they needed to win their first ever Scudetto.\n\nDiego Maradona even stated that Napoli’s title had made him even happier than winning the World Cup.\n\nPhoto From: Onze, Issue 138, June 1987\n\n(May 10, 1987, Napoli 1-Fiorentina 1)\n\nDiego Maradona endured an unforgettable season during which he also became a father for the first time and also had to deal with a paternity suit early in the season.\n\nNapoli ended a memorable season a few weeks later by clinching the League and Cup double by defeating Atalanta.\n\nOther noteworthy events at this end of the season included Silvio Berlusconi’s decision to remove Liedholm and appoint Fabio Capello to guarantee European qualification for AC Milan. He did so by winning a playoff vs. Sampdoria following the conclusion of the regular season.\n\nAC Milan’s Pietro Paolo Virdis was the top goalscorer with 17 goals, with a young Gianluca Vialli behind with 12 goals.\n\nPhoto From: Guerin Sportivo, September 24-30, 1986\n\n(AC Milan’s Pietro Paolo Virdis)\n\nThe already condemned Udinese was relegated with Atalanta and Brescia.\n\nBy the last match, Juventus surprisingly moved up to second position, having more or less been out of the title race for much of the season.\n\nJuventus’ last match (May 17, Brescia 3-2 win) was significant as it was Frenchman Michel Platini’s last ever official match as he retired from the game. The triple European player of the year enjoyed great success in Italy, except this last season, where he was a shadow of his former self. Though still young enough (almost 32 years old), it was clear that the stress of the Italian Serie A had aged and jaded him.\n\nPhoto From: Onze, Issue 138, June 1987\n\n(Platini at the conclusion of his last ever match, may 17, 1987, Juventus 3-Brescia 2)\n\nHis retirement coincided with the general decline of Juventus as they would not win another Scudetto for nearly a decade. In the coming years they would lose their position in the hierarchy, as the new power was Napoli and the two Milanese clubs. The Juventus/Roma axis that had dominated the League for most of the decade was now overtaken.\n\nPhoto From: Mondial, new series, Issue 85, April 1987\n\n(the changing of the guard)\n\nThis end of the season also brought an end for many stars of the past. In addition to Platini, other foreigners such as Liam Brady (transferred at midseason to West Ham United), Karl-Heinz Rummenigge (eventually transferred to Servette) and Daniel Bertoni (retirement) left the Serie A.\n\nAC Milan’s Ray Wilkins and Mark Hateley transferred to the French League and Wim Kieft joined the ambitious PSV Eindhoven.\n\nIn addition many of the stars of the 1982 Generation also ended their Serie A careers. Gabriele Oriali and Paolo Rossi retired after final seasons at Fiorentina and Verona respectively. Claudio Gentile left Fiorentina to play one last final season in the Serie B with Piacenza. Giancarlo Antognoni (Fiorentina) and Marco Tardelli (Inter) left the Serie A and started the process of pre-retirement by joining Rummenigge in the Swiss League.\n\nWith the transfer embargo on the foreign players now lifted the new season looked exciting with the impending arrivals of Careca (Napoli), Rush (Juventus), Gullit and van Basten (AC Milan), Voeller (AS Roma), Scifo (Inter) and Berthold (Verona).\n\nHowever, historically, the most significant decision turned out to be a coaching appointment (1987/88 season, to be continued…..)\n\nPhoto From: Mondial, new series, issue 83,

Argentina’s World Cup was one year away. Argentina as hosts, were condemned to Friendly matches in preparations for their World Cup.\n\nTo test themselves against worthy European Competition that they would surely be facing, the Argentine Federation invited many European nations to play vs. the national team that summer.\n\nArgentina under the control of a Junta led by General Videla was beset by political problems and terrorism. There were questions about their ability to host the event. The authorities wanted to showcase these friendlies to display to the world, their competence and willingness to host the Main Event without any problems.\n\nThe European nations themselves were more than willing to partake on this Trans-Atlantic journey to get acquainted with the climatic conditions and the venues and the atmosphere they would be facing (provided they were lucky to qualify).\n\nThe teams in question were defending World Cup Champions West Germany, England, Poland, France, Scotland, Yugoslavia and East Germany.\n\nThe action was not only restricted in Argentina, most of these European nations chose to tour the continent as a whole, for these months of May, June and July.\n\nJust about all of them arranged Friendlies vs. the continent’s powerhouse Brazil, as well as other South American nations (not to mention local clubs) along the way.\n\nArgentina Manager Luis César Menotti was very keen on this endeavor. He wanted the National team to play many matches in a period of a month, to mirror World Cup Finals conditions, where one would have to play a minimum of seven matches to reach the Final. He also believed many friendlies were essential as a way of team and group building.\n\nMenotti wanted to impose an attacking style of play for the National team. He wanted the National Team to play like his Huracan squad of 1973 that had won the title. Their (his) tactics consisted of Zonal defense and a short passing game.\n\nHe was at odds with the tactics of Boca Juniors Manager Juan Carlos Lorenzo. Though Boca Juniors were a successful side at the time, their style was the antithesis of Menotti. Though successful, Lorenzo’s Boca were a physical, defensive side.\n\nLorenzo had predicted that Menotti’s Argentina would fail and not be able to defeat any European side. According to Lorenzo, the game had changed in the past decade, and teams had to be more athletic and faster to win. (One could say Lorenzo was Menotti’s Bilardo of the next decade). In any case, Menotti’s desire seemed a tall order at a time, when only a handful of Argentinean clubs played with tactics resembling his.\n\nMenotti had recently been successful in making the Argentinean Federation to pass a law forbidding potential National team players to be transferred to European Clubs until at least the end of the World Cup. The law had been passed too late to stop Norberto Alonso and Mario Kempes from joining Olympique Marseille and Valencia respectively. Menotti repeatedly stated that he would not call up any European based player; he did however acknowledge that Kempes would be the hardest player to replace. Nevertheless, as far as this 1977 summer was concerned, Kempes and all the other foreign-based players were out of World Cup contention.\n\nThe Argentina squad itself had a backbone of players, many of who would make the Finals squad by the following summer.\n\nThe squad included the eccentric goalkeeper Hugo Gatti, Captain Jorge Carrascosa, Alberto Tarantini, Jorge Olguin, Daniel Passarella, Osvaldo Ardiles, Ricardo Villa, Ricardo Bochini, Americo Gallego, Daniel Bertoni, Leopoldo Luque, René Houseman and Omar Larrosa.\n\nBrazil for their part were preparing for their final phase of World Cup qualification to take place in July. The new Manager Claudio Coutinho had replaced Osvaldo Brandao in March. He publicly looked forward to the matches to test with ‘the best schools of European Football’. He considered Poland as the most dangerous opponent and then West Germany and England. He felt France were still not at their level yet. He wanted to try 4-3-3 that was employed by most Brazilian clubs. His squad contained stars such as goalkeeper Emerson Leao, Luis Pereira, Marinho, Edinho, Toninho Cerezo, Zico, Paulo Cesar, Roberto Dinamite, as well as veteran Roberto Rivellino.\n\nThe series of matches started on May 29th, with Argentina hosting Poland at Buenos Aires. Argentina chose Boca Juniors’ ‘La Bombonera’ as its venue for all their matches.\n\nJacek Gmoch’s Poland squad were comfortably set to qualify for the World Cup and were one of the finest teams in Europe at the time.\n\nThe squad had many leftovers from the glorious 1974 squad, including Captain Kazimierz Deyna, penalty stopping goalkeeper Jan Tomaszewski, Władysław Żmuda, Grzegorz Lato, Andrzej Szarmach and Henryk Kasperczak. The new rising star was Zbigniew Boniek who in time would become an international star.\n\nPoland had arrived at Argentina just the day before the match. They were the better team in the first half and scored first through Lato in the 32ndminute.\n\nJust before halftime, Argentina was awarded a penalty kick, which was scored by Daniel Bertoni, after a handball offense in the box.\n\nArgentina was missing René Houseman, who had been suspended by his club Huracan for indiscipline. They gradually took control in the second half, as fatigue caught up with the Polish. First Leopoldo Luque and then midway through the second half Daniel Bertoni scored again for a convincing (3-1) win.\n\nPhoto From : EL GRAFICO Nº 3008 (31-5-1977)\n\n(Leopoldo Luque, May 29, 1977, Argentina 3-Poland 1)\n\nThe defending World Cup Champions West Germany was the next team to visit the hosts at ‘La Bombonera’ on June 5th. West German Manager Helmut Schoen had to contend with the loss of inspirational Captain Franz Beckenbauer to the NASL’s New York Cosmos. Berti Vogts, ‘Der Terrier’, was the new Captain, with veterans such as goalkeeper Sepp Maier, Rainer Bonhof and Bernd Holzenbein leading a squad that included many new youngsters such as Manfred Kaltz, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and Rudiger Abramczik. They could no longer count upon Gerd Muller to score goals at will, however, many had high hopes for his namesake Dieter Muller and Klaus Fischer.\n\nAs far as the match itself, the Germans (wearing green) dominated the hosts with Fischer scoring twice and Holzenbein delivering the third, before Daniel Passarella scored a consolation goal. The Germans were in total domination and the crowd applauded them at the end and were praised by the Argentinean media for their display.\n\nPhoto From : EL GRAFICO Nº 3009 (07-06-1977)\n\n(June 5, 1977, Argentina 1-West Germany 3)\n\nThree days later on June 8th, West Germany defeated a listless and uninspired Uruguay (2-0) at Montevideo’s Estadio Centenario, with goals by Heinz Flohe, early in the second half, and Dieter Muller at the death. Uruguay had already been eliminated from the World Cup qualifiers, as a result they were dejected and not much could have been expected of them.\n\nOn the same day, Brazil hosted England at Rio’s Maracana Stadium. All was not well in the English Camp. In the previous week they had been defeated twice at Wembley to Wales and Scotland in the Home Championship. The Scotland match was marred by the Scottish fans’ invasion of the pitch and the destruction of the goalposts. The talking point had been star Kevin Keegan’s recent transfer from Liverpool to SV Hamburg. World Cup qualification seemed bleak with Italy seemingly in the driver’s seat. In fact for this match vs. Brazil, England Manager Don Revie had to miss to go to Helsinki to watch the qualifier between Finland and Italy. Of course, there was more to this trip for Revie, which transpired later (that we shall get to), but Italy’s (3-0) win effectively dashed England’s hopes. With Revie absent, Les Cocker was in charge to pick a squad that in addition to Keegan, contained the likes of goalkeeper Ray Clemence, Phil Neal, Trevor Cherry, Emlyn Hughes, Trevor Francis and Ray Wilkins to name a few. The day before the match Trevor Brooking was sent home due to injury.\n\nEngland played well defensively and kept Brazil at bay. Rivellino, though impressive in this match, was unable to break the resilient English defense. Brazil mostly controlled the second half, but Ray Clemence made many fine saves to keep the match scoreless. Brazilian winger Gil was well guarded by Trevor Cherry and had no impact. Gil’s frustration was apparent when he openly complained that Coutinho was hampering him by playing him in the right wing. Brazil was whistled off the park by their own fans at the end of the match. This was the first time that England had not lost at Brazil.\n\nTwo days later on June 10th, Poland continued its tour by playing at Lima vs. Peru. They were fresher for that match and dominated the hosts from the start. Szarmach and Deyna scored within the first twenty minutes to give Poland a commanding lead. Luces pulled a goal back in the 62ndminute, however, just a minute later the impressive Kasperczak scored Poland’s third.\n\nTwo days later, June 12th turned out to be the busiest day on the continent as three matches were played. At LaPaz, Poland continued its fine form by defeating the hosts (2-1) with goals by Lato and Kapka in the 90thminute.\n\nBrazil and West Germany tested one another at Maracana. The impressive West Germans were unfazed and held their own against the hosts. They scored first early in the second half through Fischer, however, with minutes remaining Rivellino, celebrating his 100th cap, evened the score.\n\nPhoto From : Fussball Magazin, Issue 6, September October 1977\n\n(Rudiger Abramczik and Rodrigues Neto, June 12, 1977, Brazil 1-West Germany 1)\n\nMost of the drama of the day occurred at ‘La Bombonera’ where Argentina hosted England. The atmosphere was tense, even before the match started. The Argentinean fans booed the English National Anthem. They chanted ‘Animals’, in reference to Alf Ramsey’s insult from the 1966 World Cup. They also chanted ‘Pirates’, in reference to the Falkland Islands dispute (that would eventually erupt into a war in 1982).\n\nArgentina was still missing the suspended Houseman, but also Hugo Gatti, Jorge Carrascosa and Ricardo Villa.\n\nEngland scored within two minutes when Stuart Pearson scored from Mick Channon’s near post cross. In the 15th minute, Brian Greenhoff fouled Daniel Bertoni near the edge of the box and Bertoni himself scored from the free kick. Otherwise, the match was a cautious defensive affair. Kevin Keegan rarely threatened and had no impact.\n\nWith ten minutes remaining, Trevor Cherry fouled Bertoni. When Bertoni got up he punched Terry and knocked some teeth out.\n\nThe pair, who had been booked before, were immediately sent off. The Argentinean Federation suspended Bertoni for four matches and also exonerated Cherry.\n\nPhoto From : EL GRAFICO Nº 3010 (14-6-1977)\n\n(Daniel Bertoni scoring from a free kick, June 12, 1977, Argentina 1-England 1)\n\nOn June 14th, West Germany continued its tour with a layover at Mexico. The somewhat tired Germans fell behind twice in the first half. They gradually got back in the game in the second half and Klaus Fischer scored twice to tie up the match.\n\nEngland wrapped its tour the next day, June 15th, with a scoreless tie vs. the dispirited Uruguay squad at Montevideo. The scoreless draw was a continuation of England’s defensive tactics that many critics decried. Revie’s 4-4-2 tactics were roundly criticized and blamed for the unimpressive performances.\n\nBoth teams were booed off the field at the end. This match turned out to be the only match that Revie named an unchanged side.\n\nOn the same day, Scotland made their debut on the tour at Santiago vs. Chile. Chile had also been eliminated from the World Cup qualifiers and had arranged a team with little preparation. It was no surprise that they were defeated (4-2) with Kenny Dalglish, Lou Macari (twice) and Asa Hartford scoring. Scotland was coming off a victory in the Home Championship and had appointed Alistair Mc Leod as Manager just the previous month.\n\nThree Days later, on June 18th, Scotland lined up vs. Argentina. Incidentally the Argentinean fans did not boo the same National Anthem that they had booed vs. England.\n\nJust like the match vs. England, it was a tight match with many fouls and the result was one-all tie. Both sides scored their goals through penalty kicks. With less than 13 minutes remaining Scotland were awarded their penalty kick from which Donald Masson scored. Three minutes later Argentina were awarded a penalty kick of their own and Daniel Passarella scored. And just like the match vs. England two players were sent off. In the 56th minute, Argentina’s Vicente Pernia punched Scotland’s Willie Johnston in retaliation after a foul. Both players were sent off.\n\nMenotti, in uncharacteristic fashion, defended the violent tactics of his players.\n\nPhoto From : World Soccer, August 1977\n\n(June 18, 1977, Argentina 1-Scotland 1)\n\nThe following day, June 19th, Poland ended its tour by playing Brazil at São Paulo. Zico and Roberto Dinamite were left out of the lineup, replaced by Paulo Isidoro and Reinaldo. Brazil was excellent for most of the match and deservedly scored through Paulo Isidoro and Reinaldo in the first half. Rivellino scored Brazil’s third from a penalty kick in the second half. Poland got back into the game towards the end and scored a consolation goal from Boniek.\n\nPhoto From : Onze, Issue 27, March 1978\n\n(Andrzej Szarmach and Toninho Cerezo, June 19, 1977, Brazil 3-Poland 1)\n\nA few days later, on June 23rd, Scotland finished its own tour by visiting Brazil at Maracana. They held out bravely against Brazil before succumbing to a Zico free kick with twenty minutes remaining. Rivellino scored Brazil’s second five minutes later.\n\nOn June 26th, France and Yugoslavia made their first appearances. Yugoslavia faced Brazil at Belo Horizonte and almost won with Ivica Surjak particularly impressive. Yugoslavia was better in the first half, with Brazil gradually asserting themselves in the second half but unable to break the Yugoslav defense. Claudio Coutinho described this as Brazil’s hardest match of the tour. Brazil was predictably whistled off the field at the end.\n\nMichel Hidalgo’s rejuvenated France squad was led by skipper Henri Michel and Libero Marius Tresor. Nancy’s Michel Platini and other youngsters such as Patrick Battiston, Maxime Bossis and Didier Six represented the new generation.\n\nMany French managers, most notably Saint Etienne’s Robert Herbin, had been opposed to this grueling tour at the end of the season. Herbin was particularly concerned about his players Christian Lopez and Dominique Bathenay, who were exhausted.\n\nHowever, Hidalgo insisted it was necessary and an opportunity not to be missed for the experience and the preparations of the national team.\n\nAgainst the hosts Argentina, France was in better shape and pressed Argentina. The French were the better side in the first half, in the second half, Ricardo Villa and Houseman pressed the French harder but to no avail. Though the match ended scoreless, France had looked better. The French camp was surprised as they expected a stiffer test. Platini described the Argentina squad as too static and lacking the quality of surprise to worry most European teams.\n\nArgentinean Press tried in vain to make Hidalgo give reasons why Argentina were playing poorly, however, Hidalgo limited his responses on his own squad.\n\nPhoto From : Mondial, Old Series, Issue 6, July 1977\n\n(Olivier Rouyer between Jorge Carrascosa and Daniel Killer, June 26, 1977, Argentina 0-France 0)\n\nThe most exciting match of the tour was four days later at Maracana when Brazil took on France.\n\nBefore the match Hidalgo had stated that France had come in all modesty to learn from this tour, while Coutinho emphasized that Brazil had to earn back its colors and pride.\n\nBrazil started the match in strong fashion, especially Cerezo. Not surprisingly, given their domination, Edinho scored Brazil’s first goal in the 30thminute. However, after the goal Brazil appeared to take their foot off the pedal. Hidalgo had remarked this and urged his team to attack as he sensed Brazil were tiring. However, Brazil scored again early in the second half through Roberto Dinamite and Hidalgo’s plan seemed to have backfired. Undeterred he urged his squad to continue attacking. In the next minute, Didier Six scored a spectacular effort from long range to give France some hope (some time later, Didier Six admitted he had used his hand to control the ball).\n\nThe goal spurred France on and they continued attacking. With five minutes left, Olivier Rouyer took a corner, which was headed in by Marius Tresor. The Brazilian public was taken by France’s audacity and applauded Tresor. At the end of the match, the public even chanted ‘França, França’.\n\nThe overjoyed Hidalgo was very emotional with these chants and described this match as France’s best since the 1958 World Cup.\n\nPhoto From : Mondial, Old Series, Issue 6, July 1977\n\n(Paulo Isidoro and Omar Sahnoun, June 30, 1977, Brazil 2-France 2)\n\nA few days later on July 3rd, a tired France concluded its tour with a loss (1-3) against Brazilian club Atlético Mineiro.\n\nOn the same day, Argentina hosted Yugoslavia in another tight affair and only won with a penalty kick by Passarella in the first half.\n\nPhoto From : EL GRAFICO Nº 3013 (05-7-1977)\n\n(Ruben Galvan, July 3, 1977, Argentina 1-Yugoslavia 0)\n\nOn July 12th, the series of Friendlies ended when Argentina hosted East Germany (in its only match of the tour). Argentina ended the summer on a positive note with a much-improved performance in defense and won (2-0) with goals by Houseman and Carrascosa.\n\nPhoto From : EL GRAFICO Nº 3015 (19-7-1977)\n\n(Oscar Ortiz, July 3, 1977, Argentina 2-East Germany 0)\n\nSo what were the lessons learned? The Argentinean public was disappointed with its team. The press in particular was opposed to Menotti’s tactics and the violent fouls in the England and Scotland matches. During all their matches played at ‘La Bombonera’, the public chanted for the appointment of Juan Carlos Lorenzo of the successful Boca team. As far as the World Cup Finals, the Argentinean Federation chose to select River Plate’s Stadium (El Monumental) as its venue for home matches.\n\nEven though, Menotti had vowed he would not select foreign-based players, the squad’s limitations forced him to make a concession on that principle. He stated he would have to call up at least a few of the foreign-based players with Mario Kempes on the top of the list.\n\nGiven Menotti’s preaching of beautiful, attacking Football, it was ironic how violent they were in some of these matches. This carried over into the World Cup the following year, with the shameful display that led to the sending offs of Andras Torocsik and Tibor Nylasi, as well as the physical battle with Brazil, not to mention the gamesmanship used in the Final concerning Dutchman Rene van der Kerkhof’s plaster cast on his arm (Leaving out the 6-0 Peru win and all the conspiracy theories surrounding it).\n\nIt’s also strange, given Menotti’s image of a free and open thinker, that his training camps were like Army barracks. This may have led to the exclusion of Hugo Gatti. His refusal to join a training camp in February 1978 to recuperate from an injury sealed his fate and Ubaldo Fillol replaced him. These training camps were also too much for Captain Jorge Carrascosa who left the squad on his own accord. The reason that he gave was that ‘His Parents had earned the right to see their son’, not to mention his wife was due to give birth during the Finals. There were also reports that both players were at odds with the Federation over bonus payments.\n\nAs far as Brazil, the general analysis was that they lacked a genuine center forward. Though Rivellino was impressive that summer, by the following year he would be a spent force. By the time of the World Cup, Claudio Coutinho, much like Mario Zagallo with the 1974 team, was attempting to ‘Europeanize’ the team’s tactics. Coutinho would sadly be killed in 1981 in a scuba diving accident.\n\nOf all the team on tour, West Germany was the most impressive. Klaus Fischer received much praise, as did Holzenbein and Abramczik. The duo of Manfred Kaltz and Rolf Russman seemed to have been able replacements for Beckenbauer and Georg Schwarzenbeck. However, by the time of the World Cup, the loss of Beckenbauer would be sorely felt and in contrast to this tour the Germans ended up having a poor World Cup.\n\nPoland in general lived up to their reputation with Henryk Kasperczak as the pick of the bunch.\n\nScotland gave a positive impression on this tour, with goalkeeper Alan Rough voted by the Scottish press as their best player.\n\nBy the time of the World Cup, a false sense of security and confidence had set in. They entered the World Cup as an outside bet, however were shellacked by Peru and were unable to defeat Iran. The unlucky Willie Johnston, who was punched and sent off in this tour, had an even worse World Cup, when he failed a dope test and was suspended.\n\nFrance gave a good impression, though they were still years sway from being a great side.\n\nEngland ended up having an eventful summer especially off the field. At the beginning of the tour, Don Revie was supposedly away supervising World Cup qualifying group opponents Finland and Italy. However it was discovered by ‘Daily Mail’ that he was in fact negotiating with officials from the United Arab Emirates. Revie was banned for breach of contract and in his place Ron Greenwood was appointed.\n\nFor a (Non-World Cup) summer, an entire continent was witness to a feast of football, where lessons were learned (perhaps).\n\nIn a way this comprehensive tour was a precursor to mini tournaments that World Cup hosts usually hold a year ahead of the Tournament as a dress rehearsal (These days the Confederations Cup fills that role).\n\nThe Sequence of Matches:\n\nMay 29, 1977- Buenos Aires, (La Bombonera)-Argentina 3-Poland 1\n\nJune 5, 1977- Buenos Aires, (La Bombonera)-Argentina 1-West Germany 3\n\nJune 8, 1977- Montevideo, (Estadio Centenario)-Uruguay 0-West Germany 2\n\nJune 8, 1977- Rio de Janeiro, (Estádio do Maracanã)-Brazil 0-England 0\n\nJune 10, 1977- Lima, (Estadio Nacional)-Peru 1-Poland 3\n\nJune 12, 1977- Buenos Aires, (La Bombonera)-Argentina 1-England 1\n\nJune 12, 1977- La Paz, (Estadio Libertador S.Bolivar)-Bolivia 1-Poland 2\n\nJune 12, 1977- Rio de Janeiro, (Estádio do Maracanã)-Brazil 1-West Germany 1\n\nJune 14, 1977- Mexico City, (Estadio Azteca)-Mexico 2-West Germany 2\n\nJune 15, 1977- Montevideo, (Estadio Centenario)-Uruguay 0-England 0\n\nJune 15, 1977- Santiago, (Estadio Nacional)-Chile 2-Scotland 4\n\nJune 18, 1977- Buenos Aires, (La Bombonera)-Argentina 1-Scotland 1\n\nJune 19, 1977- São Paulo, (Estadio Morumbi)-Brazil 3-Poland 1\n\nJune 23, 1977- Rio de Janeiro, (Estádio do Maracanã)-Brazil 2-Scotland 0\n\nJune 26, 1977- Belo Horizonte, (Estádio Mineirão)-Brazil 0-Yugoslavia 0\n\nJune 26, 1977- Buenos Aires, (La Bombonera)-Argentina 0-France 0\n\nJune 30, 1977- Rio de Janeiro, (Estádio do Maracanã)-Brazil 2-France 2\n\nJuly 3, 1977- Belo Horizonte, (Estádio Mineirão)- Atlético Mineiro- (Brazil) 3-France 1\n\nJuly 3, 1977- Buenos Aires, (La Bombonera)-Argentina 1-Yugoslavia 0\n\nJuly 12, 1977- Buenos Aires, (La Bombonera)-Argentina 2-East Germany 0\n\n↧\n\nNew Addition: Guest Contribution, Part One\n\nA new Addition to the blog, where contributors submit articles on soccer related topics\n\nBy Beth Kelly from Chicago, IL\n\nTwitter: @bkelly_88\n\nWhat Next for Manchester City?\n\nManchester City fans have been on a roller coaster ride since Sheikh Mansour took control of the club in 2008. An owner with unlimited resources and a rapacious appetite for success was just what the doctor ordered for the blue side of Manchester, and the £33 million signing of Robinho made it clear that the Sheikh was happy to dip into his deep pockets. A spending spree followed that was unlike anything that had ever been witnessed in the English game, and the 2011 F.A. Cup final saw the Sky Blues lift their first silverware since 1976.\n\nThe joy of City fans only intensified the following year as the side clinched their first title since the 1960s on the last day of the 2011-12 Premier League season. Adding to their exhilaration was the bonus that Sergio Agüero’s injury time winner against QPR had dashed the cup from the lips of their crosstown nemesis. United were on the field at Sunderland celebrating their twentieth championship when news came through that the Argentine had scored.\n\nOne could be forgiven for thinking that City fans must be pinching themselves to make sure that they are not dreaming, but rumblings of discontent are starting to be heard around the Etihad. Mansour has spent over a billion pounds assembling a squad to challenge Europe’s best, but some experts feel that the team will require a complete makeover in the coming seasons. The problem is age, and many of Manchester City’s most important players will soon be on the wrong side of 30. The team is built around its formidable spine, but Vincent HYPERLINK \"http://www.espnfc.com/barclays-premier-league/story/2391390/man-city-captain-vincent-kompany-may-miss-man-united-derby-clash\"Kompany, Yaya HYPERLINK \"https://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/blogs/pitchside-europe/should-manchester-city-drop--uninterested--yaya-toure-for-the-manchester-derby-095229168.html\"Toure and David Silva will all have to be replaced in coming transfer windows.\n\nWhile that may not seem like much of a problem for a team with unlimited funds, UEFA’s financial fair play rules have changed the way that clubs can spend. Teams must now spend within their means, and club revenues limit the amount that wealthy owners can throw around. City have raised eyebrows with sponsorship deals from companies associated with the Sheikh that make little financial sense, and UEFA’s president Michel Platini is on record as saying that such deals will be closely scrutinized in the future. City have already seen the size of their Champions League squad reduced because of FFP violations, and continued noncompliance could see the side banned from the tournament completely.\n\nAdding to the challenge facing City is the financial muscle of their main competitors. Paul Pogba is seen by many as the heir apparent to Yaya Toure, but clubs with far higher revenues like Manchester United and Real Madrid have also been linked with the Juventus star. Outrageous wages have been the tool used by City to lure top signings away from their more glamorous competitors, but paying top dollar for talent has not always proved successful. The club spent $25 million to bring Emmanuel HYPERLINK \"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/mar/16/emmanuel-adebayor-tottenham-spurs-premier-league\"Adebayor in from Arsenal in 2009, but his reported wages of £170 thousand per week made the Togolese striker difficult to move on when his on field performances failed to live up to his paycheck.\n\nThe biggest challenge facing City is their perceived lack of pedigree compared to the European football elite. Top players will often take less money if it means that they can line up for Bayern Munich or Barcelona, but Manchester City do not have that type of allure. The club has taken steps to address this, and enormous investment has been made on facilities designed to develop and nurture young players. However, none of these players look likely to break into the first team anytime soon.\n\nManchester City have attracted a great many American fans in recent years, and NBC Premier League or Dish Latino packages mean that these new fans can watch any EPL game involving the Sky Blues. However, City fans in the United States and elsewhere must be wondering if the FFP rules will send their roller coaster plummeting once more.\n\n↧\n\nOld Team Photographs-Part 28d\n\nPhoto From:
