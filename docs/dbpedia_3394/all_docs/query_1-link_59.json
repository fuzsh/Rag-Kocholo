        "text": "Senegal on Tuesday became the first African country to qualify for the round of 16 knockout stage in the on-going World Cup, Qatar 2022.\n\nThe francophone African country defeated Ecuador 2-1 at the Khalifa International Stadium, Qatar, to book a place in the round of 16.\n\nIsmaila Sarr fired the opener for Senegal with a penalty in the 44th-minute, and Kalidou Koulibaly sealed the game with his beautiful finish in the 70th.\n\nEcuador would have advanced with a win or a draw. Senegal, however, made sure the South American country took no point from the game and advanced with their win.\n\nREAD: Qatar 2022: Riots break out in Belgium after loss to Morocco\n\nIn February, Senegal’s coach, Aliou Cissé, became the first manager to lead Senegal to the Africa Cup of Nations title.\n\nTuesday, he also became the first Senegal manager, since Bruno Metsu in 2002, to make the World Cup round of 16. Cissé was the Senegalese captain back in 2002, when the Lions qualified for their first World Cup quarter-final.\n\nSenegal finished second in Group A with six points behind Netherlands with seven points."
