You’ll also find out more about being a scientist, how robots work and which creatures live in the sea. We’ve found you poems about people, poems to make you laugh and poems to perform. In all the units, there are texts for you to read, enjoy and talk about, as well as the chance to write your own versions and think of your own ideas. English can be great fun as you learn to get better at:\n\n• sharing your thoughts and ideas with your partners • reading and sharing new stories, poems and ideas\n\nSA M\n\n• writing down your ideas.\n\nDuring the units, you will be asked to think about what you have done or learned. You will also be asked to discuss how you learned so that you can become an even better learner. At the end of each unit, there are ideas for projects that will help you to join together all the different areas of English.
