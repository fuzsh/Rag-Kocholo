Memorable European Confrontations, Part 16-1984 Real Madrid vs. Anderlecht

Real Madrid and Anderlecht were paired in the Third Round of the 1984/85 UEFA Cup.

The Spanish Real Madrid, managed by Amaro Amancio, boasted such Spanish stars like Camacho, Gallego, Santillana, as well as foreign stars such as West Germany’s Uli Stielieke, and new Argentine signing Jorge Valdano.

More importantly a new group of youngsters from the Castilla nursery soon to be known as ‘El Quinta del Buitre’ were now part of the first team.

These included Emilio Butragueno (‘El Buitre’), as well as Michel , Sanchis and Rafael Martin Vazquez.

They had qualified with some difficulty from their opening two Rounds. While SSW Innsbruck was eliminated with ease, the Yugoslavians of Rijeka had been a tougher test, and after losing (1-3) away, Madrid had overcome the deficit at home (3-0).

They were lagging behind in the League to Barcelona and in general were having one of their worst domestic seasons in nearly a decade.

On the other hand, The Belgians of Anderlecht, winners in 1983 and finalists the previous season of this competition were riding high domestically and in Europe.

They were still unbeaten in League play and were well on their way to reclaim their League crown last won in 1981.

The Manager was former star Paul van Himst, who would go on to manage the National team.

The team was spearheaded by led by skipper Frank Vercauteren and new 18-year-old star Enzo Scifo.

The Belgian contingent included Internationals such as Erwin vandenbergh, Rene vandereycken, Alex Czerniatinski and George Grun.

The foreigners on their books were Danish stars such as Morten Olsen and Frank Arnesen and Yugoslav defender Luka Peruzovic.

They had been impressive in the competition up to that point; having eliminated West Germany’s Werder Bremen and had hammered Italy’s Fiorentina (1-1 away and 6-2 at home).

The first leg, on November 28th, was played in Brussels’ Parc Astrid Stadium.

Anderlecht were in more confident mood and Real Madrid played their usual poor away game.

Anderlecht were missing the experienced midfielder Rene vandereycken, otherwise were in full strength.

Amancio had deprived his team of the attacking talents of the experienced Juanito (suspended by Real Madrid themselves) as well as former Anderlecht star Juan Lozano.

Frimann’s entry in the second half enabled Vercauteren to have more control of the match and within minutes the goals came.

After constant pressure, Anderlecht finally scored in the 66th minute by vandenbergh and the floodgates were opened. Per Frimann after a one-two with Scifo at the center sent vandenbergh through and he beat Miguel Angel with a low shot.

Just two minutes after a quick counter attack, the ball reached Vercauteren on the left side side touchline who sent in a cross in the goalmouth for Alex Czerniatisnki to head home.

Czerniatinski was immediately booked for over celebration.

Frank Vercauteren rounded out the scoring in the 85th minute from the spot after a penalty kick was awarded when Chendo brought down Alex Czerniatisnki.

Vercauteren, whose father had passed away a few days before the match, became the Belgian record holder of European matches by playing his 59th match surpassing his current Manager van Himst.

The second leg, on December 7th, was played at Madrid’s Estadio Santiago Bernabeu.

Real Madrid started with former Anderlecht star Juan Lozano and Emilio Butragueno starting upfront, with San Jose replacing Chendo in defense.

Anderlecht sacrificed one striker (vandenbergh) to bring in an extra midfielder (Per Frimann) and had only Czerniatisnki upfront and still missing Rene vandereycken.

Anderlecht believed they had all but qualified and their overconfidence was their undoing as Real Madrid achieved one of its most European comebacks that it would become known for in the coming years.

Real Madrid scored their six goals in the first 50 minutes as they attacked relentlessly and without mercy.

Enzo Scifo admitted afterwards that they had it so easy in the League and in Europe from the beginning of the season that they believed they just needed to show up to qualify.

An anonymous Real Madrid player later said that the Spaniards had expected to meet a team that would defend every portion of the field instead they met a team that behaved like sheep.

Morten Olsen later remarked that they should have marked Juan Lozano out of the game instead they allowed him total freedom.

Real opened the scoring in the third minute when a free kick from the right by Lozano from the left was headed in by Sanchis.

For the second goal in the 16th minute, Emilio Butragueno headed in a cross from Valdano from the right side.

For the third goal in the 29th minute, Gallego sent Emilio Butragueno clear on the right side who immediately passed across for Valdano to stab home in an empty net.

Anderlecht pulled a goal back in the 34th minute, when Frimann scored after a scramble in the goalmouth.

For Real’s fourth goal in the 39th minute was similar to their third goal, with Gallego sending Butragueno clear on the right and he crossed for Valdano to score.

For Real’s fifth in the 47th minute, Camacho crossed from the left that was pushed back by the Anderlecht defense into the path of Butragueno who scored.

For the final goal in the 50th minute, a cross from the left reached Butragueno who after a scramble scored.

Real Madrid qualified and went on to win the UEFA Cup in May by defeating Hungary’s Videoton.

Anderlecht did go on and win their League title.

Transfers that did not happen, Part Seven

1- Internazionale Milano tried to sign West Germany’s Uwe Seeler in 1961. Seeler revealed that Inter had offered him a 200,000 British Pounds signing on fee and a Villa and a car.

However, he was reluctant to be tied to Inter contractually for a substantial amount of time, therefore he asked that he be granted a 150,000 British Pounds payoff at the end of three years and a free transfer back to West Germany.

This broke the deal as Inter found this too demanding.

(Uwe Seeler, July 23, 1966, World Cup, West Germany 4-Uruguay 0)

2- Russian striker Oleg Salenko, who was the joint top goalscorer of 1994 World Cup, had signed for Tottenham Hotspur from Dinamo Kiev in January 1993. However, the deal was cancelled after he was not able to obtain a work permit from the British Government.

The rule at the time was that foreign player (not from the European Community) should at least played in 75% of their respective national team’s matches from the previous two years to be considered and Salenko did not meet the quota.

Bayern turned instead to Italian Giovanni Trapattoni.

Finally, Ferguson opted to sign Eric Cantona instead in November of 1992.

Events and Consequences, Part Seven

1- Event:

France’s Albert Parsys, Charles Dujardin, Maurice Bigue, Lucien Gamblin and Auguste Schalbart refusing an International call-up in 1914 for a match vs. Luxembourg on February 8, 1914 (Luxembourg 5 to 4 win).

Some had boycotted the call up under the pretext that they had to pay their own train fare for France’s previous match vs. Belgium on January 25, 1914 at Lille (4 to 3 France win).

Consequence:

The French authorities suspended the players for 15 days.

This incident forced the Federation to enact a ruling that made it obligatory to honour selections under threat of suspension.

(Renzo de Vecchi and Lucien Gamblin, February 20, 1921, France 1-Italy 2 )

2- Event:

German Captain Lothar Matthaus serious injury in December 1994.

Consequence:

Matthaus had established himself as Germany’s libero. The injury forced him to miss the rest of the season. In his absence Germany manager Berti Vogts installed Borussia Dortmund’s Matthias Sammer as his new libero.

Sammer performed so well that Vogts decided to keep faith with the younger Sammer even after Matthaus was back from injury.

For a while this seemed to have excluded Matthaus from the National team permanently.

However, Matthaus was recalled by 1998 after Sammer himself had to retire prematurely due to injury.

3- Event:

Brazil’s loss vs. Uruguay in the Final of the 1950 World Cup at Maracana on July 16, 1950.

Consequence:

Brazil’s goalkeeper Moacir Barbosa was forever established as the scapegoat and lived a virtually ostracized life in poverty.

He passed away on April 7, 2000.

In an interview he remarked that under Brazilian Law the maximum imprisonment penalty is 30 years but he has been paying for nearly 50 years for his mistake.

4- Event:

Five Scotland players led by skipper Billy Bremner breaking a 1 AM Curfew and being thrown out of a Copenhagen nightclub for drunken behavior, following Scotland’s victory (1 to 0) vs. Denmark on September 3, 1975 in a European Championship Qualifying match.

Consequence:

The five players in question were Bremner along with Willie Young, Joe Harper, Pat McCluskey and Arthur Graham.

A Scottish official witnessed a drunken Bremner and McCluskey trying to turn a bed upside down as a prank.

As a punishment all five players received life suspensions, though it was later overturned in the following years.

In any case this ended Billy Bremner ‘s international career.

5- Event:

France’s European Championship qualifier at Bucharest vs. Romania on October 11, 1995.

Consequence:

This match was later described by experts/observers/players/etc as the pivotal turning point in the birth of the golden age of the French national team of late 90’s and early 2000’s.

The French refer to this match as the birth of the ‘Zidane Genration’.

France, under Aime Jacquet, had to win to have any chance to qualify for the 1996 Euros in England and an away match vs. group leaders Romania seemed a daunting task.

France won this match 3 to 1 and this paved the way to qualification.

Zidane scored one of the goals, along with partner Youri Djorkaeff, and established himself as the playmaker of this generation.

The backbone of the future France squad was established with players such as Karembeu, Lizarazu, Dugarry, Djorkaeff and veterans such as Didier Deschamps and Marcel Desailly.

Goalkeeper Fabien Barthez even took part in this match, deputizing for the unavailable starter Bernard Lama.

Short International Careers, Part Five

1- Stefano Borgonovo

Italian Stefano Borgonovo’s best season was during the 1988/89 where he was on loan at Fiorentina from AC Milan. That season he formed a prolific striking partnership with Roberto Baggio that enabled both of them to be called up for the National team.

Borgonovo earned his three caps within a month in February and March of 1989. (February 22, 1989, Italy 1-Denmark 0 / March 25, 1989, Austria 0-Italy 1 and March 29, 2989, Romania 1-Italy 0).

For the first two matches he came on as substitute replacing strikers Gianluca Vialli and Aldo Serena respectively. He played the entire match vs. Romania.

He returned to AC Milan, but did not recapture his previous form and was never selected again.

He sadly passed away on June 27, 2013 from Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.

3- John Fashanu

For his first cap on May 23, 1989 vs. Chile on Wembley (scoreless tie), Fashanu was replaced by Tony Cottee in the 70th minute.

For his second cap on May 27, 1989 vs. Scotland at Glasgow (2 to 0 win) , he was replaced in the 31st minute by Steve Bull.

5- Willy van der Kuylen/Jan van Beveren and Johann Cruyff

On at least two separate occasions PSV Eindhoven pair of goalkeeper Jan van Beveren and Forward Willy van der Kuylen withdrew from the Dutch national team because of their differences with Johann Cruyff.

Piet Schrijvers and Frans Thijssen had to be called up as replacements.

Then prior to the European Championship semifinal vs. Czechoslovakia on June 16, 1976 (1 to 3 Czech win), Jan van Beveren and Willy van der Kuylen withdrew the squad because they felt that Johan Cruyff wielded too much influence.

Debate Topic, Part Eight

Topic

It has been said that Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo have both excelled beyond most people’s expectations because each one pushed the other in a positive way to achieve greater heights.

Bearing that in mind, do you believe that if Diego Maradona had a worthy adversary, would he have achieved even more and/or would he have been forced to train in a more professional and disciplined environment?

New Addition: Error in Casting, Part one

They were supposed to be very good transfers or coaching appointments on paper, but somehow fared well below expectations

1- Franz Beckenbauer and Olympique Marseille, 1990

With the French League season well under way and with big spenders Olympique Marseille seemingly running away with the League title, it was a surprise when Club President Bernard Tapie coaxed the recent World Cup winning World Cup manager to replace Double title winning Manager Gerard Gili.

Tapie seemed to think Beckenbauer was the man to guide OM to European glory.

However, with Beckenbauer in charge, OM actually lost its form and started losing matches to such a point that he was nicknamed ‘Mr. 50 Percent’.

Finally, Tapie rectified the problem by moving Beckenbauer upstairs as Technical director and appointing Belgian Veteran Manager Raymond Goethals as Manager.

2- Andreas Brehme at Real Zaragoza, 1992

German defender Andreas Brehme departed Internazionale Milano after four years of good service to pre-retirement in the less pressured atmosphere of Real Zaragoza.

However, this adventure turned sour after he clashed with young Manager Victor Fernandez.

The following season he returned to his first love Kaiserslautern.

3- Steve Hodge and Leeds United, 1991

England National team midfielder Steve Hodge joined ambitious Leeds United in 1991 from Nottingham Forest after he had lost his place.

4- Geovani and Bologna, 1989

Brazil’s captian during the 1988 Seoul Olympics, Geovani was being billed as the next Brazilian superstar.

He was transferred to Bologna in 1989, however, before his Serie A career had started, he had lost his place in Brazil’s squad midway through the 1989 Copa America.

His Serie A season was just as unsatisfactory as he lost his place there as well.

5- Mark Hughes and Barcelona, 1986

There was much excitement when Terry Venables signed the British duo of Welshman Mark Hughes and Englishman Gary Lineker.

While Lineker slowly caught up with the Spanish game and started scoring goals, his partner Hughes struggled to such a point that he was dropped towards the end of the season and replaced in the squad by Scotsman Steve Archibald who had been put on ice.

The follwing season he was loaned to Bayern Munich, before making his way back to his original club Manchester United.
