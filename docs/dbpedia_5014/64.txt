Hrvatska radiotelevizija (abbr. HRT), or Croatian Radiotelevision, is Croatia's public broadcasting company. It operates several radio and television channels, over a domestic transmitter network as well as satellite. HRT is divided into three joint companies â€“ Croatian Radio (Hrvatski radio), Croatian Television (Hrvatska televizija) and Music Production (Glazbena proizvodnja), which includes three orchestras (Symphony, Jazz, and Tamburitza) and a choir.

The founder of HRT is the Republic of Croatia which exercises its founder's rights through the Croatian Government. Croatian Radio (then Radio Zagreb) was founded on 15 May 1926. This date is considered the date on which HRT was founded. Television Zagreb (today Croatian Television) began broadcasting on 7 September 1956. By the law enacted by the Croatian Parliament on 29 June 1990, Radio Television Zagreb was renamed to Croatian Radiotelevision.

HRT operates as a provider of public broadcasting services, and Croatia provides independent funding by the Croatian Broadcasting Company Law and the State Aid Rules for Public Broadcasting Services. In carrying out its activities, HRT is independent of any political influence and commercial interest.

On 25 May 2012, HRT's archive of the television and radio program and its collection of musical production was given the status of Croatian cultural heritage.
