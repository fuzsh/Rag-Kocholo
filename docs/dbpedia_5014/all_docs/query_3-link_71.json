        "text": "4. James Clerk Maxwell\n\nSource; Wikipedia\n\nJames Clerk Maxwell was a Scottish mathematical physicist who is considered one of the most influential scientists of the 19th century.\n\nHis estimated IQ scores range from 190 to 205 by different measures. James’s work on electromagnetism laid the foundation for our understanding of radio waves, microwaves, and light.\n\nMaxwell developed a set of four equations that describe the behaviour of electric and magnetic fields. These equations are known as Maxwell's equations, and they are one of the most important equations in physics.\n\nMaxwell's equations predicted the existence of electromagnetic waves, which are waves that travel through space at the speed of light.\n\nElectromagnetic waves include radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays, and gamma rays.\n\nMaxwell's work on electromagnetism has had a profound impact on our understanding of the universe.\n\nElectromagnetic waves are used in a wide variety of technologies, including radio, television, radar, microwave ovens, lasers, and medical imaging devices.\n\nIn addition to his work on electromagnetism, Maxwell also made significant contributions to other areas of physics, including thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, and the kinetic theory of gases.\n\nMaxwell was a brilliant and visionary scientist. His work has had a profound impact on our understanding of the universe and the development of modern technology.\n\n5. Nicolaus Copernicus\n\nSource: Wikisource\n\nNicolaus Copernicus was a Polish mathematician and astronomer who is considered one of the most important figures in the history of science. His IQ ranked from 160 to 200.\n\nHe is best known for his heliocentric model of the solar system, which placed the sun at the centre rather than the Earth.\n\nCopernicus's heliocentric model was a radical departure from the prevailing geocentric model, which had been the accepted view of the universe for centuries.\n\nThe geocentric model placed the Earth at the centre of the universe, with the sun and other planets orbiting around it.\n\nCopernicus's heliocentric model was based on his careful observations of the planets and stars. He noticed that the planets did not move in perfect circles around the Earth, as the geocentric model predicted. He also noticed that the speed of the planets varied as they orbited the sun.\n\nCopernicus concluded that the sun must be at the centre of the universe and that the planets orbit around it.\n\nHe published his heliocentric model in his book De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres) in 1543.\n\nCopernicus's heliocentric model was not immediately accepted by the scientific community. Many people found it difficult to accept that the Earth was not at the centre of the universe. However, over time, Copernicus's model gained acceptance, and it eventually replaced the geocentric model.\n\n6. William James Sidis\n\nSource: IMDb\n\nWilliam James Sidis was an American child prodigy with an estimated IQ of 200-300, making him one of the most intelligent people ever recorded.\n\nHe was able to read the New York Times by the age of two, and by the time he was six, he spoke eight languages, including English, Latin, French, German, Russian, Hebrew, Turkish, and Armenian.\n\nSidis was accepted to Harvard University at the age of nine, but the university refused to enrol him until he was 11, out of concern for his maturity.\n\nEven so, Sidis quickly distinguished himself at Harvard, excelling in mathematics and philosophy. He was also a gifted musician and composer.\n\nAfter graduating from Harvard at the age of 16, Sidis went on to study at Columbia University. However, he became increasingly disillusioned with academia and society as a whole.\n\nHe withdrew from public life and worked a variety of odd jobs, including as a waiter and a factory worker.\n\nSidis's life was marked by both brilliance and tragedy. He was a brilliant mathematician and philosopher, but he also struggled to cope with the pressures of fame and expectations. He died in poverty and obscurity in 1944 at the age of 46.\n\n7. Carl Friedrich Gauss\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nCarl Friedrich Gauss was a German mathematician who is widely considered to be the greatest mathematician of all time. He had an IQ of 250 to 300\n\nHe made significant contributions to many areas of mathematics, including number theory, algebra, statistics, and analysis.\n\nGauss was a child prodigy. He could do complex math problems in his head at a very young age. At the age of 11, he discovered a method for calculating the sum of all the positive integers from 1 to 100.\n\nThis method, now known as Gauss's circle method, is still taught in schools today. Gauss made many important contributions to number theory.\n\nHe proved the fundamental theorem of algebra, which states that every polynomial with complex coefficients has at least one complex root. He also developed new methods for solving quadratic and cubic equations\n\n8. Nikola Tesla\n\nSource: OCD-UK\n\nNikola Tesla was a Serbian-American inventor and electrical engineer who is considered one of the most important figures in the history of electricity.\n\nHe was born in 1856 in Smiljan, Austria-Hungary (now Croatia), and emigrated to the United States in 1884. Tesla had a brilliant mind and had an IQ range from 160 to 310.\n\nHe made many important contributions to the field of electricity, including the development of alternating current (AC) electricity, which is the standard form of electricity used today.\n\nTesla also invented the Tesla coil, a device that generates high-voltage, low-current electricity.\n\nTesla's work on AC electricity was revolutionary.\n\nAt the time, direct current (DC) electricity was the dominant form of electricity, but Tesla argued that AC electricity was superior because it could be transmitted over long distances more efficiently. Tesla's AC system eventually won out, and it is now used all over the world.\n\nTesla's Tesla coil is another one of his most famous inventions. It is a device that generates high-voltage, low-current electricity.\n\nTesla coils are often used in science fiction movies and television shows, but they have also been used in some practical applications, such as wireless power transmission.\n\nTesla was a prolific inventor and held over 300 patents. He also had many visionary ideas about the future of technology, including the possibility of wireless communication and free energy.\n\n9. Francois Marie Arouet (Voltaire)\n\nSource: History and Biography\n\nFrancois Marie Arouet, better known by his pen name Voltaire was a towering figure in the French Enlightenment, a period of intellectual ferment and social reform that spanned the 18th century.\n\nHe was a prolific writer and philosopher, producing works in a wide range of genres, including essays, plays, poems, and novels.\n\nVoltaire's satire was his most powerful weapon against the French government and aristocracy. He used irony, sarcasm, and hyperbole to expose the hypocrisy, corruption, and injustice of the ancient régime.\n\nHis most famous satirical work is the novel Candide, which tells the story of a young man who travels the world and learns that life is not always as rosy as it seems.\n\nVoltaire's IQ of 190-200 is estimated based on his writings and other historical evidence. He was a brilliant thinker with a deep understanding of philosophy, history, and science. He was also a master of language and rhetoric.\n\n10. Christopher Hirata\n\nSource: The Lantern\n\nChristopher Hirata is one of the most brilliant astrophysicists of our time. He has made significant contributions to our understanding of the early universe, dark matter, and dark energy.\n\nHis work has been published in some of the most prestigious scientific journals, and he has received numerous awards for his research.\n\nHirata's IQ is estimated to be 225, which would place him in the top 0.001% of the population. This level of intelligence is truly exceptional, and it is no surprise that Hirata has been able to achieve such great things in astrophysics.\n\nHirata's most notable achievements include his work on the cosmic microwave background (CMB).\n\nThe CMB is the leftover radiation from the Big Bang, and it contains a wealth of information about the early universe.\n\nHirata has used the CMB to study the formation of the first stars and galaxies, and he has also used it to measure the properties of dark matter and dark energy.\n\nHirata has also made significant contributions to the study of gravitational lensing. Gravitational lensing is the phenomenon where light from distant objects is bent by the gravity of intervening objects.\n\nHirata has used gravitational lensing to study the structure of the universe on large scales, and he has also used it to search for dark matter.\n\n11. Terence Tao\n\nSource: UCLA Newsroom\n\nTerence Tao is one of the most brilliant mathematicians of our time. He has made significant contributions to a wide range of mathematical fields, including number theory, harmonic analysis, and partial differential equations.\n\nHis work has had a profound impact on our understanding of these fields, and he is considered to be one of the leading mathematicians in the world.\n\nTao's IQ is estimated to be between 211 and 230, which would place him in the top 0.01% of the population.\n\nThis level of intelligence is truly exceptional, and it is no surprise that Tao has been able to achieve such great things in mathematics.\n\nTao's most notable achievements include his work on the Green-Tao theorem, which states that there are arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions of prime numbers.\n\nHe also made significant contributions to the study of the Navier-Stokes equations, which are a set of partial differential equations that describe the motion of fluids.\n\nTao has been awarded numerous awards for his work, including the Fields Medal, the most prestigious award in mathematics.\n\nHe is also a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\n\nREAD| Top 10 Republican Presidential Candidates 2024"
