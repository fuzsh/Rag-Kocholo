        "text": "The Croatian Radiotelevision Tamburitza Orchestra is a unique instrumental ensemble founded in 1941 as a professional orchestra of Zagreb Radio. Since its founding, the orchestra has presented traditional Croatian music on Croatian Radio and Television, as well as at many concerts and festivals throughout Europe and has exhibited great care for the folk tradition.\n\nIn addition, a considerable part of the ensemble’s repertoire consists of works by 19th and 20th century Croatian composers such as Pajo Kolaric, Emil Cossetto, and Bozo Potocnik among many others, who have taken the four-stringed tambura beyond its traditional role in folk music and explored the rich possibilities of its use as a contemporary instrument. The orchestra’s repertoire has expanded over the years to encompass diverse musical genres, ranging from folk to classical music to jazz.\n\nThe orchestra has released several albums and has recorded over 10,000 folk songs, dances, and composed works that are archived in the Croatian Radio and Television library. They have also played with many renowned vocal and instrumental soloists and have been under the direction of Siniša Leopold since 1985.\n\nDiscography:\n\n7 decades 1941 – 2011 : Croatian Composers in the Tamburitza Ambiance"
