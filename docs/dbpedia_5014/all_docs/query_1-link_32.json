        "text": "In Croatia, network operator OIV has a project underway to improve national FM radio infrastructure for public broadcaster HRT, Croatian Radiotelevision.\n\nManufacturer GatesAir reports that OIV has equipped five transmission facilities with GatesAir Flexiva FAX air-cooled radio transmission systems, including sites near the capital Zagreb and the towns of Rijeka, Dubrovnik and Makarska. Each location has four or five Flexiva FAX transmitters in redundant 3+1 or 4+1 configurations, in power levels ranging from 5 to 10 kW. It said OIV plans more upgrades including an installation near Split next year.\n\n“As HRT’s network operator, OIV manages transmission systems for three national HRT FM radio programs and eight regional HRT programs targeting specific regions,” GatesAir said in its announcement.\n\n“The previous transmitter fleet, which consisted of transmitters up to 20 years old, began showing signs of age in recent years. Furthermore, some of the vendors were no longer in business, making spare parts hard to procure.”\n\n[See Our Who’s Buying What Page]\n\nSmart AudioVisual d.o.o. represented GatesAir locally and handled logistics including transport of the transmitters. Smart-AV will handle maintenance, service and procurement of any spare parts needed.\n\nGatesAir said that saving on energy costs was an important part of OIV’s decision. It quoted Bruno Cigrovski, head of Radio Network Department for OIV, saying the installation of a 10 kW transmitter in Rijeka is saving 1500 Euros monthly.\n\nGatesAir was recently acquired by Thomson Broadcast."
