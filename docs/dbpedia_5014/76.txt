The Croatian Government adopted the final draft of the new Law on Hrvatska Radiotelevizija (Croatian RadioTelevision - HRT) on 23 January 2003 and passed it to the Croatian Parliament (regarding the description of the organisational structures see in detail IRIS 2003-1: 10).

HRT will be obliged to fill its programming with more than 55% of documentaries and other programmes in the Croatian language, while at least 50% of the remaining programme material must be of European origin. HRT shall also receive at least 10% of the total broadcast television programme from independent producers. The amount of advertising spots in any HRT programme shall not exceed 9 minutes within a one-hour period, while two or more advertising spots («advertising block») shall be broadcast uninterruptedly only between programmes. HTV shall not interrupt feature films with advertisements. Every household owning radio and TV receivers in the Republic of Croatia shall be obliged to pay a licence fee to the HRT amounting to 1.5 % of the average Croatian Radiotelevision monthly net salary of the employees in the Republic of Croatia, calculated on the basis of the statistical data for HRT the previous year. Out of the overall licence fee, 3% should be entrusted to the Fund for the stipulation of pluralism and diversity of media founded by this Law, which shall allocate the financial means according to its special legal basis which is to be enshrined in law.

The Law on Croatian Radio Television is expected to be passed in the second week of February, and within 15 days of its enactment the existing HRT Council should make a public announcement for the election of the new Council members. In the transition period the current HRT General Manager will act as interim HRT General Manager with full authority according to the new law and will appoint interim managers and editors to senior positions.
