BBC Worldwide is delighted to announce it has awarded the Master Toy Licence for the hugely successful Impossible Pictures series Primeval to Character Options, the trading subsidiary of The Character Group plc.

Since its appointment by Impossible as the programme’s international distributor and merchandising agent , BBC Worldwide has secured television sales for the Primeval series in 20 territories, with further deals still to be announced.

Richard Hollis, BBC Head of UK Licensing, said: “Character's ability at modelling and marketing monstrous creatures using amazing technology makes them the ideal partner for us on Primeval and we are delighted to have the opportunity to work with Impossible Pictures on this exciting series.’

Primeval, an Impossible Pictures production for ITV, ProSieben and M6, is a science fiction drama, which has been renewed for a second series in 2008, and follows a team of scientists battling terrifying prehistoric creatures that are slipping into the modern world through anomalies in time.

Character Options is one of the UK’s largest toy companies and has enjoyed immense success alongside BBC Worldwide through a Doctor Who range of products, winning a number of awards and selling well over 1.7 million figures last year alone.

The first series of Primeval which started earlier this year, achieved an average rating of almost 6.5 million viewers for each of the first six episodes and this success is expected to continue in 2008.

Jon Diver, Joint Managing Director at Character Group, added: “We are delighted to have been awarded the Master licence for the toys relating to this successful series for which, the ratings speak for themselves, reflecting the show’s success as great Saturday night family viewing.

“We will be producing an extensive line of exciting products that will include a Dragonfly Rex and Agnurognathus which will be available from this October and will be TV advertised, followed by a number of other action figures and creatures from series one and two being released in January 2008.”
