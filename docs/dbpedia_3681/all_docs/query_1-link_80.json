        "text": "Detecting Circumstellar ``Hydrogen Wall'' Emission Around a Nearby, Sun-like Star\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWood, Brian\n\n1999-07-01\n\nUsing the long-slit spectroscopy capabilities of STIS, we propose to try to detect for the first time nebular Lyman- Alpha emission surrounding a Sun-like star produced by the interaction of its stellar wind with the ISM. Such ``hydrogen walls'' have likely been detected in absorption around the Sun and several other nearby stars using GHRS Lyman-Alpha spectra. However, most of these detections are tentative due to the difficulty in separating the H-wall absorption from the interstellar H I absorption. Furthermore, even if one accepts the reality of the detected hot H I absorption components, it is impossible to prove that circumstellar material is in fact responsible. We propose to circumvent these difficulties by detecting a hydrogen wall in emission around 40 Eri A, which is one of the stars for which a tentative H-wall detection already exists. A successful detection of the expected circumstellar emission would validate the previous Lyman-Alpha aborption line studies, a nd the combined spectroscopic and spatial information provided by long-slit spectroscopy would contribute valuable new information on the stellar wind of 40 Eri A and how it interacts with the ISM, especially when compared with models that we will construct of 40 Eri A's ``astrosphere.'' This new information includes a direct measurement of the distance to the stellar bow shock, information that we do not possess for any other nearby star, including the Sun.\n\nGravitational Waves from Stellar Black Hole Binaries and the Impact on Nearby Sun-like Stars\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nLopes, IlÃ­dio; Silk, Joseph, E-mail: ilidio.lopes@tecnico.ulisboa.pt, E-mail: silk@astro.ox.ac.uk\n\nWe investigate the impact of resonant gravitational waves on quadrupole acoustic modes of Sun-like stars located nearby stellar black hole binary systems (such as GW150914 and GW151226). We find that the stimulation of the low-overtone modes by gravitational radiation can lead to sizeable photometric amplitude variations, much larger than the predictions for amplitudes driven by turbulent convection, which in turn are consistent with the photometric amplitudes observed in most Sun-like stars. For accurate stellar evolution models, using up-to-date stellar physics, we predict photometric amplitude variations of 1â10{sup 3} ppm for a solar mass star located at a distance between 1moreÂ Â» au and 10 au from the black hole binary and belonging to the same multi-star system. The observation of such a phenomenon will be within the reach of the Plato mission because the telescope will observe several portions of the Milky Way, many of which are regions of high stellar density with a substantial mixed population of Sun-like stars and black hole binaries.Â«Â less\n\nYoung Nearby Suns and Stellar Jitter Dependence on Age\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCabrera, Nicole; White, Russel; Delfosse, Xavier; Noah Quinn, Samuel; Latham, David W.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nFinding the nearest young planets offers the most direct way to improve our understanding of how planets form, how they migrate, and how they evolve. However, most radial velocity (RV) surveys have avoided young stars because of their problematic characteristics, including high levels of stellar activity. Recent advancements in infrared (IR) detectors as well as wavelength calibration methods have provided new ways of pursuing high-precision RV measurements of young stars. While this work has been successfully applied to many young late-K and M dwarfs, much less RV work has been done on young Sun-like stars, with the very recent exception of adolescent stars (~600 Myr) in open clusters. In order to better understand the dynamical and structural forces that shaped our own Solar system, we must begin to explore the more massive realm of Sun-like stars.We present precision optical radial velocity data of 5 young, nearby, Sun-like stars in AB Dor and assess our ability to detect young planets with current spectroscopic methods. The data were obtained with the TRES spectrograph on the 1.5-m Tillinghast Reflector at the Fred L. Whipple Observatory and with SOPHIE on the 1.95 m Telescope at the Observatoire de Haute Provence. We obtained a RV precision of ~8 m/s with TRES and ~7 m/s precision with SOPHIE; average observed dispersions are 38 m/s and 33 m/s, respectively. We combine our results with spectroscopic data of Sun-like stars spanning a broad range of youthful ages (< 1 Gyr) from the literature to investigate the relationship between stellar jitter and stellar age. The results suggest that the jitter of Sun-like stars decreases below 100 m/s for stars older than ~30 Myr, which would enable the discovery of hot Jupiters orbiting these adolescent age stars.\n\nPatterns of Variation for the Sun and Sun-like Stars\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRadick, Richard R.; Lockwood, G. Wesley; Henry, Gregory W.; Hall, Jeffrey C.; Pevtsov, Alexei A.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nWe compare patterns of variation for the Sun and 72 Sun-like stars by combining total and spectral solar irradiance measurements between 2003 and 2017 from the SORCE satellite, StrÃ¶mgren b, y stellar photometry between 1993 and 2017 from Fairborn Observatory, and solar and stellar chromospheric Ca II H+K emission observations between 1992 and 2016 from Lowell Observatory. The new data and their analysis strengthen the relationships found previously between chromospheric and brightness variability on the decadal timescale of the solar activity cycle. Both chromospheric H+K and photometric b, y variability among Sun-like stars are related to average chromospheric activity by power laws on this timescale. Young active stars become fainter as their H+K emission increases, and older, less active, more Sun-age stars tend to show a pattern of direct correlation between photometric and chromospheric emission variations. The directly correlated pattern between total solar irradiance and chromospheric Ca II emission variations shown by the Sun appears to extend also to variations in the StrÃ¶mgren b, y portion of the solar spectrum. Although the Sun does not differ strongly from its stellar age and spectral class mates in the activity and variability characteristics that we have now studied for over three decades, it may be somewhat unusual in two respects: (1) its comparatively smooth, regular activity cycle, and (2) its rather low photometric brightness variation relative to its chromospheric activity level and variation, perhaps indicating that facular emission and sunspot darkening are especially well-balanced on the Sun.\n\nDifferential Rotation in Sun-like Stars from Surface Variability and Asteroseismology\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNielsen, Martin Bo\n\n2017-03-01\n\nThe Sun and other stars are known to oscillate. Through the study of small perturbations to the frequencies of these oscillations the rotation of the deep interior can be inferred. However, thus far the internal rotation of other Sun-like stars is unknown. The NASA Kepler mission has observed a multitude of Sun-like stars over a period of four years. This has provided high-quality photometric data that can be used to study the rotation of stars with two different techniques: asteroseismology and surface activity. Asteroseismology provides a means of measuring rotation in the stellar interior, while photometric variability from magnetically active regions are sensitive to rotation at the stellar surface. The combination of these two methods can be used to constrain the radial differential rotation in Sun-like stars. First, we developed an automated method for measuring the rotation of stars using surface variability. This method was initially applied to the entire Kepler catalog, out of which we detected signatures of rotation in 12,000 stars across the main sequence, providing robust estimates of the surface rotation rates and the associated errors. Second, we performed an asteroseismic analysis of six Sun-like stars, where we were able to measure the rotational splitting as a function of frequency in the p-mode envelope. This was done by dividing the oscillation spectrum into individual segments, and fitting a model independently to each segment. We found that the measured splittings were all consistent with a constant value, indicating little differential rotation. Third, we compared the asteroseismic rotation rates of five Sun-like stars to their surface rotation rates. We found that the values were in good agreement, again indicating little differential rotation between the regions where the two methods are most sensitive. Finally, we discuss how the surface rotation rates may be used as a prior on the seismic envelope rotation rate in a double-zone model\n\nThe Colorful Demise of a Sun-like Star\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n2007-02-13\n\nThis image, taken by NASA Hubble Space Telescope, shows the colorful last hurrah of a star like our Sun. The star is ending its life by casting off its outer layers of gas, which formed a cocoon around the star remaining core.\n\nA Theoretical Probe for Excitation Mechanisms of Sun-like and Mira-like Oscillations of Stars\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nXiong, Da-run; Deng, Li-cai\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe linear nonadiabatic oscillations for evolutionary models of 0.6- 3M8 stars are calculated by using a nonlocal and time-dependent convection theory. The results show that in the HR diagram the pulsation-unstable low- temperature stars on the right side of instability strip can be divided into two groups. One group indicates the Sun-like oscillation stars composed of the main- sequence dwarfs, sub-giants and red giants (RGs) of low and intermediate lu- minosities, which are unstable in the intermediate- and high-order (n â¥ 12) p- modes, and stable in the low-order (n â¤ 5) p-modes. Another group indicates the Mira-like stars composed of the bright RGs and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, which are just contrary to Sun-like stars, unstable in low-order (n â¤ 5) p-modes and stable in the intermediate- and high-order (n â¥ 12) p-modes. The oscillations for the red edge of Cepheid (Î´ Scuti) instability strip, Sun-like and Mira-like stars can be explained uniformly by the coupling between convection and oscillation (CCO). For the low-temperature stars on the right side of in- stability strip, CCO is the dominant excitation and damping mechanism of the oscillations of low- and intermediate-order p-modes, and the turbulent stochas- tic excitation becomes important only for the high-order p-modes of Sun-like oscillations.\n\nIs life most likely around Sun-like stars?\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLingam, Manasvi; Loeb, Abraham\n\n2018-05-01\n\nWe consider the habitability of Earth-analogs around stars of different masses, which is regulated by the stellar lifetime, stellar wind-induced atmospheric erosion, and biologically active ultraviolet (UV) irradiance. By estimating the timescales associated with each of these processes, we show that they collectively impose limits on the habitability of Earth-analogs. We conclude that planets orbiting most M-dwarfs are not likely to host life, and that the highest probability of complex biospheres is for planets around K- and G-type stars. Our analysis suggests that the current existence of life near the Sun is slightly unusual, but not significantly anomalous.\n\nA rocky planet transiting a nearby low-mass star.\n\nPubMed\n\nBerta-Thompson, Zachory K; Irwin, Jonathan; Charbonneau, David; Newton, Elisabeth R; Dittmann, Jason A; Astudillo-Defru, Nicola; Bonfils, Xavier; Gillon, MichaÃ«l; Jehin, EmmanuÃ«l; Stark, Antony A; Stalder, Brian; Bouchy, Francois; Delfosse, Xavier; Forveille, Thierry; Lovis, Christophe; Mayor, Michel; Neves, Vasco; Pepe, Francesco; Santos, Nuno C; Udry, StÃ©phane; WÃ¼nsche, AnaÃ«l\n\n2015-11-12\n\nM-dwarf stars--hydrogen-burning stars that are smaller than 60 per cent of the size of the Sun--are the most common class of star in our Galaxy and outnumber Sun-like stars by a ratio of 12:1. Recent results have shown that M dwarfs host Earth-sized planets in great numbers: the average number of M-dwarf planets that are between 0.5 to 1.5 times the size of Earth is at least 1.4 per star. The nearest such planets known to transit their star are 39 parsecs away, too distant for detailed follow-up observations to measure the planetary masses or to study their atmospheres. Here we report observations of GJ 1132b, a planet with a size of 1.2 Earth radii that is transiting a small star 12 parsecs away. Our Doppler mass measurement of GJ 1132b yields a density consistent with an Earth-like bulk composition, similar to the compositions of the six known exoplanets with masses less than six times that of the Earth and precisely measured densities. Receiving 19 times more stellar radiation than the Earth, the planet is too hot to be habitable but is cool enough to support a substantial atmosphere, one that has probably been considerably depleted of hydrogen. Because the host star is nearby and only 21 per cent the radius of the Sun, existing and upcoming telescopes will be able to observe the composition and dynamics of the planetary atmosphere.\n\nSeismic constraints on rotation of Sun-like star and mass of exoplanet.\n\nPubMed\n\nGizon, Laurent; Ballot, JÃ©rome; Michel, Eric; Stahn, Thorsten; Vauclair, GÃ©rard; Bruntt, Hans; Quirion, Pierre-Olivier; Benomar, Othman; Vauclair, Sylvie; Appourchaux, Thierry; Auvergne, Michel; Baglin, Annie; Barban, Caroline; Baudin, FrÃ©deric; Bazot, MichaÃ«l; Campante, Tiago; Catala, Claude; Chaplin, William; Creevey, Orlagh; Deheuvels, SÃ©bastien; Dolez, NoÃ«l; Elsworth, Yvonne; GarcÃ­a, Rafael; Gaulme, Patrick; Mathis, StÃ©phane; Mathur, Savita; Mosser, BenoÃ®t; RÃ©gulo, Clara; Roxburgh, Ian; Salabert, David; Samadi, RÃ©za; Sato, Kumiko; Verner, Graham; Hanasoge, Shravan; Sreenivasan, Katepalli R\n\n2013-08-13\n\nRotation is thought to drive cyclic magnetic activity in the Sun and Sun-like stars. Stellar dynamos, however, are poorly understood owing to the scarcity of observations of rotation and magnetic fields in stars. Here, inferences are drawn on the internal rotation of a distant Sun-like star by studying its global modes of oscillation. We report asteroseismic constraints imposed on the rotation rate and the inclination of the spin axis of the Sun-like star HD 52265, a principal target observed by the CoRoT satellite that is known to host a planetary companion. These seismic inferences are remarkably consistent with an independent spectroscopic observation (rotational line broadening) and with the observed rotation period of star spots. Furthermore, asteroseismology constrains the mass of exoplanet HD 52265b. Under the standard assumption that the stellar spin axis and the axis of the planetary orbit coincide, the minimum spectroscopic mass of the planet can be converted into a true mass of 1.85(-0.42)(+0.52)M(Jupiter), which implies that it is a planet, not a brown dwarf.\n\nSeismic constraints on rotation of Sun-like star and mass of exoplanet\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGizon, Laurent; Ballot, JÃ©rome; Michel, Eric; Stahn, Thorsten; Vauclair, GÃ©rard; Bruntt, Hans; Quirion, Pierre-Olivier; Benomar, Othman; Vauclair, Sylvie; Appourchaux, Thierry; Auvergne, Michel; Baglin, Annie; Barban, Caroline; Baudin, FrÃ©deric; Bazot, MichaÃ«l; Campante, Tiago; Catala, Claude; Chaplin, William; Creevey, Orlagh; Deheuvels, SÃ©bastien; Dolez, NoÃ«l; Elsworth, Yvonne; GarcÃ­a, Rafael; Gaulme, Patrick; Mathis, StÃ©phane; Mathur, Savita; Mosser, BenoÃ®t; RÃ©gulo, Clara; Roxburgh, Ian; Salabert, David; Samadi, RÃ©za; Sato, Kumiko; Verner, Graham; Hanasoge, Shravan; Sreenivasan, Katepalli R.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nRotation is thought to drive cyclic magnetic activity in the Sun and Sun-like stars.

The research described in this paper was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology...as the Sun is not affected by star spot noise, but the prospects for more active stars may be limited to giant planets. Subject headings: open clusters ...nearby dwarfs should be as amenable to exoplanet detection as the Sun. The aim of this paper is to determine the solar astrometric jitter directly\n\nDiscovery of Temperate Earth-Sized Planets Transiting a Nearby Ultracool Dwarf Star\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nJehin, Emmanuel; Gillon, Michael; Lederer, Susan M.; Delrez, Laetitia; De Wit, Julien; Burdanov, Artem; Van Grootel, Valerie; Burgasser, Adam; Triaud, Amaury; Demory, Brice-Olivier;\n\n2016-01-01\n\nWe report the discovery of three short-period Earth-sized planets transiting a nearby ultracool dwarf star using data collected by the LiÃ¨ge TRAPPIST telescope, located in la Silla (Chile). TRAPPIST-1 is an isolated M8.0+/-0.5-type dwarf star at a distance of 12.0+/-0.4 parsecs as measured by its trigonometric parallax, with an age constrained to be > 500 Myr, and with a luminosity, mass, and radius of 0.05%, 8% and 11.5% those of the Sun, respectively. The small size of the host star, only slightly larger than Jupiter, translates into Earth-like radii for the three discovered planets, as deduced from their transit depths. The inner two planets receive four and two times the irradiation of Earth, respectively, placing them close to the inner edge of the habitable zone of the star. Several orbits remain possible for the third planet based on our current data. The infrared brightness of the host star combined with its Jupiter-like size offer the possibility of thoroughly characterizing the components of this nearby planetary system.\n\nThe Prevalence of Earth-size Planets Orbiting Sun-like Stars\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPetigura, Erik; Marcy, Geoffrey W.; Howard, Andrew\n\n2015-01-01\n\nIn less than two decades since the discovery of the first planet orbiting another Sun-like star, the study of extrasolar planets has matured beyond individual discoveries to detailed characterization of the planet population as a whole. No mission has played more of a role in this paradigm shift than NASA's Kepler mission. Kepler photometry has shown that planets like Earth are common throughout the Milky Way Galaxy. Our group performed an independent search of Kepler photometry using our custom transit-finding pipeline, TERRA, and produced our own catalog of planet candidates. We conducted spectroscopic follow-up of their host stars in order to rule out false positive scenarios and to better constrain host star properties. We measured TERRA's sensitivity to planets of different sizes and orbital periods by injecting synthetic planets into raw Kepler photometry and measuring the recovery rate. Correcting for orbital tilt and survey completeness, we found that ~80% of GK stars harbor one or more planets within 1 AU and that ~22% of Sun-like stars harbor an Earth-size planet that receives similar levels of stellar radiation as Earth. I will present the latest results from our efforts to characterize the demographics of small planets revealed by Kepler.\n\nOn the feasibility of studying the exospheres of Earth-like exoplanets by Lyman- Î± monitoring. Detectability constraints for nearby M stars\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCastro, Ana I. GÃ³mez de; Beitia-Antero, Leire; Ustamujic, Sabina\n\n2018-04-01\n\nObservations of the Earth's exosphere have unveiled an extended envelope of hydrogen reaching further than 10 Earth radii composed of atoms orbiting around the Earth. This large envelope increases significantly the opacity of the Earth to Lyman Î± (Ly Î±) photons coming from the Sun, to the point of making feasible the detection of the Earth's transit signature from 1.35 pc if pointing with an 8 meter primary mirror space telescope through a clean line of sight ( N H < 1017 cm- 2), as we show. In this work, we evaluate the potential detectability of Earth analogs orbiting around nearby M-type stars by monitoring the variability of the Ly Î± flux variability. We show that, in spite of the interstellar, heliospheric and astrospheric absorption, the transit signature in M5 V type stars would be detectable with a dedicated Ly Î± flux monitor implemented in a 4-8 m class space telescope. Such monitoring programs would enable measuring the robustness of planetary atmospheres under heavy space weather conditions like those produced by M-type stars. A 2-m class telescope, such as the World Space Observatory, would suffice to detect an Earth-like planet orbiting around Proxima Centauri, if there was such a planet or nearby M5 type stars.\n\nStellar Magnetic Activity Cycles, and Hunting for Maunder Minimum-like Events among Sun-like Stars\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWright, J. T.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nSince 1966, astronomers have been making measurements of the chromospheric activity levels of Sun-like stars. Recently, the decades-long Mount Wilson data became public (spanning 1966-1995) complementing the published measurements from the California & Carnegie Planet Survey (1995-2011) and ongoing measurements ancillary to radial velocity planet searches at Keck Observatory. I will discuss what these long time series reveal about stellar magnetic activity cycles, and the prevalence of stars in states analogous to the Sun's Maunder Minimum.\n\nDetection of Planets Orbiting Sun-Like Stars\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMarcy, Geoffrey W.; Butler, R. Paul\n\n1996-12-01\n\nDuring the past 11 months, astronomers have finally discovered planets orbiting Sun-like stars. A total of eight planets has been detected by the Doppler technique, and there are possible planets detected by astrometry around one other star. Some of the new planets exhibit properties similar to those in our Solar System. But many of them have properties that were unexpected. Several planets are more massive than Jupiter, and some orbit their host star in orbits smaller than Mercury's orbit. Equally unexpected is that three of these planets have noncircular orbits. Current theory of the formation of planetary systems is challenged to account for these new planetary properties, but several models are emerging, involving gravitational scattering of planetesimals and viscous or tidal decay of orbits. The occurrence rate of true analogs of our Solar System will soon be determined with the detection of long-period gas giants analogous to Jupiter.\n\nThe Colorful Demise of a Sun-like Star\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThis image, taken by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope, shows the colorful 'last hurrah' of a star like our Sun. The star is ending its life by casting off its outer layers of gas, which formed a cocoon around the star's remaining core. Ultraviolet light from the dying star makes the material glow. The burned-out star, called a white dwarf, is the white dot in the center. Our Sun will eventually burn out and shroud itself with stellar debris, but not for another 5 billion years. Our Milky Way Galaxy is littered with these stellar relics, called planetary nebulae. The objects have nothing to do with planets. Eighteenth- and nineteenth-century astronomers named them planetary nebulae because through small telescopes they resembled the disks of the distant planets Uranus and Neptune. The planetary nebula in this image is called NGC 2440. The white dwarf at the center of NGC 2440 is one of the hottest known, with a surface temperature of nearly 400,000 degrees Fahrenheit (200,000 degrees Celsius). The nebula's chaotic structure suggests that the star shed its mass episodically. During each outburst, the star expelled material in a different direction. This can be seen in the two bow tie-shaped lobes. The nebula also is rich in clouds of dust, some of which form long, dark streaks pointing away from the star. NGC 2440 lies about 4,000 light-years from Earth in the direction of the constellation Puppis. The image was taken Feb. 6, 2007 with Hubble's Wide Field Planetary Camera 2. The colors correspond to material expelled by the star. Blue corresponds to helium; blue-green to oxygen; and red to nitrogen and hydrogen.\n\nModelling the Surface Distribution of Magnetic Activity on Sun-Like Stars\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nIsik, Emre\n\n2018-04-01\n\nWith the advent of high-precision space-borne stellar photometry and prospects for direct imaging, it is timely and essential to improve our understanding of stellar magnetic activity in rotational time scales. We present models for 'younger suns' with rotation and flux emergence rates between 1 and 16 times the solar rate. The models provide latitudinal distributions and tilt angles of bipolar magnetic regions, using flux tube rise simulations. Using these emergence patterns, we model the subsequent surface flux transport, to predict surface distributions of star-spots. Based on these models, we present preliminary results from our further modelling of the observed azimuthal magnetic fields, which strengthen for more rapidly rotating Sun-like stars.\n\nTemperate Earth-sized planets transiting a nearby ultracool dwarf star\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGillon, MichaÃ«l; Jehin, EmmanuÃ«l; Lederer, Susan M.; Delrez, Laetitia; de Wit, Julien; Burdanov, Artem; Van Grootel, ValÃ©rie; Burgasser, Adam J.; Triaud, Amaury H.

B.; Schunker, H.; Gizon, L.; Schou, J.; Ball, W. H.\n\n2017-06-01\n\nContext. Rotational shear in Sun-like stars is thought to be an important ingredient in models of stellar dynamos. Thanks to helioseismology, rotation in the Sun is characterized well, but the interior rotation profiles of other Sun-like stars are not so well constrained. Until recently, measurements of rotation in Sun-like stars have focused on the mean rotation, but little progress has been made on measuring or even placing limits on differential rotation. Aims: Using asteroseismic measurements of rotation we aim to constrain the radial shear in five Sun-like stars observed by the NASA Kepler mission: KIC 004914923, KIC 005184732, KIC 006116048, KIC 006933899, and KIC 010963065. Methods: We used stellar structure models for these five stars from previous works. These models provide the mass density, mode eigenfunctions, and the convection zone depth, which we used to compute the sensitivity kernels for the rotational frequency splitting of the modes. We used these kernels as weights in a parametric model of the stellar rotation profile of each star, where we allowed different rotation rates for the radiative interior and the convective envelope. This parametric model was incorporated into a fit to the oscillation power spectrum of each of the five Kepler stars. This fit included a prior on the rotation of the envelope, estimated from the rotation of surface magnetic activity measured from the photometric variability. Results: The asteroseismic measurements without the application of priors are unable to place meaningful limits on the radial shear. Using a prior on the envelope rotation enables us to constrain the interior rotation rate and thus the radial shear. In the five cases that we studied, the interior rotation rate does not differ from the envelope by more than approximately Â± 30%. Uncertainties in the rotational splittings are too large to unambiguously determine the sign of the radial shear.\n\nAstronomers Image Lowest-mass Exoplanet Around a Sun-like Star\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n2017-12-08\n\nCaption: Glowing a dark magenta, the newly discovered exoplanet GJ 504b weighs in with about four times Jupiter's mass, making it the lowest-mass planet ever directly imaged around a star like the sun.

The thermal radiation mechanisms that account for most of the quiescent emission is reviewed, while it is also pointed out that current-amplified magnetic fields or non-thermal radiation may be required in some instances. The 20 cm radiation of coronal loops and the thermal cyclotron lines that accurately specify their magnetic field strength are discussed. The 20 cm and X ray emission of the coronal plasma are then compared. The coronae of nearby stars is next discussed, where coherent radiation processes seem to prevail. Some thoughts toward directions for future exploration are given.\n\nA Blind Search for Magnetospheric Emissions from Planetary Companions to Nearby Solar-type Stars\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLazio, T. Joseph W.; Carmichael, S.; Clark, J.; Elkins, E.; Gudmundsen, P.; Mott, Z.; Szwajkowski, M.; Hennig, L. A.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThis paper reports a blind search for planetary magnetospheric emissions from planets around nearby stars. Young stars are likely to have much stronger stellar winds than the Sun, and because planetary magnetospheric emissions are powered by stellar winds, stronger stellar winds may enhance the radio luminosity of any orbiting planets. Using various stellar catalogs, we selected nearby stars (< 30 pc) with relatively young age estimates (< 3 Gyr), finding between 100 and several hundred stars. We stacked images from the 74-MHz (4-m wavelength) VLA Low-frequency Sky Survey, obtaining 3\\\\sigma limits on planetary emission of between 10 and 33 mJy. These flux density limits correspond to average planetary luminosities less than 5--10 x 1023erg/s. Using models for the scaling of stellar wind velocity, density, and magnetic field with stellar age, we estimate scaling factors for the strength of stellar winds, relative to the Sun, in our samples. The typical kinetic (magnetic) energy carried by the stellar winds in our samples is 15--50 (5--10) times larger than that of the solar wind. If we assume that every star is orbited by a Jupiter-like planet with a luminosity larger than that of the Jovian decametric radiation by the above factors, our limits on planetary luminosities from the stacking analysis are likely to be a factor of 300 above what would be required to detect the planets in a statistical sense. Similar statistical analyses with observations by future instruments, such as the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) and the Long Wavelength Array (LWA), offer the promise of improvements by factors of 10--100.

The habitable zone is a region around a star where temperatures are right for water -- an essential ingredient for life as we know it -- to pool on the surface. Scientists do not know if Kepler-452b can support life or not. What is known about the planet is that it is about 60 percent larger than Earth, placing it in a class of planets dubbed \"super-Earths.\" While its mass and composition are not yet determined, previous research suggests that planets the size of Kepler-452b have a better than even chance of being rocky. Kepler-452b orbits its star every 385 days. The planet's star is about 1,400 light-years away in the constellation Cygnus. It is a G2-type star like our sun, with nearly the same temperature and mass. This star is 6 billion years old, 1.5 billion years older than our sun. As stars age, they grow in size and give out more energy, warming up their planets over time. Scientists and artists considered these facts when creating this illustration. If the planet Kepler-452b does in fact have liquid on its surface and has grown warmer due to the older age of its star, it could possibly be experiencing a runaway greenhouse effect, where oceans would begin to evaporate and contribute to increased cloud cover. This, plus other factors such as the planet's large size, was factored into the hypothetical scenario depicted in this illustration. http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA19824\n\nVUV Spectroscopy of the Sun as a Star\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKankelborg, Charles; Philip, Judge; Winebarger, Amy R.; Kobayashi, Ken; Smart, Roy\n\n2017-08-01\n\nWe describe a new sounding rocket mission to obtain the first high resolution, high quality VUV (100-200 nm) spectrum of the Sun-as-a-star. Our immediate science goal is to understand better the processes of chromospheric and coronal heating. HST data exist for a dozen or so Sun-like stars of a quality already beyond our ability to construct a comparable sun-as-a-star UV spectrum. The solar spectrum we obtain will enable us to understand the nature of magnetic energy dissipation as a Sun-like star evolves, and the dependence of magnetic activity on stellar mass and metallicity. This poster presents the instrument design, scientific prospects, and broader impacts of the proposed mission.\n\nRole of stereoscopic imaging in the astronomical study of nearby stars and planetary systems\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMark, David S.; Waste, Corby\n\n1997-05-01\n\nThe development of stereoscopic imaging as a 3D spatial mapping tool for planetary science is now beginning to find greater usefulness in the study of stellar atmospheres and planetary systems in general. For the first time, telescopes and accompanying spectrometers have demonstrated the capacity to depict the gyrating motion of nearby stars so precisely as to derive the existence of closely orbiting Jovian-type planets, which are gravitationally influencing the motion of the parent star. Also for the first time, remote space borne telescopes, unhindered by atmospheric effects, are recording and tracking the rotational characteristics of our nearby star, the sun, so accurately as to reveal and identify in great detail the heightened turbulence of the sun's corona. In order to perform new forms of stereo imaging and 3D reconstruction with such large scale objects as stars and planets, within solar systems, a set of geometrical parameters must be observed, and are illustrated here. The behavior of nearby stars can be studied over time using an astrometric approach, making use of the earth's orbital path as a semi- yearly stereo base for the viewing telescope. As is often the case in this method, the resulting stereo angle becomes too narrow to afford a beneficial stereo view, given the star's distance and the general level of detected noise in the signal. With the advent, though, of new earth based and space borne interferometers, operating within various wavelengths including IR, the capability of detecting and assembling the full 3-dimensional axes of motion of nearby gyrating stars can be achieved. In addition, the coupling of large interferometers with combined data sets can provide large stereo bases and low signal noise to produce converging 3- dimensional stereo views of nearby planetary systems. Several groups of new astronomical stereo imaging data sets are presented, including 3D views of the sun taken by the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, coincident\n\nTemperate Earth-sized planets transiting a nearby ultracool dwarf star\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGillon, MichaÃ«l; Jehin, EmmanuÃ«l; Lederer, Susan M.; Delrez, Laetitia; de Wit, Julien; Burdanov, Artem; Van Grootel, ValÃ©rie; Burgasser, Adam; Triaud, Amaury H.

Here we report the discovery of three short-period Earth-sized planets transiting an ultracool dwarf star 12 parsecs away using data collected by the TRAPPIST8 telescope as part of an ongoing prototype transit survey9.

Eleven orbits remain possible for the third planet based on our data, the most likely resulting in an irradiation significantly smaller than Earth's.

We have still less knowledge of the nearby substellar population, especially the planets. The four studies described herein expand our knowledge of the solar neighborhood. First, a re-analysis of the Leander McCormick Observatory photographic plates of Barnard's Star failed to detect any planets orbiting it, and this study would have detected planets with 2.2 Jupiter masses or greater. In addition, its parallax, proper motion, and secular acceleration were measured with results comparable with those from more modern equipment. Second, increased information about nearby planets was sought through time series analyses of astrometric residuals to stars observed by the University of Virginia Southern Parallax Program. Of these, LHS 288 displays an intriguing signal, which might be caused by a very low mass companion. Twelve other stars demonstrate no astrometric perturbations. While astrometry could reveal the presence of unseen companions, distances from trigonometric parallaxes define the solar neighborhood and identify its inhabitants. Preliminary parallaxes for 43 potential nearby stars being observed by the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory Parallax Investigation (CTIOPI) confirmed 28 stars as being within 25 pc, including three stars---LP 991-84, LHS 6167, and LP 876-10---that probably lie within 10 pc. Three more stars lie near the 25-pc boundary and their final parallaxes may qualify them as nearby. One recently established neighbor, LP 869-26, is a potential binary. For many stars in this third sample, preliminary photometry ( V, R, and I bands), spectroscopy, and proper motions are also available. Despite the continuing importance of ground-based parallax measurements, few active programs remain.

III.\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFuhrmann, K.\n\n2004-01-01\n\nHigh-resolution spectroscopic observations of about 150 nearby stars or star systems are presented and discussed. The study of these and another 100 objects of the previous papers of this series implies that the Galaxy became reality 13 or 14 Gyr ago with the implementation of a massive, rotationally-supported population of thick-disk stars. The very high star formation rate in that phase gave rise to a rapid metal enrichment and an expulsion of gas in supernovae-driven Galactic winds, but was followed by a star formation gap for no less than three billion years at the Sun's galactocentric distance. In a second phase, then, the thin disk - our ``familiar Milky Way'' - came on stage. Nowadays it traces the bright side of the Galaxy, but it is also embedded in a huge coffin of dead thick-disk stars that account for a large amount of baryonic dark matter. As opposed to this, cold-dark-matter-dominated cosmologies that suggest a more gradual hierarchical buildup through mergers of minor structures, though popular, are a poor description for the Milky Way Galaxy - and by inference many other spirals as well - if, as the sample implies, the fossil records of its long-lived stars do not stick to this paradigm. Apart from this general picture that emerges with reference to the entire sample stars, a good deal of the present work is however also concerned with detailed discussions of many individual objects. Among the most interesting we mention the blue straggler or merger candidates HD 165401 and HD 137763/HD 137778, the likely accretion of a giant planet or brown dwarf on 59 Vir in its recent history, and HD 63433 that proves to be a young solar analog at \\\\tauË200 Myr. Likewise, the secondary to HR 4867, formerly suspected non-single from the Hipparcos astrometry, is directly detectable in the high-resolution spectroscopic tracings, whereas the visual binary \\\\chi Cet is instead at least triple, and presumably even quadruple.

M.; Wyatt, M. C.; Lestrade, J.-F.; Greaves, J. S.; Matthews, B. C.; DuchÃªne, G.\n\n2018-04-01\n\nThis paper presents a study of circumstellar debris around Sun-like stars using data from the Herschel DEBRIS Key Programme. DEBRIS is an unbiased survey comprising the nearest Ë90 stars of each spectral type A-M. Analysis of the 275 F-K stars shows that excess emission from a debris disc was detected around 47 stars, giving a detection rate of 17.1^{+2.6}_{-2.3} per cent, with lower rates for later spectral types. For each target a blackbody spectrum was fitted to the dust emission to determine its fractional luminosity and temperature. The derived underlying distribution of fractional luminosity versus blackbody radius in the population showed that most detected discs are concentrated at f Ë 10-5 and at temperatures corresponding to blackbody radii 7-40 au, which scales to Ë40 au for realistic dust properties (similar to the current Kuiper belt). Two outlying populations are also evident; five stars have exceptionally bright emission ( f > 5 Ã 10-5), and one has unusually hot dust <4 au. The excess emission distributions at all wavelengths were fitted with a steady-state evolution model, showing that these are compatible with all stars being born with a narrow belt that then undergoes collisional grinding. However, the model cannot explain the hot dust systems - likely originating in transient events - and bright emission systems - arising potentially from atypically massive discs or recent stirring. The emission from the present-day Kuiper belt is predicted to be close to the median of the population, suggesting that half of stars have either depleted their Kuiper belts (similar to the Solar system) or had a lower planetesimal formation efficiency.\n\nProbing the debris disks of nearby stars with Fermi-LAT\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRiley, Alexander; Strigari, Louis; Porter, Troy; Blandford, Roger\n\n2018-01-01\n\nMany nearby stars are known to host circumstellar debris disks, similar to our Sun's asteroid and Kuiper belts, that are believed to be the birthplace of extrasolar planets. The bodies in these objects passively emit gamma radiation resulting from interactions with cosmic rays, as previously observed from measurements of the gamma ray albedo of the Moon. We apply a point source analysis to four nearby debris disks using the past nine years of data taken by Fermi-LAT, and report on the updated prospects for detecting gamma-ray emission from these sources.\n\nObserving the Sun with NuSTAR\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKohler, Susanna\n\n2016-07-01\n\nThe Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) is a space telescope primarily designed to detect high-energy X-rays from faint, distant astrophysical sources. Recently, however, its occasionally been pointing much closer to home, with the goal of solving a few longstanding mysteries about the Sun.Intensity maps from an observation of a quiet-Sun region near the north solar pole and an active region just below the solar limb. The quiet-Sun data will be searched for small flares that could be heating the solar corona, and the high-altitude emission above the limb may provide clues about particle acceleration. [Adapted from Grefenstette et al. 2016]An Unexpected TargetThough we have a small fleet of space telescopes designed to observe the Sun, theres an important gap: until recently, there was no focusing telescope making solar observations in the hard X-ray band (above ~3 keV). Conveniently, there is a tool capable of doing this: NuSTAR.Though NuSTARs primary mission is to observe faint astrophysical X-ray sources, a team of scientists has recently conducted a series of observations in which NuSTAR was temporarily repurposed and turned to focus on the Sun instead.These observations pose an interesting challenge precisely because of NuSTARs extreme sensitivity: pointing at such a nearby, bright source can quickly swamp the detectors. But though the instrument cant be used to observe the bright flares and outbursts from the Sun, its the perfect tool for examining the parts of the Sun weve been unable to explore in hard X-rays before now such as faint flares, or the quiet, inactive solar surface.In a recently published study led by Brian Grefenstette (California Institute of Technology), the team describes the purpose and initial results of NuSTARs first observations of the Sun.Solar MysteriesWhat is NuSTAR hoping to accomplish with its solar observations?

L.; Ballot, J.\n\n2013-04-10\n\nSun-like stars show intensity fluctuations on a number of timescales due to various physical phenomena on their surfaces. These phenomena can convincingly be studied in the frequency spectra of these stars-while the strongest signatures usually originate from spots, granulation, and p-mode oscillations, it has also been suggested that the frequency spectrum of the Sun contains a signature of faculae. We have analyzed three stars observed for 13 months in short cadence (58.84 s sampling) by the Kepler mission. The frequency spectra of all three stars, as for the Sun, contain signatures that we can attribute to granulation, faculae, and p-modemoreÂ Â» oscillations. The temporal variability of the signatures attributed to granulation, faculae, and p-mode oscillations was analyzed and the analysis indicates a periodic variability in the granulation and faculae signatures-comparable to what is seen in the Sun.Â«Â less\n\nCould Ultracool Dwarfs Have Sun-Like Activity?\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKohler, Susanna\n\n2016-11-01\n\nSolar-like stars exhibit magnetic cycles; our Sun, for instance, displays an 11-year period in its activity, manifesting as cyclic changes in radiation levels, the number of sunspots and flares, and ejection of solar material. Over the span of two activity cycles, the Suns magnetic field flips polarity and then returns to its original state.An artists illustration comparing the Sun to TRAPPIST-1, an ultracool dwarf star known to host several planets. [ESO]But what about the magnetic behavior of objects near the cooler end of the stellar main sequence do they exhibit similar activity cycles?Effects of a Convecting InteriorDwarf stars have made headlines in recent years due to their potential to harbor exoplanets. Because these cooler stars have lower flux levels compared to the Sun, their habitable zones lie much closer to the stars. The magnetic behavior of these stars is therefore important to understand: could ultracool dwarfs exhibit solar-like activity cycles that would affect planets with close orbits?The differences in internal structure between different mass stars. Ultracool dwarfs have fully convective interiors. [www.sun.org]Theres a major difference between ultracool dwarfs (stars of spectral type higher than M7 and brown dwarfs) and Sun-like stars: their internal structures. Sun-like stars have a convective envelope that surrounds a radiative core. The interiors of cool, low-mass objects, on the other hand, are fully convective.Based on theoretical studies of how magnetism is generated in stars, its thought that the fully convective interiors of ultracool dwarfs cant support large-scale magnetic field formation. This should prevent these stars from exhibiting activity cycles like the Sun. But recent radio observations of dwarf stars have led scientist Matthew Route (ITaP Research Computing, Purdue University) to question these models.A Reversing Field?During observations of the brown dwarf star J1047+21 in 20102011, radio flares were detected with\n\nRobo-AO Kepler Survey.

These observations reveal previously unknown nearby stars blended with the planetary candidate host stars that alter the derived planetary radii or may be the source of an astrophysical false positive transit signal. In the first three papers in the survey, we detected 440 nearby stars around 3313 planetary candidate host stars. In this paper, we present observations of 532 planetary candidate host stars, detecting 94 companions around 88 stars; 84 of these companions have not previously been observed in high resolution. We also report 50 more-widely separated companions near 715 targets previously observed by Robo-AO. We derive corrected planetary radius estimates for the 814 planetary candidates in systems with a detected nearby star. If planetary candidates are equally likely to orbit the primary or secondary star, the radius estimates for planetary candidates in systems with likely bound nearby stars increase by a factor of 1.54, on average. We find that 35 previously believed rocky planet candidates are likely not rocky due to the presence of nearby stars. From the combined data sets from the complete Robo-AO KOI survey, we find that 14.5 Â± 0.5% of planetary candidate hosts have a nearby star with 4â³, while 1.2% have two nearby stars, and 0.08% have three. We find that 16% of Earth-sized, 13% of Neptune-sized, 14% of Saturn-sized, and 19% of Jupiter-sized planet candidates have detected nearby stars.\n\nAn Ongoing Program of Radial Velocities of Nearby Stars\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSperauskas, J.; Boyle, R.

Each was limited in a different way, but together they can be used to evaluate sources of systematic error in either of them. The lists of Vyssotsky comprise almost 900 stars, brighter than a limiting visual magnitude of about 11.5. and thus form a magnitude-limited sample. The CNS4 includes all stars believed to be within 25 parsecs of the Sun, and thus forms a distance-limited group. Limits in magnitude are prone to the Malmquist bias by which stars of a given range in magnitude may average spuriously brighter than stars within a given distance range appropriate for the mean distance modulus. The CNS4 stars may be subject to a slight Lutz-Kelker effect. This also requires a correction that depends mainly on the ratios of the standard errors in the distances to the stars, to the distances, themselves. This is a status report on a survey seeking completeness in the six dynamical properties (positions along the three orthogonal axes, and their first time-derivatives). Parallax, proper motion and radial velocity are the stellar properties required for this information and, as is frequently the case among sets of faint stars, the radial velocities are not always available. We seek to obtain radial velocities for a full dynamical picture for more than one thousand nearby stars of which some two-thirds have been observed. It would be most desirable to follow with age-related measures for all stars\n\nAn unbiased X-ray sampling of stars within 25 parsecs of the Sun\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nJohnson, H. M.\n\n1985-01-01\n\nA search of all of the Einstein Observatory IPC and HRI fields for untargeted stars in the Woolley, et al., Catalogue of the nearby stars is reported. Optical data and IPC coordinates, flux density F sub x, and luminosity L sub x, or upper limits, are tabulated for 126 single or blended systems, and HRI results for a few of them. IPC luminosity functions are derived for the systems, for 193 individual stars in the systems (with L sub x shared equally among blended components), and for 63 individual M dwarfs. These stars have relatively large X-ray flux densities that are free of interstellar extinction, because they are nearby, but they are otherwise unbiased with respect to the X-ray properties that are found in a defined small space around the Sun.\n\nAbout 30% of Sun-like Stars Have Kepler-like Planetary Systems: A Study of Their Intrinsic Architecture\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhu, Wei; Petrovich, Cristobal; Wu, Yanqin; Dong, Subo; Xie, Jiwei\n\n2018-06-01\n\nWe constrain the intrinsic architecture of Kepler planetary systems by modeling the observed multiplicities of the transiting planets (tranets) and their transit timing variations (TTVs). We robustly determine that the fraction of Sun-like stars with Kepler-like planets, Î· Kepler, is 30 Â± 3%. Here, Kepler-like planets are planets that have radii R p â³ R â and orbital periods P < 400 days. Our result thus significantly revises previous claims that more than 50% of Sun-like stars have such planets. Combined with the average number of Kepler planets per star (â¼0.9), we obtain that on average each planetary system has 3.0 Â± 0.3 planets within 400 days. We also find that the dispersion in orbital inclinations of planets within a given planetary system, Ï i,k , is a steep function of its number of planets, k. This can be parameterized as {Ï }i,k\\\\propto {k}Î± and we find that â4 < Î± < â2 at the 2Ï level. Such a distribution well describes the observed multiplicities of both transits and TTVs with no excess of single-tranet systems. Therefore we do not find evidence supporting the so-called âKepler dichotomy.â Together with a previous study on orbital eccentricities, we now have a consistent picture: the fewer planets in a system, the hotter it is dynamically. We discuss briefly possible scenarios that lead to such a trend. Despite our solar system not belonging to the Kepler club, it is interesting to notice that the solar system also has three planets within 400 days and that the inclination dispersion is similar to Kepler systems of the same multiplicity.\n\nRelativistic deflection of background starlight measures the mass of a nearby white dwarf star.\n\nPubMed\n\nSahu, Kailash C; Anderson, Jay; Casertano, Stefano; Bond, Howard E; Bergeron, Pierre; Nelan, Edmund P; Pueyo, Laurent; Brown, Thomas M; Bellini, Andrea; Levay, Zoltan G; Sokol, Joshua; Dominik, Martin; Calamida, Annalisa; Kains, NoÃ©; Livio, Mario\n\n2017-06-09\n\nGravitational deflection of starlight around the Sun during the 1919 total solar eclipse provided measurements that confirmed Einstein's general theory of relativity. We have used the Hubble Space Telescope to measure the analogous process of astrometric microlensing caused by a nearby star, the white dwarf Stein 2051 B. As Stein 2051 B passed closely in front of a background star, the background star's position was deflected. Measurement of this deflection at multiple epochs allowed us to determine the mass of Stein 2051 B-the sixth-nearest white dwarf to the Sun-as 0.675 Â± 0.051 solar masses. This mass determination provides confirmation of the physics of degenerate matter and lends support to white dwarf evolutionary theory.

Recent detections have yielded enough information about this class of exoplanets to begin characterizing their occurrence rates, orbits, masses, densities, and internal structures. The Kepler mission finds the smallest planets to be most common, as 26% of Sun-like stars have small, 1-2 Râ planets with orbital periods under 100 d, and 11% have 1-2 Râ planets that receive 1-4Ã the incident stellar flux that warms our Earth. These Earth-size planets are sprinkled uniformly with orbital distance (logarithmically) out to 0.4 the Earth-Sun distance, and probably beyond. Mass measurements for 33 transiting planets of 1-4 Râ show that the smallest of them, R < 1.5 Râ, have the density expected for rocky planets. Their densities increase with increasing radius, likely caused by gravitational compression. Including solar system planets yields a relation: Ï = 2:32 + 3:19 R=R â [g cm(-3)]. Larger planets, in the radius range 1.5-4.0 Râ, have densities that decline with increasing radius, revealing increasing amounts of low-density material (H and He or ices) in an envelope surrounding a rocky core, befitting the appellation ''mini-Neptunes.'' The gas giant planets occur preferentially around stars that are rich in heavy elements, while rocky planets occur around stars having a range of heavy element abundances. Defining habitable zones remains difficult, without benefit of either detections of life elsewhere or an understanding of life's biochemical origins.\n\nA Census of Habitable Planets around Nearby stars?\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLeger, Alain M.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nOne day or another, a spectroscopic mission will be launched searching for biosignatures in the atmospheres of Earth-like planets, i.e. planets located in the Habitable Zone (HZ) of their stars and hopefully rocky. This could be done blindly, the expensive spectroscopic mission searching for the candidates before performing their spectroscopy. According to a clear tendency in the Kepler data, the mean number of Earth-like planets, Î·Earth, around the Kepler stars is rather low (10% - 20%). It makes this approach pretty inefficient, most of the stars studied (90% - 80%) having no such planets, and the corresponding mission time being essentially lost. This is more severe when the random position of planets on their orbits is taken into account. An exhaustive census of these planets around the nearby stars, the only ones accessible to the mission, appears desirable priorly to its launch.Up to now, the detection of low mas planets in the HZ of their stars by the Radial Velocity technique is limited to stars with very low activity (~ 2% of F,G,K stars). The detection by transits is limited by the low probability the randomly oriented orbits, few of them leading to a transit (0.5% for solar-type stars). On the other hand, ultra accurate astrometry is less sensitive to stellar activity and could detect Earth-like planets around most of the nearby solar-type stars.We present the project of a space mission, Theia+, that could do the job and measure the masses and orbits of these planets, a key piece of information to derive a possible statement about the likelihood of the actual presence of life on a planet. Other capabilities of the mission regarding Dark Matter, Very Compact Object, Cosmology, and Stellar Formation is also rapidly mentioned.\n\nRichest Planetary System Discovered - Up to seven planets orbiting a Sun-like star\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\n2010-08-01\n\nAstronomers using ESO's world-leading HARPS instrument have discovered a planetary system containing at least five planets, orbiting the Sun-like star HD 10180. The researchers also have tantalising evidence that two other planets may be present, one of which would have the lowest mass ever found. This would make the system similar to our Solar System in terms of the number of planets (seven as compared to the Solar System's eight planets). Furthermore, the team also found evidence that the distances of the planets from their star follow a regular pattern, as also seen in our Solar System. \"We have found what is most likely the system with the most planets yet discovered,\" says Christophe Lovis, lead author of the paper reporting the result. \"This remarkable discovery also highlights the fact that we are now entering a new era in exoplanet research: the study of complex planetary systems and not just of individual planets. Studies of planetary motions in the new system reveal complex gravitational interactions between the planets and give us insights into the long-term evolution of the system.\" The team of astronomers used the HARPS spectrograph, attached to ESO's 3.6-metre telescope at La Silla, Chile, for a six-year-long study of the Sun-like star HD 10180, located 127 light-years away in the southern constellation of Hydrus (the Male Water Snake). HARPS is an instrument with unrivalled measurement stability and great precision and is the world's most successful exoplanet hunter. Thanks to the 190 individual HARPS measurements, the astronomers detected the tiny back and forth motions of the star caused by the complex gravitational attractions from five or more planets. The five strongest signals correspond to planets with Neptune-like masses - between 13 and 25 Earth masses [1] - which orbit the star with periods ranging from about 6 to 600 days. These planets are located between 0.06 and 1.4 times the Earth-Sun distance from their central star. \"We also have\n\nA SUPER-EARTH-SIZED PLANET ORBITING IN OR NEAR THE HABITABLE ZONE AROUND A SUN-LIKE STAR\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nBarclay, Thomas; Burke, Christopher J.; Howell, Steve B.\n\nWe present the discovery of a super-Earth-sized planet in or near the habitable zone of a Sun-like star. The host is Kepler-69, a 13.7 mag G4V-type star. We detect two periodic sets of transit signals in the 3-year flux time series of Kepler-69, obtained with the Kepler spacecraft. Using the very high precision Kepler photometry, and follow-up observations, our confidence that these signals represent planetary transits is >99.3%. The inner planet, Kepler-69b, has a radius of 2.24{sup +0.44}{sub -0.29} R{sub Circled-Plus} and orbits the host star every 13.7 days. The outer planet, Kepler-69c, is a super-Earth-sized object with a radiusmoreÂ Â» of 1.7{sup +0.34}{sub -0.23} R{sub Circled-Plus} and an orbital period of 242.5 days. Assuming an Earth-like Bond albedo, Kepler-69c has an equilibrium temperature of 299 {+-} 19 K, which places the planet close to the habitable zone around the host star. This is the smallest planet found by Kepler to be orbiting in or near the habitable zone of a Sun-like star and represents an important step on the path to finding the first true Earth analog.Â«Â less\n\nBrightness Variations of Sun-like Stars: The Mystery Deepens - Astronomers facing Socratic \"ignorance\"\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\n2009-12-01\n\nAn extensive study made with ESO's Very Large Telescope deepens a long-standing mystery in the study of stars similar to the Sun. Unusual year-long variations in the brightness of about one third of all Sun-like stars during the latter stages of their lives still remain unexplained. Over the past few decades, astronomers have offered many possible explanations, but the new, painstaking observations contradict them all and only deepen the mystery. The search for a suitable interpretation is on. \"Astronomers are left in the dark, and for once, we do not enjoy it,\" says Christine Nicholls from Mount Stromlo Observatory, Australia, lead author of a paper reporting the study. \"We have obtained the most comprehensive set of observations to date for this class of Sun-like stars, and they clearly show that all the possible explanations for their unusual behaviour just fail.\" The mystery investigated by the team dates back to the 1930s and affects about a third of Sun-like stars in our Milky Way and other galaxies. All stars with masses similar to our Sun become, towards the end of their lives, red, cool and extremely large, just before retiring as white dwarfs. Also known as red giants, these elderly stars exhibit very strong periodic variations in their luminosity over timescales up to a couple of years. \"Such variations are thought to be caused by what we call 'stellar pulsations',\" says Nicholls. \"Roughly speaking, the giant star swells and shrinks, becoming brighter and dimmer in a regular pattern. However, one third of these stars show an unexplained additional periodic variation, on even longer timescales - up to five years.\" In order to find out the origin of this secondary feature, the astronomers monitored 58 stars in our galactic neighbour, the Large Magellanic Cloud, over two and a half years. They acquired spectra using the high resolution FLAMES/GIRAFFE spectrograph on ESO's Very Large Telescope and combined them with images from other telescopes [1\n\nA Star Close Encounter\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n2006-10-03\n\nThe potential planet-forming disk (or \"protoplanetary disk\") of a sun-like star is being violently ripped away by the powerful winds of a nearby hot O-type star in this image from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope. At up to 100 times the mass of sun-like stars, O stars are the most massive and energetic stars in the universe. The O star can be seen to the right of the image, as the large orange spot with the white center. To the left, the comet-like structure is actually a neighboring solar system that is being destroyed by the O star's powerful winds and intense ultraviolet light. In a process called \"photoevaporation,\" immense output from the O star heats up the nearby protoplanetary disk so much that gas and dust boil off, and the disk can no longer hold together. Photon (or light) blasts from the O star then strip the potential planet-forming disk off its neighbor star by blowing away evaporated material. This effect is illustrated in the smaller system's comet-like structure. The system is located about 2,450 light-years away in the star-forming cloud IC 1396. The image was taken with Spitzer's multiband imaging photometer instrument at 24 microns. The picture is a pseudo-color stretch representing intensity. Yellow and white represent hot areas, whereas purple and blue represent relatively cooler, fainter regions.\n\nKnowing Our Neighbors: Fundamental Properties of Nearby Stars\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBartlett, Jennifer L.; Ianna, P.

We know even less about local substellar populations, especially planets. The Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory Parallax Investigation (CTIOPI) is observing 31 late-type, red dwarfs selected for my thesis as part of a larger effort to complete the nearby star census. Preliminary parallaxes substantiate distances less than 25 pc for at least 28 stars. Of these, LP 991-84, LHS 6167, and LP 876-10 may lie within 10 pc. Preliminary proper motions for all but three stars exceed 0.2â yr-1. One recently established neighbor, LP 869-26, also appears to be a new binary. Associated VRI photometry and spectroscopy are in progress as well. Many of these stars are potential targets for astrometric planet searches, such as the Space Interferometry Mission (SIM). In addition to confirming solar neighborhood membership, astrometry can discover brown dwarfs and planets. Time-series analyses of residuals to the UVa Southern Parallax Program (SPP) observations are contributing to frequency and distribution data for nearby substellar objects. In particular, LHS 288 displays an intriguing signal, which might be caused by a very low-mass companion. Twelve other SPP stars demonstrate no significant perturbations. Finally, re-analyzing the Leander McCormick Observatory photographic plates of Barnard's Star failed to detect any planets orbiting it. This study of more than 900 exposures was sensitive to bodies of 2.2 Jupiter masses or more.

We have selected a list of candidate young (<100Myr) and nearby (<60pc) stars based on their space motion and/or strong X-ray flux. To determine space motion of a star, one needs to know its coordinates (RA, DEC), proper motion, distance, and radial velocity. The Hipparcos and Tycho catalogues provide all this information except radial velocities. We anticipate eventually searching approx. 1000 nearby stars for signs of extreme youth. Future studies of the young stars so identified will help clarify the formation of planetary systems for times between 10 and 100 million years. Certainly, the final output of this study will be a very useful resource, especially for adaptive optics and space based searches for Jupiter-mass planets and dusty proto-planetary disks. We have begun spectroscopic observations in January, 2001 with the 2.3 m telescope at Siding Spring Observatory (SSO) in New South Wales, Australia. These spectra will be used to determine radial velocities and other youth indicators such as Li 6708A absorption strength and Hydrogen Balmer line intensity. Additional observations of southern hemisphere stars from SSO are scheduled in April and northern hemisphere observations will take place in May and July at the Lick Observatory of the University of California. AT SSO, to date, we have observed about 100 stars with a high resolution spectrometer (echelle) and about 50 stars with a medium spectral resolution spectrometer (the \"DBS\"). About 20% of these stars turn out to be young stars. Among these, two especially noteworthy stars appear to be the closest T-Tauri stars ever identified. Interestingly, these stars share the same space motions as that of a very famous star with a dusty circumstellar disk--beta Pictoris.

On the way to observing 1,000,000 nearby stars in search of technological signals, we present three main sets of objects we plan to observe in addition to a smaller sample of exotica. We chose the 60 nearest stars, all within 5.1 pc from the Sun. Such nearby stars offer the potential to observe faint radio signals from transmitters that have a power similar to those on Earth. We add a list of 1649 stars drawn from the Hipparcos catalog that span the Hertzprung-Russell diagram, including all spectral types along the main sequence, subgiants, and giant stars. This sample offers diversity and inclusion of all stellar types, but with thoughtful limits and due attention to main sequence stars. Our targets also include 123 nearby galaxies composed of a âmorphological-type-completeâ sample of the nearest spirals, ellipticals, dwarf spherioidals, and irregulars. While their great distances hamper the detection of technological electromagnetic radiation, galaxies offer the opportunity to observe billions of stars simultaneously and to sample the bright end of the technological luminosity function. We will also use the Green Bank and Parkes telescopes to survey the plane and central bulge of the Milky Way. Finally, the complete target list includes several classes of exotica, including white dwarfs, brown dwarfs, black holes, neutron stars, and asteroids in our solar system.\n\nAll In The Family: Chandra Finds Evidence That Massive Stars Are More Like The Sun Than Previously Believed\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\n2000-10-01\n\nNASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory has found evidence that massive stars may be much more like the Sun than previously thought. Astronomers determined that magnetic loop structures, similar to those on the Sun, may exist on the surface of so-called O-type stars, some of the most luminous stars in the universe. \"This result is quite surprising,\" says Wayne Waldron of Emergent Information Technologies, Inc., and co-author of a paper submitted to the Astrophysical Journal Letters. \"This bucks conventional wisdom to find that these stars may really resemble our Sun.\" Zeta Orionis Press Image and Caption Using Chandra's High-Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer (HETGS) in conjunction with a CCD X-ray camera, astronomers observed the star Zeta Orionis (one of the three belt stars in the constellation of Orion) and found strong X-ray line emission from ions of iron, oxygen, and other elements. The high-resolution X-ray spectrum enabled astronomers to determine that the X-ray emitting gas has a density 1000 times larger than predicted by current models, an amount comparable to the atmospheric density just above the surface of the star. For many years, solar astronomers have derived densities of X-ray producing plasmas on the Sun using emission lines of ions like helium, those with just two bound electrons remaining. Chandra allows this approach to be used for other stars and it has detected X-rays from silicon ions that have been stripped of 12 of their usual complement of 14 electrons. This ion is an especially useful diagnostic of plasma densities in the extremely ultraviolet-bright environment surrounding O-stars. Following the discovery of X-ray emission from O-class stars some 20 years ago, astronomers assumed that the X-rays were created in a hot corona near the star, similar to the Sun's corona. Those models were then abandoned in favor of the currently preferred explanation: the X-ray radiation is created by energetic shocks in the stellar winds (steady streams\n\nACTIVITY-BRIGHTNESS CORRELATIONS FOR THE SUN AND SUN-LIKE STARS\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nPreminger, D. G.; Chapman, G. A.; Cookson, A. M.\n\n2011-10-01\n\nWe analyze the effect of solar features on the variability of the solar irradiance in three different spectral ranges. Our study is based on two solar-cycles' worth of full-disk photometric images from the San Fernando Observatory, obtained with red, blue, and Ca II K-line filters. For each image we measure the photometric sum, {Sigma}, which is the relative contribution of solar features to the disk-integrated intensity of the image. The photometric sums in the red and blue continuum, {Sigma}{sub r} and {Sigma}{sub b}, exhibit similar temporal patterns: they are negatively correlated with solar activity, with strong short-term variability, and weakmoreÂ Â» solar-cycle variability. However, the Ca II K-line photometric sum, {Sigma}{sub K}, is positively correlated with solar activity and has strong variations on solar-cycle timescales. We show that we can model the variability of the Sun's bolometric flux as a linear combination of {Sigma}{sub r} and {Sigma}{sub K}. We infer that, over solar-cycle timescales, the variability of the Sun's bolometric irradiance is directly correlated with spectral line variability, but inversely correlated with continuum variability. Our blue and red continuum filters are quite similar to the Stroemgren b and y filters used to measure stellar photometric variability. We conclude that active stars whose visible continuum brightness varies inversely with activity, as measured by the Ca HK index, are displaying a pattern that is similar to that of the Sun, i.e., radiative variability in the visible continuum that is spot-dominated.Â«Â less\n\nLong-Term Variability of the Sun in the Context of Solar-Analog Stars\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nEgeland, Ricky\n\n2017-04-01\n\nThe Sun is the best observed object in astrophysics, but despite this distinction the nature of its well-ordered generation of magnetic field in 11-year activity cycles remains a mystery. In this work, we place the solar cycle in a broader context by examining the long-term variability of solar analog stars within 5% of the solar effective temperature, but varied in rotation rate and metallicity. Emission in the Fraunhofer H & K line cores from singly-ionized calcium in the lower chromosphere is due to magnetic heating, and is a proven proxy for magnetic flux on the Sun. We use Ca H & K observations from the Mount Wilson Observatory HK project, the Lowell Observatory Solar Stellar Spectrograph, and other sources to construct composite activity time series of over 100 years in length for the Sun and up to 50 years for 26 nearby solar analogs. Archival Ca H & K observations of reflected sunlight from the Moon using the Mount Wilson instrument allow us to properly calibrate the solar time series to the S-index scale used in stellar studies. We find the mean solar S-index to be 5-9% lower than previously estimated, and the amplitude of activity to be small compared to active stars in our sample. A detailed look at the young solar analog HD 30495, which rotates 2.3 times faster than the Sun, reveals a large amplitude 12-year activity cycle and an intermittent short-period variation of 1.7 years, comparable to the solar variability time scales despite its faster rotation. Finally, time series analyses of the solar analog ensemble and a quantitative analysis of results from the literature indicate that truly Sun-like cyclic variability is rare, and that the amplitude of activity over both long and short timescales is linearly proportional to the mean activity. We conclude that the physical conditions conducive to a quasi-periodic magnetic activity cycle like the Sun's are rare in stars of approximately the solar mass, and that the proper conditions may be restricted to a\n\nAn Introduction to the Sun and Stars\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGreen, Simon F.; Jones, Mark H.\n\n2015-02-01\n\nIntroduction; 1.

The survey has targeted nearby young stars, as well as stars associated to star-forming regions, the Pleiades open cluster, moving groups, and debris disks. We selected the nearby young stars that have been dated with age indicators based on stellar rotation periods (i.e., gyrochronology) and chromoshperic/coronal activities. Of these, nearly 40 were observed, with ages mainly between 100 and 1000 Myr and distances less than 40 pc. Our observations typically attain the contrast of ~6 x 10-6 at 1'' and better than ~1 x 10-6 beyond 2'', enabling us to detect a planetary-mass companion even around such old stars. Indeed, the SEEDS team reported the discovery that the nearby Sun-like star GJ 504 hosts a Jovian companion GJ 504b, which has a mass of 3-8.5 Jupiter masses that is inferred according to the hot-start cooling models and our estimated system age of 100-510 Myr. The remaining observations out of the selected ~40 stars have resulted in no detection of additional planets or brown dwarf companions. Meanwhile, we have newly imaged a low-mass stellar companion orbiting the G-type star HIP 10321, for which the presence of companion was previously announced via radial velocity technique. The astrometry and radial velocity measurements are simultaneously analyzed to determine the orbit, providing constraints on the dynamical mass of both objects and stellar evolution models. Here we summarize our direct imaging observations for the nearby young stars dated with gyrochrolorogy and activity age indicators. Furthermore, we report the analysis for the HIP 10321 system with the imaged low-mass companion.\n\nStar Formation in Nearby Galaxies\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nO'Connell, Robert\n\n2009-07-01\n\nStar formation is a fundamental astrophysical process; it controls phenomena ranging from the evolution of galaxies and nucleosynthesis to the origins of planetary systems and abodes for life. The WFC3, optimized at both UV and IR wavelengths and equipped with an extensive array of narrow-band filters, brings unique capabilities to this area of study. The WFC3 Scientific Oversight Committee {SOC} proposes an integrated program on star formation in the nearby universe which will fully exploit these new abilities. Our targets range from the well-resolved R136 in 30 Dor in the LMC {the nearest super star cluster} and M82 {the nearest starbursting galaxy} to about half a dozen other nearby galaxies that sample a wide range of star-formation rates and environments. Our program consists of broad-band multiwavelength imaging over the entire range from the UV to the near-IR, aimed at studying the ages and metallicities of stellar populations, revealing young stars that are still hidden by dust at optical wavelengths, and showing the integrated properties of star clusters. Narrow-band imaging of the same environments will allow us to measure star-formation rates, gas pressure, chemical abundances, extinction, and shock morphologies. The primary scientific issues to be addressed are: {1} What triggers star formation? {2} How do the properties of star-forming regions vary among different types of galaxies and environments of different gas densities and compositions? {3} How do these different environments affect the history of star formation? {4} Is the stellar initial mass function universal or determined by local conditions?\n\nMagnetic activity and differential rotation in the young Sun-like stars KIC 7985370 and KIC 7765135\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFrÃ¶hlich, H.-E.; Frasca, A.; Catanzaro, G.; Bonanno, A.; Corsaro, E.; Molenda-Å»akowicz, J.; Klutsch, A.; Montes, D.\n\n2012-07-01\n\nAims: We present a detailed study of the two Sun-like stars KIC 7985370 and KIC 7765135, to determine their activity level, spot distribution, and differential rotation. Both stars were previously discovered by us to be young stars and were observed by the NASA Kepler mission. Methods: The fundamental stellar parameters (vsini, spectral type, Teff, log g, and [Fe/H]) were derived from optical spectroscopy by comparison with both standard-star and synthetic spectra. The spectra of the targets allowed us to study the chromospheric activity based on the emission in the core of hydrogen HÎ± and Ca ii infrared triplet (IRT) lines, which was revealed by the subtraction of inactive templates. The high-precision Kepler photometric data spanning over 229 days were then fitted with a robust spot model. Model selection and parameter estimation were performed in a Bayesian manner, using a Markov chain Monte Carlo method. Results: We find that both stars are Sun-like (of G1.5 V spectral type) and have an age of about 100-200 Myr, based on their lithium content and kinematics. Their youth is confirmed by their high level of chromospheric activity, which is comparable to that displayed by the early G-type stars in the Pleiades cluster. The Balmer decrement and flux ratio of their Ca ii-IRT lines suggest that the formation of the core of these lines occurs mainly in optically thick regions that are analogous to solar plages. The spot model applied to the Kepler photometry requires at least seven persistent spots in the case of KIC 7985370 and nine spots in the case of KIC 7765135 to provide a satisfactory fit to the data. The assumption of the longevity of the star spots, whose area is allowed to evolve with time, is at the heart of our spot-modelling approach. On both stars, the surface differential rotation is Sun-like, with the high-latitude spots rotating slower than the low-latitude ones. We found, for both stars, a rather high value of the equator-to-pole differential\n\nImproved rotation-activity-age relations in Sun-like stars\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMelÃ©ndez, Jorge; dos Santos, Leonardo A.; Freitas, FabrÃ­cio C.\n\n2017-10-01\n\nThe evolution of rotational velocity and magnetic activity with age follows approximately a t -1/2 relation, the famous Skumanich law. Using a large sample of about 80 solar twins with precise ages, we show departures from this law. We found a steep drop in rotational velocity and activity in the first 2-3 Gyr and afterwards there seems to be a shallow decrease. Our inferred rotational periods suggest that the Sun will continue to slow down, validating thus the use of gyrochronology beyond solar age. The Sun displays normal rotational velocity and activity when compared to solar twins of solar age. We also show that stars with exceedingly high stellar activity for their age are spectroscopic binaries that also exhibit enhanced rotational velocities and chemical signatures of mass transfer.\n\nLong-Term Variability of the Sun in the Context of Solar-Analog Stars\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nEgeland, Ricky\n\n2018-06-01\n\nThe Sun is the best observed object in astrophysics, but despite this distinction the nature of its well-ordered generation of magnetic field in 11-year activity cycles remains a mystery.
