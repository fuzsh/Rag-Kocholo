Online recently reported that a source close to fashion designer Vera Wang divulged a possible entrance into CBS\n\nABC network’s hit show, Dancing With the Stars.\n\nThe 2005 CFDA winner is no newbie to reality television. She has appeared on both Project Runway and The Apprentice; however, she has never assumed the role of contestant on any show.\n\nWidely-regarded for her wedding gowns, most are unfamiliar with Wang’s past as a figure skater, which obviously helps out in the competition (Kristi Yamaguchi, anyone?). She later went on to support her interest in the sport by designing costumes for Michelle Kwan and Nancy Kerrigan. Looks like she’ll be returning to her roots if she does get the opportunity to dance.\n\nBoth Wang’s and ABC reps declined to comment.\n\nRead More | E!

Starting this summer, Season 6 will air on Lifetime.\n\nThe trouble began last year when the move to the new cable channel was first announced. NBCU, upset by the loss of its popular program, filed a lawsuit. That action eventually led to countersuits and a preliminary injunction.\n\nToday’s agreement means Runway will be at its second home for at least five seasons. “The Weinstein Company will pay NBCU for the right to move Project Runway to Lifetime. All of the parties are pleased with the outcome,” NBC Universal announced in statement.\n\nNo start date yet has been announced for the next installment. The Fashion Week finale was taped back in February.\n\nRead More | Entertainment Weekly\n\nTools:\n\nPermalink\n\nShare on Twitter\n\nShare on Facebook\n\nComments (0)\n\nEmail this story\n\nProject Runway Carries On Without a Home\n\nAs they say, the (fashion) show must go on.\n\nEven though Lifetime and Bravo are still fighting over Project Runway’s future, production on the reality program has been going on as planned. For attendees of New York’s Fashion Week, that meant viewing collections from a bunch of unknown designers. Literally unknown.\n\nAt today’s Bryant Park taping, Season 6’s final three contestants got the opportunity to see their clothes on the runway. Unfortunately, unlike in seasons past, the designers weren’t allowed a chance to speak. Nor did anyone know whose creations they were. In an attempt to keep the outcome a surprise, the collections were presented to the audience blindly.\n\nClick to continue reading Project Runway Carries On Without a Home\n\nRead More | People\n\nTools:\n\nPermalink\n\nShare on Twitter\n\nShare on Facebook\n\nComments (0)\n\nEmail this story\n\nCelebrate the Holidays with Bravo Marathons\n\nThe bad news about the holidays?
