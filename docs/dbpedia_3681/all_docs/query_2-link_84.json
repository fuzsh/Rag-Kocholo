Jack Whelan (John Simm, “Doctor Who,” “The Catch”), a former LAPD cop with a troubled history, finds his idyllic life shattered when his wife, Amy (Oscar Winner Mira Sorvino, “Mighty Aphrodite”), vanishes. Meanwhile, an assassin named Richard Shepherd (James Frain, “The White Queen,” “Tron: Legacy”) is embarking on a series of executions, and a seemingly innocent nine-year-old girl, Madison O’Donnell (Millie Bobby Brown, “Stranger Things”), goes on the run. These apparently unrelated events begin to intertwine, revealing a conspiracy that will forever change our understanding of human nature. When Jack’s high school friend, Gary (Tory Kittles, “True Detective”), shows up asking for help with a murder case, he’s drawn deeper into the mystery. What he uncovers leads him down the dark path of his own past, and closer to terrifying revelations about a clandestine group known as Qui Reverti.

When Jason (Jack Donnelly, “A Royal Winter,” “House of Anubis”) sets out to find his father, he could never have anticipated where his journey would lead… Far from home and desperate for answers, Jason washes up on the shores of an ancient land. A mysterious place; a world of bull leaping, of snake- haired goddesses and of palaces so vast it was said they were built by giants – this is the lost city of Atlantis. But beneath the surface is a dark and simmering past, a complicated web of treachery and deceit, in which Jason seems inexplicably bound. Aided by the studious young Pythagoras (Robert Emms, “Chernobyl,” “Jurassic Park: Fallen Kingdom”) and the overweight, overbearing Hercules (Mark Addy, “Game of Thrones,” “Downton Abbey”), Jason embarks on a voyage of discovery, which sees him brush shoulders with Medusa (Jemima Rooper, “Hex,” “Father Brown”), come face to face with the Minotaur and even do battle with the dead.

With a history of mental illness, he’s a troubled man who sees visions of the dead, the past and ghosts. He’s convinced Kate is in danger from the spooks of Bedlam, but unbeknown to him, Kate and friends Molly (Ashley Madekwe, “Secret Diary of A Call Girl,” “Revenge”) and Ryan (Award winning pop star Will Young), the truth will be far more terrifying…BEDLAM is a RED production for Sky Living HD and executive produced by Nicola Shindler (“The Detail,” “Last Tango In Halifax”).\n\nSINBAD\n\nForget what you know about Sinbad.

At the forefront of this expeditionary force is the HMS Camden Lock, helmed by the irrepressible, if a little tetchy, Commander Henderson (Nick Frost, “Into The Badlands,” “Sick Note”). Ably assisted by a crew of misfits (the further they are from Earth the better, quite frankly), the Commander steers his ship through the stars, giving orders from his big swivelly chair. Experience the highs, the lows, the anti-gravity failures, the annoying talking mops, and, of course, the wars with alien races. Lots of wars… Executive produced by Jon Plowman (“Inside No. 9,” “The League of Gentleman”), HYPERDRIVE is a BBC Production.\n\nTHE DEEP\n\nWelcome to the new Cold War.
