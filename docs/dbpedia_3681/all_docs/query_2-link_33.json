        "text": "PRESS\n\nWhen the author’s name does not appear, it means that it was not mentioned in the article.\n\nFRANCE\n\nCharlie Hebdo, 1972\n\n\"The kind of singer it’s sublime to see and hear.\" D.D.T\n\nJazz Magazine, 1972\n\n\"Like a fragment from a universe without boundaries, Tamia's voice marked the high point of this musical event. Francis Marmande\" - [Festival de Châteauvallon avec Michel Portal], Francis Marmande\n\nLe Monde, 1974\n\n\"What's miraculous is that these little nothings seep into the spectator's consciousness and leave him as if bewitched by the fleeting contact with perfection.\" Michel Cournot\n\nArt Press, 1979\n\n\"From Tamia’s voice emerges a new echo of ways of singing or howling that have crossed time to perpetuate themselves, as well can be, in different cultures.\" Francis Marmande\n\nTélérama, 1983\n\nTamia and Pierre Favre, the union of a singer who has a voice like an entire orchestral section and one of the most musical drummers who ever hit skins and cymbals. An exceptional duo in every way. Michel Contat\n\nLe Monde de la Musique, 1984\n\nThis vocal acrobat is not just showing off. Tamia is first and foremost a powerful and reflective musician. There is no preconceived reference, though listeners are always on familiar ground, in a place they perhaps once visited in a dream.\n\nJean-Pierre Lentin\n\nLa Croix, 1984\n\nThis otherworldly voice, these internalized, ritualized gestures that seem somnambulistic in their undivided concentration, call to mind the words of French philosopher Gaston Bachelard: “You think you’re dreaming, and you remember.”\n\nAndrée Penot (about the duo with Yano)\n\nLe Monde, 1988\n\nA fusion of skins and vibrations – Tamia and Pierre Favre, this duo of vocals and percussion, don’t sound like any other music in the world and yet don’t exclude any element thereof either: whether it be classical techniques or the added power of ethnic expressiveness, perfect control or dizzying improvisation. A poetic experiment conducted by two for a single dream of beauty and knowledge.\n\nFrancis Marmande, “Best Records of the Year 1988”\n\nLe Nouvel Observateur, 1992\n\nAn invitation to travel to the ends of pure poetry, free of any artifice. Pascal Anquetil\n\nClassica,1999\n\nA trip through successive atmospheres as different as they are bewitching. David Sanson\n\nMédiapart, 2016\n\nTamia's voices are like pearls of a necklace connected magicly by a string from island to island. Jean-Jacques Birgé\n\nJAPON\n\nAsahi, 1990\n\n\"The Tokyo Festival of contemporary music, 1990. Artistic Director Toru Takemitsu. At a Tamia (vocals) and Pierre Favre (percussion) duo concert, I had an inspiring experience. Despite studying the singing techniques not only of classical music, but also jazz and world folk music, Tamia’s voice is not based on any particular one. With a voice that can instantly shift between various tones ranging from clear, high-pitched tones to a husky voice that would put traditional Japanese Enka (a Japanese singing technique) to shame.\" Hikaru Hayashi\n\nMissing title\n\n\"An ethereal melody of the body drifting through the aura of the astral realm. What is unfolding here is not a song. It is a woven tapestry of the transfiguration of the natural voice. Sometimes, it sounds surprisingly similar to a musical instrument.\" Masanori Akashi\n\nSilvestar Club, 1987\n\n\"The album \"Tamia\" is a masterpiece composed solely of vocals, which vividly shows that the human voice is the \"instrument\" that reveals the greatest potential. Indeed, its effects also have a truly natural (and mystical) serenity.\" Masanori Akashi\n\nSWITZERLAND\n\nNeue Zürcher Zeitung, 1981\n\n\"Music of such inner consistency and richly onomatopoetic variety as is seldom heard.\"\n\nBerner Zeitung, 1986\n\n\"In its emotion and sensitivity, this music, in which European and Afro-American musical traditions appear only in sublimated form, takes us furthest back towards a primeval “ur-music\".\"\n\nTagesanzeiger, 1988\n\n\"Tamia, a magician of sound, forgoing superficial effects that would show off her phenomenal vocal range, uses instead her imagination, emotions and meditative assurance to extend her vocally creative vocabulary into oniric, subconscious, even archaic realms.\" Johannes Anders\n\nDie Weltwoche, 1988\n\n\"Tamia’s voice is instrument: spanning four whole octaves, from earthy noise, naturalistic animal sounds, to the purely ethereal. This, we feel, is how things would sound if they could speak. Or rather if we still had ears to hear what they say. Her voices (for they are indeed several) form an incomparable instrumentarium.\" Peter Rüedi\n\nLuzerner Neueste Nachrichten\n\n\"Beauty of a higher order. A masterpiece.\" Meinrad Buholzer (about the album \"Solitudes\")\n\nSolothurner Zeitung, 1992\n\n\"The voices of Tamia and her eight female singers transport us far from the concert hall to the sanctuary of an ancient civilization on the banks of the Nile or somewhere between the Tigris and the Euphrates. We find ourselves among shepherds, beholding a desert landscape.\"\n\nGundi Klemm\n\nLa Tribune de Genève, 1994\n\n\"Surrounding Tamia's fabulous voice, eight other vocalists constitute this Vocal Art Ensemble. All is a cappella. The magic springs from the fusion between occidental and world musics, a polyphony beyond time. The lighting increases the magical atmosphere of the music.\"\n\nTagesanzeiger, 1994\n\n\"We are entranced by the medieval austerity, simplicity, but also the cheerfulness, as well as associations with typical ethnic music from various parts of the world. Above all the spirituality and magical aura of intervals.\" Johannes Anders,\n\nUSA\n\nThe Village Voice, 1979\n\n\"This is the first time in a long time that I have been really knocked out by some form of experimental music that has come from the continent. This is not the excitement of raw discovery. This is the even greater excitement of hearing eight or 10 raw discoveries fully integrated, fully developed, and technically perfected.\" Tom Johnson\n\nThe New York Times, 1980\n\n\"Her hourlong recital found her singing along with a tape she has made. The tape itself sounds sometimes as if it must be electronically generated or altered. The effect was magical – an oceanic choral sound, ranging from low growls to insect buzzings to sweet warblings and on to an indescribable kaleidoscope of vocal effects. This is singing of a new order, accomplished with enormous musicality, technical control and poetic imagination.\" John Rockwell\n\nThe Village Voice, 1980\n\nI was quite impressed by Tamia’s solo recording, and the singer’s live performances here recently have been equally impressive. She uses a number of different vocal techniques, all of which I find quite musical, and none of which could really be imitated by anyone else. Tom Johnson\n\nEar Magazine, 1986\n\nTamia of a Thousand and One Voices. Tamia is a versatile and inspired vocalist, whose career traverses the unpredictable terrain of the vanguard.\n\nCarol E. Tuynman\n\nGREECE\n\nEleftherotypia, 1992\n\n\"The tenderness of the voice of Tamia, the high priestess of vocal art, touches the spirit, and leaves it mingling amongst the elicited lace of notes from the percussion work of Pierre Favre. The serenity with which she stirs an enchanting path through Byzantines hymns is propelled suddenly but effortlessly into an intensity resonant of Indonesian ritual. Her voice is ever-so-light, yet distinct and full like the wind, and when it gathers force, succeeds in carrying away everything.\"\n\nAthenorama, 1992\n\n\"The voice of Tamia seems to sail out from the bowels of a lost cosmos, from far beyond the heebives of memory, where measured dimensions have no bearing. As if in a dream. At the same time this voice gives shape to a world far into the future – every future is so remote – to a cosmic form in which there are no lines or curves : only angles. Provocative angles with their summits piercing the ears and mind. And the heart is ready to burst. As if in a nightmare...\"\n\nCostas Yiannoulopoulos Ta Nea, 1992\n\n\"Why am I so impressed with Tamia. Why is it that each time I hear her I become an explorer of hidden realms in a bucolic vocal kingdom. An adventure of the senses as a whole, for you do not go there with ears alone. If you surrender yourself to her call, you pass into an alternate state, into another level of consciousness, somewhere between insight and divine rapture.\"\n\nEleftherotypia, 1993\n\n\"Tamia, with her « Vocal Art Ensemble », launches us beyond temporal dimensions. Such transcendent virtuosity and vocal agility deserve the appellation as the high priestess of contemporary vocal art.\"\n\nGERMANY\n\nMannheimer Morgen, 1987\n\n\"On their acoustic expeditions, Pierre Favre and Tamia explore the depths of the human soul. And that comes across to their listeners.\" Georg Spindler\n\nKieler Nachrichten, 1988\n\n\"The duo’s inventions appeal directly to our musical sense. We listen with a growing admiration.\" Rolf Gaska\n\nZitty Berlin, 1988\n\n\"While “meditative” would be the obvious adjective for this music, it does not suffice to describe the listening experience: its thought-provoking sounds defy all our listening habits – by the simplest means known to music: a voice with rhythmic accompaniment.\" Annette Schlünz\n\nNeue Zeitschrift für Musik, 1988\n\n\"Simple modal vocal lines mesh with percussion textures that show an extraordinary sensibility for timbres and their contrasts.\" Peter Niklas Wilson\n\nDie Union, 1991\n\n\"Suspended, poignant, beguiling, the voice of French singer Tamia seems to belong to another world altogether.\" Annette Schlünz\n\nZounds, 1992\n\n\"These dialogues on the oldest instruments known to man evoke shamanic dances, magic rituals and long-lost primal sounds. The trick to this strange and yet strangely familiar music: although the pieces are painstakingly composed, the energies flow freely. Apparent opposites are reconciled time and again. This wild and laid-back, exciting and enigmatic album eschews all the latest fashions to offer mysterious and exhilarating listening experiences.\" Michael Engelbrecht\n\nFachblatt Musik Magazin, 1992\n\n\"Confined to the essentials, to the individual and yet spectacular variety of sounds the human voice can produce and an equally vast arsenal of percussion, the music confronts our ears with “novel” and surprising sounds.\" Andreas Fürbach\n\nFreiburger Jazzhaus Journal, 1993\n\n\"Tightly wrought pieces branch out on fiery tangents, which then give way to a free flow of energies. Her voice is radiantly clear, then deep-throated and gritty.\" Reiner Kobe\n\nLeipziger Jazztage, 1993\n\n\"A singer in the no-man’s land between jazz and New Music. Avant-garde and archaic.\" Bert Noglik\n\nITALY\n\nLa Nazione, 1980\n\n\"Tamia's artistic search explores different sound potentialities of the human vocal apparatus, trying to connect the voice, the gesture and the body as a whole. In «Senza tempo», we discover at the core of the musical structure how composition is the basis for free invention, together with a theatrical visibility bare and essential, that is without any costume or decoration, emphasized by a discrete lighting.\"\n\nMusica Jazz, 1980\n\n\"I must admit that it had been a long time since a record was able to interest and enthuse me as much as this one did. A bolt from the blue. A name unknown to me until recently, and now among the ones I love best. An essential music. Let's enjoy this genuine great singing lesson.\" S.A\n\nPaese Sera, 1985\n\n\"Tamia plunges her audience in an oniric mysticism made of blessedness and transcendency.\" Ernesto Bassignano\n\nAUSTRIA\n\nArbeiter Zeitung, 1990\n\n\"Consummate beauty in a stream of sounds. It’s as though this grand vocal artist has brought the vocal traditions of all cultures together in herself, bears them in her soul and lets them flow out in intermingled currents. \" JoLi\n\nFINLAND\n\nHelsingin Sanomat, 1990\n\n\"A fascinating mixture of inspiration and imagination, giving the greatest pleasure to the listener. A synthesis of music from all over the world.\" Jukka Hauru\n\nAamulehti, 1995\n\n\"Tamia Vocal Art Ensemble represents the true art of sound and music, even the greatest forms of choir music stands far behind their art !\" Kirsti Vanninen\n\nHelsingin Sonomat, 1995\n\n\"By turns lyrical, or dancing and playful, this music is easily accessible.\" Vesa Sirén\n\nISRAËL\n\nKol Hair, 1992\n\n\"An exceptional voice. A mixture of composition and improvisation. Amazing !\"\n\nDENMARK\n\nMissing title, 1995\n\n\"A sublime singing. Tamia of a thousand and one voices.\" Inge Methling\n\nTromsos Musikguide, 1992\n\n\"Intense and varying athmospheres, a powerful expression.\" Helge Matland\n\nUNITED KINGDOM\n\nOption, 1988\n\nLabels are difficult and perhaps irrelevant here : the music has neo-classical restraint, and yet is also ethereal and quietly gorgeous. Her precise vocalizing, in an apparently invented tongue suggests the « art » music of lost or even alien civilizations. Bill Tilland\n\nAudion, 1988\n\nThe music here is strange and other-worldly, spacious and quite exceptional in range of moods and textures. […] Her style - or rather – styles are her own.\n\nSWEDEN\n\nVästerbottens Folkblad, 1988\n\n\"Tamia's voice is as unique as the artist herself is mysterious. That voice gives rise to sounds and colors which induce the feeling that you are attending some sort of ritual in the vortex of a force field emanating straight from her vocal chords.\" Bill Olson\n\nVästerbottens Kuriren, 1988\n\n\"The music is more like a sound painting, as when a visual artist uses color without ascribing any specific meaning to it. Listening to her, one feels as if what she wants to give voice to is not at all herself, but something much more universal, beyond history, something that reaches back towards our origins, something that binds us all.\" Leif Larsson\n\nRADIO\n\nFrom 1972, Tamia Valmont featured in a number of radio broadcasts, including:\n\nFRANCE INTER\n\nLe Pop-Club de José ARTHUR, on the occasion of each of her concerts and album releases\n\nBain de Minuit with Jean-Louis FOULQUIER\n\nFRANCE CULTURE\n\nDaniel CAUX - Creative radio workshop\n\nCharlotte LATIGRAT - Tamia’s singing lessons\n\nJacques TARONI - Magnetic Nights, with Nancy Huston\n\nJean-Loup GRATON – By / with / for The Voice\n\nAnd also with Maurice CULLAZ, Yanic GORNET, Eve GRILIQUEZ, Martine CADIEU, Jeanne-Martine VACHER, René FARABET\n\nFeatured in radio dramas with Claude ROLAND MANUEL, Évelyne FRÉMY\n\nFRANCE MUSIQUE\n\nPierre LATTES, Joséphine MARKOVITS - Tamia with Un Drame Musical Instantané\n\nJean-Michel DAMIAN - Nancy Huston and Tamia / Les Imaginaires\n\nAnd also with Jacques DRILLON, Olivier BERNAGER, Michel LARIGAUDRIE, Franck MALLET, Claude HERMANN, Bruno LETORT\n\nAND ALSO ON...\n\nRADIO LIBERTAIRE, with Gérard TERRONES\n\nRADIO NOVA, with Jean-Pierre GILLARD, Martin MEISSONNIER\n\nENREGISTREMENTS DE CONCERTS\n\nJazz à Ris-Orangis, with Michel PORTAL - 1976\n\nFestival de La Roche-Jagu, with Pierre FAVRE - 1976\n\nSens Music Meeting, with Pierre CHARPY - 1978\n\nFestival de Sens, with Siegfried KESSLER - 1980\n\nUméo, in Sweden, with Pierre FAVRE - 1988\n\nLos Angeles, Interview on KCRW, National Public Radio - 1988\n\nFestival de Jazz de Paris with Pierre FAVRE, for the 20th anniversary of ECM - 1989\n\nMilano, for the 20th anniversary of ECM, with Pierre FAVRE - 1989\n\nIn Germany, Interview on the NDR, broadcast by Michael ENGELBRECHT - 1992\n\nBern, with The Tamia Vocal Art Ensemble - 1995\n\nTV\n\nLa 2ème chaîne\n\nAndré FRANCIS : Festival de Jazz de Châteauvallon, with the Portal Unit – 1972\n\nFrance 3 Centre\n\nConcert with Pierre FAVRE – 1984\n\nLa 1ère chaîne\n\nBernard GELY filmed the recording of the duo with Pierre FAVRE for ECM.
