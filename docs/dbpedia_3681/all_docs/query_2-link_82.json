        "text": "The traffic was light, the sky dark, the sidewalks mostly empty on a bitterly cold recent Sunday evening in TriBeCa. Looking down shadowy side streets, it was possible, for a moment or two at a time, to imagine being back in the forbidding, exhilarating downtown New York of the 1970s.\n\nThe fantasy only deepened on arriving at the West Broadway building where the composer, vocalist, dancer, choreographer, director and filmmaker Meredith Monk has lived and worked since 1972. A star and survivor of that long-ago downtown scene, she marks the 50th anniversary of the start of her professional career this year, an ideal moment to honor her pathbreaking work, which has inspired artists as different as Merce Cunningham and Björk.\n\n“I’ve been in fashion, out of fashion,” Ms. Monk, 72, said with a broad smile over fennel tea in her loft, where the cozy, if still rough, living quarters lead through a doorway to an expansive rehearsal space. “I just keep trucking along. It’s an inner necessity to work, and that’s not going to change. I need to create. I need to.”\n\nShe made her reputation stretching her voice, and those of her collaborators, into primeval, wordless yowls, keens and rasps, placing those strange sounds within luminous, ambiguous theatrical and choreographic events. Much of the music and movement for these pieces wasn’t recorded in conventional written form, so the questions of whether and how they will be transcribed, notated and eventually revived after she is gone hang over her golden anniversary."
