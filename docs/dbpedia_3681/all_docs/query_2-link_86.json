        "text": "Jazz harmony today is explained in terms of relations between scales and chords. This is done so that the improviser can know what available notes he/she has at his/her disposal when improvising over a given chord. Though this method explains the construction of chords from a diatonic scale and provides semi-adequate pitch groups that will fit over a sounding chord, it does not begin to explain anything about harmonic analysis or the intricacies of harmony itself. The relationship between chords and scales is left purely to the recognition of the chord symbol i.e. Xmin7 is always Dorian, in a form of mechanical isolated recipe that takes no consideration of the context in which it appears. In the following thesis I intend to propose a different view that may facilitate the way jazz harmony is analysed and understood. Central to my hypothesis is the suggestion that a fundamental octatonic system of organization forms the basis of a coherent explanation of harmony. This principle is extrapolated from theories of acoustic phenomena and early tonal behaviour. The goal is to offer a unifying theory that may account for all tonal harmony, in its traditional practice, as well as embrace modern concepts in a coherent logical manner. In order to validate the theoretical claims made above the second part of this thesis deals with the historical exploration of jazz harmony, from its nineteenth century influences up to modern usage. A short sample of soloists is also provided as support of the theoretical model and its application to the world of improvisation. Besides finding a coherent form that may explain jazz harmony, this system has also proven to be an efficient tool for music education. Furthermore, it potentially paves the way for future developments in jazz and tonal harmony.\n\nDigital advances have transformed the face of automatic music generation since its beginnings at the dawn of computing. Despite the many breakthroughs, issues such as the musical tasks targeted by different machines and the degree to which they succeed remain open questions. We present a functional taxonomy for music generation systems with reference to existing systems. The taxonomy organizes systems according to the purposes for which they were designed. It also reveals the inter-relatedness amongst the systems. This design-centered approach contrasts with predominant methods-based surveys, and facilitates the identification of grand challenges so as to set the stage for new breakthroughs."
