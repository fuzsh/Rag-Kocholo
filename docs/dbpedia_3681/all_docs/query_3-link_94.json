        "text": "Ridiculous fun, I discovered this sci-fi adventure show on this site and proceeded to binge watch all five seasons. The premise is simple, with “anomalies” opening up around England, serving as doorways to Earth both past and future. But the long-term ramifications are incredibly complex, making this about much more than dinosaurs causing mayhem in the modern world. Brilliantly creative while also being quietly educational, I absolutely fell in love with the show and its oddball array of characters. Funny, clever, thought-provoking and incredibly entertaining, every episode was a must-not-miss thrill ride, beautifully balancing the “anomaly of the week” with long story arcs that slowly develop over time. Characters come and go, often in gut-wrenching ways, but everything feels organic rather than done just for shock value. Gorgeous special effects and imaginative creatures underpinned by solid science, the show was also incredibly funny in that dry British way I love so much. I’ve got to acknowledge an underrated actor (Ben Miller) playing the often-overlooked character of James Lester, admittedly a bit of a stuffed shirt bureaucrat who’d pretty much rather die than let you know he cares, but who also exemplifies the quintessential unflappable Brit in a natty suit, always quick with a scathing witticism delivered with impeccable timing. My only complaint is that there weren’t more seasons (there were at least five though), but hopefully the continuing popularity of the original Primeval online will spark the interest of another network. There was a short lived Canadian version entitled Primeval: New World, but it didn’t hold a candle to this one and was cancelled quickly. – BETHANY\n\nTo help sort out the characters, actors and various whatnots comprising this show, consult IMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808096/?ref_=nv_sr_1 and this rather brilliant Wiki site: http://primeval.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page\n\nBehold an anomaly, which looks much cooler in the show, as all the glass-like shards spin. Two things NOT to do with anomalies. #1 If one of these opens up in your London flat and you don’t know what it is, maybe don’t go through it?\n\nAnd #2 Don’t get between a huge dinosaur and the anomaly, which is its way home. It never turns out well.\n\nAbby Maitland (Hannah Spearritt) and Rex, a coelurosauravus who didn’t want to go back to his Permian home.\n\nAbby, Connor Temple (Andrew Lee Potts) and a rambunctious pair of Diictodons named Sid and Nancy.\n\nWhy, hello Mr. Giganotosaurus. Is this your piece of the tarmac? Then I’ll be moving along then. Immediately.\n\nStephen Hart (James Murray) and a Gorgonopsid. Note the amusing juxtaposition between the horrific creature and the cutesy mural behind it.\n\nTerror birds take on Danny Quinn (Jason Flemyng). Don’t worry, they’ll wish they hadn’t.\n\nA medieval knight (Tony Curran) slaying a Dracorex, which naturally must needs be a dragon. The poor thing is a gentle herbivore, but when it looks like that, how was he to know?\n\nVelociraptors show up in a thankfully closed for the night mall when an anomaly opens in a bowling alley.\n\nA Smilodon roams around an amusement park. What could possibly go wrong?\n\nYup, these things happened. I won’t even bother telling you what they are because it is unimportant. How the people working in the office building reacted was the fun part.\n\nA Columbian Mammoth loose on the M25 motorway.\n\nJames Lester (Ben Miller), a representative of the Home Office, a ministerial department of the government that handles threats, among other things.\n\nAbby, Connor, Professor Nick Cutter (Douglas Henshall) and Stephen, facing aquatic mammals from the future.\n\nLady Emily Merchant (Ruth Bradley) and excessively nasty husband, Lord Merchant (Stephen Hogan). When an anomaly opens up to Victorian London, the team discusses whether to lock it for security purposes. Connor speaks up, inquiring what they think will come through, “Oliver Twist-osaurus”?\n\nPhotos courtesy of ITV Studios, ProSieben, Impossible Pictures, Treasure Entertainment, M6 Films, Watch and BBC Worldwide\n\nBad To The Bone – their tag line, not mine\n\nThis is the sort of thing you’d get if the makers of all those Land Before Time movies decided to make a “live” dinosaur miniseries. I’ve got nothing against animation in general and quite enjoy it, but this purports to be a scientific film based on real academics. Walking with Dinosaurs (The BBC show, not the terrible 2013 movie) was amazing and it did well balancing known paleontological facts with valid extrapolation. This one seemed to be largely composed of speculation and the little stories were highly sentimental. Someone (it was an anonymous post, so I don’t know who) said it was dinosaurs being Disney-fied, and while I don’t totally agree (Disney would never have a headless corpse running around before comically collapsing), I get their drift. All the CGI dinosaurs have been grossly anthropomorphized, giving them human emotions and personalities as well as adorable faces and eyes. Some of it felt as though it’d been written as a slapstick comedy routine and there was a lot of moralizing totally inappropriate for a serious documentary-style feature. For example, a predator learning his lesson about being nice to others, then having the point rammed home by a little friend coming to his rescue when he needed help. Next, former enemies declaring a truce because the one-time aggressor saved the other dinosaur’s baby. The CGI wasn’t great but I could have forgiven that. This was just so relentlessly cutesy with little substance to back it up and that I cannot abide. – BETHANY\n\nThe watering hole bully and his little avian friend. Isn’t he just the sweetest little killing machine?\n\nDinosaur Singing Competitions\n\nAw, a big dinosaur looking placidly on as little adorable proto-mammals make their escape.\n\nEgad, did you see that ridiculous dinosaur pictured below me that looks like a box of crayons exploded all over its animation cell?\n\nIt’s unwise to wake up this incredibly grumpy guy.\n\nOh Mama Scary Killing Machine, I just wuv you!\n\nPhotos courtesy of Creative Differences, Mokko, Sauce FX, Hawaii Animation Studios, Kinkajou, Discovery Channel and Science Channel\n\nFor one of those “found” footage type movies, this wasn’t half bad. I watched it on my own but have a feeling it would have been more fun if I’d watched it with a group of friends. That way you can heckle when a character does something stupid, predict exactly what is going to happen next and take bets on whom, if anyone, is going to survive. The members of the expedition are caricatures at best, clichés at worst, with each one readily summed up in a single sentence. The uptight arrogant British adventurer who can’t decide whether to be Indiana Jones or Lord Roxton but in either case is mostly an absentee parent to a teenage son. The second in command who claims to do all the hard work while his boss poses for pictures, gets all the publicity and takes all the credit. A budget teenage version of Josh Hutcherson who craves his father’s attention and is inexplicably good with cameras and electronics. The token “hot girl” fresh out of medical school chosen for unknown reasons but probably because the expedition couldn’t afford a real doctor. The local guide who knows way more than she’s telling and keeps saying blindingly obvious things like “it’s not safe here”. There are a ton of plot holes in this movie, although that should already be patently obvious, what with the premise being a science team infiltrating darkest of Africa to search for mysterious creatures described by locals as dinosaurs when Oh no, their helicopter crashes. Why would any reputable expedition going to the heart of the Congo set out without proper provisions like multiple means of communication and, I don’t know, weapons? This goes double if you’re actually hunting dinosaurs, but nobody watches movies like this because they’re full of common sense. Good CGI, imaginative creatures and lots of conveniently placed cameras. It is important to note that whoever dreamed up the poster allowed hyperbole and imagination run amok to get the best of them, as the movie is nowhere near that exciting. A little (OK, a lot) silly and certainly predictable, but worth a decent two stars. – BETHANY\n\nIf you care to learn more about this movie, be my guest: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1907779/\n\nNaturally the kid befriends a little dinosaur.\n\nIn all fairness “Crypto” is rather cute.\n\nWhat the ding is this? Some nasty goblin/bat-osaurus?\n\nPhotos courtesy of Moonlighting Films, Kent Films, LoveFilm, Anton Capital Entertainment, Dinosaur Productions and StudioCanal"
