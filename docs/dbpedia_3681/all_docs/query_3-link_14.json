        "text": "First, the head of the monster-fighting team Professor Nick Cutter, played by Douglas Henshall, was killed off in the third series, and then the popular show was cancelled.\n\nBut there is good news - last month ITV bosses brokered a deal which will see both a fourth and fifth series on our screens, and Douglas Henshall fans will soon be able to catch the amiable Scot in new ITV drama Collision.\n\nWhile Douglas left Primeval to spend more time on stage and making films, he's not surprised that it's had a reprieve.\n\n\"I thought that the writing was good enough and the premise was good enough, then if people liked it, it could go pretty much as long as it liked. As long as people had faith in it who were making it, then I thought it would be fine,\" says the 43-year-old, bubbling with enthusiasm over coffee in a private London club.\n\n\"It taps into an eternal thing in young people, dinosaurs, monsters and myths and legends. I went to the Natural History Museum the other week with my niece, she's in her twenties, she's not a kid, but we had to go down there because I thought she should see it. Me and my partner, the three of us were walking through the dinosaur exhibit and kids, boys and girls were queuing and queuing to see this big Tyrannosaurus Rex and you think, 'What is it about dinosaurs?'\"\n\nDouglas takes a breather while I ask him about his latest TV show, Collision. He plays Detective Inspector John Tolin, who is assigned to investigate a fatal car crash on his first day back at work after a period of compassionate leave.\n\n\"His wife was killed and his daughter was crippled in a car crash, they got hit by a drunk driver and that's why he's not been at work for nine months and the first day he comes in, he has to deal with a car crash,\" Douglas reveals.\n\n\"I suppose like most men of a certain age or a certain type, therapy or counselling wouldn't be something that he'd enter into, most men try and find some kind of meaning in the job they do, so he becomes quite obsessed by the people who are involved in this car crash as a means of trying to work out what happened to him. So they become like a surrogate family for him, I think.\"\n\nThe series boasts a high quality cast including Kate Ashfield, as DI Tolin's colleague senior investigating officer Ann Stallwood, Paul McGann as property tycoon and crash victim Richard Reeve and Claire Rushbrook, who is embroiled in a plot to expose her fraudulent boss when she gets caught up in the accident.\n\nOver the course of five episodes, the lives of the victims are all interwoven, and as DI Tolin and his team sift through the wreckage, a series of revelations about the victims emerge: from Government cover-ups and smuggling, to murder.\n\n\"Working on this drama did make me realise the extent to which an accident affects so many different lives - those are the things you don't think about when you are driving.\n\n\"When you go past a traffic accident, you do slow down and have a look and then move on. But you don't think about the impact on the people involved, either the victims or their families.\n\n\"There are 72 characters in this and I liked the way it kind of knitted itself together, it is incredibly clever, grand, operatic and very visual,\" says Douglas.\n\nOne scene was filmed on a major dual carriageway just outside London, early one Sunday morning.\n\nWe see Douglas and his co-star Kate Ashfield walking along the traffic-free carriageway to investigate the scene of the crash which killed three people.\n\n\"The velocity of the cars passing by as we waited to film our scenes on this busy dual carriageway was frightening,\" says Douglas.\n\n\"We were working very much in conjunction with the police, who put in a rolling road block while we filmed the scene. We had to wait for the police to announce that the road was blocked before we started.\n\n\"Suddenly all the traffic stopped in both directions and silence just descended on it. It was very eerie.\"\n\nAfter a day's shooting on such an emotionally-wrought show, you'd be forgiven for thinking Douglas would find it hard to unwind.\n\nBut the laid-back actor says otherwise: \"Och, well I'm better at that now. To be honest, it's subliminal, but I take a bit of it home with me.\n\n\"But instead of trying to fight that, I just figure that's what I'm going to be like for the next few months.\n\n\"My partner (Croatian Tena Stivicic) is a writer and she's a bit like that when she's writing and we've kind of learned that that's just how we both are,\" he adds, with a laugh.\n\n\"We're both a bit odd and slightly irritable to be around sometimes, so in a way, it doesn't make me feel bad for being like that because I'm with somebody who understands.\"\n\nGlasgow-born Douglas has had a busy year - he's been on the silver screen twice, in romantic comedy French Film which was out in May, and again in September in Dorian Gray, while last year he was onstage at the Almeida Theatre playing Satan in The Last Days of Judas Iscariot.\n\nBut he's taking it all in his stride.\n\n\"I like the diversity, that's kind of what keeps me motivated as an actor and I'm one of those people that works well when I'm working. I like to be busy and I like the way I become more creative the busier I get.\"\n\nExtra time - Douglas Henshall\n\nDouglas was born in Glasgow on November 19, 1965.\n\nHe joined The Scottish Youth Theatre and got his first acting roles on stage.\n\nIn 1993, he appeared alongside fellow countryman Ewan McGregor in Lipstick On Your Collar.\n\nHis character in Primeval, Professor Nick Cutter, was killed by his estranged wife Helen.\n\nNext year, Douglas will be back on the big screen in drama The Eagle Of The Ninth, alongside Jamie Bell, Channing Tatum, Donald Sutherland and Mark Strong."
