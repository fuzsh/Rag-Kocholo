CAHILL Dear Mr. Watt: My office has reviewed the 1972 New Jersey Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation Plan prepared by our Department of Environmental Protection, which is the designated State agency responsible for the preparation and maintenance of the plan. We are pleased to endorse this plan, and we anticipate no significant deviation in its final printed version. New Jersey has a vigorous, on-going outdoor recreation program. I am asking that every consideration be given to the early review of this plan in order to continue our participation under the Land and Water Conservation Fund Program. As the official State document, the plan will profoundly influence New Jersey's outdoor recreation development, and will help the State achieve its goal of providing quality outdoor recreation for all its citizens.

In fact, Hudson County, the most densely New Jersey's population has grown at a rate equal to or often populated county in the State, lost 0.2% of its population during greater than that of the nation as a whole. Not only has New Jersey's population shown an absolute increase, but this Southbound traffic on the Garden State Parkway approaches the Raritan toll plaza increase has massed into defined urbanized areas with resultant increases in density. POPULATION DISTRIBUTION 7r New Jersey officially became the most densely populated State in the nation, 954 persons per square mile, when the 1970 census figures were released. (See map entitled \"Population Density 1970.\") The major portion of the State's population, approximately 74%, lives in eleven counties which form a corridor between New York and Philadelphia. County population densities range from 13,816 people per square mile in Hudson to 147.3 in Sussex. Nearly 50% of New Jersey's population resides in the five northeastern counties which border the New York City Metropolitan Area creating a population density almost five times greater than the state -MONW\". 9 the ten vear span and the number of people living in Essex POPULATION DENSITY County, the second most densely populated county, grew by 1970 only 0.7%.

'r A@_ AGE COMPOSITION Between 1960 and 1970 New Jersey's population not only X increased by over one million people, but the various age groups comprising the population underwent changes relative to each other. New Jersey's age group composition changes closely paralleled national and regional trends. The proportion of New Jersey's population in the under 5 and 25-44 age groups dropped by 2.4% and 3.9% respectively., These percent PERSONS PER SOLIARE MILE decreases for -the United States are 2.9% and 2.6%, respectively, and for the Northeast Region 2.3% and 3.3%, 0-49 -19, respectively. During the same time period, the age groups 5 50-199 20-24, 45-64, and 65 and over showed increases for all three regions with the exception of the Northeast's 45-64 bracket 200-999 which remained constant. It should be noted that the 20-64 age 1,000-4,999 group, composed of the primary wage earners, showed a 5,000-9,999 'Adr decline in proportion to the total population of 0.2% for the United States and 1.4% for both New Jersey and the Northeast 10,000 & OVER Region (see Tables 1 and 2). OCCUPATIONAL DISTRIBUTION The change in occupational distribution is similar for New Jersey, the United States, and the Northeast Region. Across the board, the greatest increases between 1960 and 1970 for all three regions have been in the categories of professional and technical workers and in the clerical and sales workers- a total increase of 5.7%, 7.3%, and 5.6% for New Jersey, the Northeast Region, and the United States, respectively; the greatest decrease has been in the field of operative and labor workers-3.9%, 2.7%, and 2.3%, respectively.

Land -The economic vitality of a state can be measured in part by its rate of land consumption. In New Jersey, residential development is the largest single user, occupying 50% of all developed land. The demand for residential land in some parts of the State already has outpaced the supply. Laced with more than 2,400 miles of state highways, freeways and limited access roads, 6,600 miles of county roads and seventeen railroads with 1,700 miles of right of way, transportation is the second largest user of land.

The rugged northwest section of the State is comprised mainly of farm land, and is a favorite area for small game and deer. Major hunting areas are the Worthington Tract (5,800 acres), Stokes State Forest (14,800 acres), and Hamburg Mountain (3,600 acres). Southern New Jersey's pine forest section also offers small game and deer hunting, and there are numerous state and private hunting facilities here-the 99,600 acre Wharton State Forest being the largest public area open to hunters in New Jersey. Also, southern New Jersey's wetlands, located along the famous Atlantic Flyway, are used by over 50 varieties of waterfowl, providing sport for both naturalists and hunters. One of the most famous waterfowl, the Atlantic brant, which breeds in northern Canada and on the coast of Greenland, winters along the Atlantic coast, chiefly in the I-,' Ar coastal strip extending from Little Egg Harbor to Cape May Point. Many agencies are active in providing for wildlife in preserves, refuges and sanctuaries. The State, through the Divisions of Fish, Game and Shellfisheries and Parks and Forestry, has over 350,000 acres which are preserved as natural habitats for wildlife management and are open for nature study as well as hunting. The Federal Government owns wildlife refuges at four locations in New Jersey. These include Brigantine National Wildlife Refuge (119,@45 acres) in Atlantic County, Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge (5,500 acres) in Morris County, Wildlife and Fisheries- New Jersey has more than 460,000 Barnegat National Wildlife Refuge (652 acres) in Ocean County acreas of fish and wildlife lands, publicly and privately owned. and Killcohook National Wildlife Refuge (635 acres) in Salem The majority are located in the northwestern and south- County.

C They presently maintain seven preserves with a total of about 285 acres. New Jersey is fortunate in its fishery resources. In addition to the coastline with its 390,000 acres of estuarine waters, there are 6,400 miles of rivers and streams, and 50,000 acres of lakes, ponds and reservoirs. These fresh and salt waters yield an endless variety of fish, including striped bass, bluefish, pickerel, walleyed pike, perch and trout, and a full spectrum of shellfish. Saltwater fishing, for which New Jersey is famous, is enjoyed all year round and runs the gamut from deep sea and bay to surf and jetty fishing.

There are a sizable number of state operated recreation areas -in the region including Ringwood State Park and Norvin Green State Forest. 25 THE CENTRAL CORRIDOR REGION (Mercer, Middlesex and Somerset Counties) The Central Corridor Region serves mainly as a connecting link between New York City and Philadelphia. The New Jersey Turnpike, the Garden State Parkway, U.S. Routes 1, 9, 22 and 130, and Interstate Routes 287 and 95 all pass through this W1 region. Because of convenient transportation and proximity to one of the major urban centers, many areas in this region are experiencing suburban growth. During the period between 1960 and 1970, the population growth rates for all three of the counties comprising the region exceeded the state growth rate. There are relatively few state recreation areas in this region. THE NORTH SHORE REGION (Monmouth County and northern section of Ocean County) The North Shore Region has the longest developed shoreline for recreation in New Jersey; the region thrives as a recreational resort. This region between 1960 and 1970 experienced the highest relative population gain of any region in the State as a result of the suburban growth expanding outward from the New York metropolitan area. The only state managed recreation areas which front the ocean, Sandy Hook State Park, Island Beach State Park, and Barnegat Lighthouse State Park, are located in this region.
