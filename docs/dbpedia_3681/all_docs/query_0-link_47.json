C, The committee met at 10 o'clock a. m., pm^uant to call, in Room 335 Senate Office Building, Senator Reed Smoot presiding. Present: Senators Smoot (chairman), Watson, Reed, Shortridge, Couzens, Keyes, Bingham, La Follette, Thomas of Idaho, Harrison, King, George, Walsh of Massachusetts, Barkley, Connally, Gore, and Costigan. The CHAIRMAN. The committee will come to order. The committee have met this morning for consideration of S. Res. 315, introduced by Senator Hamson on January 4, 1933. At this point I shall ask that the resolution be placed in the record: Resolvedf That the Committee on Finance, or any duly authorized subcommittee thereof, is authorized and directed to make an investigation and study of the present economic problems of the United States with the particular object of obtaining the views of such economists, financiers, and other persons as in the opinion of the committee may be able to offer constructive suggestions with respect to the solution of such problems. We have with us as our fii-st witness Hon. B. M. Baruch, of New York, The committee will be pleased to hear Mr. Baruch. STATEMENT OF HON. B. M. BARUCH, NEW YORK CITY Mr. BARUCH. Mr. Chairman, may I say that I have placed at the disposal of each member of the committee a copy of my remarks, and I should like veiy much if I would not be interrupted in the midst of the story, but that each member of the committee should mark the place at which he would like to ask questions, and I wiU be pleased to submit to any examination or questions any member of the committee may feel like asking at the conclusion of my statement. The CHAIRMAN. That request will be granted. I . F O U R CAUSES OF DEPRESSION Mr. BARUCH. The objective in the mind of every thoughtful man is to restore to distressed humanity the opportunity to earn its daily bread—to get people back to work again. We wish this for the whole world, but our primary duty is to put our own house in order. Our troubles come from four effects of war: Inflation, debt and taxes, national self-containment, and excess productive capacity. (1) POSTWAR AND WAR INFLATION The war cost the belligerents about $147,000,000,000—but in the purchasing power of 1913, to which level the dollar has about returned, IKVESTIGATION\" OF ECONOMIC PROBLEMS 2 that cost would have been S46,000,000,000. Thus, more than $100,000,000,000 was pure \"inflation,\" due to the destructive demands of war. It tripled the terrible aftermath which we now suffer. I have proposed a prevention of future recurrence of this evil which your War Policies Commission has recommended to the Congress. Inflation did not end with the war. The peak of prices came later and only now, 14 years after the war, wholesale prices are reaching what appears to be a normal or at least a long-time pre-war level. As a result of both the Civil and the Napoleonic Wars similar inflations occurred. It took about 14 years in each case for prices to recede to former levels, which they did as surely as water runs downhill. The wreckage due to these inflationary illusions had to be cleared away before normal processes appeared. It is so with us now and the chief barrier to returning prosperity now is the debris of World War inflation. We must courageously clear it away and stop our vain attempts to restore or preserve vanished values. That is the first step to recovery. (2) DEBTS AND T A X E S The bulk of the vast war cost (tripled by inflation) was paid in money borrowed from the people. It left a colossal load of public debt. Government costs rise during inflation and are hard to get down. Both of these causes produced high taxes. No matter what may be said in politics, taxes are paid in the sweat of every man who labors and in no other way. The fanner or the worker may never see a tax collector, but, either by deduction from his receipts or by increase in his expenses, the producer pays the cost of government. Prosperity only exists when all who work can freel}^ and fairly exchange the products of their labor for the products of others. It seems to be agreed that costs of government have risen to about 33K per cent of national income; in other words, that one-third of what our [)eople now produce goes, not to exchange for the fruits of each other's abor, but to divide with nonproducers and thus to curtail the producing and consuming capacity of the coimtry. That is the second principal cause of continuing distress. Nearly every time a legislature votes an apjjropriation, or refuses to vote an economy, it is adding a new brick in the barrier against prosperity. Every debt we forgive to other nations lifts a burden from their distressed business and adds it to our more distressed business, thus doubling our handicap. Surely, it would be a fair rule to refuse relief unless the burden of a debtor's taxes on his income is as heavy as our own. It is a difficult figure to determine and it may be in error but I am told that this test would rule out every present claim on us for debt revision. So much for public debt. Reduction in public expense is indispensable to recovery. Business is also borne down by private debts contracted at high prices which must be paid in low prices. But the decline in prices of itself is not the trouble. It makes little difference whether prices are high or lo\\v if they w^ould only rise and fall together. It is profits, not prices, which make prosperity. The real troubles are that prices do not fall uniformly and that debt and taxes do not seem to fall at all. For example: It is the disparity (not the lowness) of farm prices which almost destroys the consuming power of the agrarian half of our population. And thus, because the burdens of debt and taxes IKVESTIGATION\" OF ECONOMIC PROBLEMS 3 are higher and higher while incomes are cut in half, there is little left to any man to buy the necessaries of life. These disparities are a third cause of continued distress. (3) NATIONAL SELF-CONTAINMENT Before 1914, nations were content to rely on other countries for things which could be produced better and cheaper abroad. This mutual exchange constituted the commerce of the world. But the World War was an economic war. The Central Powers, ringed by fire and steel, turned perforce to self-containment. England and France, threatened with starvation by the submarine, learned the fear of economic strangulation. It was thus that the world became honeycombed into trade-tight economic compartments. Everywhere nations are now arming, but because\" of the lessons of the war they now arm on two fronts—military and economic. Tariffs, import quotas, domestic subsidies, and other trade barriers are symptoms of a universal fear of the imminence of war. They are ultramodern bulwarks of national defense, and the quicker we recognize that, the more competent we shall be to deal with them. National defense is a first duty of government. It rises in direct ratio with the sense of danger. It is difficult for us, in our geographical isolation, to comprehend the thoughts of a nation such as France, which lives athwart a path of conquest like the defile of Verdun and the plains of Picard;f, where milHons have fallen in a series of struggles that began before history. As long as the causes of conflict survive, we shall not be able to \" b u y \" these barriers down by debt or any^ other economic concession. The movement towar'd national self-containment is defensive and not retaliatory. To the extent that we depend on world trade, it is a continuing cause of our depression. We must recogmze its true nature to the end that, even if we can not whoUjf control it, at least we can shape our own economic policy to avoid deluding ourselves into making further vain sacrifices at the expense of our people. (4) OVERCAPACITY TO l»RODtrCE During the World War we learned to produce more things with fewer men. It was as much a war of materials as a war of men, and its capacious maw gaped for all that the nations could produce. Labor-saving machinery was only one of many expedients. We transformed our country into a unitary production machine. The whole of our industry was mobilized. The lessons learned in war were not forgotten in peace and they have changed the essential character of our economics. So engrossed were we on production that we neglected altogether the problems of distribution, especially the maintenance of equally distributed buying power throughout our own population. We must recognize, also, that demoralization of national currencies (whether forced or voluntary) have an effect, just now, to intensify the race for self-containment. I am not speaking of ''overproduction\" which is a mere corelative of \"tmderconsumption.\" I mean excess productive capacity. I mean the vast plants which, though idle now, sometimes seem to me like naasked batteries of machine guns waiting to lay down a new barrage of production whenever buying reappears. We must find IKVESTIGATION\" OF ECONOMIC PROBLEMS 4 means to control production, especially of farm and mineral output. It is a stupendous development throughout the whole world—sugar, silk, rayon, wheat, rubber, coffee, tin, iron, and copper. I know of no exception. (5) THE GREAT DELUSION The world seems to be subject to curious brainstorms—the crusades, the Mississippi scheme, and the south sea bubble, are examples. Let me quote from Mackay's Popular Delusions, referring to what he calls the Tulipomania of the seventeenth century: Everyone imagined that the passion for tulips would last forever. * • • The riches of Europe would be concentrated on the shores of the Zuyder Zee, and poverty banished from the favored clime of Holland. People of all grades converted their property into cash and invested it in flowers. Foreigners became smitten with the same'frenzy and money poured into Holland from all directions. • » • Holland seemed the very antechamber of Plutus. You will recognize some of these expressions. It seems incredible that so solid a nation as the Dutch should nearly ruin itself on such a thought, but is it any more credible than that we would go into debt to pay thirty times earning power, and even more, for common stocks of the \"New Economic Era\" on the theory that we also were going to ''banish\" poverty by selling bilhons in manufactures to an almost bankrupt world by the expedient of continually lending our customers more money? We built up a tinsel tower of paper prosperity out of debts and speculative hopes and such other things as dreams are made of. It lies in ruins, but the debts remain. What shall we do? Are we to try to put, or keep, substance in things which had no substance in the beginning, or shall we clear away the wreck? I think our duty is clear, and that in taking it we must remember that delusions swing between extremes, like pendulums. Delusions of OTandeur and unending wealth give place to delusions of unending gloom. One is as unreal as the other. I I . G E N E R A L POLICY OF LEGISLATIVE AID We can not oppose lerislation to natural laws. But legislation can aid and hasten and gxiide their effect. In this crisis, the golden rule should be; Reject all plans which oppose or postpone the working of natural processes. Aid and accelerate the effect of curative economic influence. It is a simple rule, but it is a right one. We have overlooked simple things too long. The artificialities of the great delusion were plain. We closed our eyes and went on loaning two billion dollars a year to finance sales to \"crippled*' countries, because we were persuaded to disregard arithmetic. On this artificial expansion of our world trade we built a dream of boundless wealth. Based on that alone, individuals, in seven years increased their debts by 50 per cent, and corporations by 75 per cent—all to build that tinsel structure. Nothing had happened to lift real values to such dizzy heights above the slow sweep of progress. The collapse of 1929 was inevitable. No return to normal living is possible until we clear away the vestiges of that wreck. Natural processes are working to cure every evil, but what have done to aid that cure? IKVESTIGATION\" OF ECONOMIC PROBLEMS 10 For four years we have treated the inevitable collapse of our folly as a mere interruption of a dream. We have maintained the boom-time costs of Government and incurred destructive deficits solely on the argument that the (beam would come again. No other assumption could justify our policy. We have set every legislative force against the economics of cure. We have used Federal credit in a vain attempt to reconstruct or preserve the ruins of phantom values. We have tried to avoid paying for our folly. We have not yet taken one really constructive step. I doubt if we have even recognized the true evils. And what is now proposed? The farm crisis comes from overproduction. Yet we propose^ to reward production by a billion-dollar bounty. The only remaining safeguard is the Federal credit. Yet it is slowly being undermined by deficits and recent methods of Federal financing and we are preparing to assault it now by many inventions. There are before the Congress a dozen projects that might involve it in repudiation and ruin, but I know of none that can be relied upon to preserve it. This is not progress. This is opposition to progress. The single project to aid, and not to oppose, naturd cure is to be found in the principles of the LaGuardia bankruptcy bill. It is high time that our affairs should by taking an upward turn, and I believe that we are delaying rather than advancing it. I hasten to add that I blame nobody. Congress reflects a public opinion which is leaderless, bewildered, and confused. But fundamentals are becoming clearer with experience and it is time to state right principles. There are many who say that there can be no hope until world distress is cured. There is, of course, an interdependence of nations. But ours is a country of boundless resources and of continental dimensions, extending across half of the temperate zone and providing a unitary market of 125,000,000 people, and the world's most advanced economic development. Surely we have within ourselves the materials for at least a moderate prosperity. The most important retarding influences are withm our own control. There is but a limited human capacity of both time and ability. As we had to do in the war, let us give \"priority\" to a definite few of the most effective forces at our own command in a limited program and then let us concentrate on that plan, leaving to one side action which depends on agreements with other nations and plans of a longer range. Some of these, like war debts, will intrude in spite of our plans, but let us take them in our stride. If I were writing such a program it would be: First and foremost, make adequate provision against human suffering; second, put Federal credit beyond per adventure of doubt; third, aids to rapid liquidation of debt; fourth, plans to encour^e rapid consxmption of commodity surpluses and to control productive capacity; fifth determination of policy on world economics, disarmament and debt. ILL* T H E C R E D I T OF THE U N I T E D STATES I wish I could make clear to our millions of sufferers their absolute dependence on the Federal credit. If our people only knew the dangers which our present inertia incurs, there would be a demand for instant action so great that no one could resist it. It takes money to relieve 6 INVESTIGATIOl^r OF ECONOMIC PROBLEMS suffering, and we shall need billions. We think of money as, coin and bills. But there are less than six billions of that land of money in the coimtry. The Federal Government alone has spent more than that in a single year. Most of our money is what the man in the street calls ''money in the bank.'* But the banks do not keep coin and bills to pay their depositors. They keep securities, issued for goods or some other form of wealth, which the}'' can sell to pay depositors. But securities of that kind are growing scarce and doubtful. The only kind of securities in which we have absolute confidence ai-e the obligations of the United States Government. In the Federal reserve and so-called \"reporting member banks'' alone there are about 17 billion dollars of this \"money in the bank/' and more than one-third of it is backed by Government securities. These securities have no specific goods or wealth behind them. The onlv worth they have is the world's belief that this Government, at all times, can and vdW keep the letter of its promise instantly. If anything happens to shake our confidence in these, the loss will fall immediately on this \"money in the bank.\" The only defenses between this country and ruin are these Government secunties. More than 90 per cent of our business is done, not in coins or bills, but in \"money in the bank\" (depositors check-book balances). You may own other securities or wheat or land, but when you want to sell these things to pay your taxes or your grocery bill, the buyer will rive you this kind of \"money in the bank\" in the form of a check. But every bit of it depends for its value on the Federal credit because so much of it is backed by the banks' ownership of Government securities. We do not have accurate figures on the total of bank deposits but it is probably about $45,000,000,000. Newspapers recently quoted the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury as saying that all banks owned about ten billion dollars in Government obligations. Every bank, every insurance policy, the solvency and continued operation of every corporation, employing men, the wages of labor, the wherewithal to pay the farmer, and, above all, the resources to feed the hungry and relieve distress, they all hang by a single tliread, the credit of the United States. We have kept that credit above reproach for so long that people think it can stand any abuse. But this is an era of broken precedents. It is too painful to relate all those things which we are accustoned to say \"couJd never happen\" but wliich, unfortunately, are happening before our very eyes. Wo are witnessing the disintegration of the institutions of an era. \\Miat maintains the credit of any government? It always stands on two supports; its gold reserve, and its power to meet its current obligations tl)TOugh taxes. Of these two, the essential one is the latter. Gold is only a sort of conventional restriction on the temptation of governments to extravagance. The real test of government credit is the same as the test of individual credit. Is it living wdthin its income with something left over to pay its debt? Allien, as in the Confederacy, or in the revolted American colonies, or in Germany, or Russia, a nation loses both these props, the value of its money and its bonds goes down to absolute zero and notliing can restore it except to recreate one or both of these supports of national credit. There are intermediate cases, such as that of England. Her gold reserve is so scant that she suspends specie payments, but her revenue IKVESTIGATION\" OF ECONOMIC PROBLEMS 7 is near enough in balance with her expenses to give a fairly stable, if, considerably reduced, value to the pound. Even without much gold England's credit is maintained by a balanced budget. France was in an intermediate case when she was devaluating the franc. Her gold reserve was not sufficient and she had a large deficit. The value of the franc went from 20 cents to less than two. The French credit stood on half a leg, but both by accumulating gold, and by bringing her budget into balance, France stabilized the franc. In what category do we fall? We present a unique case because we have the largest deficit and the largest gold reserve in peace-time history. Decidedly, we rely on only one support, our gold reserve. But suppose we should lose that. Because of our monstrous deficit, we would be in a worse case than England and nearly as badly off as Germany or Russia when the basis of the wealth of these countries vanished like a drop of water on a red hot stove. Do we dare continue in such danger? There is one way out, and every day's delay invites sudden consequences which I hesitate even to mention. Our fiscal circumstances are unpleasantly like those preceding a run on a bank* Our ''cash money\" is redeemable in gold on demand. Also, the entire pool of ''money in the bank'' is convertible into money redeemable in gold. The total of potential demands is many times the gold reserve and could exhaust it in 24 hours. If we resolutely balance the budget, there will not be the slightest danger of this and even if it happened we would be in no worse fix than England is to-day. But we now have a deficit of over two billions a year and the suspicion is growing that we do not really intend to balance it. With the gold reserve gone, this Government would have no recourse except the issue of irredeemable currency, money unsupported by any value, not even by the prospect of revenue. We would not be as strong as many contemporary nations which are off the gold standard because no nation ever dared to incur deficits as large as ours. The demands on our Government for all forms of relief are stupendous. In event of such a collapse, we would be helpless to aid om* people at the very moment when the need for aid is greatest. It is the weak who need a solvent government most. The strong are better able to take care of themselves. Between our present status and the disaster just described, there is only a thin veU of popular complacency and there are projects before you now which might destroy that slender protection in one day. The most dangerous are the projects to inflate the currency. IV. M O N E T A R Y INFLATION There are many people who earnestly believe that we can make conamodity prices higher by the simple process of issuing more money. It is a complex question but what does our experience show? In December, 1932, we had outstanding nearly 5.7 billions of money and Dun's Commodity Index stood at 133.9. The highest commodity prices since 1921 were in May, 1928. Dun*s price index then stood at 199.2, but the amoimt of issued money was then only 4.7 billions. Since September, 1930, the amount of money issued has risen about $1,000,000,000 while commodity prices have steadily fallen. There is no such thing as arithmetically relating prices as to the quantity of issued money. 8 INVESTIGATION- OP ECONOMIC PROBLEMS Quite apart from any figures, the fact that the great bulk of our business is not done in issued money but in ''money in the bank\" should be enough to suggest that an increase in ''cash money'* alone could produce no such effect. The fact is that there is no lack of money—either of \"money in the bank'' or \"cash money.\" In other words, all the money of both classes in 1932 would have financed much more business at prices current then, than all the money of both classes in 1928 would have financed at the height of 1928 activity at prices current then. Yet, in spite of all this excess stagnant pool of money in 1932, business activity was about half what it was in 1928. For three years we have conducted a vast but vain experiment in inflation. Not being willing to sacrifice for a balanced budget, we have been selling Uncle Sam's duebills—^not to people who have \"money in the bank\" which already exists and is backed by securities representing economic goods—but mostly to the banks themselves. The Government was saying in effect to a bank: Put this Treasury duebUl for $1,000,000 in your vault and write on your books a credit to the Government of $1,000,000. After this transaction, the Government wrote checks for its expenses for that $1,000,000 and, by that process, without anything representing economic wealth having been deposited in that bank, but only a Treasury promise representing a deficit, the Government added $1,000,000 to the sum of all the \"money in the bank.\" We have coined our deficit to pay our expenses. I can see no fundamental difference between what we have done and the proposal to issue Federal reserve notes or other currency to pay for our deficits, which our inflationists now propose as a sure-fire method of raising prices, except that the inflationists do not propose to go half as far as our Treasury has already gone. Out of more than five and one-half billions of dollars of deficit which we have piled up during the depression, nearly five billions is represented by increases in the holdings of Government securities by Federal reserve and member banks alone, and, as I read the news reports, the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury thinks total holdings of Government securities by all banks is as much as ten billions of dollars. Be that as it may, Government has added at least five billions and probably the whole deficit to \"money in the bank.\" But it has produced no such beneficent effect on prices as the inflationists thinly would come from issuing a much lesser amount in Federal reserve notes to pay expenses. Those notes, if issued, would be \"money in the bank\" just as quick as the recipients could deposit them in their bank accounts. Both plans come to the same thing in the end, but I fear that we have gone to the limits of prudence already in this method of Federal financing, and I doubt if we can continue to get money in that way. It has clogged our pools of bank credit. It has obscured the whole question of Federal credit by creating an artificial market for Federal securities. It is this method of financmg that has lulled the country into complacency on the effects of deficits. Nobody can say with confidence that, in this condition, we can borrow in the ordinaiy way by seUing long-term bonds. The outgoing administration will leave the cash balances at a low point and present us with a dangerous and totaUy obscure fiscal problem at the very outset. Delay in balancing the Budget is trifling with disaster. IKVESTIGATION\" OF ECONOMIC PROBLEMS 9 I note that the Secretary of the Treasury said on Saturday: Ultimately the point might be reached where central bank credit has to be invoked to support the credit of the Government, and when that point is reached we have entered the field of destructive inflation. You gentlemen know that we long ago reached the point where central bank credit was invoked to support the credit of the Government. What is the matter with this theory that more money will make prices go up? To answer that you must ask: What is it that makes the prices of things go up? It is the fact that a prospective buyer would rather have the thing than the money. In booms, people prefer things to money because they hope the price of things will go up and they Imow that the price of money will not. If, at such a time as that, we make credit easy or issue more money, people will borrow to buy. So^ many people do that at the same time that their buying makes things scarce and sends prices higher. The higher prices go, the more pepple are able to borrow on the collateral of thmgs, to buy more things and to send prices still higher. At such a time, if the Federal reserve \"buys Government bonds\" (which is what I think the Secretary of the T r e a s u p r means when he speaks about invoking central bank credit), or if the Government issues still more money and does other things to make speculative buying easier, it can precipitate a boom as it did in 1920. But when nobody has confidence, nobody wants to buy things, which fall in price. Everybody wants to sell things to get money, which does not fall in price. In the scramble to exchange things for money, prices drop and that restricts credit stiU more because it reduces the collateral of loans. That forces more selling to protect loans and that forced selling sends prices still lower. At such a time, government can not force prices up by issuing more money because nobody will use credit to buy things because nobody wants to buy anything. In other words, confidence is the basis of higher prices. If there is no confidence, no amount of tinkering with the currency can raise the price level. On the contrary, and tms is the yery heart of the whole problem of the depression, deficits and thefinancingof them by \"bank money\" inflation (or even the mere talk of monetary inflation) impair confidence still more and drive money deejjer into hiding. I am aware of the rejoinder: \"If you think inflation will have no effect on prices, why do you object to trying it?'^ The first answer is one I have just made, that the mere talk about proposals of inflation prevents confidence and bars recovery. That is the essence of our present trouble. It is not lack of money or credit. , Men can not go back to work imtil money goes back to work. Men risk their money in commerce because they expect to get it back with a profit, but nobody will risk doUars which the Government threatens to devaluate. Business moves on faith in promises. Money itself is a promise. Every sale and every employment is a promise to do something and to pay something. Money will not go to work in the presence of any such desperately dangerous fiscal policy as we have piu-sued and are stiU pursuing—^much less in an atmog)here full of talk of the repudiation of money and debts by both men and government®. That is why I say with such confidence, that until we make the money and the credit of the United States safe beyond peradventure no 10 Il^VESTIQATION OP ECONOMIC PROBLEMS amount of economic mustard plasters will cure our pains. That is why the Reconstruction Finance Corporation plan has failed of full effect, and that is why other Federal aids to business are frustrated. I am not given to prophecy but I am willing to hazard on this subject. From the moment that we honestly balance the Federal Budget and return to an orthodox Treasury policy, money will flow here from all the world and out of every cautious domestic hoard, seeking safety and employment, and we shall have reached the end of out downward path. There will be more sound money available than all the inflationists propose to print. That is the only way to restore to our people the means to earn their daily bread, and that will do it, in my opinion, with ^eat rapidity. There is no magic in this conclusion. It is the sim]^e arithmetic of the oldest axioms in the world. Men who oppose this step are unwittingly opposing recovery. But men who iasist on inflation are courting a greater danger. There is a way to iuflate prices. It is possible to make people prefer things to money, not by increasing their confidence in things but by absolutely destroying their confidence in money so that they will ''flee from the dollar\" to buy things because they fear the future of money. The vast ''bank money'' inflation of the past two x>r three years has failed to frighten people to this extent for three reasons: The size of the gold reserve, their failure to understand what was going on, and the constant promise of our Government that it was about to balance the Budget. If you want to raise prices by destroying the Federal credit, you must go further than this. You must cast actual and widespread doubt on the Government's ability to perform its promises or on its good faith in making them. The danger of this in our country is that when you have raised a s ^ c i e n t doubt, people may not scramble to buy things. If a suflicient number got the same ide at the same time, the gold reserve would vanish overnight and then this Government would be helpless to do anything for anybody. That would make prices rise instantly and like a sky-rocket. It would do as it did in Germany when it took a valise full of paper marks to buy a sack of flour. With our present hordes of people out of employment, it would precipitate general starvation. The most enthusiastic inflationist contemplates no such residt as this, but they do not see that we have reached a stage where any further tinkering with fundamentals is playing with dynamite at the heart of human welfare. I want to talk at length about inflation and I ask for your patience because there is so much confusion. I shall use the proiect to cut the gold content of the dollar for illustration because, while other plans are admittedly indefinite, this one is specific. There are now approximately 26 grains of gold in the dollar. If we cut that by 25 per cent to about 20 grains, we at least have a mathematical formula. Other plans present some differences in result, but, so far as their effect on prices is concerned, they all propose similar results. To whatever extent other plans prove to be effective, all that I shall say about this plan applies to the others. If the public foresaw the move, there would be an instant rush to redeem present money in gold, and the whole project would fail because there would be no gold left in the reserve. This is certain because, if we put the plan into effect to-morrow, every man who IKVESTIGATION\" OF ECONOMIC PROBLEMS H redeems to-day would be 3Z% per cent richer to-morrow than the man who did not, as I have shown. But let us suppose that by some magic, we could get by this danger, and that to-morrow, with $4,000,000,000 of gold, we should have reduced the redeemable value of the dollar 25 per cent. Will that inflate domestic prices? Not unless the move causes people to prefer things to dollars because their confidence in dollars has been destroyed. The new dollars would have more than 100 per cent gold coverage because of reduction in the redeemable value of all the dollars now issued. It seems extremely doubtful that there would be any domestic effect to raise prices. Of course, there would be a tremendous shock to confidence in such a wholesale act of outright repudiation and the feeling that it might be repeated at any time. But, passing over these conjectures and assuming that the attempt would act as its proponents hope, there are some probable results. The domestic prices of surplus export commodities are made abroad by world competition. To make it simple, let us suppose that a shilling is now worth 25 cents and that the Liverpool price of wheat is $1 a bushel. An Englishman must spend four of his shillings to buy a bushel of wheat. But after a dollar is worth only about 20, and not 26, grains of gold, his shilling would exchange for 33K cents of the new money instead of 25 cents of the old. While it would still take 4s. to buy a bushel of wheat, when these shillings were changed into dollars to pay the American farmer, they would be $1.33 in the new money. In other words, theoretically, the price of wheat at Liverpool, expressed in sterling, would still be 4s., but expressed in dollars, it would increase 33^ per cent. And since the Chicago price generally follows Liverpool the argument is that the domestic price of wheat would also rise, and so, theoretically, would the price of cotton and other export products. It is wrong to suppose that this would increase the'buying power of foreign countries for our surplus export commodities. It would still take 4s. to buy a bushel of wheat, because the price of wheat is made abroad in sMllings and by world competition. Devaluation of the dollar would not change these competitive conditions. But there would certainly be a decrease in our buying power abroad. For example, the British price of smoked rubber sheets would remain the same in shillings and pence. But it would take 33K per cent more of the new dollars to buy rubber. In other words, this is a proposal (without any compensation to him whatever) to increase to the American consumer by 3 3 p e r cent the cost of his sugar, coffee, tea, rubber, silk, imported wools, and other imported commodities, and also the price of his cotton and wheat, and all other export commodities, of which the price is made in foreign markets. There would be an instantaneous harmful effect on our international creditor position. The world owes us upwards of $20,000,000,000 on which the interest payment of more than $1,000,000,000 is one of the strongest elements of our economy. Foreign debtors pay that charge in enough of their money to buy 26 grains of gold to the dollar or the equivalent of that in goods. After a 25 per cent devaluation they would pay only enough to buy 20 grains of gold. For instance, a present debt charge of 25 francs would be reduced to less than 19 francs. In other words, this proposal would certainly and instantly reduce all debt payments to us by 25 per cent. But our citizens owe biUions 159450—33 2 12 INVESTIGATION OF ECOKOMIO PROBLEMS abroad. If we suppose that $1 will now buy 4s. with which to pay an obligation due in English currency, instantly, after a 25 per cent devaluation, it will take $1.33}^ to pay the same debt. In other words, this proposal would certainly and instantly increase the cost of American debts due in foreign currencies by 33% per cent. The Department of Commerce reports, for 1930, American receipts of $838,000,000 and expenditures of $227,000,000 on longterm international investment account, a net balance of $611,000,000. We do not know how much of the sums sent abroad were for debts in foreign currencies, but, if all were, and if devaluation were in effect, that net balance would reduce to $325,000,000. It seems a shocking proposal, to the benefit of nobody but foreign nations. In the case of American manufactures where the price is made in this country, as distinguished from export commodities where the price is made abroad, there is an apparent benefit in export trade. If an American plow is made to sell to the Argentine for $100 and it now requires ^400 to pay for it in New York, then after a 25 per cent devaluation it wiU take ^300 and the Argentine can buy more plows. Why is this true? Starting from the raw material, the bulk of cost of that plow is the wages of labor and the reason it can be sold for fewer pesos is that such devaluation has an insidious but instant effect to cut those wages 25 per cent. To whatever degree inflation by any plan increases e^^ort trade, it does so by the sacrifice of our labor conditions and dissipation overseas of American assets. A country can continue this sort of thing for only a limited time. I cite the case of Russia, which has recently conscripted thousands of working men to the northern forests for the purpose of producing lumber to sell abroad to create export credit out of the very lives of her people. But the effect of devaluation to reduce our creditor position is urged as rehet to foreign customers to permit them to buy more of our goods. It is true that a creditor nation, especially one who declines imports, can not expect continued vast export expansion. For 10 years we neglected this fundamental and staged a fantastic boom on the basis of an increased export financed entirely by unwise foreign loans. The present argument for increasing exports by relieving burdens on debtors at the expense of American labor is a repetition of the same blind folly in a different guise. It would be far better to cultivate our domestic market by increasing the buying power of our own people. So much for the wholly destructive effect of inflation on our international relations. Let us examine the effect at home. The producers of surplus export commodities would probably receive a higher price in a lower dollar, and the price of imported products, principally food, clothing, and other necessaries, would rise. But the price of other things would not rise nearly so fast nor so far. Indeed, it is not certain that they would rise at all, except in the panic event I have discussed. When England went off the gold standard and the pound declined more than 25 per cent, prices rose very little, and promptly declined again and after nearly two years there is no marked effect on domestic prices. Even suppose prices went up exactly as the inflationists hope, who would be aflected? Only a relatively small part would at once feel any benefit. Some, but by no means all, farmers would get a benefit and also some manufacturers. But wages are fixed by contract INVESTIGATIOlsr OF ECONOMIC PROBLEMS 13 and not in the open market. They would rise slowly if at all. The laborer's dollar, which yesterday bought 26 gold grains* worth of necessaries, would to-day buy only 20 grains' worth. Labor, which has already suffered a 40 per cent to 50 per cent reduction in income, would suddenly find itself the victim of a new and greater cut, not by its employers, but by the very Government upon which it relies for protection. And not labor alone. The same thing would happen to every man who works for a salary, every professional man, and the whole ''white-collar\" class, and also to every insurance policy, savings and bank account, investment, trust fund and endowment of colleges, hospitals, and other public institutions. If a man has a $3,000 life insurance policy which promises his widow about 78,000 grains of gold, instantly about $750 of this protection would be whisked away as effectively as though purloined from his widow's pocketbook. It is said that the effect would be to lighten debt and taxes by 25 per cent. But, with the exception of a very limited class, the effect would be greatly to increase the burden of both. Thus, while the farmer might be able to pay taxes with fewer pounds of wheat, the wage or salary earner would have to pay a greater share of his wages for necessaries and would have less to pay rent, debts, and taxes. These things are true of every one of the inflation plans to whatever extent they prove effective. They pass a plane of cleavage through our population and oppose class against class on the most vital issue of present human existence—the wherewithal to live^ and support a family. On one side of that plane are the beneficiaries— chiefly foreign nations (for whom alone is the benefit certain), and the producers of some export products. But on the other side are all those who work for wages and salaries, all pensioners, public servants and employees, professional men and all those who still retain any money or fixed-income securities from the wreckage of this four years of national blundering. It is said that this is a capital levy to redistribute wealth. Until we can get buying power into the brands of our people we can not expect recoveiy. But this proposal, by inflation, to clip salaries and wages wherever they can be found will greatly curtail buying power. It is not a levy at all because it does not appropriate anything to the Government or to anybody else. It merely destroys whatever it touches and puts it to no new ownership or use. ^ I regard the condition of this country as the most serious in its history. It has been said to be like war. It is worse than war. In war there is a definite enemy. We know what and where he is and how to fight him. We can measure the necessary sacrifices and make them with certainty in their effect. But this enemy wears no uniform and takes no position on any front. He is everywhere, even within us. So far as I am concerned, there is no sacrifice I would not be willing to make to fight this terror, no plan, however revolutionary and bold, that I would not try if I could see in it an even chance of success. If I did not know that there was nothing but destruction to be derived from the project of inflation, I would be the first to advocate its trial. But I am as certain as that we are sitting here that the path proposed is the road to ruin. 14 INVESTIGATIOl^r V. OF ECONOMIC PROBLEMS T H E F U N D A M E N T A L OF R E C O V E R Y — ^ B A L A N C E D B U D G E T S What are we then to do? To my mind the road is wide and certain. There is one essential thing—to get people back to work. To do that, we must make money work. To make money work, we must balance the Budget. That should be accomphshed first by reducing expenses. If we can bring the expenditures in our National Budget under $3,000,000,000 that in itself would result in a return of confidence and therefore an increase in business and employment. That increase of business would bring the Budget into full balance without further taxation. A balanced budget and a soimd money policy go hand in hand. If those two things are done, there would be more sound money flowing into activity than all the unsound money our inflationist friends propose to coin. Immediately the Government would be able to fund its already unwieldy short-term obligations into long-term investments, which would free the banks to take care of the business that must increase. Balancing the Budget does not mean that there will not be plenty of money for relief purposes of all kinds. Indeed, it means there will be more money available. The credit of the Government would be increased and bonds could be issued and sold to almost any reasonable extent for the purposes of relief for the needy and such public works as would be deemed wise to undertake. But accompanying the issue of those bonds there must be assessed sufficient taxation to take care of the interest and amortization of the bonds issued for the above purposes. As a part of the general tax system, I think the ^'beer tax*' should be included in order to bring the Budget nearer balance before you assess new taxes for relief purposes. We should move immediately toward repeal of the eighteenth amendment, not alone for relief of its abuses but for the purpose of obtaining taxation which can be substituted for more onerous levies. The people of the country wll bear any tax burdens provided they can see hope of relief from them in the future. We must preserve personal initiative. Taxation should not be levied beyond the point where men wiU cease to work because the tolls become too great and the profits too little. With the Budget balanced, we can approach other problems with more assurance of success. Without it, all must fail. That has been, in my opinion, the reason why beneficent results have not flowed from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. We must reahze that, if our Budget had^ been balanced in the last three years, the Government of the United States would not have accumulated a deficit of five and one-half billion dollars, the interest upon which, at 4 per cent, is $220,000,000 per year, and with a sinkmg fund of 1 per cent is two hundred and seventy-five millions—a very large proportion of our total cost of government. This can not go on, because there is a limit even to the credit of the United States. Finally, I think the Government should stop advancing money to pay interest and principal on private debts of a doubtful nature. It is a postponement and frustration of economic cure. I realize the danger of wholesale receiverships and crash sales on sterile markets but the way to avoid that is being blazed by the principles of the La Guardia bill. After debts and capital structures are scaled do\\Mi INVEg^IGATIOK OF ECONOMIO PROBLEMS 15 to a realistic basis, I think the Government could aid—not by itself assuming direct liability and not on any plan that requires it to raise money, but by assuming only a contingent liability in guarantees of interest to support the value of reorganized and scaled-down securities in a manner which I shall definitely explain in the discussion of farm debt. I.have not yet worked out the extension of this plan to other debts and do not know that I can do so, but I am quite sure that this principle marks the limit to which we should go in the use of Government credit in this field. To sum up this suggestion of fiscal pohcy: (a) $800,000,000 of actual and certain saving; (b) $150,000,000 of new revenue from beer; (c) all emergency appropriations to be covered by new revenue sufficient for sinking fund and interest thereon; (d) abandonment of the present Treasury method of financing the deficit; (e) restriction of Government aid to debtors to immediate revision of the bankruptcy act and to a contingent liability on a guarantee of interest on scaleddowTi debts to be applied only on prudent risks. VI. FARM RELIEF I began the study of the farm price problem in 1921 and have devoted my thought and attention to this serious difficulty ever since. I have studied every project that I have heard of for the stabilization of farm prices because I regard the effect of our tariff system on our agriculture as one of the most serious lapses in our domestic economy. While I am in the fullest sympathy with the purposes of the farm bill now before Congress, I believe that there is a better way to get at them which I shall propose later. In order to discuss that way, it wiU be necessary to criticize this bill. I always dislike very much to criticize anybody unless I have something to offer. In doing that I shall try, in what I shall propose, to offer a constructive suggestion for every critcism. The plan seeks to reduce production by curtailing acreage. Yet, instead of subsidizing nonproduction, it pays a bounty on a certain percentage of all included products which are marketed. This will increase production per acre. The methods for doing this are many and effective and unless the actual curtailment of acreage is both <irastic and certain, these methods could frustrate the plan. The incentive created by the bill is also to overstate the acreage previously planted—and thus to upset the mathematical basis of curtailment— and also to understate the acreage harvested and thus to avoid curtailment. Since the bounty is to be paid on a percentage of each man^s marketing, and since price plus bounty is nearly double price alone and boimty is paid regardless of grade, the result will be to bring in all seed and feed and farm-consumed product and also waste grades even if farm requirements are at once repurchased. On wheat alone this might be sufficient to fi*ustrate the purpose of curtailment. No matter what may be the price on grades full of sand, dirt, chaff, stalks, and defects, the bounty is the same. The plan assumes that the fund collected from the tax will be the exact equivalent of the amounts earUer paid out as bounty. Every human incentive of the taxed is to pay less—of the recipient of the bounty to get more. The result will be a deficit charged to the Treasury and it could run to very large figures. The percentage of 16 INVESTIGATION OP ECONOMIC PEOBLEMS each farmer's marketed production, which is to receive bounty, is the ratio of the estimated domestic consumption to the estimated total crop. But because of all the reasons just stated, the sum of the parts of each farmer's crop on which bounty is paid is sure to be larger than the estimated total domestic consumption of the whole crop. Also, the higher price of the favored crop will reduce the experienced domestic consumption of it. The plan is not self-policing because there is no quota to be apportioned among each group. After the domestic percentage is once estimated, every farmer gets a bounty on that percentage of all that he sells. The mcentive is not for the members of a community to police each other; it is to abet each other. Blanket authority is given the Secretary of Agriculture to set up an organization and we can not say what the cost will be because the bill does not visualize what the action will be. The plan also proposes to put determination of a tax in the aggregate of nearly $1,000,000,000—or perhaps 40 per cent as much as the entire present Federal revenue—in the discretion of a single administrative officer, and it is a sales tax of as much as 100 per cent on necessaries of life. Finally, it does not sufficiently consider the harm it will do to certain established industries. I shall submit my constructive suggestions at the end of my statement. VII. W O E L D ECONOMIC AND D I S A E M A M E N T CONFERENCES Out of the depths of this gloom the hojje of humanity is being beckoned by two great councils of the coming year—on world economics and disarmament. Though disillusioned by repeated failure and bewildered by obscurity of purpose and principle, people will still take from them the eternal human comfort that \"all may yet be well.'' The current talk of agenda and protocol and similar abracadabra may savor of priestly mummerj;, but the proper purpose here is as plain as a pikestaff and the controlling principle is clear. With these attained^ all t W g s are possible. Trifle with them, obscure them, try to get by without them, and the world would better save its breath to cool its scanty porridge. What is it that men hope? A chance to earn their daily bread? The commerce of the world is dying. The hope is to revive it. Problems of prices, debts, employment, prosperity, and of stark existence for some great governments all come to this—that the nations shall trade again. This and nothing else is the proper purpose in both of these conventions. The controlling principle is no less clear. Why does commerce languish? Notwithstanding a vast and dreary literature, there is not a multifiplicity of reasons, there are not six nor two—there is only one. You can't buy goods with chaff. Much of the money now proffered in the world's markets in exchange for things is like the fairy gold in children's books—^it may be coin to-night and a handful of autumn leaves to-morrow. That is the mahgn center of this blight. Economic barriers and armaments and debts—all these are surface stigmata. Unsound money is the evil to be crushed. INVESTIGATIOlsr OF ECONOMIC PROBLEMS 17 When is a nation's money unsound? Is a great deal of gold a guaranty of soundness? There is not a tithe enough gold above ground to support the monies of the world on that theory. There is no mystery. A nation's money is unsound when it continually spends much more than it receives in revenue and makes up the difference by using its debts for money—no matter how adroitly. This has been true since the world began—not some of the time, not now and then, not here and there, but everywhere, and all of the time, and without one single exception. We have reached a perilous point where triflers with these verities in every nation have become enemies of their people. We can not escape by palliatives. A nation's money is simply its promise to pay. No sophistry can change the rule that neither the paper promise of a repudiator, nor the note-of-hand of a spendthrift living beyond his means, nor sophisticated entries showing credits on the self-kept ledgers of a desperate debtor, will ever pass at par in the markets of the world. No nation is living within its income now and the money of all is unsound or suspect. That is the effective cause of continued misery, and cure of that is the controlling principle for any council among nations. There is no need for long agenda or complicated plans. The program for both talk and action can be written on a calling card. \"Balance the budgets of the world.\" That is the bed-rock purpose of these councils. The economic conference will say that commerce is the exchange of money for goods. But sound commerce can never be restored on unsound money. Why should we talk there of forcing up commodity prices when the money to pay for them remains unstable? Why should we then consider trade barriers when, as obstacles to commerce, the most formidable of them compare as molehills to mountains agamst the present demoralization of exchange? Money is the medium of trade and the very essence of the economic problem is to make it usable again. If that is omitted, all else is wasted effort. If that prevails, little more is needed. At Geneva, men will talk of clipping the power of offensive armament, of limiting the calibre of movable guns and the tonnage of airbombs, thus hoping to aggrandize defensive works. Geographically we are not in a position of offense. We have no aggressive arms to lay down. The chief reason we confer is our hope that there may be a greater tendency toward peace and less toward war and thus Europe may spend less on armament. Here again the avowed purpose—at least it should be—^is to persuade frugality in aid of balanced budgets. Finally the debts: As I have saM before, if we reduce eveiy single substantial argument for modification to its essence, we find it running not to the injustice or even the expediency of the long-time burden, but solely to the present difficulty in the transfer of funds, which is to say to the unsoundness of the money of the debtor nations. Thus at the heart of every subject for world conference, no matter what form the surface takes, we find one single evil—that governments refuse to balance budgets, and, as I have tried to show, it is no less true with us. Until these causes are frankly addressed and fairly settled, the nations will arm on both the military and economic fronts and nothing that we can do by way of debt concessions or sacrifices of the best interests of our people will change the essential result. We may get 18 INVESTIGATIOl^r OF ECONOMIC PROBLEMS some superficial change in form but whenever T hear talk of a reduction in the size of bombing planes or the calibre of a mobile gun, on the theory that thus the power of the offensive may be reduced and defensive arms lightened, I recall how we mounted heavy naval and even seacoast artillery on railroad cars in preparation for the bombardment of Metz. Nobody can foresee the kind of armament in the next war any more than anybody foresaw the tanks and flames and mines and gas and stabilized trench fighting of the World W p . Napoleon Bonaparte attempted to disarm Prussia and thought he had done so but, by the simple expedient of running classes of recruits rapidly through the skeletonized standing army, Schamhorst and Stein created the legions which overwhelmed and sent the Emperor to St. Helena. You can not disarm a nation by shortening the length of its sword. The real power of a nation is its resources of men, materials, money, and morale. Armament is merely a facility for mobilization. Its reduction is a worthy expedient for the reduction of expenses, but it is not a means of reducing the probability of war or of making war less horrible. The only way you can do that is to remove the case of war. We should concentrate our infleunce on that. For disarmament plus amelioration of the cause of war we could afford great sacrifice but we would be foolish to make any sacrifice at all for promises of disarmament alone. There is one alternative to world disaster. The nations must hve within their income. That achieved, all conferences may succeed brilliantly. That failing, no amount of scenic bargaining and solemn parley on superficial projects will avail. With the monotony and persistence of old Cato, we should make one single and invariable dictum the theme of every discourse: \" Balance budgets. Stop spending money we haven't got. Sacrifice for frugality and revenue. Cut governmental spending—cut it as rations are cut in a siege. Tax—tax everybody for everything. But take hungry men off the world's pavements and let people smile again.\" If we can not enter these discussions with that as our purpose and our guiding principle, we ought not to enter them at all. In the economic conference there is only one other subject worth considering—some international agreement on silver. ^ As to disarmament, both military and economic, the sole constructive possibility seems to me to be the removal of the age-old causes for world conflict. The Peace of Versailles was a peace dictated at the point of a gun. Its sanctions are failing. The questions of the Silesian Frontier, the Polish Corridor, the Saar, the Cordon Sanitaire which France has negotiated around Germany, and many boundary and ethnic questions left unsettled or badly settled at Versailles are the real cause of the heavy armament under which the world is groaning and, in my judgment, they are also the cause of most of the artificial trade barriers about which so much has been said. I divide the farm problem into two things. One, the relief of the huge debt that is crushing the workers on the farm and depriving them of their homes, and the other is some definite, long-range plan that will give them a larger profit in the production from their farms. I proceed first to the farm debt relief. I understand that a bill something sinular to this is now under discussion. I do not know in what committee. IKVESTIGATION\" OF ECONOMIC PROBLEMS 19 Let me say this, that in every suggestion that I have seen, no matter from what source it has come, it always has led back to the public treasury—and a burden upon the taxpayer. Even the suggested plan was made in New York to put up $10,000,000 on which it was proposed to borrow $100,000,000 from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, and that goes back to the Government. And one of the ablest Senators has just introduced a bill for $500,000,000 from the Government. And so have many other bills made such proposals. I am prefacing my remarks because I propose to use the credit of the Government because I think we have to, because everything leads back to that. If these farmers are permitted to lose their farms and go upon the highways of the country they become charges upon the people and the States can not help them. We must help them—the pubhc treasury. Another thing I think is important, not alone for the great social question involved, of which you gentlemen aU know better than I, but I think it is important that we should keep a satisfied agriculture, because every country which has permitted that to die has died itself. And there may come a time, not far distant, if you permit the laissez faire policy to go too far, as some want it to, when this coimtry might be faced with an under production—I mean the nation might be in a position where it would have less to live on and less with which to clothe itself. POSTSCBIPT NO. 1.—FARM DEBT BELIEF We have between nine and ten billions of farm mortgages, created largely on the land values of the Great Delusion. It is a waste of money (which we do not have) to undertake the payment by Government of interest or maturities on existing mortgages. There must be a realistic reorganization of this structure. The principles of the LaGuardia bill are the first step but that alone will not solve this problem. Let us crelate a corporation which shall be authorized to issue its 3 per cent tax-exempt, 30-year sinldng fund bonds, callable by lot at par. The interest only on these bonds will be unconditionally guaranteed by the Government. This corporation will then offer to exchange its bonds for existing farm mortgages at not to exceed 60 per cent of the par of such mortgages and for as much less than 60 per cent as the circimastances of individual cases seem to require. It will then proceed to reform all the mortgages thus received in exchange for its bonds on a basis of 3% per cent interest on the scaled-down principal, plus a graduated amortization charge which starts at zero the first year, one-fourth of 1 per cent the second year, one-half of 1 per cent the third year, IK of 1 per cent the fourth year, and 2 per cent for the fifth year. The effect of this plan will be to write down existing farm mortgages by a minimum of 40 per cent or an average of perhaps 50 per cent. It will write down the interest by a probable minimum of about 66?^ per cent. Farmers receiving this very great aid should be willing to agree in the new mortgage contract to comply with such requirements of reduction in croppage as may from time to time be prescribed by the government until their mortgage is repaid. As a means of offsetting the possibility of loss to the Government, I propose that there be collected under the provisions of the farm price 20 INVESTIGATIOl^r OF ECONOMIC PROBLEMS relief plan (which I am about to propose) an annual fund of $30,000,000, which shall be paid into this corporation and any amount not needed to offset the guaranty allowed to accumulate together with the profits which I think will accrue for the purpose of the purchase of marginal and other farm lands and their retirement from production as may from time to time be required in the working out of a permanent agrarian policj^ for the United States. This plan should be limited to present, not future mortgages. This plan does not mean that mortgages will be forced to take this new bond. It is only a way out for the unsalable mortgages. Nothing connected with this plan should infringe the right of foreclosure. I am going into a little more detail here while we are on the subject. The way this would work would be this. Just as a convenient form we will say that the farmer had a mortgage for $10,000. Upon that now he probably pays not less than $800 a year. The man who has that mortgage can not sell it; even if he wants to foreclose it he can not get any money for it, because nobody wants to buy the farm. So he has got a dead asset on his hands, or it is held up by some governmental action to suspend foreclosure, but he has got a dead asset on his hands. Now, if we could use this as, if I inay use the term, as a kind of currency whereby negotiations depending upon the particular instance, the assessed value of the land, the condition of the mortgage, we could negotiate with the mortgagee $5,000 of these bonds. That would clear him out. The farm mortgage would then be $5,000. His other $5,000 was wiped off. Upon that $5,000 he pays 3 per cent. It is really per cent, but for the purpose of convenience of figuring it mathematically let us use the figure 3 per cent. We will say he would pay 3 per cent on that, plus an amortization charge, which would be, of course, lessening the principal amount of his debt which has been cut in half^—an amortization charge of per cent, making 5K per cent on $5,000. That makes $275 a year against $800 a year. Now, that is a use of the Government credit, but the Govenmient does not go out and unbalance its budget by selling a bond against current issues in the market. What it is doing is, it is replacing an inflated mortgage with this deflated mortgage, which goes to the benefit of the mortgagor. It benefits the mortgagee also because he has got something, whereas before he had nothing. Now that is in essence the plan, and we will come back to that later for such questions as you wish to ask. I want to add to the top of this first paragraph of postscript No. 2, farm surplus control, at the beginning of the paragraph, the following: \" I f it IS deemed absolutely necessary for the Government to curtail surplus,'' and then proceed with the paragraph, ' ' I propose,^' and so forth. And I must say I have taken the idea from the allotment plan and rather made it different or reversed its proposals, and no doubt there are many objections can be made to this plan, but I give it to you for w^hat it is worth. POSTSCRIPT NO. 2.—FARM-SURPLUS CONTROL If it is deemed absolutely essential for the Government to curtail surplus, I propose that the Secretary of Agriculture shall determine the amount by which total acreage of com, cotton, wheat, and tobacco IKVESTIGATION\" OF ECONOMIC PROBLEMS 21 shall be reduced, and, for the first year that the reduction be drastic to consume the present overwhelming surplus. Quotas of reduction should be allotted to States and then to counties and greater reductions should be made in surplus-producing States than in States where production is not equal to the State consumption. Then the Government should actually lease, from each farmer who wishes to participate in the plan, not to exceed the percentage of his acreage which has been allotted to liis county, on condition that he does not crop more than his now planted or last harvested acreage, minus the total acreage reduced from each crop in respect of which acreage is to be reduced. This is for the purpose of insuring that production of substitute crops is not increased. The rental to be paid should be an amount slightly larger than the profit that could be made on the reduced crops at farm prices in their pre-war relations to general commodity prices. Rough computations indicate that the average rental would be somewhere around $3 an acre, being higher near primary markets and lower in more distant places. The cost of this plan has been estimated at around $160,000,000, but in order to provide the $30,000,000 I have mentioned as a guaranty fund in the farm mortgage plan, we should figure on raising about $200,000,000. That amount can be raised by a tax on the processing not of wheat alone but on all processed cereals, not on cotton alone but on all textiles, not on hoga alone but on all meat products. Unless this is done we will reduce the consumption of the particular product and frustrate the plan. By substituting this plan for the plan now before Congress, which I understand has been changed, the tax would be reduced from the ^resent project to tax wheat 100 per cent of the present price to a tax between 6 and 7 cents on all processed cereals, the tax on pork would be reduced from about 3K cents to about one-half a cent on meats, and the tax on cotton cloth from 6 cents a pound to about one-half a cent on textiles. Such taxation is bearable and, if assessed in this way, will not disturb the present relation of consumption of the various commodities. From such conversations as I have had with leading processors, we can get their cooperation rather than their opposition. They recognize, as well as any of the rest of us, the absolute necessity of affirmative action. From the farmer's standpoint, while the initial distribution of money may be smaller, undoubtedly will be, it is the opinion of commodity experts whom I have consulted that such a plan would be really effective in reducing production. While I do not wish to conjecture a definite result, it seems to be quite generally believed that the effect would be very promptly to raise the price of the managed crops to the prewar level and to carry other farm prices up sympathetically. There are obvious objections that may be made to any plan but in this emergency which is like the emergency of war, we must take some chances and while I deplore all statutory artificialities, I think we should make this attempt. Many think that all raw materials can be produced here by American labor and exported in the shape of manufactured goods, but I have not been able to see that through to its end. Gentlemen, I would like to add this statement. I do not know whether the picture that I presented to you was a gloomy one or not, but I would like to say this, after most definite thought on this 22 INVESTIGATIOl^r OF ECONOMIC PROBLEMS subject, if we but do these things there will lie before us opportunities for service, for fame, for fortune, and for the younger md coming generations, who are more interested in this than theylthink, such as have not existed at least in my lifetime, and that covers 60 years— I can not speak before my time—I believe there are great opportunities, and that this is not a time for gloom, if we will but see the stark necessities and face them. Now I will be glad to submit to questions, and when we get into the details of the farm problem I am going to ask General Johnson here who has been trying to put it down on a drawing board, and who is more familiar with it than I am, to answer it with respect to the details. The C H A I R M A N . Perhaps it would be just as well to have Mr. Johnson submit what he has to submit at this time. Mr. BARTJCH. If it is not clear, why we will clarify it. General JOHNSON. There is not anything more to submit. The C H A I R M A N . Any questions that may be asked or may b submitted at this time then. Senator C O N N A L L Y . Let us take one witness at the time, before we forget what he says. The C H A I R M A N . That is what I say; if you have any questions to ask the present witness. Senator C O N N A L L Y . Being a junior member of the committee I will wait until the senior members have interrogated him. The C H A I R M A N . You may proceed, Senator. Senator C O N N A L L Y . May I proceed? The C H A I R M A N . CertaiiUy. Senator C O N N A L L Y . Mr. Baruch, I want to ask you a few questions about your views on the so-called inflation, particularly with reference to the gold content of the dollar. You stated, I believe, that if they reduced the amount of the gold in the dollar it would not have any appreciable effect on raising prices, did you not? Mr. B A R U C H . It would have the effect of cutting the price in the new dollars, and there would be a flight from the dollar if there was a loss of confidence. Senator C O N N A L L Y . What is that? Mr. B A R U C H . It would have an effect in cutting the price in the new dollars, and it would also have an effect of raising it very, very high if there was a reduction in the amount of gold in the dollar and confidence in the new dollar was lost, because there would be a flight from the doUar. Senator C O N N A L L Y . If you are going to predicate everything back on the confidence, why I can not get very far. Mr. B A R U C H . What page are you now on? Senator C O N N A L L Y . I am on page 1 7 . You say: ''There are now approximately 26 grains of gold in the dollar. If we cut that by 25 per cent to about 20 grains, we at least have a mathematical formula/' and so on. A httle later you say that there would be a rush for gold. Of course, if the Government suspended payment in gold there would probably be a rush for the actual gold. But now you state down below: *'It seems extremely doubtful that there would be anv domestic effect to raise prices.'' Is that your attitude? Mr. B A R U C H . I have not followed you, Senator. IKVESTIGATION\" OF ECONOMIC PROBLEMS 23 Senator C O N N A L L Y . I followed you, and I think you ought to follow me a little. Mr. B A R U C H . I am trying to do it, Senator. Senator C O N N A L L Y . Page 17, about two-thirds down the page. Mr. BARITCH. Yes, sir. \" I T seems extremely doubtful that there would be any domestic effect to raise prices.\" Senator C O N N A L L Y . \" I t seems extremely doubtful that there would be any domestic effect to raise prices.\" Is that correct? M r . BARUCH. Y e s , sir. Senator C O N N A L L Y . All right. Why do you say a little later that salaries would fall and wages would fall, if prices do not rise? How would wages fall and salaries fall? Mr. BARITCH. Because we are talking in new dollars. Senator C O N N A L L Y . Oh, 1 know. Mr. B A R U C H . And the new dollars would not buy as much as they did before. The prices of products would go up to the percentage of 33K per cent. Senator C O N N A L L Y . Well, they would go up then, would they not? Mr. B A R U C H . Yes, they would. Senator C O N N A L L Y . Well then, your statement that there would not be any influence in ra^ng prices is not correct, is it? Mr. B A R U C H . Well, it is doubtful, because it did not happen in England, but as an arithmetical proposition you are right. Senator C O N N A L L Y . Well, that is what we are talking about. Mr. B A R U C H . But it is doubtful from the results; that it has not occurred. Senator C O N N A L L Y . Wait a minute. You say it has not raised prices in England? M r . BARUCH. Y e s , sir. Senator C O N N A L L Y . And that is because England is on the pound basis, which is paper money, is it not? Mr. B A R U C H . Yes, sir. It takes more shillings to buy gold. Senator C O N N A L L Y . To buy gold. M r . BARUCH. Y e s . Senator C O N N A L L Y . Certainly. And in the world market the English prices of production have gone down, and the result is that she is out-selling us all over the world? Mr. B A R U C H . That is quite true in the export markets of the world. Senator C O N N A L L Y . In the export markets of the world. If England, instead of being on the paper standard had devaluated her pound at the present paper value of the pound, prices would have risen in the world markets, would they not? Mr. B A R U C H . If they had done what. Senator? Senator C O N N A L L Y . If England were now in the gold basis but had devaluated her pound at the same price that the pound is seUing for, the paper poimd is selling for, prices would increase in England? Mr. B A R U C H . Prices would be the same in gold value that they are to-day. Senator C O N N A L L Y . And the price would be in gold, the pound? M r . BARUCH. Y e s . Senator C O N N A L L Y . The Mr. B A R U C H . We would same would be true in our country? have a better result in our country if we balanced our budget and had a gold standard. 24 INVESTIGATIOl^r OF ECONOMIC PROBLEMS Senator O O N N A L L Y . Devaluating the gold dollar keeps you on the gold standard, no question about that. Mr. B A R U C H . D O you mean it keeps you on the gold standard if you devaluate the gold dollar? Senator C O N N A L L Y . We can take that up when we get to it. We can certainly suspend gold payments. Mr. B A R U C H . If you start talking about that you would not have a nickeFs worth of gold in the Federal reserve system day after to-morrow. Senator C O N N A L L Y . If the Government did not pay it out it would. Mr. B A R U C H . It would have to pay that on demand. Senator C O N N A L L Y , Of coursie we have to pay it on demand. Mr. B A R U C H . If you start to tak about it or there is any threat to do so that would be the result. Senator C O N N A L L Y . Let us get back to these propositions about value. M r . BARUCH. Y e s . Senator C O N N A L L Y . You say it would then raise the values 3 3 per cent in dollars aU over the countiy? Would it not? Mr. B A R U C H . Are you talking now about internal prices? Senator C O N N A L L Y . Yes. Mr. B A R U C H . Well, export prices in the new dollars would rise, and domestic prices are doubtful. It might have the effect that you say. Senator C O N N A L L Y . Well, do you not think that it would? Mr. B A R U C H . I have my doubts about it. Senator C O N N A L L Y . If the export prices would rise why would not the domestic prices rise? Mr. B A R U C H . NO, these are export prices in new dollars. Senator C O N N A L L Y . I know. I am talking about export prices in new dollars. Mr. B A R U C H . And if they took enough out they would have that tendency to raise prices internally. And even, if they took enough out. Senator, they would rise above present gold prices. Senator C O N N A L L Y . AU right. No matter what we take out, they wiU rise in proportion to what we take out, will they not? Mr. B A R U C H . Not unless you take no more out than you are taking out now. Senator C O N N A L L Y . All right. If export prices rise domestic prices will have to rise with them, will they not? Mr. B A R U C H . Only if you took enough. Yes; export prices. Senator C O N N A L L Y . I mean Mr. B A R U C H . I see what you mean. If export prices rise in the new dollars they will rise inside? Senator C O N N A L L Y . Certainly. Mr.- B A R U C H . I think that is probable; yes. Senator C O N N A L L Y . I S it not true? Mr. B A R U C H . They may not rise a great deal, Senator, but they may rise some. Senator C O N N A L L Y . If a man can get more abroad for a bale of cotton he is going to ship his cotton abroad, unless somebody paid him an equal price internally? M r . BARUCH. Yes. IKVESTIGATION\" OF ECONOMIC PROBLEMS Senator C O N N A L L Y . will they not? SO 30 they wall rise domestically and abroad, M r . BARUCH. Y e s . Senator C O N N A L L Y . All right. You say among the results that we ought to obtain are those that would be obtained through the LaGuardia bill. Mr. BARTJCH. Through what? Senator CoNNAiiLY. The LaGuardia bill; that is a bankruptcy bill. Mr. B A R U C H . Well, I am talking about the principle of the LaGuardia bill, yes. Senator C O N N A L L Y . All right. Your plan there is to devaluate all these people that are owed money through the process of bankruptcy, is it not? M r . BARUCH. Y e s . Senator C O N N A L L Y . What is the difference in devaluating them through the courts and devaluating the money in which they are to be paid? The effect is the same, is it not? Mr. B A R U C H . I do not know. I think it is very different, sir. Senator C O N N A L L Y . Very different? M r . BARUCH. Y e s . Senator C O N N A L L Y . Well, you are depriving the creditor of something when you let the corporation Mr. B A R U C H (interposing). I am depriving the creditor of something that he can not get anyhow. Senator C O N N A L L Y . Certainly. And that is what you are trying to do. The LaGuardia bill would authorize these big corporations and industrial concerns to seek refuge in the Federal courts and hold their creditors off their backs until they could effect a reorganization and a scaling down of their indebtedness. That is what is back of the LaGuardia bill, is it not? Mr. B A R U C H . It is a quickening of a process that is going to take place anyhow. Senator C O N N A L L Y . Well, is not that process going to take place with everybody if we do not do something? Mr. B A R U C H . If you want to go on the road to a place you had better go there right away. Senator C O N N A L L Y . I agree with you. Mr. B A R U C H . But the history of the world has shown this, tibat whenever we have taken that road we have had to come back and retrace our steps. I will admit, Senator, we have already gone very far on it, and the methods that have been adopted and carried on by the Treasury are not very different from those that have been already suggested. Senator C O N N A L L Y . All right. But the process that you propose now is to let corporations and industrial concerns scale their debts by taking refuge in the Federal courts and effecting reorganizations and pay less on the dollar that they owe. That is right, is it not? But you object to giving the benefit of that to everybody by devaluating the dollar and letting everybody have the advantage of that? Mr. B A R U C H . Y O U are doing it by a different method. Senator C O N N A L L Y . Certainly, but it has the same result, has it not? Mr. B A R U C H . Well, there would be the same result, but not to everybody. The only person you are benefiting is the man that has a mortgage; he can not possibly get it and he is not entitled to it. 26 INVESTIGATIOl^r OF ECONOMIC PROBLEMS Senator C O N N A L L Y . Why is he not? He has got a farm. Mr. B A R U C H . Well, yes; because he has bought something, a mortgage or loan, at an unwise time and at a price that is not fair. Senator C O N N A L L Y . That is why I say that it is fair to put this dollar down back to the commodity level and let the debtor pay that creditor in the same relative values as the debt was incurred, and that is your proposition, is it not? Mr. BAETTCH. M y proposition under this natural process, yes. Senator K I N G . Senator, will you pardon me just a moment? Senator C O N N A L L Y . Yes. Senator K I N G . I S the LaGuardia bill limited to corporations? Senator C O N N A L L Y . N O , I do not think so. Senator K I N G . I think it is extended to farmers as well as the individuals, so it is not for the benefit of corporations only, but it is for the liquidation, according to the plan of the bill, of the indebtedness of individuals as well as corporations. Senator C O N N A L L Y . Well, everybody knows, of course, that they would put a Uttle tail on for individuals, but you know an in^vidual when he goes bankrupt comes out with nothing. A corporation that goes into bankruptcy and reorganizes and scales down its debts, its stockholders have something left. Mr. B A R U C H . I do not know the details. I am talldng of the principle of it, and that is to permit debtors and creditors to get together quickly on some agreement. Senator C O N N A L L Y . You and I are not really in disagreement as to results, but we are favoring different methods of reaching the results. In the farm mortgage situation you say that your plan would be to make them take 60 per cent? Mr. B A R U C H . N O , not make them. Senator C O N N A L L Y . Well, but you are going to persuade them? Mr. B A R U C H . Here is what I meant by this. That a mortgagee has got a mortgage for $10,000. He can not foreclose it. If he does go through and forecloses or sells out he is in the farming business and the farmers are out on the highway. So I propose that, and I put a inait of 60 per cent, that if the Government's credit is going to be used you are going to give the mortgagee something that he can not get now, and he can put in his books, and have a value. Senator C O N N A L L Y . Y O U propose that the Government will issue its own bonds and take up farm mortgages' at 60 per cent of their value? Mr. B A R U C H . I am just taking that as a figxu-e. Senator C O N N A L L Y . What is the difference between doing that and revaluing the dollar at 60 per cent and letting them pay their mortgages? Mr. B A R U C H . This is a voluntary agreement between the debtor and the creditor, and the other is not, when you begin to revalue the dollar. Senator C O N N A L L Y . Your plan would work this way: A man that had a gold mortgage that was worth 100 per cent would not agree to this, and he would get his 100 per cent. The fellow that had a mortgage that was not worth 100 per cent would agree, and get the benefit of this. INVESTIGATIOiN' OP ECOJTOMIO PROBLEMS 27 Mr. B A R U C H . The man thcit was rumiijig th6 thing would use wisdom in running it. I would assume some intelligence would be used. Senator C O N N A L L Y . But a man that had a bond worth 100 per cent would not take 60 per cent? M r . BARUCH. NO. Senator C O N N A L L Y . Or a mortgage? M r . BARUCH. NO. Senator C O N N A L L Y . He would get his M r . BARUCH. Y e s . Senator C O N N A L L Y . A man that had 100 per cent? a bond worth 20 per cent would be glad to exchange it for a Government bond and get 60 per cent? Mr. B A R U C H . Or whatever it would be worth. I am sure, Senator, if anybody of inteUigence were running that they would use wisdom in running it. Senator C O N N A L L Y . Y O U have already indicated that the Reconstruction Finance Corporation has made a fizzle and used a lot of guesswork, and it is supposed to have intelligence. I say, in your statement, Mr. Baruch Mr. B A R U C H . I heard you the first time, Senator. Senator C O N N A L L Y . Y O U heard me the first time? Mr. B A R U C H . It is not necessary for you to make a comment upon that, I do not think. Senator C O N N A L L Y . Well, good natured. Mr. B A R U C H . Certainly; I imderstand that, Senator. Senator C O N N A L L Y . Y O U talked about revaluation of the dollar, cutting down the value of it, would ruin all the insurance companies, the policies, did you not, a while ago? Mr. B A R U C H . I said that it would affect the holdings of every one of them, yes. Senator C O N N A L L Y . H O W about your cutting down farm mortgages 60 per cent, in which all the life insurance companies have got their money invested? Mr. B A R U C H . There is a very great difference. Senator. Senator C O N N A L L Y . Would that not impair them Mr, B A R U C H . There is a loss there already in that farm mortgage. Senator C O N N A L L Y . T O be sure, but if the farm mortgage holder has got a mortgage that he can not collect for 100 per cent, and by devaluating the dollar you let the debtor pay 60 cents on the dollar, what is the difference between that and your plan? Mr. B A R U C H . I will tell you exactly. It is just as plain to me as it can be. Senator. It apparently is not plain to you. Senator C O N N A L L Y . NO. I am pretty diunb. Mr. B A R U C H . NO, you are not. We will take an insurance company which has got a mortgage now of $10,000, and it is an unwise one; they can keep it if they want to, but if they go to sell out they will be in the farm business. We will provide a currency in the form of all these mortgages, something that they can not possibly get themselves, and it is a voluntary thing with them, and they are only taking something which is already wiped off from the market. Insurance companies have got those loans, whatever they are, and we can talk about them as much as we want, they will only buy just so much 159450—33 3 28 INVESTIGATIOl^r OF ECONOMIC PROBLEMS in the markets of the world. But those who own the things will buy less in the markets of the world. Senator C O N N ALLY. Well, an ounce of gold has an international value, has it not? M r . BAEUCH. Y e s , sir. Senator C O N N A L L Y . And it means the same everywhere? M r . BARUCH. Y e s , sir. Senator C O N N A L L Y . Well, if you cut down the content of the gold dollar by two-thirds inevitably in gold the values would have to rise, would they not? Mr. B A R U C H . Yes; but you are only going to get two-thirds in the value of the things that you buy. Senator C O N N A L L Y . That is true, but answer my question: Will it rise or go down? Will the prices rise? They will rise, will they not? Mr. B A R U C H . Yes; they will rise, but they will rise to the extent so that that new dollar will not buy any more*^ things than it did before. Senator C O N N A L L Y . It will pay more on your farm mortgages and more on your debts, will it not? Mr. B A R U C H . That it will do. Senator C O N N A L L Y . Yes. Mr. B A R U C H . Senator, without a doubt a farmer who owes money and has got something to sell will be advantaged. Senator C O N N A L L Y . Certainly. Mr. B A R U C H . In the selling side. There is no doubt about that. You can do even better for him by printing paper. Senator C O N N A L L Y . Well, let us stay on the gold a while now. Mr. B A R U C H . All right. Senator C O N N A L L Y . I am not advocating paper. Mr. B A R U C H . I understand that. Senator C O N N A L L Y . I am talking about gold. M r . BARUCH. Y e s . Senator C O N N A L L Y . I am talking about something that you follcs understand in New York—gold. Senator K I N G . Well, Senator, does not your proposition contemplate that notwithstanding an obligation may be to pay so many grains of gold according to the present weight and fineness, that Congress would have the power to modify or rescind that contract and compel the contracting parties to change the contract and accept less grains of gold? Mr. B A R U C H . Well, that is a legal question. Senator K I N G . Well, it is a constitutional question. Senator C O N N A L L Y . Mr. Baruch is not a law^^er and I do not want to get into a legal discussion with him. Mr. B A R U C H . I think I can answer that. Senator C O N N A L L Y . All right. Mr. B A R U C H . The question is this: If you could find a legal method or a scheme whereby if a man demanded payment under a contract which was payable in gold, to tax him a certain percentage. In that way you could wipe off that debt. Senator C O N N A L L Y . Your idea then is that by the taxing power we could stop that? Mr. B A R U C H . I do not know whether it is constitutional or not, but you could do that. Senator C O N N A L L Y . I submit that to the Senator from Utah. IKVESTIGATION\" OF ECONOMIC PROBLEMS 29 Senator G O R E . Y O U have to do it by the rule of apportionment. Mr. B A R U C H . I say that is the scheme. I do not know whether it is constitutional or not. Senator CONNALLY. Senator Gore, you wish to ask something? Senator G O R E . I just remarked that it would have to be done by the rule of apportionment, if done. Senator CONNALLY. But we would treat them all alike, of course. Senator G O R E . It would have to be apportioned among the States. Senator CONNALLY. Le"
