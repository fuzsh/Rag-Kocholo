        "text": "Loud Minds, the high-end factual and drama indie established by Tim Haines (Walking with Dinosaurs, Primeval, The Loch), has announced that Will Aslett and Emma Parkin have joined its growing team, both in pivotal development roles.\n\nAslett, an experienced, award-winning writer, executive producer and senior development executive, now takes the lead as head of development for Loud Minds’ unscripted content, tasked with growing and managing its cross-genre programming slate. Aslett is one of the UK’s most highly regarded specialist factual executives and has held senior roles at Nutopia, Pioneer Productions, Impossible Pictures and the BBC. He joined Loud Minds from Wall to Wall where he was showrunner on its four-part Netflix series Earthstorm. Before that he was SVP development at Cineflix Media, working across its specialist factual output in the UK, US and Canada, including Patrick Aryee’s Wild World for Sky. Aslett was part of the team that developed the BAFTA-winning series Coast (BBC Two), he won an Emmy Award for Perfect Disaster (Channel 5/Discovery/ProSieben/M6), an Emmy and Banff Rockie Award for Richard Hammond’s Journey to the Centre of the Planet (BBC One/Discovery) and a Broadcast Award for BBC Four’s Afterlife. Other credits include Pompeii: The Mystery of Bodies Frozen in Time (BBC One/Discovery), Naked Science (National Geographic) and Cutting Edge (Channel 4).\n\nParkin becomes development executive at Loud Minds, reporting directly into Aslett. She joins from Pioneer Productions, where she was AP on a yet to be announced feature documentary. Prior to that, her previous experience includes AP on Dinosaurs with Stephen Fry (Channel 5) at Mentorn Media, senior researcher on Our Living World (Netflix) at Wild Space Productions, and AP on Limitless with Chris Hemsworth (National Geographic) while working for Nutopia.\n\nTim Haines, founder and creative director at Loud Minds says: “We are delighted to welcome Will and Emma to our expanding team. Will is a world class senior development executive and supremely skilled at helping to create and deliver the sort of epic, smart and engaging global factual content for which we are known. Emma, meanwhile, brings a valuable scientific background, a brilliantly inquiring and creative mind, plus a talent for managing large scale international shoots. Together, they make a formidable addition to our evolving business and are the perfect team to supercharge our slate, which in turn will ensure we can deliver on both our creative and growth ambitions.”\n\nAslett comments: “In Loud Minds, Tim Haines has created a vibrant and exciting new business and I am thrilled to be part of the team – and indeed to have the chance to work with him for the second time in my career. Tim is a visionary and his plans for the business now provide me with an incredible opportunity. Not only do I get to work in areas I already know well, but I also get the chance to explore and develop different genres and types of content that will drive a range of audiences and be successful across various platforms in the international marketplace.”\n\nLoud Minds’ first major series, Surviving Earth, is currently in production with Universal Television Alternative Studio. The 8 x 60, multi-million-dollar series for NBC and Peacock tells the fascinating story of eight mass extinction moments throughout the Earth’s history, to see what the planet’s past can tell us about its future. Featuring global locations and high-end CGI, it will be one of the most ambitious, cinematic, and dramatic high-concept series produced to date."
