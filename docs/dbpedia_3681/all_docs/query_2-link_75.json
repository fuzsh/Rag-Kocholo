        "text": "I absolutely love people who work the night shift in hospitals as they are inevitably a little bit different, more peculiar than “normal”. My father worked as an ER doctor on the night shift for 30+ years and I frequently got to spend time there for one reason or another. I loved playing in the lounge, getting the scoop on interesting patients and illicitly watching episodes of Doctor Who (scared me to death, which did not please my mother). Night shift people are a breed apart, always a little odd with a delectably twisted sense of humor. This new NBC show captures their spirit very well although there is a bit of unnecessary focus on who’s hooking up with whom and other personal drama, but that’s simply an issue of taste on my part. I think I’m more interested in the patients, but becoming emotional invested in the characters is also a good thing and exploring their interpersonal relationships is perhaps a necessary component for a well-rounded show. I first saw Irish actor Eoin Macken as the irrepressible Gawain on BBC’s Merlin and I’m pleased to see he’s playing another ebullient maverick of a character. Dr. TC Callahan, along with a lot of the other staff, are ex-military and most have served in hot zones overseas. It has altered them in different ways, which adds an extra dimension to the out-of-the-box thinking required for an effective ER and I love anything that reflects well on (and thus supports) the armed services. Although for dramatic purposes the events of what in real life would be spread out over a few weeks are compressed into a single night to comprise an episode, I do like the never-ending stream of truly bizarre stuff that wanders through the doors of this San Antonio hospital. It’s lovely to see Ken Leung, a Lost alumnus, playing Dr. Topher Zia, and hats off to Freddy Rodriguez playing obnoxious bean counting administrator Michael Ragosa. There’s a nice cross-section of people represented by the cast and it didn’t take more than a few episodes for me to know I was really going to enjoy this show. The inevitable drama and ethical dilemmas are beautifully counter-balanced with some inspired humor which I think represents an accurate portrait of what life in an ER is really like. Hopefully this will not devolve into nothing more than a medical flavored soap opera but partway through the second season, I still really like what I see. – BETHANY\n\nFor actors’ filmographies, interesting trivia and other details, visit: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2477230/?ref_=nv_sr_1\n\nTC and Dr. Jordan Alexander (Jill Flint) – believe it or not, ERs are rife with unexpected humor.\n\nA soldier from a nearby military base shamelessly hitting on Dr. Krista Bell-Hart (Jeananne Goossen).\n\nProbably not the smartest move to get out of control in an ER filled with ex-military, like Dr. Drew Alister (Brendan Fehr).\n\nOK, which one of you clowns took my shirt (again)? Nurse Kenny, who doesn’t seem unhappy with the situation, with Dr. Paul Cummings and Drew.\n\nDr. Topher Zia (Ken Laung) reminds TC that while it would be satisfying, perpetrating violence on the person of Ragosa won’t solve the immediate problem.\n\nA flashback to TC’s time as a medic which taught him valuable and often unconventional skills.\n\nEuropean royalty in the ER – oh, that old chestnut.\n\n(Found on Pinterest)\n\nPhotos courtesy of Sachs/Judah Productions, Sony Pictures Television and NBC.\n\nThis is one crazy sexy show! Teen Wolf is a rather self-explanatory title as the main character, Scott McCall, is bitten in the woods and becomes a werewolf. Not to be confused with the Michael J. Fox movie of the same name, this show is a big hit for MTV and justifiably so. It’s a supernatural teen drama but done so well as to be appealing to persons of any age. Well, I wouldn’t recommend it for the 12 and under crowd, but I’m sure you probably already knew that. If you want a werewolf show more appropriate for a younger audience, I highly recommend Wolfblood, a British show with a less scary more innocent quality. Teen Wolf has quite a lot of content I would characterize as spine-chilling and of a blatantly sexual nature, but it’s done tastefully and with masterful artistry. There’s a great cast of characters making up the ensemble, many of which are strong females who can kick, er, behind with the best of them. The writers have incorporated legends and mythology from all over the world and it’s a real pleasure to watch a show with more than just “standard” supernatural beings. Beacon Hills features exotic denizens of Celtic mythology, Japanese folklore, Tibetan traditions, Norse sagas, Native American tales and Aztec legend, with nary a witch or vampire in sight. The werewolves themselves have an intricate societal structure and possess abilities that go far beyond mere transformation.\n\nVisually breathtaking with magnificent special effects, this is an edge-of-your-seat thrill ride that’s insanely addictive. Each character is beautifully drawn and a large part of the show is comprised of all the complicated relationships between them. Of course because most of the main characters are in high school, much of the social interactions are heightened. Teenagers always think the smallest things are an issue of life and death, although to be fair, for this group it may very well be the literal truth. Great writing, nimble dialogue and inspired plot lines make this so much more than the vacuous supernatural melodrama it might appear to be at first glance. Dark but not depressing, slick but not pat, this is a wildly innovative show that isn’t afraid to do the unexpected or even the unthinkable. It’s easy to get swept up by all the bizarre happenings in Beacon Hills because everything feels so real, quite a feat given the subject material. Multifaceted mysteries, perfectly crafted scares and suspense plus genuine interpersonal relationships have intersected to produce this incredibly popular show, soon to premiere its 5th season. Sprinkled with humor and perspicacity that feels authentic while maintaining its eerie Gothic aura, this show is a masterpiece and I hope it runs for many more seasons. – BETHANY\n\nFor more information on the extremely talented cast, visit: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1567432/?ref_=nv_sr_1\n\nI hope you enjoy this meticulously chosen gallery of pictures.

The remnants band together to fight a guerrilla style resistance, trying to survive in the shattered remains of our civilization. Noah Wyle plays Tom Mason, a history professor, father of three boys and now part of the Second Massachusetts, a ragtag “regiment” named in honor of one in the American Revolution. Their leader is Col. Weaver, played by one of my favorite underrated actors, Will Patton, whom I absolutely fell in love with in Armageddon. The aliens are well thought out and complex, and just what do they really want? Actually the whole thing is creatively inspired, forcing the viewer to think about how you would go about rebuilding society. Would the U.S. Constitution still apply? What changes might be necessary for a government to be effective? And is it even important to think about this stuff when you’re fighting just to stay alive? The world might be all but destroyed but life goes on and it’s fascinating to watch how each character deals with the new reality. Tom Mason’s youngest son Matt, played by Maxim Knight, breaks your heart as he bravely totes around a gun bigger than he is. The show addresses a lot of issues while still being entertaining and engrossing. The special effects are top notch, on the level with big Hollywood movie productions, which allows for a totally immersive experience that feels very real. Dark without losing hope and gritty without dwelling on the negative, Falling Skies celebrates the human will to live. Ordinary people put in extraordinary circumstances; some exemplify grace under pressure and others let their baser natures take over. A vast assortment of interesting characters and creative plots make this one of my favorite summer shows and I love it despite the cliffhanger season finales that make you wait a whole year to resolve the bombshell and believe me, each one is a doozy! – BETHANY\n\nIf you’re a detail-oriented person, the Internet Movie Database will make your day! http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1462059/?ref_=nv_sr_1\n\nThis is a mechanical robot, dubbed Mechs.

Television\n\nI wasn’t sure about this series at first but I’m glad I gave it the benefit of the doubt and kept watching. This is a sub-genre of science fiction that feels like a Western. If you liked Firefly (and frankly who didn’t? Well, obviously not the network that cancelled it) you’ll probably enjoy this one too as it has a gritty gunslinger vibe to it. The premise is quite unique and complex but I’ll try to break it down for you. A group of aliens, made up of a bunch of different races but collectively called the Votans, invaded earth and began terraforming it to suit their needs (for help sorting all of this out in detail, consult http://en.defiance-wiki.com/wiki/Defiance_Wiki). Humanity fought back and eventually a wary peace allowed humans and aliens to live together on a world that is largely unrecognizable as Earth. Defiance, née St. Louis, is the setting for the show and is absolutely bursting at the seams with aliens of all sorts as well as humans. It’s kind of Casablanca but with extra-terrestrials added into the mix, or the Cantina scene at Mos Eisley Spaceport from Star Wars: A New Hope made into its own TV show. An ex-military drifter named Joshua Nolan (Grant Bowler) and his adopted Irathient daughter, Irisa, land in Defiance where Nolan takes the job of Lawkeeper. It’s a rough town with all kinds of problems but the mayor, played by Julie Benz, is determined to make it work. The different alien races are very well done, each with their own language and culture. Datak Tarr (Tony Curran), a ruthless Castithan with less-than-legal businesses is interesting, but his wife Stahma is the real puppet master. She speaks softly and seems subservient and dutiful but she’s more than just a pretty face. Actually, most all the characters are not what they seem, which is always entertaining. Extremely creative with great writing, this is a wonderful and incredibly complicated show that appeals on many levels. There are mysteries all over the place which keep your interest, much like Lost in that respect. I have come to really care about these characters and it’s fascinating to watch them build a whole new society that fits their new reality. Full of ethical dilemmas, interpersonal relationships, romance and less than savory elements, this is really good sci-fi. – BETHANY\n\nIf you know you’ve seen one of these faces somewhere else but can’t think here, visit IMDB before your brain overheats, trying in vain to remember: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2189221/?ref_=nv_sr_1\n\nLeft to right: Datak and Stahma Tarr, Amanda and Kenya Rosewater, Joshua Nolan, Irisa Nolan, and Rafe McCawley\n\nStahma Tarr, played by Jaime Murray (Photo courtesy of Defiance: Behind the Makeup, http://www.denofgeek.us)\n\nThe cross-species Romeo and Juliet, Christie McCawley (Nicole Muñoz) and Alak Tarr (Jesse Rath).\n\nKenya Rosewater (Mia Kirshner), proprietor of the Need/Want, a bar/brothel.\n\nLinda Hamilton and if I tell you her character’s name, it would be a spoiler.\n\nJessica Rainier (Anna Hopkins), nicknamed “Berlin” because she makes propaganda videos for the Earth Republic, and Lawkeeper Joshua Nolan (Grant Bowler).\n\nAlak and Stahma Tarr.

Each one was so obvious that I kept being continually yanked out of my suspension of disbelief, making it very difficult to enjoy the movie. I don’t mind that the solution in every disaster movie seems to involve nuclear bombs (asteroid heading for earth? Blow it up with a bomb. Volcano erupting? Cork it with a bomb. Earthquake imminent? Fuse the tectonic plates with a bomb.), but Impact committed the cardinal sin of assuming the audience was full of idiots. There are some movies (Syfy channel, I’m looking at you) that are so very bad that they’re enjoyable on a funny level. This one wasn’t bad enough to be included in their number because in all fairness the acting was quite good. There were some good special effects with the moon, but it’s obvious they spent their entire budget on them with none left over for anything else, such as scientific advisers. A huge tanker ship floats out of the water when gravity evidently is in “flux”, which looks good but what is keeping the water from floating up as well? They spend a lot of time illustrating the catastrophic damage inflicted by the moon’s near orbit but then for 20 odd days while they’re planning a space mission all the chaos conveniently stops, because hey, they’re working here! Since the moon is getting closer with every orbit, wouldn’t that imply the devastation would get correspondingly worse with each passing day? Perhaps one problem was the movie was just so exceedingly long (over 3 hours!), which gave my brain time to think [I’ve since learned this was originally a TV mini-series, so the length can be forgiven]. The concept of a Near Earth Object hitting the moon was good, but the script misses the boat on how it would really affect our planet. There’s three hours of my time I won’t see again, unless the next disaster movie I see involves reversing the polarity of the space time continuum. – BETHANY\n\nFor help redeeming these actors by seeing what else they’ve been in, see the Internet Movie Database: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1227637/?ref_=fn_al_tt_2\n\nRoland Emerson (Benjamin Sadler), Dr. Maddie Rhodes (Natasha Henstridge), and Alex Kittner (David James Elliott) whose roles in this film are described as “leading scientists”.\n\nThe aftermath of gravitational “flux”\n\nLloyd (James Cromwell), his grandkids and Alex stare up at the sky.\n\n“These numbers can’t possibly be right!

The premise is simple, with “anomalies” opening up around England, serving as doorways to Earth both past and future. But the long-term ramifications are incredibly complex, making this about much more than dinosaurs causing mayhem in the modern world. Brilliantly creative while also being quietly educational, I absolutely fell in love with the show and its oddball array of characters. Funny, clever, thought-provoking and incredibly entertaining, every episode was a must-not-miss thrill ride, beautifully balancing the “anomaly of the week” with long story arcs that slowly develop over time. Characters come and go, often in gut-wrenching ways, but everything feels organic rather than done just for shock value. Gorgeous special effects and imaginative creatures underpinned by solid science, the show was also incredibly funny in that dry British way I love so much. I’ve got to acknowledge an underrated actor (Ben Miller) playing the often-overlooked character of James Lester, admittedly a bit of a stuffed shirt bureaucrat who’d pretty much rather die than let you know he cares, but who also exemplifies the quintessential unflappable Brit in a natty suit, always quick with a scathing witticism delivered with impeccable timing. My only complaint is that there weren’t more seasons (there were at least five though), but hopefully the continuing popularity of the original Primeval online will spark the interest of another network. There was a short lived Canadian version entitled Primeval: New World, but it didn’t hold a candle to this one and was cancelled quickly. – BETHANY\n\nTo help sort out the characters, actors and various whatnots comprising this show, consult IMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808096/?ref_=nv_sr_1 and this rather brilliant Wiki site: http://primeval.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page\n\nBehold an anomaly, which looks much cooler in the show, as all the glass-like shards spin.

It seemed a bit cheesy but I’m glad I kept watching because it has blossomed into something amazing. The premise is simple, that of Jane Rizzoli, a blue collar background homicide detective teamed up with brilliantly intelligent and always chic Dr. Maura Isles, the medical examiner. But this is so much more than just a police procedural and calling it a buddy cop show would also be doing it a disservice. Once you get to know the cast of core characters, you’ll find this is focused more on their personal lives and relationships, with the cop stuff serving to highlight the realistic dynamics at play between all of them. Since most people balance a work life and a personal life, this approach feels more authentic and allows you to thoroughly invest in all the finely drawn characters. There’s a great mix of drama, suspense, emotion and humor, pretty much the perfect cocktail for great entertainment. Angie Harmon is spot-on as Jane, a pretty but tough cop who grew up with two brothers, Frankie and Tommy (Jordan Bridges and Colin Egglesfield respectively). She’s the complete opposite of Maura, played by Sasha Alexander, who loves heels, is always wearing something fashionable and can quote obscure facts on just about anything. Jane’s practicality and street smarts plus Maura’s expertise and sophistication combine to create not only a very believable friendship but also a great partnership as they tend to balance one another out. I really don’t know why people have latched on to the idea that Moira and Jane are secretly lesbian lovers, as this is never implied in the show. They’re good friends who have plenty of male love interests, so settle down, you internet pervs! Everything on this show feels natural and organic with nothing done for shock value. Of course there’s adult relationships portrayed and some pretty horrific crime scenes and general police business involved, but none of it is shown simply to thrill the audience. I’d love these characters no matter what line of work they were in, which should tell you the writing is top notch. Now renewed for a sixth season, I absolutely love this engaging show and highly recommend it to anyone. – BETHANY\n\nCheck out the Internet Movie Database for detailed cast information and interesting trivia about the production: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1551632/\n\nDr. Maura Isles (Sasha Alexander), ever the fashion plate (photo courtesy of http://www.fanpop.com)\n\nJane Rizzoli (Angie Harmon) and fellow detective Vince Korsak (Bruce McGill)\n\nMaura tries to introduce Jane to meditation, with limited success.\n\nChoosing the right footwear for a crime scene can be crucial.\n\nFrankie Rizzoli, Jr (Jordan Bridges) and Jane\n\nJane’s brothers, Frankie and Tommy (Colin Egglesfield)\n\nDetective Frost (Lee Thompson Young), Jane and Korsak\n\nJane’s old flame, Casey Jones (Chris Vance)\n\nFBI agent Gabriel Dean (Billy Burke), and a romantic interest for Jane (see a pattern?

I’ll admit the premise does have quite a few plot holes, but I was enjoying myself so much that I told my brain to shut up and quit trying to apply logic where it wasn’t wanted. Eric Dane does a great job being the stoic commander of the naval destroyer USS Nathan James, as does Adam Baldwin, the XO, who seems to thrive in military tough-guy roles. Rhona Mitra is excellent as a virologist who hopefully will have more luck than the one in World War Z and Sam Spruell, playing her associate Quincy, is thankfully no longer sporting the dire blonde paigeboy haircut inflicted on us in Snow White & The Huntsman.\n\nIt would be very easy to pick apart the plot of The Last Ship (a “primordial strain” of the virus frozen in the Arctic ice? Really? And how is this the last ship? What about naval aircraft carriers that can and do stay at sea for up to 5 years at a time, and what would be the point of weaponizing a virus already spreading out of control? Has the virus reached McMurdo air force base in Antarctica and if so, how? Because otherwise that would be a great base of operations), but even I have to acknowledge that if you’ve studied anything about the really virulent viruses out there like Ebola, Hantavirus, various hemorrhagic fevers, etc., there is absolutely no good reason why they haven’t already wiped out humanity. No cure, no vaccine, close to a 100% fatality rate, why do pandemics eventually stop? Perhaps it is only a matter of time until one comes around that won’t stop, which is why I think I’m going to like this show. Just realistic enough to enjoy but not weighed down by unnecessary technical and logistical details, I’m already itching for the next episode.

Television (unless otherwise noted)\n\nI am not a fan of Stephen King, but fortunately I did not know this was based on one of his books when I started watching, otherwise I never would have given it a shot. Obviously I have not read the book, so my review is purely objective and based solely on the merits of the show itself. The premise is deceptively simple, featuring a mysterious dome that comes crashing down on Chester’s Mill, completely cutting the town off from the outside world (and splitting a cow in half – yuck! And they show it over and over and over …). But the premise of Lost was simple too, an airliner crashing on a mysterious island somewhere in the Pacific, and that show had one of the most detailed and complex narratives ever. The comparison is apropos, as there are layers upon layers of mysteries and questions, both under the dome and about the dome itself, and nobody is really what they seem. But unlike Lost where everything was an unknown, part of the creepiness factor in this show is due to a familiar environment suddenly becoming alien and hostile. Secrets come to light and lots of things that would otherwise have remained hidden are suddenly thrust to the fore. There’s plenty of talent here with a huge cast of characters, but getting an acting job on this show isn’t likely to be long term as more characters tend to get whacked here than on Game of Thrones (which is really saying something!). There is great character development throughout, as each person changes and evolves to the point that it’s hard to know if there are any clear cut good or bad guys. The show does ask great questions, such as if the “government” requires you to surrender your guns for the safety of the general public, it also follows that only said government will then have readily available weapons. Is this a good thing or a bad thing? Life under the dome acts as a microcosm for the larger world, illustrating the practical and the not-so-practical tenets of civilized free society. I think it’s fascinating and enjoyed the second season as much as I did the first. – BETHANY\n\nDeputy Linda Esquivel (Natalie Martinez) discovers you can look but you can’t touch.\n\nDale “Barbie” Barbara” (Mike Vogel) illustrates you also can’t hear through the Dome.\n\nAngie McAlister (Britt Robertson), Joe McAlister (Colin Ford) and Elinore “Norrie” Calvert-Hill (Mackenzie Lintz).

Travers in order to prepare for her role and described the experience as “like being poked in the ear with hot forks!”. To say the author of the Mary Poppins books was abrasive is an understatement, but her disparaging antics and quick wit were hilarious to watch. Describing Los Angeles as smelling of “chlorine and sweat”? Priceless! Thompson nails her personality but also shows there was a reason for her prickly exterior and the movie does a beautiful job showing how she poured her painful past into her books. If you’ve read the Mary Poppins books, you know they are actually quite dark, so I can see why the tinkly sweetness of most Disney movies would have revolted the author. “I know what he’s going to do to her. She’ll be cavorting, and twinkling, careening towards a happy ending like a kamikaze.” Tom Hanks is spot on as Walt Disney, who was actually a relative of Hanks, and he’s mastered Disney’s characteristic drawling speech. I’m so glad Hanks fought for authenticity in depicting that Disney really did smoke but was ashamed of his habit, despite the objections the studio raised about including an image of the company’s founder that runs counter to the Disney brand. While the pugnacious exchanges between Travers and Disney are great, it’s the interactions between Travers and the chauffeur, played by Paul Giamatti, that really deserve accolades. Their tacit affinity for one another and quiet understanding is really something to see. This is a gentle introspective sort of movie with real class and much of the action is of an internal nature. Bittersweet, enchanting, haunting and unbelievably funny, I absolutely loved it, but be warned, this will get all the songs from Mary Poppins thoroughly stuck in your head.
