        "text": "Introduction to Part 4\n\nContrary to what Pat Winslow thinks, I never kept a journal or diary. Proof of that is two stories that I forgot completely. For instance, the Friends Story, which belongs to part 1. The 1982 Story, which should be in part 2. The truth is that there are big holes in my recollective powers. The 1989-90 Story was easier to recall. In 13 parts, it deals with the most important 18 months of my life.\n\nIts been a struggle to get this done. Bed sores, pop-up viruses, chunks of erased writing, eye fatigue, many lost writing days, sleepless nights, etc. Writing is my one form of artistic expression.\n\nUp till now, because of my paralysis and bed-bound life, hours were spent reflecting on my past. I had a lot of early morning remembering sessions. IMDb was used a lot. This time, a host of friends provided me with invaluable information and details. Mike Morrissey has been most helpful, so was Richard Jackson, Gurbinder Singh Sahota, my brother Ljuba Vukovic, Phil Croskin, David Ferry. I must thank my volunteer research assistant, Nicole Adams. My muse, friend and encourager-in-chief, Gwenyth Dobie, responsible for putting it online.\n\nHope you enjoy it…\n\n1980-90 Story Part 1\n\nOn January 4th 1989, I spent my second night at the sublet, that Martin Sadofski, an actor in my play, had found for me. He was at drama school with an actress called Jane Lancaster, who was on tour while I was in her flat. It was on Willesden Lane. Had spent the last week in the Alicante area of Spain, with my poker school, where I enjoyed a terrific new year, with a delicious buffet, with lots of local wine, spirits and delicious Spanish brandy. Plus poker every night. Flew back to London the previous day, where I´d carefully packed all my stuff. When I unpacked at the Kilburn flat, I realized that I’d forgotten my cricket bag, with pads, cricket shoes, whites, a club sweater, but most of all my Grey Nichols bat. I´d scored a lot of runs with that piece of wood. Next day, I went to the Primrose Hill flat, which, because I landed a big movie, on which I´d spent many weeks, and with the big money I´d earned, had enabled us to buy, some 5 years before. I´d gone there to find that my key wouldn’t open the door.\n\nI was bitter about my cricket gear that Doe, my ex-girlfriend, changed the Yale lock, preventing me from retrieving it. Still, it was winter, I wouldn’t be playing the game any time soon. It felt good to be finally away from that toxic relationship. The furnished basement apartment was comfortable, with 2 bedrooms and a living room, spacious bathroom with a shower, fitted kitchen. Michael Morrissey, the director of my play, Kingdom Come, which would be starting rehearsals in 10 days, would get the train down to London in a week. We still had an actress to find, but actresses were fairly easy to find at the last minute. We had a free rehearsal room, that my poker mate, Kevin O´Shea had provided for us. It was a great space, which I´d seen a couple of weeks before. It was at a large, unusual architectural building called the Business Design Centre, a short distance from Highbury and Islington station, which had a direct connection to Kilburn, where my sublet was. We would take the North London Line, which is a regular train. The nice thing about this flat, was that I had a black Tom cat for company. We had never possessed a pet at home. My mum was a cleanliness freak, and would not have animals in the house. I loved animals as a kid, so I welcomed the black cat to pet. I was responsible for buying his food too.\n\nThere was a fair deal for me to do in the next week. First, I had to contact my solicitor, my old friend, Brendan Kelly. However, I had to wait for the Christmas season to end, in a couple of days. My money situation was not looking great. It would be a struggle to put together the next month’s rent. I was unavailable for work until March. Of course, I´d told my agent not to put me up for anything. Doing my own project for no money, did not exactly endear me to my agents. It was the new year, so a quiet time. Still, I was relying on the settlement money to get me through. Rent was well over triple of what I was paying for my share of the mortgage. It was my decision to leave. The consequences were mine. I had to talk to Mike, the director and Dom Boydell, stage manager. Mike had offered the other female part to a former student of Manchester Poly, Julia Gilbert fitted my desire for a pretty girl in the part, she was based in London. Mike said that he could cast my mistress when he showed up in London. I didn’t now have the use of a car. When the money came in, I would scout for one. Also, there was the problem of finding somewhere permanent to live in 3 month’s time.\n\nIt was time to unpack, relax, bathe myself, shop, learn and look at my lines: it was the Tito character, with a ton of Marxist-Leninist dialogue, which wouldn’t be easy. It was a 15 minute walk up to the Kilburn High Road, where the supermarket and other shops were. I would trek there every couple of days. The cat and I had to be fed. He would spend all night prowling the local streets. He was affectionate, and he would come in, be fed, and be stroked. To tell the truth, it felt good to be finally on my own. I´d always been a loner. Relief was felt, not having to deal with a chain smoking drunk most nights. Although part of the reason for it, (me breaking her trust) was certainly of my making.\n\nI´d not checked in with Brendan Kelly since before Spain, so when everything was open, I rang him. Got through to him and asked what was the status of the compensation claim? He said that he’d been in touch with Doe´s representatives, and they were still negotiating. He asked me to call him in a week. It was important to call Kevin O´Shea, to confirm that the hall of the Business Design Centre was on for the rehearsal period? He gave us the okay, but on a couple of days towards the end of rehearsals, there were lectures and presentations in the hall. I said that it wasn’t a problem at all. We would take days off. I thanked him a lot for this money-saving help. Then, I called Dom, the stage manager. He had the cast´s numbers, so he´d give everyone their calls to attend the first rehearsal on a week Monday. He said that he would.\n\nTime passed. It was the day that Michael Morrissey should arrive. I wasn’t sure which train he´d be on. Euston Station wasn’t that far from Kilburn, so he could take a cab. He arrived at the flat in the evening. It was great to see him again, we hugged, and I showed him to his bedroom. He spent a while unpacking. I took him on a tour around the flat. We had a cup of tea and later, a meal. The black cat came in. Mike was a cat lover, he and Melanie had a couple of them. He said hello. We looked at the script. He made some not too painful cuts. After that, we discussed who we would cast as Tanya, my mistress in the play. Mike said that he would call some agents the following morning and we would hold auditions the next day. I should book the rehearsal room that afternoon. I don’t know how Mike did it, but a couple of days later, in the rehearsal room, we saw someone absolutely perfect for the part. We did not see any actresses but Kate Gartside. We didn’t even need to audition her. Her CV spoke for itself. Not only that, she was a gorgeous red head. I gave her a copy of the script. So the cast was complete. We would begin rehearsals on the Monday.\n\nThe day came. We headed down to the over ground station, to catch the North London Line train to Highbury & Islington station. It was a quick journey, about 20 minutes. The Business Design Centre was just a minute from the station. We went to see Kevin O´Shea at his office within the complex. He took us to the hall. It was probably the most luxurious rehearsal room in London. Fully carpeted, spacious, natural light, two tables, stacks of chairs on one wall. I could see that Mike was pleased. Soon, Dom, the stage manager showed up. I asked him to go to the main entrance and guide the actors to the room. Mike and I spread the chairs in a circle. Before long, the actors started arriving. There were greetings and then we all sat down to begin the read-through. Michael Morrissey said a little speech, introducing himself, and each actor said their name and the parts that they were playing. As we started reading, I experienced a tremendous high. My words, on which I had invested so much, were ringing round the room. I was not expecting this. Writers must surely get a thrill, when their plays are first read. Suddenly, it was time for me to read. I put my head down and concentrated. The read-through passed swiftly. Rod Smith, as King Karol and in the second half, the referee, who chased Fantasia for their unpaid debts, was fantastic. In fact, everyone was brave and strong. The afternoon was spent blocking. Mike had the brilliant idea of staging crowd scenes, where the whole cast formed a bunch of fans, watching a soccer game. Complete with uhs and ahs, cheers, boos.\n\nRehearsals continued. Everybody was doing my words a lot more than justice. Kate Gartside, my mistress, started wearing shorts during rehearsals, with stockings and heels. I thought that this was brave acting, which they encouraged us to practice at the Royal Shakespeare Company. I admired her acting ability, she was spectacular in the part. Sadly, I can’t say that those feelings were reciprocated. She disliked me from the beginning. This mystified me, because I behaved in a civilized manner to everyone, especially women. However, it didn’t bother me. The chemistry worked in rehearsal: which is the most important thing. I was amazed at Rod Smith´s emerging performance. Here was a person from Birmingham (a Brummie) not the least interested in sport. Yet here he was, speaking in a Northern accent, being a totally believable soccer manager.\n\nEverything went smoothly. Michael Morrissey was well in charge of the production. Everyone respected him. Like me, he thought that music was a vital element in any production. Mike had a lot of knowledge about popular music. But I suspect that Martin Sadofski, who had his finger on the pulse of the Indie Music Scene would contribute ideas. Together, I believe that they would choose to use the music from one perfect rock band, who the audience would hear frequently during the show. The band was called The Wedding Present. The main songwriter was of Ukrainian descent, and often, the songs would use traditional Slavonic motifs. It was absolutely ideal for the spirit of my play.\n\nOn the day off, because our rehearsal room was being used by the Business Design Centre, I arranged to see Brendan Kelly, my solicitor. The tube journey was quite long, from west to east. I finally arrived and had a meeting with Brendan. He said that he’d been in regular touch with Doe´s representatives. He said that it looked positive and expected a check within a week.\n\nAfter 10 days of rehearsals, Mike and I decided to throw a party in my sublet. We primed ourselves up by consuming a number of magic mushrooms before the party. It was to be on the last Saturday night of the rehearsal period. To tell the truth, I invited some girls who I wanted to get to know better. Lali, the Croatian woman, I´d met at Jason’s party, a few weeks before I left our flat. Some of the cast would be there, plus friends, celebrating my new found bachelorhood. It would get the cast to know each other better, and to see the director let his hair down and enjoy himself. The night came and earlier in the day, we went and stocked up with booze and eats. The night came and a bunch of people turned up. Sandra Chalmers started hallucinating on the mushrooms, while giggling.\n\nThen, completely unexpectedly, Doe showed up. How did she find out about the party? Remember, Doe was fiendishly intelligent. She asked me, nicely, to come for a walk with her? I had no choice but to go. We went out on the streets of Kilburn, where she tried to convince me to come back to her. It reminded me of the time she´d come down to the Aldwych Theatre in the West End in 1981. This time, it was different. She was persuading me to return to the her, as a couple? 7 years before, I was persuading her to not go into the stage door, and confront the actress that I’d had an affair with months ago. She’d dumped me well before we had left Stratford-upon-Avon. Since then, we had a long period in Newcastle, where she came up for the weekend, me booking a room in a luxury hotel. The Aldwych episode was in summer, in stark contrast to the dark Kilburn streets. We must have spent more than a couple of hours out there. There was no way that I’d go back to that relationship. I was happy now. Determined to stay single. Thankfully, she drove back to her apartment. Later, I concluded that this behavior was her way of exorcizing our relationship. Wouldn’t hear from her for the next 2 months. I returned to the party, which was beginning to come to its end. Was pretty pissed off because I didn’t get chance to chat-up other women.\n\nRehearsals went on. I was running out of money fast. It was astonishing how expensive London was. Paying full rent, which was roughly a third more as our entire mortgage at Primrose Hill. This was Kilburn, no where as fashionable an area as Primrose Hill. Plus I had to pay for my food, rather than half. Because it was the beginning of February, and quiet as far as actor’s work was concerned. Everyone was now off book. Under Morrissey´s inspiring direction, the show was on track.\n\nLess than a week later, I received a message from Brendan Kelly. The cheque was there. I made my way to Brendan´s office to pick up Doe´s cheque. My first impression was favourable. It seemed generous. Now, I realize that the current price of properties in areas like Primrose Hill, have literally, exploded. I know that she was still there in 2004. Unwittingly, I set Doe up for life. I´ll repeat this: it was my talent that got me King David, which enabled me to put down a large deposit on the flat. I have no regrets. Life was much happier for me without Doe.\n\nIt was time to move into the White Bear Theatre. I must say that rehearsals had gone swimmingly. The overall standard of acting was excellent. The whole 8 members of the cast were compelling and funny. Rod Smith as King Karol was fantastic. The other stand out was Kate as my mistress. She continued to dislike me, but on stage, she was thoroughly professional. Martin, his girlfriend, Sandra and Dom, arranged for the soccer kit, shirts, shorts, socks and even black, matching rubber soled soccer boots. These were delivered well in time. I strongly suggest that Martin´s gorgeous girlfriend, Sandra Chalmers was behind it. She had a sexy, charming voice, and could get strangers to eat out of her hand within 5 minutes. I wish that she’d been with a few of us when, one evening, after rehearsals, we visited the offices of Time Out and City Limits: the two weekly what’s-on magazines. Martin Sadofski´s house-mate and member of his band, Peter Richardson, was a skilled graphic designer, who had made a wonderful poster with handouts. We called our company The Kowalski Institute. It was a tribute to Stanley Kowalski, the character played by Marlon Brando, in Tennessee Williams´ A Streetcar Named Desire. I´d called the company that name on our trip to London, 14 years before for the National Student Drama Festival. Brando was, at that time, a “method” actor, who we all much admired, so we decided to call our company after that character. The producer, Roy Mitchell, had paid for the printing. I left a short synopsis of the play with each magazine, which was published in both magazines, to tell potential audiences what would be running, at our theatre, and at what times. To tell the truth, there were such an overwhelming number of shows in London, that it was a long shot that a reviewer would come. Besides, the White Bear was in its first year of operation. In the years to come, it would become a well-known fringe venue. It was pointless trying to get the national papers to review it. I was totally unknown as a playwright, as well as pretty much everything else. In the end, no reviewers would come to see the show. We told every cast member to invite everyone they knew.\n\nWe had the technical and dress rehearsals. No problems. The music by The Wedding Present was perfect. The show was imaginatively blocked. The house technician helped with the lighting design. There was practically no set. Just 8 high energy actors. The actresses, Kate Gartside, Jude Sharp and Julia Gilbert were sexy in their shorts and uniforms. Michael Kingsbury, the landlord and founder of the theatre, was delighted with the dress rehearsal, which he saw. The first night audience was packed into the 50 seats. They laughed loud and chuckled, at the first half, with lots of gags. When the second half went up, the audience laughed, but were following the plot. King Karol now becomes a referee, chasing the huge debt that Tito had built up for Yugoslavia. He founded the Unaligned Nations, skillfully playing East against West, to realize his corrupt Yugoslav dream. In fact, it was the beginning of the end, with internecine bloodshed and genocide.\n\nBack to the first night. The applause was gratifying at the end of the show. After, we had a good drink in the pub. The audience response was so positive. A number of people came up to me in the pub afterwards and congratulating me on the play, saying things like, “you must know an awful lot about football”! My friend Lali, the beautiful Croatian woman, was quite offended, believing that I’d satirized Yugoslavia, our country. It touched her. It was the only negative reaction to my play that I knew of that night. My friend, Ben Fietelson, enjoyed the show, and thought that I must have been high, when I´d written it. In a small part, it was true. Roy Mitchell, who generously put cash into the production, also chatted with me for a while. He is critical, and thoroughly enjoyed the play. Mike did a sterling job with the direction.\n\nI had mentioned to Rod Smith, that I intended to buy a car. Rod knew a fair mechanic called Steve. He was there with his wife. Rod introduced me to them. I asked him for his number, telling him of my intention. He said, in his East End Cockney accent, that he would be ” ´appy to ´elp”. Michael Kingsbury closed the curtains, letting us drink for a while after hours. Got together with Phil Croskin during this period. He was terrific as the blonde haired, Teutonic Nazi. It felt great to have a drink with my closest friends at the time. New friends, like Martin Sadofski, and Sandra, who had been in the audience and had really enjoyed the show. I thanked her for getting the soccer uniforms. As usual, she was modest about it. Saying that she wanted to help the show, and Martin. Dom Boydell, stage manager, and funny actor, did an amazing job wearing two hats. I thanked him. Eventually, Mike and I made our way back to Kilburn. We had a drink when we got there and I ended up being quite drunk. I slept well that night.\n\nMike stuck around for a couple of performances and had to go back to Manchester. It was a pleasure being with him. The actors liked him. Michael Morrissey did a stupendous job on my play. I couldn’t be happier. Cast members did invite a lot of friends, family and acquaintances. This kept the audiences healthy. Then, word of mouth built and built. It wasn’t a huge house to fill, only 50 seats. But it was gratifying to see audiences grow night after night. Company morale was high. Everybody was happy. Every audience member paid admission. It was important that the company earned at least a bit of money at the end of it. Producer Roy Mitchell, who generously put cash into the rent of theatre.\n\nIt was now time to deal with my stash of cash. Being prudent, I decided to open a new building society account with Abbey National. It would earn some interest. The large bulk of the money headed there. A few grand would go into my regular bank account, for the second-hand car I wanted. I felt the need for wheels. Don’t know why? Maybe ego? Deposited the cheque into my bank and withdrew a large amount, then went to an Abbey National branch on Kilburn High Road, and opened a high interest account. Plus some cash that I could access through an ATM. It took time to get my card, pass number, etc. While up there, bought a lot of groceries, booze and cat food. I had a good relationship with the cat. He was no trouble at all. We had our customary cuddle, and I then looked at the yellow pages. There was an outdoor used car lot within walking distance of the sublet. I decided to check it out the next morning.\n\nI didn’t know Kilburn that well, so armed with my London A to Z. Following the street map, I finally got there. It was visible from high ground. I had to cross a railway bridge to get there. It was a vast car lot, with hundreds of second-hand cars. I had a good look round. Each car had its price on the windshield. My attention was caught by a sports car. It was a silver Mazda RX 7. The price was about right: roughly one eighth of my settlement. I did look at other cars, but that one stuck in my head. I went home and did the show that evening. I waited for a couple of days and went back to the car lot. Having another look round, I kept coming back to the RX 7. I had Steve´s number, so that afternoon, I called him. He repaired cars outside his council maisonette in the East End. He agreed to inspect the sports car the next day. I gave him the address, agreed on a fee, and we would meet there.\n\nI got there a bit early and waited for him. He showed up in a big American car. Asking him if he liked American cars? Loved them, so reliable and steady. He said that he dealt in them. Buying the cars from various American air force bases, mainly in East Anglia. Air Force members did return to the States and sell their cars while here. We went over to the car. He gave it a good test. Looking under the hood for a while, saying that it had a cylindrical engine, but that was not a huge problem. Checking under the car for oil leaks. Testing the exhaust, and tires, passing the car as being in decent condition for the price. Then, I decided to buy it. Going to the office and signing a cheque for it at the full price. Steve and I parted, and I drove back to the flat. Relaxed that afternoon. I happened to look at my diary, realizing that I was due to go to Mansfield, in Nottinghamshire this Sunday. With the excitement of the show, I had completely forgotten about it. Smilja, a member of my God family, had invited me to her and her husband’s Slava: a quick explanation, is that every Serbian Orthodox family has a Saints Day, where they invite all their friends to an elaborate meal, a special cake, and religious ceremony. My brother was there when their first daughter was baptized, meaning that our families became “Kums”, or godparents. It was Wednesday, so I called Smilja. I knew her from an early age, had stayed with her family, even sharing a bedroom, when my mum was in Yugoslavia, and I loved her. She was extremely pleased to hear from me, telling me the time to be there, (she assumed that I had a car and was still with Doe. I would tell her on Sunday). Smilja asked me if I could bring Micha Krundija, a good mutual friend of ours up to Mansfield? It would be good to see and bring my old mate up. I then tried calling him, but no answer. Would try again the next day. Continued chilling and drove down to the theatre that evening. It felt great to be behind the wheel again.\n\nThe next morning, I got hold of Micha. He said that he would come to Mansfield on Sunday. I arranged to pick him up at his place then. We had a lot to talk about, so we´d talk on the way up and back. Meanwhile, word of mouth continued, and we had surprisingly decent audiences. That night, after the performance of Kingdom Come, I had a chat with the landlord, Michael Kingsbury. Wistfully, he said, ” I feel in my water, that this show has life”. Sure enough, the very next night, after the show, I was approached by a dark haired woman. She said, “I represent one of the most popular theatres at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival: The Gilded Balloon. The show is funny, and original. If you can, it would be great if you could bring the show to Edinburgh in August”? A bit taken aback, I happily said that, “as writer and producer, I’d try to take the piece up there”. She gave me the number of the person in charge, a woman called Karen Koren. There were still a few members of the cast in the pub. I told Martin Sadofski first, and then Phil Croskin. Judith and Rod were sitting together. They all were pleased. Drove back to the flat, satisfied that all the work everyone put in was worth it. On Saturday morning, I called Mike and told him the news. He was positive about it. August was a long way off, and we would obviously have to find some new cast members. I could tell from his tone of voice that he welcomed getting the show back on. We´d be in touch with each other soon. Also, rang Roy Mitchell, to tell him about Edinburgh. He congratulated me, saying that my play deserved another run. However, he would put a lot less money into it, for tax purposes. I thanked him for his help up to now. I told the cast in their dressing rooms on the Saturday night. The reaction was understandably mixed. August was a long way away. All kinds of things could happen to each member of the cast between now and then. We played to a sold out audience with high energy that night.\n\nSunday morning came around. No show today. I had some coffee and cereal, knowing that I’d be eating heavy Serbian food later, and fed the cat. The good thing about this black cat, was that being a night cat, he didn’t need a litter box, which I would save money on over almost 3 months. He did his business outside. I was already pretty conscious of money. Having already spent an eighth of my total settlement, on my sports car. As I knew from an other freebie that I’d done, The Misfit, I had ushered in my worst year, having to work at crappy commission-only company, selling advertising space in theatre programs, which in the UK, you paid extra money for. Agents do forget that you exist, definitely not a great thing. But becoming a playwright and hence a man of the theatre, were important to me. I had a shower, shave, put on my dark blue suit and then set off for Micha´s flat in Notting Hill Gate. It was on the top floor, overlooking a square. I complimented him enviously on his apartment.\n\nMicha and I went back a long way. I don’t quite remember when it was, but it was certainly around the Serbian Orthodox church. Of course, we, as a community, couldn’t afford to establish our own church in Derby. We used an abandoned Anglican church. As a bunch of kids and teenagers, sons and daughters of immigrants, we would speak English to each other, and Serbian to older folks. It was thought that I spoke the best Serbian, but it was Micha who spoke the language a lot better than me. In fact, he was highly intelligent. As the years went on, we traveled to other towns and cities for Serbian Orthodox church services followed by energetic folk dances, in dance halls, weddings, Sunday school, Saints Days, etc. We became close friends, both fans of Derby County. A real scholar, he gained admission to the Landon School of Economics, one of Britain’s elite universities. When I first came to London, to work for Bubble Theatre, I spent my first night on his sofa. Earlier in the evening, we traveled by underground from Notting Hill, to the school in central London. There were a few punk rock bands playing. On the way there, he told me about his recent trip to Yugoslavia. What came out of his mouth was so fantastical and preposterous, inciting that the Yugoslavian secret police were after him: conspiracy theories galore. Suspected that something was wrong with his mental health. When we got to the concert, he went back to completely normal, as he was on the journey back and back at his place, I let it go, being totally wrapped up in my acting job, finding a place for Doe and I, she was also employed as an administrative assistant with Bubble, finding an agent, performing all over London, and just plain busy. No contact for the next year. Finally, I called him and found out that he’d left LSE, and been admitted to a mental hospital with schizophrenia. This horrible illness affects one person in every hundred. Micha was on powerful drugs, which made him seem normal. The problem was when he didn’t take them. We started to go to Derby County when they played in London. At least once, I drove him to a mental hospital, where he was well-known to the staff. When we lived in Primrose Hill, he would show up unannounced. I would take him to the local pub, because Micha wanted to play trivial pursuit games, (there was a machine in the pub). He was obsessed with it. Doe didn’t like him coming to our flat. In her view, he could do something unexpected at any time. I knew that he’d do no harm.\n\nI drove down to Notting Hill in the morning. It would take approximately two hours up the M1 Motorway to get there. I was familiar with the route, because Mansfield is half an hour´s drive from Derby. So I knew that area of the East Midlands intimately. It was good to see Micha again. He was impressed with my RX 7. He´d taken his medication, so he came over as being more or less normal. As we drove up there, I told him about my new circumstances. He didn’t comment. We talked about general subjects. He was well informed. You could never run out of things to talk about with Micha. Time passed quickly on the way there. The car performed solidly. I didn’t push it, staying within the speed limit of 70 mph. I must say, I was quite pleased with my purchase.\n\nWe arrived at the family’s house. It was in a middle class area of town. A neat row of semi-detached houses, front patios, with gardens at the back. Both Micha and I went into Serbian speaking mode, as I rang the doorbell.\n\nSmilja greeted us loudly, and with a huge show of affection. We went into the living room, where a large table was set out. Micha and I kissed Nedja, her husband and Brana, Smilja´s mother. Plus their two young adult daughters. I was enormously fond of this family. There were others less familiar, who we shook hands with. The one thing about Serbians, is their hospitality. First we all prayed and the special cake around, with some red wine soaked into the bottom of it. We all drank a shlivovitz toast. Then the meal was served. Orthodox people are supposed to fast at holy times of the year. Our Saints Day, St Nicholas, we couldn’t eat meat, so we bought a lot of fish. No such constraints were on this family’s Saints Day. Slavs love meat, and course after course appeared, soup, cabbage rolls, chicken, rice with meat, a “guvec” with lots of booze. Micha wisely drank little, because of the medications. I took it easy, having to drive. We all had a great time and eventually returned to London, and I got to drive a long distance at night. As we reached his place, I promised to stay in touch.\n\nThere was still a week left on the run. I drove down to Kennington. It was a good performance in front of about 30 people. Not bad for a Monday night. After the show, I headed back to the car. There were a small group of actors leaving the pub, including Kate Gartside. When she saw the Mazda RX 7, she looked at me and the car with utter contempt, as if I was driving around in a silver penis. I will never forget that look. She is a fine actress and now well-known, beautiful. But I don’t tend to fancy women who are hostile towards me. Perhaps I was bad? Tension and trying too hard, were my weaknesses. I felt relaxed in the role. Let it go. I drove back and slept.\n\nThe next day was spent banking and buying groceries up on the Kilburn High Road. Driving to the theatre to perform. The show went well, to a small audience. After a drink with some of the cast, I went to the car. It wouldn’t start. Again and again, no response. Going back to the pub, I asked some of the guys to push it, so I could jump start. Once again, nothing. The guys went back, and I called the AA, the Automobile Association. Luckily, I was still a member. They would have to tow me back to the street outside the flat. I sat in my car, waiting for the tow truck. A thought kept coming back to me. Had I made a monumental mistake buying the car? Finally, my car was hooked up, I jumped in with the driver of the truck and we drove up to Kilburn, through quiet streets, and parked the car in a side street near the flat. Maybe Steve would fix my car? Didn’t sleep that well that night. The next morning, I called Steve and told him the news. Credit Steve, he came that afternoon. He spent a long time looking at the engine, concluding that he was mystified. He couldn’t do anything. We parted. Deeply disappointed in myself, all that money. I´d have to go back to public transport.\n\nThis buying of the RX 7 did torment me, to various degrees. Why did I have to buy a damn sports car? Was it ego? The desire to impress women? I didn’t need a car to impress them. Was it a reaction to finishing a 13 year relationship? Changing my focus, I had perform in my play. The used car lot would get a call from an irate me before the end of next week. The show ended with a bang. Full houses for the last 3 nights. I asked Dom, the stage manager, to take everybody’s address, so I could send the box office money on Monday. Armed with that, I made a little speech in the shared dressing room, that was a no longer used kitchen, after the last show. I thanked everyone for bringing my play to life and said that they all were offered the same part in Edinburgh in August. I would send checks to each of them, when I´d reckoned up with Michael Kingsbury. We all enjoyed a drink before heading home.\n\nWhen the pubs opened on Monday, I took the tube to the White Bear. Met with Michael Kingsbury, the landlord and founder of the theatre, finally reckoning up. Doing a show for nothing, means that you need to sharpen your acting chops, or showcase yourself. Otherwise, with 50 seats, everyone got not much. I thanked Michael for his help and set off for Kilburn High Road. On the underground train, I had brought my calculator, working out how much each cast member would get. It was split into 7. I didn’t take anything. Didn’t need money. Business done, picked up a few groceries and The Evening Standard. I had to find a place to live in less than a month. The classified section on accommodation was depressing. I wanted to rent my own place. The thought of sharing a flat with someone else was abhorrent to me. There was no way any bank or building society would be inclined to give me a mortgage. I had looked at some properties in 1981. Since then, prices had multiplied and multiplied. Everything was so expensive. I had to earn money. My agents at Peters Fraser & Dunlop had been invited to see my play, but hadn’t come. As another actor who was with my agency said when I was at Stratford-upon-Avon, said, ” we are the work horses. Agents are only interested in money. Stars, and rising stars, agents are only interested in”. My opinion was they have an elevated idea of you, and sold that idea. They had seen me work as a director and actor a number of times, so much ado about nothing. I called them and said that I was now available for work. She said that she would put me up for something soon.\n\nIt was time to seriously look for a place to live. Would buy the Standard every day and other rental publications. I would also network among my friends. To that end, I called my friend, Jonathan Tafler. Getting through, he apologized for not coming to my play. He´d been busy at the BBC Radio Drama Company. I asked if I could visit him? We arranged for Wednesday evening. He asked me how show had gone? I said that it had been a success and we´d been invited to a prestigious venue at the Edinburgh Festival. He congratulated me. We would talk on Wednesday. Feeling social, I also called Sue Smith. Didn’t expect her to see the play, because her separated husband was playing the leading part in my play that we´d just finished the run of. We arranged for a visit to her house in Hackney the next afternoon. The used car lot would get a call from me in the morning. I wanted to put a deal to them: perhaps a cheaper car could be exchanged for mine? It was a long shot that I might pull off if I was persuasive enough. At least I could talk. Sell ideas.\n\n1989-90 Story Part 2.\n\nThe next morning, I called the used car lot. I asked to speak to the head guy. They got him and I made my pitch. He said, “if it was a regular car, I´d consider it. But your car has a cylindrical engine, so I’m sorry. I can’t do that”. I slammed the phone down, furious. Why on earth didn’t I buy a Ford? Or a normal car? Steve said that a cylindrical engine was, “no problem”. It took time for me to calm down. Had a cup of tea and relaxed. Finally, I called Steve, got his wife, with the sound of kids in the background. After a while, he came to the phone, and I told him the whole sorry story. He was always good natured, saying, “why don’t you come around to my place”? I said that I’d be visiting my friend in the East End this afternoon. He said that I should drop by, and gave me his address.\n\nLuckily, Hackney, and Sue´s house was a short walk from the North London Line station. It was a relatively short journey from Kilburn. I walked to Sue´s place, which was near Hackney Park. We kissed at the doorway. Then we had a cup of tea and a long chat. I purposefully didn’t mention the play, because I knew that Rod Smith had instigated the separation. Instead, I told her about splitting up with Doe. She was sympathetic, saying that it was a “shame”. At least we didn’t have kids, like her. A clean break. I hadn’t even married her. Mentioned that I was really looking for a flat. Did she know of anywhere? I wouldn’t mind living in the East End. There were good transport links. She didn’t know of anything, but would mention it to friends. Anyway, the doorbell rang. A friend of Sue´s, a gorgeous slim blonde joined us. I had seen her before there. I was attracted to her. We chatted for a short while.\n\nIt was time for me to get to Steve´s. I didn’t want to get there when it was dark, so I walked to the main road and hailed a cab. It was a lot quicker that way. Got there at about 3pm. Steve was outside his council maisonette, under a car. We chatted generally. He was of the view that all regular repair garages aimed to rip their customers off. Most garages were only interested in money. Steve had experienced all of that for years. That’s why he worked on his own. People would tell him about repairs, his response was, “how much did they charge you for that then”? Of course, he knew what it really cost. We moved onto my Mazda RX 7. He said that he wasn’t surprised at the lot´s reaction. Steve thought for a while. He said, “I´ll try to fix ya car by towing it ´ere. A straight swap. In return, I’ll give you an American car. D´ya like that”? I was stunned. Saying, ” that’s incredibly generous of you”. Steve said, “you will have to wait for a few weeks. I haven’t got the car yet”. Immediately, I saw why Rod call him a “fair mechanic”. His wife came out as it was getting dark. Said hello to her. It was time to head off. I thanked him. Asked him where was the nearest station? Going to grab a taxi to the nearest tube. On the way back, I was grateful to Steve. Who else would do that?\n\nI went to bed that night, inspired by the human spirit. Slept well that night. Relaxed during the morning. Petted the cat, washed my dirty clothes in the washing machine. I went to get a copy of the Standard, was frustrated with the price of accommodation. I had to move soon. Time was running out. It was up to me. Had a nap in my bedroom. It was late afternoon, time to set off for Jonathan Tafler´s place. Just to remind you: he was the son of Ealing Comedy star Sidney Tafler, who had passed away before we met. He went to Cambridge University, we´d shared a couple of houses in Stratford and Newcastle, directing him in a play for the RSC Lunchtime Season up there. Our friendship was 9 years old.\n\nHe lived in the deep south of London. I had to take a train from Waterloo Station. Jonathan lived at the end of what had been old railmans´ cottages, in a row of similar Victorian cottages. When I got there, it was a short walk from the station, over a bridge. When I knocked on his door, he came and greeted me. We sat down and talked and caught up. We had not seen each other since Jason’s party, before I´d finished with Doe. As usual, he rolled a joint. I told him all about our visits to a counselor and our decision to split up. The stupidity of my purchase of a sports car, the settlement of a large sum. As soon as he heard that I had come into money, his response was, “I´ve a friend called Chris, who’s looking to sell the lease on a two bedroom flat in a historic square, Trinity Church Square, in Southwark, just south of the river. He wants, so and so many thousands of pounds for it”.\n\nJust to explain: I´d seen such places in the Standard. It was a loophole in the property law, where you paid a small rent, but you had to pay a large sum of money for “fixtures and fittings”. Basically, they were desirable properties, where you got no furniture, but you just bought the lease. My reaction was immediate interest. Jonathan said, “the only thing is that my girlfriend has first choice, but she may not be able to raise that kind of money”. I had met his girlfriend. She was an attractive young actress. I had to wait a week or 10 days for her to see if she could get the cash? Knowing her as a flighty woman, I gambled that she couldn’t afford such a large amount. It was my turn to roll a joint. We then discussed his role at the BBC Radio Drama Company. He´d really enjoyed his months there. The variety of parts, the different plays, classic and new plays. You didn’t need to wear costumes and it is great for sight reading. It was getting late, so I had to get the train to central London and up to Kilburn. He asked me to call him every 3 or 4 days, to check the situation with the flat. I got the train back and thought how lucky I was to have such friends. Martin Sadofski, who had found me the sublet. Now Jonathan Tafler may have found me an apartment. It dawned on me that I’d be careful with my money, but that thought was for another day.\n\nThe next week found me on tenterhooks. After 3 days, I called Jonathan. No news. I tried 4 days later. This time, he said his girlfriend couldn’t raise the money, much to her regret. So I was now free to call Chris Bowen, an actor, who was with Jonathan at Cambridge. Feeling lucky to have such friends, I thanked him for this lead, explaining that I’d be in trouble if this hadn’t worked out. I asked him for Chris´ number. I once played soccer against him in the big crunch game, between the RSC and the National, at Hyde Park a few years ago. So I knew him vaguely. He gave me his number, saying that he was expecting my call. Thanked him again and I ended our call. I then went into a deep think. How enormously lucky I was to have such friends. They had saved me yet again. Looking at the calendar, it struck me that I had only 16 days left in this sublet. I was meant to leave a week before the end of March. Phew, went through my mind. I was so lucky in my gamble. Goodness knows what would have happened if Jonathan´s girlfriend had found the money to pay for the lease? Now, I had to think hard. Had no paid work on the horizon. This thought was based on my experience in 1985. It was a year of disaster. Why? Because I´d spent a lot of time on The Misfit, an other freebie. Work didn’t really happen, (apart from one commercial). It wasn’t until Orchard Theatre saved me in early 1986. It meant that I had to survive on the money that I had. No signing on for the dole under any circumstances. Furniture, beds, had to be bought for the unfurnished apartment. I was hoping to fly to Canada in the summer. The truth was that my settlement wouldn’t cover the lease, and alow me to live comfortably for the next number of months.\n\nI made myself a meal, continuing to think. It took me a while to figure this out. Why didn’t I borrow money from Ljuba, my brother, for a slim majority of the lease? I would add the rest. In April, I would take the lease document to Barclays Bank and get a loan. It was a financial juggling act. Knowing that Ljuba would be home in the evening, so I waited until past midnight, the following day. Then I called. Got through to Carol, his wife, she went off to get him. He was pleased to hear from me. Explaining the situation regarding my new flat, then I asked him to send me a cheque in sterling to make up the lease money? I would return the cash in April. Immediately, not surprisingly, he said yes. The address in Kilburn was given to him. He would send it tomorrow morning. I could always rely on my brother. He was quite wealthy, being a surgeon, an ear nose and throat specialist. We caught up on our news and ended our conversation. I went to bed satisfied that I’d made the right decision.\n\nThe next morning, I called Chris Bowen. He was expecting my call. He invited me to go and see the place. I asked when it was possible for me to visit? He said that he’d be in that afternoon. Straight away, I agreed. He gave me the address, flat 3, 56 Trinity Church Square. It was a 5 minute walk from Borough underground station. We set a time later that afternoon. Fed the cat, had a bath, shave, dressed and had lunch. It was important that I saw the square and flat in daylight and see the views from the windows. Quickly checked my A to Z. At 2pm I set off. Borough was on the Northern Line, just south of the river. I had to change lines, but the journey didn’t take too long. Got there a bit early, and would look around the area, that I wasn’t that familiar with. My first impression, as I crossed the road outside the tube station, was not favourable. The streets were dingy and unkempt. But then, I turn the corner and my mood changed completely. There, in front of me, was a beautiful period square, tall houses, at least 150 years old. In the middle of the square, was Trinity Church. Surrounding the church were neat lawns, and a few park benches. Every house, or floors of apartments, had standard black railings outside them, also every house had black doors. This was obviously a graded historical site. Walking on, there was another historical, smaller square, Merrick Square. Houses were a lot smaller, all the same colour, the same as Trinity Church Square: off white. In the middle of the square, were old trees and a garden, presumably for residents. I walked back to the house, where my flat was. Interestingly, it was a double house, on the road, which seemed busy.\n\nI rang the entrance bell to flat 3. Chris answered, a buzzer opened the black solid door, and told me to go up the stairs to the top floor. He was waiting on the top landing. We shook hands, and he showed me around the flat. Turning left, we entered an old fashioned, kitchen, with an electric cooker, an ancient fridge, old washing machine, shelves, a work surface, a gas water heater over the sink, and an alcove, with shelves, behind a curtain, for food storage. We moved onto a large bedroom, opposite, across the central corridor. It was where he slept. It looked out of the square, nice. The living room, down the corridor, had a couple of sofas, a dining table, also looked out over the square. It was well proportioned and had a fireplace. We went over to the second bedroom. It was smaller, but looked over the backyard, where you had the dustbins, and a washing line, where I could hang washing. Finally, he showed me the bathroom, no shower, just a deep bath, toilet, sink, mirror and glazed glass windows, so no one could see in. Airing cupboard over the electric hot water tank. He said, “come downstairs, I’ve more to show you”. We went down to the yard, it was a stone floor, quite ugly, with some flats overlooking the yard, with some kind of workshop over the wall. There were a number of rubbish bins there, collected twice a week. A washing line, extending the whole length of the yard. You could bring the line in with a pully mechanism. We then went to the basement of the house. Where there were a number of storage rooms. He showed me mine. There were a couple of chairs, a table and a raggedy sofa in there, a cupboard and not much else. Chris said that I could keep everything there. It was at least a start. We climbed up the stairs to the top floor. That was it. Chris made us a cup of tea and we had a long talk about the conditions that I had to adhere to, to live there.\n\nHe said a number of rules for living in the square. First, the flats only could be rented out to married couples. Chris Bowen was single, he just arranged for a friend to pose as his wife at the office, for an interview, about a month from now, which I could check out on my way to Borough station, on the street on the way from the square. I could find a female friend who would do that, no problem. I agreed, and it would be easy. I was allowed to sublet the place for 6 months every year. They had a list of couples who were interested in a sublet. He then told me the rent that I would pay every week, which I didn’t know. I had a feeling that it would be low, but I was surprised that it was that low. Basically, the rent was the roughly the same as my share of the mortgage at Primrose Hill. The only catch was that the rent had to be paid quarterly, which meant that I wouldn’t have to pay rent until June.\n\nHe then told me that I had to obtain a legal contract (for a fee) from a lawyer just north of the river at the Inns of Court. I had to obtain, then, give him a certified cheque and the get the contract before Chris left. He gave me the lawyer’s card. There were a couple of quite tall portable gas heaters, one of which was warming us now, which ran on large bottles, with which you could order a new one with the number on the back. He would leave me one. He would leave me an older sofa, with the table and chairs, cupboard, from the basement storage room. The flat had no central heating. Chris said that it could become pretty cold in the winter. We chatted generally for a while and I made my way down the stairs happy. At nighttime the square looked almost as spectacular. It had period lampposts, to keep in the graded historical status. It was astonishing how this old oasis survived through the years. No doubt, I considered myself extremely lucky to live in a spacious flat, in such a beautiful square and central location. Thanks to my friends too. They had stepped up at a difficult time for me.\n\nIt was a great feeling to have to somewhere to live in a couple of weeks or so. The money from Ljuba should arrive in less than a week. Still, there was a lot to sort out: I had to phone Steve, to get my useless car towed to his place, also had to call the lawyer, to set up an appointment with him, when I had the money. Slept relieved that I had a good place to live in the future.\n\nThe next morning, while I was having my breakfast, Jane Lancaster, the young actress who had subletted the apartment called. She said that she’d be visiting me on Sunday, tomorrow. She said that her tour had been extended. The show was successful. Did I want to stay longer at the flat? I said that I’d already found a place, that I’d be leaving in two weeks time. She said that she would stay overnight and leave on Monday. We would discuss everything tomorrow. This development kind of took me by surprise. I would carry on. Later in the day, I called Steve. I had pestered Steve over car issues. They were tolerant of me, particularly Steve´s wife, who seemed to answer the phone every time. I admired them, as always being cheerful and good humoured, often with their kids screaming in the background. She went to get him. I asked him to arrange for my RX 7 to be towed to outside his maisonette. Tuesday afternoon would work. He knew my address. We set a time. The rest of the day was spent shopping and letting the cat in, petting him. Relaxed for the rest of the evening.\n\nOn Sunday, Jane arrived. We had a long talk. She was nice about me moving out when I intended to. Explaining the flat, fixtures and fittings thing, Jane thought that it was good that I’d be independent in my own spacious flat in a historic square in Southwark, an old area of town. She was easy to talk to, so I opened up about my 12 years with Doe. Then, Jane Lancaster said something that I will never forget: “you will have absolutely no trouble attracting women”. That did my confidence a lot of good. I had wasted an eighth of my settlement on that stupid vanity car. She then brought up something significant for her. “I’m not going to be living here for the foreseeable future. Can you please vet some people who are interested in renting my flat”? She would place an ad in The Evening Standard. Hopefully, I will get someone quickly. A memory flashed through my mind. I went down to Fleet Street at Lunchtime, to get the first copies of the Standard. There was a scrum of young people, the other person, reserving the nearest phone box. Accommodation in London was a case of demand far outstripping supply. Her tour would go on for 3 months. After that, she´d live in the family home, take the cat with her to live with her mum and dad in Manchester. We spent the evening together and she slept in the other bedroom. She cuddled the cat and drove away.\n\nOn the Tuesday, Steve drove over with a friend, who had a tow truck, he mentioned that he had a Dodge for me. I thanked him profusely. Told him about the new flat, and I´d call him and give him my number. Steve told me that I’d get the car when I moved to my new flat. He and his friend, who took away the Mazda RX 7. I was upset as they drove away. Up to that point, it was the most disastrous purchase I´d taken. I slunked back to the flat.\n\nOn the Thursday, in the post, was the sterling cheque for the slightly major slice of the fixtures and fittings. I called the lawyer’s office at the Inns of Court. Got through to him and made an appointment Friday morning. I then called Chris Bowen at the flat. He said that he’d see me after the lawyer. Then went to Kilburn High Road and deposited the money. I then took out a certified cheque. Returned home and relaxed. The following morning, I took the tube to the Inns of Court, Chancery Lane Station. I made my way up to the Inns. It was a corner of London that I didn’t know. It was an enclosed space of extremely old buildings Found the office and met the lawyer where I went through the contract with him and signed. Cut him a cheque for his fee and left. I decided to walk to Trinity Church Square. It was a fine spring day and I crossed Southwark Bridge. Following my trusty A To Z, it took surprisingly less time than I’d thought. About half an hour to reach the square. The City of London was relatively close. Arrived at the square, rang the flat and buzzed me through the front door. Chris waiting for me on the top landing. He led me to the living room and asked me for the contract when we sat down on opposing sofas. I handed it to him. He looked over it carefully. After a while, he handed it back to me. He went to make us a cup of tea. I look out of the window. It was a spectacular view of the whole square, with the old church in the middle. He produced a set of copied keys, an old fashioned one for the front door, a Yale for the flat itself. Finally, a small padlock key for the storage room. The door to the yard was always kept open. Then I handed him the certified cheque. We firmly shook hands. He would take the next weekend to move out. The place would be mine first thing Monday morning. We chatted about our futures. Chris said that he was using my money to add to his deposit. He was buying a property in West London. He was moving in the same week as I was moving into this place. Chris Bowen was obviously a smart guy. I thought it impolite to ask him how much he´d paid for “fixtures and fittings”. Certainly a great deal less than I just paid. With the keys in my pocket, I left. Traveled by underground to Kilburn. I never saw Chris Bowen again.\n\nThe next week, I saw a couple of girls who wanted to rent the flat, after I´d showed them round. It was the first pair of ladies looking at the place, committed to renting it. No fuss. They loved it and signed the rent agreement straight away. Half of the two, a gorgeous blonde German girl called Yelka and I hit it off immediately. Confidently, with great English, she called up to Manchester and confirmed the deal. She took my phone number. We would become friends.\n\nThe final week or so was pretty uneventful. Finally, I went alone to a Kilburn pub. As I said before, the area was acknowledged as Little Ireland. That was in the past. Now, Kilburn had undergone gentrification. Still, I had a couple of pints of Guinness, my favourite beer. Martin Sadofski, came round to the basement apartment for a visit. I told him all about my new flat. Martin was pleased with the whole deal. We´d be both south of the river. Not a big distance from Kennington, where he and Sandra lived. Also told him about the American car when I moved into my new place. We discussed the production of Kingdom Come in Edinburgh. It would require a few of us going up there to meet with the woman who ran the theatre, see the place, sign the contract, etc. We speculated on how much they would charge for the rent. Roy Mitchell would be contacted by him, to see if he would put some money into it?\n\nThen the phone rang. It was the father of Jane Lancaster, the young actress who had subletted the apartment to me. He wanted me to pay an extra week´s rent. This made me angry. I pointed out that Jane had agreed that I would stay a week earlier than 3 months. It wasn’t in writing, but we had both agreed on those terms. I had spent a lot of money paying for the sublet, almost triple of what I’d paid for Primrose Hill, and my new flat. I flatly refused. He then tried me to feel sorry for his poor daughter. The cat had been looked after and fed by me. Was that worth a extra week? I ended up putting the phone down on him. Martin agreed with me, said he was a rich Mancunian businessmen. No wonder he was rich, chasing every last penny. I wondered why rich people are so obsessed with money? Martin left, as I had given him my new number.\n\nThe Sunday before I left the sublet, I packed carefully, making sure that my scripts and video tapes, featuring me, were safely packed. Also my video recorder and answering machine. A number of years ago, preparing for me to leave Doe in a hurry, I had bought a huge canvas suitcase. Now, I´d made a good purchase. All of my clothing, a few books, toiletries, sheets, pillow and a warm wooly blanket. Washed all bedclothes, cleaned up the place.\n\nThe moving day came. The ordered black taxi arrived. The girls would move in later that day and look after the cat, to whom I said a warm goodbye. He was good company. The cab hit traffic, but we eventually got there. I hauled my luggage right up the stairs. Took the key and opened the door. A new phase in my life was beginning.\n\n1989-90 Story Part 3.\n\nI went in through the door of my new flat, lugging in my big bags, including the huge canvas suitcase. I heavy lifted them into the main bedroom. In there, was the phone, on a long extension wire. Later, I would call my agents. I then went across the corridor into the kitchen. The good news was that Chris Bowen, the previous occupier, left me a table with a heavy plastic table cloth on it. There was also a wooden chair. He left me some cutlery in the drawer. There were some pots and pans, but no kettle. Hopefully, I would find a hardware store and buy one, along with a bunch of other items. Walked down the corridor into the bathroom. Much to my surprise, on the glass shelf above the sink, was a big old transistor radio. Switched it on. It worked, so I put some music on, switching on the hot water switch. I´d have a bath later, in the deep tub. Walked into the bright living room, with a terrific view over the beautiful square. The church in the middle of it wasn’t used. I wondered what happened there? There was the big portable gas heater, that Chris had promised. Also an ancient grey sofa. A fireplace at the end of the room. I would have to buy a second hand dining table and chairs. Walked to the second bedroom, in which there was absolutely nothing, but a built-in wardrobe. That would be useful. Needed to unpack, but nothing to put my clothes in. Then remembered a tall green chest of drawers in the storage room downstairs. Went there and unlocked the storage room door and took out the 3 drawers, dragging the frame up 4 flights of stairs. Returned for the drawers.\n\nI badly needed some cleaning supplies. I did notice earlier that the fitted carpet, which was in every room and the corridor, except the main bedroom, (where there was a dark orange rafia-like carpet), I´d noticed that the carpet had a lot of London soot on it. Running my hand and fingertips over the grey carpet, looking at my dirty fingers, I then decided to buy a stiff brush, and clean the whole of the carpet the next day.\n\nI went out to hunt for a hardware store, and generally look around the area. Just around the corner was a small grocery shop. Bought a bunch of stuff. The man and woman behind the counter were real Cockneys. Friendly and helpful. With my shopping bag almost full, I wandered across the main road, seeing two rows of shops on both sides of the street. Sure enough, there was a hardware store on the right side of the road. Looking across the road there was a fruit and vegetables shop, next to it was a greasy spoon called Terry’s Cafe. Feeling rather hungry, I went in. Having eaten at a lot of such establishments, immediately I got a good vibe from this one. Neat tables with cloths, the menus chalked up behind a friendly middle-aged man, presumably Terry. I made my order, including a thing called bubble and squeak, which is mashed potatoes, greens of any sort, fried. I ordered and sat down.\n\nCovering the walls, almost completely, were framed photos of local people in the 1940´s and 50´s, going on ” beanos”: in other words, trips, on a hired bus, to the seaside. Looking at them quite closely, I could see that there was real community spirit in this area. Apart from the two squares, which had middle class people living there, this was a genuine working class Cockney area. It was right next door to Lambeth, subject of the Cockney song, The Lambeth Walk. It seems that the people working for the posh folks north of the river, lived just south of the river traditionally. The food Terry served me was really good. I´d made a discovery. A few customers were there, then, a taxi driver walked in. This was obviously a favourite haunt of cab drivers. He called the owner “Tel”. I crossed the road to the hardware store. Then bought a kettle, cloths for washing up dishes, white plates, bowls, mugs, a bucket, rubber gloves, disinfectant, furniture polish, Vim, Fairy Liquid, Brillo Pads, liquid yellow carpet cleaner and finally, a hard stiff brush. I would kneel down and scrub the carpet the next day. Returned home, laden down with shopping. I then called my agents and gave them my phone number and full address, saying that I was available for work. She promised to call me soon.\n\nBy now, it was late afternoon, so donned my rubber gloves and went on a cleaning spree. Scrubbing everything in sight, listening to the BBC on the big transistor radio. Unpacked into the chest of drawers, newly cleaned. I hung my suits up inside the built-in wardrobe in the second bedroom. Shoes also. Made my bed on the old sofa, which I moved into the large bedroom. I had a pillow, sheets, blankets. It wasn’t that comfortable, but the sofa was sprung, but quite soft. Had a bite to eat, got into my dressing gown and slippers, running a bath. I was looking forward to this, because the tub was deep.\n\nIt was a relief to be in my own place. As I luxuriated in my deep hot bath, I thought that I’d finally achieved the independence I craved. It was too early for me, to live with a woman at the age of 22. Anyway, I didn’t want to think about that. I´d call Steve the next day, to see about the American car that he’d promised me, in return for my disastrous purchase of the Mazda RX 7, the silver sports car. Dried myself, brushed my teeth and went to bed. Lay down in my not too comfortable bed. Tried to fall asleep, but couldn’t. It was the noise of traffic coming up from the street outside below me. Later, I found out that this was a well-known short-cut for taxi and van drivers to get to London or Southwark Bridges, over the Thames. After a while, I moved the whole bed to the quieter second bedroom, which overlooked the yard at the back. The other bedrooms that I’d slept in were quiet, going back years. The road in Primrose Hill was a cul-de-sac, the Belsize Park bedroom overlooked the garden at the back. I would just have to get used to the noise, because that would be my bedroom. So ended my first day in my new home.\n\nI slept, got up, made my breakfast, followed the instructions on the back of the carpet cleaning bottle, filling the bucket, pouring in the carpet cleaner to the hot water. I then started scrubbing the carpet with the brush. It was a big job. It was quite remarkable how much dirt there was in the carpet. Constantly, having to change the water. After a few hours, I called Steve, the mechanic and American car dealer. Gave him my number, and asked him if there was a car for me? The great news was that he did have a car for me. It was a Dodge. Thrilled, I asked him when I could pick it up? Steve just was working on the car. Could I pick it up the next morning? Thanked him profusely and put the phone down. Then I fixed my third party insurance by phone, giving my credit card number. My insurers would put my disk in the first class post, arriving first thing tomorrow morning. I was ready to go. The hard cleaning work carried on.\n\nThe following morning, I took the underground to the East End. It was a short walk to Borough Station, then the District Line, out east. Finally, got to Steve´s maisonette. As usual, he was under a car outside. He showed me the car that would be mine. It was a black, large Dodge R. T, meaning road and track. It looked fantastic. Going inside, it had two doors, passengers had to lift the front seats to clamber into the back seats. At a pinch, you could get 3 people in the back. Of course, it was left hand drive, which I was well used to, driving thousands of miles in my left hand drive Volkswagen Beetle. Like most American cars, it had an automatic transmission. No problem whatsoever. Steve gave me a tip. If I pressed the drive pedal down hard, the car would quickly accelerate. Then, I drove home. The car drove beautifully. The only downside, was that it was expensive as far as petrol was concerned. I wondered why I hadn’t bought my car from Steve in the first place. It would have saved me tons of money. Hindsight is 20 20 vision.\n\nWhile out on street in the square, I noticed that every car which belonging to residents, had to obtain parking permits. By chance, a man was going to enter his car. I asked him where I should get my parking permit? He said, “Southwark Town Hall”. Then I realized that I didn’t have proof of my residency, or my London A to Z, so I quickly rushed up the stairs and grabbed my contract with the map book, going back to my car. Didn’t want to get a parking ticket. Back in the car, I looked into my map book. It was right on the Walworth Road. So I took the short drive up to the town hall. This part of London was relatively unknown to me. As I drove up the busy main road, I made a number of discoveries: banks, building society branches, a large supermarket, with free parking at the back, plus all kinds of shops. But the most important asset, was the East Street Market, a traditional London street market, with stalls, stretching down the street, selling mainly fruit and vegetables. I parked down a side street, and made my way to the parking section of the town hall. Showed my document and driving license. Then I wrote a cheque. It was ridiculously cheap. Back in the car, I put my permit in my front windshield.\n\nIt felt good to park in the square. There were plenty of parking spots around the square and on the main through road. The cleaning of the carpets took a long time. It was startling, the difference between the cleaned carpet, before and after cleaning. I carried on cleaning, and the following morning, the phone rang. Picked up the phone and it was Doe. Somehow, she´d found my phone number. I asked her about it. She never gave me an answer. Honestly don’t know why she called. Cannot remember what she said. For the rest of the day, she must have called about 20 times. Her rantings were unintelligible. It was pointless rambling. Eventually, in the late afternoon, it stopped. Thankfully, I would never speak to her again. Thinking about it later, like her intruding our party in Kilburn, this was a way of her expunging our 13 year relationship. She was obviously unhappy with our relationship, hence her excessive drinking. I was also unhappy. Her use of sarcasm, putting me down, physically attacking me. I´d had enough of it. Never again, would I think of her in any favourable light.\n\nOver the next few days, I called my friends to give them my phone number and address. My mate, David Kitchen offered to lend me a futon bed, that I could also use a sofa. I promised to pay him for it later. He had split up with his rich girlfriend, Sam, and had a new girlfriend in a flat in Chiswick. I went there and picked it up. Had a long chat with him. Finally finished cleaning the carpet. Discovered more of this fascinating part of London. If I walked through the square, on the other side was a little park, Newington Gardens, that led me to Elephant & Castle, which was a rather ugly shopping centre, walking through a series of tunnels underground. Still, it had a variety of useful shops. There was a supermarket, video store and an excellent hardware store. In the future I´d use it for big items. A porcelain teapot was bought for myself. Teabags in cups I´d crudely used until now, and good quality instant coffee.\n\nNow that I was mobile, determined to put on my soccer boots again, with a tight knee elastic guard, I tried to play 11-aside soccer, through my friend and fellow producer, Roy Mitchell. My injured knee wouldn’t stand up to the rigours of the game. Much to my disappointment, had to be substituted in the second half. We had a lunchtime drink in a nearby pub after the game. I had a long chat with Roy Mitchell. He agreed to put some money into the Edinburgh show, but it would be a fraction of the contribution made to the pub theatre production. The Inland Revenue were on him. I sympathized, having been in the same situation. I told him about my knee, saying that money was tight with me. The orthroscopy I needed for my torn knee ligament surgery was only available to be done privately. Way beyond what I could afford at the moment. We exchanged notes on our respective teams. He was an avid West Bromwich Albion fan. Limping back to my car, stubbornly, I would try indoor soccer in a few weeks.\n\nOf all my friends, Martin Sadofski, who was playing the prince in Kingdom Come, became closer to me during this period. He was also living south of the river in Kennington, not too far away. He visited me in Kilburn a number of times. I´d called him to give him my number, and he wanted to come and see my new flat?\n\nMartin did visit and really liked the flat, impressed with the square. As I showed him around, he suggested that the walls needed a lick of paint? This weekend, he, Sandra, and his roommate, Peter Richardson, a graphic designer, could the 4 of us, maybe paint the walls? Of course, I agreed. Would go to the hardware store at Elephant & Castle and buy some paint. I´d pick him up on the Friday, we´d get colour cards and decide what colour to paint each wall. We decided, with a cup of tea, moving from room to room, putting up colour sample cards, making our decisions. I said that I’d pick the three of them up, after the buying the paint, rollers, brushes, turpentine, etc, first thing in the morning.\n\nDrove to Kennington, mid morning Saturday, picked the 3 of them up arrived, parked, climbed up stairs to my place. I´d bought plastic sheets, protecting my newly cleaned carpet, to collect paint drops. Before painting each surface, it would be scrubbed down. We went over what we should do, and started painting, mainly with rollers, for the bulk of the walls, and brushes for the corners. We also tackled the base boards with gloss. With 4 people working flat out, the work was done remarkably quickly. I ordered some pizza at lunch time.\n\nMartin suggested that we drive up to Edinburgh and check out the Gilded Balloon? I agreed, saying that maybe 3 of us should drive up together, and see the space and see Karen Koren, the woman who ran the theatre. Maybe we could go up there in the next month or 6 weeks. We finished all of the painting that night. It really made my flat look a completely different place. It was time to put some second hand furniture into the apartment, now that the walls were painted. The paint, rollers, brushes, had cost a fair amount. I would look at my money situation on Monday. I needed furniture. Cash remained the perennial problem. They had done a terrific job. Thanked them a lot. We shared a bottle of chilled wine. Quite late, I drove them back to Kennington.\n\nOn the Sunday morning, I felt that it was time to call my parents in Kingston Ontario. I wanted to give them my phone number and address. By chance, Ljuba was visiting, as he did every day when possible. I was glad that he was there because my dad had hearing aids, never speaking into the phone. My mum always answered the phone, but she couldn’t speak English. I then asked to speak to Ljuba, giving him my number and address. Also giving it to my folks.\n\nHe then dropped a bombshell. He told me that I could now apply to immigrate to Canada. Pretty stunned, I asked how come? I´d made an application for immigration a year or so before, unsuccessfully. Now, Ljuba explained that there was a new loophole, stating that the never married sons and daughters of Canadian citizens could now be accepted. Since 1982, it had been my intention, to join my family and perhaps a new start in a different environment? I told him that I’d have a long think about it. When I´d made my decision, I would call him at home.\n\nOn that Sunday afternoon, I went for a long walk around the area. Walking down Borough High Street, heading towards London Bridge. Turning left before getting to the river, on the right was Borough Market, before it became the famous market. In 1989, looking through the mesh fence, it seemed to be a storage facility. It had Victorian glass roofing and the structure that would eventually become the market. Looking up, I could see the imposing Southwark Cathedral, a huge Victorian pile. I wondered down past an ancient ruin of a church or monastery at the right. There was a riverside pub, which I would check out sometime. Turning left led to the Riverside Walk, leading to Tower Bridge. On the way was the impressive large, high glass ceilinged, reconstructed, Hays Galleria, a former dock, as part of the London Pool. Surrounded by trendy boutiques, specialty shops and restaurants. In the middle of the Galleria was a modern metal sculpture. This isn’t a tour guide, but during this walk, going to Canada was on my mind. I struggled with the idea. I´d just moved into my own place. On the other hand, it would take a long time for me to be accepted. Definitely not happy with the state of my career. I wanted to coach, direct, as well as act. Everything in England was so compartmentalized. You were either a director, actor or coach. I found the business here so cliquey. Perhaps I needed a total change of scenery?\n\nPlus, my mum and dad were getting older. In 1985, when they visited us in Primrose Hill, I was shocked when they needed a rest when in Regents Park. Perhaps I could try it for 6 months? My agents would accept that. Besides, I kept thinking about what Bille Brown had told me in Stratford-upon-Avon, 9 years before, that we were just “soldiers” in our agency. Not star material, that they could make a ton of money on. I´d missed my big chance 10 years before, when I came within a whisker of the leading part in Academy Award winning Best Picture, Chariots of Fire. In the film, we were supposed to be students. The guy who got the part, Ben Cross, was 7 years older than me. I had often wondered if my Slavic name had gotten in the way of landing the part of a Jewish Olympian. Once on the phone, a well-known casting director, suggested I consider changing my surname to “a nice Scottish name”? My name certainly helped with all kinds of ethnic roles. But as Ljuba said, “everyone in Canada is an immigrant, apart from indigenous people. So it’s a more level playing field”. In Britain, there was still a lingering sense of snobbishness, typified by Maggie Thatcher, who had poshified her accent and destroyed the Welfare State, which had given me, and millions of poor young people benefit from a higher education. The lease of the flat did allow me a 6 month sublet. Food for thought.\n\nOn the way back to the square, I couldn’t help but notice that an extremely old pub was there. It was in a courtyard, with tables out in it. Up above, were a series of old balconies. I went inside and enjoyed a pint. The George Inn dated back to Elizabethan times. Being a student of Elizabethan and Jacobean theatre, I knew that Southwark, just over the old London Bridge, was London´s playground. The site of a number of theatres, including The Globe, The Rose, possibly more. Perhaps the balconies were used in cartyard theatre, popular at the time? Brothels, gambling dens, pubs, cock fighting, bear baiting, and so on. On the way home I went down an alleyway. There was a small Elizabethan house, complete with thatched roof. Further along the road, I came across the Borough library, which I would join. Down another alleyway there was an ancient wall. Reading a plaque, it was a wall of a long gone Marshalsea Prison.\n\nOn Monday, it was time to look at my money situation. Of course, I had to return the money that Ljuba had sent me. My Barclays Bank branch, was at St John´s Wood, near to Primrose Hill. I took my contract for my flat, saying that I’d paid a large sum of money for the lease of the flat, hoping that it would act as collateral for the loan. Was confident that I’d get it. I drove up to my branch. Then checked my balance. Not happy. That stupid vanity sports car had burned a big hole in my settlement money. I vowed not to think about it again. I knew where my building society balance stood. It had the bulk of my money. Asked to see the manager? Waiting for a while, then I was ushered into his office. I successfully made my case, showing him the contract. If I came into financial difficulties, I´d sell the lease, for probably a higher sum. He bought my argument, and money was available to me immediately. I signed the loan agreement. I was now on the hook for interest payments and paying back the principal, taken out of my account for the next 5 years. Finally, my money supply was secure for the time being. I signed a certified cheque to my brother. After writing a little letter to him at home, I told him about the loan, and finished by writing your loving brother, Neni, (what he and my mum called me).\n\n1989-90 Story Part 4\n\nThe walls now having been painted and the carpet cleaned, it was time for me to wrap my head round what furniture I needed, on a limited budget. First, a dining table with chairs. Could I make do with that old sofa? Until work came my way, I would have to. Maybe I could cover it with a large piece of material and some cushions? It was quite comfortable. A couple of armchairs would fit, plus a coffee table. By now, I was sleeping in the main bedroom. At first, I’d put cotton wool in my ears, now I was used to the traffic noise. I used the futon, as a double bed. The green chest of drawers were in decent condition. I did need a wardrobe in there. Also a couple of chairs for the kitchen. That was it. Wasn’t sure about the second bedroom. Maybe a desk, chair and a small bookshelf, making it my study? I´d scout for a second hand furniture shop. They would have to deliver it. It was going to take me a day or two.\n\nOn the Tuesday morning, I drove round the local area. After looking at a couple of second-hand furniture shops, I found one in Kennington. It was suitably cheap. I would furnish my flat in the bohemian style. Picked and paid for practically everything I needed, including a solid dining table, 6 chairs, not matching armchairs, small wooden wardrobe, coffee table, cheap desk and small white bookshelf. They would deliver it the next day for 20 quid. I´d furnished my place ultra cheaply. The following morning, they showed up, and I helped the two of them carry all the stuff up 3 flights of stairs. During the move, I met the people living below me. Chris Bowen, had mentioned them when we were talking about me taking over the flat. They were an elderly, Cockney couple. The man came out first, then, he went inside, bringing out, and introducing me to his wife. I explained that I was the new tenant upstairs. Finally, directing them where to put it all. They did a good job, tipping them a fiver each. They both left happy. I sat down. Everything was coming together. I must have inherited some of my mum’s cleanliness freak quality. Because I cleaned and polished the table, coffee table and wardrobe. It took most of the day.\n\nIn the evening, I went to a place I´d discovered shortly after moving in. It was called Waterloo Wines. Just across Borough High Street, it was a kind of wonderland of wines. There was a big choice of vintage, and newer wines. Wine was the only product it sold. At the back, there was a large extension, with all kinds of wines on shelves. A friendly bearded server, readily offered advice. Grabbed a couple of bottles, after browsing for a while. It was good to have this shop nearby. In fact, everything I needed, was within 5 minutes walk of the flat.\n\nThe next couple of days were taken up with decision making about my going to Canada. The idea of 6 months kept ringing round my head. I could sublet the flat for that time. My agents would give me that period, particularly if I emphasized spending quality time with my aging parents and family in Canada. I´d live with my parents at first. Quite frankly, it was 15 years since I´d spent more than a month with them. It would be comfortable in Kingston, with my own bedroom in their house. Was desperate to spend time with them. In 1982, I was impressed with the standard of acting in Canada. It would be an adventure, something different, a fresh beginning at the age of 34, which I would be in July. Plus, I wanted to get away from the toxic relationship with Doe. The Tory government, with their “market” policy, reducing taxation for the rich, trickle down economics, their destruction of trade unions. I particularly disliked the presses obsession with the royal family, (especially tabloids) for the cynical view that it sold more copies. It wouldn’t take a lot to leave Britain. If, by chance, I landed a movie or TV series, I could delay the whole thing.\n\nIt was in the end an easy decision. The next morning, I´d get the underground to Trafalgar Square and Canada House, to get the immigration forms, fill them up and send it back. I got there the next morning, it was a big imposing building, then found the forms, took them home and carefully filled them, and sent them back the next day. I felt a sense of relief as I put the large envelope into the red post box in the square. Noticed a number of people carrying instrument cases into the Trinity Church, in the centre of it. There was a substantial space for rehearsing for one of London´s symphony orchestras. Later, I went to buy some groceries round the corner, and could hear the music wafting over the square.\n\nThe Trinity Housing Association sent me a letter, asking me to go to their office, which was just on the way out of the square, to meet with my wife and I. The flats could only be let out to married couples or families. The previous tenant, Chris, had warned me that they would want to meet my wife. I called Mike asking if his wife, Melanie, could pose as my wife at the interview? He gave the days when they could do it. They wouldn’t stay with me, rather their friends, Barry and Maretta. Mike and Melanie of course, had a baby boy called Jack. They would stay at a more child friendly house. Barry was a computer wiz at Sherman Bank. Maretta worked in theatre. It was up to me when I made the appointment. Made a call to the office, arranging a day that Mike had confirmed. I verified with Mike. They would drive to London on a week day, stay the night before, and return to Manchester the next day? He said, ” yes”. This was a real show of friendship. The following week, they arrived. We greeted each other. Mike walked Jack in a stroller round Trinity Church Square and Merrick Square, while Melanie and I took the short walk to the office. As soon as we went in, Melanie became a convincing wife. After all, she was a professional actress, a musician, smart and beautiful at the same time. She was spot on in pretending to be my wife. We made an attractive couple, she answering questions flawlessly. The woman conducting the interview bought our lie completely. We had a laugh on the way back to the flat. Mike left the stroller at the bottom of the stairs, in the hallway, and we all climbed the stairs to the flat. I took them on a tour of the flat. Mike liked it, particularly the 2 squares. Over a cup of tea and digestive biscuits, I confessed that I was emigrating to Canada. That was pretty in the long term. They took the news well, understanding my motives. Mike wanted to miss the traffic, driving to Manchester that afternoon.\n\nWith my Dodge, it was time to get my social life going. Knowing who was the ideal person for that, was that beautiful Croatian blonde: Lali. I gave her a call. We always spoke Serbo-Croat to each other, and she was delighted to hear from me. We had a long talk. I explained my situation to her, and more importantly, that I now had wheels. She lived with her boyfriend, Neil, an Englishman, who was a hard working technical journalist, expert on finances, who owned a large flat in South Kensington. This was quite a loose relationship. He didn’t mind her going out with other men, she explained. Let me say that although she was gorgeous, I was really enjoying being single. Nothing would tempt me, for now, anyway. Had a bad experience taking an other man´s girlfriend from him 13 years ago. We arranged to go out that weekend. Lali knew London really well. All kinds of places that were off the beaten track. With the car, London was her playground. We went to an obscure bar, and chatted. Over time, we became good friends, opening my life to a whole section of Croatian friends of hers. There were other assorted Yugoslavs. Lali believed in “Brotherhood and Unity”, and was upset at my lampooning of Yugoslavia in Kingdom Come. Other than that, Lali and Neil threw terrific parties, inviting a wide variety of people. Models were there, always of interest to me. At that time, Neil and I got to know each other. He was a nice guy. Meanwhile, Lali and I became close. We talked to each other every other day, or every day on the phone. With a group of Croatian friends, we would go to jazz clubs, following a young trumpeter called Django Bates.\n\nAt the same time, my social life became even more active. I dated Judith Sharp, who had been in my play, and Escape from Sobibor. Went round to the Kilburn flat, that I’d subletted, getting to know an extremely attractive German girl called Yelka. Cheryl Leigh, the continuity lady in Escape from Sobibor, came to see my play in London, and had left me her number then. I think that she had a crush on me. She was wealthy, being in demand in the film industry. Visited her house, as well as Judith´s. What they all had in common was they were attractive and bright, good company. But everything was purely platonic. I was only too happy to keep it that way.\n\nBeing single was precious to me. Having no TV, didn’t matter. I would read, joining Borough library. There was always the radio, which I listened to every day. It was my contact with the outside world. News, classical music, pop and even plays, done by their own radio drama company. One thing I enjoyed, was my weekly shopping trip. I would drive up Walworth Road, parking in the supermarket parking lot. Then I would shop. Drop off my shopping in the trunk, going over to East Street Market, to buy my fruit and vegetables. One of my pleasures, was soaking in a deep hot bath on a Saturday afternoon. BBC sport had a live soccer show, where they updated you on the scores, as the games happened. This was before Sky Sports, when every match started at 3pm, Saturday. Invariably, I would go out on Saturday night.\n\nMartin Sadofski had been in constant touch. I often visited Sandra Chalmers, his girlfriend, and the his friend, Peter Richardson, lead guitarist of The Passmore Sisters, Martin´s band. We discussed going on a reconnaissance trip to the Gilded Balloon up in Edinburgh. It was time that we checked the space out, and we decided that it should happen the following week. I´d worked out on my calculator, that taking the Dodge up there and back, would cost me a lot. The Dodge drank petrol. Not too bad around London, and gas prices were fairly cheap. A 500 mile round trip was prohibitive. We´d pick up Michael Morrissey in Manchester, staying at his house on the way back, leaving Mike up there. Of course, I would take the Dodge for our 3 week run. I would drive a small, hired petrol economy car up there. Martin said that he’d arrange a meeting and a show round of the space. The next day, Martin called: it was on a midweek day. Mike was okay with the day, so I got the tube, the evening before traveling, to an especially cheap hire car place in the East End. I ended up with a Ford Popular, stingy with petrol, on a 24 hour hire. I had parked the Dodge on a street where I wouldn’t get a ticket.\n\nExtremely early in the morning, drove to Martin´s place. Picked him up and we made our way to the M1 Motorway, veering off to the M6 up to Manchester. On the way, we discussed what it meant to run a venue at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. Martin had the cynical view the numerous venues in Edinburgh, were only interested in money, gained through renting every single 2 hour slot throughout the day. Usually, there were hundreds of plays at the fringe, plus ranging from stand-up comedians, overseas professional companies, overseas amateur groups, professional UK performers and rank amateurs. It was basically an open free for all. As long as you could afford the rent, you were in. I did read that the average fringe audience was 6. Martin and I chatted all the way to Manchester. We arrived at Fallowfield, Manchester, where Melanie Mike, and baby Jack lived. Said a quick hello.\n\nShortly thereafter, we set off for Edinburgh. Eventually arrived at the centre of Edinburgh, where the Gilded Balloon was situated. On the way, we passed Lockerbie, the scene of the horrific bombing of the Pan Am Jumbo Jet, on its way to the US, had crashed the year before, with the loss of hundreds of lives, including townspeople. Eventually, Libya, was found to be responsible for the bomb, in the cargo hold of the 747.\n\nWe arrived in the late afternoon. Being April, it stayed light a bit later. We met Karen Koren, who ran the venue: she showed us round the place. It was big. 200 seats. Karen assured us that it was one of the most prestigious fringe theatres. Apparently, it was built in the early 19th century as a warehouse. The number of the average audience of 6 kept running through my mind. Voicing my tentative concerns, she said that this theatre had a stellar reputation and always had decent audiences. Each play or act was routinely reviewed by The Scotsman, and other publications. We went to Karen Koren´s office, and the hard sell began. She convinced us to have the show start at 3pm every day. It fitted, because at that time, as I said, every professional soccer game began 3pm Saturday. There were obviously midweek cup and league matches under floodlights. The rent was high, we tried to bring her down, which she did, partly. We looked at each other, nodded. Finally, we agreed and, as a producer, I signed a contract. The Kowalski Institute would present Kingdom Come at the Gilded Balloon in August and the beginning of September, for a 3 week run. We left the theatre and went to a local pub for a drink. Hungry, we had something to eat. Martin said that he could see pound signs in her eyes during our negotiations. Mike philosophically agreed, saying that is the way it is. Certainly, the fringe was a financial bonanza for the venues. We had a brief look at the Royal Mile. I decided to buy a bottle of Scotch. I asked a young woman outside the whiskey shop, what brand should I buy? She said that Highland Park was a good one. So I bought it. We drove down to Manchester, arrived early in the morning. Stayed with Melanie, Mike and baby Jack in their comfortable house overnight. After something to eat, coffee, Martin and I headed back to London the next morning.\n\nIn the car, when we reached the motorway, we discussed where the company of 8, with Mike, at the beginning, would stay, for the 3 whole weeks? As the only producer on the spot, it was my responsibility that everyone was properly housed. I´d already spoken to Roy Mitchell. He would not pay the rent of the theatre, like last time, although he´d chip in. Perhaps he´d pay for the accommodation? The conversation got quite heated. Obviously, Edinburgh would be jam-packed all during the festival, and accommodation in the city would be extortionate. We had an extremely limited amount of money, a shoe-string production. It was food for deep thought. Martin advocated that we had no choice but to lodge outside of Edinburgh? Nobody knew anyone in the city, no contacts, or inside knowledge. Transportation issues getting to, then back from the Gilded Balloon was up in the air. We still didn’t know how many members of the cast would remain? This vital decision would have to be made, when we knew who would be in the company. We arrived in London, dropped off Martin, drove across the town east, filled up, and I just managed to get the car back within the 24 hours. Took the underground back home, taking my parking permit out of the hire car, along with my bag. Finally, got home, picked up the Dodge, put in the permit, drove the short distance back.\n\nAs I entered the bedroom, checked the answering machine, the light was blinking. The first message was from my agent. Would you know? I had an interview early next week. It was for a TV show called Eurocops. It was for a Polish character called Kowska. Sounded up my street. I´d call her the next morning to confirm. Thank goodness, an interview at last. I knew too well what doing my own project meant: a long period of unemployment. Still, the following morning, I called Maureen Vincent, she told me that my interview was with Roy Battersby, the director. It was in the West End. Another advantage of this flat location, was that I could walk to the West End, or City. The City was closer. To reach Hungerford Bridge and The Strand, I just headed due north, following Webber Street, emerging at the side of the Old Vic Theatre. From there, you could walk up Cornwall Street, by the Royal Festival Hall and then cross over the bridge.\n\nThat’s exactly what I did, when I went to meet Roy Battersby. I shook his hand and made eye contact, as I always did. We sat down, and chatted. This is precisely the kind of audition I much prefer. You don’t have to prove that you can act, every single time, by learning the “sides”, and turning in a complete performance. The whole process is based on an overwhelming number of actors being available, ready to be video tested. He didn’t even ask if I could speak with a Polish accent? Judging from my CV and agent, he trusted me. I had certain techniques for getting me work. Listening, paying attention to my interviewer, making intelligent observations. Walked out of the office, confident. Sure enough, a few days later, I was booked. She gave me the dates, during a week in early May. It felt great to be earning money again. It was 3 days filming, plus extras, like a read-through, and costume fitting, which they would pay me for. My agent asked if I could agree to do a stunt? The episode was called “Pushed”, where a Polish immigrant is thrown through a mall shop window. Maureen assured me that the window would be made of “sugar glass”, and it would do me no harm. Of course, I was up for it. Stunts I liked, I was fit and in good shape. The money was excellent, being produced by Independent Television. It crossed my mind that maybe I could go to Canada?\n\n1989-90 Story Part 5.\n\nAt the end of April, I took the underground to Maida Vale, for the first read-through of Eurocops. I´d already received the script a few days before, and I was pleased with my part. I had 3 scenes. One in particular was terrific. It was a long interview with George Jackson, the leading detective. Definitely one for the showreel. I was in two other scenes: at a door, with an older character. One outside the mall shop window, with a couple of thugs, just about to throw me through it. The main reason for having a showreel had just changed drastically. It would help me to get an agent in Toronto. Radically different from my original plan.\n\nI went into the rehearsal room, and there were a few familiar faces in there, particularly John Benfield, who was with me in Dick Whittington, the Bubble pantomime at the Secombe Centre in Sutton in 1983. I hadn’t seen him since then. When he told me that he was playing Jackson, I was delighted. John and I had a special performance relationship. We just enjoyed acting with each other. The read-through went well. I used a piece of timing in the door scene, that drew the biggest laugh of the read-through. A few actors complimented me after the reading, including the director.\n\nThe next week was spent wardrobe fitting, and shooting my scenes. I took the tube to a location to shoot the door scene. It went well. The director was pleased. A couple of days later, I took the overground train up to a northern suburb of London. It had a shopping mall. I arrived in the morning to the set. It was a hive of activity. The “sugar glass” window was right there. A stuntman took me aside, talking me through the stunt. We then went through the move with the two actors that would throw me through the shop window. It was a one shot deal. They only had one sugar glass shop window. We rehearsed as much as we could. A stuntman spent some time with me, showing me the best way to take the push. My head would go first. He assured me that the glass wouldn’t harm me. He showed me"
