        "text": "FATHER ALF’S HOMILY\n\n25.08.24 ~ 21st SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME\n\n(To hear audio file ~click here)\n\nAs I was reading today’s scriptures, an old song from ‘The Clash’ came into my head. “Should I stay or should I go? If I go there will be trouble, and if I stay it will be double, so you gotta let me know, should I stay or should I go?” Most of us, at some point in our lives, will have reached a crossroads and, as the name suggests, had to make a decision on which way to go. Some may have found it easy, like those people who plunge straight into the cold water of a swimming pool, others take forever, dipping their toe in bit by bit, before committing. Either way, the decision we made will have been a major turning point, and that’s what we’re seeing in the theme of today’s Mass.\n\nJoshua’s challenge, as the Israelites are about to enter the Promised Land, “Choose today whom you wish to serve”, came after a long speech, in which he recalled all that God had done for them. In the history of the Covenant God made with his people, this is a real turning point. The people are free to go or stay. If they go back to worshipping the gods of Egypt or adapt to the gods of the Amorites in the Promised land, it might mean trouble. But, if they stay faithful to the true God of Israel, they will have to live by different values and customs from their contemporaries, which may well cause them double trouble. It’s a tricky one, but their choice is, “We will serve the one Lord, for he is our God”.\n\nIn the gospel there’s a major turning point for the followers of Jesus, over 5000 of whom he had fed with five loaves and two fish. Now, they are asked to choose. Will they go or will they stay? Most choose to go. In some ways you can’t blame them. The very idea of eating and drinking the flesh and blood of Jesus is intolerable language. “How could anyone accept it”, they say. Of course, at this stage they have no idea he is talking of the Eucharist, because the Last Supper hasn’t taken place. Nor have the 12 apostles. So, when he asks them, In the face of near total rejection from the huge crowd, “What about you: do you want to go away too?”, he is staking everything on their response. Imagine his relief and the sheer joy of hearing “Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life”. It’s a phenomenal act of faith on their part, because, up to now, they have only had glimpses of who he truly is. Yet it’s enough for them to commit their lives to him.\n\nIn today’s second reading, we see another major turning point in life; the commitment to marriage. St Paul says that the union of man and wife is so holy a mystery, that it symbolizes the marriage of Christ and his Church, which is the model put before every engaged couple, as they prepare to make their life-long commitment to their partner. Husband and wife must think less of themselves as individuals and more of each other as a couple. Marriage vows affirm the choice to stay, not to go.\n\nBut long before that, the first major turning point in the life of a Christian is Baptism, the beginning of our long journey to the Promised Land of Heaven. It’s the time when you have to decide should I stay or should I go? When I ask parents and godparents, ”Do you promise to bring your child up in the Faith?” they always say yes, which sounds fantastic, like the Israelites promising to serve the one Lord, or the apostles staying with Jesus, because he has the words of eternal life. But, in reality, very few honour their promise to go with Jesus, to take their children on that journey, preferring to stay with the more familiar pagan gods of football, celebrity, fashion or whatever the world has to offer.\n\n“What about you?” is a question Christ asks of all his disciples, in a world which largely rejects the gospel. Like Joshua, he always leaves us free to go, and many do. It’s understandable that people find it easier to blend in with what’s trending on social media, than what the Church teaches. You can like or dislike, not commit to anything, and avoid speaking up for your faith. But that’s not the Christian way. Jesus says, “If anyone declares himself for me in the presence of men, I will declare myself for him in the presence of my Father in heaven. But the one who disowns me before men, I will disown in the presence of my Father”. So, think about that: ask yourself, “Do I stay or do I go?”\n\n18.08.24 ~ 20th SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME\n\n(To hear audio file ~ click here)\n\nOn the news this week there was talk of a great breakthrough for the use of British air space. Was it solar powered aircraft or giant helium propelled transport balloons? No – it was Amazon, announcing a fleet of drones which will deliver your order to your door, only one hour after you’ve ordered it. Some may see that as fantastic service and amazing concern for the consumer, but let’s not forget, the more stuff they get rid of, the richer they get. But, what about those addicted to shopping? A lady I once knew used to sit in front of her tele all day ordering stuff, all of which was piled up around her, like the Old Curiosity Shop, lots of parcels not even opened. A man I knew couldn’t resist a Bogof and always ordered the two. Wisdom for Amazon certainly, but is it folly for those who can’t wait?\n\nIn the Old Testament, Wisdom is always personified as a woman and, in Proverbs, there is a delightful verse which tells of her role in the Creation. “I was beside the Master Craftsman, delighting him day after day, ever at play in his presence, everywhere on his earth, delighting to be with the children of men”. She is completely wrapped up in the love of God, entranced by his creativity and the beautiful works of his hands. But in today’s extract from Proverbs, there’s another woman, and her name is Folly. She is not quite so impressed with what the Lord has done. Both these ladies invite people to share the food they have prepared. Wisdom has built a house on seven pillars, seven being the sign of perfection, which means she has put down roots and settled among us, as the means to save us from Folly, but, as we know from our own experience, Folly does not give up easily.\n\nI was talking to a young couple planning to get married, the other day, who are very aware that, having been brought up in a consumerist society, they can be easily infected with the desire for instant gratification, which, when taken to extremes, can be summed up as “I want it all, and I want it now”. We talked about how in the old days, people used to wait until they got married before living together. During the courtship, the emphasis would be on preparation for a completely new way of life, the anticipation of which was the spur to work hard and save up, to achieve something worth waiting for. I suspect that the majority of married couples who did it that way round, are still together.\n\nIn the letter to the Hebrews, the author says, “For the sake of the joy that lay in the future, Jesus willingly went to the cross”. It’s a rather sobering way of saying some things are worth suffering for. The pain of childbirth is often forgotten when a mother holds her newborn. Olympic athletes would never dream of just turning up on the day and expect to win a medal, without years of training, which often includes injuries and setbacks. Instant gratification doesn’t last. Working through a pain barrier, overcoming obstacles, and persevering in the pursuit of the joy which lies in the future, produces long term results, for ourselves and, like Wisdom, those among whom we live, move and have our being.\n\nIn the recent riots, we saw hundreds of people use the murder of three little girls as justification to loot and steal things they would normally have to work to pay for, which was a wicked thing to do, a victory for Folly over Wisdom. 2000 years ago, St Paul wrote “This may be a wicked age, but your lives should redeem it”. How? Slowly and with conviction. For example, St Peter, writing about the dignity of women, based on Our Lord’s teaching on equality, was well aware that their right to be equal partners in a male dominated society, could not change overnight. So, he encouraged them not to draw attention to their outward appearances, but to go quietly on proving their innate dignity as equally beloved children of God our Father, by the way they lived the gospel. In the long term this small but necessary step would change perceptions and overturn the injustice of their situation.\n\nSimilarly, in our own time, much injustice and wickedness abound, and our lives should redeem it. We know we can’t do it without the strength of Christ which comes from the food he provides in the Eucharist. “My flesh is real food, and my blood is real drink. He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood lives in me and I live in him”. So, at the risk of being mocked, misunderstood or dismissed as being out of touch, if we try to do our best to live the gospel in the quiet conviction of always having in mind the joy that lies in the future, we might just help to redeem this wicked age.\n\n11.08.24 ~ 19th SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME\n\n(To hear audio file ~ click here)\n\nLast week, there was a programme on the radio called ‘God Next Door’. It was about a landscape gardener from Wythenshawe called James, who thinks he is God, not a god, or a messenger from God, but the Absolute Divinity, a conviction which is shared by a few locals. His mission is to bring peace to the world using fitness sessions, games and Q&A evenings. He looks and dresses like any other young man of our time but, unless he begins to perform miracles and the kind of things people expect from God, not many will be convinced. I mention James because there’s an echo in him of what we see in today’s gospel. Jesus proclaimed, “I am the bread come down from heaven” but is not accepted, especially by those who’ve known him all his life as the son of Joseph and Mary, simple people like themselves. Other people feel the same: he’s too much like us to have come from heaven,\n\nOn Tuesday it was the feast of the Transfiguration. Up till that moment, the apostles saw only what everybody else saw – a man like them, although blessed with extraordinary powers, but now they are given a glimpse of his divinity, manifested in blinding brightness. What’s going on, and why are Moses and Elijah talking about what is to happen? Was Jesus wavering? Was he thinking he’d had enough, knowing that, regardless of the signs given, he will be rejected? Were they there to encourage him to persevere, knowing, from their own experience, how utterly alone he would be, especially in Gethsemane the night before the whole nation turns against him? If they were, it was understandable. Both of them had wanted to give up, Elijah when the people failed to turn back to God, even after his outstanding victory over the prophets of Baal: Moses, when, in spite of leading them out of slavery, they rebelled against God, and started worshipping a golden calf. They’d both had enough, but God made it clear their work wasn’t done. But whatever was said on that mountain, and, although the apostles wanted to stay there for ever, Jesus insisted they must return to the mission field and carry on\n\nI think it’s fair to say that many of us will have, at some time, been tempted by setbacks or ingratitude to throw in the towel. ‘Why do I even bother’, may be a refrain you’ve heard yourself saying. But then, remember that we have accepted the invitation to be Christ’s disciples, and in doing so have accepted all that goes with it which, as with him, can mean rejection, frustration and dispiriting failure. It goes with the territory. But, before we throw in the towel, think about what’s happening in today’s gospel. Jesus says “No-one can come to me unless he is drawn by the Father who sent me”. The fact that we are here today is because the Father has drawn us to Jesus, but we still have a lot to learn. It was the same with the apostles. Although they were very privileged to see his glory on Tabor, they still had a long way to go. For example, when they were ordered to tell no-one about what they’d seen until after he had risen from the dead, they hadn’t a clue what he was talking about and were too frightened to ask. Besides, back down among the people he looked exactly the same as he always did. Slowly, slowly, they were being drawn by the Father to learn more about Jesus and why he had come.\n\nLike them, we too are being slowly drawn by the Father to a deeper union with Christ. How does the Father draw us on? Unsurprisingly, very like an earthly parent. When I was in Carlisle with Fr Gerry, there was a little boy who used to ask his dad questions out loud during Mass. “What’s he doing dad? Is he doing the washing up dad”? Because of the way I held the host up, he thought it was an owl, so when I consumed it, he blurted out, “Dad, he’s eaten it”. In the background I could hear the low rumble of his dad’s voice quietly explaining what was going on. Recently, we had Matt’s lovely view from the pew, reflecting on how he finds the loving power of parish community life, in the safest and most nurturing of environments, to be invaluable to Anna's upbringing in a myriad of ways.\n\nIf we look back on our own lives we may see how we have been drawn on by the Father in a similar way. He uses our parents, our teachers, the Church, the scriptures, to teach us to appreciate all Jesus has done for us. We know we won’t see him transfigured in glory in this life but are still happy to experience the intimacy of being in his presence, whenever we receive him in holy communion. All we’re asked to do is trust him, as Elijah, Moses and the apostles did, despite many disappointments and trials, knowing he will continue to draw us to the ultimate goal he wants for all his children: our complete union with Christ forever, in heaven, in the glory of the Blessed Trinity and all the saints.\n\n04.08.24 ~ 18th SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME\n\n(To hear audio file ~ click here)\n\nLast weekend was a celebration of grandparents, and quite right too, for all the love and care they lavish on their grandchildren. Jim Bellamy told me of a post on Facebook, of a beautiful, fresh-faced child looking at her grandad’s wrinkled face, and asking ‘Grandad, who made you?” “God made me” he said. “Grandad, did God make me too? “Yes, he did Sweetheart”. After a pause, she replied, “He’s getting better, isn’t he”.\n\nFacebook has come up quite a lot in conversation this week, and not because all the posts are as sweet as the one Jim quoted. Several people have told me of nasty posts about the demolition of St Edmunds: “the Pope wants more money; they’ll be building houses there now for illegal immigrants; it’s disgusting – I made my 1st HC there”. When he read that last one, a parishioner said he was tempted to reply, “Well if you’d been coming to St Edmund’s regularly, and brought your children, it might yet still be here”.\n\nTrolling, seeing negativity in everything, and bad-mouthing people you know very little about, is not new. It’s part of original sin and was considered so destructive, that it was included in the ten commandments – “Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour”. That’s not as eye-catching a commandment as murder, adultery or theft, but malicious gossip is just as lethal. What’s different today is the sheer volume and extent of its malevolence, made possible by unregulated social media, as we saw in Southport earlier in the week and many towns since. Thousands were aroused, by co-ordinated posts, to inflict maximum damage, on police and property, based on the say-so of undocumented agitators, with no possession, or proof, of the facts.\n\nSo, how do we Christians deal with it? Firstly, it’s important not to respond in kind. As we see from the escalating conflict in the Middle East, retaliation does no good whatsoever. Besides, we’re supposed to love our enemies. One way is to look at what St Paul’s letter to the Ephesians has to say. He talks about the aimless kind of life that pagans live, and urges us to avoid it; to live as a new man in the goodness and holiness of the truth, as exemplified in Christ: and, how did he deal with the trolls of his day, who caused his death? He asked his Father to forgive them, as they didn’t understand what they were doing. In a similar way, we have to rise above the hatred and vitriol, being spewed out on social media, a) by refusing to join in spreading evil about people: b) if we do decide to respond, to make sure not to assassinate anyone’s character, but simply speak up for the truth. c) to pray for a change of heart in those, who don’t really understand the harm they are causing.\n\nNot helping to fuel the fire may feel like being alone in a hostile desert, but we’re not alone. God will provide. As we saw in Exodus, the Israelites accuse Moses of wanting to starve them to death in a hostile desert, which was certainly not true. But, with the whole community complaining against him, can you imagine how alone he felt? Luckily, there was no internet then, otherwise their complaints would have gone viral. Think of the joy and schadenfreude, their erstwhile Egyptian slave masters, would have derived, from knowing how badly things were going for the Israelites. But Moses wasn’t alone. God provided and the people stopped grumbling, at least for a while. Unfortunately, it wouldn’t be long before they began to grumble again, while taking the Manna for granted. The daily miracle didn’t seem to bring them any closer to God who provided it.\n\nSomething similar happens in the gospel. Jesus had fed the 5000 but it’s obvious they hadn’t understood what the miracle is pointing them to. “You’re not looking for me because you have seen the signs, but because you had all the bread you wanted to eat. That bread doesn’t last. You’ll need more tomorrow. Work for food that endures to eternal life”. He means, look beyond worldly needs, to God the source of all life, who is so much greater. Sensing from those words that he has more to offer than just filling empty stomachs, they ask why they should believe in him. His reply is “On me the Father, God himself, has set his seal. I am the Bread which comes down from heaven, for the life of the world. He who comes to me will never hunger or thirst” to which we could add ”for the understanding of the true purpose and meaning of what life is all about”. If we get that, we have the key to dealing with all hatred, internet-based or otherwise.\n\nThe whole point of being fed regularly here with the bread of life, is to put Christ at the centre of all we say and do. With him underpinning our own lives, and the way we deal with others, doing our best to keep his two great commandments, ‘Love God and your neighbour as yourself, we’re hardly likely to exercise hatred and cruelty, be it face to face, or as a cowardly keyboard warrior, hiding behind anonymity.\n\n28.07.24 ~ 17th SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME\n\n(To hear audio file ~ click here)\n\nOn Friday, in spite of a co-ordinated attack on the French railways by saboteurs, we had the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in Paris. For the next few weeks we will be watching finely-tuned athletes, at the peak of their fitness, competing at the very highest level to be the strongest, highest and fastest. St Paul, who was very familiar with the original Olympic Games, 2000 years ago, often uses images of athletics, as metaphors for the Christian life. As individuals, we must fight the good fight, run the race to the finish and keep the faith, to win a crown that will last forever. But, we’re also members of a team. We are different parts of the Body of Christ which all need each other if it is to function properly. This interconnectedness is vitally important, because it allows us to feed off each other’s gifts and talents, to share what each of us has, for the common good, and for our neighbour, whom we are commanded by Jesus to love as we love ourselves. Today, we see that command put into action by Jesus himself.\n\nA human body needs a sustainable environment to live in, which includes food, warmth and shelter. Jesus picks up on this when he makes the decision to feed those 5000 plus hungry people, stranded without food or shelter in a lonely place. What’s important to note is how he does it. He is well aware, that most of them have followed him to the lakeside, not for himself, but because they’re impressed by his miracles. It would have been so easy to impress them even more, by conjuring up bread and fish from thin air, but that would only have caused even more people to follow him, for all the wrong reasons. Instead, he chooses to teach them how grace builds on nature, that without God we cannot, but without us he will not. So, he decides to feed them with the cooperation of a small boy who’s willing to share the little he has for the common good.\n\nSuch generosity, no matter how small, lets God in, and through it, God does what he does best, provides for his people. This is how God works in the world, so if we truly want to be a blessing to others, we should bring to Jesus what we have, because, as we see in this story, in his hands a little goes a long way. By collaborating with the little boy, he prepares the ground for Paul’s teaching, which I mentioned earlier, that the Church is the Body of Christ, in which we all work in partnership with him. If we share with others what we have received, be it our time, talents or treasure, they will multiply and overflow to where they’re needed. We’re all blessed in different ways, so we can’t all offer the same things. God will never ask of us what we haven’t got, but we’ve all got something we can share, no matter how small, and it’s that we should offer.\n\nOn Thursday I watched the story of a young man from Cornwall called Chris Parry who, when he saw the plight of the Ukrainian people, unable to flee from the Russian bombardments, went out there to volunteer as an evacuator, driving a jeep to the Front Line, to rescue people, mainly elderly, from their bombed-out homes and take them to safety. He could not speak Ukrainian, had no weapon, no military or medical experience, but felt he had to do something, which he did, often accepting solo assignments to places nobody else was willing to go. This eventually got him killed, shot dead by Wagner mercenaries. He’s credited with bringing out over 400 stranded civilians, in twos and threes, which meant a huge number of journeys into that Hell hole. I don’t know if he was a Christian, although, coincidentally, the name Christopher means Christ Bearer, but what he did was extremely Christlike, giving his life to save others. He generously gave what he could.\n\nWhether Chris was Christian or not, it’s important to remember that Christ died for the whole of humanity, and made it clear that ’He who is not against us is for us’. So, anyone who gives of themselves for others, is a partner of Christ, even if they do not know him. This is shown by what happens after all, presumably Jewish, have been fed. At Cana, Jesus had provided far more wine than was needed, and he does the same with the bread and fish. The apostles fill twelve baskets, one for each of them, but what does it mean to have so much left over?. This clearly wasn’t a litter-picking exercise. The bread will last and provide for those weren’t there: nothing gets wasted. The superabundance means that there’s plenty left for everyone.\n\nTelling the apostles to pick up the pieces, is his way of signifying their future role in distributing the food of everlasting life, the Eucharist, for all those who come later, should they accept his invitation to the banquet. We are those people, blessed to have been included in the leftovers. Over the next few Sundays, we will see Our Lord build on today’s unpromising start, of people just wanting to see miracles, to introduce the concept of his being the living bread, come down from heaven, for the life of the world.\n\n21.07.24 ~ 16th SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME\n\n(To hear audio file ~ click here)\n\nSeeing Annie’s note offering to take our petitions to Lourdes, reminded me of a story of a young man from Lancashire, who was in love with two girls, Jane and Maria, and couldn’t make up his mind which one to ask to marry him. So, he went to his parish priest for some advice, who told him to go on pilgrimage to Lourdes and to ask Our Lady. No sooner had he got there, he saw his prayers were answered. Above the Rosary Basilica in huge letters, were the words “Ave Maria”.\n\nGoing on pilgrimage, to see the places where and why God has intervened, always leaves us with a deeper appreciation of our faith. Those of us who went to the Holy Land recently, came away greatly enriched by hearing the words of the gospel in the very places they were first spoken by Our Lord. One of them was the Mount of the Beatitudes where Christ fed the 5000 immediately after the events in today’s gospel. The apostles, having been sent out by Christ for their first taste of missionary work, have just returned, bubbling like excited children, bursting to tell him all about their adventures and what they had accomplished. He, in turn, no doubt after congratulating them, sees that they are worn out and need a break from “so many coming and going that they had no time even to eat”. He suggests they go off to a lonely place where they can rest and recover. On arrival a large crowd is waiting for them. On seeing this, Jesus decides to take over, and sets himself to teach the crowd at some length, thus allowing the apostles to maybe get their heads down.\n\nAs for the apostles, they must have been pretty impressed to see all these people chasing after them to hear more. Their message had obviously hit home much more powerfully than what they usually heard from their own ‘shepherds’ and rulers, who had allowed the flock of God to be destroyed and scattered. King Herod lived in luxury in a huge palace, courtesy of cosying up to the Roman Forces of Occupation. The Pharisees occupied the Chair of Moses, took the place of honour at banquets and the front seats in the synagogues and so on. ‘Scattered sheep’ from all the surrounding towns, rush to a remote, lonely place, hungry to hear more from the apostles, the true shepherds, Jeremiah prophesied, whom God would raise up for them, when the ‘Virtuous Branch for David, who will reign as a true and wise king” comes. Jesus had sent the apostles out with no earthly resources, no purse, haversack or spare tunic. He insisted that they were to rely on God’s providence, to ensure they did not become self-serving, like the bad shepherds Jeremiah refers to. Their job was to lead people to Jesus, which is exactly what happens in this story, and it is Jesus who satisfies their hunger.\n\nIf ever there was a time when the world was full of scattered sheep, it is now, awash as it is with thousands fleeing starvation or persecution, often from their own self-serving leaders, who live in luxury. Self-interest also raises its ugly head in supposed more enlightened Democracies, with people held in thrall to politicians unable to see beyond their own country’s interests, promising anything which they think might be popular, in order to get elected. It’s ironic that a certain country, made up of immigrants from around the world, who took the land from its natives, wants to build a wall to keep other would-be immigrants out, an attitude very similar to that of pro-abortionists who, although having been allowed to be born themselves, deny that basic human right to other babies.\n\nOnly Christ, whom Jeremiah calls “The Lord-our-integrity” can sort the mess out, and he needs us, as good shepherds who really care about our fellow human beings, to help him do it. Like the apostles we must point people in his direction, introduce him into ordinary, everyday conversations about the kind of issues I’ve just mentioned. It’s very important that his voice is heard whenever we come across injustice, be it in our own country or on the world stage. Don’t shake your head and feel helpless. Write to your MP. Support protest marches. Don’t worry about what to say – the Holy Spirit will provide, as he did for the Apostles. The mission of the Church doesn’t depend on politics or patriotism. It comes entirely from Christ’s compassion for people with no shepherd and no hope.\n\n14.07.24 ~ 15th SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME ~ SEA SUNDAY\n\nI’m sure you all know the one about a rather condescending Mayor visiting an Old Folks’ Home, dressed in all his finery, who asked one of the residents, “Do you know who I am”? He replied, “No, but if you ask Matron, she’ll tell you”. In today’s first reading Amaziah, the high priest of Bethel, is more than condescending to Amos, a lowly shepherd, sent to warn him that God was going to punish the people of Bethel, if they didn’t stop exploiting the poor. He accuses Amaziah of getting into bed with leading politicians and the elite, and benefitting from their patronage, while God’s people starve. Sad to say, that sort of thing has also happened in the Church from time to time, and is even now, as witness the Patriarch of Moscow’s support for Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Rather than pay heed to the message, Amaziah, decides to attack the messenger, to make it personal, as people do when they feel they’re losing an argument. He dismisses him as a small-time seer, not worthy to be heard in the royal sanctuary, the national temple where the State religion exists to promote loyalty to the status quo. Amos retorts that he has no claim to be a prophet. He’s a simple farmer, given a job to do by God and he must obey God not man. Take it or leave it.\n\nThis idea of take it or leave it, is very much at the heart of today’s gospel too. Last week we saw Jesus rejected by his own villagers in Nazareth, as he would be later by most of his contemporaries, but, as I mentioned, he still faced the music and danced. Today we see him involving the apostles for the first time, sending them out to spread his message, but without softening it. “If they refuse to listen, shake off the dust from your feet, and move on”. It’s a direct challenge, and when the apostles return, they report that some did, others didn’t, which it is how it’s meant to be. No-one is forced to follow Christ. Our job as disciples is simply to invite, as Jesus did with the first two apostles: “Come and See”. Of course, that might not be as easy as it sounds.\n\nIn the Sunday Times last week there was an article called ‘Help, I’m a people pleaser’. It was all about our fear of upsetting anyone. Examples were, do you automatically say sorry if someone bumps into you and it’s not your fault? Do you outwardly agree with opinions you internally disagree with? Do you say yes to plans when you already feel overloaded? Do you allow someone to call you the wrong name for years? Looking back on my life, I think I may be one. I usually answer the waitress who asks “Is everything all right with the meal?” with “Yes, thank you” even if the steak needs a chainsaw to cut it. I haven’t found the courage yet to ask a friend to turn his phone off when we’re playing golf. However, I did recently tell an elderly man my name is Alf, after he’d been calling me Ged for quite some time, but that was only to spare him ending up like a certain American President. The article went on to say that people pleasers often end up in lopsided friendships, trapped in cycles of endless plans because they can’t work out how to say no without hurting someone’s feelings, or being the one to make all the effort to keep the relationship alive.\n\nEven if we’re not a people pleaser, many of us will feel we are not the right person to introduce people to Christ. If so, we’re in good company. The Apostles, like Amos, were amateurs, and did not have special missionary training. They simply let the Holy Spirit speak through their mouths and act through their hands. We’re amateurs too. Very few of us have been sent by God to proclaim the gospel in far-off lands, in public, on the beach or in the townhall. But all of us, as disciples of Christ, are asked to witness to the gospel in our daily lives, at home, at work or in our neighbourhood, relying totally on the Holy Spirit, to awaken the times we live in, to the mystery of Jesus and his kingdom.\n\nOf course, some might possibly argue from Paul’s letter to the Ephesians today, that we are just pawns in a great cosmic game, predestined to be saved or not as the case may be, and, if that is the case, what’s the point of sharing the good news? But not so. Paul makes it very clear, “God has let us know the mystery of his purpose, the hidden plan he so kindly made in Christ from the beginning. Each, by faith, freely chooses for or against God.”. It’s all there. We don’t have to argue with people or upset them by being too pushy. We simply need to show that our Faith is a natural expression of who we are, the source of our joy. After that, it’s up to them to take it or leave it.\n\n07.07.24 ~ 14th SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME\n\n(To hear audio file ~ click here)\n\n“There may be troubles ahead, but while there’s moonlight, music, love and romance, let’s face the music and dance”. Facing the music: we’ve all had to do that from time to time, and it seems to be the theme running through today’s scriptures. All three main characters see troubles ahead, but they all face the music and dance through them. Ezekiel knows his mission to the rebel Israelites will be ignored but goes anyway. Paul is inhibited by a thorn in the flesh, but soldiers on regardless. Jesus knows he was predicted to be a sign of contradiction but still begins his mission. All three are aware that they did not choose their mission: God chose it for them, which means that, no matter if people listen or not, his messengers must be faithful and speak the words God wants his people to hear.\n\nYou might wonder in the face of such opposition why God would bother. It’s because he never waivers in his love for us, and will never abandon the covenant he has made with us, even if we do. He’s like Gabriel Oak in ‘Far from the Madding Crowd’ who never gives up on Bathsheba Everdene, who leads him a merry song and dance, before he finally wins her heart when she comes to realise how loyal and faithful he has remained, in spite of her cavalier treatment and ingratitude.\n\nAs Christians, like St Paul, we are called to continue Christ’s mission to win people back for God, even when obstacles, such as people’s desire to be constantly entertained, overcome the need for serious conversation. I had ten minutes to spare before the 10pm news on Thursday, which was due to start with the Exit polls for the general election. So, I flicked through the channels and landed on Love Island, which I’ve heard a lot about but never watched. For 5 minutes I watched a muscle-toned hunk, trying to decide which pneumatically endowed goddess he would select, from a harem draped around the pool. I don’t know how it ended as I soon lost the will to live. Some of you may feel the same about football. But, I wondered to myself, if the millions of people who watch it, think that’s real life. Like a lot of “Reality TV”, a misnoma if ever I heard one, it has echoes of ‘Bread and Circuses’, the method used by the ancient Romans, to keep the people happy, and divert their attention from having anything to do with the things that really matter. In our day, the things that really matter are climate change, social justice, an end to so many conflicts, and equal distribution of the world’s resources, none of which will happen if people ignore God, which, with so many diversions, is easy to do.\n\nThis isn’t something new: we’re not unique. It has always been like this. People don’t change. Every generation since time began, has had people who ignore God. But because, as I said earlier, he will never give up on us, he continuous to send messengers to call them back, and we just happen to be his messengers at this time in history. Some of you might think, “I couldn’t possibly do that. I’m not good enough, clever enough or brave enough”. But, without the power of the Holy Spirit, nor were any of those prophets God sent in earlier times. Remember, the Holy Spirit’s still here: he hasn’t gone on holiday. So, we shouldn’t be held back by thinking no-one will listen to us. Whether people listen or not is up to them, but they should know, as God said to Ezekiel, that there is a prophet among them, ie someone who lives his/her life in the presence of the living God, and is happy to make him known..\n\nBeing a modern-day prophet can take many forms. As you know, in our secular society, a culture of death is slowly creeping in as a panacea for all social ills. MPs have proposed assisted dying, not just for the terminally ill, but for anyone fed up with life. They also want abortion up to birth, not just for medical reasons, but to make it virtually on demand. In contrast to such negative thinking, at 17yr old Summer Atkinson’s funeral on Thursday, her mum, Stacey, proclaimed, to a largely non-church-going congregation, that she felt truly blessed to have been entrusted by God with the precious life of her disabled child. It was a powerful counter-cultural statement, from an ordinary person, about the sanctity of human life in whatever form it comes to us. People may or may not have agreed with her, but at least they heard the word of God from a prophet among them. My prayer is that whatever troubles come our way, personally, or as Christians called to be light to the world, and salt to the earth, on the things that really matter, all of us will face the music and dance, as followers of Jesus, the Lord of the Dance himself, “who has leapt up high and will never, never die”.\n\n30.06.24 ~ FEAST OF SAINTS PETER & PAUL\n\n(To hear audio file ~ click here)\n\nOn Wednesday I had to make a difficult choice, whether to watch the leadership debate between Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer, or Georgia v Portugal in the Euros. It was quite difficult, but after about ten seconds I chose the football. However, I caught the highlights of the debate later, one of which was a man asking both leaders “Of all the people in this great country of ours, are you two really the best we’ve got?” It’s a question many people in America are asking about Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Today we are celebrating the feast of St Peter and Paul. Had they been subject to a leadership contest, would the early Christians have asked the same question? Luckily for them, their leadership was by divine appointment, so the question didn’t arise, but we’re still entitled to ask “What did Jesus see in them which led him to entrust them with the continuation of his work?\n\nPeter was physically strong, a man used to hauling heavy fishing nets. He also had a stubborn streak, unwilling to have his feet washed by Christ, and an overinflated idea of his own courage, begging Jesus to let him walk on the water, and bragging that, should all the others desert him, he would certainly not. Well, we all know what happened there. Paul was mentally strong, very clever, well educated, with powerful connections, filled with fanatical zeal and ready to destroy Christianity before it really got going. As we know, he got his comeuppance on the road to Damascus and had to eat humble pie. Even after such a dramatic conversion, though, his character didn’t really change. He had his own way of doing things, could be impatient and didn’t suffer fools gladly. You wouldn’t call him a romantic, and yet he wrote that great hymn to love which thousands choose for their wedding. But it’s no surprise that his version of love is not the sloppy sentimental kind, but real self-sacrificing giving of oneself – the nitty gritty of patience, kindness, not taking offence, lack of envy etc.\n\nBoth Peter and Paul, in their respective apostolates, brought to fruition the kingdom Christ came to inaugurate on earth, to which we are proud to belong, and, like them, we are called to do the same. So, how did they do it? Clearly, they were both independently minded characters, but, by submitting their own wills to Christ’s, and their openness to the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, these two unlikely characters made it clear, that God can, and does, use all sorts of people, some we’d never have thought capable, to do his work, and often with spectacular results. He asks for neither strength nor willpower: only love. Don’t forget he calls and empowers whoever he likes. No matter how poorly equipped, lacking in talent or sinful we consider ourselves to be, he can do wonderful things through anyone who answers the call. As Paul says, “It is the Lord who stands by me and gives me power”.\n\nGoing back to the election, we are promised many beneficial things which we are assured will be fully costed and easy to deliver, as though politicians think we’re only interested in what we can get. But the gospel teaches us to think the opposite, paraphrasing JFK’s inaugural address “My fellow citizens, ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country” a sentiment taken directly from Catholic Social Teaching, which is all about service to the Common Good. So, what can Christians do for the common good, at this particular time of general malaise and dire political woes? A parishioner told me the other day, that a lady she works with is intrigued by what Christianity has to offer, to a world she’s completely disillusioned with, as it seems to have no purpose besides birth, a meaningless life, then death. I suspect she’s not the only one. In the Post Office a lady expressed concern about so many young people dying? Have they no reason to live?\n\nWith all this searching for meaning and purpose going on, I think the time is right, to help people by sharing our gift of faith in a completely natural way, making our relationship with Jesus a normal part of conversation. We don’t have to give the whole church package. We can simply say something like, “I find my faith in Jesus helps me to deal with most things” then leave it to the Holy Spirit to do his thing. In this simple way we can actively get the gospel message of Hope out there. We know the influence of the Church is not as great as it used to be, but we also know from experience, reassured by Christ’s promise to Peter, that “The gates of Hell will never prevail against it\". So, let’s continue to fight the good fight, run the race to the finish, keep the faith, and share it with those who need it most.\n\n23.06.24 ~ 12th SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME\n\n(To hear audio file ~ click here)\n\nWhen I was studying for the Priesthood at Valladolid 50 years ago in Spain, there were quite a few protest rallies against the UK for the return of Gibraltar. On one particular day, a huge crowd was demonstrating outside the British Embassy in Madrid, banging drums, blowing whistles and generally causing mayhem, all of which caused the Ambassador to go down to the gates to talk to the crowd. When it had finally stopped shouting “We want Gibraltar”, he calmly replied, “Well it isn’t in here, you know”, at which many of the protesters burst out laughing. The passionate Spaniards thought his cool, understated reply was hilarious, and it completely defused the situation.\n\nTo be able to keep a cool head, when all around there’s chaos, fear or panic, and restore calm, is a wonderful gift, something Jesus had in spades, as we know from his many clashes with the Pharisees, when to have lost his cool, could have landed him in big trouble, long before they finally had him killed. In today’s gospel we see calmness personified. To put it into context, Jesus had been teaching all day at the lakeside, and because so many people had come to listen to him, he had got into the boat and pushed out a bit so they could all see and hear him. This also allowed him to avoid being mobbed by the crowd when he’d finished, and to get some sleep which he clearly needed. Then came the storm, which terrified the apostles and panicked them into waking Jesus, who calmy defused the situation, before giving them a gentle ticking off for their lack of faith in him.\n\nWhen Mark wrote his gospel, 30 years or so after the Resurrection, it was during the Emperor Nero’s persecution of Christianity, which was terrifying. It was one of the many storms the early Church would go through, and, by reminding his readers of what happened on the Sea of Galilee, Mark was exhorting them to have faith in Jesus, who is always there, even when he seems to be asleep\n\nBut, there’s another side to the story. As we saw, preaching all day to his own people had exhausted him, and yet he says, “Let’s cross over to the other side”. The other side was pagan territory, which was a lot tougher proposition. So, was Jesus deliberately giving them a hint of what he would charge them with at the Ascension, “Go therefore, make disciples of all nations”? And was the storm at sea a lesson that, in order to go to the pagans, they would have to leave the calm waters of what they were used to, and brave the gales and waves of uncertainty, trusting only in him whom the sea and wind obey? It seems to me that in every era of our Church history, that’s precisely what he was doing.\n\nAnd so we come to our own times. As I said last week, I truly believe God is doing a new thing and he wants us to be part of it. Our Church storm today is indifference and apathy. It’s not really a storm. We are not being persecuted. Nobody outside of our parishes is really bothered about falling numbers, or whether our church will close. So, there’s no pressure. We are completely free to take risks, and we should, because there’s an awful lot of people looking for something, other than consumerism, to give their life meaning, especially young people aged 15-25, among whom, we are told, there is a growing interest in Catholicism. So, don’t be risk averse. One of the speakers at the Catholic Summit last week said he just introduces people to the unfiltered Jesus, and lets the Holy Spirit do the rest. He meant that when we first share the Gospel, we don’t have to give them the whole Church package. As we heard earlier, the apostles took Jesus in the boat ‘just as he was’ with no frills, and that’s how they presented him to others, who in time, would be given the grace to look at this man but also see God.\n\nUsing today’s image of the sea again, lots of fish swim past the harbour mouth, but none are caught if the boats stay tied up in the harbour. Lots of people pass our churches every day but won’t come in if not invited. Why not risk inviting someone? If they say no, you’ve lost nothing. If they say yes, who knows where the Holy Spirit may lead? Don’t forget, these days conversations on exciting things go viral very quickly. As Cathy Anderton wrote in her reflections on the Summit, “We can sit in our pews which we have sat in for years, and continue to watch our parishes get smaller and smaller, and our churches close, or we can get out there and turn back the tide. It’s not going to be easy, but then, things worth having don’t often come easily. With the Holy Spirit, we know anything is possible.\n\n16.06.24 ~ 11th SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME\n\n(To hear audio file ~ click here)\n\nFrozen or Chosen? You may have heard in the news recently that the tiny Austrian village of Halstatt, is being swamped by up to 10,000 tourists every day, because it’s believed to be the model for the Disney film ‘Frozen’. The two hundred villagers have had enough and are going to put a stop to it. No-one buys anything or stays over. They just take selfies and drive on, a bit like people who take a photo of a priceless artwork instead of spending time to appreciate it. You may also have heard of the phenomenal worldwide success of ‘The Chosen’, a beautiful series on the life of Christ, which you can watch free on the Angel App. Very few people who watch it simply move on without taking in the profound message it portrays. So, are you a ‘Frozen’ or ‘Chosen’ when it comes to our Catholic faith?\n\nThe reason I ask is because, with four of our parishioners, I have just got back from the national Catholic Parish Summit, which was all about mission, based on the fact that, in the gospels, Jesus spent 75% of his time evangelising, and we are meant to do the same. Having said that, I’m going to drop the word evangelise, because for us Catholics, it conjures up the image of Jehovah’s Witnesses or Mormons, knocking on doors, interrupting your tea, the Euros or Coronation Street.\n\nI prefer to talk about generously allowing ourselves to be used by the Holy Spirit to tell people, who know nothing about Jesus, the good news, when the occasion arises. Oh good, you might think. That’s not likely to happen very much! And it won’t if you are not generous about sharing the faith, which requires action, going fishing, not sitting in the boat hoping the fish will simply jump in. One of the inspirational speakers told how every morning she prays, “Lord, bring me someone today who I can share you with”. She then applies VIA. Vigilance to spot someone in need. Initiative to start the conversation. Action to help in whatever way the Holy Spirit guides her. I prayed that prayer myself yesterday, and something wonderful happened, which I hope will bear fruit in the next few weeks.\n\nThe reason we went to the Summit is because we are realists. We have accepted the fact that cultural Christianity is dead and gone in our country, and even in our own parishes. Most people coming for baptism or 1st Holy Communion are like the Frozen fans. They don’t join in the life of the parish or come back after the photos. The lapsed are hardly likely to come back to the type of church they have chosen to leave. So, it’s time for change, and I personally believe that God is doing a new thing.\n\nRather than a dead post Christian era, we are entering a new pre-Christian era, in which thousands will be hearing the gospel for the first time, and it’s our privilege to share it with them. For those who think we’re ok as we are, there’s no need to do more, it’s the difference between working in the parish and on the parish. If we want to simply grow old and fade away, we don’t need to do anything at all. It will happen because, each year, we all get a year older. But, if we decide we want to go down and out, ie to lower the average age of our congregation, and boost it with new people who have not heard the gospel, then we have to be church in a different way in this new apostolic age.\n\nThe lead speaker showed us a slide of an archipelago in the Caribbean of which only five or six islands are still above water. Most of the Islanders have gone, but the Mayor and 12 others are determined to stay, making the stilts of their houses ever taller. Soon they will be no more. In our secular society, so many are in the similar danger of being swamped by the rising tide of materialism, addiction, mental health problems, cost of living crisis and the rest. They need rescuing by the Holy Spirit’s lifeboat, in which we are all crew members, working together, to haul aboard those who are drowning. So, it’s time to start taking risks and put out into the deep for a catch.\n\nWith that in mind, I’d like to call a meeting of as many members of our two parishes as possible to create a clear vision for the way ahead. The point is that evangelisation is the work of the Holy Spirit. So be not afraid. All we have to do, is make ourselves available to be used by him, which means we don’t have to fret over success or failure, as though we stand or fall by our own efforts. Like the guy in today’s gospel, we simply do the sowing. God does the rest. It’s like conception, which starts a long, sometimes painful, process to birth, but when it finally comes, everyone wants to hold the baby.\n\n02.06.24 ~ CORPUS CHRISTI\n\n(To hear audio file ~ click here)\n\nYesterday we celebrated the feast of St Justin, Martyr, who was a Palestinian Christian murdered for the Faith in the second century. He had been an unbeliever searching for the meaning of life, when he met an old man who told him he would find it in the Christian Faith, and he did. His life’s work then became to teach and spread the gospel as much as he could by founding a school, to which hundreds of people came over the years. This caused a great deal of jealousy among the pagans, and they contrived to have him executed as an enemy of the gods. Two of the books he wrote survive, one of which, his Apologia, written about 154 AD, says this about the Mass: (Quote from Chapter 65, “Administration of the Sacraments”).\n\nAlthough the nucleus of the Mass has remained constant, the liturgical form has changed many times depending on circumstances. We are all familiar with Mass celebrated in parish churches as well as by thousands in football stadia, or in small gatherings in hospital chapels, schools, prisons, or on a kitchen table. The variety of ways in which Mass is celebrated, represents the infinite variety of tastes and traditions from all over the world. But whatever the style or nation, what unites Catholics throughout the world, is the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist, which is what today’s feast is all about. The Eucharist is the source and summit of Catholic life, and throughout our history many thousands, like St Justin, have given their lives for it.\n\nOne of the most recent to do so, although he wasn’t martyred, was Blessed, soon to be Saint, Carlo Acutis, a 15 yr old computer Whizz, who died of Leukaemia in 2006. He saw the internet as a missionary tool for spreading the gospel. While investigating his cause for beatification, his computer was analysed by forensic technicians to see what websites he visited. There was no pornography, trolling on social media or anything malign. All his research was done for what was very close to his heart, Jesus really present in the Eucharist. He was very concerned by people growing away from the Church and the sacraments and wanted to bring them back. In 2004, he created a website, visited by millions, detailing all the Eucharistic miracles, recognised by the Church, from early Christianity to our own time. Most occurred because of unbelief, even by priests and bishops, as well as a woman who couldn’t believe the bread she had made could become the Body of Christ. For these doubters, blood flowed from the host at the consecration.\n\nCarlo was born in England but brought up in Italy.. His mum never went to Mass before he was born, but his faith and persistent questions brought her back. An Indian Brahmin who worked for the family, after many talks with Carlo about Christianity, asked to be baptised and was followed by his friend and his friend’s mother. Perhaps he was sent to our modern world to help rebuild God’s church, as his favourite Saint, Francis of Assisi, did. It’s true our Church is crumbling, as people turn elsewhere to football or celebrity worship. Eg, next week, the Taylor Swift Juggernaut comes to the UK for a series of sell-out concerts which will make millions. Many of her songs are autobiographical, dealing with her break-ups, which her legion of Swifties will enjoy, but will they be inspired by those songs to do something great with their lives? One day, as musical tastes change, Swifty will swiftly be gone. When she has, will fans just follow the crowd onto the next big thing? Carlo used to say, “We’re all born originals, but many of us die as photocopies”.\n\nCarlo, however, will be forever inspirational, because he is now a saint, someone for all of us, especially young people, to look up to. By using his computer skills, while remaining an ordinary teenager, who loved fashion, gaming and Italian car design, to bring others back to Jesus in the Eucharist, he joins other young saints like Bernadette, Dominic Savio and, more recently, Akash Bashir, a young Pakistani, killed while preventing a suicide bomber entering his parish church. May all these young saints inspire us to a deeper love for Our Lord in the Blessed Sacrament.\n\n26.05.24 ~ TRINITY SUNDAY\n\n(To hear audio file ~ click here)\n\nBefore every exam at College, we used to write AMDG (For the greater glory of God), then start with the sign of the cross. When you see so many footballers making the sign of the cross, is it fanciful to think that many of them, especially the Catholics, are giving glory to God for their talent? In his fight with Tyson Fury, Oleksander Usek did it before each round. Catholics are recognisable by the sign of the cross, and like so many of our signs and symbols in the Church, it is a profession of faith. It shows to anyone watching that we believe in the Blessed Trinity, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, the fundamental mystery of the Christian faith, which underpins everything we believe and do\n\nThe mystery of there being three persons in one God, has exercised the minds of many great thinkers throughout history, but no-one has solved it, precisely because it is a mystery. Even an intellectual giant like St Augustine had to admit defeat, after a dream he had of a young boy trying to empty the sea into a hole on the beach. He told the boy what he was trying to do was impossible. The boy replied that so was what he was trying to do in solving the mystery of the Trinity. So, the conclusion reached by most spiritual writers, is that the mystery of the Trinity is understood more easily with the heart than the mind. The Trinity is Pure Love. The Father is the Lover, the Son is the Loved, and the Spirit is the Personification of the love between them.\n\nThere have been lots of good ideas over the years to help us understand the life of the Trinity, and how it is possible to be three in one: St Patrick’s use of three distinct leaves which nevertheless form only one shamrock. St Cyril of Alexandria’s use of only one sun but with light and heat, each distinct with their own roles to play. St John Damascene’s spring, river and sea, three distinct roles but all the one nature of water. He also has root, branch and fruit, but all forming the substance of only one tree.\n\nHowever, all these descriptions, although helpful to us, don’t really solve the mystery.\n\nThe only reason we know there are three persons in one God, is because Jesus told us. In doing so, he was building on what had gradually been revealed of the nature of God in the Hebrew Scriptures over 2000 years. In the first reading the Chosen people are about to enter the Promised Land where they will be surrounded by many exotic, colourful and tempting religions, based on idol worship. So, Moses makes it very clear to them that they should never forget there is only one God. “Understand this today and take it to heart: the Lord is God indeed, in heaven above as on earth below, he and no other”. They accept what Moses says but, over the centuries, realise that, although God is only, he is never lonely, because he is in constant dialogue with them, through his word and the signs he gives.\n\nJesus completes the revelation, when he unveils himself as the Son of God and gives us the Holy Spirit, which sets up our personal relationship with God the Father. As St Paul says, “Everyone moved by the Spirit is a son of God, so we are God’s heirs and coheirs with Christ”. Our God is not cold or distant, or a riddle to be solved, but is the love which beats in the very heart of all of us and needs to be recognised in each person we meet. As we’ve seen from the examples above, the three persons of the Trinity do not act separately, but it can be helpful to our prayer life, if we think of the Father as Provider, who created us out of love, keeps us in being, and wants us to know him, love him and serve him in this world, so as to be happy with him for ever in the next: the Son as Saviour, who lived, died and rose again, to make that possible: the Holy Spirit as Comforter and Sanctifier, who gives us the strength and guidance to face the challenges of life, remembering Jesus’ last words to the apostles in today’s gospel, “And know I am with you always; yes till the end of time”..\n\nWith that power, may we try to live for the greater honour and glory of God, the salvation of souls, and our own personal sanctification, and may the grace of Our Lord Jeus Christ, the love of God the Father and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with us all now and forever. Amen.\n\n19.05.24 ~ PENTECOST SUNDAY\n\n(To hear audio file ~ click here)\n\nWater is very much in the news at the moment. You’re not allowed to swim in the Thames in case you catch a disease. Lake Windermere has had 3000 tons of raw sewage accidently pumped into it. Devon’s water supply is contaminated. Blackpool’s might be too. In many other parts of the world there is drought. Mexico City, which was built surrounded by water, has now almost dried up. If only we could ship them some of ours – we’re never short of rain in Fleetwood!\n\nWater is essential. Without it there can be no life. So, it’s no surprise that the action of God’s life-giving Spirit, is often represented by the image of rain, which, as the prophet Isaiah says, never returns to heaven, without first watering the earth, and causing everything it touches to grow. Every single blade of grass, every plant or tree, with its distinct life form, is enabled to grow and flourish by the outpouring of water, and each of them has something unique to offer to the eco system of our common home. In the same way the grace of the Holy Spirit is poured out on each of us individually, so that we may grow, flourish and, through the use of our unique talents, contribute to the building up of the Body of Christ, and the spread of the gospel, which is what this great feast is all about.\n\nBefore his ascension Jesus bequeathed us two things, a promise and a request. His promise was that to all who follow him he would give the gift of eternal life. His request was that we should “go out to the whole world and proclaim the good news to all creation”. While the promise is very comforting, the carrying out of his request can seem very daunting. But is it? At Pentecost, the Holy Spirit turned a group of hesitant, frightened disciples, into fearless missionaries who spoke that day to thousands of foreigners, as well as to people they lived and worked with and saw every day. When persecution started in Jerusalem, far from being cowed or discouraged, they set off to evangelise in other regions, relying solely on the power of Christ’s spirit within them.\n\nApart from the power of their preaching, what really impressed people, was they set up teams to deal with orphans, widows, the poor and those who had nothing. They were living proof of faith and good works working together. So, from the earliest days of the Church we learn that there are many ways of proclaiming the good news. Not everybody can get up on a soapbox and preach, as the Apostles did, but none of us should ever be afraid to proclaim our faith. It’s equally important for people to see how well we look after each other, and what we contribute to the common good. As Jesus says, “It is to the glory of my Father that you should bear much fruit, and then you will be my disciples”.\n\nOur Church is changing, as it has had to do many times over the centuries, but the mission remains the same. The most obvious change, as we have now come to experience here in Fleetwood, is the lack of priests. Clearly, the Holy Spirit is doing a new thing, bringing to the fore the Lay Apostolate, and taking us down the route of collaborative ministry, which means priest and people working together as equal partners, each one of us using the gifts and talents we have been blessed with, to proclaim the faith and keep it alive. As a living cell of the Body of Christ, each of us must know what spiritual, physical, natural gifts or acquired skills we have to offer to the Common Good, then put them into action, either here in the parish or out in the community. There are as many ways to exercise our baptismal commitment as there are people; you can be a hospital visitor, Foodbank volunteer, help slow readers at school, drive someone to Mass, run an Alpha course or prayer group, foster a child, support unchurched parents seeking baptism, be a welcoming face to visitors. If we all chip in together, we will become like a well-oiled machine, producing much fruit for the glory of our Father. Let us ask the Holy Spirit to fan into a flame the kind of Christian action which proclaims the good news, that Jesus is still very much alive and has much to offer to our self-indulgent world. As Paul says, “What the Spirit brings is very different: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, trustfulness, gentleness and self-control. Since the Spirit is our life, let us be directed by the Spirit”.\n\n12.05.24 ~ 7th SUNDAY OF EASTER\n\n(To hear audio file ~ click here)\n\nToday most Catholics are aware of the image of the Divine Mercy with rays of light coming from Jesus’ outstretched hands. Back in the 80s not so. A priest friend of mine was shown a holy picture of it, and the lady asked him which saint it was. He hadn’t a clue, so he said, “Oh, That’s St Lazer”. His bluff reminded me of our Maundy Thursday washing of the feet this year. George could only get 11 instead of the normal 12. One of my friends watching on live stream thought it was very clever of us to leave Judas’ chair empty signifying he had already gone out. I must confess I was tempted to accept his compliments, but I knew that if he read St John’s account he’d be able to call my bluff.\n\nWhat actually happened was that after the Ascension, the eleven remaining apostles, with a good number of disciples, went back to the upper room to pray, as they awaited the gift of the Holy Spirit, which Jesus had promised. As they prayed it became clear that they needed to replace Judas. They needed to be twelve again. Twelve was a mystical number in Hebrew history. There had been twelve tribes of Israel. Now, there were to be twelve foundation stones for the Church. Twelve, like three or seven, denoted perfection. It denoted strength and unity.\n\nAll of us probably know the ancient story of the Carthaginian general whose men were terrified of going into battle against the all-conquering, all-powerful Romans. He simply took a bundle of sticks and asked a soldier to break them. The soldier couldn’t. The general untied the sticks and gave them to the soldier one by one, and they broke easily. He taught his men that as individuals they were indeed weak, but that together they were strong and would not break so easily. The apostles, then, needed to be complete as a body for the beginning of their mission, and that’s why Christ prayed at the last supper, “Holy Father, keep them in my name, that they may be one as we are one”. The apostles’ strength was to lie in their unity based on Christ. Christ must be the centre of unity for our world too.\n\nIn recent years, there have been lots of behavioural studies done on humans. Perhaps the most famous was “The Naked Ape”, by Desmond Morris. Some of them don’t show us in too good a light. We war and fight like wild animals. The truth is that, at any given moment, somewhere in the world, human beings are trying to kill other human beings. We consider ourselves a civilised country, but even here our children roam the streets, like feral cats, angry and spoiling for a fight, or to inflict damage on people or property. It’s not so long ago that the Police offered an amnesty to people if they handed in their knives, and now they are offering another one, in the light of a number of stabbings, not to mention a yoUng man in Liverpool having a hatchet buried in his head, simply because he was the “wrong” colour.\n\nPeople are saying that there is a moral vacuum in society today. There is grave danger of disintegration into relativism, where anything goes. We believe, and anybody with any sense can see, that the Gospel is the answer. The Christian way of life can and does fill that vacuum, with the inspiration to live with one another in unity and love. By ourselves we are not capable of freeing ourselves from our aggressive characteristics. We need to go outside ourselves to find release. Today’s gospel shows us how that release comes by unifying ourselves with Christ, whose human nature, allied to his divine nature, is perfection itself.\n\nA few weeks ago, Christ used the metaphor of himself as the Vine, and us as the branches. Like the Carthaginian General’s sticks, we are weak and unproductive on our own, but grafted onto Christ, and living with his strength within us, then we have immense strength and power to take the battle for goodness to our streets.\n\n05.05.24 ~ 6th SUNDAY OF EASTER\n\n(To hear audio file ~ click here)\n\nOver the last couple of Sundays, we have had Our Lord revealing to his disciples the mystery of their union with him. I am the Good Shepherd, you are the sheep. I am the vine, you are the branches. And today, he reminds us that we didn’t choose him: he chose us. So, it’s very clear to see who’s in control. There are two ways of looking at control; one evokes the image of power, being in command, dictating the play. In a war situation, if you want to beat the enemy, the first thing to do, is destroy their command-and-control structure. Without it there can be no co-ordination, which causes chaos, especially among isolated Units. The other way to see control, is as a benign force for good, such as crowd control at huge public events, to keep people safe. It’s the benign sort we are looking at today. Although Our Lord is exercising control, by giving us a commandment, it’s very much for our good.\n\nThe other day, a Sociologist was talking about the huge rise in mental health problems, especially amongst the young, often caused through feelings of loneliness, made even worse because of Covid, when they were in isolation for such a long time, relying on virtual friends via the internet, in place of physical interaction with their real friends. Her solution was to supply millions of pounds to fund psychiatric help. Coincidentally, on the same day, I read an article by a bishop, who suggested that a solution to so many of our contemporary problems, would be to bring God back into public life, and, at Bible share the other night, we felt the same. The problem with that idea, I suspect, is that most of our contemporaries, who may never have read the Bible, have a preconceived, fixed idea of God as being irrelevant to real life. And yet, if they were to read the gospels, with an open mind, they would see just how relevant they are, in dealing with most of the problems we human beings face. That, apparently, is what has just happened to Russell Brand, who got baptised last Sunday, then told his millions of fans, how it has delivered the tranquillity and peace he has been looking for all his life.\n\nHow many more lost souls are looking for tranquillity and peace, and how do they know where to get it? Russell Brand’s wife is Catholic, so perhaps it was her example that did the trick. Who knows? We’re Catholics. So, in a world crying out for purpose and meaning, we need to be talking up our faith, at every opportunity. As St Paul says in his letter to the Romans, \"How can they call on him to save them unless they believe in him? And how can they believe in him if they have never heard about him? And how can they hear about him unless someone tells them? So, tell them. Encourage your friends and acquaintances to give the gospel a try; maybe even invite them to come to Mass with you, to hear God’s word and mix with lots of people who clearly do treasure the faith, as a source of peace and tranquillity, especially when it comes to bereavement, serious illness or depression. Because faith underpins everything we do, it helps us to see things sub specie aeternitatis, in the light of eternity. So, get the good news out there. Talk openly and fearlessly about our faith. You may save someone’s life.\n\nAnd what about the lapsed? I once attended a talk where the keynote speaker said that the biggest cause of lapsation is ‘material cholesterol’. Consumerism so clogs up the arteries of grace, that the Christian perspective on morals, sex, justice, money and just about everything else is lost and, without it, they leave the Church. Objective morality is either forgotten or overruled, in favour of individual choice. People like to be in control of their own lives.\n\nTo us who have the faith, it’s pretty obvious that to give Jesus control of our lives, doesn’t mean that we will be spared contemporary problems, but it does mean we have the tools to deal with them, the greatest of which is today’s commandment: “Love one another as I have loved you”. A child learns love by being loved, and to be deprived of love can be devastating, as we have seen in recent cases of children fatally abused by their parents. For a child to be loved is the best feeling in the world, and it’s the same for God’s children. St John says, ‘The love I’m talking about is not our love for God, but God’s love for us. We have been loved into existence by our Father and nourished by the love of his Son. Because we have been loved first, we learn to love others, whoever they are. By sharing our faith and telling of his never-ending love for them, we can help to bring some of our Father’s estranged children safely home to him. We can also give them the key to finding tranquillity and peace.\n\n28.04.24 ~ 5th SUNDAY OF EASTER\n\n(To hear audio file ~ click here)\n\nIn my first parish, we were four priests. At the Good Friday Liturgy, when it was time for Holy communion, the key of the Lady Chapel tabernacle broke in the lock and none of us could open it. The church was packed, everyone wondering what we were going to do next, as were we, by the way. Then, quite unexpectedly a man, unknown to any of us, slipped into the chapel and reappeared seconds later having opened it. As we were close to the prison, we wondered if he may have been a recently released safe-cracker! It's not unusual for God to use unusual suspects to sort his Church out\n\nOne of his most surprising chosen instruments was Saul, later known as Paul. Today, we see him trying to join the apostles, but they can’t believe he really is a disciple, and are afraid of him, with good reason. The last time he was in Jerusalem, he was part of the gang who had stoned Stephen to death, then had left, breathing fire and threatening to annihilate any Christians he could find. But, thanks to Barnabas, they accepted that Paul had changed, and were able to see it for themselves, by the way he started to go round with them in Jerusalem, preaching fearlessly in the name of Jesus.\n\nAlthough Paul’s conversion was pretty spectacular, his subsequent missionary life was not all plain sailing. He was constantly reminded by Jesus that, in spite of his amazing achievements, like all of us, he was merely a vine branch which needed to be pruned regularly in order to bear much fruit.\n\nWhen Jesus used the image of the vine, with the need for regular pruning, he was very conscious that it had been used before, deep in the history of Israel, to express God's displeasure with their ingratitude and their failure to blossom as his people: \"I came looking for grapes, but you produced only sour grapes that set the children's teeth on edge\". In spite of their constant unfaithfulness, Isaiah prophesied that, no matter how long it took, a new and magnificent true vine would eventually be produced, and would yield good fruit. He was right. After centuries of pruning, by punishment and exile, the time is ripe to receive the fulness of God’s revelation in the person of Jesus, the Messiah. But, they refuse, as he knew they would. He predicted it in the parable of the vineyard, where, not content with killing the owner’s messengers, the tenants also kill his son. They prefer to cling to the Law, under which they felt safe, rather than live in the freedom of the Spirit, which the gospel offers.\n\nIn contrast to the Authority’s refusal to believe, the apostles accept him for who he is, the Christ, the Son of the living God. They get it. That’s why he says, “You are pruned already, by means of the word I have spoken to you”. The mission he gives them is to live by the law of love, love their enemies, wash unworthy people’s feet, cleanse the sores of lepers, provide for widows and orphans, serve, not be served, all of which they accomplished. But, however much they achieved, they weren’t perfect, so needed pruning from time to time. In Paul’s case, pruning meant a lot of beatings and physical suffering, but for most of us it simply means making a good, humble, sincere confession, designed to deal with our weaknesses or the sins we commit, which stunt our spiritual growth. This can be a painful process, but it works, because God’s grace can then flow freely through Christ the vine, to renew the life of our inner spirit and enable us to produce the fruit of good works.\n\nThe lovely thing about this image is that it’s organic. We are not stuck onto the vine or tied to it by rope: we are grafted on, we are part of it, we are absorbed by it. Isn’t it a lovely feeling to know that, at our baptism we were grafted onto Christ, so that the spirit which flowed through him and animated his ministry, is the same spirit, or grace, by which we live and move and have our being. The key phrase of today’s gospel for me is “Make your home in me as I make mine in you”. By these words, Our Lord is saying, “Don’t be just my acquaintance, my friend, my servant. Live in me, share my life, drink, whenever you can, the water of eternal life, from the fountain of my word and sacraments. Make room for me in your heart, so that the life I share with my Father I will also share with you”.\n\n21.04.24 ~ 4th SUNDAY OF EASTER\n\n(To hear audio file ~ click here)\n\nPASTORAL LETTER FOR THE FOURTH SUNDAY OF EASTERTIDE ~ GOOD SHEPHERD SUNDAY 2024\n\nAPPOINTED TO BE READ AT ALL PUBLIC MASSES IN ALL CHURCHES AND CHAPELS\n\nIN THE DIOCESE OF LANCASTER ON THE WEEKEND OF 21st April 2024\n\nMy dear people,\n\nFollowing the tradition established by my predecessors, I write this Pastoral Letter to you on the theme of Christ, the Good Shepherd, model for the pastoral ministry of priests. Genesis tells us that each of us is made in the image and likeness of God. Jesus tells us that each of us must try our best to live lives after the example He has given us. Remember, Jesus would never ask us to do something He knows we are incapable of. In fact, He continually puts within our reach and ability what we are tempted to give up on ever achieving: Holiness of life,\n\nforgiveness, peace, healing and reconciliation, life without grief and sadness, life restored. All these are possible through and with Jesus who has risen from the grave.\n\nIt crossed my mind that Jesus may have chosen the image of the Good Shepherd because He knew well His disciples’ habit of ‘woolly thinking’, meaning a way of thinking that doesn’t amount to much and doesn’t give what is needed. Or maybe it is our ‘woolly prayers’, so often lacking heart, focus and conviction. Contrast all this with the bold, clear statements we find in today’s Gospel,\n\n‘I know my own and my own know me’,\n\n‘I know the Father’,\n\n‘The Good Shepherd lays down His life for His sheep’,\n\n‘I lay down my life in order to take it up again. No one takes it from me’.\n\nHere is a boldness and firmness of intent that lifts the heart of the listener and inspires confidence. It is with the same firmness of intent that Our Lord chose men to serve as priests in the Church, not as any kind of super-privileged class, but as a means of guaranteeing that the Church would truly be the Mystical Body of Christ, able to live the life of Christ throughout time. He wanted it this way.\n\nLet us pray for those clergy who have died recently, and I call to mind Father John Heaney and Father Tom Forster. I give thanks for the faithfulness of those who celebrate significant anniversaries this year, remembering especially Mgr Frank Slattery, celebrating his seventieth jubilee, a remarkable achievement. I pray for Deacon Simon Marley, due to be ordained priest for the Diocese in the autumn, and please pray for Stephen Bamber and Christopher Sumner, in formation for the priesthood in Rome.\n\nI am grateful for all the priests serving in the Diocese (and some beyond our boundaries), with deep gratitude for those who have come to us from far afield. At the same time, I ask for prayers for vocations from amongst our local men. As we see our numbers decline it does not seem right that we constantly draw in clergy from abroad, where they are needed even more than here. But it seems to me that I have no right to ask for more priestly vocations if I am not looking after those priests I already have.\n\nUndoubtedly, as the years carry us forward, we will continue to see our parishes change, and the number of Masses will reduce, at least for the time-being. We may have to travel a little further for Mass or wait a little longer for Mass to be available in our local church. May we resist living our faith out of what is convenient for us. Hardships and inconveniences invite us to make personal acts of love as gestures of gratitude and confidence in our loving Shepherd.\n\n‘I know my own, and my own know me.’ These words can bring us comfort and reassurance even in what can rightly be called a global trauma. Jesus rose and retained the scars of the crucifixion. If together we are the Body of Christ, it is the vocation of some to be the wounds of Christ, and we can see that blood is still weeping from those wounds even though the Lord is risen indeed. The Good Shepherd knows this and will tend those wounds with outstanding love and gentleness. We have His word. The art of the pastoral ministry is to tend those wounds with the care and gentleness of Christ. May the Lord ensure that we always have priests able to serve in this way. May our Catholic schools create a culture within which our young people will hear God’s call and choose to follow Him as priests, deacons, religious and consecrated single people, as well as in holy matrimony.\n\nWith my blessing for you and your families,\n\n+Rt Rev Paul Swarbrick\n\nBishop of Lancaster\n\n07.04.24 ~ 2nd SUNDAY OF EASTER\n\n(To hear audio file ~ click here)\n\nAt the Easter Vigil last week, we had the great joy of welcoming Holly and Simon into the Catholic Faith. An adult who converts to Catholicism naturally approaches it differently from someone born into it. Everyone’s journey in faith is different and personal. For some, it begins with questioning life’s meaning, for others it’s the search for certainty to anchor their life to. Very often it comes from mixing with cradle Catholics for whom the faith is as natural as eating and drinking, whose very sense of belonging, being part of a family, is an inspiration to those who feel they have no spiritual home. Simon has written a beautiful view from the pew, which encapsulates much of what I have just said.\n\nBut, however we receive the Faith, it is neither a birthright nor something we can earn by intellectual effort. It’s a free gift from God, for anyone and everyone, who would like to receive it. But it’s a gift which has to be opened, and acted upon, in the way today’s scriptures spell out: love God, love our neighbour. It's pretty easy to work out how to love our neighbour in a practical way, but what about God? St John says, “Loving God is keeping his commandments” one of which, ‘Thou shalt not kill,’ calls for all Christians, especially with what’s going on in the world, to be proud to proclaim their gospel faith, as a better way than conflict, for making the world a safer and more peaceful place”.\n\nBeing proud to proclaim our faith in public, has a lot to offer, because it knows how to cope with the problems of life, in a world which seems to have no cohesive strategy for the common good of all, resulting in excessive nationalism or individualism. I had a funeral at St Mary’s this week of a man I didn’t know, but his sister told me a little about him, the most striking being, that he was proud of his Catholic Faith. I said how refreshing it was to hear that, in contrast to what you hear from so many people in the media, for example who say “I was brought up Catholic but no longer practice”, as if it were a badge of honour, to make them more acceptable to a non-religious and secular audience.\n\nMany people who reject the gospel trawl the internet, or social media, in pursuit of anything that may bring happiness, or self-worth, by the number of ‘likes’ they can notch up. But it’s not working! Last Monday the NHS revealed that in 2022-23, 86 million anti-depressants were prescribed by GPs. Some will have been genuine cases of clinical depression, but I suspect most were just going through a bad time, which is part of life, not a mental health issue. Scotland now has a ‘Hate Crime’ law. Hatred is seen in thousands of innocent men, women and children being blasted to smithereens in Palestine and Ukraine. Saying nasty things about people because they have a different point of view is hardly hatred.\n\nThe two essential fruits of the resurrection, are missionary witness and the sharing of material goods, as showcased in the first reading from Acts, where the whole group of believers was united, heart and soul. We know that through our faith we become children of God with a child’s natural love for the heavenly Father ‘who begot us’ as St John puts it. So, it makes sense that Jesus’ first commandment is to love God, then secondly our neighbour. When we love in that order, it’s like a beam of light striking one of those dance hall revolving mirrors, which diffuse light all over the place. We, like millions of our fellow Christians, want our love for God to be reflected in the good we do, in all directions, on all kinds of people, as an antidote to the destructive power of evil, so prevalent in our world today.\n\nBut to do this well and consistently, we need the inspiration of the Holy Spirit and absolute trust in the Lord who, unlike Thomas, we can’t see, but believe in. Thomas didn’t trust his friends when they told him Jesus was alive, nor did he trust Jesus. He had to learn that a true loving relationship with God, does not have to be subject to proof and scrutiny. Like Thomas, many people want to understand before they believe, whereas it should be the other way round. Only when we accept that Jesus is truly alive and with us always, do we discover our faith deepening and maturing, as our reason begins to sift the evidence of the first eyewitnesses. Our relationship with Christ is like any human friendship. It grows and develops over the years through both the joys and sorrows we share, precisely because it’s based on faith and trust. Faith in what we can’t see is an everyday part of life’s experience, and so is faith in God. As it says in the Rite of Baptism, “This is our faith: we are proud to profess it”.\n\n30.03.24 ~ EASTER VIGIL\n\n(To hear audio file ~ click here)\n\nI imagine that most of us, from time to time, will have met an atheist, who will proclaim the victory of science over religion, as the only answer to life’s questions, but, for those of us who have faith, life’s questions must be answered in two ways. Science can tell us ‘How’ but only religion can tell us ‘Why’ So, for us, there is no conflict between science and religion. In fact, many of the greatest scientists the world has ever known have been believers. For example, a Catholic priest called Fr Georges Lemaitre. In 1927, in a paper to the Scientific Society of Brussels, he presented the idea of an expanding universe, which has expanded from an initial point, which he called the ‘Primeval Atom’. Over the years, his idea has dominated modern cosmology, as the most important scientific theory, of the origin and development of the universe. In 1949, it became known by scientists as the ‘Big Bang’.\n\nI was reminded of this when reading an article by Martin Bennett, who writes, “To sit and listen to all the readings at the Easter Vigil is to be taken from the dawn of time, and to have an overview of many thousands of years of history, which, with the benefit of hindsight, allows us to see how God has always been with us. From the ‘Big Bang’, which Christians think of as his first explosion of love, through which he created all the universes, God always wanted us to be like him, so he made us in his own image and likeness”. It’s a wonderful story.\n\nUnfortunately, however, we see in the Old Testament Readings, that we have often failed to live up to his likeness, and yet God never fails to call us back. He doesn’t want to lose us. At first, he sent his people messengers, to appeal to their sense of loyalty to him, who, at the Passover, had freed them from slavery. But his prophets were rejected. People didn’t like the idea of being beholden to a God whom they saw as remote, not one of them, unaffected by the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. That’s why he decided to send his only Son into the world so that, through him, he could be with us in a different, more personal relationship. This, Jesus attempted to teach, throughout his public ministry, referring often to us as his brothers and sisters, children of the one he taught us to call ‘Our Father’. As we know from Good Friday, this message was not accepted by the Powers that be, and in fact led to his death for blasphemy – they raged at the very idea of the claim that he and the Father are one. He failed to move them from their entrenched position, that when it came to God, they knew best, and so suffered the same fate as the Prophets. Even the apostles, apart from John, lost faith in him that day.\n\nOnly after the resurrection did things change. I’m reading a book, at the moment, called ‘Strangers in the House’. It’s about soldiers and other servicemen coming home after WWII, sometimes after five /six years away, and the profound effect their homecoming had on the wives, children and families they had left behind, as well as on themselves. For many hundreds of them, although safe and free from the horrors they had been through, it meant a new way of living from what they had known before. For some it renewed and intensified their love, for others it led to the parting of the ways.\n\nToday is the feast of Jesus’ homecoming after the horrors of Good Friday, to Galilee where they first began, where they had their most success, where they were most comfortable, and where they felt safe. His friends reacted in different ways, some with incredulity, fearing he was a ghost: others, like Mary Magdalen, consumed with unbridled love, wanting to cling to him for ever. However, they all knew that things were now different, and changes would have to be made to their way of living with him. From now on, he would always be with them, but spiritually. He was aware that many followers would want to cling on to the security of the Law, simply following the commandments and avoiding controversy. But he also knew many more would welcome his call to an intimate, living relationship with him. His masterplan was to pour out his Spirit on anyone and everyone who opens their heart to receive his word. He promised that if they did he would live in them. The Risen Christ, still bearing the wounds of the Passion, is the same Jesus they knew before, alive again, continuing where he left off, asking each of us to join him, in helping others to bring about a real, tangible love for God, whose son did indeed know the same slings and arrows of outrageous fortune as we do, was not remote, and definitely was one of us, in all things but sin.\n\n28.03.24 ~ MASS OF THE LAST SUPPER ~ MAUNDY THURSDAY\n\nOn the news this morning, it said that, because of his illness, King Charles will not be able to attend today’s church service during which Maundy money is distributed to 75 couples, one for each year of his age. However, he has sent a message to be read, the theme of which is friendship, in which he renews his coronation oath, to serve and not to be served, the same commitment that we priests of the Diocese made this morning, at the Chrism Mass.\n\nThe word Maundy comes from the Latin ‘mandatum’ which means command, and is directly connected to our Lord’s new Commandment to ‘Love one another as I have loved you’. So, the Maundy money in days long ago, would be real money given to real poor people, by kings and queens emerging from their palaces in response to that command, echoing the thoughts of the Apostles at the Last Supper, who presumed that was what Judas was leaving the meal to do. He would, of course, have missed what came later, the washing of the feet.\n\nNowadays, the Maundy money is largely ceremonial and is used to honour worthy citizens from the relevant Cathedral City’s population. Had the king been well enough to attend to distribute the money, it is highly unlikely, even though he has pledged to serve, not to be served, that he would have gone on to imitate Jesus by offering to wash people’s feet.\n\nWhen Jesus left the table to set about washing the apostles’ feet, no doubt they were surprised or even shocked, but as they were accustomed to seeing him do unusual things, like touching a leper, talking to a Samaritan woman unaccompanied, delaying his response to Martha and Mary’s plea to come to save their brother, they probably just went along with it. But not Peter! He spoke out, maybe with the silent approval some of the others too. “You, the Lord and Master! You’re not washing my feet. That’s the job of the lowest slave”.\n\nBut that’s precisely why Jesus took it on. Remember he had just ordained them priests, and given them the same power to heal and forgive sins as he had, powers they had seen him use many times. Perhaps as they were finishing their meal, their thoughts could have strayed to the time when they would be allowed to use those powers, and how wonderful people would think they were – maybe, even, how important they were. Time for a lesson in humility!\n\nJesus washing their feet was a hard lesson for them to learn, but essential. ”The Son of Man came to serve, not to be served” and they must do the same. Thankfully, it was a lesson well learnt, and in time, they did indeed go on to do for others what he had done for them, something the Church continues to do today. Thankfully, we are still the people of the water and the towel, something we should be justifiably proud of in spite of the institutional faults and failings of the Church in recent years.\n\nApart from being given the power to forgive sins, and receive forgiveness, which 40 odd people benefitted from, who took advantage of the Penitential Service last night, he also gave them the power to celebrate the Eucharist, in memory of him, and to make him present to all peoples of all times, until the very end of time.\n\nAll these blessing which we enjoy, came at a terrible price for Jesus, which began not long after this last meal they shared together. Later tonight, at the altar of repose, there will be time to spend with Jesus, as if we were in the Garden of Gethsemane, before his arrest, a time so filled with anxiety and fear, that in his agony, he burst minor blood vessels, mingling droplets of blood with his sweat. May this most holy night of celebration and sadness, always keep us mindful of Christ’s saving work, so that we will never forget what he has done for us and be ever grateful.\n\n24.03.24 ~ PALM SUNDAY\n\n(To hear audio file ~click here)\n\nAs we keep getting reminded, this is a year of elections in many countries. Russia’s has just finished: the USA’s and our own are to follow in the Autumn, most of the Candidates committed to a populist agenda, designed simply to get them elected, or keep them in power, but devoid of any real principles. However, I have a feeling, that thinking people are beginning to wise up, and to discern the difference between content and substance. An example would be the huge number who defied the Kremlin, and came to place flowers on Alexei Navalny’s grave, or poured paint into the ballot boxes, in protest against the rigged election; a demonstration by ordinary folk of what they really want.\n\nIn some ways, that was what was happening on Palm Sunday, when the ordinary folk welcomed Jesus into Jerusalem, strewing palms before him, and shouting Hosannas to the Son of David, in defiance of their rulers. Unfortunately, it didn’t last – the Establishment was just too strong. They didn’t have the military might to put such an insurrection down, as happens in so many dictatorships today, but they were able to manipulate the crowd on the strength of their superior religious knowledge and authority. “This rabble knows nothing about the Law – they are damned.” Even when one of their own number, Nicodemus, suggested that the Law does not allow judgement to be passed on a man, without giving him a hearing” they turned on him. “Are you a Galilean too? Prophets do not come from Galilee”. So, it was decided, rather like what happens in Russia today, that any hint of opposition must be crushed.\n\nWhile all their plotting was taking place during the week, what do you think was going on in Jesus’ mind, knowing full well how painfully this was going to end? For an answer to that we need to look at the Song of the Suffering Servant in the first reading, which highlights the constancy of his hope in God. It is so strong that he is prepared to go through anything, trusting that in the end all will be well. “I offered my back to those who struck me, my cheeks to those who tore at my beard, I did not cover my face against insult and spittle, but the Lord comes to my help, so that I am untouched by the insults”. When I was taking the children around the stations of the cross on Thursday, I explained to them how narrow the streets of the Via Crucis are, which meant that, as Jesus stumbled along through the crowd, he was in easy range of those who did want to spit at him, slap or punch him. So, he would definitely have had to set his face like flint, so as not to give them the satisfaction of seeing him react or retaliate, an unusual response, but very much in keeping with his teaching to love our enemies. Perhaps seeing, from so close a vantage point, how Jesus dealt with such hatred, may be the reason Simon of Cyrene later became one of his disciples.\n\nAlthough to the Jews, Jesus was a blasphemer and law-breaker, in St Paul’s letter to the Philippians, we get a reminder of just who it is we are talking about here. When we realise that, we may wonder why he didn’t simply manifest his power there and then, to avoid the fate of the Suffering Servant. But what’s clear in Paul’s hymn, is that Jesus is not some sort of fantasy Superhero. Yes, his state was divine, but he did not cling to his equality with God in order to impress, cajole or scare people into loving him. He had no desire to become a Northern Korea style ‘Beloved Leader’ lording it over his people, forcing them to submit to his will on pain of death. Instead, he assumed the condition of a slave, a state in life unlikely to lead to him having a mass following.\n\nAt the presentation in the temple, Simeon had foretold that Jesus would be a sign of contradiction, and in assuming the condition of a slave he certainly was. He turned the whole human way of interaction upside down, serving rather than being served, seeking the common good rather than our own glory. We live in a world of excessive consumerism where, as the Bible puts it “People have exchanged the glory of the living God for the image of a bull that eats grass”. Being a humble servant, he does not try to impose himself on us as a popularist but seeks out those who have e"
