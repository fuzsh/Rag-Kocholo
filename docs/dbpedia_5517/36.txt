History: Erected for Hawaii, 1941, the Diocese of Honolulu succeeded the Prefecture-Apostolic for the Hawaiian/ Sandwich Islands, 1826-1844, and the Vicariate-Apostolate for the Hawaiian Islands, 1844-1941, both of which were under the leadership of the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary. Since the 1840s, some Catholic Native Americans have resided in the Honolulu area resulting from employment in the fishing industry and service in the U.S. Armed Forces. In 1999, it was estimated that 500 baptized Native American Catholics resided in the Honolulu Diocese.
