With him we work to foster liturgical prayer that nourishes and intensifies the spiritual life of the People of God.\n\nThe Office of Worship instructs and assists clergy and parish liturgical ministers in the work of guiding the People of God in their celebration of the liturgy and the sacraments.\n\nThe Office of Worship provides parishes with workshops, consultation, resources and guidelines to assist them in providing liturgical services that will be in keeping with the liturgical norms of the Church and enrich the faith life of parishioners. The Office provides these services to the deacon formation program and also coordinates Episcopal functions.\n\nStaff\n\nReverend Alfred Omar B.

In addition to the commission on the liturgy, every diocese, as far as possible, should have commissions for music and art. These three commissions must work in close collaboration; indeed it will often be best to fuse the three into one single commission.\" Sacrosanctum Concilium- Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy, #45 and 46.\n\nThe office is advised by the Diocesan Liturgical Commission, a twelve member group that provides parishes and schools with workshops and does on-site education for parishes building or renewing their worship space. The Diocesan Liturgical Commission also serves in an advisory capacity to the bishop regarding liturgical matters."
