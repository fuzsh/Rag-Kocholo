        "text": "List of Accused Priests in Hawaii\n\nClergy sexual abuse in Hawaii spans back as far as the 1980s, with as many as 70 alleged abuse cases filed against the Honolulu Diocese alone. Updates to laws and expanded civil suit options have led to more Hawaii survivors coming forward with numerous accusations of clergy misconduct and priests sexually abusing them when they were minors.\n\nRosenfeld Injury Lawyers is committed to serving the victims of Hawaii, whether theyâ€™re ready to come forward and report sexual abuse in the Catholic Church or file a lawsuit against their abusers.\n\nAbout Clergy Sexual Abuse\n\nClergy sexual abuse occurs when a priest or clergy member misuses their power or influence to sexually abuse or exploit a child or vulnerable adult. Many clergy sexual abuse reports also claim that the Catholic Church diocese knew of the abuse occurring but did nothing to stop it or, in some cases, even attempted to cover it up.\n\nReporting clergy abuse is important to influence change in the Catholic Church. Sexually abused children and adults in the Catholic Dioceses are left with feelings of mistrust, anger, and resentment for many decades. While a new civil suit against credibly accused clergy may not take away the pain and suffering, it can provide justice and help prevent the same wrongdoing from continuing.\n\nLegal Support for Survivors in Hawaii\n\nBoth criminal and civil charges may be available in clergy sexual abuse cases. Rosenfeld Injury Lawyers represents victims and families of child sexual abuse in the church. Our legal team has the expertise and experience necessary when handling sensitive cases involving Hawaii religious organizations accused of abuse.\n\nLaws and Regulations in Hawaii\n\nSexually assaulting a person is illegal in Hawaii. Being convicted of sexual assault can lead to civil and criminal charges.\n\nHawaii child sex abuse victims have until their 26th birthday to file a civil lawsuit against an abuser. A three-year statute of limitation is also available to survivors, which starts on the date of discovery of a sexual abuse-related injury.\n\nIn some cases, clergy sexual abuse victims may also have legal options available against clergy members who knew of or attempted to cover up the claimed abuse. Victims have until their 20th birthday to file a civil suit in these cases. Also known as a discovery rule, Hawaii law allows an additional two years beyond this time limit to create a civil lawsuit against the religious organization or institution for ignoring or covering up credibly accused cases of sexual misconduct or abuse.\n\nFiling a Clergy Sexual Abuse Lawsuit in Hawaii\n\nA civil suit filed allows a survivor to allege abuse against their abuser, helping to serve justice and hold the responsible parties accountable. Here is what you can expect when filing a clergy sexual abuse lawsuit in Hawaii:\n\nSchedule a Complimentary Consultation â€“ A complimentary, confidential consultation lets Hawaii victims learn more about their legal options.\n\nCollect Evidence and Build a Case â€“ If you decide to file a lawsuit, our legal team will build your case through evidence collection. Our team works hard to build a strong case, including witness reports, previous accusations of sexually abusing minors, and diocese records.\n\nExplore Settlement Options â€“ Catholic Church dioceses commonly settle lawsuits against accused clergy, usually to shield the churchâ€™s reputation. However, not every settlement offer covers the damages incurred through clergy abuse, especially in cases of repeated abuse.\n\nPrepare for Trial â€“ In certain cases, it may make more sense to prepare for trial and share your story with a jury.\n\nContact Rosenfeld Injury Lawyers today for a free consultation.\n\nSupport Resources for Survivors in Hawaii\n\nVictims of clergy sexual abuse may experience long-lasting psychological consequences. Support services are available in Hawaii to help victims overcome some of these consequences, including the following:\n\nChild & Family Service: The Child & Family Service organization connects Hawaii survivors to sexual abuse resources, including 24-hour hotline numbers based on county.\n\nSex Abuse Treatment Center of Hawaiâ€™i: The Sex Abuse Treatment Center helps women and children who have been sexually assaulted.\n\nRoman Catholic Church in the State of Hawaii: Honolulu Diocese: The Roman Catholic Church of Hawaii offers victims tools for reporting sexual abuse and misconduct.\n\nThe Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests (SNAP): The SNAP network offers resources to those who were sexually or physically attacked by a priest or religious clergy members.\n\nEmotional support is crucial when overcoming abuse in the church. Legal support can also help survivors collect the compensation they need to access additional important recovery resources.\n\nNotable Cases and Outcomes in Hawaii\n\nThe majority of child sex abuse lawsuits against the Honolulu Diocese were filed in the early 2010s when survivors started coming forward with credible accusations against priests and church officials.\n\nAmong these, most reports were claiming abuse occurred at two locations, the Damien Memorial School and Saint Anthonyâ€™s Church in Kailua, Hawaii. The Catholic dioceses settled many of these cases outside of court, some for undisclosed amounts. However, itâ€™s estimated that Hawaii diocese officials have paid millions of dollars in settlements. While the details of each credibly accused clergy member differ, in each, the lawsuit alleged sexual abuse.\n\nThe attorneys at Rosenfeld Injury Lawyers have reviewed public and private settlement data related to Hawaii clergy abuse settlements. Depending on the details of your case, these cases may be fairly valued in the $400,000 to $950,000 range. In cases of extreme conduct or if a case were to go before a jury, damages could exceed $1 million.\n\nWhy Choose Rosenfeld Injury Lawyers?\n\nRosenfeld Injury Lawyers aims to help Hawaii victims overcome the impacts of sexual abuse in the clergy. You put your trust in the priest and clergy members; when they break that trust, they deserve to be held accountable.\n\nOur legal team has a proven track record of helping survivors of sexual abuse come forward to share their stories. Reporting and filing a civil lawsuit against your abuser or the clergy members who covered it up is incredibly brave, and the Rosenfeld Injury Lawyers team is here with years of experience to guide you every step of the way.\n\nWhether the abuse allegedly occurred a few months ago or a few decades ago, we encourage you to set up a complimentary, confidential consultation with our legal team.
