        "text": "Who is a Young Adult?\n\nA young adult, as defined by Sons and Daughters of the Light is \"anyone in the late teens, twenties, and thirties.\" To put a numerical values to that, a young adult is anyone ages 18 through 39.\n\nSupporting Young Adults\n\nYes, this age gap is huge, but it doesn't mean there can't be opportunities available for every age of young adult to grow. To ensure this happens the Diocese of Honolulu opened the Office of Youth & Young Adult Ministry (OYYAM) on November 1, 2009. The OYYAM offers many opportunities (events, workshops and forums) for young adults to learn more about themselves, the Catholic Church, its Teachings, and other young adults their age.\n\nGetting Involved\n\nWith that said, there's a place for everyone! Whether you're looking for a social, volunteer, or spiritual kind of time, we want you to get connected where you are most comfortable. Looking for other young adults to meet and get to know? Check out our community map to find active parish communities in your area!\n\nStaying Connected\n\nThere are a bunch of ways to keep up with the Catholic Community here in Hawai'i. In fact, you're on one of them right now! Here's three other ways to stay connected:\n\nDiocese of Honolulu Website\n\nBesides this site, there's also the Diocese of Honolulu's website with the same content plus much more!\n\nHawaii Young Adult App\n\nIf you're on the go, check out our FREE app --> HI-YA\n\nDownload Yapp from the AppStore or GooglePlay\n\nEnter your name and our app code W6FZLL,\n\nNow you'll be connected anywhere you go!\n\nThe Update - Hawaii Young Adult Newsletter\n\nThe new way for young adults to get news specifically designed with their interests in mind: The Update, the Hawaii Young Adult Newsletter."
