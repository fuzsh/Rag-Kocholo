        "text": "(ran RN RS RP RH RC editions)\n\nThe five-county Roman Catholic Diocese of St. Petersburg announced this week that parishioners in its 76 churches contributed more than $450,000 this month to victims of Hurricane Andrew in Florida and Louisiana and Hurricane Iniki in Hawaii. \"Bishop John C. Favalora sent checks this week to six dioceses in the United States, along with assurances of prayers from the 350,000-plus Catholics\" in the diocese, the announcement said. The money, which was sent to the Catholic Charities office of each diocese to be spent as needed, was distributed as follows: $250,000 to the Archdiocese of Miami; $50,000 to the Diocese of Venice; $60,000 to the Diocese of Lafayette, La.; $25,000 to the Archdiocese of New Orleans; and $15,000 to the Diocese of Houma-Thibodaux, La. The rest of the donations will go to the Diocese of Honolulu in Hawaii, the diocese said. Most of the donations were given during special parish collections Aug. 30. Favalora also has received donations from individuals in September, the diocese said. One of the individuals was Karen Sutherlin, owner of the Jake Sutherlin Nissan Inc. car dealership in Tampa who donated 12 cars to the diocese to help raise money for the hurricane victims, the diocese said.\n\nBanker to head fund drive\n\nfor Catholic schools\n\nST. PETERSBURG _ A. Bronson Thayer, chairman of First Florida Banks Inc., will head an appeal to the business community to raise money for Catholic schools in the Diocese of St. Petersburg, the diocese's Catholic Education Foundation announced this week. Bishop John C. Favalora has scheduled a news conference for Wednesday to announce Thayer's role. The foundation said Thayer \"will lead the bishop's effort to establish a $15-million endowment fund for Catholic education.\" With Favalora and members of the foundation board, Thayer will direct a \"Business Appeal,\" opening the campaign to the general business community, the group said. Thayer is a non-Catholic but is \"a longtime supporter of Catholic education,\" according to the foundation. Thayer hosted a series of breakfasts for the bishop last year, inviting business leaders to hear Favalora's appeal message, the foundation noted. Thayer also has assembled a team of business representatives to help solicit donations from those interested in supporting the 32 schools in the five-county diocese, it said.\n\nAnglican urges Catholics\n\nto allow married priests\n\nHEBRON, Ky. _ The leader of the world's 70-million Anglicans is urging the Roman Catholic Church to allow priests to marry to help alleviate the shortage of priests. Responding to questions at a news conference here Monday at the Greater Cincinnati International Airport, Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey said, \"I would want to challenge the Roman Catholic Church that perhaps it is time that they welcomed a married priesthood. And I'd want to say that, from our experience within the Anglican tradition, there's nothing to fear from that.\" Carey, who is on a tour of the United States, made those comments in response to a reporter's question about the shortage of priests facing the Catholic Church. Carey added, \"I gain a great deal of strength from the support of my wife. . . . In no way does it diminish (my) commitment to Christ and to the sacraments that we celebrate.\" As archbishop of Canterbury, Carey is the symbolic leader of Anglicans the world over, represented by the Episcopal Church in the United States. Carey said he hopes for closer links between Anglicans and Catholics but acknowledged that the decision to ordain women in some branches of Anglicanism, including the Episcopal Church in the United States, makes closer relations difficult. In response to a question about family values, Carey suggested that notions of \"right and wrong\" begin to develop in the home but cannot be seen as divorced from social settings. \"Those who think that you can just put down a moral value system on people in desperate situations have only half the answer,\" Carey said.\n\nCounsel explains rules\n\nfor political involvement\n\nWASHINGTON _ A memorandum to U.S. Catholic bishops from their general counsel, Mark E. Chopko, spells out the kind of political activity permissible to tax-exempt organizations. The memo says they are specifically prohibited from any oral or written statements supporting or opposing any particular candidate, whether in sermons, parish bulletins or editorials in church papers. However, \"the right to participate in the political process is\n\na fundamental constitutional liberty that extends to churches and other religious organizations,\" the memorandum says. It says \"Catholic bishops have consistently urged broad participation in the political process\" and they have a special role in educating on church teachings and analyzing moral dimensions of issues.\n\nLutheran Church urges\n\nattention to environment\n\nNEW YORK _ The first draft of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America's proposed social teaching on the environment calls on church members to commit to lifestyles that contribute to the health of creation. \"As a church, we will avoid waste _ recycling, reducing and reusing. We will budget and invest our resources in ways that show care for the earth,\" the draft says. The draft also calls for congregations to become \"creation awareness centers.\" The statement is expected to be voted on in August 1993 at the denomination's assembly in Kansas City.\n\n\"Sports builds bridges,'\n\nBaptist consultant says\n\nNEW YORK _ A new global sports consultant for a Southern Baptist aid organization hopes to involve Christian volunteers in meeting athletic needs throughout the world. \"Sports is a common denominator throughout the world. It builds bridges,\" said Steve DeVoss, a youth worker in Norman, Okla., who in October will become a sports consultant for Cooperative Services International. \"After all,\" DeVoss told Baptist Press, \"didn't God create the world in the shape of a ball?\"\n\nBaptist groups reach\n\nagreement at conference\n\nHAMBURG, Germany _ Leaders of the European Baptist Federation and the Southern Baptist Foreign Mission Board have reached a tentative agreement in a yearlong dispute that involves mission funding and philosophy. At a two-day meeting here that ended Sept. 12, leaders of both sides signed a 10-point pact that permits the European Baptists to work with both the Southern Baptist Foreign Mission Board in Richmond, Va., and the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship, an organization of dissident Southern Baptists based in Atlanta. Relations between the Southern Baptist agency and the European Baptists were strained last October when trustees of the Southern Baptist board decided to stop funding a seminary in Ruschlikon, Switzerland. The seminary had been started by the Southern Baptist board in 1948 and transferred to the European Baptist Federation in 1989. When the Southern Baptist board decided to stop funding the seminary, trustees cited alleged liberal teachings at the school.\n\nABC to air special on\n\nJewish High Holy Days\n\nAn hourlong special, Guilt and Repentance, which focuses on the meaning of the upcoming Jewish High Holy Days, will air on ABC, Sunday, Sept. 27, 12:30-1:30 p.m. Guilt and Repentance examines the central themes of self-examination, accountability, repentance and rebirth that mark the High Holy Days services that begin Sunday night, Sept. 27.

Shargel of the Jewish Community Center of Harrison, N.Y. These segments take place at Congregation Bnai Jeshurun, New York City. The meaning of the prayers and their relation to modern life are analyzed by Dr. Robert Abramovitz, chief psychiatrist for the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services, and Dr. Lawrence Hoffman, professor of liturgy at Hebrew Union College/Jewish Institute of Religion. Dr. Neil Gillman, associate professor of Jewish philosophy at the Jewish Theological Seminary, is host and moderator.\n\nConference for Catholic\n\nwomen set Sept. 27-29\n\nPALM BEACH GARDENS _ The 10th biennial conference of the Florida Council of Catholic Women will be held Sept. 27-29 in Palm Beach Gardens. The Rev. James Larkin, moderator for the St. Petersburg Diocesan Council of Catholic Women, will be a concelebrant at the Eucharistic Liturgy before the opening of the conference. He also will offer the invocation at the leadership workshop Sept. 29. Bishop John C. Favalora of the Diocese of St. Petersburg will concelebrate a Mass at St. Ignatius Loyola Cathedral preceding the celebration banquet. He will be joined by bishops from other Florida dioceses. Attending from the St. Petersburg area will be Therese Minervini, president of the St. Petersburg Diocesan Council of Catholic Women, Lillian Gemeinhardt and Alison Mims, first and second vice presidents of the DCCW.

The center in Tampa joins centers in Tallahassee and St. Petersburg. For information on the grand opening or classes taught at the center call 289-0172.\n\nJudge halts distribution of\n\nfilm with Donald Wildmon\n\nTUPELO, Miss. _ A federal judge has temporarily halted distribution of a British-made film that includes an interview with the Rev. Donald Wildmon, the anti-pornography crusader, to allow Wildmon to pursue a full appeal against its showing. Wildmon, a United Methodist minister, heads the American Family Association of Tupelo, Miss. He charged that the use of the interview in the film along with what he described as \"hard-core sex acts and anti-Christian imagery\" violated a contract that allowed him to determine how the interview would be used. Last week U.S. District Judge Glenn Davidson ruled in Aberdeen, Miss., that Wildmon could not stop distribution of the film, titled Damned in The USA. But on Tuesday, Davidson issued an injunction against its showing while Wildmon's attorney seeks a permanent injunction in a federal appeals court in New Orleans. Benjamin W. Bull, Wildmon's attorney, said Wednesday that Wildmon had signed a contract with Paul Yule, the film's producer, limiting airing of the interview to Channel 4 in London without Wildmon's written permission.\n\nExperts: Graveyard likely\n\ndoesn't hold Bacon vault\n\nScientists have concluded that people digging in the graveyard of a historic Virginia church where George Washington and Thomas Jefferson once worshiped won't find what they're looking for: a vault containing the writings of Elizabethan philosopher Francis Bacon. According to Paul Parsons, administrator of the 320-year-old Bruton Parish Church in Williamsburg, archaeologists and a geologist concluded a two-week investigation of the site Sept. 11, but came up with no evidence of any vault. Church officials had authorized excavation of the graveyard partly in hopes of discouraging clandestine nighttime digging there by New Age enthusiasts of Bacon, who died in 1626. According to Parsons, the New Age group Veritat contended the vault was in the graveyard based on what he termed the \"highly speculative\" writings of self-described Christian mystic Marie Bauer Hall, who reportedly got her information from analyzing cryptograms and anagrams on headstones at the site. Those suspicions were given a measure of credibility in 1986 after radar tests revealed the presence of what appeared to be a large underground object measuring 10 feet by 10 feet. A team of about 10 archaeologists from the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation first excavated the portion of the graveyard where the vault was thought to be buried. Then, after the archaeologists found no evidence of a vault, a geologist was called in to drill borings in the area down to a depth of 20 feet, the level of the Chesapeake Bay water table. There was still no evidence of a vault. Beyond that point, there is virtually no chance settlers could have buried a vault, officials believe.\n\nActivists wage campaign to save burial ground\n\nNEW YORK _ Religious and political leaders who have championed saving a colonial-era cemetery widely regarded as one of the nation's most significant archaeological sites for black people, say the most compelling reason to preserve it is religious. Activists, seeking to halt construction of a 34-story office tower under way at the 18-century site in lower Manhattan, want the cemetery to be designated as both a city and a national landmark. They say the 400 burials and 1-million artifacts excavated so far are providing valuable information about African-American history, which had its beginnings in the church. The cemetery, known as the Negro Burial Ground, contains \"the religious and cultural history of some of our citizenry, and much more, the social legacy of all of us,\" said Manhattan Borough President Ruth W. Messinger.\n\n_ Compiled from staff reports and news services to the Times"
