Archives\n\n1184 Bishop Street\n\nHonolulu, HI 96813-2858\n\nPhone: 808-533-1791\n\nHistory: Erected for Hawaii, 1941, the Diocese of Honolulu succeeded the Prefecture-Apostolic for the Hawaiian/ Sandwich Islands, 1826-1844, and the Vicariate-Apostolate for the Hawaiian Islands, 1844-1941, both of which were under the leadership of the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary. Since the 1840s, some Catholic Native Americans have resided in the Honolulu area resulting from employment in the fishing industry and service in the U.S. Armed Forces. In 1999, it was estimated that 500 baptized Native American Catholics resided in the Honolulu Diocese.\n\nHoldings of Catholic records about Native Americans:\n\nInclusive dates: 1843-present\n\nVolume: Some entries\n\nDescription: Sacramental records (e.g. baptism, marriages, burials) for Native American parishioners of Our Lady of Peace Cathedral, Honolulu, and other parishes. For records at Pearl Harbor Naval Station, Honolulu, see the guide entry for Archdiocese for the Military Services, Washington, District of Columbia.\n\nUnless otherwise noted, the repository on this page holds (or held) the records described here and they are not held at the Marquette University Archives.\n\nnew2006/rev2017-2020"
