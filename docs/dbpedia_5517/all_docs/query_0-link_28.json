        "text": "Diocese of Honolulu Rice Bowl Activities\n\n“I strongly encourage you all to participate in the CRS Lenten Rice Bowl program, to share the journey, and to witness to Jesus by helping others in need survive and thrive.”\n\n~ Most Rev. Larry Silva, Bishop of Honolulu\n\nCRS Rice Bowl is Catholic Relief Services’ Lenten program for families and faith communities in the United States who want to put their faith into action. CRS Rice Bowl joins 14,000 faith communities in 180 dioceses around the U.S. in prayer, fasting, and almsgiving. Through CRS Rice Bowl, participants are invited to hear stories about their brothers and sisters in need around the world, and devote their Lenten prayers, fasting and alms to change the lives of those who suffer in poverty. Participants journey through the 40 days of Lent with a collection of daily reflections and activities included in the CRS Rice Bowl calendar and on the mobile app.\n\nOne ‘Ohana: Food & Housing for All!\n\nStewards of the Gospel\n\nBishop Larry Silva’s Diocesan Pastoral Plan for 2016-2020: Stewards of the Gospel outlines four strategic priorities.\n\nFaith Formation\n\nLeadership Development\n\nStrengthening of Marriage and Family Life\n\nYouth and Young Adult Ministry\n\nAll of the above are interwoven with vital threads of stewardship, evangelization and social ministry to help deepen our faith and to send us forth as joyful missionaries equipped to Witness to Jesus by living and sharing our faith with others.\n\nHawaii Rice Bowl Mini Grants\n\nCycle one Awardees:\n\nSt. John the Baptist Parish, Kalihi – Kūpuna\n\nHoly Cross Parish, Kalaheo – Kūpuna\n\nSt. Ann Parish, Kaneohe – Homeless\n\nSt. Stephen Parish, Nuuanu – Housed Vets; Garden\n\nSt. Damien Parish, Kaunakakai – Kūpuna; Keiki\n\nSt. John Apostle & Evangelist, Mililani – Kūpuna\n\n“We need to strengthen the conviction that we are one single human family”~ Pope Francis\n\nThe Hawaii Sustainable Nutritious Food Network was created by our partners at the Hawaii Alliance for Community Based Economic Development (HACBED) in 2013 in response to Pope Francis’ call for a worldwide effort to address hunger. Our network consists of religious organizations, school gardens, food ministries, organic farms, local nonprofits, and community-based organizations that work together toward long-term systemic solutions and opportunities that strengthen family, community resilience and self-sufficiency in response to homelessness and hunger.\n\nSTEWARDSHIP PROCESS FOR CRS RICE BOWL\n\nHow are CRS Rice Bowl donations used? Donations given to CRS Rice Bowl are used to alleviate hunger and poverty around the world and in the United States. 75% of gifts go to CRS and are used to support humanitarian programs around the world. 25% of gifts remain in the local diocese to support local hunger and poverty alleviation.\n\nDiocesan Stewardship of CRS Rice Bowl Donations Catholic Relief Services allows (arch)dioceses in the United States who participate in CRS Rice Bowl to keep 25% of the collection to be used for local hunger and poverty alleviation programming.\n\nPurpose: Catholic Relief Services believes that the 25% of CRS Rice Bowl contributions remaining in the dioceses serves to illustrate the importance of our global responsibility as Christians to assist those in need both in our local communities and in other countries. These funds not only support local anti-hunger programs but also can help strengthen relationships between the diocese, parishes and local communities.\n\nIf you are on educator, click below to sign up for weekly lesson plans:\n\nEducator Materials\n\nFor more information on parish involvement, click below:\n\nOffice for Social Ministry\n\nHawaii Catholic Herald features a bi-monthly “Talk Story” column that highlights parish involvement in social ministry.
