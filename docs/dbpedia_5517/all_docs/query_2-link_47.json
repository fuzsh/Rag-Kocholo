        "text": "SACRAMENTS\n\nBaptism\n\nFor infants, contact the office for a registration form, and to find out the next preparation classes for Parents and Godparents. For older children and adults, enroll them in one of the following programs.\n\n1st Holy Communion, Confirmation:\n\nReligious Education (K-8), Youth Ministry (9-12), Young Adult Ministry, and RCIC/RCIA are starting in September. Contact the office for more information\n\nHoly Matrimony:\n\nMarriage is a very significant event and requires preparation to celebrate it properly. If you are planning to marry, the Diocesan policy is that you see a Priest and begin the preparation at least six months prior to the wedding date. Please call the rectory for an appointment.\n\nCannot Marry in the Catholic Church Due to Prior Marriage?\n\nPope Francis streamlined the process to petition for a declaration of nullity to make the process shorter. He also eliminated the mandatory fee. If a person is able to prove in this process that their prior marital bond was invalid for some reason, then he or she can marry in the Catholic Church or validate a current civil marriage. For assistance in petitioning, you can contact Fr. PJ Camiring, Vanessa Mark, BJ Schreiner or Sister Lucinda at [808-988-3308] who can assist you as an advocate.\n\nVocations:\n\nContact Fr. Nick Brown\n\nFunerals Arrangements\n\nThough not a Sacrament, when death occurs, contact the parish office immediately\n\nStory of Saint Clare of Assisi\n\n(Feast Day: August 11)\n\nOne of the more sugary movies made about Francis of Assisi pictures Clare as a golden haired beauty floating through sun-drenched fields, a sort of one-woman counterpart to the new Franciscan Order.\n\nThe beginning of her religious life was indeed movie material. Having refused to marry at 15, Clare was moved by the dynamic preaching of Francis. He became her lifelong friend and spiritual guide.\n\nAt 18, Clare escaped from her father’s home one night, was met on the road by friars carrying torches, and in the poor little chapel called the Portiuncula received a rough woolen habit, exchanged her jeweled belt for a common rope with knots in it, and sacrificed her long tresses to Francis’ scissors. He placed her in a Benedictine convent, which her father and uncles immediately stormed in rage. Clare clung to the altar of the church, threw aside her veil to show her cropped hair, and remained adamant.\n\nSixteen days later her sister Agnes joined her. Others came. They lived a simple life of great poverty, austerity, and complete seclusion from the world, according to a Rule which Francis gave them as a Second Order. At age 21, Francis obliged Clare under obedience to accept the office of abbess, one she exercised until her death\n\nSaint Jane Frances de Chantal’s Story\n\n(Feast Day: August 12)\n\nJane Frances was wife, mother, nun, and founder of a religious community. Her mother died when she was 18 months old, and her father, head of parliament at Dijon, France, became the main influence on her education. Jane developed into a woman of beauty and refinement, lively and cheerful in temperament. At 21, she married Baron de Chantal, by whom she had six children, three of whom died in infancy. At her castle, she restored the custom of daily Mass, and was seriously engaged in various charitable works. Jane’s husband was killed after seven years of marriage, and she sank into deep dejection for four months at her family home. Her father-in-law threatened to disinherit her children if she did not return to his home. He was then 75, vain, fierce, and extravagant. Jane Frances managed to remain cheerful in spite of him and his insolent housekeeper. When she was 32, Jane met Saint Francis de Sales who became her spiritual director, softening some of the severities imposed by her former director. She wanted to become a nun but he persuaded her to defer this decision. She took a vow to remain unmarried and to obey her director.\n\nAfter three years, Francis told Jane of his plan to found an institute of women that would be a haven for those whose health, age, or other considerations barred them from entering the already established communities. There would be no cloister, and they would be free to undertake spiritual and corporal works of mercy. They were primarily intended to exemplify the virtues of Mary at the Visitation—hence their name the Visitation nuns—humility and meekness.\n\nWhat a marvel Jesus is! We all get tired at times, and some of us are always tired. But the God of Israel “never slumbers nor sleeps”. Jesus never gets worn out. He never complains, and he never feels sorry for himself. Just as he did throughout his life, and especially on the cross, he continues to give without counting the cost.\n\nThe usual opposition to women in active ministry arose and Francis de Sales was obliged to make it a cloistered community following the Rule of Saint Augustine. Francis wrote his famous Treatise on the Love of God for them. The congregation consisting of three women began when Jane Frances was 45. She underwent great sufferings: Francis de Sales died; her son was killed; a plague ravaged France; her daughter-in-law and son-in-law died. She encouraged the local authorities to make great efforts for the victims of the plague, and she put all her convent’s resources at the disposal of the sick.\n\nDuring a part of her religious life, Jane Frances had to undergo great trials of the spirit—interior anguish, darkness, and spiritual dryness. She died while on a visitation of convents of the community.\n\nSaint Maximilian Mary Kolbey\n\nFeast Day: August 14\n\n“I don’t know what’s going to become of you!” How many parents have said that? Maximilian Mary Kolbe’s reaction was, “I prayed very hard to Our Lady to tell me what would happen to me. She appeared, holding in her hands two crowns, one white, one red. She asked if I would like to have them—one was for purity, the other for martyrdom. I said, ‘I choose both.’ She smiled and disappeared.” After that he was not the same.\n\nHe entered the minor seminary of the Conventual Franciscans in Lvív–then Poland, now Ukraine– near his birthplace, and at 16 became a novice. Though Maximilian later achieved doctorates in philosophy and theology, he was deeply interested in science, even drawing plans for rocket ships. He entered the minor seminary of the Conventual Franciscans in Lvív–then Poland, now Ukraine– near his birthplace, and at 16 became a novice. Though Maximilian later achieved doctorates in philosophy and theology, he was deeply interested in science, even drawing plans for rocket ships.\n\nOrdained at 24, Maximilian saw religious indifference as the deadliest poison of the day. His mission was to combat it. He had already founded the Militia of the Immaculata, whose aim was to fight evil with the witness of the good life, prayer, work, and suffering. He dreamed of and then founded Knight of the Immaculata, a religious magazine under Mary’s protection to preach the Good News to all nations. For the work of publication he established a “City of the Immaculata”—Niepokalanow—which housed 700 of his Franciscan brothers. He later founded another one in Nagasaki, Japan. Both the Militia and the magazine ultimately reached the one-million mark in members and subscribers. His love of God was daily filtered through devotion to Mary. In 1939, the Nazi panzers overran Poland with deadly speed. Niepokalanow was severely bombed. Kolbe and his friars were arrested, then released in less than three months, on the feast of the Immaculate Conception.\n\nA prisoner had escaped. The commandant announced that 10 men would die. He relished walking along the ranks. “This one. That one.” As they were being marched away to the starvation bunkers, Number 16670 dared to step from the line. “I would like to take that man’s place. He has a wife and children.”\n\n“Who are you?”\n\n“A priest.”\n\nNo name, no mention of fame. Silence. The commandant, dumb founded, perhaps with a fleeting thought of history, kicked Sergeant Francis Gajowniczek out of line and ordered Fr. Kolbe to go with the nine. In the “block of death” they were ordered to strip naked, and their slow starvation began in darkness. But there was no screaming—the prisoners sang. By the eve of the Assumption, four were left alive. The jailer came to finish Kolbe off as he sat in a corner praying. He lifted his fleshless arm to receive the bite of the hypodermic needle. It was filled with carbolic acid. They burned his body with all the others."
