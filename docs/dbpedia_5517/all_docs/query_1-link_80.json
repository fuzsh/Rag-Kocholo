From small rural chapels to huge cathedrals located in the heart of Hawaii’s capitol, the Hawaiian Islands are home to some incredible churches. But there is no chapel more beautiful – both inside and out – than St. Benedict’s Roman Catholic Church, located in the Big Island’s Honaunau.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor a schedule of mass, please visit the St. Benedict Roman Catholic Church website.
