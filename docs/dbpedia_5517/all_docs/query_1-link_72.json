        "text": "National Historic Trail\n\nAla Kahakai\n\nthe Island of Hawaii, HI\n\nEstablished in 2000 to preserve, protect and interpret traditional Native Hawaiian culture and natural resources, Ala Kahakai National Historic Trail is a 175 mile corridor encompassing a network of culturally and historically significant trails. This \"trail by the sea\" traverses wahi pana (storied landscapes), ancient Hawaiian sites and over 200 ahupua?a (traditional land divisions). Connect now!\n\nNational Park\n\nHaleakalā\n\nKula, Maui, HI\n\nThis special place vibrates with stories of ancient and modern Hawaiian culture and protects the bond between the land and its people. The park also cares for endangered species, some of which exist nowhere else. Come visit this special place - renew your spirit amid stark volcanic landscapes and sub-tropical rain forest with an unforgettable hike through the backcountry.\n\nNational Park\n\nHawaiʻi Volcanoes\n\nHilo, HI\n\nHawai‘i Volcanoes National Park protects some of the most unique geological, biological, and cherished cultural landscapes in the world. Extending from sea level to 13,680 feet, the park encompasses the summits of two of the world's most active volcanoes - Kilauea and Mauna Loa - and is a designated International Biosphere Reserve and UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nNational Historic Site\n\nHonouliuli\n\nHI\n\nAlthough not yet open to the public, Honouliuli National Historic Site will tell the history of incarceration, martial law, and the experience of prisoners of war in Hawai‘i during World War II. Honouliuli National Historic Site will be a place to reflect on wartime experiences and recommit ourselves to the pursuit of freedom and justice.\n\nNational Historical Park\n\nKalaupapa\n\nKalaupapa, HI\n\nWhen Hansen's disease (leprosy) was introduced to the Hawaiian Islands, King Kamehameha V banished all afflicted to the isolated Kalaupapa Peninsula on the north shore of Molokai. Since 1866, more than 8,000 people, mostly Hawaiians, have died at Kalaupapa. Once a prison, Kalaupapa is now a refuge for the few remaining residents who are cured but were forced to live their lives in isolation.\n\nNational Historical Park\n\nKaloko-Honokōhau\n\nKailua-Kona, HI\n\nTo survive in a hot and arid environment the native Hawaiians (kanaka maoli) used ancient fishing skills, including the building of fishponds, and the knowledge of the location of precious fresh water (wai) that flows into the many brackish pools throughout the park. The spirit of the people (poe) and the knowledge of the elders (kupuna) created a tradition of respect and reverence for this area.\n\nNational Memorial\n\nPearl Harbor\n\nHonolulu, HI\n\nAt the Pearl Harbor National Memorial, learn about one of the most pivotal moments in US history: the attack on Pearl Harbor, and the subsequent entry of the United States into World War II.\n\nNational Historical Park\n\nPuʻuhonua o Hōnaunau\n\nHonaunau, HI\n\nImagine you had just broken the sacred laws, the kapu, and the only punishment was death. Your only chance of survival is to elude your pursuers and reach the Pu?uhonua, a place of refuge. The Pu?uhonua protected the kapu breaker, defeated warriors, as well as civilians during the time of battle. No physical harm could come to those who reached the boundaries of the Pu?uhonua.\n\nNational Historic Site\n\nPuʻukoholā Heiau\n\nKawaihae, HI\n\nHow many places in America can you walk in the footsteps of a king? Where else has a stranded sailor risen up to become a great chief over an entire island? Where else can you experience the culminating event of a people, foretold from centuries past? Where else can you stand on a beach and watch as sharks pass over a submerged temple? Experience all this and much more – only at Pu'ukohola Heiau!"
