These are granted only by the Bishop or his Vicar General. The normal procedure is to obtain these in writing. However, in emergencies, they can be granted verbally and confirmed by letter. (Note: the State of Hawaii requires a license to witness weddings.)\n\nA visiting priest who stays in a parish house more than one month for purposes other than vacation must present himself to the Bishop, the Vicar General, or the Vicar for Clergy. Request for faculties must be made ahead of time, if possible. Further, they are to make their presence known upon arrival to the appropriate person (Vicar General, Vicar for Clergy or the Vicar Forane).\n\nClergy visiting less than a month must present to the local pastor their celebret or letter of suitability.\n\nPlease contact Fr.
