        "text": "A PRAYER FOR PEACE\n\nby Pope Francis\n\nIn the Name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, Lord God of peace, hear our Prayer!\n\nWe have tried so many times and over so many years to resolve our confilcts by our own powers and by the force of our arms.\n\nHow many moments of hostility and darkness have we experienced?\n\nHow much blood has been shed?\n\nHow many lives have been shattered?\n\nHow many hopes have been buried?\n\nBut our efforts have been in vain.\n\nNow, Lord come to our aid!\n\nGrant us peace, teach us peace;\n\nguide our steps in the way of peace.\n\nOpen our eyes and our hearts,\n\nand give us the courage to say:\"Never again war!\"\"With war everything is lost\".\n\nInstill in our hearts the courage to take concrete steps to achieve peace.\n\nLord, God of Abraham, God of the Prophets, God of Love, you created us and you call us to live as brothers and sisters.\n\nGive us the strength daily to be instruments of peace; enable us to see everyone who crosses our path as our brother or sister.\n\nMake us sensitive to the plea of our citizens who entreat us to turn our weapons of war into implements of peace, our trepidation into confident trust, and our quarreling into forgiveness. Keep alive within us the flame of hope, so that with patience and preserverance we may opt for dialogue and reconciliation. In this way may peace triumph at last, and may the words \"division\" \"hatred\" and \"war\" be banished from the heart of every man and woman.\n\nLord, defuse the violence of our tongues and our hands. Renew our hearts and minds, so that the word which always brings us together will be \"brother,\" and our way of life will always be that of: Shalom, Peace, Salaam!"
