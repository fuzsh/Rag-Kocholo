At this time,  we reflect on our life, ask for forgiveness,  and continue to do good works... \n\nThe address is same as my home parish of St. Stephen.  I was baptized, confirmed,  & married here. I also received my First Holy Communion in the days when we had to wear a hat or some other head covering. \n\nI don't remember when the Mass changed from Latin to English or when the priest had his back to us.  I do know the Catholic church has come a long way and is more accepting of differences.\n\nThe people are very warm and friendly - possibly due to the Welcoming Committee,  the Bereavement Committee,  the Social Committee,  etc.  The parishioners are interested in each other and do many activities together and even outside of the church such as travelling and parties. \n\nThe food at every function is beautiful and tasty because it is prepared with love.  The music is cheerful and inspirational; the surroundings are clean; the location is convenient; the decorations are simple and apropriate; the children are happy and the kupuna are respected.  What more could you ask for?\"",
