        "text": "Sunday School\n\nThe Protestant Sunday School program includes classes for both adults and children. A nursery for children ages 3 months to 3 years is also available during Sunday School.\n\nConfraternity of Christian Doctrine (CCD)\n\nThe Confraternity of Christian Doctrine (CCD) and the Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults (RCIA) programs for Catholics are a vital part of the religious education program. We utilize \"Faith First\" the same curriculum as Navy chapels in the Northwest Navy Region (Washington state) and the Southwest Navy Region (Southern California, Nevada and Arizona) to better serve Navy families who may move between these regions. The RCIA curriculum is also web-based to better serve active-duty personnel who may deploy or leave Pearl Harbor on official travel. The web address is www.faithfirst.com and the password is \"Trust\".\n\nChildren's Church\n\nThe Children's Church program occurs during parts of both Protestant services (8 a.m. and 11 a.m.). During this program, children between the age of 4 and 8 engage in activities and projects that help them to worship in a manner that is appropriate to their age level.\n\nVacation Bible School\n\nVacation Bible School occurs each year in June. Our school is a joint effort of the Protestant and Roman Catholic chapel communities at Pearl Harbor and Barber's Point.\n\nFor more information, please call 473-3971.\n\nCREDO HAWAII\n\nMarriage Enrichment Retreat / Workshop\n\nThis weekend is intended to assist married couples in strengthening their relationship skills. It is designed to build resilience and strengthen marriages that will flourish amidst the challenges of military service. Couples will learn material that is a scientifically-based and empirically-tested. Topics covered include communication, conflict management, commitment, friendship, sensuality, problem-solving, and emotional supportiveness, among others.\n\nCommand Support Training\n\nCREDO offers programs to support command effectiveness. Our Team Building Programs are designed to build more effective and cohesive teams through understanding and leveraging leadership skills that build trust with oneâ€™s self, relationships, the command, and the larger society.\n\nFamily Enrichment Retreat\n\nThis weekend is designed to help each military family increase the positive aspects and functions of the family system. The operational tempo of the military force, multiple deployments, and family separation has placed unique stressors upon military families. The family enrichment retreat is intended to enhance family function/dynamics by engaging in quality communication, problem-solving, familial appreciation, and cohesion, among others.\n\nPersonal Resilience Retreat\n\nThe Personal Resilience Retreats is designed to empower participants in fostering positive personal growth, positive self-regard, and a heightened state of resilience. This retreat offered at CREDO takes full advantage of the great outdoors in Hawaii.\n\nSuicide Prevention\n\nThe CREDO Suicide Prevention Workshops are a multi-tiered program intended to provide standardized professional training for helping professionals in order to establish a common baseline for suicide prevention training methods and skill levels.\n\nAll retreats are considered military training; therefore, all active duty members are required to attend the entire retreat. Active duty members may also be asked to obtain permission from their commands to attend the retreat with the understanding that the member will be unavailable for any training, duty, or command functions.\n\nPhone Number:\n\n(808) 473-1434\n\nFacebook Page:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/HawaiiCREDO/"
