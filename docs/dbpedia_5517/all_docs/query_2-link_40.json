        "text": "By Rev. Fr. Edgar B. Brillantes\n\nAugust 11, 2024\n\nFOCUS: Those who receive the Eucharist with eyes of faith can rejoice in Jesus’ promise of eternal life.\n\nIn the Eucharist, the Lord has given us a great gift: his whole self – body, blood, soul, and divinity. This can be challenging to accept since our eyes see what looks like bread. But those who see and receive this gift with the eyes of faith, trusting in the Lord’s words that he is the bread of life, can rejoice in his promise of eternal life.\n\nFirst Reading: 1 Kings 19:4-8\n\nElijah prays for death but is instead awakened by an angel of the Lord who commands him to eat and drink before traveling to the Lord’s mountain, Horeb.\n\nSecond Reading: Ephesians 4:30-5:2\n\nPaul exhorts the Ephesians to imitate God and treat each other lovingly."
