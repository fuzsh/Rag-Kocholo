Rose Ryan-Douglas started her radio career as a DJ and newscaster at WKPA and WYDD in New Kensington. After a year each at WFFM and 96 KX, Rose made the move to 3WS where she anchored Morning News for almost 20 years. She moved to KDKA in 2002 and has been an anchor at the legendary station ever since. Her final broadcast will be February 26.

Entercom Pittsburgh Market Manager Michael Spacciapolli said, “Rose has been the ultimate news professional, not only will we miss her on the air but her calming influence in the newsroom is irreplaceable. On behalf of all of us at KDKA Radio and our listeners we thank her for the tremendous work she has done over the years.”
