        "text": "Found this - it is Livorio\n\nThe Livorio legacy\n\nLivorio made it a tough act to follow. So ardent was his support that, in 1961, students from three Alle-Kiski high schools petitioned Kennywood Park to pipe Livorio's show into the park for their school picnic so they would not miss it.\n\nHe received 600 to 700 song requests a week from communities in the Alle-Kiski, Butler, Greensburg areas, as well as Pittsburgh and the city's northern and southern suburbs. One of Brennan's favorite memories is sitting on the living room floor on Friday nights with her brothers, Bob and Frank, and their mother, Barbara, as her dad sorted the letters, and the family discussed them.\n\nJimmy Beaumont of The Skyliners credits Livorio with helping keep the sound of his and other groups alive during the so-called British Invasion.\n\nIn a WQED-TV program called \"The Sound of Pittsburgh,\" Ohio native Tommy James talked about Livorio's role in popularizing his signature hit, \"Hanky Panky,\" which went to No. 1 in 1966.\n\nOf the hundreds of radio personalities who have passed through the Pittsburgh market in 85 years of radio, few make an impact, Antill says. \"The Valley has in Bob Livorio at least one of a handful of radio legends that shaped the way we grew up listening to the radio -- as a companion, a friend.\"\n\nAntill says WISH listeners quickly have accepted Brennan as one of their own, not unlike the way in which her father was embraced.\n\n\"She makes a great companion to their day, playing the kind of music they enjoy and talking about the things that interest them,\" he says.\n\nPittsburgh Tribune Review, April 18, 2005 Monday,\n\nBrennan joins family business on local airwaves\n\nBYLINE: Rex Rutkoski\n\nIn the freeze-framed moments of childhood, Cynthia Brennan remembers the dimly lit radio studios and her regular plea:\n\n\"Please, Dad, don't make me say anything. Do you promise?\"\n\nFor the most part, her dad, who for 36 years provided the soundtrack for the Alle-Kiski Valley and a large part of the Pittsburgh area on his Saturday morning \"Bob Livorio Show,\" honored her request.\n\nSometimes, during warm, spontaneous moments that were the essence of his program, and which made him a beloved oldies deejay, Brennan's father could not resist teasing Cynthia to the microphone during her visits to the now-defunct WKPA-AM studios in downtown New Kensington.\n\nBrennan long ago overcame audio stage fright -- for the betterment of Pittsburgh airwaves, say broadcasting veterans and others who employ and enjoy her talents -- and now talks with ease in a number of venues.\n\nFor the past 15 years, Brennan who, like her father, is a New Kensington resident, has traveled the tri-state area doing voice-over and on-camera commercials, industrial videos and long-format infomercials, enjoying visibility on broadcast and cable television, as well radio stations. She once was the voice of a passenger on the Titanic in a Discovery Channel commercial.\n\nNow, she has moved into the \"family business\" in a major way, becoming the most recent addition to adult-contemporary format WISH 99.7 FM, Pittsburgh, playing host during the 9 a.m.-to-2 p.m. slot weekdays.\n\nIt's official: She's a hit\n\nIt is an important time slot. Midday is the most important on WISH, says program director Ron Antill of Penn Hills.\n\n\"It's where most listening occurs,\" he says.\n\n\"Cynthia came in and just knocked it out of the park, improving the ratings substantially,\" general manager Tony Renda Jr. says. \"WISH is No. 1 with women 25 to 54. Our gains in midday have been tremendous.\"\n\nBrennan says she appreciates the power of radio, and is able to comprehend the bond between the listeners and her father. His show ended in 1993, when the station was sold. \"Fifteen-plus years in a city like Pittsburgh, you accumulate a lot of stories. It is with awe that I can appreciate my dad's years in the business,\" she says.\n\nThe looser format in her dad's era was more conducive to creating a relationship between listeners and DJs. The time constraints under which Brennan works, however, probably make achieving such a relationship more challenging.\n\nThe Livorio legacy\n\nLivorio made it a tough act to follow. So ardent was his support that, in 1961, students from three Alle-Kiski high schools petitioned Kennywood Park to pipe Livorio's show into the park for their school picnic so they would not miss it.\n\nHe received 600 to 700 song requests a week from communities in the Alle-Kiski, Butler, Greensburg areas, as well as Pittsburgh and the city's northern and southern suburbs. One of Brennan's favorite memories is sitting on the living room floor on Friday nights with her brothers, Bob and Frank, and their mother, Barbara, as her dad sorted the letters, and the family discussed them.\n\nJimmy Beaumont of The Skyliners credits Livorio with helping keep the sound of his and other groups alive during the so-called British Invasion.\n\nIn a WQED-TV program called \"The Sound of Pittsburgh,\" Ohio native Tommy James talked about Livorio's role in popularizing his signature hit, \"Hanky Panky,\" which went to No. 1 in 1966.\n\nOf the hundreds of radio personalities who have passed through the Pittsburgh market in 85 years of radio, few make an impact, Antill says. \"The Valley has in Bob Livorio at least one of a handful of radio legends that shaped the way we grew up listening to the radio -- as a companion, a friend.\"\n\nAntill says WISH listeners quickly have accepted Brennan as one of their own, not unlike the way in which her father was embraced.\n\n\"She makes a great companion to their day, playing the kind of music they enjoy and talking about the things that interest them,\" he says.\n\nA natural for medium\n\nAlthough this is Brennan's first full-time job in radio, Antill says Brennan's experience makes her a natural for the medium. \"We all know her from seeing her on TV, every time we turn it on. Cynthia is a personality. Being a radio personality is just another way for her to express her talent,\" he says.\n\nWISH was looking for someone who would mesh with the station's overall female appeal. \"As a bonus for the station, Cynthia is the kind of person we attract as a listener, so it's an easy fit,\" he says.\n\nIt has been an excellent fit, Renda Jr. says. \"We were looking for Cynthia. We were really looking for someone who would be an excellent host and who could balance being both a good personality and present the music at the same time. That can be difficult,\" he says.\n\nRenda says the station initially was drawn to Brennan's voice. \"She has a beautiful voice. After we got to know her, we found there is a wonderful personality behind the voice.\"\n\nLike many of her listeners, Brennan is a working mother and wife.\n\nHer approach is to share as much of herself as possible, and to be genuine with listeners, Brennan says.\n\n\"I have days, just like everyone else, whether it's a crazy commute on Route 28, or there was sad news on a local or national level. If I were constantly up and over-the-top happy, it would not be natural. I have to be who I am,\" she says.\n\nAware that her shift occurs while most people are at work, she says she is thankful that, on most days, she feels upbeat. She does her best to keep listeners interested and, hopefully, inspire them, make them smile or elicit a laugh. \"I also am very well aware that it's the music that is the entree and, hopefully, I'm there as a welcomed side dish.\"\n\nA love of music\n\nShe appreciates that radio provides an outlet for her love of music -- with a deejay father, how could there not be? -- along with an opportunity to develop a connection with listeners. \"Being a people person, and being blessed to get out of the studio for the remotes to look into the eyes of the people you share your day with, makes it all that much more rewarding,\" she says.\n\nChris Shovlin, the station's promotions director, is impressed. \"Working with her for the past year has been a joy. At live, on-location remote broadcasts, the listeners flock to meet her. Inside the station, she has been a ray of sunshine,\" he says.\n\nIt's that personality that made hiring her as spokesperson for Bradley Michaels Furniture Direct an easy decision, owner Michael Shull says. Her commercials are televised almost two dozen times a week on WPXI and WTAE, he says.\n\n\"Her heart is twice as big as she is. She really does have a heart of gold. I call her the perfect professional,\" says Shull, who has worked with Brennan for 10 years. \"I want her face and voice out there doing my commercials. She does a great job. She presents herself so well and is a very knowledgeable and classy person. When you see her on TV, 99 percent of the women at home can associate with her.\"\n\nBrennan's parents, Bob and Barbara Livorio, are proud of their daughter's independent approach to her career.\n\nAlthough it might have been tempting for some to use the family name to gain a foothold in the industry, Brennan says she wanted to see whether she could make it on her own.\n\n\"She has done everything on her own God-given talent,\" says her dad, who plays her show through the speaker system at the Dairy Queen in Harrison, which he owns.\n\nRenda says he was not aware of the Livorio connection until the decision had been made to hire her.\n\n\"The depth of my love and respect for my father is for the dad that he has always been,\" Brennan says. \"He was grateful to God to be doing what he loved to do and so appreciative of the friends and listeners that included him in their lives by sharing memories and very personal stories.\"\n\nThere are moments, Livorio says, chuckling, when he is listening to her show and thinks \"Hey, that's my daughter on the air.\" He can hear the ease in her presentation that he tried to make his hallmark.\n\nHe also recognizes that radio, with its time constraints, is more challenging for an announcer these days. \"And she has more buttons to push than I did,\" he says.Professional connection\n\nOne of the most important observations Brennan made of her dad is that is he never considered himself, or his show, to be \"one ounce above what any other man did for a living.\" It is with that foundation that she and her brothers were raised.\n\n\"Consequently, I am at peace with the realization that my children view my work in that same manner. I want them to see me simply as their mom,\" she says.\n\nStill, Brennan's mom says that she is touched to see the father-daughter professional connection."
