For this reason, the five CBS Owned television stations — Channel 2 in New York, Los An- geles, Chicago; Channel 10 in Philadelphia and Channel 4 in St. Louis — have estab- lished their own Washington News Bureau. To bring the citizens of five major popula- tion centers direct news reports of the latest happenings on the Washington scene which specifically relate to their communities. The Washington News Bureau, with its full-time sight-and-sound facilities ready to capture important news on-the-spot, is the latest example of the CBS Owned television stations' continued pioneering of new ways to expand the dimensions of local television. And thus to provide better, more meaningful service to five major U. S. communities.

Yet, the executive who directs the destiny of one of the leading broadcasting companies supplied one in dis- cussing the industry's standard reference volume: \"I like to caU it my million-dollar treasury of facts,\" he observed, adding: \"I may be a little low in the evalua- tion by a million or two.\" TTE EXPLAINED that if the YEARBOOK were -■--^ nonexistent, the industry would find it necessary to create it. The cost of research and compilation spanning 27 years would soar into seven figures. mHIS MUCH we who work on the YEARBOOK— ^ day in, day out — do know: It is in many respects the distillation of more than two decades of earlier endeavor, not to mention publishing experience. rpHUS, there is no substitute and there never can be -^ one. rpo ALL those whose unstinting efforts are repre- -*- sented in this 27th edition go our deep appreciation and thanks for a job well done. CHAS. A. ALICOATE Editor-in-Chief How to tell all sides of this story in '64... News frequently has a way of happening when and where you least expect it. The question is, how to be everywhere at once. The answer is AP. No matter what it is or where it breaks, you know you'll get it fast, accurate and with complete objectivity when you take it from AP. From Muleshoe to Moscow— from local weather to world news— every AP member boasts the world's biggest, best qualified news staff. Since 1848, this AP quality story has never changed. It just keeps growing stronger and stronger with every new AP member— including over 2500 radio and m ^ television stations who won't settle for less than best. /4i THE ASSOCIATED PRESS — R — AFTRA 651 AGVA 651 AM Commercial Programs, Network, 1963 903 AM STATIONS, U.

Industry profits (before Federal income tax) were j up one-third from 1961 to $355.1 million. ' Broadcast revenues in radio hit a new high — $636.1 million, up 7.7 per cent from 1961. Before-tax profits in radio of $43.5 million showed a very substantial increase i from 1961 (48 percent). The 19 network owned and operated stations and the nation's 3,679 other AM and I AM-FM stations showed a much more favorable profit picture in 1962 than in 1961.

Major advancements in our nation- al program to establish an operable international communications system using space satellites was the most significant development of the year. Of critical importance was the action of the Extraordinary Administrative Radio Conference in Geneva, at which member nations of the International Telecommunication Union jointly rec- ognized the benefits which can flow from such a system, and set aside frequencies essential to the success of the program. In addition, the Communications Satellite Corp., which will own and operate the American portion of the system, Is actively engaged in work- ing out the technological requirements and the international arrangements to establish early interim operation. Con- tinued experiments with Telstar, Relay and Syncom hold forth the promise that space satellites, in the next few years, can provide reliable and eco- nomic communications to supplement radio and cable facilities. In the area of domestic broadcast- ing, we note with particular pleasure the stepped-up activity in educational television. Over 80 educational TV sta- tions were on the air at the year's end and, aided by the Federal grant-in-aid program and the all-channel receiver fiegislation, we anticipate continuing and substantial growth in this service In the year ahead. During the year past the Commis- sion has also examined the question of the amount of time devoted to commercials, has moved to clairfy broadcasters' responsibilities to their local communities in the fair treatment of controversial topics of public im- portance, has imposed a modest filing By E. WILLIAM HENRY Chairman Federal Communications i Commission I fee on most applications to offset, in part, the regulatory expenses of the agency, and has continued its efforts to foster and promte the use of all 82 TV channels. In its continuing effort to make broadcasters live up to their promises and obligations, the Commission re- minded licensees of their responsibili- ties under the 1949 fairness doctrine and explained the applicability of the sponsorship identification of a 1960 law. The magnitude of nonbroadcast ra- dio operations in this country is mani- fested by the fact that the FCC now has more than 1.2 million radio sta- tion licensees who operate over 4 mil- lion transmitters. These stations aid in police and fire protection and other state and local government activities; direct the movement of vehicles on land and water and in the air; assist manufacturing and other business op- erations; speed the delivery of our products and services; summon doctors and ambulances; help conserve our forests; gather and relay news, and perform vital functions to bulwark the national defense. The assassination of President Ken- nedy and its aftermath kept a sorrow- ing nation watching and listening to broadcasts as never before. For more than three days, networks and sta- tions across the country voluntarily abandoned regular programming to give constant coverage of the tragic events, for which they received the highest official and public plaudits. Some of this reporting was relayed to other mourning countries by satellite and the new transpacific cable. 63A Federal Communications Commission HEADQUAIiTERS: NEW POST OFFICE BUILDING, WASHINGTON 25, D.
