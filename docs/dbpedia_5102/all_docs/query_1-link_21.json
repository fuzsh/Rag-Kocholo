We are young and old, each with a different story that brings us to a shared world vision. People and flowers are both powerful species on Earth. Flower Power has organically grown out of the Minnesota landscape, out of public demonstration and opposition to state violence, incarceration, and climate crisis. We are individuals trying to present a more compassionate world; our cut flower installations are like portraits that help us deal with complex and abstract problems of injustice. We dedicate a whole day to paying respect to the injustices served, the hardships suffered, and the joy that persists. It’s a time when we use our art and spend it as a community to change the course of past directions. We are different minds and yet of the same heart. We stand with humanity and the Earth as protectors of land and life.\n\nProject: Flower Power VII\n\nSaturday, August 5, sunrise to sunset\n\nIndian Burial Mounds Regional Park\n\n10 Mounds Boulevard, Saint Paul 55106\n\nOyate Hotanin, a Native-led arts, thought, and social justice organization, presents of Flower Power VII, an annual event aimed at helping us all to remember who we are, to work to eliminate our incarceration state, rescue our planet, and lead a worldwide movement of a billion good relatives, Flower Power centers on the creation of an ephemeral work of art, made from cut flowers.

Through a mixed media practice combining artificial and natural materials together, Baker creates abstracted landscapes that explore vast space, and how we move, see and explore within them. The materials, texture, shapes, and color relationships are guided by Baker's Mandan/Hidatsa culture to explore how identity can relate to innate objects. Baker has had recent solo exhibitions at de boer, Los Angeles, Scottsdale Museum of Contemporary Art, Scottsdale, AZ; Pied-à-terre, San Francisco; Interface Gallery, Oakland; and The Art Museum of Southeast Texas, Beaumont, TX. Recent group exhibitions include Ballroom Marfa, Marfa, TX, Nerman Museum, Kansas City, KS, and Marin MOCA, Marin, CA.

Her sculptural artist books, mixed media work, and textile collages, often incorporate fibers and found materials and reference traditional craft forms. Alisa’s work has been exhibited in internationally, and is housed in private and public collections, including the Smithsonian Institution, the US Library of Congress, and The British Library.\n\nProject: Paper Is People: Decolonizing Global Paper Cultures, co-curated by Tia Blassingame and Stephanie Sauer, offers a new definition of paper within a global and decolonial framework, opening up a conversation around what paper is across cultures today. In the Indigenous and oral cultures represented here, weavings, tapestries, and other handmade substrates act as vessels and embodiments of collective culture and memory. See paper samples and source materials, watch papermaking processes from source to finish, read interviews and watch videos from traditional practitioners, experience how contemporary artists are finding new applications for ancient technologies, and participate in a variety of workshops and talks.

Her work has been shown widely across the country, including a solo exhibition at the Minneapolis Institute of Art in 2020. Her solo exhibition, The Price of Our Clothes, at the Perlman Museum, was included in Hyperallergic’s 2018 Top 20 Exhibitions Across the US (December 20, 2018). Rachel was the recipient of a Fulbright Fellowship to India in 2022 and was awarded an artist residency at MacDowell and the Virginia Center for Creative Arts. Rachel is an inaugural recipient of the Jerome Hill Artist Fellowship, has received four Minnesota State Arts Board grants and a fellowship from the Walker Art Center Open Field. Rachel’s social engagement projects have been presented across the state including two projects commissioned for Northern Spark, a public art festival addressing climate change in Minnesota. Rachel holds an MFA from the University of Minnesota and a BA from the Evergreen State College. She lives in Minneapolis, MN, maintains an active studio practice and is a professor of art at Anoka Ramsey Community College.\n\nLocation: East Side Freedom Library & Weisman Art Museum\n\nProjects: Yoke: Garment Solidarity Pennants seeks to lure viewers in as cheerful, colorful pennants, yet suggest something more sinister as a “yoke” – something used to control animals. This work represents the way garment workers are held captive by international clothing brands responsible for unsafe workplaces and below standard pay, endangering workers’ health and livelihoods. The pennants are made from the yoke of used shirts that have been purchased by the pound at a Goodwill Outlet. These pennants bring attention to the way our clothes contain a range of histories – both those of workers and those of wearers – raising essential questions about how garments are discarded and the impacts of overproduction on the climate. I am an artist with an eye on this core question – how can art contribute to the public’s willingness to rethink existing economic systems? I hope to contribute to larger social movements addressing climate change and garment workers’ rights through expressions of mutual aid and solidarity.\n\nTowards a Common Future: Banners for Solidarity // Banners represent a unique combination of the importance of the hand in the making process, the way textiles contain meaning and their history as symbols of protest and resistance. I made these banners to signify the importance of solidarity with workers around the world who make our clothes. To me, solidarity means to empathize and respect the many struggles for social justice. Garment workers around the world grow and weave fabric, cut and sew this fabric into garments, handling these materials so that we have clothes to wear. My interest in labor rights stems from histories of Jewish activism in the garment industry and my own family history as immigrants and activists.\n\nThese banners are made from organic Kala cotton, a drought-tolerant variety of cotton indigenous to India. The visual vocabulary printed on these banners references a variety of important symbols I have designed. Sewing stitches – which I see as a mark and symbol of human interdependence – point toward the possibility of repair and social change. Two halves of a circle speak to my yearning for coming together and being whole – a visual representation of solidarity. Made to be hung in galleries or carried at marches and protests, these banners were additionally inspired by Labor Day banners made in the early 1900s by the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, which I saw in the archives of Cornell University’s Kheel Center for Labor-Management Documentation & Archives.\n\nStrong Buffalo\n\nStrong Buffalo, Artist • Flower Power VII\n\nFlower Power artists, when you collect all our efforts together, we represent layers and decades of working for truth, goodness, peace, and gentle wisdom.

Many of her books stem from her life on the Minnesota-Canadian border; yet some of her stories have taken her as far away as France, Norway, and Belize.

The tree was selected because it is the only one that can produce four different colors of paper, and is known as a “generous tree” because it can be harvested all year long without causing damage. Once the bark is collected, each art piece takes a few days to make. Julio has taken this art form to a new level. Strips of the paper are braided, twisted and inserted seamlessly into the design. Through his work, Laja also connects with his family’s lineage of art-making, which he learned from his grandmother at ten years old. His family has been making papel amate for more than 200 years, passing the knowledge down through the generations.\n\nLocation: Minnesota Center for Book Arts\n\nProject: Paper Is People: Decolonizing Global Paper Cultures, co-curated by Tia Blassingame and Stephanie Sauer, offers a new definition of paper within a global and decolonial framework, opening up a conversation around what paper is across cultures today.

She has an experienced master’s eye for selecting the best black ash tree to provide the best material for her to create a vast array of baskets, from designed black ash baskets to Summer Strawberry Blossoms. The traditional Anishinabe process of creating a black ash basket from start to finish is an awe-inspiring and learning experience that goes beyond the artistic practice to include discussions in biochemistry, forest management, invasive pest control, traditional language skills, and deep personal memories of family history. Growing up in southwestern Michigan during the 1970s, Church studied the Odawa language from her paternal grandmother and learned black ash basketry from her father, Bill Church, and cousin, John Pigeon. She has since passed her knowledge on to her daughter, Cherish Parrish. She received an associate of fine arts degree from the Institute of American Indian Arts in Santa Fe, New Mexico, and earned a BFA from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Church then realized her personal artistic mission was to bring people together in workshops to harvest the black ash trees, process the logs into splints, and create personally designed baskets while learning patience, commitment, beauty, and pride in the Native tradition and culture. By the early 2000s, it was discovered that the Emerald Ash Borer (EAB), an invasive and voracious black ash tree bug from Asia with no known predators, had arrived in the Michigan region and began to devour black ash trees at an enormous rate, resulting in the near extinction of ash trees in Michigan. Church was alarmed that without black ash trees available to harvest, generations of knowledge, experience, and traditional expressions might be lost. She recognized the necessity of researching and documenting, collecting seeds, and collaborating with national and international agencies in getting the word out about this environmental and cultural disaster. Church’s artistic, activist, mentorship, and tradition bearer journey to advocate for the survival of Native traditions has involved many national and international art programs, exhibitions, and work with government agencies such as tribal and U.S. Forest services. She has been named the Eiteljorg Artist in Residence, received a Native Arts and Cultures Foundation’s National Artist Fellowship, and been a four-time Artist Leadership Program participant of the Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian.\n\nLocation: Minnesota Center for Book Arts\n\nProject: Paper Is People: Decolonizing Global Paper Cultures, co-curated by Tia Blassingame and Stephanie Sauer, offers a new definition of paper within a global and decolonial framework, opening up a conversation around what paper is across cultures today.

My goal as an artist is to channel my creativity, eliciting a more universal interpretation of my work and heritage.”\n\nLocation: The Confluence Gallery at the Minnesota Valley National Wildlife Refuge, 3815 American Blvd. East, Bloomington, MN 55425\n\nJune 16 - August 20\n\nCecilia Cornejo (Sotelo)\n\nCecilia Cornejo (Sotelo), Artist • Threads of Connection and Belonging\n\nCecilia Cornejo (Sotelo) is a Chilean-American documentary filmmaker, artist and educator based in Northfield, Minnesota, the occupied ancestral land of the Wahpekute Band of the Dakota Nation. Locally rooted yet globally minded, her work examines notions of home and the immigrant experience while exploring the traces of historical trauma on people and places. An inaugural recipient of the 2020 McKnight Fellowship for Community-Engaged Artists, Cecilia’s work has received support from the Minnesota State Arts Board, the National Association of Latino Arts and Culture (NALAC), the Jerome Foundation, and the Southeastern Minnesota Arts Council. Her film work has shown nationally and abroad and is currently distributed by Women Make Movies.\n\nProject: Through sound, images, and the written word, Cecilia Cornejo’s collaborative work engages community members to reflect on ideas of home, connection, and belonging. Cornejo has embraced multiple ways of sharing stories. From the high tech—indexed databases, touchscreens, and sound domes—to traditional practices of embroidery, \"Threads of Connection and Belonging\" shares broad perspectives united by one idea: What does it mean to be home? The multiplicity of voices that populate the exhibition have been gathered in Southeastern Minnesota over the past five years through Cornejo’s multiplatform project, \"The Wandering House,\" which features an inviting mobile audio recording studio. “Cecilia has built connections with many people, including and especially those whose stories aren’t always highlighted,” says Artistic Director Stephanie Rogers. “Through her work, the stories collected are given back to the people and places they came from in a framework that invites reflection and discovery.”\n\nLocation: Anderson Center\n\nJoe Davis\n\nJoe Davis, Facilitator of The Role of Faith and Faith Communities in Building Networks of Mutuality with Pilgrim Lutheran Church\n\nTuesday, August 15, 6 – 8 PM, light meal served\n\nPilgrim Lutheran Church, 1935 Saint Clair Ave., Saint Paul, 55105\n\nCome back for the registration link!\n\nCritical Conversations: How do we recognize and build our “networks of mutuality?” are a series of events to gather public audiences to connect in thoughtful reflection and deep engagement with probing questions such as, How are we related?

We are young and old, each with a different story that brings us to a shared world vision. People and flowers are both powerful species on Earth. Flower Power has organically grown out of the Minnesota landscape, out of public demonstration and opposition to state violence, incarceration, and climate crisis. We are individuals trying to present a more compassionate world; our cut flower installations are like portraits that help us deal with complex and abstract problems of injustice. We dedicate a whole day to paying respect to the injustices served, the hardships suffered, and the joy that persists. It’s a time when we use our art and spend it as a community to change the course of past directions. We are different minds and yet of the same heart. We stand with humanity and the Earth as protectors of land and life.\n\nProject: Flower Power VII\n\nSaturday, August 5, sunrise to sunset\n\nIndian Burial Mounds Regional Park\n\n10 Mounds Boulevard, Saint Paul 55106\n\nOyate Hotanin, a Native-led arts, thought, and social justice organization, presents of Flower Power VII, an annual event aimed at helping us all to remember who we are, to work to eliminate our incarceration state, rescue our planet, and lead a worldwide movement of a billion good relatives, Flower Power centers on the creation of an ephemeral work of art, made from cut flowers.

His environmental interventions showcase his love of light shows and unseen infrastructure, while his objects highlight material’s ability to carry content. He has partnered with numerous organizations including the National Park Service, Army Corp of Engineers, District Energy St. Paul, Mississippi Park Connection, Three Rivers Park District, and Public Art Saint Paul. Dysart has received awards from the Jerome Foundation through Franconia Sculpture Park, The Jerome and McKnight foundation through Forecast Public Art, The Knight Foundation, and The Minnesota State Arts Board. Having shown nationally, his work has been in Art in America, Hyperallergic, The Dallas Morning News, Berlin Art Link along with others. Dysart is a City Artist embedded in the city of St. Paul through Public Art Saint Paul collaborating across city departments to create art out of the life-sustaining systems of the city while advising on major city initiatives.\n\nLocation: Upper Landing Park\n\nProject: Aaron Dysart has a tree sculpture called Commune that will be installed at Upper Landing Park along the Mississippi near downtown Saint Paul. Appearing in two horizontal sections--one part the tree roots and stump, the other the trunk and branches—there will be a 50 ft. gap between the two sections. A concave form called an acoustic mirror will cap each end of the trunk and offer magical experiences for conversations. Audience members will be able to communicate across this distance without raising their voices.\n\nHow to Interact with Commune\n\nCommune is a full tree split into two sections--one part the tree roots and stump, the other the trunk and branches. It is presented horizontally on steel support structure with a 40 ft. gap between the two tree sections. From the cut portion of the tree, the form spreads out, terminating in a concave dish, called an “acoustic mirror.” This feature allows audience members to magically communicate from the past of the roots to the future of the branches without raising their voices.\n\nTo communicate across the gap, speak (and listen) about fourteen inches away from the raised dot in the middle of the dish, which is the focal point of the mirror. It helps to speak into the dish and listen with an ear toward the dish. Just like all forms of communication, it takes a little work to find the sweet spot.\n\nMichael Engebretson\n\nMichael Engebretson with Interact Gallery\n\n@Interactgallery\n\nMichael Engebretson's kaleidoscopic drawings, paintings, and sculptures map a future existence beyond Earth, where inhabitants travel through galaxies by spaceship and live on distant moons. An avid autism advocate, Engebretson would like viewers of his work to understand how, as he says, “the autistic mind operates.” He describes the way that his brain works as “just like a cyborg: part human, and part machine,” and he hopes that his work will help people to understand the vitality of neurodiversity. “Minds, minds can coexist,” he says. “and can coexist with other people, with everybody. Isn’t that awesome?”\n\nProject: Mural in the Creative Enterprise Zone for Chroma Zone Mural & Art Festival 2023\n\nDates: September 14, 15 & 16\n\nLocation: Creative Enterprise Zone (CEZ), a district centered on the Raymond-University neighborhood of Saint Paul: Click here for a Map of all the Murals in the CEZ.\n\nVisit Chroma Zone for more event info.\n\nLiz Ensz\n\nLiz Ensz, Artist • Groundwork\n\nLiz Ensz was born in Minnesota to a resourceful family of penny-savers, metal scrappers, and curators of cast-offs. Ensz received a BFA in Fiber from the Maryland Institute College of Art (2005), and an MFA in Fiber and Material Studies from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (2013). With an interdisciplinary approach, their work presents a comparative study of the mass-cultural investment in disposability and the human desire to imagine permanence through emblems, monuments, and commemoration. At the heart of their practice lies a determined material engagement, scavenger impulse, and a sincere hope for the rethinking of the valuation of people, resources, the environment, and living things. Liz Ensz is based in Baltimore, MD.\n\nLocation: Dreamsong\n\nProject: Groundwork, presented by Dreamsong, is a group exhibition that takes terra firma as both subject and medium. A signifier of place, territory, and identity, a wellspring of life-giving nutrients, and a site of conflict over land-based indigenous rights and environmental protection, soil offers a rich prism through which the present may be both imagined and imaged. Through excavating diverse histories in artworks that take the ground as subject and material, the exhibition aims to encourage discussion about its preservation, its meaning, the claims that are made to it, and the sustenance, both spiritual and physical, that we derive from it.\n\nJared Fessler\n\nJared Fessler, Artist • It's the People\n\nJared Fessler has enjoyed photography for as long as he can remember. He took a photography film class back in high school, but photography did not really come back to him until post-secondary education when he was trying to figure out what he was going to do next. Fessler invested in a camera and for fun, just started taking photos of everything but mostly enjoyed photographing people and once his work spread, people started reaching out to him to photograph them. He decided that if he was going to do this, he needed to learn more about his camera and photography. He decided to get his certificate in photography and to this day, Fessler still attends photography workshops and classes.\n\nLocation: Hennepin Theatre District\n\nProject: Hennepin Theatre Trust’s 2023-24 edition of It’s the People features large-scale photo banners along Hennepin Avenue in downtown Minneapolis.

My work is about touch and change. Each piece is formed through an accretion of sand, paper pulp, string, and detritus. I feel them out as I go, letting each piece develop its own internal logic, like my hands are stumbling through an invisible maze. Some contain multitudes of layers, mostly unseen, informing the surface from below. I am an amasser of remnants and broken bits, and likewise my paintings are entrenched with debris. They contain residues from my life. My process is sculptural and regenerative; the excess of one painting often seeps into the next. My love of textiles informs my method of dyeing paper fiber, my use of pattern and repetition, and the woven nature of these compositions.\n\nLocation: Dreamsong\n\nProject: Groundwork, presented by Dreamsong, is a group exhibition that takes terra firma as both subject and medium.

Most often she collaborates long term with individuals and small groups of people. These works focus on personal details to address large systems that are political, psychological and environmental. These works include “Riley and his story” and the “Veterans Book Project,” both offering multi-layered narratives of the U.S.-led wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Haller’s recent work brings her to the eroding wetlands of the Louisiana coast, land that has been in her mixed-race “Creole” family for six generations. This work explores the violence within philosophies of ownership, the social construction of race, and the possibilities of this wetland’s terrain. Monica's work is exhibited in the US and internationally at museums and public spaces including Pompidou, Paris, Leipziger Baumwollspinnerei, Germany, the Minneapolis Institute of Art, Milwaukee Art Museum, along the banks of the Mississippi River and many other sites. She has received fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation, McKnight Foundation, Jerome Foundation, the National Endowment for the Arts funding of the Veterans Book Project among others.

Here, those sounds are engaged by Tia-Simone Gardner, artist and Black feminist scholar; Matt Rahaim, composer and ethnomusicologist; Michi Wiancko and Judd Greenstein, composers and musicians; and Monica Moses Haller, artist. Each person has their own multitude of ways of coming to the river. Some soundtracks are simple sounds, one recording within the water. Other tracks are compositions of layered sounds made by the artists here.\n\nHere, sound is a medium to enter personal, environmental, political, emotional realities. Sound recordings are limited, and they are signifiers. They can offer listeners a subtle, non-visual way to enter deeper into a place, the present, the past, the future, and one’s own imagination.\n\nI started listening because there was a familial distance that the river began to connect. This distance was contemporary and ancestral; and the river contained that over time. I listen to connect to the border relationships and broader systems of which the sounds are a part, of which I am a part. This is one way my ear is bent. How do you listen? What’s your inclination?\n\nThe book, notes for listening, share perceptions of the sounds written by the artists and me in April, 2023. These notes are not fixed; if we wrote them last year, or next month they would change routes, flow differently. By the end of the summer, they will be refuted and changed. We approach listening “as a process rather than a certainty.” 1 An invitation to learn, attune, to know and pay attention.\n\nThe book, “notes for listening” also invites the participant to write what they hear. The blank pages make room for what cannot be contained here and the things that are not named.\n\nWhat do you hear? What do you know? How do you change?\n\n- Monica Moses Haller\n\nHopinka, Sky. “The Centers of Somewhere,” Walker Art Center, Crosscuts, April 16, 2018, https://walkerart.org/magazine/sky-hopinka-op-ed-uncertainty-authority-indigenous-representation.\n\n“I’m beginning to understand how to be a listener, without being a spectator, and knowing that it is a pursuit of process rather than certainty.”\n\nCredits:\n\nSound Compositions\n\nJudd Greenstein\n\nMonica Moses Haller\n\nMatt Rahaim\n\nMichi Wiancko\n\nSound Recordings along the Mississippi\n\nMonica Moses Haller\n\nSebastian Muellauer\n\nSound Processing\n\nPrerna\n\nHarriet Matzdorf\n\nMonica Moses Haller\n\nAudio Production and Mastering\n\nMatt Rahaim\n\nNotes for Listening Text\n\nTia-Simone Gardner\n\nJaysen Hohlen\n\nMonica Moses Haller\n\nMatt Rahaim\n\nText Editing\n\nPatricia Briggs\n\nJaysen Hohlen\n\nPatricia Moses\n\nAngela Tillges\n\nBook Design\n\nMatt Rezac\n\nBox Design\n\nBrendan Barrett\n\nBox Materials\n\nWood from the Hood\n\nProject Manager\n\nJaysen Hohlen\n\nThank you Collaborators\n\nThank you to all collaborators on previous iterations of this project.

She has long used varying genres of photography to examine gender roles and their presentation in history, religion and the media, as she seeks to provide a counterpoint to the mainstream narrative. Whether composing a portrait in an evocative location or in the studio, her artistic practice centers the stories of her subjects as community members. Carl Jung’s archetypes provide her with a framework for looking at the past, as she thinks about symbols and behaviors that have existed throughout time in the unconscious mind of us all. Working in a straight-forward and unromanticized photographic approach underscores the foundation of her work in the realism of contemporary life.\n\nLocation: Hennepin Theatre District\n\nProject: Hennepin Theatre Trust’s 2023-24 edition of It’s the People features large-scale photo banners along Hennepin Avenue in downtown Minneapolis.

Since 2015, she has traveled to faraway and distinct locations to create site-responsive, monumental paper-works. In this nomadic practice, ancestral methods of Chinese paper-making coalesce with painting and monastic rituals. Recent projects map interstitial relationships between exile, landscape and the Chinese Diaspora through cartographic, symbolic, temporal and material languages. Hong is the recipient of a United States Artist Fellowship (2023), a Carnegie Foundation Fellowship at MacDowell (2020), a Helen Frankenthaler Foundation Fellowship at Vermont Studio Center (2019), an Artistic Excellence Fellowship from the Connecticut Office of Arts (2019), and a Creation of New Work Grant from the Edward C.

Informed by a life immersed in radically different landscapes — the desolate Argentine fringes of Patagonia’s Atlantic coast where she was raised, and the fertile Midwest woodlands hugging the great lakes — chance encounters with various materials, natural or man-made, often provide a starting point for her works in sculpture, photography, and video. Drawing from natural substances such as Antarctic kelp, obsidian, and organic matter, Horochowski constructs sculptures and assemblages that emphasize human impermanence within geological deep time. By exploring the intersection of the human and natural worlds, her interdisciplinary practice explores how political upheaval and man-made climate change reshape the temporal construction of memory and meaning. Alexa Horochowski is a dual citizen of Argentina and the United States. Her art practice includes sculpture, photography, and video. Artist residencies at Forest Island Project, Mammoth Lakes, CA (2018), MAM, Chiloé (2017), and CASAPOLI, Coliúmo (2013) significantly impacted her material and geopolitical research into the interrelationship between the environment and humankind. Horochowski holds a Master of Fine Arts from the University of Michigan, a Bachelor of Art in Creative Writing, and a Bachelor of Journalism from the University of Missouri. Her artwork has been exhibited in Minnesota at the Walker Art Center, the Minneapolis Institute of Art, Highpoint Center for Printmaking, the Rochester Art Center; the Nemeth Art Center, and The Soap Factory. She has also exhibited nationally and internationally. Selected fellowships include a Warhol Visual Arts Fund (2022), Efroymson Artist Fellowship (2018), McKnight Visual Artist Fellowships (2019/2014/2003), Artist Initiative Grants (2014/2012), and a Bush Artist Fellowship (2004). Horochowski teaches studio arts at St. Cloud State University.\n\nRead our interview with Alexa Horchowski\n\nLocation: Moon Palace Books & Dreamsong\n\nProjects: Post Tenebras Lux, After Darkness, Light serves as a memorial to all the lives lost to Covid-19 and a beacon awakening us toward healing our more-than-human world. The gold logo on the banner is a modified image of the Eye of Providence, found on the US$1 bill and on the Great Seal of the United States. A rendering of the coronavirus orb with spike proteins takes the place of the eye’s iris and looks back at us. Able to upend global markets and instill fear, novel viruses like the coronavirus also propel us to question the status quo and imagine a future where we tread lightly on this biosphere, we call Earth. The juxtaposition of these images prompts questions about the intertwining of global financial networks and biological networks that link all humanity. The Capitalocene refers to the current geologic epoch in which the capitalist formula of unbridled accumulation has penetrated all aspects of the planet’s biophysical environment, to a degree where the capitalist system’s survival is an existential threat to the survival of humanity. Post Tenebras Lux speculates on a post-human, life-sustaining, ecology of repair.\n\nGroundwork, presented by Dreamsong, is a group exhibition that takes terra firma as both subject and medium. A signifier of place, territory, and identity, a wellspring of life-giving nutrients, and a site of conflict over land-based indigenous rights and environmental protection, soil offers a rich prism through which the present may be both imagined and imaged. Through excavating diverse histories in artworks that take the ground as subject and material, the exhibition aims to encourage discussion about its preservation, its meaning, the claims that are made to it, and the sustenance, both spiritual and physical, that we derive from it.\n\nHOTTEA\n\nHOTTEA, Artist • Kismet\n\nSee HOTTEA's interview\n\nArtist HOTTEA began his work with typography on fences, turning an ordinary everyday object into something designers and artists use each day – the grid. The foundation behind the work of HOTTEA is to use the existing infrastructure and create an artwork or idea that is in harmony within the given space. In addition to adapting to the physical qualities of a space or surface – the artist plays close attention to the movement and life in and around the space. When experiencing the artist’s work – you almost feel as if the piece was designed for you because you are exactly who he was thinking of. When the viewer has a personal connection with a piece of artwork, there is a good chance it will become a lasting memory and remind that person of the space. When artwork is able to create a lasting impression, even after the artwork is gone, the artwork lives on forever within the subconscious of the viewer.\n\nProject: Kismet: A hypothetical force or personified power that determines the course of the future events. After meeting with Toua Xiong, the creator of HmongTown Marketplace, and his family, it felt a lot like kismet. While listening to Toua talk about growing up and how much it impacted the future, I wanted this installation to reflect his family history and the journey they have been on. This installation functions a lot like a timeline in that it depicts a series of events in chronological order via a series of pictograms. The images are rendered in yarn attached to a grid. As you walk underneath the installation, the images change, following the stories and memories shared directly with me from Toua and his family. I hope to capture the spirit and passion behind these individuals to portray a sense of family, love and connection. Even though this is one family's story, they express many concepts and beliefs shared by many which embody the idea of interdependence.\n\nLocation: HmongTown Marketplace\n\nKahlil Robert Irving\n\nKahlil Robert Irving, Artist • Groundwork\n\nKahlil Robert Irving is an artist born in San Diego, California, in 1992, currently living and working in the USA.

We are young and old, each with a different story that brings us to a shared world vision. People and flowers are both powerful species on Earth. Flower Power has organically grown out of the Minnesota landscape, out of public demonstration and opposition to state violence, incarceration, and climate crisis. We are individuals trying to present a more compassionate world; our cut flower installations are like portraits that help us deal with complex and abstract problems of injustice. We dedicate a whole day to paying respect to the injustices served, the hardships suffered, and the joy that persists. It’s a time when we use our art and spend it as a community to change the course of past directions. We are different minds and yet of the same heart. We stand with humanity and the Earth as protectors of land and life.\n\nProject: Flower Power VII\n\nSaturday, August 5, sunrise to sunset\n\nIndian Burial Mounds Regional Park\n\n10 Mounds Boulevard, Saint Paul 55106\n\nOyate Hotanin, a Native-led arts, thought, and social justice organization, presents of Flower Power VII, an annual event aimed at helping us all to remember who we are, to work to eliminate our incarceration state, rescue our planet, and lead a worldwide movement of a billion good relatives, Flower Power centers on the creation of an ephemeral work of art, made from cut flowers.

He integrates actions of sculpture, video, photography and drawing to respond to specific architectural spaces, sites, and their histories. Using relocation, replication, and repetition, he questions the inextricable relationships between body, machine, labor, and home. He disassembles the idea of the permanence of architecture, and introduces a new concept of fluid architecture that he uses to analyze the illusion of stability and draw attention to and challenge the unintended consequences of progress. He acknowledges that the conversations of the everyday hold vast potential for the examination of socio-historical complexities and the transcendental realities of object and body. Through gathering, archiving and restoration as a means of transformation, Larson’s work continues to evoke actions of reverence and renewal.\n\nProject:\n\nThe Residue of Labor is an archival body of work that examines intensive labor through the conduit of an abandoned garment factory in rural Tennessee. As garment labor became predominantly outsourced in the late 90s, work was unceremoniously taken from rural communities and a history of human labor left behind. Through the curation of objects recovered from the factory and objects fabricated in his studio, Larson creates a narrative out of the remains of what was once a booming industrial operation. Individual personhood begins to surface from the details as Larson interrelates the residue of life in the factory.\n\nIn the fall of 2018 with an Artist Guggenheim Fellowship, Chris Larson moved his studio from St. Paul, Minnesota to the factory in Tennessee. Larson worked there for two years, collecting, archiving, and acting in performances that contemplate the ways the architecture and its forgotten objects have taken on the imprint of uncelebrated labor. In his new body of work, Larson engages the abstraction of labor in a place of heavy repetition. The exhibition features sculpture, video, drawing, painting, and photography all made from materials recovered from the factory.\n\nLocation: 425 Wabasha St. N., St Paul, MN 55102\n\nOn view Thursdays 12-6 pm & Saturdays 12-4 pm\n\nUpcoming Events:\n\nArtist Talk and Reception for The Residue of Labor by Chris Larson\n\nThursday, August 17, 6 PM – 8:30 PM\n\nProject Space for The Residue of Labor\n\nFree of charge.\n\nGrace Building\n\n425 Wabasha St. N.\n\nSaint Paul, MN 55102\n\nHear from Chris Larson about his major project, called The Residue of Labor, on view at the Grace Building in downtown Saint Paul. This massive project presents more than 35 artworks that Larson created using the remnants left behind when a Ralph Lauren shirt factory closed in Tennessee. In a display of stunning artistic imagination, Larson has re-worked materials ranging from employee time punch cards, thousands of spindles of thread, doors to bathroom stalls, sewing machines, and other tools of textile production. The well worn materials are both re-presented as art objects and also transformed into new expressions, all still imbued with the presence of the people who worked in the factory, who, by Larson’s estimate, invested a combined total of more than 25 million hours of labor. Experience the tour de force 8-minute video, The Stillness of Labor, that culminates the exhibition.\n\nArtist Talk at 6 PM. Reception runs from 6:30 – 8:30 PM.\n\nChenta Laury\n\nChenta Laury, Artist • Paper Is People: Decolonizing Global Paper Cultures\n\nOriginally from O’ahu, Chenta Laury is a Maui-based artist and educator.
