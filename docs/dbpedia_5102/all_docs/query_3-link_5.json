        "text": "SleepyV\n\nSleepyV - MySpace Image\n\nBen Greenwood, a one-time Frank Cunimondo student, gave us a yell last fall to be on the lookout for SleepyV's EP \"The Storybook.\" At the time, he thought it would be an October release; as often happens, it dragged out a bit. But for fans of acoustic prog music, it's finally done and hits the streets Tuesday.\n\nSleepyV is a South Oakland band formed in 2009. They started performing in early 2010, winning a Pitt Battle of the Bands, and were booked by Manny Theiner into venues like the Thunderbird Cafe, 31st Street Pub, The Shadow Lounge, Belvedere's, The Smiling Moose, Howler's and the Garfield Art Works.\n\nA self described indy-folk-prog group, they've been playing selections from their original repertoire of songs. And this is one Oakland band that eschewed the Decade/Electric Banana-inspired bar rock/punk genre. SleepyV is acoustic and backed by reeds and strings, pop troubadours with a classical sensibility. Heck, their EP is even divided into two movements, and several of their tunes feature the dead stop transition common in symphonic compositions.\n\nIn addition to bassist/vocalist Greenwood, the band features Gene Paul Vercammen on lead vocals/guitar, Derek Krystek behind the kit and on the hand sets, John Manganaro playing trumpet, flutist Dominique Dela Cruz, and Sarah Greenwood on violin. The EP includes clarinet recorded by Tessa Lewis-Whitson and a rap verse thrown down by Joe Kennedy of the 1s and 2s.\n\nThe release party is on Tuesday the 28th at the Frick Fine Arts building in Schenley Plaza, across from The Carnegie Library (Room 125 - doors open at seven, show begins at eight), and it's free with munchies. \"The Storybook\" will be downloadable the same day on a name-your-own-price basis at http://sleepyv.bandcamp.com\n\nGreenwood explains the concept record and its name this way: \"The music on our EP fills the role that illustrations would play in a regular storybook while the lyrics express the thoughts of a protagonist and the demons in his mind. It's almost like a modern version of Prokofiev's 'Peter and the Wolf.'\"\n\nWell, we'll take his word about all that. Old Mon's merrily misspent days have somehow managed to avoid mash ups with Russian composers (well, except for Tchaikovsky. We like things that end with a bang.) But he has run across a lot of singer/songwriters in his day, and if they had the chops to shed their shell, collaborate, and play in front of a band, the result would be SleepyV.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nBob Mack\n\n\"Bob Mack Presents Hanky Panky\" - label shot from The Interrobang magazine.\n\nRobert McConnell, aka Bob Mack, made his living in the music industry the old fashioned way. He played and booked dances, operated a string of hop halls, ran a record shop, owned a label or two, and even had a radio gig back in the day when you could earn your daily bread by serving platters to teens.\n\nFirst and foremost, he was among a select crew of influential dance DJs in the late fifties and sixties who could pack a club with kids and push them to buy the discs they danced to. He spun rockers and grinders, \"race\" records, and all the wild and bluesy music that made our little slice of heaven the home of the celebrated and unique \"Pittsburgh Sound.\"\n\nA record collector turned DJ, Mack told Ed Salamon that he started out by doing \"...local dances, held in schools or small neighborhood halls. In 1958 I saw an opportunity when Pittsburgh deejay Barry Kaye left town, and I took over Kaye's regular Friday night 'record hop' at the Masonic Temple in nearby Washington.\"\n\nHe started building a chain of clubs the next year and burned the turntable at venues he ran like the White Elephant, Tarena, Blue Fox, Teenland, Wildwood Lodge, Bethel Roller Rink, Lebanon Lodge, Sugar Shack, Teen Scene, and other dance halls stretching from Washington to Erie. He later would open adult dance clubs Infiniti, Zodiac and Frontier.\n\nBeside the hot wax, he brought in live acts like Sam & Dave, Donnie Elbert, Smokey, Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Bo Diddley, Little Anthony, Hank Ballard & the Midnighters, the Isley Brothers, the Coasters, the Shirelles, the Drifters and the Five Satins, along with the local performers, who were all drawn to Mack's sold-out teen club circuit.\n\nIn that era, being a radio DJ was not exactly a ticket to joining the 1%. However, for a dance jock, the exposure was priceless. So in 1962, Mack produced a home demo tape for Carnegie's spanking new dawn-to-dusk station WZUM. Owner and station manager Jimmy Psihoulis, a polka player who performed as Jimmy Pol of \"Steeler Fight Song\" fame, popped it in the recorder and quickly put Mack behind a mic.\n\nBob Mack's Wax Museum was a show not unlike Porky's WAMO program, featuring lots of obscure R&B and doo-wop. The Museum took off, featuring \"Mac's Monsters,\" and was one of the most popular shows on local airwaves within a few months. But a programming change led to Mack eventually leaving the station.\n\nWZUM's management wanted to update their image and told Mack to add some contemporary sounds to his oldies format. He protested, but to no avail. His ratings slid, and he resigned in early 1964, to be replaced by Johnny Walker.\n\nBut radio was never Mack's bread-and-butter vocation; he had several irons in the fire. The music entrepreneur kept on spinnin', and ran a couple of small labels, Romac (\"Lonely Heart\" by The Enchantments) and Viscount (\"Comes Love\" by The Skyliners. The label was co-owned by Joe Rock), promoted acts through Atlantis Productions, and operated a record store in town on Smithfield and Liberty, the Tri-State Record Shop.\n\nThe record shop segues into one of Pittsburgh's most famous and murky tales, the \"Hanky Panky\" revival.\n\nThe story goes that Mack found the record as part of a midwest collection he had bought for the shop, sped it up a couple of RPM, which is a common practice for DJs who want to juice up the tempo even today, and broke it on the hops circuit in late 1965.\n\nOther say Bob Livorio of WKPA was the first to play it, with Clark Race and Mad Mike putting in claims. James is no help in piecing together the puzzle, as he was working at a Michigan record store while all the dances (and bootlegging) were going on in Pittsburgh.\n\nBut no matter. If not the first, Mack was still one of the earliest jocks in on the record and promoted Tommy James locally. He booked dates, helped him line up The Raconteurs after seeing them play at Greensburg's Thunderbird Lounge to replace the original broken-up Shondells, and took him to New York where James signed a deal with Morris Levy and Roulette Records. In fact, the Roulette label lists \"Bob Mack Presents\" as part of the credits.\n\nOh, yeah, one more thing about that record store that Mack owned. His shop majordomo was a skinny North Side kid named Michael Metrovich, who used to pick out records for Mack to spin. He became a hop and radio DJ of some local renown, too. Metrovich even replaced Bob Mack's WZUM replacement, Johnny Walker, after a brief stint at WPIT. You might know him better by his stage persona, Mad Mike.\n\nSmall world, Pittsburgh.\n\n(For a comprehensive interview of Mack and his partnership with Mad Mike, click on the PBRTV article written by Ed Salamon.)\n\nThe Enchantments featuring Leroy on Romac Records - 1962\n\n↧\n\nJim Krenn\n\nJimmy Krenn\n\nPittsburgh jock Jimmy Krenn was an institution in local drive time radio as the co-host of the top-rated WDVE-FM morning show. His comedy bits made the approaching work day a little easier to face, and after 24 years behind the mic, Krenn was as recognizable as any DJ in the region.\n\nRaised in the Strip, behind what's now the Heinz History Center, Krenn went to North Catholic where he naturally excelled as class comedian, funny enough that even his teachers appreciated his sass.\n\nPrepping at CCAC and then graduating from IUP in 1983, Krenn traveled the local comedy club circuit through his college years, eventually becoming a featured act on the stages of The Portfolio and The Funny Bone, which he parlayed into a spot on WDVE.\n\nAfter joining the 'DVE Morning Show in 1988, the duo of Krenn and Scott Paulsen topped the age 25 to 54 drive-time demographics through the nineties with their mix of music, skits and impressions. After Paulsen’s departure in 1999, Randy Baumann picked up the slack and the zaniness and laughs kept comin'.\n\nIn fact, Krenn was selected as the Top Entertainer in the City several times by Pittsburgh Magazine. And in 2009, Pittsburgh’s Mayor Luke Ravenstahl declared February 22nd as “Jim Krenn Day.”\n\nThen he vanished from the airwaves in December, and his name disappeared from the station's website. Krenn was yanked from his show, and WDVE offered him a different role as a sort of ambassador without portfolio, contributing on-line material and working promotions. But they made it clear that his on-air days were through. Krenn didn't go for it, and Clear Channel released him from his contract at the end of February.\n\n“I was baffled,” said Krenn. “I have to be the first radio personality to hit his 25 to 54 ratings bonus for being number one and let go in the same week.” No explanation was offered, and none was needed. Clear Channel had a plan, and Krenn wasn't part of it any longer.\n\nPaulsen and local stand-up comedian Bill Crawford joined the remaining morning team of Baumann, Val Porter and Mike Prisuta in January, so the circle remained unbroken. That also belied the rumor of wholesale change to attract younger listeners. WDVE stuck to the old tried-and-true formula when it replaced Krenn.\n\nThere were some negative fan reactions - a web site and Facebook page popped up decrying the decision, and Pittsburgh cowboy crooner Slim Forsythe penned \"One Bird They Won't Set Free Is Jim Krenn.\"\n\nBut it had no affect, and the truth is that the show will probably roll along just as strong as ever with Paulsen and Baumann, who are plenty familiar to the 'DVE morning audience. The fan base seemed more dazed and confused than outraged over the change.\n\nFreed from his contractual gag order, Krenn held a press conference this week where he said all the right things and announced his future plans.\n\nHe's ready to expand his brand. Krenn would like to catch another morning gig in the Pittsburgh market (he has no desire to relocate), but with the time to branch off into pet projects - a return to live comedy and web podcasts/vids, like his on-line 'DVE series \"Jim Krenn Raw.\" His first post-'DVE performance will be on the comedy circuit.\n\nThe stand-up comic (he's performed with Jay Leno, Howie Mandel, Dennis Miller, Jerry Seinfeld, Richard Lewis, Gilbert Gottfried and Tim Allen) will headline \"Jim Krenn aLIVE\" May 26th at 8 p.m. at the Byham Theater, billed as \"a toast to Pittsburgh and its people featuring a collection of friends and guest performers.\"\n\nTickets for the show are $32.50, $35.50 and $52.50 The top-end VIP tickets include a two-hour post-show party and meet-and-greet at the Bossa Nova club in the Strip. Part of the pot will go to Animal Friends and other charities.\n\nKrenn and his wife Hedy are frequent participants in Pittsburgh area charities. In 2009, he received the Life Achievement Award (\"The Golden Hydrant\") from Animal Friends. In fact, his \"Ralph the Cat\" radio character was based on a pet kitty adopted from Animal Friends. He and Hedy have a houseful of dogs and cats roaming their Greentree home, all taken from area shelters.\n\nThe Pittsburgh personality has also been an advocate for Children’s Hospital and the Epilepsy Foundation while raising $1.2 million for those groups and others that include the Toys for Tots program, the Multiple Sclerosis Service Society, and the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation via fundraising events and the sales of 'DVE Morning Show comedy CDs.\n\nWe wish the 52 year old Krenn the best of luck in realizing his dreams. Switching stations isn't an easy thing to pull off, and he'll be competing against his own schtick on WDVE. There's not much of a track record for successfully swapping stations in Pittsburgh, although the original 'DVE comedy man, Jimmy Roach, was axed by the station in 1986, and after stops at Magic 97 and WDSY found a gig with Froggy in 1998 that's still running strong.\n\nJimmy Krenn has a lot of irons in the fire (he also has a marketing degree from IUP as an ace up his sleeve), a good name and a lot of friends in the City. It will be interesting to see what direction his upcoming journey takes. One thing we'll bet on is that he lands on his feet, just as Ralph did so often.\n\n↧\n\nThe Titanic Band\n\nImage from the Titanic Universe.\n\nToday, we're gonna take a little side trek away from Pittsburgh music and commemorate the most legendary gig ever performed, the closing act of Wallace Hartley's little band of musicians who played on while the Titanic sank exactly one hundred years ago.\n\nEveryone knows the fate of the \"unsinkable\" luxury liner and how it met its destiny in the frigid North Atlantic. The story of the band going down with the ship is part and parcel of the Titanic's lore.\n\nHis group was a four piece orchestra. Leader Hartley was a veteran of trans-Atlantic trips, having played prior cruises on the Cunard liners Lusitania and Mauretania. The band's job on the Titanic was to perform at church services, during tea, and after dinner.\n\nThey were also accompanied on the trip by a string and piano trio that performed in the Titanic's upscale Cafe Parisien. The guys weren't making big bucks. In fact, they were hired through an agency and likely earned little more than the equivalent of scale. They did, though, have the perk of sailing as second-class passengers and the prestige of performing during the Titanic's maiden voyage. Little did they know that it would also be her last trip.\n\nOn that fateful April 14th, 1912, they played in an effort to distract and calm the passengers during the disaster until the end. As the too-few lifeboats were being filled, Hartley gathered the musicians at the First Class Lounge around midnight, later moving to the higher and drier Boat Deck as the liner continued to settle into Davy Jones' locker. It was the first time the men had ever played as a group.\n\nAnd it was purely voluntary. Hired through a third party, they were not on the ship's payroll and couldn't be ordered to play by the Titanic's captain or even the White Star's owner, who was on board (and survived). The eight had every right to jump into a lifeboat, if they could find one, like any other passenger. But they all answered Hartley's call for a final encore.\n\nThe impromptu orchestra played waltzes, ragtime, and even requests. Survivors recalled hearing \"Alexander's Ragtime Band\" and \"In The Shadows\" from the band as they left the boat. The musicians' apparent game plan was to play upbeat melodies in an effort to lift the spirits of the passengers.\n\nAnd that they did. Many of those rescued from the Titanic vividly recalled the gallant troupe making music as they left the ship. Even those who went down drew some solace from the octet. One of the last survivors to leave the vessel said that she saw men gathered by the ship's railing, smoking cigarettes and tapping their feet to the band's music.\n\nThe doomed boat gave up the ghost a little after 2 AM and slipped under the waves, as did the members of Hartley's band. All eight members perished. It took two weeks for searchers to find Hartley's body, still dressed in his band uniform under an overcoat, along with his music case and, according to some versions, his violin.\n\n30,000 people turned out for his funeral and procession from Bethel Church to the graveyard. He was laid to rest as \"Nearer Thy God To Thee\" played at the Colne Cemetery. A ten-foot headstone, containing a carved violin at its base, marks his grave.\n\nHis band was remembered, too, by a plaque erected at the Liverpool Philharmonic Hall that survived a fire which destroyed the original building and later, Luftwaffe bombs during the Battle of Britain. There are annual concerts played in their honor along with memorials and dedicated bandstands scattered as far away as Australia. More recently, Steve Turner wrote a book of their final performance called \"The Band That Played On.\"\n\nNot everyone in the industry was quite as moved, according to the Southpoint Visiter. The musicians were employed by the Castle Street agency of CW & FN Black, which held a monopoly on booking band members for passenger ships. The firm became infamous for billing the Titanic's band families for the past due costs of the men’s uniform alterations after their deaths. Even the infamous money-grubber Morris Levy wouldn't stoop to that level.\n\nOne last note: \"Nearer Thy God To Thee\" was reported by the NY papers and some survivors as the last song the band played, and it would have been an appropriate selection for the devout Methodist Hartley. He had even told friends that if he were ever in that dire circumstance, that would be the hymn he'd play.\n\nHowever, a rescued radio operator swore the last tune he heard before the ship went down was \"Autumn,\" which was a hymn or perhaps a reference to the then-popular \"Songe d'Automne.\" We'll never know for sure, and it really doesn't matter much.\n\nWhat is sure is that Wallace Hartley and mates John Woodward, Theo Brailey, Jock Hume, Roger Bricoux, Percy Taylor, Georges Krins and Fred Clarke will be remembered forever as members of the world's most storied band.\n\nFrom the movie \"Titanic\"\n\n↧\n\nAllegheny County Concert Series\n\nJoe Grushecky from Concert Boom\n\nHere's the Allegheny County Concert Series schedule for this summer, featuring Jimmy Beaumont, Joe Grushecky, Mac Martin, Joan Osborne, Lucinda Williams, big bands, local heroes and the PSO, Opera and CLO among its great acts:\n\nSouth Park Amphitheater:\n\nJune 1: Steve Moakler (7:30)\n\nJune 8: Pittsburgh Opera (7:30)\n\nJune 15: Glen Pavone Tribute featuring the Nighthawks (7:30)\n\nJune 22: Eden's Edge (7:30)\n\nJune 29: Delta Spirit (7:30)\n\nJuly 7: Pittsburgh Symphony (8:00)\n\nJuly 13: BNY Mellon Jazz - Smithsonian Jazz Masterworks Ensemble Tribute to Ella Fitzgerald (7:30)\n\nJuly 20: Joe Gruschecky and the House Rockers (7:30)\n\nJuly 27: Lucinda Williams (7:30)\n\nAug. 3: Steel Wheels (7:30)\n\nAug. 10: Trombone Shorty & Orleans Avenue (7:30)\n\nAug. 17: Mike Doughty (7:30)\n\nAug. 24: Duquesne Tamburitzans (7:30)\n\nAug. 31: The Hitmen - Tommy James/Four Seasons original members (7:30)\n\nHartwood Acres Amphitheater\n\nJune 3: Joan Osborne (7:30)\n\nJune 10: Pittsburgh CLO Presents \"Another Gleeful Evening\" (7:30)\n\nJune 17: Jimmy Beaumont & the Skyliners (7:30; Car Show 2-7)\n\nJune 24: Meshell N'Degeocello (7:30)\n\nJuly 8: Pittsburgh Symphony (8:15)\n\nJuly 20-22: Pittsburgh Blues Festival (time TBA, admission)\n\nJuly 29: Toad the Wet Sprocket (7:30)\n\nAug. 5: BNY Mellon Jazz - Spyro Gyra (7:30)\n\nAug. 12: Sharon Jones and the Dap Kings (7:30)\n\nAug. 16: Pittsburgh Ballet (7:30)\n\nAug. 19: Hometown Music Festival with New Shouts, Joy Ike and more (5:00)\n\nAug. 26: Allegheny Music Festival (5:00, $20 per car)\n\nHarrison Hills Park:\n\nJune 30: Mac Martin & the Dixie Travelers (7:00)\n\nSkating Rinks:\n\nJuly 11: Tuesday Night Big Band w/Lori Russo (North Park Rink - 7:30)\n\nJuly 25: Tom Evans Big Band (South Park Rink - 7:30)\n\nAug. 8: Graham Grubb Big Band (North Park Rink - 7:30)\n\nAug. 22: Joe Campus Big Band (South Park Rink - 7:30)\n\nAdmission is free except for the season-ending Allegheny Music Festival and the three day Blues Festival, both at Hartwood Acres.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nTaste of Brookline Festival Next Week\n\nThought I'd pass on a note from my bud Jack Stanizzo:\n\n\"Please join Paul Lowe and I for a night of wonderful food from 10 local restaurants in the Brookline area as we perform at the Taste of Brookline.

Its features - \"The Spotlight Dance,\" \"Rate-A-Record\" (\"I give it an eight, Dick. Good dance beat...\") and \"Top 10 Countdown\" - were copied by local dance shows around the country.\n\nThe Philly guy didn't just push East Coast acts and music, though. He had his finger in Pittsburgh's musical pie, too.\n\nHe had a lot in common with Pittsburgh's radio jocks of that era. Clark appreciated and promoted both \"race\" and rock music before it was cool, pushed local players whenever he could, and loved putting together huge cards for his concert acts\n\nHe wrote in his 1976 \"Rock, Roll & Remember\" autobiography that while a WFIL DJ, he came to the City in 1954 for a short incognito visit to listen and learn from WCAE jock Jay Michael. Clark heard him playing the R&B records of the time, ignored by many stations of that era but de rigueur here, and adapted the sound to his show. Clark, like the Pittsburgh spinners, would be among the pioneers who broke the color barrier in music, according to Pat DiCesare in Scott Mervis' recent Post Gazette article.\n\nHe also helped spark Pittsburgh's popular \"Shower of Stars\" concerts, as DiCesare related to KDKA's Larry Richert. He didn't do as a promoter, but a competitor. Imitation being the most sincere form of flattery, Pittsburgh impresario Tim Tormey put together his local version of Dick Clark's \"Caravan of Stars.\" He even beat out the World's Oldest Teenager for the rights to a Gene Pitney barnstormer.\n\nClark was so impressed that soon thereafter he hired Tormey as his East Coast rep for Clark Productions, then based in LA.\n\nAnd speaking of Caravans, Clark did have a couple of local acts tour with his show, which ran until the late sixties. The initial tour in 1959 snapped up The Skyliners, who headlined his first 66-stop Caravan of Stars and reigned as local heroes in the September concert at the Syria Mosque. Other area acts to perform on Clark's Caravan were Chuck Jackson and Lou Christie.\n\nHis long-running TV show did a little better job of representing the region. Tony Butala (with the Lettermen), Lou Christie, Perry Como, Jill Corey, The Del Vikings, Diamond Reo, Billy Eckstine, The Four Coins, Tommy Hunt (with The Flamingos), The Jaggerz, adopted son Tommy James, Henry Mancini, The Marcels, The Skyliners, The Tempos, Bobby Vinton, The Vogues, Adam Wade and Wild Cherry appeared on ABC during the program's decades-long run.\n\nDoesn't sound like a lot for 33 seasons of TV, but there were a couple of good reasons for that. First, Clark took very good care of his Philly folk in the early years. Then he moved his operations to Los Angeles in 1964, putting quite a bit of distance between himself and the Pittsburgh Sound. And finally, the City scene went dry during the British Invasion, sticking to its jazz fusion, bluesy vocal roots while the charts went electric and Motown.\n\nAll in all, Clark showed a lot more love to Pittsburgh than our current Philadelphia contemporaries, the Flyers, have.\n\n↧\n\nBob Livorio\n\nImage from Fifties Rewind\n\nHow many of you guys remember WKPA in New Kensington, 1150 on your AM dial? They had quite a roster of DJs stacking its on-air roster, with talent like Charlie Apple, Al \"Jazzbeaux\" Collins, Jeff \"The Olde Rocke Shoppe\" Allen, Phil Brooks, Alex Mellon, Sean Israel, Joe Fenn, Ford Shankle, Kelly Pidgeon, Mike Alexander, George Hart, Bill McKibben, Jim Dicesare, Terry McGovern, Jim Gray and their last morning drive guy, Ken Hawk.\n\nBut if you don't have Bob Livorio at the top of that list in bold red capital letters, shame on you.\n\nThe station began in 1940, located at 810 Fifth Avenue in downtown New Kensington, with the studio on the top floor of a two-story building known as the Paragon. The owner's Cooper Brothers music store occupied the street level. The building stood until 1994, when it was felled by flames.\n\nThe brothers operated the station under the Allegheny-Kiski Broadcasting Company banner. Like most small town stations, it was heavy on ethnic music, local news and sports at the beginning, but gradually made a move into the Pittsburgh area pop market along with its sister station, WYDD FM.\n\nNow those jocks in the lead paragraph could spin some discs, but the undisputed leader of the WKPA pack and the Allegheny Valley teen club scene was the soft spoken Bob Livorio. He had picked up the turntable bug while in the service, and in 1957 or so landed a gig at his hometown station. Livorio would broadcast from WKPA's Fifth Avenue studio for the next 36 years.\n\nThe station started him off in the 3-8 PM slot, but he quickly claimed the Saturday morning position for his request show. Livorio was one of the groundbreaking Pittsburgh DJs who played \"race\" (R&B and doo-wop) music, though not as exclusively as Porky.\n\nWhile he'd pop in a rocker or two like \"Psycho\" by the Sonics or \"Surfer Joe\"/\"Wipeout\" by the Surfaris (after all, he was a dance jock, too), he was best known for spinning ballads, airing the grinders \"Forever\" by the Marvelettes, \"I Only Have Eyes For You\" by the Flamingos, \"Angel Baby\" by Rosie & the Originals and \"Have I Sinned\" by Donnie Elbert.\n\nLivorio also aired all the more obscure tunes Pittsburghers loved such as \"I Need Your Love\" by the Metallics, \"My Confession Of Love\" by City fav Elbert, \"Bring Back Your Love To Me\" by the local Smoothtones (which he broke), \"Ankle Bracelet\" by the Pyramids and \"Valley High\" by Bill & Doree Post.\n\nNot one for gimmicks or catchphrases, his morning program was simply \"The Bob Livorio Show.\" His calm conversational tone behind the mic was as much of a hit as his records, and he was deluged by kids who wanted a personal dedication during the show.\n\nHe received several hundred written requests every week, and his daughter Cynthia Brennan, a DJ and voice-over/ad spokeswoman, recalled for Rex Rutkoski of the Valley News Dispatch the times they were \"sitting on the living room floor on Friday nights with her brothers, Bob and Frank, and their mother, Barbara, as her dad sorted the letters, and the family discussed them.\" What better way to choose a teen playlist than to have the kids help decide?\n\nLivorio was so popular that when the Allegheny-Kiski Valley area highs had their Kennywood picnic outing scheduled for a Saturday in 1961, the students asked the park to broadcast his show through the PA so they wouldn't miss a Livorio spin while standing in line for a seat on the Racer.\n\nHe was just as popular with the local artists. When the British Invasion landed in Pittsburgh, Livorio stuck to his guns and his format by playing the Skyliners, Vogues, Fenways/Racket Squad and Lou Christie. And like any good jock, he issued a couple of vinyl LPs filled with songs he played on the show, which are now collector rarities.\n\nBut Livorio really hit his stride as a hop DJ in the Valley. Kids set their weekend calendars around his shows. On Friday night, his fans would follow him to Henry's in Tarentum or the Ridge Avenue School, Saturday morning was time to tune into the show, then catch Livorio that night at the YMCA and end the weekend on Sunday night when he jocked at the Birdville Fire Hall in Natrona Heights.\n\nThat intersection of radio and dance DJ also makes Livorio the most likely guy to have broken Tommy James \"Hanky Panky.\" He's often credited with discovering the record, popularizing it at his dances and on his show before the 800 pound gorillas at KQV and KDKA, Chuck Brinkman and Clark Race (who also has dibs as the first jock to spin the 45 from a studio), blew it up on the Pittsburgh airwaves.\n\nBob Mack, who was huge playing Valley dances at the Tarena, also has a claim on it, as does Mad Mike, both of whom wore out the James' wax at hops. Livorio refuses to be drawn into the fray, although Ed Salamon, in his local mother lode of information \"Pittsburgh's Golden Age of Radio,\" mentioned him as a strong candidate to have first played the song. Where else but in Pittsburgh would guys still be trying to straighten out a 45 year old story?\n\n(Ed wrote to let us know that there is still no definitive answer to the \"Hanky Panky\" mystery. He explained that \"Bob Mack/Mad Mike make the claim and Clark Race believed he started it. \"Pittsburgh's Golden Age of Radio\" mentions Livorio's story, which he gave me in writing, but was worded as not to preclude the Mack/Mike and Race's claims, as I believe they each could have been unaware of the others.\" Hey, maybe the Tommy James' hit is a case of spontaneous combustion on Pittsburgh's turntables.)\n\nLivorio survived a pair of new owners and a format change or three at WKPA, but in 1992 the station was sold to a religious programmer, becoming WGBN, and that was the end of the oldies road for the jock. He's still living in New Kensington, and last we heard was the owner of the Dairy Queen on Freeport Road in Natrona Heights, still spinning the sweetest treats in the Valley.\n\n↧\n\nBloomfield's Five Playboys\n\nFive Playboys image from White Doo-Wop Collector\n\nStarting out in Bloomfield in the early fifties, Meraldo \"Tony\" Bertoni and Sam Juliano were sidewalk doo-woppers, singing with a group of local guys known as The Sonny Boys. They never really took off, with their highlight being a performance on the Sunday evening \"Wilkens Amateur Hour,\" and drifted apart.\n\nTony and Sam had the harmony bug, though, and in 1956 they put together another group, The Five Playboys. The members were Tony (1st Tenor), Sam (Bass), Mickey Sands (Lead), Eddie Lucente (2nd Tenor) and Joe Fabry (Baritone).\n\nPromoter and Fee Bee label owner Joe Averbach heard them, and lined up an audition in 1957. They sang \"One Summer Night\" (more on that later) for him, and were signed. He sent them to George Heid’s studio on the Club Floor of the Penn-Sheraton (now Omni William Penn) Hotel in June, where they recorded their first song, \"Pages of My Scrapbook,\" with jazz man Hosea Taylor Sr. providing the alto.\n\nThe song was a hit in the region, and Averbach pressed a second run with a different B Side (\"When We Were Young,\" which also sold well locally) and licensed it to national label Dot Records, an impress he had a working relationship with. The Playboys hit the area hops circuit and even got to perform at a Syria Mosque show.\n\nThe Five Playboys went to Chicago's Universal Studios in February of 1958 to cut their next record, \"Time Will Allow,\" released by Mercury Records. It didn't move, and that would be the group's last slab with a national label.\n\nBut one of their songs did have a pretty good run. The story goes that Tony and Sam were driving around one day, and heard \"One Summer Night\" on the radio, their song from the original Fee Bee audition the year before. It was a huge hit for the Danleers in 1958, reaching #7 on the Billboard Hot Hundred list.\n\nThe Five Playboys claim, according to one source (Tony's son) that Joe Averbach sold their song without the group knowing. \"One Summer Night\" is credited to the Danleers manager Danny Webb on the record, not the group. No credit, no royalties, just nada. And yah, that's how the business ran back in those days. So instead of launching The Five Playboys, it launched Brooklyn's Danleers.\n\nLater in 1958, Fee Bee Records issued \"Angel Mine,\" with the Del Viking's Chuck Jackson signing the falsetto. In the summer of 1959, \"Mr. Echo\" was released on Averbach's Petite label. That was the last hurrah for The Five Playboys, who called it a career in 1960.\n\nDiscography:\n\n1957 - Pages Of My Scrapbook b/w Love Me Right (Fee Bee 213)\n\n1957 - Pages Of My Scrapbook b/w When We Were Young (Fee Bee 213/Dot 15605)\n\n1958 - Why Be A Fool b/w Time Will Allow (Mercury 71269)\n\n1958 - Angel Mine b/w She's My Baby (Fee Bee 232)\n\n1959 - Mr. Echo b/w She's My Baby (Petites 504)\n\n1959? - Never Let Her Go b/w Spring Is Here (Fee Bee - unreleased)\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nJon Rinaldo & Joker Productions\n\nJon Rinaldo\n\nBorn in Syracuse, Jon Rinaldo's family moved to Squirrel Hill in late 1977, and a few years later he attended Allderdice High. In 1985, the Rinaldos moved once again, to Mt. Lebanon and a new high school for Jon. How does a kid get himself noticed in a new school? Easy enough - find some classmates with an ear and join a band. Jon became the lead singer for a new wave group - think Depeche Mode - called the \"Wallflowers\" (Jakob Dylan, you're welcome).\n\nBeside Rinaldo, the band consisted of Joe Matzzie (Guitar), John Trivelli (Keyboards, Drum Machine), Jim Nix (Keyboards), Ric Nix (Bass) and Glen Fisher (Drums). They did a handful of live gigs and cut a demo. It was just a four song tape, consisting of the tracks \"Walls,\" \"Flowers,\" \"This Time,\" and \"Let The Snow Fall.\" They recorded their tunes at Heart Sound Studios and had the tracks remastered at Air Craft Studios, both of which are now gone.\n\nThen the Wallflowers went their separate ways to school. Rinaldo took his studies to New England College in Henniker, New Hampshire. But unknown to the band at the time, a friend had sent the demo to NYC for the \"Snickers New Music Search,\" a sort of radio-based American Idol program of the era sponsored by a group called Campus Voice.\n\nPushing the tracks \"Walls\" and \"Flowers,\" (kinda copacetic, considering that the band was the Wallflowers) the radio voters pushed the group through the quarterfinals, then to the semis, and eventually the band ended up runner-up in the contest after the final tally. Not too shabby, considering there were originally 10,000 participants.\n\nAfter a couple of A&R guys called following their Big Apple success story (including reps from Elektra, Virgin and A&M), Rinaldo moved back to Pittsburgh. The band reunited briefly in 1988 before breaking up for good when the brass ring eluded their grasp. He eventually graduated from Pitt in 1993 with a BA in Art History, and got his first taste of the industry as a college DJ and promotions director at UP radio station WPTS-FM.\n\nHe and a bud chose Graffiti as their college hangout. The room was a break-out venue that furnished a stage for bands like Hector in Paris and The Affordable Floors while providing a mid-sized club venue for local promoters such as Mike Elko, Jack Tumpson of Next Big Thing and PJ McArdle. Rinaldo though he could do that promoting thing, too.\n\nTony DiNardo, who owned the club, wasn't so sure. He wasn't very receptive to Rinaldo's request to let him book an act or two for Graffiti. Rinaldo kept banging the drum and finally wore down DiNardo for some dates. He worked the phone hard to bring in a couple of bands; his first show featured Peter Case of The Plimsouls.\n\nThat was the genesis of Joker Productions, formed in 1989. One of Rinaldo's friends was watching \"Batman\" and thought Joker would be a good name, not particularly because of the character but because it started with a J and ended with an R, the initials of Jon Rinaldo. His first logo became a dancing joker from a deck of cards before morphing into its familiar black and white trademark.\n\nOver time, Rinaldo went from booking seven shows during his first year to well over 200 annually. He did it the old fashioned way, through countless phone calls, miles of pavement pounding, and building personal relationships with the artists and their managers. Rinaldo also forged working ties with the local print and radio media, a necessity in the days before web-based promotion and distribution were options.\n\nIt wasn't easy. He only booked two national acts that first year, and managed to burn through the $10,000 his grandma had fronted him, rarely netting more than a C-Note or two per show. It took him a couple of years to finally break out to the point where he didn't need a day gig.\n\nBut Rinaldo eventually turned Joker Productions into a Pittsburgh contender, working the local radar beneath the DiCesare-Engler/SFX juggernaut at the club level. He brought the Goo Goo Dolls, 311, The Toasters, Michelle Shocked and other national acts to Graffiti, and served as the club promoter/producer from 1994-96. He also picked up a rep as the \"ska king\" because of the brand of bands he brought into town.\n\nThings were beginning to bottom out in 1996. His business relationship with DiNardo was unraveling as he began to expand to stages other than Graffiti, and the ska wave had crested. Rinaldo needed something different.\n\nAfter talking to hall owner Ron Levick, the someplace different popped up: Club Laga in Oakland. The pair hit it off from the start. Rinaldo said \"We were the same age and had the same vision.\" As for genres, he began to book a mix of emerging and indy college acts, mostly national with some local performers sprinkled among them.\n\nJoker Productions left Graffiti (\"tossed out,\" as Rinaldo recalls) to book at Club Laga in 1997. Acts such as Macy Gray, Wu Tang Clan, Blink 182, Maroon 5, The Roots, Dashboard Confessional, Smashmouth, My Chemical Romance, Taking Back Sunday, George Clinton, Less Than Jake, Death Cab For Cutie, and Chevelle performed at the club. It became one of the city's big time all-age stops on the indy circuit.\n\nThat groove at Lago ended when Levick, without much warning, told Rinaldo in 2004 that he was selling the building. The clubs it housed were creating messy situations with both the police and his insurance people, playing heavily into Levick's decision. The emphasis on all-age cards also figured into the equation. Over-21 shows and their beer sales were any rock club's biggest profit center, and the house couldn't fully tap into that make-or-break revenue stream.\n\nSo Rinaldo bought the defunct Rosebud in the Strip and renamed it The World, after the old New York City club. The World was Rinaldo's stage for a year before the promoter pulled the plug; the story in the Strip then was more centered on the late-night violence rather than the music. But he had other irons in the fire.\n\nClub Café became the Joker hall from 2003-07. He brought in 1,300 acts during that time, booking both national and local performers. Rinaldo also was the prime mover for \"Club Café - The Next Stage In Music\" TV showcase. The series ran from 2005-06 on UPN-TV and Comcast On Demand.\n\nIt wasn't, of course, his only house. He regularly placed acts at the Upstage, 31st Street Pub, Diesel, Thunderbird Cafe and Ches Arena.\n\nHe brought in shows for other venues, too. In 2009, Joker Productions booked outdoor concerts at the Riverplex Amphitheater featuring Neko Case, All Time Low and Gov't Mule. That year, he also promoted a sold out concert with Morrissey at the Carnegie Music Hall, the first Pittsburgh performance by the singer since his days as the frontman for The Smiths in the eighties.\n\nRinaldo also booked groups at Metropol, the Byham Theater and Benedum Center. He figures he put together about 6,000 shows during Joker's 22-year lifespan, igniting quite a bang for the city scene. Rinaldo was selected as one of \"Pittsburgh's Top Fifty Cultural Brokers\" from 2001-04 by the Pittsburgh Post Gazette, and in 2003 ranked as one of the Top 50 Nationwide Concert Promoters (Overall Sales) by industry bible Pollstar Magazine.\n\nFor a club promoter, Rinaldo got noticed. From 2000-2010, at least one of Joker's acts made the Post Gazette's \"Concerts of the Year\" list. Three performers (The Avett Brothers, Macy Gray and the Donnas) cracked the top five, while Erykah Badu was ranked as the top show in 2003. It's not an easy task to consistently lure hot acts when you're going tête-à-tête against arena and amphitheater cards, but Joker and Rinaldo pulled it off.\n\nIn spite of his success, in June 2011, Rinaldo and Joker Productions closed down shop.\n\nThe game had changed over the past two decades, explained the promoter. \"Bands still wanted to play,\" Rinaldo said, \"but now there are no ties. It used to be that bands rarely left their local promoters. Now whoever writes the biggest check gets the acts.\" He even got into the bidding wars, trying to lure acts away from their traditional Pittsburgh backers.\n\nThe new paradigm hurt him a couple of ways. First, it obviously cut down on the promoter's share of the concert take. But he was also hampered as a solo operator, not having the deep pocketed sponsorship support or outside investors of some other promoters who could spread out the financial risks.\n\nThe market was static and also becoming more segmented, with more promoters and venues hustling for a slice of the pie. So pocketbook issues were a big factor. As he told Scott Mervis of the Post-Gazette \"I was bleeding to death.\"\n\nAnd the kicker - well, hey and congrats, Jon. He and his bride Tanya are proud parents of a pair of one-year old boys, Nicholas and Alexander. Now Rinaldo's life is boisterous enough baby-sitting his own clan without grinding 24/7 as part of the industry rat race.\n\nHe's looking to segue into a steady day gig. It's an on-time transition for Jon, who's now 43 and been in the promotion biz since his late teens. And Rinaldo can rest easy on his laurels, knowing that Joker Productions and its run at Graffiti, Club Laga, Club Café and other city venues wrote a lasting chapter in Pittsburgh music history.\n\n↧\n\nBob Schmertz: Banjo Folklorist\n\nBob Schmertzfrom the Ben Avon Area Historical Association\n\nRobert Watson Schmertz was born in Squirrel Hill in 1898, and would become a sort of renaissance artist in the City. He was the grandson of Robert Schmertz, the owner of Schmertz & Company, the Duquesne Glass Works and a director of the Pittsburgh Bank For Savings in the late 1800's. Might not mean much to us now, but back in the nineteenth century, granddad was the real deal.\n\nThe gilded Schmertz family had a mansion in Oakland on Fifth Avenue and Craig Street that stood until 1956. That's when the manor met the wrecking ball, to ultimately be replaced by the University Square Apartments. Our Bob Schmertz entered the world a little more humbly as a resident of 5427 Wilkins Avenue, an East End house he'd never leave.\n\nHe found his musical jones when the clan Schmertz would gather for family orchestras, a sort of inter-generational hootenanny where he would sing and strum the banjo with the kin. The banjo was copacetic; someone left it at the house and young Schmerz, who had never played an instrument, picked it up. Little did he know then where that long-necked, five-string banjo would lead.\n\nSchmertz went to Peabody HS, where he first met his love Mildred, who was destined to become his bride. He then moved on to Carnegie Tech (now CMU), where he was part of its first school of architecture class and co-wrote the Tartan spirit song \"Fight for the Glory of Carnegie.\"\n\nThat led to his bread and butter gig. Schmertz taught as a professor for 35 years in the School of Architecture at Tech and operated a thriving private practice out of the Seventh Avenue Century Building in town, a few short blocks from where his grandpap ran his business.\n\nHe planned St. Michael's of the Valley Church in Rector, Mt. Lebanon Presbyterian Church's Education Building, Morewood Gardens in Oakland, the renovation of Latrobe's Unity Chapel and was part of the Saxonburg Cyclotron design team (it closed in 1969; it was a nuclear lab campus for Carnegie Tech, complete with its own atom-smasher, that was situated at the spot where KDKA once broadcast) among his many projects. He also designed homes for several prominent local families during his career.\n\nSo Schmertz was a first class artist in the business world, drawing up buildings that adorn our cityscape today. Music and architecture are both members of the same artsy family, and he was equally as talented in another creative genre, Americana roots music. His reputation as a composer and folk performer spread by word-of-mouth beyond the city, with many of his tunes based on Pittsburgh's own lore.\n\nBut he hid his light under his hat; it took years for his friends to convince Schmertz to get his music on vinyl. Finally, in 1949 a group of buds tossed in and bought Schmertz some recording time to get his work out of the parlor and on wax. The resulting 78 LP was only pressed 300 times, not much more than a demo, but had a big influence. It traveled well and served to enhance his down-home rep.\n\nPeople in folk circles likened him to a contemporary Stephen Foster, and his earthy lyrics won him the title of \"Troubadour of the Two by Four.\" None other than Pete Seeger recalled that \"Bob Schmertz was a very good songwriter.\"\n\nAnd that Schmertz was. Sometimes derivative in his music, his writing was a brilliant example of the genre. He could rhyme any couplet, keep the words in appropriate dialect and make them flow off a singer's tongue. Telling a simple folk story through song was his forte, and not one easily mastered.\n\nPete Seeger put his money where his mouth was when he recorded \"Monongahela Sal,\" a song Schmertz had written in 1947, on the \"Story Songs\" album from 1961. Here's a few verses from his vintage \"he done her wrong\" song (tune vaguely similar to \"Red River Valley\"):\n\nIt was love, careless love, by the river\n\nIt was love, careless love, by the shore\n\nAnd I'm sure that the good Lord will forgive her\n\nFor she never knew what love was like before.\n\nHe swore that he always would love her\n\nAs they locked through the old Emsworth dam\n\nBut that night, overboard he did shove her\n\nAnd then Moat Stanley took it on the lam.\n\nThen Sal jumped a freight for Rochester\n\nShe swore she would have Moat Stanley's gore\n\nFrom a yard bull who tried to molest her\n\nShe went and took a great big .44.\n\nSo raisin' that big shooting iron\n\nSal pumped six bullets into Moat\n\nAnd when she had finished her firin'\n\nShe'd sure messed up that fancy sporting coat.\n\nNow Sal to the judge said, \"Good Mornin!\"\n\nThe jury foreman said,\" Not Guilty, gal\"\n\nSo let all you pilots take warnin'\n\nDon't mess around Monongahela Sal!\n\nSweet, hey? He did have a softer side to his songs. Burl Ives, Tennessee Ernie Ford, The Statler Brothers and Gary Crosby all recorded versions of \"Noah Found Grace in the Eyes of the Lord.\" Ives was a particular fan of Schmertz, recording his \"Angus MacFergus MacTavish Dundee,\" \"The Lock Tenders Lament,\" and \"Quack Quack Paddle-Oh.\" Local folkies The NewLanders included \"Monongahela Sal\" on their 2003 CD \"Where the Allegheny Flows.\"\n\nBut Seeger is the guy who shined the spotlight on Bob Schmertz. Beside \"Sal,\" he played other Schmertz compositions all around America, and always credited the writer. He wasn't alone; every folkie that came through the City visited and often played alongside Schmertz.\n\nSeeger appeared with the American Wind Symphony in the early sixties, performing from their floating stage \"Point Counterpoint,\" which was moored at Point State Park. He brought Schmertz on stage to join him in singing \"Monongahela Sal\" and several other songs.\n\nBut most of Schmertz's performances were at small stages and often concluded in the wee hours at local homes after the gig. He also collaborated with Chatham College's Viv Richman, who recorded 1959's \"Vivien Richman Sings Folk Songs of Western Pennsylvania,\" a Smithsonian Folkways release.\n\nSchmertz did eventually give up his studio shyness in his later years. He recorded three albums, 1955's \"Robert Schmertz Sings His Songs,\" 1959's \"Sing Oh! the City Oh!: Songs of Early Pittsburgh,\" and 1960's \"Ladies Beware of an Architect: Songs for Architects and Their Girlfriends.\"\n\nHis first real LP, \"RS Sings His Songs,\" was a George Heid Productions disc, assisted by Carnegie Tech. His daughters Gretchen & Mildred, son Jack, and Richman all contributed, and it had a couple of his better known songs, \"Monongahela Sal\" and \"Angus MacFergus MacTavish Dundee,\" included on its thirteen tracks.\n\nThe album \"Songs of Early Pittsburgh,\" is a collection of tunes Schmertz wrote to celebrate Pittsburgh's 200th birthday bash. The songs featured the rock stars of pre-revolutionary Western PA like George Washington, Christopher Gist, General John Forbes and Seneca Queen Aliquippa. Some of its other tracks were \"La Vierge de la Belle Riviere,\" \"Flintlock Finnegan,\" and \"The Prettiest Girl in Pittsburgh Town.\" This LP is the only one of his works to make a transition from wax, reissued as a CD by the Smithsonian Folkways label.\n\nHis final \"Ladies Beware\" was a tongue-in cheek sort of release, and was distributed by the Pittsburgh Architectural Club during its 70th anniversary. It had tunes commemorating Frank Lloyd Wright, IM Pei and Lorenzo Di Medici, along with \"The Doric Column Is Coming Back,\" \"Industrious Carpenter Dan\" and \"Queen Anne's Front\" that played to the whimsy of the blueprint set.\n\nHe also authored \"A Picture Book of Songs and Ballads.\" That's all the body of work that Bob Schmertz, who passed away in 1975, has left behind.\n\nAlas, except for the \"Songs of Early Pittsburgh\" CD, it's quite a chore running down Schmertz's stuff. The few remaining LPs are mostly in hands of collectors who avoid e-Bay and mostly trade tapes back and forth. Other individual tracks are scattered about at digital download sites. There is one collection left that we've found where his wax is stored, at CMU's Ryan Library. Somewhat oddly but fittingly, it's part of the school's architectural archives.\n\nPittsburgh tells a rough and rowdy tale. It spent a long, long time as a beefy, brawling town before the more genteel ed and med folk softened its smoky, steely edges. The area's hard past has been covered by many a historian in books enough to fill a library. But if you really want a feel for our region's roots, you need a troubadour with the same roots, and Bob Schmertz was that man.\n\n↧\n\nChuck Austin: Keeper & Mainstay Of Pittsburgh Jazz History\n\nChuck Austin from Pittsburgh Musicians Union\n\nChuck Austin could play that horn.\n\nA trumpeter who could blow jazz, big band, blues or soul equally sweet, Austin worked with Dakota Staton, Paul Williams, Ruby Younge (in 1953, the trio opened the Hurricane Lounge), Joe Westray (on brass player & later judge Warren Watson's recommendation), The Apollos (with Art Nance, Spider Lindsey, Doc Miller and Horace Parlan), Rogers Humphreys, Jack Purcell, George Gee Orchestra, Balcony Big Band, 'Burgh Big Band and OPEK.\n\nHe also backed some of the biggest names in music. Austin appeared with Lloyd Price on The Ed Sullivan Show (he also toured & recorded with him on the LP \"Personality\" after being hired on Hill trombonist Sam Hurt's word), Count Basie's last concert at the Savoy Ball Room on Centre Avenue in the Hill, Diana Ross at the Civic Arena and Liza Minnelli at Heinz Hall.\n\nAs a member of the Stanley Theater pit band, he played sweet soul music behind headliners like Aretha Franklin, Donna Summer, James Brown and The Temptations. Austin turned down a gig with The Ray Charles Revue in the sixties because he was tired of touring and wanted to stay home with his family.\n\nThat decision may have cost him a chance at the big time. Austin never did get on vinyl as a lead man, hidden in the brass section of bands or as a sideman. He had to hold a day job with his cleaning company to keep his clan fed and weekends free for music. But it paid big dividends for the local scene.\n\nAlways known as a true gentleman among brother players, Austin was a member and mentor of Local 471, the black musicians' union where he met running bud Stanley Turrentine. Not only did he hone his chops while jamming at the hall, but he helped the younger guys on their career road.\n\nAfter the white Local #60 took in #471 in 1966 at the national union's prodding, Austin served as an ex-facto rep to the black players who didn't feel they were getting a very fair shake in the new set-up. Since 2003, he's served officially as a board member of the Pittsburgh Musician's Union 60-147.\n\nThe black union's demise led to Austin's tour de force, The African American Jazz Preservation Society of Pittsburgh, established in 1996 to save the history of jazz, blues and gospel musicians in the City. Austin was one of the founders and long time president.\n\nThe organization produces shows, a newsletter, collaborations with other artistic fields like dance and poetry, education programming, books and A/V presentations. One of the primary tools was an Austin-led effort to tape the oral histories of local jazz greats. They have about 75 completed now, stored at University of Pittsburgh Archives as part of the American Jazz Preservation Society of Pittsburgh Oral History Project.\n\nIn a turnabout-is-fair-play bit of justice, Austin's remembrances were recorded as part of the Smithsonian Jazz and Manchester Craftsman Guild Jazz Oral History Project. A portion of his interview recalling his upbringing is on youtube under \"Chuck Austin Final.\" (see below)\n\nWhile Austin, who began by playing at his hometown Ben Avon Elementary School band, swam in the small Pittsburgh pool (he later moved to the Hill), there's no denying he was a big fish in local waters. He's a member of the Pittsburgh Jazz Society Hall of Fame, was named as a Pittsburgh Jazz Legend by the Manchester Craftsman's Guild, and was honored by The City of Pittsburgh in 2011 when City Council proclaimed Chuck Austin Day.\n\nAustin passed away after a lengthy battle with cancer in the early hours of Saturday at the Aspinwall Veterans Administration hospice at the age of 84. His going away ceremony will be held tomorrow at the Mt. Ararat Baptist Church on Paulson Avenue, where he'll be remembered as a family man and friend, leader, musician and historian.\n\nThere will be one more ceremony next month that he'll be at in spirit.\n\nOn June 23rd, a Pennsylvania historical marker will be dedicated in the Hill on a spot by the now-demolished offices of the African American Musicians Union Local 471. It took two years of toil by the African American Jazz Preservation Society of Pittsburgh to make it happen. And you can bet that one way or another, Chuck Austin will be there.\n\n(Much of the article was written from bits and pieces from various sources across the web, but Steve Twedt's Post Gazette obit in particular provided tons of useful stuff that Old Mon shamelessly, uh, \"borrowed.\")\n\n↧\n\nCity 2012 Concerts In The Parks\n\nMellon Square Concert, image from City of Pittsburgh Citiparks\n\nHey, the county released its list of summer shows.

Hey, ya gotta regatta!\n\nNOMaD - \"American Boy\"\n\n↧\n\nDeuces Wild\n\nDeuces Wild: Flo Cassinelli, Spider Rondinelli, Dan Mastri, Bob Negri\n\nThe Deuces Wild were Pittsburgh's hottest local jazz band in the late forties throughout the fifties and into the early sixties. The roster changed more times than a runway model and the group split into competing bands, but the Deuces always took the stage with the area's top talent laying down the swing.\n\nThe quintet more or less morphed into existence. As far as we can decipher from our jumbled notes, Tommy Noll, a popular City drummer, founded the band, then Reid Jaynes took the reins, followed by Jon Walton and finally Tommy Turk became top dog all within the span of a couple of years.\n\nTrombonist Turk (who recorded with Buddy Rich, Billie Holiday and Ella Fitzgerald) joined the original quartet of pianist Jaynes (who had a double keyboard act with Erroll Garner at Al Mercur's), local drummer Noll, bassist Cliff Hill (who famously plucked the stand-up in the Benny Goodman flick \"One O'Clock Jump\") and tenor sax Walton (who blew with Benny Goodman and Artie Shaw). Bassist Joe Wallace (who also played in the PSO) is often considered an original member too, so it's likely the Deuces' roster was fluid from its inception.\n\nOld Mon speculates that the band's name was taken from Artie Shaw's 1942 hit \"Deuces Wild\" and is credited by some to Dick Brosky. That tale's a coin flip since he wasn't an original member, but replaced Noll early on in the band's tenure. (Walton played with Shaw and helped found the band, so he seems a likelier suspect.) Then again, the phrase is common enough, so roll the dice...it could just as easily been determined during a little penny ante action.\n\nOver the years, the Deuces Wild bandstand was home to a who's who of local jazz greats. Its regular musicians included trombonist Turk, sax players Fiorvante \"Flo\" Cassinelli & Walton, pianists Bobby Negri, Ray Crummie & Jaynes, bassists Danny \"The Fox\" Mastri, Harry Bush, Wallace & Hill, and drummers Arnold \"Spider\" Rondinelli, Carl Peticca, Brosky & Noll.\n\nCassinelli, Crummie, Jaynes, Negri, Rondinelli, Turk and Walton are all members of the Pittsburgh Jazz Society Hall of Fame. That's flexing a lot of jazz muscle for one band.\n\nOther local luminaries either sat in as featured sidemen or were session players for the band. Some of the artists were vocalists Tiny Irwin & Jeanne Baxter, trumpeters Roy Eldridge & Hershey Cohen, pianists Chuck Cochran, Beverly Durso & Dodo Marmarosa, and drummers Art Blakey, Terry McCoy, Bill Price & Rodger Ryan.\n\nThey first played at Lenny Litman's Liberty Avenue Carnival Lounge after the war in the forties before moving on to his Penn Avenue Midway Lounge in 1950, becoming Pittsburgh's can't miss act. Billboard noted that the Deuces had \"built up a fanatical following\" by 1947. After their run in town, the group split into two in 1955 and changed venues (Harold Betters took over their gig at the Midway) but not names.\n\nThe breakup could have been caused by the dreaded \"artistic differences,\" or perhaps by too many players for too few seats, or just maybe the schedule caught up to them. They played Monday through Saturday from 9-2 with Saturday matinees, their sets every hour, 40 minutes on, 20 off, and they were well known for their after-hours jams with the other cats.\n\nWhatever the reason, Tommy Turk's version with Harry Bush, Dick Brosky and Jeanne Baxter headed to the South Hills and settled in at Brentwood's Point View Hotel on Brownsville Road. Flo Cassinelli's Deuces with Bobby Negri, Danny Mastri and Spider Rondinelli played the Hill jazz club circuit while summering at The Cowshed in the Conneaut Lake resort region.\n\nBoth Deuces' outfits co-existed just fine in Pittsburgh's small pond, unlike the bitter battles fought by groups riding today's oldie circuit. They all ran in the same circles and their daily bread was earned through non competitive bookings and not record royalties, eliminating most of the potential backsplash.\n\nIn the 1950s, the Cassinelli Deuces did self-release at least four 45s on their own vanity record label. The first record was released in 1955, and the band wrote the sides with the exception of Harry Jame's swing favorite \"Ultra,\" which they recorded twice. The two slabs of wax we could trace were \"Ultra\" b/w \"Down Home\" and \"Ultra\" b/w \"That’s All That Matters to Me.\" If you know of the others, give us a yell.\n\nBy the early 1960s, the Deuces Wild era had run its course. Turk's move to Vegas in 1959 was one trigger, though he did return home often to play until his death, while Cassinelli and Negri formed their own groups. In June, 1972, they had a final reunion gig during The Pittsburgh Jazz Festival, playing a tribute show for Roy Eldridge.\n\nCouldn't find any band vids, so here's Artie Shaw's \"Deuces Wild.\"\n\n↧\n\nLoendi Club\n\nLoendi Club on Fullerton Street\n\nfrom the Carnegie Museum of ArtTeenie Harris collection\n\nThe music never stopped in the Hill for most of the twentieth century, and one of its famed venues was The Loendi Social and Literary Club. But the Loendi wasn't an organ house or one of the famous \"Black and Tan\" clubs like the Crawford Grill or Hurricane Lounge. In fact, it was so exclusive that you and I probably couldn't get past the doorman.\n\nThe club dates back to August 13, 1897, when it was founded by George Hall, best remembered today as the father of one the City's best athletes, Sellers \"Sell\" Hall. Sell pitched for the Homestead Grays, was a standout in hoops (he played for the Loendi Five, which regularly whipped college teams), football and track, and eventually became a music promoter for black acts.\n\nThe Loendi was named for an East African river that flowed from Lake Nyassa until it joined the Ruvuma River, and was mentioned several times in David Livingstone's (As in \"Dr. Livingstone, I presume?\") 1872 journal.\n\nIt was the Duquesne Club for the black elite. Its membership included Pittsburgh’s African American doctors, profession folk, business owners, entrepreneurs and celebrities. The Loendi offered lectures, music, and sponsored athletic teams beside providing a refuge from the teeming masses and a quiet meeting place for the area's black movers and shakers to do business.\n\nThe Loendi's early presidents were William Maurice Randolph, Esq., George Hall, WH Patterson, William Stanton Esq., Eddie Johnson, Captain CW Posey (Posey Steamboat Company), Samuel Pangburn, Ollie Jones, James Peck, John Henry, John Anderson, Sylvester Jones, William Hance Sr., Eugene Lewis, and Robert Vann (lawyer and Courier editor), all well established luminaries in the City's black community. William Taliaferro, Teeny Harris' uncle and mentor, was a founding member.\n\nThe original building was a converted three-story structure on 83 Fullerton Street (erased by the Civic Arena project, on the same street that former City Councilman and stage actor Sala Udin, then known as Sam Howze, was raised) on the corner of Wylie Avenue, a block below Crawford Avenue. The members bought it in 1902 for $100,000.\n\nIt didn't look very special from the street, but the local kids used to hang around outside just to watch the limos pull up to the nondescript clubhouse. If they could only have seen the inside... It had an atrium, a rosewood piano, artwork by Henry O. Tanner, plush carpets, tapestries on the walls and a library/reading room, along with billiard and card rooms. Its dining room had a steward.\n\nAs a private hall, the Loendi didn't hold many public events. They would hire local bands, never larger than quartets, to play for the members during weekends, for dances or for special events. More often than not, they just brought in a solo pianist. The club never had a bandstand, and as an older building, its rooms weren't particularly spacious. And it was most certainly not a venue for hard bop or Mississippi blues; the musicians played or reworked standards and the classier contemporary pieces, as befit the club's image.\n\nOutside groups with the right connections could rent the building, too. For example, the FROGS (Friendly Rivalry Often Generates Success) society had many members with ties to the Loendi. They held dances there until the Arena project nuked the neighborhood and the club moved. FROG events were front page news for all the local African-American press (they still are), and usually quite a bit livelier than Loendi acts.\n\nWhile they may not have been on the cutting edge, the Loendi could roll out the carpet for the big-time performers, and that's how it earned its rep in the Pittsburgh music scene. An invite to one of their private artist parties was a guarantee for a night to remember. The club featured or honored musicians like Billy Eckstine, Lena Horne, Sarah Vaughn, Count Basie, Jimmie Lunceford, Bennie Moten, Cab Calloway, and Louis Armstrong. High brow or not, the members did enjoy their swing, and sometimes even shared the swag.\n\nAccording to Colter Harpers 2011 dissertation \"The Crossroads of the World,\" here's what they did to celebrate Billy Eckstine (a bit redacted): \"In 1952, the Loendi sponsored a week of events for Pittsburgh vocalist and bandleader Billy Eckstine, who was returning to the city to perform in downtown’s Stanley Theater...The events included the Loendi Formal at the Fort Pitt Hotel honoring Billy Eckstine; open house for Billy at the Loendi Club; teen-age party for Mr. B; Loendi press, radio and TV party at the club, and the big salute to Eckstine at the Famous Door (in East Liberty).” It's a wonder Mr. B got to perform while he was here!\n\nBut like everything else that got in the way of the Civic Arena, the Loendi's days in the Lower Hill were coming to an end. In 1958, they opened a new building at 841 Ledlie Street in the Upper Hill (off Bedford Avenue at the end of Cliff Street), an impressive and modern one story structure. It wasn't the same, though. Membership became easier to come by, and it eventually turned into more of a social club than haven for the elite.\n\nStill, it had its moments. The biggest may have been on April 8, 1967, when 400 people elbowed into the Loendi to celebrate \"Bill Powell Night,\" honoring the career of the WAMO/WILY DJ and Courier columnist. But as time went on, the club was suspected of harboring gambling and other illicit activities, and was sometimes even under police surveillance, who came to regard the Loendi as a party bar by the seventies.\n\nIt soldiered on into the early eighties. The last band we could find to play the club was Jothan Callins and the Sounds of Togetherness, featuring saxman Kenny Powell, and they may have sounded taps on the Loendi era in Pittsburgh music history.\n\n↧\n\nPittsburgh's Silhouettes\n\nFrom The Silhouettes\n\nGeorge Bacasa, Ronnie Thomas and Al Secen were inseparable Lawrenceville buds. They went to high school together, and formed a polka trio during their senior year, practicing in George's basement. In 1953 they auditioned for Uncle Sam, and enlisted as members of the 536th Air Force Band.\n\nIn exchange for a four-year stint, they were stationed at Cape Canaveral, Florida (or maybe nearby Patrick AFB). When on-base, they showed VIPs around the rocket facility. But most of the time, they were out entertaining the troops, doing PR-type tours, performing on radio and TV and for recruitment drives. Their final year saw them recognized with the Roger Award, the Air Force's honor for its most talented airmen.\n\nThey came back home a little more sophisticated musically and morphed into a jazz group, with Bacasa on flute and reeds, Secen on vibes (he played the squeeze box when they were a polka band) and Thomas on bass. They eventually added jazz drummer Lenny Rogers (who went to Duquesne and later taught there) and vocalist Cathy Martin, though they would run through a number of singers over the years.\n\nThe band called itself the Silhouettes, sometimes messing with the minds of vocal fans who expected Bill Horton/John Wilson and the Philly harmonizers of \"Get A Job\" fame. Pittsburgh's Silhouettes were anything but doowoppers.\n\nThey had a funky, bossa-nova sort of sound with a mellow side. The group played the college and jazz circuits, and gigged at local clubs like the Red Door, Casa Di Monzo, Pilot House, Escapades, Encore, the Hilton and the Holiday House, going strong from the late fifties into the early seventies. While their Latin beat was infectious, they're remembered today because the Silhouettes left behind some great vinyl.\n\nThe first single was released on Bacasa's Bye George label (#1000). It was \"St. Thomas,\" a remake of the Sonny Rollins piece, backed with a cover of John Phillip's song \"Monday, Monday,\" released in 1967.\n\nBut their piece de resistance was the Segue release of 1969, their LP \"Conversations With The Silhouettes.\" (SEG-1001) Segue was a local jazz label owned by WRS Labs and run by Basaca and Nathan Davis. (It would later fold when the owners switched from jazz to rock unsuccessfully.) Bacasa produced the imprint's first release, Davis' \"Makatuka,\" and Davis produced the Silhouettes' \"Conversations,\" their one and only album.\n\nThe band added Willy Smith on congas and percussion for the session, and tossed in a little lo-tech electronic trickery while recording. The tracks included on \"Conversations\" are Young Blood, Time To Fall In Love, Norwegian Wood (Lennon/McCartney), Sally's Tomato (Mancini), Question: Why?, Fonky First, Hashi Baba, Conversation, Sesame, What Are You Doing The Rest Of Your Life (Bergman/Bergman/Legrand) and Lunar Invasion, with most of the tracks written by Al Secen.\n\nIt was quite well received critically - Norwegian Wood was especially popular among affectionados - but as often happens, the wax didn't sell at the time though it's worth a small mint on today's collectors' market. Several of the tracks have been downloaded to youtube.com by funk fans, as have the 45s.\n\nThe last single by this group was 1969's \"Oh What A Day,\" an upbeat pop tune sung by Carol Christian and produced by Bill Lawrence for his Canonsburg based Western World label (WWS-5503). The B-Side is \"Red Snow,\" a composition penned by the band. The record companies at the time were trying to get the jazz guys to cross over by leading with a pop side in exchange for the flip being the group's choice. And as it ended up, \"Red Snow\" is the more remembered song.\n\nBacasa and Secens fronted a group called New Horizons into the early-to-mid eighties, playing clubs like Cunimondo's Keyboard in Verona. And that is about where Old Mon's trail runs cold. George Bacasa suffered a heart attack in 1976 and passed on in 1988 while still in his early fifties. Ronnie Thomas met his maker in 1991, while he was in his late fifties. The last we heard, Al Secen is still hanging in there and soaking up the sunshine in Palm Beach.\n\nIf anyone can help us fill in the missing pieces of Pittsburgh's Silhouettes, give us a yell so we can finish the story.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nThe Record Mart\n\nThe birthplace of NRM on Wood Street from Life in Western PA\n\nIn 1937, the record industry was just beginning to sprout, and juke boxes were popping up all over town, spanning malt shops and night clubs that were spinning the music of Tommy Dorsey, Benny Goodman, Count Basie and Bing Crosby. East End brothers Howard and Sam Shapiro were in on the ground floor of the action, servicing the machines.\n\nThen the bulb went on: why not make a buck off the used records they pulled from the music boxes? There was virtually no record sale competition at the time other than variety and department stores, and the cost was little-to-nothing for the second-hand shellac, which the owners considered warehouse clutter.\n\nThat year they opened the tiny Jitterbug Record Mart shop at 424 Wood Street on the corner of Diamond (now Forbes Avenue) and Wood in downtown Pittsburgh. They were backed by their dad Hyman and eventually brought in younger brother Jason, who was still at Peabody High at the time. The store started out selling used 78s: Bluebird, Decca and Vocilion labels sold for a dime/three-for-a-quarter, while Victor and Brunswick discs went two-for-a-quarter.\n\nBusiness took off, and after the store became established, a distributor arranged for them to add new records to their offerings; they got up to 50 cents per disc for them. They gradually eased out the less profitable used discs and added foreign and classical record departments on the second floor to attract Pittsburgh's melting pot.\n\nBy the early forties, Hyman started two more locations in East Liberty and town (he ran the operation while his sons were in the service during WWII with the help of their wives and family) and changed the name from Jitterbug to the National Record Mart. When the boys returned to civilian life, they each had their own store.\n\nDuring the postwar economic boom the business became a door-buster, and the stores began offering both 45s and LPs. They added a key and long-time staffer, Frank Fischer, to the payroll. He was a North Side kid from North Catholic High who started out with NRM by washing windows at the East Ohio Street store in 1951 and left the chain as president in 1994.\n\nBy 1958, they had at least 19 shops in their chain: Six were in town at 234 Forbes Avenue, 701 Smithfield Street, 930 Liberty Avenue, 100 Smithfield Street, 507 Market Street, and 540 Liberty Avenue, back in the day when Pittsburgh's center city didn't roll up the carpet after happy hour.\n\nOthers were at 1723 Murray Avenue (Squirrel Hill), Great Valley Shopping Center (E. McKeesport), 347 Fifth Avenue (New Kensington), McKnight-Siebert Shopping Plaza (North Hills), Banksville Plaza (Banksville), 5927 Penn Avenue (East Liberty), 500 East Ohio Street (North Side), 3715 Forbes Avenue (Oakland), Whitehall Terrace (Brentwood), 2889 West Liberty Avenue (Dormont), Heights Plaza (Natrona Heights), 300 Mt. Lebanon Boulevard (Mt. Lebanon) and on Chestnut Street in Washington.\n\nMore shops were added in quick order in places like McKeesport. NRM also operated a half dozen Gimbels' music departments and managed the music sales at several other general retail outlets. Adapting to the times, many new NRM stores were opened in malls instead of adhering to the old business district/shopping center model, setting up outlets first in the partially enclosed Whitehall Terrace in 1952 and later at Eastland (1963) while adding true mall shops at Northway (1962), South Hills Village, Greengate and Shenango, the last three all in 1965.\n\nAnd they learned how to protect their growing turf. The Shapiros cut back their orders of records from the Columbia, RCA Victor and Capitol labels by nearly half in 1959 to protest their record clubs, which were undercutting NRM's prices. While not exactly sure that one thing led to the other, it was also the year that they began to discount albums at a dollar under suggested retail, approximating record club list prices. It eventually led to a meeting of the minds, peace in the valley and merrily ringing cash registers once again.\n\nEntering the sixties, the National Record Mart chain operated 25 stores, all located in and around Pittsburgh. They were headquartered in their 18,000 square foot Forbes Avenue flagstaff store (it even had listening booths for the customers) by Market Square. It also served as a retail site and storehouse, with Gateway Studios on the third floor.\n\nIn 1978, the offices and distribution facilities moved to 5607 Baum Boulevard - the building is now The Offices at Baum Boulevard, across from the old Day Auto lot - after a seventies record boom fueled by discomania overwhelmed the old downtown warehouse, and then to Carnegie in 1991 to take advantage of the new airport.\n\nThey pumped music throughout the store to help drive sales subliminally, and their sales list was widely distributed to the radio stations. They had their own label, which produced records like Jimmy Pol's \"Pittsburgh Steelers Polka\" and DJ Mike Metrovich's \"Mad Mike's Moldies.\" (Mad Mike worked for NRM in the sixties, after Bob Mack's downtown Tri-State Record shop closed down.)\n\nDuring this period, the chain hired another key North Side guy, Oliver High's George Balicky, as an oldies buyer. He would spend over 30 years with NRM, leaving in 1999 after serving as a senior VP of Marketing and Merchandising.\n\n1964 was the year they entered the ticket sales business with promoter Tim Tormey. It was for a Civic Arena show featuring some Brit mop-tops called the Beatles, selling the tickets out of a cigar box. They were the first local outlet to move tickets outside a venue box office and the first to take mail orders.\n\nIn the sixties it was common to see lines forming outside a store the night before a sale, complete with sleeping bags. No, it didn't start with Black Friday midnight madness - it was a NRM phenomena first. And for years, they handled the duty without a service fee; NRM eventually added one when they realized the ticket crowd didn't often hang around the record store to browse and buy after they paid for their concert passes, starting at a quarter and going up to $1.25 during the Shapiro's tenure.\n\nThe chain expanded big time in the seventies, establishing locations in Roanoke, Buffalo and Chicago to become the first truly national music chain. Up until then, all the company's stores were within a four-hour drive of Pittsburgh, set up regionally like the other larger music outlets. The Shapiros grew NRM to a total of 57 stores by the end of the seventies.\n\nThe hot issue then was hot records. The bootlegging industry, working out of car trunks (always a thriving Pittsburgh underground option, then and today) was claimed to be cutting retail sales by a third. NRM survived that bump nicely, thank you, as did the record pirates.\n\nIn 1978, the Shapiros opened the company's first entertainment superstore in Pittsburgh, Oasis Records and Tapes, adding videos to the record stock and introducing the dollar-per-night movie rental when the going rate in other shops was $3.99. It got its name from its first location in Bloomfield, across from the bridge, when a NRM scout reported back to the office and said the site was \"an oasis\" (and it was for a while, between the '78 closing of the old Bloomfield Bridge and the 1986 opening of the new span.)\n\nThe impetus was a southern outlet called Peaches that was aggressively expanding, taking over old A&P markets and filling them with records sold off wooden pallets, along with vids and merchandise. Peaches moved one store into Bethel Park at 5253 Library Road (Route #88), and that got the Oasis ball rolling.\n\nNRM opened superstores in Bloomfield and McKnight Road, eventually buying the Peaches store in Bethel Park, too. Oasis always had the biggest record selection and the most one-off merchandise like tees, posters, etc. to offer of all the NRM stores because of their size.\n\nShelly Berman, a Columbus adman whose firm now operates as SBC Advertising, undertook a study that was completed in 1978 and determined National Record Mart as a name was outdated and clunky (Records were being replaced by tapes and later CDs, and Mart was associated with big-box stores), but NRM was sleek and sexy, foreshadowing the Kentucky Fried Chicken conversion to KFC in 1991. So the National Record Mart became NRM.\n\nThe company remained a privately held family operation into the eighties, and store expansion was deliberate, usually limited to no more than a half dozen carefully vetted new sites annually. The chain had grown to 75 shops by 1986 with annual sales of $40 million.\n\nThat's when the Shapiro brothers, then in their sixties, decided it was time to retire. By now, they were spending more and more time on near-to-the-heart community projects. Business required sharper pencils and longer hours, too. Mall expansion was becoming increasingly expensive to ramp up as square footage costs shot through the roof and discount retailers like Sam Goody were circling the boat like sharks, engaging in tactical price wars. Still, the brothers knew NRM was in good financial shape.\n\nThey could pass the torch and keep the business bloodlines intact, but with various kids and cousins in the mix, they feared creating a family feud. So they put the business up for bid, and a group headed by Bear-Stearnes' Bill Teitelbaum put together the top offer of $10 million.\n\nThe thirty-something Teitelbaum had little experience in the music industry, and had been unable to cobble together a package for the CBS music library in his first effort to break into the biz. But he still wanted in the door. Teitelbaum felt with the technology of CDs and laser discs on the horizon and some Big Apple marketing innovations that he could lead NRM to the top of the retail music food chain. His plan was to tap into the first wave of savvy music fans as they made the transition from tapes and wax to more modern media.\n\nTeitelbaum had several other irons in the fire in New York and so wasn't a day-to-day presence at HQ. In fact, it took him a couple of years to become a hands-on owner.\n\nHe formed an executive committee of holdover NRM vets to help in the decision making. They were Fischer (President), Balicky (VP Marketing & Advertising), George Tunder (Merchandising director), Lori Winterburn (Operations manager) and newcomer Mary Ann Miller (VP Finance). Jason Shapiro stayed aboard as an adviser. Fischer and Balicky, with the ear of both the Shapiros and Teitelbaum (Fischer in real estate and new locations, Balicky in marketing and strategies), would be the only ones of the committee to make it into the nineties.\n\nHis plans for growing the company included the expansion of NRM stores through the acquisition of other smaller chains, heavy advertising campaigns, personal & knowledgeable service (the staff bought into the concept, and many ended up NRM lifers, from floor help to managers) and the introduction of a new concept store called Waves, which eliminated record sales entirely in favor of CDs and cassettes.\n\nThe new NRM opened the upscale Waves Music, featuring “Tomorrow’s Sights and Sounds Today,” in Columbus in 1987 and eventually thirty shops marched under the banner. Waves later featured its \"Wave Net,\" a computer that accessed the Muze record database and additional info on a company intranet. A decade later, the store was retasked to appeal to adult consumers as the boomers began to gray.\n\nTeitelbaum's NRM had a solid financial return from 1986-88, but the following couple of years were almost his last. Teitelbaum left his New York sanctuary after two years of absentee ownership to visit Pittsburgh for weekly executive meetings beginning in 1989, but the company went tumbling downhill even during his more active watch - or maybe because of his presence; that's a topic of some debate, with good arguments made either way.\n\nThe investors had incurred a heavy debt load from the leveraged purchase, and with the additional cost of its expansion, NRM was approaching a financial abyss. But Teitelbaum neatly sidestepped that approaching freight train. In 1991, facing predictions of bankruptcy, he sold 20 stores to WH Smith's record chain \"The Wall\" for about $12 million, generating enough cash for National Record Mart to go public.\n\nIn June 1993, NRM, trading on the NASDAQ under the symbol NRMI, was infused with a fresh $10 million after its IPO, and that payed down the debt. The company negotiated a $17 million line of credit, and then purchased the Leonard Smith Inc.'s \"Music For You,\" \"One Stop Entertainment Center\" and \"Merle's Record Rack\" shops located in New York and New England, increasing the number of NRM stores to 115. The turnaround was so dramatic that the chain was nominated for the \"Retailer of the Year\" award.\n\nTeitelbaum's expansion blueprint wasn't to enter new markets with NRM's bread-and-butter record stores and butting heads with the locals, but to buy up smaller competitors with an existing reputation, shops and customer base. And he did have some specialized concept projects in mind to target a now segmented customer profile as the market matured beyond kids buying records. Waves was the tip of the iceberg.\n\nNRM launched the Music Oasis in Canton the following year, a membership club featuring more than 30,000 CD titles with “The Coolest Prices in Town.” Its appeal was to cost-conscious customers as a response to the big box retailers. NRM also opened its college-oriented Vibes Music stores (so named from a meeting where an exec noted the idea gave him \"good vibrations\") at Princeton, Penn, Boston U and IUP, eventually serving 15 campuses.\n\nThe company joined forces in a cross-promotional venture with alternative radio station The X (WXDX). In 1994, NRM opened Music X stores in Monroeville Mall and on Forbes Avenue in Oakland near Pitt and CMU to cater to the grunge generation. Music X was a regional shop, mostly mall-based.\n\nThe Record Mart had several other smaller brands in the marketplace, tailored to a narrow customer base. In fact, one of its sales pitches to potential operators was that NRM offered an outlet for every demographic.\n\nNRM even entered into the brave new world of online music starting during the Christmas sales season of 1998 when it launched two web sites: www.wavesmusic.com and www.nrmmusic.com. The Record Mart thought it could outperform pioneer e-tailers like Tower, K-TEL and CDNow, and that the web offered an untapped opportunity to cross promote with the existing shops.\n\nThey offered over 28,000 titles as downloads of current sounds. They sold used and overstocked CDs, taking a percentage of the sale for their cut. NRM even featured World Wrestling Federation products in a mutual back-scratching deal with Titan Sports, jumping the hits and sales from their site by 40%. While forward-looking, the site was too-little, too-late, and never really took off, earning $400,000 in 1999.\n\nIn addition, Teitelbaum started a \"frequent buyer\" discount program, giving regular NRM customers a break on the prices as both a reward and an enticement for brand loyalty. But the storm clouds were beginning to gather.\n\nWhile some in the company felt it was time to retrench, cut stores and find focus, Teitelbaum instead expanded NRM to the West Coast and added eight stores, including four in Hawaii and another in Guam when it bought California's Tempo One Stop Records in 1998. National Record Mart operated 175 stores under its umbrella in 30 states that year. That expansion was funded by borrowed money, and within a very quick time, that debt would become a cash flow game breaker.\n\nNo matter how hard NRM tried to turn the tide, the era of the retail music store was ending, dying from a thousand cuts by the turn of the century. There was an industry-wide drop in record sales as the market flew into a million sub-genres. Discount retailers were selling CDs as a loss leader at prices the record retailers couldn't compete with, and at a volume that gave them favored nation status with the labels.\n\nWalmart became the world's largest music seller for years. It was a boomerang for the business, too, as the big boxes preferred to carry just a hot 100 titles during the \"Top Forty\" heyday. So the labels cranked out wax from a few chart-topping stars, but put developing new acts on the back burner, with the unintended consequence of torching their bridges to future sales. And the discount marts weren't the only retail interlopers.\n\nThere were superstores like Media Play and Best Buy to compete against. Borders and Barnes & Noble found CDs to be a cozy fit with their book and magazine business. Heck, within a handful of years, coffee houses like Starbucks would serve CDs with their lattes. Other entertainment media began to muscle into the leisure marketplace, from cable TV to video games.\n\nThe final straw was piled on by the nascent downloading/streaming sites on the web. Everyone from Napster to Amazon took a bite out of the shops, and as of today, iTunes is the world's largest music retailer. Without major brick-and-mortar overhead or inventory/distribution logistics as headaches, the web took down the music retailers one by one. The overall result was that The Record Mart, like most record chains, was waist deep in red ink.\n\nNRM was hounded by creditors, had too many shops over too wide an area, and lost some of its identity through all its niche stores, trying to be all things to all people. And it wasn't entirely the economy. Teitelbaum held what senior execs called \"blame-storming\" sessions, during which he would try to bully his staff by catching them off guard with loaded or leading questions at the weekly meetings, according to thePittsburgh Business Times.\n\nHe decided not only to add stores but also items like scooters, lava lamps and incense to the sales mix. The internal bone of contention was that NRM's local honchos wanted to consolidate and Teitelbaum wanted to expand. In hindsight, his managers may have been on the right side of that debate. So at a time when senior leadership needed to be on the same page, Teitelbaum and the investors were reading from a different book than the operational staff.\n\nThe turbulent climate of the music industry and within the company itself formed a perfect storm that roared over the retailer. Its stock was delisted in 2000 after dropping to under $1 per share and the company recorded losses of $10,000,000 in 1998-99. NRM went into bankruptcy, and while rumors of mergers, buyouts and white knights were swapped around the water cooler, there would be no cavalry charging down the hill to its rescue. In early 2002, they auctioned off their final assets and shut their doors forever.\n\nNot only was the company shuttered, but its founders were gone, too. Hyman had went to his reward in the sixties, while Sam and Howard died within months of each other in 1998. Jason is the sole Shapiro remaining from the infancy of NRM, living in Santa Monica. But the Shapiros can rest easily with the legacy they left behind.\n\nNational Record Mart stayed true to its roots as a Pittsburgh area company during its entire 1937-2002 life span, even as the first national music chain. NRM was also the first satellite ticket and mail order outlet. It peaked at 178 stores in 30 states with 1,200 full time employees, and was once the fourth largest music retailer in the nation.\n\nPittsburghers didn't go to the music store; they went to The Record Mart, where generations of music collectors flipped through NRM's racks of CDs and records, choosing from rock to rap to Rachmaninov.\n\nRIP, National Record Mart. It was more than a fond memory; NRM was as much a part of Pittsburgh music history as were Mad Mike, The Skyliners, Groovy QV, the White Elephant, Syria Mosque, Civic Arena and all the other icons of the city's glory days as Hittsburgh.\n\nMain National Record Mart outlet by Market Square\n\npicture by rhondamarierose\n\nWe've identified some local store sites, and our incomplete list is below.

The Pittsburgh Musical Society Local 60 was chartered in 1897 to represent the white musicians in the Pittsburgh area.\n\nThe Pittsburgh African American Musicians' Association was started in 1906, and in 1908, the American Federation of Labor granted the group a charter to form Local 471 of the American Federation of Musicians (AFM), also known as the Musicians Protective Union. The locals became \"separate but equal.\"\n\nLocals 60 & 471, as were all locals in the AFM, were charged with the following duties: setting and enforcing scale for members' services, settling beefs between members or members and the venues, and to generally protect their members' professional interests.\n\nThe presidents of Local 471 were elected for a two year term, with no term limits. Sadly, the earliest leaders names have been lost in the mists of time. The first known president was Henry \"Prez\" Jackson, who held office from 1938 to the mid-forties when Stoney Gloster took the reins until 1954. Then Carl Arter held the post until 1958 when Joe Westray became the union's last president, heading the local until the 1965 merger with AFM 60. He then became one of the three reps from 471 to serve on the joint board, along with Carl Arter and Ruby Younge Hardy.\n\nThe unwritten but nevertheless fiercely protected boundary was above Grant Street. Black bands could play at clubs above Grant in the Hill and in parts of the North Side, Homewood and Wilkinsburg.\n\nThe union protected its members by confronting and, if need be, physically yanking performers from the bandstand who weren't dues-paying members to protect the $50 tor $60 per gig the players generally received. And Local 60 watched its clubs like a hawk too, picketing and more whenever a group from 471 or any other outsider infringed on one of their stages.\n\nLocal 471's hall and Musician's Club was located on 1213 Wylie Avenue by Crawford Street. The club had offices and a bar/restaurant on the first floor, with a piano bar and rehearsal space on the second floor.\n\nThe building came complete with a storied musical past. It had originally been the Collins Inn, an early Pittsburgh jazz club where Lois Deppe and His Serenaders started in 1919. Then numbers king Gus Greenlee bought the Collins and renamed it the Paramount Club in 1922.\n\nThe dance hall/speakeasy featured the Paramount Inn Orchestra, proclaimed by the Pittsburgh Courier to be the city's best band. The club was a bit rowdy; it was shut down by the police twice. And both were \"Black and Tan\" clubs, catering to an integrated crowd. Local 471 took over the building in the early-to-mid thirties after Greenlee left to open the Crawford Grill in 1931.\n\nFirst and foremost, it was a hiring hall for black artists. The dressed to the nines musicians used to gather on Wednesday and Thursday on Wylie and Fullerton Streets - better known as \"The Crossroads of the World\" - as a cattle call location for club owners looking to fill a date. Now both the players and the bookers had a place to do business. The hall signed on players for not only concerts and gigs, but placed them in touring bands and shows, too.\n\nNoted card carriers of Local 471 included George Benson, Mary Lou Williams, Erroll Garner, Art Blakey, James \"Blood\" Ulmer, Tommy & Stanley Turrentine, Roy Eldridge, Jimmy Ponder, Billy Strayhorn, Grover Mitchell, Ray Brown and Ahmad Jamal.\n\nIt also included local stalwarts like Leroy Brown, Walt Harper, Harold Betters, Ruby Younge Hardy, Joe Westray, Honey Boy Minor, Roger Humphries and Nelson Harrison, along with hundreds of meat-and-potato musicians. Common Pleas Judge Warren Watson, who was player in his younger days, served for a spell as legal counsel for Local 471.\n\nIt was also a general hang-out for the members, who loafed, shot the breeze, ate, drank, jammed, rehearsed and auditioned in the hall which served as a virtual home away from home. And then there was the Musician's Club.\n\nIts renown as a music venue came about thanks to Prez Jackson, who had the foresight to add a liquor license and associate memberships (earned the same way as in most clubs: a hopeful was vouched for by a member and confirmed by the board, which then issued a card) in 1941, turning the union hall into one of the Hill's most popula"
