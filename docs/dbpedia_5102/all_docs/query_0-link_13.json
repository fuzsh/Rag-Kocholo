It provides several Old and New Testament examples of when hands were laid on for purposes such as blessing, healing, conferring authority, and receiving the Holy Spirit. The laying on of hands was an important part of various aspects of the gospel and showed support, confidence, and conveying of power, though the specific meanings depended on the context. While animal sacrifices no longer occur, the practice of laying on hands has continued in the New Testament church.",
