        "text": "He relied on a brutal, early version of the secret police. He murdered some of his opponents with his own hands. Yet Tsar Ivan the Terrible also united Russia, opened diplomatic relations with England and wrote music. Now the complex royal character is to come to TV screens in a 16-part series, and its director believes Russian audiences are ready for some serious historical drama.\n\nViolent thrillers and reality shows have replaced Communist propaganda on Russian television and, like western viewers, Russians complain that there is little worth watching on television.\n\n\"Unfortunately, Russians don't know their history very well, especially before 1917,\" said director Andrei Eshpai, who is making Ivan Grozny (Ivan the Terrible) for release in 2009. \"History in our cinema was often tendentious and there were few possibilities for doing good historical drama on TV ... Those who don't know their history are doomed to repeat it.\"\n\nIf the contradictions of the Putin era are still far too fresh to absorb, and even Stalin's times too close and painful to examine, then the period of Ivan IV (1530-1584) is distant enough to allow Russians to ponder on their penchant for leaders who crack them into shape.\n\nLittle is known about Ivan IV because contemporary documents were destroyed in fires that swept through the wooden buildings of the period. There is even a theory that Ivan the Terrible was actually three different monarchs, although Eshpai doesn't subscribe to that.\n\n\"There are so many legends and it's hard to get to the real history,\" he said. \"You have to bear in mind the medieval values of the time. These people still thought the world was flat. They may have been living in 'wild Russia' but there was much cruelty in Europe then too.\"\n\nTo prove the point, Eshpai said that Ivan, who persecuted the noble boyars with his oprichniki secret police and poisoned, executed and massacred on a truly terrible scale, nevertheless felt the need to write to the King of France to complain about the \"excessive cruelty\" of the St Bartholomew's Day Massacre of Huguenots in 1572.\n\nFrom the Russian point of view, Ivan's reign began well, as he defeated the Tatars and united the state. St Basil's Cathedral on Red Square was built to commemorate the crushing of the Tatars in 1552, and legend has it that the architect's eyes were put out so that he could not repeat the confection of onion domes elsewhere.\n\nHowever, after the death of his beloved first wife, Anastasia, Ivan descended into megalomania and paranoia. He bit off more than he could chew with attempts to take Orthodox Christianity into western Europe and he caused civil war with his attacks on the boyars.\n\nAfter the great Soviet-era film Ivan the Terrible by Sergei Eisenstein, Eshpai knows he has a hard act to follow. Eisenstein clashed with Stalin over his film but still he portrayed Ivan as a symbol of the state, while Eshpai is trying for a more intimate, human portrait.\n\nThe role of Ivan in youth is being played by Ivan Makarevich. The Russian-born Israeli actor Alexander Demidov plays the adult Ivan. \"Ivan was also thrown from side to side by doubts,\" said Demidov. \"That's why it's so rewarding for me as an actor to play him. That's also why it's so difficult.\""
