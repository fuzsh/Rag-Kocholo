        "text": "Patriarch Filaret of Moscow\n\nNYPL, Slavic and Baltic Division\n\nFrom 1598 to 1613, Russia experienced the aptly named Time of Troubles, a period of famine, peasant rebellion, a succession of tsars occupying the throne, and invasion by Poland and Sweden. In 1613, a zemskii sobor (\"Council of the Land\") was convened to elect a new tsar after the Second National Army had liberated Russia from the Poles and Swedes. The assembly deliberated for six weeks and decided on Mikhail Romanov (r. 1613–45), an innocent and pious sixteen-year-old boy. The Romanovs were the ideal family to begin the next dynasty for a variety of reasons: they were wealthy, decent, and enjoyed popularity among all classes; the head of the clan, Filaret (ca. 1553–1633), was in a Polish prison, which added the aura of a martyr and national hero; and the family was related to the previous dynasty through Anastasia Romanovna (1530–1560), the wife of Ivan IV, \"the Terrible\" (r. 1533–84)."
