        "text": "Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna was the youngest daughter of Nicholas II of Russia. On 17 July 1918, her along with her family were killed in the Ipatiev House in Yekaterinburg, Russia by communist Bolshevik revolutionaries.\n\nDespite her reported death, the burial locations of the royal family were kept secret under communist rule, which lead to many rumors of her survival and imposters claiming to be her. In 1991, the bodies of Nicholas, his wife, Grand Duchess Olga, Grand Duchess Tatiana, and Grand Duchess Maria were discovered, and the bodies of Anastasia and Tsarevich Alexei were discovered in 2007, putting the rumors to rest.\n\nIn 2000, she along with her family were canonized by the Russian Orthodox church as passion-bearers.\n\nAnna Anderson[]\n\nFranziska Schanzkowska was a mentally-ill Polish factory worker who in 1920 attempted suicide in Berlin, Germany. After being rescued by a police officer, she was put into a mental institution. Whilst institutionalized, she told other people in the facility that she was Grand Duchess Tatiana or Anastasia. After she left the asylum, she started going by the name of Anna Tschaikovsky, Anna being short for Anastasia. Many nobility and royalty who personally knew Anastasia met Franziska, and many denied that it was her, despite this many people believed her false story, becoming a media sensation.\n\nIn 1928, the media interest lead her to come to the United States. To avoid the media attention she booked herself under the name of Anna Anderson. Upon the death of the Anastasia's grandmother, Dowager Queen Maria, her 12 closest relatives met at the funeral and released a statement exposing Anna as a fraud.\n\nShe moved to New York and started showing self destructive behavior, including running around the halls with an axe and running on the roof naked, she was deinstitutionalized due to these actions. The following years had her return to Germany from 1931 to 1968, where she moved back to the United States and was married. Despite her husband being wealthy, they had an extreme hoarding problem, living in squalor. Because of this she developed health problems, and moved to a care facility. Only a year after she died from pneumonia."
