        "text": "Unlike most of The Crown’s fifth season, episode six does not take place in the 1990s. Instead, it opens in World War I–era Britain, when the House of Windsor was headed not by Queen Elizabeth but by her grandfather King George V and his wife, Queen Mary.\n\nA letter arrives at the king’s desk from Downing Street. The subject? The tsar and tsarina of Russia who, months earlier, had been overthrown in the Russian Revolution. “The government is willing to send a ship to bring the Romanovs to safety here in England,” the king’s aide tells him. “The prime minister does not wish to do so without your support.” The whole family exchanges wary glances across the table. The episode then cuts to a home, called Ipatiev House, deep within the Russian countryside. An imprisoned Tsar Nicholas and Tsarina Alexandra are woken up by a soldier who tells them they are being moved to a new location. “It’s Cousin George!” Nicholas exclaims to his wife. They could not be more wrong: Minutes later, their entire family is brutally murdered in a basement. The British royal family, as it turns out, refused to help them with safe passage to the United Kingdom.\n\nFast forward to the 1990s, and Queen Elizabeth is preparing to meet Boris Yeltsin, the new president of the Russian Federation. The viewer learns that Elizabeth and Philip are relatives of the Romanovs—and wary of Yeltsin’s decision in the 1970s to demolish Ipatiev House when he was a minor official. When Prince Philip learns that his DNA may help identify the remains of his Russian ancestors, he begins researching the two royal family's relationship, and their roles in each other’s fates.\n\nThe Crown is known for drawing on events from across royal history to bring its present-day narrative to life. But in the case of the relationship between the Windsors and the Romanovs—what’s fiction, and what actually happened?\n\nIt is very much true that the Windsor and the Romanov families are related. Queen Elizabeth’s great-grandmother Queen Alexandra came from Danish royalty. She married King Edward VII of the United Kingdom, whereas her sister Maria married Czar Alexander of Russia. Maria’s son Nicholas was the last ruler of Russia—and also the first cousin of King George V, Elizabeth’s grandfather.\n\nNicholas and George were great friends. In 1909, for example, their families vacationed together on the Isle of Wight for the Cowes Regatta. They wrote letters and telegrams to each other often, referring to each other as “Nicky” and “Georgie.” (“My dearest Georgie, I thank you so much for your kind long letter,” Nicholas wrote in February 1917. And upon Nicholas and his family’s execution by Bolsheviks, George professed profound sorrows in his diary. “It was a foul murder,” he wrote in July 1917. “I was devoted to Nicky, who was the kindest of men, a thorough gentleman, loved his country and his people.” (Despite George’s sentiments, Nicholas had earned the nickname Nicholas the Bloody within Russia for his callous handling of the Khodynka Tragedy.)\n\nYet, despite their close relationship, The Crown is right: George V did indeed deny his cousin and his family asylum in the United Kingdom.\n\nIn The Romanovs: 1613–1918, historian Simon Sebag Montefiore’s 744-page book on the family’s rise and fall, the chaotic final days of the dynasty are outlined. The new provisional Russian government wanted the family out of the country after Nicholas’s abdication, fearful that his allies could rally and restore the monarch. They approved a suggestion by Russia’s foreign minister to send them away.\n\nTheir immediate choice was Britain. In March 1917, the British ambassador to Russia spoke to George V’s private secretary Lord Stanfordham who then shared the plan with Prime Minister David Lloyd George. Not wanting to upset Russia and their new government—their allies during WW I—the idea was tentatively approved. Montefiore found that the British royal family even discussed the Romanovs heading to Balmoral in Scotland.\n\nHowever, George V soon backtracked. He had been receiving angry letters from his subjects, many of whom not only supported the ideals of the Russian Revolution but were opposed to the British monarchy itself. He also became concerned with the realities of having two major imperial families in the United Kingdom. It didn’t help, either, that Alexandra, the tsar’s wife, was German—the very country the United Kingdom was then at war with. “The king has a strong personal friendship for the emperor and would be glad to do anything to help him,” Stanfordham wrote to the British foreign secretary. “But His Majesty cannot help doubting, not only on account of the dangers of the voyage, but on general grounds of expediency, whether it is advisable that the imperial family take up residence in this country.” George asked them to withdraw the offer. The government also grew nervous amid all the controversial sentiment.\n\nMonths later, in November, the Bolsheviks seized power. A Russian civil war began between the Red Army and the White Army. The window for the Romanovs's safe escape had passed.\n\nBy April 1918, the Romanovs were imprisoned at Ipatiev House, the country estate shown in The Crown. In July, they were woken up by the guards and told to evacuate. They packed their bags and gathered all their things, heading to the basement. It was a ruse. Moscow had approved their execution. The soldiers murdered the family in a brutal, disorganized slaughter that took up to 30 minutes for them all to die. Then, they doused the bodies in sulphuric acid and gasoline before lighting them on fire.\n\nSeventy-three years later, after the fall of the Soviet Union, the newly formed Russian Federation government allowed the bodies to be exhumed. As The Crown shows, Prince Philip, who was Tsarina Alexandra’s grandnephew, gave his DNA to help identify the bodies. Thanks to his help, the Romanov’s remains were identified—and then properly buried in 1998 at Saint Petersburg’s Peter and Paul Cathedral."
