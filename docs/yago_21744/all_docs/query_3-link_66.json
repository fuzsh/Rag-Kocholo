        "text": "On July 17, 1918, as the White Army advanced toward Red-held territory around Yekaterinburg in Siberia, 12 armed Bolsheviks ushered a group of 11 exiles into a basement of a merchant’s mansion once known as Ipatiev House, now the House of Special Purpose. The youngest in the party, a sickly 13-year-old named Aleksei, had to be carried by his father, who was known to his family as Nicky, and to me, subsequently, and millions of Soviet people as the “bloody tyrant” Nicholas II.\n\nThe deposed czar was accompanied by his young daughters, Anastasia, Maria, Tatyana and Olga; his wife, Alexandra; and their attendants. The man in charge of the soldiers, Yakov Yurovsky, read quickly off a sheet of paper: “The revolution is dying and you must die with it.” Then the night erupted in gunshots.\n\nThis was neither the end, nor the beginning, of the desperate plight of the Romanovs, the dynasty that had ruled Russia for over 300 years. A few weeks earlier, the czar’s brother, Michael, in whose favor Nicholas had abdicated in March 1917, was shot in another Siberian wood. The day after, Nicky’s sister-in-law, Elizabeth, an abbess; his cousin Sergei; and his nephews Ivan, Constantine, Vladimir and Igor were beaten and thrown down a half-flooded mine shaft in Alapayevsk, near Yekaterinburg. From the bottom of the shaft, some 60 feet down, those who survived the fall unnerved their Bolshevik guards by singing Orthodox prayers, until the soldiers tossed grenades after them. But autopsies later revealed that some of the Romanovs had taken days to die.\n\nThe last group execution of Romanovs took place in 1919, in Peter and Paul Fortress in Petrograd, where, after months of imprisonment, the czar’s cousins Nicholas, Dmitri and George, and his uncle Paul were lined up at the edge of a mass grave. Scores of foreign and Russian dignitaries had pleaded with the Bolshevik government for their release. Rejecting one such petition, submitted by the writer Maxim Gorky on behalf of Grand Duke Nicholas Mikhailovich, the chairman of the Imperial Russian Historical Society, Vladimir Lenin said, “The revolution does not need historians.”\n\nIt is estimated that by 1920, of the 53 Romanovs living at the time of the Bolsheviks’ seizure of power in October 1917, only 35 remained alive. Those who could fled Russia by whatever means possible, on foot and by boat. About a dozen Romanovs, including Nicholas’s mother, Maria Feodorovna; his sister Xenia; and her husband, Alexandr, were evacuated from their Crimean estate by warships sent by their royal relative, George V of England. In Europe, they joined thousands of Russian émigrés driven out of their land by the Bolshevik terror. Stateless, largely destitute and shellshocked, the Romanovs had to learn to live without the country whose stewardship had been their duty for three centuries — and mourn those left behind.\n\nThat the survivors could not bury their dead made their situation harder to bear. Of all the murdered Romanovs, only one had been interred — Nicholas’s cousin Dimitry, his corpse rescued from the mass grave by his former adjutant and buried in the yard of a private house. The bodies of those executed in Alapayevsk, though retrieved by royalist forces from the mine pit, were moved farther east, hostages of the changing fortunes of the retreating Whites. Those remains ended up in the Russian cemetery in Beijing, which was demolished in 1957. A layer of asphalt now covers their graves.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
