        "text": "Guys, the story of Anna Anderson, the woman who claimed to be the Grand Duchess Anastasia — murdered along with her family in the Russian Revolution — was pivotal in my pre-teen years. PIVOTAL. I can’t remember if I saw the TV miniseriesÂ Anastasia: The Mystery of Anna (1986)Â first, or read the book that it’s based on (The Riddle ofÂ AnnaÂ Anderson by Peter Kurth), but either way, I consumed them both over and over, hoping fervently that Anna AndersonÂ WAS Anastasia. Because, who doesn’t love a good princess mystery?\n\nI actually rewatched part 1 of this miniseries a year or two ago and got distracted before watching part 2, but have waited to have the time to rewatch the whole thing before reviewing it, because I wanted to do it justice. And I’m so glad I did! What happened to high quality shlock like this? Come on, Hollywood. Bring back your made-for-TV, soapy, historical movies that actually have good budgets (and surprisingly great costumes), good acting, but also men with historically accurate yet unattractive mustaches and who say things like “I’ve wanted you for so long, but I had to let you come to me,” and supporting actors like Susan Lucci. SUCH GOOD SHLOCK.\n\nAnastasia: The Backstory\n\nOk, so if you’re unfamiliar: during the Russian Revolution, after abdicating the throne, Tsar Nicholas II, his wife Alexandra, and their five children were first sent to Siberia in order to keep them from counter-revolutionary forces. Then, all seven members of the family were executed in 1918. They were taken down to a basement, told to line up and wait, then guards came in and shot them all. The girls didn’t die right away because they had hidden so much jewelry in their corsets, so the guards had to bayonet them. The bodies were dismembered, burned with acid, and then thrown down a well at another location and not recovered until 1991 (with two final bodies found in 2007).\n\nAfter the revolution, there would then be multiple people who turned up claiming to be various members of the family who had magically survived, especially youngest daughter Anastasia.\n\nHowever, DNA testing done in 2009 proves that all the bodies of the Romanov family were indeed found in the mass grave, and therefore confirmed that all the members of the royal family died in 1918.\n\nAnna Anderson: The Backstory\n\nAnna Anderson turned up in Berlin in the early 1920s claiming to be Anastasia, and she was the best-known of the Romanov family pretenders. She entered into a legal battle with the remaining members of the family to prove her identity, but after a 40+ year trial, the court ruled it was inconclusive. She lived between Germany and the U.S., married an eccentric doctor in Charlottesville, VA, settled there late in life, and died in 1984.\n\nA 1927 private investigator working on behalf of the Romanov family identified Anna asÂ Franziska Schanzkowska, a Polish factory worker with a history of mental illness … and in 2009, DNA testing proved that to be true.\n\nAnastasia: The TV Miniseries\n\nOf course, back in 1986, none of this DNA stuff existed, so the miniseries takes the romantic and entertaining position that Anna WAS Anastasia. Amy Irving plays Anna, and she’s sympathetic and convincing, and Irving’s performance is really quite moving.\n\nOlivia de Havilland plays the Dowager Empress Maria, Anastasia’s grandmother, and she’s quite regal but also crotchety in the best possible way. She won a Golden Globe and was nominated for an Emmy for this, by the way.\n\nA very young Christian Bale, in his first ever role, plays Tsarevich Alexei:\n\nAnd Rex Harrison as Evil Uncle Cyril, determined to keep Anna out of the family so he can be the head of the family/next tsar in the case of a counter-revolution!\n\nOn the other hand, you get:\n\nA made-up romance with “Prince Erich,” who has a historically accurate but oh-so-cheesy pencil mustache and is constantly cheering Anna along.\n\nSUSAN LUCCI as “Darya” (Princess Xenia Georgievna)!\n\nOMAR SHARIF as Tsar Nicholas II!\n\nAnd a fabulous mishmash of accents! A Russian bolshevik guard has an American accent; Omar Sharif does his Egyptian accent; Susan Lucci is 100% American despite her character being originally Russian; and half the cast goes British, and the other half go American, irrespective of where they’re supposed to be from.\n\nSide note, I’m always mentally nitpicking languages in movies like this. The actors are speaking English, of course, but theoretically they’re “really” speaking various other languages.\n\nAnna refuses to speak Russian; half the movie is set in Germany, so then is she speaking German? And with a Russian accent? She can’t remember how to read and has to relearn … but wouldn’t she have originally learned to read in Russian? So then is she relearning how to read in Russian? Or German? Then she’s off to America and has no problem talking to everyone there, so I guess she’s fluent in English? I swear, I keep a running tally of this stuff while I’m watching things.\n\nOkay, onto…\n\nCostumes in Anastasia\n\nThe costumes were designed by Jane Robinson, who also designedÂ Jennie: Lady Randolph ChurchillÂ (1974),Â Brideshead RevisitedÂ (1981), andÂ A Handful of DustÂ (1988) — and she won a well deserved Emmy for her work. Because shockingly, guys, the costumes in this are fabulous!\n\nAccording to aÂ Washington Post article (“Realistic Costumes and a Question of Royalty, Dec. 7, 1986), Irving had over 40 costume changes. The filmmakers wanted things to look realistic; Robinson said, “A designer can only be creative to a point when dealing with history and historic events. The styles of those times are well-documented, and we wanted a look of reality.” The article goes on to talk about how Robinson used mostly white and pastels for Anna’s wardrobe because as she said, she “wanted the colors to have a slightly dreamy quality to capture the feeling that this lost young woman is not always sure of her identity.”\n\nAbout half of the first episode focuses on the experience of the royal family from the beginning of the revolution until their execution, and those costumes are very nicely done. The other half and all of episode 2, are set in the 1920s. Okay, so the 1920s aren’t my area of expertise, so I can’t tell you if they got a hemline length wrong or whatever. But the costumes are beautiful and look totally appropriate to the 1920s, and actually, are my platonic ideal of what 1920s should be (daywear, anyway) with all the sheer white and ivory dresses.\n\nAre you an Anastasia fan too?"
