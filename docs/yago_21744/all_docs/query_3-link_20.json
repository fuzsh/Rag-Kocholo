        "text": "Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna Romanov is the protagonist of 1997's Anastasia. She is based on the real daughter of Tsar Nicholas II and his wife, Alexandra; the youngest sister of Grand Duchesses Olga, Tatiana and Maria; and the older sister of Tsarevich (Grand Duke Alexei). The real Anastasia was killed in 1918 during the execution of the Romanov family.\n\nPhysical Appearance[]\n\nAs an eight-year-old child, Anastasia possessed flawless fair skin, long flowing auburn hair (naturally curled at the ends), and light blue eyes with naturally groomed eyelashes and thick eyebrows.\n\nTen years later, at eighteen years of age, Anastasia has blossomed into a beautiful and attractive young woman. Despite her obvious increase in height, slimmed-down appearance, hair length, and physical development, her overall appearance remained generally the same.\n\nAnastasia shares some physical resemblance with her father, Nicholas II. Although Anastasia's mother, Alexandra, is seen only briefly throughout the entire film, and we are unable visually compare the two, however, if you watch Alexandra closely she shares a great physical resemblance with the adult Anastasia, her grandmother, the Dowager Empress Marie, states that she inherited the beauty of her mother and the laughter of her father. According to Dimitri and Vladimir, Anastasia inherited Empress Alexandra's chin, Empress Marie's hand, and the seemingly renowned blue eyes of the Romanovs.\n\nIn the beginning, as a teenager, she wore a black Russian cap, a gold tunic, and an olive-green jacket, black pants, and brown boots. Aboard the ship, she wears a blue dress with a bent at white sleeves. For the opera, she wore a navy-blue opera gown, with white opera gloves, a silver choker around her neck, diamond earrings hanging from her ears, and her hair was tied into a bun with a silver hairband. Before she entered the opera theater, she was also seen wearing a teal coat with a white frilly collar on the rims and white frilly cuffs on the sleeves.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nAnastasia will most likely become a Disney Princess since Disney has aquired 20th Century Fox, since it was a box office success anyways, making her the first official Disney Princess to be acquired, as well as the first traditionally animated Disney Princess to not originate from Walt Disney Animation Studios, and the second non-WDAS character to become an official Disney Princess after Merida.\n\nShe will probably become Disney's fourteenth or fifteenth official Disney Princess, thanks to Disney celebrating her film's 25th anniversary.\n\nShe is the only Disney Princess to be a Grand Duchess.\n\nAnastasia's speaking voice is provided by Meg Ryan, while her singing voice is provided by Liz Callaway. As a child, Kirsten Dunst provides her speaking voice, while Lacey Chabert does her singing.\n\nHer kingdom is Russia.\n\nShe and Tiana are the only two Disney Princesses who are from a rather modern environment."
