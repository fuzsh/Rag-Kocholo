        "text": "During the early part of his reign, Ivan the Terrible faces betrayal from the aristocracy and even his closest friends as he seeks to unite the Russian people.\n\nAs Ivan the Terrible attempts to consolidate his power by establishing a personal army, his political rivals, the Russian boyars, plot to assassinate their Tsar.\n\nEisenstein began work on this third Ivan the Terrible film in 1946, but production was halted when the decision was made not to release the second. More than 20 minutes was filmed, but only a fragment lasting less than 5 minutes exists.\n\nAn ordinary Soviet building manager, living in the 20th century, looks like Tsar of All Rus' - Ivan IV the Terrible (1530 - 1584). He'd never known this, until his neighbor created a time machine.\n\nA historical film that tells about two years in the life of Tsar Ivan the Terrible, his relationship with Metropolitan Philip of Moscow and the events of the Oprichnina era.\n\nXVI century. The film depicts the life of Ivan from his earliest years to the last days of his reign.\n\nThe reign of Ivan the Terrible was a time of glory, luxury and cruelty, a time when all concepts were perverted, baseness was called virtue, and betrayal was included in the law.\n\nThe story of Ermak Timofeevich, whose campaign for the Ural mountains served to annex the Siberian lands to the Moscow kingdom, in the second half of the 16th century.\n\nAbout the life of the first printer Ivan Fedorov. Political strife intrudes into the fruitful life of the first printer, aggravating his relationship with Ivan the Terrible.\n\nThe unhappy fate of a serf who devises a flying apparatus, against the background of Czar Ivan IV in Russia's 16th century."
