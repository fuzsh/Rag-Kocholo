        "text": "I have always been haunted by the story of the four Romanov sisters. They were constantly in my head after I visited Ekaterinburg in the summer of 2007 to research my first Romanov book, Ekaterinburg: The Last Days of the Romanovs. Sense of place is very important to me as a writer, and I was particularly gripped by it when I went to Western Siberia. Walking the streets of the city, and more importantly, going out into the Koptyaki Forest where the family’s bodies were dumped after they were murdered in July 1918, left an indelible impression on my mind and my creative imagination. I wanted, with a passion, to tell the story of those four lovely, much photographed but historically neglected sisters.\n\nYou only have to look at any of the illustrated books on the Romanovs to see how incredibly photogenic they were. It is impossible to resist the lure of those touching, and now iconic, images of Olga, Tatiana, Maria and Anastasia in their pretty white lace dresses and large picture hats. They are timeless and seem to represent not just the lost world of old tsarist Russia but also the ruthless and arbitrary brutality of the revolution that destroyed them.\n\nYes, their faces are familiar, but little has been known about the four Romanov sisters beyond the chocolate-box image of them produced for public consumption by the tsarist publicity machine. The many charming and informal pictures that the sisters took of each other – and Anastasia in particular was an avid photographer – show something of the happy and unpretentious personalities behind the public image. But in truth, the Romanov sisters have never been considered as anything more than the pretty set dressing to the much bigger and more dramatic story of their parents and their tragic haemophiliac brother. For they were born into a Russia where sons were essential for the survival of the dynasty and daughters were deemed of little consequence.\n\nIn November 1894, when Princess Alexandra of Hesse married the new tsar, Nicholas II, royalty gossips around the world were all agog. She may have landed the biggest dynastic catch and the richest man in the world, but as far as the Russian public was concerned, Alexandra’s primary duty as Empress of Russia was to produce a son and heir. Instead, the birth of four daughters in quick succession, although a private joy to their doting parents, was a bitter public disappointment that increased with every daughter born: Olga in 1895, Tatiana in 1897, Maria in 1899. The arrival of Anastasia in 1901 was, inevitably, greeted with deep dismay. The continuing lack of a son brought the Russian throne to the brink of a succession crisis and provoked much superstitious talk among the peasantry of a curse on the Romanovs.\n\nLittle attention was therefore paid to the four charming and vivacious young sisters who were growing up at the Alexander Palace at Tsarskoe Selo outside St Petersburg. Indeed, during the 1900s the political climate in Russia became so volatile and the assassination threats against Nicholas II so worrying, that the Imperial Family was increasingly secluded from public view and the press was gagged from saying anything about their domestic life.\n\nAt home the sisters grew up like any other happy, normal girls, prone to the same fights and squabbles and hair pulling (Anastasia in particular being fond of the latter). They might have been cosseted with extravagant gifts from royal relatives and eminent statesman, but their mother – in the tradition of her own mother Alice and her much-loved grandmother Queen Victoria – imposed a rigorous English regime of frugality, hand-me-down clothes, iron bedsteads, plain nursery food and cold baths. The girls were educated in the necessary social graces and spoke French, Russian (among themselves) and English (with their parents), but they were never spoilt. All four enchanted visitors: they were pert, friendly, inquisitive, and clearly devoted to each other.\n\nOrdinary Russians, however, were lucky to catch glimpses of the Romanov sisters in carriage rides around St Petersburg or at increasingly rare official engagements; abroad, the Romanovs as a family were not seen until a brief visit to Cowes on the Isle of Wight in 1909. A steady stream of carefully selected official photographs did nothing to convey the individuality of the imperial daughters, serving instead to perpetuate an endearing but bland image of them as dutiful, docile and uncontroversial. Such a homogeneous view was further compounded by Alexandra herself, who referred to her daughters, even into adulthood, as two anonymous groupings: ‘the big pair’ – Olga and Tatiana – and ‘the little pair’ – Maria and Anastasia. The girls followed suit, often referring to themselves collectively as OTMA in letters – by their first name initial.\n\nWhen the Romanov Tercentenary was celebrated in 1913, Olga and Tatiana were clearly blossoming, and were at last seen on the public stage at a series of official public engagements. The foreign press was awash with gossip about the men they might marry. From the moment she turned sixteen in 1911, every possible princely candidate was discussed for Olga, with Carol of Romania, Boris of Bulgaria, Alexander of Serbia and Grand Duke Dmitry Pavlovich of Russia all posited as suitable bridegrooms. Over in England, until her death in 1901, Queen Victoria had nursed the hope of a marriage between Olga and the Prince of Wales’s son and heir – the future Edward VIII. How different British history might have been with a Queen Olga and no Wallis Simpson.\n\nBut nothing came of a string of suggested matches – particularly that of Olga with Prince Carol of Romania. Both sets of royal parents tried hard to bring the two young people together in the summer of 1914 but Olga did not like Carol and his roving eye would not have guaranteed a happy match for her. In any event Olga adamantly refused to marry a foreign prince and leave Russia. When it came down to it, Nicholas and Alexandra, who had married for love and wished the same for their daughters, would not force her into a marriage of dynastic expediency any more than they would her sisters, who had all united in their desire to stay in Russia. Wistfully, Olga admitted that all she wanted to do was get married, have children and live in obscurity in the countryside somewhere, far away from the official world of the Russian court. But the outbreak of war in August 1914 put paid to all talk of marriage.\n\nInstead war threw her and her sister Tatiana into the path of a succession of handsome wounded army officers when they began training as Red Cross nurses to work in the military hospital set up by their mother at Tsarskoe Selo. War, of all things, finally opened up something of the world outside for all four sisters. Maria and Anastasia took up work as hospital visitors and regularly interrogating the wounded about the ‘outside life’ that they longed to be part of. All the girls supported wartime charities and soon their hospital work with the wounded became the focus of their daily lives. Olga and Tatiana both demonstrated great dedication in their nursing; but while the strain of her responsibilities and the disappointments of falling for men she knew could never marry eventually led to physical and nervous collapse for Olga, Tatiana proved to be an exceptionally gifted and courageous nurse who – had history been different – might have been a pioneer of women’s nursing."
