Biological kinship with both parents has been established for both Alexei and Maria.\"\n\nResearch is still ongoing, including investigations into how the Russian imperial family was killed.\n\nRead more:Putin's Russia 'is not an empire' despite Crimea annexation\n\nRomanov family shrouded in mystery\n\nNicholas II, his German-born wife Alexandra Feodorovna, and their five children, Anastasia, Maria, Tatiana, Olga and Alexei, were executed by the Bolsheviks in 1918 in the midst of the Russian Revolution.\n\nThe Russian Orthodox Church had recognized the ex-tsar as a martyred saint in 1981.\n\nThe bodies of the last members of the Romanov dynasty were originally said to have been thrown into a mineshaft, before being burned and hurriedly buried by the killers.\n\nAlexandra Romanova, a spokeswoman for the investigation, told Izvestia that \"Our experiments denied the version that the bodies of the victims were destroyed with sulphuric acid and burned.\"\n\nThe remains were first tracked down by amateur historians in 1979, although the discovery was only revealed in 1991 when investigators announced the discovery of the remains of nine people in a burial site in a forest near Yekaterinburg.\n\nThey were said to have belonged to the imperial family including Nicholas II, his wife and daughters Anastasia, Tatiana and Olga, as well as their doctor and servants.\n\nIn 2007, researchers conducting an archeological dig south of the original burial, found the remains of what they believed were the two remaining children — Alexei and Maria. The finding led to the reopening of the investigation into the case and the exhumation of the remains of the family."
