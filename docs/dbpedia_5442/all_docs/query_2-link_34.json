        "text": "10th ANNUAL MICKEY™® AWARDS\n\nEstimated Reading Time: The Mickey™® Awards are much more prestigious than the Oscars, and unlike our lesser crosstown rival, we here at The Mickeys™® do not limit acceptance speech times. There will be no classless playing off by the orchestra here…mostly because we don’t have an orchestra. Regardless… expect this awards show article to last, at a minimum, approximately 6 hours and 37 minutes.\n\nIt’s that time of year again when Hollywood and the whole world holds their breath to find out who wins the most prestigious and most glorious award in human history...THE MICKEY™® AWARD!!\n\nThe Mickeys™® are far superior to every other award imaginable…be it the Oscar, the Emmy, the Tony, the Grammy, the Pulitzer or even the Nobel. The Mickey™® is the mountaintop of not just artistic but human achievement, which is why they always take place AFTER the Oscars!\n\nIt is pretty amazing that the Mickeys™® turn ten years old this year! It’s crazy to think that means the Mickeys have been around long enough that they are now old enough to drink!!\n\nThis has been a decent year in cinema. It wasn’t a massive success like in say 2019, but it was considerably better than the last four miserable years.\n\nThere are a multitude of outstanding films eligible for a Mickey™® award this year. Actors, actresses, writers, cinematographers and directors are all sweating and squirming right now in anticipation of the Mickey™® nominations and winners. Remember, even a coveted Mickey™® nomination is a career and life changing event.\n\nBefore we get to what everyone is here for…a quick rundown of the rules and regulations of The Mickeys™®. The Mickeys™® are selected by me. I am judge, jury and executioner. The only films eligible are films I have actually seen, be it in the theatre, via screener, cable, streamer or VOD. I do not see every film because as we all know, the overwhelming majority of films are God-awful, and I am a working man so I must be pretty selective. So that means that just getting me to actually watch your movie is a tremendous accomplishment in and of itself…never mind being nominated or winning!\n\nThe Prizes!! The winners of The Mickey™® award will receive a free lunch* with me at Fatburger (*lunch is considered one \"sandwich\" item, one order of small fries, and one beverage….yes, your beverage can be a shake, you fat bastards). I will gladly pay for the Mickey™® winner’s meal…but know this…the sterling conversation will be entirely free of charge…and will probably not be sterling.\n\nNow…fasten your seatbelts, gird your loins, and get ready to rumble…because IT’S TIME!!\n\nHere are the 10th Annual Mickey™® Awards!!\n\nPOPCORN MOVIE OF THE YEAR\n\nGodzilla Minus One – This movie crawled out of the Pacific and stomped across the globe winning hearts and minds while destroying everything in its path. Godzilla is back, baby!!\n\nSpider-Man Across the Spider-Verse – These Spider-Verse animated movies are really great stuff as they fully embrace the Spidey of everything while churning out some jaw-dropping animation.\n\nThe Killer – Fincher’s take on the assassin’s life is pure Gen X cinematic bliss. It qualifies as a popcorn film simply because it’s so deliciously amusing and so light on its feet.\n\nAnd the Mickey™® goes to…GODZILLA MINUS ONE! Not just a fantastic Godzilla movie, but a really terrific movie! Welcome to the Mickeys™ Godzilla!\n\nBEST CINEMATOGRAPHY\n\nOppenheimer - Hoyte van Hoytema – Hoytema, who won a Mickey™® in 2017 for his work on Dunkirk, is one of the best in the business. His work on Oppenheimer was as good as it gets and is a testament to his outrageous skill.\n\nThe Zone of Interest – Lukasz Zal – Zal’s previous work on Ida (2014) and Cold War (2018) got him the attention of the Mickey nominating committee. This year he stunned with his precise and pristine cinematography on The Zone of Interest. An absolute masterwork in minimalism and framing.\n\nAsteroid City – Robert Yoeman – Yoeman brought a vibrant color palette and a strict adherence to Anderson’s infatuation with straight lines to Asteroid City. As beautifully and uniquely shot a film as seen all year.\n\nPoor Things – Robbie Ryan – A glorious and imaginative piece of work that utilizes black and white and then color with a glorious verve. Ryan is among the best cinematographers in the world and his stellar work on Poor Things is a testament to that fact.\n\nAnd the Mickey™® goes to…LUKASZ ZAL – THE ZONE OF INTEREST! Zal’s visual discipline and inventiveness are what makes The Zone of Interest the powerful cinematic experience that it is.\n\nBEST SOUND\n\nOppenheimer – The sound on Oppenheimer was extraordinary, and it needed to be. The sound was integral in conveying the mammoth, existential event that was being dramatized before us.\n\nThe Zone of Interest – This movie used sound to such great effect it feels like as cinematic miracle. When sound was introduced into the cinematic arts this is how it was meant to be used.\n\nGodzilla Minus One – The earth-shaking sound on Godzilla Minus One kept the film in reality, and turned that reality into a horrifying experience…as it was meant to be.\n\nAnd the Mickey™® goes to…THE ZONE OF INTEREST. As great as the sound on Oppenheimer was, the sound on The Zone of Interest was even better. Just a masterful sound design, execution and mix. This is not only the best sound of the year, but among the best sound in a film of all-time.\n\nBEST SCORE/SOUNDTRACK\n\nThe Killer – The mod and morose pop-infused laments of The Smiths are what makes The Killer the darkly fun ride that it is. Never has a soundtrack so matched the emotional and mental theme of a film and character.\n\nOppenheimer – A wonderfully dark and majestic score that effortlessly mixes with the sound of the film to create a mesmerizing cinematic sensation.\n\nThe Zone of Interest – A bizarre and unnerving score makes The Zone of Interest feel like a disorienting horror movie. Just a sterling piece of work.\n\nKillers of the Flower Moon – The late Robbie Robertson mixes and matches modern guitar driven music with Native American drums and vocals to create a swirling and scintillating soundtrack that is the best thing about Killers of the Flower Moon.\n\nAnd the Mickey™® goes to…THE KILLER! This win is based on The Killer’s masterful use of the musical musings of Morrissey and The Smiths.\n\nBEST COSTUME/HAIR/MAKEUP\n\nThe Mickey™® goes to…Poor Things – I am not exactly as fashionista, but even I appreciated the original and fascinatingly unique costumes, hair and make-up on display in Poor Things. The artisans who created these looks and perfectly executed them, are absolute masters deserving of the highest praise…and the highest praise available is a Mickey™® Award.\n\nBEST EDITING\n\nOppenheimer – A truly spectacular piece of editing kept this mammoth story from flying off the rails.\n\nThe Zone of Interest – Subtle editing gave this movie a perfect pace and tone.\n\nAnatomy of a Fall – The editing on this film was so seamless and deft as to be miraculous.\n\nAnd the Mickey™® goes to…OPPENHEIMER – Editor Jennifer Lame’s work was stunning as she wrestled this sprawling, time-jumping behemoth and turned it into a smooth and easy ride.\n\nBEST EFFECTS\n\nGodzilla Minus One – Godzilla feels real and utterly terrifying in this film and that is thanks to the special effects geniuses who threw him together with a minimal budget.\n\nOppenheimer – A lot was made of the fact that Christopher Nolan used minimal special effects and mostly actual effects to make this movie. How-ever he did it, it is astonishing to behold.\n\nNo One Will Save You – This little movie made the most of it when designing and executing their movie monster aliens. It is quite incredible that a small movie like this was able to make such notable effects and utilize them so effectively.\n\nAnd the Mickey™® goes to…GODZILLA MINUS ONE!! Somehow these filmmakers were able to make the best special effects of the year…and of the last few years, on a shoestring budget that would be laughable on a Hollywood blockbuster. Well done Team Godzilla!\n\nBEST SUPPORTING ACTOR\n\nWillem Dafoe – Poor Things – Dafoe, as always, brings his weirdness to the fore as the Dr. Frankenstein in this bizarro movie. Despite his eccentricities, Dafoe is able to find humanity in every role he touches.\n\nRobert Downey Jr. – Oppenheimer – It’s easy to forget that Downey is more than just iron Man and amusing snark. In Oppenheimer, Downey’s restraint isn’t just necessary but notable and it creates a compelling and convincing character that subtly dominates every scene he inhabits. The line, “no, just a shoe salesman”, is delivered with such perfection as to be devastating.\n\nRyan Gosling – Barbie – As much as I loathed the movie Barbie, I loved Ryan Gosling as Ken. When Gosling goes for it he is an unstoppable force, and he goes for it with gusto as Ken. Good for him.\n\nMilo Machado-Graner - Anatomy of a Fall – This kid is so good in Anatomy of Fall I forgot I was watching some kid actor. A nuanced and tormented performance that feels as real as real can be.\n\nCharles Melton – May December – I had never heard of Christopher Melton prior to May December, but apparently, he was on some stupid teen show. Who knows? All I know is that he gives the very best performance in that film and it isn’t even close. Subtle and heartbreaking, Melton never falters.\n\nAnd the Mickey™® goes to…ROBERT DOWNEY JR. – OPPENHEIMER – This was a very tight category, with Gosling and Melton tying for second place just mere percentage points behind Downey. But Downey’s work in Oppenheimer is layered, nuanced, subtle yet very powerful. A true tour de force performance that despite its wins in award shows, is often downplayed because Downey is such a Hollywood icon. The truth is he absolutely crushed this role….and now he’s got the Mickey™® award to prove his worth….as well as all that Iron Man money.\n\nBEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS\n\nSandra Huller – The Zone of Interest – Huller’s Nazi wife in The Zone of Interest is an absolutely stunning piece of work. Banal yet bravado, Huller imbues her housewife with a drive and fear that make her part momma bear and part Nazi supremacist. Pray she never runs for your school’s PTA board.\n\nPenelope Cruz – Ferrari – Cruz is often overlooked (even by me) but she is a master craftswoman. Her work in Ferrari could have been throwaway stuff (like her counterpart Shailene Woodley) but in Cruz’s hands it became a well-rounded, nuanced and subtle piece of dramatic work that never fails to compel. Her scene in the cemetery is the best acting caught on screen this year.\n\nDa’Vine Joy Randolph – The Holdovers – Ms. Randolph was a revelation as the grieving mom in The Holdovers. More impressive is the fact that she absolutely nails the Boston accent that has been butchered by so many other notable actors. A truly impressive performance.\n\nJulianne Moore - May December – Speaking of actresses that have butchered Boston accents…Julianne Moore plays a weird lady in May December with a relentless aplomb. This is the type of role that she excels in…it’s like a cross between her work in Boogie Nights and Magnolia.\n\nAnd the Mickey™® goes to…PENELOPE CRUZ - FERRARI!! I have not been able to get the scene where Cruz’s character visits her son’s grave out of my head since I’ve seen it. In the scene Cruz doesn’t say a word and yet conveys a panoply of emotions and tells a dramatically compelling and emotionally devastating tale in less than a minute of screen time. It really is incredible and a monument to her colossal talent and skill.\n\nBEST BREAKTHROUGH PERFORMANCE OF THE YEAR\n\nThe Mickey™® goes to….the little kid in Godzilla Minus One and the Dog in Anatomy of a Fall – Okay…I’m a grown man so I don’t really care about babies or whatever…but the little kid in Godzilla is so damn cute and is such a good actress it’s astonishing. This kid was crying on cue so well I was worried she was being abused in order to trigger it. Hopefully she wasn’t.\n\nSpeaking of great acting…I’m being serious when I say that Messi, the dog in Anatomy of a Fall, is maybe the greatest actor in a movie this year. His near-death scene is so good it had me weeping. This dog has it all…charisma, good looks and acting chops. Somebody get this dog a movie franchise!\n\nBEST ANIMATED FILM\n\nThe Boy and the Heron – Hayao Miyazaki is among the greatest animated filmmakers of all-time. The Boy and the Heron may, or may not, be his last film, but if it is he went out with a bang. With his distinctive bizarre flair Miyazaki relays a boy’s grief and fears and his first steps on the journey to manhood. It is the work of a master craftsman and a singular genius.\n\nSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse – These Spider-Verse films are as great as can be as they treat the Spider-man mythos with respect all while generating some of the most impressive animation styles imaginable. This is the second film in a trilogy and the third will be very highly anticipated.\n\nAnd the Mickey™® goes to…THE BOY AND THE HERON!! Miyazaki’s work is a favorite of both mine and my son (who is also a member of the Mickeys Voting Committee) so this was a no-brainer. It is nice that a master like Miyazaki can now retire in peace if he so chooses, having won the most prestigious award in human civilization – The Mickey™®\n\nBEST FOREIGN FILM\n\nGodzilla Minus One – This is the movie Godzilla and Godzilla fans have been waiting decades for. It is a brilliant piece of work that is a truly great movie.\n\nThe Zone of Interest – Jonathan Glazer’s film about the banality of evil is so steady and precise that it seeps into your brain and refuses to let you forget it…which is both a blessing and a curse.\n\nAnatomy of a Fall – Expertly made and fantastically acted, Anatomy of a Fall is the type of movie Hollywood used to make but hasn’t for like fifty years.\n\nThe Boy and the Heron – Miyazaki is the epitome of the master craftsman combined with artistic genius. There is no one better than him and there has never been anyone better than him.\n\nAnd the Mickey™® goes to…THE ZONE OF INTEREST!! Not only a cinematic masterpiece but a staggeringly relevant piece of culture in a time when we are so eager to be blind to the evil and moral and ethical corruption that surrounds us to such an extent it feels as prevalent as the air we breathe.\n\nBEST ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY\n\nGodzilla Minus One – The key to this script’s success is that it treats Godzilla as a real threat with real human consequences. It’s shocking how beautiful this script is.\n\nAnatomy of a Fall – Masterfully written court room drama that keeps audiences guessing for weeks after seeing the film.\n\nNo One Will Save You – A truly original and energizing piece of work that elevated what could have been a mundane alien movie into a deeply poignant psychological story.\n\nThe Boy and the Heron – Miyazaki is in his 80s and is still exploring the wounds from his youth. Beautifully written.\n\nThe Holdovers – A vibrant and well-paced drama that never lacks for witticisms.\n\nAnd the Mickey™® goes to…ANATOMY OF A FALL! As well-rounded an original script as we’ve seen in years as it refuses to indulge in easy labels and black and white thinking.\n\nBEST ADAPTED SCREENPLAY\n\nFerrari – This adaptation was floating around for years and finally made it to the big screen. It is a nice companion piece with 2019’s Ford v Ferrari.\n\nOppenheimer – It’s impressive that Christopher Nolan read this book, never mind adapted it. This massive tome would be an unruly mess in most other writer/director’s hands, but Nolan tames the wild beast and creates a beautiful historical tapestry.\n\nThe Zone of Interest – Glazer apparently used the Martin Amis book of the same name as a launching off point and he creatively catapults his adaption into the stratosphere.\n\nPoor Things – An absolutely batshit tale that is so unbelievable but feels realer than real. A solid piece of work.\n\nAmerican Fiction – Funny and insightful, the flawed American Fiction loses focus occasionally but it never fails to be amusing, and its premise is spot on.\n\nAnd the Mickey™® goes to…OPPENHEIMER! That Christopher Nolan could make a compelling and coherent film out of the massive tome about a scientist is a testament to his extraordinary storytelling capabilities. As impressive an adaptation as we’ve seen in decades.\n\nBEST SCENE OF THE YEAR\n\nThe Killer - Fight scene – Fassbender’s assassin engaging in hand-to-hand combat with a giant gang leader in the middle of the night is as viscerally engaging a scene as you can imagine. Great stuff.\n\nNo One Will Save You – First contact scene – This heart-pounding scene is so well executed it stayed with me for days. Just a glorious piece of quality and imaginative filmmaking.\n\nGodzilla Minus One – Godzilla city rampage – Godzilla coming ashore and leveling a Japanese city is what you want from a Godzilla movie…and boy oh boy does this one deliver.\n\nPoor Things – Dance scene – Nothing had me laughing harder this year than watching Emma Stone’s Bella Baxter cut the rug at some fancy French ballroom. Fantastic!\n\nAnd the Mickey™® goes to…GODZILLA MINUS ONE!! This gripping scene is jaw-dropping and spellbinding.\n\nBEST ACTRESS\n\nEmma Stone – Poor Things – Stone’s bravura work in Poor Things is absolutely mesmerizing. Like an acting exercise on steroids, Stone’s Bella matures before our eyes and never fails to completely command your attention.\n\nSandra Huller – Anatomy of a Fall – As genuine and grounded a performance as you’ll see, Huller brings nuance and subtlety to new heights.\n\nKaitlyn Dever – No One Will Save You – An energized and unnerving performance that grabs you from the get go and never lets you go.\n\nAnd the Mickey™® goes to…EMMA STONE- POOR THINGS! Emma Stone is the best actress in the world at the moment, and it isn’t even close. She now possesses a Mickey™® award proving she is an acting goddess who walks amongst us.\n\nBEST ACTOR\n\nCillian Murphy – Oppenheimer – Murphy’s controlled yet frantic Oppenheimer is a masterclass in containment and a vivid inner life. A sensitive and deeply moving portrayal.\n\nChristian Friedel – The Zone of Interest – This is an astonishing performance as it embraces the ordinary amongst the extraordinary. Subtle and skillful.\n\nJeffrey Wright – American Fiction – Wright is a terrific actor and his work in American Fiction is a testament to not only his likability but his acting ability.\n\nPaul Giamatti – The Holdovers – Nobody embodies curmudgeons like Paul Giamatti, and he does some of his best curmudgeonly work in The Holdovers.\n\nAnd the Mickey™® goes to…CILLIAN MURPHY – OPPENHEIMER!! The Mickey Awards have been the center of controversy since their inception for our notorious and blatant anti-Irish bias. Despite the uproar, the Mickeys™® have refused to change their stance at all…and still believe that the Irish are sub-humans and the most base and vile of creatures. That said, it is a testament to Cillian Murphy’s talent and skill that he convinced the Mickeys™® that he wasn’t just human, but the particular human that was Robert Oppenheimer. For his noble and notable work, Cillian Murphy wins the most prestigious award of all…the Mickey™®. But the Mickeys™® still consider him to be an Irish animal and no award, no matter how prestigious will ever change that.\n\nACTOR/ACTRESS OF THE YEAR\n\nSandra Huller – Anatomy of a Fall/The Zone of Interest – Sandra Huller has the highest distinction this year in that she came in second place in both the Best Supporting Actress and Best Actress categories of the Mickey™® Awards. Her work in both films is astonishing, and one can only hope she finds equally challenging and impressive roles and films in her future because when given quality material she is as good as it gets. Her 2023 was as good as a year as we’ve seen from an actress in quite some time.\n\nBEST ENSEMBLE\n\nPoor Things – Great cast with a few exceptions (Mark Ruffalo and Jerrod Carmichael are actively awful in the movie) is led by the inimitable Emma Stone, who brings her absolute A-game to the festivities.\n\nThe Holdovers – Paul Giamatti leads a strong ensemble that features two quality supporting turns from Da’Vine Joy Randolph and Dominic Sessa. Just a solid cast across the board.\n\nOppenheimer – Everywhere you turn in this movie you run into a quality actor turning in a solid performance. Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr., Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Casey Affleck, Josh Hartnett and Jason Clarke among many others. This film doesn’t work without such a notable and strong cast.\n\nAnatomy of a Fall – A bevy of French actors and actresses…and even a dog, turn in subtle and nuanced performances in a film that never gives away the game. A very strong group.\n\nAnd the Mickey™® goes to…OPPENHEIMER! This movie would crumble if it weren’t for the genius of Christopher Nolan and the cornucopia of strong actors and actresses he put together for the ensemble.\n\nBEST DIRECTOR\n\nChristopher Nolan – Oppenheimer – Mickey™® award winner (Dunkirk - 2017) Christopher Nolan is the best blockbuster auteur working in cinema today and he lives up to his impressive history with his stellar work on the massive cinematic achievement that is Oppenheimer. It is inconceivable that any other director could have pulled this film off as well as he did.\n\nJonathan Glazer – The Zone of Interest – Glazer is a bit of an odd duck of an auteur, but his vision and the execution of that vision, on The Zone of Interest is the most artistically ambitious and insightful directorial work since Alfonso Cuaron’s Roma. Just extraordinary.\n\nJustine Triet – Anatomy of a Fall – As skilled a directorial job as any this year, Triet’s firm and steady hand kept this film from floundering and showed her to be a master craftswoman.\n\nYorgos Lanthimos – Poor Things – Yorgos Lanthimos is an acquired taste…but I’ve acquired it. His sense of humor and his ability to draw out superb performances from his cast while embracing the comedy and drama with an exquisite cinematic artistry, is what makes him one of the best, and most original and interesting, filmmakers of our time.\n\nAnd the Mickey goes to…JONATHAN GLAZER – THE ZONE OF INTEREST! Glazer doesn’t make many movies, but when he does, they demand your attention, none more so that The Zone of Interest. That Glazer could be so artistically committed and disciplined with his approach on this film speaks to the power of his cinematic vision and his artistry. Kudos to him and congratulations on winning the most prestigious award in cinema and world history.\n\nBEST PICTURE\n\n10. American Fiction – A funny and sometimes insightful film that may or may not be in on the joke its telling. The film is flawed and a bit scattered, but is an amusing ride.\n\n9. Ferrari – Hamstrung by a poor lead performance from Adam Driver, this movie still manages to be compelling thanks to director Michael Mann and supporting actress Penelope Cruz.\n\n8. No One Will Save You – A little movie with big ideas that never fails to keep you guessing or on the edge of your seat.\n\n7. The Killer – David Fincher goes full Fincher in this wry and culturally aware assassin’s tale which feels like a poorly camouflaged autobiography.\n\n6. The Boy and the Heron – A Miyazaki movie through and through as it is deeply moving and also deeply weird.\n\n5. Anatomy of a Fall – A masterfully constructed and acted courtroom drama that grabs hold of you and never lets you go…even in the days after seeing it.\n\n4. Godzilla Minus One – Godzilla is back, baby! This movie is a truly top-notch piece of cinema.\n\n3. Poor Things - Yorgos Lanthimos proves once again why he is among the very best filmmakers in the world, and Emma Stone proves she IS the best actress in the world. A stunningly original piece of work.\n\n2. Oppenheimer – A massive and sprawling film that director Christopher Nolan makes feel intimate. A throw-back to Hollywood’s glory days when big movies about big ideas got made and made very well.\n\n1.The Zone of Interest – An unnervingly banal yet artistically ambitious look at the Nazi death machine that is masterfully directed by Jonathan Glazer.\n\nMOST IMPORTANT FILM OF THE YEAR\n\nThe Zone of Interest/Oppenheimer – These two films have much in common. For example, they both deal with the same World War II era, albeit from different sides of the divide. They also have protagonists that are employed by the state to manage their massive industrial machinery of murder.\n\nAnd most notably, at least in my eyes, is that both films strictly refuse to show the fruits of their protagonist’s nefarious labor.\n\nThe Zone of Interest is set in a concentration camp but never shows Jews being murdered, and Oppenheimer is about the atomic bomb but never shows the slaughter it produced.\n\nThese two films are the most important films of the year because they dramatize and embody our own steadfast refusal to see what is right in front of our eyes…namely the insidiously evil nature of the government of the United States of America and its affiliates, and the slaughter and suffering they cause across the globe.\n\nI can’t remember who it was, but someone once said, “isn’t it funny how the good guys win every war?” The reason that joke is funny of course is because it’s the winners of wars who write the history of those wars and they always see themselves as the good guys. To the victor’s go the spoils and the spoils in modern warfare are that you get to paint yourself as a hero…always and every time.\n\nIf Rudolf Hoss, the protagonist of The Zone of Interest, had written a book in the wake of a Nazi victory in World War II, it no doubt would’ve been about how through his brilliant management style he heroically helped save Germany and the rest of Europe. It would probably be titled “Somehow I Manage”.\n\nFormer Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara once stated in the wonderful Errol Morris documentary The Fog of War, that if the U.S. had lost World War II the entire American military command would’ve been tried and hung as war criminals for the firebombing of Tokyo.\n\nOf course, the same would be true for Robert Oppenheimer as a result of the massacres at Hiroshima and Nagasaki which were directly the result of his scientific achievements.\n\nThe U.S. was on the winning side of the war, and so Oppenheimer faced no executioner. Rudolf Hoss, on the other hand, was on the “wrong side of history” and was tried at Nuremberg and hung for his war crimes.\n\nTo be clear, no one weeps for Hoss, the Commandant of Auschwitz, despite the fact that Hoss, like Oppenheimer, was just “following orders” and “doing his job” and “fighting for his country”, but that doesn’t make him any less culpable or morally and ethically repugnant.\n\nHoss and Oppenheimer were both exceedingly good at their jobs and both were deft bureaucratic infighters who could maneuver through some very tricky situations in order to get what they wanted. Both of them ultimately paid a price for their successes, Hoss was hanged and Oppenheimer hung out to dry.\n\nHoss was a Nazi and I think we can all agree that the Nazis were a stunningly clear embodiment of evil. But if the Nazis were so evil why were so many of them absconded from post-war Germany and brought to the U.S. via Operation Paperclip? Why did so many Nazis, like scientist Wernher von Braun, become integral parts of the U.S. power structure?\n\nCould it be that our moral preening in the wake of WWII was just that, empty preening, and our victory, which wasn’t really ours but the Soviet Union’s, was nothing more than window dressing for the masses – the shuffling of cards in a rigged deck? Could it be the Fourth Reich is alive and well and ruling the world from some smoky backroom in D.C. or Geneva or some other monied capitol?\n\nThe Nazis, or Not-sees as my friend The Falconer calls them, did NOT-SEE the humanity of the Jews and Slavs they slaughtered on an industrial scale. But that inability to see the humanity of their enemy isn’t a Nazi thing, but a human thing, an impulse and instinct we must struggle against.\n\nThe most-clear example of this is that the ancestors of the same Jews who survived the Holocaust perpetrated upon them by the Nazis, are now perpetrating a holocaust upon Palestinians. The same dehumanization that animated the Nazi Holocaust is the same one that animates the current holocaust inflicted upon the Palestinians.\n\nIn a way, the brutal occupation and ethnic cleansing of Palestinians at the hands of Israelis is the epitome of a historical tragedy because Israel was formed as a direct result of the Holocaust, and now it has become the monster from which it was birthed. It is like a child conceived in rape growing up to become a serial rapist.\n\nThat Israelis and Palestinians cannot see one another as human is no surprise considering the tormented, tortured, bloody and brutal history of that region, but that Americans refuse to see their own complicity in the dehumanization and slaughter is much more alarming and shameful.\n\nAmericans are as ill-informed, mis-informed and dis-informed as any group of people on the planet, and their ignorance and willful blindness to the U.S.’s malignant presence in not just the Middle East, but across the globe, is truly disturbing.\n\nAmerican’s refusal to see that they are complicit in the massacre in Gaza and the war in Ukraine, is exactly what The Zone of Interest and Oppenheimer are dramatizing, consciously or unconsciously.\n\nThe U.S. instigated the war in Ukraine with a coup in 2014, and have thwarted any and all peace attempts and encouraged Ukraine to break any peace accords or ceasefires. As a result, hundreds of thousands are dead…mostly Ukrainians. But our media and political establishment stomp their feet and screech and wail about the villainy of evil Putin and so on and so forth. You don’t have to think Putin is a hero to know that we Americans are the villains in Ukraine.\n\nThe same is true regarding the Palestinians and Israel. Israel’s occupation and long-time expansion of settlements in the West Bank, only occurs because we give them financial and military aid as well as diplomatic cover at the U.N.\n\nThe tens of thousands slaughtered in Gaza? Their blood is on our hands because if our leadership – and I use that term loosely, wanted it to stop they would simply say to Israel, “if the settlements in the West Bank aren’t torn down, and the killing in Gaza doesn’t stop now, then all U.S. aid, be it financial or military, will cease now and forever”, but that will never happen. The reason it will never happen is something you aren’t allowed to say but is true nonetheless…namely Israel does whatever it wants because it runs America, not the other way around. Joe Biden doesn’t tell Israel what to do, Israel tells Joe Biden what to do. And the same was true with Trump and will be true if Trump wins this year’s election. It doesn’t matter who the President of the United States of America is in regards to Israel because the American leadership class in its entirety is thoroughly compromised by Israeli’s over-sized lobby and massive money-machine, Israeli’s ruthless intelligence apparatus (does anyone remember Jeffrey Epstein?), and a bevy of Zionist fifth columnists throughout the U.S. government.\n\nThis is why the U.S. is so quick to slander Putin as a war criminal but would never dare to suggest that of Israel…because Netanyahu IS a war criminal, but…he’s OUR war criminal. And Americans simply accept this unending hypocrisy and moral duplicity blindly and without a second thought.\n\nThis desperate and willful blindness, be it moral, ethical or political, is what animates The Zone of Interest and Oppenheimer, and what animates the entirety of the political and media establishment, as well as the populace, in the United States of America.\n\nThe bottom line is that closing your eyes to moral atrocities doesn’t actually make you blind, it only makes you gullible and culpable…and the American people are lots of both.\n\nWell on that very, very upbeat note….the tenth (THE TENTH!! – and God-willing not the last!) Mickey™® Awards comes to a close!! Thank you so much for continuing to read my work and for sticking with me through thick and thin. I greatly appreciate it. I hope you have a great 2024 and we’ll see you next year…AT THE MICKEYS™®!!\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @MPMActingCo\n\n©2024\n\n96TH ACADEMY AWARDS: 2024 OSCAR PREDICTIONS\n\nIt’s that time of year once again…when all the self-righteous degenerates and pedophiles of Hollywood gather together to celebrate how wonderful they are…that’s right…the Academy Awards are here!!\n\nFor the first time in the last five years, I find myself mildly interested in the most nauseatingly narcissistic of awards shows just because I actually liked a few of the movies, and especially because I liked the front runner Oppenheimer.\n\nI would enjoy Oppenheimer going nuclear on the competition at the Oscars for a variety of reasons.\n\n1. I liked the movie.\n\n2. I like Christopher Nolan.\n\n3. I like that it’s incredibly well-made.\n\n4. I like that it’s a movie made for adults that is three hours long and it still made nearly a billion dollars.\n\n5. I want it to win so that they make more movies like it.\n\nIt seemed that the Academy Awards, and Hollywood, over the last few years were quickly hurtling toward their well-earned demise as a brief glance at the last four Best Picture winners reveals a poopoo platter of putrid movies….Nomadland (2020), Coda (2021) and Everything Everywhere All At Once (2023)…YIKES!\n\nBut this year we have a bunch of films nominated for Best Picture that are actually decent movies, Oppenheimer chief among them. So maybe this signals that the movie business and the art of cinema are, if not climbing out of their graves, then at least no longer digging.\n\nOf course, I’m not going to get too optimistic as Hollywood is very good at shitting all over themselves in any given situation, so I will just wait and see how this year goes…and if there is a next year, then how next year goes.\n\nBut for now…this is a solid Best Picture contingent. The other categories? Well, I admit it seems like slim pickings in many of them, and the closer you look the less pretty the picture of this year at the movies looks, but for now I’m just going to enjoy an actual movie – Oppenheimer, being the belle of the ball at the Academy Awards.\n\nAs for the Academy Awards…as longtime readers know I have won a record setting 35 straight Oscar pools. My domination in this field is less a testament to my brilliance than to the fact that I have no friends and therefore am competing only against myself…and I’m an idiot so it’s easy to for me to outwit me.\n\nAnyway…enough of my rambling…let’s get on with it!! Here are my official picks for this year’s Oscar winners.\n\nBEST PICTURE\n\nAmerican Fiction\n\nAnatomy of a Fall\n\nBarbie\n\nThe Holdovers\n\nKillers of the Flower Moon\n\nMaestro\n\nOppenheimer\n\nPast Lives\n\nPoor Things\n\nThe Zone of Interest\n\nThis is a pretty easy category as Oppenheimer has been the front runner since it hit big screens last summer and hasn’t wavered even a little bit. The movie is everything that Hollywood used to stand for and celebrate…and will reap the rewards.\n\nAs for the other films, Barbie and Maestro are dogshit and should not be nominated…and neither should Killers of the Flower Moon. But beyond that the films are all good to very good.\n\nWill Win: Oppenheimer\n\nShould Win: Oppenheimer\n\nBEST DIRECTOR\n\nJustine Triet – Anatomy of a Fall\n\nMartin Scorsese – Killers of the Flower Moon\n\nChristopher Nolan – Oppenheimer\n\nYorgos Lanthimos – Poor Things\n\nJonathon Glazer – The Zone of Intertest\n\nThis is Christopher Nolan’s year. This Best Picture/Best Director Oscar win is less a celebration of Nolan than a coronation. He is the ultimate blockbuster auteur…and frankly…the only blockbuster auteur we have. No one is beating him for Best Director.\n\nWill Win: Christopher Nolan Oppenheimer\n\nShould Win: Christopher Nolan\n\nBEST ACTOR\n\nBradley Cooper – Maestro\n\nColman Domingo – Rustin\n\nPaul Giamatti – The Holdovers\n\nCillian Murphy – Oppenheimer\n\nJeffrey Wright – American Fiction\n\nThis is a thin category as Domingo Colman and Bradley Cooper have zero business being nominated…but then again, the year is not filled with a plethora of sterling performances. Cillian Murphy does excellent work as the title character in Oppenheimer. He’s not a movie star and he’s not an acting star, he’s just a decent, quiet, likable guy who crushed a difficult role.\n\nWill Win: Cillian Murphy Oppenheimer\n\nCould Win: Paul Giamatti The Holdovers – Giamatti has a shot to pull off the upset, but it’s a long shot. Not impossible, but very difficult.\n\nShould Win: Cillian Murphy\n\nBEST ACTRESS\n\nAnnette Bening – Nyad\n\nLily Gladstone – Killers of the Flower Moon\n\nSandra Huller – Anatomy of a Fall\n\nCarey Mulligan – Maestro\n\nEmma Stone – Poor Things\n\nAnother strange category as Annette Bening and Carey Mulligan are actively atrocious in their performances. Sandra Huller is terrific in Anatomy of a Fall. Lily Gladstone is just…ok…in what is really a supporting role in Killers of the Flower Moon. Emma Stone gives one of the greatest performances of the last 25 years in Poor Things and should win her second-best Actress statuette. But she won’t because the Oscars are about virtue signaling their Diversity, Equity and Inclusion bona fides as much as anything else. Lily Gladstone will be the first Native American woman to win an Oscar, and to Academy members that means a lot, despite the fact that her work is unworthy of the award…and Emma Stone’s work is so transcendently sublime.\n\nWill Win: Lily Gladstone Killers of the Flower Moon\n\nCould Win: Emma Stone Poor Things – Stone has a chance, and I hope she wins, but I just think that the Diversity Cult wins the day over meritocracy.\n\nShould Win: Emma Stone\n\nBEST SUPPORTING ACTOR\n\nSterling K. Brown – American Fiction\n\nRobert DeNiro – Killers of the Flower Moon\n\nRobert Downey Jr. – Oppenheimer\n\nRyan Gosling – Barbie\n\nMark Ruffalo – Poor Things\n\nDowney is a great reclamation/redemption story. The arc of his career is fascinating, and his being the lynchpin in the MCU and how much money those movies made for Hollywood, and Downey’s charm and resilience, are what make him the unquestioned favorite to win this award. Oh…and he also does exceptional work in Oppenheimer, so that helps too.\n\nWill Win: Robert Downey Jr Oppenheimer\n\nCould Win: Ryan Gosling Barbie – Gosling is beloved but not as beloved as Downey. Gosling’s time will come…just not this year.\n\nShould Win: Robert Downey Jr\n\nBEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS\n\nEmily Blunt – Oppenheimer\n\nDanielle Brooks – The Color Purple\n\nAmerica Ferrera – Barbie\n\nJodie Foster – Nyad\n\nDa’Vine Joy Randolph – The Holdovers\n\nThis is an incredibly weak field, and Randolph is far and away the best performance and will without a doubt win the award…and deservedly so.\n\nWill Win: Da’Vine Joy Randolph\n\nShould Win: Da’Vine Joy Randolph\n\nBEST ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY\n\nAnatomy of a Fall\n\nThe Holdovers\n\nMaestro\n\nMay December\n\nPast Lives\n\nTricky category. I think Justine Triet (Anatomy of a Fall), who is also nominated in Best Director, gets the nod, as the Academy likes to reward directors with a screenplay award when they’re not getting a director’s award.\n\nWill Win: Justine Triet Anatomy of a Fall\n\nCould Win: Celine Song Past Lives – There’s a lot of affection for this film but I think Anatomy of a Fall has the momentum.\n\nShould Win: Justine Triet\n\nBEST ADAPTED SCREENPLAY\n\nAmerican Fiction\n\nBarbie\n\nOppenheimer\n\nPoor Things\n\nThe Zone of Interest\n\nEasily the most fascinating of all the categories. This category could be an indicator of an absolute blowout for Oppenheimer if Nolan wins the award. Or it could be another chance for the Academy to signal its virtue by rewarding Cord Jefferson and American Fiction, which isn’t worthy but deals with race and the Oscars love that sort of thing. But what I think will happen is that the Academy will reward Greta Gerwig for Barbie as a way to show they’re not sexist, and to acknowledge the “importance” (*barf*) of Barbie and its success. It will also be Gerwig’s first Oscar win after four nominations.\n\nWill Win: Greta Gerwig Barbie\n\nCould Win: Cord Jefferson American Fiction/Christopher Nolan Oppenheimer\n\nShould Win: Christopher Nolan Oppenheimer\n\nBEST ANIMATED FEATURE\n\nThe Boy and the Heron\n\nElemental\n\nNimona\n\nRobot Dreams\n\nSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\n\nThis is a two-way race between Miyazaki’s The Boy and the Heron and the Spider-Verse movie. I think it goes to Miyazaki because he is an acknowledged master and this may (or may not) be his final film. And the first Spider-Verse movie won this category, and there is another Spider-Verse movie coming, the final in the trilogy, so that gives Academy voters a chance to not vote for this one and wait for next time. Regardless…I think Miyazaki wins the award…which will make me very, very happy, as I love his films.\n\nWill Win: The Boy and the Heron\n\nCould Win: Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\n\nShould Win: The Boy and the Heron\n\nBEST INTERNATIONAL FEATURE\n\nIo Capitano\n\nPerfect Days\n\nSociety of the Snow\n\nThe Teachers’ Lounge\n\nThe Zone of Interest\n\nThis is no competition at all. The Zone of Interest is nominated for Best Picture and Best Director as well as Best International Feature. It won’t win the first two, but it sure as hell will win this one. It’s a terrific arthouse movie, one of the very best films of the year. It is unbeatable in this category. Now, if Anatomy of a Fall had been France’s official selection and were in the running here…then this would be a barnburner of a category…but it isn’t…so it isn’t.\n\nWill Win: The Zone of Interest\n\nShould Win: The Zone of Interest\n\nBEST DOCUMENTARY FEATURE\n\nBobi Wine: The People’s President\n\nThe Eternal Memory\n\nFour Daughters\n\nTo Kill a Tiger\n\n20 Days in Mariupol\n\nIn an act of predictable and pretentious political posturing, 20 Days in Mariupol will win this award and easily. Yawn.\n\nWill Win: 20 Days in Mairupol\n\nBEST DOCUMENTARY SHORT\n\nWhen picking the short categories you have to focus on two things…1. Is someone famous involved. 2. What is the most compelling “agenda” on display which will satiate the Academy’s self-righteousness. The ABCs of Book Banning seems like a perfect fit for the self-righteous, politically-motivated, virtue signaling crowd in the Academy.\n\nWill Win: The ABCs of Book Banning\n\nBEST LIVE ACTION SHORT\n\nThis short category fulfills the “famous person” requirement for Academy interest. Wes Anderson has never won an Academy Award. This seems like a good way for the Academy to finally give him a nod. It also helps that his short is very, very good.\n\nWill Win: The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar\n\nBEST ANIMATED SHORT\n\nThis short satisfies BOTH the famous person and agenda requirements as Sean Lennon and Yoko Ono are featured and it’s anti-war.\n\nWill Win: The War is Over!\n\nBEST ORIGINAL SCORE\n\nAmerican Fiction\n\nIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\n\nKillers of the Flower Moon\n\nOppenheimer\n\nPoor Things\n\nA mildly interesting category. Goransson (Oppenheimer) should win this easily, and deservedly so, but John Williams (Indiana Jones) is a Hollywood institution and he’s 91 years old, so there’s always the chance the Oscars bestow a thank-you-for-your-service Oscar to him in this category. In the same way, Robbie Robertson (Killers of the Flower Moon) died this past year, so the sympathy vote could go his way and he could win in an upset. Anything is possible, but I think Oppenheimer is in for a big night and this category will be a leading indicator.\n\nWill Win: Ludwig Goransson Oppenheimer\n\nCould Win: John Williams Indiana Jones/Robbie Robertson Killers of the Flower Moon\n\nShould Win: Ludwig Goransson Oppenheimer\n\nBEST ORIGINAL SONG\n\nThe Academy wants to reward barbie and this category is a good place to do it because it also gives them a chance to attract and satisfy younger viewers. Billie Eilish fills the bill on both counts.\n\nWill Win: Billie Eilish Barbie\n\nCould Win: I’m Just Ken Barbie\n\nShould Win: I’m Just Ken Barbie\n\nBEST SOUND\n\nThe Creator\n\nMaestro\n\nMI Dead Reckoning\n\nOppenheimer\n\nThe Zone of Interest\n\nAnother bellwether category. If Oppenheimer wins this it will signal a huge night for the Team Nolan…but if The Zone of Interest wins, which is very, very possible, then it signals that Oppenheimer will have a good night, but not a great one. I have flip flopped on this category a dozen times and am still not sure. But I guess I’ll go with the mild upset and pick The Zone of Interest. That said, I won’t be upset if Oppenheimer wins.\n\nWill Win: The Zone of Interest\n\nCould Win: Oppenheimer\n\nShould Win: Oppenheimer or The Zone of Interest – They are both exceedingly well done.\n\nBEST PRODUCTION DESIGN\n\nBarbie\n\nKillers of the Flower Moon\n\nNapoleon\n\nOppenheimer\n\nPoor Things\n\nLet’s be clear…if Oppenheimer wins this award then it is going to dominate the Oscars in the most epic and historical of ways. I don’t think it wins here though as this seems like a two-way race between Barbie and Poor Things. I think Poor Things is much more deserving of the award and will win it, but won’t be surprised if Barbie gets the nod.\n\nWill Win: Poor Things\n\nCould Win: Barbie\n\nShould Win: Poor Things\n\nBEST CINEMATOGRAPHY\n\nEdward Lachman - El Conde\n\nRodrigo Prieto - Killers of the Flower Moon\n\nMatthew Libatique - Maestro\n\nHoyte vna Hoytema - Oppenheimer\n\nRobbie Ryan - Poor Things\n\nHoyte van Hoytema (Oppenheimer) is one of the most respected cinematographers working today who hasn’t won an Oscar. I think that changes this year. There is a very outside chance that Robbie Ryan wins for his spectacular work on Poor Things…but that seems unlikely. Chalk another one up to the Oppenheimer juggernaut.\n\nWill Win: Hoyte van Hoytema Oppenheimer\n\nShould Win: Hoyte van Hoytema Oppenheimer\n\nBEST MAKEUP AND HAIR STYLING\n\nGolda\n\nMaestro\n\nOppenheimer\n\nPoor Things\n\nSociety of the Snow\n\nI think this is a battle between Maestro and Poor Things. If Oppenheimer wins here then holy shit we are in for an epic landslide of Oscars. I don’t think that happens though, as Maestro gets the nod over Poor Things.\n\nWill win: Maestro\n\nCould Win: Poor Things\n\nShould Win: Poor Things/Maestro – As much as I loathed Maestro…the old man makeup in that movie was astounding.\n\nBEST COSTUME DESIGN\n\nBarbie\n\nKillers of the Flower Moon\n\nNapoleon\n\nOppenheimer\n\nPoor Things\n\nBarbie and Poor Things square off once again, and Poor Things gets the win. If Barbie wins, which is not impossible, it could be a signal that the film will win a respectable amount of categories like Production Design and Costume Design.\n\nWill Win: Poor Things\n\nCould Win: Barbie\n\nShould Win: Poor Things\n\nBEST FILM EDITING\n\nAnatomy of a Fall\n\nThe Holdovers\n\nKillers of the Flower Moon\n\nOppenheimer\n\nPoor Things\n\nI think this is a slam dunk for Oppenheimer. If anything else wins, like Anatomy of a Fall, that is a strong signal that Oppenheimer will have a tough night outside of Best Picture and Best Director.\n\nWill Win: Oppenheimer\n\nShould Win: Oppenheimer\n\nBEST VISUAL EFFECTS\n\nThe Creator\n\nGodzilla Minus One\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3\n\nMission: Impossible\n\nNapoleon\n\nI think this is a pretty close category but that Godzilla Minus One will win. First off, the effects in the film are outstanding. Secondly, the effects team and the entire production have been out there celebrating their nomination. And third, the film was surprisingly very successful for a foreign film in the American market. For all these reasons, I think Godzilla Minus One wins the award…and frankly, rightfully so.\n\nWill Win: Godzilla Minus One\n\nShould Win: Godzilla Minus One\n\nSo that’s it…those are my Oscar predictions. I have Oppenheimer winning seven awards and with a very real chance to win nine. Maybe I’m wrong…but who cares? The real award, the most-presitgious award, the one that Hollywood insiders truly care about, is the Mickey Awards™…and they come next weekend!! So stay tuned!!\n\nUntil then, enjoy the Oscars and hopefully winning your Oscar pool!\n\nFollow me on Twitter: MPMActingCo\n\n©2024\n\nTHE MICKEYS – 2022\n\nThe god-awful Oscars have finally come and gone and now it’s time for the final and most prestigious awards in cinema to commence.\n\nThe Mickey™® Awards aren’t just the most prestigious award in cinema, but are undeniably the most prestigious award on the planet, easily topping those wannabe poseurs at the overrated Nobel Prize.\n\nUnfortunately, in recent years the art of cinema has not been worthy of such an esteemed and distinguished honor. You see, since the halcyon days of 2019 when great movies like Parasite, Joker, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and The Irishman, and significant arthouse films like Ad Astra, A Hidden Life, The Last Black Man in San Francisco and High Life, as well as quality middle-brow entertainment like the finely-crafted 1917 and Ford v Ferrari, graced our big screens, we’ve been in a dramatic and dire cinema drought. Not only has greatness not come to the big screen (or small screen) in the last three years, goodness has been an absolute rarity as well.\n\nOn the bright side, it must be said that 2022 was definitely better than 2021, but that isn’t saying much as 2021 was easily the worst year for movies in my entire life. To give an indication of how bad things were in 2021, last year The Mickeys™® were almost cancelled because the nominating committee couldn’t make a list of top five films due to the fact that there weren’t five good films that came out all year.\n\nAs far as the future is concerned, one can only cling to the hope that the ever-so-slight upward trend in cinema quality from 2021 to 2022 continues and that the three years ahead of us end up being better than the three unbelievably shitty years we’ve just slogged through.\n\nAm I optimistic? God no! But at least as I wallow in my depression I’m setting myself up for the wondrous experience of being pleasantly surprised. As my cavalcade of girlfriends can attest, I am extremely fond of saying, “the key to happiness is low expectations.”\n\nBefore we get started…a quick rundown of the rules and regulations of The Mickeys™®. The Mickeys™® are selected by me. I am judge, jury and executioner. The only films eligible are films I have actually seen, be it in the theatre, via screener, cable, streamer or VOD. I do not see every film because as we all know, the overwhelming majority of films are God-awful, and I am a working man so I must be pretty selective. So that means that just getting me to actually watch your movie is a tremendous accomplishment in and of itself…never mind being nominated or winning!\n\nThe Prizes!! The winners of The Mickey™® award will receive one acting coaching session with me FOR FREE!!! Yes…you read that right…FOR FREE!! Non-acting category winners receive a free lunch* with me at Fatburger (*lunch is considered one \"sandwich\" item, one order of small fries, you aren't actors so I know you can eat carbs, and one beverage….yes, your beverage can be a shake, you fat bastards). Actors who win and don't want an acting coaching session but would prefer the lunch…can still go straight to hell…but I am legally obligated to inform you that, yes, there WILL BE SUBSTITUTIONS allowed with The Mickey™® Awards prizes. If you want to go to lunch, I will gladly pay for your meal…and the sterling conversation will be entirely free of charge.\n\nEnough with the formalities…let's start the festivities!!\n\nPopcorn Movie of the Year\n\nThe Batman – Matt Reeves wrote and directed the most recent sojourn into the world of the Batman and his film is a unique and original venture in a genre worn thin by its relentless and ridiculous repetition.\n\nThe Northman – Robert Eggers attempt at a Norse action movie is as weird as you’d expect it to be. While uneven, the film is a gloriously ambitious and smart action film that audiences were too stupid to understand.\n\nPrey – I assumed Prey was going to be just another empty-headed franchise movie. It wasn’t. It was an original take on the well-worn Predator movies that revitalized the franchise.\n\nAnd The Mickey™® goes to…THE BATMAN\n\nBest Cinematography\n\nAll Quiet on the Western Front – James Friend – Friend’s work on All Quiet is simply astounding as he captured the scope and scale of war while also conveying the deeply intimate impact of it. Just beautifully photographed.\n\nThe Batman – Grieg Fraser – Fraser’s work on The Batman is at times absolutely stunning. His use of light in darkness paints some of the most extraordinary visuals in any film this year.\n\nThe Banshees of Inisherin – Ben Davis – Davis makes the most of his Irish setting through the use of fundamentally sound cinematography.\n\nTar – Florian Hoffmeister – Hoffmeister’s framing is simply exquisite as he turns the mundane into delicious pieces of cinema.\n\nAnd The Mickey™® goes to…ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT\n\nBest Supporting Actor\n\nBrendan Gleeson – The Banshees of Inisherin: Gleeson is one of the best actors around and he brings the full force of his skill to his role of Colm, the dissatisfied musician tired of the ordinary life. Gleeson elevates every scene he inhabits.\n\nBarry Keoghan – The Banshees of Inisherin: Keoghan’s work as Dominic, the fragile and combustible young man trapped in his life on the small isle of Inisherin, is at times stunning. The scene where he asks a girl to be with him is one of the very best captured on film this year.\n\nAnd The Mickey™® goes to…BRENDAN GLEESON\n\nBest Supporting Actress\n\nKerry Condon – The Banshees of Inisherin: Condon perfectly captures the frustration and futility of life as an Irish woman surrounded by the hell that is Irish men.\n\nAnd The Mickey™® goes to…KERRY CONDON\n\nBest Screenplay\n\nThe Banshees of Inisherin – Martin McDonagh: McDonagh’s screenplay is ridiculous and absurd at times, but it never fails to perfectly capture the civil war raging in the hearts and minds of every Irishman.\n\nTriangle of Sadness – Ruben Ostlund: On its surface, Triangle of Sadness is a rather banal and somewhat predictable criticism of American capitalism (a criticism I agree with by the way), but just beneath this surface is as smart, savvy and savage a social satire as seen on big screens in ages.\n\nGuillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio: Del Toro turns the well-worn story of the puppet come to life into a fascinating tale of love, loss and fascism. As relevant a story as we saw all year.\n\nAnd The Mickey goes to…TRIANGLE OF SADNESS\n\nBest Scene of the Year\n\nThe Banshees of Inisherin – When Barry Keoghan’s Dominic professes his love for Kerry Condon’s Siobhan, it is absolutely heartbreaking and gut-wrenching. Both Keoghan and Condon absolutely crush this scene.\n\nTar – When Cate Blanchett’s Lydia Tar tries to teach a simple-minded social justice woke warrior about the complexity of life and music in this ten-minute uncut scene, it is simply mesmerizing. The actor playing opposite Blanchett, Zethphan Smith-Gneist, is so uncomfortable (either intentionally or unintentionally) in the role as to be glorious. Just one of those unbelievably magical scenes that make cinema so wondrous.\n\nAll Quiet on the Western Front – The scene where Paul is stuck in a bomb crater with a French soldier is absolutely hellacious as it shows war as a humanity crushing machine. It is a perfect encapsulation of this film and its anti-war message.\n\nAnd The Mickey goes to…TAR\n\nBest Actress\n\nCate Blanchett – Tar : There is no other option in this category. Blanchett is the best actress of her generation and maybe every other generation too. Blanchett’s skill and mastery of craft are sublime, and her raw talent is undeniable. Just a master class of master classes in terms of great acting.\n\nAnd The Mickey goes to…CATE BLANCHETT – TAR\n\nBest Actor\n\nFelix Kammerer – All Quiet on the Western Front: A deft portrayal of the horrors of war that hollows out the human soul. Kammerer never loses his edge or his innate sense of humanity in this role.\n\nColin Farrell – The Banshees of Inisherin: Farrell’s work as the dim-witted, sad-sack Padraic is astonishing considering he was little more than a rather dim-witted, Hollywood pretty boy not that long ago. Farrell has grown into a terrific actor of quality and worth over the last decade or so and he puts it all together in this most subtle and deft portrayal.\n\nAnd The Mickey™® goes to…COLIN FARRELL – THE BANSHEES OF INISHERIN\n\nActor/Actress of the Year\n\nCOLIN FARRELL – In 2022 Farrell not only excelled as the lead in The Banshees of Inisherin, but he was also terrific in The Batman as the Penguin, and even elevated a rather mundane Ron Howard movie with a simple yet subtle turn as one of the divers who saves kids trapped in a cave in Thirteen Lives. Farrell has come a long way, and he now has not one but two Mickey™® awards to prove his greatness.\n\nBest Director\n\nRuben Ostlund – Triangle of Sadness: Ostlund the director had to somehow bring to the screen the wild, unwieldly, sprawling story written by Ostlund the screenwriter…and he does it with a panache and deft touch that is breathtaking to behold.\n\nMartin McDonagh – The Banshees of Inisherin: McDonagh is a better writer than he is a director, but on Banshees he lets simplicity be his guide and the result is an extremely well-made movie that never gets in its own way.\n\nGuillermo del Toro – Pinocchio: Del Toro infuses such life and energy into this old story, and does it with the most beautiful stop-motion animation imaginable, that one can only bow to his enormous talent and extraordinary artistic vision.\n\nEdward Berger – All Quiet on the Western Front: Berger perfectly captures the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual hell that is war. An unrelenting film that is as relevant today as the stellar original was back in 1930.\n\nAnd The Mickey™® goes to…Edward Berger – All Quiet on the Western Front\n\nBest Picture\n\n8. Barbarian – The first two acts of this film are spectacularly well-made, but the third act falters. Still, was a pleasant surprise to see such a well-crafted horror film.\n\n7. The Menu – A crisp and entertaining bit of class warfare moviemaking that featured some solid performances. Not a perfect movie but compelling.\n\n6. The Batman – Matt Reeves proves himself to be a solid captain for the good ship Caped Crusader. His unorthodox approach and storytelling are a bit of fresh air in the oversaturated superhero genre.\n\n5. Tar – 2/3rd of a great movie. The final act falls short but Blanchett’s brilliance is undeniable.\n\n4. Triangle of Sadness – So much more than it appears to be. A funny, but insightful and incisive social satire that pulls no punches towards anyone.\n\n3. Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio – A deeply moving, mournful meditation on life and loss.\n\n2. The Banshees of Inisherin – Fantastically acted story that speaks to our current time and to the burden of Irishness.\n\n1. All Quiet on the Western Front – Astonishingly well-made film. It isn’t perfect, but it overcomes its shortcomings by brutally conveying the fact that war is hell and only demons want it.\n\nMost Important Film of the Year\n\nAll Quiet on the Western Front – In case you haven’t heard, there’s a war going on In Ukraine. Most Americans have been so thoroughly propagandized and indoctrinated that they are chomping at the bit to get the U.S. even more entangled in this bloody war.\n\nAll Quiet on the Western Front is a powerful reminder that that idea is a very bad one. War is hell, and only demons want it…and the U.S. has nothing but demonic elites running the show.\n\nWatching liberals, with whom I proudly marched against the Iraq War in 2003, now be so blinded by relentless propaganda, misinformation, disinformation…is both astonishing and infuriating.\n\nThese dupes, dopes and dumb asses have been thoroughly manipulated into a myopic, vicious anti-Russian mania that is breathtaking to behold.\n\nThe reality is that all these dipshits who proudly display the Ukrainian flag in their bios don’t have half a fucking clue when it comes to Russia, Ukraine and this awful war.\n\nMost of these morons, and most of Americans, have absolutely no idea what started this war – the U.S. backed coup in 2014.\n\nAmericans think their Ukrainian flag waving is in support of “democracy”, but they’re ignorant to the fact that a democratically elected Ukrainian government was overthrown in the coup that the U.S. instigated and fueled in 2014. They also have no knowledge of the 46 ethnic Russians burned alive in the Odessa Union House – and no clue that the burning alive of Russians is particularly triggering since the Nazis did the same thing in occupied Soviet territories back in the day.\n\nThese same Americans are ignorant to the fact that the newly installed, U.S. backed, post-coup Ukrainian government proceeded to shell ethnic Russians in the Donbas, killing 14,000 men, women and children. They are also blissfully unaware that this U.S. backed Ukrainian government signed a peace accord, the Minsk Agreements, with Russia in 2014 and then intentionally violated these agreements breaking the peace. These same fools are also unaware that Ukraine, the alleged bastion of democracy, outlawed the Russian language, Russian language media, and opposition parties after the 2014 coup that toppled a democratically elected government.\n\nAmericans don’t know any of this, or they reflexively call it “Russian propaganda”, because they’ve been sold a narrative and are too stupid or too cowardly to push back against it.\n\nHow many lies about the war in Ukraine have these idiots swallowed whole? There’s the Ghost of Kiev bullshit, the Snake Island nonsense, the continuous claims of Russian massacres and war crimes – like Bucha – which are obvious pieces of unsubstantiated propaganda.\n\nThen there’s the endless stories of massive Russian defeats and retreats, with hundreds of thousands of dead Russian soldiers…except the actual numbers are the exact opposite of what the U.S. media claims. The truth is that for every one Russian soldier killed there are ten Ukrainian soldiers killed.\n\nThen there’s the breathless stories the U.S. media keeps telling Americans about Putin on death’s door, suffering from cancer or Parkinsons or both.\n\nThe U.S. media report Russian retreats as catastrophic failures and turn around and call Ukrainian retreats “strategic withdrawals”.\n\nThen there’s the media deification of a two-bit twat like Zelensky, who is the new Fauci…in other words a con artist and bullshitter used to front a phony narrative.\n\nThe coverage of this war has been the most blatantly dishonest propaganda spewed by the American misinformation machine I’ve ever witnessed…which is quite an accomplishment.\n\nWhich brings us to All Quiet on the Western Front. This movie lays bare the atrocity that is war and how it is a money-making machine that devours any humanity within its reach. The problem now is that Americans are so stupid and so ill-informed and so indoctrinated, that they are yearning for the U.S. to get more involved…which will only lead to copious amounts of misery for everyone involved.\n\nWe never learn. We didn’t learn from Vietnam. We didn’t learn from Afghanistan. We didn’t learn from Iraq. And now we are sleepwalking into a ground war with a nuclear power over what it deems to be a pivotal piece of property directly on its border.\n\nThe same is true of China and Taiwan by the way, which is next up on our propaganda list. There are already establishment geniuses and flag-waving fools banging the drums of war against China. I mean, why start one major ground war when you can lose on two fronts while your empire crumbles?\n\nThe reality is that the U.S. is not the good guy in the world…and most certainly not in the war in Ukraine. That doesn’t mean the Russians are the good guys…or the bad guys…they are just the guys fighting for their existential survival in a vital part of their neighborhood. What this all means for Americans is that this is a very complex, very dangerous situation which we are much too obtuse and too narcissistic to ever fully comprehend.\n\nThe truth is that Russia is winning in Ukraine…and has been winning all along. The truth is also that the U.S. empire is flailing and falling, and the BRICS are ascendant and will be the counter balance in a multi-polar, post-U.S. empire world. We need to understand this thoroughly in order to navigate it and not end up living in a post-apocalyptic, Mad Max world.\n\nI’m not optimistic. And after watching All Quiet on the Western Front and seeing the astonishing gullibility and brutal barbarity of mankind, you shouldn’t be either.\n\nAnd thus ends my rant and the 2022 Mickey Awards, the most prestigious of all cinema awards shows.\n\nThanks for reading and we’ll see you at the after-party!!\n\nFOLLOW ME ON TWITTER: @MPMActingCo\n\n©2023\n\nIt’s that time of year again!! The Oscars are here and I think I speak for everyone on the planet when I say…nobody gives a fuck!\n\nIt is a testament to how far the film industry and art of cinema has fallen in recent years that I find myself neither excited nor angered over this year’s Oscar nominations. No, my overwhelming sentiment regarding movies in general and the Oscars in particular is numbing indifference. I just don’t care anymore.\n\nYou see, my cinephile spirit has simply been broken under the weight of our cultures repeated cinematic failures. I’m one of those foolish people who demands excellence from cinema and refuses to soften my standards in order to indulge a commitment to mediocrity. This has resulted in my being a rather brutal cinematic curmudgeon for the past three years, which have been the worst three years of my movie-watching lifetime.\n\nOther critics have been all too eager to conform to the current times and adjust (lower) their standards. This is how we get fawning reviews of inconceivably atrocious shit like The Fabelmans and Top Gun: Maverick. Those movies are true embarrassments and it speaks to our decadent age – which is indicative of an empire in steep decay and decline, that they are held up as wondrous cinematic achievements.\n\nTo be clear, this past year was better than the previous year, but that’s sort of like being proud that you’re the tallest midget in the freak show.\n\nWhat is so unnerving about the recent decline in cinema is that it was just four short years ago, in 2019, when cinema seemed to be in tremendous shape. That year we had a truly phenomenal film, Parasite, win Best Picture, beating out an array of interesting and well-made movies for the honor. Among them The Irishman, Joker, Ford v Ferrari, 1917 and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Any one of those film would be the run-away Best Picture winner this year.\n\nBut since the heights of 2019 we’ve been inundated with garbage. The low point being when Coda, an absolutely ridiculous, Hall Mark Channel level movie, won Best Picture last year.\n\nThe problem is not that bad movies win Oscars, that’s been going on time immemorial. No, the problem is that there’s no movies to get angry over for not having been recognized or honored. When Coda won last year, I just shrugged because I had no dog in the fight.\n\nP.T. Anderson had a film, Licorice Pizza, competing against Coda, and he is one of my all-time favorite filmmakers so it would’ve been nice if he won but truthfully, Licorice Pizza wasn’t any good and I wasn’t going to pretend it was…so I didn’t care.\n\nThe same is true this year. There’s no movie that I think stands out that it would be a crime if it was overlooked.\n\nYes, I liked All Quiet on the Western Front and The Banshees of Inisherin, but I just liked them, not loved them. They are flawed but “enjoyable” movies, so I’m not going into Oscar night yearning for their recognition.\n\nThe ugly truth is that I am so indifferent to the Oscars this year, and have become so disenchanted with cinema, that I’m not even going to watch the ceremony, which will be a first for me in my adulthood. The reality is that I have much better things to do, sleep definitely among them, than watch a delusional industry give shitty movies awards for excellence.\n\nThat said, I will still fill out my Oscar picks and compete in my Oscar pool, which I have won for a record 34 years in a row. Will I continue my astonishing streak? Probably, but not because I have any clue who will win the awards but more because my competitors care even less than me so they have no clue.\n\nOk…so there’s my sad tale of disillusionment and disenchantment. Now let’s get on to my Oscar picks and put this terrible year in movies behind once and for all.\n\nBEST PICTURE\n\nTar – A very flawed but fascinating character study that features the best scene of the year but also the worst third act.\n\nThe Fabelmans – An utter embarrassment of a movie. Is the cinematic equivalent of Spielberg soiling himself in public.\n\nEverything Everywhere All at Once – A mildly interesting, pretty trite popcorn movie that has no business being nominated, nevermind the odds-on favorite.\n\nAll Quiet on the Western Front – A visually stirring anti-war epic when we need an anti-war epic most. Is the best made movie of the bunch.\n\nWomen Talking – This is a bad movie.\n\nTriangle of Sadness – An ambitious and audacious social satire that is actually smarter than it appears at first glance.\n\nAvatar the Way of Water – a big, blue billion-dollar behemoth that is almost instantly forgettable.\n\nTop Gun Maverick – People’s love for this pile of poop astonishes me. It’s like people know it’s awful yet love it for its awfulness.\n\nElvis – An absurd piece of junk.\n\nBanshees of Inisherin – A flawed but fascinating study of Irish masculinity.\n\nThis seems pretty set in stone…but I guess there’s a miniscule chance of an upset, which if it occurs would be All Quiet winning or maybe, maybe Tar.\n\nShould Win: All Quiet on the Western Front/Banshees of Inisherin\n\nWill Win: Everything Everywhere All At Once\n\nBEST ACTOR\n\nAustin Butler – Elvis – The kid is good as Elvis, really good. But it feels more like a lived-in imitation than a piece of acting.\n\nBrendan Fraser – The Whale – The dirty little secret is that Fraser isn’t acting particularly well under that fat suit.\n\nColin Farrell – Banshees of Inisherin – Farrell has matured into a terrific actor and his work here is intricate and detailed.\n\nPaul Mescal – Aftersun – I don’t get the hype over this kid.\n\nBill Nighy – Living – Nighy is great in general but I’ve not seen this movie.\n\nThis is one of the more up in the air awards of the night. A lot of people have Fraser winning but I just think there’s a ground swell for Austin Butler.\n\nShould Win: Colin Farrell\n\nWill Win: Austin Butler\n\nBEST ACTRESS\n\nCate Blanchett – Tar – Blanchett is the best actress of her generation and absolutely crushes it in this movie.\n\nMichelle Yeoh – EEAAO – She’s…fine.\n\nAna de Armas – Blonde – Starring in torture porn is tough work, but the reality is that Ana de Armas shouldn’t have been playing Marylin.\n\nAndrea Riseborough – To Leslie – I like Andrea Riseborough but like the rest of the human race I’ve not seen this movie.\n\nMichelle Williams – The Fabelmans – Williams is an at times pleasant actress but she is truly atrocious in The Fabelmans. This is bad. Really bad.\n\nIt seems the tide has turned against Blanchett and in favor of Yeoh. What can you do?\n\nShould Win: Cate Blanchett\n\nWill Win: Michelle Yeoh\n\nSUPPORTING ACTOR\n\nBrendan Gleeson – Banshees of Inisherin – Gleeson is an outstanding actor and he is terrific in this.\n\nBarry Keoghan – Banshees – Keoghan is a little uneven in this role but he does bring it all together in the second best scene in the year in cinema.\n\nBrian Tyree Henry – Causeway – This is a joke. This movie stunk and Henry wasn’t very good in it.\n\nJudd Hirsch – The Fabelmans – A bloated cameo of dubious quality.\n\nKe Huy Quan – EEAAO – I never thought Quan could be as good as he is in this movie. A really remarkable performance.\n\nShould Win: Gleeson, Keoghan, Quan\n\nWill Win: Quan\n\nSUPPORTING ACTRESS\n\nAngela Bassett – Wakanda Forever – I don’t get it. This movie stinks and she is not good in it.\n\nHong Chau – The Whale – Another head-shaker…Chau was much better in The Menu than in this.\n\nKerry Condon – Banshees of Inisherin – A terrific and layered performance that perfectly captures the hell of Irish womanhood.\n\nJamie Lee Curtis – EEAAO – I actually really liked Curtis in this role.\n\nStephanie Hsu – EEAAO – I thought Hsu was ok.\n\nIt seemed like Angela Bassett was going to run away with it but the tide has turned in Jamie Lee’s favor.\n\nShould Win: Kerry Condon\n\nWill Win: Jamie Lee Curtis\n\nORIGINAL SCREENPLAY\n\nBanshees of Insherin – Terrific screenplay.\n\nEEAAO – The film’s underlying philosophy is trite but it’s a sprawling story that eventually works.\n\nThe Fabelmans – This is junk. A dreadful script makes a dreadful movie.\n\nTar – A great forst two acts are scuttled by a rushed and unearned third act.\n\nTriangle of Sadness – This script is fantastic.\n\nThis is sort of interesting as The Fabelmans may win because the Academy wants to reward Spielberg for his truly shitty autobiography. That said, I still think that EEAAO wins.\n\nShould Win: Banshees of Inisherin\n\nWill Win: Everything Everywhere All At Once\n\nADAPTED SCREENPLAY\n\nAll Quiet on the Western Front – Not perfect but overall well executed.\n\nGlass Onion – identical twins? Oh please. This script is dogshit.\n\nLiving – Haven’t seen it.\n\nTop Gun Maverick – This is a joke.\n\nWomen Talking – Brutal.\n\nThe academy want to reward a woman and Sarah Polley fits the bill with her egregiously awful Woman Talking script.\n\nShould Win: All Quiet on the Western Front\n\nWill Win: Women Talking\n\nBEST DIRECTOR\n\nMartin McDonagh – Banshees of Inisherin – Nice to see McDonagh bounce back from the shit that was Three Billboards.\n\nThe Daniels – EEAAO – Not great but they somewhat pulled off an ambitious idea.\n\nSteven Spielberg – The Fabelmans – This movie stinks so bad it shocked me that Spielberg released it.\n\nTodd Field – Tar – Well directed but loses its grip in the third act.\n\nRuben Ostland – Triangle of Sadness – Shockingly well directed movie that in lesser hands would’ve been an absolute mess.\n\nShould Win: Martin McDonagh\n\nWill Win: The Daniels\n\nBEST INTERNATIONAL FILM\n\nAll Quiet on the Western Front\n\nArgentina, 1985\n\nClose\n\nEO\n\nThe Quiet Girl\n\nShould Win: All Quiet on the Western Front\n\nWill Win: All Quiet on the Western Front\n\nBEST ANIMATED FEATURE FILM\n\nGuillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio\n\nMarcel the Shell with Shoes On\n\nPuss in Boots\n\nThe Sea Beast\n\nSeeing Red\n\nShould Win: Pinocchio\n\nWill Win: Pinocchio – This is a terrific movie, one of the best of the year.\n\nBEST DOCUMENTARY FEATURE\n\nAll That Breathes\n\nAll the Beauty and the Bloodshed\n\nFire of Love\n\nA House Made of Splinters\n\nNavalny\n\nWill Win: Navalny – Just feels like the academy will want to signal its virtue by thumbing their nose at the supposed Hitler du jour Vladimir Putin. How brave.\n\nDOCUMENTARY SHORT\n\nThe Elephant Whisperers\n\nHaulout\n\nHow Do You Measure a Year\n\nThe Martha Mitchell Effect\n\nStranger at the Gate\n\nWill Win: Elephant Whisperers\n\nLIVE ACTION SHORT\n\nAn irish Goodbye\n\nIvalu\n\nLe pupille\n\nNight Ride\n\nThe Red Suitcase\n\nWILL WIN: Le pupille\n\nANIMATED SHORT\n\nThe Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse\n\nThe Flying Sailor\n\nIce Merchants\n\nMy Year of Dicks\n\nAn Ostrich Told Me the World is Fake and I Think I Believe It\n\nWill Win: The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse\n\nORIGINAL SCORE\n\nAll Quiet on the Western Front\n\nBabylon\n\nThe Banshees of Inisherin\n\nEEAAO\n\nThe Fabelmans\n\nWill Win: All Quiet on the Western Front – The score of this film is crucial in setting the ominous and unsettling mood.\n\nORIGINAL SONG\n\nApplause – Tell it Like a Woman\n\nHold My Hand - Top Gun Maverick\n\nLift Me Up - Wakanda Forever\n\nNaatu Naatu - RRR\n\nThis is Life - EEAAO\n\nWill Win: Naatu Naatu\n\nPRODUCTION DESIGN\n\nAll Quiet on the Western Front\n\nAvatar The Way of Water\n\nBabylon\n\nElvis\n\nThe Fabelmans\n\nShould Win: All Quiet on the Western Front\n\nWill Win: Elvis – This is the type of movie that the Oscars reward.\n\nBEST SOUND\n\nAll Quiet on the Western Front\n\nAvatar the Way of Water\n\nThe Batman\n\nElvis\n\nTop Gun Maverick\n\nWill Win: Top Gun Maverick – This feels like the Academy throwing this fan favorite a bone.\n\nCINEMATOGRAPHY\n\nAll Quiet on the Western Front\n\nBardo\n\nElvis\n\nEmpire of Light\n\nTar\n\nWill Win: All Quiet on the Western Front – Easily the best cinematography of the year.\n\nCOSTUME DESIGN\n\nBabylon\n\nWakanda Forever\n\nElvis\n\nEEAAO\n\nMrs Harris Goes to Paris\n\nWill Win: Elvis – There’s a chance that Wakanda Forever or Babylon win, but it seems like Elvis will do well in these types of categories.\n\nMAKEUP & HAIRSTYLE\n\nAll Quiet on the Western Front\n\nThe Batman\n\nWakanda Forever\n\nElvis\n\nThe Whale\n\nWill Win: Elvis – Wakanda Forever is a real possibility but again, Elvis is adored for stuff like this.\n\nFILM EDITING\n\nBanshees of Inisherin\n\nElvis\n\nEEAAO\n\nTar\n\nTop Gun Maverick\n\nWill Win: EEAAO – I actually thought the editing (or lack thereof) was one of the worst parts of EEAAO, but what the hell do I know?\n\nVISUAL EFFECTS\n\nAll Quiet on the Western Front\n\nAvatar The Way of Water\n\nThe Batman\n\nWakanda Forever\n\nTop Gun Maverick\n\nWill Win: Avatar the Way of Water – This is a bone thrown to big Jim Cameron for his money printing machine.\n\nAnd thus concludes my Oscar picks. God willing every Oscar winner gets slapped on stage this year. If that happens then I promise I’ll actually watch the show next year. A man can dream.\n\n©2023"
