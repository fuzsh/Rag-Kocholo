        "text": "One of my big regrets as a lifelong moviegoer is that I never thought to take pictures of movie theaters I visited until all of the ones I remember most fondly were gone. When I think back to the varied theaters I attended in the Bronx from the late 1950s to the mid-1970s, I wish I had pictures of them and the marquees displaying the films I saw. Granted, there was only a brief period when I had a good camera and the ability to photograph some of these theaters in the 1970s, but I could have gotten pictures of 13 of them while they were still functioning. Not to mention the theaters I visited in Manhattan during those years. And when I got another good camera in 1981, I could have photographed other theaters I attended in the Bronx as well as in Manhattan, particularly in Times Square and 42nd Street. Now all I can do is embark on Google searches and when I find photos of Bronx theaters, they tend to be quite old, from long before my time.\n\nI did take a few pictures in Times Square in 1970 and again in the 1980s, but I never thought to keep a systematic record. I knew damn well these theaters weren’t going to last forever and that the Times Square clean-up was imminent. Here’s one shot I took of a Times Square marquee displaying a film I saw there (TOTAL RECALL), but I only took the picture because they were changing the marquee:\n\nAnd the weird thing is that I actually thought to do it once in the 1970s—but it was in San Francisco in December 1973, when my older brother and I went to the Alhambra to see this double bill:\n\nInterestingly, THE SEVEN-UPS boasted lots of scenes shot in the Bronx around locations familiar to us, so it was nice for us to get a taste of home on my first trip across the country.\n\nHere are shots I took in Times Square in 1970, but I made the foolish decision to develop the pictures myself using a home darkroom kit I shared with a friend and that’s why they look so bad (chemistry was never my strong point):\n\nAnd a shot I took of 42nd Street in 1985 (although I didn’t actually go into any of the theaters that day):\n\nI didn’t really start taking pictures of theaters and marquees systematically until just a few years ago, but by then the marquees were far blander and less dramatic than they used to be, and most of the activity was in Manhattan, since there’s basically only one movie theater left in the Bronx that I attend. There’s far less showmanship by theater owners than there used to be.\n\nThis is what we used to see on marquees in Manhattan:\n\nThis is what we have now:\n\nAnd here’s what New York’s newest independent arthouse, the Metrograph, looks like on the outside:\n\nThe first time I went there, I kept walking past it, wondering where the hell the theater was.\n\nWhat I did keep as a record of my moviegoing in the Bronx was a collection of ticket stubs. I found an old envelope of them recently and isolated stubs from 18 different theaters I went to in the Bronx, in the 1960s and ’70s.\n\nPlease note that the Capri, the U.A. Capri and the Lido were all the same single-screen theater. (It was the discovery of the envelope with these and other ticket stubs that prompted this piece.) There are a few theaters missing from this collection that I simply don’t have stubs for.\n\nI also kept clippings of newspaper ads, including several for films and double features I attended. I saw this double bill at one of the theaters listed in the ad, the Surrey. It was the last movie trip I made in my old neighborhood while I was still living there.\n\nNotice that the double bill is also playing at one of the major Broadway movie palaces, the Rivoli, and a 42nd Street grindhouse as well, despite the fact that by this point both of these films had already played on TV where I’d already seen them more than once. I had missed them during their initial theatrical runs in 1959 and 1960–neither my older siblings nor my parents were interested enough to take me–so I was happy to finally see them on the big screen.\n\nI went to see DAUGHTERS OF DARKNESS (1971) with a group of friends one Friday night in July 1971 at the Devon theater, which is listed in the ad with an asterisk, indicating a different second feature from the one shown in the ad.\n\nThe co-feature we got to see was Laslo Benedek’s THE NIGHT VISITOR (1971), an English-language Swedish-U.S. co-production filmed in Denmark and Sweden, with Max von Sydow, Liv Ullmann, and Trevor Howard. I think we got a better deal than those who attended the other theaters. A tidy thriller about a mental patient who has a clever method of escaping from his cell and returning to it undetected all so he can enact various acts of vengeance without being suspected, THE NIGHT VISITOR was actually better than the main feature, an arty vampire movie with bisexual overtones. DAUGHTERS happened to be a Belgian-French-German co-production and it had a classy sheen to it, as well as a most glamorous vampire in Delphine Seyrig, but it was short on thrills and shocks, despite what Howard Thompson says in the blurb.\n\nStill, a European double bill with casts like these indicates just how wide the range of films that came to neighborhood theaters once was.\n\nI saw this double bill at the Art Jerome, listed in the ad, and wrote about it here in my piece on the Blaxploitation era:\n\nI saw this double bill at the Earl, which was just east of the old Yankee Stadium:\n\nThis time we got the second feature listed in the ad. Now, I’m wondering what the Loew’s American was playing.\n\nAnd I saw this single feature at one of the theaters listed, the Luxor:\n\nThis Brandt’s movie guide from 1971 lists five of my neighborhood theaters, all but the Beacon, and all of which were in walking distance from my home. I did in fact see GONE WITH THE WIND at the Kent during this run.\n\nThis Movie Guide from the New York Post listing Bronx theaters shows one double bill I attended that week (August 1972): SHAFT’S BIG SCORE and THE HOUSE OF DARK SHADOWS at the Art (aka the Art Jerome).\n\nTHE GODFATHER is listed as still playing at the Loew’s Paradise, where I’d seen it in June. (Some films stayed in theaters a long time back then.) But look at all the movie theaters we once had–and this is but a fraction of the number of theaters the borough had in the 1930s and ’40s. Now, we’re down to two multiplexes.\n\nGoing back to my earliest moviegoing, the first theater I attended as a child was the Crotona on Tremont Avenue. The first film I saw at the Crotona that had a real impact on me–I was five years old–was THE SEVENTH VOYAGE OF SINBAD (1958), with special effects by Ray Harryhausen, which I’ve revisited many times since.\n\nI also saw SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS (1937) there, along with several other Disney animated features either new (SLEEPING BEAUTY) or in reissue (PINOCCHIO, PETER PAN, CINDERELLA).\n\nTHE SNOW QUEEN (1960), a darkly vivid Russian animated feature dubbed into English by three young celebrity actors, played on a double bill with the black-and-white Korean War movie, BATTLE FLAME (1959). I was six years old when I saw SNOW QUEEN and the film’s tragic, melancholic tone left a much greater impression on me than most of the Disney animated features and I believe that memory is what compelled me to seek out Japanese animation years later.\n\nJET OVER THE ATLANTIC played on a double bill with GOLIATH AND THE BARBARIANS. It was a thriller about some kind of poisonous substance leaking out on an airplane in flight and I found it much more memorable than the Italian spectacle, which starred Steve “Hercules” Reeves.\n\nThis is the only picture I can find of the Crotona, which I only attended for about three years:\n\nI had to look up THE DESERT SONG to see how many versions there were and, judging from the age of the car, I’m guessing this was the 1929 version, nearly 30 years before I went there.\n\nThe Crotona closed up for good in 1960 and was converted into a bowling alley and then a furniture store which, last time I checked, was still in business, so we started trudging further up Tremont Avenue to the Deluxe on Belmont Avenue, where the first double bill I saw was THE LOST WORLD and YOUNG JESSE JAMES, both 1960.\n\nWe also started visiting the Fairmount, a block past the Deluxe, where the first films we saw were JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH (1959) and THE ADVENTURES OF HUCKLEBERRY FINN (1960):\n\nHere are stills from a memorable double bill I saw at the Fairmount in August 1967, the first time I paid adult price at a movie theater, Roger Corman’s THE ST. VALENTINE’S DAY MASSACRE and Mario Bava’s PLANET OF THE VAMPIRES:\n\nI saw my very first Italian western at my next-to-last trip to the Fairmount before it closed in 1969:\n\nThis is the only decent picture I could find of the Fairmount, and it goes back quite a few decades:\n\nThe only picture I could find of the Deluxe is from its phase as a “nudie” theater (pre-dating porno). This picture dates from 1968, not long after the theater converted. It later switched to full triple-X porno.\n\nIn 1972, the Deluxe returned to showing regular Hollywood films and I began going there again. Among the memorable films I saw there in the 1970s were these:\n\nAnd this unforgettable double feature:\n\nIn the spring of 1962, we began going to the Tremont Theater on Webster Avenue, a block-and-a-half west of the Crotona. It had long been a showcase for Italian and Greek movies, but converted that spring to showing American triple features, usually consisting of older releases along with dubbed Italian spectacles like THE TROJAN HORSE, my second Steve Reeves movie. The first triple feature there offered the Marlon Brando western, ONE-EYED JACKS, QUEEN OF OUTER SPACE, starring Zsa Zsa Gabor, and an archaic, semi-animated English-dubbed Czech film in black-and-white, THE FABULOUS WORLD OF JULES VERNE, making for quite a set of odd juxtapositions for a child audience. (And I can tell you that every kid in the neighborhood was there.) The only real crowd-pleaser was QUEEN OF OUTER SPACE (1958). The cost per child? 25 cents as long as you had a discount ticket picked up at a neighborhood shop. (The usual cost of a child’s admission at theaters in the neighborhood for much of the 1960s was 50 cents.)\n\nI saw many enjoyable movies there that summer, including THE MAGIC SWORD, FRANCIS IN THE NAVY, Abbott and Costello in JACK AND THE BEANSTALK, Irwin Allen’s FIVE WEEKS IN A BALLOON, Boris Karloff in THE BLACK CASTLE, Robert Aldrich’s THE LAST SUNSET, Anthony Mann’s BEND OF THE RIVER, and several exciting Italian spectacles including THE TROJAN HORSE, LAST OF THE VIKINGS (Cameron Mitchell), THE MONGOLS (Anita Ekberg and Jack Palance), THE MINOTAUR (Olympic athlete Bob Mathias), and CARTHAGE IN FLAMES. Plus, there were trailers for plenty of older films, including the Bob Hope comedy, THE PALEFACE (1948) and the 1954 epic, KNIGHTS OF THE ROUND TABLE. It was quite a journey into movie history.\n\nSometime the next year, the theater ended up showing Italian movies again and I distinctly remember seeing the poster for Luchino Visconti’s ROCCO AND HIS BROTHERS prominently displayed. It returned briefly to Hollywood films in the summer of 1966, and I went once more, this time to a triple bill of WEST SIDE STORY, GLADIATORS 7 (starring Richard Harrison, below) and a program of Three Stooges shorts.\n\nHere’s the only picture I could find of the Tremont, taken some decades before I attended.\n\nIn the summer of 1963, I made a point of consulting the movie ads in the paper and mapping out other theaters in the area, so I took a long walk one day and went out to locate them. I found the Devon on Tremont Avenue, the Ascot on the Grand Concourse, the Loew’s Paradise on the Grand Concourse and the RKO Fordham and UA Valentine on Fordham Road. My siblings and I all went to see JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS at the Loew’s Paradise the very next day. The Paradise was the premier movie palace of the Bronx and it boasted all kinds of impressive architectural details including a blue sky in its ceiling with little twinkling lights, and all kinds of statues around the premises. It was the first time I’d been in a theater that ornate. And the movie itself was pretty spectacular:\n\nHere’s a shot of the Paradise from the early 1970s, when I was a regular attendee:\n\nAnd a shot of the restored interior from over a decade ago:\n\nTwo months after discovering the Paradise, and after several more trips there (including another Marlon Brando film, MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY), we went to the Devon for the first time and saw WEST SIDE STORY, which I’d already seen at the Fairmount earlier in the year.\n\nI saw WEST SIDE STORY over 20 times at theaters in the Bronx and Manhattan from the years 1963 to 1971, including at least six theaters in the Bronx. For at least three of the theaters in the Bronx–the Devon, the Luxor and the Lido–and at least one in Manhattan–the Symphony–WEST SIDE STORY was the first film I saw at each of them.\n\nThis isn’t much, but it’s the only decent picture I could find of the Devon and it appears to have been taken around 1940:\n\nThat delicatessen was still there 30 years later.\n\nThe Devon had long been an arthouse (my mother went there by herself to see ROOM AT THE TOP) and even after it started showing regular Hollywood films, it still showed the occasional arthouse double bill. In researching an earlier version of this piece, I checked the New York Post movie guide for those years and found that in the week before I saw a double bill of THE GREAT ESCAPE and THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE in 1965, the Devon had run a double bill of Roman Polanski’s KNIFE IN THE WATER, from Poland, and Hiroshi Teshigahara’s WOMAN IN THE DUNES, from Japan. I probably saw more films at the Devon than at any other theater in the Bronx, a result of its convenient location, low admission price, and lots of double bills.\n\nSome of the films I saw there in the nine years I regularly attended, using posters offered freely by the Harry Ransom Center Movie Posters Digital Collection at The University of Texas at Austin:\n\nIn keeping with the Devon’s arthouse history, this is a rather different range of films from the ones I saw at the Crotona, the Tremont, the Deluxe and the Fairmount.\n\nMy first trip to the RKO Fordham was by myself in the spring of 1964 to see a double bill of Raoul Walsh’s last film, A DISTANT TRUMPET, a cavalry western starring Troy Donahue and Suzanne Pleshette, and the second Beach Party film, MUSCLE BEACH PARTY, starring Frankie Avalon, Annette Funicello and Luciana Paluzzi.\n\nHere’s a pic of the Fordham promoting an earlier film starring Troy Donahue, although I’m not sure which one, since he co-starred with Connie Stevens more than once:\n\nAnd an older shot of the Fordham:\n\nMy first trip to the UA Valentine was probably MARY POPPINS, seen in 1965 on a class trip.\n\nA picture of the Valentine from the time I was going there. I did see the film on the marquee, VANISHING POINT, in the Bronx, but not at the Valentine:\n\nThe Loew’s Paradise, the Fordham, the Valentine and another theater on Fordham Road, the Capri (formerly known as the Lido), would become my neighborhood theaters once I moved away from home to share an apartment with a college buddy near Fordham Road.\n\nThe last films I saw at the Loew’s Paradise were THE SOLDIER (1982) and THE SWORD AND THE SORCERER (1982). The last film I saw at the Fordham was, I believe, a 1980 reissue of STAR WARS. The last film I saw at the Valentine was Clint Eastwood’s HEARTBREAK RIDGE (1986). The last film I saw at the Capri was WHERE THE BUFFALO ROAM (1980).\n\nI wouldn’t make my first trip to the Ascot until the summer of 1969 when a group of us went to see Franco Zeffirelli’s ROMEO AND JULIET (1968). I would later see Robert Downey’s counterculture classic PUTNEY SWOPE there, as well as John Avildsen’s JOE and a memorable double bill of SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE, based on a Kurt Vonnegut novel, and John Cassavetes’ MINNIE AND MOSKOWITZ. Like the Devon, it had arthouse roots also and the films I just described were closer to arthouse fare than anything you’d find at other Bronx theaters. As the neighborhood changed and arthouse and independent films proved less popular, the Ascot began showing more genre entertainment.\n\nThe last double bill I saw at the Ascot consisted of GODZILLA VS. MEGALON and the Sonny Chiba martial arts spectacular, THE KILLING MACHINE, in the summer of 1976. And, truth to tell, as groundbreaking and incisive as PUTNEY SWOPE and JOE were, I have revisited GODZILLA VS. MEGALON and THE KILLING MACHINE far more in the decades since.\n\nThe theater eventually converted to porno and after that was used as an evangelical church.\n\nShots of the Ascot from before, middle, and after:\n\nThe Art Jerome, one of the bigger theaters south of Fordham Road, was not that far from my home and just a few blocks west of the Devon, yet I didn’t visit it until early 1967 when I saw a double bill of ONE MILLION YEARS B.C. (1966), starring Raquel Welch and several dinosaurs animated by Ray Harryhausen, and the ultra-cheap spy movie, COME SPY WITH ME, starring Troy Donahue and featuring a theme song by Smokey Robinson. I would continue going to this theater for the next seven years, making my last trip there in August 1973 to see SCREAM BLACULA SCREAM and DAY OF ANGER.\n\nHere are posters of some of the films I saw at the Art Jerome:\n\nSome of my favorite films were first seen at the Art Jerome:\n\nAnd the final double bill I saw there:\n\nAs you can see, somewhat different fare from what I saw at the Devon. I saw almost as many movies at the Art as I did at the Devon.\n\nI couldn’t find any pictures of the Art Jerome in its heyday, but this is what it has looked like in recent years, after becoming a church:\n\nI’m not sure when I made my first trip to the Luxor on 170th Street and the Grand Concourse, but I know I saw WEST SIDE STORY there in the late 1960s and, at some point, DR. ZHIVAGO, as well as Michelangelo Antonioni’s first American film, the head-tripping ZABRISKIE POINT (1970); the X-rated 1969 Best Picture winner, MIDNIGHT COWBOY; Robert Altman’s BREWSTER MCCLOUD; the third Italian western I ever saw, DEATH RIDES A HORSE; as well as the documentary about Muhammad Ali, A.K.A. CASSIUS CLAY.\n\nAnd here’s the one picture I could find of the Luxor, but at least it’s from the period I attended. (I did see COLD TURKEY back then, but at the Devon.)\n\nThe Kent was on 167th Street just off the Concourse and the first film I saw there was Sergio Leone’s ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST (1969):\n\nCharles Bronson. What more can you ask?\n\nI would later see Robert Altman’s M*A*S*H there, as well as the aforementioned GONE WITH THE WIND and a Japanese samurai film called THE STEEL EDGE OF REVENGE, which was the English-dubbed version of Hideo Gosha’s GOYOKIN.\n\nAnd Tatsuya Nakadai. Does it get better than that? No.\n\nHere’s a shot of the Kent from the 1970s:\n\nThe Earl on 161st Street is the southernmost theater I attended in the Bronx (there’s a multiplex on that street now, further east, that I’ve yet to attend). It was right next to the Jerome Avenue elevated line (#4 train) on the other side of the tracks from Yankee Stadium. The first films I saw there were a double bill of THE LIBERATION OF L.B. JONES (1970) and EL DORADO (1967). LIBERATION was the last film by legendary Hollywood director William Wyler (THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES) and EL DORADO, a western with John Wayne and Robert Mitchum, was the next-to-last film directed by Howard Hawks. Both men’s careers had begun in the silent era. I would see Hawks’ last film, RIO LOBO, later that year at the Art Jerome.\n\nI also saw at the Earl, THE CHINESE CONNECTION, a Hong Kong kung fu film starring Bruce Lee. I saw it on June 8, 1973, a little over a month before Lee died in Hong Kong. It was on a double bill with THE MERCENARY, which I’d already seen once at the Art Jerome.\n\nThis is the only picture I could find of the Earl when it was a theater and dates back to around 1940:\n\nAnd here’s what it looked like in recent years. I even ate there once when I was on jury duty, since the Bronx County Courthouse is a couple of blocks away.\n\nHere’s what the Loew’s Paradise looks like now. It’s been restored to its former glory, but it’s used primarily as a church now by Creflo Dollar, “the American televangelist, pastor, and founder of the non-denominational World Changers Church International” (per Wikipedia).\n\nExcept for the World Changers sign, this is pretty much how it looked to the ten-year-old boy discovering it for the first time 55 years ago this summer:\n\nIn fact I almost missed it entirely on that first walk, since it didn’t have a marquee (zoning rules for the Grand Concourse).\n\nHere is a shot of the RKO Fordham being demolished:\n\nAnd a shot of the site today:\n\nAnd, across the street, a shot of the site of the Valentine today:\n\nThroughout the Bronx, theaters have been converted into furniture stores, discount stores, supermarkets and churches. I sometimes walk in them looking for traces of their movie theater origins. I went into the Bainbridge once when it had become a furniture store and found the manager’s office, just as it was when I went to complain one night about the arbitrary insertion of an intermission right in the middle of a scene in THE TOWERING INFERNO (1974), a film that wasn’t supposed to have an intermission. When I went into the discount store that used to be the Devon, one of the smallest theaters I ever attended in the Bronx, I found the basic layout had been retained. Here was where the ticket taker had been stationed, there was where the concession stand stood, this elevated portion here was the “balcony” (only a few steps up from the main floor), where I sat when I first saw GONE WITH THE WIND.\n\nThe Palace Theater in Parkchester, where I saw THE EXORCIST, is now a furniture store and the old marble wall with one of the original display cases where movie posters were placed still stands unchanged. (See second photo below)\n\nThe Globe on Pelham Parkway, where I took a date to see AMERICAN GRAFFITI (1973) and where I saw my first Bollywood movie in 2000, is now a supermarket:\n\nHere’s how the Globe looked in 1993:\n\nThe Loew’s American in Parkchester was the last theater originally built as a single screen that still functioned as a movie theater well into the 21st century, although it had been carved up into a multiplex years earlier. I saw THE DARK KNIGHT there in 2008, my last trip to a Bronx theater that had been built before the 1990s. It had just closed when I took these pictures in 2013:\n\nSo I continue to go to movie theaters, but not nearly as often as I used to. And I take pictures this time, but they don’t conjure up any special memories, nor do I think I’ll refer to them in blog entries decades from now (I should be so lucky). But every so often, I find something that reminds me of the glory days of movie theaters in New York, like the interior of the main screen of the City Cinema Village East at 12th Street and Second Avenue, which has retained much of the design of the original space, a Yiddish theater built in 1925 that has served as both a theater stage and movie theater off and on ever since. I went there a few times in the 1970s and remember seeing an enjoyable double bill of Martin Scorsese’s MEAN STREETS (1973) and Clint Eastwood’s THE OUTLAW JOSEY WALES (1976) back when it was called the Entermedia Theater. Most recently, I saw SHIN GODZILLA (2016) there and wrote about it here. Here are some shots I took then:\n\nFinally, a collection of movie stills from the National Screen Service illustrating some of the films I saw at neighborhood theaters covered in this piece. These are exactly the stills that would have been displayed along the walls of theater lobbies and the foyer around the cashier."
