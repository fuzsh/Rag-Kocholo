        "text": "\"Planet of the Apes\" Complete Franchise Streaming Now\n\nGet ready for this summer's blockbuster \"Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes\" by taking a deep dive into the sci-fi cult classic franchise. Binge watch the entire \"Planet of the Apes\" franchise on Hulu, perfectly timed for the theatrical release of \"Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,\" hitting theaters worldwide on May 10.\n\nAll nine prior films are now streaming on Hulu!\n\nWAR FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES (2017)\n\nCaesar (Andy Serkis) and his apes are forced into a deadly conflict with an army of humans led by a ruthless colonel (Woody Harrelson). After the apes suffer unimaginable losses, Caesar wrestles with his darker instincts and begins his own mythic quest to avenge his kind. As the journey finally brings them face to face, Caesar and the colonel are pitted against each other in an epic battle that will determine the fate of both of their species and the future of the planet.\n\n(Now Streaming)\n\nDAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES (2014)\n\nTen years after simian flu wiped out much of the world's homosapiens, genetically enhanced chimpanzee Caesar (Andy Serkis) and his ever-growing band of followers have established a thriving colony just outside San Francisco in Muir Woods. Meanwhile, a small band of human survivors emerges, which forces Caesar -- as leader -- to grapple with the dual challenge of protecting his people and re-establishing a relationship with the remaining human population -- the latter being Caesar's secret wish.\n\n(Now Streaming)\n\nRISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES (2011)\n\nWill Rodman (James Franco), a scientist in San Francisco, is experimenting with a drug that he hopes will cure his father's (John Lithgow) Alzheimer's disease. After his work is deemed a failure, Will becomes the guardian of Caesar, an infant chimp who was exposed in-utero to Will's drug. Caesar displays unusual intelligence, and Will decides to continue his experiments secretly. But as Caesar's intellect and abilities grow, he comes to represent a threat to man's dominion over Earth.\n\n(Now Streaming)\n\nPLANET OF THE APES (2001)\n\nAstronaut Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) whips through space and time to a world where apes and gorillas rule the humans. Captured, he is nurtured by Ari and hunted by General Thade as he leads a rebel group of humans and chimpanzees in search of his downed craft. This is his only hope of escape and, ironically, the planet's only hope of shaking off the tyranny of the gorillas, allowing peaceful humans and chimpanzees to co-exist.\n\n(Now Streaming)\n\nBATTLE FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES (1973)\n\n\"Battle for the Planet of the Apes\" is the final chapter in the sci-fi movie series. In this chapter, a tribute of human atomic bomb mutations are out to make life miserable for the peaceful ape tribe. The story is told primarily in flashback with the opening and closing taking place in the year 2670.\n\n(Now Streaming)\n\nCONQUEST OF THE PLANET OF THE APES (1972)\n\nIn this third sequel to \"Planet of the Apes,\" the apes turn the tables on the human Earth population when they lead a revolt against their cruel masters in the distant year of 1990. By doing this it creates the time loop that leads to the first film. \"Conquest of the Planet of the Apes\" is cinematically etched in broad, brash strokes slashing social satire and science fiction suspense with large-scale spectacle.\n\n(Now Streaming)\n\nESCAPE FROM THE PLANET OF THE APES (1971)\n\nIn this second sequel to \"Planet of the Apes,\" three apes flee their world before it's destroyed, and travel back in time to present-day America. When the humans discover that the trio are intelligent and capable of speech, they treat them as experimental research animals until they attempt to escape.\n\n(Now Streaming)\n\nBENEATH THE PLANET OF THE APES (1970)\n\nThe second installment in \"The Planet of the Apes\" series. Here, an earthling sent to find the astronauts of the original film discovers not only a world of intelligent, talking apes, but an underground cult of grotesque \"humans\" who are the survivors of a nuclear blast years ago.\n\n(Now Streaming)\n\nPLANET OF THE APES (1968)\n\nComplex sociological themes run through this science-fiction classic about three astronauts marooned on a futuristic planet where apes rule and humans are slaves. The stunned trio discovers that these highly intellectual simians can both walk upright and talk. They have even established a class system and a political structure. The astronauts suddenly find themselves part of a devalued species, trapped and imprisoned by the apes.\n\n(Now Streaming)"
