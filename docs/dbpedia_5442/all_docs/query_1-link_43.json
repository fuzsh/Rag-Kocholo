J. Lee Thompson directed the science fiction sequel. Art by Boris Grinsson.\n\nThe poster measures 23\" x 31\" and is in very good to excellent condition with minimal wear on the top edge from previous handling.

It will be rolled for shipping in a rigid, tube mailer.\n\nPlease look closely at the photo (this is the exact poster you are buying). It is not cropped or a stock image.\n\nThis rare and collectible poster, printed in 1972 to promote the French theatrical release of Conquest of the Planet of the Apes, is not a reproduction or a reprint.\n\nCERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICITY (COA) INCLUDED"
