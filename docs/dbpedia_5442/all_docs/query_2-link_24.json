        "text": "In 2007 - now a long time ago, Anjan Chakravarti and I optioned a screenplay to George Miller and got hired as writers. We worked for about three years in the Metro Theatre with some of the most amazing people I had ever met (and now call my closest friends) and wrote a Mad Max movie screenplay under his guidance called Mad Max - The Praetorian (later to become Furiosa). At the time we left KMM - our completed screenplay had been very well received and saw it being upgraded from being an anime directed by Maeda Mahiro to a live action film. But only if (the yet to shoot) Mad Max Fury Road did well first. Now - the film finally comes out. We are credited for story contribution (don’t ask me how film credits work), but nevertheless it was a great experience to go to the premiere and see it. It was also great going with Anjan Chakravarti, Richard Pritchard (who I still remember doing concepts of the citadel in CG in 2007 and is basically capable of creating anything - even a best selling indigenous heroine kids book), Gary Eck (who is one of those rare always driven adventurers you read about in classic fairytales - who was working on Happy Feet 2 at the time and has since become a best mate). It was also great to hang with with Mark Sexton who's brilliant pencil brought both Fury Road and Furiosa to life (as well as many other iconic films), as well as Greg Van Borssum - responsible for some of the greatest fight choreography ever seen on a silver screen (in Fury Road). Also great to see nico lathouris and george miller - both of whom, from which, I have learnt so much and for which I am very grateful. Not to mention Tim Ridge and his wife Mardi (Mad Max's truest and most important royalty, almanac, and a film maker (and great guy) in his own right). And also editing extraordinaire Andrew Corsi who brought the film to life, and Dane Hallett who did incredible concept work. And finally, I missed not seeing the one and only Colin Gibson - the one man production design army, the genius and the smartest person (and mentor) I have ever had the privilege of coming into contact with in the human race (he was overseas and couldn't make it). You don't believe that people that smart exist until you meet them - and meeting Colin has been a real privilege in my life. I am still pushing him to sit in the director seat - as I really can't wait to see it. I think back to my time on this project (and at KMM) fondly - it was a time, where I got to come out of where I was, and start dedicating myself to the craft of what I actually was born to do - to tell stories. It was something my mother instilled in me (my mother is the greatest story teller I know). But it is not a skill I even realised I had until my experience with George taught me to see it as a fundamental skill and craft. It has since become my compass, toolkit and the source of my passion in everything I do. So hopefully, this won't be my last post - as I hope to have more to share soon."
