        "text": "Yep, \"Conquest\" is the one with the slave apes dressed in the jumpsuits...\n\nAs far as Taylor and crew not knowing it was Earth because of the apes speaking English, as Heston explained, English is the language of film, and Lord knows how many other films/TV series/comics/novels, etc. had the aliens speaking English, so \"APES\" was nothing new in that arena... As far as not seeing the moon, as Dodge says, the nights are cloud covered, so they're blocking the moon-And that one is entirely believable to me, as I've been outside at night a lot of times, with a cloud covered sky, and the moon wasn't visible, though the sky was still luminous (as Dodge says, \"Cloud covered nights, and that strange luminousity, yet there's no moon\").\n\ngood points.\n\nI recall someone suggesting something like that in the old APES comics from the early 90s... They never did do it, but there *is* a comic mini-series where they did a cross over of APES and Alien-Nation... And the APES/Alien-Nation story is *not* good in either story or execution.\n\nJust say no to cross-overs!\n\nYeah Disney- has that Wes Ball new Apes film still in the works.\n\nI still just want the original five pota films redone in 4k like I always say ad nauseam with even more elements of Conquest put back.\n\nTheir stance on video releases makes this untenable.\n\nPota 1968 and Conquest are my top 2. Seeing them in theaters when they were released and being at that impressionable age makes them, for good or ill, my favs of the list. John M."
