        "text": "I love how each Apes sequel tries something new. Conquest of the Planet of the Apes is not perfect, but the cruel future (1991, where apes are kept as enslaved pets in place of cats and dogs, made extinct in a plague) it presents is very effective. This is a violent film (see the unrated version). The scenes of action and carnage are rather disturbing at times, particularly the final explosive minutes. Roddy McDowall is given the spotlight in this entry, and he's great as Caesar ‚Äî the ape who kicks off the revolution. A very good sequel and a serious warning of how shitty a world would be without cats and dogs.\n\n*theatrical cut*\n\nLove that it get‚Äôs darker and stranger, fully committing to Caesar‚Äôs origins, but not in love with the middle which gets bogged down by the burdensome indoctrination details (DO!). Ends on a high note, even if it feels a little unsure of itself.\n\nWill seek out the director‚Äôs cut asap because this has a lot of potential, I just appreciate the intimacy of Escape From the Planet of the Apes a lot more.\n\nI enjoy seeing Chimpsüêµ beat the hell out of humansü§ï so therefore I enjoyed the movieüî•. It‚Äôs that simple.\n\nThis one‚Äôs tone is probably the most consistently dark so farüòì. The first 3 had a little sillinessü§° to counteract the cynicism which this one seemed to lack. I could‚Äôve done with a few lighter touches to take the edge offü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.\n\nThe Ape revolution stuff was great, thoughü¶ç. Very clearly the inspiration for the rebooted Apes movies so it was interesting to see‚úä.\n\nIt‚Äôs not quite the same without Zira & Cornellius anymoreüíî but I thought Roddy McDawall made an excellent Caesarüñ§. It‚Äôs a solid movie.\n\nPlanet of the Apes- ranked\n\nClearly the inspiration for the most recent round of Apes sequels, I think this might be the best film of the original five movies. The budget is even lower, but they make do with everything they have, turning in a remarkably compelling sci-fi adaptation of Spartacus, with some interesting commentary on American racial politics as well. The final sequence, of the Ape uprising, is exhilarating.\n\nThis shit is baller as fuck. The entire third act is just scene after scene of ape revolutionaries absolutely demolishing fascists in the most violent ways possible. Incredible stuff. And Roddy McDowall, who is great in this and every Apes film he was in, delivers such a fantastic monologue at the end. Top tier movie.\n\nDuring a time of civil unrest the screenwriter told a tale of the Apes rebelling against and destroying the power structure. I like it when science fiction talks about where we are in history at that moment. Ape law dictates that this is clearly the best Ape sequel of the original run.\n\nApe law also dictates you listen to my podcast Fields of Glory.\n\nPlanet of the Apes reviews:\n\nPlanet of the Apes (1968)\n\nBeneath the Planet of the Apes\n\nEscape from the Planet of the Apes\n\nBattle for the Planet of the Apes\n\nPlanet of the Apes (2001)\n\nRise of the Planet of the Apes\n\nDawn of the Planet of the Apes\n\nWar for the Planet of the Apes\n\nKingdom of the Planet of the Apes\n\nBack to the Planet of the Apes\n\nidk, man. I'm sorry. These sequels just aren't for me. The commentary is so in your face it's off-putting. And I know this is intentional but it's absolutely not for me. It's important, but there are more impactful ways of getting out this message. It feels almost disrespectful how direct this film is. The hand-holding is insane... there is zero trust in the audience. Caesar could've been something wonderful but ultimately falls really flat as a character. The final few sequences were special, truly, and this franchise knows how to end a film, but that doesn't make your the first hour of the film that moves really poorly and feels really lazy."
