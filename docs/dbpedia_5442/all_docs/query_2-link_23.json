Director Wes Ball breathes new life into the global, epic franchise with this action-adventure spectacle from 20th Century Studios. Set several generations in the future following Caesar’s reign, apes are living harmoniously as the dominant species — and humans have been reduced to living in the shadows. As a new tyrannical ape leader builds his empire, one young ape undertakes a harrowing journey that will cause him to question all that he has known about the past and to make choices that will define a future for apes and humans alike.",

        "text": "Ball’s movie — intended as the start of a new story arc featuring new characters — is the typical bloated and bland franchise fodder that can only come out of a Hollywood that relishes IP as far as its name and no further.\n\nAugust 8, 2024\n\nKingdom of the Planet of the Apes carries enough promise for future instalments, and proves that this series, unlike its long-suffering humans, is not yet headed towards extinction.\n\nAugust 5, 2024\n\nBall expands the primate saga into unexpected areas that often boasts a certain visual prowess, but on the surface its plot frequents common places that turn the science-fiction adventure into a predictable event. [Full review in Spanish]\n\nJuly 24, 2024\n\nKingdom of the Planet of the Apes deserves to be seen on a big screen with expansive sound. It should fill the eyeballs and wash the ears with brights and louds and whispers and shadows. I didn’t love this movie, but I love what this movie represented.\n\nJuly 18, 2024\n\nYou can nitpick some of Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes’ flaws, but considering the ambition of its visual and thematic scope, that feels shortsighted.\n\nJuly 10, 2024\n\nEpic in both heart and scale, Ball's film grabs you early and forces you to care, regardless of how many of its predecessors you have indulged in.\n\nJuly 9, 2024\n\n...takes on the task of showing how the message of one revered as a deity, one with wholly good intentions, can be corrupted in a world of hearsay and unreliable communication methods\n\nJuly 4, 2024\n\nRaka leaves a void when he is not on screen. Every other character, especially the humans, is flat in comparison. William H. Macy’s presence feels particularly baffling.\n\nJuly 3, 2024\n\nthe Apes franchise distinguishes itself from other blockbusters by being severe enough so that the concept of Apes conquering the planet never feels corny or out of place\n\nJuly 3, 2024\n\nIt smartly revives the themes of jingoism, war, and distrust, and updates the subtext to work in present day. The fact that much of it doesn’t need updating is a dire reminder of how slow humans (and, in this case, apes) are to change.\n\nAugust 1, 2024"
