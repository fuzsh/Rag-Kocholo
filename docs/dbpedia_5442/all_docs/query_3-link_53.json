        "text": "Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes: Official final trailer\n\nApes are back with a vengence in the latest instalment in the Planet of the Apes franchise that is available now on streaming platforms. From director Wes Ball, Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes takes place in a dystopian future in which apes are the dominant species living harmoniously and humans have been reduced to living in the shadows.\n\nIt follows the 2017 threequel War for the Planet of the Apes and takes place 300 years after Caesar’s reign. It sees a new tyrannical ape leader build an empire as one young ape undertakes a harrowing journey that will cause him to question all that he has known about the past and to make choices that will define a future for apes and humans alike.\n\nKingdom marks the fourth film in the Planet of the Apes reboot franchise and the tenth overall since 1968’s Charlton Heston-led classic. It forms part of the longest-running science-fiction series in film history, according to Variety, which has so far taken more than $2 billion worldwide.\n\nJoin Disney Plus to watch the Planet of the Apes franchise\n\n£4.99 View Deal\n\nDisney+ now costs as little as £4.99 a month for the Standard with Ads plan, but members can get 12 months for the price of 10 by paying for a year upfront on the Standard or Premium plans.\n\nDisney+ is the only place to stream epic shows including The Bear and Shōgun, plus blockbuster franchises like Star Wars and Marvel.\n\nThe latest film topped the UK and US box office across its opening weekend and has already earned $131 million. It has also earned positive reviews and currently boasts a Certified Fresh 80 per cent on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nSo if you’re keen for more explosive ape action, here’s how you can watch every Planet of the Apes film on TV and streaming platforms.\n\nWhere to watch every Planet of the Apes film on TV and streaming\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

A proposed sequel to this version was eventually canned, with Warner Bros. rebooting the franchise once again in 2011 with Rise of the Planet of the Apes, which starred James Franco.\n\nThis was followed by Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014), War for the Planet of the Apes (2017) and the latest instalment, Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes (2024).
