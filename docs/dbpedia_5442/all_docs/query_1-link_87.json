        "text": "Come, come.\n\n- Are you authorized to dress him like that?\n\n- Oh, yes, sir.\n\n- A circus ape, huh?\n\n- The only one to have been trained\n\nas a bareback rider\n\nin the entire history of the circus.\n\n- Circuses are past history.\n\n- Not while I live and breathe.\n\n- All right, Seor Armando. Go ahead.\n\n- Thank you.\n\nCome, come.\n\nCome, come.\n\n- Did I do all right?\n\n- Yes, yes, yes.\n\nBut try to walk a little more\n\nlike a primitive chimpanzee.\n\nYour arms should move\n\nup and down from the shoulder... like so.\n\nYes, that's better.\n\nAfter 20 years, you've picked up\n\nevolved habits from me.\n\nThat could be dangerous. Even fatal.\n\n- Armando, I don't understand.\n\n- Listen to me, Caesar.\n\nThere can be only\n\none talking chimpanzee on Earth.\n\nThe child of the two talking apes,\n\nCornelius and Zira,\n\nwho came to us years ago out of the future\n\nand were murdered for fear that one distant\n\nday apes might dominate the human race.\n\nYeah, but outside of you,\n\nnobody even knows I exist.\n\nAnd we must keep it that way,\n\nfor the fear remains.\n\nThe mere fact of your existence would be\n\nregarded as a great threat to mankind.\n\nCome. Come.\n\nAttention, this is the watch commander.\n\nDisperse apes gathering in the mall.\n\nRepeat:\n\ndisperse apes gathering in the mall.\n\nTake the serial number of each offender\n\nand notify Ape Control immediately.\n\nRepeat:\n\ntake the serial number\n\nof each offender\n\nand notify Ape Control immediately.\n\nTheir masters are to be cited and fined.\n\nRepeat:\n\ntheir masters\n\nare to be cited and fined.\n\nAttention. Attention.\n\nThis is the watch commander.\n\nAttention. Attention. Disperse unauthorized\n\nape gathering at the foot of ramp six.\n\nRepeat:\n\ndisperse unauthorized\n\nape gathering at the foot of ramp six.\n\nNo citation or fine in this instance.\n\nRepeat:\n\nno citation or fine in this...\n\nBut how did it happen?\n\nGo! Go!\n\nNo! No!\n\nGo! You go!\n\n- But you said humans treated apes like pets.\n\n- They did, in the beginning.\n\nThey've made slaves of them!\n\nThey all died within a few months,\n\neight years ago.\n\nEvery dog and cat in the world.\n\nIt was like a plague.\n\nThe disease that killed them was a virus\n\nbrought back from space by an astronaut.\n\n- Didn't the disease affect humans?\n\n- We were immune.\n\nAnd so, it was discovered, were simians,\n\neven the smallest ones.\n\nThat's how it began.\n\nHumans wanting little household pets\n\nto replace the ones they had lost.\n\nThen, when people realized how quick\n\nthey were to learn, how easy to train,\n\nthe pets became larger,\n\nand larger, until now...\n\nIt's monstrous.\n\nNow you understand why I've kept you away.\n\nYes, Lisa.\n\nA Young Queen Falls for Mrs Riley.\n\nNo!\n\nLisa.\n\nYes?\n\nCould you possibly be so kind\n\nas to display it in your window?\n\n- When I have the time.\n\n- Thank you.\n\nThe labor demonstration on the South Plaza\n\nwill be terminated in ten minutes.\n\nRepeat:\n\nthe labor demonstration\n\non the South Plaza\n\nwill be terminated in ten minutes.\n\nThank you, Frank.\n\nFunny. Now that I know they\n\nwon't kill me, I don't enjoy them.\n\nWell, for heaven's sakes! A circus!\n\nHome, Lisa.\n\n- Yes?\n\n- Oh, I was wondering,\n\nwould you be kind enough\n\nto display a couple of these posters?\n\n- Stop it!\n\n- No, Zelda! No!\n\nHome, Zelda.\n\nI'm so sorry, Mrs Riley. I'll have\n\nsomeone to comb you out in a minute.\n\nI wanna be combed out now.\n\nI have a luncheon.\n\n- Thursday, then.\n\n- Thursday.\n\nI... I forgot the waiter\n\nand I'm all out of raisins.\n\n- Take mine.\n\n- Thank you.\n\nYou're overtipping.\n\nNo! No! No!\n\nAnd I told them to condition him to fire.\n\nAttention. The labor demonstration\n\non the South Plaza\n\nwill be terminated in five minutes.\n\nRepeat:\n\nthe labor demonstration on the\n\nSouth Plaza will be terminated in five minutes.\n\nFailure to comply with this order can result\n\nin a one-year suspension\n\nof your right to bargain collectively.\n\n- What's his job?\n\n- He's a messenger.\n\nFor the governor, so get!\n\nNo! No! No!\n\n- Stop that at once! All of you!\n\n- Yes, sir, Mr MacDonald. We were just...\n\nI saw what you were doing. Now sedate\n\nthe animal and get him out of here.\n\n- Who the hell's that?\n\n- The governor's number-one assistant.\n\n- He love apes or something?\n\n- Don't it figure?\n\nHold him.\n\nLousy human bastards!\n\nWho said that?\n\nI did.\n\nHe's a performing ape for my circus.\n\n- A talking ape?\n\n- No! No, no.\n\n- No, that's impossible. It was I who spoke.\n\n- It didn't sound like your voice.\n\nYell ''Lousy human bastards.''\n\n- That's not what I said.\n\n- That's what I heard.\n\nNow, look, mister,\n\nyou yell ''Lousy human bastards.''\n\n- Lousy human bastards.\n\n- We said yell!\n\nLousy human bastards!\n\n- Yeah, yeah. Could be.\n\n- I don't think so.\n\n- It's right. The ape spoke.\n\n- Yeah!\n\nNo! No, they're mistaken.\n\nI admit my behavior was inexcusable\n\nand I am deeply sorry.\n\nI think we better take him\n\nto headquarters for interrogation.\n\nGuard!\n\nMove him on.\n\n- Armando, forgive me.\n\n- Oh, no, no.\n\nYou only said aloud what I was thinking.\n\nI'm sorry. I was so angry.\n\nI might have bluffed it through\n\nif you hadn't run away.\n\nNow they suspect you\n\nof understanding all that was said.\n\n- Armando, let's go back to the circus.\n\n- No, no, no.\n\n- Oh, no, please.\n\n- No, that's the first place they'll look.\n\nHere's what we'll do. I'll go to the police.\n\n- Oh, no, no!\n\n- It's the only way!\n\nI'll say that... that I couldn't find you.\n\nThat... you've run away before.\n\n- That big cities frighten you.\n\n- But, Armando, where would I go?\n\nYou wait right here!\n\nIf this works, I'll be back by nightfall.\n\n- But what if they don't let you go?\n\n- Oh, they will. They will.\n\nBut just in case, if I am not back by then...\n\nNow, these steps go down\n\nto a tunnel that leads to the harbor.\n\nCargoes of apes are frequently\n\nunloaded at night.\n\n- You must try to infiltrate one of them.\n\n- But, Armando...\n\nApes imported from overseas arrive naked,\n\nso you'll have to get rid of these clothes.\n\n- Well, I don't want to.\n\n- We must have an alternate plan!\n\nRight now, the only safe\n\nhiding place for you\n\nis among your own kind.\n\nI shouldn't be long.\n\nWhy would you say ''human''?\n\n''Human.'' That's a very odd thing\n\nfor another human being to say.\n\nI didn't say ''human,'' Mr Governor.\n\nI said ''inhuman.''\n\nLousy inhuman bastards. And by the blessed\n\nSt Francis, who loved all animals, I meant it.\n\n- You see, I run a circus...\n\n- We know that.\n\n- From 20 years back.\n\n- Since the talking apes arrived on Earth\n\nand conceived a baby whose survival could\n\nhave threatened the future of the human race.\n\nMr Governor, I understand\n\nthe baby was shot dead with its parents.\n\nOr so it was believed, Mr MacDonald.\n\nHowever, since this morning, I'm beginning\n\nto wonder if they shot the right baby.\n\nThe apes could have switched\n\ntheir baby with one from the zoo.\n\n- Or perhaps a circus.\n\n- Surely, Mr Governor, you can't be serious!\n\nHoskyns, the cassette, please.\n\nThese are the recommendations made to\n\nthe then president of the United States\n\nby the chairman\n\nof the Presidential Committee.\n\nAnd we believe that the male and female\n\ntalking apes, Cornelius and Zira,\n\nhave come to us out of the future."
