        "text": "Roddy McDowall (Caesar) plays his own son in this film. In the third \"Apes\" movie he fathered the young chimp whom he now portrays grown to full chimphood. This is his third \"Apes\" venture; he missed the second because he was directing Ava Gardner in \"Tam Lin\" in London. This is his 40th feature film since coming to Hollywood from London 31 years ago to play an English lad in \"Man Hunt.' His films include many of the screen's most memorable works -- \"My Friend Flicka,\" \"How Green Was My Valley,\" \"Kidnapped,\" \"The Longest Day,\" \"Lassie, Come Home,\" \"Cleopatra,\" and others. He lives mainly in New York, but flits worldwide on special photographic sets. He started acting at the age of eight in \"Murder in the Family\" and was already famed in Britain before coming to the United States. When time permits, he turns to the stage and has won plaudits for his roles in such offerings as \"Compulsion,\" \"Camelot,\" and \"The Doctor's Dilemma\" in New York. Don Murray (Breck) was seen recently as Shuttle, the high-pressure vacuum cleaner salesman in \"Happy Birthday, Wanda June.\" It showcased once again his talent for comedy, so well established in his initial film, \"Bus Stop,\" with Marilyn Monroe. In 'conquest of the Planet of the Apes,\" he has a strikingly different role, the semi-dictatorial governor of a city-state within the USA about a quarter century from now. Murray is one of Hollywood's hardiest performers, his abilities well honed through pre-Hollywood experience on Broadway in \"The Rose Tattoo,\" \"The Skin of our Teeth,\" \"The Hot Corner\" and other plays. Filmgoers have applauded him in \"A Hatful of Rain,\" \"Advise and Consent\" and \"Bachelor Party,\" to name but a few. Murray was born in Hollywood, the son of a movie dance director and a former Ziegfeld girl. He attended the American Academy of Dramatic Art in New York. Ricardo Montalban (Armando) continues the role he created in \"Escape from the Planet of the Apes,\" the amiable circus owner who befriends Cornelius and Zira and hides their infant son, protecting him until he grows to adult apehood. Montalban was born in Mexico City and schooled at Fairfax High in Los Angeles, where he first appeared in school plays. Unable to break into the movies, he headed for New York and attained recognition on Broadway in such shows as \"Her Cardboard Lover\" with Tallulah Bankhead. After making nine Spanish-language films in his native Mexico he came back to California and starred with Esther Williams in \"Fiesta.\" He's been making films ever since. Hari Rhodes (Macdonald) graduated from the Cincinnati College Conservatory of Music with a BA degree and arrived in Hollywood with $12 and a YMCA membership card. The long, hard ride from the Cincinnati ghetto was not yet over for him, however. For the first ten years of his life the family had no inside plumbing. At 14, he was keeping body and soul together hustling older but inferior players in pool halls. At 15 he lied his way into the US Marines, later storming the beach at Inchon. In Hollywood and aged 20, he earned $1 a day sweeping out a theater in which he played important roles in such feature films as \"Mirage\" and \"Return to Peyton Place.\" Rhodes is the author of several books including a widely read novel, \"The Chosen Few,\" the story of blacks in the Marine Corps."
