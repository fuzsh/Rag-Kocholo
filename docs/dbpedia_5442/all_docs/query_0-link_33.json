        "text": "Planet of the Apes is one of the classics of the big screen. The license that made an impact at its premiere in 1968 has continued through the years to this day. Have you never seen it? Want to revisit it? Don’t worry: in this article, we’ll tell you where to find them and in what order to watch them.\n\nChronological order to watch the Planet of the Apes movies\n\nIn the chronological order we do not include the remake of the first installment directed by Tim Burton in 2001. Since the project was not continued, the most logical thing to do is to follow the order we commented. This way you will see the resurrection of the apes and what happened on planet Earth in the fight against the humans.\n\nRelease order of the Planet of the Apes movies\n\nWhere can I watch the Planet of the Apes movies?"
