        "text": "Blue Eyes was an evolved chimpanzee and the heir to the throne of the San Francisco Ape Colony. As the firstborn of Caesar, he initially participated in Koba's conflict against humanity, believing his father to be deceased. However, upon learning that Caesar was still alive, he returned to his side. Subsequently, he became a vital member of his father's forces during the Human-Ape War and successfully identified the Oasis, which would ultimately become the new sanctuary for his clan.\n\nBiography\n\nEarly Life\n\nBlue Eyes was an evolved chimpanzee born to Caesar and Cornelia in 2018, and was named for his blue-colored eyes, unique among the green-eyed apes of the San Francisco Ape Colony. Growing up, he became close to his father's honorary nephew, Ash, the son of Rocket. Blue Eyes would idolized Rocket and Koba for their strength seeing the two of them as honorary uncles. Overtime, Blue Eyes becomes extremely close to Koba; who taught him along; with his other honorary uncle, Maurice.\n\nFor most of Blue Eyes' childhood, he was the treasured heir, being Caesar's only child; which changed in Blue Eyes' late teens; when his parents were about to have a second child. As Caesar's eldest son, Blue Eyes inherited a lot of his father's personality traits and some of his mother's; which included stubbornness, rebelliousness and defiance; which became two of Blue Eyes' most identifiable traits.\n\nBlue Eyes also become close friends with Lake; who would become his wife in his early adulthood; when they were children, they were inseparable as Blue Eyes and Lake played all the time; until Blue Eyes started wanting to be with boys his age and hunt. Despite this, Blue Eyes never became estranged from Lake, as the two of them still maintained a close relationship; all the way to adulthood.\n\nEarly in Blue Eyes' teenage years, Caesar assigned him to be a member of not only his army; but also his council as well, both skills that; Blue Eyes would later need; when he eventually succeeds his father as king. Also, Blue Eyes, like several other young apes, learnt to wield weapons as a way of defending himself if the need ever arose.\n\nDawn of the Planet of the Apes\n\nElk Hunt\n\nBlue Eyes first appeared with his father in the forest standing on a tree branch during an elk hunt. He asks his father if they should attack the deer now only for him to be silenced by Caesar who then order the apes to attack. When Caesar manages to ensnare an elk, he tells his son to stay put and quiet but is ignored. Blue Eyes wanders off to kill the seemingly trapped deer, only to be attacked by a bear, resulting in the elk escaping and Blue Eyes receiving scars. Caesar intervened, keeping the bear at bay until Koba heard Caesar's cry and ran towards the bear, stabbing it in the back with his long spear, killing the bear which falls onto Caesar. When Caesar is freed, he goes to tell his son to think before he acts and tries to check out Blue Eyes' injuries, but the young ape stubbornly brushes off his father's concern and goes to his horse.\n\nA New Sibling\n\nAs they return to their village, Koba comforted the prince by telling Blue Eyes to be proud of his new scars as they show he is strong and durable. When his father is summoned by Cornelia's midwives, Blue Eyes reluctantly follows and stands awkwardly in the doorway before his father summons him over to meet his little brother Cornelius for the first time. Blue Eyes is shown to be nervous about the situation, but bonds with his new brother anyway, happy to be an older sibling to a new ape.\n\nEncounter with Humans\n\nLater, Blue Eyes is out by the lake fishing with his best friend and honorary cousin, Ash. Ash begins to tease him about the bear incident and playfully shoves him which results in Blue Eyes taking the comments in stride and playfully shoving him back. On the way back to the village, the teenagers stumble across a human named Carver who suddenly becomes frightened and shoots Ash in the shoulder. Blue Eyes stays to protect him until their fathers and the other apes appear. The humans would then be scared off by the adult apes shouting (in English) at them to leave the forest. Back in the village, Blue Eyes sits with his father and his uncles in a council meeting. The apes argue over what is to be done about the humans and what they must do to avenge Ash's shooting. Blue Eyes agrees with Koba that something has to be done to show the humans they mean business. Ash, being present tells them that the humans didn't mean to shoot him and that it was an accident. Blue Eyes argues with him saying that the humans need to be taught a lesson. Caesar would tell his son that he plans on telling the humans a loud message that they'll understand clearly. The next morning, Caesar leads the army into San Francisco to issue the threat of war to the humans, Blue Eyes rides with him, carrying Alexander's lost bag. On Caesar's orders, he dismounts from his horse and drops the bag at Malcolm's feet as his father tells the human not to come back to the forest. The ape army would then leave for the forest after giving their warning to the humans.\n\nHumans in Ape Territory\n\nLater on, Malcolm would enter the Ape Village leading to him being captured by Luca and the other Gorilla Guardians who dragged him through the village and to Caesar to pass his judgment. Blue Eyes growled at the human for disobeying his father's warning but is forced to watch as his father spared the human and allowed him and his group to work on the city dam. Blue Eyes spoke with his father about his decision saying that he agrees with Koba about humans being evil and how they should finish them off. Caesar attempted to explain to his son that not all humans are bad but Blue Eyes refused to listen and stalks off, much to Caesar's utter annoyance. When Caesar agreed to help Malcolm and his family, Blue Eyes accompanies him and his uncles, Maurice and Rocket and carries his little brother, Cornelius. When Cornelius climbs out of his arms and off the horse, Blue Eyes hurried after him and stops and watches nervously as the little one interacts with Ellie and Alexander before he wandered to a supply box, revealing a hidden gun. Blue Eyes leaps into action and rescues his little brother from Carver who threatened to kill him as well only to be punched by Caesar who threatens the humans with the exposed weapon before throwing it over the dam wall and ordering them to leave.\n\nKoba's Usurpation\n\nBlue Eyes is present when Malcolm and Ellie enter the family home to apologize for Carver's behavior. He watches as the humans plead with Caesar to help Cornelia, who is very sick. He tries to dissuade his father for continuing to allow humans in their territory only to be ignored when his father says the apes will help the humans, Blue Eyes firmly states that he will not help the humans. He remains in the village sharpening spears with the younger apes until Koba returned to tell Caesar that the humans are more dangerous than he thought. The bonobo then asked Blue Eyes where his father is.\n\nBlue Eyes told Koba he is at the dam with the humans. Blue Eyes then accompanies Koba, Grey and Stone to the dam where he watches Koba angrily confronts Caesar stating that humans had attacked his sons and yet he still lets them work. Koba goes on ranting that Caesar loves humans more than apes and his sons, which caused Caesar to lash out and attack Koba. Blue Eyes watching this unsure of who to help until his father stopped himself from beating Koba stating \"Ape not kill ape\" law. Koba asked Caesar to forgive him and leaves the dam afterwards. Blue Eyes glared at his father.\n\nAt night, in the Ape Village Blue Eyes is seen eating until his father tries to speak with him about humans but Blue Eyes, too caught up in what with Koba has told him stalks off, much to Caesar's dismay. The teen then goes to sit by a sulking Koba who tells him to protect his father as he believes Caesar's love for humans has clouded his judgment to the point of where he won't listen to reason to which Blue Eyes agrees. Later on, the apes and humans celebrate the restoration of power of San Francisco in the Ape Village. Blue Eyes is shown bemoaning the events remembering the fight his father had with Koba but his spirits are lifted when he sees his sick mother emerge from their home.\n\nBlue Eyes runs and embraced Cornelia, happy that she is now okay and able to walk. His happiness was to be cut short when the sound of a gunshot, from a hidden Koba who used a gun acquired from the city, and he saw his father fall from their home. The Ape Village was then set ablaze, by Grey secretly, forcing the apes to flee for dear lives. Blue Eyes then appears with Carver's baseball cap and gun, showing it to the colony.\n\nKoba, appearing out of nowhere is given the items the bonobo while assuming leadership states that the humans assassinated their king and burned the village. He then commands the apes to fight back and attack the humans while they still have the chance. Koba approached the saddened Blue Eyes, telling him that they will avenge his father, believing his father to truly be dead decides to join in the assault of attacking San Francisco.\n\nHuman-Ape War\n\nThe ape army raided the city's armory and stole all the weapons before moving to launch a full assault on the human colony. Once they reached the gate, they were confronted by the human militia guarding the wall. A huge battle breaks out resulting the in the deaths of many apes and humans as well causing chaos to the already damaged city in the process. Koba then steals a tank which allowed the apes to enter the shelter and terrorize defenseless humans. As he entered the city with the other apes, Blue Eyes (while holding Ash back) saw the utter horror and madness that his father would not condone.\n\nThe next day, the apes took over most of the city and forced many humans to run in a building for safety. As the apes group up, Blue Eyes and Ash, headed up the stairs as one human attempted to defend himself by swinging a lamp post at an ape, while Koba approached from behind and disarmed the human. Koba then tossed the post to Ash, ordering him to kill the defenseless human. Ash declined, stating Caesar would not condone it, and dropped the post.\n\nKoba walked up to Ash and patted him on the back, only to suddenly grab the young chimpanzee and drag him up the stairs. Blue Eyes and the other apes followed Koba, worried about what Koba was planning to do. Koba reached a balcony and threw Ash to his death, horrifying Blue Eyes and the other apes. Koba tells the apes that Caesar is gone and he leads the apes now. After witnessing the death of his best friend and cousin, Blue Eyes now began to see Koba's true colors. Afterwards, the apes took full control of the city and Koba imprisoned the remaining humans in old Simian Flu padlocks so they would know \"life in cage\".\n\nKoba also imprisoned any apes still loyal to Caesar, including Maurice, Rocket, and Luca. Seeing them chained in a bus, Blue Eyes was beyond horrified at this, asking Maurice why they were chained. Maurice told Blue Eyes that Koba viewed them as too loyal to Caesar, meaning they would never give in to Koba's tyranny. He was then is told by his uncle to protect himself and stay safe.\n\nReunion with his Father\n\nBlue Eyes then went on patrol around the city for any free humans. As he does, he encountered Malcolm in an abandoned apartment and pointed his gun at Malcolm who pleas for him to not do it, but remembering the death of his friend and the madness Koba started, Blue Eyes lowered it, sparing Malcolm. The young ape then turns to leave but Malcolm quickly stops him by telling him his father is alive.\n\nShocked, Blue Eyes traveled with Malcolm to the Rodman House where he spots his wounded but still living father laying on the couch. The prince puts down his gun and quickly goes to tend to his father as Caesar asks; if Cornelia and Cornelius were safe, Blue Eyes confirmed that; their safety relieving his father. He then saw Caesar's gun shot wound and thinking the humans were responsible, immediately snarls at them, only for Caesar to tell Blue Eyes that; it was not the humans; who shot him; but Koba, leaving Blue Eyes shocked and ashamed at himself for following the treacherous ape's reign. When Ellie prepares to operate on Caesar, Blue Eyes holds his father's hand the whole time during the surgery and stays with him as he recovers.\n\nDiscovering Caesar's Past\n\nAs Blue Eyes' father, Caesar rests from surgery, he examined a portrait of a young Caesar and Will Rodman together, which made him realize that his father was raised by humans hence the reason for his compassion and respect towards them. He was soon startled by his father, who suddenly wakes up and grunts in pain from the sewn up wound. Blue Eyes apologized for his actions and behavior in the past days, but Caesar states the fault was his alone. Confused, Blue Eyes stated that Koba betrayed him.\n\nCaesar replied that it was his choice to trust Koba due to his previous views of apes being better than humans, but after witnessing Koba's betrayal, he now sees that there is no difference between the two species and asks for Koba's current location. Blue Eyes signed that Koba occupies the human colony's tower with all the apes that have pledge their loyalty to him. Caesar then asks about the apes who refuse to follow Koba, to which Blue Eyes replied that they have become prisoners, he states among them were Maurice and Rocket.\n\nBlue Eyes also said Koba killed Ash, saying the apes only follow out of fear. Blue Eyes tries to reassure his father by stating that once the apes see Caesar alive they will turn from Koba, but Caesar said not if he's weak. Despite his injury, Caesar tries to rise, saying he must stop Koba and end the madness he wrought. Blue Eyes stopped him, speaking clearly for the first time, much to Caesar's joy.\n\nHelping his Father\n\nAfter making the plan to free Koba's prisoners, both apes and humans, Blue Eyes returned to the city heading for the bus containing Caesar's loyalists, drawing Caesar's symbol to renew their strength then told them of the plan. Caesar's loyalists executed the plan at night, freeing themselves and the humans. Blue Eyes then led them back to Caesar, telling him Koba summoned the female and young apes to the city, Cornelia included. Startled by this revelation, Caesar decided to confront Koba.\n\nBlue Eyes silently watched as his father and former uncle battle for power and knowing it's for the best he stays on the sidelines as the fierce duel continues. When Koba opened fire on the apes to kill Caesar, Blue Eyes moves many of the injured to safety before throwing a series of pipes at Koba who angrily fires at him leading to one of his stray bullets hitting and scarring Maurice. Blue Eyes would then tend to his wounded uncle and worry about his life. Afterwards, Blue Eyes witnessed his father drop Koba to his death.\n\nPreparing for War\n\nWith Koba's violent uprising over, Caesar takes back his place as Ape King. Blue Eyes embraced his parents and little brother as the other apes bow down to Caesar awaiting his guidance for the impending war with humans to come.\n\nWar for the Planet of the Apes: Revelations\n\nThe narrative initially presents the apes in a poignant moment when Blue Eyes stumbles upon the remains of Ash. Overcome with rage and sorrow, he lashes out at the lifeless body until Maurice intervenes, and Ash's family comes to retrieve what is left of him. Throughout the course of Revelations, Blue Eyes' profound grief regarding Ash's death is revisited multiple times, alongside his feelings of envy towards Ray, who experienced a dream featuring Ash while Blue Eyes did not. Ultimately, Ash does appear to Blue Eyes in a dream, offering him a semblance of closure; however, it is evident that he will continue to grapple with the reality of losing his closest friend.\n\nWar for the Planet of the Apes\n\nBlue Eyes and Rocket were dispatched by Caesar to search for a new location for their colony. Two years later, they came back with news of their discovery. Upon his return, Blue Eyes embraces his father, then his mother and younger brother. Cornelia remarks, \"Look who's here, son,\" and Blue Eyes sees his wife Lake. He approaches her and they touch foreheads.\n\nAfterwards, in a council gathering, they deliberate about the new location that he and Rocket stumbled upon. It's a lengthy trek across a desert, but they are convinced that it's the ideal spot for the tribe to reside harmoniously, although they need to find a secure path out of the woods for all the apes. Lake leans her head on Blue Eyes' shoulder as the meeting comes to an end.\n\nAt nightfall, as J. Wesley McCullough's troops launch an assault on the ape hideout, Caesar instructs Blue Eyes to safeguard his mother and brother, while he sets out to confront the soldiers. Blue Eyes eliminates a soldier who enters their dwelling, but is subsequently gunned down by McCullough, along with Cornelia. Prior to the colonel's fatal attack on him and his mother, Blue Eyes advises his brother, Cornelius, to hide and remain concealed until it is safe to emerge. Upon Caesar's return, he discovers a frightened Cornelius cowering behind a wall, frightened but unharmed.\n\nLegacy\n\nThe death of Blue Eyes and his mother, Cornelia, served as the primary trigger for Caesar's pursuit of their murderer. Caesar later brought up their deaths to Winter as a way of illustrating the repercussions of his betrayal, before inadvertently causing Winter's demise. Blue Eyes was also referenced when Bad Ape inquired about Caesar's offspring, to which Caesar disclosed that one of his sons had been killed.\n\nCaesar decided not to take the chance to eliminate McCullough, the individual accountable for the passing of Cornelia and Blue Eyes. He opted to let McCullough end his own life, understanding that Blue Eyes would not approve of him sinking to McCullough's standards.\n\nBlue Eyes' revelation alongside his esteemed uncle regarding the sanctuary has now become the apes' abode. Rocket's actions will forever immortalize Blue Eyes for his role in preventing additional conflict with humans. It is likely that Maurice, Lake, and Rocket will recount tales of Blue Eyes' existence to Cornelius, ensuring that the young prince never forgets his courageous older brother's sacrifices for his well-being.\n\nPhysical Appearance\n\nBlue Eyes exhibited the quintessential characteristics of a chimpanzee, adorned with coarse black fur and a tan complexion, while showcasing a blend of his parents' facial traits. He inherited a distinctive hair parting from his mother, and although he stood slightly taller than her, he remained several inches shorter than his father. What set Blue Eyes apart in his colony was his striking blue irises, a rare deviation from the typical green eyes found in his species. During a hunting expedition at the beginning of Dawn, his impulsive behavior led to a dangerous encounter with a grizzly bear, resulting in four prominent vertical slashes: the first, a short mark on his right cheek; the second, a long gash extending from his right shoulder across his chest; the third, a separate wound on his right pectoral; and the final one, a deep cut on the right side of his chest. Although these injuries eventually healed, they left behind notable scars that served as a testament to his harrowing experience.\n\nUpon reaching maturity in War, Blue Eyes' shoulder and chest wounds have become prominent, inhibiting the growth of new fur, while his mane has thickened on his head, concealing the original parting.\n\nPersonality\n\nDawn of the Planet of the Apes\n\nDuring his teenage years, Blue Eyes was a young chimpanzee who often found himself lost in the complexities of right and wrong. He exhibited a stubborn and rebellious nature, characteristics inherited from both of his parents, Caesar and Cornelia. Despite these challenges, Blue Eyes possessed a kind heart and a fierce protectiveness for those he cherished, particularly his family and close companions. Notable among these were his honorary cousin, Ash, and his beloved honorary uncles, Maurice and Rocket.\n\nAs Caesar's son, Blue Eyes proved to be a skilled fighter, leader, and strategist. However, his aggressive nature sometimes led him to take unnecessary risks, such as when he tried to attack a defenseless deer, resulting in him getting scars from a nearby bear. He also confronted Carver when he threatened his younger brother, Cornelius, and it's worth noting that Blue Eyes' intervention saved Cornelius from harm. Despite his recklessness and rebelliousness, his father, Caesar, managed to balance him out. Blue Eyes had a strong bond with his little brother and mother, as evidenced by his protective actions after his father was shot. Additionally, his playful relationship with his honorary cousin, Ash, was also very strong.\n\nSimilar to Blue Eyes' father, Caesar, he displayed aggression and violence only towards those who posed a threat to his loved ones. He also harbored a desire for revenge; when his father was thought to have been killed by Carver, he sought vengeance for Caesar's alleged death, targeting only those humans who were believed to be responsible for his father's demise.\n\nBlue Eyes once held a somewhat naïve perspective, believing Koba's deceitful claims that all humans were inherently evil. However, this viewpoint transformed after he encountered Malcolm, Ellie, and Alexander, forming genuine friendships with them. Through these relationships, he began to realize that Koba's assertions about the malevolence of all humans were mere fabrications. This revelation was further solidified when he learned that his father, Caesar, had been nurtured by humans whom he regarded as his grandparents.\n\nWar for the Planet of the Apes: Revelations\n\nBlue Eyes was consumed by sorrow following Ash's tragic passing, feeling a deep-seated jealousy towards Ray for having a dream about Ash while he did not. However, a semblance of closure emerged when Ash reached out to him in his dreams. Despite this connection, Blue Eyes continued to wrestle with guilt, holding himself accountable for the events that led to Ash's fate.\n\nWar for the Planet of the Apes\n\nIn adulthood, Blue Eyes had reconciled with his previous errors and transformed into a dependable figure, one whom his father could trust implicitly.\n\nBlue Eyes had transformed from a rebellious individual to a mature, responsible, reasonable, and serious ape. He had taken on the role of a negotiator, attempting to persuade other apes, like Winter, to see things from a logical perspective.\n\nBlue Eyes was openly affectionate towards his family, particularly his wife Lake, as he was observed embracing her in front of their family, showing his adoration for her.\n\nAbilities\n\nAdvanced Strength: Blue Eyes was much stronger than humans and most other apes; for example, he managed to rip off a bag of iron bars relatively easily. In War, Blue Eyes was also able to beat the human soldier, Lang to death; with little to no effort at all.\n\nAdvanced Speed: Blue Eyes was much faster than humans and most other apes; for example, he was able to quickly run across a battle field; avoiding mortar fire and bullets. In War, Blue Eyes was also able to tackle Lang; before he could react in time.\n\nAdvanced Reflexes: Blue Eyes' reflexes were much faster than humans and most other apes.\n\nGenius-Level Intellect: As evolved ape, Blue Eyes was highly intelligent; because both of his parents, Caesar and Cornelia respectively had inhaled the ALZ-113 early in their life and one of them was also already born altered; by the ALZ-112, Blue Eyes had a higher level of intelligence than both of his parents combined. He also conjured the plan to migrate the colony from the woods to the desert. Blue Eyes along; with his younger brother, Cornelius, was the most intelligent ape in the entire San Francisco Ape Colony.\n\nSpeech: As evolved ape; Blue Eyes was capable of speech. In Dawn, he was capable of speaking; but his english was broken, also unlike his father, Caesar; Blue Eyes could not form complete sentences. In War, it can be assumed that; Blue Eyes' english and sentences had greatly improved (off-screen).\n\nSign Language: Due to Blue Eyes being taught; by his parents, Caesar and Cornelia, and his honorary uncle, Maurice respectively; he knew sign language; Blue Eyes used it as a way to communicate; with other apes; who could not speak or have limited verbal speech.\n\nSkilled Hand-To-Hand Combatant: Due to being a member of the Ape Army; Blue Eyes was a capable hand-to-hand combatant.\n\nSkilled Marksman: Blue Eyes was a capable marksman; he was able to use one to suppress a group of Koba's followers.\n\nSkilled Leader: As the son of the ape king, Caesar, Blue Eyes was a capable leader; he had led Maurice, Rocket, Luca and the other rebel apes back to the Rodman House.\n\nSkilled Tactician: As the son of the ape king, Caesar, Blue Eyes was a capable tactician; as he came up; with a plan to free Maurice, Rocket, Luca, the other rebel apes and the human prisoners from Koba; when Blue Eyes initiated his plan, it was successful.\n\nExpert Rider: Blue Eyes was a highly skilled rider; he is capable of riding a horse; quite easily.\n\nRelationships\n\nSee Blue Eyes/Relationships.\n\nQuotes\n\nDawn of the Planet of the Apes\n\n(Ash) \"That bear wouldn't get me, Blue Eyes.
