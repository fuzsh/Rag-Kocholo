        "text": "This War of the Planet of Apes is an intense and exciting film with great visual effects by means of Motion Capture technology . The picture delivers enough energy and turns out to be an impressive flick full of fighting, action , battles and suspense . An acceptable Ape movie with huge production design in which the performers are very fine , and special mention for Andy Serkis who provides the sturdy central pivot the tale surely needs . There concerns Caesar (masterfullly incarnated by Andy Serkis, Gollum alter-ego) , a chimpanzee who gained human-like intelligence and emotions from an experimental drug that rose to a super-intelligent chimp who leads an ape upheaval . As Caesar and his apes : gorilla , chimpanzee and orangutan , are forced into a deadly conflict with an army of humans led by a ruthless Colonel . Along the way the apes suffer unimaginable losses and Caesar (Andy Serkis), a Chimpanzee raised like a child by the drug's creator (first outing with Will Rodman: James Franco) . Here Caesar wrestles with his darker instincts and starts his own mythic quest to avenge his kind that is being submitted in slavery and apartheid . Later on , Caesar is locked and seeking justice for his fellow primates , as they carry out a riot in which simians turn the tables . As simians , Chimpanzees , gorillas uprising violently every human in sight . As the journey finally brings them face to face, Caesar and the Colonel (Woody Harrelson) are pitted against each other in an impressive battle that will determine the fate of both their species and the future of the planet.\n\nThis awesome film is a brilliant and intelligent sequel that contains fights , thrills , frenetic action , go riding , violence , breathtaking scenes and a strong denounce about animal mistreat . Dramatic as well as spectacular film in which simians undergo a rebellion against humans and winding up at a climatic final . Recent sequel in the series based on Pierre Boulle novel initiated by the mythical film ¨Planet of Apes¨ (1968) by Franklyn J. Schaffner that at time of its release regarded as the most extraordinary Scifi in years . It deals with a Chimpanzee hero called Caesar well played by Andy Serkis , this is the third film in which Andy Serkis plays an ape, having previously portrayed 2005's version of King Kong and he was also the motion capture actor for Gollum in Lord of the Rings . Highlights of the movie are the spectacular ending scenes when happens a fierce confrontation between a human army and the simians commanded by Caesar . As Caesar leads an animal revolt against his human captors and mankind in which humans battle the apes led by the intelligent ape . The flick plenty of metaphysical significance with thoughtful reflexion about vengeance , apartheid , upon origin of human being , racism , and mistreating ; though also packs action , adventures , intrigue and entertainment . Being mostly a decent follow-up of the former stories , with big moments of energy remaining throughout and it results to be , particularly , a breathtaking Sci-Fi movie full of frantic action , battles, suspense and top-notch FX by Oscarized team who made Avatar and Lord of the Rins . The performers , particularly Andy Serks and Woody Harrelson are pretty good , the characters are well drawn and in spite of excessive computer generator frames all of them are still oddly convincing . Although several elements of the screenplay strain credibility to the limit the story turns out to be pretty interesting and amusing . This film is considered to be the third live action film to have its main hero as a thoughtful, feeling , self aware animal . Andy Serkis's distinctive features prove to be recognisable even under ¨Motion Capture¨ FX images . One of the first feature films to use motion-capture in a so-called 'on location' setting , formerly , motion-capture was limited to special studio set up with special ¨motion-capture¨ cameras in very clearly defined surroundings . Similar the previous films, this is an Apes movie to have CGI apes and with arm extensions . Remaining cast formed by Gorilla , Chimpanzees , Orangutans and other apes are nice , in spite of overlong scenes in Motion Capture they are still nicely and compellingly made . Writing credits by Rick Jaffa & Amanda Silver , along with Mark Bomback and Matt Reeves himself , their screenplay is just clever and including interesting issues about human being and animals . One of the important attributes of this work, is the magnificent and luminous cinematography by Michael Seresin . Epic as well as emotive musical score by Michael Giacchino , it's full of fury and sound . Motion picture was well directed by Matt Reeves (Dawn of the Planet of the Apes , Let me in , Cloverfield)\n\nOther adaptations based on the characters created by Pierre Boulle are as follows : The original and the best is ¨Planet of Apes¨ by Franklyn J. Schaffner with Charlton Heston , Roddy MacDowall, Kim Hunter , followed by \"Beneath the Planet of the Apes\" (1970) with James Franciscus , Linda Harrison , Maurice Evans ; it's followed by three inferior sequels : Escape from the planet of apes , Conquest for battle of Apes and Battle for Planet of Apes. A reboot Planet of Apes 2011 by Tim Burton . And new remakes : Rise of the planet of Apes 2011, and Dawn of the Planet of Apes (2014) .\n\n...of an Academy Award.\n\nA lot of people felt Serkis should have won for his portrayal of Gollum, but he puts that performance to shame with his turn as the not-so-poker faced leader of the apes, Caesar.\n\nIt's the understated emotion that really bubbles to the surface in Serkis' depiction of the reluctant but always resolute Caesar.\n\nIt's not easy to give a performance through a CGI ape and convey to the audience through vocal intonations and an extremely limited speaking script the hurt, the ambition, the hate, and the pain that Caesar feels, yet paired with an incredibly talented special effects team, Serkis manages to pull it off.\n\nI suppose I can't give all the credit to them, because the script for this film is way above par. It works on so many different levels, and it's really quite something because I just got done watching Godzilla vs Kong, and oh boy is there such a stark difference in screenplay quality between the two films.\n\nAll while watching War For The Planet of the Apes I was thinking to myself \"Why couldn't the Transformers get this sort of on-screen characterization and treatment?\" The Hollywood excuse is always \"No one wants to see robots fighting for two hours!\" and yet that's always the best and only parts worth watching when it comes to the Transformer films.\n\nHere, however, director Matt Reeves flipped the script (I suppose you could say literally) by putting the focus on the CGI apes instead of the humans. The entire story is about Caesar -- everyone else plays second fiddle to Caesar.\n\nIt basically proves that you can make a quality, character-driven film without tacking on some ridiculous human sub-plots just to pad out the time or tie together action scenes.\n\nIn this particular case War For The Planet Of The Apes is probably misnomer given that this is not an action film. Yes, there are action scenes, but this is all character drama, with a few action set pieces to payoff the trilogy.\n\nI thought the original Dawn of the Planet Of The Apes was an okay film, nothing too memorable. I didn't care all that much for Rise of the Planet of the Apes. However, I have to say that I adore War For The Planet Of The Apes.\n\nThe difference boils down to bringing the emotion out of the leads (who are all CGI apes), giving the main antagonist a complex and multi-dimensional approach to his self-proclaimed \"purpose\" and a few twists you likely won't see coming.\n\nI can understand why a lot of people may not like the film because it's methodically filmed and paced. This isn't The Fast & The Furious, and if you go in expecting more \"War\" rather than \"Planet of the Apes\" then I suppose you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nHowever, if you're looking for a movie that's actually really well directed, better written than it has any reason to be, and a lot more emotionally driven than most other Oscar-bait dramas, then you'll definitely enjoy War For The Planet Of The Apes.\n\nAnd it still irks me that Serkis wasn't even nominated for an Oscar for his performance. I didn't bother checking to see who won best actor for 2017, but I'm finding it hard to believe anyone turned in a more layered, heartfelt, and multi-dimensional performance than Serkis did with Caesar."
