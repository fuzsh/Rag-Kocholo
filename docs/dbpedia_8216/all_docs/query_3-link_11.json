        "text": "Chris later shared more pics from their “epic family trip” in the UAE’s capital.\n\nHere’s what we know about Luke Hemsworth, Chris and Liam’s older bro:\n\nLuke Hemsworth is the eldest Hemsworth brother\n\nLuke, Chris and Liam were all born in Melbourne, Australia to their parents Craig and Leonie Hemsworth. Luke is the eldest at 43, while Chris is 40, and Liam is the youngest, being 33 years old. Per People, the boys grew up in Melbourne, the Outback and on Phillip Island, before they began their respective careers in showbiz.\n\nWhat is Luke Hemsworth famous for?\n\nHe’s married\n\nAll the Hemsworth brothers are currently taken.\n\nLiam, who is set to take over from Henry Cavill’s coveted role on The Witcher, has been dating model Gabriella Brooks for three years, according to Elle, while Chris has been married to Spanish model and actress Elsa Pataky since 2010.\n\nLuke has been married to his wife Samantha Hemsworth since 2007.\n\nDo the Hemsworth brothers get along?\n\nIt’s clear that the star siblings are very close to one another and even share a competitive streak – but not when it comes to acting. “People try to pair us off like there’s this vicious competitiveness and, ‘Arghhh! You got that part and I didn’t’ and stuff, which isn’t the case,” Chris told Entertainment Tonight in 2017. “Get us at home, playing cricket or football or surfing or something, and yeah, there’s a great rivalry there – a very healthy one,” he added."
