        "text": "A rising superbike star is targeting glory at the Isle of Man TT race - thanks to two of the region's businesses.\n\nMike Norbury, 23, is entering the legendary motorsport event this weekend as a newcomer - but dreams of standing on top of the podium as champ.\n\nThe Astley bike mechanic hopes to one day ride professionally and has been given a helping hand by Stockport-based ECTA Racing and new sponsor Rawson Digital.\n\nNorbury races in the superbike, superstock and supersport 600 categories, and spends every spare moment working on the team’s two race bikes and training in the gym.\n\nHe said: “My main focus this year is to do well at the Isle of Man TT. I’ve got my entry and it’s a meeting I’ve always dreamed of racing at.\n\n“I’d love to win the TT one day and be regarded as one of the top riders. I’d love to do this professionally one day.\n\n“It’s a big step up to make though - these guys have been doing it for years. I’m only in my fifth season.\n\n“In the short term my aim is to be the fastest newcomer at as many meetings as I can.”\n\nNorbury could have gone on to be a professional rugby league player having been offered a scholarship at Salford Red Devils, but he was always destined for a career in motorsport.\n\n“Mum and Dad always had bikes,\" he said. \"Dad used to race himself. They even had their honeymoon at the Isle of Man TT.\n\n“They were the reason I started racing although dad was never keen on me doing it when I was kid.\n\n“He wanted me to focus on rugby. I got offered a scholarship at Salford when I was 16/17 but once I started going out on my road bike I was hooked.\n\n“I don’t think about the dangers, it doesn’t bother me, so it’s best that I get to ride in a controlled environment.\n\n“There are about 10-12 race meetings on the road racing calendar and also a few smaller events.\n\n“Of course I enjoy the thrill of the ride and the buzz of racing but a big part of it for me is the camaraderie.\n\n“Most events are the whole weekend so it’s like going camping with your mates and getting to go out at ride while you’re there.\n\n“For the Isle of Man TT you can be there for up to three weeks as there are a week of qualifiers and a week of races.”\n\nECTA Racing was founded last year by Dave Berry, the managing director of ECTA training – a provider of Smart Meter, gas, electric and trade skills courses - based in Heaton Norris.\n\nNorbury said: \"I’d been racing on my own for the last four years. My dad knows Dave who runs the team and he said he’d been keeping an eye on me.\n\n“I started racing for them in September last year. I’d never had a podium finish before and in my first three races for the team I had a first place finish at Anglesey and second at Aintree.\n\n“I’ve also finished sixth at a senior race meeting in Scarborough. That’s a bigger race with more competitors so I was pleased with that one.\n\n“I never thought I’d get to ride for a team so it’s been fantastic for me. It really takes the pressure off.\"\n\nUntil securing the backing of ECTA Racing and Rawson Digital, Norbury had to find the money for his equipment and the bike.\n\n“When I was racing on my own all my finances were used on equipment and the bike which was old and average,\" he said.\n\n“I went through three engines which cost me thousands. I’d saved up all winter for a new engine and in the first event of 2017 at Anglesey it blew up.\n\n“Having the Rawson Digital sponsorship is also crucial to us. I can’t thank them enough. Without their support we wouldn’t be able to race.”\n\nECTA Racing chief Berry said Norbury is a rising star of the sport.\n\n“A TT win would be a dream come true,\" he said. \"I grew up on the Isle of Man so it’s something that has always been a part of my life.\n\n“I’ve always been a big fan of road racing so that was a motivation for setting up the team.\"\n\n“We’re really excited about the 2018 season. Mike is not only the star of ECTA Racing but a rising star of the entire sport.\n\n“We’ve got high hopes for him. He’s made a really good start and has entry on both bikes for the TT.”\n\nVaughn Rawson, MD of Rawson Digital, which supplies and maintains photocopiers and printers to across the North West and North Wales, said: \"I’m excited to be involved with a racing team and a rising star in the sport in Mike Norbury.\n\n“I wish ECTA Racing and Mike the best of luck for the season ahead, which I’m sure is going to be a very successful one.”"
