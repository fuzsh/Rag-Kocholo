        "text": "Out of all the Avengers stars, Chris Hemsworth had the easiest time selling his character to the world. Not just because he looks like a Norse god when you give him a hammer and a funny hat, but because audiences had virtually seen no other prior Hemsworth performances to influence their perception of him. Before arriving on American shores, Hemsworth shot 171 episodes of long-running Australian soap Home and Away (approximately 2.5% of total episodes to date). He made a notable corpse in the Star Trek reboot as George Kirk in the opening scene. And that about sums up Hemsworth’s pre-Thor career.\n\nSince his 2011 MCU debut, Hemsworth has shown a loyalty not just to franchises (he’s been in both Huntsman movies, and came back for Star Trek Into Darkness) but directors, like Ron Howard (Rush, In the Heart of the Sea) and Drew Goddard (The Cabin in the Woods, Bad Time as the El Royale). It suggests Hemsworth is an affable sort, a quality that helped him steer Thor through two decent-to-average movies before blossoming in the renegade Thor: Ragnarok, and becoming the true hero of Avengers: Infinity War.\n\nMost recently, he’s been on Netflix with Extraction, a rough action throwback produced by the Russo brothers, and Spiderhead, a thriller directed by Top Gun: Maverick‘s Joseph Kosinski. And now he’s back in the MCU for 2022’s Thor: Love & Thunder. Let’s take a look on every Chris Hemsworth movie ranked by Tomatometer! —Alex Vo\n\n#1\n\nAvengers: Endgame (2019) 94%\n\n#1\n\nAdjusted Score: 123952%\n\nCritics Consensus: Exciting, entertaining, and emotionally impactful, Avengers: Endgame does whatever it takes to deliver a satisfying finale to Marvel's epic Infinity Saga.\n\nSynopsis: Adrift in space with no food or water, Tony Stark sends a message to Pepper Potts as his oxygen supply...
