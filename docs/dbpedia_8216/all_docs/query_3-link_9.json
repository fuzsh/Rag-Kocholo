        "text": "Christopher Hemsworth AM (born August 11, 1983) is an Australian actor. He first became famous playing the role of Kim Hyde in the Australian television series Home and Away (2004–2007) before beginning a film career in Hollywood. In the United States, he is most well-known for playing Thor in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). He has played in action films, thrillers, comedies, and biographical films. In 2024, he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nEarly life\n\nChristopher Hemsworth was born on August 11, 1983, in Melbourne, to Leonie (née van Os), an English teacher, and Craig Hemsworth, a social-services counselor. He has two brothers, both of whom are also actors. Luke was born in 1980 and Liam was born in 1990. He has Dutch, Irish, English, Scottish, and German ancestry. He was brought up both in Melbourne and in the Outback in Bulman, Northern Territory of Australia. He attended high school at Heathmont College before his family returned to the Northern Territory. A few years later, they moved to Phillip Island.\n\nCareer\n\nEarly work (2002–2010)\n\nHemsworth started his career by appearing in several television series. He moved to Sydney and joined the cast of the Australian soap opera Home and Away, playing Kim Hyde. He left the cast on July 3, 2007.\n\nBeginning in September of 2007, Chris was a contestant on the fifth season of Dancing with the Stars Australia. After six weeks of competition, he and his partner were eliminated.\n\nIn 2009, Hemsworth played James T. Kirk's father, George Kirk, in the opening scenes of J. J. Abrams' film Star Trek. The role was initially offered to Matt Damon, who turned it down. In November 2010, The Hollywood Reporter named Hemsworth one of the young male actors who are \"pushing – or being pushed\" onto the Hollywood \"A-List.\"\n\nThor and worldwide recognition (2011–2015)\n\nIn 2011, Hemsworth was cast as the superhero Thor in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. His first film in the franchise was 2011's Thor. He and castmate Tom Hiddleston, who played Loki, had each auditioned for the role. Hemsworth played Thor again in The Avengers (2012) as one of the six superheroes—alongside Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark / Iron Man, Chris Evans' Steve Rogers / Captain America, Mark Ruffalo's Bruce Banner / Hulk, Scarlett Johansson's Natasha Romanova / Black Widow, and Jeremy Renner's Clint Barton / Hawkeye—sent to defend Earth from his adopted brother, Loki.\n\nHemsworth later starred opposite Kristen Stewart in the film Snow White and the Huntsman (2012) as the Huntsman. He played Jed Eckert in the 2012 Red Dawn remake.\n\nIn 2013, Hemsworth starred in Ron Howard's sports drama film Rush, as 1976 Formula 1 World Champion James Hunt. Later that year, he played Thor again in Thor: The Dark World.\n\nIn 2015, Hemsworth starred in director Michael Mann's action thriller Blackhat, opposite Viola Davis. He was cast as a hacker, which audiences did not like.\n\nThat same year, he co-starred in the comedy film Vacation, along with Ed Helms. His last 2015 film was In the Heart of the Sea, based on the book of the same name by Nathaniel Philbrick, with Hemsworth playing first mate Owen Chase.\n\nContinued commercial success (2016–present)\n\nIn 2016, Hemsworth played Eric the Huntsman again in The Huntsman: Winter's War. Hemsworth later joined the cast of the reboot Ghostbusters film, playing Kevin the receptionist.\n\nHemsworth repeated his role as Thor in Thor: Ragnarok, released on November 3, 2017, in the U.S., and again in both the third and fourth Avengers films, Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame in 2018 and 2019. All three films were quite successful.\n\nIn 2019, Hemsworth also starred in a spin-off of the Men in Black series, titled Men in Black: International. The following year, he starred in the Netflix action thriller Extraction. In 2020, Hemsworth played Thor again in the film Thor: Love and Thunder.\n\nHemsworth returned as Tyler Rake in Netflix's Extraction 2 (2023), which earned him $20 million. He then starred in the Mad Max: Fury Road spin-off Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga, released in May 2024.\n\nUpcoming projects\n\nHemsworth will next star in the Mad Max: Fury Road spin-off Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga. He will also voice a younger Optimus Prime in the Transformers prequel film Transformers One.\n\nPublic image\n\nAfter appearing as Thor in the MCU franchise, Hemsworth's physique gained attention from fans. The media has discussed his workout routines since they know that people would love to have a \"body like Thor's.\" Hemsworth later created the fitness app called Centr, which shows customers how to \"train, eat, and live better.\"\n\nHemsworth is an avid supporter of the Western Bulldogs in the Australian Football League. He was the star of the AFL's 2014 Everything's Possible campaign, donating the fees for his involvement to the Australian Children Foundation. Hemsworth also starred in the AFL's 2017 \"I'd Like to See That\" commercial.\n\nWealth\n\nAs his career in Hollywood films has developed, Hemsworth has become one of the world's highest-paid actors. He appeared in Forbes' World's Highest Paid Actors list in 2014, 2015, and 2018. He was also 31st in the magazine's list of Highest Paid Celebrities in 2018 and 24th in 2019, with estimated earnings of US$76.4 million.\n\nCharity\n\nIn May 2020, Chris and his brother Liam were among the celebrities who read part of Roald Dahl's James and the Giant Peach in aid of the global-non profit charity Partners In Health. The charity was co-founded by Dahl's daughter Ophelia, and it was fighting COVID-19 in vulnerable areas.\n\nPersonal life\n\nHemsworth began dating Spanish model and actress Elsa Pataky in early 2010, and they married in December 2010. The couple has a daughter, India Rose, born in May 2012, and twin sons, Sasha and Tristan, born in March 2014. In 2015, the family moved from Los Angeles to Byron Bay, New South Wales, in his native Australia.\n\nHemsworth was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia in the 2021 Queen's Birthday Honors.\n\nIn episode five of his National Geographic documentary Limitless (2022), Hemsworth revealed that his maternal grandfather suffers from Alzheimer's disease. It was also revealed that Hemsworth has inherited two copies of the APOE4 gene, one from his mother and one from his father, making it eight to ten times likelier for him to develop Alzheimer's disease eventually than the general population.\n\nChris Hemsworth quotes\n\n\"Work all paled into the background as soon as I had a baby.\"\n\n\"Probably my most vivid memories were up there in Bulman with crocodiles and buffalo.\"\n\n\"People who put themselves on the line and sacrifice their own safety for the greater good and for others, and anyone in any profession whose concern is the welfare for other people instead of the individual, are inspiring and important.\"\n\n\"True happiness is not expensive. If it requires a high price, it’s a fake.\"\n\n\"Being a father is certainly a task…but the best one that I could ever ask for. Being home, being with the family-that’s what it’s about.\"\n\nInteresting facts about Chris Hemsworth\n\nChris' aunt was once married to Rod Ansell, the Australian bushman who was the basis for the character in Crocodile Dundee.\n\nChris' character in the 2012 remake of the movie Red Dawn, Jed Eckert, was played by Patrick Swayze in the original movie.\n\nHemsworth was born on a Thursday, the day of the week named for Thor.\n\nChris gained twenty pounds of muscle to play the role of Thor.\n\nChris is close to his Avengers co-stars.\n\nHe wants people to be real and candid with him rather than to flatter him.\n\nHe likes to keep his family first and does not enjoy being followed by the press.\n\nHis childhood nicknames were \"Kip\" and \"Hemsy.\"\n\nFilmography\n\nFilm\n\nYear Title Role Notes 2009 Star Trek George Kirk A Perfect Getaway Kale Garrity 2010 Ca$h Sam Phelan 2011 Thor Thor 2012 The Cabin in the Woods Curt Vaughan The Avengers Thor Snow White and the Huntsman Eric the Huntsman Red Dawn Jed Eckert 2013 Star Trek Into Darkness George Kirk (voice) Cameo Rush James Hunt Thor: The Dark World Thor 2015 Blackhat Nicholas Hathaway Avengers: Age of Ultron Thor Vacation Stone Crandall In the Heart of the Sea Owen Chase 2016 The Huntsman: Winter's War Eric the Huntsman Ghostbusters Kevin Beckman / Rowan North Team Thor Thor Short film Doctor Strange Cameo; mid-credits scene 2017 Team Thor: Part 2 Short film Thor: Ragnarok 2018 12 Strong Captain Mitch Nelson Avengers: Infinity War Thor Bad Times at the El Royale Billy Lee 2019 Avengers: Endgame Thor Men in Black: International Henry / Agent H Jay and Silent Bob Reboot Himself Cameo 2020 Extraction Tyler Rake Also producer 2022 Interceptor TV salesman Uncredited cameo and executive producer Spiderhead Steve Abnesti Also producer Thor: Love and Thunder Thor Also executive producer 2023 Extraction 2 Tyler Rake Also producer 2024 Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga Dementus Deadpool & Wolverine Thor Cameo Transformers One Orion Pax / Optimus Prime Voice role TBA Project X TBA Post-production\n\nKey Denotes films that have not yet been released\n\nTelevision\n\nYear Title Role Notes 2002 Guinevere Jones King Arthur 3 episodes Neighbours Jamie Kane Season 18 (Episode #4069) Marshall Law The Kid Episode: \"Domestic Bliss\" 2003 Saddle Club, The The New Vet Episode: \"Tenderfoot\" 2004 Fergus McPhail Craig Episode: \"In a Jam\" 2004–2007 Home and Away Kim Hyde Seasons 17–20 (189 episodes) 2006 Dancing with the Stars Himself 5th place 2015 Saturday Night Live Host 2 episodes 2021 Loki Throg (voice) Episode: \"Journey into Mystery\"; uncredited 2021 Shark Beach with Chris Hemsworth Himself Television special 2021–present What If...?
