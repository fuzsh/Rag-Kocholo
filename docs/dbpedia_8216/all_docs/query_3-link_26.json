        "text": "Background\n\nLiam Hemsworth is hardworking, confident, and attractive, and that has endeared him to the hearts of millions worldwide. Born in Melbourne, Australia, to Leonie and Craig Hemsworth, he has become wildly popular, especially for his identity as “one of the Hemsworth brothers,” a trio of actors. However, before his interest in acting, he took up flooring work and was even employed as a park ranger. As a Capricorn, he is determined, ambitious, and strong, so it is no surprise that he decided to follow in the steps of his older siblings. He accepted minor roles in the “Home And Away” show and “McLeod’s Daughters” in 2007. He took up recurring roles in the television series “Neighbors” and “Satisfaction.”\n\nHis official debut was in the 2009 movie, “Knowing,” where he plays the role of an MIT student. Afterward, he landed a Disney role in “The Last Song,” where he acted as Miley Cyrus’s character’s love interest. His career got blown into the stratosphere with his role as Gale Hawthorne in the film adaptation of the book trilogy, “The Hunger Games.” Since then, he has featured in the Australian adaptation of “Victoria,” “Independence Day: Resurgence,” and — following a three-year break — “Isn’t It Romantic?”\n\nHe wed his costar, Miley Cyrus, whom he later divorced in 2020. A seasoned philanthropist, Hemsworth is the ambassador of the Australian Children Foundation. He passionately believes in a free and safe world for all children and has since gained support for his cause from other celebrities.\n\nHemsworth is a private man compared to his siblings, and is an intriguing enigma. We understand why the world loves him, and we love him too."
