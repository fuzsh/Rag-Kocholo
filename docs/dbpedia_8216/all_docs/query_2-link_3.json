        "text": "Return of the Mick\n\nWe are delighted to announce that Mick Norbury has re-joined the Ossett United coaching team with immediate effect.\n\nAfter a brief time away from Ingfield, Mick Norbury has returned to the coaching team.\n\nGrant Black is delighted to have Norbs back in the dugout saying “he knows how we work and has been part of the success we've had as a management tram over the years.\n\nFrom cup finals, FA cup runs to Notts County and Solihull Moors, as well as promotion to the NPL prem all with me so it was a no brainer when the option came around again to work with norbs again. I couldn't turn it down and all the coaching staff said the same thing so welcome back Norbs.\n\nNorbury: “They say in football when one door closes another opens and I’m glad it’s this door and the opportunity to come back to Ossett United with Grant and the lads.\n\nI want to try and finish what we started when we came back into the club a year ago.\n\nSince then a lot as gone on with me moving on to another club and while that has not worked out I wish them all the best going forward. Now I want to concentrate on helping take us forward, I’ve been outside looking in since leaving the club and seen some good performances and signings and hopefully with a run of wins we start climbing the league.\n\nI’m looking forward to meeting and working with the new group and seeing you all again Saturday”\n\nWelcome Back Norbs! #StrongerTogether"
