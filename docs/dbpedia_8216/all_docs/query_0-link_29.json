        "text": "By anybody’s standards, 2023 was a pretty great year for movies. Past Lives, Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse, Barbie, Oppenheimer… the list goes on. But do you know what? We reckon 2024 is going to be even better! From big, bold blockbusters to intimate indie dramas, and from spectacular sequels to animated epics to long-awaited passion projects, 2024 is shaping up to be a year filled with wall-to-wall bangers. This is the year we’ll return to Arrakis (finally!) for Dune Part Two, get back to bustin’ in New York with Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire, witness the return of Hugh Jackman’s Wolverine in Deadpool 3, put the pedal to the metal in Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga, head to South America for Paddington In Peru, and get new joints from Ethan Coen, Bong Joon-Ho, and Tim Burton. Phew!\n\nEmpire’s mammoth 2024 preview is your guide to the biggest and best films hitting UK cinemas and streaming services over the next 12 months. Whether you’re after a heartstopping horror, a rollicking action romp, a timeless love story, or a musical take on Gotham’s Clown Prince of Crime, there truly is something here for everyone. So grab yourselves some popcorn (make ours a large!), get the best seats in the house (dead centre, naturally), and we’ll catch you at the movies!\n\n1 January\n\nPriscilla\n\nSofia Coppola explores the other side of the Elvis story, with Cailee Spaeny playing the (astonishingly) young Priscilla-who-would-be-Presley. Saltburn’s Jacob Elordi is The King who has her all shook up.\n\nOne Life\n\nAnthony Hopkins plays real-life hero Nicholas Winton, who helped rescue a number of Jewish children during World War II – and who was interviewed in his later years about his experience in a famous BBC broadcast.\n\n5 January\n\nThe Goldfinger\n\nThe legendary Tony Leung stars in this Hong Kong crime thriller, playing the founder of a multi-billion-dollar business which might be entangled in criminal wrongdoings.\n\nNight Swim\n\nThere’s something in the swimming pool!

Coming to Amazon Prime Video.\n\n17 January\n\nMean Girls\n\nAs the trailers will tell you, this film updates Tina Fey and Mark Waters’ 2004 teen classic (now 20 years old!) with ‘a new twist’. The trailers – for some reason – won’t tell you that the twist is that it’s an adaptation of the stage musical. Fey returns to write and star as Ms. Norbury, but Angourie Rice is Cady Heron, and there are fresh Plastics in Reneé Rapp, Bebe Wood and Avantika Vandanapu.\n\n19 January\n\nThe Holdovers\n\nSideways filmmaker Alexander Payne and star Paul Giamatti reunite for a warm and wonderful comedy drama. Set in the ‘70s, it stars Giamatti as Mr. Hunham – a cantankerous teacher forced to stay at Barton Academy over Christmas with angry teen Angus (Dominic Sessa) and grieving cook Mary (Da’Vine Joy Randolph).

Henson as Shug Avery.

Action-centric thriller from writer-director Jamie Childs.\n\nBadland Hunters\n\nTrain To Busan and Eternals star Ma Dong-seok leads this post-apocalyptic sequel to 2023 Korean hit Concrete Utopia – which hasn’t received a proper UK release yet.

This is his fourth, following Sexy Beast, Birth, and Under The Skin – a deeply unsettling historical drama about the mundanity of evil, depicting the life of a Nazi officer and his family, right next to the unseen horrors of Auschwitz.\n\nArgylle\n\nMatthew Vaughn is back with a different kind of spy caper – a twisty, meta romp in which author Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard) is forced to partner up with a real-life agent (Sam Rockwell), contrasting with the glossy capers she writes starring the character of superspy Agent Argylle (Henry Cavill). Oh, and it’s supposedly based on a novel by the real Elly Conway, who may not actually exist.\n\nAmerican Fiction\n\nA latecomer in the awards conversation, the feature debut of Cord Jefferson (previously a writer on Watchmen and Succession) is a satire starring Jeffrey Wright as ‘Monk’ Ellison – a disgruntled author who pens a book packed with exaggerated stereotypes about the Black experience, only for it to become a major hit.\n\nMigration\n\nNew animation from Illumination, the studio behind Minions and Mario Bros. A family of ducks head on a globe-trotting journey from New England to Jamaica – penned by The White Lotus and School Of Rock’s Mike White, with voices from Kumail Nanjiani, Elizabeth Banks, Keegan-Michael Key and Awkwafina.\n\nThe Persian Version\n\nA hit from Sundance in 2023. Maryam Keshavarz writes and directs a comedy-drama in which American-Iranian woman Leila (Layla Mohammadi) navigates an unexpected pregnancy, clashes with her mother, and a family reunion.\n\nOrion And The Dark\n\nWhat does a family-friendly animated comedy look like when penned by Charlie Kaufman, and featuring the voice of Werner Herzog?

The sequel will pick up exactly where the first film left off, with Riley facing the imminent onslaught of puberty, bringing with it fresh emotions – including Maya Hawke as Anxiety.\n\n21 June\n\nThe Bikeriders\n\nDelayed from 2024, Jeff Nichols’ ‘60s-set biker drama boasts a stellar cast – with Austin Butler, Tom Hardy, Mike Faist, Norman Reedus, Michael Shannon and more set to rev up, alongside Jodie Comer.\n\n28 June\n\nA Quiet Place: Day One\n\nPrepare to creep back into cinemas for a prequel to the Krasinski films – this one’s set in the Big Apple, as the noise-sensitive aliens attack. Pig director Michael Sarnoski is in charge this time, and cooked up the story with Krasinski himself. Starring Lupita Nyong’o, Stranger Things’ Joseph Quinn, Alex Wolff, and Djimon Hounsou.\n\n12 July\n\nDespicable Me 4\n\nListen up, GentleMinions – Gru and the little yellow mischief-makers are back. Details are scarce for now, but expect fatherhood, supervillainy and slapstick antics galore from veteran director Chris Renaud and writer Mike White.\n\n19 July\n\nTwisters\n\nYes, it’s a sequel (of sorts) to ‘90s favourite disaster movie Twister. Yes, it’s really being directed by Minari’s Lee Isaac Chung. And yes, it somehow features an astonishing human cast of Hollywood up-and-comers: Daisy Edgar-Jones, Glen Powell, Anthony Ramos, Daryl McCormack, Sasha Lane, Kiernan Shipka, Katy M. O’Brian, and new Superman David Corenswet to name but a few. Cows being sucked up into tornados are yet tbc.\n\n26 July\n\nDeadpool 3\n\nThe only MCU movie coming in 2024 – but it’s a biggie. Ryan Reynolds’ Mr. Pool makes his debut in Kevin Feige’s sandbox, and he’s bringing Hugh Jackman’s Wolverine with him (in the iconic yellow costume, no less). Jennifer Garner reportedly returns as Fox-era Elektra, while rumours abound about Taylor Swift cameoing too. Directed by Shawn Levy.\n\n2 August\n\nTrap\n\nM Night Shyamalan returns with a mysterious new thriller starring Josh Hartnett. We know next to nothing, other than it’s written and directed by Shyamalan, and will be his first film in a new deal with Warner Bros. An appearance from Admiral Ackbar is yet tbc.\n\nHarold And The Purple Crayon\n\nAnother film in the post-Paddington kid-lit-turned-family-movie boom. Carlos Saldanha (formerly of the Ice Age movies) directs the tale of a four year old and his magical purple crayon, starring Zachary Levi, Lil Red Howery, and Zooey Deschanel. Though presumably not as Harold, or the crayon.\n\n9 August\n\nSpeak No Evil\n\nChristian Tafdrup’s notoriously brutal Danish horror – in which a family’s rural holiday is thoroughly ruined in unspeakable ways – gets a Blumhouse remake from Eden Lake’s James Watkins, starring James McCoy, Mackenzie Davis and Scoot McNairy. Expect it to get tongues wagging.\n\nBorderlands\n\nAfter considerable delays and swapping around of creative parties, the film adaptation of the Borderlands games is finally expected this year – ostensibly directed by Eli Roth, who shot it back in 2021, with reshoots from Tim Miller. Starring the likes of Cate Blanchett, Kevin Hart, Jack Black, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Ariana Greenblatt.\n\n16 August\n\nUntitled Alien Movie\n\nFede Álvarez tackles the Xenomorph in a film expected to be titled Alien: Romulus, and set to take place between Alien and Aliens. Cailee Spaeny, Isabela Merced and Rye Lane’s David Jonsson are among those battling the acid-blooded meanie. Ridley Scott produces, but this doesn’t continue the Prometheus / Covenant threads.\n\n30 August\n\nKraven The Hunter\n\nThe Spidey villain gets his own SPUMC movie, with Aaron Taylor-Johnson playing the hulking hunter. JC Chandor directs, while Ariana DeBose, Russell Crowe and Christopher Abbott round out the cast.\n\n6 September\n\nBeetlejuice 2\n\nJump in the line, rock your body in time – the long-awaited Beetlejuice sequel is finally coming. Michael Keaton is back in the black-and-white stripes for director Tim Burton, while Winona Ryder and Catherine O’Hara also return. The big new addition? Wednesday’s Jenna Ortega, as Lydia’s daughter Astrid Deetz. Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice!\n\n27 September\n\nSaw XI\n\nDo you want to play a game? For the eleventh time? The success of 2023’s Saw X means Jigsaw will once again be back with a fresh batch of traps, in time for the Halloween season.\n\n4 October\n\nJoker: Folie À Deux\n\nTodd Phillips follows up his ‘70s Scorsese-riffing DC drama with a sequel that brings in Lady Gaga as Harley Quinn, with a title pointing to their shared delusions. Oh, and apparently it’s a musical.\n\n18 October\n\nTransformers One\n\nThe Autobots get animated in a fresh take on the robots-in-disguise franchise, from director Josh Cooley. It’s expected to be set entirely on Cybertron, exploring the initial rift between Optimus Prime (Chris Hemsworth) and Megatron (Brian Tyree Henry). Also featuring the voices of Scarlett Johansson, Keegan-Michael Key, Jon Hamm, and Laurence Fishburne.\n\nSmile 2\n\n2021’s horror hit gets a sequel from original writer-director Parker Finn. Details are scarce, but Naomi Scott has been cast in the lead role.\n\nThe Wild Robot\n\nLilo & Stitch and How To Train Your Dragon director Chris Sanders helms a DreamWorks animated feature, in which a shipwrecked robot cares for an orphaned gosling. We’re already crying. Based on Peter Brown’s 2016 kids’ book.\n\n25 October\n\nThe Wolf Man\n\nThe latest entry in Universal’s classic monster canon retoolings (see also The Invisible Man and Renfield) will see Christopher Abbott (Poor Things) star alongside Julia Garner (The Royal Hotel). Having previously given up the director’s hotseat to Derek Cianfrance, horror veteran filmmaker Leigh Whannell is now back aboard to direct.\n\n8 November\n\nPaddington In Peru\n\nEverybody’s favourite big screen bear (sorry Winnie The Pooh, sorry Cocaine Bear) is headed for Peru in the hotly anticipated threequel. New faces along for the ride include Antonio Banderas and Olivia Colman, as well as Emily Mortimer — who has replaced Sally Hawkins in the role of Mrs Brown. Feature filmmaking newcomer Dougal Wilson – a proven master of the tearjerker with his John Lewis Christmas ads – is in charge of completing what could be the greatest film trilogy ever made. No pressure!\n\nVenom 3\n\nTed Lasso star Juno Temple and the MCU’s Mordo, Mr. Chiwetel Ejiofor, are getting in on the Carnage and, err, all SPUMC-ed up in the next symbiote sequel. The return of Stephen Graham’s Detective Patrick Mulligan – AKA Toxin – is tbc. Two confirmed returnees are series scribe Kelly Marcel, who will also direct this time out, and star Tom Hardy, who’s also chipped in on the story front. And, er, also took the above snap of himself screaming at some dog graffiti to announce the film. Lovely stuff.\n\nThe Amateur\n\nRami Malek will play CIA cryptographer Charles Heller in the latest adaptation of author Robert Littell’s classic espionage thriller. One Life director James Hawes helms the film, which also stars the DCU’s new Lois Lane Rachel Brosnahan, plus Caitríona Balfe and Laurence Fishburne.\n\n15 November\n\nAlto Knights\n\nWe’ve had multiple Robert De Niro mobster movies, but filmmaker Barry Levinson’s (Good Morning Vietnam, Rain Man) latest is the first multiple Robert De Niro mobsters movie. Yes, in this one, De Niro plays both Vito Genovese and Frank Costello, two Italian-American mob bosses who went to war with each other back in the 50s. Double De Niro? Now there’s an offer we can’t refuse.\n\n22 November\n\nGladiator 2\n\nEntertainment is near-guaranteed with Ridley Scott’s long-gestating sequel to Gladiator (a film that’s, quite literally, Scott’s Roman Empire). Paul Mescal leads an all-star cast as Lucius, the now-fully grown nephew of Joaquin Phoenix’s Commodus from the first film. Mescal will be joined by Denzel Washington, Pedro Pascal, Joseph Quinn, and Connie Nielsen. Thumbs up from us so far.\n\n29 November\n\nWicked\n\n13 December\n\nBrian Cox voices the legendary King of Rohan who gave Helm’s Deep its name in this animated Lord Of The Rings prequel, set 261 years before the events of The Fellowship Of The Ring. With Miranda Otto reprising the role of Éowyn from Peter Jackson’s trilogy, anime legend Kenji Kamiyama (Ghost In The Shell, Jin-Roh, Star Wars: Visions) on directorial duty, and the movie taking visual inspiration from Jackson’s films, our hopes are high. Forth Éorlingas! Forth Helm Hammerhand!\n\nThe Karate Kid\n\nWith Netflix’s Cobra Kai having regalvanised the Karate Kid franchise on the small scree, an as-yet-untitled re-reboot is headed for the big screen – with both OG franchise lead Daniel Larusso (Ralph Macchio) and the 2010 reboot’s Miyagi-like mentor Mr. Han (Jackie Chan) set to co-star. Whether the film ties into the upcoming finale of Cobra Kai remains to be seen.\n\n20 December\n\nSonic The Hedgehog 3\n\nFollowing a blink-and-you'll-miss-it appearance at the end of Sonic The Hedgehog 2, iconic videogame antihero Shadow The Hedgehog is set to join Sonic (Ben Schwartz), Tails (Colleen O'Shaughnessey), and Knuckles (Idris Elba) in Jeff Fowler’s upcoming trilogy closer. Since Jim Carrey announced his retirement following the release of Sonic 2, we’ll have to wait and see whether his big-bad Doctor Robotnik returns.\n\nMufasa: The Lion King\n\nMoonlight director Barry Jenkins’ ‘live-action’ (read: photo real-animated) The Lion King prequel-sequel charts the rise of Simba’s father Mufasa, one of the Pride Lands’ great kings. The Underground Railroad and Old star Aaron Pierre has the unenviable task of filling James Earl Jones’s legendary boots (paws?), whilst Chevalier lead Kelvin Harrison Jr. voices Scar. Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen return as Timon and Pumbaa, as does John Kani as Rafiki.\n\nDate Unknown\n\nMickey 17\n\nGet ready for another Bong hit! Parasite filmmaker Bong Joon-Ho is back with an existential sci-fi starring Robert Pattinson as an ‘expendable’ human on a mission to colonise a new planet. Also starring Steven Yeun, Naomi Ackie, Toni Collette and Mark Ruffalo, and based on Edward Ashton’s novel Mickey7 (stay tuned for where those other 10 Mickeys came from).\n\nBeverly Hills Cop: Axel F\n\nEddie Murphy’s legendary Detroit PD Lieutenant Axel Foley is back in action and on the Beverly Hills beat in the long-awaited fourquel. Taylour Paige (Zola) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt enter the fray alongside a returning Judge Reinhold, with Mark Molloy directing and the screenplay coming courtesy of Will Beall and The Unbearable Weight Of Massive Talent duo Tom Gormican and Kevin Etten. Strike up the synths and BYOB (Bring Your Own Bananas) – Axel’s back, baby!\n\nHavoc\n\nTom Hardy is a bruised detective on a one-man mission to save a politician’s son in the latest action thriller from The Raid series’ director Gareth Evans. Timothy Olyphant and Forest Whitaker also star in the film, which marks Evans’ second Netflix collaboration (2018’s bruising folk-horror Apostle being the first).\n\nThe Old Guard 2\n\nCharlize Theron and her immortal mercenary gang – Matthias Schoenaerts, Marwan Kenzari and Luca Marinelli – are back to kick some ass in the follow-up to Netflix’s ageless (if not quite timeless) 2020 actioner. This time around, Henry Golding and Uma Thurman are getting in on the action too – as is Victoria Mahoney, who has picked up Gina Prince-Bythewood’s directorial battle-axe.\n\nThe Mothership\n\nHalle Berry’s got extraterrestrial objects in her basement, skeletons in the closet, and a missing husband to find in writer-director Matt Charman’s (Bridge Of Spies) upcoming Netflix drama. Honestly, good luck with all that Halle – we’ll just sit tight right here and watch if it’s all the same to you!\n\nThe Electric State\n\nTake two Russo Brothers. Add one Millie Bobby Brown, one Chris Pratt, a Ke Huy Quan, and a Stanley Tucci. Stir in a breathtakingly beautiful graphic novel that’s equal parts The Last Of Us, Wall-E, and early 90s grunge, and leave to slow cook for seven years. Ét voila! You’ve got yourself a recipe for what should be a surefire dystopian sci-fi banger. Fingers crossed this Netflix-bound adaptation of Simon Stålenhag’s 2018 book is electric, and not a total state.\n\nA Family Affair\n\nJoey King (The Kissing Booth) has the grim luck of walking in on her mum (Nicole Kidman) and movie star ex-boss (Zac Efron) making the beast with two backs in Richard LaGravenese’s upcoming Netflix rom-com. Dealing with “the complications of love, sex and identity”, hopefully this one will at least have a happier ending than Kidman and Efron’s last on-screen romance. Yes, The Paperboy, we remember you.\n\nUnfrosted: The Pop-Tart Story\n\nJerry Seinfeld’s infamous Pop-Tart joke is the basis of the comedy legend’s feature directorial debut, a crazy caper centred on Kellogg’s and Post’s race to create the ultimate breakfast pastry in early-60s Michigan. The Netflix exclusive’s sweet ensemble of comic powerhouses includes *deep breath* Melissa McCarthy, Jim Gaffigan, Amy Schumer, Hugh Grant, James Marsden, and Maria Bakalova. Could be a real cereal killer.\n\nUntitled Wallace And Gromit Movie\n\nEverybody’s favourite dog-and-his-man duo head to Netflix, with creator Nick Park and Merlin Crossingham delivering the pair's first outing since 2008’s A Matter Of Loaf And Death . This time out, Gromit once again finds himself having to save his master’s bacon when Wallace’s latest invention, the “Smart Gnome”, goes rogue. Cracking commentary on the perils of AI and technological dependency, Gromit!\n\nProject Artemis\n\nVanishingly little has been shared yet about Greg Berlanti’s new 1960s space-race-set rom-com for Apple TV. But it’s a 1960s space-race-set rom-com. And it stars Scarlett Johansson, Channing Tatum, Jim Rash, Ray Romano, and Woody Harrelson. And it’s for Apple TV. So we will happily take the 1960s space-race-set rom-com all the same, please and thank you.\n\nWolfs\n\nBrad Pitt and George Clooney are two professional fixers hired for the same job in writer-director Jon Watts’ noodle-twistingly titled new psychological action thriller, set to release on Apple TV this year. Seriously though… Wolfs?! Yes, we suppose there’s a certain sense to pluralising the singular form when relating to two characters ascribed as being ‘lone wolf’ types. But still… Wolfs! Anywho, we’re sure we’ll wolve it down.\n\nMaXXXine\n\nThe sole survivor of a barnhouse bloodbath, aspiring actress Maxine (Mia Goth) is back and headed for the bright lights of '80s LA in the final instalment of Ti West’s X trilogy. Heavily inspired by Giallo cinema and the works of Dario Argento, West has assembled a hell of a cast (Elizabeth Debicki! Lily Collins! Halsey! Giancarlo Esposito! Kevin Bacon!) to complete his series of seriously fucked up (his words, not ours) motion pictures. Consider us very e_XXX_cited.\n\nNosferatu\n\nRobert Eggers is returning to pure horror territory with his take on F.W. Murnau’s classic Gothic chiller. Lily-Rose Depp and Nicholas Hoult play the poor, unfortunate souls who find themselves petrified by the power of eponymous bloodsucker, whilst Bill Skarsgård – no stranger to a terrifying transformation – is the man bringing Count Orlok to life (or, umm, undeath?). Even Eggers himself says his Nosferatu is “a scary film.” And who are we to doubt the man who made us mortally afraid of goats?\n\nThe Toxic Avenger\n\nPeter Dinklage is Winston Gooze – AKA The Toxic Avenger, AKA Toxie – in Blue Ruin star Macon Blair’s rollicking retooling of Troma’s cult superhero scuzzfest. Dinklage stars alongside Kevin Bacon, Elijah Wood, and Jacob Tremblay in the film, a cartoonishly hyperviolent caper aptly described by Blair as packing “Itchy & Scratchy-type violence”. Bloody good stuff – literally!"
