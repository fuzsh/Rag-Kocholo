        "text": "As the new year kicks off – we’re five years past the original Blade Runner’s time period at this point! – Hollywood can settle in (at least in terms of its release date plans). 2023’s double strike, which saw both the actors and writers guilds campaigning for improved deals, scrambled production schedules, leading to a variety of movies (and TV shows) being delayed and/or seeing their planned release timing changed.\n\nSo that means that in 2024 we’re only getting one new MCU movie – Deadpool 3 – though really, Marvel Studios probably needed a bit of a breather anyway. DC also will only see one new movie released in Joker: Folie à Deux, but that’s more to do with the switch to the new James Gunn Universe than because of the strikes. Elsewhere, there’s a host of new titles to be excited about, including the long-awaited arrival of Dune: Part Two, Parasite director Bong Joon-ho's Mickey 17, Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, a mysteriously untitled Universal Monsters movie from the guys who made Ready or Not, a new Planet of the Apes movie, the return of Furiosa (w/o Mad Max!), a new Jordan Peele movie, and much more.\n\nRead on for the 2024 movies we’re most excited about, and don’t forget all release dates are subject to change…\n\nBad Boys 4\n\nUS Date: June 14\n\nThe third film in the Bad Boys series, Bad Boys for Life, was released in 2020, so Bad Boys 4 – which is not the final title of the film – is coming fairly quickly considering the 17-year gap between Bad Boy 2 and Bad Boys 3, and the eight-year gap between the first film and the second. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are of course back again, with Bad Boys for Life and Ms. Marvel directors Adil & Bilall also returning for more fun.\n\nA Quiet Place: Day One\n\nUS Date: June 28\n\nDirector Michael Sarnoski left an impression with 2021's Nic Cage drama Pig, and he’s certainly an interesting choice for this prequel/spin-off to the John Krasinski/Emily Blunt horror series. Lupita Nyong'o, Joseph Quinn (Stranger Things' Eddie Munson!), Alex Wolff and Djimon Hounsou star in the film, which will presumably fill in some of the blanks regarding the nasty aliens from the first two installments (though Part II did already give us a flashback to the start of their invasion).\n\nDespicable Me 4\n\nUS Date: July 3\n\nIt was February of 2022 when Illumination and Universal announced Despicable Me 4’s release date of July 3, 2024, and while not much has been heard about the film since – we don’t even have a trailer – the sixth film in the series (don’t forget the two Minions movies) seems like an inevitability. Reportedly, Steve Carell will be back as former supervillain Gru, joined by Kristen Wiig, Pierre Coffin, Miranda Cosgrove and Steve Coogan.\n\nTwisters\n\nUS Date: July 19\n\nYou wanna see cows getting sucked up by tornadoes on the big screen, right? Of course you do! (And we also all hope that the cows will be just fine afterward.) And hence, Twisters was born – the 28-years-later sequel to the memorable Bill Paxton/Helen Hunt disaster flick Twister. Normal People’s Daisy Edgar-Jones will star in the film, with Lee Isaac Chung, who was Oscar-nominated for 2020’s Minari, directing. Getting an Oscar nom is one thing, but successfully getting a cow to spin in a tornado while your leads make wisecracks? That will take true talent.\n\nDeadpool 3\n\nUS Date: July 26\n\nYep, Marvel Studios has just one movie coming out in 2024, and it’s the third entry in a series that didn’t even used to be part of the MCU! That said, Deadpool doesn’t really play by regular universe rules anyway. And if the leaks from this film’s set are to be believed, that will continue to be the case as all manner of non-MCU Marvel characters could show up here. That includes Hugh Jackman’s Wolverine, who teams with Ryan Reynolds’ Wade Wilson again after their unfortunate meeting in X-Men Origins: Wolverine.\n\nBorderlands\n\nUS Date: Aug. 9\n\nDirector Eli Roth (Hostel, Thanksgiving) brings the space Western game to the big screen with Cate Blanchett starring as Lilith alongside Kevin Hart as Roland, Jamie Lee Curtis as Dr. Tannis, and Jack Black voicing the robot Claptrap. “I didn't want to have to be too slavish [to the game],” Roth told IGN in November. “I didn't just want to film the game. We wanted to tell a great story on its own, but of course it's loaded with Easter eggs for the fans.”\n\nAlien: Romulus\n\nUS Date: Aug. 16\n\nHow many Alien movies does this make now? Not counting the Alien vs. Predator films (why would you?), Alien: Romulus is the seventh installment. (There’s also a TV series currently in the works.) Directed by Fede Álvarez (Evil Dead, Don’t Breathe), Romulus is set between the first movie and the second, which actually gives the filmmaker a wide time period to play with (since – pushes up glasses – Ripley was in cryogenic sleep for 57 years when Aliens opens). Not much else is known about the film at this point, but Cailee Spaeny (Priscilla) will star.\n\nBeetlejuice 2\n\nUS Date: Sept. 6\n\nMichael Keaton already came back as Batman, so why not as Betelgeuse? That he’s teaming with original Beetlejuice (and Batman!) director Tim Burton only makes this sequel sound more intriguing. Wednesday creators Alfred Gough and Miles Millar wrote the script, and the star of that show, Jenna Ortega, will also appear in the film alongside original cast members Winona Ryder and Catherine O’Hara. Willem Dafoe, Monica Bellucci and Justin Theroux will also be hanging with the ghost with the most for Beetlejuice 2, which comes 36 years after the first film.\n\nTransformers One\n\nUS Date: Sept. 13\n\nThe animated Transformers One is an origin story for everyone's favorite robots in disguise that is being directed by Josh Cooley (Toy Story 4). Chris Hemsworth voices a young Optimus Prime opposite a presumably also young Megatron (Brian Tyree Henry) in a story that depicts how the two went from allies to legendary foes destined for toy shelves everywhere. Also starring are Scarlett Johansson (Elita), Keegan-Michael Key (Bumblebee), Jon Hamm (Sentinel Prime) and Laurence Fishburne (Alpha Trion).\n\nSaw XI\n\nUS Date: Sept. 27\n\nThe first Saw movie debuted in 2004 and was such a hit that a sequel came every year after through 2010. There was a seven-year break after that (Jigsaw fatigue, don't you know), but there have been three films since then, including Saw X from September 2023. That movie made about $107 million, and so we’re back on the yearly schedule (for now anyway) with Saw XI coming in September 2024. Will the long-dead Jigsaw return again? Probably!"
