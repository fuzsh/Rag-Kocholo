        "text": "While famous siblings are par for the course in Hollywood (the Jonases, the Gyllenhaals), there's just something special about the Hemsworth brothers. Luke, Chris, and Liam are all talented, buff, and charming, and their super-tight bond just makes this trio even better. In honor of Liam's May Men's Health cover, we decided to put a list together of some fun facts about the famous trio—from their humble career beginnings to the funny stories they've shared about each other in the past.\n\nAll three Hemsworth brothers have starred on the Australian soap Neighbours.\n\nNeighbours started airing in 1985, and it's currently the longest-running drama series in Australian television. Luke first joined the show for a 10-episode arc from 2001-2002, while Chris only appeared on one episode in 2002. Liam spent the most time on the show, and his role as paraplegic athlete Josh Taylor lasted for 25 episodes between 2007-2008. And in a cool twist, one of Liam's episodes also featured an appearance by Margot Robbie.\n\nLiam and Chris both auditioned for the lead role in Thor.\n\nThe MCU's Norse god could have looked very different, as a then 21-year-old Liam once auditioned for the role in 2011. And while the role ultimately went to Chris, the older Hemsworth revealed that Liam got a callback before he did.\n\n\"I came into the audition with Kenneth Branagh and thought I nailed it and then never heard anything back,\" Chris told W Magazine. \"Months went by and then my brother, my little brother, Liam, was in Australia and sent a tape across and he got a call back, then another call back and then was down to the last kind of four or five people for it.\"\n\nLuke made an appearance in Thor: Ragnarok.\n\nIn 2017, the oldest Hemsworth brother portrayed a fictional version of Thor in Ragnarok in a very funny theater scene that also featured Matt Damon.\n\nBut there have been rumors that Liam could also join Chris in the MCU.\n\nThe movie and video game website We Got This Covered recently reported that Liam could be playing Beta Ray Bill in the upcoming movie Thor: Love and Thunder. In the comics, Beta Ray and Thor once had a short but intense battle, and Beta Ray was able to lift Mjolnir, Thor's hammer. Liam also told us that the two would love to star in a action-comedy movie together.\n\nThe brothers had a funny childhood...\n\nIn 2012, Luke made an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel, and he detailed what it was like growing up on Phillip Island, a small island southeast of Melbourne.\n\n\"Yeah, the Hemsworth House of Horrors,\" Luke jokingly said. \"We'd wake up in the morning and literally say 'See ya, mum,' and just disappear into the bush. And I think as we got older, parents of kids we knew would gradually drop their kids off further and further away from our house.\" He also talked about how the trio would ride around on motorbikes at the age of 12—with no helmets.\n\n...but they were also a handful.\n\nDuring an appearance on Conan, Liam revealed that he once threw a throwing knife at Chris. Luckily, the handle of the knife hit the middle Hemsworth instead of the blade, but Liam hilariously claimed that he didn't mean for Chris to get hurt at all: \"It was just like a warning. Like if you mess with me, I'll throw a knife at your head.\" He also said that their mom once broke her finger while trying to break up one of their fist fights.\n\nAnd their kids are carrying on the tradition.\n\nLuke has three daughters and Chris has two sons and a daughter, and in 2016, Liam joked to Jimmy Kimmel that he was such a great uncle that he would \"just let them do whatever they want—candy, loads of candy, have candy. Beer, if you want one, I'll give you a beer.\" He also detailed getting his nails and face painted by his nieces.\n\nLiam once moved next door to Chris.\n\nAfter Liam's divorce from Miley Cyrus, he spent some time with Chris in their native Australia, and they spent their time relaxing on the beach in Byron Bay. He also told us that the duo did some self-care where they would \"do a cycle from the sauna to the ice bath.\" Reportedly, Liam later bought a house close to where Chris lives with wife Elsa Pataky and their three kids. Prior to the Malibu wildfires, Liam had lived about a five-minute drive away from Luke.\n\nWho's the funniest Hemsworth brother? Luke says it's him.\n\nLuke played a round of \"Who's Most Likely To\" with Young Hollywood, and he dubbed himself the funniest. When asked which brother would be the most likely to try another job besides acting, Luke revealed that Chris only lasted a week at his flooring business, while Liam only managed to hang on for a day or two.\n\nBut ultimately, their bond is unbreakable.\n\nOn Chris' birthday last year, Luke posted a photo of his younger brother on Instagram with a moving caption: \"You’re a constant inspiration and beacon of joy. Miss you on the other side of the world so I’ll raise glass and toast the legend that continues to grow.\"\n\nLiam also told us that he looks up to Chris: \"I've worked with a lot of people that have been in really great positions in the past 11 years, and Chris has a stronger work ethic than most. He’s so focused. I’m thankful that I have him and am able to use his resources and his knowledge. I call him all the time about scripts and get his opinion.\""
