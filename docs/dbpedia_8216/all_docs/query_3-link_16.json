        "text": "It’s no surprise that the world is captivated by the Hemsworth brothers. Chris, Liam, and Luke — a trifecta of talent and charisma, have left an indelible mark on the silver screen.\n\nThe Aussie siblings have carved out their own unique paths in the entertainment industry, captivating audiences with their magnetic presence and diverse range of performances.\n\nFrom wielding superhero hammers to capturing hearts with their adventurous spirit, the Hemsworths collectively showcase a rare blend of individual prowess and shared familial bonds that have solidified their place as Hollywood’s cherished and formidable trio.\n\nNot only are the trio excellent actors, but their close family ties have delighted fans in recent years as the family regularly updates the world on shared birthday celebrations, family holidays and red-carpet events together.\n\nMost recently, the brothers reunited on the red carpet to celebrate the premiere of Chris’ new movie Furiosa. The outing comes a few months after the trio shared pictures of their “epic” family vacation, which saw Liam, Luke, Chris, their partners and their parents enjoy a trip to the United Arab Emirates.\n\n“A few snaps from an epic family trip to #abudhabi,” Chris captioned his Instagram post, to which Luke responded in the comments, “What a time was had!”\n\nFamily holidays aside, if you’re anything like us you’re probably obsessed with the Hemsworth brothers – and you’ll be happy to find that we put together everything there is to know about Luke, Chris, and Liam Hemsworth.\n\nWe’ve also rounded up some lesser-known facts about the three. Like did you know that Chris Hemsworth’s secret talent is sewing? Or that Liam’s mother taught his high school sex education class? Or that there’s actually a third Hemsworth brother?\n\nThe Hemsworths, Before They Got Famous\n\nLuke, Chris, and Liam Hemsworth were all born in Melbourne, Australia to Leonie Hemsworth and Craig Hemsworth. The brothers grew up in Melbourne but also spent some time in the Australian Outback as young boys. Their family lived on Phillip Island as well, where all three brothers spent a lot of time surfing.\n\n“I learned to surf when I was a kid at Phillip Island and spent more hours in the water there than out,” Chris told USA Today.\n\nWhen they were kids, there was some serious sibling rivalry between Liam and Chris. On the Graham Norton Show, Liam shared that their rivalry was like “the Hunger Games”. Being the baby of the family, Liam would often be the butt of (mostly Chris’) jokes and pranks, including getting wrapped up in layers of clothing only to be chased around with a BB gun. Liam would get his revenge eventually by throwing a knife straight at Chris’s head!\n\nLuke was actually the first Hemsworth brother to go into acting, with Liam and Chris following in his footsteps later on. Though it took some time (and even moments of doubt for all three), each of the boys has gone on their own unique paths to make it big in Hollywood.\n\nWho Is Liam Hemsworth?\n\nName: Liam Hemsworth\n\nAge: 34 (Liam was born on January 13, 1990)\n\nHow Tall Is He: 1.91 meters\n\nRelationship And Family: Liam was married to Miley Cyrus for seven months before announcing their divorce in 2020, he is currently dating Gabriella Brooks.\n\nHis Biggest Roles: Gale in The Hunger Games\n\nWhere He Lives Now: Los Angeles, California\n\nActing Career\n\nBaby bro Liam first appeared in the Australian soap Neighbours, which big bro Luke had previously starred in.\n\nHe did several small films – like the British horror film Triangle and the science-fiction film Knowing – before getting the lead role in the film adaptation of Nicholas Sparks’s The Last Song. It was working on this film where he met his best friend-turned-girlfriend-turned-ex-turned-wife-turned-ex again Miley Cyrus.\n\nIn 2011, Liam landed his biggest role as Gale in the The Hunger Games franchise. He’s also been in several other films since then – he starred opposite Kate Winslet in The Dressmaker and was cast as the ultimate fantasy boyfriend in the rom-com parody Isn’t It Romantic?\n\nIt has recently been announced that he will replace Henry Cavill in The Witcher.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nLiam Hemsworth was vegan for a number of years, making the lifestyle switch in 2015. His biggest inspiration was Hunger Games co-star Woody Harrelson, however a painful experience with kidney stones in 2019 saw the actor return to meat and dairy products.\n\nWho Is Chris Hemsworth?\n\nName: Christopher Hemsworth\n\nAge: 40 (Chris was born on August 11, 1983)\n\nHow Tall Is He: 1.9 meters\n\nRelationship And Family: Chris is happily married to Spanish actress Elsa Pataky. The couple has three children – daughter India and twins Tristan and Sasha.\n\nHis Biggest Roles: Thor in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (Thor, Avengers: Endgame and more) and Kim in Home and Away.\n\nWhere He Lives Now: Chris has been splitting his time between Los Angeles, Sydney and Byron Bay, New South Wales.\n\nActing Career\n\nChris’ first major role was playing surfer Kim Hyde in the Aussie soap Home and Away. He was on the show for three years, then in 2006, he became a contestant on Dancing With the Stars. Yes, that’s right, Thor, the God of Thunder once spent weeks ballroom dancing on TV! Chris even attributes his stint on the show for helping him become “nimble on his feet”.\n\nChris then did small roles in popular and critically acclaimed Hollywood films. Did you know he played Captain Kirk’s father in J.J. Abrams’ Star Trek? Or that he played the typical airhead jock in horror flick Cabin in the Woods? It seems like the Hemsworth brothers have a flair for horror!\n\nIn 2011, Chris was cast as Thor.
