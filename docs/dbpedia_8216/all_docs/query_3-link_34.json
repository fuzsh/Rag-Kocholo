        "text": "Chris Hemsworth rides up on a horse, reins in one hand, face shining in the Australian sun. We’re on a pristine stretch of beach near his house. Our last gallop took me by surprise, my feet flapping wildly out of their stirrups, and Hemsworth wants to make sure I feel safe. He tells me to steer my horse into the Pacific if I don’t know how else to stop. This gallant little scene captures the fantasy of Hemsworth: pop culture’s sunny, reliable hero. But the best stuff about him as a person—the funny, messy, human stuff—lives beneath the glossy surface. Later, he’ll say of our rollicking morning on the beach, “I had a moment of, Oh, I can catch her if she falls off. That’ll be good for the story. And my next thought was, No, you’ll fall over before she will, and she’ll have to catch you.”\n\nHemsworth and his family live in Byron Bay, a surf town just south of Australia’s Gold Coast where men walk barefoot into nice restaurants and all the women have long, sun-streaked hair and not even the old people look old. Everyone is fit and beautiful and drinks green juice, and maybe it would all be alienating if people weren’t also so warm and kind. When I tell my hotel receptionist that I’m in town to meet Hemsworth, she smiles approvingly. “He’s one of us,” she says. “Just like any of the other surfers down at the beach. Doesn’t carry on or put on airs. Looks like my mate’s brother, you know?”\n\nI meet Hemsworth at his house, where he waits for me in the driveway, his bare feet immune to the hot pavement. He’s got the whole afternoon to talk until he has to leave to pick up his three kids from school. In person, the most striking thing about the actor isn’t his impressive height, or his surfer’s tan, or even his Popsicle-blue eyes that electrically charged the Marvel universe for more than a decade. It’s his lack of slickness. There’s nothing oily or impatient or rehearsed about the man. Saturday Night Live star Cecily Strong once called Hemsworth her favorite host because nobody had expected Thor to be “the cool jock that just wants to hang out with the gay theater kids.”\n\nHis home is so full of life. He and his wife of 14 years, the Spanish actor Elsa Pataky, are parents to an 11-year-old girl and twin 9-year-old boys. The family also has an enormous fish tank, three dogs, rabbits, guinea pigs, chickens, and donkeys, as well as the horses they keep at their nearby farm. What used to be an art room for the kids now has a paper with “REPTIEL” written in Magic Marker bubble letters taped to the door for the lizard, axolotl, and snake named Shoelace. Hemsworth’s daughter, India, keeps birds in her bedroom’s large, enclosed balcony, one of whom likes to sit on her shoulder out on the sofa. Also wandering around the property is a cat, which his family surprised him with. Hemsworth isn’t a cat guy, but he even less wants to be the guy who makes his kids return a creature once they’ve fallen in love.\n\nThe family moved to Byron Bay in 2015 to be close to his parents, who live just up the hill, but also to escape the head trip of Hollywood, which Hemsworth summarizes as follows: “I’m sick of my face. Why isn’t it on a billboard? I’m too famous. Why are there paparazzi here? Wait, why aren’t there any paparazzi here?” He pauses. “Well, which do you want, Chris?” He’s prone to that toxic seesawing of anxiety and reproach, and it makes him so tired. Of himself, mostly.\n\nFirework content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nThis may be the most surprising thing about Hemsworth: For all his hunky appeal, he’s also deeply reflective, ambivalent, and complicated. We talk for hours out on his pool deck, overlooking the beach, two of his dogs asleep at our feet. He picks at the calluses on his hands like worry beads, ruminating over his answers with care. At 40, he feels like he’s at a crossroads, unsure of how to best navigate life, and—careers being like horses—what, if anything, is in his control.\n\nThis month, Hemsworth stars in George Miller’s Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga, the hotly anticipated prequel to 2015’s Oscar-winning box office smash Fury Road set in the same blighted wasteland. Alongside Anya Taylor-Joy’s titular character, Hemsworth plays Dementus, the charismatic leader of a biker horde. He disappears so completely into the role—which intentionally blunts the Marvel of him with a prosthetic Apolline nose and brown contact lenses—that his own friends didn’t recognize him in the trailer. Hemsworth’s Dementus, however full of cheeky verve, has been ruined by deprivation and loss; he is a man with ash for a soul who now worships only the god of survival. Tellingly, it is the actor’s favorite role since he starred in Ron Howard’s 2013 race car drama, Rush. “Ron took me out of that typecast space of the muscly action guy and let me play a character with complications and darkness,” he says. “I remember thinking at the time, Oh, this is going to change everything.” It took a decade, and working with Miller, to feel fed as deeply. “Yeah,” says Hemsworth, “it’s been a long wait.”\n\nAfter a year at home catching his breath and nursing a back injury, Hemsworth wants off the bench. “The one side of my brain tells me, Oh, you took too much time off and now the train’s passed you by,” he says. “The more rational mind is like, You’ve turned down a lot of stuff too—big action films where there wasn’t a solid script.” But he also wants stillness. He wants work outside the action lane and to be taken seriously by directors like Christopher Nolan, Kathryn Bigelow, Greta Gerwig, Martin Scorsese, and Steven Spielberg. But he also thinks he owes the audience another Thor after what felt like a whiff with Thor: Love and Thunder. He wants to let himself take his craft more seriously. But he doesn’t want to be “an overly self-important, pretentious wanker.” And he wants it known, once and for all, that he doesn’t have Alzheimer’s, nor has he quit the business.\n\nTwo years ago, as part of the National Geographic docuseries Limitless, Hemsworth underwent genetic testing that revealed he carried two copies of the APOE4 gene. The startling news—which is not a diagnosis but a marker of risk that one of my daughters happens to share—coincided with planned time off, and some headlines conflated the two incorrectly. “It really kind of pissed me off because it felt like I had been vulnerable with something personal and shared this,” he says. “No matter how much I said ‘This is not a death sentence,’ the story became that I have dementia and I’m reconsidering life and retiring and so on.” His face relaxes into a smile, because that’s how he was raised, in a family acutely aware of life’s fragility, so best not to take any of it too seriously. “I did read a really funny comment at the bottom of one article: ‘I hope Chris forgets he’s retiring and comes back.’”\n\nWhen Leonie Hemsworth’s 23-year-old son moved to Los Angeles in 2007, she gave him a copy of Dr. Seuss’s Oh, the Places You’ll Go! “Pack your bags, off you go,” she told him. “If it doesn’t work out, the couch will always be here.”\n\nChris crawled at four and a half months, took his first steps at 10 and a half months, and insisted he could swim when he was just two and a half years old. “He scared a lot of people because he looked like he was drowning,” she said in a toast at Hemsworth’s 40th birthday party not long ago, the text of which she shared with me. “He had a weird otter kind of swim where he’d come up for air in between bouts of drowning, but he wouldn’t let anyone help him. He had to do it on his own.” Hemsworth’s superpower, though it may have looked like a curse from the shoreline, was tenacity.\n\nWhen they weren’t outside catching giant lace monitor lizards or paddling out for waves, the three Hemsworth boys—older brother Luke and Hunger Games star Liam—grew up watching movies like Legends of the Fall on a loop. “There’s never been a more beautiful man onscreen,” Hemsworth says of Brad Pitt’s tortured rancher, Tristan Ludlow. He rewatched the movie with his wife when she was pregnant with the twins. “Is this not the coolest character in the world?” he said to her. “I think one of our kids needs to be named Tristan.” (Their other son, Sasha, is named after a stuntman friend.)\n\nHemsworth wanted to be an actor because he wanted to be like Pitt in Legends, Patrick Swayze in Point Break, or Robert De Niro in Heat. His brother Luke had found work on a TV show, and that seemed like fun. “Then it just became a complete obsession,” he says. Before coming to America, he spent three years on an Australian soap, playing a hunk. “I always felt like, Oh, I’m just being kind of put over here in the corner: ‘Yeah, just take your shirt off and go over there, and now you’re working at the gym and now you’re working at the bar.’”\n\nGrateful as he was for the opportunity, Hemsworth grew frustrated playing the great Asgardian defender. “Sometimes I felt like a security guard for the team,” he says. “I would read everyone else’s lines, and go, Oh, they got way cooler stuff. They’re having more fun. What’s my character doing? It was always about, ‘You’ve got the wig on. You’ve got the muscles. You’ve got the costume. Where’s the lighting?’ Yeah, I’m part of this big thing, but I’m probably pretty replaceable.”\n\nHis friend and costar Robert Downey Jr. won’t hear of such talk. “First off, Thor as a character was super tricky to adapt—lots of implied limitations—but he and Ken Branagh figured out how to transcend, make him somehow relatable but godlike,” he says. “Hemsworth is, in my opinion, the most complex psyche out of all us Avengers. He’s got wit and gravitas, but also such restraint, fire, and gentleness.”\n\nWhen Taika Waititi came aboard to direct 2017’s Thor: Ragnarok, he was as eager to tweak the Thor character as its megastar. They decided to have some fun with tone, letting Hemsworth dig into his natural comedic gifts, with the character wonderfully reduced to a god with a dad bod, wallowing and brokenhearted. Fellow Aussie Cate Blanchett, his Ragnarok costar, loved him immediately. “I first met Chris on the lot—he was driving a golf cart, his Thor locks flying—careening towards me with a huge grin of welcome,” she says. “I had heard he was generous, and boy is he generous, hilarious, and as hardworking and diligent as he is handsome, but I had no idea what a goofball he is. He is a complete goofball. He sets the tone on set—everyone is valued. Everyone is welcome. I adore and admire him deeply.”\n\nDowney calls Hemsworth’s work in Ragnarok, Infinity War, and Endgame “a formidable hat trick.” But then came Love and Thunder, for which Hemsworth still can’t forgive himself. “I got caught up in the improv and the wackiness, and I became a parody of myself,” he says. “I didn’t stick the landing.”\n\nTwenty-seven movies—eight of them Marvel blockbusters—in just over a dozen years. Hemsworth’s back was blown, his monkey brain in overdrive. He was too anxious to turn down big roles when they were offered, not wired to trust that he’d ever be offered a great drama, sweeping love story, or romantic comedy. (“Remember Hugh Grant in Notting Hill?” he asks. “I haven’t seen a movie like that in years.”) “I’d been trying to muscle and beat things into existence for so long, out of obsession and desperation to build this career, and I was just exhausted,” he says, looking out on the waves he’ll seek comfort on later, surfing being the best salve for his ping-ponging mind. “I was worried about everything,” he says. “Nothing was as enjoyable as it once was, or I had imagined it was. I was making back-to-back movies and doing the press tours, and I was married and had three young kids, and it was all happening at the same time in a very short window.” He rests his bare foot on his dog Sunny’s belly. “You’re sort of just running on fumes, and then you’re showing up to something with little in the tank and you start to pick things apart: Why am I doing this film? Why isn’t this script better? Why didn’t that director call me for that or why didn’t I get considered for this role? Why don’t I get the call-up from Scorsese or Tarantino? I had begun to take it all too serious and too personal.”\n\nHemsworth’s family knows the way his thinking can torture him. “His mind is a crystal, but it can also be a prison,” says Luke, who had a hilarious turn as Thor alongside Matt Damon’s Loki in a play set within Ragnarok. “He can be so focused and self-critical. He has real anxiety about making a decision. And he can spiral, there’s no doubt about that.” Luke laughs when I tell him that Hemsworth gave me his well-worn copy of Michael Alan Singer’s self-help book The Untethered Soul, and he can’t resist throwing in a playful, brotherly jab: “I dunno whether he’s ever read it or just looked at the pictures.”\n\nHemsworth found himself trapped in the tunnel of self. “My mum would come over for a cup of coffee and she would have to snap her fingers, and go, ‘Chris, where are ya? Come on, I’m here.’ The chatter in my head got so intense—and then the sense of guilt that every time I’d leave a dinner with parents or a friend, I’d say, ‘God, I wasn’t even there. I just spent the time bitching or complaining.’ There’s a narcissism to it. How many more years are we going to have this conversation? Like, just shut up, Chris.”\n\nLuke is good at knocking his brother out of his head. “There are a few mottos I like to remind him of,” he says. “One is, whenever we’re at these premieres—or doing these press tours where you’re in hotels having martinis in world-famous piano bars—I look at him and say, ‘Oi, how good is this?!’ Just as a reminder that he should enjoy this more than anyone else. We grew up with working-class parents, and we all worked from a very young age, so to have that freedom and the ability to go and see all these beautiful places is extraordinary. The other one I like to remind him of is, When the bad times outweigh the good, it’s time to do something different.”\n\nIn 2015, Hemsworth saw Fury Road in the theater with his wife in London, where he was shooting an Avengers movie. He was thunderstruck. “I came out of it and called my agent,” he says. “I haven’t been able to completely immerse myself in a film as a fan for years because I’ve seen behind the curtain and the magic is gone. This is the first film in years where I felt 100 percent involved in the experience as a true fan.” He asked his agent to get him a meeting with George Miller.\n\nSix months later, Miller met with Hemsworth in Sydney as a courtesy. He already had several actors in mind for Furiosa. “Oh God, my mind was completely somewhere else in terms of who might play Dementus,” says Miller. But they talked for hours—about psychology and philosophy and the personality disorders that make a villain not just dangerous but intriguing. “What surprised me was the depth of his insight about work, the world at large, himself, and it came effortlessly out of the conversation,” says Miller. “I had this sense that there was a way more complex, considered person than I’d ever imagined meeting.” The job was his, though they each had other movies to shoot first.\n\nHemsworth practically limped off Extraction 2, the Netflix juggernaut about a sad mercenary fighting very bad guys. Miller was already nervous the actor wouldn’t get off in time for the eight-week rehearsal period. Hemsworth had hoped to sneak in surgery on his back and lie about it without telling anyone but ran out of time. His trainer, his best friend since they were six, asked him how he was going to power through. “I said, ‘Look, I don’t have a choice,’” says Hemsworth. “And as soon as I got to rehearsals, everything lifted. I just got reinvigorated. Suffering without a purpose is awful. Suffering with purpose can be rejuvenating and replenishing. I’d grown so tired of myself, and now I had to lose myself in a character.”\n\nMiller encouraged his actor to read books like Frank Dikötter’s How to Be a Dictator and to write journals as Dementus. “I had never done that before,” Hemsworth says of the process. “I had always thought I didn’t need it, rolled my eyes in the past. Too self-serious. But I think by having that attitude, I kind of missed an opportunity to do a deeper dive into character development.” For Furiosa, he worked on modulating his voice into a mid-20th-century accent, his grandfather’s generation, that Miller adored. Together, they dug into Dementus’s nasty human core. “It was really, really weird turning up on set for several months getting used to Dementus,” says Miller. “When I saw Chris many months later, my first instinct was, Wait a minute, this is not Chris Hemsworth. This is a fraud!”\n\nFury Road, however perfect a film, was a famously embattled production—riddled with relocations, weather delays, and a feud between Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy. Miller says Furiosa was the opposite, thanks in large part to Hemsworth’s steadying hand. “Whenever there was a weather problem, he was on set,” he says. “He brought the whole cast around him.” Miller cast several former inmates, who’d joined a theater group while in prison, as members of Dementus’s horde. “It was a wonderfully eclectic group of personalities, and I became really close with my little gang,” says Hemsworth, who invited the whole lot of them to spend the weekend at his house in Byron Bay during filming.\n\nAnd, God, Hemsworth would love to do a movie with Pitt. After two decades in the business, Hemsworth did finally meet his screen idol, at the Once Upon a Time…in Hollywood premiere’s after-party. “I was kind of hiding in the corner,” he says. “My agent came by and said, ‘Did you meet Brad yet?’ I said, ‘Oh, he doesn’t want to meet me,’ and my agent said, ‘No, he does, come and say hello!’ When Brad went to shake my hand, somehow in my eagerness I’d already gone in for a hug.” He pauses with a wincing laugh. “Which thankfully was accepted, and we had a chuckle about. We talked a lot about motorbikes, because my dad used to race.”\n\nWomen get asked all the time how they feel about turning 40 in Hollywood, so I ask Hemsworth how he feels about it. “I think for the first time in my career I’ve started thinking, Shit, how many years do I have left that I can do this? I went through a sort of list of films with my production partner yesterday, a bit of a wish list, and then I was like, ‘Well, that’s six films. That could be the next decade. That could be it. Who knows where I am at that point?’”\n\nRecently, several Avengers gathered in the name of love at Chris Evans’s wedding in Boston. Hemsworth brought his mother as his date, whom Downey calls “a complete hoot. There’s a lot of her in him.” Hemsworth hadn’t seen Jeremy Renner since the freak snowplow accident that hit the Avengers text chain like a bullet. “He sent us all a sort of a doped out, hospital, beat-up image and said, ‘All good, guys.’ And then I didn’t hear from him for a while as he was in the thick of it.” At the wedding, the gang rallied around their risen friend. “If there’s one characteristic we’d all agree is paramount,” Downey says of their crew, “it’s resilience. To see Renner embody that literally, and in the context of what was basically a Portuguese American wedding, was mind-blowing. Fully recovered and ready to celebrate. So, yes—miracles happen.”\n\n“There was an astounding sense of gratitude from him around just being alive,” agrees Hemsworth. He’s holding tightly onto that, especially now.\n\nHemsworth’s hero is his father, whom he describes as a lion of a man. His father was his date to the premiere of his first movie, Star Trek, in 2009: “I only had three or four lines. At the end, he just reached over and gave me a big kiss on the head and a cuddle, and he told me many times how proud he was of me. Certainly, in my times of doubt, I see both him and my mum, and I go, Okay, I must be on the right track.”\n\nCraig Hemsworth spent his career as a social worker with the department of human services, specializing in cases of childhood violence and neglect. “I saw the toll that took on him,” says Hemsworth. “He’d have to present evidence of whether or not this was a safe environment for this kid to be in, and if it isn’t, well, then imagine the ripple effects for that child and those parents and that family. Whether he prevented something bad from happening in one case, there was always another one.” Hemsworth seems surprised by a bog of tears in his throat as he relates all this, and he pauses until it passes. “I hope that sums up what an incredible person he is. He is the most generous person you’ll ever meet, there for anyone.…” He clears his throat and gives himself another moment.\n\nWhen Hemsworth was little, he remembers going to the neighborhood park with his father and happening upon some rowdy-looking teenagers smashing bottles on the playground. His father walked over and told them to clean up their mess. Hemsworth watched with mounting anxiety as the boys refused. “I just remember Dad very firmly saying, ‘My son got six stitches in his foot last week because he cut his foot here on a broken bottle. Don’t cross me on this one, guys. Get to work.’ And they did. They picked up the glass! And I remember knowing that’s who you have to be, but lacking the confidence in myself—trying to stand up to people and just being scared out of my mind and being really upset because my dad wouldn’t be afraid, you know? He never put that on me, ever, but having that role model was both an inspiration and intimidating, you know?”"
