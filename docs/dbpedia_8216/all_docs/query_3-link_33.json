        "text": "Chris Hemsworth is one of three hunky Hemsworth brothers. As the middle child, he grew up in Australia with older brother Luke and younger brother Liam. All three grew up to be successful actors in Hollywood, but Chris arguably has the most iconic roles. Born on August 11, 1983, in Australia’s coastal capital of Melbourne, Chris started his acting career by appearing in several television series.\n\nEarly Beginnings\n\nIn 2002, Hemsworth starred in two episodes of the children’s television series Guinevere Jones as King Arthur at 19 years old. He also made an appearance in the Australian soap opera series Neighbours. The following year, he appeared in an episode of another popular Australian children’s show, The Saddle Club. In 2004, Hemsworth auditioned for the role of Robbie Hunter in the Australian soap opera Home and Away. He didn’t land the role but was subsequently cast for the part of Kim Hyde. He moved to Sydney to join the cast, appearing in 171 episodes of the series until 2007.\n\nChris was also a contestant on the fifth season of Dancing with the Stars Australia. After six weeks, Hemsworth was eliminated. In 2009, Hemsworth landed the role of James T. Kirk’s father, George Kirk, in the opening scenes of J. J. Abrams’ Star Trek. That same year, he starred as Kale Garrity in the thriller A Perfect Getaway. Hemsworth went on to play his first film in the United States, 2010’s Ca$h, alongside Sean Bean.\n\nThor and Beyond\n\nIn 2011, Hemsworth landed the biggest role of his career in the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Thor. He reprised the role as the God of Thunder the following year for the 2012 The Avengers. He would reprise the role for three Thor sequels, as well as appearing in three more Avengers movies. Hemsworth expanded his film range, starring in the horror movie The Cabin in the Woods, the Ghostbusters reboot, and the Extraction film series.\n\nTake a look below at photos of Chris Hemsworth through the years."
