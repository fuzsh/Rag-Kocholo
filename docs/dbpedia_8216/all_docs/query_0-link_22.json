        "text": "01 of 19\n\nLindsay Lohan as Cady Heron\n\nCady Heron is the new girl from Africa at North Shore High School who breaks bad before going good again. In real life, Lindsay Lohan has had her own career and personal ups and downs with legal and substance abuse issues, but Mean Girls was what initially launched Lohan into mega-fame.\n\nAfter Mean Girls, Lohan starred in films like Just My Luck (2006), Georgia Rule (2007), I Know Who Killed Me (2007), Machete (2010) and The Canyons (2013). On television, Lohan had recurring roles on Ugly Betty and the British series Sick Note and starred as Elizabeth Taylor in the 2012 Lifetime movie Liz & Dick (2012)\n\nAfter an absence from the screen, Lohan returned in a 2022 Netflix holiday rom-com, Falling for Christmas, followed by another Netflix rom-com, Irish Wish (2023). She is set to reunite with Jamie Lee Curtis for the upcoming sequel of Disney's 2003 flick Freaky Friday.\n\nIn 2022, Lohan married financier Bader Shammas. In March 2023, Lohan revealed that they were expecting their first baby; son Luai arrived that July.\n\n02 of 19\n\nRachel McAdams as Regina George\n\nRegina George is the most popular, most terrifying girl in school; a half a virgin who wears pink on Wednesdays. It was a breakthrough role for Rachel McAdams, who actually turned 25 during the filming of Mean Girls despite playing a high school student.\n\nAfter Mean Girls, McAdams' career exploded. She starred in everything from The Notebook (2004) and Wedding Crashers (2005) to Midnight in Paris (2011) to Spotlight (2015), the latter for which she earned an Oscar nomination for Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role. McAdams also starred in a lead role on the second season of HBO's True Detective.\n\nIn 2022, McAdams reprised her role as Dr. Christine Palmer in the Marvel Cinematic Universe sequel Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. She also starred in the film adaptation of Judy Blume's Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret (2023), and made her Broadway debut in the play Mary Jane in April 2024.\n\nMcAdams has two children with screenwriter Jamie Linden.\n\n03 of 19\n\nAmanda Seyfried as Karen Smith\n\nAs Karen Smith — she's a mouse (duh) and has ESPN or something — Amanda Seyfried made a hilarious impression in her big-screen debut as the Plastics' resident airhead.\n\nThe role paid off for Seyfried, who followed Mean Girls with a long run on Big Love, leading roles in the Mamma Mia! movies and landing the part of Cosette in Tom Hooper's film adaptation of Les Misérables (2012). Seyfried received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress for playing Golden Age of Hollywood actress Marion Davies in Mank (2020). In September 2022, she won an Emmy for her portrayal of Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes in The Dropout. The esteemed actress is also a Lancôme Ambassadress.\n\nSeyfried is mom to a daughter and son with her husband, Thomas Sadoski.\n\n04 of 19\n\nLacey Chabert as Gretchen Wieners\n\nGretchen is probably best known for trying to make \"fetch\" happen. (It's not going to happen.)\n\nBefore Mean Girls, Lacey Chabert already had a career as a child actor, primarily in voice roles in movies like Anastasia (1997) and The Lion King II: Simba's Pride (1998) and on the Nickelodeon series The Wild Thornberrys. She also was a main cast member on Party of Five, playing Claudia Salinger for all six seasons of the series. After Mean Girls, Chabert continued her TV movie and voice-over work along with appearing in a few feature films like Black Christmas (2006) and Ghosts of Girlfriends Past (2009). However, it's clear that Chabert found her true calling when she began starring in Hallmark Channel movies, having appeared in more than 30 for the network.\n\nShe also became a mom; she and her husband, David Nehdar, had daughter Julia in 2016.\n\n05 of 19\n\nTina Fey as Ms. Norbury\n\nMs. Norbury is the empathetic teacher who asks her students to \"stop calling each other sluts and whores.\" Tina Fey not only nailed the role, but she also wrote the screenplay for Mean Girls.\n\nFey has continued to work both in front of and behind the camera. After concluding her groundbreaking run as a cast member and writer of Saturday Night Live in 2006, Fey created and starred on the sitcom 30 Rock. She's kept busy writing, producing and/or acting on shows like Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt and Only Murders in the Building and in films like Baby Mama (2008), Date Night (2010), Whiskey Tango Foxtrot (2016) and Soul (2020). Her critically acclaimed work has garnered Fey many accolades, including nine Emmys, two Golden Globes and seven Writers Guild of America awards. Fey was also the youngest-ever recipient of the prestigious Mark Twain Prize for American Humor.\n\nThe multihyphenate star also helped give Mean Girls a second life when she brought it to Broadway and scored a Tony nomination for outstanding book of a musical for her work (and cast herself as a lead in a hilarious SNL spoof). Fey reprised her role as Ms. Norbury for the 2024 film adaptation of the Mean Girls musical.\n\nFey has been married to composer-producer Jeff Richmond since 2001 and they have two daughters. The couple also works together — in addition to providing original music for television and film projects Fey has worked on, Richmond received a Tony nomination for writing the score for the Mean Girls musical.\n\n06 of 19\n\nAmy Poehler as Mrs. George\n\nMrs. George is remembered for not being like a regular mom, but a cool mom to Regina. And it's no wonder why — though Amy Poehler played McAdams' mom in Mean Girls, she is only seven years older than her.\n\nPoehler remained on SNL through 2010, moving on to NBC's beloved Parks and Recreation afterward and winning a Golden Globe for her performance as Leslie Knope. She appeared in films like Blades of Glory (2007) and Baby Mama and did memorable voice work for Horton Hears a Who! (2008) and Inside Out (2015), the latter of which she will reprise her role of Joy for the 2024 sequel. Poehler won an Emmy Award for hosting SNL and has been nominated more than 20 other times for Emmys in various categories. As if she wasn't busy enough, Poehler also hosted the reality craft competition show Making It with Parks costar Nick Offerman, hosted the reality food competition show Baking It with SNL costars Andy Samberg (season 1) and Maya Rudolph (season 2) and wrote and directed the 2019 Netflix movie Wine Country. Poehler and frequent collaborator Fey went on a live comedy tour in 2023.\n\nPoehler was married to fellow comedian Will Arnett from 2003 to 2016. They have two sons.\n\n07 of 19\n\nAna Gasteyer as Mrs. Heron\n\nMrs. Heron is the supportive, if not oblivious, mom to Cady, played by Fey and Poehler's fellow SNL castmate Ana Gasteyer.\n\nAfter Mean Girls, Gasteyer had a few movie roles, including in That's My Boy (2012), Wine Country (2019) and Happiest Season (2020), though she has been much busier on television. Gasteyer had recurring roles on The Good Wife, The Goldbergs and Lady Dynamite and was a regular on Suburgatory. From 2021 to 2023, she starred in the lead role on the NBC sitcom American Auto. A talented musical theater actor, Gasteyer has also played Elphaba in the Chicago and Broadway productions of Wicked.\n\nGasteyer and her husband, Charlie McKittrick, have two children: daughter Frances Mary and son Ulysses.\n\n08 of 19\n\nTim Meadows as Mr. Duvall\n\nYet another SNL veteran in the Mean Girls cast, Tim Meadows played Mr. Duvall, who mispronounces \"Cady\" as \"Caddy\" and tells Coach Carr to step away from the underage girls.\n\nMeadows has kept busy since Mean Girls with films like The Benchwarmers (2006), Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story (2007), Semi-Pro (2008) and Trainwreck (2015). He also regularly appears in Adam Sandler's projects, including Grown Ups (2010) and Hubie Halloween (2020). On TV, Meadows has credits for dozens of series such as Bob's Burgers, Marry Me and The Goldbergs (and its short-lived spinoff, Schooled). Notably, Meadows was the only original Mean Girls cast member to appear in the 2011 ABC Family sequel, Mean Girls 2, reprising his role as Mr. Duvall. He also appears in the 2024 movie musical as the same character.\n\nMeadows has two sons with his former wife, Michelle Taylor.\n\n09 of 19\n\nDaniel Franzese as Damian\n\nDamian is memorably accused of being \"too gay to function\" (but it's only okay when Janis says that). It should also be noted he makes an excellent Santa Claus and is the originator of \"Four for you, Glen Coco! You go, Glen Coco!\"\n\nDaniel Franzese went on to star on the TV series Looking, Recovery Road and Conviction. He has also appeared on RuPaul's Secret Celebrity Drag Race and the reality series Not So Straight in Silver Lake.\n\nFranzese split from his fiancé, Joseph Bradley Phillips, in 2018.\n\n10 of 19\n\nLizzy Caplan as Janis Ian\n\nJanis was Regina George's best friend up until eighth grade when Regina started spreading rumors that Janis was a lesbian. She is also the original choreographer for the \"Jingle Bell Rock\" performance, and her legacy lived on through numerous Winter Talent Shows.\n\nSince Mean Girls, Lizzy Caplan is known for films like Cloverfield (2008), Hot Tub Time Machine (2010) and Now You See Me 2 (2016). Her most prominent television roles were as Casey Klein on Party Down, Virginia Johnson on Masters of Sex and Libby Epstein in Fleishman Is in Trouble — though she has also appeared on shows like True Blood, New Girl, The League, Castle Rock and Truth Be Told. She starred as Alex Forrest opposite Joshua Jackson's Dan Gallagher in the 2023 Paramount+ miniseries adaptation of Fatal Attraction.\n\nCaplan married actor Tom Riley in 2017. They have a son, Alfie, who was born in 2021.\n\n11 of 19\n\nJonathan Bennett as Aaron Samuels\n\nAaron Samuels is Regina George's man candy, who looks sexy with his hair pushed back.\n\nBefore Mean Girls, Jonathan Bennett had recurring roles on shows like All My Children and Veronica Mars. His films since have included Cheaper by the Dozen 2 (2005) and Van Wilder: Freshman Year (2009). Bennett also made it to week 6 on Dancing with the Stars season 19 and appeared on season 2 of Celebrity Big Brother. He was among Mean Girls' original stars who appeared in the epic tribute scene to the movie in the 2018 Ariana Grande music video for \"thank u, next.\" If that wasn't enough already, Bennett has made himself a side career as a host of shows like Cupcake Wars and Halloween Wars. In 2022, Bennett made history as one of the stars of the Hallmark Channel's first Christmas movie with a leading LGBTQ couple, The Holiday Sitter. Off-screen, he made his Broadway debut in January 2024 playing Sir Robin and other characters in the musical Spamalot.\n\nIn 2022, he wed his longtime love, Jaymes Vaughan.\n\n12 of 19\n\nJill Morrison as Crying Girl\n\nThe unnamed crying girl is very upset that her classmates can't just get along like they used to in middle school and wishes she could bake a cake made out of rainbows and smiles and we'd all eat and be happy.\n\nMean Girls was Jill Morrison's first of more than 100 acting credits, which also includes the films 2012 (2009) and Big Eyes (2014) and TV series like iZombie, Project Blue Book, Supergirl and The Good Doctor. Morrison also regularly appears in the Hallmark Channel's movie series Signed, Sealed, Delivered.\n\n13 of 19\n\nDaniel DeSanto as Jason\n\nJason is a member of the varsity jock clique who attends a party at Regina's house with Gretchen Weiners, but then goes to the mall with Taylor Wedell. He also asks Cady Heron if her muffin is buttered, and ends up being told to shave his back. You know, typical high school things.\n\nAfter Mean Girls, Daniel DeSanto made his biggest splash in animation and has had notable voice roles on The Magic School Bus, Arthur, the Beyblade series, Totally Spies and PAW Patrol. DeSanto has also appeared on TV series like Schitt's Creek, Star Trek: Discovery and Titans and films like The Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day (2009) and Little Italy (2018).\n\n14 of 19\n\nStefanie Drummond as Bethany Byrd\n\nBethany is best known for that one time Regina punched her in the face (and it was awesome). She also saw Cady wearing army pants and flip-flops, so she bought army pants and flip-flops.\n\nStefanie Drummond, who played Bethany, made her big-screen debut in Mean Girls. She has since appeared in various TV series, including Fuller House, Blindspot, Bosch, Dollface and Gray. Drummond also reunited with her former Mean Girls costar Rachel McAdams in Spotlight. Hopefully, she still wears her army pants and flip-flops.\n\n15 of 19\n\nRajiv Surendra as Kevin Gnapoor\n\nKevin G., Bad-Ass M.C., may be a mathlete, so nerd is inferred, but forget what you heard, he's like James Bond the Third.\n\nRajiv Surendra, who played Kevin G, has shifted his focus from acting to art. He now has a calligraphy and graphic design company called Letters in Ink and a pretty cool career as a chalkboard artist. The actor/artist also dabbles in cooking and lifestyle guidance, launching a YouTube channel to share how to make Sri Lankan Tamil cuisine and do things around (and for) the home.\n\n16 of 19\n\nAlisha Morrison as Lea Edwards\n\nLea was impressed that Regina has two Fendi purses and a silver Lexus. She also wore a skirt that was her mom's in the '80s — it's vintage and so adorable, but in reality, the \"ugliest f------ skirt\" that Regina has ever seen. Getting her hair soaked by a sprinkler is the worst thing to ever happen to her.\n\nAlisha Morrison had just three television roles after appearing in Mean Girls — Instant Star, 'Da Kink in My Hair and The Listener. Her Instagram bio says she now works in human resources.\n\n17 of 19\n\nDiego Klattenhoff as Shane Oman\n\nShane was secretly hooking up with Regina while she was dating Aaron — and then becomes her rebound after they break up. He's the Spring Fling King and also a Kälteen Bar truther.\n\nMean Girls was only the beginning for Diego Klattenhoff, who had roles on Homeland and Mercy, but he is likely best known now for starring as FBI Agent Donald Ressler on The Blacklist. He has appeared in a few films, including Lucky Number Slevin (2006), After Earth (2013) and Pacific Rim (2013).\n\n18 of 19\n\nJan Caruana as Emma Gerber\n\nEmma is memorable for saying that Regina George is flawless, and later, being awarded a small chunk of the Spring Fling Queen crown (her hairdo must have taken hours and she looked really pretty). At lunch, she sits with \"girls who eat their feelings.\"\n\nActress and comedian Jan Caruana later reunited with Rachel McAdams when both were in the 2009 film The Time Traveler's Wife, in which Caruana played a nurse. In addition to her award-winning comedy performances, Caruana was a writer for the Canadian sketch show Sunnyside and the teen dance series The Next Step, among other projects.\n\n19 of 19\n\nJulia Chantrey as Amber D'Alessio\n\nYou may remember Amber as the student who made out with a hot dog, but it was only one time! She also heard that Regina does car commercials in Japan.\n\nNo longer sitting at the \"burnouts\" table in the cafeteria anymore, Julia Chantrey voiced Eva on the Canadian animated series Total Drama, appeared in Guillermo del Toro's 2013 horror film Mama and has made guest appearances in several notable television series, including Flashpoint, The Handmaid's Tale and The Umbrella Academy."
