        "text": "LESLIE LEONARD STEAD 1899 - 1966\n\nLeslie Stead in the Kings Royal Rifles\n\nLeslie Stead aged about 22\n\nLeslie Stead aged about 36\n\nLeslie Stead was the great artist who illustrated most of the Biggles books following the death of Howard Leigh.\n\nI knew very little about him  not even how to pronounce his surname! Was it Stead to rhyme with Bed or was it Stead to rhyme with Deed?\n\nI set about trying to find out more.\n\nI was lucky enough to find a book dealer who had bought some books from the grandson of Leslie Stead. They were books from Leslie Steads personal library\n\nand stamped Steads Private Libary No. (Yes  the word Library is spelt incorrectly as it misses out the first R).\n\nThe bookseller was able to confirm that his name was pronounced Stead as in Bedstead\n\nI bought five books off the dealer, all of which contained the same stamp mark. Those books were:-\n\nBiggles Cuts it Fine (first edition)\n\nBiggles in Australia (first edition)\n\nGimlet Off the Map (first edition)\n\nGimlet Lends a Hand (first edition) &\n\nBiggles Sees it Through (1960 edition  first thus)\n\nI was then later e-mailed by Chris Stead, the Grand Nephew of Leslie Stead, and he put me in touch with his father Brian Stead.\n\nBrian was able to tell me a lot of information about Leslie Stead. Leslie was Brians Great Uncle.\n\nLeslie Stead was born Leslie Leonard Stead on 15th December 1899 in West Norwood and died on 20th August 1966 in Norbury.\n\nDuring the First World War he served as a Private in the Kings Royal Rifles. He married Beatrice Durrell in 1925.\n\nLeslie was one of eight siblings. There were six brothers and two sisters in Leslies family. Leslie was the youngest.\n\nHe had three older brothers, Arthur, Sidney and Percy, all of whom were professional artists as well. His other brothers were Frederick and Alan. His sisters were Maud and Olive.\n\nLeslie had one son, Michael Barrington Stead, who was born on 26th September 1926 and became a draughtsman in the nuclear industry. He died in 1996.\n\nMichael married Freda, who is also now deceased, and they had two children, Barbara and Graham, both in their late forties. If they read this, I would love to hear from them.\n\nAnd the most important piece of information I found out. It is a family story that Leslie Stead based Biggles face upon his own face!\n\nAs Leslie Stead died in August 1966, in tragic circumstances, following his retirement, what was the last Biggles book he himself illustrated?\n\nHis work up to his retirement would have been published afterwards.\n\nThe last Biggles book that had a coloured frontispiece was Biggles Investigates published in October 1964. This was done by Leslie Stead.\n\nThe last Biggles book that he did the internal illustrations for was Biggles Looks Back published on 26th February 1965. After this, no Biggles book had any internal illustrations at all.\n\nHowever, Leslie Stead was still doing the dust wrappers  it would appear up until his death.\n\nThe Biggles books published since Biggles Looks Back in 1965 (excluding the two Norman Wright books) were\n\nBiggles and the Plot that Failed  published in April 1965  the book says on the inner dust wrapper Jacket designed by Leslie Stead.\n\nBiggles and the Blue Moon  published in May 1965  the book says on the inner dust wrapper Jacket designed by Leslie Stead.\n\nBiggles Scores a Bull  published in August 1965 - the book says on the inner dust wrapper Wrapper designed by Studio Stead.\n\nBiggles in the Terai  published in February 1966  the book says on the inner dust wrapper Jacket designed by Leslie Stead.\n\nBiggles and the Gunrunners  published in September 1966  the book says on the inner dust wrapper Jacket designed by Leslie Stead.\n\nBiggles Sorts it Out  published in February 1967  the book says on the inner dust wrapper Jacket designed by Leslie Stead.This was the last book with a credit for Leslie Stead.\n\nI am grateful to a correspondent (who wishes to remain anonymous) for informing me that STUDIO STEAD consisted of FOUR people\n\nStead himself  and he was always known as Stead  never anything less formal  TOM WARDILL and GEORGE CRITCHARD and a chap called Mick whose surname is not known.\n\nI AM RELIABLY INFORMED THAT THE MOST LIKELY ARTIST RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COVERS OF THE LAST BROCKHAMPTON PRESS BIGGLES BOOKS\n\nWAS EITHER TOM WARDILL OR GEORGE CRITCHARD, BUT MOST PROBABLY GEORGE CRITCHARD\n\nBiggles and the Dark Intruder  published as a paperback in April 1967 (the 1970 hardback used the same artwork). There is no artist credited.\n\nBiggles and the Penitent Thief  published in September 1967  the book says on the inner dust wrapper Jacket designed by Studio Stead.\n\nBiggles and the Deep Blue Sea  published in February 1968  the book says on the inner dust wrapper Jacket designed by Studio Stead.\n\nThe Boy Biggles  published in March 1968 (and the last book published in W. E. Johns lifetime as he himself died in June 1968). This Dean & Son book cover was done by an unknown artist.\n\nBiggles in the Underworld  published in September 1968  the book says on the inner dust wrapper Jacket designed by Studio Stead.\n\nBiggles and the Little Green God  published in March 1969  there is no credit for any artist in this book.\n\nBiggles and the Noble Lord  published in August 1969  there is no credit for any artist in this book.\n\nBiggles and the Dark Intruder  published in February 1970  there is no credit for any artist in this book.\n\nBiggles Sees Too Much  published in July 1970  there is no credit for any artist in this book.\n\nSo Leslie Stead definitely did the cover for Biggles Sorts it Out  but did he do the cover of the paperback Biggles and the Dark Intruder?\n\nI would have said not, as that book cover is very much in the style of the later book covers.\n\nSo who was the actual artist (or artists) from Studio Stead who did those later covers? It was either GEORGE CRITCHARD or TOM WARDILL, but probably the former.\n\nIf anyone knows more, please tell me!\n\nRoger HarrisCLICK HERE TO E-MAIL ME\n\nInformation from e-mails received in July 2012 and January 2016.\n\nIf you want to buy some original Leslie Stead artwork  have a look at this page http://www.biggles.info/Artwork/\n\nSOME ORIGINAL STEAD ARTWORK FROM THE WORRALS BOOKS"
