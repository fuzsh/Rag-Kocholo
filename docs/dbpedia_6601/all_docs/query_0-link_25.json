        "text": "My late friend Lawrie Knight’s stories usually check out.\n\nHis first film job was on CAESAR AND CLEOPATRA, an epic mess. “We shipped sand to Egypt!” he said, full of wonderment. “During wartime!”\n\nLawrie was shipped there too, manning a radio from a tent to try to coordinate the battle scenes. “We killed so many people!” he chortled. Years later, he met a man in a London street who greeted him as an old friend, revealed a missing ear, and asked “When are we going to make another film? I’ve still got one ear!”\n\nLawrie claimed, as I recall, that the local extras ate the sandals they were issued with to play Roman or Egyptian soldiers. Soft leather was indeed eaten on long sea voyages when the food ran out, so it can be done. But Marjorie Deans’ lovely making-of book, Meeting at the Sphinx, has a different version: according to her, the soldiers’ shields were made from papier mache, and it was these that ended up being devoured, three hundred of them. A more substantial meal for each poorly-paid extra. Tasty, too: Dean supplies the detail that the shields were varnished with a kind of fish-paste which made them mouth-wateringly delicious.\n\nDeans’ story has more convincing detail, and was told nearer the time…\n\nIt’s possible that both stories are true, and only natural modesty prevented the background artists from consuming their entire wardrobe, denuding themselves. It’s not certain that Deans was on location, but she may have been closer to the action than Lawrie, in his tent, so her story may be more accurate. Or Lawrie may have muddled the story a bit in the ensuing decades. Or I may be misquoting him — maybe his story was about the shields, and he said something else about sandals in another context. It was a while ago.\n\nAt any rate, I feel that we can be sure that somebody ate something they shouldn’t have on the location shoot for this film.\n\nPer the IMDb, the script of CAESAR AND CLEOPATRA (1945) is by George Bernard Shaw, George Bernard Shaw, George Bernard Shaw, and George Bernard Shaw, which seems about right: original play, scenario, script and dialogue. Those don’t normally warrant more than two credits, but maybe they should.\n\nMarjorie Deans is credited as Script Editor, which was her role, and Script Supervisor, a job title which didn’t exist yet. The film had, in addition to four writers embodied in one person, seemingly four cinematographers and two continuity girls (which is the job title that eventually became script supervisor).\n\nDeans also wrote the making-of book, which was a very uncommon thing at the time. This was an epic super-production so it warranted commemoration. In fact, it was kind of a disaster and it ended the British career of its producer/director, Gabriel Pascal, despite his being the only filmmaker with whom Shaw would work. The book doesn’t talk about that, but Deans, a screenwriter herself, devotes a lot of time to praising Shaw as a screenwriter, pointing out that his plays are full of striking imagery —\n\n“They come down the corridor, Caesar peering keenly about at the strange architecture, and at the pillars’ shadows between which, as the passing torch makes them hurry noiselessly backwards, figures of men with wings and hawks’ heads, and vast black marble cats, seem to flit in and out of ambush.”\n\nIt’s questionable if any stage director ever managed to fully achieve this effect, but Pascal (at 14:55 in the movie above) barely suggests it either — he stages the scene outdoors, at the entrance to the palace, and though Claude Rains remembers to peer keenly, and Pascal remembers to move the camera, whichever great cinematographer* was on lighting duty that day doesn’t create any moving shadows (apart from Caesar’s, which shouldn’t appear since he’s the light source), just a moving glow which doesn’t illuminate anything that’s not already visible. And Pascal fails to provide a POV shot, which is what the play, for God’s sake, is clearly indicating.\n\n*The cinematographers between them shot most of BLACK NARCISSUS, BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI, LAWRENCE OF ARABIA and THE THIRD MAN.\n\nNo script is director-proof — you can suggest what we should see, and a sensitive director will pick it up (and many times improve it) but a clod will drag everything down to his level.\n\nIt’s a really beautiful book. Sometimes the insights could be more meaningful (and of course it’s all a puff-piece). We’re told that composer Georges Auric is “a big, loosely-built, rather indolent-looking man” with a dangling cigarette, but we’re not told that he used the first electronic instrument ever employed for the screen (the fabulously-named ondes martinot) for this film. My late friend Lawrie Knight was in the crew and reported the excitement this caused, though how the crew ever got to see it I don’t know.\n\nI was hoping the book would confirm one or two of Lawrie’s stories, but most of those were too unflattering to Pascal and the production, or too racy, to serve Deans’ purposes. BUT — Lawrie did own a framed picture of Gabbie Pascal, in Arab dress, leading a camel. And Deans supplies the backstory to this —\n\n“There is a camel-driver, played by Gabriel Pascal himself, because only he understood and was understood by the camel, and could make it do what he wanted. And there is the camel, who bit Gabriel Pascal…”\n\nLawrie made much more of this story. They had a real camel-driver, who protested that a camel could not be made to stop on a precise mark. Pascal said this was rubbish, took on the costume, led the camel to its position in one perfect take, yelled “Cut!” and then had a bite taken out of him.\n\nThe crew clustered round, concerned/delighted. Pascal, in his broken English, insisted it was nothing. “But Gabbie, what about the danger of syphilis?” “What you say, I no have syphilis.” “No, it’s true, all camels are full of syphilis.” (I think this is probably untrue, and likely an offshoot from the joke about why camels are called ships of the desert…)\n\nA doctor was sent for. He dressed the wound and pronounced it trivial.\n\n“But doctor,” says a crewmember/provocateur, “What about the danger of syphilis being passed on?”\n\n“Well, if you think it’s necessary, I can give the camel an injection.”\n\nNow, this may well be a fictitious elaboration. It has the shape of a deliberate joke, not a real incident. But I’m pleased that at least part of Lawrie’s story is confirmed.\n\nI don’t think Pascal and the camel made the cut — the set where they were to have appeared is at 22:48.\n\nDeans has more to say that relates to the tales I was told twenty years ago, and I shall get another blog post (at least) out of those. And I shall scan more of the gorgeous images, though scanning is a pain.\n\nGabriel Pascal, the penniless Hungarian émigré who somehow convinced George Bernard Shaw he was a genius, and got the go-ahead to adapt MAJOR BARBARA, PYGMALION, and CAESAR AND CLEOPATRA as movies.\n\nI couldn’t remember, offhand, which of my late friend Lawrie’s stories I’d perpetuated here on Shadowplay concerningproducer/director/charlatan Gabriel Pascal. I found some of the stories here, but there are more. Pascal was Lawrie’s first boss in the film industry, as he exited WWII and entered the less murderous but not dissimilar madness of the motion picture industry.\n\nAll Lawrie’s stories are true — the ones I’ve been able to check, anyway. Some of the unconfirmed ones seem decidedly fantastical in a David Niven kind of way, and it’s worth recalling that Lawrie doubled for Niven in A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH…\n\nLawrie entered the film business after exiting the armed forces under circumstances I wasn’t quite clear about. The war was still on, and he was in the Air Force Air Sea Rescue. His war stories are as colourful as his film stories. He mentioned something about pretending to be suicidal so he could escape duty for a day and go to the cinema, which worked fine until the men with the straitjacket came for him a few days later. He also talked about being adrift at sea alone in a lifeboat, with only a newspaper for company. In the paper was an article about the film producer who discovered Leslie Howard. Lawrie resolved to look the man up and ask for a job, if he ever got out of this…\n\nOn his release from the army, he presented himself to the producer. “I’ve come about a job,” he said. The man looked delighted. “Oh, thank God! What kind of job do you have for me?”\n\nOnly slightly deterred by this early proof of the shakiness of a career in moving pictures, Lawrie went to Rank Denham. The doorman was going to send him away, but when he gave his name as Knight, the man asked “Captain Knight”? Lawrie lied and said yes, and was shown in. (Captain Knight was a celebrated explorer and sometime actor, who appears, with his pet eagle, in Michael Powell’s I KNOW WHERE I’M GOING — and Powell would play a major role in Lawrie’s career). Lawrie was show in to see the top man, who was in conference with Claude Rains. His imposture was immediately rumbled, but he somehow landed a job as assistant on the current super-production, CAESAR AND CLEOPATRA.\n\nThe movie was insanity itself. “We shipped sand to Egypt for the desert scenes!” exclaimed Lawrie. “During wartime!” He also reported that when a group of local extras was outfitted with soft sandals, they immediately ate them. A scenic artist painted elaborate murals all over the sets, and director Pascal chose to shoot all the action in front of the only bare wall in the studio.\n\nBut Lawrie’s most unlikely anecdote concerned a camel. It was supposed to be led into a shot, bearing one of the stars on its back, and halt on its mark. But in take after take, it refused to do so. Pascal was apoplectic. The camel wrangler tried to explain to him that a camel simply could not be made to perform as precisely as Pascal demanded. Pascal dismissed this, and promtly put on the camel herder’s costume and did the scene himself.\n\nThe camel stopped exactly where it was supposed to. “There!” exclaimed Pascal, gesturing in satisfaction, and the camel bit him. Everybody crowded around the bleeding hyphenate, who insisted he was alright. “We’d better get you a doctor.” “No, I’m fine!” “But what about the VD?” “What are you talking about, VD? I don’t have VD!” “No, but all camels do. We’d better get you a doctor.”\n\nThe doctor was called. He bandaged the wound.\n\n“What about the risk of VD infection?” asked a crewmember.\n\n“I doubt you have to worry. But if you really think it necessary, I can give the camel some penicillin.”\n\nAs I say, this story may not be absolutely truthful. All I can say is, the stories Lawrie told which I was able to check, were."
