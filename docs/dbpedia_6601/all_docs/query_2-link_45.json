        "text": "Haven't watched it yet, but for starters, the woman in the thumbnail? Way too hot to be the real Cleopatra, she wasn't even beautiful.\n\nPlutarch said she was \"plain\" ... based on the medical student Philotas' opinion. Maybe he liked big butts or something.\n\nLucan, Cassius Dio, and Appian said she was beautiful ... they were describing her statue in the Temple of Venus Genetrix, that was carved from life and placed there by Caesar.\n\nThe carving at Dendera is religious iconography: no one thinks she looked like that.\n\nThe image on the coin with Antony is political iconography: at the time, wives were made to look like their husbands.\n\nNone of the the busts from Germany to the Vatican have \"Cleopatra\" carved on them: they're guessing.\n\nIn the last decade, it was pointed out that Cleopatra invented the \"triple uraeus\": instead of two things sticking out of the top of her headress there were three. No other figure in Egyptian history wore that, so every image with a triple uraeus *IS* Cleopatra VII. Notice the similarity in the faces. I think the little one is slightly more youthful than the big one, but it''s the same face.\n\nI don't know WHAT they're talking about by \"Greek dress.\" She's wearing a transparent sheath dress, which appears in Egyptian paintings for 1000's of years. The \"horn of plenty\" was introduced by Arsinoe II and is used to tie Cleopatra to her ancestor. It is believed the other hand was holding an ankh, from Isis symbology.\n\nAn ankh in both hands, here.\n\nMaybe her face isn't that special, but it's kind of hard to concentrate on it. Just sayin' ...\n\nPlutarch said she was \"plain\" ... based on the medical student Philotas' opinion.
