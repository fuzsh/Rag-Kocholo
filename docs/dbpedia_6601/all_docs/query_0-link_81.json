        "text": "Cleopatra VII (69-30 BC) – the last true pharaoh of the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt – has been immortalised through centuries of art, music and literature.\n\nKnown for her great physical beauty, intellect, political acumen, and love affairs with prominent Roman leaders Julius Caesar and Mark Antony, she continues to captivate and intrigue people worldwide. Her reign came to a tragic end after the Battle of Actium – after the defeat of Mark Antony and Cleopatra’s forces by Octavian (the future Emperor Augustus), she and Antony took their lives.\n\nCleopatra’s enigmatic persona has inspired countless artistic interpretations, emphasising the complexities of power, ambition, and love, and her enduring legacy as a symbol of strength and resilience make her an endlessly captivating subject. Here are some of her more notable depictions:\n\nCleopatra (1934)\n\nThe 1934 film Cleopatra offers a classic portrayal of the legendary queen. Directed by Cecil B. DeMille, the film stars Claudette Colbert as Cleopatra, showcasing her as a seductive and ambitious ruler. Colbert’s performance captures Cleopatra’s allure and cunning, portraying her as a woman who uses her charm to manipulate men and secure her power.\n\nThe film emphasises Cleopatra’s relationships with Julius Caesar and Mark Antony, delving into her political strategies and romantic entanglements. While the portrayal may be influenced by the era’s sensibilities, Colbert’s Cleopatra remains an intriguing and captivating character in this classic Hollywood interpretation.\n\nCaesar and Cleopatra (1945)\n\nThis unique portrayal of Cleopatra emphasises her transformation from a naive young queen to a formidable leader. Directed by Gabriel Pascal, the film stars Vivien Leigh as Cleopatra, showcasing her as a charming and witty ruler.\n\nLeigh’s portrayal captures Cleopatra’s growth and development under the guidance of Julius Caesar, and highlights Cleopatra’s intelligence and cunning as she learns to navigate the political intrigues of her time. Leigh’s performance adds depth to Cleopatra’s character, depicting her as a resilient and influential figure."
