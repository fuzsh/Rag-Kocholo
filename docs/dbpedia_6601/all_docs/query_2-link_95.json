        "text": "CLEOPATRA.\" More than two years in the making. A cast of thousands. Starring Elizabeth Taylor, Rex Harrison and Richard Burton. \"Not a terrible film by any means,\" said Martin Landau, who played the Roman officer Rufio in the movie, directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz. It was pretty bad, though, despite its front-rank talent. When it opened in the summer of 1963, the film was as notorious for its extravagant production costs as for the tumultuous affair between Burton and Ms. Taylor that had begun on the set. On screen, the machinations in Roman and Egyptian high places had their moments, but artistically \"Cleopatra\" was swallowed by its gilded pavilions. For all the gigantism, one critic called it a mouse.\n\nBut \"Cleopatra\" walked like a pachyderm and talked like one, too. \"Nothing has come into Rome like this since Romulus and Remus!\" exclaims Marc Antony (Burton), agog at Cleopatra's Vegas-style entry into the city atop a towering platform hauled by hundreds of harnessed extras.\n\nIt's all fun to watch, but as a new three- disc (two wouldn't do) DVD special edition makes clear, the major spectacle took place behind the scenes.\n\nOn one disc an excellent two-hour documentary, \"Cleopatra: the Movie That Changed Hollywood,\" stirs a fascination the movie never approaches. \"Change\" supposedly refers to the realization that a studio, in this case a wobbly 20th Century Fox, should never take on such a huge project without financial partners. How closely Hollywood has heeded that lesson is arguable, but \"Cleopatra\" still stands as an example of what can happen when a production is allowed to hemorrhage money. Part of the responsibility lay with Spyros P. Skouras, president of Fox, who saw the film as a savior and kept funds flowing even as he ranted about costs.\n\nFox was indulging Mankiewicz's grand vision. A major director and screenwriter, he won Oscars two years running for \"A Letter to Three Wives\" (1949) and \"All About Eve\" (1950). \"Julius Caesar\" (1953), which he wrote and directed, is one of the better Shakespearean adaptations. But \"Cleopatra\" got away from him. \"His scripts were literary,\" Mr. Landau said in an interview. \"Look at his past work and it's clever stuff. Here, though, a lot of intricate scenes were cut because Zanuck wanted pageantry.\"\n\nFiercely fought-for parking spaces had been sitting empty on the Fox lot when Daryl F. Zanuck took over the movie and the studio in 1962. Thanks to \"Cleopatra,\" months behind schedule and many millions over budget, Fox was nearly broke. In Italy, where the production had moved from England, the sets alone are said to have cleaned out the construction industry. Ms. Taylor was working on overtime at $50,000 a week. The project is said to have cost $40 million. Today it would have been $200 million, roughly the cost of \"Titanic.\"\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
