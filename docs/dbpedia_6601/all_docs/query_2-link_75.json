But he let her children with Mark Antony live, sending them to be raised, ironically, by Antony’s ex-wife, Octavian’s sister, Octavia, the docuseries explains.\n\nThough the fate of Antony and Cleopatra’s sons Alexander Helios and Ptolemy Philadelphus is unknown and it’s suspected that they both died young, their sister, Cleopatra Selene, lived into adulthood and ultimately married a king named Juba II of Numidia and Mauretania. She became Queen of Mauretania from 25 B.C. to 5 B.C."
