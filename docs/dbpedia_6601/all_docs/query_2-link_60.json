        "text": "Synopsis\n\nNetflix’s new series based on the life of Queen Cleopatra has created a row as people in Egypt have accused the show of making factual errors.\n\nNetflix's docudrama on the life of Cleopatra, ancient Egypt's renowned queen, has ignited controversy surrounding its casting choices, particularly the portrayal of Cleopatra by a Black woman. This has resulted in outrage from individuals in Egypt, who argue that it amounts to cultural appropriation and a distortion of their history. Egypt's Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities has released a lengthy statement emphasizing that \"Queen Cleopatra had light skin and Hellenistic (Greek) features,\" criticizing Netflix for selecting Adele James, who, according to the Ministry, possesses \"African features and dark skin.\"\n\nThe three-part docudrama, produced by Jada Pinkett Smith and featuring biracial British actor Adele James as Queen Cleopatra, was released on May 10. It is important to note that this is not the first instance of controversy surrounding the depiction of Cleopatra's skin color.\n\nWho was Queen Cleopatra?\n\nCleopatra VII, the final monarch of the Ptolemaic dynasty, which originated from Macedonian-Greek roots and ruled Egypt from the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC until the country's conquest by Octavian (later Emperor Augustus) in 30 BC. Throughout her 21-year reign (51-30 BC), Cleopatra is celebrated for her skillful diplomacy and personal charisma, which allowed her to maintain Egypt's autonomy amidst the expanding Roman Empire. Her suicide marked the end of Egyptian civilization as a vibrant living culture.\n\nOver the years, Cleopatra has captivated historians and the general public alike, with her story being retold in popular literature and films, often portraying her as a seductive temptress.\n\nWhat do the critics say about Queen Cleopatra’s docuseries?\n\nCritics of Netflix's docudrama argue that since it is marketed as a documentary, it should adhere to factual accuracy. The Egyptian Ministry emphasized the importance of basing the film on historical and scientific facts, to avoid falsifying history and civilizations. A formal complaint against the film has been filed by an Egyptian lawyer who stated, \"Our main objection is the falsification of these facts. It is not about being Black or White or even Yellow. Let's say they wanted to portray Cleopatra as a man, we would also object to that.\"\n\nNetflix has been accused of \"blackwashing\" by inserting a Black character for political reasons, disregarding historical accuracy, according to critics.\n\nThe controversy surrounding the casting choices in Netflix's docudrama continues to fuel discussions about representation, historical accuracy, and cultural sensitivity.\n\nFAQs\n\nQ1:Why is Cleopatra so famous?\n\nQueen of Egypt (51–30 BCE) Cleopatra actively influenced Roman politics at a crucial period and was especially known for her relationships with Julius Caesar and Mark Antony.\n\nQ2:How old was Cleopatra when she was crowned?\n\nFollowing the death of her father, Ptolemy XII Auletes, Cleopatra ascended to the throne in 51 BCE with one of her younger brothers as co-regent. The 18-year-old queen found herself embroiled in court intrigue and soon was ousted from Alexandria, the capital of her realm.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nDisclaimer Statement: This content is authored by a 3rd party.
