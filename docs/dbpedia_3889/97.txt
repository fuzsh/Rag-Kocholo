Flash of Genius, based on a 1993 New Yorker article by John Seabrook, opens on Friday. Greg Kinnear stars as Robert Kearns, an engineer who for decades fought Detroit automakers after they stole his invention: the intermittent windshield wiper. The article is included in the Seabrook's book Flash of Genius: And Other True Stories of Invention (St. Martin's Griffin, $14.95, 9780312535728/0312535724).
