        "text": "Greg Kinnear will join Keira Knightley in the movie Misbehaviour, starring as Bob Hope in the dramedy about the disrupted Miss World contest in 1970.\n\nIn further casting additions, Phantom Thread‘s Lesley Manville has come on board to play Hope’s wife, Dolores, with Bodyguard‘s Keeley Hawes, Notting Hill‘s Rhys Ifans and Downton Abbey‘s Phyllis Logan also joining the project.\n\nGugu Mbatha-Raw and Jessie Buckley were previously announced as appearing with Knightley in the comedy-drama, which tells the story of how the newly founded Women’s Liberation Movement stormed the stage during the live broadcast of the pageant.\n\nHope hosted the 1970 Miss World event, which at the time was the most-watched show around the globe, with more than 100 million viewers. When the show resumed, viewers were surprised to see the first black winner in the history of the contest crowned.\n\nBAFTA winner Philippa Lowthorpe (Three Girls) is set to direct the project, which is produced by The Crown‘s Suzanne Mackie and Sarah-Jane Wheale. The film is based on an original script by Rebecca Flynn and Gaby Chiappe.\n\nFlynn and Andy Harries are executive producing for Left Bank Pictures, Cameron McCracken and Jenny Borgars for Pathe, Rose Garnett for BBC Films, Natascha Wharton for the BFI and Andrea Scarso for Ingenious.\n\nThe shoot starts this week in London and is set to wrap in early 2019. Pathe will distribute in the U.K., France and Switzerland and handle global sales."
