        "text": "It’s not surprising that John Seabrook’s magazine article about Robert Kearns attracted attention. Kearns took on a giant corporation and refused to give up. That’s a story we can admire and respect. However the makers of “Flash of Genius” faced a problem they couldn’t quite solve: This is a story about windshield wipers.\n\nKearns (played by Greg Kinnear) was a college professor who liked to dabble with inventions in his basement. In the 1960s he came up with what’s known as the “intermittent windshield wiper” that could be set to a slower or higher pace depending on the nature of the rainfall. As he notes on a trip home, in a light rain the wipers are squeaking across barely wet glass, but if he turns it off he soon loses visibility.\n\nAre you on the edge of your seat yet?\n\nThis is a useful invention, no doubt, and Kearns had licked the problem that the major auto manufacturers couldn’t solve. He makes what he thinks is a rock solid deal with the Ford Motor Co., but they then back out only to put their own version of the wipers on the market. Kearns decides to sue even though Ford can afford to drag it out for years and he’s one small guy with a wife and growing family. A lawyer (Alan Alda) agrees to take on the case and see that justice is done, but it doesn’t quite turn out that way.\n\nKearns, according to the film, was less interested in the money than in the acknow-ledgement that it was his invention. Of course he expected to be paid, but unless it came with public notice, he turned down all offers to settle. This makes for a film where we essentially spin our wheels for most of the running time waiting for the only thing that really counts in the story, the showdown between Kearns and Ford. It takes up the last section of the film, and there is a certain satisfaction in seeing him confront the people who thought they could steal his creation with impunity.\n\nIt’s the principle of the thing, of course, but when he turns down enough money to put his kids through college, it’s fair to ask if ego trumps everything else. Given the choice of security for your family or putting it all at risk for the sake of being known as the inventor of the intermittent windshield wiper, one wishes the fight was over something a bit more important.\n\nThis takes nothing away from Kearns’ real-life battle. It’s a question of what makes for a riveting movie. Jimmy Stewart became a star waging such a futile battle in the classic “Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.”\n\nGreg Kinnear does not rise to that level, and his bland amiability — which works in his favor in the current “Ghost Town” — works against him here. His performance lacks that “Flash of Genius” that would make us want to follow this struggle for two hours on the big screen.\n\nA Universal Pictures presentation\n\nRating: PG-13 for brief strong language\n\nRunning time: 1 hour, 59 minutes\n\n‘Flash of Genius’"
