        "text": "Hollywood funnyman Greg Kinnear blew into Boston to pick up Best Actor kudos on the final night of the Boston Film Festival after a screening of his David-and-Goliath flick , “Flash of Genius.”\n\nThe real-life drama is about Prof. Bob Kearns, the inventor of the intermittent windshield wiper, and how he sued Ford Motor Company back in the ’60s for stealing his invention and plopping it on their cars.\n\n“If someone said today, ‘I’m gonna sue Microsoft by myself,’ you’d give them a couple of Ambien and put them to bed, because that’s the craziest notion,” said the “Little Miss Sunshine” star during the post-screening Q & A with director Marc Abraham at the Kendall Square Cinema. “I think the audacity of what he did is amazing to the point where I’m not sure it could happen anymore.”\n\nKinnear, whose film will have a wide release next month, said he loved how “human” his character appeared to be.\n\n“He was abrasive and could be a little prickly at times,” said the leading man. “Reading the script, I found myself genuinely wanting this guy to find some satisfaction and to win.”\n\nIn the film, Kearns suffers a nervous breakdown when he first hears Ford has used his design.\n\n“I would be so much less interested in his journey if he was just a crazy guy. We were lucky, because that wasn’t the case,” Kinnear said. “He had a breakdown and he went through a difficult time, but I don’t think there was any disability in him.”\n\nThe film stars Lauren Graham, Dermot Mulroney and Alan Alda.\n\nSo, have Bob Kearns’ struggles made Kinnear think twice when he turns on his windshield wipers?\n\n“Absolutely,” he said. “There’s no possible way for me to turn on my intermittent wipers and not think of Dr. Robert Kearns. My 4-year-old daughter calls them ‘intermittence’ wipers.”\n\nAfter the film, Kinnear, Abraham and the Boston Film Festival peeps repaired to Cheers at Faneuil Hall Marketplace for applause and cocktails. Where, of course, everyone knew Greg’s name . . ."
