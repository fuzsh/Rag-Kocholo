        "text": "Universal has debuted the full trailer for Flash of Genius, a drama about college professor and inventor Robert Kearns whose invention of intermittent windshield wiper was ultimately stolen by the automobile manufacturers in the 1960s. Comparisons can be made to movies full of hope and ambition like Will Smith's Pursuit of Happyness, and Flash of Genius looks like it could be just as good. There are always a lot of great stories about successful and proud individuals in history that go unnoticed. This is one of them. Last year I saw the highly underrated movie The Flying Scotsman, a fantastic film about a determined cyclist. Flash of Genius looks like another wonderful story about a man who just couldn't let them get away with stealing his invention. And damnit, I love seeing these kinds of heartwarming films.\n\nWatch the official trailer for Flash of Genius from YouTube:\n\nYou can also watch the Flash of Genius trailer in High Definition on Apple\n\nBased on the true story of college professor and part-time inventor Robert Kearns' (Greg Kinnear) long battle with the U.S. automobile industry, Flash of Genius tells the tale of one man whose fight to receive recognition for his ingenuity would come at a heavy price. But this determined engineer refused to be silenced, and he took on the corporate titans in a battle that nobody thought he could win.\n\nFlash of Genius is directed by long-time producer and first-time director Marc Abraham, with a script written by Philip Railsback, of La Cruz de Iberia and The Stars Fell on Henrietta previously. The film is based on the true story of Kearns as told in John Seabrook's article in the New Yorker. Universal is releasing Flash of Genius in theaters on October 17th. The poster is featured below."
