cameras got set up\n\nand the lights, they would say okay bring Judy in\n\nand poor Timer would just look around and get swept off\n\nthe stage, she'd be like, wha, I can run circles around\n\nthis bitch, wait a second.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\n[Announcer] Simon Bishop, As Good As It Gets.\n\nThat was a script by Mark Andrews and Jim Brooks\n\nthat was off the charts great.\n\nStill to this day one of the best scripts I ever read,\n\nit was called Old Friends and Jim kept going no man,\n\nI don't like the name, the name's terrible\n\nand I was like, Jim, trust me, the name's great.\n\nHe was right, I was wrong.\n\nAs good as it gets was a line that Jack utters in the movie.\n\nI was shooting another film up in San Francisco\n\nand Jim Brooks and Francine Maisler actually came up\n\nto visit me, you know, I read for 'em\n\nand I kept just trying to pretend that Jack Nicholson\n\nwas not in the movie because I was too [chuckles]\n\nI was just too big of a fan, it was too crazy\n\nto think that I was getting close to doing a movie\n\nwith Jack, much less, when I got the call saying\n\nokay Greg, we're gonna have you go over\n\nto Jack's house tonight and just, you know,\n\nread through some scenes.\n\nOh really?\n\nThat's it, huh?\n\nJust go to Jack's house and read through some scenes.\n\nIt was terrifying.\n\nEverything looks distorted and everything inside\n\njust kind of aches and you can barely find\n\nthe will to complain.\n\nYeah, um, I'm glad we did this.\n\nWe shot the movie for a very, very long time\n\nand I felt like Jim, who's such a brilliant artist,\n\nwas just searching for the sound,\n\nhe knew it so specifically, and I was a huge fan\n\nof Broadcast News and Terms of Endearment.\n\nHe so didn't disappoint me in being the artist\n\nthat I knew he was and was so great at bringing\n\nall of us, that whole cast, including Helen,\n\nwho's off the charts great, together in knowing\n\nwhat we were all there to do.\n\nHe had a thing he was looking for and the more we shot,\n\nthe more it seemed to coalesce.\n\n[Announcer] Frank Navasky, You've Got Mail,\n\nwell that was with Nora Ephron, the wonderful,\n\ntalented Nora, I cannot say enough about that woman.\n\nIncredible writer and talented human being.\n\nIt was kind of based on a writer from The Observer\n\nin New York that she knew.\n\nThe guy I was playing in it was,\n\nhe was a little bit of a nerd and it was great fun to play\n\nbecause he was, he's definitely the guy\n\nthat doesn't get the girl.\n\nWhen you got Tom in the movie and Meg,\n\nit ain't goin' my way, ya know.\n\nYou don't love me.\n\n[laughs]\n\nMe either.\n\nYou don't love me?\n\nI really liked Frank, he was a lovely little character\n\nand I felt like I was just gonna make an observation\n\nabout something that would have been funny and amusing.\n\nBut I lost it.\n\nHold on.\n\nIt's giving me time to think about what I was going\n\nto say about Frank, no, no, tool around with that\n\nfor a second, it still looks off to me,\n\nI think the microphone, look at that.\n\nI feel like that's not gonna work.\n\n[crew laughing]\n\nI worked with Michael Palin, the great Michael Palin,\n\none of my favorite actors dating back to Monty Python days,\n\nwas also in, people don't realize this,\n\n'cause he ended up getting cut out of the movie, tragically,\n\nbecause we had great stuff, Michael had a really funny role\n\nin the movie and it just didn't pan out in the final story\n\nbut one of the great joys of the movie is a bunch of stuff\n\nthat ended up on the cutting room floor for me.\n\nIt was my work with Michael.\n\n[Announcer] David Larrabee, Sabrina.\n\nIt was the first movie that I ever got cast in.\n\nI was basically looking at clips of Jerry Springer\n\nand Geraldo on a show called Talk Soup\n\nand Sidney Pollack who's an amazing director,\n\nproducer and actor, damn, he's good, got a hold\n\nof a tape from that show and brought me into his office\n\nto talk to him about the role.\n\nI had just thought he wanted me to come in there\n\n'cause he couldn't believe anybody else was from\n\na smaller town than him in Indiana.\n\nHe was engaging and interesting and got me relaxed\n\nthen told me I'd be playing Harrison Ford's brother\n\nwhich kind of killed the relaxation part of it.\n\nI'm not ready to make this kind of commitment.\n\nI see, she must have asked for an actual wedding date.\n\nI don't know what came over me,\n\nshe was healing children, I was in a tuxedo,\n\nI'm not in any position to take care of a wife.\n\nElizabeth is a doctor and a millionaire, David,\n\nshe won't be a burden.\n\nWe read through a few scenes and he had me come back\n\nand eventually I got a call from my agent asking me\n\nif I was sitting down.\n\nI believe I was but he told me that I was gonna play\n\nthis role and it was a tricky movie to do\n\nbecause obviously it's a beloved remake.\n\nWilliam Holden is certainly a beloved actor,\n\nmy mom was a big fan and I was taking on his role\n\nand I kind of felt like this isn't real.\n\nThe set was very way crazy over the top\n\nwith always what seemed to be a thousand extras\n\nand everybody sipping champagne both when we were rolling\n\nand not rolling, it was all quite lovely\n\nand it was a hell of a way to start.\n\n[Announcer] Auto Focus, Bob Crane.\n\nBob Crane was a TV star from the 70s on a show\n\nthat I loved called Hogan's Heroes and it turns out\n\nBob had a bit of what we think is a sexual addiction.\n\nWillem Dafoe plays John Carpenter, the man who was suspected\n\nultimately of bludgeoning Bob to death with a camera tripod\n\nand it's definitely a tragic story\n\nbut it was an interesting,\n\nespecially in the current environment,\n\nand all of its accesses.\n\nWell word is, Colonel, there's gonna be\n\na surprise inspection.\n\nI don't know about you guys but if there's gonna be\n\nan inspection, I got things to hide.\n\nI got things to hide.\n\nThere's gonna be an inspection.\n\nIt's kind of an outrageous movie\n\nbut one of my favorite films.\n\nMy kids are never gonna watch it\n\nbut I actually really think that movie is profound\n\nand there's no doubt that it captures the essence\n\nof a struggle that this guy really had.\n\n[Announcer] Richard Hoover, Little Miss Sunshine.\n\nYeah, that was a movie.\n\nI'm sorry, just having a...\n\nUm, I don't know what to say about that.\n\nMan, that was a good movie.\n\nWe can skip around. Yeah, we can skip around.\n\nHuh?\n\nNo, no, no but I like that movie.\n\nI'm trying to think of what I do want to talk about.\n\nLet's not skip through the...\n\nThat's a hit for God's sakes, let's keep it on for a second.\n\nI'm waxing poetic on a movie that was seen\n\nby about a hundred thousand people,\n\nwe finally are at Little Miss Sunshine,\n\nyou want to move on?\n\nFor God's sakes, I don't got that many of these.\n\n[crew laughing]\n\n[chuckling]\n\nAnyway, what'd you ask about?\n\nThat movie was a gift.\n\nJonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris had not directed\n\na movie before, they had done a lot of commercial work.\n\nThis movie had been out there, in fact a friend of mine,\n\nDavid Friendly, first showed me the script\n\nand I was like yeah, seems cool, let's do it\n\nand it just couldn't get its funding together.\n\nNobody thought there was a movie to be made\n\nand so a year went by, two years went by,\n\nI was a little in touch with John and Valerie\n\nand they were like yeah, we really want to make the movie\n\n'cause this Abigail Breslin's gettin' older\n\nso Abigail was now I think nine, nine and a half,\n\nwhen we finally shot it.\n\nAnd she was just so right for that role\n\nfor obvious reasons.\n\nThe producer, Mark Turtlebaum, I thinK originally just,\n\nI think he just wrote a check for seven million dollars\n\nand that's how we ended up making the movie\n\nbut the script was great, it was great.\n\nYou know, much better than I realized, honestly,\n\nI read Little Miss Sunshine, I was like yeah, it's good.\n\nI don't know, it seemed good, it seemed smart\n\nand then as we got closer to it and I kind of like,\n\nkind of dove into it again I was like oh my gosh,\n\nthis thing is so great, every beat, ever nuance,\n\nthe characters, everything and I just,\n\nI knew it was first blush good\n\nbut I didn't know it was exceptional.\n\nBut it really was and I thought once we got together,\n\nwe really had something because John and Val wanted\n\nto do a thing which no one seems to do anymore\n\nin show business called rehearsal so we all got together\n\nin this strange space over in, I don't know,\n\nnear Culver City.\n\nSteve and Tony and Alan, the whole gang, we did weird stuff,\n\nit was weird actory stuff, we had little diaries\n\nand we'd write what the other characters thought about us.\n\nWe played dodge ball together.\n\nI drove us in that yellow van to the valley to go bowling\n\nand about killed us for the first time.\n\nWhen we made the movie, I almost killed us another 30\n\nor 40 times, it was the most dangerous movie ever mad\n\n'cause we did all our own driving,\n\nwe didn't have stunt people, nobody could afford that.\n\nCome on honey. I'm putting it in gear.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nGo honey. Come on.\n\nCome on, Olive, run, run.\n\nCome on. Come on.\n\nSheryl, let's go. [screaming]\n\n[upbeat music] Frank, let's go.\n\nIf you saw a red or a yellow van screaming down\n\nthe freeway at about 60 miles an hour\n\nwith a bunch of cameras in it, it was probably us.\n\n[Announcer] Brigsby Bear, Detective Vogel.\n\nA very kind of imaginative script and I had no idea\n\nhow that movie was gonna turn out and it's a little gem.\n\nIt's a great little film that captures the spirit\n\nof imagination and creativity.\n\nWhat's that on your shirt?\n\nIt's Brigsby.\n\nOf course.\n\nDetective Vogel is a closeted actor [chuckles]\n\nand he actually is helping James, who's a kidnap victim,\n\nwho's kind of adapting to his new freedom,\n\nin making a movie, he wants to make a movie\n\ncalled Brigsby Bear based upon a movie\n\nthat his psychotic captor played by Mark Hamill,\n\nactually, showed him repeatedly when he was a child.\n\nI hope this is all making perfect sense to you at home\n\nwho haven't seen the movie because I can't explain it\n\nany clearer than that but it's a great movie,\n\nthat's all I can tell ya.\n\n[Announcer] Dr. David Ravell,\n\nNurse Betty was a wonderful script.\n\nIn fact, it won the Golden Globe, I believe, that year.\n\nI was playing a soap opera star opposite Renee Zellweger.\n\nShe has developed, say, a strange kind of otherworldly crush\n\non me and believes that I am a real doctor.\n\nChris Rock, Morgan Freeman, also in the movie,\n\ndirected by Neil LaBute, it's a really, really good movie.\n\nOne of my favorites, and I remember them\n\nreally having trouble with it,\n\nI remember watching an early cut of Nurse Betty\n\nand saying well that sucks because it just didn't work\n\nand they finally, they found it though\n\nthrough a lot of work and effort, I think,\n\nand it shows you what can happen editorially.\n\nI also remember because I worked, again, with Renee\n\nnot too long ago and we were recounting the fact\n\nthat I kind of lost it, it's the only movie I've ever done\n\nin my life where I literally just lost it.\n\nWe had a scene where she's in a little nurse's outfit\n\nand we're in a diner and I'm Dr. David Ravell\n\nand I say something and we're on a soap opera now.\n\nThere's always a chance, David.\n\nBut what about tomorrow and the next day and the next day?\n\nWe just lost it.\n\nWe lost it completely, I've never laughed so hard\n\nand it was funny at first and as the time went by,\n\nyou know you're kind of looking at the crew,\n\npeople are looking around and Renee and I\n\nare recognizing that it's kind of past\n\nits expiration point now and we really just need\n\nto shoot the goddamn thing.\n\nI ended up with a C stand with a tennis ball on it\n\nrepresenting Renee Zellweger saying,\n\nJerry, your eyes look like moon beams,\n\nor whatever the hell the line was\n\nand she did the same for me,\n\nthat's the only way we could complete the scene.\n\nWe're both mortified by it to this day\n\nbut hey man, show business.\n\n[Announcer] Bill Sherpherd, House of Cards.\n\nGreat thrill to do it in the sense that it's just\n\nan iconic show and it deserves to have a final season\n\nwhich was close to not happening.\n\nCredit to Robin Wright for kind of keeping\n\nthe train on the tracks.\n\nAlso the writers being able to retool this\n\nand I thank MRC and Netflix for taking care of the crew.\n\nThis is an incredible crew, you watch that show\n\nand yeah the actors are front and center\n\nbut there are so many professionals behind\n\nthe camera making it look seamless and incredible.\n\nIt was great fun to do it, I've always been a fan\n\nof Diana Lane's, the idea that she would be my sister\n\nand partner in evil seemed great.\n\nWe do have kind of a Bob Hope Doris Day thing going on\n\nso to actually flip that upside down\n\nand make us formidable enemies trying\n\nto destroy Claire's life was, I think, pretty effective.\n\nIt was great fun to do, I mean they really know how\n\nto create chaos, even more than what's happening\n\nin Washington on House of Cards, it's pretty good stuff.\n\nYou know, it's a hard question what you look for\n\nin a character because I'm not looking for anything\n\nwhen I read a script.\n\nIt kind of needs to find me, I feel like,\n\nit's like, I never thought of a a guy capable\n\nof doing that or having that agenda.\n\nThis is all, writers are great at this.\n\nBut I find that it usually is not my search\n\nto find something, it's reading something\n\nand being surprised.\n\nAs time goes on, it gets harder and harder\n\nto, I think, to get surprised but they're still out there\n\nand it's still as exciting as hell\n\nwhen you find something where you're like oh,\n\nthat would be fun.\n\n[upbeat music]"
