        "text": "The Hickman parents of Trabuco Canyon reviewed “Flash of Genius,” starring Greg Kinnear, Alan Alda and Lauren Graham. Rated PG-13 for brief strong language.\n\nRandy Hickman, Dad\n\nGrade: A-\n\nSuperb.This was the best intermittent wiper movie I’ve ever seen! Seriously, this movie had great character development and the acting was superb. It was a classic “little guy against the corporate giant”, but what made it great was the interplay between Professor Bob Kearns and his family. It made me think, when times are tough, how hard it can be at times for a couple to support each other.\n\nFavorite scene: During litigation when Bob Kearns is defending himself.\n\nLeast favorite scene: Didn’t have one.\n\nDru Ann Hickman, Mom\n\nGrade: B+\n\nExcellent.Greg Kinnear was fabulous as Professor Bob Kearns who invents the intermittent wiper system. It is a true story. I suspected it would be the predictable feel good story of the small guy versus the large corporation but it was more than that. The story showed how obsessed Bob Kearns became when Ford stole his idea and what it did to him personally. Alan Alda was also excellent as a lawyer who was trying to help Bob get justice but again, it is not a predictable sequence. This movie really leaves you wondering whether Bob did the right thing and I would recommend people see it. I would have given the movie an A except the editing was a little choppy. In addition, it took me a while to figure out that the first people that saw his invention were patent lawyers and not Ford executives.\n\nFavorite scene:When he is inventing the wiper system with his children."
