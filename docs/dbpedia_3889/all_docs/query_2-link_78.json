        "text": "\"We've decided that we need to make a change.\" AGC Studios + Catchlight Studios have revealed an official UK trailer for a kooky time travel comedy about a family called The Present, opening first in the UK in May this summer. Strangely his has no US date set yet, despite being a US film that should be on streaming by now. A brilliant boy discovers that he can manipulate time using a family heirloom - an old grandfather clock. He teams up with his siblings to return to the time of their parents' separation in hopes of changing the outcome and stopping them from getting divorced. Oy, well this all sounds a bit awkward... Actors Isla Fisher & Greg Kinnear star as the parents, with a cast including Ryan Guzman, Shay Rudolph, Amir Talai, Alphonso McAuley, Easton Rocket Sweda, Sarah Jane MacKay, & Mason Shea Joyce, with Eric Tiede. This looks really cheesy, like something made-for-TV to debut at primetime in the early 2000s.\n\nHere's the official UK trailer (+ UK quad poster) for Christian Ditter's The Present, from YouTube:"
