        "text": "Flash of Genius\n\nRate Movie\n\n[Total: 4 Average: 2.8]\n\nDirected By: Marc Abraham\n\nWritten By: Philip Railsback, John Seabrook\n\nRelease Date: October 3, 2008\n\nDomestic Distributor: Spyglass Entertainment (through Universal)\n\nCast: Greg Kinnear, Tim Eddis, Warren Belle\n\nBox Office Info:\n\nBudget: $20 million Financed by: Spyglass Entertainment Domestic Box Office: $4,442,377 Overseas Box Office: $360,576\n\nThe budget for Flash of Genius was $20 million and it was fully financed by Spyglass Entertainment. Spyglass also paid for the domestic P&A expenses and distributed the picture through Universal’s distribution arm. Veteran producer Marc Abraham made his directing debut with this true story about the man who invented the intermittent windshield wiper. Windshield wipers + no star power = flop.\n\nFlash of Genius was first dated for October 17 and then Universal moved it forward to October 3 and pushed The Express back a week to fill in the Oct 17 vacancy. Flash of Genius opened moderately wide in 1,098 theaters over a very crowded weekend that saw six other wide bows — Beverly Hills Chihuahua, Nick and Norah’s Infinite Playlist, Blindness, An American Carol, How to Lose Friends and Alienate People and Religulous.\n\nIt was lost in the market and pulled in a terrible $2,251,075 — placing outside the top 10 at #11. Flash of Genius sank 61.5% in its second weekend to $867,780 and was pulled from all theaters after only three weeks with a total of $4,442,377. Spyglass would see back about $2.4 million after theaters take their percentage of the gross, which leaves most of the P&A costs in the red and the budget at a loss.\n\nFlash of Genius received a fleeting theatrical release in a few countries overseas to just $360,576."
