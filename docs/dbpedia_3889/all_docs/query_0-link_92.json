        "text": "Detroit, in 1963, still had a certain optimism. Its Tigers had two rookie pitchers, Denny McLain and Mickey Lolich, who would soon help deliver a championship season, the team’s first since World War II. Population was near a peak, almost double today’s. And Robert Kearns, a 36-year-old engineer, actually believed that a little guy with a big idea could play ball with the automotive giants.\n\nKearns’ brilliant idea was the intermittent windshield wiper. It would swipe water away in a light rain, pause, then swipe again. That fall Kearns pulled up outside an engineering complex at Ford’s headquarters in Dearborn to demonstrate his invention, which he had installed in the family Galaxie.\n\nBut Ford proceeded to make the wipers without him. Kearns sued. And there began a personal, business and legal odyssey that has since warmed the hearts of spurned inventors, infuriated corporate lawyers and sent Marc Abraham, an affable film producer with a hankering to direct, on a mission to rival Kearns’ relentless quest for redress.\n\nThe resulting film, “Flash of Genius,” with Greg Kinnear in the lead role, opens Friday. Only weeks ago the studio shifted from an Oct. 17 opening that had put it opposite “W.,” the George W. Bush biographical picture from Oliver Stone.\n\nStone promises a seriocomic exploration of a well-born Everyman who grew up to become president. Abraham has learned that Everyman is a complicated beast, particularly when you push him too far.\n\n“When a person goes up against superior odds, he will definitely pay a price,” Abraham says. (Kearns died in 2005, having won his legal battle against both Ford and Chrysler, which also used the wipers, but losing his balance and much that was dear to him along the way.) “Look at Martin Luther King, Lawrence of Arabia and Gandhi.”\n\nMan on a mission\n\nKearns was no Gandhi, or even an Erin Brockovich. He fought for personal vindication, not his fellow man. A loving wife left him, exhausted by his obsession. Six children learned to cope with a father who at one point suffered a mental breakdown over his unfair treatment by the automakers.\n\nBut Abraham, by his own account, has been hooked for nine years on the notion of making a film — his first as a director — about Kearns, precisely because he was a thorny sort of hero. Frank Capra “wasn’t that easy either,” Abraham suggests, pointing to the dark edges around fondly remembered “little guy” dramas like “It’s a Wonderful Life” and “Meet John Doe.”\n\nMuch of the Kearns family eventually rallied around its patriarch, to become an ad hoc staff in the legal battle in which Kearns, who represented himself, ultimately enforced his patents and won more than $30 million from Ford and Chrysler. But he had repeatedly turned down settlements that might have paid him more, while pressing, largely in vain, for acknowledgment that he had been cheated by willful rather than inadvertent infringement.\n\nKearns was apparently driven by a deep-seated conviction that he was being deprived not just of money but of his very identity as an inventor. As that belief ripened into rage, he lost touch with his surroundings; at one point he hitchhiked to Washington and continued by bus to points south, convinced that Richard M. Nixon had commissioned him to build an electric car in Australia.\n\nBased on article\n\nIn carving a film from all of this, Philip Railsback (“The Stars Fell on Henrietta”) worked from a 1993 New Yorker article by John Seabrook, “The Flash of Genius,” and from interviews with Kearns and his kin.\n\nRailsback, who is credited as the script’s writer, died a few months after Kearns. Scott Frank (“The Interpreter”) revised the script, helping especially, Abraham says, to develop the story of Kearns’ relationship with his wife, Phyllis, who is played in the film by Lauren Graham (“Gilmore Girls”).\n\n“The real Bob Kearns was 10 times as paranoid, 10 times as difficult as Greg played him,” says Michael Lieber, a producer of the film. At first, Lieber says, he thought he was grappling with a simple David-and-Goliath story. After months on the telephone confronting Kearns’ suspicions about Hollywood’s intentions during a protracted negotiation over life rights, he knew better.\n\nKinnear says the “Flash” script, then called “The Windshield Wiper Man,” sat unread on his desk for weeks in 2006. “I thought it was the last superhero they could come up with, and it wouldn’t be for me,” he recalls, referring to a title that seemed to promise an action comedy of some sort. “It just seemed the most ludicrous thing.”\n\nBut he discovered what he now calls “an incredible connection” to, if not quite an understanding of, the screenplay’s protagonist.\n\n“I never felt as if I had a complete handle on him,” Kinnear says. “There’s a bit of a brittleness to him. Then, of course, there’s his tenacity, and all the stuff that made him a great character.”\n\nMuch will now depend on Kinnear. Since his days as the smart-alecky host of ”Talk Soup,” he has navigated the movie awards season in the past with unconventional pictures, once as an Oscar nominee for “As Good as It Gets,” with its curmudgeonly mix of laughs and tears, and more recently as part of the ensemble cast of ”Little Miss Sunshine,” another bittersweet effort that received a best-picture nomination.\n\nKinnear says he plans to take a lesson from “Flash of Genius” when it comes to the rough-and-tumble business of promoting the film. The studio is counting on reviews, publicity and, above all, good word-of-mouth for a film that will need more than billboards on buses to deliver its message.\n\n“I’ll be very Bob Kearns with it,” Kinnear says. ”I’ll do whatever it takes.”"
