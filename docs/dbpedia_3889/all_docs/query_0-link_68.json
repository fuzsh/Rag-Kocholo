Chandler gets on Joey's bad side when he lies about watching Joey's audition tape. Ross is up for a big grant, although Charlie's ex-boyfriend is in charge of who gets it. Dr. Hobart tries to trade--Ross breaks up with Charlie and he'll get the grant. Eventually, Charlie and Dr. Hobart reconcile after he reveals his feelings for her.\n\nGrouch Messing Machine\n\nElmo and Leela are doing laundry when suddenly the machine goes haywire!
