        "text": "Greg Kinnear (birthname: Gregory Buck Kinnear) is one of the most reliable and well-liked Hollywood actors in a wide range of mainstream movies, beginning his long movie career (after successful show biz start as a TV talk host) playing a talk-show host in the Mike Binder-directed superhero parody, Blankman (1994), starring Damon Wayans, David Alan Grier, Robin Givens, Jon Polito, and Jason Alexander, grossing a poor $8 million for Columbia Pictures. Kinnear was cast (to his great surprise) in his true acting role by director Sydney Pollack for his remake of Sabrina (1995), starring Harrison Ford, Julia Ormond, Nancy Marchand, and John Wood, and released by Paramount Pictures to $87 million global grosses.\n\nKinnear was cast by another major Hollywood director, Garry Marshall, for his first starring role in the comedy, Dear God (1996), co-starring Laurie Metcalf, Maria Pitillo, Tim Conway, Roscoe Lee Browne, Jon Seda, and Hector Elizondo, but losing money for Paramount with a low $7.1 million return against a $22 million budget. Kinnear confirmed his star status with rom-coms like A Smile Like Yours (1997), with Lauren Holly, Joan Cusack, Jay Thomas, Jill Hennessy, and Christopher McDonald, under co-writer Keith Samples’s direction, but proving to be another money-loser for Paramount.\n\nGreg Kinnear earned an Oscar nomination for best-supporting actor with best actor/actress Oscar-winners Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt in Kinnear’s most lauded performance to date in filmmaker James L. Brooks’s romantic comedy-drama, As Good as it Gets (1997), with Cuba Gooding Jr., Skeet Ulrich, and Shirley Knight, grossing a hefty $314 million global return for TriStar Pictures/Gracie Films/Sony Pictures Releasing. Kinnear teamed up with another comedy master, co-writer/director Nora Ephron, for the acclaimed rom-com hit (grossing $251 million for Warner Bros.), You’ve Got Mail (1998), co-starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, and with Parker Posey, Jean Stapleton, Dave Chappelle, and Steve Zahn.\n\nKinnear co-starred in one of his few superhero movies, Mystery Men (1999), directed by Kinka Usher and co-starring Ben Stiller, Hank Azaria, William H. Macy, Claire Forlani, Janeane Garofalo, Eddie Izzard, William H. Macy, Lena Olin, Paul Reubens, Geoffrey Rush, Wes Studi, and Tom Waits, but which bombed at the box office for Universal Pictures with a $33.5 million global return. Kinnear was cast by legendary filmmaker Mike Nichols for the comedy, What Planet Are You From? (2000), with Garry Shandling (who produced with Nichols), Annette Bening, Ben Kingsley, Linda Fiorentino, and John Goodman, but drawing poor box office with a $14 million gross.\n\nGreg Kinnear joined up with another major director, Neil LaBute, alongside co-stars Renée Zellweger, Morgan Freeman, and Chris Rock in the black comedy, Nurse Betty (2000), with Aaron Eckhart, Crispin Glover, and Pruitt Taylor Vince, and was released by USA Films/Summit Entertainment after a Cannes film festival premiere, where it won the best screenplay, Palme. Kinnear was cast in a co-starring role by director/writer/producer Amy Heckerling in the comedy, Loser (2000), starring Jason Biggs, Mena Suvari, Dan Aykroyd, Andrea Martin, and Alan Cumming, and grossing $18.4 million for Columbia Pictures/Sony Pictures Releasing.\n\nKinnear co-starred with Cate Blanchett, Giovanni Ribisi, Keanu Reeves, Katie Holmes, and Hilary Swank under Sam Raimi’s direction in the paranormal thriller, The Gift (2000), written by Billy Bob Thornton and Tom Epperson, and grossing a strong $44.6 million global gross for Lakeshore Entertainment/Paramount Classics. Kinnear returned to familiar rom-com territory under Tony Goldwyn’s direction for Someone Like You (2001), starring Ashley Judd, Hugh Jackman, Marisa Tomei, and Ellen Barkin, earning $38.6 million for 20th Century Fox.\n\nGreg Kinnear took on heavier drama under writer Randall Wallace’s direction for Vietnam war-themed We Were Soldiers (2002), starring Mel Gibson, Madeleine Stowe, Sam Elliott, Chris Klein, Keri Russell, and Barry Pepper, and which grossed $115.4 million for the US/German/French co-production and distributors Paramount and Concorde Filmverleih. Kinnear collaborated with another major American filmmaker—Paul Schrader—for his intense portrayal of actor Bob Crane in the extremely dark drama, Auto Focus (2002), based on Robert Graysmith’s 1993 book, The Murder of Bob Crane, co-starring Willem Dafoe, Rita Wilson, Maria Bello, and Ron Liebman, and grossing a mild $2.7 million for Sony Pictures Classics.\n\nKinnear joined forces with another Hollywood comedy powerhouse with brother filmmakers Peter and Bobby Farrelly for Stuck on You (2003), in which he co-starred with Matt Damon, and which featured Eva Mendes, Seymour Cassel, and Cher, grossing an underwhelming $66 million (on a $55 million budget) for 20th Century Fox.

Kinnear reunited with director/co-writer Linklater for the striking, non-fiction-based chronicle, Fast Food Nation (2006), adapted from co-screenwriter Eric Schlosser’s book, with the diverse ensemble of Patricia Arquette, Luis Guzman, Ethan Hawke, Ashley Johnson, Kris Kristofferson, Catalina Sandino Moreno, Ana Claudia Talancon, Wilmer Valderrama, Bobby Cannavale, and Paul Dano, and released to strong reviews in the US by Fox Searchlight Pictures.\n\nGreg Kinnear was a co-lead in one of the most successful American indie movies of the early 21st century, the Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris co-directed road comedy, Little Miss Sunshine (2006), co-starring Steve Carell, Toni Collette, Paul Dano, Abigail Breslin, and Alan Arkin, and earning a knockout $101 million global gross (against an $8 million budget) after premiering at the Sundance film festival and eventually scoring two Oscar wins (best original screenplay for Michael Arndt and best supporting actor for Arkin). Kinnear portrayed Philadelphia Eagles coach Dick Vermeil in the Disney sports drama, Invincible (2006), co-starring Mark Wahlberg, Elizabeth Banks, and Michael Rispoli, and grossing $58.5 million worldwide.\n\nKinnear joined fellow cast mates Jim Caviezel, Joe Pantoliano, Barry Pepper, Jeremy Sisto, and Peter Stormare in the intense thriller, Unknown (2006), directed by Simon Brand and released to modest box office by IFC First Take and The Weinstein Company.

Kinnear then co-starred in director/co-writer David Koepp’s fantasy comedy, Ghost Town (2008), co-starring Ricky Gervais, Téa Leoni, Billy Campbell, Kristen Wiig, and grossing $27 million for DreamWorks Pictures/Paramount Distribution.\n\nKinnear led a cast including Lauren Graham, Dermot Mulroney, and Alan Alda, in the true man-against-corporation drama, Flash of Genius (2008), directed by Marc Abraham and based on John Seabrook’s New Yorker article, which lost money for Spyglass Entertainment/Universal Pictures with a poor $4.8 million against $20 million cost.
