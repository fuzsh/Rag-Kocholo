        "text": "With the NFL and college football underway I thought I might as well do the exact same thing I did at the start of the baseball season. This week’s Phenomenal 5 will be looking at football movies. This was an interesting list to put together and when the final cut was made, I was surprised to see the variety (something I aim for with these lists). So here they are, five football movies that I thoroughly enjoyed. Now I know there are a few popular ones that didn’t make it therefore I wouldn’t call this the definitive list. But there’s no questioning that these five football films are certainly phenomenal.\n\n#5 – “INVINCIBLE”\n\nThis 2006 football picture is based on the unlikely true story of Vince Papale, a down-on-his-luck bartender who is encouraged to participate in an open tryout for the Philadelphia Eagles. Mark Wahlberg plays Vince who catches the attention of Eagles coach Dick Vermeil (Greg Kinnear). Obviously he makes the team or we wouldn’t have a story but at its heart this is a fun movie for football fans. While Kinnear doesn’t quite make me think of Dick Vermeil, Wahlberg is a lot of fun and “Invincible” is a movie I still enjoy.\n\n#4 – “THE PROGRAM”\n\n“The Program” is certainly a movie with its share of flaws but it’s still one that strikes a chord with many football fans. This movie takes an edgy look at college football through the fictional ESU Timberwolves. It looks at academic fraud, steroids, Heisman pressures, and even ventures into troubled kids dealing with split families and alcoholic fathers. I completely admit that “The Program” tries to do too many things and the writing is sometimes silly. But this is a compelling look at the NCAA program and James Caan is excellent as the head coach trying to balance it all. “The Program” is just a solid football movie, flaws and all.\n\n#3 – “RUDY”\n\n“Rudy” is one sports movie that almost everyone is familiar with. It’s the story of Rudy Ruettiger (Sean Astin), a college kid who is small in size but with a huge heart. He has a dream of playing football for the University of Notre Dame. He first has to overcome the hurdle of being admitted to the university and then he has to make his way onto the practice squad by impressing his coach with his determination and effort. Against all odds, Rudy finds himself not only dressing out for the final home game of the season, but playing to the chants of “Rudy, Rudy”. It’s an utter feel good movie but it’s also a classic football film..\n\n#2 – “THE FRESHMAN”\n\nIf you haven’t seen this 1925 silent movie gem you’re missing a real treasure. The great Harold Lloyd plays an enthusiastic but clueless young man who is entering his freshman year at Tate College. To gain popularity with the college crowd and with a young girl that’s caught his eye, Harold decides to join the university’s football team. He goes from being the team’s tackling dummy (literally) to water boy to football hero. It’s a charming and often times hilarious story. Lloyd is great and I’ll never forget the little jig he does as a greeting. Watch the movie and you’ll know exactly what I mean.\n\n#1 – “BRIAN’S SONG”\n\n“Brian’s Song” is amazing for several reasons. First, it wasn’t initially a theatrical release. This ABC Movie of the Week from 1971 tells the story of the friendship between the chatty, wise-cracking Joe Piccolo (James Caan) and the shy, reserved Gale Sayers (Billy Dee Williams). Both are competitors for the same position on the Chicago Bears and their unlikely friendship grows even amid racial tensions and career threatening injuries. Things do turn weepy at the end but it works thanks to the wonderful relationship we watch unfold both on and off the football field. Caan and Williams give really good performances and that helps make this a great football film.\n\nThere you go – 5 Phenomenal Football Movies. I know of several that I’m sure some would put on their list. So what about you? What’s your favorite football film?"
