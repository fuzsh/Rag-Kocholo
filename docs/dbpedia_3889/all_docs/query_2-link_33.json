        "text": "Greg Kinnear is a likeable actor who gravitates towards playing feckless and unlikeable people — the kind of simpering people whose lives are just waiting to be flattened by a steamroller, or already have. The only difference with “Phil,” his cloying and contrived directorial debut, is that Kinnear is both in front of the camera and behind the wheel; it’s like a slow-motion hit-and-run where the victim and the suspect are somehow the same man. As a feat of masochism, “Phil” is an impressive trick. As a movie, it’s a ghastly mess.\n\nIt’s immediately apparent why Kinnear was drawn to Stephen Mazur’s (“Liar Liar”) script, which hinges on a humdinger of a mistaken-identity premise that feels like it was hatched…\n\nHoo boy---\n\nUh, well--it seems to be a collective decision to bury this movie as not to mar the reputations of some pretty talented people as less than 250 people have it viewed on LB.\n\nSo, the plot is that Greg Kinnear is depressed and contemplating suicide, he meets Bradley Whitford, a man who has it all! and starts stalking him and then stumbles onto his suicide, becomes obsessed with figuring out why he did it and in doing so upends his own life by pretending to be a Greek man from Bradley Whitford's past to infiltrate the lives of his loved ones.\n\nIt's fucked. The script is wildly convenient, the tone is never set. The solitary star I'll give…\n\nYeah, I don’t know.\n\nI really like Greg Kinnear as an actor and I wanted to check out his directorial debut. It’s bizarre — and a pretty huge red flag — that a movie with so many talented people involved has gone almost completely unseen. Not just the great cast and the fact that it’s a famous actor-turned-director, but even down to the producers, composer, and cinematographer, who’ve been behind a ton of successful and popular movies.\n\nIt started off promising, especially the opening scene. If the first scene was a short film, I’d give it a solid 8/10. But it takes a bafflingly strange turn and evolves into a tedious, overlong comedy skit. I still don’t understand what Kinnear’s…\n\nOf the one hundred directions Mr. Kinnear could have taken the concept of PHIL, a suicidal dentist who finds meaning in existence while examining the suicide of a patient with a seemingly perfect life, the direction he chose is easily in the bottom tenth percentile.\n\nWhile the premise is sound, and not every choice is terrible, the missed opportunities are frequent and enormous. Rather than make any kind of statement, he chose to make something that more closely resembles a rom com, though without any rom and not enough com.\n\nWeirder still is how it feels kind of like a vanity project, which begs the question, why is it so blah? If this was his baby, surely he sought out…\n\nAs a Greek myself, I was slightly offended by the accent (even though I've lived in the UK for five years and spoken English since I was 10, I still feel my Greek tone is breaking in, yet this film made it look way too ridiculous), but this wasn't the worst part of the movie by any means.\n\nThe plot. It was the plot. Hilariously nonexistent. Greg Kinnear is a fantastic comedian in my opinion, he's just unlucky/unwise enough to choose better scripts and themes. This story was all over the place, it provided zero to... zero answers and the jokes were more offending than thought-provoking. The lighting and editing were nicely executed, though, and some of the supporting actors…"
