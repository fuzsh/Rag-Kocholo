I'm Dave Davies, senior writer for the Philadelphia Daily\n\nNews, sitting in for Terry Gross.\n\nJust about every week on FRESH AIR our book critic Maureen Corrigan leads us\n\nto a novel or work of nonfiction she thinks is worthy of our time. Her\n\nreviews are so interesting and well crafted that many listeners weren't\n\nsurprised in 2005 when Maureen published her first book. It's called \"Leave\n\nMe Alone, I'm Reading: Finding and Losing Myself in Books,\" and it's now out\n\nin paperback. It's about her life as an obsessive reader. She writes: \"My\n\nown book is my attempt to figure out some of the consequences of my prolonged\n\nexposure to books and to explore how reading has transformed my life mostly\n\nfor the better, sometimes for the worse.\"\n\nIn addition to her work on our show, Maureen writes a mystery column for The\n\nWashington Post and teaches literature at Georgetown University. Maureen\n\nspoke to Terry when \"Leave Me Alone, I'm Reading\" was first published. She\n\nbegan with a reading.\n\nMs. MAUREEN CORRIGAN: \"The roots of my own yearning to read are easy enough\n\nto trace. I was a shy kid, an only child who grew up in a two-bedroom walk-up\n\napartment in Queens. Reading offered companionship as well as escape. It\n\nalso gave me a way to be more like my dad whom I adored. Every weeknight\n\nafter he came home from his job as a refrigeration mechanic and ate supper, my\n\ndad would go to his bedroom and read. Mostly he read adventure novels about\n\nWorld War II. He had served first in the Merchant Marine and then after Pearl\n\nHarbor in the Navy on a destroyer escort. Those Navy years were the most\n\nintense of my father's life although he never said so. My dad belonged to\n\nthat generation of men forged by the Great Depression and World War II whose\n\nunspoken motto was, `The deeper the feeling, the fewer the words.' He didn't\n\ntalk a lot about the war but I knew it haunted his memory because every night\n\nhe cracked open a paperback, usually one with an embossed swastika on its\n\ncover, and sat smoking and reading. Near his chair was a framed photograph of\n\nhis ship, the USS Schmidt. To read was to be like my dad and maybe to get a\n\nglimpse of his experience, to me as wide and unfathomable as the sea.\n\nMy mom, on the other hand, would rather try to talk to just about\n\nanybody--Minnie Mouse, Alan Greenspan--than read a book. She used to grow\n\nrestless on those long ago evenings when my dad and I would be lost in our\n\nseparate fictional worlds. Because she knew better than to bother him, she'd\n\ninvariably sidle up to me and complain that I was ruining my eyes by reading\n\nin the perfectly adequate light of the living room lamp. Or she'd feel my\n\nhead and tell me that I was getting bumps from too much reading. Sometimes\n\nI'd give in and watch TV with her for a while but at some point I'd always\n\npick up my book again, leaving her, as she'd complained, all alone. My poor\n\nmother. How did she get stuck with the two us reader loners for company?\"\n\nTERRY GROSS, host:\n\nThat's Maureen Corrigan reading from her new memoir \"Leave Me Alone, I'm\n\nReading.\"\n\nMaureen, congratulations on the book.\n\nMs. CORRIGAN: Thank you, Terry.\n\nGROSS: You know, reading that I was really wondering, did you get mixed\n\nmessages about reading when you were growing up? On the one hand, it's good\n\nfor you, you know, reading is good for you. You have to learn to be a smart\n\ngirl. But on the other hand, it's anti-social. Put down the book and talk to\n\nyour family. Put down the book when we're visiting relatives.\n\nMs. CORRIGAN: Yeah, I definitely got mixed messages. I think, you know, for\n\na lot of women we're supposed to be the connectors. We're supposed to be the\n\nsocializers. We're not supposed to be the people in the family who isolate\n\nourselves and sit alone in a room and read. My mother definitely saw too much\n\nreading as a sign of trouble and almost like a personality disorder. What was\n\nthe matter with me? Why didn't I get out more and talk to people? And, you\n\nknow, for my mother reading is just a mystery. She is one of those\n\npeople--and there are a lot of people out there like this--who just can't\n\nrespond to books. She doesn't get their magic. She doesn't understand why\n\nsomeone would want to spend hours lost in a book.\n\nMy dad, on the other hand, would have been quite happy, I think, to spend most\n\nof his life sitting in his bedroom, as I say, smoking and reading and, you\n\nknow, coming up for air once in a while. He wasn't a misanthrope, but to him\n\nthere was no greater pleasure than to be a reader.\n\nGROSS: Now you write in your book that you realize there's a certain risk of\n\nreading, that it can make you estranged from real life. What do you mean by\n\nthat?\n\nMs. CORRIGAN: You know, we hear so much about reading as being beneficial,\n\nand, of course, I'm not going to argue with that. Reading is one of the\n\ngreatest pleasures of my life and it's opened up worlds to me. But I do think\n\nthere is a risk to reading and that, especially for those of us who get\n\ncarried away by stories, and that possibly--and certainly for me this was the\n\ncase--that it intensifies our own passivity. I know that there have been\n\nperiods in my life where I've sort of sat back and waited to be rescued or,\n\nyou know, waited for some kind of author god to write a better script for\n\nwhatever was going on in my life at the moment. And I think that, you know,\n\ngetting lost in books as a refuge is sometimes a way not to deal with life.\n\nAnd, again, I think I've experienced that, that books were a great place to\n\nhide out when things weren't going so well for me in the real world.\n\nGROSS: One of the things you've done is gone back to some of the books that\n\nyou read as a girl when you were in Catholic school. And one of those books\n\nwas called \"The Brooklyn Catholic Reader.\" Would you describe this book.\n\nMs. CORRIGAN: \"The Brooklyn Catholic Reader\" is--wow, it's a great time\n\ncapsule of pre-Vatican II Catholicism. First of all, the pub date on \"The\n\nBrooklyn Catholic Reader\" is 1939, and I was in Catholic grammar school in the\n\n'60s, pre- and post-Vatican II. So it's a little scary to think of, you know,\n\nwhat the resources of my little Catholic school were in Queens that we were\n\nstill reading something published in 1939. It's filled with poems, short\n\nstories all with a message of `Suck it up,' you know, `stiff upper lip, don't\n\ncomplain.' To be a whiner was to endanger your soul and to not be a complainer\n\nwas to be considered, you know, closer to God, closer to heaven. And so all\n\nof these stories and poems preach against pridefulness and having too much\n\nego, thinking too much of yourself. And that was definitely the message that\n\nI got growing up--not only from Catholic school but coming from a working\n\nclass background. You know, who do you think you are? Don't walk around\n\nthinking that you're somebody with a capital S.\n\nYou know, Terry Eagleton wrote, I think, a great little autobiography a couple\n\nof years ago called \"The Gatekeeper.\" And for those of you who don't know who\n\nhe is, he's a very prominent British literary critic and scholar. And\n\nEagleton also comes from a working class background in England, an Irish\n\nCatholic one. And he, for me, crystallized that attitude when he described\n\nthe tombstone that he could imagine his family adopting when they all passed\n\naway. And on the tombstone he said the slogan would be written `We didn't\n\ncause too much trouble.' I mean, that's sort of, you know, the attitude of not\n\ncausing too much trouble, not asking for too much. And I have mixed feelings\n\nabout that attitude because these days I feel like I spend way too much time\n\nwith people who think way too much of themselves, you know. And so there's\n\nsomething to me endearing and admirable about self-deprecation and not putting\n\nyourself forward but it also can be damaging.\n\nGROSS: Well, how do you think it affected you as a girl who was already shy,\n\nand was probably already a bit unsure of yourself, a little insecure...\n\nMs. CORRIGAN: Mm-hm.\n\nGROSS: ...so--to constantly get this message in literature that, you know,\n\nwho do you think you are?\n\nMs. CORRIGAN: Yeah, yeah, who do you think...\n\nGROSS: Don't inconvenience anybody with your presence. How do you think that\n\nhelped shape you?\n\nMs. CORRIGAN: Oh, gosh. I think, first of all, it gave me the comforting\n\nsense, in a way, that somebody was always watching, somebody with a capital S,\n\nyou know, a divine somebody. So that no matter how alone I felt or how much\n\nof in a jam I might be I did have that sense that a religious background gives\n\nyou that, you know, I was not alone. I think being shy and getting that\n\nmessage of not putting yourself forward probably set my career back as a\n\nwriter and as a scholar, I don't know, by years and years. You know, you\n\nlearn to kind of keep yourself in the background. And, you know, I think,\n\ntoo, as a teacher, as a reviewer, that's what I'm used to. I'm used to being\n\na handmaiden of literature. I'm used to especially cheering other people's\n\nbooks and so this situation of having, you know, finally written a book of my\n\nown and talking about my own book is weird and uncomfortable for me because\n\nI'm really used to promoting other people's works and I'm more comfortable\n\ndoing that.\n\nGROSS: A lot of the early reading you did, back when you were in Catholic\n\nschool, was about the lives of the saints and martyrs...\n\nMs. CORRIGAN: Mm.\n\nGROSS: ...and these are stories that often involve violent, bloody death and,\n\nas you put it, for the women these stories are often about trying to defend\n\nvirginity at all costs. Were these stories appealing to you? Did you--and\n\nwere they frightening to you?\n\nMs. CORRIGAN: I remember loving the lives of the saints stories whenever we\n\ngot to them in religion class. You know, the life of Christ we all knew it,\n\nand, you know, we went to mass every Sunday. We were familiar with the gospel\n\nstories. The lives of the saints, right, were gory. They were bloody. And\n\nthis business about virginity, I know this is going to sound just impossible\n\nprobably, especially to any listener under 30 out there, but I think it took\n\nme probably an extraordinarily long time to figure out what virginity was. I\n\nremember huddling with my best friend Mary Ellen Moore from St. Rayfields,\n\nwhich is the Catholic school we both went to, and we had gotten, you know, a\n\nbook out of the library, the local library, when we were both in about 7th\n\ngrade and it was a medical textbook. And we were looking at the male and\n\nfemale anatomy and, you know, the chapters on procreation and making faces and\n\nbeing appalled. I mean, we really didn't have a clue. My mother explained\n\nmenstruation to me by saying that this was the way your body got rid of bad\n\nblood. So I thought everybody menstruated, you know. And this was at age 13.\n\nSo, you know, it's uncomfortable to admit that but I think coming from that\n\nCatholic background where we were still growing out of the changes in\n\nVatican--that Vatican II wrought, and the sexual revolution certainly didn't\n\nhit my corner of Queens until probably the mid-'70's. I think we were still\n\ngrowing up more like probably kids grew up in the '40s and '50s than in the\n\nswinging '60s.\n\nDAVIES: Book critic Maureen Corrigan speaking with Terry Gross. We'll hear\n\nmore after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Announcements)\n\nDAVIES: Let's get back to Terry's interview with our book critic Maureen\n\nCorrigan. Her own book \"Leave Me Alone, I'm Reading\" has just come out in\n\npaperback.\n\nGROSS: Now, you've talked about how, in some ways, you think reading\n\nencourages passivity and how some of the early Catholic literature you were\n\nexposed to kind of reinforced your shyness. At the same time you loved Nancy\n\nDrew books and, you know, here's like a heroine who is assertive. I mean,\n\nshe's solving mysteries. She's putting her life in danger to solve those\n\nmysteries. What appealed to you about Nancy Drew books?\n\nMs. CORRIGAN: Well, first of all, I loved the trappings of the Nancy Drew\n\nbooks. When I opened up Nancy Drew--and I vividly remember getting my first\n\nNancy Drew. I was eight years old. It was Christmas, \"The Secret of the Old\n\nClock\" was in my Christmas stocking. When I opened up those books I became\n\nNancy Drew of River Heights with the patrician lawyer father and with Hannah\n\nGruen the loyal what--what do you want to call--a housekeeper who kept\n\neverything in order and with the two adoring sidekick friends. So, you know,\n\npart of the great appeal of those books for me was that Nancy was always\n\ndressed appropriately. She always knew what to say. Absolutely she could\n\nhold her own against thugs and jewel thieves, but it was--for me I think it\n\nwas more the social ease that those books conveyed, that it was just a great\n\nfantasy for me to be so on top of your own world.\n\nGROSS: You loved the Nancy Drew books as a girl and then as a woman you fell\n\nin love with hard-boiled fiction and you fell in love with that while you were\n\nin graduate school studying literature.\n\nMs. CORRIGAN: Mm-hmm.\n\nGROSS: Why is it that when you were studying literature and going for a\n\ngraduate degree did you fall in love with just the kind of book that probably\n\nwouldn't be studied at that point in time in graduate school?\n\nMs. CORRIGAN: Yes.\n\nGROSS: I mean, you'd teach courses on detective fiction now, but I don't\n\nthink that there were such courses when you were studying.\n\nMs. CORRIGAN: No, when I was--when I began graduate school in the mid-'70s\n\nthe kind of--the cultural studies tsunami was just starting to hit grad school\n\nprograms. So, no, definitely you wouldn't talk about detective fiction. I\n\nwas doing a dissertation on 19th century nonfictional prose writers, social\n\ncritics like John Ruskin and Thomas Carlyle and William Morris. And really\n\nfor diversion one night I opened up a paperback of Dashiell Hammett's \"Red\n\nHarvest.\" And somebody had recommended it to me. They said I might like it\n\nand I saw that the plot had to do with something about union busting. And\n\nsince my dad had been a shop steward almost all his working life, I kind of\n\nthought, `Well, maybe I'll be interested in this.' And I started to read \"The\n\nRed Harvest.\" It's narrated by one of Hammett's detectives called the\n\nContinental Op and I fell in love with the voice, the voice is a tough,\n\nworking class voice that was the kind of voice I wasn't hearing in graduate\n\nschool.\n\nAnd it's not as though I'm--you know, I'm not a big fan of identity politics\n\nin literature. I don't think that we're just attracted to stories that are\n\nabout us or sound like people we know. I think that's a really limiting way\n\nto regard literature. But I was so starved for the kind of voice I would have\n\nheard around my old neighborhood in Queens--you know, trapped as I was in this\n\nelite graduate school program--that I really began to fall in love with\n\nhard-boiled American detective fiction. And then I began to see some\n\nconnections between the British--19th century British writers I was studying\n\nand people like Hammett and Chandler who, you know, in Chandler's immortal\n\nphrase, `We're investigating a world gone wrong.' That's what these social\n\ncritics in the 19th century were doing. So I really began to feel like there\n\nwas more to detective fiction than, you know, than meets the eye, than people\n\nhad usually credited the form with.\n\nGROSS: Now one might think that you were in heaven going to graduate school\n\nto study literature, but it sounds from your memoir that you were not in\n\nheaven at all. You felt terribly uncomfortable. You say at your first\n\nacademic dinner party you were drenched in self-loathing. What was so\n\noff-putting about graduate school for you?\n\nMs. CORRIGAN: I think I came to grad school with a lot of expectations that\n\nwere probably impossible to meet. I think I imagined graduate school the way\n\npeople talk about their reading groups, you know, as this great community of\n\nlike-minded readers who I would spend years with and we would talk about books\n\nand it would just be heaven. And it wasn't. I was accepted into the grad\n\nprogram at the University of Pennsylvania in 1977. And when I arrived at Penn\n\nI went to my first sherry hour that the English department hosted, and there\n\nwere a lot of these kind of Oxbridge customs around the place, one of them\n\nbeing a sherry hour. And I was--at the sherry hour one of the professors I\n\nwas working with got up and announced to all of us first-year students that\n\nnone of us would ever be as brilliant as Ira Einhorn.\n\nAnd, again, for the non-Philadelphia listeners out there, Ira Einhorn was\n\nprobably one of the most famous characters to emerge out of Philadelphia in\n\nthe '70s. He was a kind of a New Age celebrity. He had been earlier a\n\nfixture in the new left in Philadelphia. In 1977 his girlfriend, Holly\n\nMaddux, had disappeared and Einhorn was fingered as the number one suspect in\n\nher disappearance. Two years later, her decomposed body was found in a trunk\n\nin Einhorn's West Philadelphia apartment. And he eventually skipped bail and\n\nwent on the run for 20 years all over Europe.\n\nSo when I got to Penn to hear that none of us would ever be as brilliant as\n\nIra Einhorn who was, as I said, just the number suspect in this poor girl's\n\ndisappearance, it should have told me a few things. I mean, it should\n\nhave--that announcement should have told me that, first of all, men really\n\nmattered more than women, you know, here was this brilliant man and, well, his\n\ngirlfriend had disappeared but who cared about her. He was the one who\n\nmattered. And then secondly, that really brilliance was really the only value\n\nin this kind of amoral universe I had entered--brilliance or the appearance of\n\nbrilliance. And that's why Einhorn was still celebrated at Penn when I got\n\nthere.\n\nGROSS: So did things ever get better for you in graduate school?\n\nMs. CORRIGAN: Things got better when I left. You know, graduate school is\n\nmiserable for a lot of people. It's a lonely experience. You're mostly on\n\nyour own reading and writing and you're constantly trying to prove yourself,\n\nand you're a student way beyond probably the age when you should still be a\n\nstudent. And in my case I was competing for jobs as an English--a literature\n\nscholar in an ever-shrinking job market. So it was an atmosphere filled with\n\nanxiety.\n\nEventually deliverance came in the form of a friend who had landed a job at\n\nThe Village Voice literary supplement and she said to me, `Would you like to\n\ntry to write a review?' And I said, `Yes.' And wow, the idea of writing about\n\nliterature in a way that was accessible to an informed, but not a scholarly\n\naudience, that just--that idea just energized me. So I eventually finished my\n\ndissertation and got out of Penn but I also found this other way of talking\n\nabout books that was much more congenial.\n\nGROSS: Maureen, thanks so much for talking with us and congratulations on the\n\nbook.\n\nMs. CORRIGAN: Thank you very much, Terry.\n\nDAVIES: FRESH AIR book critic Maureen Corrigan speaking with Terry Gross.\n\nShe teaches literature at Georgetown University. Her book \"Leave Me Alone,\n\nI'm Reading\" has just come out in paperback. I'm Dave Davies and this is\n\nFRESH AIR.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nInterview: Actor Greg Kinnear discusses his career and movies\n\nDAVE DAVIES, host:\n\nThis is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave DAVIES, filling in for Terry Gross.\n\nMy guest Greg Kinnear didn't get into acting until he was 31, after he'd\n\nhosted a late-night TV talk show and an E! program called \"Talk Soup.\" But he\n\nsoon delivered an Oscar-nominated performance as Jack Nicholson's gay neighbor\n\nin the film \"As Good As It Gets,\" and found there was plenty of work for him\n\nin Hollywood.\n\nA review from the Times of London said that while he often played the straight\n\nman in films, Kinnear, \"through his unconventional depiction of the ordinary\n\nwas matching his flashier co-stars shot for shot, line for line.\" Kinnear's\n\nfilms include \"Auto Focus,\" \"Nurse Betty,\" \"Stuck on You,\" and the hit \"Little\n\nMiss Sunshine.\" Kinnear shared a Critics Choice Award for best acting ensemble\n\nfor his performance in the film, which is now out on DVD.\n\nKinnear also stared in \"Fast Food Nation,\" a dramatization of Eric Schlosser's\n\nbook about the fast-food and meat-packing industries. In the film he plays a\n\nnew marketing executive for a fast-food franchise called Mickey's. In this\n\nclip he's at the company's lab smelling renderings of some new artificial\n\nflavors.\n\n(Soundbite from \"Fast Food Nation\")\n\nMr. GREG KINNEAR: (As Don Anderson) That's wonderful.\n\nUnidentified Actor: Yeah, you like that. That's the Barbecued Big One.\n\nMr. KINNEAR: (As Don Anderson) Wow, it tastes like it's right off the grill!\n\nActor: You don't think it needs like liquid smoke or any other kind of\n\nflavorings?\n\nMr. KINNEAR: (As Don Anderson) No, no, no, no. I think it's perfect. Let's\n\ntest that.\n\nActor: OK. Try this one.\n\nMr. KINNEAR: (As Don Anderson) I don't know.\n\nActor: Yeah, I mean these Caribbean seasonings are kind of tricky.\n\nMr. KINNEAR: (As Don Anderson) Well, we're calling them Calypso Chicken\n\nTenders. I think people are going to have an expectation for maybe a touch of\n\nlime.\n\nActor: Oh, lime. Lime's easy. I just held back on the terpinolene on this\n\nto keep the flavoring subtle, but I can always go back and add more.\n\nMr. KINNEAR: (As Don Anderson) Yeah, why don't you try that?\n\nActor: I'll keep working on it.\n\n(End of soundbite)\n\nDAVIES: Greg Kinnear and many in the cast of \"Fast Food Nation\" visited\n\nmeat-packing plants and shot some scenes there. I asked him what he saw that\n\nsurprised him.\n\nMr. KINNEAR: Well, the first thing I was surprised at was the sort of covert\n\nnature that the production was being operated under. We had gone under a\n\nfictitious production name. Instead of going by \"Fast Food Nation,\" we went\n\nas \"Coyote,\" and that was because, I believe, Eric doesn't have a lot of fans\n\nin the meat-packing industry, and they control and obviously have total\n\ncontrol over a lot of the warehouses and the slaughterhouses where we wanted\n\nto get access to. So that caused us to head south of the border, and they\n\nmanaged to secure a plant about 400, 300 miles south of El Paso, in an area of\n\nChihuahua, and we went down there and used those facilities.\n\nDAVIES: So you were in a Mexican meat-packing plant. Did the folks running\n\nthe plant know what the movie was about or what you were up to?\n\nMr. KINNEAR: Yeah, yeah. They did, and they were--I mean, they were\n\ncomfortable with it, comfortable enough that once we got down there, there was\n\nno secrecy about what it was we were doing. But they were, you know, really\n\ncooperative, and the truth is there are--and it's explained neatly in the\n\nmovie and it's explained in the book, you know, there's two different worlds\n\nin the meat world. I mean, there is the packing facilities where the beef is,\n\nyou know, frozen in huge, huge machines that I couldn't believe the size of\n\nthese things and so quickly. I mean, it's 40 below zero. This patty starts\n\nout as a little piece of ground beef and comes out just as a brick of, you\n\nknow, like a rock. And these facilities where, you know, the meat is ground\n\nand then frozen and then prepared to be shipped off are pretty clean, pretty\n\nimpressive operations. And, you know, Kris Kristofferson's character who's an\n\nold cattle rancher in the movie talks about, you know, talks to Don as he's\n\nsort of naively kind of going through this whole world and he says, `Did they\n\nshow you the kill floor?'\n\nDAVIES: Right.\n\nMr. KINNEAR: That's my Kris, by the way. It's not dubbed in.\n\nDAVIES: Not bad. Not bad.\n\nMr. KINNEAR: And I sort of naively say, `Well, no, they didn't.' He says,\n\n`They didn't show you anything.' And the truth is, you know, where those\n\ncattle are kept and the kill floor themselves are, you know, bloody, tough\n\nconditions, obviously.\n\nDAVIES: Well, Greg Kinnear, you're also starting in \"Little Miss Sunshine,\"\n\nwhich is this terrific story of this crazy, dysfunctional family in a VW bus\n\ntaking their daughter to a beauty pageant. We've got the grandfather, kicked\n\nout of the nursing home for snorting heroin; the teenage boy who's quit\n\ntalking; your brother-in-law, the Proust scholar who's recovering from a\n\nsuicide attempt. Well, let's hear a clip from the film. This is one where\n\nyou're on your way to--it's Los Angeles, I guess, for the beauty pageant.\n\nYou're driving...\n\nMr. KINNEAR: Yes.\n\nDAVIES: ...and your wife, Toni Collette, is there, and you're describing your\n\nhopes for becoming this very successful motivational author and speaker, and\n\nyou're talking about the guy who's going to promote your stuff, and you get\n\ninto a little thing with your brother-in-law who's in the backseat. He's\n\nplayed by Steve Carrell...\n\nMr. KINNEAR: Right.\n\nDAVIES: ...who's this brooding Proust scholar. Let's listen.\n\n(Soundbite from \"Little Miss Sunshine\")\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nMr. KINNEAR: (As Richard Hoover) So finally I'm just sitting there, and I\n\ndecide, you know, this is Stan Grossman, what the hell, and I start pitching\n\nhim the nine steps and about, I don't know, two minutes in, he stops me. He\n\nsays, `I can sell this.'\n\nMr. STEVE CARRELL: (As brother-in-law) Mm-hmm. Interesting.\n\nMr. KINNEAR: (As Richard Hoover) Yeah, and this is the guy who knows how to\n\ndo it, you know. You start with the book and then you do a media tour,\n\ncorporate events, DVD/VHS series. I mean, there's a whole fascinating science\n\ninto how you roll these things out.\n\nMr. CARRELL: (As brother-in-law) Wow!\n\nMr. KINNEAR: (As Richard Hoover) Yeah, so he's in Scottsdale right now, you\n\nknow...\n\nMr. CARRELL: (As brother-in-law) Ah!\n\nMr. KINNEAR: (As Richard Hoover) ...building the buzz and kind of getting\n\nthe whole pipe thing going. He's doing what the pros call a \"ticking-clock\n\nauction.\"\n\nMr. CARRELL: (As brother-in-law) Oh, how about that!\n\nMr. KINNEAR: (As Richard Hoover) Yeah, and I can detect that note of sarcasm\n\nthere, Frank.\n\nMr. CARRELL: (As brother-in-law) What sarcasm? I didn't, I didn't hear...\n\nMr. KINNEAR: (As Richard Hoover) But I want you to know something. I feel\n\nsorry for you.\n\nMr. CARRELL: (As brother-in-law) You do? Good.\n\nMr. KINNEAR: (As Richard Hoover) Yeah, I do. Because sarcasm is the refuge\n\nof losers.\n\nMr. CARRELL: (As brother-in-law) It is? Really?\n\nMr. KINNEAR: (As Richard Hoover) Yep. Sarcasm is losers trying to bring\n\nwinners down to their level, and that's step four in the program.\n\nMr. CARRELL: (As brother-in-law) Wow, Richard, you've really opened my eyes\n\nto what a loser I am! How much do I owe you for those pearls of wisdom?\n\nMr. KINNEAR: (As Richard Hoover) Oh, that one's on the house, buddy.\n\nMr. CARRELL: (As brother-in-law) It is?\n\nMs. TONI COLLETTE: (Sheryl Hoover) OK, you guys, that's enough.\n\nMr. KINNEAR: (As Richard Hoover) Yeah, it's on the house. That's on the\n\nhouse.\n\nMr. CARRELL: (As brother-in-law) Wow!\n\n(End of soundbite)\n\nDAVIES: And that's my guest Greg Kinnear, the motivational speaker there\n\narguing with his brother-in-law played by Steve Carrell in the new film\n\n\"Little Miss Sunshine.\"\n\nYou have all these wacky characters and this terrific cast with Alan Arkin and\n\nToni Collette and Paul Dano and Steve Carrell, and you, and then kind of a\n\nfulcrum in the middle of it is this 10-year-old actor Abigail Breslin, who\n\nplays the seven-year-old Olive. And I know that this was not a big budget\n\nfilm, and you had a 30-day shooting schedule, I believe.\n\nMr. KINNEAR: Yeah, 30 days with one day reshoot. So we really made it up\n\nall in a day.\n\nDAVIES: What's it like working with a child actor, who--I mean, did you have\n\nto develop a particularly close relationship with her?\n\nMr. KINNEAR: You know, I had a good relationship with Abigail immediately.\n\nI think anybody who would meet her would instantly warm to her. I mean, that\n\ncomes across on the screen, just that incredible humanity of hers. She is\n\nsuch a sweet girl. And a girl, by the way. You know, the amazing thing is\n\nthat her acting is so wonderful. She is such a, you know, has such a presence\n\non camera that you kind of lose sight--I mean, there were six of us. We'd be\n\nsitting around talking and, every once in a while, you'd glance over and\n\nAbigail would be, you know, munching down a Twinkie and playing with a yoyo,\n\nand you'd be like, `Oh, my God, that's right! She's nine.' And you would have\n\nto remind yourself because she just doesn't have the presence of a child.\n\nDAVIES: And the other interesting thing in a modest budget film like that is\n\nyou did have some action sequences here because one of the funny gags is that\n\nthe bus is semicrippled...\n\nMr. KINNEAR: Yeah.\n\nDAVIES: ...and you kind of have to push-start it every time. What was it\n\nlike shooting those sequences?\n\nMr. KINNEAR: Well, you know, of course, I was--I'm driving...\n\nDAVIES: Right.\n\nMr. KINNEAR: ...this old rickety 1969 bus, and we're not ever pushing it\n\nbecause they're heavy and they're hard to push. Note to those who think you\n\ncan push your VW bus is it takes more than three people--three or four people.\n\nSo I would actually have my foot on the accelerator and just try and get it up\n\nto enough speed to sell the joke that they were pushing it and that it wasn't\n\nbeing run by a motor, and, of course, the great fear was that I would\n\naccelerate too fast and that the people who had to then all jump on the bus\n\nwouldn't be able to jump on the bus.\n\nWe didn't have a big stunt coordinator budget on this movie as you can\n\nimagine, so somebody came up to me and whispered shortly before the first time\n\nwe tried this little trick, you know, `We think Abigail can go about three\n\nmiles an hour,' so take it easy on the speed.\n\nSo it was--more stress in this movie came from not ever acting--I never had a\n\nmoment where I was worried about that. It was all about driving, because we\n\ndidn't have the budget obviously to shut down freeways, and if you were\n\ndriving around LA on a freeway last summer, there's a hell of a good chance\n\nyou're in our movie, cause we were everywhere, and I was always behind the\n\nwheel.\n\nDAVIES: Actor Greg Kinnear.\n\nWe'll hear more after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Announcements)\n\nDAVIES: My guest is actor Greg Kinnear. His film \"Little Miss Sunshine\" has\n\njust come out on DVD.\n\nWell, I do want to talk about one of your films which is memorable to me.\n\nThat's \"Auto Focus,\" directed by Paul Schrader, which is this remarkable story\n\nof Bob Crane, who starred in \"Hogan's Heroes\" in the late '60s, and his life\n\nessentially unravels with a sexual addiction and this friendship with this\n\ncharacter John Carpenter, no relation to the film director, but who was his\n\npartner in scoring women, and Carpenter equipped him with videotaping\n\nequipment to capture his sexual exploits. You were the lead. You played Bob\n\nCrane. Tell us what appealed to you about this role and how you got into the\n\ncharacter.\n\nMr. KINNEAR: Well, I was very intrigued with the story. I mean, Bob\n\nCrane's, you know, sexual addiction was something that I was very unfamiliar\n\nwith and unaware, as I think a lot of people were. I knew him as Hogan and a\n\nkind of fun-loving presence on television, but the fact that he had that kind\n\nof sort of dual personality, you know, and those kind of underlying demons was\n\nobviously just interesting off the bat. And then there was a very dark,\n\nsubversive side to this relationship between Bob and Carpenter that started\n\nkind of fun and playful but, like all things, started to move into the area of\n\ngetting a little sordid.\n\nDAVIES: One of the many interesting and weird things about the Bob Crane\n\nstory is his family's kind of connection to--he is now dead. He was killed in\n\n1978.\n\nMr. KINNEAR: Right.\n\nDAVIES: But his son Bob Crane Jr. was a consultant on the film...\n\nMr. KINNEAR: That's right.\n\nDAVIES: ...and, in fact, has a cameo appearance, I believe, interviewing\n\nsomebody.\n\nMr. KINNEAR: He does. Me.\n\nDAVIES: You. That's right. That would be you. I'm just curious. Did you\n\ntalk--I'm sure you must have talked to him about his dad and...\n\nMr. KINNEAR: Yeah.\n\nDAVIES: How did he perceive...\n\nMr. KINNEAR: Well, he became aware of it in his latter years, and certainly\n\nwhen he was, you know, in high school and college, or, you know, right out of\n\nhigh school, he started to get a real sense of what a problem this was, and\n\nyou know, faced, you know, other kids who were aware of it. It was pretty\n\nmuch under wraps around Hollywood, but, you know, slowly started to come out a\n\nlittle bit. But, you know, Robert Crane Jr. he was, you know, he was a real\n\nhelpful guy, just in terms of giving me some sense of who exactly his dad was.\n\nHe had a lot of, you know, old, you know, tapes, not porn tapes but tapes of\n\nhis father performing and a few interviews and things that I thought were very\n\nrevealing from his early radio days, by the way. He was a big disc jockey out\n\nhere in Los Angeles, kind of the Rick Dees of his time at one point. And he,\n\nyou know, had that, again, that sort of ability to keep everything snappy and\n\nhappy. And the fact that, you know, these two people existed in him was\n\npretty amazing, and we needed that kind of insight along the way, and Robert\n\nhelped us with that.\n\nDAVIES: Well, you know, I wanted to play a clip from the film which captures\n\na moment in Bob Crane's life when he's really come unraveled and his career,\n\nwhich was really soaring when he did \"Hogan's Heroes,\" had descended to dinner\n\ntheater and was now at the point where the best gig he could get was going on\n\na show called \"Celebrity Cooks.\" And this is you as Bob Crane going on this\n\ncooking show and behaving badly, and I'll note, since it's not clear from the\n\naudio, that at some point in the scene we'll hear him notice a woman in the\n\nfirst row of the studio audience who has a very low-cut blouse. Let's hear\n\nthis cut from \"Auto Focus.\"\n\n(Soundbite from \"Auto Focus\")\n\nMr. JOHN KAPELOS: (As Bruno Gerussi) Welcome to \"Celebrity Cooks.\" My name\n\nis Bruno Gerussi.\n\n(Soundbite of applause)\n\nMr. KAPELOS: (As Bruno Gerussi) Today we'll be cooking with Colonel Hogan\n\nhimself, Mr. Bob Crane.\n\n(Soundbite of applause)\n\nMr. KINNEAR: (As Bob Crane) Thank you, Bruno. It's a pleasure to be here.\n\nMr. KAPELOS: (As Bruno Gerussi) Wonderful to see you. Now what has Hogan\n\nbeen up to?\n\nMr. KINNEAR: (As Bob Crane) Pretty much the same old thing. I'm still\n\ntrying to pull the wool over Klink's eyes...\n\n(Soundbite of laughter)\n\nMr. KINNEAR: (As Bob Crane) ...and trying to get into Hilda's pants.\n\nActually, I did get into her pants, I married her, but now she's divorcing me\n\nso...\n\nMr. KAPELOS: (As Bruno Gerussi) Oh.\n\nMr. KINNEAR: (As Bob Crane) ...that's not worked out, but I will be next\n\nmonth in Long Beach performing a show called \"Beginner's Luck.\"\n\nMr. KAPELOS: (As Bruno Gerussi) Wonderful. So, Bob, what recipe have you\n\nbrought us today.\n\nMr. KINNEAR: (As Bob Crane) It is a pasta dish...\n\nMr. KAPELOS: (As Bruno Gerussi) Mm-hmm.\n\nMr. KINNEAR: (As Bob Crane) ...with chicken...\n\nMr. KAPELOS: (As Bruno Gerussi) Mm-hmm.\n\nMr. KINNEAR: (As Bob Crane) ...and fettuccine, they tell me. I\n\ndon't--that's what they told me to say anyway.\n\nMr. KAPELOS: (As Bruno Gerussi) It sounds delicious.\n\nMr. KINNEAR: (As Bob Crane) You got a balloon smuggler here in the audience\n\ntoday. You got a license to carry those things? Here's a little tip on how\n\nto remove the wrinkles from your face, just take off your bra.\n\nStudio Audience: (In unison) Ahhh!\n\nUnidentified Woman: Oh, what?\n\nMr. KAPELOS: (As Bruno Gerussi) Oh!\n\nMr. KINNEAR: (As Bob Crane) Sh-sh-sh-sh. Calm down. Boo. Calm down.\n\nThey'll cut all this stuff out. They edit it, and they take all this stuff\n\nout.\n\n(End of soundbite)\n\nDAVIES: That's my guest Greg Kinnear playing Bob Crane in the film \"Auto\n\nFocus.\"\n\nDo you know if that scene was based on a real incident?\n\nMr. KINNEAR: It is. There was a cooking show up in Canada. It was a live\n\nbroadcast, and there is--or, at least, Paul Schrader was not able to locate\n\nthe tape of it, but it was a pretty talked-about incident that people were\n\naware of where Bob had gone on to the cooking show and just, you know, there\n\nwas an indication in his presence there that he was starting to maybe lose his\n\nway a little bit, and, of course, that was the beginning of a lot of things in\n\nhis life.\n\nDAVIES: You know one of the other films that's an interesting role for you is\n\nthe Farrelly brothers' film, \"Stuck on You,\" where you played conjoined twins\n\nwith Matt Damon, which is really actually a sweet movie, but, you know, I\n\nwondered if you had any reservations about taking that role when it could be\n\nseen as being in such terrible taste?\n\nMr. KINNEAR: Well, I thought that Peter Farrelly and Bobby Farrelly, who I\n\nknow, who actually have done a lot on behalf of, you know, handicapped people\n\nand have done a lot to try to put characters in their movies who may have\n\nphysical challenges and let them be part of the joke. In other words, not\n\ntreat them with kid gloves and not say, you know, it's almost like a reverse\n\ndiscrimination, where, `OK, well, they're handicapped, so we're not allowed to\n\nhave any--they're not allowed to be part of the joke. There's not allowed to\n\nbe any humor when dealing with somebody like that.' And I think that that is\n\nan ongoing issue that you can kind of find pieces of in all of their films.\n\nSo, you know, I felt like they would treat it properly, and moreover, when I\n\nread the script, you know, the fact that they're--you know, that Bob and Walt\n\nare conjoined is really secondary for them. They don't see any challenges.\n\nThey don't see any difficulties, and I think that that's, you know, I think\n\nthat's true of a lot of, you know, people who might have, you know, any kind\n\nof handicap that the issue is in the people around them and less about them.\n\nDAVIES: The other thing that's interesting about that film from the Greg\n\nKinnear point of view is, in this film, you get to belt out a showtune with a\n\nbig band at the end of the song, \"Summertime.\"\n\nMr. KINNEAR: That's right.\n\nDAVIES: It must have been fun.\n\nMr. KINNEAR: It was great actually. I'd never recorded anything before, and\n\nI was half--you know, Pete sent me, you know, the Billy--who's that?\n\nDAVIES: The Billy Stewart that did that version.\n\nMr. KINNEAR: Yeah, the Billy Stewart, right. He sent me the original Billy\n\nStewart, and he said, you know, `You need to start listening to this,' right\n\nas soon as I signed onto the movie, and I was thinking, `What the hell am I\n\nlistening to this for?' And then he sprung it on me that I was going to go\n\ndown to somebody's garage and do a recording of it. But the real highlight\n\nwas, of course, Meryl Streep agreeing to come on and do the dance number with\n\nme at the end of the movie. It was a very surreal couple of days, and she was\n\na great sport for playing along.\n\nDAVIES: Well, Greg Kinnear, we're happy you were able to find some time for\n\nus. Thanks a lot.\n\nMr. KINNEAR: Thank you for having me.\n\n(Soundbite from Greg Kinnear's song \"Summertime\")\n\nMr. KINNEAR: (Singing) \"Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr up, chup, chup,\n\nchu, chup, chup, huh! Summertime, huh! And the living is easy. Fish are\n\njumping, don't you know, my darling, I'll settle right down in the cotton is\n\nhigh. Like-a like-a like-a your life is richer. And your mama's\n\ngood-looking, yeah. So hush, pretty baby, don't you cry. One of these, one\n\nof these, one of these mornings coming, you're going to rise, you're going to\n\nrise...\n\n(End of soundbite)\n\nDAVIES: Greg Kinnear singing in the Farrelly brothers' film \"Stuck on You.\"\n\nHe starred in the recent movie \"Little Miss Sunshine,\" which is now out on\n\nDVD. His film \"Fast Food Nation\" will be out on DVD in March. I spoke with\n\nhim last year.\n\nComing up, David Edelstein on the new Peter O'Tooele film \"Venus.\" This is\n\nFRESH AIR.\n\n(Announcements)\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nReview: Film critic David Edelstein on the movie \"Venus\" with\n\nPeter O'Toole\n\nDAVE DAVIES, host:\n\nAt age 74, Peter O'Toole has what some have called the role of a lifetime as a\n\nterminally ill actor who's longing for the young niece of a friend forces him\n\nto re-examine the way he lived his life. The film \"Venus\" was written by\n\nHanif Kureishi, best known for his script of \"My Beautiful Laundrette,\" and\n\ndirected by Roger Michell, whose work includes the comedy \"Notting Hill\" and\n\nKureishi's bitter drama \"The Mother.\" Film critic David Edelstein has a\n\nreview.\n\nMr. DAVID EDELSTEIN: It's possible that no male actor has ever been as\n\nbeautiful as Peter O'Toole in Lawrence of Arabia. At age 29, he was slim and\n\nstraw-haired, with full lips and blue eyes that had an unearthly glow, and his\n\nmanner was giddy, like a schoolgirl in bloom. He made you understand, in a\n\nway that transcended the rather literal script, how Lawrence's penchant for\n\nself-dramatization drove him both to glory and to madness. That was in 1962,\n\nand O'Toole was marvelous after that, but usually in roles that exploited his\n\nnuttiness and dissipation, like the 1982 comedy \"My Favorite Year.\"\n\nNow the new movie \"Venus\" exploits his skeletal visage in a way that's\n\nheartbreaking. By exploits, I don't mean the filmmakers abuse him\n\nnecessarily. The screenplay, by Hanif Kureishi, is a serious meditation on\n\nwhat's happened to that face, on the way its glamour, like most glamour, has\n\ngiven way to a kind of ghoulishness. \"Venus\" is about an actor a little like\n\nO'Tooele, a matinee idol called Maurice, who's lived his life through women\n\nand through flesh that's now gray, almost translucent, pulled tightly over his\n\nbones.\n\nDid I mention that Venus is a comedy? It's billed that way and it does have\n\nits share of bittersweet laughs. The film centers on Maurice's relationship\n\nwith a teenage girl called Jessie, played by Jodie Whittaker, the\n\nworking-class niece of his old acting chum Ian, played by Leslie Phillips.\n\nIan can't stand her but Maurice is intrigued. He even attempts to engage her\n\nin conversation.\n\n(Soundbite of \"Venus\")\n\n(Soundbite of music and people chatting)\n\nMr. PETER O'TOOELE: (As Maurice) What are you doing? In London, I mean.\n\nMs. JODIE WHITTAKER: (As Jessie) Looking for work.\n\nMr. O'TOOELE: (As Maurice) What sort of work?\n\nMs. WHITTAKER: (As Jessie) Work. You know, work.\n\nMr. O'TOOELE: (As Maurice) Yes, yes, I know all about it. Any particular\n\nkind?\n\nMs. WHITTAKER: (As Jessie) Modeling.\n\nMr. O'TOOELE: (As Maurice) Well, there can't be much call for that.\n\nMs. WHITTAKER: (As Jessie) Call for what?\n\nMr. O'TOOELE: (As Maurice) Yodeling.\n\nMs. WHITTAKER: (As Jessie) Not yodeling. Yodeling. Modeling. You know?\n\nUnidentified Actress: Oh, and by the way...\n\nMs. WHITTAKER: (As Jessie) Do you know anyone of the modeling field?\n\nMr. O'TOOELE: (As Maurice) Yes. I know everyone. Do you have a fallback\n\nposition?\n\nMs. WHITTAKER: (As Jessie) No. No, I don't need one.\n\nMr. O'TOOELE: (As Maurice) Right.\n\nMs. WHITTAKER: (As Jessie) Are you saying I do?\n\n(End of soundbite)\n\nMr. EDELSTEIN: Jessie might or might not be a \"muddling\" prospect, but to\n\nMaurice she's youth incarnate. And so he begins to dog her. No, he can't\n\nhave sex with her. His medications, he says, make him impotent. He only\n\nwants to look and to touch. He brings her to the famous sculpture of Venus\n\nand explains, quote, \"A woman's body is the most beautiful thing a man will\n\never see.\" And gradually this untutored child, who Maurice now calls Venus,\n\nbegins to grasp the depth of his need. The ratio of creepiness to poignancy\n\nseesaws. You think, `Eeew,' and then `Aww,' and then `Eeew.'\n\nVenus is directed by Roger Michell, and it's a sort of companion piece to his\n\nand Kureishi's film \"The Mother,\" in which an aged widow, played by Anne Reid,\n\nhas an affair with a studly handyman, a pre-Bond Daniel Craig. But I had\n\nmixed emotions about what Michell does here. His clammy, clinical tone was\n\nmore suited to \"The Mother,\" in which the characters were all vaguely rancid.\n\nNow he forces us to study O'Toole's actual decrepitude while his camera hugs\n\nWhittaker's bare thighs and shoulders, and the exploitation does begin to seem\n\nunseemly.\n\nThe movie is schematic. Maurice will have to pay for his unsavory attentions.\n\nIt's only a surprise when Jessie's thuggish boyfriend begins to knock the\n\nfrail old man around because it's hard to believe the filmmakers would stoop\n\nto such a crude device. But I can see some viewers will regard that\n\ncreepiness and violence as a mark of the filmmakers' integrity.\n\nOn the comic side, there's some wonderful banter involving Leslie Phillips and\n\nthe alarmingly rotund Richard Griffiths, also onscreen as a pederast teacher\n\nin \"The History Boys,\" as acting colleagues who meet for lunch and comb the\n\nobituaries for friends. We get a glimpse of a world of middle and\n\nupper-middle class repertory actors going cheek by jowl into that good night.\n\nEven better are the scenes between O'Toole and a luminous Vanessa Redgrave, as\n\nthe woman he abandoned, the mother of his children. Her anger at Maurice for\n\nputting his pleasure first lingers, but you can see in her eyes she knows he's\n\ndying, so even her criticisms come out tenderly, less to get her own back than\n\nto let him know she understands the unquenchable hunger he's feeling.\n\nAt times \"Venus\" seems less of a pedestal for O'Toole than a headstone, but\n\nopposite Redgrave his spirit is undying.\n\nDAVIES: David Edelstein is film critic for New York Magazine.\n\n(Credits)"
