        "text": "“Don’t you just love New York in the fall?”\n\nI often feel compelled to express my annual affection for the autumnal rom-com classic, You’ve Got Mail, and present a case for why it’s one of the most charming love letters to New York City the cinema has ever seen. Or at the very least, a masterpiece of 90s nostalgia.\n\nWhy 'You've Got Mail' is the Autumn Inspiration We Need Right Now\n\nSo why do I feel the need to defend its very existence? Because it’s one of those movies that just would never be made today. Having worked in film and TV development in Hollywood for many years—a job that requires reading piles of scripts, submitted with pride by hopeful scribes everywhere, and then ripping apart their life’s work in a matter of hours—I can admit that this adorable story would be considered problematic in many ways by the current standards of the industry—and our social climate in general.\n\nSo since the late, great Nora Ephron is no longer here to discuss her evergreen autumnal classic and the ultimate feel good flick of 1997, I volunteer as tribute.\n\nLet’s address the problematic parts first, so we can move on to the good stuff.\n\n1. It’s not a feminist story. In any way.\n\nWomen’s rights went through a bit of a latency period between the bra burning 1970s and today’s common era. Living in the pre-social media 90s meant that for many, ignorance was bliss. Things seemed fine on the surface. Those pesky, highly publicized sexual harassment scandals were conveniently brushed aside as soon as the next one cropped up, women seemed equally comfortable at home or at the office, everybody seemed satisfied with their salaries, privilege and diversity weren’t much talked about in Hollywood elite circles—more on that in a minute—because no one had the ability to vocalize such injustices in a public forum quite the way we do today, and ironically, this is a movie about the very technology that would change all of that.\n\nSo yes, Kathleen Kelly was allowed to fall in love with a man who savagely destroyed her livelihood and her late mother’s legacy; who essentially ghosted her on their first date by not revealing himself as her online paramour, and then purposely strung her along via some (really charming) instant messaging. Yes, in hindsight, it might have been more satisfying for her to be the one to unmask his identity first and then string him along as an act of revenge for obliterating The Shop Around the Corner, but we all know she’s just too darn nice for that! Also it’s just a movie, so let’s move on.\n\nYes, in the 90s nothing mattered, so we could say things like that.\n\n5. “You can do it. Zip zip.”\n\nThis is the glib response Joe gives (a then unknown) Sara Ramirez—playing the disgruntled cashier at Zabar’s who won’t accept Kathleen’s credit card after she was too distracted by his presence to read the Cash Only sign, and is subsequently heckled by a bunch of Karens in line behind her. This is a pretty weak attempt—beginning with a cringe-worthy knock knock joke—to give Joe a redeeming moment (or a “Save the Cat” moment as its known in screenwriting lingo) as Kathleen’s would-be knight in shining armor—not to mention, a rather condescending way of speaking to service people. Although I suppose it’s fitting with the arrogant behavior we’ve come to expect at this point in his character arc.\n\nBut overall, the implied message here is that being exposed to Kathleen and her compassionate, light-hearted nature melts Joe’s steely, business-minded heart and makes him a better person who stops to smell the daisies, if you will. So we can forgive him for now. Also, a Cash Only line? How 1997!\n\nSo, now that we’ve addressed the proverbial elephants in the room, let’s talk about the things that make this movie such a delightful time capsule and an ode to the Autumn in New York that Billie Holliday once sang about."
