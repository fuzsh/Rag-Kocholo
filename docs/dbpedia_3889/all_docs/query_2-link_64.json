        "text": "directed by Jonathan Dayton & Valerie Faris\n\nI remember when I was watching “The Kominsky Method” and Michael Douglas was joking together with Alan Arkin about death – not even once – and I was thinking “damn, that would be just awful if any of them passed away in real”. And the day has come… Recently, we lost Alan Arkin, a marvellous actor who not only was shining bright in the already mentioned series, but also in many other productions. In order to show my respect, I’d like to dedicate this post to him and recommend you a film that will always make you smile, which I’m sure Mr. Arkin would want. The story starts with a family gathering where we meet all the members – workaholic Sheryl (Toni Collette), her aspiring-to-become-a-coach husband Richard (Greg Kinnear), mysterious and not speaking (by choice) teenage son Dwayne (Paul Dano), adorable daughter Olive (Abigail Breslin) who wants to be a beauty queen, grumpy and rather straight-forward grandpa Edwin (Alan Arkin), and Sheryl’s brother Frank (Steve Carell) who has recently attempted suicide. A family like any other, right? Not even being sarcastic here. Anyway, Olive has been qualified for some beauty pageant called “Little Miss Sunshine”, where little girls dress up like single 40s and entertain the audience. Magnificent event! The family, after a difficult discussion, decide to travel together to California and support the girl in making her dream come true. But since each of the family members is quite specific, you may be sure that the trip becomes a real adventure. This film looks like a comedy as there are numerous hilarious moments, lots of sarcasm and jokes that I personally appreciated, but if you think about it, there’s way more drama hidden somewhere there. I believe this is one of the best productions showing family problems and how important it is to support each other even if we really are from different planets. Besides, the cast couldn’t be better – each of the actors did a wonderful job, including little Abigail who’s always been a star – and I’m not talking about her cuteness only. That girl was showing a lot of acting talent despite her very young age. I remember that “Little Miss Sunshine” was also my first film with Paul Dano and ever since then I’ve been his huge fan. This man is incredibly under appreciated by the cinema world, in my opinion. However, in order to put a spotlight on Alan Arkin, I’d like to say that the scenes with Edwin and Olive really warm my heart. Even the actress who played Olive shared a touching post remembering Alan Arkin from that production. In fact, I shed a tear reading her words. She wrote: “Although we were not related in real life, you will alway be “Grandpa” in my heart.” And I bet he will always be our Grandpa in our hearts as well. Watch “Little Miss Sunshine” and remember this great actor. May you rest in peace, Mr. Arkin.\n\nMy rating: 9/10\n\nS.\n\ndirected by Greg Kinnear\n\nDo you sometimes have this feeling that your life is a total mess, that you’re not doing well and whatever you’d do, it would just make it worse? I’m sure you have felt something similar in your life, we all have. If you haven’t, it means you have a good dealer. Anyway, I’m sure you know Greg Kinnear. Even if his name doesn’t ring a bell, if you look at his photo, you’ll know. He’s one of those actors that everyone recognises, but not everyone can name more than one film with him. Which doesn’t mean he’s a bad actor, because he isn’t. Unfortunately, he isn’t so media-friendly apparently. “Phil” is the first film directed by him, but you may also enjoy watching him as an actor because he plays the main role in it. And I guess I won’t surprise you much with the information that his name in the film is Phil. Incredible, I know. Phil is a very depressed and… well… sort of a lifeless dentist. He doesn’t feel any pleasure living, so he’s willing to commit a suicide. But if he did, we wouldn’t have anything to watch for the next 1,5h. So he doesn’t and soon meets another man, Michael (Bradley Whitford), who happens to be his patient. Michael is the absolute opposite of Phil. He is cheerful, successful, positive and extremely talkative. One day, Phil decides to follow his patient and finds him dead after he’s committed a suicide. And here we go. Phil doesn’t have anything to do with it. He doesn’t even know the guy. But you know what bothers him? Why the hell a guy who has everything settled in his life decides to kill himself? This film made me laugh a lot (especially when Phil was learning Greek, that was pure gold), but also encouraged me to reflect on myself and my life. It’s a very nice directorial debut, Mr Kinnear. Chapeau bas.\n\nMy rating: 6/10\n\nS.\n\ndirected by Neil LaBute\n\nMorgan Freeman, Chris Rock, Renée Zellweger, waiter, murder, soap opera, doctor, nurse, “A Reason to Love”. This is word by word an explanation of today’s film plot. If you’re not tempted yet, then I don’t know how the hell you get satisfied. Anyway, I’m sure some of you have heard of this film, because it’s quite old and it’s been on TV many times. People consider it a relaxing Sunday comedy you can watch with your family and say “awww” whenever Renée says something because her character is so naive and adorable. I’m going to destroy this picture of yours. It’s a horribly deep drama covered in a ridiculous costume called “comedy”. Shortly, we get Betty (Renée Zellweger) who is a waitress at a diner. She is a huge fan of this one soap opera “A Reason to Love”, especially the actor playing Dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear). Accidentally, Betty gets into her husband’s drugs dealing mess (you will see how) and witnesses his murder by two hitmen (Morgan Freeman & Chris Rock). After that situation, Betty sort of loses her mind. She’s so confused and shocked about her husband’s death that she starts believing she used to be engaged to a handsome and famous surgeon who… happens to be Dr. David Ravell. Yes, the soap opera character. She starts living her lie so badly that she decides to become a nurse and find her “ex-fiancé”. Complicated? A bit. Strange? A lot. However, it’s not a film to laugh, in my opinion. Okay, if you have no empathy, maybe you will find Betty extremely amusing. Still, her character made me feel empty inside. And the worst part is that everybody around her are in great moods, enjoying their time, while this woman is suffering not even being aware of that. I’m not surprised that Renée got a Golden Globe for this performance. I honestly felt anxious watching this film. Perhaps the story could be slightly better written, but in general it’s worth checking out.\n\nMy rating: 6/10\n\nS."
