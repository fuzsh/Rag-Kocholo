        "text": "In the aptly named “Thin Ice,” Greg Kinnear plays a Wisconsin insurance salesman who gets mixed up in a mild caper that escalates into murder and blackmail. Mr. Kinnear, with his twitchy blue eyes, blandly handsome features and unparalleled ability to tiptoe on the boundary between charm and sleaze, is almost too well suited to this kind of character. He has played guys like this many times before, in better movies, perhaps most notably “Little Miss Sunshine.”\n\nAnd “Thin Ice” itself, while not entirely unpleasant, is gnawingly familiar, a slice of room-temperature heartland quirk that tries to blend low-key comedy with violence and mayhem. It would like to remind you of “Fargo” — what with all the snow, the grubbiness and greed, the exaggerated accents and off-kilter rhythms — and it kind of does, but in a dispiriting way.\n\nMr. Kinnear’s character, Mickey Prohaska, is a smoothie whose life has developed a few rough edges. Separated from his wife (the marvelous Lea Thompson, too briefly seen here) and plagued by money troubles, he could use a break. He finds one when a new employee (David Harbour) tries to sell a homeowner’s policy to an eccentric old man who turns out to possess an extremely valuable violin.\n\nThe old-timer is played by Alan Arkin, and the hotheaded locksmith who accidentally becomes Mickey’s partner in crime is played by Billy Crudup. Bob Balaban is a fussy violin dealer. Casting, in other words, is not the problem.\n\nThe problem is that “Thin Ice” feels as indecisive and panicky as its hero, unsure of the tone it wants to strike or the story it wants to tell. The first scenes, which take place at a convention of insurance agents — a setup that cannot help recalling the infinitely sweeter and wittier “Cedar Rapids” — are a disorienting mix of nuttiness and Midwestern deadpan, and thereafter the movie can’t seem to figure out if it wants to be tawdry or zany, an amoral romp or a cautionary tale.\n\nThe plot, meanwhile, tilts from the random to the preposterous, and a final twist feels less like a payoff than like a cheat. Along the way, a few amusing things happen, and a handful of clever lines are uttered, but the point of the exercise is hard to discern.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
