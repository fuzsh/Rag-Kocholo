        "text": "The David Koepp-directed film stars British comedian Ricky Gervais as a Manhattan dentist who has a near-death experience that enables him to see ghosts. One apparition in particular, played by Greg Kinnear, is bugged about his widow's impending remarriage and wants the tooth doctor to help sabotage the wedding.\n\nMuch like the movie, Gervais was making himself the star of the press Q&A, while Kinnear sat next to him in silence most of the time, a bemused look on his face, no doubt feeling as invisible as the spirit he plays in the movie.\n\n\"It looked like me on the page,” the stout, dark-haired comic said of his first starring role in a theatrical film. \"When I first read it — and I read a lot of scripts and turned them all down, mainly because I was busy — this is the best script I've read in five years, and it was an interesting character. I laughed at this curmudgeonly, awful, rich, successful, clever man going around saying ‘You're all idiots,' which appealed to me. And I've always liked those wisecrackers that sort of laughed in the face of adversity and it didn't do them any good.\n\n\"That's the important thing,” Gervais went on. \"They're still the loser. Groucho Marx, Woody Allen, Bob Hope. They might be getting these things off their chests but they're still losing, and I really like that. I like that about thinkers. And it's slightly more emotional than some of the broader comedies. In fact, it's quite heartwarming. I felt a bit sorry for him, as well, and that was important. There's a thing where we came up with him just making cocoa. It's really sweet, and his pajamas are laid out. He's a man who wants order, but he's missing out on something. And he sort of knows it deep down.\n\n\"And that always appeals to me — pathos. ‘Comedy-plus,' I call it.”\n\nGervais has been practicing comedy-plus on British radio and television since the late '90s, achieving Golden Globe- and Emmy-winning success with the British version of docu-soap parody \"The Office” (2001-03) and the HBO sitcom \"Extras” (2005-07), both co-created with one-time assistant Steve Merchant. The popularity of the two series has put him in high demand for feature film roles, but Gervais has been declining offers that were for mostly brief, supporting parts, holding out for just the right starring vehicle.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with smaller roles, he said, \"but no one's ever said, ‘He's been in 19 films for two minutes, let's give him his own starring role and let him direct.' It doesn't happen like that, and I get no joy in seeing my fat face on the screen. I get joy out of the work. And if you got offered lovely things, it would be fun. I just think, ‘What's the best that can happen?'”\n\nAt this point, one of the reporters noticed Kinnear wasn't getting word one into the conversation, and he asked the actor if he'd heard of any ghost sightings from friends or fans.\n\n\"I have not heard many ghost stories,” Kinnear said, and then he, too, slipped into the role of interviewer, turning to Gervais with a sly smile. \"Ricky was involved in an amazing ghost sighting at the Roosevelt Hotel,” he said.\n\n\"Unbelievable, totally made-up story,” Gervais grumbled.\n\nThey were referring to an Aug. 30 story in a London newspaper, claiming that Gervais had been frightened by the appearance of ghosts during a press junket at the Roosevelt, a Los Angeles hotel with a reputation for being haunted.\n\n\"Did you do interviews at the Roosevelt?” Kinnear asked.\n\n\"Never been there,” Gervais said. \"Never heard of the hotel. It said I was there on a production. No, I wasn't. Apparently, I fled the hotel because I'd seen ghosts. And then they went, ‘Ghost Town's' coming out, don't make stuff up.' Well, I don't believe in ghosts. That horrified me. I said I want a retraction. I don't believe in ghosts. It's a good film. You don't need to make stuff up.”\n\nWhen someone asked Gervais what made him the best choice for the Dr. Pincus role, he said, \"I think I can bring something else,” and Kinnear picked up the biggest microphone on the table and held it to the comedian's face, reporter-style.\n\n\"Thank you,” Gervais said to him.\n\n\"I just want to get this,” Kinnear said.\n\n\"I'm glad it's a microphone this time,” Gervais said, and then he continued, \"I don't know. I think because I'm a writer/director, I can sometimes see the bigger picture, if they care. I also think that the roles, the people who want to hire me sort of know what I do. Let's face it. There are much better people if they (want someone else for the parts).”\n\nSomeone asked Kinnear if he'd had to adjust to Gervais' nontraditional approach to acting and \"larger than life personality” during the making of \"Ghost Town,” and the Oscar-nominated actor, no slouch in the personality department himself, continued to maintain his good-sport attitude when he answered.\n\n\"Not at all,” Kinnear said. \"We'd never worked together before. I knew Ricky was larger than life because the first time I saw him, he was larger than life. It was at Madison Square Garden, and David Koepp took me down there during the David Bowie kind of exposition, said, ‘Hey, we're gonna go check out Ricky.' And I didn't know if we were just gonna go meet him or what, and suddenly I'm sitting in this 5,000-seat theater, and in he walks — with a beer in his hand, by the way — and a T-shirt, and people went nuts.”\n\n\"It was this T-shirt,” Gervais said, pointing at his black attire.\n\n\"It smells like it,” Kinnear said. And to the reporters he said, \"It was flawless. He doesn't really have a lot of self-consciousness. And that's a real gift. And his subtlety from the show needed to be used entirely to kind of flesh out this character, and it's all there. It was not really much of an adjustment. You know, his temper and his grumpiness as the evening wanes on can be a little difficult.”\n\nTravel and accommodations provided by Dreamworks Pictures."
