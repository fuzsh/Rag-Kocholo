        "text": "Here’s a trailer for a silly-looking time travel comedy titled The Present, which stars Isla Fisher and Greg Kinnear. The story follows a boy who finds that he can manipulate time using a family heirloom… an old grandfather clock.\n\nThe boy ends up teaming “up with his siblings on a quest to bring their separated parents back together again by going back to the time when their separation began.” So that sounds like an interesting scenario.\n\nFisher and Kinnear star as the parents, and they are joined by Ryan Guzman, Shay Rudolph, Amir Talai, Alphonso McAuley, Easton Rocket Sweda, Sarah Jane MacKay, and Mason Shea Joyce, with Eric Tiede.\n\nThe film was directed by Christian Ditter and it sure does look like a cheeseball movie. There’s no US release date yet."
