Was led to an article on Peoples website about an actress from a tv show. The article I was sent to had a major spoiler for the show Im watching- basically ruined that part of it for me, and zero spoiler alert.

The spoiler had nothing to do with the articles title, and it was right at the beginning of the article, so no way I couldve avoided seeing it. Thanks, People! Not a life or death problem, but thank you for taking away something I had to look forward to. Thanks for no heads up, oh and thanks for the insane amounts of intrusive ads as well!

Right after I read your unsolicited spoiler for that tv show, my entire screen was filled with a picture of nasty fast food- something I couldnt scroll out of! Thanks for all your hard, important work.

While Im at it- thanks for also abusing true crime stories for profit! Im sure the victims families feel great seeing their loved one splashed all over the cover of your inane magazine, along with a trashy clickbait headline, to boot.

Bravo on such groundbreaking journalism, and A+ for ruining your readers experiences with unannounced spoilers and rank ads that make the rest unreadable. 10/10.
