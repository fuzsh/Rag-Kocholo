        "text": "“Salma Hayek’s New Initiative” brings national attention to HALO-supported orphanage\n\nKANSAS CITY, MO — Lirio de los Valles was the first ever HALO-supported orphanage. HALO provides the children of this home with tuition for education, school uniforms, art therapy and other urgent needs. This orphanage houses 65 to 110 children from the streets of Tijuana each year, with a focus on youth who have been victims of sexual violence. Recently Salma Hayek announced a new initiative supporting Lirio de los Valles, which was featured in People Magazine, bringing national attention to the HALO-supported orphanage.\n\n“I have a lot of hope for this new initiative that I’m taking on and I’m really hoping that People Magazine readers might also want to be a part of this,” Hayek said in a video interview hosted by USA Today. “In a small operation like this any kind of help, even a few dollars, makes a huge difference for these people. And of course it would be great if we could continue to make this bigger and expand to more children.”\n\nIt costs, on average, $20 per month for education for a child at Lirio de los Valles, and $237 per month per child provides housing, food, caretakers, and medical needs. Every dollar truly counts and could be the difference between children living on the streets or living with a loving family. Lirio de los Valles provides the family that so many of them need.\n\n“There is such a need in Tijuana as I learned first-hand when on my first visit there more than 10 years ago. Many of the area orphanages won’t take victims of sexual abuse because they are ‘more difficult’ to serve,” said HALO Founder Rebecca Welsh. “But Lirio de los Valles does. And as the years have passed, the needs there have increased as the orphanage supports more and more children. That is why HALO stepped in.”\n\nRight now you can bid online on works of art inspired by homeless, at-risk and orphaned youth from Mexico and around the world. HALO’s Bloom Auction is open through Friday, November 18 at 5:00 pm, EST. Internationally known artists were inspired by stories and artwork submitted by HALO youth and all 100 percent of proceeds will go to benefit HALO homes & orphanages in the United States and abroad.\n\nAbout HALO\n\nFeatured in the Moroccanoil INSPIRED film series, “American Spirit” of CBS Evening News, “Heroes Among Us” of PEOPLE magazine, “The Today Show”, and Variety Magazine, HALO provides housing, healing and education to youth in the greatest need.
