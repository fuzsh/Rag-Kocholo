        "text": "By popular demand, a second issue is coming! Mushroom People 2 is publishing fall 2024. Want to be notified when we launch? Use the \"Notify Me\" button to join the waitlist.\n\nLike the life-filled microcosm of a richly decaying stump, the sequel to our best-selling magazine hosts an eclectic variety of stories illuminating the ways mushrooms subvert and expand our understanding of the world around us. In Mushroom People 2, we hear from astromycologists, academics, architects, pharmacists, foragers, fashion designers, home cooks, shopkeepers, composers, and poets all inspired by the many radical ways of being fungi embody.\n\nThe stories in these pages explore creation, destruction, attraction, and revulsion: Lauren Oster examines the outer limits of fungi's off-planet potential, Maria Pinto writes about the city as a holobiont, Riitta Ikonen and Annie Collinge find human-sized mushrooms in the Finnish wilds. Bethany van Risjwijk explores the folkloric connection between thunder, lightning, and mushrooms, and Anna Kodé serves mushrooms for dessert. Plus: fungal attachment styles, mushroom zombies, the mycobiome, cozy mushroom houses; and a bonus section on slime molds that oozes with wonder and possibility.\n\n208 pages, perfect bound. Features three premium paper stocks. Measures 8.25\" x 11.25.\""
