        "text": "Who We Are\n\nPEOPLE’s accomplished team of editors, writers, designers and photographers are all dedicated to the brand’s core mission: to inform, entertain and inspire by sharing the stories that everyone will be talking about. For 50 years, the PEOPLE team has been comprised of trusted experts in nearly every field. We’re the go-to source for news about celebrities, entertainment and the royals, and we elevate powerful human interest stories and everyday people making a difference in their communities. With decades of experience and a true passion for the subjects we cover, our journalists believe in the power of storytelling to make a difference.\n\nAll About PEOPLE\n\nPEOPLE delivers the most trustworthy celebrity news and captivating human interest stories, connecting you to the pulse of American culture. Since our first issue hit stands in 1974, we have been striving to tell compelling stories about the people behind the issues, as opposed to just the issues themselves. We are your everyday escape, taking you inside the lives of intriguing stars, newsmakers, up-and-comers and ordinary people doing extraordinary things. We serve and delight you by providing ideas about beauty, food and style through the lens of the people influencing the trends. And we are a force for good by telling stories of hope, optimism and kindness that drive conversation and inspire action.\n\nEditorial Policy\n\nIf you read it on PEOPLE, you know it is true. PEOPLE is committed to accurate, fair and complete journalism. As part of the Dotdash Meredith publishing family, we uphold the Dotdash Meredith Content Integrity Promise.\n\nClick here for our full Editorial Policy.\n\nClick here for our Terms of Use page.\n\nChatGPT & Other AI\n\nAt PEOPLE, we are committed to providing the highest quality content, created by a trusted group of human writers, reporters and editors with our audience in mind. It is against our guidelines to publish automatically generated content that has been written by AI (artificial intelligence) tools such as ChatGPT.\n\nDiversity & Inclusion\n\nPEOPLE is committed to taking visible, measurable steps to combat racism, sexism and other biases in the media. Our definition of diversity, and the areas in which we seek to increase inclusivity and representation, includes race, culture, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, body type and ability.\n\nWe will enlist Dotdash Meredith’s Anti-Bias Review Board to do a thorough review of our content on a consistent basis, starting with our print magazine and social media platforms (which include Instagram, TikTok and YouTube), to give actionable recommendations of how we can increase diversity and representation in those formats.\n\nAdditionally, we will conduct a survey of contractors who create content for PEOPLE to better understand the diverse makeup of our freelancers, photographers, and other contributors. This survey will aid in our ongoing initiative to make diversity a priority when assigning work, and during our recruiting and hiring processes.\n\nWe will commit to greater representation in our visual assets, working to ensure a broad array of people and perspectives are represented on social media, our homepage, within print and digital articles, and in any additional video programming. With the help of the Anti-Bias Review Board, we will continue to do ongoing audits of the language we use to ensure it is fair, accurate and inclusive.\n\nAnd we will ask readers to hold us accountable.
