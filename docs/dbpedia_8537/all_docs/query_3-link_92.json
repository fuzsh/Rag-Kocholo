        "text": "Types of contacts\n\nThere are two types of contacts, directory contacts which come from your organization, and local contacts which you can add from scratch to your copy of Teams.\n\nDirectory contacts have some fields set by your organization, and additional fields which can be edited by you.\n\nLocal contacts are stored within your local copy of Teams, and do not synch with an organizationâ€™s directory.\n\nAdd people in your organization to your saved contacts\n\nIf your company has a directory set up, you'll be able to see information about your colleagues without saving them as contacts. You can search for them in Search in Teams or select their picture in Chats or Channels. Their profile card will show information collected from the directory.\n\nIf you want to add other information or to see your colleagues as part of your contact list, you can save them to your contacts by selecting their name in directory search during contact creation.\n\nThe new contact is linked to the existing directory contact and will be updated automatically to stay up to date with directory information. For example, if their title changes in the directory, your local contact will be updated with the same information.\n\nOnly you will see the information you add to your contact and your changes to such information will not by synced back to company directory.\n\nFor directory contacts, you may not edit or delete any directory fields, including, but not limited to, name and email addresses. These fields will appear grayed out and you will not be able to modify them. Please contact your IT admin or HR department for such requests."
