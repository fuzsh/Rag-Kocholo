        "text": "A festival, promising a blend of reggae music, art, skateboarding and food will make its debut in Fayetteville this fall.\n\nFriends of the Skateparks, a nonprofit organization, has partnered with PortCity Reggae Concert & Promotion to create the One People Reggae & Arts Festival on Oct. 12 in Fayetteville's Festival Park. All proceeds will go toward funding the new Hope Mills Skate Park.\n\nThe festival will be the first major fundraiser for the skatepark project, Terry Grimble, festival organizer, said last week.\n\nThe event promises to feature reggae legends, food trucks, beer and wine sales, approximately 40-60 vendors and regional opening bands Oct. 12, according to a news release from the Friends of the Skatepark Foundation. The release said the festival is funded with a $7,350 grant from the Arts Council of Fayetteville-Cumberland County.\n\n\"Reggae has a positive message of peace, love, unity and fun, something the entire family can enjoy. I love Fayetteville and I want to bring the joy of good reggae music here,\" Grimble said. \"To raise funds for different skateparks, I have produced hundreds of live music events since 1991, featuring mostly punk rock bands, hip hop groups/artists and reggae bands.\"\n\nWho is performing at the One People Reggae and Arts Festival?\n\nThe festival will feature reggae legends, such as The Wailers, Inner Circle, Etana, Luciano, Steel Pulse, Stephen Marley and others, the release said.\n\n\"Besides reggae being my personal favorite genre of music, reggae has been a stable genre in skateboarding culture since the 1970s,\" Grimble said. \"Going through the grant process was challenging but worth it because it helped us plan the event more thoroughly.\"\n\nHe said the full lineup has not yet been announced and that the festival is also searching for local reggae talent and encourages anyone interested to send their resume and portfolio to friendsofskateparksfoundation@gmail.com. Grimble said vendors, food trucks, sponsors, volunteers and artists can also inquire about how to get involved.\n\nHe said the primary sponsor of the festival is Karma Culture, a Fayetteville vape and smoke shop.\n\n\"Festival Park in downtown Fayetteville is a great venue and we feel that Fayetteville is an untapped market that has the most potential for growth,\" he said.\n\nEarly bird tickets start at $25.75 for lawn seating, $35.25 for the front-of-stage area and $60.25 for a VIP deck, which comes with a private bar, wait staff, table and chair. Tickets can be purchased online at onepeoplereggaefestival.com.\n\nWhat's planned for the Hope Mills Skate Park?\n\nGrimble said Friends of the Skateparks is responsible for the construction of the Hope Mills Skate Park on a 1-acre lot owned by the town of Hope Mills. He said once construction is complete, Friends of the Skateparks will gift the park to the town, which will then take over its maintenance.\n\n\"Our current design has a street style plaza section, a mini bowl with some cool bells and whistles and a very unique 'pump track' feature connecting the street plaza area to the bowl area but also allowing plenty of greenspace and spectator space,\" Grimble said.\n\nA pump track is a continuous loop featuring berms, rollers, and various obstacles, designed to be ridden by \"pumping\" your legs to gain speed rather than kicking or pedaling if on a bike.\n\n\"Pump tracks are loved by skateboarders, especially beginners, but also loved by bike riders, roller skaters, surf skaters, in-line skaters and scooter riders,\" he said.\n\nThe pump-track feature will be unique to the Hope Mills Skate Park, he said.\n\nThe details\n\nWhen: 1-10 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 12\n\nWhere: Fayetteville's Festival Park, 345 Ray Ave.\n\nWebsite and tickets: Onepeoplereggaefestival.com\n\nMore information: Email info@onepeoplereggaefestival.com."
