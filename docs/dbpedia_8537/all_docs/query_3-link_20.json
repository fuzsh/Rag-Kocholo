        "text": "Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce: Super Bowl champion. Check. Six-time Pro Bowler. Check. Five-time first-team All-Pro selection. Check. Featured in People magazine's \"Sexiest Man Alive\" issue? Check.\n\nKelce is adding another accolade to his resume and this honor has nothing to do with football. Although his younger brother, Kansas City Chiefs superstar Travis Kelce, has dominated the headlines this season with his whirlwind romance with global pop star Taylor Swift, it's now Jason's turn in the spotlight.\n\nHe is featured in People magazine's annual \"Sexiest Man Alive Issue,\" alongside actors Pedro Pascal and Timothée Chalamet, and musicians Usher, Jamie Foxx and Lenny Kravitz. The winner of this year's \"Sexiest Man Alive\" title was Patrick Dempsey, who was revealed Tuesday evening on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live.\"\n\nConsider it a birthday gift to Kelce, who turned 36 on Sunday, when the Eagles defeated the Dallas Cowboys, 28-23, to improve to 8-1 on the season.\n\nMaybe it's Jason's iconic game day outfits that landed him the \"Sexiest Man Alive\" issue, like the time he went viral for wearing blue jeans, flip flops and a green T-shirt to a game.\n\n\"Jason’s game day fit is the same fit he wears everyday. What the (expletive) do I care about a game day fit. Some people go to play football and some people play dress up. I don’t like to play dress-up. I like to play football,\" Jason Kelce said during an episode of his \"New heights\" podcast with Travis Kelce. \"I’m not going to go shopping, color coordination, getting belts and all this (expletive) just to go play football… What’s the point.\"\n\nOr maybe it's his relatable charm that earned him the honor."
