        "text": "When the Stern Show’s Robin Quivers was diagnosed with stage 3 endometrial cancer in 2012, she stayed upbeat despite the grim news. Twelve years later, her brave journey and recovery were highlighted in a recent feature by People magazine.\n\n“You deal with cancer in a way that I find inspirational,” Howard told his longtime co-host. “Your positive attitude and the way you tackle various health challenges … most of us would crumble.”\n\nRobin did more than just bare her soul in the spread. Bald from her case of alopecia, she decided to take photos without a head covering. “You’ve got a nice round head — some people have a conehead,” Howard noted.\n\n“I had a barber shave my head the first time and teach me how to do it, and as soon as he was done, I said, ‘Is there anything about my head that should not be seen?’” Robin admitted while laughing.\n\nWhile Howard was proud that his radio partner had nice things to say in the piece about his support during a difficult time, he was perhaps even more pleased at the mention of staffer Benjy Bronk. “My favorite part of the article is when Robin points out that she feels she made a full recovery because she did not allow Benjy into her hospital room,” he joked. “That was the best.”\n\n“You shouldn’t be around him when you’re vulnerable,” Robin added with a chuckle. “It could have been a disaster — I couldn’t take a chance.”"
