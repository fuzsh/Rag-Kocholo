        "text": "People has declared Patrick Dempsey as the 2023 Sexiest Man Alive, and he's in good company.\n\nSince the magazine began honoring Hollywood's best-looking men in 1985 when it named Mel Gibson the Sexiest Man Alive, nearly three dozen other celebrities have held the title.\n\nThree of those men — Brad Pitt, George Clooney and Johnny Depp — have won the title twice. Richard Gere made the list twice, too, but the first time around, in 1993, he was honored along with his then-wife, supermodel Cindy Crawford, as the Sexiest Couple Alive.\n\nOnly one celebrity won the title retroactively: Keanu Reeves, who in 2015 was named the Sexiest Man Alive for 1994. (More on that below!)\n\nHere's everyone who won People's Sexiest Man Alive title.\n\n1985 — Mel Gibson\n\nGibson was crowned People's first Sexiest Man Alive back in 1985. Gibson had already dazzled movie audiences as both as an action star in the first several \"Mad Max\" franchise movies and a dramatic actor in \"The Year of Living Dangerously\" and \"The Bounty,\" among others.\n\nThough the actor's career would continue to boom — that is, before legal issues and controversies derailed it decades later — the actor already had the sense that fame could prove to be a handful. “It’s all happening too fast,\" he told People at the time.\n\n1986 — Mark Harmon\n\nWhen Harmon won the title, he was one of television's biggest stars thanks to his role as Dr. Robert Caldwell on the medical drama \"St. Elsewhere.\"\n\nThe former college football star told People at the time that he couldn't comprehend his physical appeal. “All I see is a bunch of fake teeth and football scars,\" he said.\n\nIn 2015, Harmon told People that shortly after he won the title, he and his buddies were treated to a funny surprise. “I’d done an interview with People about leaving 'St. Elsewhere' and I went up to play basketball and both backboards on either side of the court were plastered with the (Sexiest Man Alive) cover.\"\n\n1987 — Harry Hamlin\n\nHamlin was one of the stars of the hit legal drama \"L.A. Law\" when he won the title in 1987. The modest actor told the magazine, \"Certainly when I look in the mirror, I don’t get turned on,\" and noted his looks were \"not something I spend a lot of time considering.\"\n\nYears later, Hamlin showed off his sense of humor when he did a guest arc (alongside real-life wife Lisa Rinna) on the mid-2000s whodunnit series \"Veronica Mars.\" Hamlin portrayed an off-the-rails Hollywood star who brags about his winning a Sexiest Man Alive title in the 1980s.\n\n1988 — John F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nThe first non-professional actor to win the Sexiest Man Alive title, the late Kennedy was a law student at New York University School of Law when he was crowned in 1988.\n\nPeople's breathless story about Kennedy at the time celebrated his physical attributes (including his \"extraordinarily defined thighs\"), his charisma and his social conscience.\n\n\"It is not merely his looks — his mother’s dark eyes and his father’s striking body. (He’s 6’1″ 187 lbs.) It is that he has something that no film star, no athlete, can duplicate — the aura, the excitement that charges a room when he enters it, simply by virtue of being Kennedy,\" it read.\n\n1n July 1999, Kennedy, his wife, Carolyn, and his sister-in-law Lauren died when a plane he was piloting crashed near Martha’s Vineyard.\n\n1989 — Sean Connery\n\n“For once, I’m speechless,” then-59-year-old Connery told People after learning he won the title. “It’ll all be downhill from here!”\n\nIt was not actually downhill from there for Connery. The following year, he played Michelle Pfeiffer’s lover in “The Russia House.” He still holds the record for the oldest man to win the title.\n\n1990 — Tom Cruise\n\nCruise won the title during the early years of his Hollywood mega-success after proving to be a box-office superstar while earning critical raves for \"Risky Business,\" \"Top Gun,” \"Rain Man,\" \"The Color of Money\" and \"Born on the Fourth of July.\"\n\nCruise's \"Rain Man\" co-star Valeria Golino told People that the actor's most mesmerizing attribute was his eyes. \"Not their color. His regard — the way he looks with them. They’re very alive,\" she said.\n\n1991 — Patrick Swayze\n\nWhen \"Dirty Dancing\" star Swayze was named the Sexiest Man Alive in 1991, his mom, Patsy Swayze, told the magazine that her son \"knows he’s just an ordinary, down-home Texas kid.\"\n\n“He doesn’t think that his job deserves all that idolatry — if you want to call it that,\" she added.\n\nSwayze's \"Ghost\" co-star Demi Moore singled out Swayze's \"gentle\" personality as one of his finest qualities. \"He has a very sweet, gentle, kind heart, and those Southern manners,” Moore told People. “But he’s also got a very rugged, animalistic physique.”\n\n1992 — Nick Nolte\n\nNolte reportedly had a hard time believing he'd been named the Sexiest Man Alive. When the magazine notified the \"Prince of Tides\" star of his win, he responded \"Are you sure you didn’t make a mistake? My personal choice is Walter Cronkite,\" according to the Associated Press.\n\n1993 — Richard Gere and Cindy Crawford\n\nIn 1993, instead of naming a sexiest man, People named a Hollywood power couple the “Sexiest Couple Alive.” Supermodel Cindy Crawford, then 27, and actor Richard Gere, then 44, were a “laid-back duo” at the time. They’d go on to split up a year later.\n\n“Richard loves me without my makeup and in my ponytail,” Crawford told the outlet at the time. “So, hey, if it’s good enough for him, it’s good enough for me.”\n\n1994 — Keanu Reeves*\n\nTechnically, People didn’t name anyone the sexiest man (or couple) alive in the year of 1994. However, in 2015, the magazine righted that wrong. Then the editorial director, Jess Cagle, retroactively handed Keanu Reeves the title.\n\n1995 — Brad Pitt\n\nPitt won his first Sexiest Man Alive title — yep, there would be more — in 1995 when he was one of Hollywood's most eligible bachelors.\n\nIn 2011, the \"Legends of the Fall\" star later told Entertainment Weekly that winning the honor threw him for a loop.\n\n“I was really uncomfortable. What does it mean? What are you talking about?” said Pitt, “I’ve always been mistrustful of my own hubris, and it put me on guard. Like, it was dangerous. What do they say? Don’t believe your own hype.”\n\nHe added, \"When you get older, you realize it’s just for fun. (George) Clooney and I were able to have fun with it later. But in some ways, I’m still a kid from Missouri and Oklahoma and I’m trying to find my way. By the way, we’re only talking about a blip. I didn’t spend much time thinking about it.\"\n\n1996 — Denzel Washington\n\nWashington proved to be humble when he won the title in 1996. “I don’t take myself too seriously,” he told People at the time. “I don’t stop in the mirror and go, ‘Hey, Sexy Man.’”\n\nWashington's \"Courage Under Fire\" co-star Regina Taylor summed up his appeal for the publication. \"He has wit, style and intelligence,\" said Taylor.\n\n1997 — George Clooney\n\nLike his buddy Pitt, Clooney has also won the title twice, the first time in 1997.\n\n“The rap on George is that he’s this rake, this guy’s guy,” his \"ER\" costar Laura Innes told People for Clooney's cover story. “That’s true, but he is also a dear, loyal friend who would do anything for you. It’s almost like being a family member.”\n\n1998 — Harrison Ford\n\n\"Star Wars\" and \"Indiana Jones\" franchise star Ford won the title in 1998 when he was 56. \"Why this sudden outpouring for geezers?” the famously gruff actor asked People at the time. “I never feel sexy. I have a distant relationship with the mirror.”\n\n1999 — Richard Gere\n\nAfter winning a \"Sexiest Couple\" title with then-wife Cindy Crawford in 1993, Gere won the Sexiest Man Alive title on his own six years later when he was 50.\n\nSome of the \"Pretty Woman\" star's former girlfriends talked to People about Gere's appeal. \"He walked like a biker, and that attracted me. I knew I was going to get my hands on him. I seduced him,\" recalled designer Diane Von Furstenberg.\n\n2000 — Brad Pitt\n\nPitt was named the Sexiest Man Alive for the second time in 2000, becoming the first man to earn the title twice.\n\n2001 — Pierce Brosnan\n\nBrosnan won the title in 2001 during the years he was portraying James Bond on the silver screen.\n\nJulianna Margulies, Brosnan's co-star in the drama \"Evelyn,\" told People at the time that the Irish actor's sexiest quality was his love of his family. \"When you see a gorgeous man holding hands with his wife and holding his baby, there’s nothing more sexy in the world,\" she said.\n\n2002 — Ben Affleck\n\nAffleck was in the midst of his first romance with future wife Jennifer Lopez when he was crowned with the Sexiest title in 2002.\n\nKevin Smith, who directed Affleck and Lopez in \"Jersey Girl,\" tried to explain his longtime pal's appeal to People at the time. \"Chicks gravitate to him,” said Smith. “The word on the street is that he’s the ideal man, chatty, gorgeous, generous and intelligent.”\n\n2003 — Johnny Depp\n\nDepp first won the title in 2003 and would win it again six years later, becoming the third celebrity to win the honor more than once.\n\n2004 — Jude Law\n\nBritish star Law won the tile in 2004 after starring in \"The Talented Mr. Ripley,\" \"Cold Mountain\" and more blockbuster hits.\n\nLaw's \"I (Heart) Huckabees\" co-star Naomi Watts gushed about the actor's good looks to People at the time. \"He’s the most beautiful man who ever walked the earth — an absolutely perfect oil painting.”\n\n2005 — Matthew McConaughey\n\nIn the early aughts, actor Matthew McConaughey was predominantly a romantic comedy star, appearing in films like \"How to Lose A guy in 10 Days,\" \"The Wedding Planner\" and \"Failure to Launch.\"\n\nIn an interview with People at the time, he gave them some colorful quotes like “I’ve got no trouble making a tree house.”\n\n\"I will be the first to find the groove,\" he also told the outlet. \"I mix some salsa moves in. No lessons; all freestyle.\"\n\nHe'd go on to marry Camila Alves McConaughey in 2012 and they've welcomed three children together.\n\n2006 — George Clooney\n\nClooney won the coveted title for a second time in 2006. He was only the second man to do so at the time, following Brad Pitt.\n\n“This one’s going to be hard for Brad (Pitt) since he’s been Sexiest Man Alive twice. He’s enjoyed that mantle,\" Clooney joked at the time. \"I’d say ‘Sexiest Man Alive’ to him and he’d go, ‘Two-time.’ So that’s been taken away. We used to call him Two Time.
