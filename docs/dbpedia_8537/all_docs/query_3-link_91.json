        "text": "Stephen R. Covey’s book, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, continues to be a bestseller for the simple reason that it ignores trends and pop psychology and focuses on timeless principles of fairness, integrity, honesty, and human dignity.\n\nOne of the most compelling books ever written, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, has empowered and inspired readers for over 30 years. It’s also played a part in the transformation of millions of lives across all age groups and professions.\n\nNo matter how competent a person is, they will not have sustained and lasting success unless they can effectively lead themselves, influence, engage and collaborate with others and continuously improve and renew their capabilities. These elements are at the heart of personal, team, and organizational effectiveness."
