        "text": "PEOPLE magazine, which averaged 3.3 million in weekly sales in the third quarter, will begin a trade campaign on Monday with the theme ''Nothing grabs people like People.''\n\nIt is planned as the first sustained campaign since ''The many sides of People'' effort signed off in March. While there has been an occasional ad since then, there has been no continuing communication with the advertising community.\n\n''We are trying to explain a position for the magazine,'' said Donald M. Elliman Jr., publisher of People for two years, ''We are trying to explain the demographics of the magazine and why it appeals to people.''\n\nThe headline on the lead ad should have a familiar ring: ''The pause that refreshes.'' It addresses the matter of leisure time and how the hard worker of today has a limited amount of it. The People approach - short articles and lots of photos - should be ideal for such people, one would think.\n\nAnd, Mr. Elliman said, the campaign will seek to show that People is not - as many think - purely about the world of show biz and has, in fact, turned away from heavy coverage of that tinselly sector.\n\n''We are trying to explain what we are to our readers to our advertisers,'' he said. ''I believe we have the strongest reader franchise in magazines, and we hope to explain why that is.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
