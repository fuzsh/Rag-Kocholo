        "text": "When you’re a celebrity, even if you haven’t been in the spotlight in a while, there will be some people out there who want to know all your business. Sometimes, this is a good thing. In fact, it can be a very good thing. When you have something to promote or a new property is about to launch, you want to get some eyes on you and your brand.\n\nOf course, sometimes you just want your life to be a bit more private than that. Especially, the painful parts. This dichotomy can catch up with entertainers, causing some to lose their cool and others to try to block out the world even when they need to be out being “seen.”\n\nThen there are those who seem to understand, take it in stride and know how to respond to less than positive press or intrusive storytelling with style and grace. Enter Jennifer Garner, who recently put on a clinic in responding with class.\n\nPeople Magazine recently ran a cover story about Garner and her life after splitting with her ex, actor and director Ben Affleck. The story under the headline “Jennifer Garner: Life After Heartbreak” quoted unnamed “sources” who dished on what Jen is up to after breaking it off with Ben. Their divorce was finalized this past April.\n\nNow, it appears that Garner didn’t have anything to do with the article, and she could have pitched an absolute fit over the magazine dragging her private business out into the public without her consent. Instead, Garner jumped on social media to have her – polite, classy and upbeat – say about the who thing:\n\n“It has been brought to my attention that there is a People magazine cover and article out today that appear to be coming from me… This isn’t a tragedy by any measure, but it does affect me and my family, and so, before my mom’s garden club lights up her phone, I wanted to set the record straight: I did not pose for this cover. I did not participate in or authorize this article. While we are here, for what it’s worth: I have three wonderful kids, and my family is complete. Have a beautiful day…”\n\nPeople quickly responded to the unmentioned accusation in Garner’s comments, telling CNN: “PEOPLE covers Hollywood stars beloved by our audience, and our story on Jennifer Garner is fair and truthful… We wish her well.”\n\nNot exactly an apology, but definitely a confirmation that Ms. Garner was caught off guard by the story, and didn’t really expect her business to be put out there in the public square. Bottom line: well done and good form, Ms. Garner, and best of luck in your life and career going forward.\n\nAbout Ronn Torossian"
