        "text": "Tess Holliday, the size 22 supermodel who was signed to MiLK Model Management in January, has yet another reason to celebrate. She's the cover star of People magazine's 2015 body issue.\n\nHolliday, who is known for serving up style and self-love on her Instagram account, has had a busy few months. She is the face of Torrid's spring campaign and is responsible for the widely used #effyourbeautystandards hashtag, empowering women to wear whatever they want -- regardless of their shape.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 29-year-old beauty, who first tried to get into modeling 14 years ago, has encountered her fair share of obstacles. In her interview with People, she explains that not only was she turned down by the industry, she also faced bullying at school.\n\nStill, Holliday pushed forward, and it's that resilience which has led to her success. \"I just knew that I could do it,\" she said. \"I wasn't the best, and I still am not the best. The key to it is just doing it.\"\n\nAdvertisement"
