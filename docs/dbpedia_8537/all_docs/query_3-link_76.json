        "text": "The New Yorker is a magazine that is published weekly and reports on multiple topics such as: business, politics, international affairs, and technology. After researching the reader demographics of this magazine I’ve come to discover who actually reads The New Yorker. The statistics I found on the reader demographic consisted of age, sex, social economic background, education and political views. When this magazine was first created in 1925, the publishers had a target group of readers that they were attempting to reach out to, still today the same group of readers are targeted.\n\nIn this Time Magazine article, writer Fred Ritchen debates the merit of violent photos in media. He begins with the events that prompted him to write this essay. He lists “A recent slew of situations resulting in catastrophic violence and death” (Ritchen, p1). This grouping of events, ranging from disease to plane crashes, has brought to light again the question of what a journalist’s duty is in reference of how much of a horror to show and how much to keep from the public. Ritchen’s argument culminates to the fact that the space taken up by showing these horrors of war and similar atrocities could be better used to prevent further events.\n\nMagazines have implicitly and explicitly been influencing humans for decades. They are continually more involved in the media, however the market is highly competitive. It is extremely important for magazines to maintain the readers’ interest and loyalty therefore they must excel in its appearance and content. Helen Brown created the Cosmopolitan magazine in 1965. It holds a spot as one of the most successful women’s magazines of all time, and proceeds to be the number one selling monthly magazine. (Ouellette, 360, 2005).\n\nIdentify and define the psychological construct you have chosen to use. Identify the medium that the construct is evident in and give a brief summary of the story and/or plot of the medium. Explain in detail how the construct is used in the story, play, show, etc. Conclude by identifying what you believe are the good or bad aspects or results of the construct you observe.\n\nThe audience for this magazine is generally women, as they are targeting them with their clever and adept choice in titles as well as their diction used. These articles are ‘hot topics’ and will never grow old. “How I Lost 30 LBS! (and got my life back)” is one of the main cover articles that obtain the attention of a great majority of women. This is because many women in today’s society feel they are overweight and/or can improve on their health by losing extra body fat. Furthermore, this article easily gets woman's’ attention with the title of the article, which says how she lost the weight. As a result, many women will buy this magazine to be similar to Jennie Garth and have a new, hot, and improved body. Another article in this magazine is “Anne Hathaway’s Sunset Wedding”, is another cover article in this magazine, this article grabs the attention of many people, who are wanting to get married, or have already been married. Furthermore, after the title in states ‘all details inside’. This creates suspense and a cliffhanger great enough to persuade somebody to purchase this magazine. Another featured article is “How My Heart Attack Saved My Life”. Before this title, in a brightly colored red box it states ‘exclusive’ boldly. This then creates the idea that People magazine is the only place to read this article. In summary through a clever written titles, that\n\nThe first skill of idealized influence is the “ability of the leader to build loyalty and commitment within others by building a sense of mission, without consideration of their own self-needs” (Ghadi & Fernando, 2013, p.535). To build loyalty among followers, “the leader will have to strengthen mutual confidence, respect and trust” (Doody & Doody, 2012, p.2). As a leader, I will first have to show confidence in my decision-making as well as my vision that I am exuding. Idealized influence is the ability of the leader to build commitment within their followers, which is influenced by self-confidence, respect and trust. Involving followers and asking for their advice will help to instil a sense of mutual respect and trust. For the leader to be effective in influencing their followers, they must also have charisma, defined by Doody & Doody\n\nArthur Baldwin Turnure, the American business man established the company in 1892. The magazine was first sponsored by Kristoffer Wright, the first issue was published the 17 of December in 1892 with a cover price of 10 cents (equivalent to $2.67 in 2016). After his death in 1909 Conde Nast took over the magazine and slowly built up its publications. The original intention of Vogue was to become most beautiful and tasteful magazine that had ever occurred. He started Vogue overseas in the 1910’s.\n\nSocial media has become a prominent part of life for many young people today. Most people engage with social media without stopping to think of its influence on our lives, whether positive or negative. What will the long term effects of today's social media use be for our youth? Social media has revolutionised how most of us communicate, especially regarding young people, even in the most remote Indigenous communities in Australia youth culture is being reshaped through digital technologies. Young people are provided with a range of positive opportunities to maintain social connections and support via online social networks as well as learning and participating with a multitude of interests. Along with these opportunities there are also risks associated with social media such as social isolation or loss of privacy as well as cyberbullying and self-esteem pressures. We need to develop the opportunities offered by digital and social media to promote learning and wellbeing for our youth that is inclusive of young people’s input and ideas."
