Ask a Librarian!\n\nREMEMBER: Most websites would be considered popular sources.\n\nSome exceptions might be research published on the website of a scientific organization (like the National Institutes of Health, or NASA) or scholarly articles found via sources like Google Scholar or the library databases.\n\nWhile websites can contain useful and reliable information, they are rarely written by scholars and researchers (and can be written by anybody, including people who know nothing about a topic and are just selling something or expressing an opinion). Be careful to particularly evaluate any information you find on the web to determine if it is credible.\n\nUse our guide on Evaluating Websites and Other Sources to help, or ask a librarian!"
