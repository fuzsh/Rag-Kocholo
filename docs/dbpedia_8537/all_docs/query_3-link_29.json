Patrick Dempsey currently holds the crown.\n\nBrad Pitt, George Clooney, Johnny Depp, and Richard Gere have each been selected twice.\n\nSign up to get the inside scoop on today’s biggest stories in markets, tech, and business — delivered daily.

He has also starred in beloved movies like \"Sweet Home Alabama,\" \"Enchanted,\" and its 2022 sequel \"Disenchanted.\"\n\n2022: Chris Evans\n\nChris Evans is best known for playing Captain America in the MCU, although he officially hung up his shield following \"Avengers: Endgame\" in 2019.\n\nHe has also starred in celebrated films like \"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,\" \"Snowpiercer,\" and \"Knives Out.\"\n\n\"This whole thing is tough to be interviewed about. It feels like a weird form of humble bragging,\" he told People of the honor.\n\n\"My mom will be so happy,\" he added. \"She's proud of everything I do but this is something she can really brag about.\"\n\n2021: Paul Rudd\n\nPaul Rudd's breakthrough role came in 1995, starring opposite Alicia Silverstone in the popular coming-of-age drama \"Clueless.\"\n\nHe rose through Hollywood primarily as a comedic actor, starring in films like \"Wet Hot American Summer,\" \"Knocked Up,\" and \"Anchorman.\" He also portrayed prominent reoccurring characters in beloved TV shows \"Friends\" and \"Parks and Recreation.\"\n\nMore recently, Rudd is widely known for his role as Ant-Man in the MCU, as well as the critically acclaimed Netflix original series \"Living With Yourself.\"\n\nThe 52-year-old actor said his wife was \"stupefied\" when he received People's coveted crown.\n\n\"I'm hoping now that I'll finally be invited to some of those sexy dinners with Clooney and Pitt and B Jordan,\" he told the magazine. \"And I figure I'll be on a lot more yachts.
