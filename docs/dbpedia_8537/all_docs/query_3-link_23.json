        "text": "A year after referring to himself as \"Fat Batman,\" Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce is among those featured in one of those most coveted aesthetics magazines of the year.\n\nPeople Magazine's annual Sexiest Man Alive issue is set to be released soon, and Kelce is one of the six men that the publication revealed is part of this year's edition.\n\n\"Despite soaring fame from his New Heights podcast with brother Travis and his Prime Video documentary,\" People Magazine wrote, \"the Philadelphia Eagles’ star center, 36, keeps it real as a husband and father of three: 'We’re just trying to have fun.'\"\n\nKelce had a funny reaction on X -- the app formerly known as Twitter -- saying \"Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.\"\n\nAlso set to be featured in the magazine this year are actor Pedro Pascal, actor Timothée Chalamet, singer Lenny Kravitz, do-it-all entertainer Jamie Foxx and singer Usher, the final of whom is set to take the stage during halftime of Super Bowl LVIII.\n\nIt is increasingly clear that while the Kelce brothers remain All-Pro caliber players, they have their eyes on post-career opportunities beyond getting busts in Canton.\n\nTheir aforementioned podcast has been a great success. Jason has appeared on SportsRadio 94 WIP, NFL Network and attended the broadcasting bootcamp last offseason, so a media career might be in the five-time All-Pro's future. Meanwhile, Travis, of course, is dating Taylor Swift, hosted \"Saturday Night Live\" last offseason and is seemingly on every other commercial you watch.\n\nEach of them may be in the latter stages of their playing careers, but both Kelce brothers may be even more relevant after they hang up their spikes."
