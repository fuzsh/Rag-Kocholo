WHO WE ARE

Born in Milan, Brand of People Magazine is a digital space that curates galvanizing content for creatives & culture-makers globally. It’s based in the belief that creative acts are crucial to driving meaningful change in the world, and that comparing notes with creators enables us to build a collaborative, inclusive culture that transcends international borders and ideologies.

People are what make things interesting and worthwhile, and these people thrive when they prioritize originality in their art.

We’re also just trying to answer some very zeitgeisty questions like…how does today’s rampant Culture of Branding affect our ability to produce honest art? Is the distinction between personal branding and public presence increasingly artificial in the age of social media? What catalyzes creators to do their best work? We want to be a part of that.

WHO CREATORS ARE

This label needlessly intimidates a lot of people who have been conditioned by their experiences to believe that they are “not creative.” You don’t have to be an acclaimed freehand sketch artist or headline a gallery exhibition to be a creator!

Simply put, creators are people who work to build a more beautiful world. Maybe it’s a day job, a weekend hustle, a recreational pursuit, or a full-fledged passion. The “when” is insignificant compared to the power of coaxing ideas to life, and we want to hear from and speak to the doers & makers bringing beauty and nuance to the chaotic realities of contemporary existence.

To be a creator is to be part of an inclusive and unifying force for positivity across an array of fields. Creatives see the world for what it is, while their work brings it closer to what it could be.
