        "text": "Here are 13 rock and metal acts who have been banned by countries.\n\nRock and roll and heavy metal are no strangers to controversy and censorship. Ever since Elvis Presley's suggestive hip moves led to his being filmed from the waist up on his January 6th, 1957 appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show, authority figures have tried to prevent young minds from being corrupted by rock stars and their music.\n\nAs the years have progressed, so has much of the world's views of rock music, its themes and outrageous antics.
