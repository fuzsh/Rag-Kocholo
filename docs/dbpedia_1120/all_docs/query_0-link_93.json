Getting featured in algorithmic playlists like Discover Weekly and Release Radar is even more crucial as that’s where most of the world discovers new music every day!\n\nKnowing how Spotify’s algorithm works can help artists gain more exposure and increase streams. Here are some interesting figures associated with Spotify’s algorithm:\n\nThe first 30 seconds of a track matter to Spotify’s algorithm the most.\n\nIf a listener gets past the 30-second mark of a track – that’s a positive bit of data for Spotify. That’s also the point where a stream is monetized. (We will talk about streams and their monetization later in this post!)\n\nThe first couple of days (especially 12 to 24 hours) after your release are crucial. Spikes in listeners, low skip rates, and listening times matter most in the initial days after the release.\n\nHow much is a track shared and on which platform also matter a lot to Spotify. Spotify showed this data to its artists in its 2022 wrap. You can check Spotify For Artists if you are an artist and need official resources to grow!\n\nHow Much Does Spotify Pay Per Stream\n\nIf you are wondering how much Spotify pays per stream, it is generally between $0.003 and $0.005 per play.\n\nBelow are the rough estimates of Spotify’s streaming payouts to artists based on the above data:\n\nThis amount is subject to variation based on several factors, such as the location of the listener and the currency used. However, as a general rule, the payout is based on a 70/30 split between the rights holders and the platform. That means 70% of the revenue generated from each stream goes to the rights holders, while the remaining 30% is retained by Spotify.\n\nAlthough Spotify’s payout may seem small, it can add up quickly, particularly for popular artists with a large pool of monthly listeners. We have discussed the most streamed artists of all time and the current month in this post below; scroll down to see it!\n\nHow Much Data Does Spotify Use\n\nSome users might be curious about how much data is consumed when they are streaming songs on Spotify.\n\nWell, on the lowest quality setting, Spotify uses around 600 kilobytes (KBs), or a little more than half a megabyte, per song. However, if you’re looking for higher-quality audio, the data usage can increase significantly. For example, at high quality, Spotify uses up to 4.2MB per song, and for Spotify Premium subscribers, the “Very High setting” can consume up to 8.4MB per song.\n\nSo If you’re listening to a full 12-song album, this can add up to around 50MB of data usage, or 100MB if you’re on a Premium account.\n\nNote: These numbers are based on a song with a length of three and a half minutes as it is the average length of songs in 2023.\n\nSpotify Podcast Statistics\n\nSpotify began its podcasting journey three years ago, with a database of over 180,000 episodes.
