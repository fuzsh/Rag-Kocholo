        "text": "With four unique choirs, Eastman provides numerous opportunities to perform choral repertoire ranging from Renaissance masterworks to premieres of 21st century works. Voice students may sing as part of the ensembles or as soloists. Throughout the year, audition opportunities are posted frequently. Students have auditioned for solo parts in Mozart’s Requiem, Beethoven’s Mass in C Major, Schumann’s Requiem für Mignon, Handel’s Messiah, Mendelssohn’s Elijah, Britten’s War Requiem and Bach’s St. Matthew Passion.\n\nThe four choirs at Eastman are:\n\nVoice students at Eastman enjoy a program designed to meet their individual goals and needs. There is a wonderful dynamic at Eastman that seeks students in voice and all instrumentalists to create music together.\n\nEastman is home to the best instrumentalists in the country, those who will populate the orchestras in the very near future. During the time spent at Eastman, the singers will discover many opportunities to collaborate with these outstanding players for special projects, recital performances and premieres.\n\nThe faculties in each discipline respect and enjoy each other and are eager to work together. In recitals and independent projects, singers can collaborate with instrumentalists from Bach arias with obbligato instruments to very recent compositions calling for a great variety of instruments. Singers become part of the musics of many disciplines, adding the profundity of text to the music that normally express without words; This collaboration sparks interests in the players and singers that lasts a lifetime.\n\nOpportunities include singing with chamber groups, small and large orchestra, and perhaps most adventurous, collaborating with the composition department, faculty and students, to create new works.\n\nThe voice faculty and the instrumental faculties at Eastman believe in making music together. The faculty models this in concerts and gives the time and extra effort it takes to join forces to create and experience joining our musical worlds.\n\nThe Eastman School of Music has a proud tradition of master classes. We have invited master teachers from all over the world who have been eager to come to the school. They hail from a variety of disciplines in the profession including singers, accompanists, directors, composers, and diction coaches. Without exception, they have been impressed with the talent, energy, and collegiality in our department and have left thrilled with our students’ accomplishments..\n\nThe following is a partial list of guests:"
