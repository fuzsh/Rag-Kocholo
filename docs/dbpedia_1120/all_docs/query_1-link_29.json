        "text": "Considering several seminude celebs (Beyoncé, for starters) and SJP’s Fire Dragon hat, stars in attendance at last night’s Costume Institute Benefit Gala at the Metropolitan Museum of Art dressed in liberal interpretations of the event’s theme, China: Through the Looking Glass.\n\nSome ensembles—think Rihanna’s quasi–Disney princess gold cape from Chinese designer Guo Pei, complete with a sweeping gold headpiece—were outrageous, while others (J.Lo’s bum was almost completely bare) hardly covered some ladies’ assets. But the jewelry they wore, however, celebrated taste and style as only precious materials can: through classic themes like Art Deco–inspired diamond styles and contemporary karat-gold fan and tassel effects, to name a few.\n\nPlatinum drop earrings and diamond bracelets also had a big night at the charity benefit. Actress Jaime King (above) wore Forevermark drop earrings in platinum, a Forevermark line bracelet in platinum, and another line bracelet in platinum with Forevermark diamonds by Galili and Co., while reality star and model Kendall Jenner wore platinum and diamond drop earrings from Chopard, and actress and event cochair Jennifer Lawrence wore a platinum and diamond bracelet ca. 1929 from Cartier. Meanwhile, Empire’s Taraji P. Henson wore an Art Deco platinum bracelet with diamonds from Fred Leighton, and pop star Selena Gomez wore platinum and diamond briolette earrings and an Art Deco geometric bracelet in platinum, both by Lorraine Schwartz.\n\nChinese themes like dragons and fans and the color red also had a strong showing. Model Jessica Hart wore ruby fan earrings in gold from Sutra and a yellow gold dragon bracelet and yellow gold ring from Carrera y Carrera, while actress and singer Zendaya wore a diamond snake ring from Pasquale Bruni. Jennifer Lopez also wore fan earrings with rubies from Sutra, as well as a ruby ring from Ivy. Model Karolina Kurkova stunned in a red Asian-inspired mini-dress with mother-of-pearl and diamond Lotus Flower earrings that had a fan effect from Fred Leighton. Fringe and tassel were evident on Kate Beckinsale in yellow gold and black onyx fringe drops from Carrera y Carrera, Sienna Miller in custom-made silk tassel earrings with diamonds, South Sea pearls, and black onyx from Jacob & Co., and Masters of Sex actress Lizzy Caplan in gold fringe earrings from Jack Vartanian.\n\nAnd no Asian-inspired evening could be complete without some jade. Who brought it? Model Chrissy Teigen in jade, diamond, and pearl earrings by Fred Leighton and Lady Gaga in coral, black jade, and diamond earrings also from Fred Leighton.\n\nThankfully, when the couture disappoints—WTH was going on with actress Kerry Washington’s bizarre boxy pink Prada gown?—jewelry fans know they can count on nature’s bounty of rocks and metal to elevate celebrity affairs.\n\nFollow JCK on Instagram: @jckmagazine\n\nFollow JCK on Twitter: @jckmagazine\n\nFollow JCK on Facebook: @jckmagazine"
