        "text": "The grand final of the 68th Eurovision Song Contest takes place in Malmo, Sweden, on Saturday, May 11. The international songwriting competition is famed for its exuberant performances. However, this year has sparked controversy and protests related to the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nPerformers from countries across Europe—and beyond—competed in two televised semi-finals earlier this week. The hotly-anticipated final will see the winner crowned by a combination of votes from viewers around the world and rankings by juries in the music industry. The 2023 contest reached 162 million viewers around the world. In the U.S., viewers can stream the 2024 final live on Peacock, according to Associated Press.\n\nDean Vuletic, a leading historian on Eurovision, calls the contest “a show of cultural diversity unlike any other,” during a video call with TIME.\n\nRead More: Dutch Contestant Disqualified From Eurovision Song Contest Hours Before Final\n\nEurovision cemented its new slogan “United by Music” in late 2023 and organizers insist the contest is non-political. But this year’s contest has sparked outrage from pro-Palestinian protesters who have criticized organizers for allowing Israel to participate in the contest.\n\nTIME has compiled 10 surprising facts about the history of the Eurovision Song Contest, notable past winners, controversies, and more.\n\nEurovision originally started off as a technical experiment in television broadcasting\n\nOrganizers wanted to see if they could hold a live, simultaneous, transnational broadcast across Europe. The very first contest was held on May 24, 1956, and only seven countries participated: the Netherlands, Switzerland, Belgium, Germany, France, Luxembourg, and Italy, according to the Eurovision website.\n\n“It really was a showcase of the different musical cultures, popular musical cultures, in Europe,” Vuletic tells TIME.“I think this is why it has continued to attract the fascination of Europeans ever since.”\n\nThe contest has increased in popularity and size since then. Now watched by viewers around the world, this year’s competition features performers from 37 countries.\n\nA Holocaust survivor represented Germany at the first contest in 1956\n\nWalter Andreas Schwarz, a Jewish Holocaust survivor, competed for Germany at the first Eurovision. He ended up finishing second overall.\n\nVuletic says this shows that “countries were already using Eurovision as cultural diplomacy from the very first contest.”\n\nThe term “Eurovision” comes from a British journalist\n\nGeorge Campey—who later joined the BBC, where he held a number of senior roles—was a journalist at the London Evening Standard when he was writing an article about European television in November 1951.\n\n“It came about partly by accident,” Campey said in a previous interview with the BBC.\n\nAs Campey was typing, he wondered how he could get the phrase “European television” into a headline. He started typing “Euro” and then combined it with “vision.” The newspaper printed the phrase. The “catchy term” eventually caught on, Vuletic tells TIME.\n\nThe contest broke a world record\n\nIn 2015, the Guinness Book of World Records recognized Eurovision as the Longest Running Annual TV Music Competition. The contest has only ever been canceled once—in 2020, because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n2024 is the 50th anniversary of ABBA’s Eurovision win\n\nThe pop supergroup represented Sweden in 1974 and performed the song “Waterloo.” It was the first time Sweden won the contest, according to the Eurovision website. ABBA went on to enjoy widespread international success, with their songs immortalized in the popular musical Mamma Mia! and the accompanying films.\n\nOlivia Newton-John also competed at Eurovision\n\nAlso in 1974, the singer known for her role as Sandy in Grease represented the U.K. at the international singing competition, according to the Eurovision website. She performed the song “Long Live Love,” placing fourth overall.\n\nRead More: Eurovision Organizers Reprimand Performers for Wearing Pro-Palestinian Symbols\n\nCeline Dion won Eurovision in 1988\n\nThe Canadian singer represented Switzerland in 1988, according to Associated Press. Dion competed with the song “Ne Partez Pas Sans Moi.” She’s another example of a Eurovision winner who went on to become a huge success in North America, Vuletic says.\n\nIt “may sound strange because, you know, we talk about artists representing their own countries in Eurovision; that’s what usually happens,” Vuletic tells TIME. “But there is actually no rule requiring an artist to be a citizen of the country that it represents.”\n\nA Eurovision song was the very first winner of the Song of the Year and Record of the Year at the inaugural Grammy Awards in 1959\n\nRepresenting Italy, Domenico Modugno performed “Nel Blu Dipinto Di Blu (Volare)” at the 1958 Eurovision and placed third overall. The song has since been covered by renowned musicians like David Bowie and Paul McCartney, according to Reuters.\n\nIreland and Sweden are the countries with the most wins\n\nThe two countries have each won Eurovision seven times, more than any other participating country, according to BBC. Cyprus, meanwhile, has entered the competition the most times with the least wins (they have yet to win).\n\nNot all participating countries are in Europe\n\nIn order to participate in the contest, a country has to be an active member of the European Broadcasting Union, which organizes Eurovision, so eligibility is not solely dependent on geography. Australia, for instance, has participated in Eurovision since 2015."
