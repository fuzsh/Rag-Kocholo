        "text": "Sustained cooperation and the advancement of participants are key priorities for Clarry Bartha. Her wish is that during the competition week they should have a chance to develop in a friendly atmosphere of healthy competitive pressure and gain valuable experience as they embark on what will hopefully be a long and successful professional career.\n\nClarry Bartha sees the ability to arouse other people’s emotions with human voices – and to perceive such emotions in oneself – as a tremendous gift. DEBUT’s objective is to serve up-and-coming talents with distinctive voices as a springboard to the big stage and a future career.\n\nAdrian Mocanu is a composer born in 1989 in Kyiv. He was studying music composition at the National Music Academy of Ukraine and carried out his postgraduate studies at Centro Superior de Enseñanza Musical Katarina Gurska in Madrid, Spain.\n\nHe received the ‘Gaude Polonia’ scholarship of the Ministry of Culture of Poland and was taking classes at the Fryderyk Chopin University of Music in Warsaw in 2019, and in 2022 was granted a scholarship of the Academy of Fine Arts of Paris for an artistic residency at Casa de Velázquez - the Academy of France in Madrid. He became the composer-in-residence of the Juventudes Musicales of Spain for the 2023/24 season and carried out an artistic residency at The Green Room for Performing Artists in Cologne. In 2024, he was granted the Weltoffenes Berlin Scholarship of the Senate of Berlin.\n\nFor the 11th time in a row the DEBUT Classical Singing Competition was managed without any form of public funding. This is first and foremost the achievement of its initiator and founder, Dr. Manfred Wittenstein, Honorary Chairman of the Supervisory Board of WITTENSTEIN SE. His longstanding commitment – to providing opportunities to young soloists starting out on a musical career, networking them together and introducing them to a broad public – is meanwhile emulated by numerous other sponsors in the lovely Tauber Valley.\n\nBoth the qualifying rounds and the semifinal will take place against the historic backdrop of Weikersheim Castle while the location for the lieder recital will be the “Roter Saal” of the Deutschordensschlosses Bad Mergentheim . The week will end with the traditional gala concert and in the new TauberPhilharmonie in Weikersheim.\n\n6 arias, comprised of\n\n4 compulsory pieces taken from the aria repertoire\n\n2 of your own choice\n\nTwo out of the six arias to be sung during the qualifying rounds must be selected by the competitors. Arias in different languages and from different periods are desirable, and they may also include one operetta aria. All arias must be sung in the original language.\n\nAND\n\n5 lieder, comprised of\n\n1 compulsory, contemporary piece (composed especially for DEBUT), semi-final\n\n4 pieces of your own choice selected from the following composers:\n\nGerman Lied:\n\nArnold Schönberg, Paul Hindemith, Aribert Reimann, Erwin Schulhoff\n\nLieder from Eastern Europe and the Baltic States\n\nDora Pejačević, Zoltán Kodály, George Enescu, Pancho Vladigerov, Feliksas Bajoras, Bohuslav Martinů, Witold Lutosławski, Karol Szymanowski, Dmitri Schostakowitsch, Mieczysław Weinberg, Emīls Dārziņš\n\n(In the case of published German translations, these may also be sung)"
