It ranges from 16th-century vocal works to contemporary, folk and world music, and traditional collegiate songs. The ensemble is dedicated to presenting world premieres of commissioned works. It also holds a young competition twice per year.\n\nThe Glee Club has a deep commitment to advancing choral music around the world. Each year, they host their own International Choral Festival.

What makes this 70-member ensemble even more exclusive is that they perform music for only the tenor and bass vocal ranges.\n\nAnyone interested in becoming a member of the Glee Club takes on a lot of responsibility. The choir is a fully student-run organization. Students oversee every aspect of this ensemble. This includes booking engagements, marketing the ensemble, planning all tours, and normal choir operations. Prospective members should know that most tours happen each year during spring break.\n\nThe Glee Club was founded in March 1858 which makes it the oldest collegiate choir in America.

It was founded in 2003 and is under the direction of Barlow Bradford. This highly talented choir only has 32 singers, made up mainly of music majors, so the auditions are competitive. Add to that that each member receives $2,000 in scholarship money each year, and you can see why this is a tough ensemble to gain membership in.\n\nDespite being founded just over 20 years ago, this choir has gained a reputation for excellence very quickly. In only their second year together, the choir took the Grand Prize at the Florilège Vocal de Tours -International Choir Competition in France.
