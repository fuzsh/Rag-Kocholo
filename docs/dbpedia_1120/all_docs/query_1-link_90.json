        "text": "COLEEN Nolan and Shane Richie's son has returned to the stage with a stand-up show at Edinburgh Fringe Festival.\n\nHe talks about going from Universial Music to Universal Credit in 'Neporrhoids' - bringing the laughs by opening up on his career failures.\n\nOnce upon a time Jake, 32, was the lead singer of pop-rock band Rixton and was close pals with Justin Bieber and Ed Sheeran.\n\nHe toured with Ed and lived in his home, and was signed to Justin's controversial manager Scooter Braun.\n\nNow the singer and actor has discussed his epic fall from grace and said he was \"blown to smithereens\" when it all came crashing down - and he ended up signing on the dole.\n\nThe 32-year-old told The Times: \"We (Rixton) kicked off big time in America.\n\n\"We hung around with Biebs a fair bit.\n\n\"It’s your classic story of a teen pop star who gets it all and loses it all … [I had] an existential crisis at the end of my twenties … \"\n\nJake went on: \"The saddest thing was I was clinging on, trying to convince my friends and family that I was just taking a break.\n\n\"But the truth is that my calendar was blocked out every single day from the age of 18 until 23, 24 - and then just nothing.\n\n\"I’d never experienced failure in my whole life. Every audition I would go to I would get. It blew me to smithereens …\"\n\nJake was engaged to Little Mix star Jesy Nelson for a time, but they broke up in 2016.\n\n\"I broke up with Jesy and moved into Ed Sheeran’s house … I think he [Ed] just was just like, ‘I’m a bit worried about this dude,’\" he continued.\n\n\"A lot of people go to a beach in Thailand and drop acid - I just happened to do it in Ed Sheeran’s back garden … \"\n\nHe added: \"I’m hyper-aware that a lot of people who sign up for it [benefits] don’t have the safety nets that I have ...\"\n\nHe said he has more guilty thoughts now, adding: \"It’s only recently that I’ve started getting the guilt: ‘Oh s***, should I be here?' … [I] was only able to get good (at singing and acting) because of the privilege\".\n\nHis famous mum and dad divorced when he was nine years old.\n\nJake also appeared in the ITV soap Emmerdale where he played Hannah Barton's friend Isaac Nuttal between August and October 2010.\n\nTwo years ago he was recognised by a TikTok user in a bar, who filmed him and asked: \"\"hat are you up to now?\"\n\nJake replied: \"I'm on Universal Credit, and I live with my mum in her garage. I'm a failure.\"\n\nThe TikToker responded back saying: \"Firstly I'd like to say you are not a failure.\n\n\"Everyone goes through hardships in life and you will get through yours.\"\n\nJake smiled before saying: \"Thank you, you are a legend.\"\n\nJake has also appeared in the BBC musical film Rules of Love and ITV drama Scott and Bailey.\n\nJake says his dad Shane whose real name is Shane Roche, came from “absolutely nothing”.\n\nHe ran away from home in North-West London at 15 to become a Pontins blue coat, before auditioning for Grease and being turned down multiple times by Arlene Phillips.\n\nDoing the show helped Jake reconnect with Shane, who plays Alfie Moon in EastEnders.\n\nJake said he took inspiration from his dad's tough career path and it has made them \"extremely close\"."
