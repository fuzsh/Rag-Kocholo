Each level will be given a limited number of bubbles indicated beside the slingshot known as the bubble count. Sometimes, there are some obstacles and special blocks that appear at the top along with the bubbles. This game features a common live system that starts with 5 x . Each level attempt must have at least 1 life in order to play. When you run out of bubbles, there will be an option to continue by purchasing 12 x in exchange for 5 x and 1 x each time or to give up. When you give up, will lose one of the lives. Afterwards, you may retry or if available watch an advertisement video to earn free boost at the beginning of the next attempt. If you lost all the lives, you must get lives from friends ( ) or purchase with 10 x to continue playing. The game originally featured the five characters that appear in Angry Birds Stella formerly, and after the Hamhock Holmes update, 5 characters from The Angry Birds Movie and various classic Angry Birds games (including Stella as she is remained) were added. Each character will have a special power that can be used when the Pop Meter is full to unlock powerful boosts from their powers like Stella's Power Pop, Bomb's Blast Pop and many more . To fill the Pop Meter ( ), you have to get Streaks, that means popping 6 times in a row without a single miss. The levels are in different modes and each of them marked as an icon and the level number ( ). Each kind of level has music in the game that distinguishes different types of gameplay. When the level is completed, the number of stars ( ) and if Golden Feathers ( ) were achieved, will be shown on the map (refer to gallery).

The expiry timer is shown on the lives left meter.\n\nEvents\n\nFor a list of events, see Angry Birds POP!/Events\n\nCostumes\n\nCostumes can bought with gems to the birds as attires, they are available only for the main birds and are each for a specific set, which are:\n\nHero Set;\n\nHipster Set;\n\nWinter Set;\n\nNutcracker Set;\n\nPig Set;\n\nSaint Patrick's Day Set;\n\nEaster Set;\n\nMovie Set;\n\nHalloween Set;\n\nChristmas Set.\n\nTrivia\n\nThis game has the second most levels in the Angry Birds series, with 6,000 levels in total (as of June 2022). Angry Birds Dream Blast (over 9,550 levels) is the first, and Angry Birds 2 (over 3,320 levels), (as of June 2022) is the third.\n\nThis is the fifth Angry Birds game or spinoff without the use of birds on a slingshot.\n\nThis is the first Angry Birds game played in a vertical orientation.\n\nThere is a lives system in this game. It works similar to Candy Crush Saga as failing a level costs 1 live and recharging for 30 minutes each.\n\nThis is the first Angry Birds video game that does not have its own Toons.TV video app, formerly, and now it has its own.\n\nRed was the first bird to appear as a guest star twice.\n\nThis game is one of the four Angry Birds games that are available on Facebook. The other are Angry Birds Friends, Angry Birds for Facebook Messenger and Angry Birds: Flip the Bird.\n\nHowever, it's not available in Facebook anymore since December 21, 2016.\n\nIt is possible to get zero stars in levels, which means you fail the level. This makes the first Angry Birds game to do this. (Angry Birds Epic does not count because the game only gets zero stars on equipment.)\n\nSome of the Time-Limited Birds appeared in mobile devices, and are not available in the Facebook version.\n\nWhen losing the Drop the Pigs levels in the Facebook version, Red's voice sounds like Poppy.\n\nIn the Facebook version, if there is an error with the game, such as internet being disconnected or synchronization errors, you will lose a live if you are playing a level.\n\nSince the beginning of August 2022, there has been a log-in issue for users who saved their progress with Facebook. It was apparently caused by a change in the Meta (formally Facebook) API.[2][3][4] The issue has been fixed in mid-October of that same year.[5]\n\nMobile\n\nIn the 1.4.30 update, the player can choose between the bird required for the main level or Red when he was available for a limited time (from May 21, 2015, to June 3, 2015).\n\nRed is also the first playable male from this game.\n\nAlso, when playing with Red, you see a feather along with the stars. In order to get the feather, the player must complete the level with Red. The game actually says that \"the feathers might be valuable\"\n\nRed has been removed as of June 4, 2015, but the collected feathers still stay in the game.\n\nEven if removed, he still appears in the map while playing a guitar.\n\nThe Blues appeared in the 1.7.2 update as playable birds in the same manner as Red (available from July 6 to July 20). However, they require blue feathers.\n\nBlue feathers are earned in the same way as Red: by beating a certain score and completing the level.\n\nJust like Red, The Blues stay for 2 weeks straight, and after they're not going to be playable after the timer is out.\n\nChuck also appears in the game.\n\nSince v1.8.0 update, the Stella name was removed from the app store's title and the new name is Angry Birds POP!. It was probably due to the Stella game being discontinued.\n\nEven as v2.3.0 update, Red and Chuck are now permanent playable birds. Dahlia was a limited time bird at that time.\n\nBefore the v2.3.0 update, the limited time birds have their respective feathers. As of the said update, all of their feathers are now as of one- golden feathers.\n\nIn version 2.15, daily tasks were added. However, in this update, during the level gameplay, player may activate the bird boost instantly with coins on x3 to x5 streak.\n\nIn v2.11.2 mobile update, UI menus have changed.\n\nThe Hatchlings were introduced in v2.12.0. This was to promote the upcoming Angry Birds Movie.\n\nThe Blues were available on the June 23, 2016 for the second time as a part of summer treats for a limited time.\n\nThis is the second time the Hatchlings appear as the guest star twice. When the Hatchlings were first introduced, the player has to collect treats for a reward. In the second appearance of the Hatchlings, the player has to complete 3 daily tasks the same manner as Terence's Tasks to earn one part of the movie poster and a booster. Collect all 4 parts to complete a poster.\n\nIn version 3 onwards, the game assets can be accessed by extracting its archive.\n\nSome files in the assets folder are named as Gale_XX in the Defeat King Pig.\n\nThe episode ''Area 51'' is based on an actual highly classified top-secret government site.\n\n''Unidentified Flying Pigs'', ''Baconheart'', ''FreeeedHam!'' ''A Song of Eggs and Bacon'', and ''King Pig's Landing'' are based on ''UFO (unidentified flying object[s])'', Lionheart (Richard the Lionheart), Freedom, A Song of Ice and Fire, a series of novels by George R.R. Martin which inspired the Game of Thrones series, and King's Landing which is a location from Game of Thrones.\n\nThe concept of Stella and her friends venturing into a cave in pursuit of Gale was later brought back in the 3rd area of Angry Birds POP! (previously Angry Birds Stella POP!), \"Crystal Caves,\" which takes place in the same cave Angry Birds Stella ended on.[6]\n\nIn v1.3.0 Facebook update, Time Limited Birds were added.\n\nOn Facebook v 1.10.1, daily tasks were added, alongside with the movie posters. It was given 14 days instead of 30 on mobile devices.\n\nSome of the level numbers shown on the map were cut-off by the objects overlapping on them.\n\nShakira Bird is still on the map however, she is not animated.\n\nFacebook Discontinuation\n\nOn September 17, 2016, it was announced that the game on Facebook will be officially discontinued to continue with the mobile version of Angry Birds POP!. This game on Facebook closed on December 21, 2016. It was taken down on January 2, 2017, as stated on the Facebook page.\n\nGallery\n\nMain article: Angry Birds POP!/Gallery\n\nGallery\n\nFor this subject's image gallery, see gallery.\n\nVideos\n\nSoundtrack\n\nFor the soundtrack version, see Angry Birds POP!
