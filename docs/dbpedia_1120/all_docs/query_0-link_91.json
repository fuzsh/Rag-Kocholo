Our clients span the spectrum of business and private spheres.\n\nHometown: Basel, Switzerland\n\nAccent\n\nIn the increasingly popular world of a cappella singing groups, Accent has carved out its own niche. Inspired by the wizardly jazz harmonies of TAKE 6 and, before them, The Hi-Lo's, the six singers of Accent, all of them accomplished arrangers and instrumentalists in their own right, are taking their love of close-harmony jazz singing - the denser and more intricate the better - as far as it can go.\n\nAlti & Bassi\n\nThe ups and downs are a male vocal quintet specializes in a cappella jazz and swing, born in Milan in 1994. Sing \"a cappella\" means using only their voice, no musical instruments. Tops & Bottoms often imitate some, such as drums, bass, horns, guitars. The result is original and surprising: a mix of entertainment, music and culture.\n\nSince 1994 they have carried out an intense concert activity encouraged by local authorities, associations and institutions. Afternoons were guests of Music in Milan, the concert season of the Teatro Rossini in Pesaro, the review \"Night at Villa Simonetta in Milan, the Salone della Musica in Turin, the Italian Song Festival 40's / 50's Royal Palace in Turin, Umberto Giordano Festival in Baveno (VB), the San Remo Song Festival Jazz in Sanremo, S.

They represent Vocal Play, a style that uses human voice for making music in a way that transforms an a cappella performance into a rich vocal orchestra. Using only their vocal chords to replicate instruments, Audiofeels in fact become instruments to create an impression of an entire orchestra on stage. Their adventure began in the Adam Mickiewicz University Choir in Poznan, Poland where they met and where after years of singing together they decided to pursue their dreams in a different \"direction\".\n\nHometown: Poznan, Poland\n\nB Vocal\n\nThe group b vocal has been working for the last fifteen years in a surprising and innovative style: using just their voices, these five Aragonese musicians are able to recreate the soundscape of any musical piece (drums, guitars, brass, rhythm, etc.). With their entertaining shows, they have managed to popularize a cappella as a musical style in Spain through a perfect combination of songs and humour and a repertory of high quality music from both national and international sources\n\nOver the course of their career, they have often appeared on Spanish television: \"The season's nationwide programme presentation gala\" (Antena 3 Television), \"Gala for the draw of the Copa del Rey (King's Cup) for the ACB (basketball)\", El Conciertazo, La 2 News (TVE 2 and International Channel), \"This is my story\" (TVE 1 and International Channel) etc.\n\nHometown: Zaragoza, Spain\n\nBall In The House\n\nFollowing in the path of classic harmony groups like Boyz II Men, The Temptations, and Take 6, with a mix of the classic and the contemporary, the five-member vocal band Ball in the House brilliantly blends a wide range of influences, from classic R&B to pop, hip-hop & gospel. With their extensive tour schedule (averaging 250 dates a year), Ball in the House reaches millions and is arguably one of the hardest working, most successful indie bands today. They have performed with such artists as The Beach Boys, Gladys Knight, The Jonas Brothers, Jessica Simpson, Fantasia, Blondie, The Temptations, Smokey Robinson, KC & The Sunshine Band, Kool & the Gang, and numerous others. All a cappella, but a sound that will astound and amaze you. 5 Guys, 5 Voices, THAT'S IT... A review from the Boston Globe put it very succinctly - \"Ball in the House has everything you would expect to find in a successful pop/rock band....the one thing it doesn't have is instruments.\"\n\nHometown: Boston, MA\n\nBaSix\n\nWith a grand total of 4 international CARA awards, including \"Best European Album\" and \"Best Holiday Album\" the Danish vocal pop group Basix has proven themselves to be among the very best of a cappella groups worldwide.\n\nSpanning pop, jazz, r&b, soul, and rock and blending strong original compositions with innovative arrangements of timeless songs, these six Danish vocalists continue to amaze an ever-increasing number of listeners around the world.\n\nBasix strong vocal performance, which runs the whole gamut of emotions has dazzled audiences in a vast number of concert halls, theaters, clubs, cafes, churches, and at conferences and private events.\n\nHometown: Copenhagen, Denmark\n\nBlenders\n\nOriginally from Fargo, North Dakota, The Blenders are proud to call Minneapolis, Minnesota their home.

With an infectious energy and a good measure of wild stage antics, this cool cat rat pack of musical misfits is guaranteed to leave you shouting out for more.\n\n>Wherever they are performing, incredulous audiences are left raving about Cadence's instrumental imitations, vocal acrobatics, and charismatic stage presence.\n\nHometown: Toronto, Canada\n\nCat's Pajamas Vocal Band\n\nThe Cat's Pajamas are a five person a cappella group that has been touring around the world since 2005 and have recently been featured on Next Great American Band, America's Got Talent and season 3 of NBC's The Sing-Off.

Transforming Cohen's lyrics and simple melodies into complex 4- and 5-part harmonies, and with a wide variety of small ensemble and full choir pieces, Conspiracy of Beards achieves a sound that is both robust and tender.

Their dynamic stage shows and acclaimed innovative albums have all contributed to their recognition as the undisputed masters of their field. The group was first formed in 1982 by members of the 7:84 Theatre group, a socialist fringe theatre group who used acappella singing in a production called One Big Blow, the story of the 1982 miner's strike in England, from the miner's point of view. They enjoyed the singing so much that they started to work around the pubs and clubs of London, at a time when nobody else in the UK was performing pop/rock based acappella, and found immediate success. The first recording was a live show 'Live at the Albany Empire' on the group's own label, which sold so well that they soon came to the attention of Virgin Records, who signed the group in 1983.\n\nHometown: London, UK, England\n\nFuenf\n\nBe it with songs about sleep, neurodermatitis, a fondness for kitchen appliances or butcher Tom, the a cappella comedy pop proffered by Fuenf knows no bounds and goes straight for the jugular! The quintet has been singing harmoniously since 1995, albeit adopting some discordant subject matter. They've covered a lot of ground - both musically and across Germany, including as support band for the likes of Helge Schneider, Pur and Die Prinzen. In their new programme 'Charlie's Angels', once again Fuenf won't be mincing their words as they take their punning ways to new heights in search of the sacred vowel and on a mission to save the world - or at least rock it. It's high time they brought their musical repartee to Leipzig!\n\nHometown: Stuttgart, Germany\n\nGroove Barbers\n\nAn a cappella supergroup? Sounds paradoxical, absurd, perhaps even dangerous; indeed, The GrooveBarbers is all these things. Each member of this all-vocal powerhouse quartet is a bona fide star in his own right: Sean Altman, Charlie Evett and Steve Keyes are former members of the pioneering contemporary a cappella group Rockapella, and Kevin Weist is a renowned bald vocal guru. Collectively they have established themselves as the \"go to\" vocal group for rock, doo-wop, jazz and even (no way!) barbershop!

They continue to impress and entertain audiences with their voices, and are considered the best of comedic a cappella entertainment. .... The Heebee-jeebees are: Cedric Blary, Chris Herard, Ken Lima-Coelho and Jonathan Love. .... NOTE: Some incorrect spellings of the Heebee-jeebees are: .. ..heebie geebies.. ..heebee jeebies.. ..heebie jeebies.. ..heebee jeebees (needs the - ).. .. These are put here so the search engines pick up our profile.\n\nHometown: Calgary, Canada\n\nHome Free\n\nA cappella. It's technically what we do. But we're not your bow-tie barbershop quartet. We're a vocal band. Which means we do more than sing - we perform - engaging audiences in a rich blend of harmonies while entertaining them.\n\nHome Free has performed for a diverse and extensive clientele, ranging from the Minnesota Vikings, to Fortune 500 companies, Celebrity and Norwegian Cruise Lines, Allied Concert touring services, the Dutton Family from America's Got Talent and many, many more.

They actually come from a family of ten brothers, no sisters and are the six oldest in the family.

Lynn Knudsen is third and was born in Mesa, Arizona. Jak Knudsen is fourth and was born in El Paso, Texas.

Their father worked where he could to support his family which explains their nomadic beginnings.\n\nThe four younger brothers are a huge support to their six older performing brothers and play an important part behind the scenes.\n\nHometown: Branson, MO\n\nLow Key\n\nWhether its classic doo-wop or current pop hits, Low Key loves to sing anywhere and everywhere, bringing that barrel aged, high hopped blend that gets people out of their comfort zones and into a new sonic experience. Since beginning in 2011, Low Key has grown in scope and artistry, winning third place in 2013s NY Harmony Sweepstakes and performing in a stream of private gigs and public performances across the NY Metro area.
