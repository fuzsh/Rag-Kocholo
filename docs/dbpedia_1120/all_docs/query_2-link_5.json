        "text": "20 June 2023 Germany's population grew by 1.3% in 2022\n\nGermany's population grew by 1.3% (+1,122,000 people) in 2022, after a small increase of only 0.1% in the previous year (+82,000 people). A good 84.4 million people were living in Germany at the end of 2022, according to the Federal Statistical Office (Destatis). This development is due to a substantial increase in net immigration to 1,455,000 people (2021: 329,000), mainly caused by the refugee movements from Ukraine. As in previous years, more people died than were born in 2022. The excess of deaths over births rose further to 327,000 (2021: 228,000). These population figures are based on the 2011 Census. The basis for intercensal population updates will be brought up to date when the results of the 2022 Census have been published.\n\nMore\n\nEstimate of the 2023 population based on the 2022 census\n\nAs the results for the 2023 reporting year based on the 2022 census will not be available until December 2024, an estimate of the population size for Germany as a whole and differentiated by gender was made on the basis of the 2022 census.\n\nMore\n\nIn the \"EXSTAT – Experimental statistics section\" we regularly publish new and innovative project results of the Federal Statistical Office. These are obtained by using new data sources and methods. Both the degree of maturity and quality of the results differ from those of official statistics, especially regarding harmonisation, coverage and methodology. Nonetheless these results of the statistical offices of the Federation and the Länder offer new and interesting ways of looking at various statistical topics.\n\nSelected articles from the EXSTAT series\n\nExperimental georeferenced population figure based on intercensal population updates and mobile network data\n\nTo meet the growing demand for small-area population data, experimental georeferenced population figures were compiled based on intercensal population updates and using mobile network data. In a distribution procedure, the results of intercensal population updates were redistributed at the municipality level to a 1x1 km grid for the whole of Germany by means of mobile network data.\n\nMore\n\nComparison of the mobile network data structures of two mobile network operators\n\nThe Federal Statistical Office is investigating the usability of mobile network data for official statistics purposes in various feasibility studies. Differences in mobile network coverage and customer acquisition activities between mobile network operators have a decisive impact on data structures and thus the usability of mobile network data.\n\nMore\n\nMobile network data representing the population\n\nRepresenting the population by mobile network data is examined here.\n\nMore\n\nMobility indicators based on mobile network data\n\nAnalyses of mobile network data provide insights into the effects of coronavirus restrictions and the mobility behaviour of the population.\n\nMore"
