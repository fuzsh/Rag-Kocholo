        "text": "Jul 30, 2024 | Mobile Connections and Data\n\nCountries with the fastest average mobile internet speed 2024\n\nAs of June 2024, Qatar had the fastest average mobile internet connection worldwide, nearly 335 Mbps. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) followed, registering average median speed above 323 Mbps.\n\nFixed-connection speeds around the world\n\nWhen it comes to fixed broadband connections, Singapore tops the list of countries by average connection speed. Internet users in Singapore achieve an average fixed broadband connection speed of 242.01 Mbps, slightly faster than the 222.49 Mbps achieved in Chile, the second-placed country on the speed rankings.\n\n5G and 6G – the future of mobile broadband\n\nIn countries where it is in use, 5G is already bringing faster mobile internet connection speeds than ever before. In Saudi Arabia for example, the average 4G connection speed sits at 28.9 Mbps, and this speed jumps to 414.2 Mbps on a 5G connection. Now that 5G is commercially available, researchers have already turned their attention to 6G. Operating at a higher spectrum band, 6G will allow connections several times faster than 5G. User experienced data rates of 5G sit at 100 Mbps, and this speed is expected to climb to 1,000 Mbps on 6G connections. 6G is expected to not only provide faster speeds, but also enable more devices to connect to a network without causing congestion as it has a connection density ten times greater than that of 5G.\n\nAug 1, 2024 | Currencies\n\nTop 100 crypto exchanges in the world based on 24h trade volume on August 1, 2024\n\nCrypto trader Binance ranked among the largest cryptocurrency exchangers in the world in 2024, with trading volume that was several times as high as Bybit or OKX. It should be noted that these figures are separate from platforms Binance.US, Binance TR or Binance.KR. The platform from the Cayman Islands faced investigations from the U.S. SEC, which came to a head in November 2023. Binance did not rank as the most used cryptocurrency exchanges used by consumers in the United States.\n\nBinance's settlement with the U.S.\n\nIn November 2023, Binance agreed to pay a four billion U.S. dollar settlement with United States agencies — one of the biggest corporate fines in U.S. history. The U.S. Department of Justice investigated the platform for years for failure to prevent money laundering and growing crypto theft. The company's founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao pleaded guilty to the charges, agreeing to step down. Zhao would remain as the company's majority shareholder. The U.S. Treasury announced Binance will be subject to five years of monitoring and “significant compliance undertakings, including to ensure Binance’s complete exit from the United States.”\n\nMixed signals from crypto companies\n\nThe Binance settlement occurred in a month when overall crypto trading volume recorded its highest numbers for all of 2023. One of the main causes is the sudden popularity of FTT, a token released by FTX — the company founded by Sam Bankman-Fried. The developments surrounding Binance caused investors to move away from Binance's stablecoin BNB to the stablecoin from FTX. Earlier in November 2023, however, Coinbase saw its shares fall after announcing its quarterly performance figures.\n\nJul 30, 2024 | Cloud\n\nGlobal Microsoft Azure revenue growth FY 2020-2024, by quarter\n\nIn the fourth quarter of financial year 2024, Microsoft Azure revenue growth stood at 29 percent. Azure is Microsoft's cloud computing service that is used for creating a variety of scalable solutions for different use-cases. Azure's biggest competitors are Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud.\n\nMicrosoft Azure revenue\n\nMicrosoft does not publish exact details of revenue derived from Azure. Instead, revenues from Azure are integrated in its intelligent cloud segment, which consists of public, private, and hybrid server products and cloud services. In 2021, the intelligent cloud segment generated revenues of over 60 billion U.S. dollars, with Azure driving up server products and cloud services revenues specifically. However, Microsoft’s intelligent cloud also features other high-value products, including consulting services and premier support services.\n\nMicrosoft Azure products and services\n\nThrough its Azure platform, Microsoft offers a variety of different cloud computing resources to its customers, including virtual desktop, SQL database, or serverless Kubernetes. In mid-2021, there were a total of almost 16,000 products and services offered on the Microsoft Azure marketplace, with the majority listed under the IT and management tools category. The market has responded well to Azure's pricing strategy, with nearly a third of all respondents to a global survey of IT professionals rating Azure as providing the best value for money, more than any other provider\n\nJul 29, 2024 | Software\n\nPrice of Zoom's shares 2020-2024\n\nThe outbreak of the coronavirus (COVD-19) pandemic has changed the way many people communicate, personally and professionally. An increase in working from home (WFH) and social distancing has made face-to-face contact with relatives, friends, and colleagues harder. Tracing the share price of Zoom – a prominent video communications service – shows how central web conferencing has become to keeping people in contact throughout the pandemic.\n\nWhile the price has increased steadily throughout 2020, a positive announcement regarding the efficiency of a COVID-19 vaccine made on November 9, 2020, resulted in Zoom’s share price falling from 500.11 U.S. dollars to 403.58 U.S. dollars on November 10, 2020. Since then the share price has stumbled downwards, landing on 61 U.S. dollars on July 29, 2024. Despite the fall from grace on the stock market, Zoom's business is more robust than ever, both in terms of revenue and income. The company has really cashed in on the opportunity provided by the pandemic and has grown its business tremendously.\n\nThe work-from-home experiment\n\nA recent survey showed that in companies with digital output, 75 percent of respondents work either entirely in a work-from-home (WFH) setting, or in a hybrid arrangement. Web conferencing software is experiencing an increase in spending as a result, with 67 percent of respondents planning to increase their spending in this area.\n\nServices such as Zoom are certain to see a reduction in user numbers when the pandemic is brought under control, but usage is unlikely to return to pre-pandemic levels. In a recent survey of 1,428 CIOs and IT leaders across 83 countries, 94 percent of respondents said they expect at least some of their workforce to WFH post-COVID-19.\n\nHardware sales defy forecasts\n\nAs well as increases in software and services that enable WFH, physical hardware has also seen an increase in sales, likely due to workers setting up offices at home. Following an initial dip caused by supply chain disruptions, increased demand, especially in the education and business sectors, saw PC shipments return to growth. This defies forecasts made during the initial phases of the pandemic, when analysts expected a drop of anywhere from 1.6 to 11.5 percent in the shipments of personal computing devices.\n\nAug 1, 2024 | Demographics\n\nPopulation of Nigeria 1950-2024\n\nAs of July 2024, Nigeria's population was estimated at around 229.5 million. Between 1965 and 2024, the number of people living in Nigeria increased at an average rate of over two percent. In 2024, the population grew by 2.42 percent compared to the previous year. Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa. By extension, the African continent records the highest growth rate in the world.\n\nAfrica's most populous country\n\nNigeria was the most populous country in Africa as of 2023. As of 2022, Lagos held the distinction of being Nigeria's biggest urban center, a status it also retained as the largest city across all of sub-Saharan Africa. The city boasted an excess of 17.5 million residents. Notably, Lagos assumed the pivotal roles of the nation's primary financial hub, cultural epicenter, and educational nucleus. Furthermore, Lagos was one of the largest urban agglomerations in the world.\n\nNigeria's youthful population\n\nIn Nigeria, a significant 50 percent of the populace is under the age of 19. The most prominent age bracket is constituted by those up to four years old: comprising 8.3 percent of men and eight percent of women as of 2021. Nigeria boasts one of the world's most youthful populations. On a broader scale, both within Africa and internationally, Niger maintains the lowest median age record. Nigeria secures the 20th position in global rankings. Furthermore, the life expectancy in Nigeria is an average of 62 years old. However, this is different between men and women. The main causes of death have been neonatal disorders, malaria, and diarrheal diseases."
