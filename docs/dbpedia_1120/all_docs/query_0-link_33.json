        "text": "Olivia Rodrigo probably never imagined that a drive through the suburbs would become a rallying cry for anyone who's ever mourned a relationship. But when she released her debut single, the racing power ballad \"drivers license,\" in January 2021, suddenly she had the biggest song in the world.\n\n\"drivers license\" broke streaming and chart records upon its release, debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and inspiring memes across social media. While it wasn't exactly uplifting — Rodrigo vividly details the devastation of trying to move on from an ex, and laments the milestones they were supposed to celebrate together — the song became universally celebrated, sending listeners into a nostalgic haze of first heartbreaks. Everyone was screaming, crying and dancing at the same time.\n\n\"drivers license,\" one could say, is the latest centerpiece of \"sad girl\" pop — the specific aesthetic of artists who write songs through a dreamy, yet raw lens of rage, pining, heartbreak or rejection. The music itself creates a spectrum of emotions where you might want to sway at one point, but scream like Zach Braff and Natalie Portman at the rock quarry in Garden State at another.\n\nThough Rodrigo is one of the stars at the center of \"sad girl\" pop, it had been percolating long before the explosion of \"drivers license.\" After all, artists like Fiona Apple and Alanis Morrisette were the poster girls for it in the mid-to-late '90s. But one could argue that this iteration of \"sad girl\" pop found its roots in the 2010s, thanks to artists like Lana Del Rey, whose palpable aching and loneliness became inescapable anthems like \"Video Games\" and \"Summertime Sadness\"; Taylor Swift, whose first crossover success Red spawned the still-heart-wrenching fan favorite \"All Too Well\"; Robyn, who created the ultimate crying-at-the-club banger \"Dancing on My Own\"; and MARINA, care of the depressed-Barbie era of her album Electra Heart.\n\nEven with all of its origins, \"sad girl\" pop didn't truly begin to form its own sort of subgenre until Billie Eilish and her whispery, gloomy music emerged in 2016. Others have steadily begun following suit: Sasha Alex Sloan emerged with a debut EP aptly titled Sad Girl two years later; Gracie Abrams' intimate, diaristic tracks served as major inspiration for Rodrigo (who later recruited Abrams as a tour opener); Tate McRae has turned her insecurities into aspirational, sad-pop anthems like \"she's all i wanna be.\"\n\nWhile \"sad girl\" pop isn't exactly new (most music trends are cyclical, of course), the way that people are clinging to it is. \"There's a cliche about pop that it represents a retreat from reality, an escapist fantasy world where listeners get to leave their fears and anxieties in a vision of Katy Perry's 'Teenage Dream' or fun.'s 'We Are Young,'\" says Nate Sloan, host of Switched on Pop and assistant professor of musicology at USC Thornton School of Music. \"But modern listeners — especially young people — are pushing back against that paradigm, celebrating artists like Billie Eilish, Halsey, and girl in red, who don't shy away from the troubles of the world but sublimate them into their music.\"\n\nTheir music, in turn, helps them cope with their own \"lived realities.\" It's equal parts celebration of the artist and found community for someone who, in a world away, relates.\n\nWhich is why the rise of \"sad girl\" pop feels synonymous with the current state of the world. To varying degrees, we've all endured the trauma of a pandemic that hasn't ended, particularly the mental and emotional toll of isolation and anxiety that has transpired. There's also been the weight of police brutality, school shootings and the impending death of democracy for people to bear. Finding comfort in nostalgia — especially within pop culture — was natural for many.\n\nSome retreated to the music, TV or films they listened to when they were teenagers, while others sought relief in music that evoked the feeling of being young and carefree. It's also why recent vulnerable, melancholy pop tracks became such a balm — and ultimately solidified the power of \"sad girl\" pop.\n\nBut the group that seems to be drawn to this niche pop aesthetic are teenagers. It makes sense: Gen Z is coming of age at a time when there's less of a stigma around discussing mental health. Celebrities and artists are arguably more open than ever about their struggles — Shawn Mendes, for instance, has often shared his battle with anxiety, sharing a super honest message with fans in April; Selena Gomez opened up about her bipolar diagnosis in 2020, and launched a multimedia company dedicated to mental health this year.\n\nAnd it isn't just young women dominating this niche area of pop. Male artists like Conan Gray, Dean Lewis, Jeremy Zucker and Lewis Capaldi are delivering bedroom pop anthems ranging from angsty to wistful, overall unafraid to showcase raw vulnerability. Their music has proven to similarly resonate, with Capaldi's pained breakup ballad \"Someone You Loved\" hitting No. 1 on the Hot 100 in 2019 and Dean Lewis' \"Be Alright\" reaching No. 1 on Billboard's Adult Pop Songs chart that same year.\n\nRead More: How James Bay Found The Courage To Be Vulnerable For New Album 'Leap'\n\n\"Shame is gradually being removed, so people are talking more about their feelings and their mental health — and audiences can relate to it,\" says Jodi Milstein, MA, LMFT, LPCC, music therapist.\n\nWhen their emotions are reflected back to them in a song by a public figure, sometimes that's the key to getting help and seeking therapy. \"A lot of times, we can't tell people, 'you need to do this, this and this to feel better.' We just have to set an example,\" Milstein explains.\n\nGen Z is much less filtered than other generations, and more candid about their own mental health struggles, as a 2018 survey by the American Psychological Association and a 2019 report by the American Psychiatric Association showed. And it's not uncommon to see them pouring their hearts out on TikTok or Instagram. But their connection to hyper-vulnerable music is also the result of where they are in their lives. Because their brains are still developing, they \"tend to have a more difficult time modulating their emotions,\" says Sloan.\n\n\"At the same time, they feel things more deeply than adults might, especially music,\" he continues. \"Studies have shown that the developing brain creates strong neural pathways between music and emotion in the teenage years, so that the music we listen to at that phase of our lives tends to stay with us, no matter how far we get from that period.\".\n\nDespite the lyrics — or even the mood — of the artist, \"sad girl\" pop is no different than other subgenres of music. \"What's true of 'sad girl' pop is true of all music: it's essential to try and hear a piece of music as expression, not fact,\" Sloan adds.\n\nIn other words, girl in red may be singing about depression in \"Seratonin,\" but it doesn't mean that the listeners themselves are depressed. They could be, but they could also find catharsis or joy in hearing someone detail a similar experience. And at a young age, especially, there's so much power in being seen and heard by a song.\n\n\"Several studies have shown that when listeners listen to sad music, they can experience [it] as if it was kind of empathizing with them,\" says Jonna Vuoskoski, associate professor in music cognition at the University of Oslo. \"Music is almost like a virtual friend.\"\n\nBut while the music is resonating, there is a flipside to \"sad girl\" pop. The label, which has helmed the conversation around this music, can be diminishing to the artists who are pouring their feelings into these songs. Despite all of the aforementioned artists whose vulnerability has helped their listeners heal, filing music under \"sad girl\" writes off a person's — particularly a woman's — emotional trauma as something not to be taken seriously.\n\nIt can also glorify the idea that it's \"cool\" to be sad, which is rarely the intention of these artists. When it comes down to it, their songs are about as personal and vulnerable as one could get. They're creating deeply moving material — and an importantly deep connection with those who listen.\n\n\"They're speaking up for themselves — they're setting limits or setting boundaries,\" says Milstein. \"On Instagram and Tik Tok, people get on there and will say, 'Hey, this happened to me, and I'm not gonna deal with this anymore.' People have been more expressive. You see other people actually talking about [this] stuff, which before you didn't see that.\"\n\nFrom Abrams to Rodrigo, these artists aren't singing about their insecurities and pain for cachet: They're simply young women (and men) trying to navigate young adulthood. What they're sharing is courageous — and should they decide to move out of the \"sad girl\" box they've been placed in, we should be ready to grow with them.\n\nHow Tate McRae Turned A \"Full Identity Crisis\" Into Her Debut Album, 'I Used To Think I Could Fly'\n\nAnother month has passed us by, and August brings us closer to the end of the season. However, several new tracks and albums have dropped to lift our spirits. With brand new projects like Khalid's Sincere, Maren Morris' Intermission, and 49 Winchester's Leavin' This Holler, the beginning of August promises bright things ahead.\n\nA slew of singles dropped, too, from exciting collaborations like Charli XCX's \"Guess\" remix with Billie Eilish and Jessie Murph's new track with Teddy Swims to new offerings from Big Sean, Jhené Aiko, Jelly Roll, Suki Waterhouse, and more. Whether you're looking for full projects or a few new playlist additions, you will not be disappointed.\n\nAs you prepare to close out summer, be sure to check out these 10 new songs and albums.\n\nCharli XCX & Billie Eilish — \"Guess\"\n\nJust 24 hours after Charli XCX set the internet ablaze with a tease of her next collaboration, she not only unveiled the special guest, but she also dropped the track as a New Music Friday-eve gift: a remix of \"Guess\" with her fellow pop queen, Billie Eilish.\n\nThe pulsating song keeps the same club-ready aesthetic of the original from Charli XCX's brat, but taps into the sexual fluidity of Eilish's HIT ME HARD AND SOFT with the \"LUNCH\" singer adding a new verse (fans particularly went into a frenzy over Eilish's line \"Charli likes boys but she knows I'd hit it\"). The track offers a raunchy brand of girl power, further emphasized by the underwear-strewn video, as the unworn undergarments will be donated to survivors of domestic violence through I Support the Girls.\n\nKacey Musgraves — 'Deeper into the Well'\n\nSeven-time GRAMMY-winner Kacey Musgraves is expanding the well she first introduced in March. With the release of Deeper Well, Musgraves showcased a softer side of herself that she discovered during periods of self-introspection following significant changes in her life.\n\nNow, with Deeper into the Well, she takes us further along on her journey. Musgraves gave a taste of the additional seven songs with the release of her single \"Irish Goodbye,\" which narrates the tale of someone struggling to find forgiveness for someone who abruptly left. The extended edition also includes two new features, \"Perfection\" with Tiny Habits and \"Superbloom\" with Leon Bridges.\n\nThe release comes one month before Musgraves is set to kick off her Deeper Well World Tour in Pennsylvania; she'll hit cities on both coasts, and conclude in Nashville in December.\n\nRead More: For The Record: Why Kacey Musgraves' Timeless Album Golden Hour Still Shines 5 Years Later\n\nSaweetie — \"My Best\"\n\nMaintaining her message of confidence and self-worth, Saweetie releases \"My Best,\" an unapologetic anthem that emphasizes knowing your worth and surrounding yourself with people who prioritize your best interests.\n\nThe music video visually represents Saweetie's personal growth, both as an individual and as an artist. Shot at hometown landmarks like her high school and childhood neighborhood, she invites fans on a nostalgic journey of introspection — while also reminding them to stay true to themselves.\n\nLearn More: Meet The First-Time GRAMMY Nominee: Saweetie On Her Long-Awaited Album Pretty B^^^^ Music & Why Women Rappers \"No Longer Need A Co-Sign\"\n\nTones and I — 'Beautifully Ordinary'\n\nFour years after her smash \"Dance Monkey\" took over the world, Tones and I releases her second studio album, Beautifully Ordinary. The follow-up to 2021's Welcome to the Madhouse, the 16-song project reflects the artist's growth, exploring themes of nostalgia, love, and self-acceptance. Each song invites listeners to embark on an emotional, personal journey with Tones and I, offering a source of catharsis for those who relate to her experiences.\n\nTones and I first gave listeners a taste of the project in June with lead single \"Dance With Me,\" a track that delves into themes of heartbreak and desperation. Despite its underlying message of loneliness, the track retains Tones and I's signature upbeat rhythms and vibrant instrumentals — and the rest of Beautifully Ordinary follows suit, offering intimate and heartfelt narratives through her radiant musicality.\n\nSam Smith — 'In The Lonely Hour (10th Anniversary Edition)'\n\nCelebrating the six-times-platinum debut album that catapulted them to stardom, Sam Smith is releasing the 10th anniversary edition of In The Lonely Hour. This special edition features a reimagined version of their classic \"Stay With Me,\" and a brand new track, \"Little Sailor.\"\n\nThe original project launched Smith's career into the stratosphere, receiving critical acclaim and earning them four golden gramophones at the 2015 GRAMMYs, including Best New Artist.\n\n\"I feel so incredibly lucky to be celebrating this milestone with you,\" Smith wrote on Instagram. \"My team and I have created this beautiful anniversary edition for us all, and for the last 10 years.\"\n\nLearn More: 9 Times Queer Artists Made History At The GRAMMYs: From Elton John's Collab With BSB To Kim & Sam's \"Unholy\" Union\n\nKiller Mike — 'Michael & The Mighty Midnight Revival, Songs For Sinners & Saints'\n\nFresh off going three-for-three at the 2024 GRAMMYs, Killer Mike delivers another potent project, Michael & The Mighty Midnight Revival, Songs For Sinners & Saints. A follow-up to his autobiographical album 'MICHAEL', the 10-song collection dives deeper into his personal narrative, offering an epilogue filled with introspection and celebration — including the poignant track \"HUMBLE ME,\" which reflects on his arrest after winning his GRAMMYs in February.\n\nKiller Mike provided fans with a gift, releasing the album as a free download for the first 48 hours. In support of the release, Killer Mike electrified audiences with six performances over three nights at the legendary Blue Note jazz club in NYC, including a live-streamed show that attracted nearly 100,000 viewers. This project is a testament to Killer Mike's ongoing dialogue with his audience, addressing both tribulations and triumphs. As the tour continues with a stop at Lollapalooza just one day after the album's release, fans can engage further with tracks like \"NOBODY KNOWS\" and \"HIGHER LEVEL,\" which offer a glimpse into the rapper’s evolving journey and continued impact on hip-hop.\n\nTiera Kennedy — \"Cry\"\n\nStill riding high from her vocals featured on Beyoncé's COWBOY CARTER, country star Tiera Kennedy releases her latest single, \"Cry,\" which samples Justin Timberlake's 2002 Timbaland-produced hit \"Cry Me A River.\" It's another taste of Kennedy's forthcoming debut album, which she dubs \"R&B/country.\"\n\n\"I've been really inspired by the music I grew up listening to,\" Kennedy shared in an Instagram video. \"Timbaland had a hand in a lot of those songs.\"\n\nKnown for her distinctive approach to blending genres, Kennedy invites listeners to immerse themselves in her world of creative storytelling with her latest track. \"Cry\" explores the narrative of someone who has made their bed and has to lie in it, while Kennedy has already moved on.\n\nExplore More: A Brief History Of Black Country Music: 11 Important Tracks From DeFord Bailey, Kane Brown & More\n\nGryffin — 'PULSE'\n\nReturning with his third studio album, electronic artist Gryffin embarks on a new era and unveils a fresh side of his artistry with PULSE. The 14-track album features collaborations with a range of artists, including Rita Ora, Disco Lines, MAX, and more.\n\n\"PULSE is a return to why I fell in love with dance music in the first place, and this is the most creatively inspired I've felt in years,\" said Gryffin on Instagram. \"I can't wait for you all to hear the new sound and feel the passion I've put into these tracks.\"\n\nJohn K — \"Lost\"\n\nAfter more than a year of not releasing music, John K is back with a new single, \"Lost.\" It's a song that vulnerably reveals feelings of completeness after finding the right person — a fitting narrative for the happily married singer, who is expecting his second child with his wife, Lenée. . Becoming a father is one of the several major life changes John K has experienced in the past few years, all of which have shaped his upcoming music and brought his musical artistry to the next stage.\n\n\"I was writing with the aim of challenging myself to do something I hadn't done before,\" John K said in a press statement. \"I shattered the box of what I thought I had to be, and it allowed me to get to deeper levels of honesty and really gain even more confidence. I took risks, and I honestly expressed myself.\n\nJack White — 'No Name'\n\nAfter releasing two albums within four months in 2022, Jack White has essentially gone silent since — until now. Just two days after announcing his sixth studio album, No Name, the rock icon unveils his latest masterpiece.\n\nThe 13-track album stays true to White's DIY philosophy, with the recording, production, and mixing all handled by the artist himself at his own Third Man Studio. Even before the album dropped on Aug. 2, reviews were already glowing, with Variety calling it the album \"fans have been lusting for\" due to its parallels to the rip-roaring rock of his former band the White Stripes — but \"without seeming retro or leaning too heavily on nostalgia.\"\n\nExplore More: Songbook: A Guide To Jack White's Musical Outlets, From The White Stripes To The Dead Weather & Beyond\n\nBootsy Collins — \"Pure Perfection\"\n\nAhead of his forthcoming album, Album of the Year #1 Funkateer, Bootsy Collins has released \"Pure Perfection,\" a smooth, sultry track featuring German rapper FANTAAZMA and rapper Giz. The track also features one of the funk icon's legendary alter-egos, \"Bedroom Bootsy,\" who brings a sultry tone to the tune.\n\nDue Oct. 25 (the day before Collins' 73rd birthday), Album of the Year #1 Funkateer includes an 18-song track list with contributions from Snoop Dogg, Wiz Khalifa and more. And if the smooth, thumping vibe of \"Pure Perfection\" is any indication, the funk vet is ready to take fans on a trippy musical journey — one that only Bootsy Collins can moderate.\n\nLatest News & Exclusive Videos\n\nWith Her 'Winter's Diary' Return, Tink Is Ready To Rep For \"The Girls Going Through It\"\n\nNew Music Friday: Listen To New Songs From ATEEZ & G-Eazy, Shawn Mendes, Latto, & More\n\nWatch Alanis Morissette Win At The 1999 GRAMMYs\n\nDancehall Legend Spice Reflects On 'Mirror 25,' Her Near-Death Experience & Owning Her Own Vision\n\nThe Recording Academy Philly Chapter Celebrates 30 Years With An Inaugural Block Party & Fireside Chat With Tierra Whack\n\nSome artists are lucky enough to have a moment: a song of the summer, a radio hit, or a point at which their song dominates the pop conversation. Before even launching her own singing career, Amy Allen has done just that — multiple times.\n\nIn 2022, the Maine native contributed to hit songs from Harry Styles, Lizzo, Charli XCX, and King Princess; at the 2023 GRAMMYs, she was one of the inaugural nominees for Songwriter Of The Year, Non-Classical, and celebrated an Album Of The Year win alongside Styles thanks to her work on Harry's House. And as of press time, two songs she co-wrote with Sabrina Carpenter are in the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 chart: \"Espresso\" and \"Please Please Please,\" the latter of which hit No. 1.\n\nWhen you have a resume and catalog as impressive as Allen's, it's hard not to get stuck in a run of highlights — but Allen's writing style is so full of remarkable emotional depth and inevitable hooks that her life and career deserves further exploration. After binging on classic rock and performing in rock and bluegrass bands in her youth, Allen began writing songs for others in the mid 2010s and has only continued to expand her impact on audiences and collaborators alike.\n\n\"Amy is a once-in-a-lifetime writer and friend — it all comes to her very naturally and effortlessly,\" Carpenter recently told Variety. \"She's super versatile: She can wear any hat and yet it still feels authentic. I've learned a lot from her and admire what an incredible collaborator she is.\"\n\nAlong the way, Allen has continued honing her skills as an artist in her own right, releasing a handful of EPs and singles since 2015, initially under the name Amy and the Engine. But on Sept. 6, she's ready to fully introduce herself with her debut album — fittingly titled Amy Allen.\n\nJust after Allen celebrated her latest No. 1 and released her newest single, \"even forever,\" GRAMMY.com rounded up the key details you need to know about the singer/songwriter's diverse musical background, from her advocacy for female creators to seeing Harry Styles sing a song she co-wrote to a massive audience.\n\nHer Origin Story Features A Lot Of Car Talk\n\nAllen's early musical growth relied on four-wheeled vehicles to drive the plot forward — in many different forms. Growing up in rural Maine meant long car rides to for school and family outings, which in turn meant a lot of time with the radio.\n\n\"My dad is the biggest classic rock fan, so since I was little, I spent hours every day listening to music in the car with him and my sisters,\" she told Variety earlier this year.\n\nWhen it came time for one of her sisters to start a band, the elder Allen named it No U-Turn, setting the theme. When the band needed a new bassist, Amy took up the low end at just 8 years old, learning classic songs from the likes of Tom Petty and Rolling Stones. The band started collecting opening spots at a bar in Portland, Maine, and lasted until Allen was in high school and her sisters had left for college. In addition, she started playing in a bluegrass band called Jerks of Grass alongside her high school guitar teacher.\n\nEventually, Allen thought about moving on and changing course. \"I went to nursing school at Boston College for two years, and within a month of getting there I was like, 'I made a big mistake,'\" she continued. After moving over to the prestigious Berklee School of Music, Allen started a new project, yet again turning to vehicular terminology: Amy and the Engine, who would go on to open for the likes of Vance Joy and Kacey Musgraves. The project's timeless indie pop charm shone brightly on singles like \"Last Forever\" and the 2017 EP Get Me Outta Here!, fusing references ranging from the Cranberries to the Cure.\n\nShe's A Major Champion For Women In Music\n\nBack in 2021, Allen pondered whether it was time to carve up one of America's most prominent monuments. \"Can you imagine tits on Mount Rushmore/ And Ruth Bader Ginsburg from dynamite sticks?\" she sang on \"A Woman's World,\" a highlight from her 2021 solo EP AWW!. The song backs off from that explicit ask, but the low-slung waltz of ghostly piano and gentle acoustic guitar still subversively slices at traditional gender roles and power dynamics.\n\nAnd while the track may focus its first verse on the Notorious RBG, Allen designed it as a more approachable anthem. \"I felt very proud of that song. And it's something that I love to play live, because I think that it's nice as a woman to give that moment to other women in the audience where I see them,\" she told The Line of Best Fit upon the EP's release.\n\nHer solo work sits in a long line of female pop and rock stars looking to lift others up — with Allen's list of influences including everyone from the Carpenters and Pat Benatar to No Doubt, Hole, and Siouxsie and the Banshees. But she's also aware of the shortcomings in the industry when it comes to behind-the-scenes matters, with female songwriters representing a disproportionately small percentage of the industry and often at lower revenue than their male counterparts.\n\n\"It's important to have more women writing and performing so that younger girls can be hearing that and really connecting with that and resonating with that, and then being inspired to do that themselves,\" she continued. \"I'm really excited to hear what the next generation of singer songwriters creates, and I want to do my part in making sure that they're able to.\"\n\nShe Went Full Circle With Selena Gomez\n\nAllen's emotionally salient and indelibly quirky songwriting with the Engine caught the attention of more than just adoring fans. While on a tour stop in New York, she connected with Scott Harris, a songwriter who has worked with the likes of Shawn Mendes, Camila Cabello, Niall Horan, and Meghan Trainor; when Allen eventually moved to New York, she would take on some of Harris' writing sessions when he was in Los Angeles. One of those sessions spawned the first song she'd place with another artist: Selena Gomez's \"Back To You,\" which ended up on the soundtrack for the second season of Netflix's teen drama \"13 Reasons Why\" in 2018.\n\n\"I grew up listening to Selena Gomez, and I know that she's going to be a pop icon forever,\" Allen told People in 2020. \"She's awesome. I was so psyched…It definitely propelled my career in the pop writing field further.\"\n\nTwo years later, she would re-team with Gomez for \"My Mind & Me,\" a single released alongside a documentary film of the same title following the impact of the star's diagnoses with lupus and bipolar disorder on her career. The single similarly offers an openhearted, empathetic look at big mental health struggles, this time in the form of a sweeping, cathartic power ballad driven by stumbling syllables and stair-step piano.\n\nThe track was shortlisted for Best Original Song at the 2023 Academy Awards, charted in more than a dozen countries, and, perhaps most importantly, seemed to have made quite the connection with Gomez. \"Honestly, it was therapeutic for me,\" the pop star and actress told Variety in 2022. \"I felt super connected to what I was singing and what I was saying.\"\n\nShe Loves Seeing Her Collaborators Live\n\nSongwriters often wind up hidden behind the scenes, unable to really gather the impact that their artistic expression is making on others. But thankfully, Allen has been able to catch a peek in on the arena-sized reactions for some of her biggest collaborators.\n\nOne of Allen's most-played co-writes is \"Adore You,\" a highlight from Harry Styles' 2019 album, Fine Line, which has nearly 1.7 billion streams on Spotify alone as of press time. The buoyant, slippery burst of Fleetwood Mac-indebted funk pop embodies the start of an infatuation, and fans similarly felt under the song's spell. And Allen finally got to see that feeling come to life at Styles' album release show at the Kia Forum in Los Angeles in 2019.\n\n\"Watching Harry, I was really nervous because the album had only been out for a couple days and I wasn't sure if anybody would know that song,\" Allen told Variety in 2020. She also noted that the song was a hard turn from more heartbroken tracks she'd written for the likes of Halsey. \"'Adore You' was my first feel-good song, so I'm psyched about that,\" she added.\n\nThough not in person, Allen got a similar bolt of joy when she was able to watch Lizzo perform Styles' track for BBC Radio 1 in 2020. \"I idolize Lizzo,\" Allen continued. \"It really just goes to show that the right song can be performed by many different people.\"\n\nLittle did Allen know that she'd get to celebrate a GRAMMY nomination and win alongside Lizzo and Styles, respectively, just three years later. She co-wrote \"If You Love Me\" from the flute-jamming pop star's 2022 record Special, which was nominated for Album Of The Year at the 2023 GRAMMYs, where Styles' Harry's House (which featured Allen's co-write \"Matilda\") won the coveted honor.\n\nShe Shapeshifts Her Songwriting For Each Artist\n\nWhen a songwriter has to split their tracks up between multiple different artists, it might be difficult to ensure that each track sounds appropriately fitted to each performer. For Allen, it all comes down to knowing when to follow the rules and when to break them.\n\n\"Sometimes we'll be writing and someone will say, 'It should go straight to the chorus here,' and in my brain I'm like, 'But we need a pre-chorus!' — you know, following the ABCs of songwriting,\" she told Variety. \"But I've really been trying over the last couple of years to deconstruct some of those — that you don't need to pull out all the tricks all the time. It can actually make the song more interesting.\"\n\nIn fact, it might come down to what she prioritizes when sitting down to write, rather than which rules to follow. While walking the red carpet for the 2021 Ivor Novello Awards for songwriting and composition, Allen explained her perspective on songwriting formulas to PRS For Music: \"When I'm writing for myself, I usually start with the verse and move my way through, and lots of other times when I'm writing with another artist I make sure the chorus is bulletproof.\"\n\nThe GRAMMYs Are Helping Change Her Family's Perspective On Her Career\n\nAllen earned her first GRAMMY nomination in 2022 for her work on Justin Bieber's Justice, but her most meaningful nomination came a year later for Songwriter Of The Year, Non-Classical at the 65th Annual Awards ceremony (alongside Nija Charles, The-Dream, Laura Veltz, and Tobias Jesso, Jr.). While Allen had a hard time contextualizing the recognition, it helped her loved ones better understand the impact of her career.\n\n\"I'm just so grateful…Even my closest family and friends, they're like, 'I've listened to this artist for so long, or I listened to this song on the radio, and I had no idea there was a team that helped make this happen,'\" she told VERSED: The ASCAP Podcast in 2022. \"People like me growing up in small towns, we don't know that being a songwriter for a career is an option… I watched the GRAMMYs when I was growing up, and if I had known that people were making great careers, I would've gotten on the track a lot earlier.\"\n\nThough the inaugural award ultimately went to Jesso, Jr., Allen seems to agree that he's deserving of the honor — he's one of her collaborators on her upcoming album.\n\nMaine Will Always Be Home — and An Inspiration\n\nFor those who haven't been to Maine, a quick look at Allen's social media will reveal just how stunning the American Northeast can be. Among TikToks promoting her music, Allen almost inevitably drops in a clip displaying the expansive natural beauty of her home state — whether she's on a rope swing over a dazzlingly blue pool of water, or dropping a front spin while skating on the ice, or watching the massive waves from her family home.\n\n\"POV: ur back home in maine and wondering why u ever left,\" she plastered over one particularly stunning TikTok montage of a dazzling day swimming amongst waterfalls. The only thing as beautiful as the scenery is the music behind it is an unreleased track about missing home — proof that Maine will always be part of her, and that she clearly made the correct choice in following her songwriting dreams.\n\nLatest News & Exclusive Videos\n\nWith Her 'Winter's Diary' Return, Tink Is Ready To Rep For \"The Girls Going Through It\"\n\nNew Music Friday: Listen To New Songs From ATEEZ & G-Eazy, Shawn Mendes, Latto, & More\n\nWatch Alanis Morissette Win At The 1999 GRAMMYs\n\nDancehall Legend Spice Reflects On 'Mirror 25,' Her Near-Death Experience & Owning Her Own Vision\n\nThe Recording Academy Philly Chapter Celebrates 30 Years With An Inaugural Block Party & Fireside Chat With Tierra Whack\n\nThree months after OneRepublic began promoting their sixth album, Artificial Paradise, in February 2022, the band unexpectedly had their biggest release in nearly a decade. The pop-rock band's carefree jam, \"I Ain't Worried,\" soundtracked Top Gun: Maverick's most memeable scene and quickly became a global smash — ultimately delaying album plans in favor of promoting their latest hit.\n\nTwo years later, \"I Ain't Worried\" is one of 16 tracks on Artificial Paradise, which arrived July 12. It's a seamless blend of songs that will resonate with longtime and newer fans alike. From the layered production of \"Hurt,\" to the feel-good vibes of \"Serotonin,\" to the evocative lyrics of \"Last Holiday,\" Artificial Paradise shows that OneRepublic's sound is as dialed-in as it is ever-evolving.\n\nThe album also marks the end of an era for OneRepublic, as it's the last in their contract with Interscope Records. But for the group's singer, Ryan Tedder, that means the future is even more exciting than it's been in their entire 15-year career.\n\n\"I've never been more motivated to write the best material of my life than this very moment,\" he asserts. \"I'm taking it as a challenge. We've had a lot of fun, and a lot of uplifting records for the last seven or eight years, but I also want to tap back into some deeper material with the band.\"\n\nAs he's been prepping Artificial Paradise with his OneRepublic cohorts, Tedder has also been as busy as he's ever been working with other artists. His career as a songwriter/producer took off almost simultaneously with OneRepublic's 2007 breakthrough, \"Apologize\" (his first major behind-the-board hit was Leona Lewis' \"Bleeding Love\"); to this day he's one of the go-to guys for pop's biggest names, from BLACKPINK to Tate McRae.\n\nTedder sat down with GRAMMY.com to share some of his most prominent memories of OneRepublic's biggest songs, as well as some of the hits he's written with Beyoncé, Adele, Taylor Swift and more.\n\nOneRepublic — \"Apologize,\" 'Dreaming Out Loud' (2007)\n\nI was producing and writing other songs for different artists on Epic and Atlantic — I was just cutting my teeth as a songwriter in L.A. This is like 2004. I was at my lowest mentally and financially. I was completely broke. Creditors chasing me, literally dodging the taxman and getting my car repoed, everything.\n\nI had that song in my back pocket for four years. A buddy of mine just reminded me last month, a songwriter from Nashville — Ashley Gorley, actually. We had a session last month, me, him and Amy Allen, and he brought it up. He was like, \"Is it true, the story about 'Apologize'? You were completely broke living in L.A. and Epic Records offered you like 100 grand or something just for the right to record the song on one of their artists?\"\n\nAnd that is true. It was, like, 20 [grand], then 50, then 100. And I was salivating. I was, like, I need this money so bad. And I give so many songs to other people, but with that song, I drew a line in the sand and said, \"No one will sing this song but me. I will die with this song.\"\n\nIt was my story, and I just didn't want anyone else to sing it. It was really that simple. It was a song about my past relationships, it was deeply personal. And it was also the song that — I spent two years trying to figure out what my sound was gonna be. I was a solo artist… and I wasn't landing on anything compelling. Then I landed on \"Apologize\" and a couple of other songs, and I was like, These songs make me think of a band, not solo artist material. So it was the song that led me to the sound of OneRepublic, and it also led me to the idea that I should start a band and not be a solo artist.\n\nWe do it every night. I'll never not do it. I've never gotten sick of it once. Every night that we do it, whether I'm in Houston or Hong Kong, I look out at the crowd and look at the band, and I'm like, Wow. This is the song that got us here.\n\nBeyoncé — \"Halo,\" 'I Am…Sacha Fierce' (2008)\n\nWe were halfway through promoting Dreaming Out Loud, our first album. I played basketball every day on tour, and I snapped my Achilles. The tour got canceled. The doctor told me not to even write. And I had this one sliver of an afternoon where my wife had to run an errand. And because I'm sadistic and crazy, I texted [songwriter] Evan Bogart, \"I got a three-hour window, race over here. Beyoncé called me and asked me to write her a song. I want to do it with you.\" He had just come off his huge Rihanna No. 1, and we had an Ashley Tisdale single together.\n\nWhen you write enough songs, not every day do the clouds part and God looks down on you and goes, \"Here.\" But that's what happened on that day. I turn on the keyboard, the first sound that I play is the opening sound of the song. Sounds like angels singing. And we wrote the song pretty quick, as I recall.\n\nI didn't get a response [from Beyoncé after sending \"Halo\" over], which I've now learned is very, very typical of her. I did Miley Cyrus and Beyoncé \"II MOST WANTED\" [from COWBOY CARTER] — I didn't know that was coming out 'til five days before it came out. And when I did \"XO\" [from 2013's Beyoncé], I found out that \"XO\" was coming out 12 hours before it came out. That's how she operates.\n\nOneRepublic — \"Good Life,\" 'Waking Up' (2009)\n\n[\"Good Life\"] was kind of a Hail Mary. We already knew that \"All the Right Moves\" would be the first single [from Waking Up]. We knew that \"Secrets\" was the second single. And in the 11th hour, our engineer at the time — who I ended up signing as a songwriter, Noel Zancanella — had this drum loop that he had made, and he played it for Brent [Kutzle] in our band. Brent said, \"You gotta hear this drum loop that Noel made. It's incredible.\"\n\nHe played it for me the next morning, and I was like, \"Yo throw some chords to this. I'm writing to this today.\" They threw some chords down, and the first thing out of my mouth was, [sings] \"Oh, this has gotta be the good life.\"\n\nIt's the perfect example of, oftentimes, the chord I've tried to strike with this band with some of our bigger records, [which] is happy sad. Where you feel nostalgic and kind of melancholic, but at the same time, euphoric. That's what those chords and that melody did for me.\n\nI was like, \"Hey guys, would it be weird if I made the hook a whistle?\" And everyone was like, \"No! Do not whistle!\" They're like, \"Name the last hit song that had a whistle.\" And the only one I could think of was, like, Scorpion from like, 1988. [Laughs.] So I thought, To hell with it, man, it's been long enough, who cares? Let's try it. And the whistle kind of made the record. It became such a signature thing.\n\nAdele — \"Rumour Has It,\" '21' (2011)\n\n\"Rumour Has It\" was the first song I did in probably a four year period, with any artist, that wasn't a ballad. All any artist ever wanted me to write with them or for them, was ballads, because of \"Halo,\" and \"Apologize\" and \"Bleeding Love.\"\n\nI begged [Adele] to do a [song with] tempo, because we did \"Turning Tables,\" another ballad. She was in a feisty mood [that day], so I was like, \"Okay, we're doing a tempo today!\"\n\nRick Rubin was originally producing the whole album. I was determined to produce Adele, not just write — because I wanted a shot to show her that I could, and to show myself. I stayed later after she left, and I remember thinking, What can I do in this record in this song that could be so difficult to reproduce that it might land me the gig?\n\nSo I intentionally muted the click track, changed the tempo, and [created that] whole piano bridge. I was making it up as I went. When she got in that morning. I said, \"I have a crazy idea for a bridge. It's a movie.\" She listens and she says, \"This is really different, I like this! How do we write to this?\"\n\nI mean, it was very difficult. [But] we finished the song. She recorded the entire song that day. She recorded the whole song in one take. I've never seen anyone do that in my life — before or since.\n\nThen I didn't hear from her for six months. Because I handed over the files, and Rick Rubin's doing it, so I don't need to check on it. I randomly check on the status of the song — and at this point, if you're a songwriter or producer, you're assuming that they're not keeping the songs. Her manager emails my manager, \"Hey, good news — she's keeping both songs they did, and she wants Ryan to finish 'Rumour Has It' production and mix it.\"\n\nWhen I finally asked her, months later — probably at the GRAMMYs — I said, \"Why didn't [Rick] do it?\" She said, \"Oh he did. It's that damn bridge! Nobody could figure out what the hell you were doing…It was so problematic that we just gave up on it.\"\n\nOneRepublic — \"Counting Stars,\" 'Native' (2013)\n\nI was in a Beyoncé camp in the Hamptons writing for the self-titled album. [There were] a bunch of people in the house — me, Greg Kurstin, Sia — it was a fun group of people. I had four days there, and every morning I'd get up an hour and a half before I had to leave, make a coffee, and start prepping for the day. On the third day, I got up, I'm in the basement of this house at like 7 in the morning, and I'm coming up with ideas. I stumble across that chord progression, the guitar and the melody. It was instant shivers up my spine.\n\n\"Lately I've been losing sleep, dreaming about the things that we could be\" is the only line that I had. [My] first thought was, I should play this for Beyoncé, and then I'm listening to it and going, This is not Beyoncé, not even remotely. It'd be a waste. So I tabled it, and I texted the guys in my band, \"Hey, I think I have a potentially really big record. I'm going to finish it when I get back to Denver.\"\n\nI got back the next week, started recording it, did four or five versions of the chorus, bouncing all the versions off my wife, and then eventually landed it. And when I played it for the band, they were like, \"This is our favorite song.\"\n\nTaylor Swift — \"Welcome to New York,\" '1989' (2014)\n\nIt was my second session with Taylor. The first one was [1989's] \"I Know Places,\" and she sent me a voice memo. I was looking for a house in Venice [California], because we were spending so much time in L.A. So that whole memory is attached to me migrating back to Los Angeles.\n\nBut I knew what she was talking about, because I lived in New York, and I remember the feeling — endless possibilities, all the different people and races and sexes and loves. That was her New York chapter. She was so excited to be there. If you never lived there, and especially if you get there and you've got a little money in the pocket, it is so exhilarating.\n\nIt was me just kind of witnessing her brilliant, fast-paced, lyrical wizardry. [Co-producer] Max [Martin] and I had a conversation nine months later at the GRAMMYs, when we had literally just won for 1989. He kind of laughed, he pointed to all the other producers on the album, and he's like, \"If she had, like, three more hours in the day, she would just figure out what we do and she would do it. And she wouldn't need any of us.\"\n\nAnd I still think that's true. Some people are just forces of nature in and among themselves, and she's one of them. She just blew me away. She's the most talented top liner I've ever been in a room with, bar none. If you're talking lyric and melody, I've never been in a room with anyone faster, more adept, knows more what they want to say, focused, efficient, and just talented.\n\nJonas Brothers — \"Sucker,\" 'Happiness Begins' (2019)\n\nI had gone through a pretty dry spell mentally, emotionally. I had just burned it at both ends and tapped out, call it end of 2016. So, really, all of 2017 for me was a blur and a wash. I did a bunch of sessions in the first three months of the year, and then I just couldn't get a song out. I kept having, song after song, artists telling me it's the first single, [then] the song was not even on the album. I had never experienced that in my career.\n\nI went six to nine months without finishing a song, which for me is unheard of. Andrew Watt kind of roped me back into working with him. We did \"Easier\" for 5 Seconds of Summer, and we did some Sam Smith and some Miley Cyrus, and right in that same window, I did this song \"Sucker.\" Two [or] three months later, Wendy Goldstein from Republic [Records] heard the record, I had sent it to her. She'd said, very quietly, \"We're relaunching the Jonas Brothers. They want you to be involved in a major way. Do you have anything?\"\n\nShe calls me, she goes, \"Ryan, do not play this for anybody else. This is their comeback single. It's a No. 1 record. Watch what we're gonna do.\" And she delivered.\n\nOneRepublic — \"I Ain't Worried,\" 'Top Gun: Maverick' Soundtrack (2022)\n\nMy memory is, being in lockdown in COVID, and just being like, Who knows when this is going to end, working out of my Airstream at my house. I had done a lot of songs for movies over the years, and [for] that particular [song] Randy Spendlove, who runs [music at] Paramount, called me.\n\nI end up Zooming with Tom Cruise [and Top Gun: Maverick director] Jerry Bruckheimer — everybody's in lockdown during post-production. The overarching memory was, Holy cow, I'm doing the scene, I'm doing the song for Top Gun. I can't believe this is happening. But the only way I knew how to approach it, rather than to, like, overreact and s— the bed, was, It's just another day.\n\nI do prescription songs for movies, TV, film all the time. I love a brief. It's so antithetical to most writers. I'm either uncontrollably lazy or the most productive person you've ever met. And the dividing line between the two is, if I'm chasing some directive, some motivation, some endpoint, then I can be wildly productive.\n\nI just thought, I'm going to do the absolute best thing I can do for this scene and serve the film. OneRepublic being the performing artist was not on the menu in my mind. I just told them, \"I think you need a cool indie band sounding, like, breakbeat.\" I used adjectives to describe what I heard when I saw the scene, and Tom got really ramped and excited.\n\nYou could argue [it's the biggest song] since the band started. The thing about it is, it's kind of become one of those every summer [hits]. And when it blew up, that's what Tom said. He said, \"Mark my words, dude. You're gonna have a hit with this every summer for, like, the next 20 years or more.\"\n\nAnd that's what happened. The moment Memorial Day happened, \"I Ain't Worried\" got defrosted and marched itself back into the top 100.\n\nTate McRae — \"Greedy,\" 'THINK LATER' (2023)\n\nWe had \"10:35\" [with Tiësto] the previous year that had been, like, a No. 1 in the UK and across Europe and Australia. So we were coming off the back of that, and the one thing she was clear about was, \"That is not the direction of what I want to do.\"\n\nIf my memory serves me correct, \"greedy\" was the next to last session we had. Everything we had done up to that point was kind of dark, midtempo, emotional. So \"greedy\" was the weirdo outlier. I kept pushing her to do a dance record. I was like, \"Tate, there's a lot of people that have great voices, and there's a lot of people who can write, but none of those people are professional dancers like you are. Your secret weapon is the thing you're not using. In this game and this career, you've got to use every asset that you have and exploit it.\"\n\nThere was a lot of cajoling. On that day, we did it, and I thought it was badass, and loved it. And she was like, \"Ugh, what do we just do? What is this?\"\n\nSo then it was just, like, months, months and months of me constantly bringing that song back up, and playing it for her, and annoying the s— out of her. And she came around on it.\n\nShe has very specific taste. So much of the music with Tate, it really is her steering. I'll do what I think is like a finished version of a song, and then she will push everyone for weeks, if not months, to extract every ounce of everything out of them, to push the song harder, further, edgier — 19 versions of a song, until finally she goes, \"Okay, this is the one.\" She's a perfectionist.\n\nOneRepublic — \"Last Holiday,\" 'Artificial Paradise' (2024)\n\nI love [our latest single] \"Hurt,\" but my favorite song on the album is called \"Last Holiday.\" I probably started the beginning of that lyric, I'm not joking, seven, eight years ago. But I didn't finish it 'til this past year.\n\nThe verses are little maxims and words of advice that I've been given throughout the years. It's almost cynical in a way, the song. When I wrote the chorus, I was definitely in kind of a down place. So the opening line is, \"So I don't believe in the stars anymore/ They never gave me what I wished for.\" And it's, obviously, a very not-so-slight reference to \"Counting Stars.\" But it's also hopeful — \"We've got some problems, okay, but this isn't our last holiday.\"\n\nIt's very simple sentiments. Press pause. Take some moments. Find God before it all ends. All these things with this big, soaring chorus. Musically and emotionally and sonically, that song — and \"Hurt,\" for sure — but \"Last Holiday\" is extremely us-sounding.\n\nThe biggest enemy that we've had over the course of 18 years, I'll be the first to volunteer, is, this ever-evolving, undulating sound. No one's gonna accuse me of making these super complex concept albums, because that's just not how my brain's wired. I grew up listening to the radio. I didn't grow up hanging out in the Bowery in CBGBs listening to Nick Cave. So for us, the downside to that, and for me doing all these songs for all these other people, is the constant push and pull of \"What is their sound? What genre is it?\"\n\nI couldn't put a pin in exactly what the sound is, but what I would say is, if you look at the last 18 years, a song like \"Last Holiday\" really encompasses, sonically, what this band is about. It's very moving, and emotional, and dynamic. It takes me to a place — that's the best way for me to put it. And hopefully the listener finds the same.\n\nLatest News & Exclusive Videos\n\nWith Her 'Winter's Diary' Return, Tink Is Ready To Rep For \"The Girls Going Through It\"\n\nNew Music Friday: Listen To New Songs From ATEEZ & G-Eazy, Shawn Mendes, Latto, & More\n\nWatch Alanis Morissette Win At The 1999 GRAMMYs\n\nDancehall Legend Spice Reflects On 'Mirror 25,' Her Near-Death Experience & Owning Her Own Vision\n\nThe Recording Academy Philly Chapter Celebrates 30 Years With An Inaugural Block Party & Fireside Chat With Tierra Whack"
