        "text": "The Holocaust was the systematic, state-sponsored persecution and murder of six million Jews by the Nazi regime and its allies and collaborators. It took place between 1933 and 1945. In 1933, more than 9 million Jews lived in Europe (1.7% of the total population). By 1945, the Germans and their allies and collaborators had killed nearly two out of every three European Jews. Nazi policies also led to the discrimination, persecution, and murder of millions of others. Explore a timeline of events that occurred before, during, and after the Holocaust."
