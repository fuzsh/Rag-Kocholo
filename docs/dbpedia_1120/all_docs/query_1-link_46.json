        "text": "Like the post-breakthough period for many other artists, the writing process for 25 was painfully slow, taking 3 years to finish. It is understandable, considering that 21 was the only studio album released this century to sell over 30 million copies. On top of that, most Best New Artist recipients did not fare well after receiving the award. The product of the arduous process, fortunately, meets its mark.\n\n“Remedy” is allegedly the first song written for the album in an otherwise unfruitful session with long time collaborator Ryan Tedder. It is also the song most similar to the materials from 21, but in a good way: an earnest simple piano ballad done with care and restraint. At the same time, it manages to convey the intended message of 25 well with Adele showing her devotion to a loved one, could it be her best friend, her boyfriend, her grandparents, or most importantly her son. However, it is the lead single “Hello”, which took six months to write, that marked the end of her writer’s block. Featuring minimalistic instrumentation, the song puts Adele’s impressive vocals in the center, highlighting its content.\n\nWhile she drew inspiration from various pop stars for some tracks, these did not turn out well. “Send My Love (To Your New Lover)” is the one of the few mid-tempo songs, a collaboration with Max Martin and Shellback after Adele had heard Taylor Swift’s “I Knew You Were Trouble” during lunch. While Max Martin has churned out numerous great pop songs in “Since U Been Gone”,”Till the World Ends”, “Style”, “Teenage Dream”, “Into You”, just to name a few, let’s remember that he also wrote dozens of clichéd, formulaic, “factory” songs, of which “Roar” and “Can’t Stop the Feeling!” are epitomes. “Send My Love”, while not too bad of a song, pales in comparison to “Trouble” and sadly lands in the latter pile.\n\nAdele made a smart decision of not including “Alive” and “Bird Set Free” in the album, for both songs are too Sia in terms of both production and lyrical content. However, “All I Ask” has the same problem, but managed to make the cut. Again, it is by no means a lackluster track, but the over-sentimentality and its structure screams Bruno Mars, who co-wrote the song. Listen to his cover of the song, and there is no doubt that there would not have been any significant difference (or it may have fitted even better) had it been on a Bruno Mars album.\n\nStill, the most outstanding track on the album is another collab with a singer/song-writer, “When We Were Young” co-written by Tobias Jesso Jr. Both singers, while young, know how to write heartfelt ballads, evoking universal emotions. They played their cards right, and the track is capable of stimulating visceral reactions, similar to what they did on Adele’s “Someone Like You” and Tobias’s “True Love”. On the track, Adele imagines being at a party and “seeing everyone that [she’s] ever fallen out with, everyone that [she’s] ever loved, everyone that [she’s] never loved […] where [she] can’t find the time to be in each other’s lives.” It is also one of the better produced tracks, with layers and details placed with care and thoughts. The Ariel’s production is sonically different, a full rhythm track built on a piano ballad. Moreover, it is full of personality, akin to “Rolling in the Deep” and “Rumour Has It”, which many of the tracks on 25 desperately need. It is also one of a few times on the album when she steps out of comfort zone: Adele’s vocal performance on the track is impeccable, and the lyrics is delivered with a wide range of emotions, ranging from regret to sass and anger, especially with Adele belting at the top of her range like never before at the last chorus.\n\nTwo other highlights, “Water Under the Bridge” and “River Lea”, connect the album with the rest of her catalogue by using the imagery of water. On “Water Under the Bridge”, Adele sounds like she can control the water, with the melody mimicking the rippling water. It is also the best mid-tempo track on the album with a bright instrumentation and Adele at her most insistent and confident. In contrast, the sound in “River Lea” is dark and haunting, like the stains in her mind and “every heart that [she] use to heal the pain.”\n\nDespite all this, 25 sounds consistent but not coherent. There are times when it feels like a compilation of singles rather than an actual album, and most songs feel like a clever twist of a formula, getting hackneyed after a while. But again, it’s probably what the mass want: in the end 21 sold 30 million copies, and 25 itself followed suit with 20 millions. Nevertheless, Adele’s singer instinct is unmatched in her generation, with such dynamics in her voice. It’s a shame that her songs do not have the same diversity.\n\nRating: B\n\nHighlights: “When We Were Young”, “Hello”, “Water Under the Bridge”, “River Lea”\n\nWorst tracks: “Send My Love (To Your New Lover)”, “Sweetest Devotion”"
