        "text": "Despite getting ground into a fine dust by Stoke City this weekend, there were still some personal performances worth mentioning. What's that? There really weren't? Whatever, I've been on an '80s kick lately and that will continue in the form of player ratings. Better get your oven mitts because the takes are hot and ready to come out of the oven.\n\n5(a) stars: Prince\n\nPrince is the best. Not only does he have a catalogue of albums and hits, but he plays instruments! Like, he is a real musician. Throw in the campy, overacted Purple Rain and we have a clear winner. Go on, I dare you to not sing along to \"Raspberry Beret\", I double dare you.\n\nNo player on Tottenham dared to be as great as Prince on Saturday.\n\n5(b) stars: Michael Jackson\n\nWhile Prince may have been the best all around musical act, no one entertainer captured the hearts and minds of the public like Michael Jackson. In fact, he only gets \"b\" status on this list because he was a star long before the 80s. Put on Thriller and try not grooving just a little. It's impossible.\n\nNot one player on Tottenham captured our hearts or minds on Saturday.\n\n3 stars: George Michael\n\nHe had hits as a solo act and as a part of the group Wham!, a solid showing. The fact that many of his songs are sung ironically probably says it all about his career. What do I know, though? This is just another careless whisper.\n\nFederico Fazio – he was fine.\n\nChristian Eriksen – he, too, was fine.\n\nErik Lamela – he was better than almost everyone else probably, but at the end of the day, fine.\n\nHarry Kane – fine, fine, fine, I'm feeling fine.\n\n2 stars: Boy George\n\nBetween Culture Club and a solo career, nobody could escape Boy George in the 80s. That does not say a whole lot about collective taste in the 80s.\n\nEric Dier – he was playing out of position so I am showing empathy.\n\nJan Vertonghen – he was playing out of position so I am showing empathy.\n\n1 star: Bon Jovi\n\nEver wonder what a combination of Bruce Springsteen's New Jersey, working class angst and no talent would sound like? You don't have to, Bon Jovi already exist! Bon Jovi sucks and I refuse to defend my stance; it is that obvious a call."
