There you can also find all concert arias individually.

The Brian Dickie Young Talent Award was presented again this year, and went to the young South Korean Taehan Kim. The jury also awarded two \"Talent Development Prizes\" for the first time. The tenor Zachary Rioux from Canada and the soprano Parchiyachart Sitthidamrongkarn from Thailand can be pleased about it. This prize is sponsored by the Mascarade Opera Studio and the Fondazione Mascarade in Florence. The prize includes a stay of up to three weeks in Florence with the opportunity to join the opera studio there on a permanent basis.\n\nRead the press release here\n\nOur Finalists\n\n11 singers have made it to the finals concert of this year's competition.

This decision has not been taken lightly, but our responsibility for the welfare of all people involved must be our priority considering rising infection rates in Germany. The new date for the final round will be June 26-30, 2022, which will take place in a shortened format. Thus, the semifinal concert will be cancelled, the auditions as well as the final concert with orchestral accompaniment will remain as usual. We will provide timely information about ticket sales for the final concert as well as streaming of the concert here on the website and on our social media channels. An adjusted weekly overview of the event can be found on the “News Competition 2022” page.\n\nClick here for the News page\n\nHAPPY WORLD OPERA DAY!\n\nWorld Opera Day is celebrated on October 25. On this day, opera houses along with artists, opera lovers and opera professionals appreciate and celebrate this art form. For this special occasion, we recorded a short video together with our NEUE STIMMEN community. You can find it on our social media channels - Instagram and Facebook. Check it out for news and insights about the ongoing competition.\n\nFind the video here\n\nNeue Stimmen alumni dinner in Frankfurt\n\nLast week we had the kick-off of the Live Auditions in Frankfurt. This opportunity was used to have a small alumni meeting with our singers in Frankfurt the night before. With us were Ekin Su Paker, Marvic Monreal, Iurii Samoilov and Bianca Andrew. Jury member Brain Dickie also joined the little event. It was a great evening with lots of laughter and stories. After successful live auditions in Frankfurt, Paris and London will follow this week from the total of 12 pre-selection locations.\n\nFollow us on Instagram\n\nCongrats on round 2!\n\nAfter an exciting application phase, in which all participants submitted two videos with their online application for the first time, we were finally thrilled to receive over 1400 applications.\n\nOur jury now had time to review all the documents and videos and had to make the difficult decision of who to admit to the live auditions. The overall level was very high. All singers received an email at the beginning of August, for some of them with the long-awaited information: Next stop --> Live Audition!\n\nThe first one will be in Frankfurt on September 28th.\n\nAll live audition cities\n\nApplication open till June 13\n\nWe know it has not been easy to record arias with live piano accompaniment during this time. In certain countries there have been renewed lockdowns due to the ongoing pandemic. We want to give singers in these places a chance to enter the competition and decided to postpone the deadline for applications until June 13.\n\nHow to apply?"
