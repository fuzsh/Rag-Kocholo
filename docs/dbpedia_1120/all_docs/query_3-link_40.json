        "text": "In a place where most have trouble even speaking, they sang. Near the tomb of one of the world’s most famous composers, they sang. And in front of a panel of judges, as one of 10 choirs from around the world competing for top honors, they sang — and won.\n\nAfter a whirlwind tour through Europe, including performances in Germany at the Buchenwald concentration camp in Weimar and feet from where Johann Sebastian Bach is buried at St. Thomas Church in Leipzig, the Azusa Pacific University Chamber Singers choir swept an international competition. The group took the top prizes at the 50th International Competition for Choirs in Austria.\n\nThe competition, held in Spittal an der Drau, Carinthia, Austria on July 4-7, selects the top 10 choirs from 10 different countries to compete in three categories: Classical, Folk and Obligatory.\n\n“In 50 years, it’s only happened 14 times where the same choir wins two categories,” choir director Michelle Jensen said via phone from Austria. “In 1987 an American choir won the folk and classical categories but we’re the 14th choir to win both and the third from America.”\n\nThe obligatory category, for which past records were not available, requires choirs to learn the same three pieces chosen by the competition committee. Those scores are combined with the results from the classical category and the highest total score wins the whole competition. The folk set, which requires choirs to perform in the country’s traditional attire, has a separate prize. APU earned first-place scores for all three categories, as well as the Ferdinand Grossmann award, given for the best interpretation of a 20th or 21st century composition with its performance of Eric Whitacre’s “With a Lily in Your Hand.”\n\n“Anton Webern is known to be a challenging composer from the early 20th century,” Jensen said about one of the obligatory selections, which the committee released in February. “It’s hard to listen to, let alone perform a capella well, so that was one of the hardest things I’ve had to do in my music career.”\n\nThe Chamber Singers chose a Navajo chant, the traditional Americana song “Dixie” and an African-American spiritual song for the folk category, but was faced with the problem of choosing traditional American attire. So rather than have the students wear tank tops, jeans and flip-flops, Jensen said, each of the 36 choir members researched their family’s lineage and wore a different costume.\n\n“I was representing Norway because my mother is 100 percent Norwegian and her mother came to the States when she was young,” said student choir manager and bass Paul Cords. “The performance goes back to the roots of America, which is why we sang a Navajo chant piece, so everybody was wearing their heritage but they were singing about what their homeland is now.\n\n“Singing Americana songs isn’t necessarily losing the fact that we come from all over the world; in order to see what being ‘American’ is, it comes from an understanding of where we come from.”\n\nThe APU group stayed in the same place as two other choirs, bonding most with the Italians, who won the audience favorite award.\n\n“The coolest aspect of the competition was bringing people together who might not meet in any other context,” said Daniel Atwell, a tenor and the student tour manager. “In the end, it didn’t matter who won first or second but the fact that we got to share our music with the audience and build relationships with the people from the other choirs” was most memorable."
