        "text": "Every year the Eurovision Song Contest inspires millions of people around the world. We’ve got the answers to your biggest questions about Eurovision 2024.\n\nWhere is the 2024 Eurovision Song Contest taking place?\n\nThe 68th Eurovision Song Contest is taking place in the Swedish city of Malmö. The motto of Eurovision 2024 is “United By Music”.\n\nWhen is the 2024 Eurovision Song Contest happening?\n\nThe semi-finals are taking place on 7 and 9 May and the finals will be held on 11 May.\n\nAttracting up to 200 million viewers, the Eurovision Song Contest is the world’s largest music competition. Thirty-seven countries are taking part, including Germany.\n\nWhere has Germany come in the Eurovision Song Contest?\n\nGermany has won the Eurovision Song Contest twice, once in 1982 for “Ein bisschen Frieden” by Nicole, and again in 2010 with “Satellite” by Lena Meyer-Landrut.\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest is usually hosted by the previous year’s winner, so Germany has staged the competition twice, once in Frankfurt am Main and once in Munich. That said, in recent years Germany has finished towards the bottom of the table.\n\nWhich countries have won the Eurovision Song Contest most often?\n\nMany countries have only won the Eurovision Song Contest once, and some have never one it at all.\n\nAlongside Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Spain have won the Eurovision Song Contest twice.\n\nNorway, Denmark, Ukraine and Italy have all won three times.\n\nIsrael has topped the rankings four times,\n\nwhile Luxembourg, the Netherlands, France and the UK can all count five victories each.\n\nBut the record for Eurovision triumphs is shared by Ireland and Sweden, with seven triumphs each.\n\nWhy does Australia take part in the Eurovision Song Contest?\n\nCountries outside Europe can take part in the Eurovision Song Contest if they are a member of the European Broadcasting Union, an alliance of public service broadcasters in Europe, Africa and Asia. The non-European countries taking part in Eurovision 2024 are Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Israel and Australia.\n\nHow is the Eurovision Song Contest organised?\n\nThere are strict rules for the Eurovision Song Contest.\n\nEvery participating nation puts forward one musical act. The selection process varies from country to country.\n\nThe musicians must be at least 16 years old.\n\nThe songs must be new.\n\nNo cover songs are allowed, as only originals can be entered into the Eurovision Song Contest.\n\nThe performance can last no more than 3 minutes, but longer versions can be released after the competition.\n\nWhy is there a Eurovision Song Contest, and when did it start?\n\nThe first Eurovision Song Contest took place in Switzerland on 19 October 1955. Entries for the first Eurovision Song Contest came from Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. The idea behind the Eurovision Song Contest fitted well with the times as a musical peace project. It coincided with the beginnings of the European Union, which brought together the countries of Europe. Even today, Eurovision is about bringing people and countries together through music."
