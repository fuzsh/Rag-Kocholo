The artists who compete in ATC each year say it feels like a celebration of great vocalists, rather than a fiercely competitive environment. We even have a cash award for the nicest colleague, voted on by the other contestants. When we say our organization is different, we mean it. Whether you've dabbled in styles outside of classical music or not, we encourage you to give us a try. Email us for programming questions, check out our website, and come be a part of the ATC family!"
