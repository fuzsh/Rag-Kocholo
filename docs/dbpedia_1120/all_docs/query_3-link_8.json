Together with the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin, the Philharmonic Choir of the City of Bonn and tenor Matthew Newlin (who stepped in for NEUE STIMMEN alumni Zachary Rioux, who fell ill at short notice), final round participants of the last competition Francesca Pia Vitale, Eugénie Joneau and Ossian Huskinson performed Beethoven's well-known Ninth Symphony. Under the direction of the renowned conductor Cornelius Meister, they once again had the opportunity to present themselves and their skills to an international audience. The concert provided a brilliant finale to the opening weekend of Bonn's large-scale event.\n\nInternational Beethovenfest Bonn\n\nOur Masterclass 23/24\n\nMay we introduce: Our NEUE STIMMEN Masterclass 23/24. These 13 young singers will come to Gütersloh in October to spend a week working with renowned coaches and learning with and from each other. Everything culminates at the end of the week with a festive final concert in front of over 350 guests from culture, business and society. After the Masterclass 2020 took place in digital form for the first time due to the pandemic, it will present itself in a special form for its 25th anniversary, for which we were able to win renowned partner institutions: in addition to the week in Gütersloh, all young talents will get the opportunity to participate in a \"mixed reality\" opera production at the Staatstheater Augsburg in spring 2024, where they will learn digital performance techniques in workshops and literally experience theater in a new dimension. In fall 2024, some of our participants will travel to Positano, on the Gulf of Naples, to work with young up-and-coming pianists at the invitation of the Wilhelm Kempff Foundation, and to showcase the results of their work there.\n\nOur Singers\n\nRecap Prize Winners Concert\n\nOn May 23, our prize winners' concert finally took place again in Berlin. Exactly five years to the day after the last winners' concert, we were guests for the first time in the \"Apollosaal\" of the Staatsoper Unter den Linden. Our six finalists of the international singing competition Francesca Pia Vitale, Carles Pachon, Sakhiwe Mkosana, Yewon Han, Marvic Monreal and Dumitru Mitu inspired the audience. A big thank you to Marvic Monreal, who jumped in at short notice for Eugénie Joneau.\n\nFind the German press release here\n\nMasterclass Series 2023/24\n\nWe’re happy to finally announce that we will hold a Masterclass again this year.\n\nOn the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the format, there will be a special edition this year: Masterclass Series 2023/24!\n\nApart from to the traditional Masterclass week in Gütersloh, singers will also have the opportunity to take part in a “mixed reality“ opera production at the Staatstheater Augsburg in spring 2024 and to travel to Positano, Italy to work together with young pianists at the invitation of the Wilhelm Kempff Foundation and to present the results at a small local festival.\n\nFind more information here\n\nThe final concert in full length\n\nFor those who missed the final concert or just want to enjoy it again in full length, check out our Neue Stimmen YouTube playlist!

This decision has not been taken lightly, but our responsibility for the welfare of all people involved must be our priority considering rising infection rates in Germany. The new date for the final round will be June 26-30, 2022, which will take place in a shortened format. Thus, the semifinal concert will be cancelled, the auditions as well as the final concert with orchestral accompaniment will remain as usual. We will provide timely information about ticket sales for the final concert as well as streaming of the concert here on the website and on our social media channels. An adjusted weekly overview of the event can be found on the “News Competition 2022” page.\n\nClick here for the News page\n\nNeue Stimmen alumni dinner in Frankfurt\n\nLast week we had the kick-off of the Live Auditions in Frankfurt. This opportunity was used to have a small alumni meeting with our singers in Frankfurt the night before. With us were Ekin Su Paker, Marvic Monreal, Iurii Samoilov and Bianca Andrew. Jury member Brain Dickie also joined the little event. It was a great evening with lots of laughter and stories. After successful live auditions in Frankfurt, Paris and London will follow this week from the total of 12 pre-selection locations.\n\nFollow us on Instagram\n\nCongrats on round 2!\n\nAfter an exciting application phase, in which all participants submitted two videos with their online application for the first time, we were finally thrilled to receive over 1400 applications.\n\nOur jury now had time to review all the documents and videos and had to make the difficult decision of who to admit to the live auditions. The overall level was very high. All singers received an email at the beginning of August, for some of them with the long-awaited information: Next stop --> Live Audition!\n\nThe first one will be in Frankfurt on September 28th.\n\nAll live audition cities\n\nApplication open till June 13\n\nWe know it has not been easy to record arias with live piano accompaniment during this time.
