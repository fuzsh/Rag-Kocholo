        "text": "Ever since she came onto the pop scene in 1983, Madonna has ruled the airwaves, album charts, and general culture. She is the most successful solo artist in the US Billboard Hot 100 chart history and the best-selling female recording artist of all time.\n\nPopularly known as the “Queen of Pop,” Madonna has also starred in movies, written books, and founded the Ray of Light Foundation, in addition to other charity work and advocacy. She just might be the most famous blonde musician in the world.\n\nSinger and superstar Britney Spears is synonymous with 1990s and 2000s pop music, pop culture, and pop stardom. With a massively popular following that started with a stint on The Mickey Mouse Club and led to huge albums, world tours, and acting jobs, Britney’s meteoric rise and fall changed the way we discuss pop culture.\n\nSpears had a famous legal battle, a couple failed marriages, and a very public breakdown that led to her infamous conservatorship and family drama. Since her triumphant return to music in 2020 and the hit memoir The Woman in Me, Britney Spears has reclaimed both her story and her legacy. One of the most famous women of her era, Britney Spears is a blonde with staying power in both music and American culture.\n\nOne of the most influential blondes (and women) of all time is country singer turned entrepreneur, philanthropist, and cultural juggernaut Dolly Parton. Penning popular songs like “I Will Always Love You,” “Jolene,” and “9 to 5,” as well as acting in popular films including 9 to 5, The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas, and Steel Magnolias, Parton changed the game for women in the music industry.\n\nOver her decades-spanning career, Parton has won 11 Grammy Awards of 50 nominations, several Lifetime Achievements, 10 Country Music Association Awards, five Academy of Country Music Awards, and numerous other accolades. In addition, she co-owns The Dollywood Company that manages a theme park, water park, and multiple dinner theater restaurant venues. She is also known for her philanthropy, founding the Dollywood Foundation, which focuses on education and poverty relief.\n\nThe ultimate blonde, Debbie Harry co-formed Blondie in New York City in 1974. With their initially underground debut studio album and its follow-ups, including the smash mega-hit Parallel Lines, Blondie were pioneers in the American punk/new wave scene. With hits like “Heart of Glass,” “The Tide is High,” and “One Way or Another,” Blondie is one of the most influential bands of their time.\n\nIn addition to her work in Blondie and releasing solo albums, Harry has starred in movies from cult directors David Cronenberg, John Waters, and John Carpenter, and made cameos in several television shows.\n\nTaylor Swift rewrote the rules on what it means to be a female artist, musician, and songwriter. Working since she was 14, Swift built a long-lasting and successful career as both a touring musician and songwriter, and is one of the best selling musicians of all time. In fact, she is the most streamed woman on both Spotify and Apple Music, the highest-grossing female performer ever, and the first billionaire with music as their primary source of income.\n\nTaylor Swift revolutionized the music industry in a very public battle to own the rights to her songwriting credits and music, ultimately leading to the “Taylor’s Version” reissues of each of her earlier albums in turn. Now, her Eras tour has broken records and changed the culture of fandom and concert experience. With 10 albums under her belt, Taylor Swift might just be the most famous person in the world.\n\nSinger, actress, and global pop star Lady Gaga has established herself as one of the most prolific artists of the 21st century. Since her 2008 breakthrough debut studio album The Fame, Gaga has become a household name for her daring fashion, queer-culture icon status, and infectious pop musical style.\n\nShe has also released collaborations with Tony Bennett, Beyonce, and Ariana Grande, and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in Bradley Cooper’s 2018 directorial debut A Star Is Born. Lady Gaga is highly regarded as an artist, songwriter, actress, activist, and philanthropist."
