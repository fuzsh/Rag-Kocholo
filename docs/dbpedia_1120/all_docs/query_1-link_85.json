        "text": "This page uses Creative Commons Licensed content from Wikipedia (view authors).\n\nLust for Life is the fifth studio album and fourth major-label studio album by Lana Del Rey. It was officially released worldwide on July 21, 2017, by Polydor and Interscope Records.\n\nBackground[]\n\nIn December 2015, three months after the release of her third major-label studio album Honeymoon, Del Rey opened up about writing her next record in an interview with NME magazine, saying \"I do have early thoughts about what I’d like to do with [the next album]. My label, Interscope, is pretty flexible and open to my records coming out at any time, so I don’t have that pressure. I’m just happy to be able to keep on making music I can stand behind. That’s enough for me.\"[1]\n\nIn January 2017, the song \"Love\" was registered under the title \"Young & in Love\"[2] to the Harry Fox Agency.[3] The title of the track had been long speculated previous to this due to leaks of information on social media by fans. The track leaked in full on February 17, 2017, before any official announcement from Del Rey or her team had been made regarding the song or the upcoming album. The next day, February 18, the song was rush-released onto all music services worldwide, as the first single from the record. The second single \"Lust for Life\" (feat. The Weeknd) was officially released on April 19, 2017.\n\nOn March 29, 2017, Del Rey confirmed the album's title - Lust for Life - by uploading an album trailer to all of her social media accounts. About the album, Del Rey stated \"I made my first 4 albums for me, but this one is for my fans and about where I hope we are all headed.\"[4]\n\nLust for Life is Del Rey's first album that includes guest featured artists. These artists include Sean Ono Lennon, Stevie Nicks, Playboi Carti, as well as previous collaborators ASAP Rocky and The Weeknd. It was first revealed through an official press release on February 18, 2017, that the record would include \"exciting guest featured artists\".\n\nDuring the months leading up to the album's release, Del Rey began teasing tracks from the album through her Instagram profile by posting various short videos of herself singing or listening to new songs.[5][dead link][6][dead link][7][8][9][dead link]\n\nOn July 13, 2017, an album sampler with thirty-second snippets of each song from the album surfaced online through a French music website called Masilia2007. On July 18, 2017, the full album leaked due to stores distributing the CD prematurely and its availability online on the European social media website VK. Del Rey took to Twitter to express her displeasure with the news of the album leaking.[10]\n\nOn February 15, 2018, the instrumentals of the album, excluding \"When the World Was at War We Kept Dancing\", were leaked online.\n\nProduction[]\n\nFor the production of the album, Del Rey worked with previous long-time collaborators Rick Nowels and Emile Haynie, both of who worked on \"Love\" alongside Benny Blanco. On November 3, 2015, long-time collaborator Justin Parker posted an Instagram photo of himself and Del Rey in a studio together, hinting towards potential involvement in new music.[11] One song, \"Wild One\", written by Del Rey and Parker had been registered earlier in the year, although it is not featured on the album - later it was confirmed to be an outtake of Honeymoon. Del Rey also collaborated with various producers that she hadn't worked with on previous releases, including hip-hop producers Boi-1da, Hector Delgado, Metro Boomin and Jahaan Sweet. Another significant producer that worked with Del Rey on Lust for Life is composer and producer Dean Reid, who also had previous instrumentation credits on \"Dark Paradise\".\n\nSound and writing[]\n\nOn February 15, 2016, Billboard posted a short video interview with Del Rey on the Pre-GRAMMY Gala Red carpet opening up about the new record's sound. Del Rey explained, that while the album would be in a different direction to her previous record Honeymoon, \"it's kinda in the same aesthetic\" and \"[the fourth major-label studio album] has more to do with just like... I don't know... a clarity of inner dialogue that I feel is coming through better.\"[12] During a livestream on February 20, 2017, Del Rey described the aesthetic of the album as \"retro sensibility with a futuristic flair\", and on February 24, Del Rey opened up more about writing the record in an interview with Jo Whiley from BBC Radio 2, and she said:\n\n\"I've been writing for the last fifteen months and I guess I started out thinking that the whole record was gonna have sort of a 50s/60s feeling, with some kind Shangri-Las and early Joan Baez influences, but I don't know as the climate kept on getting more heated politically, I found lyrically everything was just directed towards that. Because of that the sound just got really updated and I felt like it was more wanting to talk to the younger side of the audience that I have. I guess it's a little more socially aware. It has kind of a global feeling.\"[13]\n\nDuring an interview with BBC Radio 1 on May 27, 2017, Del Rey described the sound of the record by saying it \"jumps around a lot\" and that \"It mixes a more acoustic sound to a heavier beatsy darker sound that's similar to Born to Die\". Del Rey's producer Rick Nowels called it her most diverse sounding album to date, saying: \"There's hip-hop, piano songs, acoustic guitar songs, psychedelia\".[14]\n\nLust for Life features recurring trap rhythms, classic rock references, \"sepia-toned\" orchestral backings, and Del Rey singing with a \"hip-hop affectation\".[15] The Daily Telegraph stated that the album \"lets a bit of light into the darkness of Del Rey's moody past works,\" noting that \"there's a sense of heightened drama in punchy Phil Spector style sixties backbeats and the way the heavy timpani crisscrosses with echoing digital trap beats, all swathed in a gauzy haze of Shangri Las style girl group harmonies.\" The Guardian described the album's sound as \"sleek contemporary-sounding soundscapes,\"[16] The A.V. Club praised its modern simplicity, noting that \"its beats are subtle hip-hop twitches or electro-pop swells, with percussion redolent of faraway fireworks booms or mellifluous melodic washes.\"[17]\n\nArtwork[]\n\nDel Rey revealed the official album artwork for Lust for Life on April 11, 2017, through social media.[18] The artwork was designed by Mat Maitland and Markus Bagå of Big Active. It was photographed with Kodak Porta 800 film, by Del Rey’s sister, Chuck Grant, with styling by Johnny Blueeyes, hair by Anna Cofone, and makeup by Pamela Cochrane. The cover depicts Del Rey smiling while wearing a white dress that is paired with white daisies in her hair; this is the same look from the \"Love\" music video, as the cover was photographed while the video was being filmed. In an interview with Portal Pop Online, Del Rey stated that the truck pictured behind her is the same truck pictured on the Born to Die cover.[19] The truck is also featured in the \"Love\" music video. The \"Lana Del Rey\" logo used on the cover is Del Rey's original logo (with some retouches) that she commonly used before the release of her debut album, Born to Die.\n\nRelease and promotion[]\n\nPromotion of the album was set to begin sometime in April 2017, according to Del Rey in a Beats 1 Radio interview in the same year, but due to the early release caused by the online leak of \"Love\", the promotion began earlier than intended. Promotional posters advertising the music video for \"Love\" directed by Rich Lee, were found across Los Angeles on February 17, 2017, leading fans to suspect that the song was being released soon.[20]\n\nThe lead single, \"Love\" was officially released worldwide on February 18, 2017. Two days afterward, on February 20, the official music video was released. The second single, \"Lust for Life\", featuring The Weeknd, was officially released on April 19, 2017.\n\nOn March 29, 2017, Del Rey released a special album trailer on her official VEVO channel on YouTube and revealed the name of the record. The video features black and white scenes of Del Rey with a monologue of her discussing the album. It was directed by Clark Jackson, who also produced the \"Love\" music video. In an interview with the director, he stated that Del Rey recorded the entire monologue herself on her phone and the 'Hollywood' sign was completely hand made out of papier-mâché, foam, and chicken wire. On the concept of the video, he said: \"We wanted to play with the idea of old 16mm instructional videos mixed in with ’50s and ’60s era sci-fi shows.\" The video also teases various mysterious symbols that will \"become more clear as songs and the rest of the album are released.\"[21][22]\n\nLust for Life monologue[]\n\nThe album was originally scheduled for release on May 26, 2017, according to numerous music websites including Metacritic and Music Week, but it was later rescheduled to July 21, 2017, so that Del Rey could \"add songs and special collaborations\", according to Ben Mawson.[23] Paris Match magazine first revealed that the album would be out on July 21, and on May 24, Del Rey herself confirmed the date on Twitter.[24]\n\nOn June 30, 2017, Del Rey revealed that the album would go up for pre-order on July 12, and that two new tracks would be released simultaneously along with the pre-order.[25] \"Summer Bummer\" featuring ASAP Rocky & Playboi Carti, and \"Groupie Love\" featuring ASAP Rocky were both premiered by Zane Lowe on Beats 1 Radio on July 12.\n\nVarious bundles and packages were made available for pre-order on July 12. The \"Lust for Life - CD Box Set + Digital Album\" includes a Lust for Life CD, digital download, a 24-page casebound book, and exclusive lithograph art prints. Individual Lust for Life CDs, limited edition clear vinyl, cassette tapes, and digital downloads were also made available for purchase on the Official Lana Del Rey Store. Along with this, limited edition autographed clear vinyl and CDs were also available for pre-order on July 12, autographed lithographs were released later. In September 2017, Del Rey also released official merchandise for the album that was made available for purchase on her official store.\n\nTo promote the album, Del Rey relied on live performances, print interviews, and photoshoots that were featured in a variety of fashion and music magazines including Elle and Complex. Del Rey was also interviewed on radio stations such as BBC Radio 1, Beats 1, and KROQ.\n\nTour[]\n\nMain article: LA to the Moon Tour\n\nDuring the months prior to the album's release and months following the album's release, Del Rey performed at various music festivals in Europe and North America. During these appearances, she performed select songs from the album live for the first time. On July 20, Del Rey celebrated the album's release with an exclusive listening party and performance at No Vacancy in Los Angeles hosted by Spotify. Another performance in honor of the album's release took place at Amoeba Music in Los Angeles on July 26, where Del Rey also performed during 2012 to promote Born to Die. Shortly after the album's release, Del Rey embarked on a small promotional headlining concert tour beginning in London on July 24, and then venturing to San Diego, Anaheim, Glasgow, Liverpool, San Francisco, Santa Barbara, and New York City. These shows took place from July to October 2017.\n\nOn September 27, 2017, Del Rey announced the LA to the Moon Tour, an official world tour to further promote the album. The tour began in North America during January 2018, and included legs in South America, Europe, and Australia.[26]\n\nSingles[]\n\nThe first single serving as the lead single from the record, \"Love\", was officially released worldwide on February 18, 2017, shortly after being leaked online. Its original intended release was set to be sometime in April 2017, according to Del Rey in a Beats 1 Radio interview in the same year. The single was met with extremely positive reactions and charted in the top 10 on iTunes in many countries. The official music video was released on February 20.\n\nThe second single is the title track from the album, \"Lust for Life\", featuring the The Weeknd. It was premiered on BBC Radio 1 on April 19, 2017, and simultaneously released worldwide. It was also met with extremely positive reactions and, like \"Love\", charted in the top 10 on iTunes in many countries.\n\nThe album's first promotional single, \"Coachella - Woodstock in My Mind\", was first announced on the Arabic streaming service, Anghami, on May 13, 2017, and it was later officially released on May 15, 2017.\n\nThe album's third single is titled \"Summer Bummer\". It features American rappers ASAP Rocky and Playboi Carti. It was officially released on June 12, 2017, along with the album's fourth single, \"Groupie Love\", which also features ASAP Rocky. Both singles were met with positive reactions among fans and critics when they were released. \"Summer Bummer\" was first teased when Del Rey shared a video of herself listening to the track on June 2, 2017.\n\nCritical reception[]\n\nProfessional ratings Aggregate scores Source Rating Metacritic 77/100[27] Review scores Source Rating The A.V. Club B[28] The Daily Telegraph [29] DIY [30] The Guardian [31] The Independent [32] The New York Times [33] Pitchfork 7.7/10[34] Rolling Stone [35] Slant Magazine [36] Sputnikmusic [37]\n\nUpon release, Lust for Life was met with critical acclaim from music critics, who praised it for its modernized sound and lyrics, which exemplified a newfound lightness and change in Del Rey's artistry. According to Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album currently holds a score of 77/100 based on 26 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\nEl Hunt of DIY praised the album for being \"a record that is prepared to be truly vulnerable, and is all the more impactful for it\". Hunt labeled the album as her most honest album yet, as well as her best to date. Jon Paroles of The New York Time interpreted the album's lyrical meaning by stating: \"She’s [Del Rey] thinking not only about the troubled romances that fill most of her songs, but also about a next generation\". Billboard named the record their \"album of the week\", calling it her most self-assured album yet, and writing that \"in a 2017 pop game riddled with thirst, trend-hops, and burn-outs, Lana Del Rey has earned a remarkable, singular consistency\".[38] Roison O'Connor from The Independent wrote that \"Lust for Life is more of an elaboration on her favourite subjects rather than a repetition, in fact, it's her most expansive album to date,\" concluding that \"Del Rey is far more self-aware than she has been on her previous albums\". In a positive review from GQ magazine, Kevin Long wrote that \"Like Lorde's Melodrama, Lust for Life is an accomplished piece of art, an antidote to the banal tunes permeating the charts and one of the best albums released this year so far.\"[39] Meaghan Garvey of Pitchfork praised the album for its lyrics, by saying \"the best parts of Lust for Life are simpler—songs that succeed not to the extent to which they concentrate the Lana Del Rey mythos, that present her songwriting as poetry that can stand on its own\".[40]\n\nThe album was nominated for \"Best Pop Vocal Album\" at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards, making it Del Rey's second time receiving a nomination in this category.\n\nYear-end lists[]\n\nPublication Accolade Rank Drowned in Sound Drowned in Sound's Favorite Albums of 2017[41] 69 Fopp The Best Albums of 2017[42] 58 NME NME's Albums of the Year 2017[43] 8 Q Q Magazine's 50 Best Albums of 2017[44] 39 Rolling Stone 50 Best Albums of 2017[45] 26 The Independent The 30 Best Albums of 2017[46] 21 Uncut Uncut's 75 Best Albums of 2017[47] 61\n\nCommercial performance[]\n\nUpon release, the album debuted at number-one on the Worldwide iTunes Album Chart and spent eleven days atop that chart overall making it the longest time an album by Del Rey stayed at number-one. It also reached the number-one spot on the iTunes albums charts in over 70 countries including the United States and Canada. Worldwide, the album sold approximately 194,000 units during its first week. By its second week, the album had sold approximately 269,000 units total globally.[48]\n\nThe album debuted at number-one in the United Kingdom on the Official Top 100 Albums Chart, becoming her third album to do so after Born to Die and Ultraviolence, and making her the first solo female artist in 2017 to score a number-one album on that chart.[49] The album also debuted at number-one in Australia, making Del Rey the first American artist to score a number-one album in that region during 2017. During October 2017, the album became certified silver in the United Kingdom with over 60,000 copies sold in that region.[50]\n\nIn the United States, the album also debuted at number-one on the Billboard 200 selling approximately 107,000 units, 80,000 of which were pure album sales while the rest is a mixture of track equivalent albums (TEA) and streaming equivalent albums (SEA). Lust for Life is Del Rey's second number-one album in the United States, following Ultraviolence (2014).[51]\n\nTrack listing[]\n\nThe album's official track list was revealed on July 12, 2017, through the album's official pre-order although it had leaked online weeks prior due to music services putting it on their websites early. The album consists of 16 standard tracks without deluxe edition tracks. On May 27, 2017, Del Rey stated in an interview that the album had 18 tracks in total, but when the track list was officially revealed there were two less. Lust for Life is Del Rey's first studio album to feature guest artists, as five tracks on the album are collaborations (tracks 2, 6, 7, 12, 13). The record's total length is 71 minutes and 56 seconds, making it Del Rey's second longest standard edition being Did You Know That There’s a Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd the first.\n\nNo. TitleWriter(s)Producer(s) Length 1. \"Love\" Lana Del Rey, Rick Nowels, Emile Haynie, Benny BlancoDel Rey, Nowels, Haynie, Blanco, Kieron Menzies 4:32 2. \"Lust for Life\" (featuring The Weeknd)Del Rey, Abel Tesfaye, Max Martin, NowelsDel Rey, Nowels, Menzies, Dean Reid 4:24 3. \"13 Beaches\" Del Rey, NowelsDel Rey, Nowels, Menzies, Reid 4:55 4. \"Cherry\" Del Rey, Tim LarcombeDel Rey, Nowels, Reid, Larcombe 3:00 5. \"White Mustang\" Del Rey, NowelsDel Rey, Nowels, Menzies, Reid 2:44 6. \"Summer Bummer\" (featuring ASAP Rocky & Playboi Carti)Del Rey, Matthew Samuels, Jordan Carter, Rakim Mayers, Tyler Williams, Jahaan Sweet, Andrew Joseph Gradwohl JrBoi-1da, Sweet 4:21 7. \"Groupie Love\" (featuring ASAP Rocky)Del Rey, Nowels, MayersDel Rey, Nowels, Menzies, Hector Delgado, Reid 4:24 8. \"In My Feelings\" Del Rey, NowelsDel Rey, Nowels, Menzies, Reid 3:58 9. \"Coachella - Woodstock in My Mind\" Del Rey, NowelsDel Rey, Nowels, Menzies, Reid 4:18 10. \"God Bless America - and All the Beautiful Women in It\" Del Rey, NowelsNowels, Menzies, Reid, Metro Boomin 4:36 11. \"When the World Was at War We Kept Dancing\" Del Rey, Nowels, ReidDel Rey, Nowels, Menzies, Reid 4:35 12. \"Beautiful People Beautiful Problems\" (featuring Stevie Nicks)Del Rey, Nicks, Nowels, Justin ParkerDel Rey, Nowels, Menzies, Reid 4:13 13. \"Tomorrow Never Came\" (featuring Sean Ono Lennon)Del Rey, Lennon, NowelsDel Rey, Lennon, Nowels 5:07 14. \"Heroin\" Del Rey, NowelsDel Rey, Nowels, Menzies, Reid 5:55 15. \"Change\" Del Rey, NowelsDel Rey, Nowels, Menzies 5:21 16. \"Get Free\" Del Rey, Nowels, MenziesDel Rey, Nowels, Menzies, Reid 5:34\n\nTotal length:\n\n71:56\n\nScrapped tracks[]\n\nYou can find the full Lust for Life outtake list here.\n\nDuring the interview with Zane Lowe for Beats 1 Radio, Del Rey confirmed that she had four tracks that were left on the \"cutting room floor\", but stated that she may include them \"somewhere\". Two of these tracks - \"The Next Best American Record\" and \"Yosemite\" - were discussed at length with Lowe.[52] Both songs were considered too slow and mellow compared to the rest of the album. Del Rey would state that \"Yosemite\" was \"too happy\" for the record and that she was not completely in that state of mind yet, while she said the following about \"The Next Best American Record\" (as \"Architecture\"):\n\n\"That's another song that I talked about all the time...talk about like a brother and sister track...the ying [sic] to...Yosemite's yang...It's kind of all about Topanga and this...zone that I was in for a minute and then kind of like got shifted out of...The more I did features..the more I was...out of that...quiet place, which I kind of liken to the far west like Malibu, Topanga, further north.\"\n\nThose tracks would later be released on Del Rey's two subsequent studio albums: \"The Next Best American Record\" on her sixth major-label studio album Norman Fucking Rockwell! and \"Yosemite\" on her seventh major-label studio album Chemtrails Over the Country Club. In her interview with Zane Lowe, Del Rey also revealed that \"Roses Bloom for You\" was intended to be an introduction to the album.[52]\n\nNot long after the release of the album, Del Rey mentioned in an interview with Le Journal de Femmes that she had \"left aside\" five songs from the album \"for a specific reason\".[53] Reliable insiders would later confirm Del Rey's intention to release a variety of songs done with Rick Nowels that did not make it onto the album, including some written after the album's release. These tracks include \"The Next Best American Record\", \"Yosemite\", \"Silverlake\", \"Gucci on My Body\", \"California\", and, reportedly, a few others. This idea was reportedly scrapped once Del Rey met Jack Antonoff, the primary producer for Norman Fucking Rockwell!.\n\n\"Serene Queen\" is an early outtake from the album done with Nowels in 2015, but was ultimately scrapped. Nowels also produced \"LA Who Am I to Love You\" for the album in 2016. A snippet from a 2018 remix of the song has leaked, but neither version has leaked in full. \"Poetry in Motion\" is another outtake from the album produced by Nowels in 2016.\n\nConcept tracks \"Sugary Sweet\" and \"Valley of the Dolls\" are two other songs known to be recorded and considered during the album sessions. \"Valley of the Dolls\" was recorded on Valentine's Day 2017 with Zach Dawes. \"Sugary Sweet\" has yet to leak in full.\n\nUltraviolence and Honeymoon outtake \"Say Yes to Heaven\" was sent to various producers, including Fred Gibson, during the recording sessions for Lust for Life in 2016. The versions made then are described as more \"electronic\" and \"upbeat\". The song was ultimately cut from the tracklist because of its leak.[S 5] These versions all currently remain unleaked.\n\nSnippets from another 2016 song \"Everything I Do\" have leaked, though the producer is currently unknown. Other song titles with unknown backgrounds, including \"Anyone Who Had a Heart\", \"Good Intentions\", \"Love on the Golf Course\", \"Beloved\", \"Good Vibrations\", and \"Magic in the Air\", are all said to have been recorded during Lust for Life sessions.[S 11]\n\nIn an interview with Pitchfork, Del Rey stated that, besides \"When the World Was at War We Kept Dancing\" and \"God Bless America - and All the Beautiful Women in It\", she recorded four other tracks with political themes.[54]\n\nGallery[]\n\nDigital booklet[]\n\nArt prints shot by Chuck Grant and Neil Krug[]\n\nCharts and certifications[]\n\nWeekly charts[]\n\nChart (2017) Peak\n\nposition Argentine Albums (CAPIF)[55] 1 Australian Albums (ARIA)[56] 1 Austrian Albums (Ö3 Austria)[57] 5 Belgian Albums (Ultratop Flanders)[58] 4 Belgian Albums (Ultratop Wallonia)[59] 2 Canadian Albums (Billboard)[60] 1 Croatian International Albums (HDU)[61] 1 Czech Albums (ČNS IFPI)[62] 2 Danish Albums (Hitlisten)[63] 5 Dutch Albums (MegaCharts)[64] 6 Finnish Albums (OFC)[65] 3 French Albums (SNEP)[66] 3 German Albums (Offizielle Top 100)[67] 8 Greek Albums (IFPI)[68] 46 Hungarian Albums (MAHASZ)[69] 27 Irish Albums (IRMA)[70] 2 Italian Albums (FIMI)[71] 6 Japanese Albums (Oricon)[72] 142 Mexican Albums (AMPROFON)[73] 4 New Zealand Albums (RMNZ)[74] 2 Norwegian Albums (VG-lista)[75] 1 Polish Albums (ZPAV)[76] 2 Portuguese Albums (AFP)[77] 1 Scottish Albums (OCC)[78] 1 Slovak Albums (ČNS IFPI)[79] 3 South Korean Albums (Gaon)[80] 57 South Korean International Albums (Gaon)[81] 5 Spanish Albums (PROMUSICAE)[82] 1 Swedish Albums (Sverigetopplistan)[83] 1 Swiss Albums (Schweizer Hitparade)[84] 2 Taiwanese International Albums (Five Music)[85] 1 UK Albums (OCC)[86] 1 US Billboard 200[87] 1 US Digital Albums (Billboard)[88] 1 US Tastemaker Albums (Billboard)[89] 1 US Top Album Sales (Billboard)[90] 1 US Top Alternative Albums (Billboard) 1 World (United World Album Chart)[91] 3\n\nYear-end charts[]\n\nChart (2017) Position Belgian Albums (Ultratop Flanders)[92] 75 Belgian Albums (Ultratop Wallonia)[93] 75 US Billboard 200[94] 142\n\nCertifications[]\n\nRelease history[]\n\nRegion Date Format Label Ref.
