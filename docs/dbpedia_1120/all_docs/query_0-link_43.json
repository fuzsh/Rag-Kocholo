        "text": "Choral Ensembles\n\nBel Canto\n\nThe Azusa Pacific University Bel Canto Women’s Choir, under the direction of Brandon Chase Di Noto, MM, presents numerous performances each year. With more than 40 years of service history, the 40-voice ensemble travels extensively, ministering to and entertaining thousands of people in churches and concert halls locally and worldwide. In addition to U.S. appearances, Bel Canto has performed internationally in places as diverse as Romania, Poland, and South Africa in cooperation with APU’s Center for Student Action. Local destinations include annual appearances at the Disneyland Resort and the Peter and Masha Plotkin Memorial Art Gallery. On campus, Bel Canto enjoys ensemble partnerships with many of APU’s other musical ensembles. Annual participation in APU’s Dinner Rally, Celebrate Christmas, and student-led Liturgical Chapel help Bel Canto connect with students, staff, faculty and alumni. All Bel Canto students enjoy the opportunity to study voice with one of the department’s voice faculty. Bel Canto regularly commissions new works by APU faculty, students, and other renowned composers, and enjoys additional leadership by graduate assistant directors.\n\nChamber Singers\n\nThe Azusa Pacific University Chamber Singers have become a recognizable and respected name in the global choral scene. The 32-voice mixed ensemble performs works in a variety of musical styles and periods, ranging from early Renaissance to contemporary a cappella. Founded in 2000 by conductor Michelle Jensen, DMA, the ensemble’s high level of performance is a result of talent, discipline, excellent musicianship, and professionalism. Members of the ensemble strive to sharpen their skills as performers, educators, and musicians.\n\nAPU Chamber Singers perform locally and abroad. They have toured Australia, Austria, China, Czechia, England, Germany, Hong Kong, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, and Wales, with featured performances at the Sydney Opera House, St. Peter’s Basilica in the Vatican, the Sistine Chapel, Thomaskirche (St. Thomas Church) in Leipzig, Basilica San Marcos in Venice, and a special commemoration concert for the 75th anniversary at Buchenwald concentration camp. APU Chamber Singers have collaborated with renowned artists and composers including Morten Lauridsen, Eric Whitacre, and Pentatonix arranger Ben Bram.\n\nIn July 2013, APU Chamber Singers were selected to represent the United States at the 50th International Competition of Choirs in Spittal an der Drau, Austria, where they placed first in every category (by the highest margin in competition history) and received the Ferdinand Grossman Award for best performance of a contemporary work for their performance of Whitacre’s “With a Lily in Your Hand.” In 2015, they competed in the prestigious “Choir of the World” competition at the Eisteddfod in Llangollen, Wales, where they won three first-place and three second-place prizes. In 2023, they competed once more in the Eisteddfod, placing in every category they entered. During the COVID-19 pandemic, their music-making did not stop; their virtual performances placed in the 2020 Interkultur Video Competition and were featured at the 2021 American Choral Directors Association Conference. The ensemble has been selected three times to be a featured ensemble at the prestigious National Collegiate Choral Organization Conference, in 2011, 2015, and 2023.\n\nFollow the APU Chamber Singers on Facebook\n\nGospel Choir\n\nAPU’s Gospel Choir combines unique voices with a fresh sound to establish a gospel music experience that is both artistic and cultural. Combining the gifts and talents of undergraduate and graduate students, faculty, staff, administration, and community members makes this choir one of the most diverse organizations on campus.\n\nThe choir, led by Jonli Tunstall, PhD, performs at special events and at venues such as the Salvation Army, Union Rescue Mission, Desert Bar Association and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti’s Annual Prayer Breakfast. Future plans include studio-recording sessions for various artists, a local area mini-tour, which will include visits to middle and high schools as well as churches in and around the Los Angeles County.\n\nVocal Groups\n\nEast End Vocal Jazz\n\nAPU’s East End Vocal Jazz is an audition-based vocal ensemble in the School of Music. The ensemble includes 8-12 talented singers and a full rhythm section. This ensemble performs a wide variety of vocal jazz literature, both classic and contemporary, and is available to perform for special private events in Los Angeles County. In addition to their performances each year, East End Vocal Jazz is honored to appear annually in the Battle of the Big Bands concert featuring both APU’s Jazz Ensemble and Citrus College’s Blue Note Orchestra. East End Vocal Jazz also appears regularly at schools, jazz festivals, civic organizations, and other local concert events. The ensemble is under the direction of Teryn McPherson, who also teaches as a Commercial Voice Private Instructor at APU, as well as Fullerton College. Teryn performs regularly with her own jazz ensembles such as the Teryn Ré Trio and Teryn Ré Big Band in the greater Los Angeles and Orange County areas.\n\nOpera\n\nAPU Opera offers comprehensive training for the aspiring singer/actor. Students work with designers from around the vibrant Los Angeles region, which is host to designers and artists of national and international renown. APU also frequently hosts master teachers and guest coaches from global industry-leading companies and conservatories.\n\nAPU Opera offers excellent training within a supportive and encouraging environment where singers of all levels can grow and develop, reaching their fullest potential. Along with music and language coaching, students have opportunities for training in stagecraft, acting, makeup, and improvisation. The fall opera scenes and spring production give students ample performance opportunities in opera in addition to their other ensemble responsibilities in the APU School of Music. APU Opera is directed by Kristof Van Grysperre."
