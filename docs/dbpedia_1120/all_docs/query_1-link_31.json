Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJohnny Marr of The Smiths posted his displeasure on X.\n\nTrump has reportedly been playing The Smiths' song \"Please, Please, Please, Let Me Get What I Want\" for crowds at some of his recent rallies.\n\nThe Smiths' guitarist Johnny Marr, who cowrote the song with frontman Morrissey, expressed his displeasure in an X post on Tuesday.\n\nIn the post, Marr reacted to a video from political reporter Soorin Kim that appeared to show the song playing during a Trump rally in South Dakota in September.\n\n\"Ahh…right…OK. I never in a million years would've thought this could come to pass. Consider this shit shut right down right now,\" the musician wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTom Petty's family issued a complaint to the Trump campaign after one of the musician's songs was played at a 2020 rally.\n\nThe family of the late Tom Petty has condemned the apparent use of the musician's song \"I Won't Back Down\" at Trump's 2020 campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\nIn a statement released on X, Tom Petty's daughters Adria and Annakim, widow Dana, and ex-wife Jane Petty wrote that they'd \"issued an official cease and desist notice to the Trump campaign.\"\n\n\"Trump was in no way authorized to use this song to further a campaign that leaves too many Americans and common sense behind,\" the family wrote in their statement.\n\nThis isn't the first time Tom Petty's music has been used in political campaigns without permission — in 2000, George W. Bush used one of the musician's songs on his campaign trail, according to Time.\n\nTom Petty threatened legal action against Bush, saying the use of his song falsely implied that he was endorsing Bush.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJohn Fogerty said more than once that he doesn't want Trump using his song \"Fortunate Son.\"\n\nIn October 2020, former Creedence Clearwater Revival member John Fogerty posted on X that he was issuing a cease-and-desist order to the Trump campaign to stop his music from being played at the president's events.\n\n\"I object to the President using my song 'Fortunate Son' in any way for his campaign,\" the singer wrote in his statement. \"He is using my words and my voice to portray a message that I do not endorse.\"\n\nFogerty said he wrote the song because, as a veteran of the Vietnam War, he was \"disgusted that some people were allowed to be excluded from serving our country because they had access to political and financial privilege.\"\n\nThe singer said Trump is a \"prime example of both of these issues.\"\n\nIn September 2020, Fogerty spoke out about the Trump campaign using his song at a Freeland, Michigan Rally, where the president walked off Air Force One to the Creedence Clearwater Revival song.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhil Collins' team has told the Trump campaign to stop playing \"In the Air Tonight.\"\n\nAfter the Trump campaign played Phil Collins' song \"In the Air Tonight\" during an Iowa rally on October 14, 2020, Collins and his team served them a cease-and-desist order, according to Billboard.\n\nTMZ obtained a copy of the cease-and-desist letter, in which Collins' attorney, David A. Steinberg, wrote that the campaign's playing of the song was \"apparently intended as a satirical reference to Covid-19,\" which can spread by airborne transmission.\n\nHe also wrote, \"Mr. Collins has serious concerns that the manner in which the Trump campaign has used 'In the Air Tonight' has caused, and will cause, damage to Mr. Collins' reputation and popularity with the public.\"\n\nAt the time, a representative for the singer told Consequence of Sound, \"Yes we are well aware of the Trump campaign's use of this song and we have already issued a 'cease and desist' letter via our lawyers who continue to monitor the situation.\"\n\nConsequences of Sound reported that Collins' team previously sent the Trump campaign a cease and desist in June after they played \"In the Air Tonight\" at an event in Tulsa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrendon Urie of Panic! At The Disco told Trump to stop playing one of his songs.\n\nOn X, the Panic! At The Disco frontman told Trump's campaign to stop playing his song \"High Hopes,\" which played as the president walked on stage at a 2020 rally in Phoenix, Arizona, per USA Today.\n\n\"Dear Trump Campaign, Fuck you. You're not invited. Stop playing my song. No thanks, Brendon Urie, Panic! At The Disco & company,\" the musician wrote on X.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNeil Young was one of the first musicians to tell Trump to stop playing his music.\n\nIn 2015, Neil Young began his battle with Trump over the usage of his hit song, \"Rockin' in the Free World.\"\n\nTrump was using his song during his official presidential campaign announcement. Rolling Stone obtained the statement from Young's representatives, which stated:\n\n\"Donald Trump was not authorized to use 'Rockin' in the Free World' in his presidential candidacy announcement. Neil Young, a Canadian citizen, is a supporter of Bernie Sanders for President of the United States of America.\"\n\nBut despite disapproval from the artist, a representative for Trump's campaign told Rolling Stone that the song was being used legally.\n\nPer The Hollywood Reporter, in August, Young filed a copyright-infringement lawsuit against the Trump campaign for playing his songs, including \"Rockin' in the Free World\" and \"Devil's Sidewalk,\" at campaign rallies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRihanna's team sent a cease-and-desist notice to the White House.\n\nIn 2018, Rhianna discovered her music was being played during one of his rallies via X.\n\nIn response to a post on X from The Washington Post reporter Philip Rucker about her music being used, she posted, \"Not for much longer…me nor my people would ever be at or around one of those tragic rallies, so thanks for the heads up philip!\"\n\nShortly after Rihanna posted on X in regards to her disapproval, her team sent out a cease-and-desist notice, Rolling Stone reported.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElton John said he doesn't want his music used in American election campaigns.\n\nWhile running for president, Trump used Elton John's songs \"Rocket Man\" and \"Tiny Dancer\" as warm-up music for his campaign rallies.\n\nBut the iconic singer has made it clear his views are different from Trump's and he doesn't want his music involved in American politics.\n\n\"I don't really want my music to be involved in anything to do with an American election campaign. I'm British. I've met Donald Trump, he was very nice to me, it's nothing personal, his political views are his own, mine are very different, I'm not a Republican in a million years,\" John told The Guardian in 2016.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nR.E.M. said they sent a cease-and-desist notice to Donald Trump.\n\nIn 2016, when the band's frontrunner Michael Stipe found out that Trump was frequently using R.E.M.'s hit song, \"It's the End of the World,\" at his campaign rallies, the entire band sent him a cease-and-desist notice.\n\nAccording to Vulture, they later confirmed the legal matter in a Facebook statement and also told the media and American voters to focus on the \"bigger picture.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdele spoke out against Trump once he started using her music at rallies.\n\nIn 2016, upon finding out that Trump was playing her music at his events, Adele's spokesperson announced that Adele never gave then-candidate Trump permission to use her music.\n\nAccording to Vulture, the singer went on to endorse Hillary Clinton during a concert on the US leg of her tour.\n\n\"Don't vote for him,\" she said of Trump, per Vulture. \"I am English, but what happens in America affects me, too. I am 100% for Hillary Clinton.

I have to speak to him, as a friend. He was respectful enough to call me and say, 'How do you feel about me using this?'
