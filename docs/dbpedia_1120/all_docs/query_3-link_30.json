        "text": "The Saint-Gobain Cup âMusic Lights up Dreamsâ was the theme of the 29thannual Tongji University Campus Top Ten Singers Competition, which was held in the universityâs auditorium on the evening of Dec. 9th. Vice Chairman of the University Council Prof. Jianping XU, heads of related departments of the university and leaders of Saint-Gobain Group attended the concert to enjoy the splendid music of the contestants, together with about three thousand teachers and students of Tongji.\n\nThe competition has been long anticipated as contestants began preparing in early October. More than 500 applicants from 33 schools and departments took part in the competition, including many international students. Ultimately, 24 students from 15 groups of contestants advanced to the final competition. Finalists represented bands and vocalists from both the Siping and Jiading campuses and from both the undergraduate and postgraduate schools. These wonderful musicians fired up the audience with their wonderful performances including folk style, bel canto, pop music, and original songs.\n\nAfter an intermediary match, 15 contestants entered the final themed competition, Music Lights up Dreams. There were three rounds in the final competition. In the first round, professional judges individually evaluated each contestantâs performance; scores were then combined to determine the final outcome. In the second round, performances were scored by a combination of public and professional judges. Two contestants in the best group advanced to the next round along with one contestant from each of the other groups. In the final round, the top four contestants competed against each other, of which two of them then sang for the championship. In the championship round, Hero was sung by Kailan WEN and âDo you Want to Build a Snowman?â was sung by Tingting QIU; these songs provided a beautiful climax to the evening by creating an exhilarating atmosphere which deeply touched the audience.\n\nIn the end, Kailan WEN from the School of Arts and Media won the championship with her outstanding performance. Tingting QIU from School of Civil Engineering and Jiajie XU from the School of Design and Creativity were awarded the second and third places. The Award of Popularity was given to the band âNevers.â A German student, Balduin Benesch (Baide), received the Award of Highest Potential and Kailan WEN won the Award for Best Stage Manners.\n\nTranslated by May Language Studio based upon\n\nhttp://news.tongji.edu.cn/classid-10-newsid-45543-t-show.html"
