        "text": "The controversy surrounding the Paris Olympics opening ceremony is still not over.\n\nFollowing an uproar over a portrayal of Da Vinci's \"Last Supper\" and a surge of online abuse directed at its protagonist, Barbara Butch, French police have launched a formal investigation.\n\nIt comes after the DJ and LGBTQ+ icon filed acomplaint over online harassment, death threats, and insults.\n\nHer lawyer, Audrey Msellati, said that the legal action does not target any specific individuals.\n\nThe case is being handled by a Paris police unit specialising in hate crimes. The probe will focus on \"discriminatory messages based on religion or sexual orientation that were sent to her or posted online,\" according to the authorities.\n\nButch's lawyer says the activist is in \"a fighting spirit\" and still very proud of her participation.\n\n\"She's strong, she's out of the state of shock and she's just ready to fight in a very good manner. And she's proud too because she knows that it was a great honour for her to be to represent France,\" the lawyer said.\n\nWhat did organisers say about the depiction?\n\nThe opening ceremony's artistic director Thomas Jolly guaranteed his work wasn't all inspired by \"The Last Supper\".\n\nCritics interpreted part of the show that featured Butch as a mockery of Leonardo Da Vinci’s painting showing Jesus Christ and his apostles.\n\nFrench Catholic bishops and others were among those who said Christians had been hurt and offended.\n\nBut Paris Olympics organisers have said there was \"never an intention to show disrespect to any religious group\" and that the intent was to \"celebrate community tolerance\" instead.\n\nButch, who calls herself a \"love activist,\" wore a silver headdress that looked like a halo as she got a party going during her segment of the show.\n\nDrag artists, dancers and others flanked Butch on both sides."
