        "text": "CDC recommends that people get MMR vaccine to protect against measles, mumps, and rubella. Children should get two doses of MMR vaccine, starting with the first dose at 12 to 15 months of age, and the second dose at 4 through 6 years of age. Teens and adults should also be up to date on their MMR vaccination. Two MMR vaccines are available for use in the United States, M-M-R II and PRIORIX. M-M-R II and PRIORIX are fully interchangeable for all indications for which MMR vaccination is recommended. Children may also get MMRV vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (chickenpox). This vaccine is only licensed for use in children who are 12 months through 12 years of age.\n\nWho Should Get MMR Vaccine?\n\nChildren\n\nCDC recommends all children get two doses of MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) vaccine, starting with the first dose at 12 through 15 months of age, and the second dose at 4 through 6 years of age. Children can receive the second dose earlier as long as it is at least 28 days after the first dose.\n\nLearn about MMRV vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (chickenpox). This vaccine is only licensed for use in children who are 12 months through 12 years of age.\n\nStudents at post-high school educational institutions\n\nStudents at post-high school educational institutions who do not have presumptive evidence of immunity need two doses of MMR vaccine, separated by at least 28 days.\n\nAdults\n\nAdults who do not have presumptive evidence of immunity should get at least one dose of MMR vaccine.\n\nCertain adults may need 2 doses. Adults who are going to be in a setting that poses a high risk for measles or mumps transmission should make sure they have had two doses separated by at least 28 days. These adults include\n\nstudents at post-high school education institutions\n\nhealthcare personnel\n\ninternational travelers\n\nInternational travelers\n\nPeople 6 months of age and older who will be traveling internationally should be protected against measles. Before any international travel—\n\nInfants 6 through 11 months of age should receive one dose of MMR vaccine. Infants who get one dose of MMR vaccine before their first birthday should get two more doses (one dose at 12 through 15 months of age and another dose separated by at least 28 days).\n\nChildren 12 months of age and older should receive two doses of MMR vaccine, separated by at least 28 days.\n\nTeenagers and adults who do not have presumptive evidence of immunity against measles should get two doses of MMR vaccine separated by at least 28 days.\n\nSee also, Travel Information (Measles | Mumps | Rubella)\n\nHealthcare personnel\n\nHealthcare personnel should have documented presumptive evidence of immunity, according to the recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [48 pages]. Healthcare personnel without evidence of immunity should get two doses of MMR vaccine, separated by at least 28 days.\n\nWomen of Childbearing Age\n\nWomen of childbearing age should check with their doctor to make sure they are vaccinated before they get pregnant. Women of childbearing age who are not pregnant and do not have presumptive evidence of immunity should get at least one dose of MMR vaccine.\n\nIt is safe for breastfeeding women to receive MMR vaccination. Breastfeeding does not interfere with the response to MMR vaccine, and the baby will not be affected by the vaccine through breast milk.\n\nGroups at increased risk for mumps because of a mumps outbreak\n\nDuring a mumps outbreak, public health authorities might recommend an additional dose of MMR vaccine for people who belong to groups at increased risk for getting mumps. These groups are usually those who are likely to have close contact, such as sharing sport equipment or drinks, kissing, or living in close quarters, with a person who has mumps. Your local public health authorities or institution will communicate to the groups at increased risk that they should receive this dose. If you already have two doses of MMR, it is not necessary to seek out vaccination unless you are part of this group.\n\nTop of Page\n\nWho Should Not Get MMR Vaccine?\n\nMeasles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccine\n\nSome people should not get MMR vaccine or should wait.\n\nTell your vaccine provider if the person getting the vaccine:\n\nHas any severe, life-threatening allergies. A person who has ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction after a dose of MMR vaccine, or has a severe allergy to any part of this vaccine, may be advised not to be vaccinated. Ask your health care provider if you want information about vaccine components.\n\nIs pregnant or thinks she might be pregnant. Pregnant women should wait to get MMR vaccine until after they are no longer pregnant. Women should avoid getting pregnant for at least 1 month after getting MMR vaccine.\n\nHas a weakened immune system due to disease (such as cancer or HIV/AIDS) or medical treatments (such as radiation, immunotherapy, steroids, or chemotherapy).\n\nHas a parent, brother, or sister with a history of immune system problems.\n\nHas ever had a condition that makes them bruise or bleed easily.\n\nHas recently had a blood transfusion or received other blood products. You might be advised to postpone MMR vaccination for 3 months or more.\n\nHas tuberculosis.\n\nHas gotten any other vaccines in the past 4 weeks. Live vaccines given too close together might not work as well.\n\nIs not feeling well. A mild illness, such as a cold, is usually not a reason to postpone a vaccination. Someone who is moderately or severely ill should probably wait. Your doctor can advise you.\n\nThis information was taken directly from the MMR (Measles, Mumps & Rubella) Vaccine information Statement (VIS) dated 2/12/2018.\n\nLearn who should not get MMRV vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (chickenpox). This vaccine is only licensed for use in children who are 12 months through 12 years of age.\n\nWho Does Not Need MMR Vaccine?\n\nYou do not need measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine if you meet any of these criteria for presumptive evidence of immunity*:\n\nYou have written documentation of adequate vaccination:\n\nat least one dose of a measles, mumps, and rubella virus-containing vaccine administered on or after the first birthday for preschool-age children and adults not at high risk for exposure and transmission\n\ntwo doses of measles and mumps virus-containing vaccine for school-age children and adults at high risk for exposure and transmission, including college students, healthcare personnel, international travelers, and groups at increased risk during outbreaks\n\nYou have laboratory confirmation of past infection or had blood tests that show you are immune to measles, mumps, and rubella.\n\nYou were born before 1957.**\n\nIf you do not have presumptive evidence of immunity against measles, mumps, and rubella, talk with your doctor about getting vaccinated. If you’re unsure whether you’ve been vaccinated, you should first try to find your vaccination records. If you do not have written documentation of MMR vaccine, you should get vaccinated. The MMR vaccine is safe, and there is no harm in getting another dose if you may already be immune to measles, mumps, or rubella.\n\nIf you received a measles vaccine in the 1960s, you may not need to be revaccinated. People who have documentation of receiving LIVE measles vaccine in the 1960s do not need to be revaccinated. People who were vaccinated prior to 1968 with either inactivated (killed) measles vaccine or measles vaccine of unknown type should be revaccinated with at least one dose of live attenuated measles vaccine. This recommendation is intended to protect those who may have received killed measles vaccine, which was available in 1963-1967 and was not effective.\n\n*Except during a mumps outbreak. During a mumps outbreak public health authorities might recommend an additional dose of MMR vaccine for people who belong to groups at increased risk for getting mumps, regardless if they meet the criteria listed above.\n\n**Birth before 1957 provides only presumptive evidence for measles, mumps, and rubella. Before vaccines were available, nearly everyone was infected with measles, mumps, and rubella viruses during childhood. The majority of people born before 1957 are likely to have been infected naturally and therefore are presumed to be protected against measles, mumps, and rubella. Healthcare personnel born before 1957 without laboratory evidence of immunity or disease should consider getting two doses of MMR vaccine.\n\nTop of Page\n\nHow Well Does the MMR Vaccine Work?\n\nMMR vaccine is very effective at protecting people against measles, mumps, and rubella, and preventing the complications caused by these diseases. People who receive MMR vaccination according to the U.S. vaccination schedule are usually considered protected for life against measles and rubella. While MMR provides effective protection against mumps for most people, immunity against mumps may decrease over time and some people may no longer be protected against mumps later in life. An additional dose may be needed if you are at risk because of a mumps outbreak.\n\nOne dose of MMR vaccine is 93% effective against measles, 78% effective against mumps, and 97% effective against rubella.\n\nTwo doses of MMR vaccine are 97% effective against measles and 88% effective against mumps.\n\nMMR is an attenuated (weakened) live virus vaccine. This means that after injection, the viruses cause a harmless infection in the vaccinated person with very few, if any, symptoms before they are eliminated from the body. The person’s immune system fights the infection caused by these weakened viruses, and immunity (the body’s protection from the virus) develops.\n\nSome people who get two doses of MMR vaccine may still get measles, mumps, or rubella if they are exposed to the viruses that cause these diseases. Experts aren’t sure why; it could be that their immune systems didn’t respond as well as they should have to the vaccine or their immune system’s ability to fight the infection decreased over time. However, disease symptoms are generally milder in vaccinated people.\n\nAbout 3 out of 100 people who get two doses of MMR vaccine will get measles if exposed to the virus. However, they are more likely to have a milder illness, and are also less likely to spread the disease to other people.\n\nTwo doses of MMR vaccine are 88% (range 32% to 95%) effective at preventing mumps. Mumps outbreaks can still occur in highly vaccinated U.S. communities, particularly in settings where people have close, prolonged contact, such as universities and close-knit communities. During an outbreak, public health authorities may recommend an additional dose of MMR for people who belong to groups at increased risk for mumps. An additional dose can help improve protection against mumps disease and related complications.\n\nWhile there are not many studies available, most people who do not respond to the rubella component of the first MMR dose would be expected to respond to the second dose.\n\nTop of Page\n\nWhat is MMRV Vaccine?\n\nMMRV vaccine protects against four diseases: measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (chickenpox). This vaccine is only licensed for use in children 12 months through 12 years of age.\n\nCDC recommends that children get one dose of MMRV vaccine at 12 through 15 months of age, and the second dose at 4 through 6 years of age. Children can receive the second dose of MMRV vaccine earlier than 4 through 6 years. This second dose of MMRV vaccine can be given 3 months after the first dose. A doctor can help parents decide whether to use this vaccine or MMR vaccine.\n\nMMRV is given by shot and may be given at the same time as other vaccines.\n\nPlease see the MMRV Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) for more information about who should not get MMRV vaccine or should wait.\n\nFor more information, see\n\nFactsheet: Two Options for Protecting Your Child Against Measles, Mumps, Rubella, and Varicella (MMRV)\n\nVaccine Safety\n\nMeasles, Mumps, Rubella, and Varicella (MMRV) Vaccine\n\nFrequently Asked Questions about Multiple Vaccinations and the Immune System\n\nVaricella (Chickenpox) Vaccination\n\nShould You Get Vaccinated After Being Exposed to Measles, Mumps, or Rubella?\n\nIf you do not have immunity against measles, mumps, and rubella and are exposed to someone with one of these diseases, talk with your doctor about getting MMR vaccine. It is not harmful to get MMR vaccine after being exposed to measles, mumps, or rubella, and doing so may possibly prevent later disease.\n\nIf you get MMR vaccine within 72 hours of initially being exposed to measles, you may get some protection against the disease, or have milder illness. In other cases, you may be given a medicine called immunoglobulin (IG) within six days of being exposed to measles, to provide some protection against the disease, or have milder illness.\n\nUnlike with measles, MMR has not been shown to be effective at preventing mumps or rubella in people already infected with the virus (i.e., post-exposure vaccination is not recommended).\n\nDuring outbreaks of measles or mumps, everyone without presumptive evidence of immunity should be brought up to date on their MMR vaccination. And some people who are already up to date on their MMR vaccination may be recommended to get an additional dose of MMR for added protection against disease.\n\nTop of Page\n\nWhat are the Childcare and School Requirements for MMR Vaccine?\n\nAll 50 states and the District of Columbia (DC) have state laws that require children entering childcare or public schools to have certain vaccinations. There is no federal law that requires this.\n\nThe Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends that all states require children entering childcare, and students starting school, college, and other postsecondary educational institutions to be up to date on MMR vaccination:\n\n1 dose is recommended for preschool-aged children 12 months or older\n\n2 doses are recommended for school-aged children in kindergarten through grade 12 as well as students attending colleges or other post-high school educational institutions\n\nFor more information, see State Vaccination Requirements.\n\nHow Can Parents Pay For MMR Vaccine?\n\nMost health insurance plans cover the cost of vaccines. But you may want to check with your health insurance provider before going to the doctor. Learn how to pay for vaccines.\n\nIf you don’t have insurance or if your insurance does not cover vaccines for your child, the Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program may be able to help. This program helps families of eligible children who might not otherwise have access to vaccines. To find out if your child is eligible, visit the VFC website or ask your child’s doctor. You can also contact your state VFC coordinator.\n\nEducational Materials\n\nCDC Fact Sheets for Parents\n\nMeasles (In English | En Español)\n\nMumps (In English | En Español)\n\nRubella (In English | En Español)\n\nInformation on vaccines.gov (Measles | Mumps | Rubella | Varicella)\n\nCDC Feature Stories\n\nMeasles: Vaccine for Measles\n\nMumps: Be Sure Your Child Is Fully Immunized\n\nRubella: Make Sure Your Child Gets Vaccinated\n\nWhat Would Happen If We Stopped Vaccinations?\n\nQuestions and Answers, Immunization Action Coalition (Measles [4 pages] | Mumps [4 pages] | Rubella [4 pages])\n\nMeasles, mumps, and rubella are serious diseases…Make sure your child is protected!, Immunization Action Coalition (In English [1 page] | En Español [1 page] | по-русски [1 page])\n\nTop of Page"
