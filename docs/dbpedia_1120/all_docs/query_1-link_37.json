        "text": "#10: Justin Bieber\n\nJustin Bieber came onto the scene in 2007 when he was barely pushing 13. While he was definitely breaking hearts and showing off an incredible haircut in the aughts, he really took off in the 2010s. All of Beiber’s efforts in the first half of the decade propelled him toward becoming the first artist ever to have five number one albums in the US by the time he reached voting age. His ventures into other genres, such as EDM and Latin music, have given him broad appeal. Plus, his 2015 album “Purpose” solidified him as one of the most important male artists of his ilk in the decade.\n\n#9: Katy Perry\n\nWhile this pop star's influence might have dropped off in the latter part of the decade, her influence was once so great it’s impossible not to give her a spot. There was a time when you couldn’t turn on the radio without hearing Katy Perry. “Teenage Dream” kicked off the 2010s with five number one singles, and was an unprecedented hit. But later albums like 2013’s “Prism” were just as notable, with songs like “Dark Horse” and “Roar” that overtook the charts. While Perry might not be as ubiquitous as she once was, her influence still looms large. She’s more than earned a spot as one of the best of the decade.\n\n#8: Harry Styles\n\nFrom One Direction to a rising solo career, Harry Styles has had quite the wild past ten years. When One Direction went on hiatus in 2016, it was unclear which of the boys would break through. When Styles’ solo album dropped in 2017, it drew praise from critics, and its lead single “Sign of the Times” climbed up the charts. But it was 2019’s “Fine Line” that made it clear exactly what Styles could do. “Watermelon Sugar” is an earworm if we’ve ever heard one, and one of the best pop songs of the decade.\n\n#7: The Weeknd\n\nAn unknown YouTuber rises to fame and becomes one of the greatest pop stars of a generation. It sounds like a Cinderella story, but for Toronto’s The Weeknd, it’s true. The singer began his career in 2009, uploading songs to YouTube, and released his debut studio album in 2013. His follow-up in 2015, “Beauty Behind the Madness”, contained a plethora of huge pop hits, including “Can’t Feel My Face” and “The Hills.” The Weeknd has only gone up in the estimation of pop history since then. His next two albums, “Starboy” and “After Hours,” were loved by both critics and fans. Headlining the 2021 Super Bowl halftime show ain’t half bad either.\n\n#6: Ariana Grande\n\nIn the early 2010s, we knew her best as Nickelodeon’s Cat Valentine. Over the rest of the decade, Ariana Grande’s transition into popstar took the world by storm. Her first three albums made waves, but it was around the 2018 mark that Ariana cemented her status as an absolute icon. With the releases of “Sweetener” and, of course, “Thank U, Next,” Grande suddenly became huge. She not only proved how talented she was, but also her ability to keep her name in our mouths. And we’ve never stopped talking about her since.\n\n#5: Bruno Mars\n\nThis singer’s sheer talent always steals the spotlight. Bruno Mars has continually reminded us just how skilled he is, with number one hit after number one hit. His albums “Doo-Wops & Hooligans” and “Unorthodox Jukebox” started off the 2010s strong. In 2014, he featured on Mark Ronson’s “Uptown Funk”, sending his career into the stratosphere. Since then, Mars has solidified himself as an R&B/pop mainstay. He’s won over a dozen Grammys, and headlined the Super Bowl. Throughout the decade, he’s shown us how to keep the party going.\n\n#4: Adele\n\nHer voice is undeniable. At the young age of 19, Adele wrote what would become her debut album, helping close the 2000s with a bang. Since then, she’s become one of the most recognizable voices of our lifetimes, thanks to iconic hits like “Rolling in the Deep” and \"Someone like You\". After only two albums, Adele was asked to sing the theme for the James Bond film “Skyfall”, which won her an Oscar. In 2015, her third album “25”, dominated music charts with singles like “Hello” and “When We Were Young”. With four albums now under her belt, and shelves spilling over with Grammys, Adele has become a living legend.\n\n#3: Lady Gaga\n\nWhen it comes to pop music, no star is more sure of herself than Lady Gaga. And she always has been. You could almost say she was … born this way. Lady Gaga’s career has seen many iterations, and she’s dabbled in every genre from disco to soft rock. While some wrote her off as gimmicky when she first broke through, she’s a trained piano player and singer, one of the more talented musicians of her generation. Even when Gaga takes breaks from putting albums out, she’s always looking for ways to innovate. With starring roles in “American Horror Story” and “A Star is Born,” she’s moving surely into the acting world with confidence to spare.\n\n#2: Taylor Swift\n\nThe name Taylor Swift has been in the cultural zeitgeist for so long, it’s hard to remember a time when she wasn’t around. Her debut album was released in 2006 when Swift was just a teenager. Somehow, the pop star has managed to keep herself relevant for over a decade and a half. And now? She’s one of the most important pop stars of the moment. Swift not only continues to elevate and evolve her sound, but she’s figured out a way to keep the world at large interested in what she’s doing. From musical re-releases, to short films, Swift has shown herself to be not just a capable pop star, but a capable businesswoman as well.\n\nBefore we unveil our top pick, here are a few honorable mentions.\n\nLizzo\n\nIt’s About Damn Time We Give Lizzo Her Due\n\nPost Malone\n\nWe’re Running in Circles Over How Much We Love Post Malone\n\nDemi Lovato\n\nSorry Not Sorry, We Love Demi\n\nEd Sheeran\n\nEd Sheeran Is Part of the Pop A-Team\n\nLorde\n\nShe May Not Be Royal, but She’s a Star\n\n#1: Beyoncé\n\nWho run the world? Beyoncé. There is no pop star more in control, more enigmatic, and more on top of her game than Beyoncé Knowles-Carter. Beyoncé is another pop star who has been in our lives for so long, it’s hard to believe she’s maintained as much relevance as she has. Not only has Beyoncé done that, she has maintained status. When Beyoncé releases an album, no matter how much time has passed in between, the world stops. When Beyoncé goes on tour, we all drop everything to buy tickets. She has taken over our lives, and we welcome the takeover."
