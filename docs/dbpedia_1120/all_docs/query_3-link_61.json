Let us know in the comments below!\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest is an annual international song competition which mainly features a mix of European countries.\n\nA few non-European nations - such as Australia and Israel - also take part.\n\nThe contest has become known for its loyal fans as well as some very flamboyant and sometimes bonkers performances!\n\nIt's helped launch the careers of some famous musicians over the years, including ABBA, CÃ©line Dion and MÃ¥neskin.\n\nThe act they enjoyed the most is awarded the maximum 12 points, followed by 10 points for their second favourite song, then eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two and one point.\n\nSince 2023 there is also a \"rest of the world\" vote, with points given to the 10 most popular songs worldwide.\n\nTwenty-seven countries have won the contest since it first started.\n\nHowever, the countries with the highest number of wins are Ireland and Sweden - with seven.\n\nThe UK has won the contest five times - in 1967, 1969, 1976, 1981 and 1997.\n\nIt has also finished second a record 16 times, including Sam Ryder's performance in 2022 with his hit Space Man."
