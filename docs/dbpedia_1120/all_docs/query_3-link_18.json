Apart from his songs he is well-known for his great choral works, for instance Canto General (1982) (text by Pablo Neruda) and the oratorio \"Axion Esti\" (1960) (text by Nobel Prize winner Odysseas Elytis). His soundtrack for Zorba the Greek (1964) made him famous all over the world.\n\nMikis Theodorakis passed away on September 2, 2021 at the age of 96.\n\nThe music of Morten Lauridsen, recipient of the National Medal of Arts, occupies a permanent place in the standard vocal repertoire of the Twenty-First Century. His seven vocal cycles, instrumental works and his series of a cappella sacred motets (including O Magnum Mysterium) are regularly performed throughout the world by distinguished artists and ensembles and have been recorded on over two hundred CDs. His five Grammy nominations include two recordings named \"Lux Aeterna\" performed by top-class ensembles.\n\nA native of the Pacific Northwest, Lauridsen first worked as a fire-fighter and staff member of the Forest Service near Mount St. Helens before coming to Los Angeles in order to study composition with Ingolf Dahl, Halsey Stevens, Robert Linn and Harold Owen. He chaired the Department of Composition at the USC Thornton School of Music from 1990-2002 and founded the School’s Advanced Studies Program in Film Scoring.\n\nHis choral works \"O Magnum Mysterium\", \"Dirait-on\", \"O Nata Lux\" and \"Sure On This Shining Night\" are the all-time bestsellers.

In 2007 he was awarded the National Medal of Arts, the highest artistic award in the United States, by the President in a White House ceremony “for his composition of radiant choral works combining musical beauty, power, and spiritual depth.” He now divides his time between Los Angeles and his summer cabin on a remote island off the northwest coast of Washington State.\n\nMore information on Mr. Lauridsen at www.mortenlauridsen.net\n\nProfessor Zheng Xiaoying, first ever female orchestra conductor in China.

Dr. Yoon started his career as a conductor in 1970 when he led the World Vision Children’s Choir. While conducting choirs such as the Daewoo choir, the Seoul Ladies’ Singers and the Incheon City Chorale, he aimed to close the gap between Korean and global choral music by spreading Korean choral music throughout the whole world. At the same time, he aimed to popularize choral music in South Korea, which was formerly considered as an exclusive activity of a certain social class.\n\nMaestro Yoon’s numerous choral activities include amongst other his engagement as the Chairman of the Board for Korean Federation for Choral Music, President of the KCMA, permanent conductor of the Daewoo Choir, Director of the IFCM and Dean of the College of Music at the Chung-Ang University.

Wehrle also had conducted the school’s chamber choir since the end of World War II and achieved great success and high appreciation at both national and international level.\n\nWorking for music in general and choral music in particular Wehrle acted in institutions that since decades have been instrumental in shaping the international music scene. He was Secretary General of the “European Choral Association” (Europa Cantat) from 1963 to 1976 and he laid the foundations for the “International Federation for Choral Music” (IFCM) whose first President he became in 1982. Also the World Symposium on Choral Music is based on Paul Wehrle’s idea.\n\nPaul Wehrle was a tireless visionary and motivator who was able to arrange a national choral competition in the German Music Council and to establish solo singing at “Jugend musiziert” (German music competition). Paul Wehrle received multiple awards for his wide commitment: 1983 he was awarded the Medal of Merit of the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, in 2007 the Golden Staufer Medal and in 1989 he received the Federal Cross of Merit First Class.\n\nFor INTERKULTUR Paul Wehrle was one of the pioneers for the World Choir Games and since the year 2000 his valuable support and advice had played a part in establishing the “Olympics of the Choirs”. The idea of the World Choir Council, an advisory board consisting of representatives from more than 90 nations by now, comes from Wehrle as well.\n\nTo the last Paul Wehrle was available as a tireless contact person and idea contributor for INTERKULTUR and enthusiastically observed our progression.\n\n- in memoriam -\n\nEric Ericson has been called the nestor of Swedish choral music, and had a huge international influence both as a conductor and a teacher.
