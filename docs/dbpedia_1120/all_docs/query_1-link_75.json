        "text": "Well, I was thinking about all the artists who don't even write their songs, and what I have concluded is that when a singer sings only stuff written by others, automatically forfeits the right to be called \"an artist\". You are an artist when you convey and express your outlook on life, love e.t.c through your art. Through what you create. People nowadays don't credit songwriters enough. They don't acknowledge how much inspiration, effort and passion writing a song demands. They think lyrics come out of anything easily... That's not true whatsoever. Being a songwriter myself, I know the struggles you sometimes have to face, or the absolute concentration you need to possess.\n\nWhat I'm trying to get across, is that the singer who sings a song written by others, is just practically the vessel to the original songwriter. His/her voice is nothing but a tube through which the original songwriter's art is transmitted. Consequently there's no art when it comes to the vessel itself, no creativity, no passion. It's the songwriter who has to be identified as \"the artist\" of the song. And that's why I don't have a lot of respect for singers who don't write their stuff. That's why I snub them.\n\nI'd appreciate it if you didn't start with the drama and mention sh*t like \"Oh but there were so many legendary singers who didn't write their stuff\" I'm clearly referring to the art of singing, and just because they were legendary doesn't mean they were artistic. You can't be artistic by singing something and only as art is personal expression."
