The rupture of the primary coolant system caused the water pressure in the aft reactor to drop to zero and causing failure of the coolant pumps. Eight crew members died within three weeks of the accident, and others were successfully treated for deadly doses of radiation.[18]\n\nLa Notte by Michelangelo Antonioni won the Golden Bear Award for Best Film at the 11th Berlin International Film Festival.\n\nBorn:\n\nHesham Mohamed Hadayet, Egyptian terrorist who was involved and killed in the 2002 Los Angeles Airport shooting\n\nAndrew Zimmern, American chef and television host; in New York City\n\nThe first Israeli rocket, Shavit 2, was launched.[19][20] At 4:41 a.m., the missile, ostensibly for \"meteorological research\" rather than for carrying warheads, was sent up \"from a secret installation on the Mediterranean\".[21]\n\nTunisia announced that it was claiming the French military base located at Bizerte, which had been the only base remaining after France had withdrawn all of its forces in 1958.[22]\n\nIn Moscow, North Korea and the Soviet Union signed a \"Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance\", providing that if one of the nations was in a state of war, the other one would extend military assistance. Five days later, North Korea signed a similar treaty with the People's Republic of China.[23]\n\nMorocco signed a treaty with Algerian rebels led by Ferhat Abbas, pledging support for the independence movement against France, and agreeing that any further negotiations on the border between the two nations would be made after independence.[24]\n\nBorn: Benita Fitzgerald-Brown, American track athlete and 1984 Olympic gold medalist; in Warrenton, Virginia\n\nDied:\n\nEdwin Bush, 21, British murderer who had been the first to be convicted based on the identikit system, was hanged at HM Prison Pentonville in London.\n\nScott LaFaro, 25, American jazz bassist who was one third of the Bill Evans Trio, was killed in an auto accident near Avon, New York.\n\nCuno Amiet, 92, Swiss artist\n\nMcDonnell Aircraft Corporation summarized its studies of the redesigned Mercury spacecraft for Space Task Group's senior staff. McDonnell had considered three configurations: (1) the minimum-change capsule, modified only to improve accessibility and handling, with an adapter added to carry such items as extra batteries; (2) a reconfigured capsule with an ejection seat installed and most of the equipment exterior to the pressure vessel on highly accessible pallets; and (3) a two-man capsule, similar to the reconfigured capsule except for the modification required for two rather than one-man operation. The capsule would be brought down on two Mercury-type main parachutes, the ejection seat serving as a redundant system.[25]\n\nA mine explosion in Czechoslovakia killed 108 coal miners. The blast, which happened at the Dukla mine at Karviná, Czech Republic, caused an underground fire that prevented rescuers from reaching the trapped men.[26][27]\n\nRod Laver of Australia defeated American Chuck McKinley in straight sets, 6–3, 6–1 and 6–4 to win the tennis championship at Wimbledon.[28]\n\nBorn:\n\nWelshman Ncube, Zimbabwean politician, founder of the Movement for Democratic Change – Ncube and former Minister of Industry and Commerce from 2009 to 2013; in Gwelo, Southern Rhodesia\n\nEric Jerome Dickey, American author; in Memphis, Tennessee (died of cancer, 2021)\n\nMichael Kieran Harvey, Australian pianist; in Sydney\n\nDied: Georgy Aleksandrov, 53, Soviet Marxist philosopher\n\nJohn Profumo, the British Secretary of State for War, was introduced to Christine Keeler at a party. The extramarital affair that followed, and Profumo's false statements about it to Parliament, caused a scandal in 1963 that led to his resignation; and may have been a factor in the retirement later that year of Prime Minister Harold Macmillan and the defeat of the Conservative Party in the 1964 elections.[29]\n\nDissatisfied with life in the Soviet Union, American defector Lee Harvey Oswald flew from Minsk to Moscow, then went to the American Embassy to ask for the return of his U.S. Passport, #1733242. His passport was returned, and he, his wife, and his daughter departed for the United States the following year.[30]\n\nThe United Klans of America was created by the merger of several different racist groups meeting at Indian Springs, Georgia, seeking a revival of the Ku Klux Klan.

Khrushchev gave the go-ahead for physicists Andrei Sakharov and Yakov Zeldovich to test a 100 megaton hydrogen bomb, the largest up to that time, which, Sakharov would say later, Khrushchev would call a device that would \"hang over capitalists like the sword of Damocles\".[37]\n\nMildred Gillars, nicknamed \"Axis Sally\", was released from the women's federal prison in Alderson, West Virginia, after serving 12 years of a sentence for treason. An American citizen, she moved to Berlin in 1934; during World War II, she was \"the starring voice of Nazi propaganda\" in English-language radio broadcasts aimed at American troops in Europe.[38]\n\nThe German Banking Act was passed, creating a federal bank regulating agency, the Bundesaufsichtsamt für das Kreditwesen (Federal Bank Supervisory Office).[39]\n\nBorn: Liyel Imoke, Nigerian politician and state governor; in Ibadan\n\nFollowing a contest to come up with a name for an artificial lake, near Mount Isa, Queensland, Australia, created in 1958 by a dam on the Leichhardt River, the winning entry was selected from 471 suggested names. Lake Moondarra, the entry suggested by 9-year-old Danny Driscoll, is said to have been an Australian aboriginal (Murri-language) name that means 'plenty of rain, also thunder'.[40]\n\nFive days after signing a friendship and military assistance treaty with the Soviet Union, North Korea signed a similar agreement with the People's Republic of China. Together, the two treaties established a balance of power at the 38th parallel, between the northern allies (North Korea, the USSR and China) and the southern allies (South Korea and the U.S.).[23]\n\nUnited Airlines Flight 859, a DC-8 jet, crashed while landing in Denver, killing 17 of the 115 people on board and one person on the ground.[41][42]\n\nBorn: Ophir Pines-Paz, Israeli Minister of Internal Affairs; in Rishon LeZion\n\nThe TIROS-3 satellite was launched from Florida, and the MIDAS-3 satellite was fired into orbit from California.[43] TIROS-3 would become the first satellite to photograph storms during the 1961 Atlantic hurricane season.[44] The MIDAS-3 spy satellite reached orbit, but ran out of power after only five orbits when its solar power arrays failed to completely deploy.[45]\n\nAn alleged \"unexplained incident\" is said to have occurred in Shreveport, Louisiana, when peaches \"fell from the sky\" on a group of carpenters roofing a house. Though oft-repeated,[46] there were no contemporary accounts of such an occurrence[47] and the earliest mention appears to have been in a 1978 book.[48]\n\nThe Voynich manuscript was sold for the last time, to bookdealer Hans Kraus for $24,500. Although the undeciphered medieval book had been the subject of much study, and Kraus asked as much as $160,000 for it, he had no takers, and finally donated it to Yale University in 1969.[49]\n\nA Czechoslovakian Airlines Ilyushin-18 turboprop airplane crashed while attempting to make a landing in Casablanca, Morocco, killing all 72 people on board.

He later would be indicted for homicide in the multiple deaths of patients at the Riverdell Hospital in Oradell, New Jersey.[52]\n\nA dam at Panshet in India burst, causing massive flooding in the city of Pune. Although there was significant damage to property, there was little to no loss of human life.\n\nThe first Ohrid Summer Festival opened in Macedonia.\n\nBorn: Robert Shafran, Eddy Galland and David Kellman, subjects of the 2018 documentary Three Identical Strangers, were born at Long Island Jewish Medical Center and put up for adoption to three separate families, each unaware of the multiple birth. By chance, the identical triplets would discover each other in 1980,[53] and would find out that the Louise Wise Agency had secretly studied them to gather data on separation of twins and triplets.[54]\n\nDied:\n\nRoger Tredwell, 76, American diplomat, best known for his imprisonment during the Russian Revolution in 1918\n\nMazo de la Roche, 82, Canadian novelist[55]\n\nIn \"the last of the early Cold War spy cases\",[56] Robert Soblen was convicted of espionage for the Soviet Union against the United States. Sentenced to life imprisonment, but allowed to post bail while the conviction was on appeal, Soblen fled to Israel. He would take an overdose of barbiturates while awaiting deportation back to the U.S. and die on September 11, 1962.\n\nBorn: Anders Järryd, Swedish tennis player and winner of eight Grand Slam men's doubles titles (3 French Open, 2 Wimbledon and U.S. Open, one Australian Open); in Lidköping\n\nMartti Miettunen, the Governor of Lapland, replaced Vieno Johannes Sukselainen as Prime Minister of Finland.

On June 18, Brumel had reached 2.23 meters, appearing to have bested the record set in 1960 by American John Thomas, until Thomas's 1960 record of 7 feet, 3+3⁄4 inches, was recalculated from 2.22 to 2.23.[62] When Brumel and Thomas competed against each other at the U.S.-USSR dual track and field meet in Moscow, Brumel set a new mark of 2.24 m or 7'4\". At the same meet, Ralph Boston broke his own record in the long jump, reaching 8.28 m or 27'2\".[63]\n\nBorn:\n\nVeton Surroi, Kosovo Albanian newspaper publisher and politician, founder of the Reformist Party ORA; in Pristina, SR Serbia, Yugoslavia\n\nJeremy Hardy, English comedian and broadcaster; in Farnborough, Hampshire (died of cancer, 2019)\n\nDied: Ty Cobb, 74, American baseball player who was the American League batting champion 12 times during the 13 seasons between 1907 and 1919, and was one of the first players to be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.[64]\n\nThe Basque separatist group ETA (Euskadi Ta Askatasuna) carried out its first act of terrorism on the 25th anniversary of the 1936 uprising that brought Francisco Franco to power in Spain, by sabotaging a train carrying hundreds of veterans to San Sebastián. Whether it was a plan \"to derail the trains without harming any of the passengers\",[65] or an action which, \"had it not been discovered...might well have caused injuries or even deaths\",[66] no trains were derailed, but the Franco government arrested more than 100 Basque activists and sentenced many of them to long prison terms. The ETA responded by stepping up its attacks.\n\nAt a council in Zagorsk of bishops of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Alexy I of Moscow pressured the assembled group to approve changes in the laws of the church. The new rules, demanded by Nikita Khrushchev in a meeting with Alexy, transferred control of affairs in the various parishes from the local priests to committees of three laymen who would follow the guidance of the Soviet Communist Party.[67]\n\nMeeting at Bad Godesberg in West Germany, the leaders of the six European Economic Community nations (Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and West Germany) agreed to a plan to hold regular summits, and to further the goals of \"political unification\" of the Common Market nations, a forerunner of the European Community.[68]\n\nBorn: Elizabeth McGovern, American film actress and singer; in Evanston, Illinois\n\nDied:\n\nAlfréd Deésy, 73, Hungarian actor and film director\n\nHod Eller, 67, American baseball pitcher\n\nTunisia sent troops to surround France's naval base at Bizerte, beginning a standoff between the two nations.

French losses were 13 dead and 35 wounded. The Tunisians suffered 670 dead and 1,555 wounded.[72]\n\nAn Aerolíneas Argentinas Flight 644 DC-6 airplane crashed while flying from Buenos Aires to Comodoro Rivadavia, killing all 67 people on board. The plane had been attempting to make an emergency landing at Azul and burst into flames after crashing near Chachari.[73]\n\nThe first regularly scheduled in-flight movie service began, as a TWA flight from New York to Los Angeles showed By Love Possessed to its first-class customers.[74]\n\nThe submarine USS Theodore Roosevelt (SSBN-600) began its first deterrent patrol, loaded with Polaris missiles.\n\nThe first moves were made in the formation of the NATO Tiger Association.\n\nBorn:\n\nHarsha Bhogle, Indian cricket commentator and journalist; in Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh state\n\nNoriyuki Abe, Japanese anime storyboard artist, sound director and director; in Kyoto[75]\n\nDied: Hjalmar Gullberg, 63, Swedish poet, committed suicide\n\nMeeting in Cairo, the Council of the Arab League voted to admit Kuwait as its 11th member nation, and to send troops to replace the British in protecting the newly independent state from annexation by Iraq. Admission of new members required unanimous approval by the representatives present, but Iraq's Foreign Minister, Hashim Jawad, had made the mistake of boycotting the meeting in protest.[76]\n\nThree years after Egypt and Syria had merged their governments to form the United Arab Republic, with Egypt's Gamal Abdel Nasser as president, Nasser nationalized Syria's banks, insurance companies, and other private businesses.

The storm would strengthen into a Category 2 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale before dissipating on July 24, causing a fatality and $300,000 (1961 USD) in damage, mostly in Central America.[78]\n\nAfter two years of living and working in Minsk, American defector Lee Harvey Oswald applied to the Soviet Union for an exit visa so that he could return to the United States. He, his wife and daughter were finally granted permission to leave on May 30, 1962.[79]\n\nWhat is now the Barzilai Medical Center opened at Ashkelon, Israel, and is named for Yisrael Barzilai.\n\nGus Grissom, piloting the Mercury-Redstone 4 capsule Liberty Bell 7, became the second American astronaut to go into space. Grissom lifted off from Cape Canaveral at 7:20 a.m. From lift-off to reentry, operational sequences were similar to those of the first crewed suborbital flight, Mercury-Redstone 3. In the ballistic trajectory, Grissom reached a peak altitude of 118 miles (190 km) without attaining orbit, then descended in his capsule by parachute, with splashdown 303 statute miles downrange from Cape Canaveral at 7:36. Grissom's flight experience was similar to Alan Shepard's in that there was a 5-minute period of weightlessness, and neither reported any ill effects resulting from this condition. The MR-4 pilot also found it easy to control his spacecraft attitude in the manual mode of operation. The explosive side egress hatch opened prematurely while Grissom was awaiting helicopter pickup. The astronaut escaped and swam to safety as the capsule filled with water.[1][80][81] Although a helicopter managed to secure the capsule and attempted to lift it, weight of the water added 4,000 pounds (1,800 kg) to the load. The $5,000,000 Mercury spacecraft was cut loose and sank to the bottom of the ocean, and would not be found until May 1999.[82][83] Grissom almost drowned when water filled his suit, and a 10-foot (3.0 m) long shark was observed in the water soon after his rescue. Grissom would die in 1967, unable to escape the capsule of Apollo 1 when it caught fire.[84] An unidentified NASA official commented, \"We've got only one Gus, but we've got plenty of space capsules.\"[85] With this second successful suborbital flight, the Space Task Group felt there was nothing further to be gained from this phase of Project Mercury, and the remaining Redstone launch vehicle flights were canceled.[1]\n\nAlaska Airlines Flight 779, a Douglas DC-6 delivering 26,000 pounds (12,000 kg) of cargo to Japan, crashed 300 feet (91 m) short of the runway as it came in for a landing at the Shemya Air Force Base in Alaska, killing the crew of six.[86] An investigation found that the power cable for the runway approach lights, and to many of the pairs of threshold lights and runway lights, had been cut off two days before the accident to allow construction vehicles to pass, and that nobody had notified the crew of Flight 779.\n\nDominica adopted a new coat of arms, consisting of a shield with two guardian Sisserou Parrots bracing the shield atop of which is a raging lion.\n\nBorn:\n\nMatt Preston, English-Australian food critic, writer, food journalist, television and radio presenter; in London[87]\n\nMorris Iemma, Australian politician and Premier of New South Wales from 2005 to 2008; in Sydney\n\nSergiy Bychkov, Ukrainian politician; in Dnipropetrovsk\n\nDied: Sérvulo Gutiérrez, 47, Peruvian artist\n\nThe Economic Planning Board (EPB) was created by order of South Korean dictator Park Chung Hee, to implement the goals of the Comprehensive Economic Development Five-Year Plan, drafted by three young economists (Kim Song Bom, 37; Paek Yong Chan, 32; and Chong So Yong, 29). South Korea went from being a poor nation to an economic powerhouse; per capita income rose from $80 to $1,000 during Park's 18 years in office.
