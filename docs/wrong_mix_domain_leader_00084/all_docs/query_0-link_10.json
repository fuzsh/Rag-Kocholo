        "text": "President Koivisto noted in his New Year's Speech that the past year was no cause for rejoicement regarding international relations development. Set-backs were experienced in arms limitation yet the necessity of arms negotiations was not disputed. President Koivisto considered the conclusion of the Madrid CSCE follow-up meeting as the most positive event. President Koivisto said that the most essential requirement in international relations is mutual trust. In the case of Finland, the prolonging the Fenno-Soviet FCMA Treaty was a good example of a trustful relationship.\n\nUnder-Secretary of State, Åke Wihtol, declared that in the next five-year trade agreement negotiations a mechanism should be created which will prevent the negative effects of price changes. The Soviet part also regards such a mechanism necessary. New forms of cooperation, such as production cooperation, and the clearing-compensation system have arisen in Finnish-Soviet trade. Mr Wihtol gave a speech on the occasion of publishing a book entitled \"Finnish-Soviet Economic Relations” edited in cooperation between the Finnish Institute of International Affairs (FIIA), and the Institute of World Economy and International Relations (IMEMO) in Moscow.\n\nForeign Minister Väyrynen noted in the Stockholm Disarmament Conference, that formal arrangements will put an end to speculations, caused by nuclear strategy and new arms technology, about the Nordic area.

This estimate was believed to lead to the Soviet Union to abstain from attacking NATO's northern side by land.\n\nThe Foreign Ministry granted a gift of over 25 million FIM for a tractor factory project in Tanzania. The Ministry appropriated 4.9 million FIM for a gold mine project.\n\nForeign Minister Paavo Väyrynen, answering Norway's Prime Minister Kàre Willoch's pessimism about the Swedish initiative regarding the formation of a Nordic nuclear-weapon-free zone (NWFZ), stated that the submarine issue between Sweden and the Soviet Union, and the recent strain in Norwegian- Soviet relations due to the espionage scandal, should not affect the Nuclear-free zone initiative.\n\nAccording to a report on development cooperation policy, submitted by the Cabinet to the Parliament, aid is given to countries who pursue to a strengthen their independence and improve their social and economic conditions.

According to Mr Vinogradov, the security of Northern Europe is strengthened by mutual cooperation, and not by military activity. President Koivisto attended the celebrations.\n\nThe Soviet Embassy in Finland found it odd that two American vessels simultaneously visited Finland on the anniversary of the FCMA Treaty. According to the Foreign Ministry, these two events had no connection to each other.\n\nPrime Minister Sorsa noted in an interview with Suomen Sosiaalidemokraatti that Finland's neutrality policy is acknowledged top be credible and pragmatic due to the current stable state of Finnish-Soviet relations. According to Sorsa, Finland stands for the principle that countries who refuse to deploy nuclear weapons in their territories, are justified to receive guarantees that nuclear weapons will not be used against them.\n\nForeign Minister Paavo Väyrynen, in a speech held at the Paasikivi Society in Tampere, stated that Finland, regarding to the international management of human rights, maintains a policy that the internationally agreed upon commitments and obligations should be adhered to.

Minister Laine expressed Finland's concern about the disunified and bilateral state of world trade. Minister Laine pointed to EFTA-Japanese relations, which require the creation of a joint \"Japan policy”. Prime Minister Sorsa saw it as vital that the EFTA-countries strengthen their cooperation in international organizations. According to Minister Sorsa, EFTA-cooperation does not threaten the independence of national commerce.\n\nThe Defence Forces decided to purchase T-72 tanks from the Soviet Union.\n\nIn an interview to The Swedish daily Svenska Dagbladet Foreign Minister Väyrynen said that the contrasting Swedish and Soviet explanations of the submarine incidents put Finland in a difficult position because the explanations are given by two governments with whom Finland has good relations.

Talyzin, in an interview to Keskisuomalainen, said that the Soviet Union is ready to support a Nordic NWFZ and to have discussions on declaring the Baltic Sea into a nuclear-free zone.

President Koivisto is concentrating more on Finland's relations with the Soviet Union and the Scandinavian countries while decreasing on other international activities because of the limited room of manoeuvre caused by the strained international situation. President Kekkonens foreign policy decisions cannot, however, always be interpreted with a view on domestic politics, e.g. his critical view of the Social Democratic Party in the late 1950s. Foreign policy was always of central importance for President Kekkonen. Jansson said that a conservative or centrist candidate will have no chance in the 1988 elections if President Koivisto will run for a second term.

In his speech Mr Romanov acknowledged those people and circles who started to pursue a new foreign policy in Finland after the war, and the vast support this policy receives among the Finns. President Koivisto noted that when evaluating present Finnish foreign policy, one should consider as background the circumstances and events of the autumn of 1944.\n\nThe Union of the Conscientious Objectors regarded the Defence Ministry plant to lengthen the alternative to military service to 16 months as an extra punishment.
