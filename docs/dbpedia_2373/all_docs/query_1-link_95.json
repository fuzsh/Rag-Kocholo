The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 11:05 a.m., at the John W. Beery, Sr. Wright Brothers Aviation Center, 1000 Carillon Boulevard, Dayton, OH, Hon. Wm. Lacy Clay (chairman of the subcommittee) presiding. Present: Representatives Clay and Turner. Staff present: Darryl Piggee, staff director/counsel; Alissa Bonner, professional staff member; Nidia Salazar, staff assistant; Michael Wiehe, legislative director for Representative Turner; and Chas Phillips, minority counsel. Mr. Clay. The subcommittee will come to order. And let me thank my ranking member, Congressman Mike Turner, for this invitation to come to Dayton. We certainly appreciate the opportunity to be here. We certainly appreciate the hospitality, and the--the historic significance of this community speaks volumes about this community, and how--and the confidence that they put in my colleague, Mr. Turner, to represent them in Washington. And I am so happy to have been invited, and to be able to conduct this hearing here. Welcome to the Information Policy, Census, and National Archives Subcommittee hearing. And this hearing will come at the topic of census data and issues in the development process. Hearing no objection, the chair and ranking member will each have 5 minutes to make opening statements. And all Members will have 3 days to submit statements for the record. And I'll begin with the opening statement, and welcome you again to the day's hearing on census data and its use in the development process. Because of Congressman Turner's work on community development, as Mayor of Dayton, a Member of Congress and chair of the subcommittee, Dayton is an ideal place to discuss today's topic. And I commend him for his work in this area. Today we will discuss, one, the impact of the accuracy of census data on community development; and, two, how census data is used in community development programs; and, three, how stakeholders in the community develop a process--processes to use census data in their decisionmaking. The Census Bureau conducts over 100 surveys every year, in addition to the decennial census. Data from the decennial census is used for the apportionment of congressional seats, managing Federal agencies, and allocating Federal funds. Over $300 billion is allocated based on data collected by the Census Bureau. Estimates published under the Population Estimates Program alone are used to distribute over $100 billion in Federal funding, and to determine eligibility for social programs that are based on population. Thus, undercounts can significantly reduce funding for States and localities. One study conducted for the U.S. Census Monitoring Board predicted that the undercount for the 2000 census would cost States $4.1 billion in Federal funding. A GAO study conducted in 2003 found that correcting population estimates for the 2000 census would redistribute about $380 million in Federal funding for Medicaid, Foster Care, Adoption Assistance, and the Social Services Block Grant. It is my hope, that the testimony received, and the discussions that follows will yield constructive suggestions for improving the accuracy of census data, to reduce funding discrepancies, and the usefulness of census data to stakeholders. We will hear from two expert panels here today, who will share their thoughts on how this great task can be accomplished in the most efficient and effective manner. And now, I will recognize my friend and colleague, the ranking member of the subcommittee, Mike Turner. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Hon. Wm. Lacy Clay follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Turner. Thank you, Chairman Clay. I want to thank you for being here, and taking the time out of your busy schedule, also away from your duties in Washington and your district, to come to my district, to see what we've been doing here. We have sort of a slogan in our office, which is, have you been to Dayton yet? And we try to bring everybody from Washington, DC, and I'm glad you have come. We've had the opportunity today, to see Hawthorne Hill and Carillon Park facility that we're in. And I appreciate your willingness to see these historic sights, and also to hear the testimony today. We went to South Park earlier, so we saw some of the homes that have been renovated, and really the great potential in that neighborhood. And for the people who are here, I want to tell you what a leader our chairman is in Congress, in the issue of urban areas, and issues. He also serves on the Financial Services Committee, where the important issues of predatory lending, and SSBG, and other Federal funding issues that assist in redevelopment of communities occurs. And also was instrumental in the efforts for Youthbuild, that translates right into issues of how do you use construction skills to renovate neighborhoods, and also provide opportunities for education and employment opportunities. And something I learned from you, about you today, that I was unaware, your father was one of the original founders of the Congressional Black Caucus. And the important significance that has played in giving a voice to urban areas, and also important issues from minority communities. We appreciate your work on the census, because you have been an advocate for making sure that minority populations are counted, but also that city's accurately counted. Some of our most difficult areas to count, in ensuring that they receive adequate representation, as you pointed out in your comments, it doesn't just go to voting representation, it also goes to their share in Federal funds, that can address some of the issues for their community. When we toured South Park today, one of the things we looked at was before and after pictures. And in one of the homes, they gave us a description of the history of the house. And I wanted to point out that when you read this history, and we're standing there in the building, it starts with one item at 1900. It says, the census lists the residence of 31 Bradford as John Campbell and Kathryn, and tells their history, and goes on to tell the census residence in 1910, 1920, and 1930. But how it was used as a historic tool to tell the story of, what are the histories of these properties, and how do they fit in the overall fabric of our community? I want to thank you so much for taking your time to be here, and the importance of how this type of revitalization project translates right to the issue of, how do we build our urban populations to attract people back to our cities? I also want to thank Brady Crest and Theresa Beachler, and the rest of the staff here at Carillon Park, for their hospitality and insistence on making this hearing successful. Carillon Park is a wonderful facility in our community. I'm glad the chairman was able to see Dayton's history through this facility. The hearing today will focus on population trends, and what cities can do to reverse the population migration from urban neighborhoods. Before I was mayor, I worked with several neighborhood leaders to create the private partnership Rehabarama with the Homebuilder's Association and Citywide Development. This partnership targeted Dayton's historic neighborhoods, and purchased the worst homes, renovated them, then held a home show to showcase the homes and neighborhoods to the region. Each of Dayton's eight historic neighborhoods was a recipient of the efforts of Rehabarama. Just last week was the end of the second Rehabarama in the historic South Park neighborhood. This show was unique, in that all of the investment was done by private citizens, rather than public subsidy. Mike DiFlora of the Home Group and Theresa Gasper of the Full Circle Development are to be commended for their vision and commitment to transforming the South Park neighborhood. The show is very successful, and the homes were carefully restored. The chairman and I had the opportunity to see the great work that was done earlier today. In each neighborhood, Rehabarama had an impact both on the surrounding property values, but also on the population trends in the area. The show brought families back into abandoned homes, and increased the desirability of living in Dayton's historic districts. I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today. And I again want to thank the chairman for his time and generosity in coming to Dayton. Mr. Clay. Thank you, Congressman Turner. The committee will now hear testimony from the panel of folks. First witness before us, we have two excellent panelists. One, Mr. Matthew Scire, Director of Strategic Issues for the Government Accountability Office and, two, and no stranger to this committee, welcome Mr. Scire. Mr. Scire. Thank you. Mr. Clay. And we also have joining us Steven Kelley, manager of the Office of Strategic Research for the Ohio Department of Development, and the Ohio Data Center, the State liaison to the U.S. Census Bureau. Thank you for coming today, Mr. Kelley. Mr. Kelley. My pleasure. Mr. Clay. And it is the committee policy, that all witnesses are sworn in. And please rise and raise your right hands, please. [Witnesses sworn.] Mr. Clay. The record will show that each witness answered in the affirmative. Your entire statement will be entered into the record. And the--you have a light in front of you, that indicates your time. But we won't be that strict about it, please. And the yellow light means that you have--that your time is running down, and you have 1 minute remaining. And then the red light means your time has expired, so we'll get started. And I guess we will begin with Mr. Kelly. It's your show. STATEMENTS OF STEVE KELLEY, DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF STRATEGIC RESEARCH, OHIO DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENT; AND MATTHEW SCIRE, DIRECTOR, STRATEGIC ISSUES, GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE STATEMENT OF STEVE KELLEY Mr. Kelley. Thank you, Chairman Clay, Ranking Member Turner, and the Subcommittee on Information Policy, Census, and National Archives. On behalf of Governor Ted Strickland and Lieutenant Governor Lee Fischer, I am pleased to share with you Ohio's State Data Center experience of working with the U.S. Bureau of the Census and its many data products. The data provided by the Bureau is a part of the warp and weave of policy and development here in the State. Every day, the numbers are referenced for a benchmark, or a trend line, and are the starting points for future planning. The first Joint Statistical Agreement between the Census Bureau and the State of Ohio was signed in 1979, forming the Census State Data Center network. This mutually supported network is comprised of 47 government, planning, academic and library agencies widely spread across the State. The State Data Center lead agency is housed at the Ohio Department of Development. The office is relatively unique, a combination of multiple census sharing programs, the State data center, population estimates, and population projection projects programs are all within a single State governmental agency. The Department has directly assisted the Bureau in promoting three decennial censuses, 1980, 1990 and 2000. The most obvious use of census data is the allocation of Federal dollars. For Ohio, an annual average of $7.6 billion in Federal funding is appropriated, based on census counts. This figure was derived from a 10-year review of the Consolidated Federal Funds Report. Changing demographics of the population also has an important impact on the cost and delivery of government services. The chart on the Daily Net Growth of the 65 and over population from 1995 to 2000 clearly demonstrated to the General Assembly of Ohio as it deliberated on the State Biennial Budget, the impact of an aging population. In 2007, Ohio is experiencing a growth of 36 people a day in the age 65 and over cohort. In 2011, when the first baby boomers, those born in 1946, reach 65, the daily growth jumps to 142 per day, and stays over 100 a day for the next 15 years. Clearly, population numbers have an impact. Private development finds that tying census numbers to a specific geography is the critical factor. The ability to cross tabulate place, with population, with income or education provides the decision criteria for many retailers and other business services. For major employers, the community pattern data helps determine the potential labor pool for a specific location. The TIGER geography program allows business to map the census data across a wide area without changing scale, or paying for the creation of a base analysis map. Moving ahead, looking at some of the population products from the Census Bureau. The Current Population Survey, while the least well known, is probably the most important tool for State and local development, as it is the source for many of our performance metrics. The unemployment rate and the size of the civilian labor force at the State, county, and central cities are the most basic of our metrics. Each month, these numbers provide the only thermometer of local economic conditions. And in addition, the annual release of educational attainment, income distribution, and poverty rates are carefully studied and compared for improvement from year to year. The newest and now most carefully watched information source, is the American Community Survey. The large city poverty statistics posted to over the last 3 years have drawn attention, as Ohio cities have been ranked as having the highest poverty rates in the country. The ranking process has been problematic, as many local statisticians look at the size of the sample, the margins of error, and the modified definitions of the new survey, to recognize that a range, rather than a rank would best represent the community. In Cleveland, the rank of first should have been reported as a first tier example. For the rest of the State, our rural and suburban places the limited sample size of the American Community Survey has made updated numbers unavailable. As a survey grows in years and size, we are hopeful that local communities and colleges can collaborate with the Census Bureau to increase the potential of the American Survey Community Survey. Together, in partnership with the Census Bureau, we should be able to deliver on its promise of more data in a timely fashion. Thank you for the opportunity to share with the subcommittee Ohio's experience with the census data. At this time, I'll be glad to answer your questions. [The prepared statement of Mr. Kelley follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Clay. Thank you so much, Mr. Kelley. And you--I can't believe that he did it under the 5-minute requirement. Thank you. Mr. Scire, I wonder if you could top this. Mr. Scire. I will try. Mr. Clay. Proceed. STATEMENT OF MATTHEW SCIRE Mr. Scire. Mr. Chairman, Mr. Turner, thank you for the opportunity to be here today, to discuss the important role that the nation's population count plays in Federal grant programs. As you know, the decennial census is a critical and national effort mandated by the Constitution. Census data are used to apportion seats in the congress, redraw congressional districts, and for numerous other public and private sector purposes. These data are also used directly or indirectly to allocate billions of dollars in Federal assistance, to State and local government. In fiscal year 2004, agencies obligated over $460 billion in grant programs, the largest of these was Medicaid, which accounted for nearly 40 percent of total grant obligations. To understand the accuracy and completeness of the census count, the Bureau estimates the population at the time of the decennial count, using an independent statistical survey. Because of the concern that inaccurate population counts might affect the allocation of grant funds, we have simulated the impact of substituting the post-censal population estimate for the census count. To illustrate the potential impact, we selected one grant program, the Social Services Block Grants program, because its formula relies exclusively on annual population estimates, to allocate funds among the States. We found that using the independent population estimate, rather than the census count, could shift funding among the States in the District of Columbia, principally because of variation among the States, in the extent to which the independent estimate for the State differed from its census count. To illustrate, looking at fiscal year 2004 for allocations for the Social Services Block Grant program alone, 27 States and the district of Columbia would have gained funding, and 22 States would have lost funding, using estimates based on this independent survey. The greatest difference occurred for Washington, DC, which would have received an additional 2.05 percent in funding. And Minnesota, which would have received 1.17 percent less. Grant programs generally rely on annual estimates of the State's population developed by the Census Bureau. To prepare these annual estimates, the Bureau begins with a prior decennial count, and then updates these using data on births, deaths, and other information. By the time the next decennial count is completed, there can be substantial differences between it, and an annual estimate built on the prior decennial census. In 2000, these differences called errors of closure, range from a low of 0.27 percent for West Virginia, to a high of over 10 percent for the District of Columbia. For every State, the population count was higher than the estimate that was based on a prior decennial, but the extent varied. The differences in error of closure among the States, result from shifts in State allocation of grant funds for the Social Services Block Grant Program, an estimated 8.6 million shifted from the 28 States that had below average percentage corrections, to the 22 States and the District of Columbia that had above average percentage corrections--I'm sorry, from below to above. One challenge that some grant programs may face, is the replacement of the decennial long form data, with the ongoing American Community Survey. Today, this survey provides annual information on communities with populations over 65,000. By 2010, the survey will provide 5 year average estimates for areas to the areas smallest block groups, census tracks, small towns, and rural areas. The survey also provides information on immigration that will be used for annual, State, and county estimates of population. In summary, Mr. Chairman, the decennial census is an important factor of the allocation of grant funds. Either directly or indirectly, it is a component of many grant formulas. Should the count be inaccurate, it could affect the allocation of grant funds. Likewise, differences between annual estimates of population and the decennial count can build over the decade and cause a once-a-decade corrections to population estimates, and consequently, the allocations among the States. Because it is essential that the decennial count be accurate for 2010, the Bureau, once again, plans to conduct an independent statistical estimate of the population. Plans to focus on the components of any net, or over or under count, and how these may vary across population groups and locations. We're currently reviewing as plans--as in the past, we look forward to supporting the subcommittees over site efforts, to a timely and complete, and accurate cost affective census. This concludes my opening remarks. Thank you again for the opportunity to speak today. I'd be glad to take any questions you may have. [The prepared statement of Mr. Scire follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Clay. Thank you so much, Mr. Scire. And thank you both for your testimony, in being here today. I will recognize the ranking member, Mr. Turner, for questions. Mr. Turner. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Again, thank you both for being here, and for your testimony, and for highlighting the important issues of what the census data, demographics, what the information that we can glean from it, what things we need to do to improve our processes. Mr. Kelley, my first question goes to you, in that you have highlighted in your presentation, the differences in Ohio counties, of some being population losers, some being population gainers. In my district, looking on your map, you can see that for urban areas, the Dayton area appears to be about third in population loss, with Cleveland and perhaps Youngstown being higher. Toledo, Columbus, and Cincinnati having lost less population. So Ohio's--Dayton's losing more population than the others. In Warren County, which is in my district, being No. 2 for population gain. So you have this contrast of an urban core anchored county, and a county that is growing faster than actually--you have identified as not only greater than Ohio, but also greater than the national average--is its growth rate. In looking at the demographics from the census, beyond just population rises and increase, what are some of the things that we should look to in the demographic data, that would tell us what we should focus on, looking perhaps to policy of the development of the two different counties. Mr. Kelley. Congressman Clay, Ranking Member Turner, it's a big question. What the census is actually, a kind of a lagging indicator, in that it's reporting on the movement of people. And so we have to figure out what's going on with the population, and what are the trends. Over the last 20 years, we've seen a dramatic drop in interest rates. We've seen a housing boom that has been unrivaled in our history, except for the--probably the first baby boom. And so we've had low income, where we've had new household formation. We've had low interest rates, so that the movement of households to the American dream of owning your own home, and your own piece of property have been reinforced in a positive sort of way. And I think we'll see some trends change as the economics of the national economy, and then the local economy changes as well. So again, it's reflecting the market conditions out there. And we'll see some changes in the market conditions. And I think we'll see some changes between the two. Mr. Turner. In looking at demographics, one of the things that you highlighted in your testimony relates to the poverty statistics. You questioned whether or not the poverty information accurately reflected the circumstances of communities, and how it is reported. Could you speak a little more about that? And Mr. Scire, if you could respond to that. Mr. Kelley. First--Chairman Clay, Ranking Member Turner, first off was the sample size. What the statistics were revealing were a single year of statistics. And oftentimes, we were out in the field, we're looking at the numbers and wondering if it was a large enough sample. Second off, we saw the variation in the poverty rate. It was very volatile. And so that suggested that maybe 1 year, the sampling had leaned to the high end. And maybe the next year, that survey had leaned--so as more and more years become available, and they start mixing, I think we should see some stability on that, and that should help improve. We saw the definition of poverty change from the 2000 census, because of this change. And one of them is the issue of timing. The question is, in the last 12 months versus the last year. And so we see a constant change of that timing, and we're not quite sure exactly what that means, and what people are including. So we're finding it difficult to get a stable definition that can be checked over time. Those are some of the things that we're seeing with the national census, and so with the American Community Survey. And we hope that again, over time, some of that variability gets leveled out, and we can see maybe what those trends are doing. Mr. Turner. Mr. Scire, could you comment on that? Mr. Scire. We haven't looked at the American Community Survey, and how it's being implemented since it was originally put out there. But on the poverty statistic alone, one thing I would point out, that it's important, in terms of formulas and so forth, that it not--that it be--that it recognize the differences that there are in cost of living across--from one community to the next. That a flat rate for poverty, or flat number for poverty doesn't necessarily indicate what the need really is in a particular community. Mr. Turner. Excellent point. Mr. Kelley. Building on that, I guess I'll reinforce that on housing. If you take a look at the average price of housing in a Cleveland, or Cincinnati, or a Dayton versus a New York, or a Boston, or San Francisco, it becomes very obvious that there's a major difference in that definition. Mr. Turner. Excellent. Thank you, sir. Mr. Clay. Thank you, Mr. Turner. In your testimony, Mr. Kelley, you state that the ranking process of the American Community Survey became problematic, as many local statisticians began looking at the sample size margin of error, and the modified definition of survey, to recognize that a range rather than a rank would be best representing the community. Can you tell us a little more about the affective problems might have, on the quality of the data collected? Mr. Kelley. Chairman Clay, Representative Turner, the issue gets to be, when you take a look at the margin of error, that we found that a 24 percent rate of poverty, or a 30 percent rate of poverty, when we added in the margins of error, plus or minus 2 percent, or again, depending on the sample size, we found that the city ranked first and the city that ranked 20th, were actually statistically within range of each other. So we really couldn't say definitively, that Cleveland was a higher poverty rate than say Antonio. And so the issue of a rank gives a sense of exactness, that the margins of error, when you look at them say, that's not really the case. They all may be actually the same. And so it gets to be a little bit difficult. Being 1st or 20th is a big difference in the mind of a mayor of a community leader, and is--particularly in the media. Mr. Clay. No. It certainly is, because it would attach a stigma---- Mr. Kelley. Yes. Mr. Clay [continuing]. Or a label on a certain community. The Non-employers Statistics Program provides information on businesses without paid employees at a subject of Federal income tax. According to the Census Bureau, most non-employers are self-employed individuals, operating small unincorporated businesses. In your work, have you found this information to be helpful to policymakers, in setting policy that affects small business? Mr. Kelley. Chairman Clay, Representative Turner, the--what we find, is that this is a new data set that we are just starting to examine and see the strength and limitations of it. We actually published a first--our first report on that data set this year. And we're still waiting to hear from the field, from businesses and from government leaders, how that impacts their understanding. We are amazed at the size and breath of the information that's there. And as far as the definition of small business, we're trying to incorporate that into our understanding. So it's still kind of new for us, to see what's happening. Mr. Clay. Should different--should additional categories of businesses be added to the survey, or would that help? Mr. Kelley. The jury's still out on that. Again, we're just trying to get people interested and aware of its existence. And we have not gotten a lot of feedback yet. Mr. Clay. Thank you. Thank you for that response. Mr. Scire, one of the purposes of this hearing is to find out how census data is used in Federal funding formulas. We know that they are used in the CDBG, Community Development Block Grant program, and Social Service Block Grant program, as you have discussed. Can you tell us how extensive, is the use of census data, in formulating for Federal programs? Mr. Scire. I think the way I would put it is, that the population counts ripple throughout the entire statistical system. The counts that are done every 10 years, are used as a basis for developing annual estimates of population. Many of these grant programs are using those measures directly. And then also the population count and the housing count are used to establish sampling frames, for example, for other surveys. So it's a foundation for the statistical system. And so there are many, many grant programs that rely on data, that may not directly use that population count, but for it the surveys, that they do rely on would be--would be done completely differently. So I think I would put it that way, that it really runs throughout these programs. Mr. Clay. In the GAO study, population estimates were submitted for census counts. And it was found that recalculating allocation from Social Services Program Block Grant funds would shift $4.2 million. Now, 27 States and the District of Columbia gained funding, and 23 States lost funding. What were the results of some of the other areas GAO examined in the study, and did the Census Bureau or the department comment on the study? Mr. Scire. We looked at two programs in that analysis. One was the Social Services Block Grant program, which you mentioned. The other was Medicaid. Of course Medicaid is huge, compared with the Social Services Block Grant Program. And so as you mentioned, there was $4.2 million, and those Social Services Block Grant funds would have shifted, if you substituted the estimates for the population count. For Medicaid, the number was more--was over $300 million. So just because of the sheer size of that program, there was much more of an impact, in terms of dollars. In terms of a percentage impact, it was more or less the same, that it was about a quarter of a percent of funding shifted among the States for both, the SSBG and the Medicaid program. Actually, Medicaid was a little bit less on the percentage basis. And there was an equivalent number of winners and losers, in terms of numbers of States. Let's see, I forgot the second part of your question. Mr. Clay. What is the effect of these adjustments, and how do the adjustments compare to the actual census? Mr. Scire. Well, again, this was--I would say that a quarter of a percent is the easiest way to look at it. Mr. Clay. OK. What agencies used the data the most? What Federal agencies rely on census data? Mr. Scire. I would not be surprised to learn that every Federal agency relies on census data in some way or another. If it's not for allocation of funds, then it's for understanding performance of programs, for example. But some of the bigger users, in terms of grant formulas would be HHS, the HUD, Department of Labor. But again, I think that the data are used in a lot of different ways. Mr. Clay. Thank you. Thank you for that response. Mr. Turner. Mr. Turner. Mr. Scire, I want to followup on the chairman's questions concerning the estimates. In your written testimony, page 7 has a chart that is--has the heading of ``Estimated Social Services Block Grant Percentage Change In Grant Funding Using Statistical Population Estimates for States.'' The chairman was asking you questions about that. In looking at the winners and losers, I note that not only is Ohio a loser in that, but that pretty much all of our neighbors, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Kentucky are all down in the bottom category. Could you just tell us a little bit more about this chart and that application? Mr. Scire. Certainly. I think that what you might be observing here, is that in these States--in the bottom of the chart, are ones that generally were considered to have had an over count. I also--before I even go any further, I want to emphasize that these are based on estimates coming out of this independent statistical survey called ACE. And I'm not sure that the Bureau even considers those estimates reliable. But having said that, if you were to substitute an estimate for the count, you would say that the estimate was lower for a lot of these States near the bottom. And so that basically, the population count was greater than, yes, but that's called an over count. It could be that these are States that throughout the decade, have had a loss of--did not have as much immigration population, perhaps, which might explain differentials that you see, between the under count and over count. So--and for--for the State of Ohio, this had no--0.79 percent differential represented a $528,000, for example. In Minnesota, it was $344,000. For the District of Columbia, which had--which was considered to have had an under count, if you applied that estimate rather than the count, it would have made a difference of $67,000 in the SSBG program. There could be differences--when you look at Medicaid, the graphic might be a little bit different, inasmuch as States with higher incomes would be--have less of an effect, in a way, meaning the change. You're still going to get the--they would get the same repayment. The percentages it's based on, there's a floor. And it's 50 percent, basically, for the matching rate under Medicaid. And so you might see less of an impact in some States, than you do here, because Social Services Block Grant relies solely on population. Mr. Turner. One of the limitations I think we have in the census, is that we're counting people. And they're--of course that's a constitutional mandate, that we count people. But we layer on top of it, beyond the constitutional mandate, issues of demographics, which tend to be the conditions of people, their education level, their employment level. But it doesn't give us that much of a picture of communities. We can sort of extrapolate, and try to do comparison between communities, and communities based on similar demographic data. But I'm going to ask you to respond for just a moment, on limitations of the census, in that respect. And I'm going to do it in light of, Mr. Kelley, as you were saying, if you look at Montgomery County, we're a number of three of urban cores in the State losing population. Warren County, is still in my district, No. 2, gaining population. You don't look at--through the census data information, what's left behind or what a community struggles with, as populations decline with the abandoned houses, blighting influences that result from that. So if you could just speak--I'm going to ask you for just a moment, to speak about the limitations that you see in census demographic data, in really telling us the true demographics of the community. Mr. Kelley. Chairman Clay, Congressman Turner, the issue is actually one of timing. The decennial census is every 10 years. And a part of that long form, as a component of the housing stock, and the household. And we get a wealth of information from that information. With the adding on the American Community Survey, and replacing the long form with this annual update, particularly in our urban areas, there is a potential of getting a more timely update, particularly when we're talking about vacancy rate of buildings, age of the buildings, condition of the buildings. So that may get to some of that question, of what is the current condition of our urban core. So the American Community Survey has some potential, to give us a timely update. Rather than once every 10 years, we might be able to see how things are moving in an every two to 3-year pattern, on what's happening. Mr. Turner. Excellent point. Mr. Scire. Mr. Scire. Well, I think we've reported in the past, the limitations of certain data. I would look at the--in terms of housing quality, for example, there are measures of, you know, whether or not there's complete plumbing, whether there's complete electric, and so forth. That would be over the years, those kind of metrics are less meaningful, because generally there's--there isn't the same issue, in terms of lack of those features. So the measures of housing quality may not really get at what you're trying to measure. In terms of poverty, I was talking before about the importance of adjusting that to recognize the various costs of living, from one locality to another. So a flat dollar amount threshold for poverty, wouldn't get that. And so there could be a better measurement, for example, of what metric for the cost of living, in a way. We're doing some analysis right now. We're looking at fair market rents, as one possibility of recognizing in a way, and adjusting poverty for the cost of living and locality. Mr. Turner. Thank you. Mr. Clay. Mr. Clay. Thank you. Mr. Kelley, for many large cities, there is a concern that the estimate methodology is biased to areas of rapid building, in other words, new construction, rather than to areas where there is rehab. What alternative procedures could you recommend to--for the Bureau to explore, as far as being able to, I guess, give equal attention to both areas? Mr. Kelley. Chairman Clay, Congressman Turner, the most-- probably the best example of that right now here in Ohio is that the city of Cincinnati has contracted the social contract of Washington, DC, to do an alternative population estimate process. And they included a large number of activities, but I'll focus in on what we've worked with, with the estimates division, again, building permits. We know that is the basic block that they use to manipulate the numbers. I would say that we'll need to ask them to reconsider or add additions for established communities for remodeling. At this point, all they're asking for is new builds. Remodeling has been eliminated. The second part of it is that the most--probably need to take a look at the IRS migration files, that they use to identify movement. Here in Ohio, we have a situation where there's a marriage penalty, often times for households. And it's beneficial to file separately, and that means filing separately at the Federal level. So we have a large number of possible--an over statement of households that are leaving or moving because of Ohio taxes. So we have an administrative issue, rather than an actual household activity, and that may be something that we need to go back and take a look at, as well. Mr. Clay. I see. And do you think if--if they would approach, I guess, the building permit issue, and I guess you also need a building permit to do rehab, is that in most cities? Mr. Kelley. My understanding, is that would be a requirement for most cities. Our township says that's not necessarily the case. In our cities, I would say that would be an absolute requirement, in most cases. Mr. Clay. Or work permits, or whatever? Mr. Kelley. Right. Mr. Clay. That's a great point. I thank you for that, Mr. Turner. Any more questions? Mr. Turner. No. No more questions. Mr. Clay. I have no more questions. This panel is excused, and thank you very much for your testimony today. You will also, without objection, submit the Census Bureau's testimony for today's hearing. And we'll take a brief break to set up for the second panel. Thank you both, gentlemen. Mr. Scire. Thank you. [Recess.] Mr. Clay. The committee will come to order. And it is the policy of the subcommittee, to swear in all witnesses. Would you please rise, and raise your right hands. [Witnesses sworn.] Mr. Clay. Thank you very much. You may be seated. The record will show that each witness answered in the affirmative. The entire statement will be entered into the record. At this point, I will differ to my ranking member, Mr. Turner, for introductions. Mr. Turner. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It's my honor, to introduce to you, which is a diverse panel of grassroots community leaders, institutional partners, and community leadership. We're going to start with Dan Barton to our left, who is the president of the Grafton Hill Neighborhood Association. Grafton Hill is a neighborhood--all of these neighborhoods are right outside of downtown, but has many institutional partners including the home of our Art Institute. David Bohardt is currently the vice president with Saint Mary's Neighborhood Development Corp., which is a faith based CDC. He was, prior to that, the head of our local Homeowner's Association, and was a partner in our Rehabaramas, and the most important aspect for many of our neighborhoods, adding Citirama, which was a new construction component, convincing new home builders to come into the city of Dayton. Next, we have Theresa Brandt, who is the president of the Dayton View historic neighborhood. Dayton View is a very large neighborhood, that was a site of a very successful Rehabarama. And she has been very helpful in working with other neighborhoods, in addition to our own. We have Theresa Gasper, president of the Full Circle Development, who's the private equity partner for the South Park Rehabarama, which you visited today. In taking a lead in seeing how the private sector can come in, and play a role that government has previously played. Karin Manovich, the president of historic South Park, who is--has an incredible team that she leads in advancing South Park, which I believe has the largest number of structures, in all of our historic districts. So she has the largest area that she is coordinating. And then we have Idotha Bootsie Neal, who is the president of Wright Dunbar, Inc., which is a private partnership that is focused on the redevelopment of the Wright Dunbar neighborhood in the commercial sector. In addition to partnering on the residential side, Bootsie Neal served with me in the city council, and was a leader in both neighborhood development, but also in Rehabarama, and Citirama, and in really turning the Wright Dunbar area around, both with the rehab and new construction. The Wright Dunbar neighborhood today is one of the highest priced neighborhoods for a new housing construction. When Commissioner Neal was active, they had at first, had been a proposal to demolish the housing that was in the Wright Dunbar area and construct apartments. She fought to ensure that area be rehabilitated, and have an historic flavor, which it does today. Mr. Clay. Thank you. And welcome to all of you. I appreciate you being here today. And we will now--we will try to observe the 5-minute rule for presentation. And we'll start on this end and move on down. Mr. Barton, you may begin. STATEMENTS OF DAN BARTON, PRESIDENT, GRAFTON HILL NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATION; DAVID BOHARDT, VICE PRESIDENT, ST. MARY DEVELOPMENT CORP.; TERESA BRANDT, PRESIDENT, DAYTON VIEW HISTORIC NEIGHBORHOOD; THERESA GASPER, PRESIDENT, FULL CIRCLE DEVELOPMENT, LLC; KARIN MANOVICH, HISTORIC SOUTH PARK, INC.; AND IDOTHA BOOTSIE NEAL, PRESIDENT, WRIGHT DUNBAR, INC. STATEMENT OF DAN BARTON Mr. Barton. Thank you very much, Chairman Clay and Representative Turner, to come before this subcommittee today, to discuss the importance of a census information in neighborhood revitalization. And I'll speak to our--my particular perspective, which is a project called the Renaissance Alliance, incorporating institutions within our area. Our project was conceived based on the information that we were receiving from the census data base on total numbers and demographic information. What we were able to establish, as an ongoing trend, was the aging and the churn that was occurring within our neighborhoods. Our neighborhood was built between the 1870's and 1920's, with occasional high density construction occurring at the time of the peak of Dayton's population in the late 1960's and early 1970's. The neighborhoods originally represented a cross- section of the typical populations that were present throughout the county at that time. From looking at census data from the 1950's on, we could track ongoing changes that eventually became an exodus of certain segments of the population. And this exodus continued for many reasons that were national, as well as local. But this population shifted away from the established urban core that we observed within the statistics, have a very significant and negative impact within our neighborhoods. The population shift left buildings within our neighborhoods without a viable market. Lacking competitive amenities with new suburban construction, the buildings fell into lower and lower occupancy, which consequently made it more and more difficult for the owners to maintain those structures, and to maintain a high enough level of occupancy, that they would remain profitable--profitable enough to maintain the buildings, etc. And update the buildings with the amenities that would attract the same kind of populations that they were originally built to hold, and give a residence to. This basic problem of the infrastructure aging and not being maintained, began to spread throughout the five area neighborhoods, impacting first the larger apartments, but then also impacting the single-family homes, which were at the core of the five neighborhoods. And census data throughout the 1970's and 1980's indicated that this trend was continuing and accelerating. And we could see from our own subjective evaluations, that this was occurring. We're not only losing people, but there was within the neighborhoods a lot of churn. Because it's individual buildings were falling into disrepair, that population might move to another building. But within any 10-year span, there would be a substantial shifting within the neighborhood of populations. And some of the instability that comes from the reporting certainly impacted our neighborhoods very heavily. In terms of what it meant for the overall values of the houses, between 1955 and 1980, there was almost a 75 percent collapse in real value, adjusted for inflation, of the values of the properties. This impacted not only the apartments and the homes where, you know, for a single occupied family, a real loss of dollars is a very negative impact on your net worth. So that this collapsing value was actually discouraging people from moving into the neighborhoods, encouraging--discouraging apartment owners from making the reinvestments, and certainly driving away the other development that would occur within a retail and residential neighborhood context, that makes a neighborhood viable and strong. As these neighborhoods have declined, our institutions have assisted us and stepped in to a void Grandview Hospital, the Dayton Art Institute, and the Saint Mary's Development Corp. have stepped in to try to address this. From the standpoint of Grandview Hospital, which was an institution landlocked as it grew, it was facing some substantial obstacles for growth and continuation. And of course, the neighborhoods themselves realized that the upkeep of 100-year-old historic houses is a challenge, and a challenge that is more and more difficult for an aging population that has less economic resources. What we determined to do in the face of that, and at the time when Representative Turner was mayor, we decided to take all of the institutions and the stakeholders, and form a strategic plan around that, which is now what we call the Renaissance Alliance. And we have been working toward harmonizing our goals and our actions, so that each of them--of our respective resources, and our resources are very varied, can work toward a common goal. The goals that we have identified and are working toward, as to make significant street scape changes to permit expansion of the hospital campus, improve the removal of blight, and facilitate the strengthening of new populations moving back within our neighborhoods. We've had a lot of improvements in place, and those are reported in my notes to the subcommittee. And I did want to basically identify that, at this point, with all of the things that are underway and improvements, that we have made a $108 million and $466,000 of improvements, either planned or committed with funding in place for must of those. And the city has, in parallel, worked $47 million improvement into this. And we hope that the census data coming forward from this point, will reinforce quantitative and qualitative data that will allow us to improve the retail component of large businesses looking at our neighborhoods, and our populations within the neighborhoods, in a favorable light, in making any decisions to invest in that. [The prepared statement of Mr. Barton follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Clay. Thank you. Mr. Barton. Thank you very much. Mr. Clay. Thank you very much for that testimony. Mr. Bohardt. STATEMENT OF DAVID BOHARDT Mr. Bohardt. Mr. Chairman, Congressman Turner, thank you for this opportunity to be here. My colleague, Dan, ran over a little bit, but I in advance agreed to yield to him some of my time. Mr. Clay. Great. Mr. Bohardt. So I'm hoping to take 3 or 4 minutes here. Mr. Clay. You will be fine. Mr. Bohardt. During the years 1993 to 2006, I had the privilege of serving as executive director of the Homebuilder's Association of Dayton. During that time, thanks primarily to the leadership of then mayor, now Congressman Mike Turner, the association partnered with the city of Dayton to sponsor 10 Rehabarama and Citirama events. These events directly and indirectly have generated more than $50 million in private sector investment. And through stabilization of the city's close-in historic districts, permitted the 100 million plus economic resurgence of the city's downtown in the late 1990's to the current day. In every instance, the availability, reliability, use, and analysis of U.S. census data was incredibly important. In the case of Rehabarama and Citirama events, these data allowed us to understand the current social, economic, cultural and other demographic characters of neighborhoods targeted for reinvestment, permitting us further to understand how much investment was required by the public sector, before the private sector could be expected to do most of the heavy lifting, with respect to project development and finance. And the data also enabled us to project long-term impacts on local governments' tax revenue streams. I know you had the opportunity this morning to visit the homes of Rehabarama in South Park, and they're a very good case in point. As Congressman Turner mentioned, when the first Rehabarama was conducted in South Park in 2001, approximately $2 million of city subsidy was provided. In the homes you toured, and in 30 others completely rehabilitated or underway, 100 percent of the costs, and probably close to $3 million will be shouldered entirely by the private sector. Taken together, the two Rehabarama events in South Park, and the additional investments they have encouraged, have added more than $5 million of appraised values to Montgomery County's property tax rolls, and approximately $3 million of additional annual household revenue, to the city's income tax rolls. In South Park and other neighborhoods served by Rehabarama and Citirama, the availability and accuracy of census data is the very first, an absolutely essential tool of community redevelopment. At St. Mary's Development, I'm executive vice president since 1989, we've brought forward approximately 30 projects, serving low income seniors and working families, total economic impact of plus or minus $200 million. For each of our projects, our financing is primarily low-income housing tax credits under Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Service Code. Again, the availability and accuracy of census data are critically important to these projects and literally drive the feasibility and location of low income tax credit projects. They enable us to identify, census tract by census tract, those low-income communities with the highest level of need for the housing for low-income seniors and working families. The designation of qualified census tracts under Section 42d of the IRS Code brings into a sharper relief those communities with the highest needs. Since proposed low-income housing tax credit projects seldom go forward unless they are located within the boundaries of qualified census tracts, the accuracy and reliability of the data that underlie them is absolutely essential. Mr. Chairman, Congressman Turner, I thank you for this opportunity to provide this testimony. [The prepared statement of Mr. Bohardt follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Clay. Thank you so much. Ms. Brandt, you may proceed. STATEMENT OF TERESA BRANDT Ms. Brandt. Good morning, Mr. Chairman, Congressman Turner. I'm honored to be here today, and represent Dayton View Historic District. It was one of the neighborhoods that was lucky enough to have two Rehabarama's over the period of 1999 and 2001. I've also brought in some pictures here this morning, so that you can have a visual. I know you got to actually experience South Park this morning. And I thought to have a little bit of equal time, I brought in some pictures of the various houses that are in my neighborhood. In an effort to paint you a picture of my neighborhood, and the redevelopment effort, I believe it's prudent to give a short background in the historical perspective of the area. Dayton Historic first established its historic district in 1977 by the city commissioner here in Dayton, and then subsequently put on the historic register in 1984. In 1832, our first house was built, and it was an old farmhouse. And at the time, this area was located northwest of downtown, across the river to the city. And Dayton--and it is, as a matter of fact, but it was difficult to get to Dayton View from downtown, until the bridge came into play, and until ferries actually were transporting people back and forth across. So in many ways, my neighborhood was one of the first, ``what you would see as a suburb today,'' in the Dayton area. And as such, kind of like a suburb, the character of the homes were very, very different from the character of the homes in some of the other areas. Very frequently, we had very large homes. And today, we still have three of our mansions that are still in existence, although they have fallen to a bit of disarray. During the 1930's and the rising popularity of the area with its closeness to the city of Dayton, the homes began to be dissected and subdivided. And they fell into disrepair even more and more, as time went by, and as the populations shifted for the industrial revolution. And through the war efforts, people were trying to go downtown to work in the factories, and various other places in the area. The homes became more and more dissected. Sometimes houses that were--for example, one of my mansions is 8,000 square feet, it had 32 apartments in it once upon a time. Those are teeny tiny--I mean, basically one bedroom apartments. And it wasn't until the district became historic, that it actually started to turn backward. And more and more, people are moving back into the area. With the Rehabaramas, and the first Rehabarama, they did 10 houses in the neighborhood. And the city takes the most blighted properties, the biggest eyesores, and starts renovation. And in a couple of the cases, they had to demo a house that was sitting on a lot, because it was just economically unfeasible to redevelop it. And so you see, several of the houses that were rebuilt not quite exactly the same as they were originally, but they are much, much nicer. And the single-family homes that have been built in place, have stayed pretty stable. People that have moved into them, haven't really moved back out of the area. In 2001, they took an experiment, and decided to do some condominiums in one of our old apartment buildings. Hopefully, taking something that Mr. Barton was talking about, and reusing it in a better way. That has been marginally successful, from the perspective that it took much longer in my neighborhood for the condos to take root. Some of those, for example, didn't sell for the first time. They were redone in 2001, and it was up to 2005 before the first--before the final one actually sold. In my neighborhood, a part of it is because of the demographics of Dayton View. We are in a bigger planning area in the city of Dayton, which is 15 percent white, 85 percent minority. In Dayton View Historic itself, we don't really keep track of the exact demographics for it. But we kind of did a quick eyeball discussion, and we figured out that there were probably 30 percent white, 70 percent minority in the district. That has some impact, too, because it also impacts the economic viability of some of this area. And I put in my written testimony, all of the docs and all of the data regarding sales and redevelopment efforts. But one of the things I did want to say in final, is that it's very important, as the census data changes and new demographics develop, that more concentration be put on the urban areas, because they are the most depressed. And they're sometimes the hardest ones to bring back. It's very easy to build a house out in the middle of the cornfield, but it's very, very difficult to redevelop and make an area reemerge, once it's gone so far downhill. [The prepared statement of Ms. Brandt follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Clay. Thank you so much for that observation. Ms. Gasper, please proceed. STATEMENT OF THERESA GASPER Ms. Gasper. Thank you for the opportunity to present today. I hope you enjoyed the tour. As you can see, we're a little proud of our heritage of the Wright Brothers. Mr. Clay. Yes, I do. Ms. Gasper. As mentioned I am one of the two investors behind this year's Rehabarama in South Park, which just finished up last Sunday, a week ago yesterday. The other investor is Michael DiFlora from the Home Group. I didn't realize, until after I submitted my written testimony, that he wasn't going to be here today. Being the engineer, he would have provided a lot more statistical data. In his absence, I'll try and focus more on the numbers, and less on the stories of our experience, also known as our adventure. I confess, we did not rely heavily on census data, and that is primarily because the reason we chose South Park, in addition to Karin getting a hold of me and not letting go, is that's the neighborhood I grew up, and I'm the fourth generation, on my father's side, to live there. We moved out in 1972. And since I've left, I always wanted to come back and revitalize it. This is the first time Rehabarama has been done with the private investment. The city did provide $100,000 to the Homebuilders Association of Dayton, who market managed the show. To date, Full Circle Development and the Home Group has invested between $2 and $3 million of private capital into South Park. We made a deliberate decision to not use public funding, because of the shrinking pool of resources. Michael and I selected South Park, primarily due to the neighborhood's leadership, passion, tenacity and proactive problem solving. We decided our critical number would be reducing the number of vacant properties. When we started 18 months ago, there were more than 80 vacant houses. Today, we have a total of 30 homes, and one vacant lot. We did have a second lot, but we sold that recently to an architect who moved into the neighborhood. Our process has been to visually identify the distressed homes. Again, we go after the worst and the blighted. We rely heavily on tax records, county tax records, to find out who owns the houses, if they're delinquent on their taxes. And if it is an absentee owner, how many properties that they may own. The neighborhood leadership worked with us very closely, in letting us know the property was behind in its tax bill because of a medical hardship, or a personal hardship, or if they were a nuisance to the neighborhood. And very often, they helped us track down the owners, and their contact information in some interesting fashion. Our primary contact is a vacant home, with an absent-type owner, who's behind on their taxes. Predator lending has had a real impact on that neighborhood. Occasionally, we have been able to buy out absentee landlords. A couple of weeks ago, Business Week did an article on foreclosure prices. One of the numbers they talked about, was that a foreclosed home reduces the property values of every home within 200 feet by 1 percent. Locally, I've heard numbers anywhere from $1,500 to $5,000 per house. We believe that by targeting vacant properties, we can make them tax productive again, and increase the values of the adjacent properties simultaneously. Vacant properties often attract theft, vandalism, and can become a hideout for drug dealers or vagrants. Decreasing the number of vacant properties, raises the property values, which leads to a great pool of resources for the city and county, as well as reduces the need, then, for services such as housing inspection, police, and fire. Our goal is to make these homes as maintenance free as you can for a 125-year-old house. We focus on structural, mechanical issues, such as roof, plumbing, water heater, wiring, windows, doors, porches, sidewalks heating, air conditioning, kitchens, and baths. There's not a lot left after that. Again, making it very expensive to rehab these homes. But our goal is to make these homes owner occupied dwellings, and to make them too nice and too expensive to become renter properties. There is a rule of thumb, at least here in Dayton, that in order for a neighborhood to remain stable, it needs to have a minimum of 60 percent of the structures as owner occupied. According to the last census data, the South Park planned development area, not just the historic district, is 32 percent owner occupied. You see, we have a lot of work cut out for us. Some of our challenges have been property acquisition. Very often, a house is tied up in probate, or in an estate. And if there are any surviving family members, they're not sure who had the legal right to sell it. Other times, the impacts of predatory lending, the mortgage value is much higher than the market value, and it's impossible for an owner to sell. And now we're seeing, because of the show, people are opportunists, and are trying to increase their property asking prices. We've had a very cooperative, but unfortunately ineffective housing department and housing court. Current ordinances do not have enough teeth, and absentee owners have learned how to work the system. They do realize, that often times, the client is cheaper than the repairs, and the work goes unfinished. What surprised me, was lower income neighbors who believe the rich people were trying to make it for them to live in South Park. Their displeasure is often shown by theft, vandalism, or sometimes just hurling insults in general. So while this has been a private investment, I believe the ideal situation is a combination of public and private resources, and not so much capital from the city, but resources as far as street maintenance, police, and fire. Lessons learned, you can't do this without strong neighborhood leadership and support. And while noble on our part, this venture needs to be profitable, in order to attract other quality investors, to join our cause. Again, thank you for the opportunity, and I'll be happy to answer any questions. [The prepared statement of Ms. Gasper follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Clay. Thank you so much for that testimony. Ms. Manovich. STATEMENT OF KARIN MANOVICH Ms. Manovich. Thank you. I really appreciate the opportunity to be here, Chairman Clay, Congressman Turner. I'm speaking today, specifically on the impact on population of South Park Rehabarama. South Park, as mentioned earlier, was fortunate enough to have two Rehabaram shows, one in 2001, where five dwellings were completely renovated, and three new construction projects were showcased. And in October 2007, which you toured this morning. The impact on Rehabarama on South Park has been significant and multi-faceted. The first Rehabarama show, the eight houses were done--all five of the houses sold either before or during the show. And three houses sold within 2 months of the show. The most distressed properties were targeted with the census data used. We had 14 percent of our housing stock was vacant in 2000 census, with 54 percent rental property and 32 percent owner occupied. The goal of Rehabarama was to reverse that trend to increase owner occupancy, decrease vacants, and reduce the number of rental properties, with South Park being the largest historic district of Dayton, with nearly 800 homes to tackle. Prior to 2001, the neighborhood had been struggling on its own without no outside help to take on these properties house by house. When Rehabarama occurred in 1993 in another historic district, South Park and many other neighborhoods lined up, as we saw the impact on that neighborhood was stunning. And when we finally had our turn in 2001, the asking price of the homes was approximately 30 percent above the current market values in the neighborhood. Most of the homes were modest in size, with the smallest being just under 800 square feet. Once the show was over, the high publicity and high attendance of the first show where several hundred people came and toured the homes, were professionally decorated by the Dayton society of interior decorators, that had an impact on the neighborhood that I didn't expect. It lasted for probably 2\\1/2\\ years, where new residences were attracted into the area to purchase the other homes, not just the homes that had been restored. But also, other residences of the neighborhood felt competent in reinvesting, by doing additional homes. The property values in the neighborhood almost immediately went up about 30 percent. As a part of that Rehabarama, there was a matching grant for exterior home improvements to homeowner occupied dwellings in the neighborhood. Everybody took advantage of that, and used up the entire fund. So we had a domino effect. We had the eight homes from Rehabarama. We had the exteriors of the existing homes. All of this combined to really improve the image of South Park, and fuel the demand for the housing stock that at times, exceeded what we had available. So we saw the first Rehabarama as a catalyst, that drew people back into the city, increase the number of taxpayers by--occupying uninhabitable homes. All the original buyers from the 2001 show have remained in their homes, with the exception of one, who moved out due to a job transfer. And he was able to quickly sell his house in 2006 for 14 percent above the Rehabarama asking price. So we have seen a huge positive influence from the first Rehabarama. And when we had an opportunity to attract private investors into the neighborhood to do multiple homes. We did go to the city and lobby for money for the show, which the city quickly and generously agreed to do. Second Rehabarama, likewise, has had a domino effect. Before we even had the show, we were recipients of the American Institute of Architect's 150 grant, due in large part to our plans for Rehabarama 2007. We felt--we felt that we could actually implement some of their suggestions in the Rehabarama show, and that was crucial in us being selected for that grant. In fact, in this show, we have three examples of some of their work in the homes. We have Infill Designs and Renovation Designs that are geared toward attracting the demographics, that we feel that we can attract back to the city, the aging baby boomers. Many of our homes have been designed to not only appeal to young people just starting out, but also people as they age, one-story properties. We've seen a significant impact from both Rehabarama shows, in that the publicity surrounding the event, and the number of people coming into the event has managed to attract people to South Park proactively. We've been able to change our demographics since the first Rehabamara by increasing a lot of the incomes, and the professional people who live in South Park. For example, since the first show, we've added approximately 25 University professors, 3 physicians, 3 architects, multiple attorneys, healthcare professionals, Air Force officers, and several business owners. We should see in the next census, an increase in the income level South Park, as well as a change to the level of owner-occupied and vacant properties. The most significant benefit of Rehabarama is the education of thousands of suburban dwellers who actually come into the show, about the benefits of city living, especially the sense of community that it brings. In the midwest, there's a negative stigma associated with many cities, where it's assumed that individuals only live in the city if they're poor and don't have other options. Bringing people into the city to dispel these notions is a crucial component on the changing of the culture, in motivating people to return to the city. Allowing people to tour the upscale, attractive and affordable homes that Rehabarama has showcased, sends the message that city living is desirable, and many people live in the city by choice.

STATEMENT OF IDOTHA BOOTSIE NEAL Ms. Neal. Good morning, Mr. Chair, and good morning Congressman Turner. Welcome to the city of Dayton, the birthplace of aviation, the center of innovation, and the home of the Wright brothers and Paul Laurence Dunbar. As you know, my name is Idotha Bootsie Neal, and I'm the president of Wright Dunbar, Inc., which is a nonprofit organization dedicated to the economic and community development of the historic commercial corridor within the Wright Dunbar village. Congressman Turner, welcome home. I'd like to thank you for inviting the congressional subcommittee to hold the hearing here in Dayton, Ohio. I'd also like to thank you for all of the hard work that you're doing to help save America's cities, and which will aid in rebuilding and transforming the neighborhoods. Let me tell you just a little bit about the Wright Dunbar neighborhood. It's the place where the Wright Brothers invented the plane and African American poet Paul Laurence Dunbar began his career. For decades, Wright Dunbar was a thriving neighborhood with middle-class families, and a strong, vibrant commercial corridor. However, as most urban cities experienced in the late 1960's, and 1970's, and 1980's, and as a result of the devastating race riot in the mid 1960's, the Wright Dunbar community suffered significant disinvestment until the 1990's. Well as you know, under your leadership, when you were mayor of the city of Dayton, Congressman Turner, in partnership with me as an elected official on the Dayton City Commission, an important initiative was developed, as you've heard, Rehabarama and Citirama. These programs were targeted in residential areas where the housing stock was deteriorating, vacant lots were the norm, and high crime was simply a way of life. There were very few stores open, and little hope for any future commercial development. In 1997, the city of Dayton targeted the Wright Dunbar neighborhood for redevelopment, and helped the first ever Citirama, a program which began to give way to a rehabilitated or newly constructed homes. Prior to the cities initiative, many abandoned lots and existing homes were valued at $5,000 or less. Since Citirama initiative was launched, property values range from $79,000 to $225,000. Now, 10 years later, there are several housing construction projects still underway. One partner include ISUS, a charter school, partially funded by Youthbuild. They're building over 70 new, low to moderate homes in the area. The Innerwest Community Development Corp., in a joint venture, has built 70 newly constructed single-family, lease-to-purchase homes. Ecumenical Neighborhood Development Corp., another community development partner, has built 50 new federally subsidized single-family homes. And private sector developers are continuing to acquire lots in the Wright Dunbar neighborhoods, to build single family market rate homes. The 2000 census tract for the city of Dayton would, in fact, appear to be dismal, one where we see individuals leave the city. However, the future census data will clearly represent a reverse in the trends of families moving back into the Wright Dunbar historic urban neighborhood. At present, the surrounding neighborhoods are attracting a diverse mix of families, young professionals and retirees. These families will need services and amenities to enhance their quality of life. As stated earlier, the primary mission of Wright Dunbar, Inc. Is the redevelopment of West Third Street commercial corridor within the historic district. Strong American neighborhoods are the key to rebuilding strong urban core cities. The probability of attracting businesses to this area would be significantly lower if the Citirama housing initiatives had not been implemented in 1997. Wright Dunbar, Inc. Is working diligently to attract businesses that will bring the necessary goods and services, along with employment opportunities for neighborhood residents, which were critical components for stabilizing or transforming a neighborhood. These opportunities will positively stimulate not only the local economy, but the national economy as well. Without the infusion of financial resources targeted to the areas where poverty exists, unemployment is a way of life, health challenges are at a crisis, and housing and infrastructure is deteriorating. The future of America's core cities is dismal. Census data clearly identifies the areas where the needs are the greatest. Congressman Turner, as you know, our decision to fund Rehabarama and Citirama's throughout Dayton was based on this data. Since 1997, the Innerwest urban neighborhood of historic Wright Dunbar received $107 million of public and private sector resources. Those resources were leveraged as a result of the initial investments made by the Federal and local governments. The city of Dayton's Rehabarama and Citirama initiatives were the catalyst that ignited community development. And those initiatives in turn have ignited the momentum of commercial redevelopment, and the potential for private sector investment. It is critically important that accurate census tract information be collected, and Federal funds, and special tax initiatives, and programs and products be targeted to those neighborhoods that have the greatest need. Thank you, Congressman Turner. Thank you, Mr. Chair, for coming to Dayton, and hearing what we have to say about the redevelopment in our community, and how census tract information is very important. [The prepared statement of Ms. Neal follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Clay. Thank you very much, Ms. Neal. I'm--it's just too bad I couldn't get to the Wright Dunbar neighborhood, also. Ms. Neal. Let me please extend a personal invitation to come back. Mr. Turner. Actually, we're not far. When we're on our way to the airport, we might go there. Mr. Clay. Thank you. Thank you. We will now enter into the question period. Congressman Turner can start us off. Mr. Turner. I've got basically three questions. One that goes to the issue of the availability of census information, and capturing what you're accomplishing. The second will be about the issue of the public policy of Rehabarama, that we're investing in market rate housing, as opposed to the Federal programs that tend to target poverty. And the third will be, in ways that we might be able to greater encourage these types of programs like what Theresa's doing, where she has a separate entity owned privately. Bootsie, I want to start with you on a question of, you know, the Wright Dunbar neighborhood. Although there were some structures that were there, largely was an area where there were vacant lots, and vacant buildings. The investment that has happened with Rehabarama, and Citirama, and then with the Youthbuild project with ISUS, has a neighborhood not only of changing demographics of the resources that are there, but also really, a whole new community that is populating the area where there had not been a concentration of population. You're marketing the Wright Dunbar strip for commercial development. And it must be difficult, as you go to commercial partners, trying to encourage them to come into an area, that you can see when you drive through, and when you walk the streets and see that the new families that there--the new homeowners, but that you don't have a piece of paper you can put in front of them, and show them the change. How does that work? Ms. Neal. It's a challenge. It's a challenge. However, we're going to continue, in terms of our marketing, in terms of cultivation. We are fortunate to have National Park as one of our anchors, so we're able to attract a number of visitors to come to the community, so that partnership has been critically important. We have been very fortunate, with the residents that have come back to the area. Two things have occurred with Wright Dunbar. No. 1, everyone was not dislocated. Individuals who have been able to stand through the drugs, the prostitution, the disinvestment have been able to maintain their homes. But also because of Rehabarama, Citirama has brought a very diverse mix of individuals to the community, so it's doing exactly what we would hope that it needs. It's been a struggle without support from the Federal Government. We've been the recipients of the EDI grant, VA HUD grant, bringing those sources to the commercial development in order to stabilize buildings without those kinds of dollars, it would not have happened. We now have all of our properties structurally stabilized. Roofs are on the property. But what we need, is assistance or continued assistance to get those buildings from a shell to a white box. I then believe, that with that gap being filled, that businesses will come to the area because of the quality of the housing, because of the diversity of the community that's been attracted to the area, and simply because it's a good economic move, because we're close to downtown. We have great accessibility because of 70 and 75, that the commercial development will follow. As you're beginning to see along the Brown Street commercial corridor, near the South Park and UD area, which was a part of the Genesis project, where there were two Rehabaramas. So we're very confident, that with continued partnerships, that we'll be able to have the commercial development. Mr. Turner. That goes to my next question. You talked about the people in the community, were able to stay in the community. There were a number of Federal programs and State programs, local dollars that were stacked, so this wasn't just market-rate housing that was undertaken. But I'd like Karin and Bootsie to talk about the issue of the public policy of market- rate housing. People sometimes criticize, when the project has begun, that there is a subsidy that is going to market-rate housing. There aren't Federal dollars that you can go and get. Most of those dollars are tied to low and moderate income housing. But when you do a market-rate housing project, the criticism tends to abate after the project is done, because people see what you have reclaimed, the historic nature of the community. You have the structures that are now there, have improved the quality of the neighborhood. But also, people see that it's not economic segregation, it's actually ending economic segregation. You're making a more diverse community. The people who are there, stay in the community, and participate in the benefits of the transformation. But also, our demographics of our communities are diverse. And we not only do the market rate project of Rehabarama, but also then low income projects, Youthbuild projects, low income tax code projects, all within the same area. So the neighborhood remains diverse. Bootsie, could you talk about that for a moment? And Karin, I'd also like you to comment about your neighborhood. Ms. Neal. I think it's a great tool, the fact that we were able at a local level, be able to put together a development fund, to help with the initial investment. Individuals actually criticized us in a real way, in terms of investing in the first four houses in Wright Dunbar. And it took substantial subsidy, in order to make that happen. But of course, that initial investment has now spurred millions of dollars above both public and private sector dollars. I don't believe that if we had not made that investment, that this area would experience the kind of redevelopment that is currently undergoing. Had we not made that investment initially, you would have seen individuals continuing to live in poor housing, and in an area that was just riddled with a number of social challenges. I think that because of your leadership, because of the partnerships created with the HPA, and other organizations that we've been able to now change the neighborhood, keep people there, attract new individuals, impact significantly the income tax revenue for the local government. And even more importantly, create a place where people feel safe, and they can raise their family and their children, and have the benefits of what I think is great in urban cities, and that's such diversity in close proximity to a lot of places. Mr. Turner. Karin, you have been in South Park a long time. And I know you know, as one of the benefits of the community, is the diverse population that is there. Can you talk about how Rehabarama fits within the economic diversity of the community, and what you see as the benefits of defeating economic segregation? Ms. Manovich. We're fortunate in South Park, to automatically have economic diversity, and have had it most of our history, due to our housing stock. The founder of National Cash Register Corp. platted our neighborhood originally. He wanted his factory workers to live among his executives. So we have four of our 5,000 square foot mansions interspersed with three room cottages, similar to the one you saw today that was basically three or four rooms. So our neighborhood has been economically diverse since its inception. Now, Rehabarama, the first Rehabarama, as I mentioned, had a housing less than 800 square feet. And we had several small cottages in this one, that maintains our economic diversity. Our asking prices range originally for the first Rehabarama, the lowest one was close to 100,000. And the highest one this time, was 250,000. So there's a wide range of affordability in the houses. You're not just going to get really wealthy people. You're going to get a variety of homeowners. The other interesting thing about our neighborhood that makes it attractive and diverse, is the fact that many of the houses were originally built as multi units. Now, we've converted many of them back to larger single-family homes, but we will always have a significant rental population in South Park due to the--due to the architecture. A lot of the cottages are too small to be ever owner occupied. And so the neighborhood has worked to make sure that the rental property is kept at a level that is conducive to good living environments. So many of us--I, in fact, have rehabbed about 13 rental units in South Park myself, that I maintain, that I can make sure that people have good, affordable housing, and that I can keep the economic diversity alive in our neighborhood. And many of the residents have done the same thing. There's probably at least 25 residents who are landlords, not because that's their business choice or their calling, but in order to provide good, safe, affordable housing for a variety of economic levels in the neighborhood. Mr. Turner. Dan, you have institutional partners in your neighborhood. You were talking about--talk a moment about their interest, what brings them to the table? Mr. Barton. There's a couple of things that brought them to the table. One, is within an established neighborhood, very often there's infrastructure that has landlocked the parcels. And the expansion can either take a cooperative or a confrontational path. We wanted to make sure that we facilitated Grandview and the other institution, having a path that was--where we would all work together. At the same time, they have resources that we don't. What we've tried to do is, take advantage of their resources that they could leverage for acquiring blight and removing it. And in either swapping or allowing that land to go into new development, either for their campus, or for new housing to be created. They also understand, that they can't thrive--they can't encourage patients to come to their hospital, doctors to operate in their hospital if the perception is, that this is a terrible and unsafe neighborhood. So shoring up the neighborhood around the institution helps the institution. And the institutions have resources that will help us achieve our goals, in terms of removing blight, and facilitating new construction. We're also looking at Grandview very heavily, because they are a training hospital. We want to encourage those people who train there, and then become a part of the community for their permanent career, to invest in buying into the neighborhood, again, putting economic strength back into the mix of the population. Mr. Turner. David, your experience has run the gamut, from being the head of the Homeowners Association and bringing their resources into the inner city, which was unusual, to now being vice president of the faith based St. Mary's Neighborhood Development Corp. that does senior low-income housing, tax credits, and housing rehabilitation. When you look at the urban area, one of the impediments that we have to economic revitalization, neighborhood revitalization is our aging housing stock. You have seen that, as you have gone for rehabilitation, and then in ways that you've brought in new construction. Can you tell us some of the demographics of the neighborhoods you see, not of the populations, but of the structures themselves, the infrastructure that impacts the ability to be successful for housing development? Mr. Bohardt. Well, Dayton is--Congressman Turner, Mr. Chairman, Dayton is and it's neighborhoods are severely challenged because of the age--first of all, because of the age of our inventory, second because of the obsolescence of the inventory. Almost everyone knows that Dayton has very old housing stock, but not as many realize that as Theresa does now, that all that housing stock is anything less than obsolescence, simply because there's only one bathroom in the house, or there aren't enough bedrooms in the house, or there just isn't enough volume in size to the property to make rehabilitation cost effective. Third, I think, this relates to the purpose of this hearing, is that the census data are not neighborhood friendly, in the sense that the gentleman from the Ohio Department of Development had mentioned the lag time factor with the census. It only takes between 12 and 18 months for a neighborhood block base to totally implode. We've seen that in Dayton, in the last 5 to 10 years, and especially in the last three to four, going primarily to the impacts of predatory lending. And so it would be useful, within the quiver of economic redevelopment tools that we had, I think, if census data could be ratcheted down, and be able to focus and telescope on specific neighborhoods. I'll just make one more point, and I'll be quiet. The average median income, which is the barometer that we use in many facts to determine housing economic development policies in the Dayton Metropolitan statistical areas, $59,890, or higher than the Los Angeles, California AMI. But if you look just at the city of Dayton, for example, that income would barely be above $25,000 per house sold. So if we had--as I said, if we had more highly refined data and Federal policies that essentially enabled us to use that data, to get access on a higher priority basis, no offense to Congressman Turner's constituency in Warren County, they don't have the neighborhoods that the city of Dayton has. They don't have the needs that the city of Dayton neighborhoods have. So if we had Federal policy based on census data, Federal funding policy that actually enabled us to do finer precision targeting for economic development than cities like Dayton, cities throughout Ohio and the country. I think would be better served, and we would have a better chance of revitalizing a lot of those neighborhoods. Mr. Turner. Mr. Chairman. Mr. Clay. Thank you. Thank you so much. I have a panel wide question, and Ms. Manovich touched on it somewhat, you know. And I'm very impressed with the rehab and the Rehabarama, sounds something like Obama, but---- Mr. Turner. This came first. Mr. Clay. But I'm really curious as to how much displacement occurred in these communities. And we can start with Mr. Barton. You touched on multi-family housing, and how you maintain that in those communities that are going through this transition. Do you actually get the people to remain in that community, or do they have to leave? Because see, if they leave, then it would probably be difficult to get them back? And then, we are almost running in place, when it comes to the census, because you're not adding new people, if people are leaving while some are coming. Is there--does Dayton, or does the rehab community have much of a policy when it comes to multi-family housing and actually, the diversity of those who are moving back to the city? I'll start with you, Mr. Barton. You start, and everybody think about a response. Go ahead. Mr. Barton. Within our initiative called the Renaissance Alliance, we're not displacing anyone. We're taking, you know, occupied buildings, unoccupied land, and building new, so that the remaining structures are supported, and the accumulative population is coming up. Our population in the Grafton Hill area was the highest density in the county, but it has declined from its highest density in the early 1970's, to a level now-- where we're probably at about 65 percent of the population we had at that peak. That unoccupied portion is what we're looking to redevelop, so that we can attract people back to something that the market wants now, that isn't there, and that diversity strengthens. And one of the things that we're doing, because we're sensitive about that very issue, is we're working on mechanisms, so that the market rate structures that are being built, are giving us an income stream that will assist us with more blight removal and renovation. And in some of that blight removal, such as Grand Place in our neighborhood--at Grand and Salem, our targeted for low mods, but we end up with a better accumulative quality of life for everyone within the neighborhood. Mr. Turner. Great. Mr. Clay. Thank you. Mr. Bohardt. Mr. Chairman, Congressman Turner, in 1970, the city had housing inventory of 270,000 people. The city population now is plus or minus 152,000 or 153,000 people. About 15 percent of all of the house units in the city of Dayton are being boarded up, or vacant. And it manipulates very much to Dan's issue. Our issue is not with dislocating households. Our issue is with stabilizing neighborhoods, getting sufficient level of investment, so that we can both maintain the residents that we have in our neighborhood, and attract more people to urban neighborhoods. So I agree totally with Dan. Mr. Clay. And you know, Mr. Bohardt, that is the challenge of quite a few older urban communities, is how we get people back to the urban core. Because I represent St. Louis, Missouri. And over the last 50 years, we've lost over half a million people in the city itself. And so now that's our challenge in St. Louis and older urban cities, how we build it, and make it attractive to bring people back. Mr. Bohardt. I would add, too, Mr. Chairman probably constituents with your experience, as we do that, I would hope that Federal policy would not encourage the reconcentration of large portions of our population, in appropriately large big box housing communities. And that much of the issue that I mentioned, and Dan mentioned earlier, would be solved if we found a rational way to disperse in an even handed way, housing that was served the needs of all of our citizens, irrespective of how much they earned. Mr. Clay. Thank you for that response. Ms. Brandt, anything to add? Ms. Brandt. I think that we are a little different. Because back in the really dire time of any neighborhood, probably 40 percent of our neighborhood was abandoned houses. And now we are probably less than 10 percent, that are abandoned houses. However, the houses that are there have been converted back to single-family homes. So we've actually probably actually raised our population in the area from that. But we are also unique because we are the highest minority level of all of the historic districts. Mr. Clay. Ms. Gasper. Ms. Gasper. Reiterating what you heard already, we are targeting vacant houses. We rarely go after owner occupied. And only in a couple instances have renters been moved out of a property, and they stayed within the neighborhood. If you are familiar with the concept of broken windows, the more eyes you have on the street, the less crime you have. I think those that will be displaced are the ones that don't want to be watched. And they'll pick up--bad guys will leave if you watch them enough. I feel too, the existing neighbors feel like they can now safely reinvest more in their homes, and realize that they stand a better chance of getting that investment back out, should they decide to sell down the road. I think too, what's working in favor of cities right now, people really want to know their neighbors. And I think they're getting really tired of the cookie cutter nature of the suburbs, and realize that if you had gone to the fifth beige and brick house on the right, you have gone too far. You need to go to the fourth one, that factors into it. And also, I just was--as a side story, I read on a recent blog post regarding Rehabarama, somebody said that they're from the suburbs, and Rehabarama introduced them to the city of Dayton they'd never seen before, and they'd totally rethink their opinion of the city of Dayton as a result. Mr. Clay. How about, have you noticed--I've heard you mention--several witnesses mention property values have increased. With that increase of property values, has there been an overall reduction in the insurance rates for home insurance, as well as auto insurance? You know, all of those things impact disadvantaged neighborhoods in a negative way. With the new--new neighbors moving in, has that helped in that area? Ms. Manovich. It hasn't changed yet. We haven't seen it change. Mr. Clay. You're still pretty high? Mr. Turner. We're pretty inexpensive here in Dayton anyway. I don't know that they "
