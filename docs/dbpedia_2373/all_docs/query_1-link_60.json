All throughout the Buckeye State, there are captivating Christmas light displays that will make you feel as if you’re in a real-life winter wonderland. While all are incredible, a few superlative standouts are the Legendary Lights of Clifton Mill (an award-winning display), the PNC Festival of Lights at the Cincinnati Zoo (another nationally acclaimed event), and Wildlights at the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium. But really, they’re all incredible and guaranteed to get you in the spirit for the season! Here are some of what we consider to be the must-visit spots to view Christmas lights in Ohio -- which is your favorite?\n\nWhat's Christmas in Ohio like?\n\nWhile the Buckeye State is always dreaming of a white Christmas, the reality is, our Christmases are generally pretty quiet. This isn't a bad thing; we can usually enjoy holiday hikes and lights excursions without enduring weather that's too frigid or unbearable. Of course, sometimes it does snow on Christmas, which is the icing on the cake. With so many fun holiday events and activities in Ohio, Christmastime is a marvelous part of the year that we all very much enjoy and look forward to!\n\nWhat's the most unique place to see Christmas lights in Ohio?\n\nYou've probably heard of \"Christmas towns,\" but here in Ohio, we have a Christmas ranch! The Christmas Ranch in Morrow, Ohio, features one of the most enchanting light displays you’ll ever see. It’s a walk-through village unlike any other holiday attraction in the state. This magical (and massive!) Christmas Village in Ohio is a world unto itself, complete with a million LED lights, impressive decorations and displays, a Santa-themed cafe, Christmas train, holiday shops, and even the Man in Red himself! Have you been to this incredible Christmas village in Ohio.\n\nFeatured Addresses\n\n1000 Carillon Blvd, Dayton, OH 45409, USA"
