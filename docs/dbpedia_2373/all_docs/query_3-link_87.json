        "text": "Dayton History\n\nDayton History brings the past to life with passion and pride in our region’s creative heritage. Dayton History is the recognized regional historical organization that collects, preserves, interprets, presents and promotes the region’s assets, stories and experiences. We offer quality interpretive and educational programming in order to help local residents understand what it means to be a Daytonian, and to help people everywhere know the enormous impact creative Daytonians have had, and continue to have, on the nation and the world.\n\nThe organization boasts three campuses in the greater Dayton, Ohio area: Carillon Historical Park, the Patterson Homestead, and the Archive Center. In 2007 we began operating tours of Hawthorn Hill, home of Orville Wright, in partnership with the Wright Family Foundation. Carillon Historical Park is the keystone of Dayton History, with 25 historical buildings and countless artifacts on display.\n\nCarillon Park\n\nFounded by Colonel Edward and his wife Edith Deeds in 1942, the Park is situated on a beautiful 65-acre campus between the Great Miami River and a glacial moraine. The park shares the region’s history from Dayton's founding in 1796 through the important local contributions made during World War II.\n\nAmong the Park’s artifacts is the 1905 Wright Flyer III, the world’s first practical airplane and National Historic Landmark, named the Best Historical Artifact by Ohio Magazine. Other highlights include the 1835 B&O (Grasshopper) steam locomotive and the first automobile self-starter. The park is also home to its namesake, the Deeds Carillon, one of Dayton’s best-known landmarks and the largest carillon in Ohio.\n\nFor more information about Dayton History and Carillon Historical Park, please visit www.daytonhistory.org"
