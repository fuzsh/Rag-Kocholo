        "text": "Categories\n\nArlington Heights\n\nLocated high above the city just north of US-35 and near Gettysburg Ave, this smaller, mixed-use neighborhood has great views of downtown.\n\nArlington Heights contains a mix of one and two-story homes, including bungalow and American foursquare architectural styles. Its proximity to W. Third Street makes this neighborhood convenient to walk or drive to several restaurants and businesses, including the Westown Shopping Center.\n\nArlington Heights is also home to The Wright Company Factory Site, the first factory in America built for manufacturing airplanes. The Wright Company Factory Site is now home to the West Branch of the Dayton Metro Library.\n\nOn the western boundary of the neighborhood, Arlington Heights Park includes greenspace, basketball courts, and a playground. This neighborhood’s location next to US-35 gives it unique re-development opportunities and offers easy access to all major freeways in the region.\n\nCategories\n\nBelmont\n\nBelmont is the southeastern-most neighborhood in the city, located near Wayne Avenue, Wilmington Pike, and Patterson Road. It borders the City of Kettering to the south and east and is accessible via the Iron Horse Recreation Trail.\n\nBelmont homes vary in style, but are typically single-story bungalow or Cape Cod, with some newer builds throughout the neighborhood. Belmont has many parks and greenspace, including Belmont Park, Nordale Park, and Woodman Fen. Lohrey Recreation Center is situated in the heart of this neighborhood and includes after-school programs, a swimming pool, summer camps, and senior programs.\n\nBelmont is also home to the Watervliet Business District, one of the largest neighborhood business districts in the city. It includes a variety of longstanding retailers, coffee shops, and restaurants. Neighborhood events include “Belmont Days” in the fall, a Christmas tree lighting event, and a spring picnic.\n\nBelmont is the largest and most densely populated neighborhood in Dayton. Its mature status and high number of amenities makes it one of the most walkable and livable neighborhoods in the city.\n\nCategories\n\nBurkhardt\n\nBurkhardt is a densely residential, near-east neighborhood situated around East Third Street, East Fifth Street, Burkhardt Avenue, and Huffman Avenue.\n\nHomes in Burkhardt are generally two-story and built in the early 1900’s. The most common house style is Prairie, with some Victorian homes scattered throughout.\n\nBurkhardt has many community anchors including educational institutions, religious communities, and businesses. Neighborhood events include The Burkhardt Festival, holiday events, and fundraisers like the Dayton Police vs. Dayton Fire basketball game.\n\nAs one of Dayton’s most ethnically and culturally diverse neighborhoods, Burkhardt offers a welcoming atmosphere and space for new traditions to take hold.\n\nCategories\n\nCarillon\n\nThe Carillon neighborhood is a riverfront community bordered by S. Edwin C. Moses Boulevard, Cincinnati Street, and Washington Street. This neighborhood has quick access to freeways, downtown Dayton and the University of Dayton.\n\nCarillon has a mixture of brick Cape Cod and frame houses primarily built in the 1940s to accommodate small and mid-size families.
