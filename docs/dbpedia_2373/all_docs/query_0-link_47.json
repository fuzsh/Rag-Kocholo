        "text": "One of the buildings in the Carillon Historical Park in Dayton, Ohio is the James F. Dicke Family Transportation Center. The building was designed to be reminiscent of Dayton’s Union Station and a railroad roundhouse.\n\nSteam Locomotive\n\nThe 1835 John Quincy Adams is the oldest existing locomotive manufactured in the United States. It was used mainly between Baltimore and Washington, D.C. It is known as a grasshopper engine because of the angle and movement of its long piston rods.\n\nHorse-Drawn Wagons\n\nTrolleys\n\nDayton began using electric trolleys in 1888. In the summer, open trolleys were used, and closed-body trolleys were used in the winter.\n\nTrolley Buses\n\nElectric powered trolley buses are powered by dual overhead wires. Coach #515 was built in 1949 by the Matrmon-Herrington Company and was used until 1988.\n\nInterurban\n\nInterurban cars transported people between urban and rural areas. The car shown below was build in 1902.\n\nMore Carillon Historical Park\n\nCarillon Historical Park: A Shaker building (photo diary)\n\nCarillon Historical Park: Dayton Cyclery (photo diary)\n\nCarillon Historical Park: Newcom Tavern (photo diary)\n\nCarillon Historical Park: Horse Barn (photo diary)\n\nCarillon Historical Park: Sugar Camp Cabin 22 (photo diary)\n\nCarillon Historical Park: Canal Supervisor's Office (photo diary)\n\nCarillon Historical Park: Bootleggers, Bandits, and Badges (photo diary)"
