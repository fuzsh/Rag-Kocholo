        "text": "In 1830, Daniel and Catharine Arnold, of Rockingham County, Virginia, along with their five children, decided to move west. They sold their land, packed their possessions in a wagon, and set off for Ohio. After a long journey by ox and wagon, they settled along Dry Run, a tributary of the Mad River. The property they settled on was initially purchased by Henry Harshbarger, Catharine Arnold’s father, in 1830. Upon arriving, the family moved into a log house previously built on the site. In the spring, Daniel Arnold bought 158 acres from his father-in-law for $2,000. A new house was finished by the Arnold Family in 1836 using bricks from a nearby kiln and lumber.\n\nPrior to his father’s death in 1864, Henry H. Arnold, the youngest of the Arnold sons, had purchased 144 acres of the old Arnold farmstead from his father. With Henry as the owner, the farm would see much growth and prosperity in the years ahead. In 1878, Henry Arnold accomplished two major additions to the farm. First, a new addition was added on to the original brick house, featuring a winter kitchen. Second, a new barn was built to house both livestock and crops. Throughout the 1880s, the farm remained extremely productive and prosperous.\n\nIn 1891, Henry Arnold’s son, Henry C. Arnold married Sally Deeter, and the newlyweds set up housekeeping in the Daniel Arnold House. Henry Arnold then moved into the original log house at the farm. Henry C. Arnold tended to the farm until 1908 when he moved to Covington, Ohio to settle his own farm.\n\nEmma Arnold then took care of the old Arnold Farmstead, even after the death of her father, Henry Arnold, in 1910. Finally in 1916, Emma Arnold sold off her family’s farm and moved to Dayton. After passing through several families’ hands, the farm was eventually acquired by the Dayton-Montgomery County Park District, now known as Five Rivers MetroParks, in 1968.\n\nJames M. Cox, Jr. bought a farm on the south edge of Dayton in January 1952, and 3 years later he bought the 68 acres adjacent to it. A pleasant house set back in the woods would serve as a quiet week-end retreat for him and his wife. Helen. Cox named the place Spring Running.\n\nCox deeded the farm to his wife after they divorced. She remarried, but died soon thereafter. Spring Running was returned to Cox in her will in 1958. He now faced the question of what to do with Spring Running. The Coxes were childless; there were no youngsters to play in its fields, explore its wooded slopes, and scramble up and down its rocky ravines. Except for the parochial school directly across Springboro Pike and the elementary school immediately to the south, almost all the surrounding land was rapidly becoming intensively developed. A home builder, Layne, made Cox a tempting offer and showed him a plan. It called for some 200 homes on small lots along curving streets surrounding a few acres to be reserved as green space where families could picnic, play, and fly kites.\n\nCox shared his development plans with Jean Mahoney, a family member and avid gardener that he admired and trusted. Jean, who had been working with fellow gardeners Jean Woodhull and Marie Aull on a Save our Open Space Committee, relayed concerns to Cox, who she recalls could be an impatient man. “Well,” he barked, “go figure something out.” She prepared a thoughtful paper proposing establishment of an arboretum on the Cox property and identifying critical issues that would need to be considered. She made her request to Cox, who replied to her request with a short letter on Cox Enterprises stationery: “Congratulations. You got your Arboretum!”\n\nOn December 3, 1962, papers were filed with the Montgomery County Common Pleas Court transferring title to Spring Running to the James M. Cox, Jr. Arboretum.\n\nFor many years, the property was cared for by dedicated volunteers, who also governed the Foundation. These volunteers – including Jean Mahoney, Jean Woodhull, Marie Aull and Ruth Burke – supervised the planting of lilacs, crabapples, Linden trees, pines, junipers, spruce and a collection of plants donated from Dawes Arboretum in Newark through the 1960′s.\n\nThe land that Eastwood MetroPark stands on has ties back to Dayton’s very early history. In 1796, 3 separate groups of people made settlement at Dayton. One of those groups was led by Wm Hamer. After his family arrived, it is reported that in 1802, he built a grist mill, at the site of present Eastwood Park and had the whole country coming to him to grind their meal. Later records show that a Mr. Henry Leatherman built a dam in Madriver, just above the Eastwood Park in 1812.\n\nFlash forward almost 100 years to 1913, and the devastating flood. To prevent further floods in the valley, the Miami Conservancy District was organized to prevent further floods, their action including the construction of earthen dams, including one on the Mad River just upstream from Eastwood. Much land was subject to flooding by this construction and to avoid damage suits, MCD bought up all the land subject to flood or change in any way. After construction was complete, the land was sold, subject to flooding during high water, and since the city of Dayton needed more drinking water wells and a right of way for a conduit to carry the water from the wells to the pumps, the city bought the river bed to Huffman Dam.\n\nThe city formed a fine park opposite the Smithville Road in the river bed, which was opened to the public and enjoyed by many of the citizens during the summer. It was named Eastwood Park. In 1917, the city of Dayton purchased an additional 15 acres of adjacent land and a new shelter house was erected. Camps were also made available for those seeking an escape from the city.\n\nBy the 1940s, the park had become a popular spot for boating and picnicking. Its tree-shaded lagoons and large lake attract thousands during the summer months. Owing to the popularity of this park, it was necessary to build two more rentable cabins equipped with fireplaces and cooking utensils.\n\nThe rapid growth of both the civilian and the army personnel sections at Wright Field early in 1943, and the lack of recreational facilities at the field, presented quite a problem of morale to those in charge at the field. The problem of employing the leisure time of its employees profitably and happily became one of major importance. To address this issue, it was necessary to secure a location of suitable size where many outdoor activities could be conducted and which would be equipped to handle the varied interests of field employees.\n\nAfter investigation of the facilities available in and around Dayton, it was decided that Eastwood Park embodied most of the attractive features for which they were searching. It was located most advantageously for the greater part of the field workers, since it was on their route to and from work. It was decided to approach the City of Dayton with a view toward acquiring the park facilities for recreational purposes. A series of conferences with City officials resulted in the seasonal reservation of the facilities on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday of each week.\n\nTo the park’s existing facilities were added badminton, volley ball and horseshoe courts. The softball field was reconditioned and put in good playing condition. The swimming pool (at the site of the now lagoon), which had not been used for swimming for several years was placed at the disposal of those who were interested in Bait Casting. Boating was available to all participants. All picnic shelters were reserved to employees on the three nights names and many departmental, group, and family picnics were enjoyed. At no time was the park restricted to the sole use of Wright Field employees. It was open at all times for the enjoyment of all the people of Dayton, which provided the Field employees an opportunity to become acquainted with others person not employed at the Field.\n\nIn 1972 the lake on the other side of the Mad River was completed (a by product of the American Aggregate Corporation’s mining). The lake held two functions: one was to provide water recreation for the community and also to help protect the city’s water supply by acting as a recharge basin for the aquifer. The lake, known as the “Hydrobowl” became a popular spot for boating and even rock concerts in the 1970s.\n\nAlthough a popular spot for organized rugby and soccer games, disc golf and the annual Mountain Days Festival, Eastwood had become a burden to the city during the 1980s as budget cuts reduced staff, maintenance and security patrols, and as vandalism and criminal activity increased.\n\nJohn H. Patterson, founder of National Cash Register Company, believed that education and outdoor exercise were the pillars of good health for not only himself, but also his employees. In the early 1900s, Patterson owned hundreds of acres south of Dayton. He knew the community could benefit from planned green space for leisure activities. Patterson hired John Charles Olmsted and Frederick Law Olmsted Jr., the sons of world famous landscape architect, Frederick Law Olmsted responsible for the design of Central Park in New York City, to work their magic on the natural terrain. Patterson began a relationship with the Olmsted Brothers in 1894 after developing a strong appreciation for their “natural school” of landscaping gardening.\n\nThe results of their work at Hills and Dales were picturesque creeks, trails for riding and walking, sugar maples, wild flowers and the fragrance of honeysuckle.\n\nHills & Dales Park must have been a novel experience for most Daytonians when it opened in 1907. With its carefully designed meadows, water, and woods, it was meant to recreate, in gardens, the perfection found in nature. It was intended to provide a place for city dwellers to conveniently enjoy beautiful natural scenery and obtain relief from the nervous strain of urban life.\n\nIn its early days, park goers could take a short ride from the city and be immersed in nature. Visitors strolled walking paths on foot or horse. They picked blackberries, wild strawberries, May apples, walnuts and hickory nuts and ate them on the grounds. They lingered near wading pools and picnicked in Adirondack camps.\n\nIn 1918, confident that the city of Dayton could care for it, Patterson deeded the park to the public, although the property was outside the city limits.\n\nFamilies were attracted to Hills and Dales in the 1920s, as a welcome change from city living. The Old Barn Club, located along Patterson Boulevard just north of West Dorothy Lane, was the hub of the social and cultural life of the people of the Miami Valley – it a most desirable place to use for wedding receptions, organization meetings and family gatherings. It had brown, stained clapboard siding and resembled a Swiss chalet with porches on several sides. A series of steps from the road turned into a large sitting room two stories in height around which ran a balcony. Wicker furniture, rockers and high-backed chairs faced an alcove with a large fireplace and a player piano. There was a natural amphitheater for Sunday afternoon concerts by local artists, and Sunday meals were open to the public.\n\nThe Old Barn Club was destroyed by fire in the late 1920s. By the early 1930s, the park lands started to be chipped away. The series of open meadows, polo fields and open air theatre were converted to golf course; eastern sections were subdivided for housing development. This left only a small sliver of natural park along the ridgeline directly east of the golf course.\n\nJohn H. Patterson, co-founder of National Cash Register Company, believed education, recreation, and outdoor exercise were the pillars of good health. A memorial to Patterson was erected in the 1920s and stands in the heart of Hills & Dales to honor his leadership. The bronze and granite monument by Italian sculptor Giovanni Morretti places Patterson and his favorite horse, Spinner, at the top of the hill where he often rode on the bridle paths. Allegorical figures representing prosperity, progress, industry, and education also are included to represent Patterson’s influence on the community.\n\nKnown by a number of names, including Frankenstein’s Castle, Patterson’s Castle, and the Witch’s Tower, the tower at the park was constructed of stone salvaged from condemned buildings by the National Youth Administration (NYA) as a project during the Great Depression and finished in 1941.\n\nBy 1990′s, the original character of what was left of the site had been transformed by years of vegetation growth. Almost 90 percent of the natural areas were overgrown with Amur honeysuckle. In 1993, the City of Dayton completed a study of the historic property in conjunction with Ball State University and published a document entitled “Hills and Dales Park Historic Landscape Preservation Master Plan.”\n\nA group of concerned citizens named “Friends of Hills & Dales Park” started a cleanup effort in the late 1980′s, anchored around cleanup days where volunteers cleared huge amounts of honeysuckle, painted shelters, planted bulbs and performed general clean up. The group, led by Dayton Garden Club member and MetroParks commissioner Jean Woodhull, continued with cleanups and bulb planting well into the 1990′s. Woodhull’s passion for Hills & Dales had a significant impact on the MetroParks decision to assume operations and maintenance in 1999.\n\nThe Huffman Prairie extended over what are now Huffman MetroPark and the adjacent land that is part of Wright Patterson Air Force Base. It was on this prairie area that Orville Wright recommended in 1917 that a large air field be constructed. It was also the location where the Wright brothers conducted their second successful flight. A memorial to the Wright Brothers is maintained by the Air Force on base property. Sited on a high bluff, just east of State Route 444, the memorial overlooks the dam and park. Remnants of the original prairie can be found on the base in a small area below the dam.\n\nThe site of the Huffman dam was once the town of Osborn. About 200 wood frame homes were moved to higher ground in 1922 to make way for the Miami Conservancy District’s Huffman Dam flood plain. The relocation of Osborn, which merged in 1950 with neighboring Fairfield to become Fairborn, was one of the biggest local consequences of the great flood of 1913. The construction of the earthen dam across the Mad River began in January of 1918 and was completed in December of 1921.\n\nBetween 1827 and 1830 a portion of the now park was set up what became known as Kneisly Station. It was settled by John Kneisly, who eventually owned about 1,200 acres, much of which became part of the Huffman Prairie land. The family’s history book shows John had a daughter, Catherine, and son, George, both of whom died in 1828 and were buried in the family cemetery on land now within the park.\n\nOn July 28, 1838, the first and largest company of Mormon pioneers to migrate west camped along the Mad River near what is now Huffman MetroPark. Known as Kirtland Camp, the 515 members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons) appeared as a train of 59 covered wagons and 189 head of livestock stretching a distance of 9 miles. They were heading to Missouri from Kirtland, Ohio. The migrants fled religious persecution and sought new homes and religious freedom. They sought respite here during the journey. To earn money, the Saints accepted various jobs. These included building dykes and levees, and half-mile section of Springfield-Dayton Turnpike. The Saints resumed their trek on August 29, 1838. The bodies of 5 children who died during the encampment on the Mad River are buried here.\n\nIsland MetroPark was formerly known as the White City Amusement Park in the late 19th century. The park had a dance pavilion, amusement rides, canoe lockers, refreshment stand, and other recreation features. By 1907 the park had become run down and not well maintained. In 1910, Dayton started leasing the park land for $3,000 a year, and in 1911, a recommendation to buy the land was proposed in the report submitted by the Olmsted Brothers; world renowned and famous for enhancing the natural beauty of urban sites with their designs. It’s noteworthy that the whole report stems from the urging of John Patterson (co-founder of the National Cash Register Company).\n\nThe Great Flood of 1913 left the Dayton area incapacitated and knocked out the bridge that allowed passage; and damaged a number of buildings at the White City Amusement Park. Because of the park was located in a flood area there was initially no redeeming quality to replace the bridge that connected the park at Helena Street to the Main St. car line.\n\nThen, on July 13, 1913, the Dayton Canoe Club held its first regatta. D.W. Begley the owner to the boathouse across from White City Park ferried spectators across the river free of charge. Consequently, after two more successful regattas’ that summer the Dayton city officials decided to rebuild White City. On June 20, 1914, the park formally opened as Island Park. The park became an ideal location in the coming years for programming that included bathing, picnicking, canoeing, boating, dancing, ice skating, water carnivals, evening band concerts, and general recreation.\n\nIn the 1920s, Dayton’s municipal leaders were keeping a watchful eye on a potential den of decadence, at the Island Park dance pavilion. Only the year before the nation had decided to improve its moral fiber with “the noble experiment” known as Prohibition, outlawing the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages. A report to City Manager J. E. Barlow warned of the “slow, sensuous character of the music” being played at the pavilion and the “suggestive movements” of the dancers. A Dayton Daily News article of July 10, 1920, carried the headline: “Shimmy Music at Island Park; Conditions Bad.”\n\nIn 1940, a Band shell was erected, and opened under the name of the Leslie L. Diehl Band shell where programmed concert attendance totaled 80,000 in 1943. One account in 1940 said “Canoeing is one of the popular forms of recreation in Island Park. For the benefit of the canoeists, new lockers which will house about 382 canoes were constructed. In addition, since this park is also used by many groups of picnickers, a new shelter house was built. Band concerts at Island Park have been provided for many years. A new band shell was completed this year which is one of the finest in the country. Many thousands have enjoyed the concerts and other entertainments during the past season. It is estimated that crowds from 8,000 to 12,000 in a single evening have enjoyed the concerts.”\n\nBud Abbott and Lou Costello, a film comedy team, filled Island Park on August 16, 1942 when they arrived to help build interest in the war bond and stamp campaign. More than 20,000 people came to watch the two men clown around.\n\nIn the 1970s and 80s, Island became the home of large festivals like Dayton River Festival each Memorial Day weekend. Over the years, the festival featured music, food, entertainment and activities, including water sports on the Stillwater River. The event usually drew 60,000 to 70,000 people. A ban was placed on fireworks after a shell exploded in the crowd at the 1988 River Festival, injuring 27 people. This caused declining attendance and eventually killed the festival.\n\nIn the 1990s the park was home to the Dayton Black Cultural and Fly City Festivals.\n\nDayton official annual reports reveal a pattern of heavy use and evolution of the park and it shows that through war and peace, prosperity and urban challenge, Island Park remained a focal point of Dayton recreation for decades.\n\nArgonne Forest Park was founded in 1930 by Daytonian Null Hodapp, who returned from WWI and had a successful career as a judge in the area. Null purchased nearly 400 acres of wooded land along Germantown Pike and named the property Argonne Forest Park in honor of the Unit he served in during the war. Development of the park began with the construction of a veteran’s clubhouse. Behind the clubhouse, to the south, was a carnival-like midway. Development of the clubhouse area was followed by other additions. These included a swimming hole and diving platform, baseball diamond, shooting range, dance hall, pony and horse tracks, and a figure-eight auto race track.\n\nIt was not until World War II and gas rationing that crowds began to dwindle and the demise of Argonne Forest Park soon followed. After Hodapp’s death in 1945, some small parcels of land were sold off. In 1966, the park district bought the remaining land.\n\nA part of the area today, still called Argonne Forest, is located in the northwest portion of the park. Dominated by tall beech trees, it is not unusual to hear the hoot of a great horned owl or see deer while walking the trails here. The close observer can still find hints of the original park. A low L-shaped wall, once part of the swimming pool, can still be seen and remains of three street cars are hidden on the forest floor. A large cement square, which may have been part of the dance floor, also remains. Most of the figure-eight auto track is now under a lake built by the Park District in 1979, but a hiking trail still follows portions of the old track. The building that was once the veterans’ clubhouse still stands on the southeast corner of Germantown Pike and Frytown Road. Behind it, some of the buildings that were part of the carnival midway remain.\n\nThe site of RiverScape was Van Cleve Park for more than 100 years. Daniel Cooper, founder of Dayton and landowner, gave the land for a hydraulic, but he also saw the site for its beauty as well as its practical need. It was he who, when the troops were quartered in Dayton in 1812, set the young recruits to building a levee on site. The river menaced the town at every heavy rainfall. In time an embankment made its way down the river edge from the head of Main Street, where the rising ground made a natural protection.\n\nWhether Cooper had any legal right or not, this was a fine foresighted, public-spirited thing to do. Other men saw the possibilities of the levee as a public park. Benjamin Van Cleve, patriarch of one of Dayton’s first families as well as Dayton’s first postmaster and first teacher, planted elms and maples throughout its length and, under the spreading trees with the river flowing lazily (or ferociously, according to the season), at its foot it became the favored walk of Daytonians. Van Cleve’s nine-year old daughter Mary is said to be the first one to step foot ashore in 1795 near to site of the now park.\n\nJohn W. Van Cleve, Benjamin’s son, was the first male child born in Dayton. John became noted for his literary, scientific and artistic attainments, he planned and labored incessantly for Dayton’s development along all lines, physical, educational and social. He founded the Public Library, surveyed and laid out Woodland Cemetery and organized Dayton’s first Musical Society. At one point he became Dayton’s Mayor.\n\nFor no one could a park be more appropriately named than for such an enthusiastic lover of nature and his fellow-men as John Van Cleve. When the levees were built, or enlarged, he fundraised to purchase and plant trees on both sides of the levees. At first, elms were planted on the river side and maples on the other side. Afterwards silver-leaf poplars, recently introduced, and then much admired, were also set out. He planted the trees himself. The little granddaughter of a pioneer used to accompany him, and note down from his dictation, in his memorandum-book, under the proper date, the variety of trees planted and its exact position.\n\nHe knew the name of nearly every plant and tree within Montgomery County, and in what locality they could be found. Through his influence the early residents of Dayton felt a special interest and pride in the flowers and trees of the surrounding woods and prairies. He loved to bring home from his botanical excursions elegant shrubs or rare flowering plants, which, as he lived at a hotel, he presented to friends, setting them out himself in their yards. He wished his native place to be as beautiful as the elm-embowered New England towns, and thought these glorious trees would keep his memory as a public benefactor green for generations; but his ungrateful fellow-citizens, as soon as his elms began to fulfill his expectations, chopped them down.\n\nIn the latter half of the 1800′s, James Campbell’s home stood across the street from this spot, on Monument Avenue between Jefferson and St. Clair Streets. As a city council member, Campbell grew impatient with the eye sore that had developed on what is now Van Cleve Park. He envisioned a picturesque strip of land overlooking the river, but at the time the city used the property as a dumping ground. When he heard of plans to build a bakery there, Campbell realized this would be his last chance and bought the property for twenty-five dollars. With partners Richard C. Anderson and Samuel B. Smith, he deeded the land to the City of Dayton and restricted the deed to ensure that this ideal location on the river would always remain a park. Though it took sixteen years for the plan to become a reality, Van Cleve Park began its history as one of Dayton’s most beautiful settings in 1892. The park was named for John Van Cleve, perhaps to honor his efforts to beautify Dayton.\n\nFrom 1896 to 1965, Van Cleve was also home to the historic Newcom’s Tavern until it was moved to Carillon Park. This civic center of social and business life was originally built on the southeast corner of Main and Monument. John H. Patterson, president of NCR, paid for the move to Van Cleve Park in 1896.\n\nThe park remained a green space managed by the City of Dayton for decades. It was part of grand river corridor plans in 1972 and 1977 that resulted in hiking and biking paths, the downtown low dam, River’s Edge Park, The Landing, Eastwood Lake and several levee stairways with bike rails. Plans never came to fruition though for the proposed canals along Patterson Boulevard and near the river’s bend off Monument Avenue or the proposed restaurants that would have floated on a river barge or rolled on riverside train tracks, or the downtown children’s zoo and amusement park at Van Cleve Park, or the ball field complexes and outdoor amphitheaters planned on both sides of the Great Miami below the low dam at Monument Avenue. Less ambitious ideas – foot bridges, water taxis and docks for row boats and canoes, picnic areas and a “festival enclave at Island Park” were also discarded. Other river attractions had brief lifespan, such as the downtown rentals of canoes and bicycles and the floating garden and fountain on the river downtown.\n\nBy 1995 there was a bike path, but the river had few benches, drinking fountains, levee-top shade trees, pay phones, public restrooms, picnic areas or bike racks – all of which have been suggested over the last 20 years. There wasn’t any one organization focusing on making those things happen. Then came Five Rivers MetroParks.\n\nTaylorsville Dam is an earthen embankment located across the Great Miami River in northern Montgomery County near the City of Vandalia. U.S. 40 goes across the top of the dam. Construction of the dam began in February of 1918 and was completed in November of 1921. After the Miami Conservancy District completed the construction of the Taylorsville Dam, the surrounding land was opened for recreational use. In the 1930s, Cilvilian Conservation Corps built several features in the park to enhance the visitors’ experience, including a stone shelter house that still stands today, as well as stone walls and stairways. They also planted hundreds of trees including a large oak grove and Red and Scotch Pines.\n\nTadmor Village\n\nThe land where Taylorsville MetroPark now sits has a robust and storied history. It was once the site of the bustling town of Tadmor, one of the most important centers of transportation in early Ohio history.\n\nAs early as 1809, keelboats were poled up river from Dayton to take on freight from Tadmor. In 1822, the construction of a canal to connect Lake Erie to the Ohio River was commissioned. By 1837, the Miami/Erie Canal stretched, through Tadmor, connecting Cincinnati to Piqua and was finally connected to Lake Erie by 1845. Just two years later the first federally funded road (The National Road) was constructed through Tadmor. In 1851, the Dayton & Michigan Railroad established freight and passenger service to Tadmor. This faster and more dependable mode of transportation eventually led to the demise of the Miami-Erie Canal. Nevertheless, in 1852, trains, canal boats, keelboats, and wagon and coaches were heading in all directions from Tadmor. With all four means of transportation of the day within yards of each other, Tadmor was truly the Crossroads of America.\n\nThe great flood of 1913 put an end to Tadmor. As the Great Miami River swelled out of its banks, it drowned the stretch of train tracks surrounding the town and destroyed the aqueducts of the Miami/Erie Canal. When the water retreated, the train tracks were moved to higher ground and the canal, already in decline, was abandoned. The Miami Conservancy District took over the land and built the Taylorsville Dam in 1922. Old National Road was moved south to cross the top of the new dam. A structure or two remained in Tadmor until about 1960, when the last tenants moved out of the original grain dealer’s house and it was demolished.\n\nToday, the Buckeye Trail follows the path of the original Dayton & Michigan Railroad through the park, and takes walkers and bikers through the ruins of Tadmor for a glimpse of important regional history.\n\nIn 1926, the land for Camp Hook was donated to the council. The camp opened in 1927 and operated until 1991. The land for Camp Hook was donated by the Charles R. Hook family. Charles Hook was the President of the American Rolling Mill Company (ARMCO). In early 1929 Mr. Hook donated a significant amount of stock to the Middletown Area Council with the instructions to immediately sell it and use the proceeds to put in a swimming pool at the camp. The timing on this event was advantageous considering early in the fall of 1929 was the crash of the stock market known as Black Friday and the beginning of the Great Depression. The sale of the stock yielded enough money to put in the swimming pool and purchase more land to the north, expanding the camp’s size significantly. The waterfront of the camp was later named Lake George after Charles Hook’s son, George Verity Hook. For years, Camp Hook hosted Boy Scout retreats that attracted about 100 Scouts every week.\n\nAfter the camp’s closure, the majority of the structures were torn down and the swimming pool filled in. Most of the campsites have grown over as well, but many landmarks or signs of the former use of the area remain. A large rock with embedded plaque thanking the Hooks for the donation remains, as does the amphitheatre campfire bowl, the Administration Lodge, the Maintenance Building, the Chapel (now called the Natuary) and a few other structures that are in ruins. One point of interest that remains is the Gilwell Tree. A local Scout in the 1970s took a vacation to England with his family, during which they visited Gilwell Park, the home of the Scouting movement. A sapling of one of the English Oaks was brought back from Gilwell Park and planted at Camp Hook to signify the ties between Scouting in the US and the worldwide movement. In 2010 a plaque and a split rail fence were created to honor the tree and one of the leading, and oldest, scout leaders in the Council. It was an Eagle Scout Service Project.\n\nThe Thunderbird Trail existed as a 6-mile (9.7-km) long loop around Camp Hook. It was in use for many years during the camp’s time as a part of Mound Builders Area Council and Dan Beard Council. Scouts could earn a patch upon completing the entire trail. Although the Thunderbird trail is no longer maintained, those who remember where it was may find the trail markers and Order of the Arrow (OA) fire-rings still visible.\n\nCamp Hook remains an important place for local scout troops to camp and hold badge ceremonies. Hundreds of Boy Scouts attend the annual Camp Hook Reunion held at the park each summer.\n\nCarlisle Fort existed about 2,000 years ago. It is a Hopewell Indian hilltop fortification that lies on the west bank of the Twin Creek. It’s long, low mound winds along the edge of steep ravines and encloses about 10 acres. Carlisle Fort is thought to have been built from AD 1 to AD 300. Historians believe this type of defensive fortification was a reflective measure concerning a declining cultural race. The first survey of the site was by S.H. Binkley and C.E. Blossom in 1835. They returned to the site in 1875 for further examination. Carlisle Fort is different in respect to other earthworks located along the Scioto, Ohio, Great Miami, and the Muskingum Rivers, because of its location along a secondary waterway. The actual site is located on the peak of a hill a short distance west of the Twin Creek. On the north and south side of the hill are deep ravines; on the east of the extensive bluff is a sharp declining drop of from one hundred and twenty-five to two hundred feet. On the east of the bluff is a terrace leading to the Twin Creek.\n\nJ.P. MacLean, an early archaeologist, writes in 1885 in regards to the layout of the fort: “The terrace is separated in two parts, an upper and lower, formed in the direction of the stream. On the west the hill is connected with the level lands by a broad peninsula. The wall is not accompanied by a ditch, and is situated on the brow of the hill, except on the northern side, where it occurs a little below. The wall, for the most part, is made of surface material although limestone is found in the southwestern gate. On the west, where the enclosure is most exposed, are discovered three walls. The entire length of the wall on the direct line of the middle wall, is three thousand six hundred and seventy-six feet, and encloses an area of from twelve to fifteen acres. The length of the wall on the Twin bluff is eleven hundred and ten feet.”\n\nWithin the enclosure two stone mounds and one stone circle was originally located, the circle being near the center of the enclosed area. The stones within this enclosure were of such great abundance that when the first white settlers first saw the enormity of this find, they hurriedly made a makeshift road. With many hundreds of wagons they removed the stone contents, which were used in building dwellings, houses, barns, wells, etc., leaving only depression marks where the stone and circle mounds once stood.\n\nIt is largely because of Fort Carlisle that Twin Creek MetroPark took shape. Most of these earthworks were on a privately owned 175-acre tract. The owner wanted the mounds, forests, and natural beauty of his land preserved. He contacted the Miami Conservancy District, and their Property Manager, Bob Riemmlin, arranged for the purchase in 1973.\n\nCarlisle Fort was in the headlines in early 1990 concerning the installation of a 36-inch natural gas pipeline from Indiana to Lebanon, Ohio, by the American Natural Resources Pipeline Company. The Miami Valley Council of Native Americans made claims that the pipeline would interfere with the Indian burying sites. An agreement was made to install the pipeline at least 600 feet outside the Carlisle Fort border. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places concerning its safekeeping for future generations and further study.\n\nIn the early 1960’s two organizations of garden clubs, representing their combined membership of nearly 2,000, worked together to identify a community need and formalized their vision “to create a place that would bring people and plants together.” By 1963 they shared these plans with City of Dayton Commissioners who gave approval for a horticultural complex to be built beside the Stillwater River in DeWeese Park.\n\nThe first master plan included greenhouses, an activity center building, flower conservatory, and formal gardens. Construction began on the greenhouses – funded by the City and which they continue to manage today. At the same time those 2,000 garden club members began fund raising events for the garden center activity building, and during that time Mr. Benjamin Wegerzyn, philanthropist, and lover of Dayton and gardening, donated Xerox stock valued at $375,000 to the City for this structure. The garden clubs’ efforts after five years amounted to $125,000. Collectively they had $500,000 to begin construction for the center. On October 31, 1973 this garden center activity building was opened and dedicated to the people of Dayton.\n\nThe next sixteen years were full of growth in programming, including the introduction of the community gardens in 1978, but funding was the heavy dark cloud which hung over the center. During these years there were two approaches made to the Montgomery County Park District to “take Wegerzyn in” but in both instances the timing was not good. Mr. George Cooper, who had retired as director of the City’s Human Resources department, was able to arrange that the City incur the expenses for the maintenance of the building and the utility costs. The trade off was to give away half of the building to construct the Riverbend Art Center to the west and the Dayton Playhouse on the east, creating the Cultural Arts Complex at DeWeese Park. These structures opened in September 1987. The reduction of the size of the auditorium resulted in the need to move one of the Center’s funding events, bingo, to an off-site location.\n\nJackie (Simms) McArdle, who had been a trustee for three years, was hired as director in 1986, and her objectives were huge. The board wanted formal gardens. In the next 30 months Phase I was completed – the garden green and the north and south plaza. Then in 1988 the foundation began their first capital campaign and over three years raised enough funds to continue the development of the gardens. The Arbor (former Rose) garden and reception lawn were Phase II and the period gardens, Federal, English, and Victorian were Phase III.\n\nBingo continued to be a huge money maker and investing in CD’s at that time allowed those funds to grow rapidly, but upon the recommendation of outside agencies the time came to separate the Wegerzyn Center from this activity. Staff was reduced down to 5 members and the future was bleak. Jackie approached the Park District for the third time, which turned out to be a good time – at last. Although the first levy failed, in November of 1994 the levy passed. Officially, on January 1, 1995 Wegerzyn became part of the park district’s family, including those last five staff employees. The Foundation was relieved of financing and overseeing the staff and could concentrate on fundraising for future development."
