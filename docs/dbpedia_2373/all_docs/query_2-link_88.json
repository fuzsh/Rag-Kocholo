        "text": "This post was written in partnership with Ohio. Find It Here. and the Dayton Convention & Visitors Bureau.\n\nThe Airplane. The cash register. The electric car starter. The pop-top can. The ice cube tray. What do you all of those things have in common? If you guessed that Daytonians invented them, you would be correct! Did you know at the turn of the 20th century that Dayton became the United States’ invention capital, with the most patents per capita?\n\nWhen Ohio. Find It Here. and Dayton Convention & Visitors Bureau invited us to spend the day exploring Dayton, I had no idea all that we would discover. About an hour west of Columbus, Dayton is full of attractions for all ages, both indoors and out.\n\nDuring our day trip, we visited the oldest and largest military aviation museum in the world, which happens to be the most-visited FREE attraction in the state. Explored a 65-acre open-air history museum, which is home to the only airplane designated as a National Historic Landmark. Stepped foot in the building where the Wright brothers had a bicycle business from 1895 – 1897. Enjoyed a delicious picnic at a gorgeous park, where we found out that Dayton is home to the nation’s LARGEST network of paved trails at 350+ miles!!\n\nFun Fact: Martin Sheen, Allison Janney, Erma Bombeck, Jonathon Winters, Rob Lowe, Mike Schmidt, Phil Donahue are a few famous Daytonians.\n\nNational Museum of the U.S. Air Force\n\nDid you Dayton is home to the oldest and largest military aviation museum in the world? How lucky are we to have such a place in Ohio! The National Museum of the United States Air Force is an incredible space that collects, researches, conserves, interprets, and presents the Air Force’s history, heritage, traditions, and today’s mission to fly, fight and win … in Air, Space, and Cyberspace.\n\nThere is so much to explore; you could almost spend a few days visiting. The museum has four hangars and 19 acres of enclosed exhibit space featuring over 360 aerospace vehicles and missiles on display. You’ll also discover thousands of historical items, as well as many interactive displays. You can learn more about each of the exhibit areas here.\n\nAs soon as we walked into the first hanger, Riley’s jaw dropped. We live in an area that plans frequently fly over our house, and we had been telling them for a few days that they were going to see even more planes. I guess she didn’t know just what to expect. She was SO EXCITED. Every time we went around a corner, she would act as if it was the first time ever seeing a plane.\n\nI think the Memphis Belle was one of my husband’s favorite planes to see. The Memphis Belle, located in the museum’s World War II Gallery, was placed there on May 17, 2018, exactly 75 years after its crew finished their last mission in the war against Nazi Germany on May 17, 1943. Like many other planes, it is surrounded by an interactive display with rare film footage and several personal artifacts that had never been seen before!\n\nIt was unreal to see these planes up close. You could feel the stories and history oozing out of them.\n\nTypically, there are walk-through aircraft, sit-in cockpits, space shuttle simulators, and a few other interactive exhibits, including the option to board and tour four of nine Presidential Airplanes( including the plane (SAM26000) that flew J.F.K.’s body back from Dallas). However, they are temporarily closed during their first phase of re-opening. Don’t worry. There is still more than enough to explore!\n\nThis museum is incredible, an unbelievable collection of aircraft and historical items presented in such a beautiful way. The combination of artifacts, memorabilia, and uniforms tell a story of the US Air Force that you just can’t get anywhere else.\n\nLocated on-site is the National Aviation Hall of Fame. Unfortunately, we weren’t able to visit this trip as it opened up later in the day after we had already left. The National Aviation Hall of Fame was founded in 1962, dedicated to honoring individuals who have uniquely contributed to America’s rich legacy of aviation achievement—achievement generated by American ingenuity and individual acts of great vision, persistence, skill, and courage. You can read more here. Keep in mind their hours/days open are different from the National Museum of the United States Air Force.\n\nBefore you head back to your car, make sure you take the time to walk around Memorial Park. The park honors Air Force-associated units and people for their courageous service and sacrifice in the cause of freedom. There are more than 500 memorials, including statuary memorials, plaques, trees, and benches.\n\nLet’s talk safety\n\nIf you’re like me, you probably haven’t ventured out much, and if you did, it was perhaps outdoors. Visiting the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force was our first indoor trip with the girls in months. January was probably the last time that we took them somewhere indoors. The reason we felt confident in visiting the Museum is because of how open and large it is! It is actually the world’s largest military aviation museum. A lot of the doors are automatic, meaning we really didn’t touch any surfaces. We had zero problems maintaining six feet from those outside of our party while on the museum campus. I am not sure we even got within 20 feet of anyone. They do require face coverings for all staff, volunteers, and visitors (3 years and older). You can bring your own, or they will provide a free paper mask if you forget. Throughout the Museum, you will see hand sanitizers available for use.\n\nCheck out this video with detailed information about changes made for reopening the museum. You can also take a virtual tour here to familiarize yourself with the museum.\n\nThings to Know\n\nFREE admission and FREE parking\n\nFREE stroller rentals\n\nOpen 7 days a week, 9AM – 5PM. The museum will be open until 8 p.m. the first Thursday of each month between August-December 2020.\n\nAddress: Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, 1100 Spaatz St. Gate 28B WPAFB OH 45433\n\nWebsite | Facebook\n\nCarillon Historical Park\n\nCarillon Historical Park is a 65-acre open-air history museum that serves as the main campus for Dayton History. There is so much to see and do as you explore the amazing stories of how Dayton changed the world.\n\nAfter spending all morning at The National Museum of the United States Air Force, we were pretty hungry. We decided before exploring all that Carillon Park offers, we were going to grab a bite to eat. Lucky for us, Carillon Park provides two places to dine at – Carillon Brewing Co. and Culp’s Cafe. Both offer a historical story.\n\nCarillon Brewing Co. offers visitors a glimpse into 1850s-era Dayton through the authentically prepared food and drink of the times. It is the nation’s only production brewery in a museum, and the only U.S. brewery replicating the historic brewing process. The Culp’s story dates back to 1902, when Charlotte Gilbert Culp, a young West Dayton widow, began preparing baked goods for her six children to sell door-to-door. Soon, the Culp family opened a stand at the South Main Street Market before Charlotte’s eldest son, Howard, expanded the business into the Arcade—selling poultry, eggs, cheese, and dill pickles at three lunch counters. In the 1930s, the Culps opened a full Arcade cafeteria; by the 1940s, they were serving as many as 5,000 customers a day. While Culp’s was sold in 1960, the spirit of this family-owned restaurant lives on at Carillon Historical Park.\n\n– daytonhistory.org\n\nWe chose Culp’s Cafe because we felt it was kid-friendly, and they had the option of an outdoor patio. When we arrived for lunch, we found out that eating outdoors was not an option as it was raining a bit. The last time we ate indoors at a restaurant was in February! We decided to go ahead and eat indoors and were impressed by their procedures. Everyone was wearing a mask, including us, unless we were standing up. They were regularly cleaning and the tables were decently spaced with ours being right at the front. I did go the extra step and had plastic mats to put on the table for the girls.\n\nWe enjoyed our lunch. It was classic cafe food, intending to pay homage to the small soda fountains and lunch counters found throughout Dayton in the early nineteen hundreds. Stephen chose a delicious club & milkshake, while I decided on a parmesan-crusted grilled cheese like the adult that I am! You can view their menu here.\n\nWhile we spent a great deal of time outdoors, they do have an incredible indoor part, which is the first stop for all admissions and information. It houses exhibits, the Iams Education Room, administrative offices, and the Museum Store (which is a must-visit!). The exhibits feature an NCR cash register room with 90 Dayton-made machines, the Build for Tomorrow animatronic theater, the original Deeds Barn, dozens of exhibits featuring Dayton factories and companies, and the Carousel of Dayton Innovation.\n\nThe Carousel is a full-scale, hand-carved Carousel featuring one-of-a-kind characters such as Orville Wright’s dog, a Dayton soapbox derby car, and a soda can with the Dayton-made pop top.\n\nOnce you’re done grabbing lunch and exploring the indoor area, you’re in for a real treat when you step foot outside. There are several historical buildings that you can go inside. You’ll also come across the old river park swimming pool light tower, a transportation center that houses most of the parks historic public transportation collection, the Morrison Iron Bridge, a 100-foot tall climbing tower, a simulated archaeological dig site, and many other interactive experiences.\n\nClick here to view a park map.\n\nOn-site is the Wright Brothers National Museum. The museum has more Wright artifacts on display than any other place in the world. One of the must-see artifacts is the 1905 Wright Flyer III (pictured below). It is the only airplane designated as a National Historic Landmark and the first practical flying machine. The Wright brothers considered this plane their most important aircraft.\n\nCarillon Park is perfect for all ages! The girls loved running around and exploring all the nooks and crannies of the buildings.\n\nLet’s talk safety\n\nJust like the other places we visited, masks are required inside of all the Carillon Park buildings. While inside, we saw all employees wearing masks, as well as employees frequently cleaning handles/railings/all things that would be considered high touch areas. Throughout the park, both indoors and outdoors, you could see the efforts they put into creating an environment where social distancing was easily followed. For example, they have turned areas that might have been open for all directions into a one-way area – either by sign or by stanchion (aka fancy velvet rope/retractable belt).\n\nThings to Know\n\nFREE Parking\n\nHours: Mon – Sat: 9:30am – 5:00pm\n\nSun: 12:00pm – 5:00pm\n\nCost: $12 per adult (ages 18–59), $10 per senior, $8 per child (3–17), children under 3 and Dayton History members FREE\n\nAddress: 1000 Carillon Blvd., Dayton, OH 45409\n\nTwo Restaurants on Site:\n\nCarillon Brewery and Culps Cafe\n\nWebsite | Facebook\n\nDayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park\n\nDayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park is a United States National Historical Park that commemorates the lives and achievements of Wilbur Wright, Orville Wright, and Paul Laurence Dunbar. Within the park, you’ll find an evolving story of two ingenious brothers and one of America’s greatest African-American poets.\n\nThere are five National Historic Landmarks and a National Register Historic District located within Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park. These include the Wright Cycle Company building, Hoover Block, Huffman Prairie Flying Field, 1905 Wright Flyer III, Hawthorn Hill, and the Paul Laurence Dunbar State Memorial.\n\nRight now, the Wright-Dunbar Interpretive Center and Wright Cycle Company are the two open buildings. Thanks to a friendly ranger, we were able to get a quick tour of the Wright Cycle Company. He was funny and very knowledgeable. We learned that this was home to the Wright brothers’ bicycle business from 1985 – 1897. It was interesting to hear that this building was where they designed and constructed their gliders and first airplane, the Wright Flyer. It was surreal being in the same spot where many incredibly brilliant things happened, and while the museum was small in size, it didn’t lack in history or information!\n\nWhile the park consists of multiple sites, some are closed right now.

It is part of the Five Rivers Metropark and is absolutely gorgeous. Beautiful flowers and well-maintained landscaping lined the streets, hanging baskets surrounded the lights, and it doesn’t hurt it is against a backdrop of sweeping views of the Great Miami River.\n\nDue to the times, it was decently quiet – but I can see how vibrant and full of life it would be during a typical summer month. Online I read it is home to festivals of all sorts, live music, food trucks, an interactive fountain for the kids, workout classes, and so much more. Oh, and in the wintertime? I hear there is an epic ice skating rink! For now, it was the perfect place to relax, picnic, and take in the gorgeous scenery.\n\nThe first thing we did when we got to the park was find the perfect spot to picnic. There were signs around the park requesting that we refrain from using the shelters, picnic tables, benches, handrails, and handles due to CDC precautions related to COVID-19. That wasn’t a problem for us because we were prepared with a blanket!\n\nWe grabbed dinner before we got to the park at The Troll Pub, which has a great deal of important Dayton history within its walls. The building was first built in 1868 to become the Weustoff & Getz factory and was eventually used as Dayton’s first automobile manufacturer that began delivering cars. You can read more about the history and how they pay homage to the Wheelhouse Building here.\n\nWhile we didn’t dine in, it looked like they were doing a fantastic job creating a safe environment. There were markings on the ground to help people stay 6 feet apart, the patio was a great size with the tables adequately separated and employees were wearing masks. If two of the girls weren’t asleep and we planned better, I would have felt completely safe dining on their patio!\n\nThe day started pretty cold and a bit rainy, but by the time we got to the park for our dinner picnic – the weather was absolutely perfect.\n\nA bonus to the park is The Dayton Inventors River Walk. It is a unique way to learn about and celebrate Dayton’s history of invention. On the walk, you will find seven over-sized sculptures, called Invention Stations. You will also walk along more than 150 brick tiles commemorating innovations dreamed up right in the Miami Valley. This was a great reminder of what creativity, curiosity, and perseverance can do for the world.\n\nYou can learn more about the INVENTION STATIONS here.\n\nFun Fact: Did you know Dayton boasts the nation’s LARGEST network of paved trails – 350+ miles!? It is an incredible space for biking, hiking, or stroller-pushing adventures.\n\nThis was the perfect way to end our day exploring Dayton.\n\nWhile we missed out on this visit, a focal point of RiverScape MetroPark is the Five Rivers Fountain of Lights! It is a series of five fountains that shoot water about 200 feet high and 400 feet across at the confluence of the Great Miami and Mad Rivers, making it one of the world’s largest fountains!
