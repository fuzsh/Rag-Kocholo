The pass can be checked out with a patron’s Library card for three weeks at a time, but the passes are not able to be automatically renewed.\n\nThe passes are not valid for discounts on items in Carillon’s museum store or for food purchases. Normal ride fees will apply for the Carousel of Dayton Innovation ($1 per person) and the Carillon Park Railroad ($5 per person per ride).\n\nStop by any Branch’s Ask Me Desk for more information or visit DML’s online catalog, search for Dayton History Membership Pass, and place a hold for pick up.\n\nAdditionally, DML also offers patrons the opportunity to check out Dayton Art Institute Member Cards, which offer entrance into DAI. Those passes can also be checked out for three weeks (cannot be renewed), and are good for admittance for two adults and up to four children.
