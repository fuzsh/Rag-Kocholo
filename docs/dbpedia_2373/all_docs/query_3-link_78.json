        "text": "Join the WSU Retirees Association on a guided tour of Dayton’s Carillon Historical Park on Tuesday, June 11, beginning at 10:30 a.m. Admission is $12 for visitors aged 60 and over and $14 for visitors under age 60. You may pay at the time of admission.\n\nOur tour guide will be Tom Thickel, former president of Levin Porter Architects Inc. The plan is to gather in the theater for a quick orientation and to view the animatronic program and then head out to the park. We will make stops for interpretation at the School House, Newcom Tavern, The Print Shop, the Transportation Center, and the Wright Brothers National Museum. For an additional $5, participants may ride the train.\n\nFree parking is available in the park, which is located off South Patterson Boulevard in south Dayton. So we can give the park a head count, please RSVP by Thursday, June 6, by emailing wsura@wright.edu. Please put Carillon in the subject line of your email.\n\nFollowing our tour of the park, all participants are invited to join us for lunch at Jimmie's Ladder 11, at 936 Brown St.\n\nAccessibility: All but two of the buildings in the historical park are easily accessible. Each of those two buildings only has one step to enter. Manual wheelchairs are offered for use on-site, free of charge, based on availability. Due to the historic nature of some of the buildings at Carillon Historical Park, wheelchair access may not be available in some instances.\n\nAbout Carillon Historical Park\n\nCarillon Historical Park is a 65-acre open-air history museum that serves as the main campus for Dayton History. The Park is comprised of historic buildings and exhibits concerning the history of technology and the history of Dayton and its residents from 1796 to the present. The major sections include settlement, transportation, invention and industry. Historical elements of the park were the brainchild of Colonel Edward Deeds."
