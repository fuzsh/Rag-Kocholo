        "text": "Bird watching. People watching. Breath-taking skyline views. That's River Walk in the heart of downtown Dayton. The nearly 1.25-mile loop follows levee tops on the south side of the river from Main Street to the Monument Avenue Bridge, across the bridge to Riverview Avenue, then back over the Main Street Bridge. River Walk users can begin their loop at several different points. They also can view Five Rivers MetroParks' River Run whitewater paddling feature from both river banks and from the Monument Avenue Bridge.\n\nThe south part of River Walk is a shady, bench-lined, crushed gravel path. Part of the walkway is cantilevered over the Great Miami River Bike Trail. Stairs and ramps connect North Wilkinson Street, River Walk on top of the levee, RiversEdge Amphitheater and the Great Miami River Recreation Trail.\n\nThe north part of River Walk features a sunny path along the top of the right bank (north) levee and includes two swings. Views of the downtown skyline are impressive from this part of the walk, as is the view north into the McPherson Town Historic District. Stairs and ramps connect Riverview Avenue, River Walk on top of the levee and the Great Miami River Bike Trail.\n\nThe River Walk features enough lighting to illuminate an evening walk.\n\nThe Dayton YMCA\n\nThe YMCA of Greater Dayton has been serving the Miami Valley since 1858, building a healthy spirit, mind and body for all. After out-growing several buildings in Dayton, the Central Branch of the Dayton YMCA opened at 316 N. Wilkinson Street on September 8, 1929. The $1.3 million facility had 13 classrooms, 4 laboratories, facilities for up to 1,000 students, a swimming pool, chapel, library, handball courts, three gymnasiums, 245 residence rooms, a cafeteria, and an auditorium with seating for 450. Today, this facility remains a thriving part of downtown Dayton. Information courtesy of YMCA.\n\nMcPherson Town Historic District\n\nWith its bike-friendliness to adjacent river bikeways, walkability to nearby places like the Dayton Dragons games, Schuster Center art performances, and festivals, McPherson Town Historic District is one of Dayton's most livable neighborhoods. The neighborhood was founded in 1845. The homes are primarily Queen Anne and Eastlake styles.\n\nThe 1913 Flood hit the neighborhood hard, with about 15 feet of water. The Miami Conservancy District dams and levees have protected the nearly 100 structures in the neighborhood ever since. After World War II,, the flight to the suburbs led to a period of decline. But renewal began slowly in the 1970s. Today, more than 90 percent of the neighborhood buildings have been renovated at least once, sometimes more. Information courtesy of McPherson Town.\n\nDayton Art Institute\n\nFounded in 1919, The Dayton Art Institute is one of the region's premier fine arts museums.\n\nIn addition to exhibiting outstanding special exhibitions and impressive collections of art from throughout the world, the museum is renowned for education programming that includes an array of offerings for diverse audiences.\n\nThe Dayton Art Institute sits atop a hill on the edge of the Great Miami River overlooking downtown Dayton. The museum's founding patrons included prominent community leaders such as Orville Wright and the Pattersons of NCR. The museum's landmark building, designed by prominent museum architect Edward B. Green of Buffalo and completed in 1930, was modeled after the Villa d‚ÄôEste near Rome and the Villa Farnese at Caprarola in Italy, both examples of sixteenth century Italian Renaissance architecture. Today, The Dayton Art Institute's architecturally and historically significant facility is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nThe museum's collection spans 5,000 years of art history, including important Oceanic art, Asian art, European art, and American fine and decorative art collections. Information courtesy of the Dayton Art Institute.\n\nSoldiers' Monument\n\nPrivate George Washington Fair stands atop of the Soldiers‚Äô Monument on Main Street. His likeness was not the first choice, according to Dayton historian Curt Dalton.\n\nThe original accepted design was of a figure representing the Goddess of Liberty. Ex-Civil War soldiers protested vehemently, however, and passed a resolution requesting the goddess be substituted by a Union private soldier. George Washington Fair, a 6-foot, 200-pound bricklayer and an ex-Union soldier, served as the model.\n\nThe Soldiers Monument was unveiled on July 31, 1884. A crowd of 100,000 people, one of the city's largest at a time when Dayton's population was reported to be 40,000, crowded in for the dedication on July 31, 1884.\n\nPvt. Fair died Jan. 21, 1888 and is buried at Woodland Cemetery.\n\nThe original marble statue, damaged by decades of weather, now stands under cover at the entrance of the Dayton VA Medical Center. The soldier we see looking over Main Street today was recast in bronze in 1991. Information and photo courtesy Dayton Daily News.\n\nRiverRun\n\nRiver Run opens the downtown river to a beautiful 7-mile paddle from Eastwood MetroPark on the Mad River through downtown to Carillon Historical Park and the University of Dayton area.\n\nTwo structures span the river, each with passageways: One smooth-water passageway for novice paddlers and one whitewater play feature for more experienced paddlers. River Run also allows people to fish, sunbathe and enjoy the river downtown in new ways. Information courtesy Five Rivers MetroParks.\n\nRiver Run Mural\n\nIn 2015, the Miami Conservancy District and its partners, State of Ohio, Downtown Dayton Partnership, Five Rivers MetroParks, CareSource, and Cox Media Group, joined forces to beautify the floodwall across the Great Miami River from RiverScape MetroPark. The result is a 16-foot tall by 1,000-foot long painted mural, designed by local artist Amy Deal and painted by local art education organization K-12 Gallery & TEJAS.\n\nThe mural design skillfully draws on colors from the surrounding landscape to underscore what is special about this place. While featuring people enjoying outdoor recreation activities and diverse wildlife, the mural also includes geometric references to water's movement, bicycle spokes, and the frame of a Wright Brothers' biplane.\n\nThe mural is painted on a Miami Conservancy District's floodwall that has protected the neighborhood from flooding since 1922. Now, the wall continues to provide protection but serves as a beautiful addition to RiverScape, downtown Dayton and the view.\n\nFirst Baptist Church\n\nFirst Baptist Church was founded on May 29, 1824, just 19 years after the city's incorporation. By the late 19th century, the Sunday School had more than 700 members.\n\nThe church broke ground for a new building just three months before the Great 1913 Flood that swept over the city, killing 360 people. The flood swamped the standing First Baptist building with 9 feet of water, as well as the foundation for the new church. But once the floodwaters receded, the church pressed on and resumed construction. The cornerstone was laid on May 31, 1914. On June 26, 1915 the magnificent Gothic structure opened its doors."
