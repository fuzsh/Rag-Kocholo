        "text": "DAYTON, Ohio â Since 1950, Carillon Historical Park has been sharing stories of how Dayton changed the world.\n\nOn any given day throughout the 65-acre campus, youâll find tour guides dressed in period costumes, exhibits showcasing life in Southwest Ohio, and for the past year, a special railroad that gives visitors another view of the park.\n\nItâs a ride you donât want to miss.\n\nBut if you do, donât worry, another will be along in twenty minutes.\n\nâWelcome aboard! Wherever you want to sit, weâll open the door for ya,â said train engineer Mike Griffieth.\n\nâIâm the train conductor, so Iâm the one who seats them where they want to sit and we enjoy having their story told while we tell them our story,â added conductor Mark Horwitz.\n\nPark President and CEO Brady Kress has dedicated the past twenty years to Carillon Historical Park.\n\nâThe train itself is a full-sized reproduction of a small model that our founder Edward A. Deeds had created in 1953,â he said.\n\nThe train provides different views of the park that guests havenât been able to see for 70 years.\n\nâWhatâs nice about the entire railroad is that weâve been able to create a mile loop around the historic campus and provide these sort of grand circle tour of Carillon Park for the first time. Theyâre pleasantly surprised when they see a full-sized train that can carry 120 people. You can bring the whole family in here. Itâs wheelchair accessible,â said Kress.\n\nOver its first year, itâs been a good ride.\n\nâItâs very popular, very well-received. Certainly, spring break week was really popular for us. Over this past Christmas, we have a five-week Carillon Christmas celebration. Weâre open every night. We had over 27,000 riders during that event,â Kress said.\n\nFor Kress, itâs another way to share stories of Dayton and its place in history.\n\nâWe donât want people to leave without knowing what a fantastic region this is in Ohio and how we changed so many things around the world from right here in Dayton,â he said.\n\nCarillon Historical Park is open Monday through Saturday from 9:30 a.m.-5 p.m. and Sunday from noon-5 p.m..\n\nTrain rides are $5 plus the price of admission."
