        "text": "Two brothers whose ingenuity and determination forever changed the course of history; Wilbur & Orville Wright. Raised in Dayton, Ohio, these visionary pioneers not only invented the world's first successful powered aircraft, but also paved the way for modern aviation as we know it today. As Destination Dayton continues to celebrate its 30th anniversary, join us as we uncover 30 fascinating facts about the Wright Brothers, from their humble beginnings and groundbreaking achievements to their enduring legacy in aviation and beyond.\n\n1. The Wright brothers were raised and lived most of their lives in Dayton.\n\nWilbur was born near Millville, Indiana in April 1867, and Orville was born in Dayton in August 1871. The family briefly moved to Richmond, Indiana in 1881, before returning to Dayton in 1884. The brothers would then spend the remainder of their lives in Dayton.\n\n2. On December 17, 1903 the Wright brothers achieved the first powered, sustained and controlled airplane flight.\n\nPictured: The First Flight\n\n3. Thanks to a coin toss, Orville was the first brother airborne!\n\nWilbur won the toss, but his first attempt failed. Orville went second and managed to fly for 12 seconds. Later that day, Wilbur flew their plane for 59 seconds, over a distance of 852 feet.\n\n4. A toy launched their flying obsession.\n\nIn 1878, when Wilbur was 11 and Orville 7, their father presented them with a toy resembling a helicopter. This toy, inspired by Alphonse Pénaud's design, was crafted from paper, bamboo and cork, featuring a motor twirled by a rubber band. The brothers would later attribute their enduring fascination with flying machines to this early childhood toy.\n\n5. Neither brother ever married.\n\nThe close-knit brothers, born four years apart, were deeply committed to their work. Wilbur once remarked to reporters that he couldn't spare time for both a wife and an airplane.\n\n6. Neither brother ever attended college nor received a high school diploma.\n\nWilbur completed high school in Richmond, Indiana, but the family relocated to Dayton, Ohio, before he could receive his diploma. Both brothers attended Dayton's Central High School but, Orville, known for his intellectual curiosity, dropped out of high school before his senior year to start a printing business.\n\nPictured: The young brothers\n\n7. The brothers once printed a daily newspaper together.\n\nWilbur joined Orville in their printing business, and in 1889, the brothers started publishing a weekly newspaper called the West Side News. The following year, they ventured into publishing a short-lived daily newspaper known as The Evening Item. The brothers even went as far as designing and building their own printing presses! In 1892 they changed businesses and opened a successful bicycle repair and sales shop, the Wright Cycle Company, that financed their flying experiments.\n\n8. The Wright Flyer I cost about $1000 to build and the Wright brothers financed it entirely by themselves.\n\nThe framework, constructed from spruce, featured twin \"pusher\" propellers and a specially crafted engine predominantly cast from lightweight aluminum. This groundbreaking design marked the birth of the first controlled and powered flying machine capable of carrying human passengers, laying the foundation for the modern airplane as we know it today!\n\n9. After the first day airborne, the 1903 Wright Flyer never flew again.\n\nOn December 17, 1903, the Wright Flyer made four historic flights. As Orville and Wilbur discussed their final flight of the day, a sudden gust of wind caught the aircraft, causing it to flip several times. This unexpected event resulted in severe damage to the ribs, motor, and chain guides, rendering the Wright Flyer irreparable. The aircraft was crated and returned to Dayton, never to take flight again.\n\n10. The Wright brothers established the world’s first test flight facilities here in Dayton.\n\nThe Wright brothers built their first wind tunnel in the fall of 1901 to test airfoil designs and wing shapes for their airplane. The tunnel's blower fan was powered by an overhead belt and could produce winds of 25 to 35 miles per hour. The brothers used the wind tunnel to compare the results of their experiments to those they'd gathered from kite and glider flights. The aerodynamic data they collected from these tests was critical to the successful design of their 1903 Kitty Hawk airplane. Aerospace research continues today in Dayton at WPAFB’s Air Force Research Labs among other locations. Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and the Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park are just a few of the Wright brothers' continuing legacies in Dayton today.\n\nPictured: The Wright-Dunbar Interpretive Center, part of the Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park\n\n11. The Wright Brothers flew together just one time.\n\nOrville and Wilbur had made a solemn promise to their father, who feared the risks of flying, that they would never fly together. However, a singular exception was granted on May 25, 1910, when their father agreed to allow them a brief six-minute flight near Dayton, with Orville at the controls and Wilbur as the passenger. Following their landing, Orville took his 82-year-old father on his inaugural flight experience. As the aircraft ascended, his exhilarated father joyfully urged, \"Higher, Orville, higher!\"\n\n12. Neil Armstrong carried a piece of the Wright Flyer with him to the moon.\n\nWhen Neil Armstrong, another Ohio pioneer in aviation, became the first person to set foot on the moon in July 1969, he carried with him a significant piece of history: a fragment of muslin fabric from the left wing of the original 1903 Wright Flyer, as well as a piece of wood from the airplane's left propeller. In less than 66 years, man had gone from the first powered flight to walking on the moon!\n\n13. Fabric Swatch From Wright Brothers' Original 1903 Flyer Flew on Mars in 2021 on NASA Ingenuity Helicopter\n\nIn addition to the moon, the Wright brothers' legacy continues on Mars. NASA’s Mars helicopter, Ingenuity, carried a small piece of fabric from the Wright brothers’ 1903 Flyer (donated to NASA by Carillon Historical Park in Dayton, Ohio). In honor of the first airplane to fly on Earth, on April 19, 2021, three days after Wilbur Wright’s 154th birthday, the Ingenuity helicopter, carrying the swatch of fabric from the original Wright Flyer plane, lifted off on Mars.\n\n14. For decades, Orville refused to donate the Wright Flyer to the Smithsonian Institution.\n\nOrville Wright's reluctance to donate the 1903 Wright Flyer to the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum stemmed from the institution's efforts to favorably portray Samuel Langley's unsuccessful experiments with the Langley Aerodrome, just days before the Wright brothers achieved their historic flight. This led to a dispute where Orville loaned the Flyer to the London Science Museum in 1925 to correct what he saw as a misrepresentation of aviation history. It wasn't until the 1940s, after the Smithsonian admitted its errors regarding Langley's attempts, that Orville finally agreed to donate the Flyer. It arrived at the Smithsonian in 1948, nearly a year after Orville's passing.\n\nPictured: Propeller from Wright Flyer now housed at the Smithsonian\n\n15. Orville was involved in the first fatal aviation accident.\n\nAfter their 1903 success, the Wright brothers continued developing aircraft, including the Wright Military Flyer marketed to the U.S. Army. During a demonstration flight at Fort Myer, Virginia, on September 17, 1908, with Army Lieutenant Thomas Selfridge as a passenger, the aircraft's propeller broke apart mid-flight. The plane crashed, fatally injuring Selfridge and leaving Orville Wright hospitalized with severe injuries, including a broken leg, ribs, and lasting back problems.\n\n16. In December 1892 they opened their first bicycle sales and repair shop.\n\nThe brothers launched a bicycle repair shop to capitalize on the booming national bicycle craze. Innovating beyond repairs, they crafted their own bicycles, featuring cutting-edge advancements such as an oil-retaining wheel hub and coaster brakes—innovations still integral to many modern bikes. The success of their bicycle business provided the financial backing crucial for their pioneering efforts in inventing the world's first powered, manned, heavier-than-air aircraft capable of controlled flight.\n\n17. National Aviation Day honors the Wright brothers.\n\nNational Aviation Day, celebrated annually on August 19, holds special significance as it coincides with Orville Wright's birthday. This day commemorates Orville's pivotal contributions to aviation history and honors his groundbreaking achievements alongside his brother Wilbur. It serves as a reminder of their innovative spirit and enduring legacy, inspiring generations to dream, explore and push the boundaries of flight.\n\nPictured: Wright Brothers Bench at Carillon Historical Park\n\n18. None of the Wright children were given middle names.\n\nIn a departure from the norm, none of the Wright children were bestowed with middle names. Instead, their father, Milton Wright, opted for distinctive first names inspired by admired clergyman: Wilbur after Wilbur Fiske and Orville after Orville Dewey. Among family and friends, Wilbur and Orville were affectionately known as \"Will\" and \"Orv,\" and they referred to each other as \"Ullam\" and \"Bubs.\" Locally in Dayton, where they grew up as the \"Bishop's kids,\" this nickname underscored their upbringing in a respected household.\n\n19. Wilbur Wright died at the age of 45 from typhoid fever.\n\nWhile managing his business and legal affairs, Wilbur contracted typhoid fever in early May 1912, likely from consuming contaminated oysters. His condition worsened over the month, and he passed away on May 30.\n\n20. In 1906 the brothers received a patent for their “flying machine”.\n\nThe Wright brothers initially applied for a patent before their first powered flight on December 17, 1903. Following the rejection of their initial application, they sought the expertise of a patent lawyer who refined their application. Finally, on May 22, 1906, they were granted U.S. patent number 821,393. This patent protected their innovative system of aerodynamic control, which allowed for the manipulation of surfaces on a flying machine—a pivotal achievement in the history of aviation.\n\n21. In 1909 the Wrights were awarded the Congressional Medal for their contribution to the world with their flying machine.\n\nWilbur and Orville Wright received Congressional Medals during a poignant ceremony at the Montgomery County Fairgrounds on June 18, 1909. The medals were presented by General James Allen, Chief Signal Officer, and Lt. Frank P. Lahm of the United States Army Signal Corps. The event marked their triumphant return to Dayton, celebrating their pioneering achievements in aviation. School children dressed in red, white and blue filled the grandstands, forming a living representation of the American flag, underscoring the brothers' profound impact on American history and their status as national heroes.\n\nPictured; The Wright Brothers receiving their Congressional Medals\n\n22. In 1915 Orville sold the Wright Company and his patents to a group of investors in New York.\n\nIn October 1915, Orville sold the Wright Company to a consortium of investors for approximately $1.5 million. The following year, it merged with the Glenn L. Martin Company, forming the Wright-Martin Company. By then, 12 years after achieving the world's first controlled, powered flight, Orville had distanced himself from the business, preferring to spend his time quietly tinkering at his home in Dayton.\n\n23. In 1920 President Woodrow Wilson appointed Orville to the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics.\n\nThe predecessor of NASA, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), was established in 1915 with the goal of serving as an advisory body to coordinate aeronautical research conducted elsewhere. Orville Wright remained an engaged participant in NACA activities for the remainder of his life.\n\n24. The original Wright Flyer III can be seen at the Wright Brothers National Museum at Carillon Historical Park.\n\nThe 1905 Wright Flyer III is the only airplane designated a National Historic Landmark, and the Wright brothers considered it their most important aircraft. Known as \"the first pilot’s final endeavor,\" Orville Wright's dedication to preserving the 1905 Wright Flyer III for Carillon Historical Park marked his last significant project before his passing on January 30, 1948. Although Orville did not live to see the park's opening in 1950, he played a pivotal role in designing Wright Hall, the structure that now proudly showcases the historic aircraft. The Wright Brothers National Museum at Carillon Historical Park features more Wright brothers' artifacts than anywhere else in the world.\n\nPictured: Wright Flyer III at Carillon Historical Park\n\n25. Both Orville and Wilbur are buried at Woodland Cemetery.\n\nThe monuments of Wilbur and Orville Wright, renowned as the inventors of powered flight, are among the most visited in Woodland Cemetery. Their graves are distinguished by three prominent flags, making them easily recognizable to visitors.\n\n26. The Wright's home (Hawthorn Hill) is open to the public in Dayton.\n\nHawthorn Hill, completed in 1914, served as the cherished home of Orville Wright, his sister Katharine, and their father Bishop Milton Wright. Following Orville's passing in 1948, the mansion was acquired by National Cash Register (NCR) and later gifted to the Wright Family Foundation in 2006 through the efforts of Congressman Mike Turner. Designated a part of the Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park in 2009, ownership was officially transferred to Dayton History in 2013. Now open to the public, Hawthorn Hill retains its historical significance, with NCR having meticulously preserved and documented Orville's original furnishings and décor.\n\nPictured: Hawthorn Hill\n\n27. The Wright Brothers National Museum has more Wright artifacts on display than any other place in the world!\n\nAt the Wright Brothers National Museum, located at Carillon Historical Park, visitors can explore a captivating collection showcasing Orville and Wilbur Wright's lives. Highlights include Orville's meticulously tailored tuxedo and specially adapted Stetson shoes made following his 1908 Fort Myer crash. The museum also features Orville's inventive side with a modified Victrola, offering a glimpse into his tinkering spirit. Of course, the centerpiece remains the iconic Wright Flyer III.\n\n28. Hawthorn Hill brought in famous visitors!\n\nOver its 34-year tenure as Orville Wright's residence, Hawthorn Hill hosted many esteemed guests, including Charles Lindbergh, Henry Ford and Thomas Edison. On June 22, 1927, Charles Lindbergh, fresh from his historic solo flight across the Atlantic, visited Orville Wright at Hawthorn Hill in Dayton. Though unable to make a public appearance due to his backers' request, Lindbergh and Wright briefly appeared on the balcony to greet fans gathered outside, who dispersed happily afterward.\n\n29. The Wright Cycle Shop is the only building remaining in Dayton as a testament to the bicycle business.\n\nThe Wright Cycle Company was housed in this fourth bicycle shop operated by the Wrights. This building also marks the pivotal shift from the Wrights' initial curiosity in flight to dedicated research and development. Designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1990, the Wright Cycle Company is situated adjacent to the Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park's Wright-Dunbar Interpretive Center in Dayton's Wright-Dunbar Historic District.\n\nPictured: The Wright Cycle Co.\n\n30. Dayton banker, Torrence Huffman, allowed the brothers to utilize his pasture for flight testing.\n\nToday, we know this field as Huffman Prairie Flying Field! Huffman Prairie is where Wilbur piloted the Wright Flyer III for a then-world record of over 24 miles in 39 minutes. It is located on Wright-Patterson Air Force base and was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1990.\n\nBONUS FACT: You can visit the Wright Brothers Memorial in Dayton!\n\nThe memorial sits atop Wright Brothers Hill, commanding a view over Huffman Prairie Flying Field. This historic site witnessed Wilbur and Orville's pioneering flight tests from 1904 to 1905, as well as the operation of the Wright School of Aviation's flying school from 1910 to 1916. Surrounding the plaza, a stone wall features a plaque listing the names of the 119 pilots trained at Huffman Prairie, commemorating their contributions to aviation history.\n\n2380 Memorial Road, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433\n\nPictured: Wright Brothers Memorial\n\n---"
