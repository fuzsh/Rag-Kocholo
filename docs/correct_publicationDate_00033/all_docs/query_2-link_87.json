He was born in 1947 and had written many books, most of which were science fiction and alternate history. He also wrote hilarious fantasy adventure stories. His works have appeared on the Locus Magazine, Wall Street Journal, New York Times and Washington Post bestseller lists. He once worked on a doctorate in history, but he left the program to join political activism. From that moment on until he reached 50, he supported himself in various jobs, including machinist, truck driver, and longshoreman and even as an organizer for the labor union.\n\nEric passed in July 2022.\n\nAfter winning a writing contest in 1993, his first book was published in 1997, and after that he became a full-time writer in 1999. One of his most notable works is ‘1632’, which is a series that tells us the story of freedom and justice-American style in 1632 northern Germany where things couldn’t get much worse. There was famine, disease, and religious war decimating the cities. It’s only the aristocrats who escaped relatively unscathed. For the peasants however, death was merciful.\n\nThe year is 2000 and things are going well in Grantville, West Virginia. Mike Stern has a sister getting married and everyone in attendance (including an entire local branch of a mine workers’ union) is having the time of their lives. But then everything changed and when the dust finally settles, Mike organizes a band of armed mining workers to investigate what happened. The men discover that the road leading into town has been cut, as if a sword has been used. And on the opposite side is a scene straight out of hell. A man has been nailed to the door of a farmhouse, and his spouse and daughter had been assaulted by men wearing steel vests.\n\nConfronted with this horror, Mike and the miners start shooting, and at that moment, they introduce freedom and justice, American style, just like it was during the Thirty Years’ War. In the book’s introduction, the author explained that aliens played around with space and time, and an alternate universe split off, and it was called Assiti Shards. This meant that the Twentieth Century people in West Virginia could shift the timeline. It’s a pleasant change from time travel stories where timelines don’t change. So you can think of this story as a weird alternate history novel.\n\nThe author has also done a good job on the historical research, and manages to capture the benefit of living in a little blue-collar West Virginian town. The book also brings out the reality of living during the 17th Century, especially with all the major political issues. We can also learn what it felt like to be the common man during the year 1632. The author also brings a realistic scenario all around, and we find people having real concerns, such as not being able to replace worn-out parts because the machine shops didn’t have the required tools. Perhaps the author could have toned down on the use of violence as a means of delivering justice, but overall, 1632 is a wonderful story.\n\nEric Flint has also written 1633, which is the second installment of the Assiti Shards series. The new Confederated Principalities of Europe (CPE)-an alliance between Gustavus, king of Sweden, and the West Virginia town, led by Mike Stearns, which was hurled back through time to the thirty years war – has big problems. While the greatest European maritime war is erupting, Cardinal Richelieu was busy creating an alliance to bring down the CPE and it’s only technology from America that can rescue Gustavas from being ruined.\n\n1633 is billed as American freedom and justice versus seventeenth century tyranny, and we Find mike Stearns trying to reform Europe by sweet reason. If the first novel was filled with adventure, then the second installment is more of a historical narration of events that happened in 17th Century Europe. At this time, the politics had become even more complicated, and things become more complex when American’s historical books are stolen. And Oliver Cromwell is arrested even before he has done any wrong simply because these history books say that he is going to start a rebellion within the not-too-distant future.\n\nOne thing that comes out when you read 1633 is two unmistakable voices. On the one hand you have the part that is historically oriented and on the hand you have the story of Mike Stearns being told. The author also brings to life his libertarian political leanings, and for someone who isn’t too interested in politics, that can be a bit much. But the author has done a good job in creating his alternative universe. He has also done a good job of fleshing out the characters, which was something that was lacking in the first book.\n\nPerhaps the author could have done a better job of shortening the dialogues because you have a situation where the characters are spending too much time explaining things to one another. Politics and foreign policy take center stage, and the author handles these issues in a superb manner. You find tension between the alliances because the displaced Americans are trying to incorporate their new allies in their democratic world while trying to allow them to maintain their monarchial way of life. We also find good guys finding themselves in a world at war, and they contrive to overcome the villains and save the day.\n\n1633 finds Eric Flint collaborating with David Weber and the end result is a good characterization and structure in the book. In the first novel, most characters where stereotyped but in the second novel, we find these characters being smoothed out thanks to Weber. Coalition building is the main theme of the book, and we find the people of Grantsville trying to secure democracy in a world that has been overrun by powerful enemies. However, since the Americans are coming from the a future time, they posses some modern technology, and it is fun to watch how the author resists the temptation of using modern technology in order to impose an American democracy in Germany.All in all, the Assiti Shards series is a great read for anyone interested in alternative history.\n\nEric Flint was born in California in 1947, he is a not only a writer but he is also an editor and he does e-publishing. He now lives in north Indiana with his family. He has a Ph.D. in history and most of his work has a historical theme to them.

It continues the story of agent Anton Zilwicki and Victor Cachat. The mood of the story is set in the Weber’s Honor verse. It centers around the very ancient cabal bent on enslaving the human race. The two stars of this novel threaten to expose their organization and when they do the entire galaxy’s political framework goes in shambles. Alliances are broken and new ones form and best friends become enemies. The long rivalry of the Republic of Heaven and the people of Monticore’s Star Empire have been completely squashed and the both have focused both their sights solely on the Alignment of Mesan. It is going to take a lot more than that to get that entity to surface. Even the stars of the novel are not exempted from the savagery of the Alignment.\n\nCrown of Slaves\n\nThis is a bestselling first time paperback of the Honor Harrington Universe. There is an alliance between the Star kingdom and Erewhon that is getting stronger due to the ignorance of the problems of the High Ridge regime. There is a definite instability in the politics of the Solarian League proven by the assassination of their voice of public conscience. The slave labor planet that the High Ridge was doing nothing about have all contributed to the long standing problems. The niece of the Queen Elizabeth and Zilwicki has been missioned by the queen in a desperate attempt to stop the problem.\n\nThe mission to a turn for the wort when they got to Erewhon only to encounter Victor Cachat, a very able agent may be the best for the Republic of Haven and to make matters worse Jeremy X is also present. He is leading the Audubon ballroom which is the organization of freed radical slaves.\n\n1632\n\nThe book is based in northern Germany and another in the Ring of Fire series. It was a time that death was a mercy for the lower class while the aristocrats lived a lavished life style. Things chance and Mike has to command a troop of miners in a fight against men in steel vests. These men were killing the community members without mercy and stapling them to the sides of building. The star of the novel along with the miners has to address this situation with extreme prejudice.\n\n1636, Commander Cantrell in the West Indies\n\nThis novel is also a best seller for the alternate history genres on the New York Times and Wall Street Journal.
