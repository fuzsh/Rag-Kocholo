        "text": "I ran across this blog by the author Kristen Lamb:\n\nPAY THE WRITER\n\nâ€¦while reading this article by Rachel Kramer Bussel in Salon magazine:\n\nDonâ€™t feel guilty\n\nIt will come as no surprise to anyone who knows me or who has read any of the essays Iâ€™ve written in the past on copyright laws and online piracy that I generally agree with Busselâ€™s stance and disagree with Lambâ€™s. But there are some issues involved that Bussel doesnâ€™t address which I think are actually more important than the ones she does. Another way to put it is that I donâ€™t think she goes far enough. The essence of her argument is that the situation is more complicated than Lamb presents it as being, and is not an either/or situation. While it is true that a book sold in a used book store may represent an immediate loss to an author, it can be made up for in the long run by exposing more people to that author.\n\nBussel is right, but she doesnâ€™t take it far enough. In truth, it is an â€œeither/orâ€ situation, just as Lamb says. The problem is that Lamb has the whole relationship standing on its head. She sees used book salesâ€”I would presume she feels the same way about people reading a book checked out of a library or borrowed from a friendâ€”as an infliction of harm on authors because it deprives them of income. But the reality is the exact opposite. The correct way to view the relationship between sales which bring direct income to authors and sales which donâ€™t, is that without the latter the former would dry up to a trickle within a rather short time.\n\nI will spend the rest of this essay supporting that thesis. But let me begin by establishing my bona fides on the subject.\n\nThese are two-fold. First, I am and have been since 1999 a successful full-time fiction author. I have published almost fifty novelsâ€”all of which are still in print, by the wayâ€”and over two dozen pieces of short fiction. I have also edited about the same number of anthologies of short fiction, which also bring me income both as an editor and (in some of the anthologies) as an author. And I also derive income from publishing the electronic magazine, the Grantville Gazette.\n\nSecondly, I am one of the founders and ongoing instructors of Superstars Writing Seminars. (http://superstarswriting.com/) This annual three-day seminar is the most prominent and important seminar on the business of being a writer in the United States, and has now been in operation since 2010. I am the instructor who gives the opening talk, which is an overview of publishing as a business.\n\nThe central and most critical aspect of publishing as a business, seen from the vantage point of an author, is that the market involvedâ€”call it the book market, if you willâ€”is possibly the most opaque sales market in existence. Itâ€™s certainly one of the top ten most opaque markets.\n\nWhat do I mean by an â€œopaqueâ€ market? Itâ€™s a market most of which is invisible to its customers. Hidden, in this case, not by subterfuge but by sheer volume of product. The characteristic that all entertainment industries share, and which makes all of them very opaque, is that each individual product has to be unique. Every book has to be different from every other book. Every song from every other song, every movie from every other movieâ€”and every painting or sculpture or art photo from every other one of that type.\n\nThat is very unlike most markets. If you take the automobile market for comparison, there are not all that many auto manufacturers and each of them produces a relatively small number of productsâ€”perhaps a dozen models; not more than two dozen. So anyone seeking to buy an automobile can research the entire market fairly quickly and fairly easily.\n\nIn contrast, every year in the English language somewhere in the vicinity of one and a half million new titles are produced in the book market. Even if you narrow the market down to a specific genre, the scale still dwarfs that of most markets. To use my own genre as an example, the number of new titles in fantasy and science fiction coming out in the English language every month exceeds the number of automobile models coming out in an entire year.\n\nWalking into a bookstore to look for a new book you might be interested in buying is analogous to walking onto the lot of an automobile dealer and being presented, not with many slightly different versions of a few models, but with thousands of modelsâ€”or tens of thousands, in the case of big superstores.\n\nNobody can keep up with this scale of production. Not even professional book reviewers can do it, much less the average reader. Itâ€™s like being caught in the middle of a blizzard, except the individual particles are sales products instead of snowflakes. Thatâ€™s what makes the book market so opaque.\n\nThe inevitable response of customers is to be very conservative in their buying habits. Some book-buyers (thankfully for new writers) are more adventurous than others, granted. But itâ€™s still the case that the vast majority of books purchased are books written by authors with whom the reader is already familiar. Thatâ€™s especially true in the fiction market, where there are many fewer â€œsignpostsâ€ than there are in the non-fiction market. What I mean by signposts is that someone interested in reading about, say, the history of New England in the 19th century can do a search using those words and if they turn up a book titled The History of New England, 1812-1905 theyâ€™re off to the races. Thereâ€™s no guarantee that book will be one that they like when they read it, but at least theyâ€™ve gotten a start. There are very few such signposts in fiction writing.\n\nAnd thatâ€™s the whole problem with Lambâ€™s approach to the subject. She fails to consider the question: How does anyone know about your book in the first place?\n\nThe answer to that question is complex. I make a habit of asking people who tell me theyâ€™ve read and liked one of my books how they ran across it. Itâ€™s not surprising that people whoâ€™ve already read something of mine and liked it would go out and buy another book of mine. But what got them to start reading my work in the first place?\n\nThe answers I get are always different, in detail. No two readers come to the same author in exactly the same way. But there is one very broad general pattern: With some exceptionsâ€”but they are a definite minorityâ€”readers first encounter me by getting their hands on a book of mine for which they did not pay me a thin dime. More precisely, from the sale of whichâ€”or acquisition of which, rather, because often there was no sale of any kindâ€”I derived no income at all.\n\nProbably the most common acquisition of this type is that a friend or relative recommended and lent the book to them. The other two most common are checking one of my books out of a library or buying it at a used book store. Another oneâ€”growing all the time in importanceâ€”is that I make a number of my books available for free online in electronic editions. If youâ€™re not familiar with the Baen Free Library where Iâ€™ve posted many of my titles, go to Baen Booksâ€™ web site (http://www.baen.com/), select â€œRead Baenâ€ from the top menu and then select â€œFree Library.â€\n\nI once had a conversation on this subject with Gene Wolfe, a prominent and long-time F&SF author. I told Gene that I estimated that for every book of an author sold in a form which brought direct income to him or her, another half-dozen people read that book in a form that brought him or her no income at all.\n\nGene thought I was being too conservativeâ€”or optimistic, take your pick. â€œEric, I always figure that I need about ten or twelve people to read a book of mine before I see any money from one sale.â€\n\nHe may well be right. If I was going to revise my own estimate that the ratio of freebie-to-moneymaking book acquisitions is six-to-one, Iâ€™d certainly revise it upward in Geneâ€™s direction, not downward. But regardless of what the exact ratio might beâ€”weâ€™ll never know, of courseâ€”what is absolutely clear to anyone willing to look at the subject in a calm, cold-blooded, practical manner, is that in order for an author to make a living from the sale of his or her books in a form that brings income, those relatively small number of income-deriving book sales have to be surrounded by a huge penumbra of book acquisitions which bring no direct income at all.\n\nAnd thatâ€™s only half of it. Because the other reality of an authorâ€™s existence, in terms of income, is that every author is constantly hemorrhaging readers. To put it in another and perhaps less gruesome way, every authorâ€™s fans are always drifting away from them.\n\nIâ€™m a little astonished at how many professional authors fail to grasp this harsh reality. Many of them seem to think that their â€œfan baseâ€ is something relatively fixed; established; stable.\n\nBut it is none of those things. The reason should be obvious. No author can write as fast as his or her fans can read. Sooner or later, even if a reader likes everything that you writeâ€”and very few readers doâ€”they will run through your entire corpus of work and move on.\n\nTo be sure, some of them will stay lifelong fans and keep buying your books as they get produced. But many, and probably the majority, wonâ€™t. After a while, they will drift away from you. There donâ€™t have to be any hard feelings involved. There usually arenâ€™t. Whatâ€™s involved is simply the familiar been there; done that phenomenon.\n\nTo make a living as a full time writer, or even to derive a significant income from writing, an author has to constantly recreate their readership base. The process is dynamic, not static. And the main way an author does so is by having that huge penumbra of free booksâ€”â€œfree,â€ at least, from the authorâ€™s standpointâ€”surrounding the much smaller number of books which get sold in a way that brings direct income.\n\nThatâ€™s why Lambâ€™s view of the matter is so skewed. Sheâ€™s right that itâ€™s an either/or situation, but she doesnâ€™t understand that the relationship between â€œeitherâ€ and â€œorâ€ is a necessary and beneficial one.\n\nThe way she sees it is this: Either someone buys one of my books in a way that brings me income or I donâ€™t get any income at all.\n\nThe way I see is this: Either my little world of income-deriving books is surrounded by a nice thick atmosphere of freebies or nobody reads or buys any books at all.\n\nGrousing about this reality is just silly. Itâ€™s the nature of the entertainment business, period. Always has been, always will be. There is a direct relationship between all the different forms in which a given authorâ€™s work is distributed. Here it is:\n\nIf you sell a lot of books you will get a good income AND\n\nA lot of your books will get passed from one person to another without you seeing a dime from it AND\n\nA lot of your books will end up in used book stores AND\n\nA lot of your books will get checked out of librariesâ€”for which you will only derive income from the libraryâ€™s initial purchase, not the later borrowings AND\n\nA lot of your books will get remaindered AND\n\nA lot of your books will get electronically pirated AND\n\nA lot of your books will be returned unread with the covers of the mass market paperbacks torn off AND\n\nI go could on. And on. Trust me.\n\nI always go into used book stores when I run across them, to do two things.\n\nFirst, I look to see if any of my books are on the shelves. I am pleased when they are; displeased when they are not. I would also be displeased if I saw a lot of my books on the shelves, especially covered with dust, but thatâ€™s never happened.\n\nSecondly, I ask the owner of the book store about my pattern of sales. Theyâ€™re always friendly for the simple reason that Iâ€™m always friendlyâ€”I start by telling them that Iâ€™m pleased to see theyâ€™re selling me or a little disturbed that theyâ€™re not. And for years now Iâ€™ve always gotten the same set of answer: â€œYour books sell well. They donâ€™t stay on the shelves so weâ€™re always willing to acquire more when someone brings them in. The only reason we donâ€™t have any of your books right now is because we sold everything we had.â€\n\nThatâ€™s what you want to hear, as an author.\n\nI support used book stores. I liked used book stores. I like to see my books on sale in used book stores.\n\nJust not too many of them. And none of them collecting dust.\n\nBut thatâ€™s up to me to prevent, by writing books that please a lot of readers. All that used book stores do is help me get those readers."
