A copy of the Code of Canon Law for the Latin Rite of the Catholic Church. This is a stripped down version I created for easy reference and research, it does not contain a contents page nor and index, instead one must use the search functions within the Acrobat Reader. \nThis text is the 1997 English edition, as produced by The Canon Law Society of Great Britain and Ireland in association with The Canon Law Society of Australia and New Zealand and The Canadian Canon Law Society. The text is a translation of the official Latin text promulgated in 1983 as a replacement for all prior laws of the Church.",
