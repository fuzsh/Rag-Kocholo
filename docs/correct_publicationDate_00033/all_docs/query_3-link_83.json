        "text": "1632: Snerking the Plots: Spoilers Ahead!\n\n“Snerk” is said to be a portmanteau of “sneaky smirk.” It’s used for advance knowledge of upcoming books. This is basically a classified briefing for writers and readers about what’s coming up in the 1632 universe. This is the one panel that will not be taped or recorded. If you want advance knowledge of how 1632 stories, including Baen novels, are advancing, come listen to this panel led by Bjorn Hasseler, Editor-in-Chief of “Eric Flint’s 1632 & Beyond”.\n\nAnthropology in World Building\n\nHow Can One Apply Cultural Anthropology to Developing Human and Nonhuman Civilizations? This is a broad-spectrum topic that can cover everything from basics like diet, shelter, and mode of dress (or lack of same) to social stratification, marriage/mating practices, taboos, warfare, spiritual beliefs or rituals, and language, to name a few. How do such details, even if they’re in the background, add depth and realism to your created cultures?\n\nAssiti Shards: Connecting Cadets, a Big Rig, and a Cruise Ship\n\nThis is an umbrella concept that includes the 1632verse, “Time Spike”, “The Alexander Inheritance” (Special Guest Gorg Huff), “The Crossing” (Special Guest Kevin Ikenberry), and “An Angel Called Peterbilt” (special Guest Gorg Huff). The panel will discuss the Assiti Shards in general and each of these shards specifically.\n\nCare for Authors Panel\n\nSo, how do you take care of an author? Do they need to fed and watered occasionally like plants? Can they be left alone like a cat? Or do they need constant attention like a dog? Is it okay to think of them as a pet or a child?\n\nCats in Sci Fi and Fantasy\n\nIn the world of pets, there are two animals that have always and will always go forth with humanity, the dog and the cat. This panel is about the ubiquitous, selfish, silent, perfect hunters that are the felines. Let’s talks cats in fiction, from the Depik assassins to the Treecats of Sphinx and let’s throw in those annoying pets, Spot and Jonesy.\n\nClothing, Fashion, & Cosplay in Alternate History\n\nCosplay is an integral part of many fandoms, but it doesn’t seem like it’s done a lot in alternate history properties. Why is that? Also, what changes does alternate history tend to make in fashion, most specifically (but not solely) in the 1632verse. What ideas do you have for alternate history and 1632verse cosplay? Hopefully some of you will arrive wearing your ideas!\n\nCo-Authoring a book or series\n\nAre you a writer looking for opportunities? Sometimes an idea is too big for one author. This leads to collaboration. Whether it is co-authoring a book like Brian Herbert and Kevin J Anderson writing the new Dune books, or working together on a shared universe like the 4HU, collaboration is part of picture. Our panel of collaborating authors will discuss the process and it pros and cons. Join us of this panel!\n\nCurrent State of the 4HU\n\nLet’s face it, a lot of you are here because of CKP’s Four Horsemen universe. Well, let’s see what’s in store for the Merc Guilds. What’s coming down the line as far as stories, and plotlines, and characters. Is there another Author Insert character coming? What about RedShirt opportunities? C’mon, you apes, who wants to live forever! What about new authors?\n\nDiving In and Going Deep: 1632 Book Club\n\nDo you want to talk about Eric Flint’s “1632”? Are you interested in being joining diving into 1632Con but you don’t really know anything about the 1632verse? Do you want to go deeper and start a book club focused on books in the 1632verse? If you answered yes to any of these, this is the panel for you! We will talk 1632 and then discuss how you can start your own 1632 Book Club. (There are dozens of books and over 100 magazine issues, so there’s plenty to keep a book club going!)\n\nFandom as an Important Third Space\n\nThe Third Space is the social space that is separate from home (“first space”) and work (“second space”). It is a social commons where individuals from many different backgrounds can come together. As older physical commons, such as shopping malls disappear, and the digital commons are algorithmically fenced into ideological bubbles, can fandom be a place where people come together and form a new commons where all are welcome?\n\nFlint’s Cohorts\n\nIn this Panel, we will remember the works and influence of Eric Flint, who passed away a few years ago. As well as creating the 1632-verse, Eric worked with the SuperStars of Writing and the Crown of Slaves series. Come see his compatriots discuss the man and his projects, and hear about the future of the Crown of Slaves series from the author who will be picking it up where Eric left it off. Come join us for an awesome time!\n\nHey, Come Back Here! What Happens When Your Characters Take Over the Story\n\nIt’s said you know you have strong, well-developed characters when they take matters into their own hands. Sometimes it fits your plot, but sometimes it may take your intended tale in a completely different direction. So, what do you do? What are some of the most unexpected things your characters have done? Did you let them go ahead or rein them in?\n\nHey, do you remember when…\n\nHey, do you remember when the Galactica met the Devil? How about when the crew of the Jupiter Two met a carrot man (wasn’t that Doctor Smith?) Do you remember when the Enterprise was grabbed by a giant green hand or how about when they met Lincoln? Do you remember when we used to sing “Shalalalala Lala Lala Deela Deeda?” Well, let’s have some fun remembering good old stuff from our favorite TV Shows.\n\nHobbies and Hustles\n\nCome join us for this panel! Even the most prestigious or prolific authors need a day off. What do our panelists do to relieve the stress of constantly creating the worlds and characters that we love? Here, the guests will discuss their own hobbies and the importance of said hobbies.\n\nHP Holo’s NSFW Raunchy Romance Panel\n\nNSFW, yes NSFW! We’re going to have HP Holo talk about the ins and outs of everything and anything that she and her friends can talk about. BEWARE this is the definition of a NOT SAFE FOR WORK Panel as they will really discuss everything! Make sure you join us at FantaSci and don’t miss out on all the details!\n\nIs the Book always better…?\n\nIn the world of adaptation, it is almost an axiom that the “book was better.” We’ve all heard it. We are sick of hearing it. But is it true? Is there a movie that is better than the book? Is there a movie that is better than the original comic? Join our panel of authors and experts and let’s talk about some times where Hollywood may have made the better story.\n\nIs the Movie Ever Better than the Book?\n\nThere is an age-old adage that the book is always better than the movie adapted from said book. Is this always true? Are there examples where the movie might be (just a bit) better than the book. Our panelists will discuss adaptation, and their opinion on this question? Maybe the answer is no, or maybe they will surprise you with examples of books that were outdone by their movie counterparts.\n\nJumping Forward and Sliding Back: Technological Progress in 1632\n\nHow does tech jump forward for the people living in 1632 when people arrive from 2000 WV with all their knowledge? How does it slide backward to match the reality in 1631 for those same folks from 2000? And how do they combined and move forward through the series?\n\nLet’s talk COMICS!!!!\n\nThe obligatory comic panel at our Sci-Fi convention. C’mon, admit it, Superheroes are sci fi, aren’t they. Superman is an alien, that’s sci fi. Spider Man got bit by a radioactive spider, that’s sci fi. Batman is a billionaire that cares about the little people of his community, that’s sci fi. Lex Luthor is a tech billionaire who only cares about himself, okay that’s every billionaire, but this one dresses up in a kryptonite powered armor to fight an alien, that sci fi!\n\nMilitary Advances in 1632: Not Just Hitting Replay\n\nThese are not your ancestors’ armed forces. You can’t make everything thought of between now and then. You can make *that*, but you probably shouldn’t. Nobody here cares about your sacred organizational principles. On the other hand, put “good enough for now” together with people who have actual battlefield experience and knowledge of alternate events…\n\nNoir in Science Fiction and Fantasy\n\nTopics: Origins of Noir; Noir Tropes in SF/Fantasy; Favorite Noir Stories; Why We Love Noir. Wherein we discuss the darker side of SF/Fantasy, and why gritty detective stories with femme fatales mash up so well with the futuristic and fantastic.\n\nNom de Plume; Nom de Guerre\n\nSometimes you want to publish a book or a story, but you find out that someone out there has your name and they are famous for a reason you don’t want to be associated with your book, say a politician or porn star. Or perhaps you are worried that people won’t take you seriously if you publish with your own name because you are female (like Dorothy “DC” Fontana). Or maybe your Dad’s last name is King and he named you Joe, so you really need a better name on the book. Well, then, use a NOM DE PLUME, but…\n\nOut of the Hat\n\nCome and join us for The Hat! The Hat contains topics and questions. Our panelists will do their best to respond to those topics and questions. Possible topics: Star Wars vs Star Trek, Is a Battlestar any good, Favorite X File, The Doctor, Who farted?\n\nPunch ’em in the gut: Emotional charged SF and Fantasy\n\nHow do your favorite authors always manage to make the room dusty? Come listen to our panel of experts as they discuss the dastardly ways they sneak those onion-chopping ninjas into your favorite stories. What makes for good, emotionally charged stories and what’s just pandering purple prose? Our experts will break it down and give you insight into their own favorite emotionally charged pieces.\n\nReading: Tell the 1632 Editors What YOU Want!\n\nThe Editorial Staff of “Eric Flint’s 1632 & Beyond” is here to listen while you tell us what kind of short stories you really like in the 1632verse. Is there a particular area you want to hear more about? A city or country? Some kind of tech? A character or storyline you loved that hasn’t come up again in a few years? A writer (other than Eric) you miss?\n\nStar Wars Legends\n\nNo Science Fiction Convention is complete without a Star Wars panel. Let’s talk about the old Star Wars Expanded Universe. Do you remember Kyle Katarn and Kyp Durron? What did you think of the Yuuzhan Vong? Do you remember when Luke got married? Let’s remember some good times. Come join us!\n\nState of the ‘Verse/1637 World Tour\n\nEric created a big world! Do you know what’s been happening in it lately? This is the place for an update with the editorial staff of the new magazine “Eric Flint’s 1632 & Beyond” all in attendance.\n\nUAPs Are Real…What Now?\n\nThe US Government admitted UAP are not only real, but that they frequently entered the airspace above Navy ships and land-based facilities. Given this admission, how might authors adjust their writing around aliens, human first contact, and science fiction in general? Come enjoy discussing the amazing possibilities with our panel of authors!\n\nWhat Doesn’t Kill You…\n\nWhat impacts near-death experiences have on people/characters, writing characters who respond to such events in realistic fashions. What a near-miss looks like and how it can change people for the better (or worse).\n\nWriting: What the 1632 Editors Want\n\nEric Flint felt passionately about helping new authors get a start and 1632 is continuing that mission. The Editorial Staff of “Eric Flint’s 1632 & Beyond” is here to tell aspiring authors that, well, first of all we really really want you! And second of all, what we are looking for in stories.
