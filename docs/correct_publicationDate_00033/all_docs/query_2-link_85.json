ALL-NEW STORIES SET IN THE RING OF FIRE SERIES, EDITED BY NEW YORK TIMES BEST-SELLING SERIES CREATOR ERIC FLINT.In 1632, an unexplained temporal and spatial phenomenon known as the Ring of Fire transported the blue-collar town of Grantville, West Virginia, smack-dab in the middle of the Thirty Years War. When the dust settles, it becomes clear that the town of Grantville isn't going anywhere, and the can-do Americans of the twentieth century begin altering the course of history forever.

About 1637: The Coast of Chaos: “. . . skilled authors seamlessly weave together historical and fictional characters, making it an easy read for fans old and new to the series.” —Booklist About 1637: No Peace Beyond the Line: “The action is non-stop. The authors skillfully blend battle, intrigue, politics, and everyday life in a remade seventeenth century to yield an exciting story.

Beginning with 1632, Flint—along with dozens of cowriters—chronicled what happened when the 20th-century town of Grantville, West Virginia, was transported through time and space to 17th-century Europe. In addition, Flint was the author, with New York Times best seller David Weber, of the Crown of Slaves Saga, as well as the Belisaurius series, with best-selling author David Drake. Flint was the editor of Jim Baen’s Universe, as well as numerous short story anthologies. Before becoming a writer, Flint worked as a trade union organizer, longshoreman, truck driver, auto worker, steel worker, oil worker, meatpacker, glassblower, and machinist. Eric Flint passed away in 2022.\n\nGorg Huff is a Texas citizen who has enthusiastically helped in researching the 1632 series background, written numerous stories for the Grantville Gazette, and contributed both maps and drawings to 1634: The Bavarian Crisis. Gorg began as a solo writer, but now principally teams with Paula Goodlett.\n\nPaula Goodlett retired from the military as a noncommissioned officer in the early nineties. She broke her leg in 2003, which led to her browsing Baen's Bar lest she become bored during her enforced inactivity. Captivated by the 1632 universe concept, she began as a special assistant to Eric Flint. She eventually wrote a large important sequence of the storyline in 1634: The Ram Rebellion. She was editor of the Grantville Gazette and chairs the 1632 Editorial Board. Additionally, Paula was assistant editor of the e-zine Jim Baen's Universe. Paula mainly writes in tandem with Gorg Huff."
