Tagged: Author.\n\n(1950- ) US author best known as a highly prolific producer of Fantasy, the category into which all her solo novels fall. Her first published story was \"A Different Kind of Courage\" in Free Amazons of Darkover (anth 1985) edited by Marion Zimmer Bradley. The Ship Who Searched (1992) with Anne McCaffrey is sf set in the latter's Brainship universe. Lackey's novel-length contribution to the Darkover franchise, Rediscovery: A Darkover Novel (1993), is billed as a collaboration with Bradley, whose actual input may well have been minimal.\n\nA further faux collaboration is the Shared World fantasy Reap the Whirlwind (1989) with C J Cherryh, actually written entirely by Lackey. Yet other fantasy collaborations include the Halfblood Chronicles trilogy with Andre Norton – opening with The Elvenbane: An Epic High Fantasy of the Halfblood Chronicles (1991) [see Checklist below] – and the standalone If I Pay Thee Not in Gold (1993) with Piers Anthony.\n\nIn 2022 Lackey received SFWA's Damon Knight Memorial Grand Master Award (see SFWA Grand Master Award).
