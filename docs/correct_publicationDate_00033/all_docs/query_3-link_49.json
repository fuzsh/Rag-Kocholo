Baen Books. My daughter Melissa, the English major purist that she is, rolls her eyes when I talk about alternate history stories, as if they were worse that pornography. And I guess it is sort of an eye candy to me, especially … More Review: “Belisarius II: Storm at Noontide” by Eric Flint and David Drake\n\nReview: “Destroyermen: Crusade” by Taylor Anderson\n\nHere’s my review in a nutshell: More of the same. If you’re like me and like alternate history/military sci-fi stories, and if you happened to pick up Into the Storm, the first book in the Destroyermen series after my review, then the news that this is more of the same should be good news. Crusade … More Review: “Destroyermen: Crusade” by Taylor Anderson\n\nReview: Destroyermen: Into the Storm by Taylor Anderson\n\nDestroyermen: Into the Storm by Taylor Anderson. Roc Books. 386 pages. I’m a big fan of alternate history stories. I am also a fan of military sci-fi. When I can find a book–better yet, a series–that combines these two, and does it well, I am in reader heaven. Years ago, I read The Lost Regiment … More Review: Destroyermen: Into the Storm by Taylor Anderson\n\nReview: “Curious Notions” by Harry Turtledove\n\nReview: Curious Notions (Crosstime Traffic series, book 2) by Harry Turtledove. Tor Books. 272 pages. Harry Turtledove is one of my favorite authors, and is considered the father of alternative history. He is a very prolific author, and has several series, all dealing with the what-if of things that could have happened that didn’t. The … More Review: “Curious Notions” by Harry Turtledove\n\nTom Horn Rides Again\n\nI am determined to be a part of NaNoWriMo this year. For those of you who don’t know, that’s National Novel Writing Month, where each November crazy people like me attempt to write a 50,000-word novel in 30 days. I’ve done it three times, and have three books to share because of it. But there … More Tom Horn Rides Again\n\nHits and Misses\n\nI’ve never been able to pat my head and rub my belly at the same time, and so I have been remiss in keeping up with my blog, or my writing for that matter. But I had decided early on that this summer was not going to be writing intensive. Instead, I have spent the … More Hits and Misses\n\nLast gasp. NaNoWriMo, here I come!\n\nToday is the last day of October, and tomorrow morning marks the beginning of National Novel Writing Month. For those who know NaNoWriMo, you’re know what’s going through my mind right now. Anticipation. Excitement. Wonder if I am making a terrible mistake. It’s a major commitment of time, energy and patience–both of you and those … More Last gasp. NaNoWriMo, here I come!\n\nFinding Your Audience\n\nFrom a marketing standpoint, success in any endeavor where you’re selling a commodity is primarily a matter of linking the right audience or customer with the right product. There are two ways to do this. One way is to develop a product and then find someone to buy it. The plus of this is that … More Finding Your Audience\n\nWhy I like westerns, and the demise of the genre\n\nFirst of all, I want you to know that I truly enjoy a good western. I haven’t always felt that way. Growing up with a father who read westerns and wanted John Wayne movies, I saw my share of schlock. And that, I think, is what has led to the demise of the genre. The … More Why I like westerns, and the demise of the genre"
