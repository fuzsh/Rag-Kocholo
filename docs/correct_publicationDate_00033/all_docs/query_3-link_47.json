        "text": "I just heard news that Eric Flint has died. This is very sad. Flint was a great writer and a generous soul. The creator of the 1630s alternate history series, he was one first authors who not only let other writers, especially amateurs, play in his story world, he actively encouraged them.\n\nI corresponded with him a bit after Weapons of Choice came out and found him to be a wise and big hearted supporter of anyone who was willing to have an honest go.\n\nHis books were great fun and, well, just great.\n\nI mean, look at this cover.\n\nHe was possessed of a fiery liberal spirit but not of the partisan antipathy which so often characterises American letters these days.\n\nThere are lines and images from his books which stand out in my memory twenty years after he wrote them. I may go back and revisit some of those old titles.\n\nIn the meantime, pour one out for an old master."
