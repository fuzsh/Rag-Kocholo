        "text": "I've read some of his stuff, but frankly, looking at your options, are you just taking the piss? I don't recall him doing recent history stuff.\n\nYour last option specifically involves moving Vancouver over to Vancouver Island 1 year before I was born. That's not historical fiction, that's a local apocalypse.\n\nSeriously, this isn't dropping some redneck ville into Switzerland just in time to really fuck up pikes and rifles warfare*.\n\nBased on the \"exchanges a literal sphere of rock, city and air\" model from the books, you just dropped 4 million people in a place with no infrastructure. Unless you landed on Victoria, in which case you just swapped Vancouver 2022 with Victoria 1971.\n\nThe Canadian and US military both would have to go full on relief mode just to keep everyone fed and watered. The good news is Deltaport, the Port of Vancouver, and Tsawassen would be all set up to receive bacon, as it were.\n\nGo too much earlier and we'd literally kill millions. Dropping Vancouver in anything that's not modern times would simply kill most of its population by starvation.\n\nI've read some of the books, and the whole \"drop a few thousand rednecks into Europe just in time to fuck up pikes and muskets\" was amusing. For a bit.\n\nThe 1632 series was 2nd amendment porn, imo. It was fun when I was in my 20s, but...nah. I have a godson who's basically the \"headed for the olympics\" competitive shooter from the early books, and I know what it'd do to him to kill a bunch of strangers. You don't just go out and pop some heads like it's a video game, even if you've been shooting since you could hold a rifle up.\n\nOn the other hand!\n\nHe did some stuff that WAS good. IMO, the Belisarius series, with David Drake. Flint unfucked Drake's inability to characterize, and Drake's historical research, frankly, is better than Flint's. Drake outlined the series and Flint wrote it, and It Was Good. Kinda like John Ringo, in a way. John is a complete jackass, but if you get him a good co-author, you can get some fun stuff.\n\nYou decide whether I'm talking about Flint or Drake or both\n\nYeah if you live in large city, that's a major part of a metropolitan zone.. best pick wisely. Though even if you live in small city and city with even a recognizable collective mind-set/skill-set there is still going to be challenges.\n\nAnd yeah go back even not to far back... and one also has diseases brought into certain parts of the globe could also wipe out (though leaning more on weaponized/irresponsible negligence than perhaps accidental/or surprise in the blanket warfare done by the early visitors) a large population of the surrounding native area in a few years.\n\nAs for locations it was meant to be wild because I wanted some options (and the poll does allow people to change their vote) that would give reasonable chance of survival for those that didn't want to play \"I will survive 24/7\" after a teleport/exchange; ancient places were based on out of the way but not totally out of the way places.\n\nTurkey you'd hopefully have an agricultural capable group of neighbors (though probably not enough to feed the metropolitan traffic population caught in a major city during the day.. or let alone the resident population of the fore mentioned major city),\n\nSouth Africa is rich in a variety of resources and not counting local populations, you have other nearby civilizations to communicate and trade with. Also Empageni was picked for its physical greener location in what would later be known as Kwa Zulu Natal, and in that it's not to far or near the coast.\n\nJeju island is there for those wanting to be near China and Korea but with an island to operate from,\n\nLahore you're right at the early start of some major cultural powers (there is the island that Sri Lanka is on but I felt that island would be too close to other powers and whomever was there might not have enough room to maneuver/ so I felt just pull the band-aide quickly was a good option).\n\nKetchikan, Alaska is out of the way, has decent lumber and fisheries resources. Main concerns would be relations with the Tlinget and obviously Haida, outside of general nature survival (it's fairly mild in Ketchikan, concerns would mostly be fresh water access, minding the black bears, general hypothermia awareness, and basic coastal safety.. but again fresh water for a low-mid to large population will be a major concern).\n\nFor those that felt a bit more adventurous I gave them; Mexico - You're near a few civilizations but hopefully in a really good location to start from, Jersalem just before Herold took over/managed it for Rome, Constantinople area before the first Crusade, Scotland not quite out of the way and just before some serious increased unrest, Puerto Rico a bit before Columbus would land nearby on his first visit let alone land in Puerto Rico on his 2nd visit, and Tasmania before it was discovered by Europeans and decades later malevolently wiped out of its native population, New York you'd be between tensions between French and British forces of the time.\n\nSouth Island, New Zealand is a dice roll but.. might be a real good dice roll, basically the start (or maybe just before) of the arrival of the descendants of the Moari. Also bit of a warning in 1314/1315 a volcano in the central north part of the \"North Island\" is going to errupt. Outside that New Zealand has incredible resources to work with.\n\nNear modern options, were for those that didn't want the hassle of trying to rebuild society with a misc. bunch of people. Because again not everyone lives in small towns, or even major cities who are the dominant member of a metropolitan area with a clear and mostly agreeable mindset or/and skillset.\n\nThe time for Switzerland was picked because that was about the time they'd be doing some improvements to an already greatly improved general law for their people. And its neutrality in the World Wars to follow would provide a somewhat stable, maybe not guaranteed as they still had to manage relations with their neighbors, culture to merge and grow strong with.\n\nIreland was picked for its location, its recent independence, and it was after a global pandemic. Great for those that didn't want to be inland in a continent.\n\nI put in 1960 UK because that county has Liverpool and assuming they didn't get caught in the temporal exchange you might basically get to enjoy the coming of the Beatles (though hopefully they don't all change occupations due to your arrival). Also I figured 20 years would allow a more safer transition work from coal than what happened in the 1980s.\n\nFor Vancouver Island 1971, I originally picked King County, WA USA but with the current \"current\" state of the US, I thought who wants to waste 50 years, with the possibility of being stuck in a country with a large entrenched anti-democracy party with violent tendencies. Obviously Canada isn't perfect and kudos for it dealing with the recent child graves and deadly right wing believers infiltrating into its military, but its current culture problems of continually dumping garbage in what should have been just recyclable material in foreign countries, is way way better than; the US's anti-democracy movement, remarking women as breeding cattle, and continual US level homeless and medical coverage issues (and yeah Canada has similar issues but at least it has a partial net out) here in the US. And who knows, if you and whom ever was there makes it big in Canada.. maybe they could help fund and make active sewage waste center way before 2020, and even better more than just covering greater Victoria. (but of course congrats on McLoughlin Point Wastewater Treatment Plant, but seriously long overdue. But as a inhabitant of the NW and former NOAA employee, I'm relieved it finally came to be.) And no I'm not anti-US, I've done my bit for God and County (along with at least two generations prior to me) and we've done good things like ban plastics from purposely being used as micro-scrubbers for skin products, and we did the ban the lead thing out of most products during the 1970s, not to mention our music and other media so hey. We did good as a country (but so did other countries as well).\n\nMy personal choice was 1960 UK. But originally I was thinking of going for Ireland. But I just wanted a chance to see the Beatles / and other 1960s British musical talent. Plus I don't have to deal with WW2. And I'd have 7 years to try to convince the UK to handle the Chagos Island situation more humanely. *thinking* OH and all the autographs of favorite classical authors I could potentially get too. >\n\nAnd yeah some authors, even favorites, collab works can definitely shine better with other authors vs. had they just gone solo. My long time favorite is Robert Lynn Asprin, and for certain collab books when he was with other authors you kind of get a feeling on who probably did more research in certain parts of the books. Not that he wasn't capable, but he was probably juggling other stuff at the time..\n\nAnything earlier, around 1600, you become the center of the world for pretty much everything. The technology, manufacturing, social, political, etc. knowledge is just too titanic.\n\nSee, I'm not so sure about this. For the first few decades, sure, but your problem becomes attrition if you're too early. You've got plenty of the top-of-the-heap technology, but if you show up too early, you're missing a bunch of the middle of the heap.\n\nAs an example, in 1632, Eric Flint points out the importance of five-or-ten horsepower agricultural engines. You need a certain level of metallurgical technology to make a simple Briggs and Stratton clone. You need to be able to make pistons, to make and polish crankshafts, to create cylinder bores in a fashion that won't overheat. You need different kinds of metals and different techniques to build a carburetor with small passages in the venturi to get the fuel delivery close to correct. There's a lot going on with just this small device.\n\nIf you have parts, the local shade-tree mechanics can keep it running, but even a university metallurgist isn't necessarily someone who can get you to where you have parts, because it's not just a case of knowing how much carbon to put in the steel, it's knowing the foundry techniques necessary to create the part you want. There's a whole passel of things that don't necessarily all come with you from the 21st century.\n\nBasically, if you're so early that the locals don't know how to cast a piston, to build a rifle barrel out of, or similar, then you can't maintain your technological superiority for too long.\n\n'course, if you transport a large enough area, you've got enough random lawnmowers lying about to keep you in spare parts 'til after you're dead, so that's something. Who knows, that might even be long enough for your people to figure out how to get to where you can make spare parts with the stuff you have available. Or it might not, and now your grandkids are starring in yet another after-the-fall-of-a-great-and-powerful-civilization novel.\n\nNow, repeat for every form of technology that's not based on metal. Pretty soon, you're looking at an area of the world that once had great wealth and riches, but now just knows what an adjustable rate mortgage is. Can't find any takers for it, but they've got 'em....\n\nI had never read any of the books, but I picked up 1632 since it was free (thanks for that, blath).\n\nI'm not quite done (80%), but I has opinions. No spoilers. Well, almost.\n\nDid you ever read Swiss Family Robinson? As a little kid I liked it, but upon rereading as an adult (aloud to my kid, natch) it's hard not to roll my eyes at just how much the dice kept landing in the family's favor. It's like the author was cheering on his little characters, and since he gets to decide whether something becomes a problem or not, situations would only arise once they're ready to take them on and they could just totally smash the problem.\n\nEric Flint isn't nearly that bad. But he's still doing it. He wants these characters of his to win, and it shows in every little moment. This is, what's a good name for it? Maybe \"March to Glory\" fiction?\n\nSo far it's been a fun romp, but it really is tough to take seriously.\n\nOkay, mild spoiler, just cause I feel like I should be specific:\n\nHe skips right over their first winter. In reality, it would have been bad. If you take an area that is as war-torn as he describes, and you dump in a bunch more people and concentrate refugees in one area, you get sickness and starvation. He has the characters be concerned about it, and then the problem miraculously never materializes. It doesn't get solved, it just ... doesn't become a problem. Everybody eats like kings, it's fine!\n\nI get that you can't have a story arc in which everything bad happens right away. You need to space out the problems so that you have room to develop them, and to show off how clever your the characters' solution is. But foreshadowing the problem and then hand-waving it out of existence stood out as particularly egregious example of why it doesn't feel like the world is taking itself quite seriously. The whole scenario is a bit like a PvE game ... but as you watch, you keep noticing that the author has it on easy mode.\n\nDespite that, I may give the next book a shot once I wrap up this one. It is a fun premise, and I'm not sick of winning yet. Also, I'm somewhat hopeful that if Eric only co-wrote the next, maybe the world would be a little less slanted in his characters' favor.\n\nThe first winter actually was adressed in the book: Food hidden away by peasants from marauding foraging armies.\n\nThis is at historically plausible, but in the context of the Thirty Years' War potentially problematic.\n\nIt is plausible because historically, peasants were very adept at that sort of thing in the context of medieval warfare. They had a very powerful motivation to get good at it, too: Peasants that weren't tended to starve. If they weren't, or if the context of medieval warfare weren't of a nature that very often peasants would be able to allow this, we would be able to observe mass starvation events through their effects of demography, and how demography affects manmade structures that can be recognized as such centuries after.\n\nWe can also be confident in our ability to observe these, because thanks to Antiquity we know what we have to look for: Unlike medieval warfare Roman warfare (the defining form of warfare in Antiquity, on account of that whole Roman Empire thing) did not wage war against countries, or states, or individual nobles. Rome waged war against an entire people:\n\nWhen Illyria (present-day Yugoslavian successor states and Albania) revolted against Rome Tiberius sent one of the largest armies ever deployed by Rome to Illyria to pacify it. The army was successful in this, but not by killing the insurgents through more direct action but by literally eating the province into famine.\n\nHence while warfare was very common in the Medieval Period and Early Modern Age it was of a low-lethality nature, especially amongst the peasantry, that usually did not cause these type of mass starvation events. If it did we'd know, and we're not reliant this being related to us through the written record, because we know how to extract the evidence of such events occuring from the archeological record.\n\nBut in the context of the Thiry Years' War, this can be problematic, because that war is one of those occurances where this type of thing broke down, and where such mass starvations did occur in some areas. In general the casualities of that war are extremely localized: Some areas were virtually untouched by it, while in other areas more than 90% of the peasantry starved."
