Afterwards, he became president of the Viglius College and in 1636 he was appointed Regius Professor of Theology. He became rector of the university in the fall of 1625. In 1646 he left the Viglius College for the Pope's College. In 1649, he resigned this position after having been appointed Bishop in Roermond in 1648, but he died before he could take up this new position.\n\nRead more\n\nFind items in Lovaniensia\n\nAdrianus VI (1459-1523)\n\nAdrianus Florensz or Adrian of Utrecht, was a professor at the Louvain Faculty of Theology from 1490 till 1515. In 1497 he was appointed dean of the Chapter of Saint Peter's, thus also becoming vice-chancellor of the university. He also served as rector of the university for two terms (1493 and 1500-1501). Adrian’s attempts to steer theology in a new, more practical and pastoral-oriented, direction have been applauded. At the same time, he had strong views about the office of priests and prelates, which had to be brought back to their original “vocation”. Apart from his actions to restore celibacy among the canons of the Saint-Peter’s Church in Louvain, he was critical of clerics holding multiple benefices, as this made it impossible for them to perform the pastoral duties connected to these benefices themselves. While being a professor at the Louvain Faculty of Theology, Adrianus became advisor to Margareta of Austria in 1506 and in 1507 Maximillian of Austria made him praeceptor (tutor) of the future Charles V. He was later appointed regent in Spain, and made his way into the Spanish ecclesiastical hierarchy, as Bishop of Tortosa, inquisitor and cardinal. On 9 January 1522 he was elected Pope, but it lasted until August before he arrived in Rome. He then took the name Adrian VI, but he already died on 14 September 1523 in Rome. In his will, he established the Pope’s College in Louvain, meant as a contribution to the theological education of future clergy.\n\nRead more\n\nFind items in Lovaniensia\n\nMatthaeus Adrianus (1475-1530)\n\nMatthaeus Adrianus was born to a Jewish family on the Iberian Peninsula around 1475 and converted to Catholicism in his youth. He studied medicine on the Italian Peninsula and travelled around Europe teaching Hebrew. In the summer of 1517, he came into contact with Erasmus, who invited him to become the first professor of Hebrew at the Collegium Trilingue in Louvain in 1518. He left Louvain in July 1519, after which he became Professor of Hebrew at the University of Wittenberg until February 1521. After this date, it is presumed that he stayed in Freiburg for a while, after which his whereabouts become unclear.\n\nRead more\n\nFind items in Lovaniensia\n\n(H)adrianus Amerotius (ca 1495-1560)\n\nHadrianus Amerotius (Amerot), a native of Soissons, studied Greek in Paris under Girolamo Aleandro. In november 1513, he enrolled at the University of Louvain as a pauperculus iuvenis (‘pour youngster’). He took up residence at the Pedagogy of the Lily. To pay for his studies in Canon and Civil Law, he taught Greek privately. In 1520, Thierry Martens published Amerotius’ Greek grammar, entitled Compendium Graecae grammatices. Even though the grammar on its own was issued only once, it did enjoy a rich reception. Two excerpts in particular, one on the Greek numerical system, the other on Greek dialects, were often reprinted either as separate booklets or as addenda to lexica. In the years 1542-1543, he was Professor of Greek at the Pedagogy of the Castle. In 1545, he succeeded Rutger Rescius as the new Professor of Greek at the Collegium Trilingue, a position which he held until his death in January 1560, even though he was often substituted by Theodoricus Langius.\n\nRead more\n\nFind items in Lovaniensia\n\nValerius Andreas (1588-1655)\n\nValerius Andreas studied Greek and Hebrew, first in Antwerp and then at the University of Douai. In 1611 he was appointed Professor of Hebrew at the Collegium Trilingue. At the same time, he also studied canon and civil law in Louvain and became doctor utriusque juris in 1621. In 1628 he was appointed to the royal chair of the Institutiones. He is also known for his historical work, the Bibliotheca Belgica, a list of bio-bibliographies of the most important people of the Netherlands. Finally, from 1636 till his death in 1655, he was the first librarian of the University of Louvain.\n\nRead more\n\nFind items in Lovaniensia\n\nJacobus Baius (ca 1554-1614)\n\nJacobus Baius, or de Bay, studied arts (third of his promotion in 1563) and theology at the University of Louvain. He became licentiate of theology in 1572 and one year later, he became president of the Savoy College. In 1586 he got his doctoral title in theology, and soon afterwards, after the death of his uncle Michael Baius (cf. infra), he was appointed Professor of Theology. In the spring of 1580, and again in the spring of 1598, he served as rector of the university. He was also dean at Saint James’ Church and in 1609 of Saint Peter’s Church. He founded the Baius College for students of theology in today’s Tiensestraat in Louvain.\n\nRead more\n\nFind items in Lovaniensia\n\nMichael Baius (1513-1589)\n\nMichael Baius, or Michel de Bay, studied Theology in Louvain and was professor at the Faculties of Arts (1543-1549) and Theology (1549-1589). He was a crucial figure in the Old University: first Regius Professor of Scholastics, from 1551 holder-ad-interim and from 1552 titular of the royal chair of Sacred Scriptures at the theological Faculty of Louvain, a position he would occupy for the next 37 years until his death in 1589, President of the Pope’s College and founder of a new college. He was a very popular professor, attracting large audiences of students.\n\nHe is renowned in the history of Theology because of his innovative ideas and teaching methods, which meant a rupture with a more traditional Leuven Theology. Living at the border of Europe’s Protestant regions, Baius considered this new theological approach to be the most appropriate for entering into a debate with the Calvinists, in the hope of bringing them back into the Catholic fold.\n\nAccusations that Baius had deviated from confirmed orthodoxy ultimately, in 1567, provoked a subtle condemnation by Pope Pius V of several propositions taken from Baius’ writings – as the bull stated that the some of the statements could be supported in the sense that the author intended – and this curious formulation (depending on the famous comma pianum) was repeated in 1580 by Gregory XIII – judgments to which Baius and his like-minded colleagues submitted.\n\nRead more*\n\nFind items in Lovaniensia\n\nAdrianus Barlandus (1486-1538)\n\nAdrianus Barlandus was born in Baarland (Zeeland) in 1486 and received his first education at the Latin School of Ghent. By 1501, Barlandus had enrolled at the University of Louvain, where he resided at the Pedagogy of the Pig. He graduated in 1505 and shortly thereafter, in 1506, he started teaching at the same pedagogy. In the fall of 1518, he became the first Professor of Latin at the Collegium Trilingue in Louvain, but he resigned for financial reasons after a year and three months. He then focused mainly on the well-paid private education of the nobility. In 1526, he was named rhetor publicus (‘Public Professor of Rhetoric’). He later also became canon of the Church of Saint Peter’s in Louvain until his death in 1538. He corresponded, among others, with Erasmus, and had a rich scholarly output.\n\nRead more\n\nFind items in Lovaniensia\n\nPetrus Beausardus (1520-1578)\n\nThe first mathematical classes in Louvain were founded by the city in 1563. In 1569, they were transformed into a royal chair hosted by the Faculty of Arts. Petrus Beausardus was appointed as the first Regius Professor of Mathematics, teaching arithmetic and geometrics. In 1573, he published for his students an Arithmetices praxis, which strongly resembled to the Arithmeticae practicae methodus facilis by Gemma Frisius (1540).\n\nRead more\n\nFind items in Lovaniensia\n\nRobertus Bellarminus (1542-1621) Robertus Bellarminus was born in 1542 in Montepulciano. In 1560, he entered the Jesuit Society. After studying in Rome and Padua for a couple of years, he was sent to Louvain to complete his theological studies. Soon after his arrival in 1569, he was promoted from student to teacher of the Scholastic Theology course that the Jesuits in Louvain had initiated, while he continued to deliver sermons in Saint Michael’s Church. During his stay in Louvain, he was a close witness to the political turmoil in the Habsburg Empire, the struggles at the Faculty of Theology induced by the controversial propositions of Michael Baius, and the propagation of protestant ideas. These experiences would be decisive for his intellectual scholarship and participation in the religious issues that arose throughout his career, such as the Galileo affair, the Venetian Interdict and the Oath of Allegiance. Upon his return to Rome in 1576, Bellarminus occupied the Chair of Controversies at the Collegium Romanum until 1589. In the meantime, he remained in close contact with Louvain through letters with Leonardus Lessius, who had asked Bellarminus to intervene in the doctrinal disputes between the Faculty of Theology and the Jesuits. In 1599, while his health became more and more delicate, Bellarminus was appointed to the rank of cardinal in Rome, but three years later he was reassigned to the position of Archbishop of Capua. After his death in 1621, Bellarminus’ well-known provocative theory on the indirect power of the Pope continued to fuel many debates on papal authority.\n\nRead more\n\nFind items in Lovaniensia\n\nNicolaus Biesius (1516-1576)\n\nNicolas van Biesen studied arts and medicine in Louvain, Valencia and Siena.

Since 1515, due to the absence of Adrianus Florentius (Adrianus VI), Jean Briart also acted as vice-chancellor of the university.\n\nRead more\n\nFind items in Lovaniensia\n\nFrançois Buisseret (1549-1619)\n\nBuisseret first studied at the Collège de Houdain at Mons. Afterwards, he was an arts student at the Pedagogy of the Lily, where he was the second of his year in 1569. He then studied canon and civil law, and theology in Louvain. From 1571 onwards, he was also a professor at the Pedagogy of the Lily. In 1574 he obtained the degree of Licentiate in Canon and Civil Law, and became canon in Cambrai. In 1601 he was appointed Bishop in Namur, where he stayed for fourteen years, before being installed as Archbishop of Cambrai in 1615.\n\nRead more\n\nFind items in Lovaniensia\n\nJoannes Campensis (1491-1538)\n\nJoannes Campensis was educated in theology at the Faculty of Theology and Hebrew at the Collegium Trilingue before taking up a professor's position in Hebrew at the same college in 1520. Before starting his lectures in October 1521, he went to Germany for a year to further improve his knowledge of Hebrew. In 1528 he published the first printed Hebrew grammar textbook at the Collegium Trilingue, after the grammatical model of the Jewish grammarian Elia Levita (1469-1549). After leaving Louvain in 1531, he went on to teach Hebrew in Kraków, Venice and Rome. In September 1538, Campensis died of the plague in Freiburg-im-Breisgau.\n\nRead more\n\nFind items in Lovaniensia\n\nPetrus Castellanus (1585-1632)\n\nPetrus Castellanus (du Chastel of Van Kasteel), a native from Geraardsbergen, studied philosophy in Douai and law in Orléans. In Orléans, he also taught himself with Greek. He then started his career as a Professor of Greek in Douai, in combination with studies in canon and civil law. In 1609, he was appointed Professor of Greek at the Collegium Trilingue, a teaching position he combined with his study of medicine, which eventually resulted in him acquiring the degree of Doctor of Medicine in 1618. One year earlier, he had published a biography of physicians from antiquity until the 16th century, titled Vitae illustrium medicorum qui toto orbe, ad haec usque tempora floruerunt (1617). The copy of this book kept at KU Leuven Libraries was once owned by the prominent physician Henri Joseph Rega (Special Collections, shelfmark CaaA2142).\n\nRead more\n\nFind items in Lovaniensia\n\nNatalis Chamart (1621-1699)\n\nNatalis Chamart was born in the night of 24 to 25 December 1621, which is the reason why the newly born got the name Natalis. He studied canon and civil law in Louvain and later became Professor of Law at the same university. From 1656 till 1669, he was president of Saint Ivo’s College, which provided accommodation for (mainly) law students. In February 1666, he served as rector of the university for six months (i.e. the usual term).\n\nRead more\n\nFind items in Lovaniensia\n\nNicolaus Clenardus (1493-1542)\n\nNicolas Cleynaerts was born in Diest in 1493 and started his studies in Louvain in 1512 at the pedagogy the Pig. In 1515 he became magister artium and went on to study Theology. Not having had any close relations with Erasmus, he never officially taught at the Collegium Trilingue. His studies in Greek and Hebrew led him to publish a couple of handbooks on Latin, Greek and Hebrew, before he took an interest in Arabic, with the goal for peacefully converting Muslims through learning and insight. In November 1532 he was invited to Seville by Ferdinand Colón, son of Christopher Columbus, for the organisation of the Bibliotheca Colombina. After this he was offered the chair for the study of Latin and Greek at the university of Salamanca. In 1533 he became the praeceptor (tutor) to the Cardinal-Infante Henrique in Portugal. In 1538 he undertook a journey to Fez to gain the knowledge and understanding of Muslim culture necessary for the founding of a college for young missionaries to Muslim countries. However, because of his sympathy for the Arabic culture, he felt out of grace with the Spanish and Portuguese authorities and he had to leave Fez, dying in Granada in 1542, where he was buried in the Alhambra. His innovative teaching methods resulted in him being called a 'pioneer of three-language didactics'.\n\nRead more\n\nFind items in Lovaniensia\n\nHenricus Cuyckius (1546-1609)\n\nHenricus Van Cuyck or Cuyckius studied in Utrecht and in Louvain.

Later, after several ecclesiastical positions in Antwerp (1714-1718) and Ypres (1718-1721), Danes obtained his doctorate in Theology at the University of Louvain in 1726. In 1730, he became ordinarius and in 1732 Royal Professor in Scholastics, president of the Viglius College and regent of the Faculty of Theology.

From 1683 till 1689 he taught theology at the Schola Augustiniana, which was incorporated in the University of Louvain, and in 1689 he became Regius Professor of History at the Collegium Trilingue, which created a conflict with Gautius, the Professor of Latin at the same institution, because until then the position of Professor of History had always been taken up by a Professor of Latin.\n\nDesirant was a theologian who followed the Catholic orthodoxy in a very strict manner and was also the author of more than thirty publications.\n\nRead more\n\nFind items in Lovaniensia\n\nJoannes Despauterius (1480-1520) Born around 1478 or 1479, Joannes Despauterius (Despauter) enrolled at the University of Louvain on 31 August 1498.

Immediately afterwards, he started teaching Latin at the Pedagogy of the Lily, until 1505. After a short spell in Ieper in the years 1505-1506/1507, Despauterius started teaching in Komen, before moving to Sint-Winoksbergen (Bergues), where he was appointed rector of the local Latin school (1509-1514). He eventually returned to Komen, where he died in 1520. Throughout his life, Despauterius published several highly popular and influential Latin handbooks.

Between 1510 and 1515, he also studied theology. Dorpius was a young humanistically inspired theologian who was torn between the new biblical-humanist principles cherished at the Louvain Pedagogy of the Lily on the one hand, and his loyalty to the Faculty of Theology on the other hand, where a traditional – scholastic – theology was still dominant. This (inner) conflict gave rise to his becoming embroiled in a celebrated and much discussed debate with Erasmus (with Thomas More as a third party). After having graduated as a Doctor in Theology, the Faculty admitted Dorpius to its Council on 30 August 1515. He became president of the H. Spirit College, the collegium theologorum (on 4 September) and, on 30 September he was granted the right to teach at the faculty. Convinced by Erasmus’ writings, Dorpius daringly expressed his preference for biblical-humanist studies in the opening lecture of his summer course on the Epistles of Paul in July 1516, without, however, scorning ‘good’ scholastics – a stance which must keep scholars alert for all nuances in the humanist-scholastic debate of these days. The printed versions of the Oratio Paulina (1519 and 1520 [2x]), as well as Dorpius’ ambiguous position with regard to Louvain’s condemnation of Luther (7 November 1519), caused him much trouble in the university milieu, not least with his colleagues at the Louvain Faculty of Theology.\n\nThis animosity towards Dorp eventually ebbed away, possibly because he refrained from publishing controversial writings for the rest of his short career – he died in 1525, at scarcely 40 years old – and thus he returned into the bosom of the corpus of Louvain theologians.\n\nRead more\n\nFind items in Lovaniensia\n\nJoannes Driedo (1480-1535)\n\nJohannes or John Nys was born in 1479 or 1480 in the hamlet of Darisdonck, near Turnhout. He was first educated in the Augustinian monastery of Korsendonk, before starting his studies at the Pedagogy of the Falcon in Louvain in 1491, graduating, as primus of his year, as magister artium in 1499. After that he became a lecturer (legens) there, before starting his studies in theology, stimulated to that end by Adrian of Utrecht. He became a Doctor and a Professor in Theology in 1512. A year earlier, Driedo was also appointed president of a new college for theology students from Hoogstraten and Turnhout, called “Houterlee College”. Driedo would remain president of this college for a period of ten years. He was appointed rector of the St.-James’ Church at Louvain, although it remains unclear whether he had already assumed this ministry in 1512 or only after 1521 when he had resigned as president of Houterlee College. Either way, he was active at St.-James’ parish until his death. In 1520 he succeeded his colleague Godscalc Rosemondt to a secondary prebend at St.-Peter’s in Louvain. A short time before his death he was nominated to become the successor of Nicolas Coppinas as primary canon in the same church.\n\nAt the Louvain Faculty of Theology, Driedo was known as a competent and inspired teacher. He was critizicing the humanists for their too optimistic belief in humans' possibilities after the Fall but it was mainly the upcoming causa Lutheri, which would demand his attention and energy. In 1520 he was preparing a book against Luther’s theses, yet the work was never published due to the refusal of printer-editor Dirk Martens. Later on, Erasmus repeatedly expressed regret that Driedo’s book had been suppressed since he had become convinced of the scholarly qualities of the Louvain theologian, who always built on solid arguments, and of his respect for Luther as a person. Driedo did not have any publications until 1533 when the first edition of De ecclesiasticis scripturis et dogmatibus appeared.\n\nDriedo served as dean of the Faculty of Theology several times and was rector of the university in the spring of 1518 and in the spring of 1533. He died in Louvain in 1535.\n\nRead more*\n\nFind items in Lovaniensia\n\nNicolas du Bois (ca 1620 - 1696)\n\nAfter the early death of his parents, Nicolas du Bois started begging to finance his studies. With the help of some bourgeois benefactors, he became a bursary student at the College of Houdain (Mons). Afterwards, he went to Louvain where he finished his arts education in 1641 at the Pedagogy of the Pig. He then started both law (licentiate in 1645) and theology (licentiate in 1654 in Douai) studies. By 1654 he had already been appointed Chair of the H. Scripture in Louvain, where he proved himself to be an anti-jansenist. He also occupied several other positions, including the presidency of the Royal College from 1672 onwards. In 1689 he was appointed dean of Saint Peter’s, and, as such, vice-chancellor of the university.

At the beginning of the 16th century, he travelled a lot, with some shorter and longer stays in Louvain in between his travels, before establishing himself at the Pedagogy of the Lily in 1517 as a counsellor of Emperor Charles V. He stayed in Louvain till 1521, when he left the Netherlands for Basel, because of major disagreements with some theologians in Louvain. During his last stay, he was matriculated at the University of Louvain, but he always refused a post as a professor.

Ten years later, he became professor at the same pedagogy. Estius studied at the Faculty of Theology of Louvain at a time of great controversy regarding the interplay between grace, free will, and predestination in the process of salvation, thereby also debating about the right interpretation of Augustine. As a student he was strongly involved in the preparation of the magisterial Augustine edition which was eventually published by the Louvain theologians in 1576-77. However, in 1582, Estius had to leave the University of Louvian as it threatened to succumb to circumstances of war and plague. He then joined the Faculty of Theology at the University of Douai, where he was among the principal authors of the censure issued against the Louvain Jesuits Leonard Lessius and John Hamelius in 1588.\n\nEstius was a skilful exegete, mastering the original biblical languages and focusing on the literal sense of Scripture, but he combined these with an adherence to a strict anti-Pelagian Augustino-Thomistic doctrine and a rigorist moral theology. Estius’ denial of sufficient grace, his emphasis on efficacious grace and the same’s irresistibility already foreshadowed the heated debates which would dominate the “Jansenist” controversy in the decades to come. Estius died in Douai in 1613. After “Jansenism” had been condemned, Estius’ successors in Douai did not hesitate to point out the extracts in his work that needed rectification.\n\nRead more*\n\nFind items in Lovaniensia\n\nNicolaus Everardus (1462-1532)\n\nNicolaas Everaerts was born in Grijpskerke (near Middelburg) in 1462.

He subsequently studied arts at the Pedagogy of the Falcon in Louvain. He then taught philosophy in the Premonstratensian Abbey of Antwerp for three years (1606-1609) before returning to Louvain, where he first taught literature and later philosophy (in particular of mathematics, physics and astronomy) at his old pedagogy. During this time, Fromondus also studied theology, obtaining the title of Doctor in 1628. In 1626, he had already received a canonry at Tournai Cathedral as such a prebend was a prerequisite for being granted a doctoral degree. In the months following the completion of his doctorate, Fromondus continued to share a big house in Louvain with Cornelius Jansenius, their “nouvelle Sorbonne”, where both men devoted themselves to the study of the sacred languages Greek and Hebrew and the Church fathers, in particular Augustine. After Jansenius had been appointed Royal Professor of Sacred Scriptures in 1630, Fromondus succeeded him as an ordinary professor, which only required him to teach a six-week course during holidays, and as such he was also able to become a canon of St.-Peter’s Church in Louvain. In addition, he became a lecturer of theology in Park Abbey, once again expressing his fondness for the Premonstratensians, with whom he had already become acquainted at St.-Michael’s Abbey in Antwerp.\n\nAfter Cornelius Jansenius was appointed Bishop of Ypres, Fromondus’ career took a new turn: he left Park Abbey to become president of Craendonck College in Louvain, and eventually succeeded Jansenius as Professor of Sacred Scriptures in January 1637. In November 1639, Fromondus became dean of St-Peters’ Church in Louvain and, in this capacity, vice-chancellor of the university. In 1640, Fromondus exchanged Craendonck College for the Collège de Liège, a seminary for intended priests from the prince-bishopric of Liège, where he remained president until the end of his life.\n\nFromondus was part of a group of like-minded friends who worked on publishing Jansenius’ works posthumously, especially his Tetrateuchus (1639) and Pentateuchus (1641), in addition to the renowned Augustinus (1640). The only biblical work by Fromondus that was published in his lifetime was his Commentary on the Canticle of Canticles (1653). He deliberately added the Divisio animae ac spiritus to it, a work by the mystically endowed Capuchin father Johannes Evangelista of ‘s Hertogenbosch (c. 1588-1635), who lived in the Louvain convent and had a fair amount of contact with Fromondus.

Largely due to the facilities and material support offered by the abbey, Hessels simultaneously continued his own studies at the Faculty of Theology. He was appointed professor at the Faculty in 1554 – and canon of Saint-Peter’s - and awarded the degree of Doctor in Theology in 1556. In 1562, Hessels was ultimately appointed to the Chair of Royal Professor in Scholastic Theology. A few months before taking up the latter position, Hessels had also become the first president of the ‘minor’ College of the Holy Spirit. John Hessels has gained some fame in the history of the university since he is said to have been the likeminded colleague and friend of Michael Baius, advocating a similar theology, characterized by a radical return to the Scriptures and the Church fathers, with Augustine (and his anti-Pelagian writings) taking pride of place. They were both selected as Louvain’s representatives at the Council of Trent (Summer 1563 – Spring 1564). Hessels’ thorough familiarity with the works of Augustine became evident through his questioning the authenticity of some works attributed to the Church father, included in Erasmus’ Opera Omnia Augustini (1528-29), thus giving an early impetus for a new edition of Augustine’s works in the Louvain theological milieu, which would eventually be published in 1576-77. By then Hessels had already passed away at the youthful age of 44 (1566).\n\nRead more\n\nFind items in Lovaniensia\n\nJoachimus Hopperus (1523-1576)\n\nHopperus was born in Sneek in 1523.

Shortly afterwards, Hunnaeus was appointed as the president of St Anne’s College. After receiving his doctorate in Theology in 1558, Hunnaeus was appointed Royal Professor of Scholastic Theology. Although never officially appointed as a professor, he taught Greek and Hebrew at the Collegium Trilingue for several years, substituting Theodoricus Langius and Andreas Balenus, respectively. Hunnaeus became rector of the university in the spring of 1563. At the same time he also left Saint-Anna College for the H. Spirit College, he presided over that college at least until 1575.

At the University of Louvain, he studied arts and theology, while devoting himself to the study of Greek and Hebrew at the Collegium trilingue. He lived at the H. Spirit College (1526-39). He then left Louvain to come back ca. 1561. He was awarded the degree of Doctor of Theology in 1562, and subsequently appointed Ordinary Professor of Theology. He was granted a prebendaryship at the chapter of the second foundation in the Collegiate Church of St. Peter in Louvain. In January 1563 he also became president of the ‘major’ College of the Holy Spirit, only to be sent to the Council of Trent barely a month later, in the company of his colleagues Baius and Hessels (Summer 1563 – Spring 1564). On his return to the Low Countries, he was appointed as the first Bishop of Ghent. However, due to the revolt in the Low Countries he did not take possession of his episcopal see until September 1568; in the intervening period he was able to further the redaction of some of his foremost Bible commentaries. In 1571-72 Jansenius’ most famous publication left the presses of the Louvain printer-publisher Petrus Zangrius, viz. Commentaria in suam Concordiam ac totam historiam evangelicam. In his commentaries on his earlier gospel harmony, Jansenius built on a study of the Greek ‘original’ and the variants in the Latin manuscript tradition, while also taking into consideration the context of the pericope, as well as other literary techniques, in order to achieve his primary aim, viz. to discern the so-called scopus of the parable, the intention of Christ and that of the inspired author.\n\nRead more*Find items in Lovaniensia\n\nCornelius Jansenius (II), said ‘of Ypres’ (1585-1638)\n\nCornelius Jansenius was born into a Catholic family in Holland, studied arts at the Pedagogy of the Falcon in Louvain and graduated as a magister artium, having passed, ranked first, the general examinations of the four pedagogies of the Arts Faculty. He studied theology whilst residing in the Pope’s College. Having obtained the degree of Bachelor of Theology in 1609, Jansenius left Louvain for Paris, where he hoped to find a university milieu that was more oriented towards the skillful study of the sources of theology. More specifically, Jansenius studied Hebrew and possibly also Greek in Paris. He also became close friends with Jean Duvergier de Hauranne, “the abbot of Saint-Cyran,” who was to have a profound influence on Jansenius and the “Jansenist” movement.\n\nAfter the death of his father in early 1617, Jansenius was retained in Louvain and entrusted with the governance of the newly established Sancta Pulcheria College, a college intended for clerical students from the diocese of Haarlem in Holland. Jansenius again matriculated at the University of Louvain, obtaining the degree of Doctor of Theology in October 1617. Only half a year later, he received an Ordinary Chair of Theology at the university and an attached canonry in St. Peter in Louvain. In addition to his work as an ordinary professor, Jansenius also taught some extraordinary courses in the Pulcheria College, e.g., on Thomas Aquinas or a Hebrew language course.\n\nIn Louvain, the issue of predestination, grace and free will had regained momentum in the years 1618-19, as the old controversy between the Faculty of Theology and the Jesuit Leonard Lessius flared up again. Jansenius set himself the objective of studying Augustine, since as a result of the famous “Congregationes de auxiliis” (1597-1607), the Pope had not only imposed silence on the discussion of grace and free will – after decades of passionate debate in the Catholic Church – but had also made Augustine, the “doctor gratiae”, the arbiter in the matter. Jansenius tended towards a denial of sufficient grace, emphasizing the efficiency of grace for those who were predestined to receive its aids, as well as the impossibility of the elect to resist – ideas liable to a later papal condemnation.\n\nIn 1624 Jansenius had just obtained a prebend in Lille when he was entrusted by the University of Louvain with a special mission to the Spanish court – in that period, he also laid down the presidency of Pulcheria College. After Jansenius had returned from his mission, he went to Paris to continue his studies with Saint-Cyran again, which he had abandoned several years earlier. His study was abruptly interrupted when he was again sent to Madrid, because in 1625 Philip III had established an extraordinary chair within the Louvain theological faculty for the Jesuits, a decision that had met with vehement opposition from the Louvain theologians who mostly belonged to the secular clergy. In Madrid, Jansenius was able to obtain a decision that was favorable to the Faculty of Theology.\n\nAfter Jansenius’ return to Louvain during Lent 1627, he resumed his personal studies. On 23 March 1630, Jansenius was promoted to the Royal Chair of Sacred Scriptures – his knowledge of Greek and Hebrew, although elementary, playing an important part in the consideration. In 1631 Jansenius also returned to the Pulcheria College as provisor.\n\nBeing appointed Bishop of Ypres in October 1635, Jansenius was only able to take possession of his episcopal see the following year. After Jansenius had succumbed to the plague in Ypres (1638), his scriptural works were published posthumously by his friends Henry Calenus and Libertus Fromondus, the latter also being his successor to the Royal Chair of Sacred Scriptures. The most important was the publication, in 1640, of his historical-theological work, the Augustinus, which was foundational for the “Jansenist movement” and would be liable to subsequent papal censures.\n\nRead more*\n\nFind items in Lovaniensia\n\nJacobus Janssonius (1547-1625)\n\nJanssonius, born in Amsterdam, resided in the Pope’s College as a student, which was then presided by Michael Baius.

Janssonius became rector of the university in the fall of the next year and in 1598, he was appointed the Royal Chair of the Holy Scripture. From 1614 until 1616, he was the vice-chancellor of the university. In 1616, an illness forced him to resign.\n\nAs Professor of Theology, he was profoundly entangled in academic politics, and became one of the driving forces behind the 1587 Louvain censure of the Jesuit Lessius’ theological model of grace and free will. As holder of the Royal Chair of Holy Scripture, he published various commentaries, viz. his commentary on the Song of Songs (1596; repr. 1603 and 1605), an Expositio or explanation of the Psalms and the cantica that were sung during the office (1597; repr. 1617; rev. version 1610, 1611 and 1622), a commentary on the book of Job (1623), as well as his masterpiece, the In Evangelium S. Joannis expositio, an explanation of the Gospel of John that was inspired by the extensive treatise that Augustine had also devoted to this Gospel. Although the work was completed in 1625, Jansonius’ death delayed its appearance until 1630, when it was published as a posthumous testimony to his sustained Augustinianism.\n\nRead more\n\nFind items in Lovaniensia\n\nJoannes Gerardus Kerkherdere (1677-1738)\n\nKerkherdere, a native from Valkenburg in Limburg, obtained his first education in Maastricht.

In 1499-1500, Latomus followed Johannes Standonck to Louvain, after the latter had been banished from Paris. Once again he joined Standonck’s community for “poor students”, which in Louvain was connected to the so-called Pedagogy of the Pig. Jacobus Latomus, who had finished his arts studies in Paris, gave courses to the students of the Pedagogy. There are indications that Latomus taught Latin rhetoric at the Pedagogy of the Pig, indicating that he may not have been the fossilized representative of the old scholastic regime in Louvain, as he has often been depicted. He acted as president of Standonck College between 1502 and 1505. While teaching at the Pedagogy of the Pig, he studied theology at the Louvain Faculty, which perhaps was only a continuation of studies he had already begun in Paris. In 1510, Latomus received his Licentiate in Theology.\n\nOn 16 August 1519, Latomus earned his doctoral degree. After his doctorate, he became professor legens et regens at the Faculty of Theology. He also became a member of the strict college, the Council of the Faculty. Nevertheless, he was not yet professor ordinarius, and hence did not have the privilege to give lectures during the academic year. Latomus gave his lectures during the holidays. He was also dean of the Faculty during the years 1520, 1526, and 1529. Not only was Latomus involved in the controversy with Erasmus and his adherents, his theological career was also particularly marked by the controversy with Luther.\n\nIn 1526, Latomus had received a benefice as canon of Our Lady’s Church in Cambrai, obviously a token of recognition by the Bishop of Cambrai Robrecht van Croÿ, who wanted to thank his former preceptor. In accordance with his own principles regarding the residence of the clergy, Latomus resided principally in Cambrai from the summer of 1529. He only returned to Louvain in 1535 after he had succeeded Johannes Driedo as professor ordinarius. At the same time, he also received a prebend of the first order at St. Peter’s Church in Louvain. In 1537, Latomus held the office of rector of the university. On 29 May 1544, Jacobus Latomus died in Louvain.\n\nRead more*Find items in Lovaniensia\n\nJosse Le Plat (1732-1810)\n\nLe Plat obtained the degree of Licentiate in Canon and Civil Law in 1756 and a doctorate in the same field ten years later.

He obtained the degree of Licentiate in Canon and Civil Law in 1547, taught canon law in Louvain as of 1549 and got his doctorate in both laws in 1550. In 1560, he obtained the first Chair in Civil Law (primarius legum). Apart from his teaching activities, Leoninus was also active as a learned counsellor: in 1583, one hundred consilia have been printed with Plantin in Antwerp. He also served as a diplomat, particularly from 1574 onwards, among others as a representative of the Spanish crown in the negotiations with the Prince of Orange, with whom Leoninus was on friendly terms. In 1577, he was appointed as a member of the Council of State. In 1576, Leoninus had to step down from his professoral position, probably at least in part because he signed the Pacification of Ghent in 1576. After his retreat, he became chancellor of Gueldria in 1581 and offered his resignation as Councillor of State. From 1586 till 1595, however, he became a member of the new Council of State erected by the Count of Leicester.

He lived in Flanders his whole life, except for the year he studied at the Collegium Romanum, in Rome. He taught Philosophy in Douai and Theology in Louvain, at the Jesuit College. As a Professor of Theology, he preached a doctrine of salvation, with a very strong focus on the value and role of free will and human agency in the salvation process and in the process of inspiration by the Scriptures, even at the expense of God’s sovereign authority. In 1587, the professors of the Faculty of Theology at the University of Louvain charged Lessius’s doctrine as Pelagian and Semi-Pelagian. The so-called Louvain controversies (an anticipation of the De Auxiliis dispute) started, the pope became involved, but eventually no condemnations were made.\n\nLessius was an eclectic scholar and dealt with several other topics as well, ranging from counter-Reformation matters to morality (especially moral economy) to health and diet.\n\nAn exponent of Christian Humanism and a follower of the major principles taught within the School of Salamanca, Lessius was very tolerant and open-minded toward other people, but extremely strict with himself. His first printed hagiography even claims that he had mystical experiences. Considered by his confreres as a holy man, he became an object of devotion after his death in January 1623. A cause for beatification was opened but has not made any progress since the first half of the 1900s. Lessius’s remains, after having been rediscovered at the turn of the twentieth century, are preserved in Saint Michael’s Church, in Louvain.\n\nRead more\n\nFind items in Lovaniensia\n\nJoannes Libens (1675-1747)\n\nLibens was first educated at the Augustine school in Diest.

Two years later, in 1574, Lipsius returned to Louvain, where he studied both Civil and Canon Law. He taught Law from 1576 until 1578. In that year, Lipsius travelled to Leiden where he became professor of History and Law, was rector of the university for four years and wrote his most important works (De constantia, Politica, …). Lipsius became professor of history and Latin at the University of Louvain in September 1592 and in 1595, he became the royal historiographer of king Philip II of Spain. Lipsius was one of the main figures of humanism in the Low Countries in the 16th century, mostly in the fields of Textual Criticism and ancient Roman Philosophy.

Ordained a priest in 1680, he began teaching Greek at the Collegium Trilingue shortly afterwards – succeeding Jean de Hamere – while continuing his theological studies. In the 1680s and 90s, he took a strong stand against Jansenism but he later changed his mind. He obtained his doctoral degree in 1688 and left the university to teach at the Great Seminary in Mechelen – where he was considered controversial – before returning to Louvain in 1694 as Professor of Theology and canon of St. Peter.\n\nHis Jansenist positions, however, led to his exclusion from the Grand College (1713) and a temporary ban on teaching (1720).

At Louvain, he obtained a master’s degree in Theology in 1740 and a doctoral degree in 1745. He remained in Louvain, where he taught at the Augustinian convent from 1742 onwards and at the university's Faculty of Theology as of 1747.\n\nAlmost all of Joseph Maugis' writings are controversial, as they mainly include disputes with the Jesuit Father Wautyer (1743 to 1761), with the Dominican Father Billuart (1752 to 1756) and with the canonist of the university Josse le Plat (1770 to 1771).\n\nRead more\n\nFind items in Lovaniensia\n\nJoannes Molanus (1533-1585)\n\nJean Molanus (Vermeulen or Van der Meulen) was born in Lille in 1533.

Together with other members of his faculty, he took part in the negotiations that prepared the Pacification of Ghent in 1576. He renewed the literary genre of hagiography in the new critical spirit that the Bollandists were to develop. He is credited with publications denouncing the destructions during the iconoclastic crisis, but also with a letter, signed as dean, protesting against the exactions of the Duke of Alba's troops.

He enrolled at the University of Louvain on 2 November 1518. Apart from his courses at the Faculty of Arts, Nannius was also drawn in by the recently founded Collegium Trilingue. During the 1520s and the early years of the 1530s, Nannius was active as a teacher and rector of the Latin schools of Gouda and Alkmaar. In those years, he was also ordained a priest. By the winter of 1534, he had returned to Louvain. In that period he earned a living as a private teacher, mainly of Greek. A great increase in his scholarly and literary output then, combined with the acquisition of wealthy patrons, led to his appointment as the successor of Conrad Goclenius as the Professor of Latin at the Collegium Trilingue in 1539.\n\nHis output can be divided into three categories: First, editions of and philological commentaries on (mainly) Latin authors. Secondly, Latin translations of Greek texts, most importantly by Greek Early Christian authors, such as Athenagoras and Athanasius the Great. Thirdly, literary works of his own, e.g. a Latin comedy, titled Vinctus (‘Bound’), or his popular Dialogismi Heroinarum (‘Monologues of Admirable Ladies’), of which a French translation was issued in 1550.\n\nRead more\n\nFind items in Lovaniensia\n\nCornelis Franciscus Nelis (1736-1798) Cornelis Franciscus Nelis was the son of a lawyer of the Grand Council of Mechelen.

He continued his theological studies while starting a career in Louvain: university librarian in 1755 (granted tenure in 1758), president of the Mechelen College in 1757 and canon of St. Peter in 1759. In 1760, the year of his ordination, he obtained a master’s degree in Theology.\n\nHe then began an honorary course in the Church: canon of Tournai Cathedral (1763), coadjutor of Tournai (1776) and finally Bishop of Antwerp (1777).\n\nHis special relationship with Patrice François de Neny, president of the Privy Council and commissioner in charge of the reforms of the university, enabled him to create the Academic Press in Louvain and to institute a first form of legal deposit. He resigned as university librarian in 1768, following some disputes over the library’s policy. In 1769 he was appointed as a member of the Literary Society and planned the large-scale production of historical texts.\n\nHis relations with the Austrian state deteriorated, especially around the possible establishment of the General Seminar in Louvain. In 1790, he was chosen by acclamation as the first President of the Estates General of the United Belgian States (1790). The Austrian restoration and then the French annexation forced him into exile. After a few stopovers in Leiden, at German universities and in Switzerland, he settled in Italy (Bologna, Rome and Florence) where he devoted himself to historical work.

In 1633, he was appointed Royal Professor at the Faculty of Medicine, responsible for the teaching of the Institutiones according to the first book of the Canon of Avicenna. He published his syllabus in 1638, under the title Fundamenta seu Institutiones Medicinae. In the first edition he refuted the theory of blood circulation discovered by Harvey, which put him at odds with Descartes, before changing his mind in the second edition in 1644. In 1634 Plempius obtained the Chair of Primary Professor of Practical Medicine. He served as rector for four terms, i.e. 1634 (fall), 1637 (spring), 1647 (spring) and 1649 (fall).\n\nRead more*\n\nFind items in Lovaniensia\n\nErycius Puteanus (1574-1646)\n\nErycius Puteanus (de Put), from Venlo, enrolled at the University of Louvain in 1595, after having obtained his Master of Arts degree at the University of Cologne.

He went into exile in Louvain in 1559 due to Elizabeth I's persecution of Catholics. He studied theology there and also spent a period in Paris to perfect his knowledge of the sacred tongues.\n\nIn 1569 he moved to Douai, where he promptly matriculated at the university and began to lecture on theology. Stapleton obtained a doctorate in 1571 and was subsequently appointed professor, first on the Chair of Catechism, but soon on that of Controversialist Theology. He entered the novitiate of the Jesuits in 1585, but at the age of fifty his health was unable to sustain the harsh discipline and he left the order a year later to resume his former offices. However, Stapleton continued to maintain a warm relationship with the Jesuits.\n\nIn the summer of 1590, King Philip II signed a letter appointing the 55-year-old Stapleton to be Royal Professor of Sacred Scriptures in Louvain. In this function, Stapleton gave priority to the literal sense of the biblical text, but he also sought to put forward the correct interpretation of the text, considered in light of the ongoing controversies of his age. As a genuine controversialist, he attempted to repudiate the scriptural interpretations of Calvin and his so-called ‘lackey’ Theodore Beza. Stapleton was rector in 1595. In January 1597 Stapleton accepted the offer of a proto-notaryship in Rome and prepared to commence his new life at the papal court. However, Stapleton’s leave from Louvain, as well as the requested travel allowance, was delayed, and his health deteriorated. Stapleton never moved to Rome; he died on 12 October 1598 in Louvain.\n\nRead more*\n\nFind items in Lovaniensia\n\nMartinus Steyaert (1647-1701)\n\nAfter his humanities studies with the Augustinians in Ghent, Steyaert trained in Louvain at the Faculty of Arts (graduated in 1665) and then studied for four years at the Faculty of Theology, while also teaching at the Pedagogy of the Castle as sub-regent.
