        "text": "PONTIFICAL COUNCIL FOR LEGISLATIVE TEXTS\n\nINSTRUCTION\n\nTO BE OBSERVED BY DIOCESAN AND INTERDIOCESAN TRIBUNALS\n\nIN HANDLING CAUSES\n\nOF THE NULLITY OF MARRIAGE\n\nDIGNITAS CONNUBII\n\nThe dignity of marriage, which between the baptised “is the image of and the participation in the covenant of love between Christ and the Church”(1), demands that the Church with the greatest pastoral solicitude promote marriage and the family founded in marriage, and protect and defend them with all the means available.\n\nThe Second Vatican Council not only presented the doctrine on the dignity of marriage and the family(2) using new concepts and renewed terminology, and developed it by exploring more deeply their Christian and properly human aspects, but also prepared a correct path for further doctrinal perspectives and laid renewed foundations upon which the revision of the Code of Canon Law could be based.\n\nThese new perspectives, which are commonly called ‘‘personalist'', offered much for the progressive development of certain values in a doctrine which was commonly accepted and quite often proposed by the Magisterium in a variety of ways, values which by their nature offer much to assist the institution of marriage and the family in attaining those highest ends which were destined for it by God the Creator by a marvelous plan and given to it by Christ the Redeemer with a spousal love(3).\n\nIt is evident that marriage and the family is not a private matter that each person can construct at will. The Council itself, which so extols whatever pertains to the dignity of the human person, aware that the social dimension of man belongs to this dignity, does not fail to point out that marriage by its nature is an institution founded by the Creator and endowed by his laws(4), and that its essential properties are unity and indissolubility, “which in a Christian marriage by reason of the sacrament obtain a particular firmness” (can. 1056).\n\nFrom all this it follows that the juridic dimension of marriage is not and cannot be conceived as something “juxtaposed as something foreign to the interpersonal reality of marriage, but constitutes a truly intrinsic dimension of it”(5), as is affirmed explicitly in the doctrine of the Church beginning with Saint Paul, as Saint Augustine observes: “The Apostle attributes so much of a right to this fidelity [of the covenant of marriage] that he calls it a power, saying ‘a wife does not have power over her own body but rather her husband does, likewise a husband does not have power over his body, but rather his wife does' (1 Cor 7, 4)”(6). Therefore, as John Paul II affirms, “in a vision of authentic personalism, the Church's teaching implies the affirmation that marriage can be established as an indissoluble bond between the persons of the spouses, a bond essentially ordered to the good of the spouses themselves and of their children”(7).\n\nTo this doctrinal progress in the understanding of the institution of marriage there is added in our day a progress in the human sciences, especially the psychological and psychiatric ones which, since they offer a deeper understanding of the human person, can offer much help for a fuller understanding of those things which are required in the human person in order that he or she be capable of entering the conjugal covenant. The Roman Pontiffs, since Pius XII(8), while they called attention to the dangers to be encountered if in this area mere hypotheses, not scientifically proved, were to be taken for scientifically acquired data, always encouraged and exhorted scholars of matrimonial canonical law and ecclesiastical judges not to hesitate to transfer for the advantage of their own science certain conclusions, founded in a sound philosophy and Christian anthropology, which those sciences had offered in the course of time(9).\n\nThe new Code promulgated on 25 January 1983 attempted not only to translate “into ‘canonical' language”(10) the renewed vision of marriage and the family which the Council presented, but also to gather together the legislative, doctrinal and jurisprudential progress which in the meanwhile had taken place in both substantial and procedural law, of which is especially relevant here the Apostolic Letter given Motu proprio of Paul VI, Causas matrimoniales of 28 March 1971, which, “while a fuller reform of matrimonial procedure was awaited” provided some norms by which the process itself was rendered more rapid(11), which norms for the most part were incorporated into the promulgated Code.\n\nHowever, the new Code followed the same method as the Code of 1917, in regard to the matrimonial process for the declaration of nullity. In the special part De processibus matrimonialibus, it gathers together in one chapter the particular norms proper to this process (cann. 1671-1691), while the other prescriptions which govern the entire process are found in the general part De iudicibus in genere (cann. 1400-1500) and De iudicio contentioso (cann. 1501-1655), with the result that the procedural path which the judges and ministers of the tribunal are bound to follow in causes for the declaration of the nullity of marriage is not found in one and the same continuous tract. The difficulties which follow from this in han- dling causes of this nature are obvious in themselves and judges admit to experiencing them continuously, all the more so because the canons on trials in general and on the ordinary contentious trial are only to be applied “unless the nature of the matter prevents this” and also “without prejudice to the special norms concerning causes of the status of persons and causes concerning the public good” (can. 1691).\n\nIn regard to the Code of 1917, since these difficulties were encountered, the Sacred Congregation for the Discipline of the Sacraments issued the instruction Provida Mater on 15 August 1936(12), with the stated intention “of providing for the same causes to be instructed and decided more quickly and more securely”. In regard to the method and the criteria employed, the instruction organized the material by gathering together the canons, the jurisprudence and the praxis of the Roman Curia.\n\nAfter the Code was promulgated in 1983, there appeared a pressing need to prepare an instruction which, following the footsteps of Provida Mater, would be helpful to judges and other ministers of tribunals in properly understanding and applying the renewed matrimonial law, all the more so because the number of causes of the nullity of marriage had increased while, in contrast, the judges and ministers of tribunals were often found to be fewer and entirely unequal to the task of carrying on the work. Nonetheless it also seemed necessary that some time would be allowed to pass before that instruction would be prepared, as had happened after the promulgation of the 1917 Code, so that in preparing the instruction account could be taken of the application of the new matrimonial law in the light of experience, of any authentic interpretations that might be given by the Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts, and also of both doctrinal development and the evolution of jurisprudence, especially that of the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura and the Tribunal of the Roman Rota.\n\nOnce such a suitable period of time had elapsed, the Supreme Pontiff John Paul II, on 24 February 1996, judged it opportune that an interdicasterial Commission be established to prepare, using the same criteria and the same method as in the Instruction Provida Mater, an instruction by which judges and ministers of tribunals might be led by the hand, as it were, in carrying out this sort of work of great importance, namely, in processing causes which pertain to the declaration of the nullity of marriage, avoiding the difficulties which can emerge in the course of a trial even from the manner in which the norms of this process have been distributed throughout the Code.\n\nThe first and second drafts of this instruction were prepared through the cooperation of the Dicasteries concerned, namely, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura, the Tribunal of the Roman Rota and the Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts; Conferences of Bishops were heard as well.\n\nAfter he had studied the work carried out by the Commission, the Roman Pontiff, with a letter dated 4 February 2003, determined that this Pontifical Council, taking into consideration the two drafts previously mentioned, would prepare and publish the definitive text of an instruction concerning the norms in force. This was carried out with the help of a new interdicasterial Commission and in consultation with the Congregations and Apostolic Tribunals concerned.\n\nThe Instruction then has been drafted and published with the intention that it be a help to judges and other ministers of the tribunals of the Church, to whom the sacred ministry of hearing the causes of the nullity of marriage has been entrusted. Thus, the procedural laws of the Code of Canon Law for the declaration of the nullity of marriage remain in their full force and reference is always to be made to them in interpreting the Instruction. However, keeping in mind the proper nature of this kind of process, it is especially important to avoid both a juridical formalism, which is entirely foreign to the spirit of the laws of the Church, and a way of acting that indulges in too great a subjectivism in interpreting and applying both the substantive and the procedural norms(13). Furthermore, in order to achieve in the Church that fundamental unity of jurisprudence which matrimonial causes demand, it is necessary that the tribunals of a lower level look to the Apostolic Tribunals, namely to the Tribunal of the Roman Rota, to which it pertains ‘‘to provide for the unity of jurisprudence'' and ‘‘through its sentences, to be of assistance to lower tribunals'' (Pastor bonus, art. 126), and to the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura, to which it pertains, ‘‘besides the function which it exercises of a Supreme Tribunal'', to provide ‘‘that justice in the Church is properly administered'' (Pastor bonus, art. 121).\n\nIt must be stated that the observation which Provida Mater made is still valid today and is even more urgent now than when that Instruction was issued, namely, “However it must be observed that such rules will be insufficient to achieve their stated purpose unless diocesan judges know the sacred canons thoroughly and are well prepared through an experience of tribunal work''(14).\n\nFor this reason it falls to the Bishops, and this should weigh heavily on their consciences, to see to it that suitable ministers of justice for their tribunals are trained in canon law appropriately and in a timely manner, and are prepared by suitable practice to instruct causes of marriage properly and decide them correctly.\n\nTherefore, the following norms are to be observed by diocesan and interdiocesan tribunals in handling causes of the nullity of marriage:\n\nArt. 1 – § 1. This Instruction concerns only the tribunals of the Latin Church (cf. can. 1).\n\n§ 2. All tribunals are regulated by the procedural law of the Code of Canon Law and by this Instruction, without prejudice to the proper laws of the tribunals of the Apostolic See (cf. can. 1402; Pastor bonus, artt.125; 130).\n\n§ 3. Dispensation from procedural laws is reserved to the Apostolic See (cf. can. 87; Pastor bonus, art. 124, n. 2).\n\nArt. 2 – § 1. A marriage between Catholics, even if only one party is a Catholic, is governed not only by divine law but also by canon law, without prejudice to art. 3, § 3 (cf. can. 1059).\n\n§ 2. A marriage between a Catholic party and a baptized non-Catholic party is governed also:\n\n1o by the proper law of the church or ecclesial community to which the non-Catholic party belongs, if that community has its own marriage law;\n\n2o by the law used by the ecclesial community to which the non-Catholic party belongs, if that community lacks its own marriage law.\n\nArt. 3 – § 1. The matrimonial causes of the baptized pertain by right to the ecclesiastical judge (can. 1671).\n\n§ 2. However, an ecclesiastical judge hears only those causes of the nullity of marriage of non-Catholics, whether baptized or unbaptized, in which it is necessary to establish the free state of at least one party before the Catholic Church, without prejudice to art. 114.\n\n§ 3. Causes concerning the merely civil effects of marriage belong to the civil magistrate, unless particular law provides that those same causes, if they are to be treated incidentally and subordinately, can be heard and decided by an ecclesiastical judge.\n\nArt. 4 – § 1. Whenever an ecclesiastical judge must decide about the nullity of a marriage of baptized non-Catholics:\n\n1o in regard to the law by which the parties were bound at the time of the celebration of the marriage, art. 2, § 2 is to be observed;\n\n2o in regard to the form of celebration of marriage, the Church recognizes any form prescribed or accepted in the Church or ecclesial community to which the parties belonged at the time of the marriage, provided that, if at least one party is a member of a non-Catholic Eastern Church, the marriage was celebrated with a sacred rite.\n\n§ 2. Whenever an ecclesiastical judge must decide about the nullity of a marriage contracted by two unbaptized persons:\n\n1o the cause of nullity is heard according to canonical procedural law;\n\n2o however, the question of the nullity of the marriage is decided, without prejudice to divine law, according to the law by which the parties were bound at the time of the marriage.\n\nArt. 5 – § 1. Causes of the nullity of marriage can be decided only through the sentence of a competent tribunal.\n\n§ 2. However, the Apostolic Signatura enjoys the faculty of deciding by decree cases of the nullity of marriage in which the nullity appears evident; but if they require a more detailed study or investigation the Signatura is to remit them to a competent tribunal or another tribunal, if need be, which is to handle the cause according to the ordinary procedure of the law.\n\n§ 3. However, in order to establish the free state of those who, while bound to observe the canonical form of marriage according to can. 1117, attempted marriage before a civil official or non-Catholic minister, it is sufficient to use the prematrimonial investigation in accordance with cann. 1066-1071(15).\n\nArt. 6 – § 1. Causes for the declaration of the nullity of marriage cannot be handled through the oral process (cf. can. 1690).\n\nArt. 7 – § 1. This Instruction is concerned only with the process for the declaration of the nullity of marriage, and not with the processes for obtaining the dissolution of the marriage bond (cf. cann. 1400, § 1, n. 1; 1697-1706).\n\n§ 2. Therefore the distinction between the declaration of the nullity of a marriage and the dissolution of a marriage must be kept clearly in mind also in regard to terminology.\n\nTitle I\n\nTHE COMPETENT FORUM\n\nArt. 8 – § 1. It is the right of the Roman Pontiff alone to judge causes of the nullity of the marriage of those who hold the highest office of governance of a state, as well as other causes of the nullity of marriage which the same Roman Pontiff has called to his own judgement (cf. can. 1405, § 1, nn. 1, 4).\n\n§ 2. In the causes mentioned in § 1, the incompetence of other judges is absolute (cf. can. 1406, § 2).\n\nArt. 9 – § 1. The incompetence of a judge is also absolute:\n\n1o if the cause is legitimately pending before another tribunal (cf. can. 1512, n. 2);\n\n2o if competence by reason of grade or by reason of matter is not observed (cf. can. 1440).\n\n§ 2. Thus the incompetence of a judge is absolute by reason of grade if the same cause, after a definitive sentence has been issued, is heard again in the same instance, unless the sentence happens to have been declared null; it is absolute by reason of matter if a cause of nullity of marriage is heard by a tribunal which is able to judge only causes of another type.\n\n§ 3. In the case mentioned in § 1, n. 2, the Apostolic Signatura for a just cause can entrust the hearing of the cause to a tribunal otherwise absolutely incompetent (cf. Pastor bonus, art. 124, n. 2).\n\nArt. 10 – § 1. In causes of the nullity of marriage which are not reserved to the Apostolic See and have not been called to it, the following tribunals are competent in the first grade of jurisdiction:\n\n1o the tribunal of the place in which the marriage was celebrated;\n\n2o the tribunal of the place in which the respondent party has a domicile or quasi-domicile;\n\n3o the tribunal of the place in which the petitioning party has a domicile, as long as both parties live in the territory of the same Conference of bishops and the Judicial Vicar of the domicile of the respondent party has given his consent; before doing so, he is to ask the respondent party whether he has any objection to make;\n\n4o the tribunal of the place in which de facto the greater part of the proofs are to be collected, as long as the Judicial Vicar of the domicile of the respondent party has given his consent; before doing so, he is to ask the respondent party whether he has any objection to make (cf. can. 1673).\n\n§ 2. The incompetence of a judge who does not enjoy any of these titles of competence is called relative, without prejudice however to the prescriptions regarding absolute incompetence (cf. can. 1407, § 2).\n\n§ 3. If no exception of relative incompetence is filed before the concordance of the doubt, the judge becomes competent ipso iure, but without prejudice to can. 1457, § 1.\n\n§ 4. In a case of relative incompetence the Apostolic Signatura for a just cause can grant an extension of competence (cf. Pastor bonus, art. 124, n. 3).\n\nArt. 11 – § 1. In order to verify the canonical domicile of the parties and especially their quasi-domicile, as treated in cann. 102-107, in case of doubt a simple declaration of the parties does not suffice, but suitable documents are required, whether civil or ecclesiastical, or if these are lacking, other means of proof.\n\n§ 2. If it is claimed that a quasi-domicile has been acquired by a stay in the territory of some parish or diocese, combined with the intention of remaining there for at least three months, particular care is to be taken to see whether the requirements of can. 102, § 2 have truly been fulfilled.\n\n§ 3. A spouse separated for whatever reason either permanently or for an indefinite time does not follow the domicile of the other spouse (cf. can. 104).\n\nArt. 12 – Once a cause is pending, a change of the domicile or quasi-domicile of the spouses does not remove or suspend the competence of the tribunal (cf. can. 1512, nn. 2, 5).\n\nArt. 13 – § 1. Until the conditions stated in art. 10, § 1, nn. 3-4, have been fulfilled, the tribunal cannot proceed legitimately.\n\n§ 2. In these cases there must be written proof of the consent of the Judicial Vicar of the domicile of the respondent party; such consent cannot be presumed.\n\n§ 3. The prior hearing of the respondent party by his Judicial Vicar can be done either in writing or orally; if done orally, the Vicar is to draw up a document attesting to this.\n\n§ 4. Before giving his consent, the Judicial Vicar of the domicile of the respondent party is to consider carefully all the circumstances of the cause, especially the difficulties of the respondent party in defending himself before the tribunal of the place in which the petitioning party has a domicile or in which the greater part of the proofs are to be collected.\n\n§ 5. The Judicial Vicar of the domicile of the respondent party in this case is not the judicial vicar of an interdiocesan tribunal but rather the diocesan judicial vicar; if in a particular case there is no such Vicar, it is the Diocesan Bishop(16).\n\n§ 6. If the conditions stated in the preceding paragraphs cannot be observed because, after a diligent investigation, it is not known where the respondent party lives, this must be documented in the acts.\n\nArt. 14 – In weighing the question of whether some tribunal is truly that of the place in which the greater part of the proofs is to be collected, one must take into consideration not only those proofs which it is expected that the two parties will propose but also those which should be collected ex officio.\n\nArt. 15 – When a marriage is being challenged because of several different grounds of nullity, those grounds, by reason of connection, are to be considered by one and the same tribunal in the same process (cf. cann. 1407, § 1; 1414).\n\nArt. 16 – § 1. A tribunal of the Latin Church, without prejudice to artt. 8-15, can hear the cause of the nullity of the marriage of Catholics of another Church sui iuris:\n\n1o ipso iure in a territory where, besides the local Ordinary of the Latin Church, there is no other local Hierarch of any other Church sui iuris, or where the pastoral care of the faithful of the Church sui iuris in question has been entrusted to the local Ordinary of the Latin Church by designation of the Apostolic See or at least with its assent (cf. can. 916, § 5, CCEO);\n\n2o in other cases by reason of an extension of competence granted by the Apostolic Signatura whether stably or ad casum.\n\n§ 2. In such case, the tribunal of the Latin Church must proceed according to its own procedural law, but the question of the nullity of marriage is to be decided according to the laws of the Church sui iuris to which the parties belong.\n\nArt. 17 – In regard to the competence of tribunals in the second or higher grade of jurisdiction, articles 25 and 27 are to be observed (cf. cann. 1438-1439; 1444, § 1; 1632, § 2; 1683).\n\nArt. 18 – By reason of prevention, if two or more tribunals are equally competent, the right to hear the cause pertains to the tribunal which first legitimately cited the respondent party (can. 1415).\n\nArt. 19 – § 1. Once an instance has finished through abatement (peremptio) or renunciation, a party who wishes to introduce the cause anew or pursue it can approach any tribunal which is competent at the time of resumption(17).\n\n§ 2. If the abatement or renunciation or desertion (desertio) took place, however, before the Roman Rota, a cause which was either entrusted to that same Apostolic Tribunal or was brought there through a legitimate appeal can be resumed only before the Rota(18).\n\nArt. 20 – A conflict of competence between tribunals subject to the same tribunal of appeal is to be resolved by that tribunal; if they are not subject to the same tribunal of appeal it is to be resolved by the Apostolic Signatura (can. 1416).\n\nArt. 21 – If an exception is proposed against the competence of a tribunal, articles 78-79 are to be observed.\n\nTitle II\n\nTRIBUNALS\n\nChapter I\n\nJudicial power in general\n\nand tribunals\n\nArt. 22 – § 1. In each diocese the judge of first instance for causes of nullity of marriage not expressly excepted by law is the Diocesan Bishop, who can exercise judicial power personally or through others, in accordance with the law (cf. can. 1419, § 1).\n\n§ 2. Nonetheless, it is expedient that, unless special causes demand it, he not do this personally.\n\n§ 3. Therefore all Bishops must establish a diocesan tribunal for their respective dioceses.\n\nArt. 23 – § 1. Several Diocesan Bishops, however, with the approval of the Apostolic See, can by common agreement establish a single tribunal of first instance for their dioceses, in accordance with can. 1423, in place of the diocesan tribunals described in cann. 1419-1421.\n\n§ 2. In such case, a Bishop can establish in his own diocese an ‘‘instructional'' section, with one or more auditors and a notary, for the purpose of collecting the proofs and communicating judicial acts.\n\nArt. 24 – § 1. If it is entirely impossible to establish a diocesan or interdiocesan tribunal, a Diocesan Bishop can request from the Apostolic Signatura an extension of competence for another nearby tribunal, with the consent of the Bishop Moderator of that tribunal.\n\n§ 2. The Bishop Moderator is understood to be the Diocesan Bishop in regard to a diocesan tribunal and the designated Bishop, mentioned in art. 26, in regard to an interdiocesan tribunal.\n\nArt. 25 – § 1. In regard to tribunals of second instance, without prejudice to art. 27 and any indults granted by the Apostolic See:\n\n1o from the tribunal of a suffragan Bishop appeal is made to the tribunal of the Metropolitan, without prejudice to the prescriptions of nn. 3-4 (cf. can. 1438, n. 1);\n\n2o in causes judged in first instance before the tribunal of the Metropolitan appeal is made to the tribunal which he, with the approval of the Apostolic See, has stably designated (cf. can. 1438, n. 2);\n\n3o if a single tribunal of first instance has been established for several dioceses, in accordance with art. 23, the Conference of Bishops must establish a tribunal of appeal, with the approval of the Apostolic See, unless the dioceses are all suffragans of the same archdiocese (cf. can. 1439, § 1);\n\n4o the Conference of Bishops can, with the approval of the Apostolic See, establish one or more tribunals of second instance even apart from the cases mentioned in n. 3 (cf. can. 1439, § 2).\n\nArt. 26 – In regard to the tribunal mentioned in art. 23, the coetus of Bishops, and in regard to the tribunals mentioned in art. 25, nn. 3-4, the Conference of Bishops, or the Bishop designated by either body, has all the powers which pertain to a Diocesan Bishop in regard to his own tribunal (cf. cann. 1423, § 1; 1439, § 3).\n\nArt. 27 – § 1. The Roman Rota is an appeal tribunal of second instance concurrent with the tribunals mentioned in art. 25; therefore all causes judged in first instance at any tribunal whatsoever can be brought to the Roman Rota by legitimate appeal (cf. can. 1444, § 1, n. 1; Pastor bonus, art. 128, n. 1).\n\n§ 2. Without prejudice to particular laws issued by the Apostolic See or indults granted by it, the Roman Rota is the only tribunal of third and higher instance (cf. can. 1444, § 1, n. 2; Pastor bonus, art. 128, n. 2).\n\nArt. 28 – Apart from a legitimate appeal to the Roman Rota in accordance with art. 27, a referral of a cause (provocatio) made to the Apostolic See does not suspend the exercise of jurisdiction by a judge who has already begun to hear that cause; therefore he can continue the trial through to the definitive sentence, unless the Apostolic See has notified the judge that it has called the cause to itself (cf. can. 1417 § 2).\n\nArt. 29 – § 1. Any tribunal has the right to call upon another tribunal for help in instructing a cause or in communicating acts (can. 1418).\n\n§ 2. If need be, rogatorial letters can be sent to the diocesan bishop so that he can take care of the matter.\n\nArt. 30 – § 1. Causes of the nullity of marriage are reserved to a collegial tribunal of three judges, without prejudice to artt. 295, 299 (cf. can. 1425, § 1), with any custom to the contrary being reprobated.\n\n§ 2. The Bishop Moderator can entrust more difficult or more important causes to the judgement of five judges (cf. can. 1425, § 2).\n\n§ 3. In the first grade of trial, if it happens that a college cannot be formed, the Conference of Bishops, as long as this impossibility persists, can permit a Bishop Moderator to entrust causes to a single clerical judge who, when this can be done, is to employ an assessor and an auditor; to the same single judge, unless it is determined otherwise, pertain those things attributed to a college, praeses or ponens (cf. can. 1425, § 4).\n\n§ 4. A tribunal of second instance is formed in the same way as a tribunal of first instance; but for validity that tribunal must always be collegial (cf. cann. 1441; 1622, n. 1).\n\nArt. 31 – Whenever a tribunal must proceed collegially, it is bound to make its decisions by a majority of votes (cf. can. 1426, § 1).\n\nArt. 32 – § 1. The judicial power enjoyed by judges or judicial colleges is to be exercised in the manner prescribed by law and it may not be delegated except for the purpose of carrying out acts preparatory to some decree or sentence (can. 135, § 3).\n\n§ 2. Judicial power is to be exercised in one's proper territory, without prejudice to art. 85.\n\nChapter II\n\nThe ministers of the tribunal\n\n1. Ministers of justice in general\n\nArt. 33 – In light of the seriousness and the difficulty of causes of the nullity of marriage, it is the responsibility of Bishops to see to it:\n\n1o that suitable ministers of justice are prepared for their tribunals;\n\n2o that those selected for this ministry each fulfill their respective functions diligently and in accordance with the law.\n\nArt. 34 – § 1. Ministers of a diocesan tribunal are named by the Diocesan Bishop; ministers of an interdiocesan tribunal, unless otherwise expressly determined, are named by the coetus of Bishops or, as the case may be, by the Conference of Bishops.\n\n§ 2. In an urgent case the ministers of an interdiocesan tribunal may be named by the Bishop Moderator until the coetus or Conference provides.\n\nArt. 35 – § 1. All who make up the tribunal or assist it must take an oath to carry out their function properly and faithfully (can. 1454).\n\n§ 2. In order to exercise their respective functions properly, judges, defenders of the bond and promoters of justice are to be diligent in continuing to deepen their knowledge of matrimonial and procedural law.\n\n§ 3. With particular reason it is necessary that they study the jurisprudence of the Roman Rota, since it is responsible to promote the unity of jurisprudence and, through its own sentences, to be of assistance to lower tribunals (cf. Pastor bonus, art.126).\n\nArt. 36 – § 1. The Judicial Vicar, Adjunct Judicial Vicars, other judges, defenders of the bond and promoters of justice are not to exercise the same function or any other of these functions in a stable manner in two tribunals which are connected by reason of appeal.\n\n§ 2. The same officials are not to exercise simultaneously two functions in a stable manner in the same tribunal, without prejudice to art. 53, § 3.\n\n§ 3.

Ministers of justice in particular\n\na) The Judicial Vicar, the Adjunct Judicial Vicars and other Judges\n\nArt. 38 – § 1. Every Diocesan Bishop is bound to appoint for his tribunal one Judicial Vicar or Officialis with the ordinary power of judging; he is to be distinct from the Vicar General, unless the smallness of the diocese or the scarcity of causes suggests otherwise (cf. can. 1420, § 1).\n\n§ 2. The Judicial Vicar forms one tribunal with the Bishop, but he cannot judge causes which the Bishop reserves to himself (cf. can. 1420, § 2).\n\n§ 3. Without prejudice to those things which pertain to himself by right, especially freedom in passing judgement, the Judicial Vicar is bound to render an account concerning the state and activity of the tribunal to the Bishop, who is responsible for monitoring the proper administration of justice.\n\nArt. 39 – A Judicial Vicar is also to be appointed for each interdiocesan tribunal; to him those things concerning the diocesan Judicial Vicar are to be applied in an appropriate manner.\n\nArt. 40 – Judicial Vicars are bound by the obligation of making personally, before the Bishop Moderator of the tribunal or his delegate, the profession of faith and oath of fidelity, according to the formula approved by the Apostolic See (cf. can. 833, n. 5)(19).\n\nArt. 41 – § 1.

It is strongly recommended that no one lacking experience of tribunal work be appointed a Judicial Vicar or Adjunct Judicial Vicar.\n\n§ 3. The same officials do not cease from office during the vacancy of the see nor can they be removed by the diocesan administrator; however, when the new Bishop arrives they need confirmation (can. 1420, § 5).\n\nArt. 43 – § 1. Judges are to be appointed for both diocesan and interdiocesan tribunals; they are to be clerics (cf. can. 1421, § 1).\n\n§ 2.

Judges are to be of unimpaired reputation and to have a doctorate or at least a licentiate in canon law (cf. can. 1421, § 3).\n\n§ 4. It is also recommended that no one be named a judge who has not already carried out another function in the tribunal for a suitable period of time.\n\nArt. 44 – The Judicial Vicar, the Adjunct Judicial Vicars and the other judges are named for a definite period of time, without prejudice to what is prescribed by art. 42, § 3, nor can they be removed except for a legitimate and grave cause (cf. can. 1422).\n\nArt. 45 – § 1. It pertains to a collegial tribunal:\n\n1o to decide the principal cause (cf. art. 30, §§ 1, 3);\n\n2o to hear an exception of incompetence (cf. art. 78);\n\n3o to hear a recourse proposed to it against the rejection of a libellus (cf. art. 124, § 1);\n\n4o to hear a recourse proposed to it against a decree of the praeses or ponens by which the formulation of the doubt or doubts was set (cf. art. 135, § 4);\n\n5o to decide the question expeditissime if a party insists that a rejected proof be admitted (cf. art. 158, § 1);\n\n6o to decide incidental questions according to artt. 217- 228;\n\n7o to grant, for a grave reason, a period longer than a month for the drawing up of the sentence (cf. art. 249, § 5);\n\n8o to impose a vetitum, if need be (cf. artt. 250, n. 3; 251);\n\n9o to determine the judicial expenses and to hear a recourse against a decision regarding expenses and remunerations (cf. artt. 250, n. 4; 304, § 2):\n\n10o to correct a material error in a sentence (cf. art. 260);\n\n11o in the grade of appeal to confirm expeditiously by decree a sentence in favour of the nullity of marriage given in the first grade of trial or to admit it to an ordinary examination in the new grade, in accordance with art. 265;\n\n12o to hear questions about the nullity of a sentence (cf. artt. 269; 274, § 1; 275; 276, § 2; 277, § 2);\n\n13o to issue other procedural acts which the college has reserved to itself or which have been deferred to it.\n\nArt. 46 – § 1.

Once the libellus has been admitted, the powers of the praeses, mentioned in art. 46, § 2, nn. 8-16, 18, 21, ipso iure belong to the ponens, or presenter, without prejudice to the faculty of the praeses to reserve some matters to himself.\n\n§ 3. For a just cause the praeses can replace the ponens with another (cf. can. 1429).\n\nArt. 48 – § 1. The Judicial Vicar is to assign judges in order by panels to judge each individual cause or, as the case may be, to assign a single judge according to a pre-established order (cf. can. 1425, § 3).\n\n§ 2. In individual cases the Bishop Moderator can determine otherwise (cf. can. 1425, § 3).\n\nArt. 49 – Once they have been assigned the Judicial Vicar is not to replace judges except for a very serious cause to be expressed in the decree (cf. can. 1425, § 5).\n\nb) Auditors and Assessors\n\nArt. 50 – § 1. The praeses of the tribunal can designate an auditor to carry out the instruction of the cause, selecting him either from among the judges of the tribunal or from among the persons approved by the Diocesan Bishop for this function (cf. can. 1428, § 1).\n\n§ 2. The Diocesan Bishop can approve for his diocese for the function of auditor clerics or laypersons who are outstanding for their upright life, prudence and learning (cf. can. 1428, § 2).\n\n§ 3. It pertains to the auditor, according to the mandate of the judge, only to collect the proofs and give them to the judge; however, unless the mandate of the judge provides otherwise, he can also decide in the interim what proofs are to be collected and how they are to be collected, if the question should happen to arise while he is carrying out this function (cf. can 1428, § 3).\n\n§ 4. At any point in the trial the auditor can be removed for a just cause by the one who appointed him (cf. can. 193, § 3).\n\nArt. 51 – The praeses, ponens and, without prejudice to art. 50, § 3, an auditor for a just cause can delegate ad actum a suitable person who, especially if a party or witness cannot come to the seat of the tribunal without grave inconvenience, is to question them according to the mandate received (cf. cann. 1558, § 3; 1561).\n\nArt. 52 – An assessor, who is assumed as a consultant to a single judge in accordance with art. 30, § 3, is to be chosen from among those clergy or laypersons approved for this function by the Bishop Moderator (cf. can. 1424).\n\nc) The Defender of the Bond and the Promoter of Justice\n\nArt. 53 – § 1. For all causes of the nullity of marriage, there must be appointed in each diocesan or interdiocesan tribunal at least one defender of the bond and promoter of justice, with due observance of art. 34 concerning their nomination (cf. cann. 1430; 1432).\n\n§ 2. However, others may be appointed for individual causes, with due observance of art. 34, to carry out the function of defender of the bond or promoter of justice (cf. can. 1436, § 2).\n\n§ 3. The same person, but not in the same cause, can carry out the office of defender of the bond and promoter of justice (cf. can. 1436, § 1).\n\n§ 4. The defender of the bond and the promoter of justice can be removed, for a just cause, by those who appointed them (cf. can. 1436, § 2).\n\nArt. 54 – The defender of the bond and the promoter of justice are to be clerics or laypersons, of unimpaired reputation, having a doctorate or at least a licentiate in canon law, and of proven prudence and zeal for justice (cf. can. 1435).\n\nArt. 55 – The Judicial Vicar can name substitutes for the defender of the bond and promoter of justice from among those named in accordance with art. 53, §§ 1-2; this is to be done by a decree to be mentioned in the acts, and can be done either from the beginning of the process or during it. The substitutes are to stand in for those who were originally named whenever the latter are impeded.\n\nArt. 56 – § 1. In causes of the nullity of marriage the presence of the defender of the bond is always required.\n\n§ 2. The defender must participate from the beginning of the process and during its course, in accordance with the law.\n\n§ 3. In every grade of trial, the defender is bound by the obligation to propose any kind of proofs, responses and exceptions that, without prejudice to the truth of the matter, contribute to the protection of the bond (cf. can. 1432).\n\n§ 4. In causes concerning the incapacities described in can. 1095, it pertains to the defender to see whether the questions proposed in a clear fashion to the expert are relevant to the matter and do not go beyond the limits of the expert's competence; it pertains to the defender to observe whether the expert opinions are rooted in a Christian anthropology and have been drawn up according to a scientific method, pointing out to the judge anything he has found in the reports that is to be advanced in favour of the bond; in case of an affirmative sentence, before the tribunal of appeal it pertains to the defender to indicate clearly if anything in the expert reports was not correctly evaluated by the judges to the detriment of the bond.\n\n§ 5. The defender can never act in favour of the nullity of marriage; if in a special case he has nothing that can be reasonably proposed or argued in favour of the bond, the defender can remit himself to the justice of the court.\n\n§ 6. At the appellate level, after having carefully considered all the acts, even though the defender can refer back to the observations in favour of the bond proposed in the prior instance, he nonetheless must always propose his own observations, especially in regard to a supplementary instruction, if one has been carried out.\n\nArt. 57 – § 1. The promoter of justice must take part when he challenges a marriage in accordance with art. 92, n. 2.\n\n§ 2. The promoter of justice, by virtue of a decree issued by the judge, whether ex officio or at the instance of the defender of the bond or a party, must take part when it is a matter of safeguarding a procedural law, especially when the question concerns the nullity of the acts or exceptions.\n\n§ 3. If in a preceding instance of a principal or incidental cause the promoter of justice took part, his participation is presumed to be necessary in a higher grade of the same cause (cf. can. 1431, § 2).\n\nArt. 58 – In causes in which the promoter of justice has challenged a marriage in accordance with art. 57, § 1, the promoter enjoys the same rights as a petitioning party, unless something else is determined by the nature of the matter or a prescription of the law.\n\nArt. 59 – § 1. Unless something else has been expressly provided:\n\n1o whenever the law prescribes that the judge is to hear the parties or one of them, the defender of the bond and the promoter of justice, if he is taking part in the trial, are to be heard as well;\n\n2o whenever a request by a party is required in order for the judge to be able to deliberate on a matter, a request by the defender of the bond or the promoter of justice, if he is taking part in the trial, has the same force (cf. can. 1434).\n\nArt. 60 – If the defender of the bond or the promoter of justice, if his presence is required, have not been cited, the acts are invalid unless the same persons, even though not cited, actually took part, or at least, having examined the acts, were each able to perform their proper function before the sentence (cf. can. 1433).\n\nd) The Head of the Tribunal Chancery and the other Notaries\n\nArt. 61 – § 1. It pertains to the head of the tribunal chancery, who is automatically a notary for tribunal acts, to see that the acts of the tribunal are properly drawn up and sent, according to the mandate of the judge, and are preserved in the archive (cf. can. 482).\n\n§ 2. Therefore, unless otherwise determined, it pertains to this person: to record in the protocol book all the acts which arrive at the tribunal; to note in the protocol book the beginning, the progress and the end of causes; to receive documents exhibited by the parties; to send citations and letters; to see to the preparation of the summaria of processes and their distribution to the judges; to safeguard the acts of each cause; to send an authenticated copy of the acts to the tribunal of appeal if an appeal is filed or ex officio; to keep the original copy of acts and documents in the archive; to authenticate a copy of any act or document at the legitimate request of an interested party; finally, to return documents in accordance with art. 91, §§ 1-2;\n\n§ 3. The head of the chancery is to abstain carefully from any kind of intervention in a cause apart from those things which pertain to his function.\n\n§ 4. If the head of the chancery is absent or impeded, another notary for judicial acts is to take care of all these matters.\n\nArt. 62 – § 1. A notary must take part in every process, so that acts (acta) which have not been signed by the same are null (cf. can. 1437, § 1).\n\n§ 2. Acts which notaries draw up in the exercise of their function, having observed the formalities required by law, warrant public trust (cf. cann. 1437, § 2; 1540, § 1).\n\n§ 3. A notary can be given a substitute to stand in for him when the notary is impeded; this appointment is to be made by a decree to be mentioned in the acts.\n\n§ 4. For a just reason, a substitute can be named ad actum by the judge or his delegate or the auditor, especially when a party or a witness is to be questioned outside the seat of the tribunal.\n\nArt. 63 – The head of the chancery and the notaries must be of unimpaired reputation and above all suspicion (cf. can. 483, § 2).\n\nArt. 64 – In the diocesan tribunal they can be removed from office in accordance with can. 485 and in an interdiocesan tribunal by the Bishop Moderator.\n\nTitle III\n\nTHE DISCIPLINE\n\nTO BE OBSERVED IN TRIBUNALS\n\nChapter I\n\nThe duty of the judge\n\nand the other ministers of the tribunal\n\nArt. 65 – § 1. A judge, before he accepts a cause and whenever he perceives the hope of a good outcome, is to employ pastoral means to convince the spouses, if this can be done, to conval- idate the marriage and reestablish conjugal life (can. 1676).\n\n§ 2. If this cannot be done, the judge is to urge the spouses to work together sincerely, putting aside any personal desire and living the truth in charity, in order to arrive at the objective truth, as the very nature of a marriage cause demands.\n\n§ 3. If, however, the judge observes that the spouses are affected by a spirit of mutual animosity, he is to urge them strongly to observe mutual courtesy, graciousness, and charity within the process, avoiding any hostility.\n\nArt. 66 – § 1. One who has taken part in a cause as a judge cannot afterwards in another instance validly decide the same cause as a judge or carry out the function of assessor (cf. can. 1447).\n\n§ 2. One who has taken part in a cause as a defender of the bond, promoter of justice, procurator, advocate, witness or expert cannot in the same or another instance validly decide the same cause as a judge or carry out the function of assessor (cf. can. 1447).\n\nArt. 67 – § 1. A judge is not to take up a cause in which he has some interest by reason of consanguinity or affinity in any degree in the direct line and up to the fourth degree in a collateral line, or by reason of guardianship or tutelage, close personal relationship, great hostility, gain to be made or damage to be avoided, or in which any other sort of founded suspicion of favoritism could fall upon him (cf. can. 1448, § 1).\n\n§ 2. In the same circumstances the defender of the bond, promoter of justice, assessor and auditor, and the other ministers of the tribunal must abstain from exercising their office (cf. can. 1448, § 2).\n\nArt. 68 – § 1. In those cases mentioned in art. 67, unless the judge, defender of the bond, promoter of justice or other tribunal minister abstains, a party can object to them (cf. can. 1449, § 1).\n\n§ 2. The Judicial Vicar hears an objection (exceptio) against a judge; if the objection is against himself, the Bishop Moderator is to deal with the matter (cf. can. 1449, § 2).\n\n§ 3. If the Bishop is the judge and the objection is filed against him, he is to abstain from judging (cf. can. 1449, § 3).\n\n§ 4. If the objection is filed against the defender of the bond, the promoter of justice or other ministers of the tribunal, the question is heard by the praeses in a collegial court or by the judge himself, if he is a single judge (cf. can. 1449, § 4).\n\n§ 5. Without prejudice to art. 67, § 1, an objection filed because of acts legitimately placed by a judge or other minister of the tribunal cannot be considered to have any foundation.\n\nArt. 69 – § 1. If the objection is admitted, the persons must be changed, but not the grade of the trial (can. 1450).\n\n§ 2. If the tribunal cannot take the cause due to a lack of other ministers and there is no other competent tribunal, the matter is to be deferred to the Apostolic Signatura so that it may designate another tribunal to handle the cause.\n\nArt. 70 – § 1. The question of an objection is to be decided expeditissime, after the parties have been heard, as well as the defender of the bond and the promoter of justice, if taking part in the process, unless they themselves have been recused (cf. can. 1451, § 1).\n\n§ 2. Acts placed by the judge before an objection was made against him are valid; those taken after an objection was filed must be rescinded if a party so requests within ten days of the admission of the objection (cf. can. 1451, § 2).\n\nArt. 71 – § 1. Once a cause of the nullity of marriage has been legitimately introduced, the judge can and must proceed not only at the request of the parties but even ex officio (cf. can. 1452, § 1).\n\n§ 2. Therefore the judge can and must supply for the parties' negligence in presenting proofs and placing exceptions, whenever he deems it necessary in order to avoid an unjust sentence, without prejudice to the requirements of art. 239 (cf. can. 1452, § 2).\n\nArt. 72 – Judges and tribunals are to see that all causes are finished as soon as possible, while safeguarding justice, and that they not be prolonged beyond one year in a tribunal of first instance and beyond six months in a tribunal of second instance (can. 1453).\n\nArt. 73 – § 1. Judges and other ministers of the tribunal and assistants are bound to keep the secret of office (cf. can. 1455, § 1).\n\n§ 2. Judges are bound in a special way to maintain secrecy concerning the discussion among themselves prior to issuing a sentence, as well as concerning the various votes and opinions expressed therein, without prejudice to art. 248, § 4 (cf. can. 1455, § 2).\n\n§ 3. Whenever the nature of the cause or of the proofs is such that from the divulgation of the acts and proofs the reputation of others could suffer, an occasion could be given for disagreements, or a scandal or other inconveniences of this type could arise, the judge can bind the witnesses, experts, parties and their advocates or procurators to secrecy by a special oath or, as the case may be, at least a promise, without prejudice to artt. 159, 229-230 (cf. can. 1455, § 3).\n\nArt. 74 – The judge and all ministers of the tribunal are prohibited from accepting any gifts on the occasion of their acting in a trial (can. 1456).\n\nArt. 75 – § 1. Judges and other ministers of the tribunal who commit an offense against the office entrusted to them are to be punished in accordance with the law (cf. cann. 1386; 1389; 1391; 1457; 1470, § 2).\n\n§ 2. When the correct administration of justice is impeded because of negligence, incompetence or abuses, the Bishop Moderator or the coetus of Bishops is to address the matter by apt means, not excluding removal from office, as the case may require.\n\n§ 3. Whoever illegitimately causes harm to another by a juridic act, indeed by any other act placed maliciously or negligently, is bound by the obligation to repair the damage (can. 128).\n\nChapter II\n\nThe order of proceeding\n\nArt. 76 – § 1. Causes are to be judged in the order in which they were presented and inscribed in the case register (cf. can. 1458).\n\n§ 2. However if some cause demands a quicker handling ahead of others, that is to be ordered by a special decree containing the reasons (cf. can. 1458).\n\nArt. 77 – § 1. At any stage or grade of trial, defects by which the nullity of a sentence can occur can be proposed as an exception and likewise declared by the judge ex officio (can. 1459, § 1).\n\n§ 2. Apart from the cases mentioned in § 1, dilatory exceptions, especially those which pertain to persons and the manner of trial, are to be proposed before the formulation of the doubt is set, unless they emerge after the doubt has been set, and are to be decided as quickly as possible (cf. can. 1459, § 2).\n\nArt. 78 – § 1. If an exception is proposed against the competence of the tribunal, the college must hear the question, without prejudice to art. 30, § 3 (cf. can. 1460, § 1).\n\n§ 2. In case of an exception of relative incompetence, if the college declares itself competent, its decision does not admit an appeal, but a complaint of nullity, treated in artt. 269-278, is not prohibited, nor is a restitutio in integrum, treated in cann. 1645-1648 (cf. can. 1460, § 2).\n\n§ 3. But if the college declares itself incompetent, a party who considered himself injured can have recourse to the tribunal of appeal within fifteen canonical days (cf. can. 1460, § 3).\n\nArt. 79 – A tribunal which at any stage of the cause realizes that is absolutely incompetent must declare its incompetence (cf. can. 1461).\n\nArt. 80 – Questions regarding the deposit to be made against the expenses of the trial or concerning the granting of gratuitous legal assistance, when this was requested from the very beginning, and other such questions are normally to be heard before the formulation of the doubt has been set (cf. can. 1464).\n\nChapter III\n\nTime limits and delays\n\nArt. 81 – § 1. The so-called fatalia legis, that is, the time limits established by the law by which rights expire, cannot be extended, nor can they be validly shortened except at the request of the parties (can. 1465, § 1).\n\n§ 2. Judicial or conventional time limits, that is, those established by the judge on his own initiative or with the agreement of the parties, can be extended for a just cause by the judge before their expiration, after the parties have been heard or at their request, but they can never be validly shortened without their consent (cf. can. 1465, § 2).\n\n§ 3. Nonetheless the judge is to take care lest the handling of the cause become too prolonged as a result of this extension (cf. can. 1465, § 3).\n\nArt. 82 – When the law does not set time limits for carrying out procedural acts, the judge must set them beforehand, having taken into account the nature of each act (can. 1466).\n\nArt. 83 – If the tribunal is closed on the day set for a judicial act, the time limit is understood to be extended to the first subsequent day which is not a holiday (can. 1467).\n\nChapter IV\n\nThe place of the trial\n\nArt. 84 – The seat of each tribunal is to be a stable one, inasmuch as possible, which is open at set times (can. 1468).\n\nArt. 85 – § 1. A judge expelled by force from his territory or impeded from exercising his jurisdiction there, can exercise his jurisdiction and issue a sentence outside his territory; however the Diocesan Bishop of the place has to be informed of this (can. 1469, § 1).\n\n§ 2. Apart from the case mentioned in § 1, a judge, for a just cause and having heard the parties, can go even outside his territory for the purpose of acquiring proofs, but with the permission of the Diocesan Bishop of the place in question and in a place designated by the same (can. 1469, § 2).\n\nChapter V\n\nPersons to be admitted to the courtroom\n\nand the manner of preparing and conserving the acts\n\nArt. 86 – While causes are being conducted at the tribunal, only those persons are to be present in the courtroom whom the law or the judge has determined are necessary for the carrying out of the process (cf. can. 1470, § 1).\n\nArt. 87 – The judge can call to task all those taking part in the trial who are gravely lacking in the respect and obedience due the tribunal; furthermore he can even suspend advocates and procurators from exercising their function in the cause (cf. can. 1470, § 2).\n\nArt. 88 – § 1. Judicial acts, both those which concern the merits of the question, that is, the acts of the cause, and those which pertain to the formalities of the procedure, that is, the acts of the process, must be put into written form (cf. can. 1472, § 2).\n\n§ 2. The individual pages of the acts are to be numbered and authenticated (can. 1472, § 2).\n\nArt. 89 – Whenever the signature of parties or witnesses is required on judicial acts, if the party or witness is unable or unwilling to sign, that fact is to be noted on the acts themselves. At the same time, the judge and notary are to certify that the act itself was read verbatim to the party or witness and that the party or witness was unable or unwilling to sign (can. 1473).\n\nArt. 90 – § 1. If the cause is to be heard at the tribunal of appeal, a copy of the acts, whose authenticity and completeness has been certified by the notary, is to be sent to the higher tribunal (cf. can. 1474, § 1).\n\n§ 2. If the acts are drawn up in a language unknown to the higher tribunal, they are to be translated into a language known to that tribunal, with due precautions having been taken to verify the fidelity of the translation (can. 1474, § 2).\n\nArt. 91 – § 1. When the trial has finished, documents belonging to private individuals are to be returned, but a copy of them authenticated by a notary is to be retained (cf. can. 1475, § 2).\n\n§ 2. Without the mandate of the judge, the head of the chancery and the notaries are prohibited from giving out a copy of the judicial acts and of documents which were acquired for the process (cf. can. 1475, § 2).\n\nTitle IV\n\nTHE PARTIES IN THE CAUSE\n\nChapter I\n\nThe right to challenge a marriage\n\nArt. 92 – § 1. The following have the ability to challenge a marriage:\n\n1o the spouses, whether Catholics or non-Catholics (cf. cann. 1674, n. 1; 1476; art. 3, § 2);\n\n2o the promoter of justice, when the nullity of the marriage has been revealed and the marriage cannot be convalidated or this would not be expedient (cf. can. 1674, n. 2).\n\nArt. 93 – A marriage which was not challenged when both spouses were living can be challenged after the death of one or both spouses by one for whom the cause of the nullity of the marriage would be prejudicial to the resolution of a controversy in canonical or civil court (cf. can. 1675, § 1).\n\nArt. 94 – If a spouse dies while the cause is pending, art. 143 is to be observed (cf. can. 1675, § 2).\n\nChapter II\n\nThe spouses as parties in the cause\n\nArt. 95 – § 1. In order for the truth to be more easily discovered and for the right of defense to be more aptly safeguarded, it is most expedient that both spouses take part in a process of the nullity of marriage.\n\n§ 2. Therefore a spouse legitimately summoned to the trial must respond (cf. can. 1476).\n\nArt. 96 – Even when a spouse has named a procurator or advocate, he is still bound to take part in the trial when so prescribed by the law or the judge (cf. can. 1477).\n\nArt. 97 – § 1. Those who are deprived of the use of reason can stand trial only through a guardian (cf. can. 1478, § 1).\n\n§ 2. Those who at the beginning of the process, or in its course, are of impaired mind can stand trial for themselves only at the prescription of the judge; in other matters they must act and respond through their guardians (cf. can. 1478, § 4).\n\n§ 3. Minors can act and respond on their own behalf without the permission of parents or guardian, without prejudice to §§ 1-2 (cf. can. 1478, § 3).\n\nArt. 98 – Whenever there is a guardian appointed by the civil authorities, the same can be admitted by the judge, who is first to hear, if possible, the Diocesan Bishop of the one for whom the guardian is appointed; if there is none, or it appears that the existing one is not to be admitted, the judge himself will designate a guardian for the cause (cf. can. 1479).\n\nArt. 99 – § 1. It pertains to the praeses to admit or designate a guardian by a decree which indicates the reasons and which is to be kept in the acts.\n\n§ 2. The decree in question is to be communicated to all interested parties, including the spouse who was given a guardian, unless a grave cause should prevent this, with the right of defense nonetheless remaining intact.\n\nArt. 100 – § 1. The guardian is bound by office to protect the rights of the person to whom he was given.\n\nChapter III\n\nProcurators and advocates\n\nArt. 101 – § 1. Without prejudice to the right of the parties to defend themselves personally, the tribunal is bound by the obligation to provide that each spouse is able to defend his rights with the help of a competent person, most especially when it concerns causes of a special difficulty.\n\n§ 2. If in the judgement of the praeses the ministry of a procurator or advocate is necessary and the party has not so provided within a prescribed time limit, the praeses is to name them, as the case requires, but they remain in function only as long as the party has not named others.\n\n§ 3. If gratuitous legal assistance has been granted, it pertains to the tribunal praeses himself to name the procurator or advocate.\n\n§ 4. In any case, the appointment of a procurator or advocate by decree is to be communicated to the parties and the defender of the bond.\n\nArt. 102 – If both parties are seeking a declaration of the nullity of the marriage, they can name for themselves a common procurator or advocate.\n\nArt. 103 – § 1. The parties can name a procurator separate from the advocate.\n\n§ 2. Each person can name only one procurator for himself, who cannot appoint another in his place unless the express faculty has been given to him to do so (can. 1482, § 1).\n\n§ 3. If, however, for a just cause several have been appointed by the same person, they are to be so designated that prevention is operative among them (can. 1482, § 2).\n\n§ 4. Several advocates can still be named at the same time (can. 1482, § 3).\n\nArt. 104 – § 1. The advocate and procurator are bound according to their function to protect the rights of the party and to keep the secret of office.\n\n§ 2. It pertains to the procurator to represent the party, to present the libellus or recourses to the tribunal, to receive its notifications, and to inform the party of the state of the cause; but those things pertaining to defense are always reserved to the advocate.\n\nArt. 105 – § 1. The procurator and advocate must be of good reputation; in addition the advocate must be a Catholic, unless the Bishop Moderator allows otherwise, and a doctor in canon law, or otherwise truly expert, and approved by the same Bishop (cf. can. 1483).\n\n§ 2. Those who have the diploma of Rotal Advocate do not need this approval; however the Bishop Moderator for a grave cause can prohibit them from practicing in his tribunal; in such case, recourse can be had to the Apostolic Signatura.\n\n§ 3. The praeses because of special circumstances can approve as procurator ad casum someone who does not reside in the territory of the tribunal.\n\nArt. 106 – § 1. Before a procurator and advocate can take up their function, they must deposit an authentic mandate at the tribunal (can. 1484, § 1).\n\n§ 2. Nonetheless, in order to prevent the extinction of a right, the praeses can admit a procurator even before the mandate has been exhibited, with a suitable guarantee having been offered, if the matter so warrants; any act lacks force, however, if the procurator does not properly present an authentic mandate within the peremptory time limit to be set by the same praeses (cf. can. 1484, § 2).\n\nArt. 107 – § 1. Unless he has a special mandate, a procurator cannot validly renounce an action, an instance, or judicial acts, nor in general do those things for which the law requires a special mandate (cf. can. 1485).\n\n§ 2. Once a definitive sentence has been issued, the procurator retains the right and duty to appeal, unless the mandating party declines (can. 1486, § 2).\n\nArt. 108 – Advocates and procurators can be removed at any stage in the cause by the person who named them, without prejudice to the obligation of paying the remuneration due them for the work they have done; in order for the removal to take effect, however, it is necessary that it be communicated to them and, if the doubt has already been established, that the judge and the other party be informed of the removal (cf. can. 1486, § 1).\n\nArt. 109 – Both the procurator and the advocate can be rejected by the praeses, by a decree containing motives, either ex officio or at the instance of a party, but only for a grave cause (cf. can. 1487).\n\nArt. 110 – Advocates and procurators are forbidden:\n\n1o to renounce their mandate without a just reason while the cause is pending;\n\n2o to contract for an excessive fee for themselves: if they should do so, the agreement is null;\n\n3o to betray their duty because of gifts, promises or another reason;\n\n4o to withdraw causes from competent tribunals or to act in fraudem legis in any way whatsoever (cf. cann. 1488-1489).\n\nArt. 111 – § 1. Advocates and procurators who commit an offense against the responsibility entrusted to them are to be punished in accordance with the law (cf. cann. 1386; 1389; 1391, n. 2; 1470, § 2; 1488-1489).\n\n§ 2. If however they were found to be unequal to their duty because of incompetence, a loss of good reputation, negligence or abuses, the Bishop Moderator or coetus of Bishops is to provide for the matter using appropriate means, not excluding, if need be, a prohibition from practicing in their tribunal.\n\n§ 3. Whoever has harmed another by any act illegitimately placed, either maliciously or through negligence, is bound by the obligation to repair the harm (cf. can. 128).\n\nArt. 112 – § 1. It pertains to the Bishop Moderator to publish an index or directory in which there are listed the advocates admitted before his tribunal and the procurators who usually represent parties there.\n\n§ 2. The advocates inscribed in the directory are bound, by a mandate of the Judicial Vicar, to provide gratuitous legal assistance to those to whom the tribunal has granted this benefit (cf. art. 307).\n\nArt. 113 – § 1. At every tribunal there is to be an office or a person available so that anyone can freely and quickly obtain advice about the possibility of, and procedure for, the introduction of their cause of nullity of marriage, if such should be the case.\n\n§ 2. If this office should happen to be carried out by the ministers of the tribunal, they cannot have the part of judge or defender of the bond in the cause.\n\n§ 3. In each tribunal, to the extent possible, there are to be stable advocates designated, receiving their salary from the tribunal itself, who can carry out the function described in § 1, and who are to exercise the function of advocate or proc- urator for the parties who prefer to choose them (cf. can. 1490).\n\n§ 4. If the function described in § 1 is entrusted to a stable advocate, he cannot take on the defense of the cause except as a stable advocate.\n\nTitle V\n\nTHE INTRODUCTION OF THE CAUSE\n\nChapter I\n\nThe introductory libellus of the cause\n\nArt. 114 – A judge cannot hear a cause unless a petition has been proposed by one who in accordance with artt. 92-93 enjoys the right to challenge the marriage (cf. can. 1501).\n\nArt. 115 – § 1. One who wishes to challenge a marriage must present a libellus to a competent tribunal (cf. can. 1502).\n\n§ 2. An oral petition can be admitted, whenever the petitioner is impeded from presenting a libellus, in which case the Judicial Vicar is to order the notary to draw up the act in writing, which is then to be read to the petitioner to be approved, and which then takes the place of a libellus written by the petitioner, for all legal effects (cf. can. 1503).\n\nArt. 116 – § 1. A libellus by which a cause in introduced must:\n\n1o express the tribunal before which the cause is to be introduced;\n\n2o describe the object of the cause, that is, specify the marriage in question, present a petition for a declaration of nullity, and propose—although not necessarily in technical terms—the reason for petitioning, that is, the ground or grounds of nullity on which the marriage is being challenged;\n\n3o indicate at least in a general way the facts and proofs on which the petitioner is relying in order to demonstrate what is being asserted;\n\n4o be signed by the petitioner or his procurator, indicating also the day, month and year, as well as the place in which the petitioner or his advocate live, or declare they reside for the purpose of receiving acts;\n\n5o indicate the domicile or quasi-domicile of the other spouse (cf. can. 1504).\n\n§ 2. There should be attached to the libellus an authentic copy of the marriage certificate and, if need be, a document of the civil status of the parties.\n\n§ 3. It is not permissible to require expert reports at the time when the petition is being exhibited.\n\nArt. 117 – If proof through documents is being proposed, these, inasmuch as possible, are to be sumitted with the petition; if, however, proof through witnesses is being proposed, their names and domicile are to be indicated. If other proofs are being proposed, there should be indicated, at least in general, the facts or indications from which they are to be brought to light. Nothing however prevents further proofs of any kind from being brought forth in the course of the trial.\n\nArt. 118 – § 1. Once a libellus has been exhibited, the Judicial Vicar must constitute a tribunal as soon as possible by his decree in accordance with artt. 48-49.\n\n§ 2. The names of the judges and the defender of the bond must be communicated to the petitioner immediately.\n\nArt. 119 – § 1. The praeses, once he has seen both that the matter is within the competence of his tribunal and that the petitioner does not lack legitmate standing in the trial, must either admit or reject the libellus by his decree as soon as possible (cf. can. 1505, § 1).\n\n§ 2. It is advisable that the praeses hear the defender of the bond first.\n\nArt. 120 – § 1. The praeses can and must, if the case requires, institute a preliminary investigation regarding the question of the tribunal's competence and of the petitioner's legitimate standing in the trial.\n\n§ 2. In regard to the merits of the cause he can only institute an investigation in order to admit or reject the libellus, if the libellus should seem to lack any basis whatsoever; he can do this only in order to see whether it could happen that some basis could appear from the process.\n\nArt. 121 – § 1. The libellus can be rejected only:\n\n1o if the tribunal is incompetent;\n\n2o if the petition is without a doubt presented by one who does not have the right to challenge the marriage (cf. artt. 92- 93; 97, §§ 1-2; 106, § 2);\n\n3o if the prescriptions of art. 116, § 1, nn. 1-4 have not been observed;\n\n4o if it is certainly apparent from the libellus that the petition lacks any basis, and that it could not happen that some basis could appear from the process (cf. can. 1505, § 2).\n\n§ 2. The decree must express at least in a summary manner the reasons for the rejection and must be communicated as soon as possible to the petitioning party and, if need be, to the defender of the bond (cf. can. 1617).\n\nArt. 122 – There is no basis for the admission of the libellus if the fact upon which the challenge is based, even if completely true, is nonetheless entirely incapable of making the marriage null or else, even if the fact is such that it would make the marriage null, the untruth of the assertion is obvious.\n\nArt. 123 – If the libellus is rejected because of defects that can be remedied, these defects are to be indicated in the decree of rejection and the petitioner is to be invited to present a new libellus properly drafted (cf. can. 1505, § 3).\n\nArt. 124 – § 1. The party always has the right to present a recourse, indicating reasons, against the rejection of the libellus within the canonical time period of ten days to the college, if the libellus was rejected by the praeses, otherwise to the tribunal of appeal: in either case the question of the rejection is to be decided expeditissime (cf. can. 1505, § 4).\n\n§ 2. If the tribunal of appeal admits the libellus, the cause is to be judged by the tribunal a quo.\n\n§ 3. If the recourse was presented to the college, it cannot be proposed again to the tribunal of appeal.\n\nArt. 125 – If within a month of the libellus having been presented the judge does not issue a decree by which the libellus is accepted or rejected, the interested party can insist that the judge carry out his duty; if the judge nonetheless should remain silent, once ten days from the presentation of the request have passed without a response the libellus, if it had been presented legitimately, is considered to have been admitted (cf. can. 1506).\n\nChapter II\n\nThe citation and the communication of judicial acts\n\n1. The first citation and its communication\n\nArt. 126 – § 1. In the decree by which the libellus of the petitioner is admitted, the praeses must summon or cite to the trial the respondent party, stating whether he must respond in writing or, at the request of the petitioner, appear before the tribunal for the concordance of the doubt(s). If from the written response it appears necessary to convoke the parties and the defender of the bond, the praeses or ponens is to state this by a new decree and is to see that it is communicated to them (cf. cann. 1507, § 1; 1677, § 2).\n\n§ 2. If the libellus is considered admitted in accordance with art. 125, the decree of citation to the trial is to be issued within twenty days of the request mentioned in the same article (cf. can. 1507, § 2).\n\n§ 3. If the respondent party in fact appears before the judge to take part in the cause, there is no need for that party's citation, but the notary is to signify in the acts that the party was present in the trial (cf. can. 1507, § 3).\n\n§ 4. If the marriage is being challenged by the promoter of justice in accordance with art. 92, n. 2, both parties are to be cited.\n\nArt. 127 – § 1. The praeses or ponens is to see that the decree of citation to the trial is communicated immediately to the respondent party and at the same time made known to the petitioning party and the defender of the bond (cf. cann. 1508, § 1; 1677, § 1).\n\n§ 2. It is advisable that the praeses or ponens, together with these communications, propose to the parties the formulation of the doubt or doubts based on the libellus so that they may respond.\n\n§ 3. The introductory libellus is to be attached to the citation, unless the praeses or ponens for grave reasons decrees, with a decree indicating reasons, that the libellus is not to be communicated to the respondent party before that party has given his judicial deposition. In this case, however, it is required that the respondent party be notified of the object of the cause and the ground(s) proposed by the petitioner (cf. can. 1508, § 2).\n\n§ 4. Together with the decree of citation the names of the judges and defender of the bond are to be communicated to the respondent party.\n\nArt. 128 – If the citation does not contain those things which are necessary in accordance with art. 127, § 3 or if it was not legitimately communicated to the respondent party, the acts of the process are null, without prejudice to the prescriptions of artt. 60; 126, § 3; 131 and with the prescriptions of art. 270, nn. 4, 7 remaining in force (cf. can. 1511).\n\nArt. 129 – When the citation has been legitimately communicated to the respondent party or that same party has appeared before the judge to participate in the cause, the instance begins to be pending and becomes proper to the tribunal, otherwise competent, before which the action was instituted (cf. can. 1512, nn. 2-3, 5).\n\n2. Those things to be observed in citations and communications\n\nArt. 130 – § 1. The communication of citations, decrees, sentences and other judicial acts is to be done through the postal service or by another means which is very secure, having observed the requirements established by particular law (can. 1509, § 1).\n\n§ 2. There must be proof in the acts of the fact of communication and of the manner in which it was carried out (can. 1509, § 2).\n\nArt. 131 – § 1. If a party lacks the use of reason or is of impaired mind, the citations and communications are to be made to the guardian (cf. can. 1508, § 3).\n\n§ 2. A party who has a procurator is to be informed of citations and communications through that person.\n\nArt. 132 – § 1. Whenever, after a diligent investigation has been made, it is still unknown where a party lives who is to be cited or to whom some act is to be communicated, the judge can proceed further, but there must be proof in the acts of the diligent investigation that was made.\n\n§ 2. Particular law can establish that in this sort of case the citation or communication can be made by edict (cf. can. 1509, § 1).\n\nArt. 133 – One who refuses to receive a citation or other judicial communication, or who prevents it from reaching himself, is to be considered to have been cited legitimately or to have been legitimately informed of the matter that was to have been communicated (cf. can. 1510).\n\nArt. 134 – § 1. To those parties who are taking part in the tribunal either personally or through a procurator, all those acts shall be communicated which by law must be communicated.\n\n§ 2. To those parties who entrust themselves to the justice of the court, there must be communicated the decree by which the formulation of the doubt is determined, any new petition which might have been made, the decree of publication of the acts, and all decisions of the college.\n\n§ 3. To a party who has been declared absent from the trial, there shall be communicated the formulation of the doubt and the definitive sentence, without prejudice to art. 258, § 3.\n\n§ 4. To a party absent in accordance with art. 132 because the place of residence is unknown, no communication of acts is made.\n\nChapter III\n\nThe formulation of the doubt\n\nArt. 135 – § 1. When fifteen days have passed from the communication of the decree of citation, the praeses or ponens, unless one or another of the parties or the defender of the bond has requested a session for the determination of the formulation of the doubt, is to set by his decree within ten days the formulation of the doubt or doubts, taken from the petitions and responses of the parties (cf. can. 1677, § 2).\n\n§ 2. The petitions and responses of the parties, in addition to the introductory libellus, can be expressed either in the response to the citation or in declarations made orally before the judge (cf. can. 1513, §§ 1-2).\n\n§ 3. The formulation of the doubt must determine by which ground or grounds the validity of the marriage is being challenged.\n\n§ 4. The decree of the praeses or ponens is to be communicated to the parties, who, unless they have already agreed to it, can have recourse to the college within ten days to have it changed; the question however is to be decided expeditissime by the decree of the college itself (cf. can. 1513, § 3).\n\nArt. 136 – Once the formulation of the doubt has been set, it cannot be validly changed unless by a new decree, for a grave reason, at the request of a party, with the other party and the defender of the bond having been heard and their reasons considered (cf. can. 1514).\n\nArt. 137 – After ten days from the communication of the decree, if the parties have not offered any opposition, the praeses or ponens is to order by a new decree the instruction of the cause (can. 1677, § 4).\n\nChapter IV\n\nParties who do not appear\n\nArt. 138 – § 1. If the respondent party is properly cited but neither appears nor offers a suitable excuse for the absence or does not respond in accordance with art. 126, § 1, the prae- ses or ponens is to declare that party absent from the trial and decree that the cause, with due observance of those things to be observed, is to proceed through to the definitive sentence (cf. can. 1592, § 1).\n\n§ 2. However, the praeses or ponens is to make an effort to have the party withdraw from the absence.\n\n§ 3. Before the decree mentioned in § 1 is to be issued, there must be proof, even through a new citation if needed, that the citation, made legitimately, reached the respondent party in sufficient time (cf. can. 1592, § 2).\n\nArt. 139 – § 1. If the respondent party then appears in the trial or gives a response before the decision of the cause, he can offer conclusions and proofs, without prejudice to art. 239; the judge however is to see that the trial is not deliberately drawn out into longer and unnecessary delays (cf. can. 1593, § 1).\n\n§ 2. Even if the party did not appear or give a response before the decision in the cause, he can use the means of challenging the sentence; if the party proves that he was detained by a legitimate impediment, which he through no fault was unable to demonstrate earlier, that party can use a complaint of nullity in accordance with art. 272, n. 6 (cf. can. 1593, § 2).\n\nArt. 140 – If at the day and hour set for the concordance of the formula of the doubt the petitioner does not appear either personally nor through a procurator, nor offers a suitable excuse:\n\n1o the praeses or ponens is to cite that party again;\n\n2o if the petitioner does not appear in response to the new citation, the cause will be declared deserted by the praeses, unless the respondent party or the promoter of justice, in accordance with art. 92, n. 2, continues for the nullity of the marriage;\n\n3o if the petitioner later wishes to take part in the process, art. 139 is to be observed (cf. can. 1594).\n\nArt. 141 – Art. 134, § 3, is to be observed in regard to a party who was declared absent from the trial by the judge.\n\nArt. 142 – The norms on the declaration of absence of a party from the trial are also to be observed, with suitable adaptations, if a party must be declared absent during the process.\n\nTitle VI\n\nTHE ENDING OF THE INSTANCE\n\nChapter I\n\nThe suspension, abatement\n\nand renunciation of the instance\n\nArt. 143 – § 1. If a spouse dies during the process:\n\n1o if the cause has not yet been concluded, the instance is suspended until the other spouse or another interested party insists on its prosecution; in the latter case it must be proved that there is a legitimate interest;\n\n2o if the cause has been concluded in accordance with art. 237, the judge must proceed further, having cited the procurator, if there is one, or else the heir or successor of the deceased person (cf. cann. 1518; 1675, § 2).\n\nArt. 144 – § 1. If a guardian or procurator, whose presence is necessary in accordance with art. 101, § 2, should cease his function, the instance is suspended for the moment (cf. can. 1519, § 1).\n\n§ 2. The praeses or ponens is to name another guardian as soon as possible; he can even name a procurator if the party neglects to do so within a brief time limit set by the same judge (cf. can. 1519, § 2).\n\nArt. 145 – § 1. The progress of the principal cause is also suspended whenever a question must first be resolved on which depends the continuation of the instance or the very resolution of the principal cause.\n\n§ 2. This sort of suspension takes place when a complaint of nullity is pending against a definitive sentence or if, in a cause concerning the impediment of a prior bond, the existence of the prior bond is being called into question at the same time.\n\nArt. 146 – If no procedural act is placed by the parties for six months, while no obstacle is preventing this, the instance is abated; however, the tribunal is not to neglect to inform a party beforehand of an act that must be placed. Particular law can establish other peremptory time limits (cf. can. 1520).\n\nArt. 147 – Abatement (peremptio) takes place by virtue of the law itself and must even be declared ex officio (cf. can. 1521).\n\nArt. 148 – Abatement extinguishes the acts of the process, not however the acts of the cause, which retain the same force in a new instance for the declaration of the nullity of the same marriage (cf. can. 1522).\n\nArt. 149 – The expenses of the abated instance which each of the parties incurred, are to be borne by the same party, unless the judge for a just cause has decided otherwise (cf. can. 1523).\n\nArt. 150 – § 1. In any state or grade of the trial the petitioner can renounce the instance; likewise both the petitioner and the respondent party can renounce all or some of the acts of the process which they themselves had requested (cf. can. 1524, § 1).\n\n§ 2. In order to be valid, the renunciation must be made in writing, must be signed by the party or by the party's procurator who has a special mandate to do so, must be communicated to the other party, must be accepted by that party or at least not challenged, and must be admitted by the praeses or ponens (cf. can. 1524, § 3).\n\n§ 3. The defender of the bond is to be informed of the renunciation, without prejudice to art. 197.\n\nArt. 151 – A renunciation admitted by the judge has the same effect, for the acts which were renounced, as the abatement of the instance and likewise obliges the renouncing party to pay any expenses already incurred, unless the judge for a just cause has decided otherwise (cf. can. 1525).\n\nArt. 152 – In case of abatement or renunciation, the cause can be resumed in accordance with can. 19.\n\nChapter II\n\nThe suspension of the cause\n\nin case of a doubt about non-consummation\n\nArt. 153 – § 1. If in the course of the instruction of the cause a very probable doubt has arisen about the non-consummation of the marriage, the tribunal, with the consent of the parties and at the request of one or both parties, can suspend the cause by decree and begin a process concerning marriage which is ratum et non consummatum (cf. can. 1681).\n\n§ 2. In such case, the tribunal is to complete the instruction for a dispensation super rato (cf. cann. 1681; 1702-1704)(20).\n\n§ 3. When the instruction has been completed, the acts are to be sent to the Apostolic See together with the petition for the dispensation, as well as the observations of the defender of the bond and the votum of the tribunal and the Bishop (cf. can. 1681).\n\n§ 4. If either party refuses to give the consent mentioned in § 1, that party is to be warned of the juridic consequences of that refusal.\n\nArt. 154 – § 1. If the cause of nullity has been instructed in an interdiocesan tribunal, the votum mentioned in art. 153, § 3 is to be drawn up by the Bishop Moderator of the tribunal, who is to confer with the Bishop of the party requesting the dispensation, at least concerning the advisability of granting the requested dispensation(21).\n\n§ 2. In preparing its votum the tribunal is to explain the fact of inconsummation and the just cause for the dispensation.\n\n§ 3. In regard to the votum of the Bishop, there is no reason why he cannot follow the votum of the tribunal by putting his signature to it, as long as the existence of the just and proportionate cause for the favour of the dispensation and the absence of scandal on the part of the faithful have been verified(22).\n\nTitle VII\n\nPROOFS\n\nArt. 155 – § 1. The following norms are to be observed in collecting the proofs.\n\n§ 2. Unless something else is apparent or required by the nature of the matter, the term “judge” in this title refers to the praeses or ponens, the judge of the tribunal which is called to assist by virtue of art. 29, their delegate and the auditor, without prejudice to art. 158, § 2.\n\nArt. 156 – § 1. The burden of proof lies on the one making an assertion (can. 1526, § 1).\n\n§ 2. Those things which are presumed by the law itself have no need of proof (cf. can. 1526, § 2, n. 1).\n\nArt. 157 – § 1. Proofs of any kind which seem useful for understanding the cause and are licit can be brought forward. Proofs which are illicit, whether in themselves or in the manner in which they are acquired, are neither to be brought forward nor admitted (cf. can. 1527, § 1).\n\n§ 2. Proofs are not to be admitted under secrecy, unless for a grave reason and as long as their communication with the advocates of the parties has been guaranteed, without prejudice to artt. 230 and 234 (cf. can. 1598, § 1).\n\n§ 3. The judge is to restrain an excessive number of witnesses and other proofs, and likewise is not to admit proofs brought forward in order to cause delays in the process (cf. can. 1553).\n\nArt. 158 – § 1. If a party insists that a rejected proof be admitted, the college itself is to decide the matter expeditissime (cf. can. 1527, § 2).\n\n§ 2. The auditor in accordance with art. 50, § 3 can decide only in the interim, if a question of admitting a proof should happen to arise.\n\nArt. 159 – § 1. It is the right of the defender of the bond and the advocates of the parties:\n\n1o to be present for the examination of the parties, the witnesses and the experts, unless the judge, in regard to advocates, decides that because of the circumstances and persons involved, the proceeding should be done in secret;\n\n2o to view the judicial acts, even if not yet published, and to inspect documents produced by the parties (cf. cann. 1678, § 1; 1559).\n\n§ 2. The parties cannot be present at the examination mentioned in § 1, n. 1 (can. 1678, § 2).\n\nArt. 160 – Without prejudice to art. 120, the tribunal is not to proceed to collecting the proofs before the formulation of the doubt has been set in accordance with art. 135, except for a grave reason, since the formulation of the doubt is to delimit those things which are to be investigated (cf. can. 1529).\n\nArt. 161 – § 1. If a party or witness refuses to submit to a judicial examination in accordance with the following articles, it is permitted to hear them through a suitable person designated by the judge, or to ask for their declaration to be made before a notary public or in any other legitimate manner (cf. can. 1528).\n\n§ 2. Whenever the following articles cannot be observed in collecting the proofs, precautions must always be taken so that there is proof of their authenticity and integrity, avoiding any danger of fraud, collusion or corruption.\n\nChapter I\n\nThe judicial examination\n\nArt. 162 – § 1. The parties, the witnesses, and as the case may be, the experts are to be examined in the seat of the tribunal, unless the judge for a just reason thinks otherwise (cf. can. 1558, § 1).\n\n§ 2. Cardinals, Patriarchs, Bishops and those who by the law of their own state enjoy a similar favour are to be heard in a place of their choosing (can. 1558, § 2).\n\n§ 3. The judge is to decide where persons are to be heard for whom it would be impossible or difficult to come to the seat of the tribunal because of distance, illness or other impediment, without prejudice to the prescriptions of artt. 29; 51; 85 (cf. can. 1558, § 3).\n\nArt. 163 – § 1. The summons to the judicial examination is to be made by a decree of the judge legitimately communicated to the person to be questioned (cf. can. 1556).\n\n§ 2. The one who has been duly summoned is to appear or inform the judge without delay of the reason for his absence (cf. can. 1557).\n\nArt. 164 – The parties, either personally or through their advocates, and the defender of the bond are to exhibit, within a time limit set by the judge, the specific points of the matters about which the interrogation of the parties, witnesses or experts is being sought, without prejudice to art. 71 (cf. can. 1552, § 2).\n\nArt. 165 – § 1. The parties, witnesses and experts are each to be questioned individually and apart from one another (cf. can. 1560, § 1).\n\n§ 2. If however they disagree with one another in a grave matter, the judge can have the disagreeing parties discuss or confer between themselves, while avoiding disagreements and scandal as much as possible (cf. can. 1560, § 2).\n\nArt. 166 – The examination is to be carried out by the judge who must be assisted by a notary; therefore, without prejudice to art. 159, the defender of the bond or the advocates who are present for the examination, if they have further questions to be asked, are to propose them to the judge or the one taking the judge's place, so that he may put the questions, unless particular law provides otherwise (cf. can. 1561).\n\nArt. 167 – § 1. The judge is to remind the parties and the witnesses about their duty to speak the whole truth and only the truth, without prejudice to art. 194, § 2 (cf. can. 1562, § 1)(23).\n\n§ 2. The judge is also to have them take an oath to tell the truth, or at least an oath about the truth of the things they have already said, unless a grave cause would suggest otherwise; if someone should refuse to take an oath he is to make a promise to tell the truth (cf. cann. 1532; 1562, § 2).\n\n§ 3. The judge can also administer to them an oath, or if need be, a promise to keep secrecy.\n\nArt. 168 – The judge is first to establish the identity of the person to be questioned; he is to inquire what is his relationship with the parties and, when he is asking specific questions about the object of the cause, he is also to ask for the sources of this knowledge and in what specific moment of time the person came to know of what he is now asserting (cf. can. 1563).\n\nArt. 169 – The questions are to be brief, adapted to the capac- ity of the person being questioned, not involving several matters at the same time, not confusing, not tricky, not suggesting a response, avoiding any offensiveness, and pertinent to the cause in question (can. 1564).\n\nArt. 170 – § 1. The questions are not to be communicated in advance to the persons to be questioned (cf. can. 1565, § 1).\n\n§ 2. However, if it is a matter of things which are so remote from memory that they certainly cannot be affirmed unless they are first recalled, the judge can give the persons some advance notice, if he thinks that this can be done without danger (cf. can 1565, § 2).\n\nArt. 171 – The persons being questioned are to respond orally and are not to read anything written, unless it is a matter of explaining an expert report; in such case, the expert can consult the notes which he has brought with him (cf. can. 1566).\n\nArt. 172 – If the person to be questioned uses a language unknown to the judge, a sworn interpreter designated by the judge is to be employed. The declarations are still to be written down in the original language and the translation added. An interpreter is also to be used if a person with a speech or hearing impairment must be questioned, unless the judge should prefer that the questions which he proposes be answered in writing (cf. can. 1471).\n\nArt. 173 – § 1. The answer is to be written down immediately by the notary under the direction of the judge, and must relate the very words of the deposition, at least in regard to those things which directly touch on the matter of the trial (cf. can. 1567, § 1).\n\n§ 2. The use of a recording machine or a similar device can be admitted, as long as the responses are then put into writing and, if this can be done, signed by those giving the deposition (cf. can. 1567, § 2).\n\nArt. 174 – The notary is to make mention in the acts of the oath taken, postponed or refused, or the promise taken, postponed or refused, of the presence of the defender of the bond and advocates, of the questions added ex officio and in general of all things worthy of remembrance that may have happened during the examination (cf. can. 1568).\n\nArt. 175 – § 1. At the end of the examination, there must be read to the questioned person what the notary wrote down about his deposition, or the person must be made to listen to what was recorded concerning the deposition, giving him the faculty of adding, deleting, correcting and changing (cf. can. 1569, § 1).\n\n§ 2. Without prejudice to art. 89, the questioned person, the judge and the notary must sign the act, as must the defender of the bond and, if they are present, the promoter of justice and the advocates (cf. can. 1569, § 2).\n\n§ 3. If the device mentioned in art. 173, § 2 is used, an act attesting to this is to be drawn up with the signatures mentioned in § 2. The notary is also to authenticate the recording, taking care that it is preserved safely and intact.\n\nArt. 176 – The questioned person, although already interrogated, can be called again for an examination at the request of the defender of the bond or a party or ex officio, if the judge deems this necessary or useful, as long as there is no danger whatsoever of collusion or corruption (cf. can. 1570).\n\nChapter II\n\nSpecific proofs\n\n1. The declarations of the parties\n\nArt. 177 – In order to arrive better at the truth, the judge is to see that the parties are questioned (cf. can. 1530).\n\nArt. 178 – A party who has been legitimately questioned must respond and speak the truth wholly. If he refuses to respond, it pertains to the judge to evaluate what can be concluded from this for the purpose of proving the facts (cf. cann. 1531; 1534; 1548, § 2).\n\nArt. 179 – § 1. In accordance with can. 1535, an assertion about some fact, made in writing or orally before a competent judge by a party concerning the matter itself of the trial, whether spontaneously or at the questioning of the judge, and made against oneself, is a judicial confession.\n\n§ 2. However, in causes of the nullity of marriage a judicial confession is understood to be a declaration, made in writing or orally, "
