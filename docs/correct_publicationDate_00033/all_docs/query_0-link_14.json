        "text": "Eric Flint's impressive first novel, Motherof Demons (Baen), was selected by SF Chronicle as one of the best novels of 1997. With David Drake he has written five popular novels in the Belisarius series, and begun a new fantasy adventure series, so far comprising The Philosophical Strangler and Forward the Mage. Flint received his masters degree in history from UCLA and was for many years a labor union activist. He lives in East Chicago, IL, with his wife and is working on still more books in the Ring of Fire series.\n\nAndrew Dennis, in addition to co-writing the New York Times best seller, 1634: The Galileo Affair, had a story in Baen’s The Ring of Fire, and has had many non-fiction pieces published on the subjects of law and the paranormal. By way of a day job, he’s a lawyer and he lives in Preston, England with his wife and children."
