        "text": "There are some readers who will pick up book one in a series, read it cover to cover, then pick up the next book in the series and do the same, rinsing and repeating until they’ve finished the entire series. I am not one of these readers, and quite frankly they scare me. My approach to reading is a lot more scattershot. I’m not a mood reader though. As you may have guessed from my TBR & BEYOND posts, I like to have a rough idea of what I’m going to read in any given month. But when it comes to the actual order, I decide randomly. I literally roll dice to decide which book I’m going to read next. As you can imagine, this means I’m engaged in a lot of different series at any given time. While I only read one book at a time (again, people who read multiple books concurrently are a tad unsettling), I love having numerous series to bounce between.\n\nHowever, reading all over the place means I’m very hard to have a conversation with about what I’m currently reading, because it changes a lot. With the aim of enriching the conversation, here’s a list of every science fiction series I have on the go, as of May 2022.\n\nMars, by Ben Bova\n\nThis is a semi-placeholder for the larger Grand Tour universe, which consists of various smaller series and standalones. Mars is the only one I’ve started but not yet finished, and I’m two thirds of the way through the loose trilogy. Bova is one of those authors I could read endlessly, and has enough books to his name that I don’t have to space them out. However, copies are quite hard to come by in the UK, so I’m rationing what I do have until I can be a bit more organised in my reading.\n\nThe Lost Fleet: Outlands, by Jack Campbell\n\nHaving read Boundless, I’m up to date with Campbell’s Lost Fleet saga, of which this is the fifth series. Campbell is one of those novel-a-year types, which means he’s always got another book around the corner. If I find time, he’s also one of the few authors I’d consider a full reread of.\n\nThe Black Legion, by Aaron Dembski-Bowden\n\nOne of the problems with Black Library is that they’re not very good at keeping readers aware of when new books will be available. The last book of this trilogy has been hanging in potentiality for a few years now, and as such the saga of the Black Legion the only Space Marine story I’m actively waiting for.\n\nThe Caladan Trilogy, by Brian Herbert & Kevin J. Anderson\n\nThe timeline of the Dune universe is pretty dense these days, and this trilogy leading up to the original book is one I don’t think anyone was asking for. personally, I’d rather see the Heroes of Dune series return, or else explore a new era of the setting. Nevertheless, Herbert and Anderson are telling a fun little space opera story here, and I’m glad that Dune still lives on.\n\nCadia, by Justin D Hill\n\nThis is an odd one. Cadia Stands was a good piece of apocalyptic military SF that basically stood alone. But it also served as a prequel for the Minka Lesk novels. Cadian Honour was an okay book, decent without being anything remarkable. I almost didn’t pick up the next. A good thing I did though, because Traitor Rock is probably my favourite Warhammer 40,000 novel. While there’s no word on when the next book is coming, I’m looking forward to whatever the grim dark future may hold for Minka Lesk.\n\nFrontlines, by Marko Kloos\n\nI thought this series was finished after six volumes, but last year Kloos returned with the first in a new arc. It’s got a great setup, so it looks like this slice of military SF has a new lease of life.\n\nThe Palladium Wars, by Marko Kloos\n\nKloos’ other series also ongoing, and with the first four books having titles beginning with A,B,C, and D respectively, it seems as though he might have a twenty-six novel plan. The Palladium Wars is a bit more thoughtful than Frontlines, and is a brilliant example of how to bring different viewpoint characters together.\n\nNewbury & Hobbes, by George Mann\n\nEvery time I look at the release date for The Albion Initiative, the release date has been pushed further back. But these delays just make me more excited for the conclusion of the series that got me into steampunk. Plus, delayed releases mean more room for potential rereads.\n\nCiaphas Cain, by Sandy Mitchell\n\nThough I’ve only read the first three of this ten-book series, it remains high on my Warhammer priority list. I believe there is a reprint of the second omnibus on the way soon, and that is sure to bump it further into my schedule.\n\nVatta’s Peace, by Elizabeth Moon\n\nThe sequel series to Vatta’s War, this was my introduction to Elizabeth Moon. It has been several years now since the release of the second book, and I am starting to wonder if the third will ever see the light of day. If it does, I’ll be sure to read it. If not, I have plenty of other reading to do.\n\nThe Red, by Linda Nagata\n\nI don’t know why I haven’t got around to the rest of this trilogy yet. Availability of books certainly has an impact, but I remember the first book being an innovative piece of military SF. Definitely one to get back to before the end of the year.\n\nImperium, by Jody Lynn Nye\n\nA recent addition to this list, Nye’s bizarre comedic space opera is a reminder that I need to look at more Baen books. Baen books are basically non-existent in UK bookstores, but this is one series I’m keeping my eyes open for.\n\nThe Terro-Human Future History, by H. Beam Piper\n\nI started reading this series a decade and a half ago, and still I’ve only brushed the surface. As with a lot of older works, it’s hard to come by. But each Piper novel is a delight, and above all others, this is the series I am hunting down copies of.\n\nSun Eater, by Christopher Ruocchio\n\nMy favourite ongoing series, Sun Eater is blessed by an author who is prolific and regular with his releases. Ashes of Man is out in December, and there are still two more to come after that.\n\nChildren of Time, by Adrian Tchaikovsky\n\nThe standalone epic that gained an equally brilliant sequel now has a third book on the way. I know it’s called Children of Memory, but other than that I’m trying to go in blind.\n\nThe Final Architecture, by Adrian Tchaikovsky\n\nKeeping up with Tchaikovsky releases is a TBR in itself, but this one is a bit more traditionally space operatic than most of his work. It’s more accessible, and perhaps more fun. I have book two on my windowsill right now, and plan to read it later this month.\n\nManticore Ascending, by David Weber, Timothy Zahn, and Thomas Pope\n\nAfter reading about twenty books in two years, I burned out on the Honorverse. But after a bit of a break, I’m eager to go back to this prequel series and see where Manticore began.\n\nCrown of Slaves, by David Weber & Eric Flint\n\nAnother Honorverse entry, this series is probably the weak link in the universe. Nevertheless, I am completionist at heart, and as there is only one book left to read in the Crown of Slaves series, I want to know how it all ends.\n\nThere’s probably something I’m forgetting, but there you have it. If you’re also a multi-series madman like myself, let me know in the comments. I may be spread thin already, but I’m always on the lookout for new series to dive into."
