If you are already one of David's readers, we hope that you will find everything you are looking for here, and if you haven't read David's work yet, we hope that this site will encourage you to head over to the Baen Free Library at www.baen.com/library and pick up one of his stories to read for yourself! Just a note for everyone with a Kindle or Nook: David's Baen stories are available in electronic format at www.baen.com. For more information, visit our FAQ section!\n\nNote From David: Like a lot of successful writers, I am constantly finding myself short of time, and whenever I go online to talk to fans, I find myself staying for hours and hours and hours... So, I am extraordinarily grateful to Derick Chan for keeping things in order on the site and for managing the forums. Thanks Derick."
