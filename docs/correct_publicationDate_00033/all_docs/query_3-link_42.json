Wentworth\n\nPublication Order of Ring of Fire Books\n\nChronological Order of Ring of Fire Books\n\nPublication Order of Standalone Novels\n\nPublication Order of Short Stories/Novellas\n\nPublication Order of Ring of Fire Press Books\n\nPublication Order of Ring of Fire Anthology Books\n\nPublication Order of The Fallen World Books\n\nPublication Order of Anthologies\n\nA David Carrico novel is speculative fiction at its best. It introduces you to how life would have changed- if history had.\n\nDavid’s novels have much to offer. We introduce you to the man, review his SF books and tell you why they are so difficult to put down.\n\nBiography: Who is David Carrico?\n\nThink of speculative fiction, and David Carrico’s name comes to mind immediately. The genre has become a part of him, and you cannot pry him from it.\n\nSo how did he get started?\n\nDavid’s love for speculative fiction began in the sixth grade. He discovered his love for writing after he picked up a particularly bad novel and realized that he could write better than its author.\n\nHe has André Norton to thank for fueling his passion; he became enraptured with the possibilities of aliens and other worlds when he started reading books by the speculative fiction guru.\n\nDavid began to dabble in speculative fiction himself. The SF enthusiast wrote many novels and articles over the years. He, too, began to toy with the ideas of outer worlds and life on other planets. He reached his first writing milestone in 2004 when he sold his first book.\n\nHis talent has not gone unnoticed. The Grantville Gazette e-magazine has featured his stories regularly since his first book sale. He has also contributed to the Ring of Fire anthologies, volumes of stories that are popular to this day.\n\nDavid went on to publish a story in the e-magazine, Jim Baen’s Universe. The talented author reached another milestone in 2013 when Baen published two more of his books. The first, 1635: Music and Murder was a set of his earlier works. The other, 1635: The Devil’s Opera, was co-written with prolific SF author Eric Flint.\n\nDavid and Eric have become a dynamic SF duo. The two have co-written The Span of Empire, the novel in the Jao Series by Eric.\n\nThe Author’s Works\n\n1. 1635: Music and Murder\n\nIf you’re a science, history, and music lover, you need to pour through 1635: Music and Murder.\n\nThe novel surrounds a group of musicians from 1635 who, like other artists, want to start the newest trend. Each seeks to develop the sound of the moment.\n\nThis novel is a riveting read because it arouses curiosity. People wonder what would happen if their ancestors hear the music they play or see how far technology has come. David answers this in this novel; he discusses what happens if musicians from 1635 were to hear music by the Beatles or the grunge rock group, Nirvana.\n\nThrow in murder and the novel becomes even harder to put down. David mixes history, crime, and intrigue – an explosive combination.\n\nHe brings readers through the Thirty Years War, one of the bloodiest religious battles in European history. It was a fight between Protestant and Catholic states.\n\nFor those who believe that David has penned another boring historical novel, think again.\n\nHe introduces futuristic Grantville and its people to the war front. The city has ideologies and technology that have the Europeans enraptured. David makes readers imagine how it is like to enforce law and order at a time when there would not have been much support for it. The streets and roads are lonely and of course, mean.\n\nNaturally, there are offbeat characters, which never fail to please. Detective Byron Chieske and down-timing boxing champion Gothiff Hoch try their best to fix the chaos.\n\n1635: Music and Murder is a novel in which art meets science, an idea which fascinates. Crime and murder make it more gripping than it already is.\n\n2. 1636: The Devil’s Opera\n\nHis other breakthrough was 1636: The Devil’s Opera, co-written with fellow SF enthusiast, Eric Flint.\n\nBesides being speculative fiction, this novel is a political discussion. The Devil’s Opera explores what happens when Sweden, under the leadership of King Gustavus Adolphus and the euro-centric West Virginians in the United States combine to form a new nation, The United States of Europe. The country is on the brink of Civil War, with the people seeking to overthrow the ruling class.\n\nDavid introduces complex political intrigue, which never fails to grip. Oxenstierna, a chancellor in King Gustav’s court, leads the fight against the revolutionaries. He seeks to assemble the ruling class in Berlin and crush the revolution.\n\nAt the same time, Rebecca Abrabanel, the wife of West Virginian revolutionary Mike Steams, is building resistance to Oxenstierna. She connects with American musician Maria Linder and her band of artists, who plan to stage an opera as part of the resistance movement.\n\nThe political intrigue becomes denser when Princess Kristina, heir to the USE throne, comes into the picture and lends support to the campaign. The thrilling political infighting makes it difficult to stop reading this book.\n\nIf politics isn’t enough, David throws crime into the mix. Once again, the novel’s beloved protagonists, Byron Chieske and former boxing champion Gotthilf Hoch try their best to stop the plotting and counter-plotting before it’s too late.\n\nThis novel is a gripping exploration of history, politics, and crime. David touches on all three with linguistic skill and finesse. He speculates rationally and never fails to enthrall the reader.\n\n3. Jao\n\nJao, also co-written with Flint, is a New York Times bestseller.\n\nIf you have a passionate belief that other beings exist throughout the galaxy, this novel is a must-read. David and Eric consider what happens when other-world beings, the Jao, join with humans and the Leix people to defeat the Ekhat, who are terrorizing the universe.\n\nDavid introduces a magnetic character, Preceptor Ronz, who serves as Earth’s guardian. He appoints Caitlin Kralik as the commander of an expedition that scours the galaxy in search of allies who wish to fight the Ekhat.\n\nThis novel brings to mind other SF classics like Star Trek or the Game of Thrones.Like these works, it explores what happens when nations are at war. They, too, seek political connections.\n\nDavid is a master of suspense. Read this if you love discovery.\n\n4. The Evening of the Day: A Novella\n\nThe Evening of The Day was a novella published in the Grantville Gazette in 2013.\n\nDavid comes up with another formula that always works on readers. In this novel, he plays with the fates of timeless, favorite historical characters like D’Artagnan, Galileo, Oliver Cromwell, and Gustav Adolph.\n\nWhen raucous, tough West Virginia coal miners and the 17th Century nobility come together, the tension is explosive. The bloodiest civil war in Western history breaks out.\n\nIf you’re a history buff, you’ll find David’s exploration of 17th-century Western Civilization fascinating. What makes it enthralling is that famous historical figures come together. Their ideologies, which people recognize them for, fuse in an exciting, pulsating way.\n\nYou’ve not read the best speculative fiction until you’ve touched a David Carrico novel. His knowledge of history and culture is unsurpassable, as is his ability to create exciting possibilities."
