I've tried to indicate such overlap where it might make sense to read the books out of order, or where it might be possible to skip some books in order to follow regional threads without exposure to spoilers. (And I have a VERY broad definition of what constitutes a spoiler.)",

Some of the characters (most notably, the Stone family) in subsequent books are either introduced or expanded beyond mere mentions, but the subsequent books adequately bring the reader up to speed. The only story that might be considered fully \"necessary\" might be the final novela, \"The Wallenstein Gambit\", because it sets up and explains an important political situation that did NOT happen in the real world.

(The plot for \"The Devil's Opera\" runs concurrently with the events described in \"The Saxon Uprising\" and makes frequent references to that prior novel.) __________ Features characters who appeared in previously published short stories by David Carrico, but this novel is excellent in re-introducing those characters to readers who may not have access to those prior works.

Sufficient context given for those unfamiliar with the series, but it's strongly recommended that readers read the thread of novels leading up to \"1636: The Saxon Uprising\" first. Also contains a side spoiler for \"1635: The Papal Stakes\" in that it features the continuing story of a character who faced mortal danger in that prior novel.
