Gibson’s books all /kind of/ tie in)\n\nNeuromancer - I have a beat up copy in the pocket of my trench, have probably read it a hundred or so times. Close second: Walter Mosley’s Futureland.\n\nBoth rather distopian cyberpunk, the worldbuilding and story are top notch in both, Gibson especially can make you hurt with a few lines of prose.\n\n“They damaged his nervous system with a wartime Russian mycotoxin. Strapped to a bed in a Memphis hotel, his talent burning out micron by micron, he hallucinated for thirty hours. The damage was minute, subtle, and utterly effective. For Case, who’d lived for the bodiless exultation of cyberspace, it was the Fall.” - Neuromancer\n\n“A generation from now, things aren’t much different from today: The drugs are better, the daily grind is worse. The world’s knowledge fits on a chip in your little finger, the Constitution doesn’t apply to individuals, and it’s a crime to be poor.” -Futureland"
