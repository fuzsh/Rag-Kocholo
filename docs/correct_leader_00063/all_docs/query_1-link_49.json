I recommend having a few predreads at game start as otherwise you will get events that will tank your prestige, something you can ill afford in the early game.\n\nInterestingly having a few battleships was an element of the actual young school, with the intent to force the enemy to try to engage them allowing for their destruction by the superior light forces espoused by the doctrine.\n\nPost by JagdFlanker on\n\nactually i'v done that a fair amount in the past with smaller countries - build heavy CA's instead of B's, then switch exclusively to BC's for the rest of the game\n\nif you build a B with 10\" guns the game calls it a CA, but perhaps not when you build your initial fleet\n\nexpect your BCs to get chewed up a bit later when fire control gets sharper, but if you keep building them they'r like shark teeth - one falls out and another comes in to take it's place\n\nPost by oldpop2000 on\n\nHas anyone tried a game without building B/BB's?

I play at a rate of about 10 game years per real-world month, so it might be a bit aggravating for folks.\n\nI've played Japan a couple of times without armored cruisers and battleships. You just have to be as careful as you can and avoid major engagements. You have to play a guerre de course. It's best to emphasize submarines and build as many as possible. I won the game every time so it can be done with prudence. He who fights and runs away, lives to fight another day.\n\nPost by akosjaccik on\n\nAs A-H, small&historical I had the pleasure to opt for BCs without any dreadnoughts once, and I have fond memories of that instance, though I did not ditch the early battleships, so my transition looked rather like B -> BC. In the late game I went for a reliable pack of standardized battelcruisers and a good amount of expensive and well-equipped destroyers / destroyer leaders without anything else really (flk speed 32 kts for both), apart from subs and the occassional AMCs - and it turned out excellent. As my entire doctrine was based on battlecruiser warfare, I had nothing to fear of anything short of a dreadnought, and those were still dealt with one after the other, and the loss of a capital ship here or there was \"calculated\" in the system.\n\nI do stress thought that this was played with a small nation, small size and small resources, focusing only on the Mediterranean.\n\nPost by director on\n\nOne work-around is to build massive numbers of raiders during wartime and submarines during peacetime. That way you can attempt to degrade your enemy's morale while you hunt for a way to stay reasonably close in victory conditions.\n\nThe game is going to generate a lot of cruiser-type missions, so I would advise you to build impressive light cruisers. Armored cruisers, after around 1918, are rarely called on. When I build them, I staff my overseas colonies with them. Battlecruisers can be a good investment as long as you can avoid action with enemy battleships, but you will need a number of destroyers with heavy gun power and 8(+) torpedo tubes.\n\nPost by dorn on\n\nOne work-around is to build massive numbers of raiders during wartime and submarines during peacetime.

Building 6000 tons cruisers you are not going to build something much better, usually one knot faster and half inch better belt armor which is not worth about 50 % increase of costs.\n\nAnd numbers are important As it increase chance that you get overhelming numbers of them in generated scenarios.\n\nUp to your ability to build light cruiser with all centerline turrets and with B and V turrets, the cruiser progress is signaficant. After that up to double turrets for CL it is more about efficiency and thus speed for the allowed costs.\n\nPost by director on\n\ncwemyss - I see that we think alike. A big CL can be faster and more-heavily-armed. I can usually depend on one of my big CLs being able to sink 2 AI-designed CLs, so numbers do not become such a factor.\n\nA 5\"(+1) gun, I found, has much the same penetration and range performance as a standard 6\", especially in the early years, and the lesser weight of the mount permits more to be fitted (or the same battery, speed and protection to be carried on less displacement).\n\nI have had success with a cruiser design built around a 4\" gun (18 in 6x3 mounts if I remember). They were small, fast and easily killed if the enemy held the range open. But if the range closed, it was like taking a machine-gun to a car; no CL can take 5 to 15 4\" hits a turn and live. I would highly recommend the concept to players fighting in areas prone to fog, rain and night actions. I saw those as an interesting experiment, not a primary design."
