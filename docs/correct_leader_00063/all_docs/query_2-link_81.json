        "text": "1894\n\nWarned by the Spanish Military Attaché Valcarlos, the French Intelligence Services, headed by Colonel Sandherr, have been carefully watching secret correspondence between the German and Italian Military Attachés, Maximilian von Schwartzkoppen and Alessandro Panizzardi. Germany and Italy are at that time allied with Austria in a military union (the Triple Alliance) hostile to France.\n\nJuly 20 : Infantry Major Ferdinand Walsin-Esterhazy who, through occasional contacts with the General Staff, was exposed to classified French information, offers his services to the German Military Attaché, Lieutenant-Colonel von Schwartzkoppen, promising to pass on military secrets.\n\nSeptember 26 : The French Intelligence Services intercept a message (from Esterhazy, but not signed), received Sept 1, 1894 by Schwartzkoppen.\n\nFrom the nature of the leaks in this memorandum -- the \"bordereau,\"-- they conclude that the spy must be an artillery officer and a member of the General Staff. In addition, the traitor may have been in contact with different bureaus as an intern.\n\nOctober 6 : After a brief inquiry, only half a dozen officers seem to match the description, including Captain Alfred Dreyfus, an artillery officer on the General Staff. He is from Alsace, a French province under German rule since the Franco-Prussian war (1870-1871), and some members of his wealthy family still reside there. As a probationary officer since January 1893, he has rotated through most of the bureaus of the Ministry of War. He is also Jewish, a fact noted by Sandherr and his deputy Colonel Fabre, both openly antisemitic. They communicate their unsupported suspicions to General Mercier, the Minister of War in the Charles Dupuy Cabinet.\n\nOctober 15 : After consulting reputable handwriting experts, but still lacking incriminating evidence, General Mercier along with the heads of the General Staff, General de Boisdeffre and his deputy in charge of Intelligence, General Gonse, are now convinced that Dreyfus has been privy to the information leaked to the Germans. In order to obtain an irrefutable handwriting sample, Commandant du Paty de Clam, placed in charge of the investigation, calls Dreyfus and feigns to dictate him a letter based on the wording of the \"bordereau.\" Since the two documents appear to match, Dreyfus is accused of spying and arrested, despite his protestations of innocence. He is sent immediately to the Cherche-Midi military prison.\n\nOctober 31 : Through a leak from the Headquarters, Edouard Drumont, the publisher of the anti-Semitic paper La Libre Parole, learns of Captain Dreyfus's indictment. The evening issue of Le Soir publicly identifies him, followed the next day by La Libre Parole, which starts a virulent campaign against the Jewish officer.\n\nNovember 3 : Major d'Ormescheville starts the judicial investigation of the case. His final report, Dec. 3, 1894, recommends a Court-martial.\n\nDecember 19-22 :During the Dreyfus Court-martial, held in closed session, the judges still hesitate over the evidence, including a ludicrous demonstration from the handwriting expert Bertillon. Obeying orders from General Mercier, Major Henry gives the judges an incriminating file which contains a letter dated May 1894 from the German Military Attaché mentioning \"this scoundrel of D...\" However, in the name of national security, Dreyfus' defense lawyer Edgar Demange, a civilian, is not made aware of this \"dossier secret\".\n\nThe Military Court is now persuaded by the evidence and thus unanimously pronounces Dreyfus guilty of high treason. Professing his innocence, he is nevertheless condemned to perpetual deportation and military degradation.\n\nDecember 31 : Dreyfus' petition for appeal is rejected.\n\n1895\n\nApril 13 : Dreyfus is transferred to Devil's Island, where he will be placed in solitary confinement.\n\nJuly 1 : After a long illness, Colonel Sandherr dies. A new Chief of Intelligence Services, Lieutenant-Colonel Georges Picquart, another Alsatian like Dreyfus, is chosen among the General staff officers, bypassing Major Henry.\n\nOctober 28 : New Cabinet, with Prime Minister Léon Bourgeois.\n\n1896\n\nMarch Another intercepted express letter --\"le petit bleu\"-- which this time bears Major Esterhazy's signature-- is intercepted.\n\nApril 29 : New Cabinet, with Prime Minister Jules Méline. General Billot is Minister of War.\n\nJuly, 30 : Opening the Dreyfus file to check similarities between the \"petit bleu\" and the leaked documents from 1894, Picquart gradually realizes that all the evidence brought against Dreyfus, notably the \"bordereau,\" which he can compare with the \"petit bleu,\" is actually the work of Esterhazy.\n\nAugust 5 : Picquart informs the Chief of the General Staff, General de Boisdeffre, of his suspicions about Esterhazy as the actual spy.\n\nSeptember 3 : Efforts by Picquart to convince the Deputy Chief of the General Staff, General Gonse, of Dreyfus' innocence again prove unsuccessful. He is now considered as a whistle-blower who could bring embarrassment to the General Staff if he keeps insisting in reopening Dreyfus' earlier investigation.\n\nEnglish newspapers are circulating the false news of Dreyfus' escape from Devil's island.\n\nImmediate measures are taken to prevent any future attempts. At night, Dreyfus is kept in irons.\n\nSeptember 14 : Tipped by a leak from Headquarters, an article in L'Eclair mentions for the first time the incriminating secret file communicated to the judges alone during the trial of December 1894. In trying to definitely prove Dreyfus' treason, the paper even quotes -wrongly, but conveniently- the letter mentioning \"this scoundrel of D...\" now transformed into \"this scoundrel of Dreyfus\".\n\nSeptember 18 : Citing the revelation of a secret file as new evidence for a mistrial, Lucie Dreyfus petitions the Chamber of Deputies in the name of her husband.\n\nHenry starts tampering with documents in order to incriminate definitely Dreyfus and discredit Picquart later.\n\nOctober 27 : General de Boisdeffre and General Gonse transfer Picquart from his position and send him to a mission far removed from Paris.\n\nOctober 31 : With Picquart now out of the way, Major Henry conveniently produces new evidence: a letter allegedly from the Italian Embassy to the German Attaché specifically naming Dreyfus as their contact. This document, fabricated by master-forger Lemercier-Picard -an agent of Henry-, will be later known as \"le faux Henry.\"\n\nNovember 6 : The wife and the brother of the convicted officer, Lucie and Mathieu Dreyfus, continue to fight untiringly in the hope of a fairer trial. Inspired by their efforts, the writer Bernard-Lazare publishes his brochure Une Erreur judiciaire [A Judicial Error: The Truth on the Dreyfus Affair ] in Brussels, marking the point of departure for a retrial.\n\nNovember 10 : Thanks to another leak from Headquarters, Le Matin boastingly publishes the copy of the first incriminating document of 1894, the \"bordereau,\" as evidence of Dreyfus' treason.\n\nDecember General Gonse sends trouble-maker Picquart to a dangerous mission in Tunisia where rebels are rising up against French colonial rule.\n\n1897\n\nJune, 21-26 : On a short leave in Paris, fearing retaliation, Picquart shares his convictions with the lawyer Me Louis Leblois, a long time friend from Alsace, but asks him not to reveal publicly his secret.\n\nJuly 13 : Picquart's lawyer Me Leblois meets with the Vice-President of the Senate, the Alsatian Auguste Scheurer-Kestner, who becomes convinced of Dreyfus's innocence as well and starts his own investigation. However, sworn to secrecy by Leblois, and because the Intelligence Office still keeps all documents restricted to civilians, Scheurer-Kestner cannot find any significant proof of the frame-up. Even during an interview with Mathieu Dreyfus, Scheurer-Kestner refuses identifying Esterhazy because of his promise of silence to Leblois.\n\nUnable to provide evidence of his claim, the cancer ridden Scheurer-Kestner is ridiculed by the anti-Semitic press as totally senile and bribed by a Jewish interest lobby.\n\nAugust 17 : War Minister General Billot has Esterhazy retired from active duty in the Army \"for temporary infirmity,\" because is has become an embarrassment.\n\nOctober 16 : At a meeting with Billot, Gonse, Henry and du Paty de Clam decide to warn Esterhazy of the accusations pointed at him.\n\nOctober 18 : Esterhazy receives a letter conceived by dy Paty de Clam, written by Mme Henry and signed \"Espérance\", warning him to be more careful.\n\nOctober 23 : Esterhazy sees Schwartzkoppen for the last time. Later that day, in parc Montsouris, he has a secret interview with du Paty de Clam in disguise, who promises to protect him..\n\nOctober 29 : Scheurer-Kestner has an inconclusive interview with President Félix Faure.\n\nOctober 30 : Scheurer-Kestner has lunch with his old friend General Billot, who asks him to be patient.\n\nNovember 3 : Scheurer-Kestner has an interview with Prime Minister Méline.\n\nNovember 6 : Bernard-Lazare meets with Emile Zola.\n\nNovember 8 : Me Leblois visits Zola.\n\nNovember 10 : Esterhazy, with Henry or du Paty de Clam's approval, sends anonymous letters to Scheurer-Kestner requesting clandestine meetings, then has his mistress, Marguerite Pays, address send mysterious notes signed \"Speranza\" and \"Blanche\" to Picquart. Forged messages are also planted in his file to make him appear as the fabricator of the \"petit bleu,\" which he himself had discovered in March 1896.\n\nNovember 11 : By a twist of fate, Mr. de Castro, a stock-broker from South America, notices a facsimile of the bordereau on sale at a newspaper stand -- thanks to Mathieu Dreyfus' efforts to publicize it as much as possible, in the hope that someone would recognize the handwriting. Realizing that it matches that of one of his clients, Major Esterhazy, he immediately contacts Mathieu Dreyfus.\n\nNovember 12 : Mathieu Dreyfus goes to see Sheurer-Kestner to check if Esterhazy is the same individual whose identity he has sworn not to reveal. Scheurer-Kestner can finally confirms that Esterhazy is the actual traitor.\n\nNovember 12-13 : At his home, Scheurer-Kestner has a meeting with Matthieu Dreyfus, Leblois and Zola.\n\nOn Devil's Island, Dreyfus' hut is surrounded by a double eight feet high stockade.\n\nNovember 13 : German authorities order Schwartzkoppen to leave his post in Paris.\n\nNovember 15 : Scheurer-Kestner declares Dreyfus innocent in an open letter to Le Temps.\n\nSchwartzkoppen leaves Paris for his new position.\n\nNovember 16 : Mathieu Dreyfus writes the Minister of Justice denouncing Esterhazy as the author of the \"bordereau\" and sues him.\n\nNovember 17 : Because of the accusation, the Military Governor of Paris, General Saussier, orders the opening of an inquest on Esterhazy conducted by General de Pellieux.\n\nNovember 25 : Zola starts a campaign in favor of Dreyfus' cause in Le Figaro.\n\nNovember 26 : Picquart is recalled to Paris to be questioned as part of the Esterhazy investigation.\n\nNovember 28 : Le Figaro starts publishing a correspondance from Esterhazy that one of his spurned mistresses, Madame de Boulancy, has communicated to the newspaper in which he vents his contempt for the French, even dreaming to become a German Uhlan.\n\nDecember 3 : General de Pellieux's inquest exonerating Esterhazy is followed by a second judicial investigation on him, conducted by Major Ravary.\n\nDecember 4 : Prime Minister Jules Méline declares at the National Assembly: \"There is NO Dreyfus affair whatsoever.\"\n\nDecember 7 : Scheurer-Kestner tries to rally his colleagues at the Senate but no avail. He is only supported by Ludovic Trarieux, Senator of the department of Gironde.\n\nDecember 13 : Zola publishes \"Letter to youth.\"\n\nDecember 26 : Three handwriting experts, Belhomme, Varinard and Couard, declare the bordereau not to be by Esterhazy's hand.\n\n1898\n\nJanuary 1 : Final report by Ravary concludes that a case against Esterhazy lacks evidence and that there is no need for Court-martial. General Saussier however decides with Esterhazy that demanding a Court-martial is the best course to clear him completely.\n\nJanuary 4 : Zola publishes \"Letter to France.\"\n\nJanuary 6 : Ludovic Trarieux publishes an open letter in Le Temps.\n\nJanuary 10-11 : Esterhazy is brought to trial, which is soon held in closed session. He is quickly unanimously acquitted by the Court-martial.\n\nIronically, Colonel Picquart is indicted for revealing military secrets to civilians and is put under arrest at the Mont-Valérien military prison.\n\nUnder pressure from the Dreyfus family, Scheurer-Kestner meets with more celebrities who now believe that Dreyfus has been unfairly convicted. Among those \"intellectuals\", as they are referred to by the anti-Dreyfusard press, are Joseph Reinach, Marcel Prévost, Anatole France, George Clémenceau, and Emile Zola.\n\nJanuary 21 : The three handwriting experts, \"accused\" by Zola, start a formal suit for libel.\n\nFebruary 7-23 : Emile Zola's trial takes place in the Cour d'Assises de la Seine (Palace of Justice, Paris) with Clemenceau 's brother and Labori as his defense.\n\nHis sensationalistic trial hearings are accompanied by numerous incidents: witnesses are silenced; General de Boisdeffre intimidates the Jury; opponents begin a campaign to defame Zola's family; anti-Semitic hoodlums mob the Court premises; Clémenceau and Drumont, then Picquart and Henry fight in a duel; riots erupt in Paris. Public opinion is divided: out of sincere concern or for more absurd reasons, every level of society becomes involved and takes sides.\n\nDuring the trial, however, General de Pellieux inadvertently acknowledges the existence of the secret file that was distributed to the judges at Dreyfus' unfair military trial of 1894 and quotes the document produced by Henry Oct. 31 1896, the \"faux Henry,\" thereby offering new evidence for a re-trial.\n\nFebruary 18 : In a waitig room of the Law-Courts, Ludovic Trarieux with other witnesses for the defence of Zola, decide to create a league for the defence of human rights : la Ligue française pour la défense des Droits de l'Homme et du citoyen.\n\nFebruary 23 : Zola is convicted and receives the maximum sentence for libel: one year in jail and a fine of 3000 Francs.\n\nFebruary 26 : By decree, Picquart is dismissed from the Army\n\nZola appeals against the judgement\n\nMarch 13 : Lemercier-Picard, author of the forged letter quoted by General de Pellieux a month earlier (the \"faux Henry\"), is found hanging from the window-catch of his hotel bed-room. Circumstances of death remain unclear.\n\nApril 2 : Agreeing on reason of legal technicality, the Court of Appeals overturns the verdict of February 23 granting Zola a new trial.\n\nMay 23 : Second Zola trial in Versailles.

Godefroy Cavaignac is Minister of War.\n\nJuly 7 : In an attempt to close the case by producing genuine proofs, Cavaignac, unwittingly presents the National Assembly documents which include a piece of forged evidence, \"le faux Henry\". Picquart and the Socialist leader Jean Jaurès, however, publicly denounce the falseness of this evidence and challenge Cavaignac.\n\nJuly 9 : Zola is convicted of libel in the three handwriting experts' libel trial: 2 weeks suspended prison sentence, fine of 2000 Francs, plus 5000 Francs in damages to each of the handwriting experts.\n\nJuly 12 : Esterhazy is charged with swindling his nephew and having sent forged telegrams to Picquartin November 1897.\n\nJuly 13 : Picquart arrested for the second time on charges brought by Cavaignac for having divulged military documents to Leblois, a civilian.\n\nJuly 18 : Second Zola trial, in Versailles.\n\nZola is convicted again and sentenced to one year in prison and fined 2,000 Francs.\n\nIn order to avoid the notice of the sentence being served and to continue fighting, Zola takes refuge in England.

This particular document is the one so conveniently produced by Lt.-Col. Henry in October 1896 (the \"faux Henry\") and that Cavaignac has mentionned in the National Assembly, on July 7. Cuignet accuses Henry of having forged the documents to insure Dreyfus' certain condemnation. Henry's still debatable motives might have been to cover Esterhazy (possibly then used as a double agent) and protect his superiors from self-incrimination.\n\nAugust 27 : Esterhazy dismissed from the army for \"habitual misconduct.\"\n\nAugust 30-31 : Henry confesses his perjuries against Dreyfus to Cavaignac.
