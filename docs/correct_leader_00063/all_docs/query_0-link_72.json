        "text": "The Teaching Assistant Program in France, a highly selective government-sponsored program, offers unique opportunities to work in France for 7 months, teaching English to French students of all ages. Each year, over 1,500 American citizens and permanent residents teach in public schools across all regions of metropolitan France and in the overseas departments of France such as French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique and Réunion.\n\nIn 2020, two SCU graduates, both French Majors, were selected to participate in this program. This is what they have to say to other prospective TAPIF students…\n\nMaggie Doyle is in Valence at the lycée Emile Loubet. She is the only English language assistant at the school and is helping out with all secondary age levels. Her advice for other students that want to apply, is to start on the application as early as possible. “Though it’s fairly straightforward, there are a few aspects which take a certain amount of time, like the two professor recommendations. It is best to give your professors as much time as possible to write you the best possible recommendation.” Also, with regard to choosing professors— she says to make sure to choose ones who know you personally and at least one who is really familiar with your skill level in French. This will help your application to seem authentic and to accurately represent your command of the language in order to best place you within the program. Her French courses at SCU helped prepare her for the experience, she felt in particular that the writing workshop course gave her a handle on how to write a collegiate-level paper in French, which was imperative when developing the essay response on the application."
