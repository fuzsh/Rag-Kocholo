        "text": "If you are told National 7‚Ä¶. Mont√©limar‚Ä¶. We immediately think: Nougat!\n\nIt is undeniable, this world-famous confectionery evokes the south of France, the holiday route, the break on the highway‚Ä¶ We all remember biting into a Mont√©limar nougat. Perhaps you even have that childhood memory of losing a tooth there!?!!!!!!!!)\n\nThe history of the nougat of Mont√©limar\n\nYou are well at the gates of the sun, in the heart of the south, between the Ard√®che and Provence, where you can hear the cicadas in summer and where the first lavender fields appear: welcome to Mont√©limar the nougat capital !\n\nThe nougat made its appearance in Dr√¥me Proven√ßale in the second half of the 17th century without it ever being possible to find the name of its creator ! We simply know that Olivier de Serres introduced the first almond trees to the region at the end of the 16√®me si√®cle.\n\nThe history of Mont√©limar nougat was born thanks to the cultivation of almond trees and the breeding of bees: almond and honey being the two main ingredients of nougat !\n\nFor the little story‚Ä¶\n\nThe international reputation of nougat has been achieved thanks to √âmile Loubet. A local man, born near Mont√©limar, he was President of the Republic from 1899 to 1906. It is said that he offered nougats to all the personalities passing through the Elys√©e. Thus, it made it possible to make this sweet treat known abroad.\n\nThe third factor that has made nougat known is the geographical situation of the city. Mont√©limar is ideally located on the holiday road. Many people stop there: it is the pause between the north and south of France.\n\nMoreover, the Mont√©limar-Sud highway area is the busiest in summer, and you will see, nougat is very well represented there üòâ\n\nWhere to buy Mont√©limar nougat ?\n\nA little everywhere in the city and in the surroundings: shops, factories, confectionery‚Ä¶ and on Proven√ßal markets ! During your stay in Mont√©limar, take the opportunity to visit a nougat factory. Many nougateries offer visits to their manufacturing workshops. In the city centre, come and see this huge fresco on the pretty square of Europe, this little girl surrounded by nougat attracts our attention‚Ä¶\n\nDid you know?\n\nTo qualify for the designation ‚ÄúNougat de Mont√©limar‚Äù, the nougat must consist of at least 30% amonds and 25% honey, with at least 7% lavender honey. His recipe also includes sugar, egg white, vanilla and pistachios.\n\nThe country most in demand for nougat after France is England !\n\nYou are more of a soft or hard nougat?\n\nThe difference is in the cooking. In the hard nougat, the sugar is cooked at a higher temperature, which hardens it later. In the soft nougat, more honey and egg white are often added for the softness.\n\nIf you don‚Äôt know yet, all you have to do is taste it!"
