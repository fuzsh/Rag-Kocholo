        "text": "Through the signature of the Entente Cordiale, France and Great Britain settled their colonial disputes in non-European territories and started the cooperation. The entente became a milestone towards the birth of the alliances, which later clashed in the First World War. Based mainly on the non-published documents, this contribution tries to analyze the motives that permitted the Anglo-French rapprochement from 1898–1904. Attention is paid to the influences of the world diplomacy on the development of the negotiations. Furthermore, this article deals with the Moroccan points of contention between France and Great Britain, which together with the Egyptian question, were of crucial and strategic importance for the development of the Anglo-French relations.\n\nOn the occasion of the 55th anniversary of the Élysée Treaty this study deals with the historical development of Franco-German relations in the 20th century. The focus is on the historical models of rapprochement between the two nations. The author presents in detail the possibilities for cooperation in the interwar years (with a special focus on civil integration). This period may be considered one of the most intensive periods of the French-German reconciliation. Bases that the parties could build on after 1945 were founded as the ideas were similar. Following the successes of the large-scale policy, numerous other very important steps were needed to minimise mutual mistrust in the peoples of the two states. This led to a large number of various organisations and cooperations. The patterns presented here greatly influenced communication after 1945. In the second part of the study the author presents the origin and effect of the Élysée Treaty with some new aspects of the history of diplomacy. Of the numerous new initiatives, the author focuses primarily on civil ones. The great innovation brought about by the treaty, however, was the strong involvement of the civil societies of both countries, particularly in education, research, culture and youth exchanges. As a result of historical cooperation “Erbfeinde” (hereditary enemies) have become “Erbfreunde” (hereditary friends) within the European integration.\n\nThe Treaty of Amiens, which brought an end to almost a decade of Franco-British warfare in March 1802, has long been understood as a flawed attempt at peace making. The British government’s surrender of most of its wartime colonial acquisitions, combined with a failure to push for guarantees on the Continent, has been interpreted as a meek acquiescence in France’s domination over Western Europe. The recommencement of war in May 1803 simply seems to confirm the supposition that the treaty was fundamentally inadequate. This article questions that interpretation by examining Britain’s relations with and policies towards Europe, and above all towards the Netherlands, during the period of negotiation and subsequent peace, 1800-3. It suggests that the British government did not conceive Amiens as the surrender of key interests, but as a base from which British influence could be reasserted. By looking at the context of Britain’s historical connections to the Netherlands, their experience ...\n\nDuring the First World War, France and Britain forged the most intimate and comprehensive political, economic, and military alliance in history. The contributions of Britain and its Empire had been vital to France’s survival as a Great Power. A continuation of the wartime Entente was therefore pivotal to a wider strategy of embedding French security in a trans-Atlantic community of democratic Powers including the United States. But neither Britain nor the United States were ready to commit to using force to uphold the European order established at Paris. British political and policy elites reverted to prewar cultural reflexes that prioritised Imperial considerations and assumed that France posed the chief threat to British interests.\n\nThis article summarises the main developments in Anglo-French relations in the context of Tudor foreign policy. It reviews the historiography of the subject, highlighting the main developments in twentieth century research. It argues that this research demonstrates that it was in the sixteenth century, under the later Valois monarchs and the first Bourbon king of France that Franco-English relations changed significantly. From being openly hostile they became more ambivalent in the true meaning of the word. Under Henry VIII and Elizabeth I the two nations began to create a still-difficult but sometimes more productive relationship with each other. This set the broad pattern for relations up to and beyond the Entente-Cordiale of 1904.\n\nThis article argues against the importance of colonial tensions for the worsening of Franco-German relations before World War I. Traditionally, historians have interpreted the clashes of French and German imperialist interests as putting France and Germany on the path to armed conflict in 1914. This article shows, however, that there existed intense efforts by both German and French pro-colonialists to come to a peaceful understanding with each other. The article thus demonstrates that in the late years of the nineteenth century, French and German colonialists indeed thought in transnational terms; that is, their understanding of their own and their counterpart’s interests was based on the recognition of mutually shared values and racial features that transcended both countries’ European borders.\n\nABSTRACT This article will focus on the nine-year relationship between British Foreign Secretary Sir Edward Grey and the French Ambassador at London Paul Cambon, principally during the years 1912 to 1914. It will show how the French perceived Sir Edward Grey himself, his foreign policy, and his understanding of the Entente. It will analyse the means by which Cambon in particular, and through him the French in general, sought to coax from the Foreign Secretary some form of Franco-British alliance. It will do so by analysing three things: first, what Paul Cambon hoped to obtain from Sir Edward Grey and how; second, the Anglo-German Haldane Mission in which Grey&#39;s manoeuvring got the better of Cambon; and third, the Grey-Cambon letters of November 1912, when Cambon got the better of Grey. More broadly the article might be seen as an example of how ambassadors seek to secure policies from the country to which they are accredited and how foreign ministers attempt to parry them.\n\nThe Secret du Roi was Louis XV's secret foreign policy from approximately 1745 until his death in 1774. This article analyzes Franco-Ottoman diplomatic relations from 1756 to 1774 by using the Secret du Roi as a source. By examining the Secret du Roi, this article shows France's hostility towards Russia and elaborates on France's preference for having close diplomatic relations with the Ottoman Empire instead of Russia. The second half of this article elaborates on France's confidence in the Ottoman Empire's political and military capabilities, and why they thought the Ottomans would do well against Russia in 1768."
