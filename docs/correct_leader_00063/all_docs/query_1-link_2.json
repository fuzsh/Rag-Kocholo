The sentiments of traditional friendship which unite the two Republics can leave no doubt in your mind concerning the very sincere share that the President, the Government of the Republic, and the whole nation take in the calamity that has proved such a cruel ordeal for so many families in the United States. It is natural that France should participate in the sadness as well as in the joy of the American people. I take it to heart to tender to Your Excellency our most heartfelt condolences, and to send to the families of the victims the expression of our afflicted sympathy."
