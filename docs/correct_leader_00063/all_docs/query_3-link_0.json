        "text": "31 December 1838\n\nÉmile, François Loubet was born in Marsanne (Drôme Department) to a family of farmers.

His seven-year term was filled with intense international activity.\n\n23 February 1899\n\nAt the funeral of Félix Faure, Paul Déroulède and his League of Patriots made an unsuccessful attempt to have the military funeral escort march on the Élysée. The attempted coup failed. Amid violent nationalist unrest, Émile Loubet was attacked at the Auteuil racetrack. The turbulent political atmosphere led the President to appoint Pierre Waldeck-Rousseau as Prime Minister so that he would form on 22 June 1899 a “Republican Defence” Government.\n\n19 September 1899\n\nÉmile Loubet granted a pardon to Captain Dreyfus, who had been sentenced again by the military court at his trial in Rennes.\n\nOctober 1899\n\nThe King of Greece visited France.\n\n14 April 1900\n\nThe Exposition Universelle was held in Paris.\n\nAugust 1900\n\nThe Shah of Persia visited France.\n\n22 September 1900\n\nIn the Élysée Palace gardens, Émile Loubet held a banquet for Mayors of France to celebrate the century of the First Republic.\n\nOctober 1900\n\nBelgium’s King Léopold II visited France.\n\n18 September 1901\n\nCzar Nicolas II visited Compiègne with the Czarina.\n\n14-27 May 1902\n\nThe President visited Russia.\n\n7 June 1902\n\nÉmile Combes became Prime Minister. Although President Loubet disapproved of the militant anti-anticlericalism of the Government, he did not intervene in domestic policy.\n\nAugust, 1902\n\nThe Shah of Persia visited France.\n\n15-30 April 1903\n\nThe President visited Algeria and Tunisia.\n\n1-4 May 1903\n\nKing Edward VII of England visited Paris.\n\n6-9 July 1903\n\nPresident Loubet visited London.\n\n14-19 October 1903\n\nVictor-Emmanuel III and the Queen of Italy visited Paris.\n\n23-28 April 1904\n\nPresident Loubet visited Rome.\n\nJuly 1904\n\nThe Bey of Tunisia visited France.\n\nOctober 1904\n\nPresident Loubet visited Madrid and Lisbon.\n\nDecember 1904\n\nThe King and Queen of Portugal visited France.\n\n31 May-4 June 1905\n\nKing Alphonse XIII of Spain was the victim of an assassination attempt during his visit to Paris.\n\nReigning Prince Ferdinand de Saxe-Cobourg of Bulgaria visited France.\n\n18 February 1906\n\nÉmile Loubet became the first President of the Third Republic to end a full term-of-office. He did not wish to run for another term and retired from political life."
