        "text": "France: WORKING WITH LOCAL STONE IN PROVENCE\n\nKamp Kodu\n\nCONCF-6911\n\nBaşlangıç - Bitiş Tarihi\n\n07.08.2024 / 21.08.2024\n\nToplam Kontenjan\n\n12\n\nBoş Kontenjan\n\n0 4 4\n\nYaş\n\n15 - 17\n\nEkstra Ücret\n\n€250.00\n\nKamp Temaları\n\nRENO\n\nOrganizasyon\n\nConcordia France\n\nKuruluş\n\nRéauville has a population of 400 and is very attached to its heritage and history. This is the first year we've been working together, after numerous exchanges. The village already has an international outlook thanks to its twinning with an Italian village, so it's with a desire to promote exchanges between young people and the notion of interculturality that they are going to welcome this project.\n\nİş Tanımı\n\nIf you're in the mood for nature, the charm of a small village and a warm welcome, come to Réauville in Drôme provençale. The village is dominated by its Rocher de la Vierge, which offers an incomparable panorama of its lavender fields and from which you can see Mont Ventoux. Réauville is a \"royal city\" in the heart of the Tricastin region, which has experienced greatness and decline over the course of its long history. The village owes its name to the brother of King Saint Louis. It is an ancient village, with some houses dating back to the 15th century that have retained their remarkable architecture, such as the \"dessus l'Arc\" house. Réauville is the birthplace of the family of President Emile Loubet and Louis Portalier, who was Captain of the Empire (1791). Another historic figure makes the town proud: Albert Séverin Roche. Born in Réauville on 5 March 1895, he was proclaimed \"First Soldier of France\" by Marshal Foch on 27 November 1918 in Strasbourg. You can still see the house where he was born.\n\nIn this historic village, you can help to rebuild a low wall made of local stone. This wall is part of a larger redevelopment project: the new town hall square.\n\nKonaklama ve Yemek\n\nYou will be accommodated in individual tents, a stone's throw from the local shop \"Chez Paulette\". Two areas have been set up to provide single-sex toilet and shower facilities. A room will be equipped for meals and for retreating in case of bad weather (cani-cule, storms). Together, you'll help to organise community life (cleaning, activities, etc.) and take turns preparing meals using locally sourced produce. As far as possible, we will promote vegetarian meals using local, seasonal produce, while ensuring that the diets of all participants are respected, and that local gastronomy is discovered.\n\nKonum ve Serbest Zaman\n\nRéauville is located in the Drôme department, 8 km from Grignan and 20 km south-east of Montélimar. The \"Drôme provençale\" tourist region is renowned for its authentic landscapes, lavender and stone villages. During your stay in Réauville, we recommend that you take the royal walk, starting from Place de la Paix, an easy 3km circuit that allows you to discover all the environmental heritage of the commune. You can also discover the fountains, wash-houses, painted decorations of the church and the Museum of Agricultural Memory. The entertainers will work with the whole group to plan visits to the surrounding villages.\n\nNotlar\n\nFor both leisure and work activities, you need to bring clothes that are suited to the climate (temperatures can be very hot in summer). Don't forget sun protection (a hat or cap is essential, sunglasses with a high protection factor, sun cream with a high protection factor, etc.) and a swimming costume in case of swimming in a pool or white-water activities.\n\nFor sleeping arrangements, remember to take a duvet and a pillowcase (you can put things in it and easily make a pillow). You should also bring a backpack (in addition to your luggage), comfortable trainers and a pair of flip-flops. You'll also need to pack the following essential accessories: a mobile phone charger, a water bottle, a set of bandages and a headlamp or torch.\n\nSocial events will be organised in collaboration with our leaders and according to your wishes. If you'd like to share a little of your culture (recipes, traditional stories, unusual objects, music, etc.), don't hesitate to take a little piece of your country/region in your backpack.\n\nKonuşulan Diller\n\nEnglish\n\nEn Yakın Terminal\n\n-Montélimar SNCF -Paris Gare Montparnasse -Lyon Part Dieu -Marseille Saint Charles\n\nHavaalanı\n\nLYS\n\nKonum\n\nREAUVILLE\n\nHaritada Göster"
