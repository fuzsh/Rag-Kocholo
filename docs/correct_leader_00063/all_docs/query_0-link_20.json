        "text": "Emile Loubet, who was President of the French Republic during the stormy days of the Dreyfus affair from 1899 to 1906, died last night in his country home at Montelimar, in the Drome Department, at the age of 91. He was known as a modest, retiring man, who loved compromise and peace and who was ill-suited to the tumultous period of his regime.\n\nTwo weeks after his election to the presidency in February, 1899, Loubet advised the Senate to pass a bill altering the composition of the Court of Cassation so that the whole tribunal and not a special court would decide on the appeal of Dreyfus. Later he pardoned Dreyfus after the latter had been convicted by the Rennes courtmartial."
