Faure, Félix fōr [key], 1841–99, president of the French republic (1895–99). A leather merchant, he served in the Franco-Prussian War and became an undersecretary for commerce and colonies in the cabinet of Léon Gambetta (1881–82). He later (1882–85, 1888) occupied the post again and was vice president of the chamber of deputies and naval minister before becoming president. The Dreyfus Affair was a notable development in his administration, and Faure marred his reputation by opposing a new trial. The Franco-Russian alliance was concluded, and the Fashoda Incident occurred while he held office. Émile Loubet succeeded him as president.
