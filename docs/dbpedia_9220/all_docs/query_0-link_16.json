        "text": "Music in the black community is more than just playing a piano or guitar; it’s more than celebrating a song at #1 on the US Billboard Hot 100. Black music is the embodiment of culture, my grandmother and self-proclaimed R&B enthusiast explained\n\n“Music was like a world you just couldn’t get to at the time -”\n\nCo-founding a fan club in Philadelphia and owning over 100 R&B/Soul vinyl’s long time music aficionado Evelyn Washington, explained the importance of voices like Marvin Gaye, Aretha Franklin, Mahalia Jackson, and James Brown. With the rise of racial tensions in America during the ’60s and ’70s many black musicians didn’t create music just for the sound; penning powerhouse ballads about issues within the black community, the music shifted into a movement. The voice of black musician’s ricocheted off walls in black households as many used the art of music to express their strife in America.\n\nBlack Record Labels\n\nRacism and discrimination didn’t just affect black Americans from getting employment and housing but it also found a home in popular record labels throughout the music industry. Representation of black faces in music was basically non-existent, with the evolution of jazz and blues many black musicians found complications in recording and distributing their content to the masses. Popular record labels owned by whites weren’t handing out record deals and recording opportunities to black musicians as much as they were for whites. Black music no longer could be silenced, Black Swan and Broome Special Phonograph Records became the first black-owned record labels. Designing spaces for black musicians, Black Swan Records, and Broome Special Phonograph Records help create opportunities and popularize black music. The influence and impact of these two labels created a shift in black music that greatly changed the way we listen and digest music. The aim to create opportunities for black musicians was inspiring and helped influence the startup of future black-owned record labels like Motown, LaFace Records, Vee-Jay, Philadelphia International Records and many more.\n\nLaFace Records and It’s Startup\n\nIn 1989, the world got introduced to one of the most impactful record labels in music. Home to some of the top-selling R&B, Pop and Hip-Hop artists, Laface Records took the music industry by storm. Helping shape the sound of Atlanta music, LaFace Records was on the road to becoming the next Motown. Founded by songwriter and producer Antonio “L.A” Reid and Kenneth “Babyface” Edmonds, the duo was destined for success. After leaving the R&B group The Deele, both L.A and Babyface established themselves as a songwriting and production team; working with The Whispers, Bobby Brown, Whitney Houston, and Boyz II Men.\n\nCo-founding LaFace Records together as a joint venture under Arista, the first artist ever signed to LaFace was R&B duo Damian Dame. Giving LaFace Records their first #1 on the US R&B Charts with “Exclusivity” and releasing their debut album “Damian Dame” the duo success shortly ended. Member Debra “Deah Dame” Hurd sadly was killed in a car accident in 1994 and Bruce Edward “Damian” Broadus died 2 years later from complications of colon cancer.\n\nLaface Records 90’s Roster\n\nThe ’90s was just getting started and LaFace Records wanted everything to do with it. Becoming one of the most successful record labels during the 90’s L.A and Babyface wanted to write history. Birthing some of the most influential music acts ever, Babyface and LA Reid was a duo that couldn't be stopped. With an artist like TLC, Toni Braxton, Usher, OutKast and more, LaFace Records roster was filled with greatness.\n\nToni Braxton\n\nOnce a church girl and later turned R&B’s hottest artist, Toni Braxton has become one of R&B’s most influential artists with a career spanning over 20 years. Stepping on the scene in 1993 with her debut self-titled album “Toni Braxton”, Toni took off and never looked back. The first single “Another Sad Love Song” peaked at #7 and #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 and the R&B Singles charts. The success didn’t stop there, releasing 4 more singles from her debut album Toni shot to stardom, receiving three GRAMMY Awards and a plethora of other awards. Since her debut album, Toni Braxton has sold over 67 million copies, releasing 7 studio albums, earning 4 GRAMMY’s, and influencing an entire generation on R&B acts.\n\n2. TLC\n\nT-Boz, Chili, and Left Eye are one of the greatest and best selling girl groups of all time. Signed with Laface Records in 1991, TLC immediately started working on their debut album with Babyface, L.A Reid, Dallas Austin, Jermaine Dupri, and Marley Mal. “Ooooooohhh… On the TLC Tip” became the group's first album. Heavily influenced by new-jack swing, the mesh of R&B, Hip-Hop and Funk set the group up for a commercially successful album. “Ooooooohhh… On the TLC Tip” garnered three top ten singles. The sound of their music was great, but the lyrical content was greater in which they discussed a wide range of topics; from female empowerment to safe sex. TLC later released CraxySexyCool which sold over 11 million copies in the US and went gold. CrazySexyCool was critically acclaimed, with Rolling Stone ranking it among the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. In 1999, the group dropped their last album together after the tragic death of group member Lisa “Left Eye” Lopes. FanMail debuted at #1 one on the US Billboard 200 and sold 318,000 copies in its first week. The next year the album was certified six-times platinum. TLC has sold over 65 million records worldwide, after the death of Lisa “Left Eye” Lopes the group still remains to make music and tour worldwide.\n\n3. Usher\n\nOne of music’s biggest artists of the late 20th century and early 21st century, Usher gained his first hit-single with “Call Me Mack” in 1993. Usher instantly started impacting LaFace Records. Adopting the new jack swing sound, Usher adapted to the new songwriting and production trends. Receiving platinum success with My Way and spawning hit singles like “You Make Wanna” and “Nice & Slow” this wasn’t even close to the amount of success the Atlanta singer would later receive. Receiving two Grammy’s for “U Remind Me” and “U Don’t Have To Call”, Usher didn’t peak until Confessions. Generating four straight number one hits and winning several Grammy awards, including a Grammy for Best Contemporary R&B Album. One of the biggest albums of the 2000’s decade, Confessions sold over 8 million in copies. The album joined the ranks of Thriller, Whitney Houston and CrazySexyCool by reaching diamond success. After the success of Confessions, Usher has released 5 studio albums selling 75 million records worldwide, earning numerous awards and accolades including 18 Billboard Music Awards and eight Grammy Awards. Usher has inspired artists like Chris Brown, Trey Songz, Ne-Yo, Justin Bieber, Drake and many more.\n\n4. OutKast\n\nIn 1992, the rap game got introduced to two new faces. André “André 3000” Benjamin and Antwan “Big Boi” Patton was a hip-hop duo group named OutKast who gained commercial success throughout the mid-’90s and early 2000s. Experimenting with diverse genres like funk, jazz, and techno, OutKast helped popularize southern rap. OutKast released their debut album Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik, which gained popularity after the single “Player’s Ball” reached number one on the Billboard Hot Rap Tracks charts. The duo developed their sound, experimenting with a variety of styles and achieving commercial success. OutKast is one of the most successful hip-hop groups of all time, receiving 6 Grammy Awards. Releasing six studio albums and a greatest hits release, Outkast has sold over 25 million records. Garnering widespread critical acclaim, publications like Rolling Stone and Pitchfork Media listed Aquemini and Stankonia among the best of their era.\n\nLaFace Records 2000’s Roster and Shift To Arista Records\n\nDuring the end of 1999, LaFace Records begin to produce fewer artists; Babyface started focusing on his own career as a songwriter and musician. The label was completely owned by Arista and BMG in 99'. While L.A continued to produce artists he received a CEO/Chairman position for Arista. Most of the former roster at LaFace Records moved over to Arista to continue to work with L.A.\n\nP!nk\n\nMember of the girl group Choice in 1995, LaFace Records saw potential in Pink and offered her a solo recording contract. Her debut studio album Can’t Take Me Home was certified double-platinum and spawned two Billboard Hot 100 top-ten songs: “There You Go” and “Most Girls”. She gained further recognition with the collaborative single “Lady Marmalade” from the Moulin Rouge! the soundtrack, which topped many charts worldwide. Pink has sold over 90 million records worldwide, making her one of the world’s best-selling music artists. Her career accolades include three Grammy Awards, a Brit Award, a Daytime Emmy Award and seven MTV Video Music Awards, including the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award\n\n2. Ciara\n\nCiara jumped directly on the charts after signing with LaFace/Arista in 2004 . Her debut album Goodies garnered four singles “Goodies”, “1, 2 Step”, “Oh” and “And I”. Goodies were certified double platinum and were nominated for four Grammy’s. Ciara became everyone's special ingredient during the time, collaborating with Missy Elliot, Bow Wow, Field Mob and more in which all songs shot to the top 10 of Billboard Hot 100. Ciara released her sophomore album Ciara: The Evolution which spawned the hit singles “Get Up”, “Promise”, “Like A Boy”, “Can’t Leave ’Em Alone”. The album reached number one and was certified platinum. After Ciara’s sophomore album she sold over 23 million records, obtaining eight top 10 singles and snagging a Grammy.\n\n3. Donell Jones\n\nSigning with LaFace Records in 1996 and writing hits for Usher, Donell released his first album My Heart. Not as successful as his sophomore album would be, it failed to reach the upper half of the US Billboard 200. The first two singles “In My Hood” and cover of Stevie Wonder’s “Knocks Me Off My Feet” became successful on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. It wasn’t until 1999 Donell Jones received major success where he released his second album Where I Wanna Be. The album produced 3 hit singles “Where I Wanna Be”, “U Know What’s Up”, and “Shorty (Got Her Eyes On Me)”. Where I Wanna Be sold roughly over 1 million copies and was certified diamond. After Where I Wanna Be, Donell Jones released 4 studio albums and continued to write and produce, even collaborating with newcomer and self-proclaimed King Of R&B Jacquees.\n\nLaFace Records Impact\n\nLaFace Records will forever reign as one of the most successful record labels of the ’90s, birthing stars that impact today’s music. LaFace Records has always taken pride in distributing the best and most uplifting music. The duty to popularize black music and culture has always been admirable. With the state of black music today we must honor L.A Reid and BabyFace as one of the greatest and most influential duos in music."
