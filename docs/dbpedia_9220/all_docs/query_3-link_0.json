        "text": "Catalogue of published recordings by Gary Numan\n\nStudio albums22Live albums29Compilation albums17EPs13Singles51\n\nThe following is a comprehensive discography of Gary Numan, a British singer and musician. Numan (born Gary Webb, 1958) released his first record in 1978 as part of the outfit Tubeway Army. Initially unsuccessful, the band scored a huge hit in 1979 with the single \"Are Friends Electric\" and their second album Replicas, both of which reached number one in the UK. Numan then decided to release further recordings under his own name, beginning with the single \"Cars\" later in 1979. Both this and the subsequent album The Pleasure Principle also reached number one in the UK, and Numan became a leading force in the British electronic music scene. He scored a third number one album in 1980 with Telekon, and more hit singles and albums until the mid 1980s when his popularity waned. Despite this, he has continued to record and tour on a regular basis up to the present day. His 2017 studio album, Savage (Songs from a Broken World), entered the UK Albums Chart at no. 2, which was Numan's highest chart peak since 1980. His most recent album, 2021's Intruder, also entered the UK charts at no. 2.[1]\n\nAlbums\n\n[edit]\n\nStudio albums\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Album Peak chart positions Certifications UK\n\n[2][3] AUS\n\n[4] US\n\n[5] NZ\n\n[6][7] CAN\n\n[8] JPN\n\n[9][10] SCO\n\n[11][12] SWE\n\n[13] GER\n\n[14] NLD\n\n[15] IRE\n\n[16] BEL\n\n(FL)\n\n[17] BEL\n\n(WA)\n\n[18] SWI\n\n[19] AUT\n\n[20] 1978 Tubeway Army\n\nReleased: 24 November 1978\n\nLabel: Beggars Banquet\n\n— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — 1979 Replicas\n\nReleased: April 1979\n\nLabel: Beggars Banquet\n\n1 11 124 8 — — — 37 45 44 — — — — —\n\nBPI: Gold[21]\n\nARIA: Gold[22]\n\nTubeway Army (Reissued)\n\nReleased: 4 August 1979\n\nLabel: Beggars Banquet\n\n14 — — — — — — — — — — — — — — The Pleasure Principle\n\nReleased: 7 September 1979\n\nLabel: Beggars Banquet\n\n1 24 16 19 16 64 — — — — — — — — —\n\nBPI: Gold[21]\n\nARIA: Gold[23]\n\nMC: Gold[22]\n\n1980 Telekon\n\nReleased: 5 September 1980\n\nLabel: Beggars Banquet\n\n1 24 64 32 53 — 30* — — — — — — — —\n\nBPI: Gold[21]\n\n1981 Dance\n\nReleased: 4 September 1981\n\nLabel: Beggars Banquet\n\n3 85 167 — — — 87* — — — — — — — — 1982 I, Assassin\n\nReleased: 10 September 1982\n\nLabel: Beggars Banquet\n\n8 95 201 — — — 35* — — — — — — — — 1983 Warriors\n\nReleased: 16 September 1983\n\nLabel: Beggars Banquet\n\n12 — — — — — 53* — — — — — — — — 1984 Berserker\n\nReleased: 9 November 1984\n\nLabel: Numa\n\n45 — — — — — — — — — — — — — — 1985 The Fury\n\nReleased: September 1985\n\nLabel: Numa\n\n24 — — — — — — — — — — — — — — 1986 Strange Charm\n\nReleased: October 1986\n\nLabel: Numa\n\n59 — — — — — — — — — — — — — — 1988 Metal Rhythm\n\nReleased: September 1988\n\nLabel: IRS, Illegal\n\n48 — — — — — — — — — — — — — — 1989 Automatic (as Sharpe & Numan)\n\nReleased: June 1989\n\nLabel: Polydor (UK)\n\n59 — — — — — — — — — — — — — — 1991 Outland\n\nReleased: March 1991\n\nLabel: IRS, EMI\n\n39 — — — — — — — — — — — — — — 1992 Machine + Soul\n\nReleased: September 1992\n\nLabel: Numa\n\n42 — — — — — — — — — — — — — — 1994 Sacrifice\n\nReleased: October 1994\n\nLabel: Numa\n\n94 — — — — — — — — — — — — — — 1997 Exile\n\nReleased: 20 October 1997\n\nLabel: Eagle\n\n48 — — — — — 91 — — — — — — — — 2000 Pure\n\nReleased: 7 November 2000\n\nLabel: Eagle\n\n58 — — — — — 23* — — — — — — — — 2006 Jagged\n\nReleased: 13 March 2006\n\nLabel: Cooking Vinyl\n\n59 — — — — — 84 — — — — — — — — 2008 Replicas Redux\n\nReleased: 2008\n\nLabel: Beggars Banquet\n\n96 — — — — — — — — — — — — — — 2009 The Pleasure Principle 30th Anniversary Edition\n\nReleased: 21 September 2009\n\nLabel: Beggars Banquet\n\n98 — — — — — — — — — — — — — — 2011 Dead Son Rising\n\nReleased: 15 September 2011\n\nLabel: Mortal Records\n\n87 — — — — — — — — — — — — — — 2013 Splinter (Songs from a Broken Mind)\n\nReleased: 14 October 2013\n\nLabel: Mortal Records\n\n20 — 175 — — 197 24 — — — — — — — — 2017 Savage (Songs from a Broken World)\n\nReleased: 15 September 2017\n\nLabel: BMG\n\n2 76 154 — — — 3 — 87 171 12 59 89 94 — 2021 Intruder\n\nReleased: 21 May 2021\n\nLabel: BMG\n\n2 78 — — — — 2 — 15 56 15 100 60 33 63 2021 Exile (Reissued)\n\nReleased: 24 July 2021\n\nLabel: Ear Music\n\n— — — — — — 36 — — — — — — — — 2023 Tubeway Army (reissued)\n\nReleased: 10 February 2023\n\nLabel: Beggars Banquet\n\n72 — — — — — 14 — — — — — — — — \"—\" denotes releases that failed to chart or were not released\n\n*Indicates chart entry occurred after release year.
