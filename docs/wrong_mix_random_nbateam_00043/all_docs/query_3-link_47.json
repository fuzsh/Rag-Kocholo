        "text": "Refugees are people fleeing violence and persecution—in Syria, Iraq, Eritrea, and other countries in crisis. They are seeking safety and the chance to move their lives forward.\n\nThe United States has a long tradition of sheltering those fleeing conflict and persecution. Once refugees have been identified by the United Nations refugee agency and cleared for resettlement, the U.S. government works with the IRC and eight other national resettlement agencies to help them restart their lives in America. Out of the nearly 20 million refugees in the world, fewer than one percent are considered for resettlement worldwide.\n\nRefugees may be placed in a city where they have relatives or friends, or where there’s an established community that shares their language or culture. Other considerations include the cost of living and a community’s ability to provide medical services. However, as legal U.S. residents, refugees may live in any city and state they choose.\n\nAlthough even many locals may not know it, Baltimore has a long history of being a destination for refugees – from people fleeing pogroms in the early 20th century to Soviet refugees in the 1980s and 90s. In fact, Old Bay Seasoning, Baltimore’s iconic spice, was invented by a refugee who had fled Nazi-occupied Germany. The IRC in Baltimore opened in 1999.\n\nRefugees contribute to Baltimore city and surrounding counties as new residents, taxpayers, employees, students, home and business owners, and neighbors.\n\nLearn more about how refugee resettlement works.\n\nIRC staff work closely with community groups, volunteers, schools, neighbors and many others to support refugees in Baltimore and the surrounding communities.\n\nNew refugee arrivals are greeted and welcomed at the airport upon arrival. Other individuals are assessed soon after services are requested to determine eligibility.\n\nCase management serves as the central point of contact, providing care and services to eligible refugees, asylees, parolees, special immigrant visa holders, and victims of trafficking. Caseworkers ensure that all clients receive high quality resettlement services and access to transitional adjustment services in accordance with government contracts and IRC policies.\n\nCultural orientation provides intensive, language-specific classes to assist newly arrived refugees in learning about life in the Baltimore community.\n\nYouth case management supports students and local schools through home visits, ongoing orientation and mediation.\n\nIntensive case management provides additional support to participants with special needs beyond standard resettlement services.\n\nHealth services connect participants to needed services and facilitates language-specific, culturally-appropriate adjustment groups.\n\nTo request services: please complete this appointment request form or call 410-327-1885, extension 111.\n\nThe economic empowerment program at the IRC assists participants in securing employment, building personal financial success and becoming contributing members to the Baltimore economy. Programs include:\n\nEntry level employment services connect eligible participants with a first job or entry level position with a local employer. Services include pre-employment preparation, resume writing, application support and direct connections to our vast network of local employer partners.\n\nCareer development connects eligible participants to living wage positions along a career path. Services include vocational skills training, vocational English language training and advanced job readiness training coupled with targeted employer outreach and job placement support.\n\nFinancial capability offers classes and coaching on topics such as budgeting, banking and credit, and links clients to loans through IRC's Center for Economic Opportunity (CEO).\n\nTo request services: please complete this appointment request form or call 410-327-1885, extension 111.\n\nIf you are an employer interested in hiring refugees, please contact us. The IRC’s free employment services are available to help refugees and employers at every step of the way."
