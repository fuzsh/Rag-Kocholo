        "text": "David R. Yarkony was born in New York City. He graduated from State University of New York at Stony Brook, with a Bachelor of Arts in chemistry, summa cum laude, in 1971. He received his Ph. D. in chemistry from the University of California at Berkeley in 1975, with H. F. Schaefer III and after two years at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology working with Robert J. Silbey on temperature effects on excitons and exciton transport, he joined the faculty at Johns Hopkins University in 1977. He was promoted to full professor in 1984 and is currently the D. Mead Johnson Professor of Chemistry.\n\nProfessor Yarkony has been interested in nonadiabatic chemistry since 1985 when he, in collaboration with Byron Lengsfield and Paul Saxe, reported to a unique algorithm for determining the first derivative or momentum coupling for multireference configuration interactions wave function using analytic gradient techniques. This lead Yarkony, in the 1990's to develop algorithms to locate and characterize conical intersections of states of the same symmetry. These algorithms have shaped his career as he and several other groups have demonstrated that such conical intersections are ubiquitous and must be considered in any ultrafast nonadiabatic process.\n\nMore recently Yarkony has turned his attention to the effects of conical intersections on photoelectron spectra and photodissociation. Here a key issue is the accuracy of the adiabatic electronic structure data, energies, energy gradients and derivative couplings, used in the simulations. Yarkony, with Michael Schuurman (bound molecules) and Xiaolei Zhu (dissociative species) have developed algorithms to construct accurate quasi-diabatic representation of high level electronic structure data. These algorithms are having a major impact on the accuracy with which nonadiabatic processes can be simulated.\n\nWe are interested in electronically nonadiabatic processes, processes in which the Born-Oppenheimer approximation fails and a molecular wave function can transition radiationlessly between potential energy surfaces. Although the Born-Oppenheimer approximation is fundamental to the way we think about and quantify virtually all of chemistry, its breakdown, rather than being a rare event is quite common, when an electronically excited state is involved. Since electronically excited states are routinely formed when visible and higher energy photons are absorbed nonadiabatic processes are of fundamental importance in such diverse areas as vision, photosynthesis, solar energy conversion, photochemistry and the photo stability of biomolecules.\n\nThe Born-Oppenheimer approximation fails in dramatic fashion in the vicinity of conical intersections, which represent the intersection of two (or more) Born-Oppenheimer potential energy surfaces with the topography of a double cone. Once thought of as an archane theoretical notion largely restricted to molecules with point group symmetry, as for example in the Jahn-Teller effect, due to work reported in the past two decades conical intersections that do not involve point group symmetry are now understood to be ubiquitous. Over that period we have developed a computationally oriented, formal description of conical intersections, including extensions to intersections of 3-states and intersections where the spin-orbit interaction cannot be neglected.\n\nSelected publications\n\nMatsunaga, Nikita and Yarkony, David R.

Accounts of Chemical Research. 1998, 31(8), 511-8.\n\nOur current research objectives focus on how nonadiabatic interactions induced by conical intersections are reflected in dynamical process and measured spectra. Another major area of interest is the electronic structure and dynamical aspects of nonadiabatic photodissociation mediated by conical intersections. We have considerable expertise in the electronic structure aspects of this problem. We have extended our method for determining quasi-diabatic coupled electronic state Hamiltonians for bound molecules to handle dissociating systems.\n\nZhu, Xiaolei and Yarkony, David R.

One of the major goals for our research is to extend the range of molecules accessible to this approach and use it to construct highly efficient dynamics on the fly methodologies.\n\nOne of the uses of the methodological tools being developed in our group is the calculation of photodetachment spectra. In these calculations ab initio determination of the electron photodetachment cross sections, basically the transition moments to the individual diabatic electronic states for the continuum electron, is important. Despite its importance, this aspect of the problem, a challenging exercise in nonadiabatic electron scattering theory, has received little attention. We have developed a unique, fully nonadiabatic formalism to treat this electron scattering problem, which builds on our above described spectral simulation tools, takes full account of the nuclear kinetic energy, and exact account of electron exchange."
