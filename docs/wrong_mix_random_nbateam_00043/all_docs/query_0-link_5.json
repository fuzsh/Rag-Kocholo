One is basic investigation of the development and functioning of the mammalian immune system. The other is Engineering Immunity: translational studies using viral vectors to carry new genes into immune cells to increase the range of pathogens effectively fought by the immune system and to make the immune system resist cancer growth more effectively.\n\nOur basic studies have two directions: to understand the remarkable range of activity of the NF-kB transcription factor and to understand the normal and pathologic functions of microRNAS. NF-kB activates perhaps 1000 genes in response to a wide range of stimuli. It has different physiologic roles in different cells. How one factor can be so varied in its activity is the puzzle that has interested us for many years and that we have studied at many different levels.\n\nMicroRNAs are small (~22 nucleotide) RNAs that regulate the amount of protein made by a particular messenger RNA and that therefore provide a level of fine control over gene expression. We have been interested in their role in hematopoietic cell development and function. We have recently concentrated on microRNAs that modulate myeloid cell development. Most interesting is miR-146a, which is a feedback regulator of NF-kB activation. A mouse knockout of the gene encoding miR-146a is normal at birth but slowly develops myeloid hyperproliferation and, ultimately, cancer. We have traced the earliest events to dysregulation of hematopoietic stem cells suggesting that a normal function of miR-146a is to be a guardian of hematopoietic stem cell health and longevity."
