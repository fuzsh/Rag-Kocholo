MANKATO, Minn. â€” The Minnesota Timberwolves have signed free agent Andrei Kirilenko, bringing the versatile forward back to the NBA after a one-season absence.

The contract was completed Friday as soon as the Wolves consummated their three-team trade with New Orleans and Phoenix to clear space under the salary cap for Kirilenko.

The 31-year-old Kirilenko is currently playing with the Russian national team at the Summer Olympics in London. He played 10 years for the Utah Jazz, averaging 12.4 points and 5.6 rebounds per game, but spent the 2011-12 season with the CKSA Moscow club. He won the Most Valuable Player and Best Defender awards in the Euroleague.

Kirilenko says he's eager to play for head coach Rick Adelman and that feels his game "fits in well with his style of play."
