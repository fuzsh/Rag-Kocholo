ORLANDO, Fla. -- Andrei Kirilenko is now a Net.

The Nets officially announced Friday they've signed the free agent forward, completing the latest move in an impressive haul this offseason. Kirilenko, who opted out of his deal with the Timberwolves that was scheduled to pocket him $10 million next season, accepted the Nets' mini midlevel exception of $3.18 million.

He inked a two-year deal with the second being a player option.

“It gives me great pleasure to welcome Andrei to the Nets,” Nets owner Mikhail Prokhorov said in a statement. “He is a true talent with tremendous versatility. As a fellow countryman, I am especially proud that the best Russian player in the history of the NBA will be wearing a Nets jersey.”

Kirilenko averaged 12.4 points, 5.7 rebounds, 2.8 assists, 1.5 steals and a block per game in Minnesota last season.

“We are very pleased to add Andrei to our roster,” GM Billy King. “He is a proven NBA veteran with a unique skill set, and his addition provides our team with increased frontcourt flexibility.”

Kirilenko will be introduced along with Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce and Jason Terry at noon Thursday at the Barclays Center.
