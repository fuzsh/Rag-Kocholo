        "text": "Former NBA All-Star Andrei Kirilenko announced his retirement from basketball on Monday, telling Sportexpress he has made his final decision, as translated by Sportando.\n\nEarlier in June, Kirilenko responded to reports of his retirement by saying he was not yet certain about it.\n\nKirilenko was waived by the Philadelphia 76ers in February after never suiting up for the team following his December trade from Brooklyn. He also spent a season (2012-13) with the Minnesota Timberwolves, but will be best remembered for his 10-year run in Utah.\n\nThe 34-year-old - a three-time All-Defensive Team member - averaged 11.8 points, 5.5 rebounds, 2.7 assists, 1.8 blocks, and 1.4 steals in 13 seasons with the Jazz, T-Wolves, and Nets.\n\nKirilenko, a phenomenally versatile forward who could lock down the opposing team's best player, grab a rebound, run the fast break, and make a play off the dribble, is the only player other than Hakeem Olajuwon to record multiple 5-by-5 statlines over the course of his career.\n\nOver a four-year period from 2002 through 2006, the Russian star dubbed AK-47 averaged roughly 15 points, seven rebounds, three assists, and three blocks while posting a cumulative Player Efficiency Rating of 21.9.\n\nHis international resume is perhaps even more impressive than his NBA stat-stuffing, as Kirilenko led Russia to bronze at the 2012 Olympic Games and a gold medal at the 2007 FIBA Eurobasket, where he was named tournament MVP. He was also twice (2007, 2012) named FIBA Europe Player of the Year."
