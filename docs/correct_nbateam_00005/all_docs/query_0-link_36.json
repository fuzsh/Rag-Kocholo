        "text": "Kirilenko, the former Utah Jazz standout, kept gushing, about his health, Shved and the offense run by Wolves coach Rick Adelman. “I think Minnesota is ready to take a step and make the playoffs,” he said. Of Adelman, he said: “I know Rick from back in Sacramento. They had a great, great team at the time. For me, it looks like European flavoring … a lot of European guys, a lot of guys who can run the floor, and Alexey is another big plus.”\n\nWhat may have been left unsaid is the Nets continued interest in at AK-47. Kirilenko has a player option next July and if he opts out, expect the Nets to be interested once again. The front office, aided by ownership, has already made three attempts at Kirilenko. And next off-season, they could offer the then 32-year-old a three-year, $10 million contract. Is that enough? No doubt, we’ll see."
