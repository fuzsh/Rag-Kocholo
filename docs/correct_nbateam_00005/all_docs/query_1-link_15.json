The Yahoo report claimed that Kirilenko, an unrestricted free agent, is no longer considering the Brooklyn Nets for his comeback to the NBA.\n\nAs for Johnson, the Wolves apparently have grown weary of his inconsistency, although he had an impressive five-game stretch in the NBA Summer League in Las Vegas. Johnson, the No. 4 overall pick in the 2010 draft, averaged 20.5 points in the Summer League, shot nearly 50 percent on three-pointers (9 of 20), and showed the aggressiveness he has lacked during most of his two seasons with the Wolves.\n\nThere is speculation that the Wolves were showcasing Johnson in the Summer League, and it might have paid off.\n\nAn additional report by Yahoo Sports said the Wolves are part of a proposed three-team deal that includes the New Orleans Hornets. The report said the Wolves are sending Johnson and his $4.285 million salary, and a possible first-round draft pick, to Phoenix, which is trading center Robin Lopez and forward Hakim Warrick to New Orleans.\n\nWolves president of basketball operations David Kahn was unavailable for comment Tuesday.\n\nInitial returns for the Wolves, according to Yahoo Sports, would be New Orleans point guard Jerome Dyson and the contract of center Brad Miller, who announced his retirement before the end of the 2011-12 regular season. The Wolves traded Miller to New Orleans on July 13 after reaching a buyout agreement with him for $800,000. Miller’s agent, Mark Bartelstein, said Miller is not changing his mind about retiring.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, the Wolves traded shooting guard Wayne Ellington to Memphis in exchange for forward Dante Cunningham. A person with knowledge of the trade said the Wolves are not expected to keep Cunningham. The person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the Wolves had contacted at least two teams regarding Cunningham before the trade was announced Tuesday.\n\nRemoving Johnson’s salary appears to be the primary objective for the Wolves’ involvement with Phoenix and New Orleans. The Wolves will likely need additional cap space in order to make a push for Kirilenko, who earned $17.823 million in his final season with Utah in 2010-11. Kirilenko will have to take a significant pay cut, but he still could cost the Wolves at least $5 million in 2012-13.\n\nThe Wolves also have reached agreements with free-agent shooting guards Brandon Roy and Alexey Shved of Russia, deals that could take up approximately $8 million of cap space in 2012-13. Add at least another $2 million for the first-year salary of backup center Greg Stiemsma, whom the Wolves will sign after Boston withdrew its qualifying offer to Stiemsma on Monday.\n\nKirilenko, who led Utah to six playoff appearances, reportedly has told Russian media that he wants to return to the NBA this season. His interest in joining the Timberwolves is motivated by the opportunity to continue playing with Shved. Kirilenko and Shved were teammates last season in the Russian League on CSKA Moscow.\n\nKirilenko returned home to Russia after his contract expired with Utah. When the lockout delayed the start of the 2011-12 season, he decided to stay in Russia for the entire season.\n\nFollow Ray Richardson at twitter.com/twolvesnow\n\nOriginally Published: July 24, 2012 at 11:01 p.m."
