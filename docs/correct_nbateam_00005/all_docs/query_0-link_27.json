        "text": "Andrei Kirilenko states that Rick Adelman’s game is very similiar to European basketball, he admired the play of Sacramento Kings back in the days under Adelman with Vlade Divac, Peja Stojakovic and he believes that kind of playing style is ideal for him. 31 years old forward is also excited about his former team mates in Minnesota, he says Kevin Love has become a superstar and Ricky Rubio showed a lot of promise before getting injured last season. When asked about if he feels responsible about Alexey Shved as the Russian player will be a rookie this season with Timberwolves, Andrei Kirilenko said: “I think he has a good chance and potential to be an essential part of this team but I can not go out there and play for him even if I wanted to. In my opinion you need three things to be succesful in the NBA: 1.Confidence of your coach, 2.Performance and 3. Good Luck. You need to join the right team, with the right role, with the right coach and at the right time. For my part I will do my best to help him adapt as quickly as possible and focus on basketball.”\n\nRussia’s top basketball player, Andrey Kirilenko, sees supporting Kevin Love and inspiring younger players as his main tasks at the Minnesota Timberwolves. Kirilenko is returning to the NBA this summer after a very successful year with CSKA Moscow and a bronze medal performance with Russia at the London Olympics. “[Minnesota coach, Rick Adelman] said that he was glad that I’m coming,” he told Sport-Express newspaper. “He said he didn’t expect that they’ll be able to drag me out from Russia as I was doing so well with CSKA. We’ve known each other for a long time, since Utah and his Sacramento were fighting in the playoffs.” “According to Adelman, he sees me as a sort of a bear leader – an experienced player, who’ll be an example for the young talent Minnesota has in the squad,” the 31-year-old added.\n\nKirilenko tried to make the same claim when he was asked about the prospect of playing his NBA colleagues for a gold medal and the flood of 40-year-old memories such a showdown would trigger. “Right now it’s a different time,” Kirilenko said. “Then it was a communist time. Right now everybody is playing together. Some Americans play in Russia. Some Russians play in America. It doesn’t really go into politics.” Yet when pressed about 1972, Kirilenko couldn’t stifle a huge grin as he kept talking. “What do you want me to say?” he asked. “I like the win. I like the win in ’72.”"
