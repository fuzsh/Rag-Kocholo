        "text": "The Brooklyn Nets agreed to terms with free agent forward Andrei Kirilenko for the mini-midlevel exception, according to NBA reporter Peter Vecsey. The New York Daily News' Stefan Bondy confirmed the original report.\n\nThe Nets seemingly get a steal of a free agent deal, bringing on the defensive-talented Russian for a three-year deal worth $3.18 million annually, Ken Berger of CBS Sports reports. The third year of the contract is a player option.\n\nThat comes after the former Minnesota Timberwolves player spurned an offer to make upwards of $10 million by opting out of a player option with his current team.\n\nKirilenko was reportedly asking for more than twice the Brooklyn offer with the San Antonio Spurs. They had aggressive negotiations with the Timberwolves in acquiring the small forward who averaged 12.4 points, 5.7 rebounds and 2.8 assists for the T-Wolves last season. Minnesota reportedly did not want to take back $7 or $8 million in contracts from the Spurs to match Kirilenko's proposed salary if he were to play for San Antonio, according to Yahoo! Sports.\n\nBrooklyn owner Mikhail Prokhorov is quite familiar with the fellow Russian. Kirilenko played for the CSKA Moscow, a team supported by Prokhorov.\n\nGoing over the luxury tax line will cost Prokhorov and the Nets $15 million on Kirilenko alone, Berger reports.\n\nMore from SB Nation:\n\n• Ziller: Cavs can't lose with Andrew Bynum deal\n\n• Report: Howard wanted Lakers to end Kobe era\n\n• A night at the \"Penis Monologues\"\n\n• The difference between Jeff Teague and Brandon Jennings"
