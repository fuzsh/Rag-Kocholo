        "text": "The Brooklyn Nets have signed NBA forward Andrei Kirilenko, whose wife, Russian pop star Masha Lopatova, once confessed publicly that she allows her husband to cheat once per year.\n\nYou can breathe easy though, because Kirilenko says he never took her up on the offer.\n\nLopatova once told ESPN that because women are forever throwing themselves at the new Nets forward and forbidden things only become more desirable, she told her husband he could sleep with a woman besides her once a year.\n\nGet Our Latest News for FREE\n\nSubscribe to get daily/weekly email with the top stories (plus special offers!) from The Christian Post. Be the first to know.\n\n\"If I know about it, it's not cheating,\" she told ESPN. When he was asked about it, however, Kirilenko said he was surprised but wouldn't be taking up the offer.\n\n\"Of course it was a surprise,\" he said, \"but I'm not planning on doing anything.\"\n\nAccording to a USA Today report, Kirilenko agreed to a two-year deal for the taxpayer's mid-level exception to play for the Nets.\n\nHe gave up $10 million remaining on the final year of his contract with the Minnesota Timberwolves for $3.18 million in earnings for the 2013-14 year playing for the Nets. He also has a player option for 2014-15 for about the same figure.\n\nThat, however, could simply be due to the power moves made by Nets owner Mikhail Prokhorov, who has added a slew of talent to the Nets' roster since the beginning of the offseason. So far the nets have acquired Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett and Jason Terry from the Boston Celtics.\n\nBrooklyn's expected starting five now covers Deron Williams, Joe Johnson, Pierce, Garnett and Brook Lopez. Kirilenko, Andray Blatche, Reggie Evans and Shaun Livingston are expected to play off the bench, according to USA Today.\n\nKirilenko is a 12.4 point-per-game scorer and is a well-rounded player who can score, pass, rebound and run the court. In his one season with the Minnesota Timberwolves in 2012-2013, he averaged 12.4 points and 5.7 rebounds.\n\nKirilenko became an option for the Nets after a deal with 6'7\" Croatian Bojan Bogdanovic fell through because they could not agree to a deal with his Turkish team.\n\nThe Nets are now estimated to be $29.432 million over the NBA's luxury tax. The Kirilenko deal increases it by $13.515 million."
