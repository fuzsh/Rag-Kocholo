        "text": "The Minnesota Timberwolves will not have forward Andrei Kirilenko available for Wednesday's game against San Antonio due to a strained right quadriceps he sustained in the team's most recent outing.\n\nKirilenko exited Monday's 100-98 home loss to Portland during the second quarter and did not return. The 11-year NBA veteran is considered day-to-day with the injury.\n\nThe native Russian ranks third among Minnesota players in both scoring (13.3 ppg) and rebounding (6.3 rpg) this season. He becomes the latest ailing member of a Timberwolves squad that is also presently without All-Star forward Kevin Love (broken hand), guard Brandon Roy (knee) and swingman Chase Budinger (knee)."
