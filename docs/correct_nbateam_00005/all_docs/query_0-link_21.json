That is, a player who defended opponents all over the court, found the open man and filled his stat line with rebounds, steals and blocked shots.\n\nKirilenko agrees with that plan. At 31, he is not interested in a makeover to help him replace two-time all-star forward Kevin Love for the next six to eight weeks.\n\nA natural small forward, Kirilenko will shift to Love’s power forward spot while Love recovers from a broken right hand, but the Russian standout will not try to match the 26.0 points and 13.3 rebounds Love averaged last season.\n\n“I’m not chasing stats,” Kirilenko said after practice Tuesday, Oct. 23. “I’m chasing good plays, things that can get us something. I’m not a guy who looks at stats. Whatever helps us win the games, I will do that.”\n\nUntil Love returns to the lineup in mid-December, the Wolves will have a very different look at power forward.\n\nOn defense, the 6-foot-9 Kirilenko could find himself defending a shooting guard or a power forward — unlike Love, who rarely was used in situations in which he had to defend someone other than a center or power forward.\n\nOn offense, where Love was known for putting up double-doubles in points and rebounds, Kirilenko is expected to help the Wolves develop a more balanced attack.\n\n“He’s a better passer than the other big guys we have, and that’s going to help us,” coach Rick Adelman said. “He’s going to have the ball in his hands with some of the things we’re trying to do, but we’re still going to run the same plays.”\n\nKirilenko played small forward for most of his time with Utah, but Adelman preferred moving him to power forward rather than Derrick Williams. Williams will start at small forward in Wednesday night’s exhibition game against the Detroit Pistons in Winnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nThe Wolves are counting on the versatility in Kirilenko’s game to help them get through a difficult transition without Love and point guard Ricky Rubio (knee), who is not projected to play until mid-December at the earliest.\n\nFew players can match Love’s production. In a survey released Tuesday on NBA.com, the league’s 30 general managers voted him the NBA’s best power forward.\n\nKirilenko understands the magnitude of his responsibility, but he shares Adelman’s belief that the entire team has a role in compensating for Love’s absence.\n\n“It’s a tough time for us, and we’re learning, but there’s a lot of room for creativity,” Kirilenko said. “I see every guy on our team being able to make baskets. We just need to stay sharp as a team.”\n\nA team effort might be required on the boards. The Wolves never had to worry about rebounding with Love on the floor. Kirilenko said he hopes to raise his rebounding average to at least eight per game.\n\nThe Wolves are hoping Williams, backup forwards Dante Cunningham and Lou Amundson, and centers Nikola Pekovic and Greg Stiemsma can ease the burden on Kirilenko under the basket and allow him to make plays.\n\n“If Andrei pulls down a rebound, I’m taking off because he passes so well,” point guard J.J. Barea said. “It makes our job a little easier with him being able to get the ball up the floor.”\n\nKirilenko speaks fluent English but said he will pick his spots when it comes to assuming Love’s leadership role. Since Love’s injury, Kirilenko said he has been working on becoming more vocal in practice.\n\n“Maybe I need to make everybody learn a little Russian,” he said, smiling. “I get confused sometimes on the court trying to talk to guys. I don’t really like telling guys what to do. We have grown men on the team. They already know what to do, but some things on the floor you definitely have to talk about.”\n\nFollow Ray Richardson at twitter.com/twolvesnow.\n\nOriginally Published: October 22, 2012 at 11:01 p.m."
