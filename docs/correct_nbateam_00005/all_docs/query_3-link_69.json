        "text": "I’ve covered some difficult stories involving the Timberwolves over the years, but this assignment, on its face, might be one of the most daunting yet.\n\nThe mission, should I choose to accept it: Select a team of the decade for the Minnesota Timberwolves, starting in 2010.\n\nA team of the decade for a team that, from 2010-11 through last season, went 273-449 with just one playoff appearance. A team of the decade for a franchise that, following said playoff appearance, imploded amid infighting and stubbornness. A team of the decade that had just 21 players even manage to crack the lowest of thresholds: 1,000 points for the past 10 years.\n\nBut we do not run from challenges here at The Athletic. We embrace them. Also, we didn’t want to be the only ones not to participate in this week’s site-wide celebration of the decade.\n\nAnd so we embark on this quest to pick a starting five from one of the least successful franchises in the league. The parameters are … flexible. Find the most talented five-man group — point guard, two wings, power forward and center — for when they were in Timberwolves uniforms. That eliminates Kevin Garnett, Andrei Kirilenko, Andre Miller and Tayshaun Prince, all who had terrific careers but were on their ways out when they suited up in Minnesota this decade.\n\nAnd it doesn’t have to be cumulative success. It could be one season. Though as you will soon see, those guidelines are applied differently depending upon the position being selected.\n\nHey, with a job like this, sometimes you gotta make up the rules as you go along. And to make this more fun, or depressing, we didn’t just select an all-decade team. We also wanted to explore a little bit about why the Wolves have been stuck in a rut for so long. So we also looked at the many who came in and were supposed to be the answer but didn’t work out.\n\nSo, here we go.\n\nPoint guard: Ricky Rubio (2011-2017)\n\nStats: 353 games, 3,653 points, 2,991 assists, 1,498 rebounds, 747 steals, .375 FG%, .315 3P%\n\nAnalysis: He was a sensation when he first arrived from Spain, energizing a staid franchise with his electric passing and boyish charisma. A knee injury probably prevented the Wolves from snapping their playoff skid much sooner than they did and stands as one of the great what-ifs in franchise history. What if Rubio had stayed healthy? Maybe the Rubio-Kevin Love-Rick Adelman core would have endured. Later in his career, there was some frustration from the fans on his inability to hit open shots, but Rubio’s legacy has only been cemented in his absence. A no-brainer pick.\n\nHonorable mention: Jeff Teague. The shoes he filled, and who chose him to fill them, certainly tarnish his approval rating. But he was the starter on the lone playoff team of the decade and had a winning record in games played during the disaster that was last season. He has been productive, if not popular.\n\nWhat might have been: Kris Dunn. Tom Thibodeau’s choice to succeed Rubio, a player he never believed could handle a deep run into the playoffs. Thibs hoped Dunn would be the defensive-minded, experienced lead guard who could also score more than Rubio ever would. He clashed with Thibodeau in his lone season here and was shipped to Chicago in the Jimmy Butler trade and has yet to solidify himself as a reliable two-way option.\n\nShooting guard: Andrew Wiggins (2014-present)\n\nStats: 413 games, 8,096 points, 1,770 rebounds, 913 assists, 415 steals, .442 FG%, .332 3P%\n\nAnalysis: As underwhelming as Wiggins has often been, his sparkling start to this season aside, he earns the spot for his prolific scoring and for the team’s incredible dearth of wings during this decade. Only seven of the 21 players who have cracked 1,000 points in a Wolves uniform this decade could be classified as wing players, and no Wolves player has more points since 2010 than him. His performance early this season has instilled some hope that a breakthrough is coming, but all in all, the wait continues.\n\nHonorable mention: Kevin Martin. One of the most natural scorers the Wolves have ever had, but his heart never seemed to be in Minnesota. Perhaps his best moment was a spirited performance in Adelman’s final game as a coach. Otherwise, a forgettable run.\n\nWhat might have been: Zach LaVine. The Wolves surprised some by drafting him 13th overall despite his coming off the bench at UCLA. But Flip Saunders and Milt Newton believed he was the key component to their young trio of Wiggins and Karl-Anthony Towns. His personality fit perfectly right between Wiggins’ quiet and Towns’ loquaciousness. LaVine showed promise as a scorer, but his struggles on defense and a knee injury led to the decision to include him in the offer for Butler.\n\nSmall forward: Jimmy Butler (2017-2019)\n\nStats: 69 games, 1,520 points, 366 rebounds, 331 assists, 140 steals, .474 FG%, .355 3P%\n\nAnalysis: Probably the most divisive choice, but impossible to ignore. He was All-NBA in his lone full season, teaming with Towns to lead the Wolves to their first postseason berth since 2004. He played a major role in a 47-win season, but he also set about burning down everything that was being built. The match he lit at the start of last season was as flammable as anything any player has done to his team in recent memory. But that one season …\n\nHonorable mention: Robert Covington. He played only 22 games before going down with an injury last season, but he played more defense in those 22 games than any Timberwolves wing has in the entirety of this decade. He was Defensive Player of the Year-level good. And it was jarring to see someone in that jersey who was that ferocious on defense.\n\nWhat might have been: Shabazz Muhammad. Flip chose him begrudgingly, believing that his scoring and his energy would at least make him a rotation player. There were times when he channeled that energy and thirst for buckets and it looked OK. But his work ethic and one-dimensional game never panned out.\n\nPower forward: Kevin Love (2010-14)\n\nStats: 223 games, 5,248 points, 3,061 rebounds, 678 assists, 403 3-points, .450 FG%, .370 3P%\n\nAnalysis: A no-brainer. Love was the team’s first All-Star post-KG and the first franchise player who gave fans real hope that better days were ahead. He was ahead of his time, a rebounding machine who could step out and hit 3s like a guard. Unfortunately, his relationship with the franchise, and the city, soured after David Kahn’s mishandling of his contract negotiations.\n\nHonorable mention: Taj Gibson. What a warrior. Gibson was just a two-year starter, but he did a little bit of everything here. Rugged defender, capable scorer, locker room pillar. Everything you could have asked for, and more.\n\nWhat might have been: Derrick Williams. The No. 2 overall pick came in with high hopes after a great performance in the NCAA tournament. But his game never translated to the pros. Too small for power forward, too big for small forward, and unable to refine his game enough to make up for the shortcomings. Now he stars in Germany.\n\nCenter: Karl-Anthony Towns (2015-present)\n\nStats: 337 games, 7,556 points, 4,005 rebounds, 890 assists, 502 blocks, 262 steals, .536 FG%, .398 3P%\n\nAnalysis: The new franchise. A two-time All-Star who has started this season like gangbusters. Though it’s early this season, Towns has seemingly addressed concerns about his defense and his ability to lead. The Wolves have handed him the keys to the castle, and he looks more and more worthy of the throne.\n\nHonorable mention: Gorgui Dieng. The longest-tenured active Timberwolf has been a starter, a valuable reserve and now appears to be on the outside looking in. But he is a prideful player who has had plenty of good moments in seven years here, a versatile defender and a reliable shooter from the midrange. On top of it all, he has done remarkable community work back home in Senegal.\n\nWhat might have been: Nikola Pekovic. Wildly productive when he was healthy. Unfortunately, those periods of health were too few and far between. Big, strong and with good footwork. Maybe just a little too big for his own good.\n\n(Photo of Jimmy Butler: Lachlan Cunningham / Getty Images)"
