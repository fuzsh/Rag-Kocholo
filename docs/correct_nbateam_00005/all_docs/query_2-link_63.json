        "text": "Russia’s former National Basketball Association (NBA) star Andrei Kirilenko has been unanimously elected President of the Russian Basketball Federation (RFB), it has been announced.\n\nThe 34-year-old, who only retired from playing in June, stood unopposed following the withdrawal of his only rival Dmitry Domani, currently general manager of the Russian national team.\n\nDuring a press conference to officially declare Kirilenko, who played in the NBA for 13 seasons during spells for Utah Jazz, Minnesota Timberwolves and the Brooklyn Nets, as the new President, he vowed to address “the very deep crisis of trust” lurking within Russian basketball.\n\nThe RBF has endured a tumultuous time as of late amid strained relations with the International Basektball Federation (FIBA) and has been plagued by infighting within the organisation.\n\nRussia’s national teams were banned from competing in international tournaments, with FIBA citing Governmental interference as the reason for the suspension imposed earlier this year.\n\nFIBA claimed “longstanding institutional and legal issues” had prevented the RFB from being governed properly.\n\nThe sport’s governing body has however allowed them to participate in upcoming competitions despite the ban, including the EuroBasket Championships in September, an event doubling as a qualification event for Rio 2016.\n\nThe EuroBasket events gives Russia’s men the opportunity to secure a spot at next year’s Olympic Games amid a turbulent period for their teams after the women failed to qualify.\n\nKirilenko, winner of an Olympic bronze with his country at London 2012, admitted that, as well as tackling the plethora of issues which are littering Russian basketball, a priority of his is to ensure the players are fully prepared for next moth's event.\n\n“It's really important to spend time on preparation, so that there is the most positive possible atmosphere in the 10 days that are left until the European Championship,” Kirilenko said.\n\n“We really don't want our players to have any problems with their preparation.\"\n\nThe suspension will be fully lifted once FIBA see marked improvement in the way basketball is governed in Russia and they have also announced they will set up a Task Force to establish statutes and regulations for the RFB.\n\nKirilenko has already brought a list of players and former players into roles within the organisation, including ex-Portland Trail Blazers forward Viktor Khryapa."
