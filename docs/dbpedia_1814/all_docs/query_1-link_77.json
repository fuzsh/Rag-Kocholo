Geological Background: Sitapahar structure It lies east of the Patiya and the west of the Gilasari and the Belasari structures. On the north of the Sitapahar anticline, Changotaung anticline is situated while bandarban anticline is located on the south. The Sitapahar anticline is a N20°W-S20°E trending structure plunging 6° in S18°E. The structure is about 40 km in length. Its steeper western flank is overturned in some places.The Karnafuli river is the main channel of the drainage system in the area. The courses of most of the important tributaries are parallel to the main range trending NNW-SSE and appear to be controlled by structural trend of the area. One of the most significant geomorphological features of the area is the course of SILCHHARI stream along the anticlinal axis. The stream is following the anticlinal valley and this type of valley is developed if comparatively weaker rocks are exposed along the axis. [Sifatul Quader Chowdhury]. A considerable thickness of clastic sediments of Miocene age is exposed on the western flank of Sitapahar Hill Range at Kaptai under the district of Rangamati in Bangladesh. So Kaptai is one of the most important places from the geological point of view. A comprehensive study was undertaken in that area in multidiscipline of geology within a short span of time. Hence, this article includes the gist of the overall geology of Kaptai region; particularly of Sitapahar anticline, where multidisciplinary approaches like geomorphology, stratigraphy, structural geology, and to some extent tectonic behavior of that area are incorporated. The tectonic evolution of this region ranges from Cretaceous through Tertiary to Quaternary. The study area comprises a continuous succession of sandstone, silt stone, and shale. The rock sections are divided into three lithostratigraphic units, mainly on the basis of gross lithology. These units are equivalent to upper Bhuban, Bokabil, and Alluvium Formations. Due to the absence of paleontological records in the area, actual age determination of the rocks was not possible. However, from correlation, it is found that the rocks are of Miocene age. Sandstone, silt stone, and shale of this area are being used for different purposes, which have got economic importance to some extent. The region is supposed to contain oil and gas as some of their traces were found. Hence detail exploration should be accomplished immediately.\n\n3. Population: The total population is 5,08,182 according to 2005 census of which tribal 52% and non-tribal 48%. The number of males is 2,87,060 and the females are 2,38,043 (Census 2001). The density of population is 83 per square kilometer (Census 2001). The number of household is 1,03,974 having the household size 4.8 (Census 2001). The total population is divided into Bangalees and eleven tribes (ethnic minorities):Chakma, Marma, Tanchangya, Tripura, Pankua, Lushai, Khiang, Murang, Rakhain, Chak, Bowm,Khumi. Tribal population : (as per census of 2005 ): Chakma-1,86,395, Marma-44,727, Tanchanga- 18,607, Tripura-6,697, Pankho- 2,118, Bowm-1,053, khyang- 791, Lusai- 217, Chak- 177, Rakhain-70, Khumi- 50, Gurkha-03, Etc.-174. As per 1991 census, the religious breakup of the population of the district were: Buddhist 53.83%,Muslim 39.28%, Hindu 5.62% and Christian 1.12%. Religious institutions Pagoda 1230, Mosque 1059, Temple 65, Church 16. Genderwise, male constituted 53.59% and female constituted 46.41% of the population.\n\n4. Geography: Rangamati is located in the Chittagong Division. It is bordered by the Tripura state of India to the north, Bandarban District to the south,Mizoram State of India and Chin State of Myanmar to the east, and Khagrachari and Chittagong Districts to the west. The area of the district is 6116 km2 of which 1292 km2 is riverine and 4825 km2 is under forest vegetation. Climate: It is highly difficult, if not impossible, to forecast what the weather will be like at a certain time in a very precise place. And yet, all travellers would like to know in advance the climate conditions in order to organize their future trip. Average temperatures or rainfall can help you to get a good idea of the issue. The temperatures mentioned hereafter are expressed in degrees Celsius and represent the monthly averages observed over a great number of years.\n\n5. Drainage and Streams The Karnafuli The principal river of the region. It originates in the Lushai Hills of Mizoram (India), flows through Rangamati and the port city of Chittagong and discharges into the Bay of Bengal near Patenga. A number of STREAMS flow upstream of Rangamati. The streams are: one originating near Thekamukh in Mizoram-Bangladesh border flowing through Harina, BARKAL and Sublong; one originating at Marishwa through Myanmukh and Langadu till reaching Subhalong; one flowing through Dangumura to Myanmukh; and one flowing through Mahalchhari to Rangamati. The streams meet near Rangamati and their combined flow is known as Karnafuli. The river is flashy and its length is about 131 km. Rainkhiang, Sublong, Thega, Kasalong, Ichamati and Halda are its main tributaries. Its major distributaries are Saylok' and Boalkhali. The only hydropower station of the country was built by constructing a DAM on this river at KAPTAI. The Karnafuli is navigable at Barkal and Kaptai but above Barkal it is shallow. With the construction of the Kaptai dam, this river has been blocked, and a large artificial lake has been created, and the bed of the river has also been much widened. This man-made lake provides a network of all-weather navigable routes in the area. Downstream of the dam the Karnafuli receives very little water in the dry season. The opening of the sluice gates of the dam creates water movement from the lake downstream. The river finally discharges into the Bay of Bengal. The port city of Chittagong is situated at the mouth of the river. BANGLADESH WATER DEVELOPMENT BOARD (BWDB) collects water level data through its 3 hydrometric stations located at Kodala, Chittagong and Patenga.\n\n6. Culture: The area is sparsely populated and presents and interesting disparity with thegeneral demographic picture in Rangamati. The people live on the top of the hillsand also on foot of the hills. The life is very hard in the investigated area as themajor part of the population of the area live mostly along the foot hills and most ofthe tribal people live on the hilly region.Total population of the Rangamati district is about 400000. Population density isabout 6000 per sq. km. Most of the people are poor and maintain their lives byhandicrafts and also cutting woods. Vegetation The investigated area is covered by forest with evergreen vegetation, which is dueto the good and suitable climatic condition of this region. Throughout the field area bushes are abundant with some fruit trees like mango, jackfruit, guava are alsonumerous. Besides these tall trees like Garjan, Jarul, Shal, Shegun etc are notuncommon. The major agricultural activity of this area is shifting cultivation, theyalso grow pineapple, ginger, turmeric etc. It is preferred in high steep hill ranges where pineapples, ginger, turmeric etc. in lowhill ranges. Both Sedentary and Jhuming cultivations are practiced here.\n\n7. Tectonics The Sitapahar anticline is the most prominent structure of the investigated area which axis is trending NNW-SSE direction along the main structure of the Chittagong – Tripura Folded Belt (CTFB). This doubly plunging anticlinal structure is about 400km long and 12-15 km wide and major part of the western flank is steeper than the eastern flank. The western flank dips in an angle ranging from 400 to 850and the eastern flank shows dip ranging from 4-85◦ which indicate that the anticline is an asymmetric anticline. From the attitude of the beds the anticline is suspected as a plunging anticline. A regional fault is believed to run along the axis of the structure which trend is North direction. The eastern side of the fault is acted as foot wall and the western part acts as a hanging wall which indicate the presence of reserve fault at ManikChari (Ferdouse 1999) which is at a few kilometer east of Ghagra. A normal faultis found at Sundari Chara.\n\n8. Stratigraphy: The exposed Neogene succession represents an overall basinward progradationfrom deep marine through shallow marine to continental fluvialenvironments.Based on regionally correlatable erosion surfaces the entire succession (3000+ mthick) has been grouped into three composite sequences C, B and A, from oldest toyoungest. (1) Unit C (lower unit, 71 m thick) is characterized by several thin packets of turbidites and slumped beds contained within a muddy sequence. Theunit is thought to have been deposited in a setting not far basinward from the base-of-slope. (2) Unit B (middle unit, 291 m thick) is a monotonous muddy slopedeposit that contains some localized zones of very thin-bedded turbidites. (3) UnitA (upper unit, 208 m thick) represents the progradation of the first shoreface sand body on a 176-m-thick shelfal mud. Detailed bed by bed measurements have beencarried out in all these units. A general litho-stratigraphic column of the lower partof the Surma Group exposed in the Sitapahar anticline have been given in Fig 8.On the basis of the overall regional tectonic setting discussed in Section 2, it isassumed that the trend of paleo-coastline in the CTFB was oriented north – south. Alam (1995) documented a similar paleo-coastline trend from paleocurrent analysisof the Surma Group in the Sitapahar Anticline. The measured current directionsrepresent landward (eastward) and basinward (westward) directions\n\n9. Course of Karnaphuli River: It has possibly maintained its older course keeping pace with the uplift of the hill ranges and can be classified as an antecedent river. The Karnafuli is narrow and straight from Prankiang towaggachhari along Kaptai-Chandraghona road. The straightness of the river is probably due to a fault, which controlled the channel from Prankiang to Wagga. The main tributaries of the Karnafuli are the kasalong, Chengi, halda and Dhurung on the right and the Subalong, Kaptai, Rinkeong and Thega on the left.Flowing to the west through rangunia upazila and then keepingraozan upazila on the north and boalkhali upazila on the south, it receives the waters of the Halda river at Kalurghat just above the railway bridge. There is a legend about the naming of the Karnafuli river. It says an Arakanese princess who fell in love with a tribal prince of Chittagong was once enjoying a moonlit boatride on the river with the prince. While admiring the reflection of the moon dancing on the rippled water surface, the princess inclined slightly and a flower tucked in the hair over her ear by the prince suddenly fell into the river. The princess was grief-stricken at losing the flower, which she held very dear as a present from her charming prince. She immediately jumped into the river to retrieve the flower but could not. Instead she was carried away by the fast-flowing current and vanished in the river. The prince dived into the river to rescue the princess but in vain. Out of sorrow he drowned himself in the river to unite with the princess after death. This tragedy gave the river its name Karnafuli from the word 'karnaful' meaning 'flower adorning the ear'. The river is known to the Marma tribe as the Kynsa Khyong. Water Chemistry: The river Karnafully is one of the Himalayan River originating from the Lushai Hills in India. The catchments of the Karnafully and its allied streams cover 5,500 (14,000 sq km) square miles. Water samples were collected from Karnafully River along different points and analyzed for various physiochemical parameters during winter. Effects of industrial wastes, municipality sewage and agricultural runoff on the river water were investigated. The study was conducted between the Kaloorghat Bridge and Patenga estuary including Chittagong port. This is the most polluted area due to the presence of many chemical fertilizers, iron, leather and pharmaceutical industries. All these industries discharge their untreated toxic waste water directly into the river Karnafully. The study involved determination of physical and chemical parameters of surface water at different points. The mean values of water temperature, total suspended solids (TSS), total dissolved solids (TDS), total solids (TS), turbidity, dissolved oxygen (DO), bio-chemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), pH, electric conductivity and total alkalinity were 23°C, 365.87 mg/L, 8018.8, 8518.33 mg/L, 31.54 FTU, 1.55 mg/L, 6.65 mg/L, 13961 μs/cm, 247.47 mg/L, 560.27 mg/L and 4.8 mg/L respectively."
