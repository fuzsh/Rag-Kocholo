        "text": "City in Barisal Division, Bangladesh\n\nThis article is about the city. For the upazila, see Barisal Sadar Upazila. For the district, see Barisal District. For the division, see Barisal Division.\n\nMetropolis in Barisal Division, Bangladesh\n\nBarisal ( or ; Bengali: বরিশাল, pronounced [boɾiʃal]),[a] officially known as Barishal,[4] is a major city that lies on the banks of the Kirtankhola river in south-central Bangladesh. It is the largest city and the administrative headquarter of both Barisal District[b] and Barisal Division. It is one of the oldest municipalities and river ports of the country. The city was once called the Venice of the East or the Venice of Bengal.[6]\n\nBarisal municipality was established in 1876 during the British rule in India and upgraded to City Corporation on 25 July 2002.[7] Barisal is Bangladesh's third largest financial hub after Dhaka and Chittagong.[8][9] The city consists of 30 wards and 50 mahallas with a population of 533,000, according to the 2023 national census and with the voter of about 250,000 according to the 2018 voter list of city election.[10] The area of the city is 58 km2.[11]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nBarisal was part of the ancient kingdoms of Vanga, Gangaridai and Samatata. The region was ruled by Khadga, Pala, Chandra, Sena and Deva dynasty in the mediaeval period. It was conquered by Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khalji and was later a significant territory of the Delhi Sultanate and Bengal Sultanate. After the decline of the Suri Empire, the territory became a semi-independent area in the Mughal period because of heavy fighting between the Muslims and Hindu chiefs, although most parts of the city were totally under the control of the governors of the proto-industrialised Bengal Subah. In course of time, it fell under the Bengal Nawabs. Raja Ramranjan Chakravarty was put as a de jure king during the Bengal Presidency of the British, later passed to East Pakistan at independence and finally Bangladesh.[12]\n\nIn ancient times, it was called Chandradwip (চন্দ্রদ্বীপ), while during the Medieval Islamic times it was also known as Ismailpur & Bacola (বাকলা) in Europe. Ralph Fitch, the first ever Englishman, a leather merchant, known to have visited Bengal in the mid-1580s, described Barisal in his journal as, \"From Chatigan in Bengal, I came to Bacola; the king whereof is a Gentile, a man very well disposed and delighted much to shoot in a gun. His country is very great and fruitful, and hath store of rice, much cotton cloth, and cloth of silk. The houses are very fair and high built, the streets large, and people naked, except a little cloth about their waist. The women wear a great store of silver hoops about their necks and arms, and their legs are ringed with silver and copper, and rings made from elephants' teeth.\"[13]\n\nThe central city of this region is the city of Barisal. It is one of the biggest river ports in Bangladesh. It is a city with nearly 0.38 million people and a divisional headquarters, medical college, cadet college, some pharmaceutical industries, textile industries and the Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority's head office.
