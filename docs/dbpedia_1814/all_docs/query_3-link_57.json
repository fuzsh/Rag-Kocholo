        "text": "Birangana (Liberation War Heroine) Rama Chowdhury was laid to rest at her birthplace with state honour at Popadia village in Boalkhali upazila of Chittagong on Monday afternoon.\n\nInstead of cremating, the family members decided to bury her complying with her last wish.\n\nPeople from all walks of life paid their last respect when the mortal remains of the freedom fighter reached her birthplace around 2:30pm of Monday.\n\nEarlier, her body was taken to Chattogram Central Shaheed Minar where she was given a state honour as a freedom fighter.\n\nLike many people, eminent writer and freedom fighter Begum Mustari Shafi came to Shaheed Minar to pay her last respect to Rama Chowdhury.\n\n\"Rama Chowdhury struggled throughout her life. She refused to accept donations from anyone. She is a courageous woman. She led her life by selling her own books. Her contribution to the society is beyond measure,\" said Mustari Shafi.\n\nChattogram Divisional Commissioner Abdul Mannan, CMP Additional Commissioner Amena Begum, acting Deputy Commissioner of Chattogram Habibur Rahman, AL leaders Moslem Uddin and Mofizur Rahman, BNP leaders Dr Shahadat Hossain and Abu Sufian and CPB leader Ashok Saha, among others, to have paid respect to Rama Chowdhury at Shaheed Minar.\n\nRama Chowdhury died while undergoing treatment at Chattogram Medical College Hospital (CMCH) on Monday.\n\nBorn in 1941, Rama obtained her Masters degree in Bengali literature from Dhaka University in 1961. She authored 19 books throughout her lifetime. Rama lost her husband and two children in the Liberation War of 1971.\n\nOn May 13, 1971, the occupying Pakistani army tortured and violated her. They also torched her house at Popadia in Boalkhali upazila of Chittagong.\n\nOut of grief and respect for the freedom fighters, Roma walked barefooted from 1972.\n\nThough she momentarily stopped doing so due to a health condition, she resumed the practice on December 16, 1998 when her youngest son was killed in a road accidentâ€”and never stopped the practice afterwards.\n\nRelated story"
