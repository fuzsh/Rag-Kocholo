        "text": "For three decades, a two-kilometer stretch of Haji Badiuzzaman road in the Charkhizirpur union of Boalkhali upazila has been a source of relentless hardship. The road's condition has deteriorated to the point of being impassable, subjecting thousands of villagers to immense suffering. The road's state renders it virtually unusable during heavy rainfall due to flooding and in dry seasons, it transforms into a dust-ridden path. Regrettably, the local representatives appear to limit their involvement to merely observing the road's dire condition.\n\nA recent visit to the area starkly illustrated the challenges faced by people attempting to navigate this road. Marked by deep potholes, some locals have resorted to makeshift fixes with bricks, risking further hazards. Concerns loom over potential accidents due to these conditions.\n\nResidents express deep frustration, as the road's appalling state brings significant suffering. Inadequate infrastructure hinders access to medical facilities and emergency services. Even basic tasks, like seeing a doctor, have become arduous due to the road's condition.\n\nRobija Khatun, from Ward 7 in Char Khijirpur Union, emotionally shared her daily struggles. \"We're not asking for much, just a road that lets us live with dignity. We plead, we're on our knees, begging for this road to be fixed. Our lives are dominated by this road. Can't anyone see our suffering? Why is it ignored year after year?\" she tearfully questioned.\n\nDespite occasional visits by journalists, the situation remains unchanged. Md. Masud Alam lamented the repetitive cycle—journalists come, document the dire state, yet no action follows. The deteriorating road not only inconveniences residents but also jeopardizes their safety.\n\nAbul Hossen pointed out the contrast between the political changes in the region and the stagnant road repair efforts. \"Leadership has changed, yet this road has stayed the same since 1990. It's as if we're invisible. The road lacks maintenance while residents endure its harsh realities,\" he said.\n\nLocal authorities acknowledge the urgency. Rezaul Karim Raja, Upazila Parishad Chairman, is committed to resolving the issue. \"After inspecting the road at Sarjamine, I will discuss this with the MP and take swift action for repairs,\" he assured.\n\nAssistant Engineer Mohammad Faruk Hossen emphasized the situation's urgency. \"We've proposed repairs under the Greater Chittagong-4 Project. If approved, we can expect progress in the upcoming fiscal year,\" he said.\n\nAs the suffering of Char Khijirpur Union's residents continues, hopes rest on effective road repair initiatives that can finally end decades of pain and isolation."
