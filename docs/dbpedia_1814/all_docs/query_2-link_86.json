        "text": "This article is about the city of Sylhet. For other uses, see Sylhet (disambiguation).\n\nMetropolis in Sylhet Division, Bangladesh\n\nSylhet (Bengali: সিলেট; IPA: [sileʈ]), is a metropolitan city located in the northeastern region of Bangladesh. It is the administrative center of Sylhet Division and is situated on the banks of the Surma River. Sylhet is the fifth-largest city in Bangladesh, with a population of around 700,000 people.\n\nSylhet is known for its tea plantations and natural beauty.[4] The city has a history dating back to the 14th century and has been ruled by various dynasties and empires, including the Mughals, British, and the Nawabs of Bengal. The city is also home to several important landmarks, such as the Shah Jalal Dargah, which is one of the holiest sites in Bangladesh and attracts thousands of pilgrims every year.[5]\n\nSylhet is one of the most economically important cities in Bangladesh after Dhaka and Chittagong.[6] Sylhet is a major commercial and financial center, and it is home to several multinational companies and industries, including the tea industry, which generates a significant amount of revenue for the city. The city has a diverse population, with Bengalis, Tripuris, and other ethnic groups living together. The official language of Sylhet is Standard Bengali, while Sylheti is the most spoken. English is widely spoken and understood because people from Sylhet form a significant portion of the Bangladeshi diaspora, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States. According to The Daily Star, about 95% of Bangladeshi population in the UK comes from the Sylhet district.[7] Sylhet has diverse transport infrastructure, with a modern airport, railway station, and bus terminals that connect it to other parts of the country.[8] The city also has several educational institutions, including Sylhet Agricultural University, Shahjalal University of Science and Technology, and Sylhet Cadet College.\n\nEtymology and names\n\n[edit]\n\nSylhet is the anglicisation of শিলহট (Śilhôṭ), one of the archaic native names for the city.[citation needed] The local name is generally thought to be directly derived from শ্রীহট্ট (Śrīhaṭṭa), the Sanskrit name of the city.[9] The city of Śrīhaṭṭa takes its name from Śrīhaṭṭanātha, the tutelary deity of the Nātha dynasty who promoted the early settlement of Nāthas in the Surma and Barak valleys between the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, founding the Śrīhaṭṭa janapada and establishing Śrīhaṭṭanātha idols across the region.[10] The later Hindu rajas of Sylhet, such as Gour Govinda, continued to pay tribute to the deity as Hāṭkeśvara or Haṭṭanātha as evident from the Devipurana and copper-plate inscriptions.[11]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: History of Sylhet\n\nIn 1303, the Sultan of Lakhnauti Shamsuddin Firoz Shah conquered Sylhet by defeating Gour Govinda.[12] Sylhet was a realm of the Bengal Sultanate. In the 16th-century, Sylhet was controlled by the Baro-Bhuyan zamindars and later became a sarkar (district) of the Mughal Empire.[13] Sylhet emerged after 1612 as the Mughals' most significant imperial outpost in Bengal east of Dhaka, and its importance remained as such throughout the seventeenth century.[14] British rule began in the 18th century under the administration of the East India Company. Sylhet became a key source of lascars in the British Empire due in part to its ancient seafaring tradition. The Sylhet municipal board was established in 1867.[15] Originally part of the Bengal Presidency and later Eastern Bengal and Assam, the town became part of Colonial Assam in 1874. A devastating earthquake demolished almost the entire town on 12 June 1897 following which a modern and European model new town was built on the wreckage.[citation needed] From the beginning of the 20th century, the importance of Sylhet increased with the establishment of the tea industry.[citation needed]\n\nIn 1947, following a referendum and the partition of British India, Sylhet became part of East Pakistan.[12] In 1995, the Government of Bangladesh declared Sylhet as the sixth divisional headquarters of the country.[16] Sylhet has played a vital role in the Economy of Bangladesh. Several of Bangladesh's finance ministers have been members of parliament from the city of Sylhet. Badar Uddin Ahmed Kamran was a longtime mayor of Sylhet. Humayun Rashid Choudhury, a diplomat from Sylhet, served as President of the UN General Assembly and Speaker of the Bangladesh National Parliament.\n\nIn 2001, the municipality was upgraded to the Sylhet City Corporation. It was made a metropolitan city in 2009.[17]\n\nGeography and climate\n\n[edit]\n\nSylhet is located in the northeastern region of Bangladesh within the Sylhet Division, the Sylhet District, and Sylhet Sadar Upazila. Sylhet has a typical Bangladeshi tropical monsoon climate (Köppen Am) bordering on a humid subtropical climate (Cwa) at higher elevations. The rainy season runs from April to October, and is generally hot and humid with heavy showers and thunderstorms almost every day. The shorter dry season runs from November to February, with very warm and fairly clear weather. Nearly 80% of the annual average rainfall of 4,200 millimetres (170 in) occurs between May and September.[18]\n\nThe city is located within a topographically distinctive region of Bangladesh characterized by dramatic hills and basins. The physiography of Sylhet consists mainly of hill soils and encompasses a few large depressions known locally as \"beels,\" which are frequently oxbow lakes caused by tectonic subsidence during the earthquake of 1762.\n\nGeologically, the region is complex and diverse; higher-elevation regions date partly to the Plio-Miocene age. Available limestone deposits in different parts of the region suggest that the whole area was under the ocean in the Oligo-Miocene. In the last 150 years, three major earthquakes have hit the city with magnitude of at least 7.5 on the Richter Scale, most recently in 1918.[19]\n\nAdministration\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 10 April 2001, Sylhet was changed to a city corporation from a municipal board, and currently the city is administered by the Sylhet City Corporation. At present, Sylhet is the district-headquarters as well as the divisional headquarters of the districts of Sunamganj, Habiganj, Moulvibazar and Sylhet District. The Sylhet City Corporation is responsible for the services that are provided within the city which includes traffic, roads, garbage collection, water supply, registrations and many others. The corporation consists of the Mayor and 22 other commissioners, and focuses on the development of the city.[21] Sylhet is divided into 6 metropolitan thanas (police stations), 42 wards, and 1224 mahallas.[citation needed]\n\nMilitary\n\n[edit]\n\nSylhet is strategically important for the Bangladesh Armed Forces. The Bangladesh Army's 17th Infantry Division is based at Jalalabad Cantonment in Sylhet.[22] The cantonment is also home of the School of Infantry and Tactics (SI&T) and the 1st Para-commando Battalion, an elite commando unit of the Bangladesh Army.[citation needed]\n\nHealthcare\n\n[edit]\n\nSylhet is also home to many hospitals such as the Shahid Shamsuddin Hospital District Hospital, Sylhet MAG Osmani Medical College, Jalalabad Ragib-Rabeya Medical College, North East Medical College, and Sylhet Women's Medical College.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2018, Sylhet Medical University was established in the city, following the Prime Minister's order to found a medical university in each division with the goal of maintaining medical standards in colleges. According to the order, Chittagong and Rajshahi Medical University have already been established, and Sylhet Medical University is the fourth Medical University of the directive.[23][24]\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Demographics of Bangladesh\n\nAs of the 2011 Bangladesh census, Sylhet has a population of 485,138.[25] The population growth rate of the city is 1.73%, a decrease from 1.93% in 1991.[26] Sylhet has a sex ratio of 861 females to 1000 males and a literacy rate of 67.8%.[25]\n\nThe majority of the population are Bengali Muslims, while significant minority population groups include the Bengali Hindus, Bishnupriya Manipuri and others.[27] Sylheti is spoken by the vast majority of the people, while Standard Bengali is the official language used by the state government and officials.[28][29][30]\n\nThe majority of people in Sylhet are Muslims (87.3%), while other religious groups include Hindus (12.5%) and less than 0.2% of other religions, mainly Buddhists and Christians. The majority of Muslims in Sylhet are Sunnis who follow the Hanafi school of jurisprudence.[31] Significant numbers of people also follow Sufi ideals, particularly the teachings of Abdul Latif Fultali.[32]\n\nEconomy\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Sylhet Metropolitan Area is one of Bangladesh's main business centres. Sylhet's economy is closely linked with the Bangladeshi diaspora, especially the British Bangladeshi community. The city receives a significant portion of the country's annual remittances, which have driven growth in real estate and construction.[33] A number of shopping centres, restaurants and hotels have opened as a result. Sylhet also relies on religious tourism, with thousands of devotees visiting its Sufi shrines annually, as well as ecotourism in its broader natural hinterland.[citation needed] Nature resorts have been built in the city's outskirts. Several important Bangladeshi companies are based in Sylhet, including Jalalabad Gas Transmission and Distribution, Sylhet Gas Fields and Alim Industries. Biman Bangladesh Airlines operates several flights from Sylhet to the United Kingdom and the Middle East. Roads connect Sylhet with the Indian states of Meghalaya and Assam.\n\nSylhet's hinterland plays a vital role in the economy of Bangladesh. It is home to the country's largest natural gas fields, sole crude oil field,[34] largest tea plantations, rubber, palm oil, cane, agarwood[35] and citrus farms. Rice production in the region is one of the country's highest. Heavy industries include power plants, fertilizer plants, cement plants and liquefied petroleum gas plants. Other major industries in the region include ceramics, machinery and equipment, ready-made garments and pharmaceuticals. Most of the tea production in Bangladesh is based around Sylhet, much of which is eventually exported internationally.[citation needed]\n\nTwo Bangladeshi finance ministers from the city have been elected to the Jatiyo Sangshad for Sylhet: Saifur Rahman of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party; and Abul Maal Abdul Muhith of the Awami League. The present foreign affairs minister DR. A K Abdul Momen, who is the younger brother of Abdul Muhith, currently represents the Sylhet-1 seat in parliament.[citation needed]\n\nUtilities\n\n[edit]\n\nSylhet has high rates of electricity and water shortages. According to the Power Development Board, as of 2009, Sylhet was only receiving 50 MW, half of the required demand of 100 MW. The city corporation was also supplying only 22,500 gallons of water, far less than the demand of about 65,000.[36] The major sources of water to the city are the tube wells and the Surma River.[citation needed] Tests of tube wells in Sylhet District by the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology in 1997 found that about 27.6% contained more arsenic than the acceptable limit set by Bangladesh of 50 micrograms per liter, and 49.2% contained more arsenic than the World Health Organization standard of 10 micrograms per liter.[37] There are about 331 registered restaurants in the city, but only 15% maintain sanitary facilities and 85% have unhygienic conditions that are unsafe for the public.[38]\n\nCulture\n\n[edit]\n\nThe cultural identity of Sylhet has been shaped by a blend of indigenous practices, Sufi influences, and the assimilation of diverse communities. Sylhet is also known for its music scene, and it is home to several renowned musicians and artists.[citation needed] The city has a rich literary tradition, producing several notable writers and poets including Syed Mujtaba Ali and Humayun Ahmed.\n\nCuisine\n\n[edit]\n\nSylheti cuisine is known for its distinct flavors and aromatic dishes. Popular delicacies in the city include pitha (rice cakes), shorshe ilish (hilsa fish in mustard sauce), shatkora beef, and doi chira (flattened rice with yogurt). The region's love for tea is evident in its numerous tea gardens and the consumption of \"seven-layer tea,\" a unique layered beverage.\n\nSports\n\n[edit]\n\nCricket is the most popular sport in Sylhet.[citation needed] The Bangladesh Premier League franchise Sylhet Strikers are based in Sylhet International Cricket Stadium (M.A.G. Osmani Stadium), which was built in 2007 and has a capacity of 18,500 spectators. The Sylhet International Cricket Stadium was renovated in 2013 specifically to host matches for the 2014 ICC World Twenty20. It is situated near lush green tea gardens on the city fringe.[39] In the National Cricket League, Sylhet Division has not won any titles but did win in the One-Day Cricket League during the 2001–02 season. Notable players from Sylhet who have played for the Bangladesh national cricket team include Rajin Saleh,[40] Enamul Haque Jr,[41] Tapash Baisya,[42] and Alok Kapali.[43] Chess player Rani Hamid was awarded the FIDE Women's International Master (WIM) title in 1985, while her son Kaiser Hamid was the captain of the Bangladesh national football team in the early 90s.[44]\n\nTransport\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Transport in Bangladesh\n\nRoad\n\n[edit]\n\nThe main transport systems used in Sylhet are cycle rickshaws, auto rickshaws (mainly known as baby-taxis or CNGs), buses, mini-buses and cars. About 80,000 rickshaws run each day within the city. Bus service prices have increased up to 30% higher, and as of 2008 prices range from Tk 4 to 15.95.[45]\n\nThe N2 connects the city with Bangladesh's capital and largest city, Dhaka, as well as with many other parts of the country. The N2 highway is also part of the Asian Highway Network's two longest routes, AH1 and AH2.\n\nAir\n\n[edit]\n\nSylhet is served by Osmani International Airport, located at the north of the city.
