        "meta_description": "Background: Metabolic syndrome has long been recognized as a risk factor for coronary heart disease. However, the relationship between metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus and the independent contribution of metabolic syndrome remain unclear. This study was planned to evaluate the status of metabolic syndrome in type 2 diabetic population and the ability to predict type 2 diabetes mellitus in parallel with conventional stroke risk factors. Methods: A hospital-based descriptive observational study was conducted on 100 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who were selected using consecutive random sampling techniques. Patients were diagnosed through proper history taking, clinical examination, and necessary investigations. The outcome values were measured in anthropometric measurements, blood pressure, dyslipidemia, and blood glucose. Results: Among 100 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, 64% were females who were housewives (41%) with a significant difference (p < 0.001), and mean ± SD was 58 ± 12.24 yrs ranging 32–85 years. About 30% had a positive family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and 28% tobacco abuse. Of the total, 31% of the patients had high blood pressure, and 28% had low HDL with a significant difference (p < 0.001), but 46% had high triglyceride levels, which was not significant. More than half (53.12%) of females showed central obesity, while only 16.67% had central obesity among males, with a significant difference (p = 0.04) in both sexes. There was a high frequency of metabolic syndrome in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (68%) with a significant difference; 48% were female and 20 % were male. In patients with metabolic syndrome, central obesity was found in 36 (52.94%) patients where females were predominantly affected (32, 88.89%); hypertension found in 28 (4118%) patients where males were the predominantly affected (16, 57.14%) patients’ hypertriglyceridemia found in 44 (64.70%) patients, where females were the predominantly affected (26, 59.09%) patients; low HDL was found in 22 (32.35%) patients where females were the predominantly affected patients (16, 72.73%). Conclusion: The frequency of metabolic syndrome was more than double in women (48%). Central obesity and low HDL were significantly more prevalent in women than men, whereas hypertension was significant in men. Thus, it would be reasonable to conclude that women are more likely to suffer from metabolic syndrome from cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.",
