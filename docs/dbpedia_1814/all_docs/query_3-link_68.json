        "text": "Two people have died and heavy damage has been reported in several upazilas in Chattogram in the aftermath of Cyclone Hamoon. Two upazilas are completely without electricity as well.\n\nBanshkhali Upazila has suffered serious damage due to the storm, said Jasmine Akhtar, the upazila’s executive officer. Trees felled by the storm have cut off road connectivity in several parts of the upazila.\n\n“An initial report says that one person died in Saral Union. About 85 others have been injured.”\n\nThe upazila does not have power, Akhtar said. Internal roads are closed as well. The local authority is still trying to collect all the information, she said.\n\nA woman has died after a tree fell on her house due to the cyclone, said Milton Biswas, the Satkania Upazila executive officer.\n\nThe victim was identified as 65-year-old Bakuma Khatun from ward-5 of Khagria Union.\n\nMany trees were felled in several villages in the upazila, UNO Biswas said. Fallen branches and trees have also disrupted power lines. An initial report says that 123 houses were partially damaged by the storm.\n\nCyclone Hamoon hit the Chittagong-Cox's Bazar coast on Tuesday evening. After pouring rain in Cox’s Bazar, the cyclone turned into a low pressure system at around 1:00 pm.\n\nThe storm disrupted power in several areas including Satkania, Banshkhali, Chandanaish, Lohagara since Tuesday night.\n\nThough the electricity was restored in some upazilas, Banshkhali and Chandanaish are still without power, said Dilip Chandra Chowdhury, senior general manager and engineer at the Chattogram Rural Power Council-1.\n\nDilip said that trees had fallen in different areas and connection lines were severed. Electric poles were also uprooted or damaged in many places.\n\nPower lines have been damaged in Satkania Upazila, but its source line has been restarted, he said. However, it is not fully operational yet. The Banshkhali and Chandanaish upazilas are completely disconnected, he said.\n\nMd Saifullah Mazumdar, the relief and rehabilitation officer for the Chattogram district, said that news had come in of damage in many places, but details were scarce. Due to lack of power in certain areas, mobile networks have also been disrupted, which is making it difficult to collect information, he said."
