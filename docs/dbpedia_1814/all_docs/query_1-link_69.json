        "text": "DHAKA, May 28, 2024 (BSS) - Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina today asked the\n\nauthorities concerned to speedily repair the damaged embankments in the\n\ncoastal areas due to the recent tropical cyclone \"Remal\" that lashed the\n\ncountry.\n\nThe Premier gave the directive while chairing the 10th meeting of the\n\nExecutive Committee of the National Economic Council (ECNEC) held today at\n\nthe NEC Conference Room in the city's Sher-e-Bangla Nagar area.\n\nBriefing reporters after the meeting, Planning Minister Major General (Retd)\n\nAbdus Salam said the Prime Minister in the meeting asked the authorities\n\nconcerned to speedily repair the damaged embankments in the coastal areas\n\nowing to the impact of the cyclone \"Remal\".\n\nState Minister for Planning Md Shahiduzzaman Sarker, Planning Division Senior\n\nSecretary Satyajit Karmakar, Planning Commission members and secretaries\n\nconcerned were present at the briefing.\n\n\"The damaged embankments must be repaired speedily as monsoon is\n\napproaching,\" Salam said quoting the Premier.\n\nHe informed that the Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina also directed for ensuring\n\nsafe water in the affected areas so that water-borne diseases could not\n\nspread.\n\nAbdus Salam said the premier herself monitored the cyclone situation\n\nthroughout that night and gave necessary directives to the concerned agencies\n\nfor tackling the situation.\n\nHe said the state minister for Disaster Management and Relief informed the\n\nECNEC meeting that the loss of lives was less in the cyclone since all the\n\ngovernment agencies, district and upazila administrations were cautious\n\nenough to face the situation.\n\nPlanning Division Senior Secretary Satyajit Karmakar said the day's ECNEC\n\nmeeting approved a total of 11 projects involving an overall estimated cost\n\nof Taka 14,337.38 crore. \"Of the total project cost, Taka 6,541.52 crore will\n\ncome from the government of Bangladesh portion, Taka 7,879.15 crore from the\n\ndevelopment partners while Taka 83.29 crore from the concerned organisation's\n\nown fund,\" he added.\n\nOf the approved 11 projects, eight are new while three are revised projects.\n\nTurning to the cyclone \"Remal\", Satyajit said Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina\n\nmonitored the cyclone situation intensively all throughout and thus gave\n\nnecessary directives to the field-level officials at district and upazila\n\nlevel to deal with the situation in a coordinated manner.\n\nThe Prime Minister reminded of all the concerned officials and stakeholders\n\nto keep operative the land phones alongside the mobile phone networks in such\n\ncalamities, he added.\n\nSheikh Hasina also directed the government officials irrespective of their\n\nportfolios to stand beside the affected people of the tropical cyclole\n\n\"Remal\".\n\nThe Premier also asked the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief to\n\nassess the loss of lives and properties in the cyclone \"Remal\" (verifying\n\nmedia reports if needed) and thus publish its brief by next Sunday.\n\nSatyajit said the ECNEC meeting today approved two separate cluster projects\n\nfor the benefits of the forcibly displayed Rohingya people and the host\n\ncommunities in the Chattogram Division.\n\nThese two projects are--Host and Forcibly Displaced Myanmar Nationals\n\n(FDMN)/Displaced Rohingya Population (DRP) Enhancement of Lives Through a\n\nMulti-Sectoral Approach Project (HELP): Infrastructure Related Project with\n\nTaka 4,081.84 crore where the World Bank would provide Taka 2,329.89 crore as\n\nloan and Taka 1,485 crore as grant.\n\nThe another project is Inclusive Services and Opportunities (ISO) for Host\n\nCommunities and FDMN Populations Project with Taka 4,401.13 crore where the\n\nWorld Bank will provide Taka 2,145.38 crore as loan and Taka 1,759.37 crore\n\nas grant.\n\nFor the first time, these aforesaid two projects were approved by the Prime\n\nMinister through Project Planning System (PPS) software which would\n\neventually infuse more dynamism into the operations of the Planning\n\nCommission as well as make those time-bound, Satyajit continued.\n\nHe said the premier asked all concerned officials involved in the execution\n\nof these two projects to think 'out of the box' and exercise their\n\ninnovations to successfully implement those through facing possible\n\nchallenges and obstacles.\n\nThe Planning Division Senior Secretary further said that the World Bank would\n\nprovide the grant amount for the Rohingya people while the loan amount would\n\nbe spent in the areas of health, education, roads, forestry, railways for the\n\nbenefits of the host community since they are also affected for the forcibly\n\ndisplaced Rohingya people.\n\nHe said at the very beginning of the negotiations with the World Bank for\n\navailing support, the lending agency only pressed for lending support to the\n\nRohingyas, not for the host community. But, due to the strong stance of the\n\ngovernment, the World Bank later agreed to support the host community also\n\nalongside the Rohingyas.\n\nSatyajit also informed that the World Bank loan would be very soft.\n\nHe informed that a central coordination unit would be there at the Economic\n\nRelations Division (ERD) for these two projects for Rohingyas and the host\n\ncommunity while a committee headed by Prime Minister's Principal Secretary\n\nwould oversee the operations.\n\nWhen asked whether the fresh Annual Development Programme (ADP) for the next\n\nfiscal year (FY25) is loan-based, Satyajit said neither the country's\n\neconomy, nor the fresh ADP is loan-based.\n\nHe said despite various challenges and adversities, the budget deficit of the\n\ncountry never crossed five percent of GDP.\n\nReplying to another question, the Planning Minister said Bangladesh has been\n\nwitnessing balanced development during the rule of Awami League government.\n\nSince the present government put much emphasis on implementation, he said a\n\nrecord number of 356 projects are going to be completed within this fiscal\n\nyear ending in June."
