        "text": "MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT IN PNG: From one of my previous post I proposed for the re- design of municipal waste management system structure in PNG using this idea of RE- THINK, RE-DESIGN, RE-CYCLE. RE-THINK: Think of the future generation, Think back to as far as you can remember when you as an individual knew how to segregate and managed your wastes. Think of how the life cycle works and how much damage rubbish wastes is polluting the environment we depend on. Think of the best solution to solid waste management system in PNG... \" Think globally, Act locally\" RE-DESIGN: Current structure of PNG's process of Municipal Solid Waste Management need to be re-designed to suit re-cycling. This concept needs socio economic surveys and feasibility studies in a small town as a pilot project. For a start; businesses, schools & residential homes can practice segregation where dump trucks can collect rubbish at its second best use and bring to the recycling facility. RE-CYCLE: Once municipal wastes have under gone thorough segregation at the recycling facility where the rest which are beyond recycling or cannot be recycled will be transported/transffered to the incenration facility where all gets to be incenrated to dust so it can be used for another recycling purpose. SUMMARY: The whole idea proposed or solution is that nothing goes to waste. We save the waste at its second best use and we eventually do away with dumpsites and landfills by replacing it with recycling facilities...\n\nWaste management. This is the elephant in construction. Recent survey in Kenya showing that about 35% waste is generated from construction. Construction waste end up in wrong landfills. This is because majority do not track their waste and get to know where the waste ends up to. A big number of business waste handlers have no care where to dump the waste once collected from sites. We need to be a little more aggressive in monitoring this. Probably ,ministry of environment and natural resources/ NEMA/ Kenya forest services/Kenya wildlife services/ water related agencies can be in front line to enforce waste dumping in the right allocated landfills. I can see someone thinking it's not a function of water agencies, my reasoning is synergizing need be the plan because it ends up being their issue when their scope is affected and being part of protectors cannot be inevitable. The beautiful thing is we have counties, I Environment and Natural resources is a devolved function but it can also not be distanced from National government. I am convinced both can work and give good results. Our rivers , lakes and the Indian Ocean are suffocated by waste dumped by ignorant people who are in business. This business need be done right. I would propose that those in waste handling business should also be promoting waste management. The one recycling should be the licenced to do the business. If we are looking at generating employment, why not involve groups that have started recycling waste to produce other goods. ( am not starting a battle here from those that are doing it from the point of connection or side hustle ) We have to start at the generation point , the first most crucial practice is segregating waste. We will get it right at that point. Once sorted, we have the right (competent - recycling in that case) handler awarded the business , the tracking is done by the contractors , the contractor should update different waste types generated. This can be done through an online account linked to one of the agencies. Thereafter the urgency should monitor recycling , update in the website different products we get from these efforts. Is this too much to ask? Can this work ? It is not , we can achieve this if we want to . Every construction site needs to comply. Simply create a job opportunity for an Environmentalist or HSE , empower the person to spearhead this is done right ( all professionals in this area can clap for me ). When we have the targets for the agencies officers to monitor the rate of complying this can work . Risks. I am aware of what is required. Getting all contractors who want to make profit employ is the last thing from their side . Getting agency officers to be so prudent to ensure compliance is another deal. However, I think this can work to save lives ,to save ourselves because without clean rivers , lakes and ocean we are vulnerable to health issues from water . comments ???\n\nWE WANT YOU!!!! Head of Economic Development. Chief of Staff. Deputy Director. DEQ- Department of Environmental Quality. These high level people are needed to help assist us in permanent change to the Waste Management industry. Who are we? We are #Carbotura. Our services are designed to augment with the current waste management processes and are perfect for eliminating contaminated recycling, waste byproducts from incineration, landfill overfills, and landfill mining. With our technology which is considered a Waste to Manufacturing process ( WtM ) (Not a waste management process), there is no need for sorting, combustion of waste, or emissions from our processing. Our system can handle any type of waste, ( MSW) municipal solid waste, (MLW) municipal liquid waste, large package formats, bales, whole tires, sludge, and much more. One of the many key benefits of our services is that they are 100% #circular. We #divert 100% of the #waste from #landfills and #recycle 100% of the #materials. Our system is also 2-3x more efficient than any other method and requires no external power or water. This makes our services the lowest cost in dollars and to the #environment. Carbotura Zero-Fill integrates a comprehensive zero-cost business model that only requires a standing guarantee on garbage supply and recycling fee payment, that is rebated annually. This has extended cost savings in the ability to stop handling waste 3-4 times through the current logistics processes, reducing costs, emissions, and overall community carbon footprint. Carbotura Zero-Fill services can be rapidly deployed in a modular fashion, so that our clients can enjoy immediate and distributed 100% recycling, 100% diversion, Zero-Emissions, and zero-waste. This can all be started at 400 (TPD) ton per day, There is no #financing or #funding required from any City, County, or State if a long-term commitment is made to provide a continuous waste stream to the facility. Ideally, a 30- year partnership to modernize waste infrastructure is required dedicating the contracted waste-stream volumes to the Carbotura facility including all municipal solid waste, plastics, tires, and any other applicable waste material under Community management or direction with no sorting necessary. Under these guidelines, Carbotura would #fund the entire deployment of services. Our services can be standalone or co-located with waste handling facilities. We can also supply distributed customer premise equipment for shredding, baling, wrapping, loading, as well as flatpack containers for shipping to our nearest service center We are now accepting proposals for our investment RFP. We're looking to invest $200M to $2B in communities committed to economic growth, zero waste, 100% recycling, that want high-paying jobs, and want to increase property values. Thank you for you time, message me to schedule a meeting. Always leave it better than you found it. Brian Hall\n\nTurning our waste into an energy carrier in microwave steam plasma Waste-to-energy plant a great alternative to reduce the area for waste treatment and disposal, in addition to generating energy for all small cities in the region. A good alternative is to create an intermunicipal cooperative between small cities to share costs, revenues, energy generated and technological knowledge. The conversion of plastic and tire waste into an energy carrier - heating oil, diesel, grill coke, syngas - has become relevant because the production of electricity from waste is slowly being replaced by solar and wind energy, because their operating costs are almost zero. It is a social advantage if small villages are supplied with locally produced energy, thus creating local jobs for the local energy-using population from waste collected locally, small equipment for micro power plants can also be manufactured locally Our innovation in environmental protection is the use of microwave technology The pyrolysis of waste in vapor microwave plasma. The main advantage of steam plasma reactors is that there is no nitrogen in the steam plasma, the plasma reactor, the gasifier and the plasma afterburner chamber, so there is no nitrogen oxides is 40 times more toxic CO, minimum carbon dioxid and odorless the flue gas. The hydrogen introduced into the reaction space with the steam plasma slows down the reactions of gaseous sulphur, phosphorus and free chlorine formation to remove in the gas purification unit. When reacting with chlorine-containing substances, water vapor plasma does not produce dioxin, which is one of the most toxic substances. technology: www.gumienergia.hu\n\nSolid Waste Generation in India refers to the production of unwanted and discarded materials in solid form, including household waste, industrial waste, construction debris, and more. As of my last knowledge update in September 2021 Solid Waste Generation in India: India generated over 150,000 metric tonnes of solid waste per day in 2019. It was estimated that urban areas contributed to around 68% of this waste generation. The per capita waste generation rate in India varies significantly by region but generally ranges from 0.2 kg to 0.6 kg per person per day in urban areas. Solid Waste Management in India: Collection: Collection of solid waste is typically done by municipal authorities or private contractors. Informal waste pickers are also involved in waste collection in many cities. Transportation: Collected waste is transported to transfer stations or disposal sites using a variety of vehicles, including trucks and tricycles. Segregation: In many areas, waste segregation into biodegradable and non-biodegradable categories is promoted at the household level. Treatment and Disposal: Waste treatment and disposal methods include landfills, composting, waste-to-energy plants, and recycling facilities. However, not all waste is treated appropriately, leading to environmental challenges. Tools and Initiatives: Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (Clean India Campaign): Launched by the Government of India in 2014, this program focuses on sanitation and solid waste management. It has promoted the construction of household and community toilets and aimed to make India open defecation-free. Integrated Municipal Solid Waste Management (IMSWM): An initiative to promote sustainable and comprehensive solid waste management, including segregation at source and recycling. National Urban Livelihoods Mission (NULM): Encourages the inclusion of waste pickers and informal waste workers into formal waste management systems. Smart Cities Mission: Some cities under this initiative have incorporated modern technologies and best practices in solid waste management. Toolkits and Technologies: India has been exploring technologies such as Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for waste mapping, composting kits for organic waste recycling, waste-to-energy plants, and various mobile applications to improve waste management.\n\n■ What is SWM cess and why is it levied on waste generators? ✅The Bengaluru Urban Body has proposed a Solid Waste Management (SWM) Cess of ₹100 per month for each household. ✅It is important to understand the rationale behind SWM cess, its intended use, and the broader context of solid waste management challenges faced by Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) in India. ● Key highlights: ✅Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) levy user fees or SWM cess as per the provisions of Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016. ✅ULBs are now considering revising these rates and imposing higher charges on bulk waste generators to meet a portion of the costs incurred in providing SWM services. ● What are the costs? ✅ULBs typically deploy about 80% of their manpower and up to 50% of their annual budgets to provide SWM services to city residents. ✅Bangalore generates about 5,000 tonnes of solid waste per day. ✅Managing this volume of waste requires around 5,000 door-to-door waste collection vehicles, 600 compactors, and about 20,000 Sanitation Workers ✅SWM services comprise four components: collection, transportation, processing and disposal. ✅Collection and transportation are resource and labor-intensive and come up to 85-90% of the SWM budget, whereas only about 10-15% is spent on processing and disposal of waste. ● What are the challenges? ✅Solid waste generated in Indian cities consists of about 55-60% wet biodegradable material and 40-45% non-biodegradable material. ✅Although 55% of the wet waste can be converted into organic compost or biogas, the yield is as low as 10-12%, making both composting and biogas generation from solid waste financially unviable. ✅Apart from financial challenges, ULBs face other challenges associated with SWM services, such as extra work of clearing drains, preventing open littering, seasonal changes in waste generation, and sweeping operations. ✅Disposal of non-compostable and non-recyclable dry waste, such as single-use plastic, textile waste and inert materials, is expensive since the material needs to be shipped to cement factories or waste-to-energy projects located about 400-500 km from cities. ● What is the solution? ✅Although collection and transportation of waste generate no revenue, several strategies can reduce overall expenditure on SWM and lower user charges. ✅These are segregation of waste at source, ✅reducing single-use plastic, decentralised composting initiatives, ✅Information, Education and Awareness (IEC) to prevent open littering, and ✅asking bulk waste generators to process their own waste. ✅A balanced approach, combining marginal user charges with efficient operations, could help make our cities cleaner.\n\nExploring Investment Opportunities in India's Waste Management Sector India's rapid growth necessitates a shift from traditional industries to sustainable practices, particularly in waste management.

Here’s how the process works: Waste Collection and Sorting: Singapore has an efficient waste collection system where trash is collected from households and businesses. Waste is then transported to one of the four Waste-to-Energy (WTE) plants, which are located at Tuas, Senoko, Tuas South, and Keppel Seghers Tuas. Incineration: At the WTE plants, waste is incinerated at high temperatures. This process significantly reduces the volume of waste by about 90%. The heat generated during incineration is used to produce steam. Energy Generation: The steam produced from the incineration process drives turbines to generate electricity. This electricity is then fed into the national grid, contributing to the country's energy supply. Environmental Controls: The incineration process is equipped with advanced pollution control systems to minimize emissions. Flue gases are treated to remove harmful substances before being released into the atmosphere. Resource Recovery: After incineration, the remaining ash is processed to recover metals which can be recycled. The remaining ash, which is non-hazardous, is transported to the Semakau Landfill, an offshore landfill that has been engineered to be environmentally friendly. Semakau Landfill: The Semakau Landfill is an innovative solution to Singapore's waste management challenges. It is designed to handle incineration ash and non-incinerable waste, and it also incorporates measures to protect the marine ecosystem. Sustainability Initiatives: Singapore is continually improving its waste management strategies, including increasing recycling rates and developing new technologies for waste treatment. Public awareness campaigns are also conducted to encourage recycling and reduce waste generation. By converting waste into energy, Singapore not only reduces the amount of waste that goes into landfills but also contributes to its energy supply, demonstrating a commitment to sustainability and efficient resource management. #Singapore #WasteManagement #WasteToEnergy #Sustainability #CleanEnergy #RenewableEnergy #EcoFriendly #GreenTechnology #Recycling #EnvironmentalProtection #CircularEconomy #Innovation #ZeroWaste #ClimateAction\n\n#Sustainable waste management: is now a necessity Public-private sector investment is desperately needed to ensure that Nigeria can modernise and acquire waste processing facilities to divert waste from landfill. Nigeria alone estimates its investment need in this critical infrastructure to be about $300 Million,in Nigeria “We are facing a crisis in waste management with fast diminishing landfill airspace, we all have a role to play in finding sustainable solutions that not only divert waste from l brings together with multiple stakeholders from the public and private sectors, we can collectively do to promote the circular economy of the country. We know that it cannot be business as usual.” Some key highlight worthy of instant recommendation Diversion from landfill is a key goal for the paper and paper packaging industry. Public and private sector partnership is critical to ensure that our collective vision of preserving the environment for current and future generations becomes a reality and that investment is made in the right programmes to facilitate education and awareness for all Nigerians. In addition, links between the industry and the academic institutions need to be strengthened so that research is focused on what the industry needs to design recyclable packaging. By the same token, there need to ensure that their integrated waste management plans enable separation at source which will promote the collection of recyclable materials. FCT Abuja and 36 States with their State capital need to ensure that consistent services are provided to all citizens in the collections value chain. Infrastructure is a key priority. public-private partnerships are possible, they have proved difficult to manage; alternatives models (such as build, operate and transfer) should be explored. The barriers to private investment need to be investigated thoroughly. Transition to a circular economy needs to include all members of the value chain. In particular, the informal waste pickers need to be integrated into the waste management system as it becomes more circular. Separation at source is critical. The cleaner the material, the more efficient the mills are in producing new products for the market. Given the various challenges at landfill sites, households have to be persuaded to separate their waste so that paper and packaging waste is not contaminated by food and other organic waste materials. Incentivisation is key. To drive the behaviour change required to promote separation at source, the industry needs to come up with ways to incentivise citizens to play their role particularly in underprivileged areas. Incentivisation will also make it more likely that waste pickers will collect more types of packaging waste, Government needs to ensure that compliance and enforcement is carried out to those organisations who choose to ignore their obligations as set out in the regulations. By-laws should also be used to promote separation at source.\n\n♻️ Chennai's Resilience in Waste Management Post-Cyclone Michaung ♻️ In the aftermath of Cyclone Michaung, Chennai has displayed remarkable resilience in managing its waste effectively.
