        "text": "Chittagong District\n\nChittagong With an area of 5282.98 sq km, is Bounded By Feni District and Tripura (Indian State) on The North, Cox’s Bazar District on The South, Bandarban, Rangamati & Khagrachhari Districts on the East and Noakhali District and the Bay of Bengal on the West. Chittagong District is Quite Different From other Districts for its Unique Natural Beauty Characterized By Hills, Rivers, Sea, Forests & Valleys. Annual Average Temperature Maximum 32.5°C, Minimum 13.5°C, Total Annual Rainfall 2687 mm. Main Rivers are Karnaphuli, Halda and Sangu.\n\nChittagong (Town) Consists of Six Thanas, 68 Wards & 236 Mahallas. It has an Area of 209.66 sq km. The Town has a Population 3202710; Male 54.36% and Female 45.64%; Population Density per sq km 15276. The Main Seaport of Bangladesh is Located at the Estuary of the Karnaphuli River. Chittagong is also Called the Commercial Capital of Bangladesh. Interesting Places of the City Include Batali Hill (87.5 m in height), War Cemetery, Patenga Sea Beach, Foy's Lake, etc. The First Export Processing Zone (1983) EPZ of Bangladesh is Situated here. Chittagong Municipal Committee was Established in 1860. At Present, It Has Been Turned Into Chittagong City Corporation.\n\nAdministration Chittagong District was Established in 1666 Including 3 Hill Districts. The District of Chittagong Hill Tracts was Established in 1860 with the Hill Region of the District. Later, Chittagong District was Further Divided into Chittagong & Cox's Bazar Districts. The District Consists of one City Corporation, Seven Municipalities, Six Thanas, 20 Upazilas, 197 Union Parishads and 1,319 Villages. The Upazilas are Anwara, Banshkhali, Boalkhali, Chandanaish, Fatikchhari, Hathazari, Lohagara, Mirsharai, Patiya, Rangunia, Raozan, Sandwip, Satkania and Sitakunda. The Thanas are Chandgaon, Bandar thana (Chittagong Port) , Double Mooring, Kotwali, Pahartali, Panchlaish and Hathazari.\n\nArchaeological Heritage and Relics Bronze Statues (8th and 9th Centuries, in Anwara Upazila), Fakira Mosque (Hathazari), Musa Khan Mosque (1658), Kura Katni Mosque (1806), Kala Mosque (16th century), Chhuti Khan Mosque (Mirsharai), Kadam Mobarak Mosque (1719), Andre Kiblah Mosque, Wali Khan Mosque (1790), Badar Awlia Dargah, Bakshi Hamid Mosque of Banshkhali (1568), Chittagong Court Building (1893), Collegiate School, Ethnological Museum (1974).\n\nHistorical Events Historians are of Different Opinions as Regards the Nomenclature of Chittagong This Area Once in The Past Had Been Earmarked for Fighting Spot. They Say a Muslim Sultan Sometimes During 8th Century Had Founded an Independent State. In 953 The King of Arakan, While Passing Beside the Area, was Compelled to Sign a Treaty of Peace With The Sultan. Present Patenga Had Been Familiar as “Fategaon” in Other Words. “Place of Victory” In Olden Days.\"Chit-ta-gong”, an Arakan Word, Meaning “Fighting is Unjustified” was Written in the Local Memory Column. It is Thought that the Word “Chittagong” is the Changed Form of the Word \"Chit-ta-gong”.\n\nOn The Other Hand, The Buddhists Opine That Chittagong Originated From the Residential Spot of \"Chita Keyang\" in Their Glory Column, as Per Opinion of Sir William Goans Chittagong Has Been Named After The Tiny Bird “Chatga”. The History of Chittagong Dates Back to Ancient Times of Pre-Historic era. Although the Political Status of Chittagong in Pre-Historic Time is Rather Sketchy But the Periplus of the Erythrean Sea Documents a Vivid Picture of this City.\n\nThe Yemeni and The Arab Traders Used to Trade With Chittagong. Tolemi, the Famous Historian, Described Chittagong as the Finest Port in the Near and the Far East While the Great Malayan History Claims Chittagong’s Link with Malay in the 4th Century B.C. Fahien, Hieu-en Tsan, lbn Batuta, all Portrayed Chittagong as Mingled with the Ancient Civilization of the World Chinese, Turkish, Arab and European Traders Used to Trade with this Part of the World Through Chittagong.\n\nChittagong Derived its Name from the Arabic Word Shetgang Delta of the Ganges, Whilst Muslim Traders During the 9th Century, Using Chittagong as their Base Port, Named it as ‘Samunda’. In 1528 A.D. Portuguese Sailors Rightly Pointed out the Port City as ‘Porte Grande’. From the Above Delineation, it is Crystal Clear that From the Very Ancient Period Chittagong Has Been Regarded as one of the Most Lucrative Places to the World Business Community for its Abundance in Natu­ral Resources and Strategically Advantageous Geographical Location. It is Worth Mentioning that in 1818 Wooden Warship was Built and Exported From Chittagong to German Naval Fleet.\n\nMarks of the War of Liberation Mass Graves and Mass Killing Sites: Foy's Lake, Lalkhan Bazar, Hills Area Adjacent to Firoz Shah Colony, Kattoli Beach, CRB Area, Hills on the East of Sher Shah Colony, Patenga Air Port, Hills Around Nasirabad Residential Area and Many other Places.\n\nReligious Institutions Mosque 7140, Tomb 220, Temple 1,206, Church 8 and Sacred Place 1 the Most Noted of Which are Chuti Khan Mosque, Daulat Bibir Mosque, Mahadia Mosque, Noi Duari Mosque, Hamidullah Khan Mosque, Tomb of Shah Jadeh (R), Three Domed Khan Mosque (Dohazari and Baghica Hat), Tombs of Hazrat Shah Amanat (R), Hazrat Bayazid Bostami (R), Mohsen Awlia, Goribullah Shah (R), Hajrat Shah Pir Awlia, Baro Awlia (Sitakunda), Miskin (R), Akbaria Jami Mosque, Nasrat Shah Jami Mosque, Jagannath Mandir (Abu Torab Bazar), World Peace Pagoda (Hathazari), Sitakunda Shankar Math, Dharmo Chakro Buddho Vihara, Koriya Nagar & Sonakania Buddho Viharas, Chandranath Temple Hill, etc.\n\nPopulation 6545078; Male 52.16%, Female 47.84%; Muslim 83.92%, Hindu 13.76%; Buddhist 2.01%, Christian 0.11% and others 0.2%.\n\nLiteracy and Educational Institutions Average Literacy 43.2%; Male 50.3%, Female 35%.
