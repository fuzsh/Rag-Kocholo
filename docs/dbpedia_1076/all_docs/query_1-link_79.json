        "text": "Jeremy Piven was born on July 26, 1965, in Manhattan, New York. With a strong theatrical background rooted in his family, it was no surprise when Piven decided to pursue a career in acting. His parents, Byrne Piven and Joyce Hiller Piven, were both revered actors and drama teachers who founded the Piven Theatre Workshop. This dynamic environment cultivated Piven's passion for acting from an early age, and he later attended Drake University in Iowa before transferring to New York University. After completing his studies, he honed his skills at the renowned National Theater Institute. Piven's career trajectory is a testament to his relentless determination and artistic prowess. He started his journey in Hollywood with minor roles in several high-profile films, such as Say Anything and The Player. However, it was his role as Ari Gold in the popular television series Entourage that catapulted him into the limelight. His portrayal of the fast-talking, power-hungry Hollywood agent won him three consecutive Emmy Awards and a Golden Globe. In addition to his success on the small screen, Piven has also made a significant impact on stage, notably starring in Neil LaBute's Fat Pig and David Mamet's Speed-the-Plow. Despite his undeniable success in film and television, Piven continues to explore different facets of his artistic expression. He ventured into voice acting, lending his voice to characters in animated films like Cars and The Pirates! Band of Misfits. Furthermore, he delved into the world of production, producing and starring in Mr. Selfridge, a historical drama series set in London. Piven's versatility and dedication to his craft solidify his position as one of the most respected figures in the entertainment industry, proving that he is not just a master of his craft, but an artist constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities.\n\nStephen Valentine Patrick William Allen (December 26, 1921 â€“ October 30, 2000) was an American television personality, radio personality, musician, composer, actor, comedian, writer, and advocate of scientific skepticism. In 1954, he achieved national fame as the co-creator and first host of The Tonight Show, which was the first late night television talk show. Though he got his start in radio, Allen is best known for his extensive network television career. He gained national attention as a guest host on Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts. After he hosted The Tonight Show, he went on to host numerous game and variety shows, including his own The Steve Allen Show, I've Got a Secret, and The New Steve Allen Show. He was a regular panel member on CBS's What's My Line?, and from 1977 until 1981 wrote, produced, and hosted the award-winning public broadcasting show Meeting of Minds, a series of historical dramas presented in a talk format. Allen was a pianist and a prolific composer. By his own estimate, he wrote more than 8,500 songs, some of which were recorded by numerous leading singers. Working as a lyricist, Allen won the 1964 Grammy Award for Best Original Jazz Composition. He also wrote more than 50 books, including novels, children's books, and books of opinions, including his final book, Vulgarians at the Gate: Trash TV and Raunch Radio (2001). In 1996 Allen was presented with the Martin Gardner Lifetime Achievement Award from the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSICOP). He has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and a Hollywood theater named in his honor."
