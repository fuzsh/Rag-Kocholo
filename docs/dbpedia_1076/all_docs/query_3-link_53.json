This editorial discusses the importance of learning from mistakes and avoiding repeating errors. It argues that Ethiopian politics is troubled by forces that keep making the same mistakes they have made for decades. Specifically, it criticizes the Oromo Liberation Front for undermining stability through violent acts and political folly, rather than engaging in civil dialogue to resolve disputes through legal mechanisms. The editorial warns that resorting to violence will only exacerbate problems and calls on the OLF leadership to clarify their intentions and be part of achieving peace.",
