To determine these things, SWIPCO will be doing a telephone income survey, a housing assessment survey, and soliciting pre-applications.\n\nThe income survey is conducted by phone by SWIPCO staff and consists of two questions regarding the number of residents in the household and whether the household income falls above or below a certain amount. No names will be used and all the information collected is strictly confidential.\n\nThe housing assessment survey is a brief survey to determine the community’s current and future housing needs. The survey is currently available online at https://tinyurl.com/HarlanHousing. Paper copies of the survey can be found at city hall, the library and at the chamber office.\n\n\"Public participation is a critical component of the housing assessment and application process. The survey allows residents to inform the city of what they feel the most pressing needs are, what they would like to see happen, and goals to work toward,” said SWIPCO Lead Planner Alexis Fleener. Any homeowners interested in participating in the CDBG home rehabilitation program are strongly encouraged to submit a pre-application. Pre-applications are available at city hall (712-755-5137) or through SWIPCO (866-279-4720 ext. 234).

He borrowed $200 from his mother to start Camblin’s as he saw a need for plumbing service and repair. As the company grew, his son Wayne Camblin came home from Simpson College in 1928 to help with the business. As the years past, the business continued to grow and in 1966 Bob Camblin joined in the company as a third generation after a stint in the U. S. Navy.\n\nCamblin Plumbing and Heating continued to grow and in 1997 was split into 2 companies. Camblin Mechanical was formed to continue the big mechanical projects like schools and hospitals, and Camblin Plumbing and Heating continued as a residential and light commercial plumbing and heating service provider.\n\nThe things that keep Camblin Plumbing and Heating and Camblin Mechanical a success after 100 years include a loyal customer base, a tradition of quality service and installation, our location between Omaha and Des Moines and the fact that the area schools have given us some very hard working and knowledgeable employees over the years.\n\nJune 2018 - A windfall for Iowa ... proposal has been submitted to state officials.\n\nMidAmerican Energy plan to expand wind energy would be a win for Iowa, consumers.\n\nThough the project has yet to be approved by state officials, an Iowa-based utility on Wednesday submitted plans for a massive wind turbine project that would be the nation’s first investor-owned electric utility to generate 100 percent of its customer demand from wind energy. Des Moines-based MidAmerican Energy wants to build a $922 million wind farm that would generate 591 megawatts of power, enough electricity to power 2.4 million homes—all without adding additional pollutants to an already-polluted atmosphere.\n\nMidAmerican CEO Adam Wright said that if the Iowa Utilities Board approves the project, the farm would be completed by 2020, before federal tax breaks helping such projects are phased out.\n\nEnvironmentally-conscious technology companies including Microsoft, Apple, Google and Facebook have built several data centers and other facilities in Iowa in recent years, all citing the state’s wind energy advantage.\n\nIn addition to the obvious economic development advantages offered to the state by wind energy, the financial advantages offered to MidAmerican customers are substantial. Wright noted that wind energy allows MidAmerican Energy to offer rates 37 percent lower than the national average because it doesn’t have to buy fuel like coal or natural gas. The proposal also carries good news for those concerned about the environment. When the proposed project is completed, MidAmerican’s carbon output would be 65 percent less than it was 15 years ago, he said.\n\nWright said about 51 percent of the company’s electricity came from wind in 2017, with the remaining production coming from coal, natural gas, nuclear and some purchased energy. By 2020, wind should account for more than 90 percent and is expected to reach 100 percent with the completion of the proposed wind project late that year. “For us, the time is right to keep moving forward while the landscape is favorable to do so,” Wright said.\n\n​​​​​​Excerpts Copyright © 2018 The Daily Nonpareil 06/01/2018 - See the Nonpareil for the complete story on page 4a.\n\nJune 2018 - Old Mill Razed\n\nPhoto by Caitlin Yamada\n\nHARLAN-- A large piece of Shelby County history was torn down Friday, June 15.

The owner, Dave Martin, who grew up in the house directly to the west of the building, said it has been used for storage for his construction company. When the railroad stopped using exchange Street and mills were moving to Kansas the Old Mill was shut down. Over the years it became a hazard but key pieces of this historic site have been saved. “It was getting in pretty bad repair,” Martin said, “we’ll eventually put a new shop out there.” Before the building was torn down, the cornerstones, dated 1898 were removed.\n\n(Photo by Ed Hendley)\n\n​​​​​Portions Copyright © 2018 The Tribune 06/19/2018 - See the Tribune for the complete story.\n\nJune 2018 Father's Day tradition - 73rd Annual Harlan flight breakfast Sunday\n\nHARLAN -- This Father’s Day, the Harlan Aviation 8-ball Club is hosting the 73rd annual Flight Breakfast at the airport.\n\nFrom 7:30-11 a.m. pancakes, eggs, and bacon, and drinks such as coffee, juice and milk will be offered.

Years later I’ve had people come up and say ‘you know you gave my my first airplane ride,’” Pash said.\n\nThe breakfast was started by a group of charter members that wanted to bring people together. “We had charter members of 8-Ball Aviation Club that fl ew and hung around the airport [that] thought it would be a great idea to invite other pilots to fl y in for a weekend type event and they would do the breakfast,” Pash said.\n\n“It was an original idea with that group and it has kind of caught on throughout the country.”\n\n​​​Copyright © 2018 The Tribune 06/14/2018\n\nJune 2018 - Big grant for Shelby County Trails Board received\n\nREGIONAL -- The Shelby County Trails Board's application for the Wellmark Foundation's Large Matching Assets to Community Health (MATCH) $100,000 Grant has been approved.\n\nThese funds will be used along with other funds to build a Ballpark to Ballpark trail along Highway 191 in western Shelby County. This Portsmouth to Panama trail will be a multi-use concrete trail that features covered bridges and public art.\n\nThe contingency to this grant is that the funds have to be matched 100 percent by the trails board, Trails group receives $100,000 grant; closer to goal which has been busy in recent years fund-raising for the project.\n\nBob Mortenson, president of the trails board, said they have until August 24 to match the funds and they are currently two thirds of the way there.\n\nMortenson said the good things about these funds is it is a \"cash up front\" grant, therefore, none of the funds have to be reimbursed.\n\nVarious fund-raisers throughout the rest of the summer will hopefully make up the rest of these funds, he said.\n\nThe Shelby County Trails recently hosted the Tour de Tivoli at Tivoli Fest in Elk Horn as a first fund-raiser of the summer. The funds from that event go towards the trails \"war vault\" and will be used for future projects. They also plan to have a fund-raising event with a band and food on July 22 in Panama at either the ball field or the church hall, depending on weather.\n\nFor future projects, they hope to create trails that connect to Harrison and Pottawattamie Counties' along with parts of Crawford County.\n\nLast year, Shelby County agreed to serve as the fiscal sponsor for grants received by the Shelby County Trails Committee.\n\n\"A journey of a thousand miles starts by putting one foot forward. When you're talking about a 10 foot chunk of concrete, that foot costs you about 50 bucks.

The plow was originally brought to Shelby County back in 1875 from Illinois by Michael Petsche. Making the plow unique is that it has a 30-inch bottom, much larger than typical for that time period. It’s expected that the plow is from the mid 1870s, and Petsche held on to it until 1940 when the farm was sold to the Ron Jensen family, who has had the plow until recently.\n\nThe plow sat in a barn on the Jensen farm three miles northwest of Harlan, and Jensen decided to donate the plow to the museum. With the help of local historian Ronald Chamberlain, Jensen and museum executive director Nate Buman (above L to R) put the plow in its final resting place.

With these grants, the foundation has distributed nearly $2.4 million in grants and scholarships during the last 20 years.\n\nExcerpt Copyright © 2017 The Tribune 11/28/2017\n\nNovember 2017 - Shelby County Trails Committee seeks project funding\n\nCOUNTY – Shelby County has agreed to serve as the fiscal sponsor for grants received by the Shelby County Trails Committee, should it be fortunate to receive the grant monies the committee is applying for during the next few months. The county’s board of supervisors unanimously approved the request by the committee for the county to serve as fiscal sponsor – specifically acting as a pass through for funding received and paying bills associated with any trails project in the future.\n\nBob Mortensen, president of the trails committee, said the committee is submitting a grant application to the Transportation Alternatives Program (TAP) that if approved would bring in up to $400,000 for trails projects in Shelby County. In addition, the committee will be submitting grant funding requests in the future to the federal and state recreation grant funds, as well as local funding agencies such as the Iowa West Foundation. To date the committee through fundraisers and donations has raised roughly $50,000 toward trails development in the county. The monies could be used as matching funds for any grants received in the future. “This is an ongoing effort,” Mortensen said. “Nationwide the average is five-eight years to get fundraising done and a trail project started. We actually are ahead of schedule.” The committee is in its third year of fundraising with such efforts as the annual Dad’s Waffle Breakfast and silent auction.\n\nInitial plans are to raise upwards of $3 million for the county’s first project, an off-road trail from Portsmouth to Panama along the Highway 191 right-of-way in western Shelby County. There’s a lot of bicycle traffic on that stretch of roadway already, and the trail would be highly utilized if constructed, Mortensen said. That trail also could link up with trails coming out of Pottawattamie and Harrison Counties, and possibly could link up with Iowa’s Lewis and Clark bike route from Hamburg in southern Iowa north to Sioux City. It’s 209 miles, and signage is being installed next year. A Shelby County trail could be a link to that effort, Mortensen said. Hopes are to get ​something started soon, even if it’s just demonstration trail sections leading in and out of each town, he added. Panama Transfer has offered to provide trailers to use as waterway crossings along the route, and also is providing an up to $20,000 donation match for funds raised by the end of this year. Mortensen said the committee is looking at lighting considerations inside the trailers, and is talking with local artists to possibly paint murals on the sides of the trailers depicting Shelby County scenes.\n\nPersons wishing to donate to the trails effort can send a check to:\n\nShelby County Trails Committee\n\nc/o Shelby County Conservation\n\nDirector Nick Preston, treausuer\n\n516 Maple Rd, Harlan, IA 51537\n\nCopyright © 2017 The Tribune 11/28/2017\n\nNovember 2017 - Shelby County Physical Therapy, Inc. opens in Harlan\n\nHarlan - Jeremy Arkfeld, MSPT, COMT has opened Shelby County Physical Therapy, Inc., and is treating patients in the newly remodeled office space at 2305 Chatburn Ave. in Harlan (SW corner of Hwys 59 & 44).

She said this program is especially designed to help families who are facing financial hardships and are unable to afford a Christmas dinner or new toys and warm clothing for their children.\n\nApplications for families wishing to be adopted will be accepted now until December 1.\n\nChildren 18 and under, along with elderly ages 65+, who are at or below 175% poverty level (or LIHEAP eligible) may apply.

These contributions are pooled together and used for families/individuals and are recorded in the newspaper as anonymous.\n\nThe adoption program is encouraging businesses and groups to adopt a family (or multiple families) rather than sponsor a toy drive.
