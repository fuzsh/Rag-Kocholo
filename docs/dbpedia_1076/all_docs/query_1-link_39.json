        "text": "BOYS BASKETBALL\n\nGulls 60, Hyaks 55\n\nRAYMOND — A second-half defensive stand by host Raymond allowed it to overcome North Beach’s slashing offense en route to a Pacific 2B League win on Saturday night.\n\nDevine Souvannavanh scored 15 of his team-high 25 points for the Gulls (1-0, 3-0), with Kason Koski adding 12 points and seven rebounds.\n\nTim Johnson led all scorers with 28 points for the Hyaks (2-2, 3-2), with Steven Sotomish adding 14 points.\n\n“It was one of those grind it out, back and forth games,” Raymond head coach Derek Rask said. “We struggled to get defensive stops in the first half. We did better in the third, which was a key quarter. Souvannavanh really stepped up in the third and fourth, which we needed.”\n\nRask also cited Johnson and Sotomish, of North Beach, for their overall games.\n\nToday, Raymond hosts Ilwaco. North Beach hosts Hoquiam on Saturday.\n\nN. Beach 10 14 11 20 — 55 Raymond 10 11 18 21 — 60\n\nNorth Beach (55) — You 3, Johnson 28, Turner 4, Sotomish 14, Washington 2, Robles 1, Gonzalez, Muro, Poplin 3. FG — 19-56 (.339).FT — 9-14.\n\nRaymond (60) — Phansisay 9, Koski 12, Anderson 10, Hubbard 2, Souvannavanh 25, Hamilton, Collins 2. FG — 21-62. (.339). FT — 14-20.\n\nWildcats 54, Indians 47\n\nSOUTH BEND — Ocosta pulled away in the fourth quarter to beat South Bend in a Pacific 2B League game Saturday at Koplitz Fieldhouse.\n\nOcosta’s Zach Allton led all scorers with 17 points, including some crucial baskets in the fourth quarter. Dereck Thomas added 12 points and eight rebounds for the Wildcats (1-2, 3-2).\n\nJuan Bucio had 15 points for South Bend, while Drew Rose contributed 14 points and nine rebounds. Jack Graves pulled down 10 rebounds for the Tribe, while Raul Mora also had nine boards.\n\nThe Wildcats led by only two before erupting for 21 points in the final stanza.\n\n“We executed and quit turning the ball over and we came up with a couple of clutch buckets at the end of the shot clock,” Ocosta coach Jason Quinby said. “They packed in the zone and forced us to shoot from the outside and we couldn’t buy a bucket. We needed better ball movement and more movement in general.”\n\nQuinby was pleased with his team’s defense. Allton came up with five steals.\n\n“We played really well defensively,” South Bend coach Manuel Rangel said. “That Allton kid is pretty tough. He got a couple of open looks toward the end and knocked them down.”\n\nSouth Bend (0-3, 0-4) travels to Chief Leschi today. Ocosta is home against Taholah on Wednesday.\n\nOcosta 10 16 7 21 — 54 S. Bend 7 17 7 16 — 47\n\nOcosta (54) — Bailey 7, Thomas 12, Allton 17, C. Hatton, Beck 2, Bjornsgard 6, Mitby 8, H. Hatton, Wardlow 2. FG —n/a.

FT — 11-20.\n\nJV — Ocosta won.\n\nFishermen 42, Vikings 39\n\nILWACO — Robert Woods scored 23 points as Ilwaco withstood a late Willapa Valley rally in a Pacific 2B League contest Saturday at Ilwaco.\n\nDown by eight following a couple of costly turnovers midway through the fourth quarter, the Vikings closed the gap on late 3-point baskets by Matt Pearson and Walker Oblad. A tying 3-point attempt at the buzzer missed.\n\nThe Vikings attained their objective of containing Ilwaco’s top three scorers, but were burned by Woods. Nevertheless, Valley coach Jay Pearson was very encouraged by his team’s improvement following a lopsided season-opening loss to Life Christian.\n\n“We’ve really been working on defense,” Pearson said. “We played excellent defense tonight and it kept us in the game.”\n\nOblad topped the Vikings with 13 points, one more than Pearson. The latter also grabbed five rebounds. Leo Ruelas led Willapa Valley rebounders with 10.\n\nThe Vikings (0-2) host Northwest Christian today.\n\nWillapa Valley 6 12 10 11 — 39 Ilwaco 5 17 7 13 — 42\n\nWillapa Valley (39) — M. Pearson 12, Oblad 13, Ashley 9, Flemetis 2, Ruelas 1, Hamilton 2. FG — 15-33 (.455). FT — 5-8.\n\nIlwaco (42) — Tapio 4, Woods 23, Kaino 4, T.E. Ramsey 3, Mendoza, Bannister 6, Glenn, Tynkila 2. FG — 16-51 (.314). FT — 7-8.\n\nJV — Ilwaco 40, Willapa Valley 28.\n\nGIRLS BASKETBALL\n\nGulls 50, Hyaks 33\n\nRAYMOND — Host Raymond used its pressure in the first half, along with a great start from Aubree Gardner, to run away from visiting North Beach in this Pacific 2B League matchup on Saturday evening.\n\nGardner led all scorers with 18 points, 10 of them coming in the first quarter, which saw the Gulls (2-0, 3-1) take a 21-9 lead. Reilly Moore scored 17 to lead the Hyaks (2-2, 3-2).\n\n“I thought Aubree had a great floor game today,” Raymond head coach Jason Koski said. “She was solid for us all night. We gave up some threes to North Beach to let them hang around, but the girls finished the game well in the final three minutes.”\n\nMikayla Collins added 11 points and 10 rebounds for a double-double and Winter Newman added seven rebounds and five steals for Raymond.\n\nOn Thursday, Raymond stays home to greet Ilwaco in a key league contest.\n\nN. Beach 9 8 12 4 — 33 Raymond 21 11 9 9 — 50\n\nNorth Beach (33) — Herbrand, Desamours, Moore 17, Avery 6, Vogler, Cox, McGehee, Garman 10. FG — 10-51 (.196).FT — 9-12.\n\nRaymond (50) — Williams 1, Mora 2, Collins 11, Harland, Aub. Gardner 18, Souvannavanh, Warnstadt, Newman 7, Flemetis 11. FG — 18-68 (.265).FT — 9-12.\n\nC.C. MENS BASKETBALL\n\nRiverhawks 76, Chokers 73\n\nEUGENE, Ore. — At halftime, Grays Harbor College held a 12-point lead and held a double-digit lead well into the second half, but couldn’t hold off Umpqua College in a championship semifinal loss in the Dale Bates Crossover Tournament on Saturday.\n\nThe Chokers (3-4) led 43-31 at the half and held leads of 11 and nine points in the second half. However, the Riverhawks soared in the second half to pick up the win.\n\n“We went in with a comfortable lead, but we didn’t have the same game plan in the second half as we did in the first half,” GHC head coach Alonzo Cole said. “We have to learn how to win.”\n\nTrevion Cotton led GHC with 16 points, with Jamari Thomas adding 13 points and Jared Jackson 12 points and 10 rebounds for a double-double. Tiki Hickle added 10 rebounds and three blocked shots.\n\nGrays Harbor College (73) — Jackson 12, Rowland, Robinson 8, Thomas 13, Cotton 16, Redmond 11, Hickle 2, Phillips 8, Hayes, Bean 3. FG — 27-69 (.391). FT — 11-18.\n\nUmpqua College (76) — Edison 6, Danhoff 16, Thompson 19, Ellison 19, Betts 7, Reno 7, Stephens, Lehrer 2, Gethers, Jordan, Maceley. FG — 31-79 (.392). FT — 6-12.\n\nHalftime: Grays Harbor College 43, Umpqua College 31.\n\nBOYS SWIMMING\n\nMark Morris Sprint Pentathlon\n\nLONGVIEW — Aberdeen locked in several district meet qualifying marks and came away with two top-five finishes during Saturday’s Mark Morris Sprint Pentathlon swimming meet.\n\nSenior Robby Lewis finished tied for 26th overall in the individual points rankings and took a fifth-place finish in the 100-yard butterfly. Junior Jared Durr finished fifth in the 500 free. Both fifth-place finishes were done in district qualifying time.\n\nAll told, the Bobcats finished with seven district qualifying marks — Lewis in the 100 fly and the 200 freestyle; Durr in the 500 free; Sage Bridges in the 100 fly and the 100 free; and, Conner Gates in the 100 backstroke and the 50 free.\n\n“Overall, it was a great meet,” AHS head coach Angie Durr said. “The newer swimmers continue to improve.”\n\nGates and Nick Newcomb were cited for their swims in the freestyle events.\n\nOn Saturday, Aberdeen will host its annual Alumni Meet at the YMCA of Grays Harbor.\n\n(Aberdeen results only)"
