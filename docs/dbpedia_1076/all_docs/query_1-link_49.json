        "text": "Allied aircrew shot down during World War II were incarcerated after interrogation in Air Force Prisoner of War camps run by the Luftwaffe. These camps were called Stalag Luft, short for Stammlager Luft which translates to Permanent Camps for Airmen. The German Luftwaffe, who were responsible for Air Force prisoners of war, maintained a degree of professional respect for fellow flyers, and the general attitude of the camp security officers and guards should not be confused with the SS or Gestapo.\n\nThe German guards were called \"Goons\" by the POWs. It was a nickname which puzzled them. When asked, the POWs told them that it stood for \"German Officer Or Non-com\"), which they believed for a long time and accepted, even at times referring to themselves as Goons. ( In fact the term \"goon\" was from a Disney character which is described as ridiculous looking with a prolific growth of hair on the legs. Their language was unintelligible and they were not credited with having much intelligence.) The tall sentry watch platforms with mounted searchlights and machine-guns were therefore called \"Goon Towers\". Annoying the guards was known as \"Goon Baiting\". When a guard was seen approaching an area the POWs would say \"Goon Up\" as a warning to their fellow POWs. The guards were known to shoot first and asked questions afterwards if any prisoner was rash enough to stray over the knee-high warning wire and then fail to surrender if challenged.\n\nThe German guards specializing in escape detection were known as 'Ferrets' and would enter the compound at any time and search any hut without warning. Often in the middle of the night they would enter, order the POWs out, and they would literally throw everything into a pile on the floor after searching it, leaving the room a huge mess. English-speaking ferrets would lie under the barracks in the crawl space and listen for careless talk. As a rule the POWs were aware of this tactic and were careful not to discuss important information.\n\nThere is evidence to suggest that when a tunnel was detected by the guards or ferrets, it was allowed to continue without intervention until it appeared to be near completion at which time they would stop it and collapse it. It is felt they allowed the tunneling to continue to keep the POWs occupied and busy and therefore not working on another escape that they did not know about.\n\nThe German personnel changed frequently during the existence of the camp. The officers, their positions, and the dates that they served are listed below:\n\nMy father, Willibald Karl Scherer, was born in Passau on July 13, 1892. He was born into a middle class family of conservative lawyers. His Protestant father moved from Passau to Munich to further his career. He graduated from the Wilhelmsgymnasium.\n\nHe joined the cavalry and later was an lookout for enemy planes during World War 1. Between the two world wars, he became involved with Freichor Epp, which was supposed to help with the emancipation of Munich from the communist revolutionary intellectuals and their followers. In WWII worked for the Air Force at an air base and at the end of 1942, was named Commander of the prison system for POWs at Stalag Luft 1. He, along with other officials, was relieved of this position at the end of 1944. A fellow Gestapo employee named Oppermann overheard comments made by my father about the current regime and collected that information along with things he observed and passed them on to higher officials. This led to my fathers dismissal. One blames my father for Anglophilismus and pro-Jewish behavior. I cant furnish details, but that was the tone of the complaint. The process was to take place in Stettin (name of a town, I think), but then dragged out for weeks, until the jurisdiction for processing the complaint was passed on to Berlin. The war ended before the process could be completed. So my father survived. In February 1946, he emerged from a British POW camp and as he entered our home he threw an old vase to the floor. That was not a good omen. As a former officer he could not find work immediately after the war. During this time, my mother, well-known in the region as a portrait and landscape artist, supported our family. This was a bitter pill for my father to swallow and his pride was hurt. During the time that my parents were separated by the war, they wrote each other loving letters, sometimes 3 letters a day, and sometimes they even spoke to each other on the telephone. As I sorted through the thousands of letters, I often wondered how, with all of his daily activities and responsibilities, my father found the time to write so many letters. When my father returned from the war, the relationship between my parents deteriorated. There were loud fights every day. A terrible memory.\n\nMy father was married twice. After the war, my fathers son, Hermann, from his first marriage moved with his mother to America. Hermann later returned to Germany as an American Occupation soldier and met his future wife in Berlin. After his military career, he worked for a computer company in Florida, that developed test simulators for the U.S. army. Hermann Scherer, my half brother died at the young age of 49. He was survived by a daughter and a son who served during the Gulf War. In the meantime, there is a large group of Scherers who have all become American citizens.\n\nIn his second marriage, my father married his second cousin, Marie Luise, who had the same last name as my father. That made the formalities of a civil marriage much easier. Marie Luise Scherer studied art in Dresden and Leipzig. An exchange of letters with people from this region continued long after the conclusion of the war with those who survived the war.\n\nI was born in 1942, a few months before my father took over as head of the prison camp in Barth. I have virtually no memories of my father from WWII, since I was too young. Today, if I recall memories of my father from after the war, I see him buried behind a mountain of books: mostly history books, but also fiction and art books. I also remember that he liked to take long walks along the Donau River or hikes through the mountains of Tirol. His greatest love was music and if he had been a civilian, he would have wanted to be a conductor. He played the violin, viola, cello, piano. He had a great ear for music and could play sheet music without prior practice. After the war, my father was 54, so a musical career was no longer possible. Later, as my father was able to find work again, he was happy to become the administrator for Lotto (a national lottery). Later he became responsible for all lottery outlets in the region of Straubing. Even during the war, he was able to answer his musical yearnings. For example, in Barth he, other acquaintances and Pastor Just formed a small chamber music group. Even after the war, back in Straubing and Lower Bavariy, he continued with his chamber music and played everything from Hayden to Mozart to Bartok. His remaining group of friends was very middle class. My mother was more outgoing and she had an incredibly large circle of friends and acquaintances.\n\nFrom the letters my father wrote to my mother while he was Commander of Stalag Luft 1, it was clear that he tried hard to run a correct and humane camp and that he was concerned for the fate of the prisoners. I also have this impression from letters written by ex-POWs, for which I am very grateful. However, I also gathered from these letters that the generally good treatment of the prisoners in Stalag Luft 1 was the wish of those higher in command. One should keep the prisoners of war in a good mood, because one would hope that ultimately they would be allies in the war against the much-hated Bolsheviks.\n\nThe letters from my father while he was in Barth were all written in the same manner.\n\nThe weather had direct consequences on the well-being of my father and the situation in the camp. There was also the mention of specific occasions, for example, visits to the camp by police or trips to visit friends in Barth.\n\nThe suggestions and instructions to my mother, encompassed all areas of life. Always a loving closure rule. This was how just about every letter was structured.\n\nAs an example, here follows a typical letter from my father to my mother:\n\n3/2/44 in the evening (On the average, my father and mother wrote up to three letters to each other every day)\n\nDearest Ise!\n\nAbout the weather; yes, that was a terrible disaster.\n\nThe first spring temperatures, tempting you to go outside and work in the garden, and now, after two days, this abrupt weather change! For 24 hours the storm direction has changed from south to west and now a blizzard shaking and howling through the area, and so we are aghast and disgusted about it. Under such circumstances, watching the POWs, in fact, is not possible any longer! Good weather for an escape; will the headcount be correct tomorrow? Within the next two days 300 American officers will arrive simultaneously! This will be a hard job, especially for the assistant to v.Miller, who has to take charge\n\n(of the newly arriving prisoners). Yesterday evening a tunnel was discovered, which was already complete to the fence. The guys had poured the scooped out sand into the toilets and sinks and then strongly complained that the new sewage system did not work properly! Now those gentlemen have to do the cleaning up themselves under the supervision of the German workers.\n\nToday you can hardly remain in the rooms facing the west. The whole day long I sat in my office wearing the coat to my raingear. My feet feel like icicles, and I will be glad to get in my bed. The curtains are dancing in the room, as if the windows were open!\n\nBut now my dearest, I want to thank you for two dear letters of the 26th and 27th, (and the nice van Gogh postcard) and the letter with the brown wool mending material. Today Else\n\n(a helper at Stalag Luft I ?) showed me a blue uniform shirt, that cannot be repaired. I will send it to you, if I get a chance, by post; pieces of it may be useful for making summer shirts for (son) Stephan; recently I had to present a shirt of the same quality in Straubing.\n\nHow are things with you? Again you report about being worn out, as you have done recently! So the symptoms of your illness have not yet been expelled from your body. Maybe you should try a mineral water cure at home? I wonder what doctor can give you the best advice and where you can get x- rayed? Hopefully you will get over this. Will Agnes\n\n(her older sister, resident of the city of Bremen, now there in Straubing visiting my mother) be leaving soon?\n\nNow about\n\n(her brother) Stephan: Hopefully you will receive official documents concerning him. Actually, he could be useful to me as a civilian translator. I'm trying hard to locate translators. Presently I have put in a request for 9 people such as he from the translator's school in Bonn-H (....?), where their school is located.\n\nThat Straubing, and the surrounding area, is fed up with the refugee situation, I can understand; even so it may be unlikely that people from Vienna will be evacuated that far.\n\nWe don't have any fears here and are living as if in the deepest peace. Our foot soldier have no idea how nice they have it here. What will our comrades in the east have to suffer right now! -\n\nVery soon now I shall retreat from this day and therefore close\n\n(this letter) with a heartfelt good night for you and (son) Stephan.\n\nWith deep love,\n\nYour's Willi\n\nPS. - Say \"Hello\" to Agnes as well"
