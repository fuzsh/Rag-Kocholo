        "text": "Jessica Guzman\n\nI have experienced personal stress, negative professional impact, financial burden, and inconvenience. Here is the timeline of events Ive experienced: R/O 9/20/14 promised and extra key and the rear headrests that were missing, the engine light was on and the tail gate would not close. On 9/20 - went for spare key, headrests, and engine light & was told the wait was 30 minutes, but waited over two hours to find: headrests were NEVER ordered & only spare key in stock will not program. While they turned the tailgate sensor and engine light off (Issue: Cylinder Misfire P0301), we still sat for over an hour and a half before they even looked at it. No apology, update or shred of customer service. I was told the keys and headrests would be available in a couple of weeks & no call. Early October - called to discuss the experience. No manager called back. I followed up again was told the manager (Tom M) had left. Asked to talk to another manager, was promised a call back by Shane before 5. He also left w/o calling. After escalating, another manager (Richard) called me back and told me that no headrests were ordered until we had come in on 9/20 and it takes two months to receive them. RO 10/17/14 Late September, the engine light came back on. It was on for several days, then off, then back on, then off. So in addition to having no keys, headrests, I am still having issues with the engine. I called, arranged an appointment, and dropped my Jeep off at Dishman Dodge. I asked them to do a full inspection and fix any issues. I told them I wanted an alignment and to check the vibration. I asked them to make sure the brakes were new. It was there for days, and received no update. I called. I was told there was an additional part needed to complete the repair (Issue: Cylinder Misfire P0301). I asked why no one called me. No answer or apology. I asked if the Jeep was safe to drive, and was told it was, so I told them to give me my vehicle rather than inconvenience me, and call me when this part arrives. 11/3-11/13 repair finally complete & told brakes are fine. R/O 12/3/14 the temperature issues began. The heat would not turn off. It just blew hot air at full blast. It was cold out, so at least it was heat coming out and not cold air but it certainly ate up a lot of gas. I had also noticed what sounded like air coming from my windshield. So - I did as I had before. I called, scheduled an appointment with this dealer that I have no faith in. They took my vehicle and a few days later, they said the temperature issues were fixed (caused by a battery drain) - and that sound I heard was the tires. Battery drain? Tires? Really? I had had the Jeep for almost four months, and it had been in the shop for almost half the time I had it and the only positive thing about my experience of purchasing this Jeep so far was the fact that it was covered under the original warranty and all the repairs were covered 100%. Just like Dishmans repairs, this was also short lived. R/O 4/2/15 It actually went three months with no issues, which felt pretty good. Just as I was hoping to put this nightmare behind me, the engine light is on AGAIN (Issue: P0456 evap system). I made the appointment - they fixed the issue or so they said. Dishman charged me a $100 deductible. They stated all repairs to my Jeep now fall under the extended warranty and I will be responsible for the deductible. Dishmans response: Its not our problem. R/O dated 7/3/15 In late June, the issue from December returned. Temperature controls would not shut off. I had hot air blowing at me in the summer. I find a local dealer Benoy Motors & provide all the paperwork received by Dishman for records. Benoy found the control head failed - another $100. R/O 11/5/15 - the engine light is on again. Another appointment, and a call to Dishman service to report. Dishman's reply: It's your problem. When I drop off the Jeep, I report vibration in the tires, noise from the windshield, auto-start not working in addition to the same issue form April (P0456) Again, something Dishman had claimed to fix results in another $100 deductible for something that should have been fixed and I already paid $100 deductible for just six months before. Additionally, the noise from the windshield is not the tires, but that the windshield requires sealing, a weight on the tires requires replacement ($40), and brakes are bad. Dishman service stated a year ago that the brakes were fine, they lied. R/O dated 03/21/16-On 3/8/16, the engine light came on again. It lasted for four days and then shut off. 3/15/16 - the Jeep started making a loud, grumbling sound. Several issues including: leaking water pump, loose belt tensioner, loose fan clutch, and faulty serpentine belt. I want peace of mind. I want to stop waiting for the next issue to occur. I am completely fed up. I want to ensure that Dishman Dodge takes my situation seriously.\n\nDocC03\n\nSecond vehicle we purchased. First one the service was good. First vehicle had major catastrophic mechanical failure on the way he from the dealer. Dishman towed it back and fixed it for free even though it was used. And this is the reason we came back. Second purchase was about 5 years after the first. What a different story.Salesman was so pushy and tried to strong arm us into a purchase. We don't buy vehicles on emotion. We but them because it makes sense financially. We tried to walk out after the salesman was being very meanAs soon as we hit the door his attitude changed. Although his attitude changed he would not leave us alone to go over the vehicle in detail by ourselves and find what was wrong with it. In hindsight we should have made him leave us alone or left without buying.On the way home the radiator exploded spraying antifreeze everywhere. Also the gear in the distributor let go on the drive home and the rotor was smacking the cap causing a timing issue.Luckily being a mechanic I was able to get the vehicle home. I contacted the dealer and there was no offer to make it right. I put a new radiator in myself and also replaced the distributor. The total cost for parts was only about $185. But if you had to have this done at a repair shop it would have been about 7 hours of labor and about $265 in parts at retail cost for a total of $740ish. Now that we have driven an additional 14 miles after replacing the radiator and distributor it is apparent that the head gasket is also bad. I would of liked at least a ln apology for selling a vehicle that needs over $1500 in repairs before it even got home 54 miles. The only response I got was we will use this as a training issue.We will never be using dishman Dodge again.And as far as price. Do your research. Look at retail pricing on KBB and NADA. You will see that even after you negotiate several thousand dollars off the price you are still above retail. Do your research. Do not trust ANY dealer especially Dishman Dodge.\n\nKelli1231\n\nFirst of all do not waste your time with these shiesters. I have read similar reviews to mine wish I would've read before I went! I spoke to a salesperson named Sean V, over the phone. After much bantering back and forth for an entire day we finally agreed on a price on a vehicle and I told him I would be down the very next morning to purchase the vehicle. By the way the vehicle was overly priced in the first place, way over NADA. I called the morning of the appointment and let him know I was on my way, just making sure everything was still as we had discussed, he said yes, and I drove 3 hours to get there. When I arrived Sean informed me that someone else was interested in the vehicle I was buying and they were actually on a test drive in it as we speak. I then proceeded to tell him that we had already made the deal and I was ready to sign on he dotted line? He said he doubted the other couple would be able to purchase the vehicle as he heard they had a bankruptcy in the past 8 years (what?? He can't tell me that? I'm sure it's against all privacy policies?) anyway he had me wait in the waiting room with my 2 small children for 4 hours telling me the vehicle is still mine just had to wait it out?? The end result was the other people bought the car for the original price way over blue book and they wanted to sell it to them because I was paying less! Then they kept me there all day and told me they would \"make it up to me\" and sell me a different vehicle for a good price! I talked to a manager and asked if this is truly the way they think they should treat a customer who had an appointment and a promise to buy? He said \"yep, happens all the time!\" Very rude people, very dishonest, and I would not waste one second of your time going there. I left and went to Camp Chevrolet on Division, I worked with a salesperson named Gene. Totally different experience and a great one at that! Everyone at Camp was very professional and not pushy.\n\nMike2500\n\nI live in the Portland/Vancouver area and had been in contact with Dishman Dodge in Spokane, Wa. I had found a 2015 Dodge Ram 2500 with the options I was looking for and it was at this dealership in Spokane. I currently own a 2009 Dodge Ram 2500 which I was looking to trade in. I called them and dealt with a salesman over the phone. We agreed on a new purchase price and talked about a trade in value on my truck. I gave them the VIN, the condition and the aftermarket options that I had put on the truck. Prior to making the drive to Spokane (5 hrs), I confirmed that we were agreeing on a purchase price for the new truck and a trade in price (range) for my truck around 18K to 19K, understanding that they did need to look at it first. The salesman said \"I just spoke with my sales manager and YES, we will be around 18K to 19K for your truck.\" So, I started driving. I got 3 hrs into the drive and called again, to ensure that the truck was there for the price we agreed on, I did this because all of the local dealerships said that Dishman would bait me there and then once I was there and had driven 5 hrs, they would not have the truck. Amazingly, the salesman said that he did not have the truck and it had been sold out from under him this morning at 8am (when the opening on this day says 9am on the website). I was upset and stopped in Kennewick, Wa until we could figure this out. After a lot of back and forth, the salesman found a similar truck, so I continued the drive. Once there, I was presented with a trade in value of 14K for my truck. This made me furious. The so called \"Sales Manager\" said that the mechanic had checked it out and he presented me with a list of things wrong. On this list were parts that either I had replaced myself or had been replaced at a dealership under a DODGE recall. I called him out and told him that these things were not worn or broken; I KNEW THIS FOR A FACT!!. The sales manager would not budge. I told him to give me my keys and that I was leaving, he would not counter his offer. I asked to speak with the sales manager and he told me he was the manager, which I did not believe. I demanded that the mechanic come out and show me these broken parts that he had listed and he was too chicken xxxx to come out and explain his findings. I then demanded to speak with the GM, who I was again told was the guy that presented me the low balled trade in price. I said, \"OK, let me speak with the owner.....They shielded him from me and told me he was not here at the time; they would not even allow me to leave a voicemail with him. I was so furious that I was shaking! This business BAITED me into driving 5hrs (10 total now) with the agreement that certain numbers would be met; and they weren't. I had taken 10hrs off of work to drive here, spent money on travel, food and gas, now I had put approx. 700 additional miles on my truck. I asked for my keys and paperwork and left, shocked and upset!! Then, the sales person tried to keep my credit app with all of my information on it; seemingly to sell to some other company. I am a United States, Combat Arms Veteran, which this salesperson was well aware of. This is a very clear picture of how this company, not only treats their community partners, but also how they treat this country's servicemen and women. I then called ahead to a local dealer from back home and tried to have them secure this new truck and do a dealer trade. They called Dishman Dodge and attempted this, but Dishman told the m that the very truck they were asking for, had been wreck and driven into a pole....I had driven this truck 2hrs prior to this call with the salesman and my mother in law. They would not trade the vehicle because they knew it was me attempting to secure it. Clearly......Lying, Baiting and Avoidance is a pattern of practice here at Dishman Dodge because this very reputation preceded my contact here; I was warned of this very thing but went anyway. I had left a message with customer service days ago and no one has returned my call. This trip here cost me $700 - $1000 with missed work and trip expenses. In my opinion, I would avoid doing business with Dishman Dodge at all costs!!!\n\njazco\n\nThis month I bought a brand new 2014 Jeep Cherokee Overland from Dishman Dodge. Although, I have purchased a few new cars throughout my life this is the first time I have ever sat down to write a recommendation regarding a salesperson.My sales person was Cody Stewart who was the only person who contacted me while I was on line (and I looked into every dealer who sells new Jeeps within a 100 mile radius of my address). I was researching which vehicle I should buy, and getting and idea of how much I wanted to spend so I wasnt ready to talk to a sales associate at that point. However, from my first encounter with Cody I was impressed with his professional approach and immediately got the sense that he was attempting to assist me rather than simply pushing any ole SUV down my throat. Cody was very well prepared and took the time to ensure that I was getting exactly what I wanted. He consistently displayed a confident yet friendly demeanor throughout the entire process which made me feel great about my purchase. Codys actions were always consistent with his statements and he went the extra mile following up with me after the purchasing process regarding my questions/comments/concerns, and when I realized that I had forgotten a personal item in the car I had traded in, Cody made sure I got it back.In closing, this was one of the best car buying experiences that I have ever had and it can really be summed up to my individual experience with the companys salesperson Cody Stewart.\n\nJen S.\n\nWe recently made our second vehicle purchase at Dishman Dodge. We returned and went to them first because our first experience 6 years ago was a very positive one. I am happy to report that this experience was EVEN BETTER!! I went by myself to look without my husband and was treated very well. Sometimes I find that a women gets overlooked in the process or completely ignored but not here. My salesman was great, easy and not pushy at all. The car I wanted was priced below blue book value and I was given a very fair trade-in value for my old car. I was even able to negotiate some heated seats into the deal. I was happy at that point but what really impressed me was the follow up after the sale. I found that my new-used car did not have a few things like an owner's manual and the wireless headsets/remote for the DVD system. These are spendy items. I asked about them not really expecting any action given the deal that I got on the car but was pleasantly surprised at the quick action to get these items for me. I had them within 4 days. I also received a call from Gary to schedule my heated seat install the day after the sale. Everyone I met was so nice and courteous, I just can't say enough good things. Thank you to Speedy, Brian, Gary, Mark and numerous others for making this such a pleasant and easy experience. I would recommend Dishman Dodge to anyone.\n\nAlex\n\nI am going to be honest, when I first pulled on to the lot I was scared to death because we all know the salesman are going to come running up and try to sell us the first thing we look at. Well let me just say, I was quickly put at ease and rather surprised at what happened next. I was kindly welcomed to the dealership by a young man named Ryan with high energy and a smile. I was asked if I had ever been in or worked with anyone at the dealership before and I responded with a simple no. I was shown where all of the different cars were parked/sorted which made me feel a little more comfortable. I was asked what I was looking for and I didn't really know, I was just seeing what kind of options were available these days for new cars. Ryan quickly responded willing to take some time to show me some vehicles and to take them for a drive so I could get a chance to feel them out. I ended up looking at the new 2013 Dodge Darts. The positive attitude and excitement while explaining the car and how it could apply to my everyday needs made Ryan stand out from the rest. There was passion and I was put at ease. This wasn't just about a sale, it was about finding something that would help me in my everyday life. I was hooked. What can I say, I fell in love with the car, he made it so easy but also let the car sell itself with its simplicity and involving me while explaining simple operations. We got back from the test drive and I was invited inside for a cup of coffee and to get some more information. I was also then introduced to a man by the name of Richard who shook my hand and explained how the dealership was family owned and operated and gave me some insight on a little store history. The kind attitude I received from the staff and sales people made me say to myself \"I really want to do business here!\" Ryan came back with a book on the Darts and proceeded telling me a few more facts about them and then asked what it would take to earn my business. Little did Dishman Dodge know, from the starting point I knew I wanted to buy from them! I felt like instant family and the no sales pressure atmosphere really sealed the deal. I will definitely be back and I am hoping all of you go see Ryan Slate, he is a very kind and helpful young man with his head on straight! Thank you Dishman for the wonderful sales experience!\n\nTysonh13\n\nI came to Dishman Dodge looking for a used Minivan and was shown a decent selection of vans from 2008-2012 by Mr. Martin. He was very friendly and very informative. I returned to the lot with my wife a few days later and we test drove a 2010 Grand Caravan SXT. My wife loved the color and all of the features, which Darin was well educated on, so we ended up purchasing the vehicle. Darin followed up with a call to see how we liked the new van. I told him that we loved the car but that the brakes were squeeking horribly. He told us to take it in to the service department and they would check it out for free. When I returned for my service appointment Darin was not working but Ronnie Jessup was quick to assist in providing me with a loaner car for the day while the van was being worked on. He was also very professional, friendly and informative. The service department turned my rotors to eliminate a good part of the squeek and they checke everything else out as well. All in all this was a very pleasant experince. I have had bad factory dealer experiences in the past but the staff at Dishman have shown me that you can recieve top notch sales and service at a factory dealer without any rudeness or condecending attitudes. You have a new customer for life I believe. I will be in for my quad cab pick-up in 4 or 5 years (once this van is paid off...).Thank you\n\nmdpayson\n\nOn 5-1-12 my Chrysler Sebring was taken into Dishman Service Center to determine the cause of front end squeaks and noises. The car spent 2 hours inside the shop. It was later admitted by the Service Manager that during that 2 hours nothing was done- the car had not been examined. I was given no definitive information. Had something been given me explaining what turned out to be the issue, I would have had it taken care of. I took it to Dishman because they are \"the local experts\". Two months later and less than an additional 1000 miles, I had just been driving on I-90 at 60MPH and five minutes later while driving downtown the left front wheel fell off due to a ball-joint failure. The ensuing towing bill and repair bill was $1659.36, and there still remains some body damage to address. Since the repair, the squeaks and noises have stopped, meaning had someone taken 15 minutes to pull off a wheel, the problem would have been obvious. Instead, they did nothing, and allowed me to take an unsafe car on the road jeopardizing my safety and that of people around me.Dishman was negligent in allowing the car to be released from their \"service\" center in that condition. Two hours was plenty of time to have determined the issue but they chose instead to do nothing. Having spoken with the Service Manager, I was told they bear no responsibility since they did nothing. I am pursuing the matter further through a small claims court filing.\n\ntanner1973\n\nI brought my 03 dodge disel in for service work on the transmission for a clunk that I was hearing they said the fluid needed to be changed i told them i had it changed 6000 miles ago. they still insisted that the fluid needed to be changed. they changed the fluid and said the transmision is fine but you need to hace the A/c fixed. So they fixed the A/c. The transmision was still clunking when I got it back so I brought it to a real transmission shop they heard the clunk when the transmission was shifting got it in and rebuilt the transmission under warranty something dishman couldn't seem to figure out but didn't mind charging me for the fluid change. Back to the A/C that worked great but when i had to use the heater it didn't work. I called set up a appointment brought it in they looked at it and said they don't deal wtih that and told me I needed to take it to another shop and I told them it was working when they changed the A/C so they said they would blow the lines out because i had a blockage they did that It took 2 days and then I got it back they said it was working fine. I got in it got it up to temp. and the heater was blowing cold air so I brought it back in and they scheduled another appointment to look at the heater. I brought it back for them to work on they found out they they had put a part on wrong and I got it back 5days later it had hot air but now the air isn't coming out of the vents but I don't really trust that they can ever get it fixed right I will have to take it somewhere else like the transmision and get it done right. Frustrated customer.\n\nwhip5209\n\n0 service this is to WARN anybody who thinks of doing your vehicle serviced here DO NOT DO IT IN THIS facility!!! Their work is not warranted and you are out of luck. We took our jeep liberty in for repair for faulty brakes on 6/27/11 a week later same problem. Well the service department offered half of what I paid $572.00 to do the works alright-- what does it say to you? And my jeep now needs a $2,400 repair bill for that.. I hope this helps.My wife wrote The above on google. Our Jeep broke down and had to be towed on a Saturday evening in Spokane. Dishman DID do the work in a timely fashion, but it was sloppy to say the least. Dishman claimed to have inspected our vehicle, but they didn't. They just treated the symptoms rather than search for the cause. Now my son and his girl friend are stuck in Tacoma one week later. Turns out the brake fluid is contaminated with oil and EVERYTHING in the system with rubber will have to be replaced. I'm not accusing Dishman of contaminating the system. But I am accusing Dishman's Service Department being contaminated with apathy.I didn't expect Dishman to pay the $2400, but I certainly expected them to refund the $572. I argued with the Service Manager, next step is the General Manager. I doubt if it's worth the call and irritation. Lousy place to do business. You have now been warned.\n\npaulsueb\n\nWhen I walk into a typical dealership,I always have my guard up. Dishman Dodge is not a typical dealership. I have never felt pressured, never felt I had to be defensive nor have I ever felt frustrated about getting the run-a-round. I actually feel at home. As we were beginning our quest for our latest purchase, I told the salemen when we walked into the showroom for the first time that we were not planning to buy right away. That didn't seem to matter, all the the staff with whom we spoke was friendly and helpful. On our second visit we met Marcus and narrowed down our choices by discussing features and options with him. The next visit Marcus wasn't there. but one of the salesmen let us drive with him in a Journey. The next two visits, Sue and I drove a Grand Caravan, a Durango and the Journey. This helped us to come to a final choice but finding one available was tough. Todd Tuflija spend more than an hour searching dealerships and discussing the different options we wanted. We were given permission to drive the Journey Lux over the lunch hour to show it to our adult children. (It had all the features we wanted but it wasn't the color we wanted.) Our children convinced us that we actually wouldn't like the color we were trying to find and that the Lux we had was ideal. We came back to the dealership and Marcus and the rest of the staff expedited our purchase so that we were able to take it home that same day. The price we paid was within the range we were hoping for and we even got several rebates that were unexpected from the finance office. A few days later on a Tuesday, we talked to Marcus and Rhonda about cardoor side protection. We hooked up with Matt in the accessories department and by Thursday the parts were installed. I enjoyed meeting Mike and happy to have the task in the body shop completed so quickly and professionally.\n\njeffifish\n\nI bought a 2007 Mega Cap truck at Dishman Dodge in Spokane Richard Van Norman was the sales person and John Ashworth was sales manager representing the truck as being in excellent condition which it wasn't. There were scratches on several areas of the truck, camper shell leaking around the front and there was a evidence that there was signs on the door from a septic service. When I asked to have the sign evidence taken off John said he would give me $200.00 and I could take care of it. I replied that I have no idea how much it would cost to have it done and I wouldn't accept any money just wanted it fixed. He then said he would give me $500.00 to get it repaired and once again I replied I don't want the money I want it repaired. John and I agreed to have an auto body shop in my area look at it and if the price was right he would pay for the repairs in my area, If the price was to high he would pay for my fuel (I live 120 miles from the dealership) and a rental car. The bid came in from the auto body repair shop at a price of $1033.00 we called Richard to tell him of the price which he replied that was too much and John wouldn't accept the bid I asked Richard to have John call the repair shop so he would know the extent of the repairs. One hour later John called and agreed to pay the $1033.00 for the repairs. The problem as you might see is I feel like I was being scammed by your sales people to accept the $200.00 to $500.00 amount which would of had me holding the balance to pay myself. They had this truck on the lot for about a month so I can't believe they never saw the outline of the door sign in all that time. I feel there should be a little honesty even in Auto Sales I was also wondering if this kind of sales practice is an acceptable way for selling cars?\n\nllaughlin\n\nWent to the lot and found a car I wanted to purchase. I thoroughly inspected the car and found the Driver Passenger window not working, No heat coming out of the floor vents in the front, the stereo had no power, and there was no lighter (wanted to make sure it worked to know electrical system was ok). The car also had not been detailed, and driving it off a lot at a dealership, I expected it would be. They ran the preliminary numbers and had a few issues working out details with the bank. I told them they needed to correct those issues and barring financing went through I would be back the next day. Got a call a couple of hours later. Your approved!That night I did a little more research and found out the Master Cylinder on that car had been recalled with a specific number. No problem, I thought I will just make sure I dont have that specific cylinder. Sure weren't off to a good start, but I was thinking this is a dealership. They are reputable it will all work out. NOT!!The next day I arrived, the dealership had only fixed a few of the problems I mentioned, turns out they didn't even investigate the power issue with the lighter. I brought my own charger and found out there was no power to the lighter. Now this could just be a fuse, but it could be the whole electrical system too. When I asked to have the cylinder checked, They completely denied any problem with the master cylinder, despite the fact I was able to show them paperwork it had. They kept pointing to a CarFax report. I showed them the paperwork. It was even noted on their site under the car details for heavens sakes. Lastly even though they knew I was coming in that day to take the car home, they had yet to detail the car. I could smell bologna and got ready to leave. At that time the floor Mgr came out and offered 1 year bumper to bumper warranty AT NO COST TO ME, to keep me from walking. With great hesitation I said ok.When I went in to sign the paperwork, the finance guy had no clue about the promise of bumper to bumper. He then revealed he was going to give me a 5 year warranty they had rolled into my payment!!!!! If you are buying a used car buyer beware, check everything, this was a real shady deal! I walked out of the deal, and taking my money to someone who i can depend on. My advice...stay away from this dealership."
