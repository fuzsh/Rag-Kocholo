Tom Harkin's chairmanship of the Senate Agriculture Committee lasted less than two years, but he left his mark on the nation's farm policy. FARM BILL: The committee's chief responsibility is to reauthorize agriculture and nutrition programs every few years, and the 1996 law expired this year. That meant that Democrats took over the Senate in the spring of 2001 just in time to shape a new bill passed earlier this year. FINGERPRINTS: Senate Democrats forced congressional Republicans and the White House to agree to increase crop subsidy rates .\n\nThe new law authorized creation of Harkin's pet Conservation Security Program. Under that program, farmers receive payments not for growing crops or idling land but for using environmentally friendly practices. FAILURE: Harkin's biggest defeat came in the summer of 2001, when he lost a battle with the White House over the size of an emergency assistance package for farmers.

Grassley will regain control of Finance and Ilarkin will keep significant power, a lobbyist says. By JANE NORMAN and PHILIP BRASHER REGISTER WASHINGTON BUREAU Washington, D.C Some say Iowa will make out well with the change in control of the U.S. Senate, maintaining Sea Tom Harkin will still have clout on implementation of the farm bill while Republican Sen. Charles Grassley regains control of the powerful Senate Finance Committee .\n\n\"Iowans this year really won big,\" said Ed Redfern, a lobbyist and former chief of staff to Grassley. Redfern said Harkin will retain significant power as a senior Appropriations Committee member and the top Democrat on agriculture, although he will no longer be ag chairman. The Republican takeover of the U.S. Senate on Tuesday means that action on such major issues as Medicare equity for Iowa, repeal of the estate tax and welfare reform will rest in Grassley's hands. It also means that the election was bittersweet for Harkin .\n\nHe won a fourth term despite the GOP victories nationwide, but must give up chairmanship of the Agriculture Committee, where he helped write a new farm bill this year that will funnel an estimated $1.7 billion in subsidies to Iowa annually. Grassley ascended to the chairmanship of the Senate Finance R-Texas, is chairman of the House Agriculture Committee. \"Clearly, Har kin's influence will be less than had Democrats retained control of the Senate,\" said Neil Harl, an agricultural economist at Iowa State University. Harkin spokeswoman Tricia Enright said the senator will make sure that the farm bill is implemented the way he intended. Southern farm interests, however, are strongly opposed to tightening limits on the subsidies that individual farmers can get and also have shown little interest in restricting the power of meat-packers and other agribusinesses as advocated by some Midwestern farmers .\n\nHarkin and other lawmakers pushed unsuccessfully for those provisions to limit corporate control of agriculture. The election results make it less likely that Congress will enact a $6 billion disaster-aid package that the Senate voted for in September. Farmers across much of the Plains and even parts of western Iowa lost crops and forage to a severe drought this summer. The White House opposed the aid package, and the measure turned out to be an issue this fall in only one campaign, the South Dakota Senate race. Harl sees the White House pushing for reductions in farm spending .\n\n\"I think the administration wants to rein in as much spending as possible in non-defense areas. They are uneasy about the deficit and they dont wantto be tarred with that in20O4,\" he said. Jetton 1 .4 7 Tom Harkin (D) Greg Ganske (R) Not yet decided 100 of precincts reporting Hi liw tin, VOTE DETAILS Other 2 a 2002 U.S. Senate Race 100 percent of precincts reporting 'Great Right Hope' heads to D.G. HOLLY McQUEENTHE REGISTER officials worried about Medicare to have a chairman's ear .\n\n\"When you're representing community hospitals, you want your guy to have the top slot,\" he said. \"When I was chairman the first time, and as ranking member, I worked with members on both sides of the aisle to advance common-sense initiatives,\" Grass-ley said in a prepared statement. \"That's in line with this committee's history, and I look forward to continuing the tradition.\" The power shift in the Senate will have some implications for farm policy. Sen. Thad Cochran, will replace Harkin as chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee and that means Southerners will lead both of the House and Senate committees that will oversee implementation of the new farm bill; Rep .\n\nLarry Combest, King's ascent was decided less on Tuesday than in June at a Republican nominating convention in Denisoa The convention was called after neither King nor any of his three GOP opponents wound up with the required 35 percent of the vote to win outright. King had trailed his three opponents in the fund-raising and was seen as a long shot, until Club for Growth, a Washington, D.C.,-based anti-tax group pumped $140,000 worth of advertising into the district. Many of the group's 9,000 members sent King contributions totaling $152,000, which went a long way to helping King win the nomination, said David Keating, Club for Growth's executive director. \"One thing that really appealed to us he didn't strike us as a get-along go-along legislator,\" Keating said. The group interviewed more than 100 candidates before endorsing 22 candidates this year, 17 of whom won election Tuesday .\n\nBut if Club for Growth likes King's positions, civil rights and immigration advocacy groups resist his social agenda. \"He's going to go to Congress and he's going to say he represents Iowa, but he's going to embarrass a lot of people,\" said Jesse Villalo-bos, program director for the National Conference for Community and Justice in Des Moines. \"But it's our own fault because we didn't speak out. There just wasn't enough critique and dissent.\" County Ganske Moore Harthan Harkin County Ganske Moore Harthan Harkin Adair 1,443 25 50 1,745 Jefferson 2,405 205 164 3,106 Adams 761 15 18 933 Johnson 12,211 356 955 24.826 Allamakee 2.330 40 82 2,461 Jones 3,073 72 100 3,957 Appanoose 2,102 35 40 2,589 Keokuk 1,851 21 15 1,970 Audubon 1,128 18 17 1,361 Kossuth 3,220 68 100 4,172 Benton 4,010 77 97 4,864 Lee 4,654 300 146 8,033 Black Hawk 16,428 297 474 24,111 Linn 30,339 692 753 41,092 Boone 3,829 81 99 5,867 Louisa 1,549 48 49 1,771 Bremer 3,950 43 96 4,296 Lucas 1,399 38 19 1,700 Buchanan 2,822 44 86 4,266 Lyon 2,928 10 28 1,267 Buena Vista 2,772 45 53 3,022 Madison 2,769 46 43 2,944 Butler 2,472 35 58 2,265 Mahaska 3,959 41 39 3,076 Calhoun 1,900 43 44 2,038 Marion 5,787 63 59 5,414 Carroll 3,303 61 69 3,987 Marshall 6,024 92 132 7,867 Cass 3,037 24 38 2,297 Mills 2,599 36 36 1,543 Cedar 2,889 62 77 3,412 Mitchell 1,579 44 50 2,010 Cerro Gordo 6,276 168 326 9,337 Monona 1,485 57 58 1,871 Cherokee 2,196 38 84 2,504 Monroe 2,102 35 40 2,589 Chickasaw 1,912 20 59 3,018 Montgomery 2,210 29 38 1,228 Clarke 1,378 48 41 2,248 Muscatine 4,955 117 135 5,914 Clay 2,742 48 60 2,807 O'Brien 3,255 28 43 1,932 Clayton 2,877 59 109 3,847 Osceola 1,440 17 32 782 Clinton 6,293 147 143 9,423 Page 3,113 26 33 1,777 Crawford 2,281 19 28 2,268 Palo Alto 1,415 18 100 2,003 Dallas 7,945 130 133 8,130 Plymouth 3,057 60 73 2,541 Davis 1,269 30 30 1,707 Pocahontas 1,434 43 39 1,574 Decatur 1,221 44 30 1,618 Polk 59,519 930 1169 78,308 Delaware 3,094 47 29 3,086 Pottawattamie 13,476 184 247 11,685 Des Moines 5,653 187 163 9,049 Poweshiek 2,889 62 75 3,589 Dickinson 3,122 59 64 3,383 Ringgold 860 20 11 1,287 Dubuque 12,279 210 374 19,216 Sac 1,764 39 31 1,951 Emmet 1,393 35 42 1,854 Scott 22,280 425 558 28,742 Fayette 3,328 37 64 4,224 Shelby 2,804 29 42 1,935 Floyd 2,116 52 96 3,165 Sioux 9,003 19 41 2,095 Franklin 1,897 61 42 2,081 Story 11,458 289 362 16,193 Fremont 1,492 16 23 1,046 Tama 2,675 51 62 3,466 Greene 1,549 27 32 2,287 Taylor 1,167 24 18 1,375 Grundy 2,701 22 34 1,967 Union 1,862 50 40 2,460 Guthrie 1,897 36 27 2,336 Van Buren 1,381 50 26 1,320 Hamilton 2,725 64 60 3,258 Wapello 4,688 147 146 8,161 Hancock 2,008 46 67 2,017 Warren 6,786 112 143 9,100 Hardin 3,174 55 64 3,571 Washington 3,431 64 73 3,506 Harrison 2,699 38 52 2,125 Wayne 885 30 10 1,032 Henry 3,142 56 84 3,488 Webster 5,512 98 118 7,360 Howard 1.320 28 40 1,918 Winnebago 1.855 39 56 2,218 Humboldt 1,767 29 26 1,829 Winneshiek 3,279 61 140 3,886 Ida 1,249 19 45 1,299 Woodbury 10,733 338 273 10.763 Iowa 2,682 57 71 2.938 Worth 1,079 32 68 1,789 Jackson 2,522 44 69 3,740 Wright 2,221 18 32 2,253 Jasper 5,947 108 104 8,500 Totals 443,741 8,702 11,133 546,231 Committee in early 2001, but had to give it up later that year when Sen. James Jeffords left the GOP to become an independent allied with Democrats .\n\nThe committee wields enormous clout over tax and trade policy, pensions and Medicare, the nation's health insurance program for the elderly and disabled. Michael Abrams, executive vice president of the Iowa Medical Society, said he believes Grassley will quickly follow through on his vow to revamp a Medicare formula that gives Iowa health-care providers some of the lowest reimbursements in the nation. \"He is one of the most passionate people in Congress about wanting to fix the problem,\" said Abrams.

Carney, who dubbed King \"the Great Right Hope\" in an October 30 article for the National Review, wrote: \"While not afraid to buck his party's leadership when it is selling out to the left, King is sharp enough and prudent enough to pick his fights.\" Carney said Wednesday that \"King is a principled guy in the mold of Dick Armey and Tom DeLay.\" Armey is the retiring House Majority Leader and DeLay is the Majority Whip.

King vowed in June to \"move the political center in Washington to the right,\" by pushing to replace the federal income tax with a national sales tax and advance a social agenda that shuns creating protected classes of Americans. On Tuesday, voters in the overwhelmingly Republican 5th U.S. House District in western Iowa solidly endorsed the two-term state senator's agenda by electing him to the open seat with 63 percent of the vote over Council Bluffs Democrat Paul Shomshor .\n\n\"There's more opportunity to move Congress to the right now that the logjam is broken,\" King said Wednesday, referring to Republicans increasing their majority in the House Tuesday and regaining the majority in the Senate. \"The opportunities are both fiscal and social.\" National conservative groups refer to the 53-year-old excavation company owner as principled and hard-working, known for standing his ground, often on politically touchy subjects. Detractors say King's attempt in the Legislature to end multicultural education and work to make English Iowa's official language show an intolerance they say will ASSOCIATED PRESS These are the complete unofficial results from voting Tuesday for Iowa Legislature seats, with all precincts in every district reporting.
