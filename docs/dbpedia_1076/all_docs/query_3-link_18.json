Agency Executive Director David St. Pierre noted at a MWRD Board meeting on Thursday that the agency is on the verge of getting state permission to convert recycled waste into renewable resources, and then sell its product on the open market.\n\nIllinois SB 3056, sponsored by Sen. Daniel Biss (D-Evanston), has unanimously passed state House and Senate committees—and, according to MWRD state government liaison Kevin Fitzpatrick, is likely to pass the General Assembly this spring. Technological advancements now allow for biodegradable material from wastewater treatment plants to be converted into renewable resources including biogas, thermal energy and nutrients used as fertilizer, a practice that has proved to be controversial. State government mainly, but not entirely, dictates MWRD powers, and the legislation gives the agency authority to sell recovered or renewable energy resources.\n\nAssuming the state bill becomes law, Fitzpatrick says that MWRD will first initiate a project at the Calumet Water Reclamation Plant, the oldest of the agency’s seven wastewater treatment facilities. Fitzpatrick estimates that recycled waste from the Calumet plant “can generate about three megawatts of power, which is $2 million to $3 million per year.” Asked who would be interested in buying biogas, Fitzpatrick mentioned companies with government requirements or tax incentives to purchase renewable energy, offering multinational energy giant BP plc as an example. “BP is under federal direction to invest in renewable resources,” Fitzpatrick says. “Our biogas could be economically attractive to them because of the energy credit.” The renewable resource legislation has advanced while another state bill, HB 1551, which expands the agency’s bond and grant-making authority, languishes in the state House Rules Committee.\n\nMWRD officials voiced concern Thursday over their bonding powers after Moody’s lowered the city of Chicago’s credit rating one notch on Tuesday. Water District Treasurer Mary Ann Boyle said that if the city’s credit rating “deteriorates any further, that will most likely affect the district’s credit rating.” MWRD plans a bond sale in the upcoming months for their decades-long tunnel and reservoir construction plan, and is expected to issue around $100 million in debt. The agency is cautiously optimistic that the city’s rating woes will not hurt this specific commercial paper sale. “We believe bond market participants are aware of the pension funding challenges in the region and recognize the reform efforts that have been accomplished so far,” agency spokeswoman Allison Fore said on Friday.\n\n“MWRD to Add 4th Collection Site to Bi-Annual Unwanted Medicine Collection,” Village of Norridge News\n\nSummary: The MWRD recently announced there will be a fourth collection site among the MWRD’s facilities where the public can bring expired or unwanted medicine on the national “Take-Back” initiative on Saturday, April 26, 2014, 10:00 a.m. – 2:00 p.m. The MWRD recently added the collection site, Egan WRP (550 S. Meacham Road, Schaumburg, IL) to better accommodate residents in the northern part of Cook County. The MWRD’s other collection sites are: Stickney WRP (6001 W. Pershing Road, Cicero, IL); O’Brien WRP (3500 Howard Street, Skokie, IL); and Calumet WRP (400 E. 130th Street, Chicago).

On Thursday, the Cook County Watershed Management Ordinance went into effect after 10 years of work, quietly but thankfully. The new rules will go a long way toward keeping flooding and waterway pollution in the region from getting worse. The new rules also mean it’s time to step up other efforts to fix the stormwater problems we already have.\n\nAs the metropolis has grown, more and more land that once soaked up rainwater has been used for pavement or buildings. In Chicago, almost 60 percent of the land is covered. As a result, just an inch of rain in the city produces about 4 billion gallons of stormwater that has to go somewhere. Too often, it goes into our basements or causes a “Lake Michigan reversal,” when the locks separating the Chicago and Calumet rivers from Lake Michigan are opened, allowing combined stormwater and sewage to spill into the lake. You know, the same lake we swim in. And drink out of.\n\nNow, any new construction in Cook County will have to conform with regulations on drainage, detention, volume control, floodplain management, wetland and environment protection, soil erosion and sediment. Similar rules already were in place in the collar counties. That should keep new development from dumping more stormwater into sewers and waterways that can’t handle what we already have.\n\nBut we still have a legacy of older development that pipes stormwater directly into sewer systems, where it carries runoff into local waterways along with so much fertilizer and other pollutants that it actually contributes to the creation of a dead zone where the Mississippi River flows into the Gulf of Mexico. To address that, we need a combination of old-fashioned “gray” engineering — bigger pipes and bigger detention ponds — and “green” engineering — land uses such as forest preserves, floodplains and wetlands that absorb rainwater, as well as rain barrels, rain gardens, porous pavements, “green” roofs, tree boxes and anything else that capture rainwater instead of sending it into sewers.\n\nThe best-known gray engineering project is the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District’s Tunnel and Reservoir Plan, also called the Deep Tunnel, which began in 1972 and is supposed to be finished in 2029. TARP, which eventually will be able to store 20 billion gallons of water, will make a big difference, but it won’t be enough. In Chicago, green engineering got a boost last week when the city announced its $50 million Green Stormwater Infrastructure Strategy. The strategy calls for the Department of Water Management help make green infrastructure part of capital projects. In 2014, the department will spend $6.1 million on 39 projects to keep water out of sewers.\n\nMeanwhile, the MWRD plans to distribute 15,000 rain barrels over the next few years, pay for rain gardens at schools and implement other plans to let rainwater seep into the ground, where it can recharge aquifers instead of adding to flooding. On the federal level, Chicago recently received $1 million worth of Shoreline Cities grants from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for green infrastructure.\n\nWe’ve come a long way from where we were in the 1840s, when primitive handling of sewage caused thousands of deaths from cholera and diphtheria. But we have a long way to go. Last week was the best week for stormwater management the city has seen in a long time. We need more weeks like it.\n\nhttp://www.suntimes.com/opinions/27194358-474/watershed-management-ordinance-marks-good-week-for-those-sick-of-flooded-basements.html\n\n“Watershed Management Ordinance Marks Good Week for Those Sick of Flooded Basements,” Chicago Sun-Times (IL)\n\nSummary: As Cook County’s Watershed Management Ordinance took effect on May 1 and the week’s weather included lots of rainfall, an editorial notes the Chicago area’s effective methods of preventing flooding and waterway pollution. The editorial also urges a combination of “gray engineering”—such as the big pipes and detention ponds found in the MWRD’s Tunnel and Reservoir Plan (TARP)—and “green engineering” land use such as wetlands and porous pavements. The MWRD’s near-term green engineering plans include distribution of 15,000 rain barrels and funding for rain gardens at schools.\n\nhttp://www.suntimes.com/opinions/27194358-474/watershed-management-ordinance-marks-good-week-for-those-sick-of-flooded-basements.html\n\n“Lockport Lock, Dam Getting Major Overhaul,” Southtown Star (IL)\n\nSummary: A recent allocation of $12 million from the U.S. Congress will enable the Army Corps of Engineers to complete its upgrades on the 80-year-old Lockport Lock and Dam.

The area was built with a single sewer system that handles waste water and stormwater. During heavy storms the combined sewers can get overwhelmed, sending raw sewage into waterways. The Tunnel and Reservoir Plan (TARP), commonly referred to as Deep Tunnel, is already providing benefits. The number of CSO events has been reduced by half since the TARP tunnels and Majewski Reservoir went online, preventing an estimated 85% of CSO pollution. The MWRD further expects CSOs to dramatically decrease when the Thornton Reservoir goes into service in 2015.\n\nhttp://www.nbcchicago.com/investigations/Recent-Rain-Inundated-Local-Sewer-Systems-259450691.html\n\n“Trustees OK Stormwater Planning Law,” Chicago Tribune (IL)\n\nSummary: Lawmakers at the Village of Wilmette agreed to adopt the Cook County Watershed Management Plan (WMP) ordinance.

To prevent CSOs from occurring, the MWRD, which manages Chicago’s wastewater, has spent $3.5 billion on TARP, the Tunnel and Reservoir Plan. The project allows rainwater to collect in underground reservoirs until water treatment plants can process the wastewater. Before parts of TARP were operational, nearly 100 CSOs occurred each year. The project has reduced that figure to 35 each year, and the MWRD hopes to lower the number to five per year.\n\nhttp://news.medill.northwestern.edu/chicago/news.aspx?id=230882\n\n“Channel Cats Stocked in Chicago River,” Heartland Outdoors (IL)\n\nSummary: On June 10 the IL Dept. of Natural Resources and Friends of the Chicago River will stock rivers in the Chicago area with 30,000 one-year-old catfish.

At a meeting Thursday, the MWRD Board agreed to advertise a $198.6 million contract for the Stickney plant, which sits on 570 acres of land in Cicero and processes wastewater for 2.38 million Cook County residents, per an MWRD estimate. MWRD wants a contractor to build new tanks and processors for storage and conversion of wastewater at the plant. According to MWRD spokeswoman Allison Fore, “ The new facilities at the Stickney Water Reclamation Plant will replace maintenance-intensive infrastructure which has been in service since 1928 with modern, efficient, nearly maintenance-free facilities.”\n\nThe contract specifically calls for building nine 160-foot diameter tanks accompanied by sludge and scum collection equipment. Additionally, the contractor must build six 132-foot long aeration tanks for removal of grit from water. MWRD is seeking other, smaller renovations at Stickney like new pump stations, vessels for odor control, airlift pumps for sludge, and dumpsters. Contract advertising is scheduled to officially begin July 9, and the agency expects four to six project bidders, Fore said. A contractor will be selected Oct. 16. MWRD would like contract work completed within 1,200 contract days, which pegs completion of the renovations for early 2018.\n\nIn other MWRD news: Commissioners authorized Thursday a 39-year agreement to lease a 9.9-acre parcel in Forest View to two companies. Main Channel Parcels and Tough Cut Concrete Services, Inc. will lease the parcels for $170,000. Board members and Executive Director David St. Pierre are currently reviewing the practice of leasing the parcel on a long-term basis. According to Fore, the board is developing a new land-use policy, but she added, “Until it is approved, the current policy will remain in place.”\n\nBefore wrapping up its spring legislative session, the Illinois General Assembly passed Senate Bill 3056, which permits MWRD to convert recycled waste into renewable resources and then sell the product on the open market. According to an interview in March with MWRD state government liaison Kevin Fitzpatrick, the agency is eyeing an initial project to convert recycled waste at the Calumet Water Reclamation Plant to biogas or thermal energy. Officials estimate the project could net the agency up to $3 million a year.\n\n“New County Hazard Plan Could Lead Fed Grants to Buy Flood-Prone Houses,” Glenview Announcements\n\nSummary: Glenview is one of the few suburbs that has a Federal Emergency Management Agency-approved Natural Hazard Mitigation Plan which has helped bring millions of FEMA dollars into the village for flood prevention.
