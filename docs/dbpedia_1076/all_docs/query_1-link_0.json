Corbett of Linn County as candidate for Speaker of the House of Representatives of the Seventy-seventh General Assembly, preceding such nomination with the following remarks: Thank you Mr. Speaker, Ladies and Gentlemen of the House. I will be placing in nomination the name of Representative Ron Corbett of Linn County. Ron Corbett is serving his sixth term in the Iowa House of Representatives. I first came to know Ron Corbett four years ago upon my election as a state representative from Scott County. It was a challenging time for the Legislature _ and for Iowa _ the state had a $408 million deficit. Ron Corbett was tabbed as House Appropriations Committee Chair and charged with the task of putting together a balanced budget _ a blueprint to assure that the needs of Iowans were met as we worked together to eliminate the budget deficit and achieve a sound financial base. Ron forged bipartisan support for a budget which set the wheels in motion toward the surplus we enjoy today and Iowa being rated by Financial World in 1996 as the sixth best managed state in the nation. Two years ago we elected Ron as Speaker of the House. He is a consensus builder _ a man of vision whose dedication to the State of Iowa and leadership has served us all well. It is an honor for me today to place into nomination the name of the Honorable Ron J. Corbett, State Representative from Linn County, as Speaker of the Seventy-seventh General Assembly. Heaton of Henry seconded the nomination of Ron J. Corbett for Speaker of the House, preceded by the following remarks: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, Ladies and Gentlemen of the House, family members and guests. Ron Corbett has served this body as a distinguished member for five terms, the last term as Speaker of the House. He has dedicated these past ten years of service toward the goal of making our state government more credible, more effective and fiscally responsible. He has succeeded on every count. Ron Corbett has truly been a \"man of the people.\" The district that he represents, the great city of Cedar Rapids and its surrounding communities, is made up of people whose roots run deep in traditional values, and who possess vision and a strong work ethic. Ron listens to their concerns and represents them well. Ron senses society's pressure on families. He knows the importance of education, and the importance of training and retraining our workforce. He recognizes the necessity to create opportunity within our state if we are to retain our youth and our future. The Seventy-seventh General Assembly faces many challenges _ that if met and successfully dealt with, will result in making Iowa a better place in which to live, work and raise a family. When Ron was given the opportunity to lead, he did not hesitate, but immediately took the initiative. Ron Corbett will continue to provide the leadership this body needs to pass sound, well-formed legislation that will address the challenges that stand before us. Ladies and gentlemen, it is with great pleasure I second the nomination of Ron Corbett for the office of Speaker of the House. Schrader of Marion seconded the nomination of Ron J. Corbett for Speaker of the House, preceded by the following remarks: Mr. Speaker, I wish to second the nomination of Ron Corbett of Linn County as Speaker. Two years ago Representative Corbett and I were elected as new leaders of our respective caucuses. During those two years as Speaker, Representative Corbett has demonstrated to all of us a deep respect for the legislative process and for the institution of the House. I appreciate his good judgement. It is my pleasure to second the nomination of Ron Corbett of Linn County as Speaker of the Iowa House. In accordance with the foregoing motion, the Acting Chief Clerk cast the votes of all the members of the House of Representatives for the Honorable Ron J. Corbett as Speaker of the House of Representatives of the Seventy-seventh General Assembly. The Honorable Ron J. Corbett of Linn County, having received all of the votes cast for the office of Speaker of the House of Representatives of the Seventy-seventh General Assembly, was declared duly elected to that office. Thomson of Linn moved that a committee of two be appointed to escort the Speaker to the chair. The motion prevailed and the following committee was appointed: Thomson of Linn and Churchill of Polk. PRESENTATION OF SPEAKER The Honorable Ron J. Corbett was escorted to the Speaker's station and, having been sworn, assumed the chair. Temporary Speaker Tyrrell of Iowa presented Speaker Corbett with the gavel and congratulated him on his unanimous election. Reverend Barrett held the Bible for the Speaker. Speaker Corbett thanked the House for the honor bestowed upon him and offered the following remarks: A brand new year, a brand new legislative session. What's nice about something new? It's fresh. The 1997 legislative session is fresh, but we are not starting from scratch. We have the accomplishments from previous years to build on, and the mistakes of the previous year to avoid. Today Iowa is doing well. Just look at our report card. We have one, if not the best, K-12 educational system in the country. We have a fiber-optic network and a new school technology program. We have one of the lowest dropout rates and one of the highest graduation rates. We have more roads per capita and we rank second or third in the number of bike trails. Our crime rate is one of the lowest in the nation and our air and water are clean. The recent report that rates states on several quality of life issues has a livability rating. We're number one. Iowa is the most livable state in the entire union. On top of that, our economy is strong, unemployment has been under the national average for four years and we have a record number of Iowans working. Our state finances have been rated as one of the best in America. Many economists are calling this the nirvana economy. But let's be realistic. It is easy to grow during a good economy. The challenges are to make the correct budget decisions during the good times and to maintain growth during slow or down times. We have met the first challenge. We must be prepared for the second. I am proud of Iowa's many favorable ratings and rankings. But there is one ranking that I am not proud of. In fact, I am ashamed of it. That ranking is our position among the highest tax states in America. This is what I see as our biggest challenge this year. Just as previous legislators made investments and decisions to help us move to the top in education and the environment, we have to make an investment into our economy and for our children. The recent census bureau report showed that other states around us over the years will be growing at twice our rate. I've been giving a lot of thought to that report and it is extremely puzzling. Remember, we are rated as the most livable state, we have a very low crime rate, better schools, the same climate as the states around us and yet they are growing faster. I have concluded as many of you have, that we have to reduce our high taxes. Our economy depends on it, and if we are going to reverse what I see as a dangerous growth trend, it is the only way. I hope as we work to lower taxes we do it with the goal of what's best for Iowa. There is a growing trend in politics that both political parties have used that divides people, promotes hatred and anger, and plays on people's emotions. This trend is extremely bothersome to me. As elected leaders of this state, I hope that we would not resort to this type of tactic. It does not serve a purpose and it is destructive. Let me be specific. When the floods hit Iowa back in 1993, I didn't see volunteers bagging sand in different lines. One line for those making $20,000 and one for those making $40,000. They were standing together, shoulder to shoulder, regardless of income level. This state was built by people working side by side for the good of Iowa, it wasn't built by pitting one Iowan against another. This year we have the opportunity to make an investment into and for the people of our state. An investment for better paying jobs and for our children. Let's do it with the same spirit upon which Iowa was built. The same spirit that allowed us to celebrate 150 years of statehood. As critical as tax cuts are, it is not the only issue this General Assembly needs to address. I am a conservative and I believe in lower taxes. But I know that the drive-by shootings in Des Moines, the methamphetamine bust in Pella, the dead baby found in a barn in Cedar County, the teenager that just had a baby in Sioux City _ these incidents are not taking place because our income tax rate is 9.98. They are social problems. And because they are social problems they are surrounded with controversy. People in general want to shy away from controversy, but the problems are real and so are the faces. Unfortunately, most of the faces are our children. Iowan's are concerned and parents are worried. Our moral standards and values have been lowered. We expect less of each other. And we tolerate behavior that none of us would think of doing ourselves. The line has not been blurred, it has been moved. It is time we start pushing back. Our children deserve schools without gangs, street corners without drugs and homes without violence. It is our responsibility to tackle Iowa's social problems. I hope we can do it with the same zest and determination with which we tackle tax cuts. Our childrens' future depends on it. I want to close with a quote I came across a few months ago _ \"It is time we stopped tolerating irresponsible behavior and started expecting some personal responsibility.\" I think it is time we stopped accepting high taxes and started giving the family budget more to spend on their kitchen tables. PERMANENT CHIEF CLERK Rants of Woodbury moved that Elizabeth A. Isaacson be elected permanent Chief Clerk of the House. The motion prevailed and Elizabeth A. Isaacson was declared elected permanent Chief Clerk. COMMITTEE TO NOTIFY THE GOVERNOR Martin of Scott moved that a committee of three be appointed to notify the Governor that the House was duly organized and ready to receive any communication that he may desire to transmit. The motion prevailed and the following committee was appointed: Martin of Scott, Chair; Dolecheck of Ringgold and Falck of Fayette. COMMITTEE TO NOTIFY THE SENATE Heaton of Henry moved that a committee of three be appointed to notify the Senate that the House was duly organized and ready to receive any communication that the Senate may desire to transmit. The motion prevailed and the following committee was appointed: Heaton of Henry, Chair; Hansen of Pottawattamie and Frevert of Palo Alto. ADOPTION OF HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 1 Siegrist of Pottawattamie asked and received unanimous consent for the immediate consideration of the following resolution and moved its adoption: 1 HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 1 2 By Siegrist and Schrader 3 Be It Resolved By The House Of Representatives, The 4 Senate Concurring, That a joint convention of the two 5 houses of the 1997 session of the Seventy-seventh 6 General Assembly be held on Tuesday, January 14, 1997, 7 at 10:00 a.m.; and 8 Be It Further Resolved, That Governor Terry E. Branstad 9 be invited to deliver his condition of the state and budget 10 message at this joint convention of the two houses of the 11 General Assembly, and that the Speaker of the House of 12 Representatives and the President of the Senate be designated 13 to extend the invitation to him. The motion prevailed and the resolution was adopted. ADOPTION OF HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 2 Siegrist of Pottawattamie asked and received unanimous consent for the immediate consideration of the following resolution and moved its adoption: 1 HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 2 2 By Siegrist and Schrader 3 Be It Resolved By The House Of Representatives, The 4 Senate Concurring, That a joint convention of the two 5 houses of the 1997 session of the Seventy-seventh 6 General Assembly be held on Wednesday, January 15, 1997, 7 at 10:00 a.m.; and 8 Be It Further Resolved, That Chief Justice McGiverin 9 be invited to present his message of the condition of 10 the judicial department at this convention, and recommend 11 such matters as the Chief Justice deems expedient, pursuant 12 to section 602.1207 of the Code. The motion prevailed and the resolution was adopted. IMMEDIATE MESSAGES Siegrist of Pottawattamie asked and received unanimous consent that the following resolutions be immediately messaged to the Senate: House Concurrent Resolutions 1 and 2. ELECTION OF SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE Kremer of Buchanan placed in nomination the Honorable Harold G. Van Maanen as candidate for Speaker pro tempore of the House of Representatives of the Seventy-seventh General Assembly, preceding his nomination with the following remarks: Thank you Mr. Speaker, and Ladies and Gentlemen of the House. I rise today to nominate a respected colleague for the position of Speaker pro tempore. This gentleman is beginning his 19th year of dedicated service in the Iowa House of Representatives. During this time he has served with distinction in performing the various duties required of a legislator. His quiet, thoughtful approach to difficult issues, and his careful analysis of complex situations has earned the respect of his colleagues. His dignified and evenhanded leadership was characteristic of his service as Minority Leader, Speaker of the House, and Speaker pro tempore. Ladies and gentlemen, it is now my privilege, and a very great honor to place in nomination for Speaker pro tempore, the name of the Honorable Harold G. Van Maanen. Klemme of Plymouth seconded the nomination of Representative Van Maanen as Speaker pro tempore of the House of Representatives, preceding his nomination with the following remarks: Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen of the House. I wish to second the nomination of the Honorable Harold Van Maanen of Marion County, for the office of Speaker pro tempore of the Iowa House of Representatives. Representative Van Maanen is a man of integrity and serves the people of Iowa with dedication and fairness. Mr. Van Maanen is always ready to listen to the other person's viewpoint and questions. Harold is a dedicated family man with a strong religious faith which has sustained him through good times and some very tough times. During the past four years, as I have watched and listened to Representative Van Maanen, it reminds me of a commercial that many of you may remember: When Representative Van Maanen speaks _ people listen. Harold commands respect and receives it. I believe we can all learn from what Representative Van Maanen has to say. It is with great honor and a privilege for me to second the nomination of the Honorable Harold Van Maanen as Speaker pro tempore of the Iowa House of Representatives. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Mertz of Kossuth seconded the nomination of Representative Van Maanen, preceding the nomination with the following remarks: Mr. Speaker, I wish to second the nomination of Harold Van Maanen of Marion County for the office of Speaker pro tempore. I have served with Harold for eight years, and I don't know of a more fair person who is always considerate of other people's feelings. I can't think of anyone who is more dedicated and deserving of the position of Speaker pro tempore. Mr. Speaker, I move that the Chief Clerk be directed to cast the votes of all the members of the House for the Honorable Harold Van Maanen of Marion County for Speaker pro tempore. In accordance with the foregoing motion, the Chief Clerk cast the votes of all the members of the House of Representatives for the Honorable Harold G. Van Maanen as Speaker pro tempore of the House of Representatives of the Seventy-seventh General Assembly. The Honorable Harold G. Van Maanen of Marion County, having received all of the votes cast for the office of Speaker pro tempore of the House of Representatives of the Seventy-seventh General Assembly, was declared duly elected to that office. Garman of Story moved that a committee of two be appointed to escort the Speaker pro tempore to the chair. The motion prevailed and the following committee was appointed: Garman of Story and Connors of Polk. Representative Van Maanen was escorted to the Speaker's station and, being duly sworn, offered the following remarks: Thank you for those kind remarks. You said them better than I ever could have. Thank you. I think we're off to a good start when you consider that I had two people of Irish descent escort a Dutchman to the Speaker's station. First of all, I want to welcome back all the incumbents who won re-election. Congratulations. And I want to extend a special welcome to the new members who are joining us as this family in the Iowa legislature. And it is a family. I want to extend to you as I've done in the past, a warm welcome, welcoming you to the process, a process that we all love, and I also want to extend to you the courtesy that if I can be of any help to any of you at any time, please don't hesitate to talk to me. Because perhaps I can learn more than what I can teach you. And I really mean that sincerely. I'll also say to the new members that during your orientation, if you were not informed that if you have a special event in your life during session, you are admonished to furnish cookies to the whole body. And if by chance you should become a mother, father, or a grandparent, then you must provide a pound of chocolate for every pound they weigh. Just so you understand and get the record straight on that part of it. I'm not going to talk about issues. In fact, the Speaker took a lot of my comments, and so I don't want to repeat myself. But I do want to let you know that as your Speaker pro tempore I'm assuming that I will be presiding occasionally. And while I am presiding I want you to know that I will continue the policy that I've had the last four years in trying to be as fair and as honest as I can with procedures, motions, amendments, etc. I hope to do that as I've done in the past regardless of party affiliation. I have a keen respect for the philosophical differences that we have in this body. That's why we are a diverse body. That's what makes the Iowa legislature so great. But by the same token, I kind of frown on debate that is strictly for political gain for one party or the other. So I just want to say that I would like to extend the olive leaf this morning, but I've been around here long enough to know that after the olive leaf is extended, before the week is over it's pretty well withered. Nevertheless, I do want to extend to the members of the minority party that we welcome their input and that we all need to work together for the good of the state of Iowa and the great people who live here. So with that, I look forward to this session. It is a privilege and an honor to be elected as your Speaker pro tempore, and I just want to say God bless each and every one of you and your families while you're here this session. Thank you so much.

During the opening ceremony of a new session I always find myself thinking of the great privilege that our constituents have given us by allowing us to serve them here in this place. Ten years ago Speaker Corbett and I spent much of opening day, like most new members, trying to figure out which desk to choose. Incredibly, only eleven of the veterans who saw us sworn in then are serving here today. The ceremony and this place stay the same while the people and the ideas constantly change. Good luck to each of the twenty-one new members and thank you in advance for the new ideas you have brought with you. This session holds great promise for all the people of Iowa. Cutting taxes, balancing the budget and funding our priorities are all possible and likely thanks to good decisions made by previous legislatures and thanks to a solid and growing Iowa economy. Democrats are ready to build on and add to Iowa's great success story. Tax cuts will continue to be a top priority for Democrats, as they were in 1995 and 1996 when we fought for and won property tax cuts for Iowans. Today middle income Iowans earn 50 percent of the income and pay 62 percent of the income taxes. That's not fair. Democratic tax cuts will give every taxpayer their fair share. We believe that a well-educated workforce will be our greatest asset as we enter a new century. To succeed in the next century, every child must have some education beyond high school, whether in a vocational trade school, at a community college or at one of our public or private colleges or universities. To prepare for the next century Democrats propose the \"Iowa Wins Scholarship\" program. \"Iowa Wins\" would offer every recent high school graduate a one-year, $1,000 scholarship for tuition at an accredited post-secondary school in Iowa. Students placing in the top 25 percent of their class would be eligible for a $2,000 scholarship. A better-educated workforce, fewer dropouts, better test scores and a future of good-paying jobs, all result when \"Iowa Wins.\" Democrats will continue our fight to put health care decisions back where they belong _ with families and their physicians. We pay insurance companies to help us limit financial risk but we trust our doctors for our health care advice. Insurance companies must not be allowed to make decisions, such as gag rules for providers and drive-by mastectomies that are not in the best interest of our families. We have built prisons to take violent criminals off the streets. This year we need to focus on juvenile crime and treatment for troubled youth. Democrats will work to provide appropriate punishment and treatment for youthful offenders. Today's system of waiting lists and delayed punishment isn't working _ we can do better. Our Democratic agenda addresses the problems facing Iowa and looks ahead to build future successes. We are thankful for this time of prosperity in Iowa, but we believe things can be even better. Mr. Speaker, Democrats are ready to go to work. REMARKS BY MAJORITY LEADER Siegrist of Pottawattamie offered the following remarks: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and Gentlemen of the Iowa House. Good morning and welcome! It is always a pleasure to be in the Iowa House of Representatives on opening day. One reason is because it means I was re-elected. It also reminds me of the first day of school when we see old friends and meet new ones. It is always rewarding to look around this chamber and see 100 members who recently stood for election. I know that each and every one of us comes into this session wanting to do what is best for the citizens of Iowa. We will have many differences of opinion over the next several months as to what is best for our state, but I believe we are all united in our efforts to move Iowa forward. To the twenty-one new members _ a very special welcome. You are embarking upon a job that will most likely be one of the most rewarding, exciting and at times frustrating experiences of your life. The new members, combined with the rest of us, make up a very diverse group of people which truly makes this a citizens' legislature. As we begin our work here today, I stand before you with a request and a challenge. I offer this not just to the Republican members of my caucus, but to all 100 members of this body. I further extend this challenge to the Senate and the Governor. The request is very simple _ we must remain committed to our respective goals and principles, but in the truest sense of legitimate legislative debate, we must seek to work together and create a new spirit of bipartisanship throughout Iowa. Let us have our honest differences, but let us also put the interests of Iowa above all else. The challenge is somewhat more complex. Simply put, the challenge is that as we address the current problems and concerns of Iowans, that we also offer and advocate solutions that take into account the future generations of Iowans. During the past four years, the Legislature, with the House of Representatives clearly leading the way, has turned Iowa around. Our great state is now on a course of unprecedented growth, opportunity and prosperity. We are here at a time when Iowa sits on the brink of many possibilities, especially in the areas of the quality of life, education and technology. We must be bold in advancing those possibilities for current and future generations of Iowans. The singer, Mary Chapin Carpenter, has a line in one of her songs that describes where we are on a legislative timeline. She sings, \"Every story's got a chapter/That chapter will be defined/By what's before and what comes after.\" This body over the past four years has defined the before chapter. Today, we begin work on the chapter about what comes after. The agenda that will be pursued by the majority party is basic and focused. 1. We will maintain our commitment to what we do best in this state _ education. This legislature will fund the allowable growth and school technology commitments. The allowable growth funding for our K-12 school system will be a funding increase of over 6 percent. We will also provide an additional $30 million for technology to help prepare our students for the future. 2. As this house did last year, with bipartisan support we will pass Learnfare this session. Our Learnfare proposal will apply to children between the ages of 6 through 11. Now some people will spew the rhetoric that this plan is unfair to poor people or mean to children. What is mean to children is not making sure that they get an education. An education is a requirement to escape poverty. Learnfare can be one more way to help break the cycle of welfare dependency. 3. We will pass the Restore the Outdoors plan. This plan over the next couple of years will provide $12 million to our park system to repair and improve our parks all across the state. 4. We will pass a resolution, this week, urging Congress to adopt the Balanced Budget Amendment and send it to the 50 states for ratification. Fiscal irresponsibility at the federal level by both the legislative and executive branches has resulted in a lower standard of living for all Americans. The massive federal debt is endangering opportunities for my son and for all your children and grandchildren. 5. Part of our agenda will be to take a closer look at the juvenile justice system. It is imperative that we look at not only punitive measures to combat youth violence, but that we find additional funding for proven preventative measures. And finally, last night as I was sitting in my apartment, I was listening to the Beatles and a song came on that has a great deal of significance for this legislative session. It was a song called \"Taxman,\" and one of the lyrics really hit home. \"Let me tell you how it will be. There's one for you, nineteen for me, cause I'm the taxman.\" Well, all Iowans should know that after this legislative session, the taxman is getting less. Considerable time will be consumed this session as we work to reduce the tax burden on all Iowans. Let me repeat, all Iowans! Our taxes are too high and in order to compete regionally and globally, to maintain and create new jobs, we must reduce the tax burden on all of our citizens. To those amongst us who want to preach the politics of division and class warfare _ this is not what the citizens of Iowa want from you. If it were, there would be a new majority in the U.S. Congress today. The first tax issue before us this year is one that passed last year in the House in a bipartisan manner. We will eliminate the inheritance tax for children, grandchildren and stepchildren. A tax on a person's legacy, be it a family farm or small business, is contrary to the American dream. We will eliminate that tax. When we have accomplished that early in the session, then we will begin the debate on significantly reducing the rest of our tax burden. This session of the Iowa Legislature promises to be busy and productive. We have spent much time this past year looking back and celebrating 150 years of our history. Now, we look to our future. Our challenge and our goal must be to serve not only those who live in Iowa now, but to set a course of prosperity with stability for those who will live and grow up in Iowa in the 21st century. So let us join together today with a commitment to work in a bipartisan spirit and to make a positive difference for Iowans, well into the next century. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
