        "text": "Do Endorsements Matter?\n\nWhether or not endorsements make any difference on Caucus Night is debatable, but they are important in the pre-primary period when developing campaigns strive to build credibility. Campaigns go to considerable effort to round up endorsements. The first targets are prominent party leaders including elected officials, former officials, erstwhile candidates, and party activists. In addition, campaigns seek support of community activists and business and civic leaders; Democratic candidates also woo labor support.\n\nThe timing and format of endorsement announcements can be significant. A mass endorsement, with elected officials lined up behind the candidate, can draw significant attention. Alternatively, rolling out a steady stream of endorsements over a period of time can bolster the impression of a growing campaign. Picking up a prominent supporter who had formerly been with another campaign is regarded as a coup, worthy of a press release or press conference.\n\nThose that have endorsements trumpet them; those that don't argue that endorsements really don't matter and that anyhow they are pursuing a grassroots strategy. Texas Gov. George W. Bush, receiving the endorsements of a majority of Iowa's Republican state legislators on September 1, 1999, stated, \"These legislators bring credibility, on-the-ground leadership and support to my campaign...\" Almost by definition \"establishment candidates\" are able to rack up endorsements from large numbers of elected officials. For others in the field, even a few elected official endorsements can help with credibility.\n\nAn endorser may play an active role in the campaign, serving as a surrogate, appearing with the candidate, making calls and rallying up support, or he or she may do nothing more than allow his or her name to be listed on the campaign's leadership team or steering committee.\n\nThe process of building support and endorsements among specific groups, such as farmers or educators, is known as coalitions, and is an area of the campaign unto itself."
