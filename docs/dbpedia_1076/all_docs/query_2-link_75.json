Tally is also based on a narrow definition of Iowa visits and does not include events just across the state border, for example visits east of the Mississippi River in the Quad Cities area (i.e. in Illinois). (1) Sen. Dodd took up a rental in Des Moines starting around Oct. 19. (2) Does not include activity by former Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack. + (3) Does not include former Sen. Mike Gravel. (4) The National Governors Association meeting in July 2005 is a bit difficult to score in terms of days; a lot of it was \"official\" business and meetings and governors were in state for varying lengths of time. Some did more politicking than others. In the table above participation in the NGA meeting is tallied as one visit, one day for each of those frequently mentioned as prospects. (5) Gov. Mark Warner announced that he would not run for president in 2008 on Oct. 12, 2006 but visited the state later in the day; that visit is included above. Comments?
