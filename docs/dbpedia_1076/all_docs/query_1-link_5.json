While traditional click reactions can be employed to create uniform functional materials about living cells, their spontaneity prohibits spatiotemporal control of material properties, limiting their utility in recapitulating the dynamic heterogeneity characteristic of the in vivo microenvironment. Photopolymerization-based techniques gain this desired level of 4D programmability, but often at the expense of introducing propagating free radicals that are prone to non-specific reactions with biological systems. Here we present a strategy for bioorthogonal hydrogel formation and modification that does not rely on propagating free radicals, proceeding through oxime ligation moderated by a photocaged alkoxyamine. Upon mild near UV light exposure, the photocage is cleaved, liberating the alkoxyamine and permitting localized condensation with an aldehyde. Multi-arm crosslinkers formed oxime-based hydrogels within minutes of light exposure in the presence of live cells. Polymerization rates and final mechanical properties of these gels could be systematically tuned by varying crosslinker concentrations, light intensity, aniline catalyst equivalents, and pH. Moreover, hydrogel geometry and final mechanical properties were controlled by the location and extent of UV exposure, respectively. Photomediated oxime ligation was then translated to the biochemical modification of hydrogels, where full-length proteins containing photocaged alkoxyamines were immobilized in user-defined regions exposed to UV light. The programmability afforded by photomediated oxime ligation can recapitulate dynamically anisotropic mechanical and biochemical aspects of the native extracellular matrix. Consequently, photopolymerized oxime-based hydrogels are expected to enable an enhanced understanding of cell-matrix interactions by serving as improved cell culture platforms.\n\nOther authors\n\nSee publication\n\nI endorse every sentence of this excellent editorial on advice for early-career polymer scientists. As someone who now officially counts as (gulp) \"mid-career\", I would like to add one consideration to the comparison of working at larger vs smaller companies: intellectual approach. Larger companies tend to focus on quantitative data gathering using purpose-built equipment. This is necessary because of the typical audience for that information: upper management who may not be intuitively familiar with the area of research and corporate customers with exact specifications that must be met. Quantitative analysis is effective for mature programs, but new technologies often won't have well-established testing methods and metrics. Even if there are turnkey systems for quantitative measurement, early efforts have not yet justified the tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars of investment that would be required for them. Work at smaller companies leans to more qualitative experimentation. One frequent test at a previous job involved measuring cure of a resin and powder mixture with my thumb, and recording the time where it \"felt stiff\". This kind of measurement has the advantage of being fast and cheap to establish, and allows for rapid screening of materials to achieve an early demonstration. Both skill sets are extremely valuable, and young scientists would benefit from learning both approaches and knowing how to transfer a project from one to the other when appropriate.\n\n20\n\nI earned my doctorate under Professor Yoshio. He is famous for his spinel-manganese cathode materials, electrolyte additives, and graphite anode surface modification. He has retired now, but his lab in its heyday was tremendous, and although it would be a problem now, the statute of limitations has probably expired, so I will tell you a little about it. His, or rather our, lab operated 24 hours a day. We would start our research in the morning, and in the evening, Professor Yoshio would come in with beer. He is the type of person who gets ideas when he drinks. Everyone would drink beer and work until morning. Then the next day would begin. It was an endless routine. He accepted foreign students from all over the world. Thinking about it now, it was against all sorts of rules, it was dangerous to conduct experiments while drunk, and the success rate of even the most precise cell assembly work was considerably reduced. We slept in our sleeping bags when we got sleepy, and only returned to our apartment on weekends. His laboratory was known as the \"Nightless Castle. Even so, his laboratory produced a number of groundbreaking inventions related to lithium-ion batteries. The results of those inventions are still in common use today. His disciples at that time are now university professors, senior executives of car manufacturers, and presidents and CTOs of major material manufacturers. I was the only one who did not rise to the top. I miss those days. My private lab might be similar. If I get an idea, I can experiment immediately, even in the middle of the night. ðŸ˜‰\n\n470\n\n18 Comments\n\nHi everyone. I mentioned in video 3 about Algumer as a binder and videos 2 and 5 about it's ability as a thickener or rheology modifier. Video number 6 demonstrates Algumer as an emulsifier. It is shown at 2% wt, making a stable emulsion of wax in water. Emulsifiers are commonly used at 3-10%, some as high as 15-25%. So hopefully the picture is becoming clear. There are many products, in many industries, where binding, thickening and emulsifying are required. Why would you use 3 different microplastics within an individual product when you could eliminate all 3 and use a green alternative? If you are willing to use 10% synthetic emulsifier + a synthetic carbomer + a synthetic binder, why not use 10% Algumer, get the binding and thickening for free, and help save the planet in the process! #greenchemistry #seaweed #cellulose #nanocellulose #emulsifiers #circularity #circulareconomy #zerowaste #futureproof #microplastics Contact: dominic.orourke@mercel.co.uk Mark Dorris Alastair Kennedy - MIEx\n\n25\n\nOur paper titled \"Introducing Redox-Active Species for Enhanced Energy Storage in Flexible Supercapacitors\" has just been published in the Chemical Engineering Journal! ðŸ”¬ In this study, we focused on enhancing the redox-activity at electrodeâ€“electrolyte interfaces to boost energy and power density in supercapacitors. Our key strategy? Designing a novel ionic liquid-based polymer electrolyte (IL/PE) with dual redox-additives, potassium iodide (KI) and diphenylamine (DPA). ðŸŒŸ What makes our IL/PE stand out? It exhibits: Spectacular flexibility High ionic conductivity (âˆ¼23.8 Ã— 10âˆ’4 S cmâˆ’1) Stability in a wide potential window (âˆ¼5.9 V) ðŸ’¡ We fabricated a symmetrical interdigitated planner device using our dual redox-active IL/PE and flower-like WS2 electrode material. The results were remarkable: Highest energy density of 47.86 ÂµWh cmâˆ’2 at a power density of 3509 ÂµW cmâˆ’2 High working potential (3 V) Excellent cycling stability up to 20,000 cycles ðŸ”— Interested in learning more?

Hamed Yazdani Nezhad https://lnkd.in/g86mWFgM Two-dimensional (2D) materials have attracted considerable research interest due to their precisely defined properties and versatile applications. In this realm, borophene - a single atomic sheet of boron atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice - has emerged as a promising candidate. While borophenes were theoretically predicted to have unique structural, optical, and electronic properties, the experimental synthesis of crystalline borophene sheets was first demonstrated on metal substrates in 2015, marking a crucial milestone. Since then, research efforts have focused on controlling the synthesis of semiconducting borophene polymorphs and exploring their novel physical characteristics. This review aims to explore the potential of 2D materials, specifically borophene, in various technological fields such as batteries, supercapacitors, fuel cells, and more. The analysis emphasises meticulous scrutiny of synthesis techniques due to their fundamental importance in realising borophene's properties. Specifically, the high carrier mobilities, tuneable bandgaps, and exceptional thermal conductivity of borophene are highlighted. By providing a comprehensive outlook on the significance of borophene in advancing materials science and technologies, this review contributes to shaping the landscape of 2D material research. #Research #polymers #nanocomposites #Chemistry #Physics #Nanomaterials #GreenTechnology #Nanotechnology #Composites #Phosphorene #Graphene #carbon #phosphorus #Graphene #borophene #DST #STEM\n\n33\n\n2 Comments\n\nTuesday publication update! ðŸ“– With this newest published research atomic-scale mechanisms were observed on 2D materials using our #FusionAX system! The authors imaged, atom-by-atom, the thermally induced structural evolution of twisted bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides using in situ transmission electron microscopy. ðŸ”¥ The authors used short 0.5-s heat pulses from 100Â° to 1000Â°C and took STEM images in between to reduce thermal drift. It was observed at low temperatures that the moirÃ© superlattices morphed into nanoscale aligned domains. It was observed that this process started by nucleating a new grain within one monolayer, its crystal orientation intricately templated by the other. ðŸ”¬Unexpectedly, the aligned domains grow through a mesmerizing dance of collective rotation of moirÃ© supercells and the graceful hopping of 5|7 defect pairs at moirÃ© boundaries. These observations offer unprecedented mechanistic insight into the atomic-scale interactions that govern moirÃ© structures, illuminating the potential to pattern interfacial structure and properties of two-dimensional materials at the nanoscale. ðŸ“ˆThese research results can be correlated to inconsistent and heterogeneous properties measured in moirÃ© based devices. This can then lead to new synthesis, bottom-up routes, designing structures to control and pattern the twist angle on the nanoscale. Want to read the entire research paper?
