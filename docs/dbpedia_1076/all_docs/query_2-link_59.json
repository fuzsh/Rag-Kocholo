Iowa voters elected state senators in 35 of the state senate's 50 districts—all 25 of the odd-numbered seats were up for regularly-scheduled elections and, due to the oddities of redistricting following the 2000 Census, 10 of the even-numbered sears were up as well. State senators serve four-year terms in the Iowa State Senate, with half of the seats traditionally up for election each cycle.\n\nThe primary election on June 4, 2002, determined which candidates appeared on the November 5, 2002 general election ballot. Primary election results can be obtained here.[2] General election results can be obtained here.[3]\n\nFollowing the previous 2000 Iowa Senate election, Republicans had control of the Iowa state Senate with 30 seats to Democrats' 20 seats. On March 12, 2002, a special election in district 10 resulted in Amanda Ragan flipping a seat in favor of the Democrats. Therefore, on election day in November 2002, Republicans controlled 29 seats and Democrats had 21.\n\nTo reclaim control of the chamber from Republicans, the Democrats needed to net 5 Senate seats.\n\nRepublicans maintained control of the Iowa State Senate following the 2002 general election with the balance of power remaining unchanged with Republicans holding 29 seats and Democrats having 21 seats.\n\nSummary of Results\n\n[edit]\n\nNOTE: 15 of the even-numbered districts did not have elections in 2002 so they are not listed here.\n\nAlso note, an asterisk (*) after a Senator's name indicates they were an incumbent re-elected, but to a new district number due to redistricting.\n\nState Senate District Incumbent Party Elected Senator Party 1st Steven D.

as 10 of the even-numbered seats due to redistricting following the 2000 Census. 15 of the even-numbered seats are not included here because they did not have elections in 2002.\n\nDistrict 1 •
