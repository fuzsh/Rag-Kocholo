Among these many species is the tree swallow, an aerial insectivore that has experienced declining populations in recent decades. We analyzed over 1,800 nests from 18 years’ of tree swallow nesting data to further understand how climate change is affecting tree swallow life history. Our results agree with previous studies that increased air temperatures have been advancing the average egg laying date of tree swallows and that the change in average nest laying date is negatively correlated with nest occupancy rates. We also found that fledgling rates have been increasing with rising January air temperatures in the non-breeding regions of tree swallows and female body conditions are positively correlated with March air temperatures, but negatively correlated with the standard deviation in March air temperatures. Our analysis suggests that the mechanism causing a decline in tree swallow populations may be occurring after the chicks have fledged. We express concern that decreasing populations will constrain the tree swallow’s ability to adjust its laying date in accordance with climate change and that future studies should investigate this constraint.\n\nEmma Bock – Biology (AGLS)\n\nThe Effectiveness of Plant Compounds in Inhibiting Bacterial Growth in Chicken Fecal Samples\n\nView poster\n\nProject Advisor(s): Qijing Zhang | Advisor(s): Em Kapler\n\nAbstract (Click to view) Campylobacter jejuni is a foodborne bacterial pathogen that causes gastrointestinal illness in humans and abortion in ruminants. Due to its clinical significance and rising resistance to antibiotics, Campylobacter is a major public health concern. Hence, alternatives to antibiotics are needed for effective control of Campylobacter. Cryptolepine is derived from a West African plant and has antimicrobial properties, while carnosic acid is derived from common rosemary and Salvia plant extracts and has been shown to have antibacterial activity. However, it is unclear if cryptolepine and carnosic acid are effective against Campylobacter. The purpose of this study was to determine whether cryptolepine and carnosic acid inhibited Campylobacter under conditions simulating in vivo infection. When added into fecal samples collected from chickens experimentally colonized with Campylobacter, both cryptolepine or carnosic acid produced significant reduction in viable cell counts in a dose-dependent manner. We also measured the killing curve of carnosic acid over a 24-hour period. At twice the MIC concentration and treated for 8 hours, carnosic acid completely killed Campylobacter, while the non-treated control had an increase in viable cell counts, indicating carnosic acid is bactericidal. These results demonstrate the anti-Campylobacter activity of cryptolepine and carnosic acid and their potential as antimicrobial alternatives.\n\nHaley Curtis – Biology (AGLS)\n\nSpontaneous Haploid Genome Doubling in Arabidopsis thaliana as a model organism for maize.\n\nView poster\n\nProject Advisor(s): Thomas Lubberstedt | Advisor(s): Sarah Wehner\n\nAbstract (Click to view) In maize breeding, inbred parents are needed to create hybrids. Doubled haploid (DH) technology develops homozygous inbred plants in as little as two generations. This is much quicker than traditional breeding methods, which take six or more generations. There are two steps involved in DH technology: a haploid induction step followed by a genome doubling step. The haploid induction step uses an inducer genotype to pollinate a donor plant, resulting in haploid plants with a single copy of the genome. Then, the artificial genome doubling step is used to overcome sterility in the haploid plants. Current methods are undesirable due to the labor and costs involved. Spontaneous haploid genome doubling (SHGD) is a possible solution to this problem. Genotypes with SHGD are haploid fertile. The goal of the project is to discover genes involved in SHGD using an Arabidopsis thaliana screening pipeline. This poster presentation will outline the steps involved in the screening pipeline to identify candidate genes in haploid fertility. The candidate genes showing promising results in the pipeline will be re-analyzed for validation. If results are confirmed, the candidate genes will be studied in maize.\n\nKaija Dahlberg – Genetics (AGLS), Nutritional Science (AGLS)\n\nRisks of Antimicrobial Resistance in Swine Manure Treated Environments\n\nView poster\n\nProject Advisor(s): Adina Howe | Advisor(s): Alison Esser, Auriel Willette\n\nAbstract (Click to view) Antimicrobial resistance is one of the largest growing problems in public health today due to the overtreatment of humans and animals. I explored the possibility of antimicrobial resistance in root endophytes secondary to swine manure treatment. This project aimed to evaluate the possibility of swine manure fertilization introducing tetracycline resistance into plants. Plants were treated with mineral, manure, or digestate manure treatments, and the bacteria inside their roots, the endophytes, were tested for tetracycline resistance and compared. The mineral treatment acted as the control. If resistance was increased with manure treatment, this could be a concern, especially in crops serving as food sources, such as lettuce. I took nine previously sampled and cultured root endophytes, three from each treatment, and used two isolates from each sample to conduct a Kirby-Bauer test. Each isolate was tested in duplicate with two tetracycline discs at the clinical concentration on each plate. The results showed no significant differences between the treatments, indicating that the root endophytes were likely not affected by resistance genes that may have been in the manure treatment, which is reassuring to the public health crisis.\n\nPhoebe Ditrinco – Animal Science\n\nDevelopment of Real Time PCR for Nine Clostridium perfringens Toxins\n\nView poster\n\nProject Advisor(s): Phillip Gauger | Advisor(s): Rodrigo Tarte\n\nAbstract (Click to view) Clostridium perfringens (C. perf) is a commensal intestinal bacterium of many species including humans, swine, beef, and poultry. Symptoms from infection can range from mild diarrhea to hemorrhaging of intestinal walls leading to mortality. C. perf is divided into seven types (A through G) based on presence and/or absence of specific toxin genes which affect rates of morbidity and mortality. The Iowa State Veterinary Diagnostics Laboratory (ISU VDL) frequently tests for C. perfringens. However, the current conventional PCR test offered by the ISU VDL requires pure C. perf isolates via culture methods. This creates a challenge as not all types of C. perfringens present in the sample are successfully isolated. This may lead to the incorrect typing of the C. perf infection. Additionally, the assay is cumbersome, time consuming, and has poor sensitivity.Current research successfully created real-time PCR tests which can be utilized on isolates to combat the listed limitations and add additional toxin genes to the testing panel. This assay will soon be offered at the ISU VDL. Future studies are planned to compare toxin typing from isolates and direct enteric samples.\n\nAbby Fowler – Microbiology\n\nCharacterizing the Growth and Differentiation of Adult Hippocampal Progenitor Cells on Gelatin Scaffold\n\nPoster not available online.\n\nProject Advisor(s): Donald Sakaguchi | Advisor(s): Joan Cunnick\n\nAbstract (Click to view) Three-dimensional (3D) biopolymer scaffolds, such as those made of gelatin, offer a culture system that could create a better environment for stem cell proliferation and growth by providing a more physiologically relevant microenvironment. 3D biopolymer scaffolds also offer the potential for cells to be initially cultured in vitro and then placed within the human body, creating a platform for new tissue to grow. Adult rat hippocampal progenitor cells (AHPCs) can differentiate into neurons, glial cells, and astrocytes in vitro. When paired, AHPCs and 3D gelatin scaffolds could offer a potential therapy to replace lost nerve tissue by creating a bridge between severed nerves. Initial experiments developed cell culture protocols for AHPCs within several different configurations of 3D porous gelatin scaffolds. We demonstrated the growth and viability of AHPCs utilizing fluorescent microscopy and propidium iodide assays. We have also demonstrated that these scaffolds support cell proliferation and differentiation through immunocytochemistry. We have also identified occurrences of colocalized staining of RIP (oligodendrocyte marker) and Ki67 (proliferation marker) which implies the presence of oligodendrocyte precursor cells. Further characterization of AHPCs into neurons, glial cells, and oligodendrocytes is currently being conducted to understand differentiation. This work has the potential to advance peripheral nerve tissue engineering.\n\nKaitlyn Goldsberry – Animal Science\n\nEquine Herpesvirus Vaccine Development\n\nView poster\n\nProject Advisor(s): David Verhoeven | Advisor(s): James Koltes\n\nAbstract (Click to view) Equine Herpesvirus (EHV) is a highly contagious airborne equine DNA virus that is transmitted through nasopharyngeal shedding. EHV is virtually found worldwide. (USDA et al. June 2020) has found there are nine known strains of EHV, but EHV-1, EHV-3, and EHV-4 are of the highest concern. EHV-1 is of greatest concern because it is known to cause respiratory disease, late gestation abortion, and Equine Herpesvirus Myeloencephalopathy (EHM). In this experiment expression cassettes were used. Expression cassettes are a distinct component of vector DNA consisting of a gene and regulatory sequence to be expressed by a transfected cell. In a successful transformation, the expression cassette directs the cells machinery to make RNA and proteins. Each expression cassette will contain a gene and the sequences controlling their expression. In each expression cassette there is a glycoprotein of interest inserted. The glycoproteins used in this experiment were glycoprotein B, C, D, G, Cap, GlycoB, and GlycoC. Each glycoprotein contains a gene sequence that is essential to Equine Herpesvirus. To check if the expression cassettes were successful, a gel electrophoresis was run.\n\nJonah Gray – Environmental Science (AGLS), Agronomy\n\nTemperature Sensitivity of N2O Production in Response to a Changing Climate and Agricultural Drainage\n\nView poster\n\nProject Advisor(s): Mike Castellano, Bryan Emmett | Advisor(s): Richard Williams, Heidi Ackerman\n\nAbstract (Click to view) In the Corn Belt there is widespread use of N-fertilizers on poorly drained soils already rich in carbon and nitrogen creating ideal conditions for denitrification and N2O emissions, a potent greenhouse gas with ~300 times the warming potential of CO2. Considering rising temperatures due to climate change, understanding the temperature sensitivity of denitrification in systems already controlled for moisture will be imperative as we strive to reduce environmental N losses while still increasing yields. The objective of this research was to test the temperature sensitivity of denitrification in soils collected from conventionally drained and non-drained sites. I hypothesized that since conventionally drained soils have less water in the topsoil they would undergo the greatest range in temperatures. This would result in the microbial community being better adapted to variable conditions and having a lower temperature sensitivity than the undrained system. Using a denitrification enzyme activity assay, I collected the rates of denitrification and then used the rates to calculate Q10s for denitrification. Between drained and non-drained sites, I found no significant differences in temperature sensitivity.\n\nSeth Harbecke – Biochemistry (AGLS)\n\nUHP Grant Recipient - Research funded in part by the Iowa State University Foundation\n\nSimple Sugar-Based Fertilizer Impacts on Corn Growth and Nutrient Content\n\nView poster\n\nProject Advisor(s): Kathleen Delate | Advisor(s): Elizabeth Zimmerman\n\nAbstract (Click to view) Among the many amendments organic farmers can apply, a product called TerraFed™ has been attributed to assisting with plant growth. In this experiment, it was found that TerraFed™ did not cause an increase in corn growth upon application during the V2 growth stage. The fertilizer did not show any increase in leaf greenness, plant height, plant development, or any kind of observable plant health. The application of the fertilizer did however cause an increase in microbial growth in the soil compared to treatments without the fertilizer. Additionally, the application of TerraFed™ did cause an increase in certain metabolites in corn shown through metabolomic analysis of the plant tissue. It is important to note that the autoclaving of the soil caused differences in corn growth, including plant height, plant leaf greenness, and certain tissue metabolites.\n\nHannah Kramer – Horticulture\n\nDetermining the Effectiveness of an Isotridecanol Additive on Reducing Fertilizer Concentrations for Greenhouse Crop Production\n\nView poster\n\nProject Advisor(s): Chris Currey | Advisor(s): Barbara Clawson\n\nAbstract (Click to view) Commercial greenhouse producers are often interested in minimizing the cost of fertilizer applications while maintaining plant quality. Evofactor (with active ingredient ethoxylated isotridecanol) is a new additive designed to improve fertilizer use efficiency in the commercial greenhouse industry by reducing the amount of fertilizer needed to maintain or improve plant quality. Zonal geranium and petunia cuttings were transplanted into 11.4-cm containers and grown in a greenhouse. One of four treatments began at the first irrigation event after transplanting: 50 ppm N, 50 ppm N + ethoxylated isotridecanol, 150 ppm N, or 150 ppm N + ethoxylated isotridecanol. Plants were grown for five weeks, until they were considered “finished” and in flower. Final height, width, and dry shoot mass were collected. There was no apparent effect of fertilizer concentration (50 vs. 150 ppm N) on plant growth and development. However, both size and shoot dry mass increased for the plants provided with ethoxylated isotridecanol-amended fertilizer solutions. While we did not see a synergistic effect from ethoxylated isotridecanol in fertilizer solutions, the promotive effect on growth and development for plants provided with ethoxylated isotridecanol demonstrates potential for improving containerized greenhouse crop growth.\n\nKamryn Lesle – Animal Science\n\nEffect of Fecal Microbiota Transplant on Sow and Piglet Microbiome\n\nView poster\n\nProject Advisor(s): Laura Greiner | Advisor(s): Daniel Thomson\n\nAbstract (Click to view) Fifty gilts and twenty-five sows were used to evaluate the effect of fecal microbiota transfer on piglet scours prevalence and mortality through the nursery. Gilts were randomly assigned to either fecal microbiota transfer (FMT) or placebo (PLAC) groups. Sow fecal samples were collected on approximately days 69 and 89 of gestation and processed for FMT solution. Once daily, from approximately 70-76 and 90-96 days of gestation, FMT gilts were orally administered the FMT solution and PLAC gilts were administered saline. Piglets were weighed at birth and five weeks post-weaning to calculate average daily gain (ADG). Data were analyzed in R 4.2.3. The experimental unit was the sow or litter, and results were considered significant at P ≤ 0.05. The number of piglets started and weaned were similar across treatments (P ≥ 0.721). Birth weight and ADG were similar across treatments (P ≥ 0.198). Scours prevalence was lower in sow litters compared to placebo litters (52.0 vs. 16.7%; P = 0.039), while FMT scours prevalence was intermediate. There was no effect of FMT on pre-wean or nursery mortality (P ≥ 0.89). In conclusion, FMT did not impact gilt litter scours prevalence, growth rate, or mortality through the nursery.\n\nOlivia Liebing – Horticulture, Agronomy\n\nQuantifying the Effects of Ethoxylated Isotridecanol as an Additive to Plant Growth Regulators\n\nPoster not available online\n\nProject Advisor(s): Chris Currey | Advisor(s): Cynthia Haynes, Heidi Ackerman\n\nAbstract (Click to view) Ethoxylated isotridecanol is a surfactant introduced to the greenhouse market claiming to increase the efficacy of chemical applications. This implies that chemical rates could be lowered without sacrificing crop quality, helping to increase the sustainability of production and decrease chemical costs. This study quantified the impact of five soil drench treatments in a calibrachoa crop: 1 ppm paclobutrazol, 1 ppm paclobutrazol with ethoxylated isotridecanol, 3 ppm paclobutrazol, 3 ppm paclobutrazol with ethoxylated isotridecanol, and untreated. Plants in high-dose treatments had greater growth control than those not treated. Plants in low-dose treatments had growth regulation between untreated and high-dose treatments. In this study, Ethoxylated isotridecanol did not have an impact on the efficacy of plant growth regulation.\n\nJaime Lyke – Animal Science\n\nThe Evolution of Veterinary School Hopefuls\n\nView poster\n\nProject Advisor(s): Jennifer Bundy | Advisor(s): Jennifer Bundy\n\nAbstract (Click to view) This research was conducted to analyze how the application pool of veterinary school students has changed over time. By understanding these trends, the hope is to aide veterinary school applicants in the future by providing resources that others do not have. A Qualtrics survey was used to collect data on how many people applied to veterinary medical school and what obstacles they faced (IRB 23-061). The survey had 213 respondents, the majority of which being students majoring in animal science at Iowa State university. Respondents pursuing the veterinary medical field reported that the hardest part of being pre-vet was stress related to being qualified or accepted. These respondents reported they could use the most support in obtaining experience with a veterinarian. 88.3% of the respondents reported having an ethnicity of white and 86.6% of people still pursuing veterinary medicine are white. Of those pursuing veterinary medicine, 51.8% are small/companion animal interest compared to the 28.6% being production animal interest (beef cattle, dairy cattle, poultry, sheep/goats, and swine). Outside of finding other interests, the number one reason why pre-vet students changed their career path was due to the financial expense related to attending veterinary medical school.\n\nMegan Marchese – Animal Science\n\nEffects of Transportation Stress on the Development of Leaky Gut Syndrome in Cattle\n\nView poster\n\nProject Advisor(s): Stephanie Hansen | Advisor(s): Elisabeth Lonergan\n\nAbstract (Click to view) The intestinal barrier plays a vital role in the health of animals by protecting them from many microorganisms, toxins, and chemicals that can be found in the lumen. Leaky gut syndrome (intestinal barrier dysfunction) is a common health issue in many animals, including cattle, that causes alterations in the intestinal barrier. This compromises the barrier, allowing harmful luminal contents like microbial pathogens and toxins to get through. CrEDTA, an indigestible marker, can be used to help identify when a leaky gut is present in an individual. Twelve dairy-beef calves were orally dosed with 500 mL of 180 nM CrEDTA solution 36 hours after trucking. Jugular blood samples were collected every 2 hours in a 10-hour period, as well as 24 hours post-CrEDTA dosing. These blood samples were analyzed for Cr using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy. The mixed procedure in SAS 9.4 was used to analyze the plasma Cr concentrations across time points. Our data indicate that at timepoint 2, the highest concentration of CrEDTA was found in the samples across all of the calves. As Cr concentration decreases, there is no difference between 6 to 10 hours post-CrEDTA dosing.\n\nJoan Meis – Microbiology\n\nInfluence of the microbiota on Drosophila immune system development\n\nView poster\n\nProject Advisor(s): Ryan Smith | Advisor(s): Joan Cunnick\n\nAbstract (Click to view) The gut microbiome is a complex ecosystem of microorganisms that plays an essential role in the health of host organisms. Evidence suggests that many physiological processes, including immune function, are influenced by the presence or absence of different microbial species. As a result, there is great interest to better understand these host-microbe interactions in the context of health and disease across animal systems. Here, we use Drosophila melanogaster as a model to investigate the interactions between the microbiota and the fly immune system. By rearing flies under germ-free (axenic) conditions, we demonstrate defects in immune cell populations by measuring the expression of known crystal cell and plasmatocyte markers, supporting that the microbiota contribute to fly hematopoiesis. In addition, axenic flies display reduced antimicrobial peptide (AMP) expression and fared worse against bacterial infections, suggesting that humoral immunity is similarly compromised. These results strongly suggest that the absence of the microbiota has significant effects on fly immune function. With Drosophila serving as an important model system with relevance for other insect and mammalian systems, our findings will have broad utility to increase our collective understanding of the mechanisms by which the microbiota influence hematopoiesis and maturation of the innate immune system.\n\nAnnika Miller – Animal Science\n\nThe Use of Bacteriophage in the Fight Against Mastitis\n\nView poster\n\nProject Advisor(s): Nick Peters | Advisor(s): Jennifer Bundy\n\nAbstract (Click to view) Mastitis is a bacterial infection of the breast tissue, commonly caused by Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Antibiotics are typically used as a preventative measure and a treatment for this ailment but renders the milk unusable during the treatment period and can lead to antimicrobial resistance. Bacteriophage, also known as phage, are now being explored as an alternative approach to traditional antibiotic therapies. Phage are extremely strain specific and can be easily administered as a cocktail of several phage types. These qualities can reduce the disruption of normal microflora and diminish the chances for resistance development. We isolated phage that kill the aforementioned bacteria and tested their efficacy at various concentrations. In brief, we filtered soil samples from the Iowa State Soil Farm and cultured samples on agar plates with the target bacteria. When phage killed the bacteria, we isolated the plaques, measured their concentrations, and imaged them using electron microscopy. Subsequently, we ran various efficacy trials and determined the usefulness of each phage type. We also isolated bacteria with potential suppressor mutations against a single phage type and tested our panel of phage against these, the results of which require further investigation. Finally, we tested whether each phage could kill different bacterial species, thereby examining the specificity of host range. We found that the phage did not act like broad-spectrum antibiotics and did not kill any other bacterial species tested. Taken together, these results suggest potential efficiency for phage cocktail treatments of mastitis in a farm setting.\n\nBailee Morris – Animal Science\n\nAn Investigation Into Biofilms and Their Impact on Animal Reproduction\n\nView poster\n\nProject Advisor(s): Stephan Schmitz-Esser | Advisor(s): James Koltes\n\nAbstract (Click to view) Biofilms are a collective, mutualistic unit consisting of microorganisms capable of colonizing a multitude of surfaces while also being highly resistant to most treatments on the market. While naturally occurring and not always problematic in animal reproduction, biofilms can be detrimental, resulting in production and profit losses throughout the industry by negatively impacting fertility and reproductive success. Issues involving biofilms most knowingly arise within the dairy cattle and equine industries, which are the species of focus for this paper. The study of reproductive microflora and biofilms is a newly emerging field within animal agriculture, and currently, very little is truly known about it. Biofilms are present, not well understood, have impacts on production, and treatments are broad and often ineffective, requiring long and repeated treatment measures. Continued and further research is necessary to better understand reproductive microbial communities, imbalances and alterations to those communities leading to biofilms, and successful treatments for biofilms. The aims of this investigative review are to further understand biofilms and their impacts on animal reproduction while analyzing current treatments and research in order to identify areas needing more refined, new, or never-been-done research to continue making progress in understanding, managing, and treating biofilms.\n\nSydney Paris – Microbiology\n\nImproving Resources for Domestic Abuse Survivors within Iowa State University and in the Ames Community\n\nView poster\n\nProject Advisor(s): Howard Tyler | Advisor(s): Susan Cramer, Curtis Youngs\n\nAbstract (Click to view) This project aimed to increase awareness and resources for victims and survivors of domestic violence at Iowa State University through a multifaceted approach. Incident reports from 2019-2021 were collected from the Iowa State Police Department and other public institutions in Iowa to compare the frequency of domestic violence cases. A literature review was conducted to identify existing approaches to educating students, bystanders, and faculty members on identifying and supporting victims of domestic violence. Based on feedback from an ACCESS victim advocate, two flyers and a presentation were developed to educate and inform students and faculty. The project concluded with the distribution of flyers to local businesses and future plans to promote the project to campus officials and create QR code stickers for distribution. Key findings include a similar incidence of domestic violence on Iowa State campus as compared to other institutions. However, about 50% of domestic violence cases go unreported so the actual occurrences could be very different. The outcomes of this project include the development of effective educational materials and increased community awareness of the issue. This project highlights the importance of providing education, resources, and support for all students to ensure that everyone feels safe in their relationships.\n\nJenna Plotzke – Global Resource Systems, Environmental Science (AGLS)\n\nDrainage District Main Improvements in Iowa\n\nView poster\n\nProject Advisor(s): Matthew Helmers | Advisor(s): Amanda Chung, Richard Williams\n\nAbstract (Click to view) Iowa agriculture within the Des Moines Lobe (west/central Iowa) is dependent upon drainage systems to keep the corn and soybean fields producing year after year due to previous glaciation. In the early 1900s, drainage systems became a popular and feasible way for farmers to remove the excess water from these fields. There is a concern that there are drainage systems that are currently in place across the Des Moines Lobe that are under-capacity and the fields will not be drained properly to keep productivity up. This research examined recent drainage main improvement projects to evaluate the percent of projects that move forward, the cost of these projects, and the old and new drainage coefficient. The work found that most drainage main improvement projects have moved forward and the average cost per acre is $800.\n\nElizabeth Plunkett – Dairy Science\n\nProportion of Bovine Leukemia Virus Antibody Positive Dams Actively Shedding Virus in Colostrum in a Small Research Dairy\n\nView poster\n\nProject Advisor(s): James Koltes, Ellie Putz | Advisor(s): James Koltes\n\nAbstract (Click to view) Objective: Bovine Leukemia Virus (BLV) is an oncogenic retrovirus that affects 89% of dairy cattle in the United States. Most cattle live asymptomatically, but 5% of infected cattle will develop cancerous lymphosarcoma tumors. Although not necessarily cancerous, BLV positive animals are associated with reduced production and health in the dairy industry. To study the transfer of BLV, we investigated the percentage of BLV positive dams shedding virus in colostrum. Methods: Data was collected from the USDA National Animal Disease Center research dairy from fall 2017 to winter 2022. On day of calving, colostrum, CBC, and serum samples were collected from dams, and blood from calves before and after colostrum feeding was collected for CBC and serum. Results: BLV positive dams were associated with reduced refractive index scores and increased lymphocyte counts post parturition. As expected, calves that consumed colostrum from BLV positive dams tested positive for BLV antibody post-consumption. Virus was detected in 18% of colostrum from BLV antibody positive dams. Conclusions: Our work emphasizes the importance of monitoring BLV status in dams and suggests feeding colostrum from BLV negative animals could limit calf exposure to virus. Further work should investigate whether maternal antibody provides any protective advantages to calves.\n\nKseniya Ratneva – Animal Science\n\nInside A Dog's Mind\n\nView poster\n\nProject Advisor(s): Cheryl Morris | Advisor(s): Jennifer Bundy\n\nAbstract (Click to view) Humans today consider dogs as their companions, family members, and an extension of themselves. Lack of awareness about dog behavior, how dogs express themselves to us, causes of behavioral issues, and limited resources to address issues all lead to dogs being surrendered to animal shelters. My objective was to write a young adult story with lighthearted sentiments while also including important information that present and future dog owners should learn. Dogs are a highly intelligent and socially complex species that we developed a strong relationship towards. It is our responsibility as pet owners to advocate for their welfare and develop a more accurate understanding of their behavior. This novel addresses several important topics, with each character representing a unique behavioral issue, welfare provision, and training method. This is done to explain each topic more thoroughly. The juvenile plot and illustrations are meant to attract Young Adult readers that want or currently own a dog in their household, as it is during this time that guardians will allocate further dog ownership responsibilities to this audience.\n\nJordan Rindels – Animal Science\n\nImproving Animal Welfare Through Outreach\n\nView poster\n\nProject Advisor(s): Cheryl Morris | Advisor(s): Jennifer Bundy\n\nAbstract (Click to view) As of 2022, 90.5 million US families own a pet, but nearly 8 million animals are surrendered to shelters yearly despite this growing number of pet owners. This project aims to create science-based fact sheets to increase the bond between people and their pets. I began this process by identifying three issues in animal science that I am passionate about: assistance animals, raw diets, and environmental enrichment. I developed clear and concise fact sheets on these topics using information from reputable online sources, previous coursework, and personal experiences. Each sheet was then saved and sent for further review. The next step of this project is to compile a database of fact sheets to develop and launch the Department of Animal Science Companion Animal Outreach website. Further evaluations will be done to determine effectiveness by tracking the number of website visits and PDF downloads. It is the department’s goal to highlight Iowa State as a reliable information hub for the general public.\n\nCarlie Seuferer – Biology (AGLS)\n\nUsing Pacemakers as an Intervention for Heart Defects Outside of Bradycardia\n\nView poster\n\nProject Advisor(s): Michael Lyons | Advisor(s): Em Kapler\n\nAbstract (Click to view) In this paper, I reviewed several articles on cardiac pacemakers, heart attacks, strokes, and high blood pressure to see if implanting cardiac pacemakers with auto-release medications, such as anticoagulants or vasodilators, would work in providing fast-acting relief in those experiencing a heart attack or stroke. I also did a cost-benefit analysis to see if, assuming clinical trials of auto-release medications proves successful, insurance companies would pay for these procedures to be done. I considered what mechanism in the heart would actually trigger the release of the medication; the indications and contraindications in patients; how to replace the medication when used or expired; and the time and cost of patient death, ambulance rides, and the likelihood of repeat incidences after the first heart attack or stroke. On top of my research of peer-reviewed articles online, I also outreached to the hospital where I work, Mary Greely Medical Center, to speak with Dr. Stuart Christenson and RN Lisa Seuferer. Dr. Christenson is a surgeon in the cath lab who puts in pacemakers nearly every day, and Lisa has worked in all areas of the hospital, including the ICCU. They both read my initial research, discussed both strengths and short comings in my ideas, and made suggestions of where I should take my research next. I filled in the blanks that they presented and found that with the use of auto-release medications, patients experiencing heart attacks and strokes would receive life-saving interventions at a much faster rate than ambulances are able to get to them, which would also save the hospital money.

This research focused on potential methods to improve soil quality through physical and chemical alterations, with specific attention given to how these techniques could be applied in areas with limited resource availability. Methods of physical alteration focused on soil manipulation to improve soil drainage and provide an opportunity to grow a household’s worth of vegetables much closer to home and with decreased water consumption. Chemical changes to the soil focus on the addition of organic matter through composted livestock manure or biochar to increase the moisture content in the soil, which is becoming more important as climate change continues to alter the rainfall patterns. During the research process, specific consideration was given to cassava, Irish potatoes, sweet potatoes, okra, bananas and beans because of their status as staple crops in the country and in the region. The ISU-UP encourages the growth of amaranth because it’s so nutritious- the local schools will sell it to get other grains and silverfish so it serves a dual purpose.\n\nChristina Speicher – Animal Science\n\nCharacterization of the Physiochemical Properties of Plant-Based Bigels in Comparison to Animal-Based Fats\n\nView poster\n\nProject Advisor(s): Rodrigo Tarte | Advisor(s): Sherrlyn Olsen\n\nAbstract (Click to view) Over the years, replacement of animal fat in course ground products has been challenging. Recently, biphasic gel (BPG) systems have been shown to be a potential solution. However, to have universal application, they should be made from plant-sourced ingredients. In this study, we developed and characterized two biphasic gels consisting of an oleogel (OG) phase (92.5% high-oleic soybean oil, 7.5% rice bran wax) and a hydrogel (HG) phase (96% water, 2% soy protein isolate, 2% k-carrageenan), combined in 5:5 and 4:6 OG:HG ratios. The BPGs were stored at 2-3°C for 28 days and analyzed every 7 days for color, Texture Profile Analysis (TPA), lipid oxidation, and pH. The color of 5:5 BPG was lighter than 4:6 BPG (P < .05), a difference that is unlikely to be of practical importance. No other color differences were observed. For texture, 4:6 BPG was more resilient than 5:5 BPG. Both gels were softer on day 7 and regained hardness thereafter. pH and lipid oxidation were unaffected by BPG formulation and storage time. Our results indicate that the two gels were comparable to each other in all attributes measured, and that they remained stable under refrigeration conditions up to 28 days.\n\nLilly Welsh – Environmental Science (AGLS), Global Resource Systems\n\nUsing Black Walnut Tree Rings as an Indicator of Water Table Levels\n\nView poster\n\nProject Advisor(s): Peter Moore | Advisor(s): Richard Williams, Amanda Chung\n\nAbstract (Click to view) Dendroecology studies ecological and environmental changes and how they influence tree rings. The purpose of this project is to determine if historic water availability in the floodplain and uplands along Iowa waterways influence growth in black walnut (Juglans nigra) as preserved in tree rings. Tree cores were collected from floodplain and upland sites in the Neal Smith National Wildlife Refuge and the Whiterock Conservancy in central Iowa. In total 48 tree cores (4 sets) were collected, processed, and dated. Ring widths were measured using a Velmex system and cross-dated using COFECHA software to produce a master chronology for each core group. Master chronologies were then detrended using the dplR package in RStudio. Streamflow data were acquired from nearby USGS gage stations. The annual cumulative water yield was calculated. Cross-correlation between the annual water yield and ring-width chronologies was computed using the ccf function in R and RStudio. In two of the chronologies, significant negative correlations were found with lags of 1-3 years, but no significant correlations were present in the other two. Lagged negative correlations suggest that some trees have suppressed growth in years following high streamflow. This preliminary study indicates that more research is required to better understand the relationship between black walnut tree ring growth and streamflow in Iowa.\n\nErin Zeka – Biology (AGLS)\n\nEffects of Singing on Spatiotemporal Parameters During Complex Walking Tasks\n\nView poster\n\nProject Advisor(s): Elizabeth Stegemoller | Advisor(s): Sarah Wehner\n\nAbstract (Click to view) Gait and balance impairment is one of the major symptoms of Parkinson’s Disease(PD)and can significantly impact functional mobility and quality of life in persons with PD. A key component in current pharmacological and surgical treatment is the use of levodopa to replace the deficiency of dopamine. Within the research on levodopa, there is conflicting results on how beneficial it is for gait and balance impairment. Further research has suggested that external cues may be helpful for gait and simple walking tasks. There is limited research on how self-produced external cuing, such as singing, affects the performance of complex walking tasks in persons with PD. To fully understand changes related to PD, data will be collected from healthy young adults between the ages of 18 and 35. In this study, healthy young adults will perform a series of walking tasks in random order over approximately 30 feet in length. The four walking conditions are as follows: 1) Overground walking at their preferred rate three times, 2) Overground walking while singing “Row your boat” three times, 3) Serpentine walking at their own pace three times, 4) Serpentine walking while singing “Row your boat” three times. Spatiotemporal measures obtained from sensors will be used to analyze differences in gait performance between these conditions. It is hypothesized that walking tasks accompanied by singing will increase accuracy while decreasing time and cadence compared to the control of walking with no singing. This study may provide evidence for a complementary therapeutic technique to improve complex walking and mobility in persons with PD.\n\nNayeli Acosta-Aviles – Apparel, Merchandising, and Design\n\nBoriquen\n\nView poster\n\nProject Advisor(s): Ling Zhang | Advisor(s): Sarah Frette\n\nAbstract (Click to view) Puerto Rico is a beautiful island located in the Caribbean Sea. Many have described it as paradise, and everyone who’s visited the island always speaks of its beauty. The island is my home, and it fills me with pride to call that little piece of land “mi tierra.” However, for this project, I wanted to focus not only on the beauty but also on the struggles that come with being Puerto Rican and living on the island. Every year from June until November, Puerto Ricans live in fear of the disaster the hurricane season will bring upon the island. For this project, I created a collection inspired by all the feelings that arose during those times and the beauty and pain of living on the island and going through these events. I experimented with different dyeing, printing, and knitting techniques to create three different looks that tell a story of pride, fear, perseverance, and beauty.\n\nSydney Kilfoyl – Event Management\n\nThe Ugly Truth of Imperfect Foods\n\nPoster not available online\n\nProject Advisor(s): EunHa Jeong | Advisor(s): Chad Reis\n\nAbstract (Click to view) Abstract will not be available online\n\nAudrey McMillan – Apparel, Merchandising, and Design, World Languages & Cultures\n\nConsumer-Driven Strategies for Increasing Innovate 1858's Market Penetration and Long-Term Brand Reach\n\nView poster\n\nProject Advisor(s): Linda Niehm | Advisor(s): Sarah Frette, Patrick Johnson\n\nAbstract (Click to view) Innovate 1858 is a student-operated retail store at Iowa State University. This study focused on an analysis of Innovate 1858 target customer segments (students, alumni, faculty/staff) and market factors that influence their purchase decisions and store attitude. Findings revealed that two critical elements informed customer loyalty, leading to improved business performance: 1) market penetration, or the success in selling a good or service in a specific market, and 2) brand reach, the number of people who come into contact with the brand. Data was collected through an online survey concerning attitudes towards Innovate 1858’s products, marketing, store channels, and brand image. Linear regression analysis revealed that customers’ opinion of Innovate 1858, outreach platforms used, and attitude towards promotions had a significant impact on understanding of the brand, accounting for 32.32% of explained variance. On average, alumni (μ=4.56) and faculty/staff (μ =4.48) were found to have a more favorable opinions of Innovate 1858 and its product assortment, while students had a more positive view of Innovate 1858’s social media use (μ =3.96). To increase market penetration and brand reach, Innovate 1858 should incorporate strategic promotions that appeal to its unique customer bases through targeted campaigns that address these elements and channels.\n\nSarah Petersen – Kinesiology & Health\n\nThe Relationship Between Modifiable Health Behaviors and Spirituality in Patients with Substance Use Disorder\n\nView poster\n\nProject Advisor(s): Jacob Meyer | Advisor(s): Lisa Phillips\n\nAbstract (Click to view) Spirituality-based substance-use disorder (SUD) treatment programs have been found to promote addiction recovery. Some programs also incorporate holistic wellness approaches targeting improved physical activity and sedentary behavior. The study aims to evaluate associations of physical activity, sedentary behavior, and spirituality in patients entering SUD treatment. Cross-sectional data of patients (n= 1,210) entering SUD treatment were analyzed. Variables of interest included spirituality (Religious Background and Behavior Questionnaire) and activity behaviors (International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form). Self-reported sedentary levels were coded based on the national average [>6 hours/day; high/low], and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) levels were coded based on meeting the recommended guidelines (≥ 150 minutes/week; yes/no). Welch’s two sample t-tests and effect sizes (Cohen’s d) showed a significant difference in spirituality scores based on meeting the guidelines (t(1105.3)= -5.66, p< 0.001, d=0.34). There was not a significant difference in spirituality based on self-reported sedentary behavior (t(1192.4)=-1.20, p=0.22, d=0.07). Overall, the results show that being physically active was more important for spirituality than having low sedentary time. As high spirituality is helpful in addiction recovery, our results suggest that increasing physical activity within SUD treatment could increase spirituality levels, which could lead those programs to have higher overall treatment success rates.\n\nHana Qamhieh – Kinesiology & Health\n\nThe Effects of Group Therapeutic Boxing on Mobility in Persons with Parkinson’s Disease\n\nView poster\n\nProject Advisor(s): Elizabeth Stegemoller | Advisor(s): Tom Parker\n\nAbstract (Click to view) Previous research suggests that Group Therapeutic Yoga (GTY) and Group Therapeutic Singing (GTS) could improve mobility in persons with Parkinson's disease (PD). The aim of this study is to determine if Group Therapeutic Boxing (GTB) shows similar improvements in mobility in persons with PD. A second aim is to determine how long improvements in mobility are sustained after GTB. We will examine the mobility of individuals with PD before and after boxing outreach groups (via the use of TUG - Timed Up and Go). Before the outreach groups, a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) along with all four parts of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) will be collected. After the outreach group, part 3 of the UPDRS will be collected immediately, 30 minutes, and 60 minutes after. We hypothesize that Boxing will show improvements in motor symptoms. Results from this study have the potential to demonstrate the effectiveness of boxing in improving mobility in persons with PD. This knowledge would support the implementation of group therapeutic activities (such as boxing).\n\nEmma Roush – Kinesiology & Health\n\nDevelopment of a Functional Myoelectric Prosthetic Device from a 3D Printed Hand Prototype\n\nView poster\n\nProject Advisor(s): Karri Haen | Advisor(s): Marsha Wissink\n\nAbstract (Click to view) 3D-printing has been applied in the development of customized devices for a wide range of biomedical applications including individualized prosthetics. In this project, we develop a fully adaptable electronics kit that can modify the eNABLE Phoenix v2.0 3D printed hand prototype into a fully functional myoelectric hand. Converting the body powered Phoenix hand into a myoelectric device that grasps in response to electromyographic (EMG) signals will increase the utility and dexterity of the original prototype. Development of a conversion kit and a publicly available instructional resource will allow end users of eNABLE prosthetics to easily modify body-powered prosthetics, allowing for myoelectric function.\n\nYara Salti – Kinesiology & Health\n\nEffects of Group Therapeutic Boxing on Motor Symptoms for People with Parkinson's\n\nView poster\n\nProject Advisor(s): Elizabeth Stegemoller | Advisor(s): Tom Parker\n\nAbstract (Click to view) Previous research suggests that Group Therapeutic Yoga and singing could improve motor symptoms in persons with Parkinson’s disease (PD).

This results in roughly $52 billion dollars in related costs and expenses.* PD is a chronic neurodegenerative disease which results in decreasing quality of life. Alternative forms of treatment, such as dancing and singing as opposed to medication, have been proposed. The Alternative Medicine and Music for Parkinson’s Disease (AMMPD) Lab at Iowa State University (ISU) provides boxing, dancing, yoga, and singing outreach groups for people with PD. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term effects of outreach groups on the health of people with PD. Outreach group members were recruited for participation. Ambulatory mobility was assessed using a six-minute walk test and kinematic information captured using wearable technology, OPALS. Quality of life was assessed using the Parkinson’s Disease questionnaire. Clinical symptoms were assessed using the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale. Cognitive function was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Physical Activity was assessed using an activPAL accelerometer. Assessments were conducted at baseline. Data will be analyzed using analysis of variance and regression. It is expected the findings from this study will shed light on the effects of the outreach programs and exercise in persons with PD. *Source: parkinson.org\n\nEmma Schluttenhofer – Elementary Education\n\nCritical Literacy for Elementary Children\n\nView poster\n\nProject Advisor(s): Missy Springsteen-Haupt | Advisor(s): Tonya Mccormick\n\nAbstract (Click to view) As a future elementary school teacher with endorsements in reading and language arts, I was interested in learning more about structured literacy during off times and its implication on learners. The project sought to examine the relationships between structured education and its direct effect on children’s literacy perspectives. Participants, at the targeted educational levels of kindergarten through fifth grade, were gathered for a qualitative interview to assess their personal attitudes on literacy. This initial interview served as the starting point for all participants. Following this interview, half of the participants, serving as the experimental group, were invited to attend a day-long literacy workshop that focused on the fundamental aspects of reading, writing, and speaking. The participants who attended this workshop were then re-interviewed for the second time with the same literacy-based questions. Those who did not attend the literacy workshop, serving as the control, were also re-interviewed around the same time with the exact same literacy-based questions. The responses from both groups were assessed and analyzed after the completion of the workshop. This analysis was done by comparing the responses between the first and second interviews, as well as comparing the responses between the experimental and control groups.\n\nPauline Scribano – Nutritional Science (H Sci)\n\nUHP Grant Recipient - Research funded in part by the Iowa State University Foundation\n\nResistant Starch and DNA Methylation in Diabetic Rats\n\nView poster\n\nProject Advisor(s): Kevin Schalinske | Advisor(s): Kevin Schalinske\n\nAbstract (Click to view) Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects 1 in 10 females. PCOS may be caused by various environmental and genetic factors and presents abnormalities such as hyperandrogenism and infertility. Looking at animal models of PCOS can demonstrate the pathways that mediate PCOS. Agouti mice present with PCOS as a consequence of their condition. Previous work at ISU has shown perturbation in one-carbon metabolism (OCM) which suggests path alterations during PCOS progression. The purpose of this research project was to see if this OCM irregularity led to alterations in DNA methylation.DNA was isolated from ovary tissue samples of agouti and lean control groups using a DNA isolation kit. The isolated DNA was then analyzed for methylation via a global DNA methylation ELISA. Results showed a significantly higher global methylation in the agouti samples. This suggests that OCM perturbation is responsible for the hypermethylation observed in agouti PCOS models.\n\nSura Smadi – Kinesiology & Health, Music (Curriculum)\n\nUHP Grant Recipient - Research funded in part by the Iowa State University Foundation\n\nSalivary Cortisol Levels of Marching Band Members\n\nView poster\n\nProject Advisor(s): Elizabeth Stegemoller | Advisor(s): Tom Parker, Kevin Judge\n\nAbstract (Click to view) Studies suggest that listening to music can decrease one’s blood pressure and reduce cortisol, a biomarker of stress. College students experience high levels of stress. Engagement in activities outside of academics is one strategy to deal with the high demands of college academics. The purpose of this study is to determine whether marching band rehearsal can have a significant impact on stress in college students. Ten marching band section leaders participated in this study. Before rehearsal, participants completed questionnaires, including demographic information and a daily diary. Next, participants were asked to fill out an affective slider test (AS) to rate on a scale of one to ten how angry, in control, happy, or sad they felt. Following that, participants filled out a perceived stress scale (PSS) and rated on a scale of 1-4 how they’ve felt in the past month. Participants then provided a saliva sample to obtain cortisol (Salimetrics®). After the full rehearsal, participants repeated the AS test and provided another saliva sample. We anticipate participants will demonstrate less stress after rehearsal, indicated by the AS test and a decrease in cortisol. These results may show that marching band is an effective way to lower stress in college students.\n\nMackenzie Thompson – Kinesiology & Health\n\nEffects of Singing on Complex Walking Tasks\n\nView poster\n\nProject Advisor(s): Elizabeth Stegemoller | Advisor(s): Lisa Phillips\n\nAbstract (Click to view) Gait and balance impairment is one of the major symptoms of Parkinson’s Disease (PD) and can significantly impact functional mobility and quality of life in persons with PD.

Puppets could offer an alternative choice, showcasing ensembles with movement and life without needing to find human models. They could also be a more accessible option for designers and audiences when putting on a fashion show, as they could be used in a wider variety of spaces and at a lower cost. Two puppets were constructed at different scales to test the effectiveness of different sizes as well as how effective they are in communicating the garments designed for them. Puppet mechanics, aesthetics, and resources were used as a framework to analyze the results.\n\nMatthew Decker – Civil Engineering\n\nSynopsis on the Affects of CSB-18-167\n\nView poster\n\nProject Advisor(s): Roy Sturgill | Advisor(s): Seth Loyd\n\nAbstract (Click to view) Subsurface utility engineering (SUE) is a branch of engineering involving mapping of utilities to the correct quality levels, utility relocation and design, and communication of important information to concerned parties.In 2017, the Colorado State Legislature passed a bill to require the use of SUE on many municipal and state projects based on project characteristics. The goal of this project is to investigate if DOT project data and utility damage prevention data demonstrate a savings and reduction in damages since enacting CSB-18-167. In addition, the project will compare DOT expenditures on SUE to determine if savings outweigh perceived costs. The work for this project will include a review of legislation, gathering and analysis of data relevant to costs and utility strikes, and analyze differences based on year-to-year data.\n\nShanna Fellows – Civil Engineering\n\nIowa's Shifting Ecology: Climate Change Effects through the 21st Century\n\nView poster\n\nProject Advisor(s): Lu Liu | Advisor(s): Seth Loyd\n\nAbstract (Click to view) Iowa's native prairie ecosystems have all but disappeared in Iowa, with less than 0.1% native prairie remaining within the state. If anthropogenic carbon emissions carry on at the current rate, our climate will continue to flux with increasingly extreme weather patterns that will take a significant toll on our ecology. This research will analyze state-of-the-art climate data to show how the changing temperatures and precipitation will affect Iowa’s ecology. The general effects to Iowa's ten ecoregions are discussed as well as a deeper look into the range shifts of three native Iowa species. The CMIP 6 data is analyzed through two climate change scenarios: a sustainable path (SSP126) and a path of fossil fuel development (SSP585). The analysis completed in this study showed range shifts are very species-dependent, but the determining factor is usually due to temperature changes. Statewide changes to precipitation are within ± 4% and were not significant enough to dramatically change the habitation patterns of any species. If we continue the path of fossil-fuel based economy (SSP585), by the 2090s, Iowa could experience average maximum temperatures as high as 35° C in the month of July, about 5° C higher than our current temperatures.\n\nJaden Forde – Software Engineering\n\nVisualization of Engineering Statics Concepts to Assist Student Learning\n\nView poster\n\nProject Advisor(s): Hartanto Wibowo | Advisor(s): Kate Jurgenson\n\nAbstract (Click to view) Although most engineering students are visual learners, there are very limited visualization tools that students can use to help with their learning, and most available tools are not user friendly. In this project, a physics-engine-based simulation library is utilized to create such visualization modules to be used in Engineering Statics course. Each module consists of a virtual model, accompanied by theoretical calculations and free-body diagrams whenever appropriate, in which the user can modify some key parameters. This way, users can not only visualize the problem but also actively interact with the model to deepen their understanding of the concept learned in class. This project combines engineering mechanics knowledge with programming skills using Python language, PyChrono physics library, and PyQt user interface library to create a software package comprising a series of executable files demonstrating some selected topics in Engineering Statics. Thus far, no similar software package exists. This project serves as a proof-of-concept prototype for more in-depth future research, showing that these software tools are viable to create educational and user-friendly Engineering Statics simulations in an interactive computer application package. This package could then be distributed to aid student learning.\n\nArvid Gustafson – Software Engineering\n\nA Federated Machine Learning System that Protects Privacy and Defends against Poisoning Attacks\n\nView poster\n\nProject Advisor(s): Wensheng Zhang | Advisor(s): Kate Jurgenson\n\nAbstract (Click to view) Machine learning involves using data to train a model called a neural network to produce desired results from given inputs. However, in order to train neural models, a lot of training must be done. Distributed machine learning models, like federated learning, have been developed to enable multiple computers (clients) to train the same model at once, and then periodically send their progress to a server, which aggregates those changes made to the initial model into a new model, and sends it back out to each client. However, distributed systems come with their own security risks that must be dealt with. To deal with some of these security concerns, we have used Microsoft SEAL's homomorphic encryption library to design and implement a proof-of-concept federated machine learning model with the following objectives: 1) To defend against bad data acquired from malevolent or incompetent clients computers; 2) To protect the confidentiality of each client's identity and data when the server delegates aggregation tasks to an external, rich execution environment, like cloud servers.\n\nMax Hammer – Aerospace Engineering\n\nExploiting Assume-Guarantee Contract Patterns to Optimize the Discovery of Design-Space Dependencies\n\nView poster\n\nProject Advisor(s): Kristin Rozier | Advisor(s): Elizabeth Gillmore\n\nAbstract (Click to view) Model-checking large and extensive sets of requirements for a system often means tackling the challenging problem of state-space explosion The Discovering of Design-space Dependencies (D3) algorithm exploits relationships within systems in order to optimize the model-checking search. By incorporating Assume-Guarantee Contracts into the existing D3 algorithm, it is possible to further exploit the known patterns of the requirements in order to further reduce the model checking complexity. We detail a set of different variations for optimizing D3 processing that exploits patterns present in Assume-Guarantee Contracts. Additionally, we are able to use this exploitation to provide vacuity checking for specificai9onts within the contract. We identify requirements that are unable to enter undesired states or provides expected results due to the nature of the requirement's patterns.\n\nKhanh Hoang – Aerospace Engineering\n\nAutonomous Flight for a Quadcopter Drone\n\nPoster will not be available online\n\nProject Advisor(s): Kristin-Yvonne Rozier | Advisor(s): Tyler Hoenig\n\nAbstract (Click to view) As the usage of unmanned aerial vehicles becomes more practical for surveillance, land surveying, and package delivery, university students will likely want to get hands-on experience with these drones for their careers. In addition, people will want to know how to program drones for flights without manually controlling the aircraft to avoid possible danger, gather consistent data, and expedite the pilot work. Therefore, I am providing documentation on building and writing an autonomous mission for a quadcopter, specifically for the Holybro S500 with the Pixhawk 6C flight controller, using the open-source code MAVSDK in C++. There are currently countless drone assemblies with different methods, languages, and operating systems for programming them, but I am providing one straightforward approach for college-level students.\n\nJosh Holtzleiter – Mechanical Engineering\n\nDevelopment and Characterization of a Condensation-based Device for Collecting Aerosolized Nanoparticles\n\nPoster not available online\n\nProject Advisor(s): Todd Kingston | Advisor(s): Kirsten Hauge\n\nAbstract (Click to view) Abstract will not be available online.\n\nGregory Ling – Computer Engineering\n\nUHP Grant Recipient - Research funded in part by the Iowa State University Foundation\n\nEmbedded Testing Platform (Compute Tester) for Solar Car Club\n\nView poster\n\nProject Advisor(s): Nathan Niehart | Advisor(s): Vicky Thorland-Oster\n\nAbstract (Click to view) Solar Car Club uses a collection of small printed circuit boards we call compute modules throughout the car. These are the primary programmable unit used in every application board in the car that requires software functionality and communicate among themselves through a large CAN bus. These are critical systems in our car, but we have no reasonable means of diagnosing failures or verifying that a newly-assembled compute is safe to use in the car.For this project, I created a handheld testing unit into which a Compute module (S+ or Nano form factor) can be inserted. It has the ability to test the power-on sequence, identify solder bridges, check the ADC and DAC readings are reasonable, and verify the CAN transceiver is working appropriately. In addition, the tester has the ability to store the current car's firmware in an on-board micro SD card and reprogram new compute modules in the field, an external CAN connector to aid in full-vehicle debugging, and a battery for mobile operation. This project focused on the hardware design and verification of the tester, and I am currently guiding new members in writing firmware for the tester to help them explore more complex embedded programming tasks.\n\nMatthew Mehrtens – Aerospace Engineering\n\nImpact of Mesh Density and Gradient Accuracy on Computational Fluid Dynamic Analysis and Optimization\n\nView poster\n\nProject Advisor(s): Ping He | Advisor(s): Elizabeth Gillmore\n\nAbstract (Click to view) To determine whether the density or error of an aerodynamic mesh generated with OpenFOAM has a significant effect on the accuracy and efficacy of computational fluid dynamic (CFD) optimization, we performed several different optimizations on the Onera M6 wing. For each optimization, we varied the mesh density, the amount of error, and certain aerodynamic characteristics to quantitatively demonstrate the optimal mesh density and error. In the end, we found that a moderately refined mesh with approximately 5% or less gradient error generated optimal optimization results for the Onera M6 wing - taking into account the time required to complete the optimization and the resultant reduction in drag.\n\nAline Milach Teixeira – Chemical Engineering\n\nInvestigating the Septu Antiphage Defense System\n\nView poster\n\nProject Advisor(s): Dipali Sashital | Advisor(s): Matthew Brown\n\nAbstract (Click to view) Antiphage defense systems have evolved for millions of years in the arms race between bacteria and viruses. While some systems are well-known, renewed interest in this area due to CRISPR-Cas research has led to the discovery of new defense systems. Recent studies have determined that Septu defense systems are effective at protecting Bacillus thuringiensis from phages in the Myoviridae family, but questions remain as to why or how this phenomenon occurs. My project investigates the hypothesis that the organism relies on an ATPase to unwind the DNA, and the endonuclease to cleave the resulting single-stranded phage DNA in order to protect the host cell. Through this project, we have discovered the tentative biochemical structure of the alleged ATPase protein using AlphaFold and Cryo-EM technologies, determining that it assembles as a tetramer. Further research must be done towards the characterization of the biochemical activity of the two individual proteins, and how they work together in a complex.\n\nShelby Murray – Computer Engineering\n\nExamining Emergency Operations Centers\n\nView poster\n\nProject Advisor(s): Clayton Oliver | Advisor(s): Vicky Thorland-Oster\n\nAbstract (Click to view) In emergency management, an emergency operation center (EOC) manages resources, communication, and coordination to prepare for a disaster and respond if one occurs. This project examined the differences between Iowa State University’s EOC and those of a similar size and purpose - primarily other universities. By comparing the collected information, aspects where Iowa State’s EOC is ahead of the standard were identified, and suggestions were made to improve its capability in the future. The research focused on an EOC’s structure, resources, involved personnel, and general activation response. FEMA training, observed EOC activation, official documentation, and interviews served as primary sources. The compiled research and drawn conclusions were shared with interested parties, and connections between other emergency management departments strengthened for future collaboration.\n\nConnor Ryan – Electrical Engineering\n\nSoftware-Defined Radio Imaging Radar\n\nView poster\n\nProject Advisor(s): Mohammad Al Qaseer | Advisor(s): Vicky Thorland-Oster\n\nAbstract (Click to view) The Center for Nondestructive Evaluation at Iowa State University has developed advanced synthetic aperture radar (SAR) algorithms for imaging. The applications for the nondestructive evaluation techniques are limited by reliance on expensive lab equipment like Vector Network Analyzers (VNA). The imaging methods depend on the VNA's accurate magnitude and phase response measurement across a frequency sweep. Software-defined radios (SDR) present a possible alternative for data collection at a fraction of the cost. The BladeRF 2.0 micro xA9 was selected for a frequency range reaching 6 GHz with transmit and receive capabilities. Software scripts were developed in Python to transmit a user-created signal modulated to the desired frequency. The program was then expanded to allow the device to perform a frequency sweep. The receiving capabilities were tested by attaching the transmitting port to the receiving port and comparing the transmitted and received signal. The device was interfaced with 2D scanners to collect data by scanning a test target. SAR imaging methods were applied to the collected data to evaluate using SDRs for radar.\n\nJohn Scalise – Mechanical Engineering\n\nAnalysis of gearboxes for a NASA robotic mobility system\n\nView poster\n\nProject Advisor(s): James Heise | Advisor(s): Alyssa Stafne\n\nAbstract (Click to view) This project will optimize the mass and manufacturability of Cardinal Space Mining’s robotic drivetrain, while increasing the operational efficiencies of the system.

With its wide range of material compatibility, AJP is useful for prototyping and low-volume production. In addition, it is useful in many sensor applications. For this project, using AJP to develop surface-integrated temperature sensing devices, particularly thermistors, was of interest. Temperature is an important factor in the functionality of many designs and can be the difference between a design functioning properly or failing catastrophically. Especially in electric cars, temperature is a critical design factor, where overheating can lead to batteries exploding or starting on fire. Although monitoring temperature with non-printed thermistors is possible, AJP is a way to directly integrate thermistors onto surfaces without the extra processes for attachment needed by non-printed thermistors. To support the development of printed thermistor design, this project focused on characterizing the nickel oxide ink used for printing and creating modeling methods for NTC thermistors. While complications with the ink characterization process inhibited the design of reliable printed thermistors, a modeling methodology was created to accurately depict resistance versus temperature behavior for future printed designs.\n\nKatie Wyatt – Industrial Engineering\n\nPredicting Urgency of Echocardiograms at Mayo Clinic for Improved Scheduling\n\nView poster\n\nProject Advisor(s): Qing Li | Advisor(s): Devna Popejoy-Sheriff\n\nAbstract (Click to view) An echocardiogram (“echo”) detects heart problems, and Mayo Clinic performs over 75,000 of these tests each year. With hundreds of echoes performed daily, Mayo Clinic desires a quicker way to make echo scheduling decisions that effectively prioritize hospital resources. For this project, I developed predictive models to determine key traits that indicate if an echo patient should be seen urgently. I developed the models in R using four algorithms: random forest, decision tree, naive Bayes, and logistic regression. The models revealed two top indicators of urgency: patients not having a next appointment scheduled at the time of the echo and experiencing chest pain or shortness of breath. Both of these characteristics indicate a patient should be scheduled urgently.\n\nWilliam Zogg – Computer Engineering\n\nVisualization of Machine Learning Accelerator\n\nView poster\n\nProject Advisor(s): Henry Duwe | Advisor(s): Vicky Thorland-Oster\n\nAbstract (Click to view) In a machine learning hardware development course at ISU (CprE 487/587), students will undergo a lab where they develop a machine learning accelerator. To improve the experience and foster learning, we aim to create a harness to let students insert their accelerator design and intuitively experience the impact of design optimizations. Our harness interfaces with input storage, memory, and an HDMI display. The displayed visual representation lets students explore many aspects of machine learning optimizations discussed in lecture such as pruning and variable-precision while being able to see the affects of their implementations on latency and accuracy. Supported accelerators target image classification. The harness utilizes a VHDL pipeline running on a ZEDboard (an embedded systems FPGA prototyping platform). This pipeline is fed by an ARM CPU and includes a memory transaction interface, HDMI output, and a block where students can insert their accelerator. Our initial implementation supports 111 images per second via the ImageNET dataset. During the Fall 2023 offering of the course the usability will be evaluated as students use the framework.\n\nJoe Zuber – Computer Engineering\n\nUnderstanding the Environment with LiDAR\n\nView poster\n\nProject Advisor(s): Mohamed Selim | Advisor(s): Vicky Thorland-Oster\n\nAbstract (Click to view) Tracking team attendance in Team-Based Learning (TBL) environments may not seem difficult or time consuming, but this can take up hours of valuable time throughout an entire semester. With the rise of deep learning neural networks, generalized tools can easily detect the presence of a person with camera data, but there are unfortunately many privacy concerns when using cameras, such as facial recognition. We explore the development of a custom solution using a Light Detection and Ranging sensor (LiDAR) and a simple Neural Network. LiDAR works by sending beams of light out one point at a time and measuring the time it takes them to return, which allows it to calculate the distance a point is from a sensor and over a short period of time create a three dimensional point cloud of the area. We were able to modify this information to be more friendly to a Neural Network with a preprocessing step, and the resulting trained network was highly accurate, able to correctly guess the number of people at a table nearly 80% of the time. Our work suggests that with a deep enough network and enough training data, a generalized LiDAR solution is within reach.\n\nAlly Abel – Biological/Pre Medical Illustration\n\nUHP Grant Recipient - Research funded in part by the Iowa State University Foundation\n\n3D Models as a Tool for Learning Dogfish Shark Anatomy: An Analysis of Student Satisfaction\n\nView poster\n\nProject Advisor(s): Roxanne Ziman | Advisor(s): Elizabeth Zimmerman\n\nAbstract (Click to view) To come\n\nKiernan Adair – Genetics (LAS)\n\nRole of Gap Junction Proteins on Left-Right Axis Development in Zebrafish\n\nView poster\n\nProject Advisor(s): Jeffrey Essner | Advisor(s): Alison Esser\n\nAbstract (Click to view) In zebrafish, gap junction proteins are important for cell to cell communication. Previous research has revealed that knock downs of gap junction protein gamma 4b (gjc4b) result in disruption of the L-R organizer, Kupffer's Vesicle (KV), and correlated randomization of L-R symmetry (Hatler et al., 2009). Here, we have selected related gap junction proteins determined by phylogenetic analysis and targeted them using short homology directed knock ins or gene deletions.\n\nMackenzee Ashcroft – Psychology\n\nSocial Media, Body Image, & the Big Five Personality Traits\n\nView poster\n\nProject Advisor(s): Kevin Blankenship | Advisor(s): Zack Bonner\n\nAbstract (Click to view) The purpose of this study is to identify which of the Big Five personality traits are related to negative affect when individuals are shown a #fitspo image (#fitspo – “fitness inspiration”; photos of models). Previous research provides evidence that social media posts of fit persons have a negative effect on body satisfaction. However, relatively little research has examined the role personality variables play in these negative effects of #fitspo posts on body satisfaction. Through an online survey, participants (college-aged men/women) are asked their gender and are directed to a #fitspo image that corresponds to their gender. After viewing this image for 15 seconds, participants view themselves in a mirror for 15 seconds. Participants then fill out a questionnaire including measures: a general social media usage subscale and attitude scale, Multidimensional Body-Self Relations Questionnaire, Body Appreciation Scale 2, and Big 5 Inventory. A multiple linear regression will be conducted with scores from the Body Appreciation Scale as the dependent variable and the five personality subscales from the Big 5 Personality Inventory as the independent variables. Pearson correlations will be conducted to examine the relation between the amount of time participants spend on social media and their scores on the Body Appreciation Scales. I predict that those who score high in conscientiousness or neuroticism will be positively related to increased negative emotional reactions to #fitspo images. Further, I am predicting that those who score high in extraversion, openness, and agreeableness will not have as strong of a negative emotional reaction when shown #fitspo images. In other words, those scoring higher in those three traits will have a much weaker relation to negative emotional reactions. If the predictions show true, further research on coping techniques for patients that are triggered by social media posts could be explored that pertain specifically to personality traits.\n\nBrianna Baker – Psychology\n\nEffects of Second Language Learning on Anxiety and Depression\n\nView poster\n\nProject Advisor(s): John Grundy | Advisor(s): Whitney Baker\n\nAbstract (Click to view) Recent research has suggested a correlation between bilingualism and rearrangement of white matter within the brain, increasing white matter integrity and longevity. There have also been studies showing that mood disorders may correlate with abnormal white matter structure. This study explores if white matter changes due to bilingualism will have any effect on symptoms of mood disorders, specifically using anxiety and depression. We assess anxiety levels by using the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and depression levels by using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). After analyzing the data, we found little to no evidence of any difference in total STAI scores based on whether the participants were bilingual or monolingual. We also found little to no evidence of any difference in CES-D scores based on whether the participants were bilingual or monolingual. We conclude that while this study contains limitations, and more research should be done, there is no evidence in this study suggesting that bilingualism has any effects of symptoms of mood disorders.\n\nJacob Beattie – Mathematics, Computer Science\n\nInformation, AI, and their Application to Card Games\n\nView poster\n\nProject Advisor(s): Jack Lutz | Advisor(s): Emily Olson, Sita Molacek\n\nAbstract (Click to view) Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning that enables an agent to learn through trial and error by giving the agent feedback on its actions, maximizing its expected reward. To test if the inclusion of entropy within a reinforcement learning architecture improves its performance, 3 reinforcement learning models were trained at playing Euchre using value approximation Q-learning. One model was given the expected win rate of each card in hand, one the entropy of each card in hand, and one was a control. The average win rates of each model after training were compared using two-sample t-tests. The results showed a statistically significant difference between the win rates of the models equipped with win rate or entropy and the standard model, with no significant difference between the entropy and win rate models. This suggests that entropy may be applied in reinforcement learning architectures, improving their performance and accuracy. Similar methods can be used for analyzing real world problems with similar uncertainty.\n\nClaire Beaudry – Philosophy\n\nThe Unpainted and Painted Sculptures of Antiquity\n\nView poster\n\nProject Advisor(s): Rachel Meyers | Advisor(s): Alissa Whitmore\n\nAbstract (Click to view) Throughout history, Greek and Roman statues have been praised for their participation in the (Platonic) form of beauty. As 'beauty' changes, so too does the perceptual experience of the statues. Despite the drastic difference between visual impressions of the statues today compared to when they were created, they remain in what we consider beautiful. Ancient cities were significantly more colorful than remembered. Marble buildings and statues were painted with polychromatic techniques to enliven them; however, this has predominantly been left out of history. In the “rediscovery” of the Greek marbles, some archeologists scrubbed off impurities, which they did not realize were ancient pigments. Johann Joachim Winckelmann and other historians’ aesthetic preferential debates of form versus color altered the records of original polychromy. The conception of white statues has been manipulated to advance corrupt views- one of the most extreme being Hitler’s obsession with them. Fortunately, as technology advances, we become more aware of this error. The two most influential scientists, Vinzenz Brinkmann and Ulrike Koch-Brinkmann, have been creating awareness about the original vibrancy and acknowledging history’s mistakes. Despite the fluctuation of aesthetic appreciation, the beauty of ancient statues should be recognized alongside historically accurate information.\n\nEmma Brady – Geology\n\nScience Hall I Display Case Redesign\n\nView poster\n\nProject Advisor(s): Kristie Franz | Advisor(s): Em Kapler\n\nAbstract (Click to view) The previous Geology display cases in Science Hall I are dated, dusty, and unpleasing to the eye.

Previous research indicates that there is still debate among researchers whether the general population of Americans have become more polarized. Additionally, research showed that polarization may be negatively related to the use of television and radio (Campante and Hojman 79-80). However, Dr. Benjamin Warner determined that the internet may have a different effect. This quantitative research study adds to previous research by providing thorough analysis of self-identified Democrats, Republicans, and independents attitudes towards the Democratic and Republican Party over an extended period, from 1980-2020. Furthermore, ANES data highlighted how television, radio, and magazine usage has shifted, in addition to how trust in media has changed. Overlapping these results presents the idea that while polarization has increased in recent years, along with decreasing trust in the media, it cannot be determined that there is a correlation between different media types and affect polarization.\n\nSophie Byroade – English\n\nChild Exploitation on Social Media\n\nView poster\n\nProject Advisor(s): Alissa Stoehr | Advisor(s): C Langenberg\n\nAbstract (Click to view) As social media continues to change the ways we communicate, it also has made a new hunting ground for predators. We have seen a rise in child exploitation and grooming on social media platforms. In response, many organizations are finding new ways to keep our children safe in a world where anyone can contact them. For this project, I have done copious amount of research online, as well as talked to members of Internet Crimes Against Children task forces.With the information I have gathered while researching this topic, I have crafted a \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" story that highlights the ways predators may try and exploit children online. The main character has many choices she must make when messaged by someone she doesn't know online. I believe having scenarios where children can practice online safety can help them build confidence in their ability to say no and spot suspicious activity.\n\nGabrielle Finberg – Biology (LAS)\n\nThermastop rt-PCR Analysis\n\nView poster\n\nProject Advisor(s): Phillip Gauger | Advisor(s): Jennifer Owens\n\nAbstract (Click to view) Non-specific amplification may occur during polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays when the DNA polymerase binds cDNA targets at temperatures below 50°C. The outcome includes potential false positive results or aberrant amplification curves that reduces the specificity of the assay. Non-specific amplification during PCR occurs more often at low starting temperatures when non-specific binding may occur. ThermaGenix thermastop is a proprietary additive for PCR reactions that functions to bind the DNA polymerase at temperatures below 50°C and prevent non-specific binding to reduce false positive results and improve the specificity of the assay. Another special property of thermastop is to continue functioning at low temperatures during subsequent cycles of the PCR reaction after being denatured to prevent non-specific amplification as the reaction continues. The application of the thermostop product was evaluated at the Iowa State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (ISU VDL) to improve the results of assays with low specificity or issues with aberrant amplification. This included the following RT-rtPCR or rtPCR assays: Bovine respiratory multiplexed PCR panel (BCoV, BoHV-1, BRSV, BVDV), GPS (Glaesserella parasuis) genotyping multiplexed PCR, and the small ruminant abortion panel (Toxoplasma gondii, Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter fetus, Coxiella burnetii, Chalamydia abortus, and Caprine herpesvirus). Results after including thermastop at varying concentrations in the PCR master mix produced no evidence of assay improvement or substantial change in both real time and gel-based PCR for these assays. However, thermastop has been applied to Sanger sequencing assays and improved results during amplification. In the future, the ISU VDL will develop an oligonucleotide with ThermaGenix as a proprietary product for continued use in PCR assays that have demonstrated improvement in results when included.\n\nReece Gardner – Biochemistry\n\nPreventing Aspartimide Formation using a Thioimidate as a Protecting Group\n\nView poster\n\nProject Advisor(s): Brett VanVeller | Advisor(s): Elizabeth Zimmerman\n\nAbstract (Click to view) Peptide synthesis is an integral component of the modern chemist’s toolbox, with its reach extending from drug design to material science. Despite being a mature synthetic technique, peptide synthesis is still plagued by undesired side products, affecting the yield and purity of the final target compound. More specifically, aspartimide is one of the most common side products encountered in peptide synthesis, being produced following the ring closure of its parent amino acid, aspartate. Most protecting group strategies suffer from tedious transformations that sometimes fail to completely negate the aspartimide byproduct. In this work, we identify the thioimidate - an isostere of the canonical amide bond - as an easy-to-install and potentially robust protecting group to prevent aspartimide formation. Experimentally, the proclivity towards aspartimide formation was investigated in three peptide backbone isosteres: the canonical oxoamide, the thioamide, and the thioimidate. After exposing all motifs to base, the thioimidate was the only isostere that did not suffer from aspartimide formation.\n\nBenjamin Goodall – Computer Science, Mathematics\n\nMolecular Programming Teaching Tool and Serious Games\n\nPoster not available online\n\nProject Advisor(s): James Lathrop | Advisor(s): Erin Valerio-Garsow, Erin Valerio-Garsow\n\nAbstract (Click to view) Abstract will not be available online.\n\nPeyton Hamel – English\n\nThe Modern Retelling of Frankenstein\n\nView poster\n\nProject Advisor(s): Jacob Dawson | Advisor(s): Christiana Langenberg\n\nAbstract (Click to view) Mary Shelley's 'Frankenstein' is one of the first of its kind, pioneering science fiction to the forefront of creative writing by combining questionably moral scientific experimentation with an enticing plot. Shelley presents morality and ethics within the science fiction realm, which has continued to evolve decades after its release. Today, science has developed new moral codes and ethics boundaries that were foreign to Shelley's imagination. A modern retelling of 'Frankenstein' is not only a riveting option, but a necessary one due to the progression of science. This perspective of 'Frankenstein' will question modern science experimentation as well as integrate important modern issues such as bioethics and feminism within science. It will echo important plot points of 'Frankenstein' but will be its own piece of work in order to achieve its goals. The novella consists of two scientists, Dr. Angie Malloy and Dr. Mina Newton, who bring a corpse back to life with accurate scientific methods. Angie and Mina want to chase their science ambitions, but within the bounds of a moral ethical code. They question how far science should go throughout their experiments as well as what sacrifices they are willing to make in order to achieve discovery.\n\nJamie Hefley – Biological/Pre Medical Illustration\n\nIllustrations for DNR Water Trail Interpretation Panels\n\nView poster\n\nProject Advisor(s): Kim Moss | Advisor(s): Elizabeth Zimmerman\n\nAbstract (Click to view) To come\n\nNethmi Hewage – Chemistry\n\nSynthesis of novel silver tetrel pnictide materials for thermoelectric properties\n\nPoster not available online\n\nProject Advisor(s): Kirill Kovnir | Advisor(s): Elizabeth Zimmerman\n\nAbstract (Click to view) Abstract will not be available online\n\nEvan Hilton – Computer Science, Bioinformatics & Computational Biology\n\nFor a Better Vote: Assessing Alternative Voting Systems\n\nView poster\n\nProject Advisor(s): David Peterson | Advisor(s): Erin Valerio-Garsow, Alison Esser\n\nAbstract (Click to view) A voting system is an algorithm that takes as input information from voters in the form of ballots and produces as output one or more candidates to be elected. Many voting systems have been used, either historically or in the modern day, and many more have been discovered, designed, or invented. The most common voting system in use in the United States is first-past-the-post. However, most election scientists agree that first-past-the-post is one of the worst voting systems in terms of producing results desired by the electorate. Namely, first-past-the-post is a critical driver in preventing third parties from obtaining representation. The culmination of this project is a video series that serves as an informal literature review and a basic introduction to the most commonly advocated for alternatives to first-past-the-post in the United States. Each video explains the mechanics of how one particular voting system works along with an example, with the final video discussing the comparative advantages and disadvantages of each alternative.\n\nDaniel Howell – Chemistry\n\nExploration of Titania-Silica Nanosheets as Catalysts for Plastic Upcycling\n\nPoster not available online\n\nProject Advisor(s): Wenyu Huang | Advisor(s): Elizabeth Zimmerman\n\nAbstract (Click to view) Abstract will not be available online.\n\nAlex Huynh – Computer Science, Mathematics\n\nInvestigating Skin Cancer Diagnosis with Machine Learning: A Comparative Study of Feature Selection and Feature Extraction Techniques\n\nView poster\n\nProject Advisor(s): Man Basnet | Advisor(s): Deborah Holmes, Deborah Holmes\n\nAbstract (Click to view) Machine learning algorithms have a wide range of applications, including image classification, which utilizes past data to predict future outcomes. This project focuses on the classification of skin cancer images into binary or multi-class categories, where binary classification distinguishes between cancerous and benign images, and multi-class classification categorizes images into one of seven diagnoses. The major difficulty arises from the high dimensionality of skin cancer image as individual pixels may or may not provide useful information. To address this issue, we explore a range of feature selection (resizing, Lasso, Select K best) and feature extraction (PCA, deep learning) techniques commonly used to reduce dimensionality. The reduced images are then evaluated using three popular classification models: LightGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost. We use a comprehensive dataset, the HAM10000, which includes over 10,000 skin cancer images. Our findings reinforce the literature that deep learning is an effective technique for reducing dimensionality and improving classification performance, outperforming other feature selection and feature extraction methods.\n\nAbby Keiser – Biology (LAS)\n\nUHP Grant Recipient - Research funded in part by the Iowa State University Foundation\n\nThe Effects of Footwear and Barefoot Conditions on Balance Performance in Slacklining\n\nView poster\n\nProject Advisor(s): Jason Gillette | Advisor(s): Lauren Ramos\n\nAbstract (Click to view) Slacklining is a dynamic balance activity performed on a narrow webbing tensioned between two points with applications in leisure and rehabilitation. Most studies examine if slackline training improves balance in non-task-specific areas (Donath et al., 2013; Fernández-Rio et al., 2019; Giboin et al., 2018). However, few studies examine conditions affecting balance during slacklining. This study investigated balance performance when wearing athletic shoes compared to barefoot during single-leg standing on a slackline. Participants included eleven healthy young adults performing three trials of single-leg standing of up to 30 seconds barefoot and with athletic shoes on a 10 ft free-standing slackline. Balance time and kinematic data from reflective markers on the wrists, shoulders, heels, toes, and sacrum were collected using a 12-camera Qualisys Motion Capture System. There was a significant increase in balance time in the barefoot condition compared to the athletic shoes condition (p=0.020). Additionally, the 50th percentile velocity of the balancing foot on the slackline was significantly lower in the barefoot condition (p=0.045). These results suggest that slacklining while barefoot improves performance by increasing the stability of the balancing foot. Future studies should examine slackline balance while barefoot versus wearing athletic shoes in tasks of greater difficulty such as walking.\n\nZoey McEvoy – Linguistics, Mathematics\n\nUniversity Level Spanish Students’ Perception of Stop Consonants In-context and Isolation\n\nView poster\n\nProject Advisor(s): John Levis | Advisor(s): Isabella Perksen, Emily Olson\n\nAbstract (Click to view) The acquisition of native-like perception is a skill with many obstacles.
