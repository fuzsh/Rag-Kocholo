        "text": "(Hazrat) Amir Khusrau (Aslo Khusro): The great sufi saint, poet and musician, Amir Khusrau was born in Patiali town in Etah district (Now in Uttar Pradesh) in the year 1193. His father’s name was Amir Saifuddin. Khusrau is regarded as the first poet of Hindustani language that later branched out in Urdu and Hindi. Though he also wrote verses in Persian, but he is highly regarded for his poetry in Hindustani language and his contribution to Indian classical music. The verses composed by him have met with tremendous popularity and even after 750 years, qawwals start their qawwali sessions with one or other of his ghazals, dohas and bands. Amir Khusrau is also credited with invention of table by bifurcating pakhawaj and initiated several Raags as well. Amir Khusrau, revered as Hazrat Amir Khusrau due to his being a disciple of Hazrat Nizamuddin Aula (RA), saw the era of 11 kings from Ghiasuddin Balban to Nasiruddin Mohammad Tughaq and remained a respectable member of their courts. In the era of Alauddin Khilji, he was decorated with the honour of “Tuti-e-Hind” for his poetic excellence. Amir Khusrau also won the title of “Naik” in music. According to Allama Shibli, he got this title after defeating Gopal, who was the champion musician in his era. His famous doha; Gauri sowe sej par, mukh par daare kes Chal Khusrau ghar aapne, ren bhai chahu des Is generally sung by qawwals when he start their qawwali session. It is said that Amir Khusrau had come out with this doha spontaneously after the death of Hazrat Nizamuddin Aulia RA. According to historians, Amir Khusrau was on the military excursion of Tabarhut. When he returned to Delhi, Amir Khusrau he came to know about the death of Hazrat Nizamuddin Aulia RA. He immediately rushed to the grave of the Hazrat blackening his face and said this doha.\n\nBiography of Mohammad Quli Qutb Shah\n\nMuhammad Quli Qutb Shah (Sultan Muhammad Quli Qutub Shah) was the fifth sultan of the Qutb Shahi (Qutub Shahi) dynasty of Golkonda in south India. He founded the city of Hyderabad, India and built its architectural centerpiece, the Charminar. He was an able administrator and his reign is considered one of the high points of the Qutb Shahi dynasty. Some say that he named the city in honour of Imam Ali (as), who was known as the Hyder.He ascended to the throne in 1580 at the age of 15 and ruled for thirty-one years.He modelled the well planned city of Hyderabad on the then legendary city of Esfahan of Persia, in his words \"unparalleled in the world and a replica of heaven itself”.\n\nHistory\n\nSultan Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah was the third son of Ibrahim Quli Qutb Shah. He founded the city of Hyderabad, India ,after shifting from his old capital, the fort of Golkonda. The city was built on the southern bank of the Muchkunda river later known as Musi River. Some say that Muhammad Quli Qutub Shah sent for architects from Iran to lay out the city, which was built on a grid plan. History mentions that he himself had studied many architectural plans and with consistent consultations with his wife Bhagamati and his Prime Minister Mir Muhammed Momin, he carried out roads and buildings etc., with his help. Sultan Muhammed Quli Qutub shah founded the city of Bhaganagar in 1591. Prince Muhammed Quli, fell in love with her so much that he wished to marry her;but the same was not possible at that time because of stiff objections by Muslims in general of that time. In 1578 AD, prince Muhammed Quli endangering his life, had physically crossed the river Musi, as he wished to explore the Southern territory of the river for finding suitable location for his new dream city. He found the province of Chichlam village sacredly suitable for establishment of his New city. On receipt of the news of the life danger to his son Prince Muhammed Quli, Ibrahim Qutubshah, ordered to construct a new bridge in place of the dilapidated ruinous old bridge. Accordingly a new bridge named \"PUL-e-NARVA” now known as \"Purana Pul” was constructed in 1579 AD facilitating the frequent meetings of the prince, with hisam village. As per one of the reference books, the date of construction is also inscribed on one of the pillars of this pul. Landmarks of the Deccan by Shri. Ali Asgar Bilgrami.Reference books like; 400 years of Hyderabad by Shri K. Chandraiah (1996) and Tarikh-e-Tufani (History of floods in Hyderabad) by Shri Pandit Kishan Rao of Mushir Decccan News paper, Sangayachay Mala, Marathi book,can be referred, used. It is important to note that in spite of the serious objection in the capital, Muhammad Quli Qutub Shah married in 1589 AD after waiting for 11 years of his first meeting with his beloved. After his marriage with Bhagyamati, he laid the foundation of charminar in 1589 AD before establishment of the City of Bhaganagar, located in chichlam village, after the Plague epidemic that had ravaged the city.in 1591 AD. In 1605 AD,the name of the city Bhagyanagar,was changed to Hyderabad. After Bhagyamati was converted to Muslim religion,the name of Bhagamati was changed and was named as Begum Hyder Mahal The name of the city was named as, Hyderabad.after her. Some say that.. Hyderabad was named as the City of Hyder after the title of the Imam Ali (as). Many people though, commonly believe that the city of \"Hyderabad” was named after the people as their residence as \"City of the Brave” from the Persian words \"Hyder/Haider” (Persian and Urdu meaning lion or brave and \"Abad/Abaad” (Persian and Urdu meaning abode or populated.\n\nIn 1642 and 1652 a French traveler Jean-Baptiste Tavernierwho visited the city of Bhaganagar , compared the city to Orléans, well built and opened out, and in 1672, Abbe Carre was much impressed by the city and termed it the center of all trade in the East’.Pleae refer to Wikipedia separate page titled \"Chichlam and Bhagamati ” for more information. French Traveller Mr. Travernier visited Hyderabad first in 1642 AD and he had mentioned the name of the city as Bhaganagar( Hyderabad.) The Friendship treaty was concluded in 1677 AD after which Chatrpathi Shivaji left the city to Karnataka expedition. Dad Mahal constructed by Md. Quli Qutub Shah was situated near the present A.P High Court building south of the river bank.\n\nMuhammad Quli Qutub Shah constructed the ‘Charminar’ of Four Minarets. Charminar is the exact replica of tombs of Martyrs Hasan and Hussain at Karbala, known as Taboot, which is considered very sacred. While laying the foundation stone of Charminar, Md. Quli Qutub Shah and his wife, prayed for welfare of the people in their contemplated new city. The structure of Charminar comprises four tall and massive minarets connected to each other by four high arches and this resembles the archetypal triumphal arch. This beautiful colossus in granite, lime, mortar and, some say, pulverised marble, was at one time the heart of the city. Initially the wonderful monument with its four arches was so proportionately planned that the beautiful Charminar monument could be impressively seen from the top of Golcond fort. One could even catch a glimpse of the bustling Hyderabad city as these Charminar arches were facing the most active royal ancestral streets. Muhammad Quli built the Charminar to commemorate the start of building construction works for his new city of Bhaganagar. He is said to have prayed for the end of a plague epidemic that was ravaging his city and vowed to build a masjid at the very near place, where he was praying. The epidemic ended soon afterwards and Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah constructed Jami masjid in 1596. There is also a legend of an underground tunnel connecting the palace at Golkonda to Charminar, possibly intended as an escape route for the Qutub Shahi rulers in case of a siege, though the exact location of the tunnel is unknown.\n\nPatronage of Literature\n\nSultan Muhammed Quli Qutb Shah was a scholar of Arabic and Persian. He wrote poetry in Urdu and Persian. His poetry has been compiled into a dewan or volume entitled \"Kulliyat-e-Quli Qutub Shah.” Muhammed Quli Qutub Shah had the distinction of being the first Saheb-e-dewan Urdu poet and is credited with introducing a new sensibility into prevailing genres of Persian/Urdu poetry. It is said that the Urdu language acquired the status of a literary language due to his contributions.\n\nHis Dewan (collection of poems) was discovered in 1922 by Dr. Abdul Haq, in Hyderabad. Its discovery was a landmark in the history of Urdu literature for prior to it Vali Dakhni was regarded as the first Urdu poet with a collection to his credit.\n\nMohammad Quli Qutb Shah’s Works:\n\nDewan- Kulliyat e Quli Qutub Shah (Collection of poems)\n\nAhmed Faraz [1931-2008]\n\nAhmed Faraz (January 14, 1931 in Nowshera – Pakistan) is considered one of the greatest modern Urdu poets of the last century and greatest living Urdu poet of present times. Faraz is his ‘takhallus’, whereas his real name is Syed Ahmed Shah.\n\nFaraz, who has been compared with Mohammad Iqbal and Faiz Ahmed Faiz, holds a unique position as one of the best poets of current times, with a fine but simplistic style of writing, even common people can easily understand and identify with. Ethnically a Pashto-speaking Pashtun, Ahmed Faraz learned and studied Persian and Urdu at the Peshawar University where he taught these subjects later.\n\nEarly life\n\nIn an interview with Rediff he recalls how his father, a teacher, once bought clothes for him on Eid. He didn’t like the clothes meant for him, but preferred the ones meant for his elder brother. This lead him to write his first couplet:\n\nLayen hain sab ke liye kapde sale se (He brought clothes for everybody from the sale)\n\nLayen hain hamare liye kambal jail se (For me he brought a blanket from jail)\n\nHe was told by his parents once to learn mathematics from a female class fellow during the summer vacation. \"I was weak in mathematics and geography. I still don’t remember maps and roads”.\n\nInstead of learning mathematics he played bait-bazi with her, a game in which one person recites a couplet and the other one recites another couplet starting from the last letter of the previous one. He always lost, even though he memorized hundreds of couplets for her, but when he started manufacturing his own couplets she couldn’t catch him anymore. Coming from a respectable family of Syeds, descendents of ”Haji Bahadar” a famous saint of Kohat, he moved to Peshawar with entire family. Studied in famous Edwards College Peshawar and then did his Masters in Urdu and Persian. Initially Syed Ahmad Shah Faraz thus became Ahmed Faraz.\n\nDuring his college time, Faiz Ahmed Faiz and Ali Sardar Jafri were the best progressive poets, who impressed him and became his role models. He initially worked as a script writer at radio Pakistan Peshawar and then moved on to teach Urdu at Peshawar University. In 1976 he became the founding Director General (Later Chairman) of Academy of Letters.\n\nPolitical life\n\nOutspoken about politics, he went into self-imposed exile during the Zia-ul-Haq era after he was arrested for reciting certain poems at a mushaira criticizing the military rule. He stayed for three years in Britain, Canada and Europe before returning to Pakistan, where he was initially appointed Chairman Academy of Letters and later chairperson of the Islamabad-based National Book Foundation for several years. He has been awarded with numerous national and international awards.\n\nHe was awarded the Hilal-e-Imtiaz in 2004, in recognition of his literary achievements. He returned the award in 2006 after becoming disenchanted with the government and its policies.\n\n\"My conscious will not forgive me if I remained a silent spectator of the sad happenings around us. The least I can do is to let the dictatorship know where it stands in the eyes of the concerned citizens whose fundamental rights have been usurped. I am doing this by returning the Hilal-e-Imtiaz (civil) forthwith and refuse to associate myself in any way with the regime…” a statement issued by the poet.\n\nAbout his current writings he says: \"I now only write when I am forced to from the inside.”\n\nMaintaining a tradition established by his mentor, the revolutionary Faiz Ahmed Faiz, he wrote some of his best poetry during those days in exile. Famous amongst poetry of resistance has been \"Mahasara”\n\nOne amongst his great ghazals is the famous Ranjish Hi Sahi. He has so far written 13 books and all put together comes as \"Shehr e Sukhn aarasta hai” his latest publication so far.\n\nWALI DAKNI ولی دکنی۔\n\nWali Mohammed Wali (also known as Wali Deccani) was born in 1667 in Aurangabad, Maharashtra. He loved travelling, which he regarded as a means of education. His visit to Delhi in 1700 is considered to be of great significance for Urdu Gazals. His simple, sensuous and melodious poems in Urdu, awakened the Persian loving poets of Delhi to the beauty and capability of “Rekhta” (the old name for Urdu) as a medium of poetic expression. His visit thus stimulated the growth and development of Urdu Gazal in Delhi.\n\nHowever, Wali was not immune or ignorant of the vigour and verve of Persian diction and imagery, and combined both into the body of his verse. He thus became the architect of the modern poetic language, which is a skilful blend of Persian and Urdu vocabulary.\n\nThough Wali wrote in different types of verse forms – masnavi, qasida, etc., he specialized in ghazals. He wrote a total of 473 Gazals, comprising of 3225 couplets (ashaar). He was also the first poet to start expressing love from a man’s point of view as against the prevailing convention of impersonating as a woman.\n\nWali died in Ahmedabad in 1707, and is buried there.\n\nMIRA GHALIB\n\nMirza Asadullah Beg — known to posterity as Ghalib, a nom de plume he adopted in the tradition of all classical Urdu poets, was born in the city of Agra, of parents with Turkish aristocratic ancestry, on December 27th, 1797. As to the precise date, Imtiyaz Ali Arshi has conjectured, on the basis of Ghalib’s horoscope, that the poet might have been born a month later, in January 1798. When he was only five years old, his father, Abdullah Beg Khan died in a battle while working under Rao Raja Bakhtwar Singh of Alwar and his uncle Nasrullah Beg Khan took charge of him. But he lost his uncle also at the tender age of eight.\n\nThe death of his father and uncle during his early youth left Ghalib with no male-dominant figures. He then moved to Delhi.\n\nGhalib’s early education has always been a matter of confusion. There are no known records of his formal education, although it was known that his circle of friends in Delhi had some of the most intelligent minds of the time.\n\nAround 1810, he was married into a family of nobles, at the age of thirteen. He had seven children, none of whom survived (this pain has found its echo in some of Ghalib’s ghazals). There are conflicting reports regarding his relationship with his wife. She was considered to be pious, conservative and God-fearing while Ghalib was carefree, unconventional, and arguably, not very religious in the strict sense of the word.\n\nGhalib never worked as such for a livelihood. He lived on either state patronage, credit or the generosity of his friends. His fame came to him posthumously. He had himself remarked during his lifetime that although his age had ignored his greatness, it would be recognized by later generations. History has vindicated his claim. He also is arguably the most “written about” of all Urdu poets.\n\nAlthough Ghalib wrote in Persian as well, he is more famous for his ghazals written in Urdu. It is believed he wrote most of his popular ghazals by age nineteen. His ghazals, unlike those of Meer Taqi Meer, contain highly Persianised Urdu, and are therefore not easily understood or appreciated by a vast majority of people without some extra effort. Numerous elucidations of Ghalib’s collection of ghazals have therefore, been written by Urdu scholars. The first such elucidation or Sharh was written by Ali Haider Nazm Tabatabai of Hyderabad during the rule of the last Nizam of Hyderabad. Before Ghalib, the ghazal was primarily an expression of anguished love; but Ghalib expressed philosophy, the travails and mysteries of life and wrote ghazals on many other subjects, vastly expanding the scope of the Ghazal. This, together with his many masterpieces, will forever remain his paramount contribution to Urdu Poetry and Literature.\n\nIn keeping with the conventions of the classical Ghazal, in most of Ghalib’s verses, the identity and the gender of the beloved is indeterminate. The beloved could be a beautiful woman, or a beautiful boy, or even God. As the renowned critic/poet/writer Shamsur Rahman Faruqui explains, since the convention of having the “idea” of a lover or beloved instead of an actual lover/beloved, freed the poet-protagonist-lover from the demands of “realism”, love poetry in Urdu from the last quarter of the seventeenth century onwards, consists mostly of “poems about love” and not “love poems” in the Western sense of the term. Ghalib’s poetry is a fine illustration of this. Ghalib also excels in deeply introspective and philosophical verses.\n\nThe first complete English translation of Ghalib’s love poems (ghazals) was written by Sarfaraz K. Niazi and published by Rupa & Co in India and Ferozsons in Pakistan. The title of this book is Love Sonnets of Ghalib and it contains complete roman transliteration, explication and an extensive lexicon.\n\nNot only Urdu poetry but the prose is also indebted to Mirza Ghalib. His letters gave foundation to easy and popular Urdu. Before Ghalib, letter writing in Urdu was highly ornamental. He made his letters “talk” by using words and sentences as if he were conversing with the reader. According to him “sau kos se ba-zaban-e-qalam baatein kiya karo aur hijr mein visaal ke maze liya karo” [ from hundred of miles talk with the tongue of the pen and enjoy the joy of meeting even when you are separated] His letters were very informal, some times he would just write the name of the person and start the letter.\n\nHe himself was very humorous and also made his letter very interesting. He said “main koshish karta hoon keh koi aisi baat likhoon jo parhay khoosh ho jaaye” [ I want to write the lines that whoever reads those should enjoy it] When the third wife of one of his friends died, he wrote… “Allah allah aik woh log hain jo teen teen dafah iss qaid say chhoot chu-kain hain aur aik hum hain keh aik ag-lay pachas baras say jo phansi ka phanda ga-lay mein parha hai to nah phanda hi tut-ta hai nah dum hi nikalta hai” [Allah Allah, there are some among us who have been freed from this prison three times and I have for the past 50 years this rope around my neck; neither this rope breaks nor it takes my life] Some scholar says that Ghalib would have the same place in Urdu literature if only on the basis of his letters.They have been beautifully translated into English by Ralph Russell, The Oxford Ghalib.\n\nHe died in Delhi on February 15th, 1869\n\nThe Master of Marsia​\n\nMir Babar Ali Anis was a renowned Urdu Poet. He was born in Faizabad in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh in 1803 A.D. For many generations, the ancestors of Mir Anis had enjoyed distinction in poetry and literature. “The Mir was warm Hearted, Humility-loving and mirthful.” The atmosphere which Anis was brought up, did condition his life. The result was that he had matured into a sober, serious-minded and cultured man with an unshakable belief in self-dignity. His artistic temperament, punctuated with a sober and serious attitude towards life, made him sensitive and touchy. The same sensitivities are reflected at places his Rubais and Marsias. But, where as Anis was a highly self- respecting man, on the contrary, he was considerably self-effacing, such a great lover and exponent of truth the poet was that, for its bold expression, he cared for none. Anis knew the taste and requirements of His age and was ready to contribute to it his own share. Not only had he written his marsia with the utmost of gusto and buoyancy, but He recited his works with the dramatic fervor and faultless perfection of an actor, sometimes through the most appropriate gestures.​\n\nAs a poet Mir Anis was doubtlessly great and prolific, His fame was not confined to Lucknow or Awadh alone, it spread in the length and breathe of India, wherever the poet went, he drew large crowds and his audience comprised of men of all castes, creeds and religions. The number of his marsias runs into hundreds, if the whole number of his works is calculated in terms of couplets, Anis is said to have composed at least one hundred thousand couplets. He was a poet of Ghazal too. Had he continued composing ghazals, he would have perhaps earned a lasting fame in that field too. But there is a narrative that His father advised him to devote his talents to marsia and marsia lone. As an obedient son, he acted upon the advice of his father. His productive age was fairly long and he spent about 54 years in composing Marsias, Salams and Rubais.​\n\nIt had not been less bountiful with regard to his talents for the rubai and beyond doubt; Mir Anis had an extraordinary capability for the writing of rubais. It is a fact that many compilations of the rubaiyat of Mir Anis have appeared, but the most voluminous and qualitative is the compilation of Syed Mohammed Abbas. The Book is titled “Rubaiyat-e-Anis”. In the preface, the learned compiler has shed much light on the artistic excellence of the rubais of Mir Anis. In recent years, other selections of the works including the rubais of Mir Anis have also seen the light of the day. out of these selections the valuable ones are Hakim Amjad Ali Ash’hari’s “Hayat-e-Anis”, Prof. Masood Husain Rizvi Adib’s “Rooh-e-Anis” and Ehsanullah Abbasi’s”Nishtar-e-Sukhan”.​\n\nHe immeasurably enriched the contents of the rubai, making it much more colorful and multi dimensional. Anis further invigorated the rubai by introducing the tragic events of “Karbala” to it and their Moralistic Effect. Thus, he widened the scope of rubai to unfathomable limits. The result was that, after marsia, the rubai came to be reckoned as the most potential and representative medium for the didactic and reformative Urdu poetry.​\n\nMirza Salamat Ali Dabeer Biography\n\nMirza Salaamat Ali Dabeer (1803-1875) was a leading Urdu poet who excelled and perfected the art of Marsiya writing. He is considered the leading exponent of Marsiya Nigari or marsiya writing along with Mir Anis.\n\nMirza Dabeer was born in 1803 in Delhi. He started reciting marsiya since childhood during muharram ceremonial gatherings called majalis (singular-majlis). He started writing poetry under the tutelage of Mir Muzaffar Husain Zameer. Dabeer himself was an erudite scholar of his time. He migrated from Delhi to Lucknow, where he found suitable environment to develop and demonstrarte his skills in marsiya writing. According to Maulana Muhammad Husain Azad in Aab-e-Hayat quoting Tazkira-e-Sarapa Sukhan, there is confusion regarding his father’s name because of two different names mentioned in Tazkira-as-Ghulam Husain /Mirza Agha Jan Kaghazfarosh. Mirza Dabeer died in Lucknow in 1875 and is buried there.\n\nAccording to Muhammad Husain Azad in Aab-e-Hayat: Mirza Sahib died on the 29th of Muharram, A.H. 1292 [1875-76], at the age of 72 years. In his lifetime he must have written at least three thousand elegies. Not counting his salams and nauhas and quatrains. He wrote a dotless elegy (be-nuqta) of which the opening verse is:\n\nIn it, he used (the dotless) Utarid or Atarid Jupiter instead of Dabeer for a pen-name. And there’s no doubt that with him elegy composition in India reached its conclusion. Now no such time will come, nor will such accomplished persons be born (Frances W. Pritchett translation).\n\nList of Marasi by Dabeer:\n\n1. Kis sher ki Amad hai ki Run kaanp raha hai\n\n2. Dast-e-Khuda Ka Quwat-e-Bazoo Husain hai\n\n3. Jab Chaley Yasrab Se Sibte Mustafa (SAW) Soo-e-Iraaq\n\n4. Bilqees paasbaan hai ye kiski janaab hai\n\n5. Paida Shua-E-Mehar Ki Miqraaz Jab Huee\n\nAlthough Dabeer’s poetic expression found expression in the genre of marsiya but he made use of other forms of Urdu poetry, viz., salaam and rubai, he seldom wrote ghazals too. A couplet from one of his salaams is a clear example of his genius comparable to Ghalib:\n\nDabeer and Anis Rivalry\n\nAnis and Dabeer rivalry is the most debated and talked about rivalry in Urdu literature. Their rivalry led to the development of two distinct styles/schools of Marsiya-nigari or marsiya writing at its inception. The staunch supporters of each of the masters identified themselves as \"Aneesiya” and \"Dabeeriya”. The impact of rivalry was so intense that the followers could neither free themselves from their influence nor surpass either master’s brilliance. Although the populace divided themselves into two separate groups the two poets remained at cordial terms and acknowledged each other with great respect. When Anis died in 1874, Dabeer penned the following couplet as a tribute to the departed poet:\n\nDabeer, along with Anis, left an everlasting influence on Urdu literature and marsiya in particular. Marsiya, in its content and matter, allowed the two masters to demonstrate their artistry and command of Urdu language and idiom. At the same time epical nature of marsiya covered and dealt with entire range of emotions and ideas. It has both mystical and romantic appeal. All the contemporary and succeeding generations of poets who adopted marsiya as the genre of poetic expression and also others who took to other forms of poetry found it difficult to break away from the trends and standards set by these two masters. The names of Dabeer and Anis are inextricable whenever Urdu Marsia is mentioned. In short, marsiya attained its zenith under the poetic genius of Anis and Dabeer. Marsiya became synonymous with the names of these two masters and also the form-musaddas- adopted by them became synonymous with the identity of marsiya. Dabeer along with Anis influenced two major aspects of the socio-cultural life of the Indian sub-continent. One is literature and other is azadari tradition of the sub-continent.\n\nSachal Sarmast A Sufi poet\n\nThe name Sachal Sarmast can be translated as Ecstatic Saint of Truth. He is sometimes called Sachoo, The Truthful.​\n\nSachal Sarmast was born in the Sindh region of what is today Pakistan, and is considered one of the great poets and Sufi mystics to emerge from the region.​\n\nHis teachings have often been compared with al-Hallaj, the Sufi martyr who ecstatically proclaimed, \"I am the Truth.” Rather than blindly following tradition, Sachal urged people to seek the truth directly. And like ibn Arabi and others, Sachal Sarmast taught a vision of Unity called Wahdat al-Wujud, which others have compared to the great nondualist teachings of Advaita Vedanta within Hinduism and Zen/Chan within Buddhism.​\n\nSachal Sarmast once said, \"He (God) is everywhere and in each and every phenomenon. He has come here just to witness His own manifestation.” ​\n\nSachal Sarmast was born Abdul Wahab in the village of Daraza in the Sindh region. His father died when he was a young child, and Abdul Wahab was raised by his uncle, who also became his spiritual master.​\n\nHis soul was deeply moved by music. Listening to music, he was often enraptured, tears pouring down his face.​\n\nSachal Sarmast married, but the young woman died two years later. He never remarried.​\n\nHe took the name Sachal, Truth. Later people added Sarmast, Leader of the Ecstatics, to his name in appreciation of his spiritual poetry.​\n\nSachal Sarmast lived a humble, ascetic life, preferring solitude, simple meals of daal and yogurt. It is said that he never left Daraza, the village of his birth. Yet he composed sacred poetry in seven different languages, poetry that is loved and sung to this day.​\n\nJOSH MALIHA BAADI\n\nJosh Malihabadi (Urdu: جوش ملیح آبادی) (born as Shabbir Hasan Khan; شبیر حسن خان) (December 5, 1894 – February 22, 1982) was a noted Urdu poet born in British India, who was an Indian citizen until 1958, when he emigrated to Pakistan and became a Pakistani citizen. He wrote ghazals and nazm under the takhallus Josh (جوش) (literally, \"Passion” or \"Intensity”).\n\nJosh was born to an Afridi Pashtun family in Malihabad, United Provinces, British India. He studied at St Peter’s College, Agra and passed his Senior Cambridge examination in 1914. Although Josh subsequently studied Arabic and Persian and, in 1918, spent six months at Tagore’s university, Shantiniketan. The death of his father, Bashir Ahmed Khan, in 1916, prevented him from undertaking a college education.\n\nIn 1925, Josh began to supervise translation work at Osmania University, in the princely state of Hyderabad. However, his stay there ended, when he found himself exiled from the state for writing a nazm against the Nizam of Hyderabad, the then ruler of the state.\n\nSoon thereafter, he founded the magazine, Kaleem (literally, \"interlocutor” in Urdu), in which he openly wrote articles in favour of independence from the British Raj in India. As his reputation spread, he came to be called Shaair-e-Inquilaab (Poet of the Revolution). Subsequently, he became more actively involved in the freedom struggle (albeit, in an intellectual capacity) and became close to some of the political leaders of that era, especially Jawaharlal Nehru (later to be the first Prime Minister of independent India).\n\nAfter the end of British Raj in India (1947), Josh became the editor of the publication Aaj-Kal .\n\nJosh migrated to Pakistan in 1958 – despite Jawaharlal Nehru’s insistence against it – over what is generally believed to be his concern regarding the future of the Urdu language in India, where he thought the Hindu majority would encourage the use of Hindi rather than Urdu. After migration, Josh settled in Karachi and rigorously worked for Anjuman-i-Tarraqi-i-Urdu with Maulvi Abdul Haq.\n\nHe remained in Pakistan until he died on February 22, 1982 in Islamabad. Faiz Ahmad Faiz and Syed Fakhruddin Balley both were the closest companions and friends of Josh and Sajjad Hyder Kharosh (son of Josh). Faiz Ahmad Faiz visited Islamabad during his illness and Syed Fakhruddin Balley remained entirely engaged with Hazrat Josh and Sajjad Hyder Kharosh..\n\nFaiz-Ahmed-Faiz [1911-1984]\n\nFaiz Ahmed Faiz\n\nFaiz Ahmed Faiz was born on February 13, 1911, in Sialkot, India, which is now part of Pakistan. He had a privileged childhood as the son of wealthy landowners Sultan Fatima and Sultan Muhammad Khan, who passed away in 1913, shortly after his birth. His father was a prominent lawyer and a member of an elite literary circle which included Allama Iqbal, the national poet of Pakistan.\n\nIn 1916, Faiz entered Moulvi Ibrahim Sialkoti, a famous regional school, and was later admitted to the Skotch Mission High School where he studied Urdu, Persian, and Arabic. He received a Bachelor’s degree in Arabic, followed by a master’s degree in English, from the Government College in Lahore in 1932, and later received a second master’s degree in Arabic from the Oriental College in Lahore.After graduating in 1935, Faiz began a teaching career at M.A.O. College in Amritsar and then at Hailey College of Commerce in Lahore.\n\nFaiz’s early poems had been conventional, light-hearted treatises on love and beauty, but while in Lahore he began to expand into politics, community, and the thematic interconnectedness he felt was fundamental in both life and poetry. It was also during this period that he married Alys George, a British expatriate and convert to Islam, with whom he had two daughters. In 1942, he left teaching to join the British Indian Army, for which he received a British Empire Medal for his service during World War II. After the partition of India in 1947, Faiz resigned from the army and became the editor of The Pakistan Times, a socialist English-language newspaper.\n\nOn March 9, 1951, Faiz was arrested with a group of army officers under the Safety Act, and charged with the failed coup attempt that became known as the Rawalpindi Conspiracy Case. He was sentenced to death and spent four years in prison before being released. Two of his poetry collections, Dast-e Saba and Zindan Namah, focus on life in prison, which he considered an opportunity to see the world in a new way. While living in Pakistan after his release, Faiz was appointed to the National Council of the Arts by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto’s government, and his poems, which had previously been translated into Russian, earned him the Lenin Peace Prize in 1963.\n\nIn 1964, Faiz settled in Karachi and was appointed principal of Abdullah Haroon College, while also working as an editor and writer for several distinguished magazines and newspapers. He worked in an honorary capacity for the Department of Information during the 1965 war between India and Pakistan, and wrote stark poems of outrage over the bloodshed between Pakistan, India, and what later became Bangladesh. However, when Bhutto was overthrown by Zia Ul-Haq, Faiz was forced into exile in Beirut, Lebanon. There he edited the magazine Lotus, and continued to write poems in Urdu. He remained in exile until 1982. He died in Lahore in 1984, shortly after receiving a nomination for the Nobel Prize.\n\nThroughout his tumultuous life, Faiz continually wrote and published, becoming the best-selling modern Urdu poet in both India and Pakistan. While his work is written in fairly strict diction, his poems maintain a casual, conversational tone, creating tension between the elite and the common, somewhat in the tradition of Ghalib, the reknowned 19th century Urdu poet. Faiz is especially celebrated for his poems in traditional Urdu forms, such as the ghazal, and his remarkable ability to expand the conventional thematic expectations to include political and social issues.\n\nbol k lab azad hain tere\n\nbol,zaban ab tak teri hai\n\ntera sutwanjism hai tera\n\nbol k jan ab tak teri hai\n\ndekh k ahangur ki dukan mein\n\ntund hain shoalay,surkh hai ahan\n\nkhulne lage khuflon k dahane\n\nphela har ik zanjeer ka daman\n\njism-o-zaban ki mout se pehle\n\nbol.k sach zinda hai ab tak\n\nbol,jo kuch kehna hai keh le\n\nsahal yun rah-e-zindagi ki hai\n\nher kadam hum ne ashiqi hai\n\nhum ne saja dil mein liye gulshan\n\njab baharon ne berukhi ki hai\n\nzehar se dhoo liye hain hont apne\n\nlutf-e-saqi ne jab kami ki hai\n\ntere koche mein badshahi ki\n\njab se nikle gadagari ki hai\n\nbus wohi surkhro hoa jis ne\n\nbehr-e-khoon mein shanawari ki hai\n\njo guzarte hte daag per sadmein\n\nab wohi kaifiat sabhi ki hai\n\nHabib Jalib\n\nHabib Jalib born in 1928 was one of the most celebrated Pakistani revolutionary Urdu poet of 20th century.

He was always at forefront of struggle for democracy. The poetry of Habib Jalib can be divided into two parts first comprises ghazals composed during the period when jalib had chosen to keep a somewhat low profile. The intensity of his protest became gradually louder in his ghazals and nazams but melody remained indifferent. He bravely confronted first martial law of Ayub Khan. He wrote his famous poem “Dastoor” which is the landmark in the history of Pakistan’s political struggle and became a glowing symbol of protest literature.\n\nHe didn’t affiliate to any party and preferred to be freelance.
