After years of scientific and academic preoccupations, my interests perhaps needed some balance, and it was a dusty old copy of Faiz’s Urdu poetry that was seductive and stirred some long-forgotten nerve. Then, on occasions, in trying to translate some of it for my English-speaking friends, I found myself struggling. From that frustration, a couple of years grew a desire to try to brave the process. This book, with about 270 poems and quatrains, is the result.\n\nThis, of course, was by no means a lone effort without any discussions with others more knowledgeable. Chief among them was my brother (ZMI), a cancer researcher, hardly the easiest person to ‘discuss’ things with. But after hours with him, I either saw the light or had to find refuge in a dark quiet corner.\n\nThere are other friends, TVL in particular, who commented on my drafts, gave helpful comments and let me sort a few things out. To them and their contributions, and to my always-supportive family, I remain grateful.\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\nDr. Riz Rahim has taught courses in biological sciences at various Chicago area colleges and universities including Northeastern Illinois, Roosevelt, East-West, besides being affiliated with Toxicology-Cancer. In addition, Dr. Rahim has published numerous articles in English and Urdu, over the years, on a wide range of topics from science, health, environment, history, and politics to literary matters, in the American, Indian, and Pakistani newspapers and magazines including Dawn, the Nation, Deccan Chronicle, Pakistan Link, and others. Now in this book, Riz turns to translation of Urdu poetry by Faiz Ahmed Faiz.\n\nPREFACE\n\nA poet’s autobiography, Yevgeny Yevtushenko once said, is his poetry. Anything else is just a footnote.* This applies to a very select group of poets that must include the Urdu poet Faiz Ahmed Faiz. In the case of Faiz, the reverse seems truer, if that is possible, because it is his poetry that fills the chapters of his life.\n\nHe published eight books of poetry: Naqsh-e-Feryadi, (NF), being his first, published in 1941, and Ghubbar-e-Ayyam (GA), his last (1984), and a collection of all his poetry, Nusqa-ha-e-wafa, was published posthumously. His early verses, written mostly during his student years, were quite traditional for Urdu poetry and were well received in student and literary circles. That phase did not, however, last long because Faiz underwent a major transformation from traditional Urdu poetry for poetry’s sake, exemplified by his idol, Ghalib, to poetry with purpose. It as not just a road less traveled but a terrain totally alien to Urdu poetry. Unlike [a] poem should not mean, but be,† each of his poems recorded a part of his own life in the larger context of his country’s history.\n\nThat break came with his famous poem halfway into his very book (#15 in NF). It starts with these memorable lines: Don’t ask me, sweetheart, for the love we had before / Many other woes in the world besides love and heartache / many other comforts besides our togetherness, Mujh say pahli si mohabuth meray mahboob na maang. He marked that change with a telling line from a Persian poet, Nizami: I have sold my heart, and bought a soul (Dil-e-bufro-khathm, jaan-e-khareedun).\n\nHe dwells on the same theme in #17, NF, in Think (Sooch):\n\nWhat if I’m unhappy ?\n\nThe whole world is unhappy;\n\nthis pain isn’t just yours or mine,\n\nthis is our heritage, my dear.\n\nEven if you were mine,\n\ngrief in the world would still remain;\n\nwebs of sin, chains of oppression\n\nwe can’t wish them away . . . .\n\nWhy not adopt the world’s pains\n\nwe’ll think of the solutions later,\n\nWe’ll dream of happiness later,\n\nfigure out the dream later.\n\nPrior to that, it was romantic poetry, best represented perhaps by this Urdu quatrain (#1 in NF), still very nostalgic for many. (In translation, however, some quatrains are best not restricted to only 4 lines as in this and other translated quatrains in this book):\n\nLast night\n\nyou sneaked into my thoughts\n\nas if the Spring quietly came to a wasteland,\n\na soft breeze sailed through a desert,\n\na sudden solace touched the sick\n\nfor no reason.\n\nThis transformation stemmed from Faiz’s growing concern about social justice and his involvement with Progressive Writers Association founded in the mid-1930s. Those were tumultuous years in India and the world: the British Raj was in its last decade, the fascism was raging on, WWII was imminent, and the Soviet experiment with communism was being watched in liberal intellectual circles with great interest in it as a model. Faiz was feeling the urge to move from poetry’s cloistered garden to the problems of the struggling masses. His poems in part 2 of NF take on more political color, for instance, A Few More Days, My Friend (Chund roz aur, meri jaan), Speak Up (Bol), and We, the People (Hum loug). This trend continued in the books to follow.\n\nWhile teaching at Amritsar, Faiz met his soul mate, Alys George, a fellow socialist from London on a visit to her sister in the area; courted her; and married her in 1941. When WWII started, he joined the British Indian Army (Public Relations Office). A few years later, India was partitioned, and he (now a family man, with wife and two children) opted for Pakistan, which included the town he was born in (Sialkot) and the one he adopted (Lahore). The independence of Pakistan in August 1947 turned out to be not the end but a beginning of his problems that dogged him the rest of his life: successive military rulers of Pakistan in a mostly conservative Muslim society, which did not share his progressive, nonreligious/atheistic, and socialist/communist preferences and were most intolerant of public dissent.\n\nIn the years to follow, his poetry gets gloomier and gloomier. In his second book Dast-e-Saba (DS), we notice the initial excitement of a newly independent Pakistan being gobbled up by the realities and increasing doubts:\n\nThese patches of lights, a night-like dawn—\n\nthis is not the dawn\n\nwe’ve been waiting for . . . . Keep moving,\n\nnot our destination, yet.\n\nfrom The Dawn of Freedom, August, 1947 (\"Subh-e-Azadi, August, 1947\")\n\nRaising those doubts did not endear him to the politicians; his patriotism was questioned, as well as his involvement in progressive causes and social justice in a new nation, and his criticism of the government authorities. He was ridiculed by the then-governor of Punjab (who was always ready with his Alsations, or police goons, to go after him) and Pakistan’s first prime minister, Liaquat Ali Khan, after Jinnah’s death. Faiz was arrested in March 1951 (about four years after independence) on largely baseless charges of conspiracy to overthrow the government (the so-called Rawalpindi Conspiracy case) and was incarcerated for more than four years, including solitary confinement and denial of pen and paper. DS, published in 1952 while he was still in prison, includes one of his sad poems, An Evening in the Prison (Zindan ki ek shaa), ending in these beautiful these:\n\nEven if they can snuff out\n\nthe candles of love\n\nin our homes,\n\nlet’s see if they can\n\nblow out the moon!\"\n\nEven at the fifth anniversary of Pakistan’s independence, he was still not very hopeful:\n\nThe desert is still a desert, but\n\nby the blood of our feet, Faiz,\n\nthorns of the cacti\n\nare now being nourished.\n\n(August 1952)\n\nHis third book, Zindan Nama (ZN) is an anthology of his prison poems, full of heartrending loneliness, uncertainty, swings of depression, glimmers of hope, endless waiting, and delusional attempts. His fellow prisoner, Major M. Is’haaq (Ret.), who also acted as his secretary during the prison years, gives an extraordinarily detailed account in ZN (see Appendix.B.2). In the prison desolation, Faiz wrote some of his most agonizing verses. When Faiz was refused pen and paper, Major Is’haaq tried to memorize as many poems as he"
