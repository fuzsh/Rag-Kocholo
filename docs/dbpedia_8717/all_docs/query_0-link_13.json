        "text": "Revolutionary Urdu poem by Faiz Ahmad Faiz\n\nHum Dekhengeby Faiz Ahmed FaizOriginal titleویبقی و جہ ر بکWritten1979First published in1981LanguageUrduLines21\n\nHum Dekhenge (Urdu: ہم دیکھیں گے - In english We shall see) is a popular Urdu nazm, written by the Pakistani poet Faiz Ahmad Faiz.[1] Originally written as Va Yabqá Vajhu Rabbika (And the countenance of your Lord will outlast all),[2] it was included in the seventh poetry book of Faiz -- Mere Dil Mere Musafir.\n\nBackground\n\n[edit]\n\nThe nazm was composed as a medium of protest against Zia Ul Haq's oppressive regime.[3] It gained a rapid cult-following as a leftist[4][5] song of resistance and defiance,[6] after a public rendition by Iqbal Bano at Alhamra Arts Council[7][8] on 13 February 1986,[9] ignoring the ban on Faiz's poetry.[10] [11][12][13][14][15][16]\n\nThemes\n\n[edit]\n\nFaiz employs the metaphor of traditional Islamic imagery to subvert and challenge Zia's fundamentalist interpretation of them; Qayamat, the Day of Reckoning is transformed into the Day of Revolution, wherein Zia's military government will be ousted by the people and democracy will be re-installed.[15][17]\n\nIn popular culture\n\n[edit]\n\nMedia\n\n[edit]\n\nThe song was recreated in Coke Studio Season 11 on 22 July 2018, under the aegis of Zohaib Kazi and Ali Hamza.[18][A] In the movie The Kashmir Files (2022), it was depicted as being sung by students of a left-leaning Indian university to as a song of protest [20]\n\nProtests\n\n[edit]\n\nThe poem gained importance in protests against Pervez Musharraf in the early 2000s.[21][22]\n\nDuring the Citizenship Amendment Act protests in India,[23] faculty members of IIT Kanpur took issue with Hum Dekhenge being sung by protesting students in the campus, and alleged it to be \"anti-Hindu\".[24][B] The IIT instituted a commission to look into the issue.[25] The student media body rejected the charges as being misinformed and communal, which divorced the poem from its societal context.[26][27] During the same period of early 2000s Madan Duklan, a prominent actor, director and poet in Garhwali language translated 'Hum Dekhenge' in Garhwali language. Encouraged and directed by Dr. Sunil Kainthola, local artists who were participating in a production orientation workshop for 'Mukhjatra' sang the Garhwali version of Hum Dekhenge in front of the Uttarakhand movement's martyrs monument in the court compound at Dehradun.\n\nNotes and references\n\n[edit]\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
