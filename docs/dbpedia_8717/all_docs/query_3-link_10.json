        "meta_description": "This paper investigates Pakistani writer Faiz Ahmed Faiz’s famous poem, ham dekheñge. In recent times, it has become a source of controversy for the language utilized and the Islamic-themes oriented within it, as seen by coverage surrounding the Citizenship Amendment Act protests in India in 2019. Building upon the sayings of literary commentators, this research dwells onto the Qur’anic and Ṣūfī origins for this poem, as well as its distinctly anti-colonial nature. It investigates the relationship with Faiz’s Marxist leanings, the evidently Pan-Islamic motif, and the original context of the poetry as a source of defiance to Zia ul-Haq’s regime in Pakistan by its famous singing by Iqbal Bano in 1986.",

        "text": "Analysis and Islamic imagery\n\nWhen looking at a poem such as ham dekheñge which is written originally in the Urdu language, one must recognize the backdrop of the literary society that nazms (poems) originated in. Urdu’s original name was Zaban-e-Urdu (language of the [exalted] camp) given ‘ordu’ meaning camp in Turkic languages such as Chagtai. It was a symbol of the literary and societal elites, as it was championed under the Mughal Empire. Thus, this Persianized register of the Hindustani language became the preferred tongue for Muslims in the Indian subcontinent, with the less Prakrit or Sanskrit drawn vocabulary, in favor of Persian and Arabic, noting higher degrees of prestige.\n\nFaiz’s poetry must be read through the context of his own political leanings, a Marxist by his own admission, which landed him in the government of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto and found himself in exile in Moscow. Ham dekheñge (we shall see) is an allusion to seeing a change in time, intended to be against Zia ul-Haq who is considered the archnemesis of this polemic. At first glance, many can also think that it is speaking out of a disheartened state of mind with the world around us and thus looking forward to the Day of Judgement, prophesied in Abrahamic faiths, as an end of time-event where justice will be delivered in the courts of Allah. As with much of this poem, there is a play on a Quranic phrase here, “Fa satubṣiru wa yubṣirụn (So, you will see, and they will see).8 The very word maftun in the succceeding verse refers to one being demented, and is in the context of an assurance by Allah that the accusations derailed against the Prophet Muhammad will be disproven for their position at a later time when justice will prevail.9 It turns the tables on the accusers, by fermenting a prophecy in an unequivocally challenging tone, akin to that of Faiz’s, that the test of time will prove who was insane and in error. It is worth mentioning that in Maarif-ul-Quran, those who did not read the signs of time are construed as having additionally failed to recognize the “light of Truth”. This is reminiscent of another phrase An-al-Haq (I am Truth) in this poem. In the succeeding line, lāzim hai ke ham bhī dekheñge (Inevitably, we shall also see the day) there is this concentrated reaffirmation of how certain it is that they will see this day. No room for negotiation or bending of will is present in this expressed sentiment.\n\nInterestingly enough, Faiz largely rejects the confines of Arabic metre and prosody such as ramal, which was championed by the other ‘Poet of the East’, Muhammad Iqbal, in shikwa and javāb-e-shikvā. Yet nevertheless, Qafiya and Radif (Persian for order) are still embedded within it, with vaada hai and likha hai repeating the āsound for Qafiya and hai for Radif across the hemistich in the second shʿr (prosodic unit). Following that, another word, vʿdā (promise) is used in lieu of lāzim (inevitably) to signify that this is a promise from Allah, one that was promised to them as a people. The people, known to be referring to a pluralistic group due to ham signifying we, are akin to those mentioned in Surah Taha Verse 86: “Faraja’s Moosaaa ilaa qawmihee ghadbaana asifaa; qaala yaa qawmi alam ya’idkum Rabbukum wa’dan hasanaa; afataala ‘alaikumul ‘ahdu am arattum ai yahilla ‘alaikum ghadabum mir Rabbikum fa akhlaftum maw’idee (Then Mûsâ - Moses - returned to his people in a state of anger and sorrow. He said: “O my people! Did not your Lord promise you a fair promise? Did then the promise seem to you long in coming? Or did you desire that wrath should descend from your Lord on you, that you broke your promise to me (i.e disbelieving in Allâh and worshiping the calf)”.10 Din is used for day instead of the Arabic-origin Yaum, which hints that Faiz’s intention is not to speak of the Day of Judgment in the literal sense as written in the Quran. There is instead an underlying theme of an eternal truth, something that irrevocably will happen. For example, after a period of warmth comes cool, be it seasonal or after years of climate change, and that after day comes night, no matter the length or duration of either. In this case, Faiz claims that after oppression comes ease, a regurgitation of Surah Ash-Sharh verse 4: “Fa inna ma’al usri yusra” (Verily, along with every hardship is relief).11 The ease is considered to be one coming in abundance, with the verse being repeated right after in a similar form in that chapter.12 This mythological dilemma was thus presented to the masses as a reassurance that the forces of civil liberties will prevail after the inevitable collapse of the authoritarian government.\n\nLau-e-azl literally means the tablet of eternity, used within Quranic discourse, this refers to an eternal slate on which the destiny of the world and all its inhabitants has been written and determined. Naturally, its implications regarding presdestination has puzzled many Muslim theologians. Yet this verse has not only intrigued elites/academics/thinkers/theologians, etc. but also the common masses. It comes in the last Juzz of the Quran, in a chapter oft known and memorized by the masses and those who are not as well acquainted with the rest of the Islamic text.13 Its accessibility is imperative to formulating its narrative to begin with. The metaphor is used to also refer to the Quran itself in the last verse of Surah Al-Buruj, with lauh-e-mahfooz referring to the Quran’s eternal nature, coinciding with the Ashari/Maturidi theological position on the subject.14 The destiny of revolution is thus protected by divine ordinance, something the oppressor cannot grapple with.\n\nIn the next six lines, the imagery in regards to the end of times is akin to Quranic tropes on doomsday narratives preceding the final day of judgement. For example in Surah Al-Qari’ah verse 4–5, “Yauma ya koonun naasu kal farashil mabthooth. Wa ta koonul jibalu kal ‘ihnil manfoosh” (It is a Day whereon mankind will be like moths scattered about, and the mountains will be like carded wool).15 Carded wool, presumably fluffed up, has the same meaning as rūi (cotton fluff). The line in the poem jab zulm-o-sitam ke koh-e-garaañ (when dark peaks of torment and tyranny) is claiming that when a valley is filled up with so much oppression that the people cannot withstand it any further, then the promise from Allah will be fulfilled and it will flow away.\n\nThe next four lines dealing with crashing lightning and the beating heart of earth need to be read together. Mahkūmoñ comes from the Arabic and Urdu base ḥākim which roughly translates to a ruler. When a ruler gives a command, the recipient becomes a mahkūm. The use of the plural we, ham, before it means that when people stand united, only then will they rise above the paaoñ (feet). Yet the masses’ feet are considered broken, due to not having stood against tyranny together and they are also meant to dually shatter the feet on which the ḥākim stands. This is a call for a complete revolution, akin to the Marxist leanings of Faiz, as a call against exploitative capitalism, authoritarianism, and imperialism. In India and other Muslim-majority countries, ḥakim and ḥakīm refer to physicians or a wise man. The use of this word instead of rāj for kingship or another Prakrit-drawn equivalent to describe the domain of a ruler is particularly interesting given Faiz strays away from that in the end of his poem. Over there it uses the word rāj to describe the moment of victory when the people will take control, a stylistic choice rejecting the Islamist regime of Zia ul-Haq in favor of the terminology derived from its professed archnemesis, “Hindu India”. dhaṛ dhaṛ dhaṛkegī is speaking of the heart of the earth, a call deep within mother nature begging for change. This too resembles Islamic themes of earth shattering punishment as well as the physical changes to come to the earth that will bring about its collapse, with descriptions of lava and the things within the core being akin to the punishment of eternal hellfire. The alliteration in that line and kaṛ kaṛ kaṛkegī is not lost, given it emphasizes the actions that will take place as a rallying cry for the people to awaken from their long slumber. Without explicitly using the word for heart in Urdu, it is implied that humans will be able to possess a true heart, individually and collectively when revolution breaks out as their combined weight will cause the ground to shake and the oppressor’s feet to collapse. Asmaisout (onomatopoeia) is also present extensively in this in terms of the sounds of a beating heart and a lightning storm being present reflecting what actually occurs during those phenomenons. There is of course Radeef rhyme present at the end of the two lines with the kegī phrase repeating itself. Thereafter, the phrase ahl-e-ḥukam is used to refer to the tormentors who persecute revolutionaries and those failing or refusing to conform to the political standard of the time. Once again the word that resembles the ḥakim physician-like attributes is used, despite the connotation being completely different. Instead, aḥl implies a gathering of people, a household or group of sorts, and thus Faiz suggests there is a large and embattled conspiracy against the people that gather together to plot.16 The revolutionaries are also being foretold to expect the lightning to go sar ūpar (above the head) as in that their power will so far exceed that of the current oppressors that they will tremble with fear, a stark contrast from being underneath the feet of them prior.\n\nIn jab arz-e-ḳhudā ke kʿbe se (When, from the seat of the Almighty) a great many literary features are present, including alliteration with the ‘k’ sound at the beginning of several words. jab once again refers to destiny and a time to come that is being awaited for by the people and narrated to for its signs. arz usually refers to someone speaking at length, but also from an Arabic root literally translates to earth. ḳhudaa is the generic name for god in Urdu, with Allah being specific towards the Lord’s name per Islamic beliefs. In the context, the phrase arz-e-ḳhudā seems to be taking the outlook by naming the people who call themselves god, or act in such an authority or manner that defies the thought of challenge. The confidence and conviction that the oppressors have that they are in fact Almighty, can do as they please with no accountability or reckoning is being mocked here. kʿbe refers to the kʿba, Islam’s holiest site in Mecca which serves as the center of worship and a house of Allah. kʿba literally means a cube in Classical Arabic, but per references from the Quran it is clearly evident that it can also signify a temple of sorts or seat of authority.17 But, pronounced not with a hard ‘t’ in Urdu but with emphasis on the latter letter, translates to idols. It is a clear play on the story of the Conquest of Mecca as narrated in Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī, wherein the Prophet Muhammad and the Muslim armies entered largely without bloodshed into the now epicenter of global Islam and struck down some 360 idols and promised that never again will falsehood find its way from there or emerge from within.18 In the next two lines, there is also kkʿbafiyā with the ‘se’ and ‘ge’ sound at the end of the individual misrs, as well as rhyming patterns in ‘jab’ and ‘sab’. Thus there are clearly two profound meanings here, one being that from the land of God (when applying the earth definition of ‘arz’), which encompasses the entirety of the world, false ideologies will be removed. Pakistan claims itself to be such on the basis of being a homeland for Indian Muslims. In such a claim, a parallel is being drawn between the Quraysh of Mecca, known for their atrocities in pre-Islamic Arabia to the authoritarianism of Zia ul-Haq’s regime. Despite the allusion to a dystopian end of time scenario, the other plausible and intended meaning is that those who are self-proclaimed gods, i.e dictatorial rulers or imposers of their own will, will be removed.\n\nThe next two lines represent a shifting tone, from the continuous references to a future with ‘jab’ to something that is coming sooner, more tangible and in the soon to be present. Ahl-e-safā means the pure people, those with rightly guided intentions on the straight path per Surah Fatiha’s supplication of being on the path of those not led astray. Aṣ-Ṣafā also refers to the mountain in Mecca, adjacent to Marwah, where Muslims routinely walk between in pilgrimage in emulation of Hajer’s, the second wife of Ibrahim, drought-filled journey before discovering zamzam water. To be considered the people of Aṣ-Ṣafā denotes a high degree of honor, as it is a semblance of purity of intentions and Allah’s promise and favor amongst the aforementioned group. It is important to note that jabl or pahaar was not used when referring to safā but rather ahl, akin to the Pakistani motto of purity and advancing the notion that the land is in fact pāk (pure).19 Ḥaram means something that is forbidden in traditional Islamic jurisprudence, yet also encapsulates simply a sanctuary such as Mecca which is a ḥaram due to the stringent laws pertaining to the actions, crimes, and prosecutive measures within its confines. It has even been noted to be a sanctuary for alleged criminals seeking recourse, and to the contemporary era poses a challenge for state officials such as Saudi Arabia in tackling the 1979 Grand Mosque Seizure. This is particularly as a result of the ban on firearms in the ḥaram and weapons of any sort, save those ordained for ritual sacrificial slaughter. The poem can be seen to be condemning the use of lethal force by Zia’s regime against civilians and protestors. In Classical Farsi, Marūdd means a castaway, reprobate, an anathematized individual, or an offcast. Thus mardūd-e-ḥaram implies someone who has been rejected from the higher echelons of society which is guarded and gets away with their crimes against humanity. Masnad is a seat or position, different from a throne, but one that is lavish and couch-like and filled with pillows and riches. It resembles that which princes, shehzadas, and nawabs sit upon while feasting on food in their ḥarems, another layer adding to the depth of Faiz’s word choice and stylistic choices. It is also foretold as a sign of grace by Allah on the followers of the Prophet Muhammad and their eventual success, as in the following verses. In Surah Al-Kahf verse 31, “Uleaika lahum canneatu aadnin tacree min taahtihimul anhaaru yuhaallavna feehea min aseavira min zahabin va yalbasoona siyeaban hudran min sundusin va istabrakın muttakieena feehea aalal areaik, ni’mas saveab, va haasunat murtafakea” (These! For them will be ‘Adn (Eden) Paradise (everlasting Gardens); wherein rivers flow underneath them; therein they will be adorned with bracelets of gold, and they will wear green garments of fine and thick silk. They will recline therein on raised thrones. How good is the reward, and what an excellent Murtafaq - dwelling, resting place).20 Again in Surah Ya-Sin verse 56, “Hum va azveacuhum fee zılealin aalal areaiki muttakioon” (They and their wives will be in pleasant shade, reclining on thrones).21 Reference to plush couches are also made one more time, perhaps one of the most notable one in terms of the context being akin to that presented by Faiz, in Surah Al-Waqi’ah verse 34: “Va furushin marfooaah” (And on couches or thrones, raised high).22 The line is calling upon a time that the people will finally sit on these seats, not in the sense of a transfer of power, but that democracy and the people’s voices will prevail to be in the noble sanctuary. biṭhāye and jāyeñge both have similar rhyming sounds within in terms of the ‘āy’ getting repeated in pronunciation.\n\nThe promise of an eternal democracy and the removal of any last remnants of kingship, frequently akin to absolutism as was practiced by the authoritarian meaning of Zia ul Haq’s government, is then cast to be permanently over. All crowns and thrones are being foretold to fall off the mighty heads of the oppressors, with sab and jāyeñge repeating itself in the beginning and end rhythmically. Again, the ‘āy’ sound occurs twice with uchhāle and girāye, as well as the obvious play on similar structuring with tāj and taḳht starting with similar ‘ta’ sounds.\n\nBas nām rahegā a Allah kā aa (Only Allah’s name will remain) references a time in Islamic beliefs that will come after the fitnah (strife) of Dajjāl (the antichrist), wherein only the name of Allah will prevail in the land. Of the 99 known names of Allah as mentioned in the Quran, Faiz choses to reference the Urdu equivalents of four of them. These are particularly noteworthy as unseen alludes to how belief in Allah is supremely important, and that he lies on a throne above that of the worldly oppressors. Ubiquitous draws on the Asharite belief of Allah’s omnipresent nature and then further corroborates it with how he can see everything, having the vision. This showcases that the world is a test and trial where a period of accountability will befall all peoples, even those who claim to be god-conscious yet consider themselves ḳhuda (god) while only Allah is worthy of being worshiped and adored. In Arabic, ilahi refers to God, while Allah is the supreme and ultimate name for the Muslim belief of God. Faiz uses Allah as a metaphor for truth and justice, signaling that it will present eternally once oppression is lifted from the people. He emphasizes that while people can not hope to see justice (it is ġhaayab), they can manifest it and see its attributes and that it is still somewhere (ḥaazir). It is particularly interesting that Allah is used here instead of God, and it seems to draw on Islamic versions of tahlil and the shahada (testimony of faith). Abu Huraira is reported to have claimed that the Prophet Muhammad said: “He who uttered these words: “There is no god but Allah, the One, having no partner with Him. Sovereignty belongs to Him and all the praise is due to Him, and He is Potent over everything” one hundred times every day there is a reward of emancipating ten slaves for him, and there are recorded hundred virtues to his credit, and hundred vices are blotted out from his scroll, and that is a safeguard for him against the Satan on that day till evening and no one brings anything more excellent than this, except one who has done more than this (who utters these words more than one hundred times and does more good acts) and he who utters:” Hallowed be Allah, and all praise is due to Him,” one hundred times a day, his sins are obliterated even if they are equal to the extent of the foam of the ocean.”23 Another excerpt from Muwatta Malik reinforces this point, “Yahya related to me from Malik from Ziyad ibn Abi Ziyad from Talha ibn Ubaydullah ibn Kariz that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, “The best dua is dua on the day of Arafa, and the best thing that I or the Prophets before me have said is ‘There is no god but Allah, alone, without any partner’ (La ilaha illa’llah, wahdahu la sharika lah)”’.24 In the shahada, Muslims explicitly state that there is no God but Allah, using ilah and Allah separately, with the former being the equivalent of the Urdu ḳhudā.25 Kafiyā and Radīf are present with the repetition of bhī and the similar sounds of hāzir and nāzir, with the overall structure of the two misr (lines) being similar to a high degree.\n\nThe next two lines are amongst the most controversial within Islamic discourse, due to the use of ‘An-al-haq’ (I am the Truth) which lays a claim to a godly attribute in a human. In traditional Islamic belief, only Allah knows the ‘Truth’ and represents it through his justice, something humans can not hope to achieve. Al-Ḥaqq is one of the ninety nine known names of Allah, and is reported to be amongst the most famous shaths uttered.26 Abū ‘l-Muġīth Al-Ḥusayn bin Manṣūr al-Ḥallāj, otherwise known as Mansour Hallaj, or simply Hallaj, is reported to have said it in the mosque of Caliph Al-Mansur, with other accounts claiming he said it in consultation with Junayd al-Baghdadi.27 In popular imagination, the saying has become intertwined with his execution, despite the other political and social causes and intrigue of the time, due to biographer Abū Ḥamīd bin Abū Bakr Ibrāhīm including it in his works.28 Other controversial lines by Hallaj include: “There is nothing wrapped in my turban but God”, “Mā fī jubbatī illā l-Lāh” (There is nothing in my cloak but God) while allegedly pointing to his cloak, and a saying,\n\nI saw my Lord with the eye of the heart I asked, ‘Who are You?’ He replied, ‘You’.\n\nHallaj’s saying has persisted and perplexed Ṣūfīs and the followers of various orders throughout the centuries, and has been associated with a cry of revolution and plight during an era of like-minded authoritarianism and the crushing of any forms of dissent. He promoted a search for the loving union between God and the human soul, with his mystical inclinations resulting in his summary detention and execution. Narratives of his plight have been found in literature spanning the Persian, Ottoman Turkish, Urdu, Pashto, Punjabi, and Sindhi languages. His conflict with state authorities, namely the Abbasids, is widely reported due to allegations levied against him that he viewed himself as an incarnation of God. Thus, he was considered to be an agent of a revolutionary movement, some considering it akin to the ultranationalism of the Mu’tazilites and others to Greek occidentalism, during a period of political crisis in the second major dynastic Islamic caliphate. Opinions regarding him have ranged from full acceptance and ready canonization of his statements to exclusionary practices and outright condemnation. Faiz uses the naara (call, cry) of ‘An-al-haq’ to draw on the common Ṣūfī backgrounds of the Barelvi-inclined masses of Pakistan to come together as being of an inextricable common lineage by virtue of being God’s creation.29 It calls for a populist revolution, instead of everyone acting as independent agents in the pursuit of their own desires and acting on their whims. There is no shortage of legends describing stories associated with anā al-ḥaqq. One such account claims that Hallaj knocked on the door of his famous teacher, Junayd al-Baghdadi and in response to being questioned on who was there used the phrase, “I am the truth”. Baghdadi disapproved of the use according to this account. Other reports, by later Ṣūfīs, suggest Hallaj used the phrase to annul himself and maintained the support of his students and disciples, with political opponents going after him and fabricating heresy against him. ʻAṭṭār writes that Hallaj continued to say “I am the truth” even after being executed, as a mystical spirit resonating the truth as his ashes are scattered in the Tigris River. South Asian literature is also filled in excess in Urdu and Punjabi with references to this, with Iqbal himself considering Hallaj a role model for Muslims seeking liberation. Aurangzeb is also noted to have executed Sarmad for saying this nʿra, which was viewed as anti-Islamic by regressive outlooks on the political and social sphere. In a style emulating Khalil Gibran, Vaikom Muhammad Basheer wrote a short story on Mansour’s life known as Ana Al-Haqq.30 In it Basheer draws a parallel between Anā al-Ḥaqq and Aham Brahmasmi, the Upanishad Mahāvākya, which roughly translates to ‘I am Brahma’ (the Ultimate Reality in Hinduism). There are also some noticeable similarities with the Latin phrase, “Via et veritas et vita” (the way and the truth and the life) allegedly spoken by Jesus in reference to himself.\n\nThe repetition of jo maiñ bhī hūñ, aur tum bhi ho is again present in the last two stanzas by Faiz as a way to emphasize the general people’s role in fermenting a revolution. tum is also used instead of the Persian-derived āp, which denotes a higher degree of respect, signifying there is no formality between the people who will topple authoritarianism and those who put themselves on but (pedestals)."
