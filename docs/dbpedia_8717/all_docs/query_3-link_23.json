        "text": "LAHORE: Anjum Altaf’s book, Transgressions: Poems Inspired by Faiz Ahmad Faiz, was launched at the Lahore University of Management Science (LUMS) on Monday.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion, Salima Hashmi, veteran artist and daughter of Faiz, said the book had brought the past and present together for her.\n\nShe said a number of people had translated her father’s poetry from Urdu into other languages, including English, but they were mere translations and nothing else.\n\n“This book is not a translation of the poetry but it is also carrying the themes, style and message of the poems,” she said and added that it was effectively spreading the message of Faiz’ writings.\n\nSalima recited one of the poems of Faiz in Urdu and also from the book that was in English.\n\nDr Khalid Rehman termed Anjum Altaf’s book an important contribution as it gave an opportunity to the world to read Faiz from a different point of view. He said the book was carrying the myth of the Faiz poems and it was a separate genre of literature.\n\n“I can easily say that Faiz’s poetry cannot be translated but this book is a different and important contribution,” he said.\n\nHe also recited Faiz’ poem, Kuttay, and its English version, Bites, saying that the expression could not be translated into English as there were no stray dogs in English culture like in South Asian societies.\n\nSaima Khawaja said it was amazing to read Faiz’ essence and message in English language and it would also introduce Faiz to the younger generations. She said the book was not for those who had read Faiz in Urdu but it was a good effort and it carried the theme of the Faiz’ poetry. Anjum Altaf said he had written the book after being inspired by the poetry of Faiz.\n\n“Although Faiz Sahib was one of the famous poets of the South Asia, no one knew him in the US and the UK,” he claimed.\n\nHe said it was his effort to disseminate the message of Faiz to other parts of the world. He said as a fan of Faiz he had tried to project the poet in English and it was very difficult to translate Urdu into English.\n\n“I have tried to include the actual theme of the poem in English version. Anyone who has read Faiz Sahib in Urdu can easily recognise the poems through their themes,” he said.\n\nHe recited some of his poems in English and engage the audiences to identify the Faiz’ poem by listening to his own English poem.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 23rd, 2019"
