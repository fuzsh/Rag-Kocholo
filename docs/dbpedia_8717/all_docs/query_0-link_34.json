        "text": "Presented at the Faiz event organised by Poet in the City London 17 January 2011\n\nFaiz Ahmed Faiz is not just a poetic genius; he became the voice of the unseen and unheard and the conscience of a nation. As the first half of twentieth century of Urdu poetry belonged undoubtedly to Muhammed Iqbal, the latter half belonged to Faiz Ahmed Faiz. Iqbal even awarded a poetry prize to a young Faiz while the latter was still a student but even Iqbal could hardly have guessed how another son of Sialkot was soon to inherit his mantle and with what distinction. Between Iqbal and Faiz, Urdu poetry developed from being viewed as a language of love to one of action and politics. Iqbal became the poet philosopher urging an Islamic renaissance and Faiz became the poet of the people, irrespective of creed or nationality.\n\nFaiz Ahmed was born in a small village in Sialkot in 1911 during the time of the British Raj and received a traditional Punjabi Muslim education for the time. He was first sent the local mosque to study the Quran which gave him an excellent grounding in Islam which stood him in good stead for the rest of his life.\n\nFaiz graduated from Murray College, Sialkot and later credited his command of Urdu to the teachers of this college and especially Mir Hasan, who had previously also taught Iqbal Arabic. Faiz then completed his higher education in Lahore where he studied for Masters in both English and Arabic Literature.\n\nFaizâs first published collection, Naqsh-e-faryaadi The Lamenting Image, uses the typical themes of a young Urdu poet â the themes of love, beauty and loss. It is a commonly held perception that a poet creates his best work in youth but this was not to be the case with Faiz, whose first collection begins with what he calls the âemotional preoccupation of youthâ â love, a phase which stayed with Faiz from 1928-29 till about 1934.\n\nA pivotal move for Faiz came in 1934, when he took up a teaching post in Amritsar. It was here that he was exposed to left wing writers and teachers who persuaded Faiz to join the Progressive Writers Association (PWA) and his outlook and poetic leanings were transformed forever.\n\nInspired by the PWA, he now began the second phase of his first poetry collection with the now legendary Do not ask of me, my beloved, that same love. This was Faizâs first experiment with blending love for the âbelovedâ into love for humanity, of turning the pain of separation into pain for all those who suffered as Faiz wrote, under the âdark, bestial spells of uncounted centuriesâ, in which he declares with his now found empathy:\n\nAur bhi dukh hain zamaane mein mohabbat ke siva\n\nThere are other sorrows in this world apart from that of love\n\nFaiz believed passionately that all art had to have a social purpose; art for artâs sake for him was not worthy of being deemed art. He remained committed to the ideal of beauty, but wanted to translate that into a beautiful society was something worthwhile. As he said, âHow can one sing praises to the beauty and fragrance of the rose while ignoring entirely the careworn hands of the gardener?â\n\nBritish colonial rule was now facing a strong challenge in India and Faiz was inspired by his the anti-British sentiment by writing Bol Speak which became seen as the poetical motto of Faizâs life written immediately upon his return from the first PWA conference in Lucknow in 1936. In it, Faiz captured beautifully the longing of the oppressed people wanting freedom urging people to speak out.\n\nWhile now a committed socialist and anti-imperialist, Faiz joined the British Armyâs propaganda wing during WW2 as he believed that Hitler and fascism presented a greater threat to India than the British.\n\nFaiz longed for freedom and the departure of the British colonial structure but wanted that freedom to be coupled with social change; not just the exchange of the one set of rulers for another. His moving poem âIndependence Dawnâ in 1947 records his disillusionment, leading to the first wave of official disapproval within the new state of Pakistan.\n\nNow back in Lahore in the state of Pakistan, Faiz became the first editor of the Pakistan Times. Using this position, Faiz took the lead in trying to highlight the rights of workers, peasants and the poor.\n\nHis first of many arrests was in 1951 when a group of left wing military officers were rounded up in a failed coup attempt; known as the Rawalpindi Conspiracy. Faiz was to send the next four years in jail; facing the possibility of a death sentence. Far from breaking him, the time in jail was to inspire Faiz to even greater literary heights. His second collection of poems resulted in two collections, Dast-e-saba The Breezeâs Hand and Zindan Nama the Prison Journal. Faiz also used his time in jail to help teach the Quran and Islamic education to some other prisoners, much to the confusion and consternation of the jailers who had been told that all the political prisoners arrested were communist atheists!\n\nAfter his release, as his fame grew, so did the fear of successive governments in Pakistan about what Faiz represented and his growing fame and popularity. This was especially true after he was awarded the Lenin Peace Prize in 1962. He was warned by the military government not to accept the award since, by this time; Pakistan had become a military ally of the US with membership of SEATO and CENTO, Asian equivalents to Nato. All progressive voices were now silenced or heavily censored. Faiz proceeded to Moscow anyway to receive his award, and his acceptance speech is worth recalling:\n\nHuman ingenuity, science and industry have made it possible to provide each one of us everything we need to be comfortable provided these boundless treasures of nature and production are not declared the property of a greedy few but are used for the benefit of all of humanityâ¦I believe that humanity which has never been defeated by its enemies will, after all, be successful; at long last, instead of wars, hatred and cruelty, the foundation of humankind will rest on the message of the great Persian poet Hafez Shirazi: âEvery foundation you see is faulty, except that of Love, which is faultless.â\n\nHis quotation of Hafez was no coincidence as Faiz was now to increasingly fuse the traditional Sufi poetry so ingrained and loved in Pakistan with the revolutionary socialist rhetoric he so passionately advocated. Faiz saw absolutely no contradiction in this; the great Sufi poets who wrote in Persian and Punjabi had traditionally spoken of the need of love, dignity and respect for all men irrespective of wealth and status and Faiz often used Islamic phrases and references in his writing.\n\nFaiz was released by 1955 but then again arrested several times during the martial administration of General Ayub Khan. Faiz faced a dilemma when the India-Pakistan war broke out in 1965. Faiz was a patriotic Pakistani but one who recognised the futility and senseless death of war. Almost the whole of Pakistan was overtaken with the patriotic fervour of an all out war with India over Kashmir; a subject dear to almost every Pakistani heart. He was under immense pressure from even other progressive writers to join in with the composition of âpatrioticâ songs. Faiz was one never to bow to the popular or the easy; instead, he wrote the haunting Lament for a dead soldier:\n\nUtho ab mithi se utho\n\nJaago mere laal\n\nGet up from the dust now\n\nWake up my dearest\n\nThe poem made no distinction between Indian and Pakistani soldiers and instead focused on the grief of all families who sons were now buried under mounds of dust while their brides, parents, children and siblings waited in vain for their return. It was a very brave poem for the time; the equivalent of a British poet writing a lament for all German and British soldiers in 1940. Faiz was fortunate not to be imprisoned because of it but was forced to go into hiding for a period following its release.\n\nAfter the trauma of Pakistanâs âsecond partitionâ in 1971 with the bloodshed in East Pakistan culminating in the creation of Bangladesh, Pakistanâs first elected civilian government came to power, and Faiz was appointed its cultural advisor. In that position, he created the Pakistan National Council of the Arts as well as the Lok Virsa, the Institute of Folk Heritage. These are lasting legacies which today are doing much to protect and promote Pakistanâs folk culture. In 1974, he visited the new state of Bangladesh, to repair relations and composed the famous Hum ke thehre ajnabi â We, who became strangers â expressing his sorrow at the events of 1971 though the simile of two former lovers or friends who have now gone their separate ways.\n\nAfter another military coup of 1977 in Pakistan, Faiz chose to go into exile to Beirut rather than face the almost inevitable arrest. Faiz was now increasingly drawn to international issues such as Palestine, apartheid in South Africa and was in Beirut even as Israel helicopter gunships were pounding the PLOâs strongholds there. Faiz managed to leave Beirut just ahead of the tanks of the Israeli army in 1982, and returned to Lahore where he was able to spend the last few years of his life before passing away in 1984.\n\nJust before he died, Faiz went returned again to his ancestral village. There, in a final act of defiance to his detractors who had branded him an atheist and Russian agent â he led the prayers at the local mosque. Today, outside the mosque is a stone on which is currently inscribed his one and only Persian naâat, or ode to the Prophet:\n\nThe rulers on their thrones are slaves to anxieties of land and wealth\n\nUpon the dusty earth, Oh envy of the rulers of the age is thy mendicant!\n\nIf proof were needed, however, of the inspiration that Faiz provided to the people of Pakistan when facing military dictators, it came in 2007/9 when Pakistanâs last military ruler, General Musharraf, removed an irritatingly independent Chief Justice of Pakistan. In the mass rallies to restore the chief justice, it was Faiz who provided the inspiration as only he could.\n\nWa Yabka Wajho Rabbika. This title was taken from a Quranic verse,\n\nKullu man aalayha fanin,\n\nwayabqa wajhu Rabbika Zul Jalali waal-Ikram.\n\nEverything on this planetary existence is ephemeral,\n\nOnly the Majestic and Glorious Countenance of Your Sustainer is Eternal.\n\nâ The Quran 55:26, 27\n\nThe poem is popularly known in Pakistan as Hum DekheiN Ge We shall see, which became the defiant voice of the lawyerâs movement throughout Pakistan which galvanised civil society behind it. The speakers at rallies the length and breadth of Pakistan would recite one line and the crowd would chant back the next until the end of the poem. With each rally and each recitation, the military grip of power weakened and in 2008 Musharraf lost power and the following year the Chief Justice was restored to his post.\n\nIf and when Pakistan does come through its period of turmoil and becomes a country that Faiz had envisaged and suffered so much for, his contribution will have been immense. Through his 73 years he lived through British imperialism, a world war, independence and partition, two martial law administrations in Pakistan, a government position, the separation of East Pakistan and international events which both inspired and saddened him. Faiz did not die a rich man but financial wealth was never his goal. He did not live to see the social democracy in Pakistan he longed for but he left Pakistan a richer and better country. Whatever happens in the future of Pakistan, the only certainty is that poems of Faiz will be the inspiration for all its people seeking a better life. Faiz would undoubtedly have considered that riches enough.\n\nAbout the author\n\nHistorian Farooq Bajwa PhD, author of âPakistan and the West: The First Decadeâ, (Oxford, 1995); âPakistan: An Historic and Contemporary Lookâ, (Oxford 1999 and the forthcoming, âFrom Kutch to Tashkent: a history of the 1965 India-Pakistan Warâ has lectured at a number of universities and institutions and now practices law in London.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nEvery system has its misfits but the religion-based political structure of Pakistan seems to have generated more than its share. Here is a list of a few famous writers, musicians and other creative people who were hunted down in Pakistan instead of having been recognized for their contributions.\n\nI am presenting it here in the hopes that this list will grow with more information from Uddari readers about Pakistanâs âmisfittingâ famous and non-famous creative people.\n\nTHE MISFITS\n\nBy Waseem Altaf\n\nToday i.e. on Sunday 25th July, I was watching a program on Qurattulain Haider on a private channel and I recalled that she had come to Pakistan in 1949. By then she had attained the stature of a world class writer. She joined the Press Information Department and served there for quite some time. In 1959 her greatest novel âAag ka Daryaâ was published. âAag Ka Dariyaâ raised important questions about Partition and rejected the two-nation theory. It was this more than anything else that made it impossible for her to continue in Pakistan, so she left for India and permanently settled there.\n\nSahir Ludhianvi, one of the finest romantic poets of Urdu language settled in Lahore in 1943, where he worked for a number of literary magazines. Everything was alright until after partition when his inflammatory writings (communist views and ideology) in Savera magazine resulted in the issuing of a warrant for his arrest by the Government of Pakistan. In 1949 Sahir fled to India and never looked back.\n\nSajjad Zaheer, the renowned progressive writer Marxist thinker and revolutionary who came to Pakistan after partition, was implicated in Rawalpindi Conspiracy Case and was extradited to India in 1954.\n\nUstad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan was a Pakistani citizen, regarded as one of the greatest classical singers of the sub continent, was so disillusioned by the apathy shown towards him and his art that he applied for, and was granted a permanent Indian immigrant visa in 1957-58. He migrated to India and lived happily thereafter.\n\nAll of the above lived a peaceful and prosperous life in India and were conferred numerous national awards by the Government of India.\n\nSaadat Hassan Manto a renowned short story writer, migrated to Pakistan after 1947. Here he was tried thrice for obscenity in his writings. Disheartened and financially broke he expired at the age of 42. In 2005, on his fiftieth death anniversary, the Government of Pakistan issued a commemorative postage stamp.\n\nZia Sarhadi the Marxist activist and a film director who gave us such memorable films as âFootpathâ and âHumlogâ, was a celebrity in Bombay when he chose to migrate to Pakistan. âRahguzarâ, his first movie in this country, turned out to be the last that he ever directed. During General Ziaul Haqâs martial law, he was picked up by the army and kept in solitary confinement in terrible conditions. The charges against him were sedition and an inclination towards Marxism. On his release, he left the country to settle permanently in the UK and never came back.\n\nFaiz Ahmad Faiz, one of the greatest Urdu poets of the 20th century was arrested in 1951 under Safety Act and charged in the Rawalpindi Conspiracy case. Later he was jailed for more than four years.\n\nProfessor Abdussalam the internationally recognized Pakistani physicist, was disowned by his own country due to his religious beliefs, went to Italy and settled there. He could have been murdered in the land of Islam but was awarded the Nobel prize in the West for his contribution in the field of physics.\n\nUstad Daman, the âsimpletonâ Punjabi poet had a flair of his own. Due to his unorthodox views, many a times he was sent behind bars. Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru offered him Indian citizenship which he refused. The reward he received here was the discovery of a bomb from his shabby house for which he was sent to jail by the populist leader Mr.Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto.\n\nI was wondering, had Mohammad Rafi the versatile of all male singers of the Indian sub-continent chose to stay in Pakistan, what would have been his fate. A barber in the slums of Bilal Gunj in lahore. And Dilip Kumar selling dry fruit in Qissa Khawani Bazaar, Peshawar.\n\nUstad Salamat Ali a bhagwan in Atari turned out to be a mirasi in Wahga all his life. Last time I met him at his rented house in Islamabad, he was in bad shape.\n\nThis state was not created and is not meant for these kind of people. Put on a sherwani and recite nahmadahu wa nussali ala rasool e hil karim if the spirit of times so demands. Or put on a designer suit with puppies in both hands and talk of enlightened moderation. Donât ever defy the status quo, be a part of it, promote it and therein lies the perfect recipe for success.\n\nmwaseemaltaf@hotmail.com\n\nFrom Socialist Pakistan News (SPN)\n\nI know, i can add more names to this list including my own. There are many artists living in Pakistan who have dedicated their lives to their art but have to live through ongoing harassment. Kathak dancer/teacher Naheed Siddiqui in Lahore, Bharat Natyam dancer/teacher and an activist Sheema Kirmani in Karachi have performed miracles by surviving in Pakistan as women creative artists. Fahmida Riaz had to leave with her family to live in India during General Ziaâs period.\n\nIf you know of another âmisfitâ, please add their name to this list via Comments or send us a message at uddari@live.ca.\n\nFauzia Rafique\n\ngandholi.wordpress.com\n\nfrafique@gmail.com\n\nContact Uddari\n\nuddariweblog@gmail.com\n\nFacebook\n\nfacebook.com/UddariWeblog\n\nTwitter\n\ntwitter.com/UddariWeblog\n\n..\n\nI did this interview in Punjabi with the Urdu poet Ahmad FarÄz for my book Humsukhan â conversations with fellow writers which never saw the light of the day. FarÄz used to be in London in transit to western Europe and North America where so many Pakistani political exiles had sought asylum and were leading reasonably easy life. Those were the optimistic days.\n\n18 October 1985. When I meet Ahmad FarÄz in a pub in Piccadilly London, we both talk of the news just in of hanging of a South African poet Benjamin Moloisi at the age of 30.\n\nSwitching on the tape recorder I ask FarÄz: From where shall we start? He starts with a quote from his poem: Qalam surkhroo hai/ ki jo mai ne likha/ vohi aaj main hooN/ vohi aaj tu haiâ¦My pen is placated/ I am what I have written/ I am still the same/ and you too havenât changed.\n\nDoes that mean a poet is answerable to himself primarily; society and ideology come later. FarÄz has also written: Merey qalam ka safar raigaaN na jayeygaâ¦The journey of my pen shall not go in vain. He goes on in chaste Punjabi: âThe journey which involves commitment and some noble cause is not in vain. You canât get the reward in your life time. In South Africa Benjamin has been hanged to death. They canât stop peopleâs unrest with such atrocities. Peopleâs journey never goes in vain. Tears shed in blood or in ink are never lost for nothing.â\n\nBut the commitment with what? With the political movement or with the Party or with the ideology? FarÄz being close to the PPP has to say: No man is isolated and no individual is important. His only strength lies in his thinking, which takes concrete shape in the form of the movement. You are in it in the front line or in the back seat. You get the feel of a vast multitude. Otherwise no individual is great for me, how great he may be. A poet is not confined to his own experiences; he recreates othersâ experiences as well.\n\nBut no politician is honest; they keep on changing their colours. They have to. Thatâs the name of the game. To this FarÄz replies: In spite of his simplicity and sincerity a poet knows where political leaders deviate.\n\nIs it a necessity or sheer opportunism? âIn fact a poet is always the leader. He is with the vanguard leadership and with the rank and file as well. He plays dual role at the same time. When there is something wrong, heâs followed by his inner voice. So there is no need to feel disheartened. One can be silent to observe, to recoup. But personally I have no guts to lead the movement.â\n\nI did not know that FarÄz did not write in his mother tongue Pashto. I donât want to put him on the spot and instead ask him indirectly: whose language is Urdu in Pakistan? He does not like my âstrangeâ question but goes on: âUrhduâ (he pronounces Urdu as Urhdu and the word likhari âwriterâ as Likharhi which sounds to me as Khilarhi â player) doesnât belong to any specific region of Pakistan; itâs the language of some inhabitants of Karachi. What follows is what I really want to know: âMy father Agha Barq was a Farsi poet. His friends who visited our house wrote in Urhdu and the girl I first met knew some romantic Urhdu couplets. I started writing couplets in Urhdu for her. I had to work in Karachi Radio where all the staff was from Lucknow and Delhi. I didnât speak Urhdu well enough, but my written Urhdu wasnât bad though. It canât work in Pashto. Now it is quite hard to go back.â\n\nFarÄz defends the feudal poetic form ghazal thus: It is naÃ¯ve to think in terms of nazm or ghazal. The bread is bread whether it is triangular or round-shaped. All the progressives have written ghazal. Whatâs the point being against the form? The fault doesnât lie with the form but with the poet. Then why Josh Malihabadi didnât write ghazal? FarÄz answers: He was against it from a literary viewpoint. The ghazal is self-contradictory â the clichÃ©s are inherent in it e.g. sÄqi, qafas, bulbul. That way it is just a formula. Bad poetry is written both in the nazm and ghazal forms. Josh and Noon Meem RÄshid were weak ghazalgos. The progressives gave a new life to ghazal. It had become stale. A genre loses its vitality, if it doesnât get new blood. In ghazal you have to say all in just two lines. It didnât suit Josh. He keeps on filling words in his nazms without any imagination. The poem doesnât rise vertically. Faiz and RÄshid brought great themes in ghazal. It is not limited in itself, the poet makes it so. A good ghazalgo writes good nazms. No epic poem surpass this couplet by Ghalib: kahÄN tammanna ka doosra qadamâ¦ It was Ghalib who wrote: Safeena chÄheeye iss bahr-e-bekrÄN ke liyey/ Beqadrey zaraf nahiN hai ye tungnÄyey ghazalâ¦ [A vessel is needed in this endless ocean// the unbounded ocean cannot be contained within the narrow bounds of the ghazal. Interesting that bahr is used for both ocean and metre] and Punjabi is not that developed yet to reject any poetic form. You write in all the forms. One day a Mir will appear in Punjabi. (Majid Sadiqiâs Punjabi translation of FarÄz is titled PartÄN â Layers).\n\nThe peopleâs poet comes up with a sexist example: âRide the ghazal like you ride a woman. Take up the reins in your hands. As the Prophet said: Your wives are a tilth (for you to cultivate). Go to your tilth as yee will.â\n\nThen we travel a long way to Southall in west London where he is staying with his brother. The house is deserted though whiskey and later food appears mysteriously.\n\nNow FarÄz is a bit high and stands up abruptly to bring a framed colour picture showing him shaking hand with Faiz and a femme fatale is standing by FarÄz. The picture makes me sad. I have never seen Faiz so old as he appears in the photo. FarÄz says that it is the last photo taken of Faiz. Then he goes into its minute details. He is eager to talk about the woman. To change the subject I ask him whether he has written any sensual poetry. He recites his couplet: vo ik rÄt guzar bhee chuki magar abb takk/visÄl-e-yÄr kee lazzat se toot-ta hai badanâ¦That night passed long time back/But my body still aches with the relish of my loverâ¦and declares that he believes in the intensity of life. âPoetry is like manhood. Never separate the ethics of poetry from the beauty of life.â Then he picks up the collected poems of Faiz and reads his Punjabi poem aloud: ajj rÄt ikk rÄt dee rÄt jee ke/ asÄN jug hazÄrÄN jee kia e/ajj rÄt amrit de jÄm vÄNgu/ inhÄN hoThÄN ne yÄr nu pea liaa e. Living to the full just one night/I have lived a thousand years/I sipped the body of my lover with my lips/as if it was the goblet of nectar. He adds: you canât find such sensuality in the whole of Urdu poetry. Faiz becomes his own mÄshook lover in his poetry: Subah hoyee to voh pehlu se uThÄ Äkhir-e-shub/ vo jo ik umar se ÄyÄ nÄ gayÄ Äkhir-e-shub. The dawn approached and the one who woke up lying next to me// Had not arrived/nor left me for ages.\n\nI see some sense of estrangement and frustration in visÄl âmeeting with the loverâ in Faizâs poetry. FarÄz doesnât want to listen to me and starts talking again about that woman in the picture. Now he tells me that she is a Sikh and is an air hostess. I interrupt: Faiz or FarÄz? He tells me: I wonât talk about my self. Then Faiz or Jalib?\n\nâYes, on the one hand you talk to the people face to face. That way DÄman and Jalib are very close. On the other hand is Faiz â subtle, soft with new Farsi-tinged imagery. He is poetsâ poet.â\n\nMost of Urdu progressive poetry seems to be written by the same poet. Itâs full of clichÃ©d imagery â zulm, jaddojahad, dÄr-o-rasan, shaheed, khoon and zakham. FarÄz himself is heavily influenced by Faiz and Sahir. Without dropping names I raise the question of evolving new imagery and style. He likes the idea and fully agrees with it. But, he says, âthere is one problem â we canât frog-jump. We like to continue the tradition because our readership is still uneducated.â Is it?\n\nAbout the sound of language, he says: âUrhduâs beauty lies in its plasticity inherited from Farsi and softness of Hindi. No word is soft or crude. It all depends on its usage. A poet has got very few words in his stock. I was in prison for a while. After the release, I had search for words while talking to others. If you donât converse, words tend to leave you. Words are birds, who donât like to perch on dry trees.â He confides: you canât write every day. You feel drained after writing a poem. Faiz used to translate Iqbal during his dry periods to âkeep his weapons in shapeâ. A ghazal can be written while sitting in a moving tonga, but a poem needs much more meditation!\n\nFarÄz has also written nÄtiÄ qalÄm. âIf Faiz could write on a man like Suhravardy, why canât I write on the Prophet?â\n\nThen why was the Rasul against the poets? The poet gives comes up with this face saver: Because he said: it is those poets straying in evil, who follow them; sees thou not that they wander distracted in every valley? And that they say what they practise not?\n\nOur conversation comes to an abrupt end which had started with the notion of poetâs commitment. We both are drunk. I switch off the recorder.\n\nTranslated from the original in Punjabi by the author. September 2008.
