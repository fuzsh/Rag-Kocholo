She was touched with the fact that BIG Pictures, the motion pictures brand from Reliance Big Entertainment Ltd, for paying a tribute to her father the famous Pakistani poet Faiz Ahmed Faiz by incorporating his famous nazm ‘Gulon Mein Rang Bare’ for their upcoming film ‘Sikandar’. The film is scheduled for an April 2009 release.\n\nWith nostalgic feelings, Prof Salima Hashmi said, ‘I am feeling so honored that the lyrics of my father have been included as a beautiful song Gulon Mein in Sikandar. The film is very well crafted out and this song further adds to it’s beauty.

When I and the music director and lyricist started working on the music of the film, we thought of using the mukhda from Faiz Amhed Faiz’s poem and the rest of the song would be a modern interpretation of his lyrics and thought process. The song ‘Gulon Mein’ in the film is a tribute to Faiz and at the same time presents his work in a modern context conveying the essence of ‘Sikandar’.’ Says Director, Piyush Jha, reflecting on the song ‘Gulon Mein’.\n\n‘Sikandar’ is a suspense thriller starring Parzaan Dastur, the adorable little Sardar from film ‘Kuchh Kuchh Hota Hai’, now in his teens, Ayesha Kapur of ‘Black’ Fame as she makes her come back as a lead actress this time along with R. Madhavan, Sanjay Suri & Arunoday Singh in key roles.

Sikandar’ is a film about a young boy who has a dream to play football for the National team. It’s about his aspirations and challenges and how his life unfolds when one fine day he finds a GUN on his way to school and what follows. ‘Sikandar’ is a suspense-thriller with its heart in the right place.
