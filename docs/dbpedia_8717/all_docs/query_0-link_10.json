The things you canât achieve are numerous and frustrating; the things you can achieve are more like happy accidents that can rarely be repeated. In all of world literature there can be few genres less translator-friendly than the classical Urdu ghazal, and in all classical Urdu ghazal there can hardly be a poet more resistant and opaque to translation than Ghalib.\n\nWhat is translation? On a platter\n\nA poet's pale and glaring head,\n\nA parrot's screech, a monkey's chatter,\n\nAnd profanation of the dead.\n\nThe parasites you were so hard on\n\nAre pardoned if I have your pardon,\n\nO Pushkin, for my stratagem.\n\nI travelled down your secret stem,\n\nAnd reached the root, and fed upon it;\n\nThen, in a language newly learned,\n\nI grew another stalk and turned\n\nYour stanza, patterned on a sonnet,\n\nInto my honest roadside proseâ\n\nAll thorn, but cousin to your rose.\n\nâ Vladimir Nabokov\n\n*The Art of Translation* by Vladimir Nabokov, The New Republic, 1941\n\n*My article* on translations of a nazm of Faizâs based on {78,3}\n\nWhen Johnson once glanced at this Liberal Translation of the New Testament, and saw how Dr. Harwood had turned 'Jesus wept' into 'Jesus, the Saviour of the world, burst into a flood of tears', he contemptuously threw the book aside, exclaiming, 'Puppy!'. -- Boswell's Life of Johnson, vol. 3, note 117\n\nOther translation problems (donât worry, there are still plentyâ matters of word choice, background info, etc. etc.)\n\nDavis, Dick, âOn Not Translating Hafez,â The New England Review 35,1-2 (2004): [site]; [on this site]; very relevant for Urdu ghazal too!\n\nBekhud Mohani sums up the gender situation in the ghazal: {111,7}\n\nOn my practice of translating ham as 'we' (to keep open the possibility of 'we lovers', 'we humans'), S. R. Faruqi dissents (July 2019):\n\nI am sorry, I can never reconcile myself to translatingÂ hamÂ as 'we', however much this may be desirable in a very few cases. In actual linguistic-grammatical context in Urdu, bothÂ hamÂ andÂ mainÂ are entirely interchangeable. In very many cases, 'we' asÂ hamÂ sends out entirely wrong signals, at least to me. In ordinary speech,Â hamÂ is more relaxed, informal, even humble. In extremely rare situations, I would useÂ mainÂ instead ofÂ ham when talking to my father, or mother, or older brother/sister. In other situations,Â hamÂ may be ironical. In some, it can be comic. Etc.\n\nhow to provide background info? -- e.g., paper robe info in {1,1}\n\nhow to avoid over-reading? -- a discussion\n\nNazm on poetâs assumed voices, {59,2}\n\nâliverâ {30,2} and other untranslatables\n\nproblems of grotesquerie -- {39,3}\n\non 'padding' -- {17,9}\n\nOf course, this doesnât stop the translators, nor should it.\n\ncomment on: Aijaz Ahmad ones, Bly, Russell, others?\n\nsome examples based on {20};\n\nsome even better examples based on {111}, the famous sab kahaa;N\n\nitâs not as if I have succeeded very well myselfâ\n\n= some of my attempts (1984): {75} and {80}\n\n= more of my attempts (1991): {5}, {49}, {126}\n\n= my one attempt to preserve qaafiyah: {58,1}\n\n= an attempt that I never published: {174,1}\n\nPeter Hookâs neat experiments in English ghazal; compare Agha Shahid Aliâs\n\nthe translatorâs only REAL obligation: TRUTH IN LABELINGâ take whatever liberties you like, then just tell the reader clearly what you've done\n\na few translatable thingsâ a sense of humor {40,2}\n\nsome more or less capturable lyrical moodsâ {35}\n\nsome especially promising âtranslatablesâ are included in the SETS list\n\ndiscussion of dar-o-diivaar one and similar special cases {58}; also {59}\n\nbut: radical untranslatability of âmeaning generatorsâ {32,1}\n\nfour i.zaafats in a row {56,2}\n\nthe futility of criticsâ declarations, SRF on Mir: M{126,5}\n\nNabokov faced a similar problem, and described it very well: 'I have at last discovered the right way to translate Onegin.... I am now breaking it up, banishing everything that honesty might deem verbal velvet'. He sought to make a translation that would be 'ideally interlinear and unreadable'. He recognized that many translations appear to be readable only for unsatisfactory reasons: 'only because the drudge or the rhymester has substituted easy platitudes for the breathtaking intricacies of the text' (Brian Boyd, Vladimir Nabokov: the American Years (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1991, pp. 320, 322, 335).\n\nChoosing a gender for the beloved is one of the worst ordeals, when you set out to translate ghazals into English. No matter what choice you make, it canât really be satisfactory. For the purposes of this commentary I have chosen to make the beloved female, whenever a choice must be made.\n\nOne of the main reasons for this decision is practical convenience: since the lover and almost all other ghazal characters are male, making the beloved female means that she stands out. Pronouns become less ambiguous: you have 'she' and 'her' as well as 'he' and 'his' to help clarify the antecedents of pronouns, without the need for cumbersome explanatory brackets.\n\nAnother reason is that in English, using a default male beloved would make the genre read as exclusively gay love poetry. While in fact all three of the archetypal sets of beloved and lover (Laila-Majnun, Shirin-Farhad, Yusuf-Zulaikha) are heterosexual, as Owen Cornwall has pointed out. (By contrast, Mahmud and Ayaz appear only very rarely.)\n\nA uniquely pan-sexual verse: {65,1}.\n\nSee also {18,4} for the 'henna' verses; also {6,1} with its list of 'veil' verses, many of which will be relevant\n\nexplicated in Nets of Awareness Chapter 12, âPoetry and Moralityâ\n\n(in Nets, I made the beloved masculine-in-quotes)\n\nbeloved as clearly a male youthâ {9,2} has a list; a similar list for Mir: M{60,3}\n\nclassic case making strict heterosexuality impossible: {65,1}\n\nparallel verse by Mir cited in {75,3}\n\nBekhud Mohani {111,7}\n\na helpful article on the beloved as male youth: *C.
