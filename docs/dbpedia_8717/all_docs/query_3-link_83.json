        "text": "Many have attempted to translate Faiz Ahmed, including yours truly humbly on this blog. The list of prominent Faiz translators includes many who are poets in their own right. Most prominent among these is, arguably, Agha Shahid Ali, whose ‘A Country Without a Post Office’ I consider one of the most brilliant poetic works having their roots in contemporary South Asian realities. Others who have also tried their hand at a few Faiz poems are Khushwant Singh and Vikram Seth. Apart from writing fiction, Khushwant Singh is a prolific translator of Punjabi texts. Vikram Seth, a world renowned novelist also known for his travelogues, is a polyglot and has translated several poets from many languages such as Urdu, Chinese.\n\nIn this post I present to you several translations of a very simple and beautiful Qat’a (quartain) of Faiz.\n\nRaat yun dil mein teri khoyi hui yaad aayi,\n\nJaise viraane mein chupke se bahaar aa jaye,\n\nJaise sehraaon mein haule se chale baad-e-naseem,\n\nJaise beemaar ko be-wajhe qaraar aa jaaye.\n\nKhushwant Singh\n\nAt night your lost memory stole into my mind\n\nAs spring silently appears in the wilderness;\n\nAs in desert wastes morning breeze begins to blow\n\nAs in one sick beyond hope, hope begins to grow…\n\nVikram Seth\n\nLast night your faded memory came to me\n\nAs in the wilderness spring comes quietly,\n\nAs, slowly, in the desert, moves the breeze,\n\nAs, to a sick man, without cause, comes peace.\n\nAgha Shahid Ali\n\nAt night my lost memory of you returned\n\nand I was like the empty field where springtime,\n\nwithout being noticed, is bringing flowers;\n\nI was like the desert over which\n\nthe breeze moves gently, with great care;\n\nI was like the dying patient\n\nwho, for no reason, smiles.\n\nSarvat Rahman\n\nLast night, your long-lost memory came back to me as though\n\nSpring stealthily should come to a forsaken wilderness\n\nA gentle breeze its fragrance over burning deserts blow\n\nOr, all at once be soothed somehow the sick soul’s distress.\n\nMy Translation\n\nThe night brought to heart your long lost memory\n\nAnd felt as though spring arrives in a desolate place\n\nIt felt like gentle morning breeze in a desert\n\nAs if without a reason the ailing receives solace.\n\nI like Vikram Seth’s translation the best. It is the truest to the original literally and still manages to retain a certain ‘Faiz-like’ quality to the way it sounds. Agha Shahid’s translation is too laboured and wordy. It makes me think that probably his intended readers are western people who, he might have thought, would not get the South Asian idioms. Sarvat Hussain’s translation is a bit awkward in reading so offers little joy and Khushwant Singh’s reading of Faiz seem to me as if his focus is a little different than Faiz. When I read the qat’a, it seems to me that Faiz is describing the effect of this long lost memory presenting itself. Khushwant Singh seems to describing the mode of arrival of the memory.\n\nHow do you like my translation?\n\nEvery blog worth its name (number of hits) has had something to say about Slumdog Millionaire. I think I should also make the most of this opportunity 🙂 I really have nothing to say about the film that hasn’t already been said but the controversy about its title (slum’dog’) gives me a chance to say my two bits about the language of subversion.\n\nHip-hop music and culture in USA has a ‘slanguage’ of its own in which the word ‘dog’ has a special place because of the frequency and flexibility with which it is used. Among other things it is used as a common noun for ‘person’, especially a friend or a term of endearment. It would be a bit off the mark to say that the word has lost all the derogatory connotations but the usage in hip-hop/rap is a bit complex.\n\nLet me draw a parallel with the feminine of the word ‘dog’- ‘bitch’. ‘Bitch’ has a long history of being used as a derogatory word for women. The connotations are those of ‘lewd’, ‘on heat’, ‘sexually promiscuous’. Also associated is the verb ‘bitch’- when one is ‘bitching’ she (he?) is ‘gossiping’ or ‘back-biting’. Today a ‘sexually promiscuous’ woman is plainly called a ‘slut’ or a ‘whore’ (‘hoe’ in hip-hop). A ‘bitch’ is a woman who is straying away from the feminine conventions; she makes no effort to be obedient and pleasant. In hip-hop its cool to be a ‘bitch’. Many female rappers call themselves and girl friends ‘bitch’ just as African-American rappers also frequently call themselves and others ‘nigga’ and ‘dog’.\n\nThere is a derogatory subtext but it is full of subversion.\n\nSo, why so much hue and cry over the film title? Let me try an explanation using again the ‘bitch’ example. While it may be cool when a close girlfriend calls me a ‘bitch’, I would definitely take it as an insult if someone not close were to throw the word at me. Two African-American rappers may call each other ‘nigga’ but a white person using the n-word would be inflicting a racial slur. Is the title ‘Slumdog Millionaire’ derogatory, then?\n\nThe slum‘dog’ controversy reminded me of Faiz Ahmed Faiz‘s Kuttey (Dogs). I wonder what people may have to say of it…\n\nYeh galiyon key aavaara bekaar kuttey\n\nKe bakhsha gaya jin ko zoq-e-gadaai\n\nZamaney ki phitkaar sarmaaya un ka\n\nJahaan bhar ki dhutkaar in ki kamaai\n\nNa aaram shab ko, na rahat saveyrey\n\nGhalaazat mein ghar, naaliyon main baseyrey\n\nJo bigrein to ik doosray say lara do\n\nZara ek roti ka tukra dikha do\n\nYeh har ek ki thokerain khaney waley\n\nYeh faaqon say uktaa kay mar janey waley\n\nYeh mazloom makhlooq gar sar uthaey\n\nTo insaan sab sarkashi bhool jaey\n\nYeh chaahain to duniya ko apna bana lein\n\nYeh aaqaaon ki haddiyaan tak chaba lein\n\nKoi in to ehsaas-e-zillat dila dey\n\nKoi in ki soee hui dum hila dey\n\nMy rough translation…\n\nthese vagrant, aimless streets dogs\n\nthe flair for beggary has been conferred upon them\n\ntheir net asset is being scorned by their times\n\nrebukes of the entire world their earnings\n\nNo rest in the evening nor reprieve at dawn\n\nhoused in filth, dwellings in drains\n\nif they agitate, pit one against the other\n\nshow them a piece of roti\n\nputting up with getting kicked by all\n\nthey tire of being starved and die\n\nIf this oppressed species were to arise\n\nhumans would forget all domineering\n\nthey can own the world if they’d only wish\n\nthey can chew up even the bones of the masters\n\nSomebody stir them to feel their mortification\n\nsomebody move their sleeping tail\n\nTo me it looks like that using what is considered, foul/uncouth language for one self (or others who share the oppressed identity) is a way of arousing an oppressed people to feel their mortification, humiliation, and thereby, a subversive act. Young people tend to use slang more than any other age group because they find in this a convenient and cool way to display their irreverence towards what is established, traditional and the norm. Language full of slang, coarse and swear words is an act of defiance against authority- a way of expressing hostility and pent-up aggression, safely. In this way, it becomes one of the most used ‘weapons of the weak’.\n\nSo much has happened in the last couple of months and it has left an unsavoury taste in lots of interactions, expressions and friendships. Mumbai attacks claimed hundreds of lives but people were not the only casualties. For weeks I went about my life, feeling inwardly as if I had experienced a personal loss. Like when my parents died.\n\nKosi floods had pained me as did the images of recent repression in Kashmir. The encounter of young Raj from Bihar had me shaking my head in disbelief and sadness at being a citizen of police state. But this was something different… It was personal. It could not be otherwise when a friend told me that, “in times like this when Imams want to wear black bands on Eid and Muslim groups don’t want terrorists to be buried on Indian soil, you of all intellegensia (sic) should sense the dominant mood and that perhaps its very WORTHWHILE for Muslims all over the world to say that TERROR in name of Islam should be stopped.” Another person said “Although some members of the Muslim community do express condemnation, on the whole I do feel that the Muslim community has not expressed enough outrage at some of the terrible atrocities that some extremists have committed in the name of their religion over the last decade or so especially.”\n\nThese people were essentially just agreeing with American Hawk journalist Thomas Friedman when he says “But at the end of the day, terrorists often are just acting on what they sense the majority really wants but doesn’t dare do or say. That is why the most powerful deterrent to their behavior is when the community as a whole says: “No more. What you have done in murdering defenseless men, women and children has brought shame on us and on you.”\n\nAnother person said, “It is actually the welfare of the Muslim community that is at the heart of this argument… it is a religion and a community that has some serious thinking to do at many many levels…” (all this exchange took place online when the friend mentioned above CC’ed an e-mail, containing a link to this Friedman article from New York Times, to several of her friends saying it was a “worthwhile read” and I hit the reply all button to say that I was, “Really saddened to see that you thought this dangerous ranting against Muslims in general a ‘worthwhile read’.)\n\nI mulled and agonised over all this when I sat in winter sun in the park and watched my 3 year old daughter Miftah play and call for more of my attention. “Amma dekhiye… AMMA!” The comments hammered on my heart and left me gasping for air every time I thought of it. “Muslims all over the world“? Me included? Miftah included? The terrorists were acting on what I and millions of Muslims around the world want but do not dare to do? And what they have done has brought shame on me and my daughter? Then, obviously, many people think it is not enough that I condemn the attack as a human being but that I should somehow feel responsible and ashamed because I am a Muslim and condemn the attacks as a Muslim.\n\nI looked at Miftah and felt scared for her… I did not feel this scared even during and after the Gujarat 2002 violence. Those days, at least from the security of the small world of development professional/social activists, I heard many sane voices of reason and compassion. No one was calling for people who condemned the communal carnage to identify their religion.\n\nI told my friend that it saddened me but it just scared life out me to realise that this was the world that my Miftah will be doing her growing up and living in. For weeks, I couldn’t muster words to respond except to apologise for my inadequate e-mail attequettes- having hit the reply all button.\n\nMy friend, philosopher and guide Dr. Manoj Jha sends out new years wishes every year. This year he chose this ghazal by Faiz Ahmad Faiz to go on the card. I think, it just so aptly and beautifully says what I struggled to in the earlier paragraphs of this post but couldn’t really. It will suffice if my English translation conveys how I feel even to a few people.\n\nHum ke thhehre ajanabi itni madaraaton ke baad\n\nPhir banenge aashnaa kitani mulaqaaton ke baad\n\nKab nazar mein aayegi bedaagh sabze ki bahaar\n\nKhoon ke dhabbe dhulenge kitni barasaaton ke baad\n\nDil to chaha par shikast-e-dil ne mohalat hi na di\n\nKuchh gile-shikave bhi kar lete munajaaton ke baad\n\nThe bohot bedard lamhen khatm-e-dard-e-ishq ke\n\nThien bahut bemehr subahein meharabaan raaton ke baad\n\nUn se jo kahane gaye the “Faiz” jaan sadaqaa kiye\n\nAnkahi hi rah gae vo baat sab baaton ke baad\n\nEven after much warm hospitality we stand unfamiliar\n\nAfter how many meetings shall we again get acquainted\n\nWhen shall we see a spotless spring in the fields again\n\nHow many rains shall it take to wash the blood stains off\n\nThough the heart wished, it did not allow its defeated self\n\nTo make complaints after whispering words of prayers\n\nMerciless were the moments when the throbbing of love ended\n\nUnpitying were the mornings that followed the compassionate nights\n\nWith the gift of your own life, Faiz, what you went to tell them\n\nThat matter remained unsaid when all had been expressed\n\nThe past few weeks have also included conversations with friends that gave much hope and I do not wish to end this post at a pessimistic note so here is an Arundhati Roy quote, that my friend Aanchal Kapoor mailed me.\n\n“Sometimes — quite often — the same people who are capable of a radical questioning of, say, economic neo-liberalism or the role of the state, are deeply conservative socially — about women, marriage, sexuality, our so-called ‘family values’ — sometimes they’re so doctrinaire that you don’t know where the establishment stops and the resistance begins. For example, how many Gandhian/Maoist/ Marxist Brahmins or upper caste Hindus would be happy if their children married Dalits or Muslims, or declared themselves to be gay? Quite often, the people whose side you’re on, politically, have absolutely no place for a person like you in their social, cultural or religious imagination. That’s a knotty problem politically radical people can come at you with the most breathtakingly conservative social views and make nonsense of the way in which you have ordered your world and your way of thinking about it and you have to find a way of accommodating these contradictions within your worldview.”\n\nPeace All.\n\nAll of us who are interested in subversive, revolutionary or political poetry have read our Nerudas, Faizs, Lorkas and maybe even Hikmet but in my opinion more contemporary than any of these is Punjabi poet Paash. Pash was slain by Khalistani separatists on March 23, 1987 1988. Paash never went to college as a regular student and did not have a graduate degree but saw his own poems become part of Punjabi literature curriculum in many universities. His poem “Sabse khatarnaak” (The Most Dangerous) has gone on to become very popular and is now even part of the NCERT curriculum. Heres a translation…\n\nThe Most Dangerous\n\nMost treacherous is not the robbery\n\nof hard earned wages\n\nMost horrible is not the torture by the police.\n\nMost dangerous is not the graft for the treason and greed.\n\nTo be caught while asleep is surely bad\n\nsurely bad is to be buried in silence\n\nBut it is not most dangerous.\n\nTo remain dumb and silent in the face of trickery\n\nEven when just, is definitely bad\n\nSurely bad is reading in the light of a firefly\n\nBut it is not most dangerous\n\nMost dangerous is\n\nTo be filled with dead peace\n\nNot to feel agony and bear it all,\n\nLeaving home for work\n\nAnd from work return home\n\nMost dangerous is the death of our dreams.\n\nMost dangerous is that watch\n\nWhich run on your wrist\n\nBut stand still for your eyes.\n\nMost dangerous is that eye\n\nWhich sees all but remains frostlike,\n\nThe eye that forgets to kiss the world with love,\n\nThe eye lost in the blinding mist of the material world.\n\nThat sinks the simple meaning of visible things\n\nAnd is lost in the meaning return of useless games.\n\nMost dangerous is the moon\n\nWhich rises in the numb yard\n\nAfter each murder,\n\nbut does not pierce your eyes like hot chilies.\n\nMost dangerous is the song\n\nwhich climbs the mourning wail\n\nIn order to reach your ears\n\nAnd repeats the cough of an evil man\n\nAt the door of the frightened people.\n\nMost dangerous is the night\n\nFalling in the sky of living souls,\n\nExtinguishing them all\n\nIn which only owls shriek and jackals growl,\n\nAnd eternal darkness covers all the windows.\n\nMost heinous is the direction\n\nIn which the sun of the soul light\n\nPierces the east of your body.\n\nMost treacherous is not the\n\nrobbery of hard earned wages.\n\nMost horrible is not the torture of police\n\nMost dangerous is not graft taken for greed and treason.\n\nTranslation by Dr.Satnam Singh Sandhu of Punjabi University, Patiala\n\nReading Paash hits one hard- he doesn’t care for the usual niceties associated with the poetry. He just spews forth the disgust, the anger, and sometimes the despair and frustration he feels without hididng them… naked, just as the words are born in his mind. He says…\n\nYou are not aware that I am equated in poetry\n\nWith the entry into a passionate mujrah\n\nOf a stray dog.\n\nYou think that for some dangerous party\n\nI burn the midnight oil\n\nAnd keep writing.\n\nYou are not aware how I approach a poem-\n\nLike a village belle wearing old fashioned clothes\n\ngets into city showrooms, frenzied\n\nMy translation of Tumhein Pata Nahin (You Are Not Aware) from Hindi Translation of original Punjabi by Dr Chaman Lal of JNU.\n\nNot only does Paash not write pretty and sensuous poetry like, say, Faiz he actually feels disdain for the whole genre. This is where I personally, disagree with him. He totally dismisses Ghazals as being trivial, flowery and empty of any meaning. When Faiz says, “Mujse pehli si muhabbat mere mehboob na maang” (Do not ask me, my love, for the old love) he makes another (and equally powerful and moving) kind of political poetry.\n\nDo not ask me…\n\nDo not ask me, my love, for the old love\n\nI had thought life is aglow with your presence\n\nThe sorrows of the world negligible when compared with agony of your love\n\nFrom your face, the spring gets its permanence in creation\n\nWhat else does the world have if not your eyes?\n\nIf I get you the fate will submit to me\n\nIt would not really but I wished it merely\n\nThere are sorrows other than those of love in the world\n\nThere are joys other than those of a union with you\n\nDreadful dark spells of countless centuries\n\nWoven in silk, satin and brocade\n\nBodies on sale here and there in streets, markets\n\nSmeared of ashes, drenched in blood\n\nBodies right our of ovens of diseases\n\nPus oozing out of rotting wounds\n\nOne cannot help but turn to look that ways too\n\nOne cannot help it even though your beauty is still heart-warming\n\nThere are sorrows other than those of love in the world\n\nThere are joys other than those of a union with you\n\nDo not ask me, my love, for the old love\n\n(My translation)\n\nBut it is because of Paash that contemporary Punjabi poetry has a face… for long Punjabi poetry has meant only Sufi poets such as Bulle Shah, Waris Shah, Baba Farid etc only. Shiv Batalvi was also Paash’s contemporary but his popular romantic poetry (made even more popular by Jagjit Singh) does not have that kind of iconic status. The Hindi translations of Paash by Dr Chaman Lal are so popular that many people think Paash wrote originally in Hindi!\n\nHis politics was as complicated as the times he lived in- so even as he began writing his brand of poetry when he got to know some Naxalite activists, in his own life he practiced politics of not just sangharsh (struggle) but also of nirman (construction). Paash brought our handwritten magazine promoting scientific attitude for people living in villages surrounding Uggi village where he ran a progressive school for many years. During his lifetime he was associated with many literary magazines. Just as Paash was not afraid to question powers that be, he was also not afraid to question his comrades. Following is my translation of one of the poems of a series he called “Comrade se baat-cheet” (Conversations with Comrade). This poem and the whole series seems especially contemporary given the going-ons at Nandigram.\n\nConversation With Comrade-5\n\nComrade, do you occasionally get a newspaper?\n\nDon’t believe the piecemeal news.\n\nLast year the one who drowned in the village pond…\n\nIt was not mother.\n\nA brick got disengaged from the blue terrace and fell down.\n\nAt the very first raid, mother\n\ntrying to swim through Gorky’s novel\n\nran away from the police.\n\nat the banks of the novel\n\nand sometimes fades like her own blessings.\n\nAnd recently, the poet\n\nwho was in news for joining the party safely\n\nit was not I, it was a Dek tree on the outside wall\n\nwhich bad spirits, wearing police uniforms\n\nhad learnt to climb up and down.\n\nLong before that news went to print,\n\nwhen night was sliding into words\n\nand the dark- like cobra, sat coiled on names…\n\nI stole whatever remained of the party’s compassion\n\nand slid down…stole away\n\ninto the human clamour\n\nWhen my own feet were listening to me\n\nlike love poems\n\nI went and put the waning compassion\n\ncarefully among crow’s eggs\n\nTo Sadhu Singh and Jirvi*, I have complained\n\nmany times about these news.\n\nWho say that the paralysis of news\n\ndoes not let them walk on their own feet\n\nthey ask for crutches of our death\n\n“if we believed their truth\n\nwe would have cried over you many times over.”\n\nEvery time I read the news of a sudden raid\n\nI tell mother-\n\nIts not you, but another warrior with your name\n\nMother knows nothing of grammatical nuances\n\nShivering in the chilling innocence of old age\n\nShe mistakes a naming word for a caste name\n\nand a caste name for a collective noun\n\nFor her whenever a bullet is fired on a name\n\nSome caste or some emotion is murdered\n\nComrade, mother is anyways crazy\n\nBoth of us and news cannot change her\n\nFor coming home late, she will\n\nWith any household object\n\nOr with the whole house, beat you and later\n\nStuff her dry breast in your mouth\n\n*Names of Editors of Punjabi dailies"
