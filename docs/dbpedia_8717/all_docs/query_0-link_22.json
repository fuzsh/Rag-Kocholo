        "text": "My Masters dissertation explores various factors pertaining to numerous occasions in poet's life which conflict with each other and these factors collate and thus leads to certain manifestation of these conflicting impulses in the form of poetic art. My study is based upon the English translations of the poetry of a renowned Indian poet Gulzar who writes in Hindustani language which is a mixture of Hindi and Urdu languages.\n\nThe paper looks at the mystique of the poetic process and the manner in which the subterranean cultural and primal patterns of the mind of the poet – Yasmeen Hameed, manifest themselves in the lyrics. Contrary to the western paradigm of duality such patterns are studied in the light of the oriental Sufi tradition where I and you pine for each other. The thee is perceived as the core and the me is in a perpetual quest/voyage gyrating towards the core. The convergence of these two poles is the unison that has both aesthetic/intellectual relevance as well as spiritual resonances for the reader and the poet alike. This gravitational pull finds expression in an idiom that is almost metaphysical in the poetry of Yasmeen Hameed. The paper explores how the two poles of the artistic process, the technical craftsmanship and content converge and finds expression in a language that is transparent as well as veiled. It also studies the way in which the visceral, existential poetic experience con...\n\nCreativity is one of the most fascinating facets of humans that has fascinated thinking minds since the dawn of civilisation. Because of the mysterious nature and mystical aura surrounding creativity, it has elicited attention of the thinkers and sages in different societies and cultures for more than the last four millennia. In pre-Socratic Greece, creativity is attributed to the goddess Muse who presided over the arts and science. In Egypt and Levant priests weaved grand stories around the creation of the universe and its entities. Spiritual and fiery beings called jinn inspired Arab poets in the pre-Islamic period. They carry the meaning of invisible, hidden and mysterious. 1 Aristotle in his book, 'Poetics,' 2 tried to explain the origin and development of poetry and its different kinds. There is a long list of poets, thinkers, sages, priests and philosophers who have attempted to explicate creative élan that transforms the ordinary and transient experience into an infinite metaphor and infuses meaning into a work of art.\n\nFaiz Ahmad Faiz is one of the most prolific writers in Pakistan, well-known for his poetry collections. He lived during the most crucial period in the history of India and Pakistan. His poems are notable for their aesthetic and artistic values. In the latter part of his literary career, he started incorporating revolutionary ideas in his poems. He is among the most prominent progressive writers who lived during that period. Literature can always be used to influence the common people’s mind. Literature and politics are always interwound with each other. This paper studies the writings of Faiz Ahmed Faiz, and brings out how his poems are loaded with political metaphors and foresees how the poet has used radical ideas throughout his writings to kindle the minds of men of the working class and bring about a political change in their society.\n\nThis paper peeps into the poetry of Syed Ali Hamid who is known for his naturalness, cosmopolitan vision and loving heart. He is a poet of desire—desire which creates hopes resulting in a new life. As he writes ghazal in English, he knows how to make his poems beautiful with figures. With his poetry, he experiences life and attempts to search for the philosophical sense of the quest for meaning. He turns the abstract into concrete and thus colours the ontology of desire to make the readers feel its presence.\n\nWith a view to make his language ingenious and resourceful, a poet often resorts to a language divergent to the predictable and everyday language of his times. Stylistic analysis reveals that poets employ a number of techniques to bring about linguistic deviation thus resulting into foregrounding of the key elements. A. K. Ramanujan is one of the most gifted poets, remarkably original in his art; creating his own style and structure and imparting an all new hue to his verse. This paper attempts to analyze the typical elements of foregrounding present in the poems of A. K. Ramanujan."
