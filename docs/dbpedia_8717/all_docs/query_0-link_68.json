        "text": "Eid mubarak to everyone around the world. Eid ul Azha always reminds of this sher by Iqbal - Sikhaye kis ne Ismail ko aadaab e farzandi.\n\nHere's the complete ghazal. Take care. See you soon with another episode.\n\nI have always been fascinated by Aanis's kalaam. It has that je na sais quoi, that will keep you bound to it.\n\nDo check out more of his works, if you already haven't.\n\nMail me at aamir@urdudaan.in\n\nInstagram - www.instagram.com/urdu.daan\n\nYou can find all episodes at www.urdudaan.in\n\nWinters! Its a whole different time isnt it. Fun, if you're a winter person like me. The jitters. The blankets. The clothes.\n\nI read this ghazal and got a real wintry feeling. Sharing it with you. Do let me know your thoughts at aamir@urdudaan.in\n\nI had to look twice at the already posted episodes to check if i have posted this before. That is how much i love this ghazal, and that is how likely it is for me to go on reciting it.\n\nAdeem Hashmi, no introductions needed, was an outstanding poet of recent times. This poem, the metre, the lines, the vibe it emanates - all of it, i have tried to capture in this episode. Let me know if you could feel and not just listen to this one.\n\nWrite to me at aamir@urdudaan.in\n\nor drop me a DM @urdu.daan on instagram\n\nyou can also check out the dedicated Podcast website - www.urdudaan.in\n\nEnjoy listening :)\n\nAdaab everyone. کیسے مزاج.\n\nI have kept you waiting for long, but trust me, this is going to be worth your while. I bring to you the Guftugu series, where i bring you poets from the urdu world, modern day poets. The first in this series is one of my personaly favorites, Zia Mazkoor. A simple man, who can literally mesmerise you with his not so simple poetry.\n\nThis is a new addition to what you have been listening to, on your favourite urdu podcast. Pardon the quality, but i assure you we are working on it. Do drop in your feedback at aamir@urdudaan.in\n\nYou can also visit us on Instagram at\n\nwww.instagram.com/urdu.daan\n\nUntil next time, Stay blessed.\n\nAre you a poet? or someone in love with a poet? If you're a poet, im sure you can relate with this beautifully penned nazm. If you're the latter, im more than sure that this might have happened to you. A wonderful story, written so poetically, it really gives you goosebumps. Suniye aur bataiye, Mesam sb ki nazm - Wo call.\n\nWhat a melodious and teasing ghazal this is. I remember hearing it from Team Sukhan for the first time at Jashn e Rekhta. Not only is the internal rhythm of the ghazal amazingly chosen, but the lyrics of this piece of poetry by Bismil sb just make you click your fingers. Let me know if you share the same emotion. I am aamir@urdudaan.in\n\nalso, those of you who can't access the urdu daan podcast on spotify, be sure to visit our website www.urdudaan.in for the podcast and many other goodies.\n\nUntil next time.\n\nSometimes it really feels like the universe conspires to get your wandering attention towards something. First, when i was posting a picture on my social media, the first sher of this ghazal just came to me, like a memory or an inspiration. Soon after, i saw this sher on Rekhta. and thirdly, which actually became the push, someone messaged me on @urdu.daan, asking me to recite it. Voila, the signs were complete. I sat down to record it. What a beautifully lovelorn ghazal this is, just what our ancestors would call a ghazal.\n\nLet me know your thoughts at aamir@urdudaan.in or you can DM me at @urdu.daan or even visit the renovated website www.urdudaan.in\n\nUntil next time\n\nA conversation between poets Aamir Azher & Zoya Rao\n\nSo i had been thinking about adding a new genre to the Urdu daan podcast for a long time. Enter Zoya, who had been wanting to work on a podcast too. Voila, where two like minded people meet, an idea is born.\n\nIn this first episode, we do introductions, speak about a general idea of things, our opinions, alike and differing; we talk about how poetry seeps into our lives without us knowing, and then we finally share some poetry.\n\nWe would love to have your feedback on this theme setting episode, which is as a first for us as it is for you.\n\nyou can mail me at aamir@urdudaan.in and Zoya at zoyaraowafa@yahoo.com\n\nSo i had been getting a lot of feedback saying you guys want a longer episode - this is one way of doing it, where i have done 3 ghazals for your listening pleasure. Will be working on more ideas.\n\nShare yours at aamir@urdudaan.in\n\nThis ghazal is one of those things that on the surface just pass you by like a breeze, but slowly, as you delve deeper, it seeps into your breath, your very blood. So beautifully written, with such touching aspects of life covered, i haven't been able to overcome its magic, and its been a month now. Do share your thoughts if feel the same.\n\nWrite to me at aamir@urdudaan.in\n\nis ghazal ka ek pasandeeda sher -\n\nhai rah o rasm e zamana parda e begaangi\n\ndarmiyan rahta hoon main sab ke magar sab se alag\n\nTo part with your beloved is one grief too many. But to be reminded of it, on a slow journey, when you happen to pass the very place you saw her last. Akhtar ul Iman has woven tragedy with poison - it gets under your skin so fast.\n\nMail me at aamir@urdudaan.in\n\nwww.urdudaan.in\n\nI am yet to find a better consolation than the one found in this nazm. Made famous by Jagjit Singh.\n\nWrite to me at aamir@urdudaan.in\n\nI am @urdu.daan on instagram.\n\nSend in requests or feedback if you have any :)\n\nYou must have surely heard of this one. Probably in Amitabh Bachan's voice. But that was only half the deal. This here is the complete nazm by Sahir, the ultimate post - scatter !\n\nThe podcast is also available on youtube as the Urdu Daan Podcast, check it out -\n\nwww.youtube.com/urdudaanpodcast\n\nMelocholia and Poetry are the perfect pair aren't they? But not everyone can make sadness sing. Presenting a beautiful ghazal by Adeem sb.\n\nThe Urdu daan podcast can also be found on Youtube now - www.youtube.com/urdudaanpodcast\n\nPs. We hit the Top 200 charts in India. Mubarakbaad to all.\n\n“I am no bird; and no net ensnares me: I am a free human being with an independent will.”\n\n― Charlotte Brontë, Jane Eyre\n\nThanks to an Urdu Daan Podcast listener, I was reminded of this brilliant nazm. If you find it difficult to understand entirely, you can always msg/mail me to discuss it.\n\ndo share your views with me @ urdudaanmail@gmail.com or visit me @urdu.daan on instagram.\n\nBahadur Shah Zafar, the last king of Mughal India, was quite an accomplished poet. This ghazal of his has been sung widely, and I personally believe that the theme of loss, maybe even the loss of power and the throne, which is a constant theme in his works, can also be seen here. Let me know if you think so too.\n\nFind me at urdudaanmail@gmail.com\n\nThis is a difficult nazm to bear. For someone who hasn't undergone a 'kaifiyat' such as this, it might even be hard to relate. But it is a painstakingly accurate insight into a, should i say, nihilistic night of a sensitive man.\n\nLet me know your thoughts @ urdudaanmail@gmail.com\n\nJaun's poetry has a special flavour to it. It's that 80% Dark chocolate, that everybody wants to have but in the long run, is clearly not for all.\n\n#justmidnightthoughts\n\nUrdu daan is also available on Youtube now.\n\nwww.youtube.com/urdudaanpodcast\n\nAre you fond of reality? or being realistic? Then this Saleem Kausar's Ghazal is an insight into that longing. Saleem Kausar is famous for the Ghazal, Main khayal hoon kisi aur ka.\n\nWould you like to buy me a chai? Please visit\n\nwww.buymeacoffee.com/urdudaan\n\nMomin Khan Momin, a contemporary of Ghalib, was famous for his romantic poetry. This ghazal has not only immortalised Momin, but love itself.\n\nThe singer in this track is Manjari ji. There have been many renditions of this Ghazal, and Manjari ji has added another soulful layer to it. This is a link to her track.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0sYZhPe2jY\n\nUrdu Daan is also available on YouTube now - https://www.youtube.com/urdudaanpodcast\n\nYou also might want to head on to www.buymeacoffee.com/urdudaan to support me\n\nLove isn't a triangle, or a circle.
