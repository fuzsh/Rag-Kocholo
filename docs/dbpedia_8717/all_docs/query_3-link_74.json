It also sets up the right expectations for the readers in terms of the genre of poems.\n\nFor the poet, it is an opportunity to connect with your readers, as there may be several others out there who are passionate about the topics that you find interesting and important enough to write about.\n\nThere are different ways to go about selecting themes for your book and determine how many you need.\n\nA rudimentary way to quantify the theme count is to go with a very basic rule — one theme per poem.\n\nI am planning to have 15 poems in my Poetry collection.\n\nSo, 15 poems need 15 themes.\n\nThis, of course is not completely true, as one theme can span multiple poems and one poem can have multiple themes, but having a baseline always helps me and my engineeringly programmed brain."
