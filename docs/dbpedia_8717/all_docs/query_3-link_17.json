        "text": "ABSTRACT Literature is regarded as the constructive representation of the society. It generally captures the artistic aestheticism and particularly it addresses the realities associated with society. The poetry is considered as the most moving tendency in all the genres of literature. It fairly encompasses the social as well as natural subjects of an era. It interestingly saves the remains and relics of any cultural as well as national heritage. It plays an important role to invoke the change in any society. The element of revolution in the poetics has enjoyed a celebrated status since last three centuries. There are poets who fill the spirit across nationwide with their poetic genius. Different poets such as Pablo Neruda, Lorca, Shaikh Ayaz, Nazim Hikmet and Habib Jalib have perfectly pictured the harsh realities of the society. Vladimir Mayakovski from Russia and Faiz Ahmed Faiz from Pakistan are counted in the list of forefront revolutionary poets of the world. Both poets poetically as well as practically marked their name in the revolutionary arena. This research follows the theory of Social Realism initiated by Karl Marx which helps to understand that no piece of art and literature is just created for amusement; rather there are certain social realities that make a way towards the development of more faithful literature. The researcher has comparatively analyzed the gathered data according to the theoretical framework. In the end, it comes into consideration that Faiz and Mayakovski infer their revolutionary genius from their surroundings. They voice for revolution just because the society motivates them to do so. The current study, as a whole, tends to aware the upcoming researchers and students to observe this edge of social reality as well. Key Words: Social Disturbance, Revolution, Comparative Analysis, Marxism."
