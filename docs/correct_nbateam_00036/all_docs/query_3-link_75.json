        "text": "Carlos Delfino and the Milwaukee Bucks have agreed to terms on a three-year deal, according to a report from Adrian Wojnarowski of Yahoo!:\n\nDelfino spent last season in Houston but was released by the Rockets in order to free up salary cap space for the addition of center Dwight Howard. The deal reunites Delfino with Milwaukee, where he spent the three seasons prior to signing with Houston.\n\nHe served primarily as a reserve for the Rockets but nonetheless averaged 10.6 points per game, which ranked fifth on the team. More than two-thirds of his field goal attempts came from three-point range, where he shot 37.5 percent.\n\nDelfino appeared in 178 games for Milwaukee from 2009 through 2012, and it was the Bucks who made him a regular member of a starting lineup for the first time in his career. He averaged a career-high 11.5 points per game during the 2010-11 season.\n\nMore from SB Nation:\n\n• Howard picks Rockets | Prada: How Morey got his man\n\n• Ziller: Lakers need a miracle\n\n• Josh Smith signs with Detroit | Iguodala to Golden State\n\n• The NBA's top 90 free agents | All NBA free agency news"
