        "text": "By of the\n\nMilwaukee Bucks forward Carlos Delfino posted on his personal website Sunday that his foot injury will require additional surgery and it is likely he will miss the entire 2013-'14 season.\n\nDelfino injured his right foot in the NBA playoffs last season when he was with the Houston Rockets and he underwent surgery in May. He was in a walking boot when the Bucks opened training camp in September and said he had suffered a setback in his recovery.\n\n\"The reality is the fracture that was found in August marked a setback in the recovery,\" Delfino, a native of Argentina, said in Spanish on his website.\n\n\"I'm frustrated because I did all the recovery work but my body did not respond as expected,\" he continued. \"I'm still optimistic.\"\n\nDelfino and Bucks team physician Michael Gordon traveled to North Carolina last week to consult with specialists about the injury. And it was determined Delfino will need another surgery to repair the fracture in his right foot, with recovery time estimated at four to six months.\n\n\"Now I have to be calm and open to the decision of the professionals who can help me in the recovery of my injury,\" Delfino posted. \"This was worse than I expected but I am sure that I will return to the court.\"\n\nThe Bucks signed the 31-year-old Delfino for help at the small forward position, bringing back a player who spent three years in Milwaukee and was part of the 2010 playoff team. Delfino signed a two-year deal worth $6.5 million, with a third non-guaranteed year.\n\nLater in the summer the Bucks made a trade with Phoenix to acquire Racine native Caron Butler, who has emerged as the team's starting small forward. The hope was for Delfino to return this season to provide depth at the position, but now that will not happen.\n\nThat piece of bad news comes just as the schedule is about to heat up for the Bucks, who have played just five games over the first two weeks of the season.\n\nThe Bucks (2-3) head to Miami on Monday to begin a rugged three-game road swing, facing the Heat on Tuesday night and the Orlando Magic on Wednesday night. Then it's a trip to Indianapolis to meet the Indiana Pacers, the only remaining unbeaten team in the league, on Friday.\n\nMilwaukee ends a stretch of four games in five days with a Saturday night home date against Kevin Durant and the Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\nIt all starts against the defending league champion Heat, smarting after a 111-110 loss to Boston at home Saturday night.\n\nDwyane Wade tried to miss a free throw attempt to let time run out as the Heat was holding a two-point lead, but he failed to hit the rim and Boston took advantage on Jeff Green's buzzer-beating three-pointer.\n\nThe Bucks have to worry about their own issues in addition to fretting about LeBron James and Wade.\n\nCoach Larry Drew is waiting for the return of several key players, including center Larry Sanders (sprained right thumb) and forward Ersan Ilyasova (sore right ankle). Both sat out the Bucks' 91-83 home loss to the Dallas Mavericks on Saturday.\n\nOne bit of good news was the return of point guard Brandon Knight, who played 15 minutes off the bench. It was Knight's first appearance since suffering a strained right hamstring in the season opener Oct. 30.\n\n\"It's a maturing process,\" Butler said. \"We got a couple guys back tonight (Saturday), so it's just getting comfortable with their roles and playing alongside one another and what's expected from them.\n\n\"We've got to find a way, though. We've got to continue to chip away at this thing and find a way until our guys get back healthy.\"\n\nVeteran point guard Luke Ridnour remains out with a back injury, and Drew revealed before Saturday's game that Ridnour recently received a second cortisone shot to relieve his pain.\n\nSo it's likely the education of rookie point guard Nate Wolters will continue on the trip. Wolters played 36 minutes in a starting role against Dallas and had five points and five assists."
