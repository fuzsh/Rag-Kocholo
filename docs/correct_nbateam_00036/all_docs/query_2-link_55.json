        "text": "Not sure if someone already posted this but if not here it is...Your thoughts?\n\nPosted: Fri. 04/22/05 12:12 PM\n\nFrom: Crastinator\n\nCity: Detroit, MI USA\n\nSubject: Wow - Delfino!\n\nComments: Snagged this from another forum but the translation is good, I read the orignal at http://www.ole.clarin.com/jsp/v3/pagina.jsp?pagId=962301\n\nHe was angry, very angry. Just a few minutes ago he heard the news that Larry Brown, his coach, had left him out of the playoff roster. Carlos Delfino couldn't hide his anger when he spoke to Ole. „They fu*ked with me”, was his first phrase, the same that he repeated many times in the next 20 minutes. „Officially, I don't know nothing, I heard through the media...Practise ended at three and nobody spoke with me. Not the coach, not the manager. I didn't expect it from Brown, who doesn't even salute me...But I did expect it from (Joe) Dumars, who supported me when I went to my country to have surgery for the second time (in his right knee). But that's how the game is played here, the person doesn't matter” the rookie forward started.\n\nQ:-What explanation do you found on Brown's decision?\n\nA:- That he wants to fool me. Now it is clear that he made the decision before. In this last two games I've played a lot and as a starter (31 minutes on Wednesday), Brown approached me, told me I did well, that I could play in three positions...And now he comes up with this. He chooses (Darvin) Ham, who wasn't playing since a long while, and has a knee problem. He wanted to return the favour.\n\nQ:- Why?\n\nA:- He didn't explain to me. It must be related with my insult the other day. He kept his grudge since then. He seemed to change in the last few days, but now I see it wasn't like that...\n\nQ:-How was that of the insult? Did you apologize?\n\nA:- The truth is...There was only one minute to go and the game was over. He ordered to Arroyo and me to get in. We step and I say to Arroyo „He remembered that we're here”. Then I get in, made a mistake (he says something like „I've **** it up” and he pulls me out angered. When I walk by him he calls me „as*hole” then I insult him in Spanish. I reacted, I'm a big mouthed ****, but I did because he insulted me first. It's the truth. That's why I didn't apologize to him, I just talked with Dumas and told him that I've made a mistake. But nothing else.\n\nQ:-The relationship with Brown was always that bad?\n\nA:- He never approached me, talked or was polite. I barely got a „hello”. The day I got injured for the first time, he shouted „run, run” at me, and I couldn't. The next day I had an artoscopy(I don't know how to translate that), I never knew what his mood was, I found out on the papers. Like when he said that I didn't play any defense. He didn't told me what I was doing right and what was wrong. He never said anything in my face. I haven't learned anything with him as coach. He can't deal with the psichological side of a player.\n\nQ:-Brown had problems with other Pistons players and with Iverson in the 76ers. His rants are normal. Do you really believe that it was because of that insult?\n\nA:- Yes, it is true, he had problems with others, but I'm not Iverson. He can't leave him (Iverson) outside the playoff rosters, but he can leave me out...I'm a rookie. But what happened is something normal in professionalism, it just happens everywhere.\n\nQ:-Maybe the fact that you got surgery in Argentina and he didn't want you to, could have had some influence?\n\nA:- I don't think so...(thinks)... All was authorized. Here they saw the good side, they knew I would feel better in my country...and so it was. I felt terrible since I came back (to Detroit).\n\nDelfino had two right knee surgeries that kept him on the injured list for three months. He only played 30 games with an average of 15.3 minutes. His regular season stats are 3.9 points, 36% Field goals percentage, 58% Free Throws, 1.8 Rebound and 1.3 assist. More was expected from him.\n\nQ:-Will you be critic of your performance?\n\nA:- Now they will say that I'm difficult, that I always have problems with the coaches, but I didn't do anything wrong. I had the worst year of my career. But the main reason was the injury. They told me that they were going to give me minutes and they didn't...Later, when I was healthy, my game was good. But I had the injury and playing so many games isn't easy. And getting into rhythm after such a long time. But I proved to myself that I can play in the NBA. Even standing in one leg like I'm at this moment. Besides, I was professional. I didn't play but still I trained the double. I don't see my mistake.\n\nQ:-How do you see your future?\n\nA:- For this guy (Brown) I don't play again. And I don't want to stay here (Detroit). I felt like ****, they treated me like garbage. I expected another gesture, even from Dummars. I wish they trade or waive me. Maybe I say this because I'm really upset, but from this place I have the worst memories of my career and I want to go home."
