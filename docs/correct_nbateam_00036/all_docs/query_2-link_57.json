        "text": "The Houston Rockets will be without Carlos Delfino for the remainder of the playoffs. Delfino has a fractured bone in his right foot, according to Rockets reporter Jason Friedman.\n\nDelfino averaged nine points per game through the playoffs for Houson while shooting 37 percent from the field and 35 percent from beyond the arc. The Rockets played Delfino 24 minutes per game through the playoffs and will likely rely on a heavier minute load from Chandler Parsons.\n\nGame 6 between the Rockets and Oklahoma City Thunder is set for 9:30 p.m. ET Friday. After going down 0-3 to the Thunder to start the series, the Rockets will look to tie the series at three wins each. The loss of Delfino leaves the Rockets shorthanded in defenders to send at Durant who is shooting over 50 percent from the field in the absence of Westbrook.\n\nThe Rockets have been keying in on Durant defensively and could struggle without another forward and six fouls to use against the Thunder's leading man.\n\nMore from SB Nation:\n\n• Stephen Curry's 10 best shots of the playoffs\n\n• Pay Nate Robinson (if you dare)\n\n• Controversial call helps close door on Denver\n\n• David Kahn has the final word\n\n• What's wrong with the Knicks?"
