        "text": "LAS VEGAS (FIBA Americas Championship) - Argentina guard Carlos Delfino believes the Olympic champions have a reputation to defend in the forthcoming FIBA Americas Championship.\n\nThe Toronto Raptors star told Clarin newspaper that Argentina, who make their tournament debut against Uruguay on Thursday, have to uphold their identity and history on court.\n\n\"We are the Argentina national team, we have a prestige to defend and we are in Las Vegas to clinch our big goal - to qualify to the Olympic Games,\" the 24-year-old said.\n\n\"The team is very well. The group is united and it helps a lot on and off the court.\n\n\"We still have things to improve and perhaps the biggest point against is that we have not trained all together for a long time. There were just three training weeks.\"\n\nArgentina are targeting one of the two places to qualify for next year's Beijing Olympics, and Delfino is adamant it is a realistic aim, even with Manu Ginobili, Pepe Sanchez, Fabricio Oberto, Andres Nocioni and Ruben Wolkowyski absent.\n\n\"We cannot play by heart as Ginobili, Sanchez, Oberto, Nocioni and Wolkowyski do, but we all have a message this extraordinary group learned - each player has a role and we don't depend on anybody.\n\n\"We can hurt in several ways and if we go on this way, we can succeed.\n\n\"All rivals will be difficult, but our dream to get the ticket to Beijing is intact.\"\n\nThe United States have announced the return of a Dream Team, with Kobe Bryant as the main star, seconded by LeBron James, Jason Kidd, Carmelo Anthony and Chauncey Billups.\n\nOf this, Delfino said: \"The biggest attraction will be the US team, with the most important Dream Team version in years.\n\n\"They have Kobe Bryant - the world's best player because of his presence, intensity and talent\n\n- LeBron James - the NBA's most powerful man in the perimeter - and Jason Kidd. They are not invincible, but they will be very difficult to beat.\n\n\"Their weakest points can be lack of teamwork, a lack of chemistry and lack of knowledge of their rivals, but we cannot underestimate them because they are the best physically, with talent throughout the team and they are hosts.\"\n\nDelfino believes Canada, Brazil and Puerto Rico - who Argentina have faced in recent friendlies - will also provide difficult tests.\n\n\"Brazil, Puerto Rico and Canada form a second group of hard-to-pass teams,\" he added.\n\n\"Brazil have a very important, complete squad in all positions and Leandrinho and Nene will bring crucial contributions.\n\n\"Puerto Rico run, throw a lot and they always keep the Caribbean way to play, while Canada will be different without Steve Nash but have a young, well-ordered team with clear ideas.\"\n\nMatias Greco\n\nFIBA"
