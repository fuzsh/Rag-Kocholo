Instead, this doesn't involve the Pistons at all. From the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel:\n\nSo long, Amir Johnson.\n\nThe power forward's days in Milwaukee were numbered - at 55, to be precise.\n\nIn a sign-and-trade deal worked out between the Milwaukee Bucks and Toronto Raptors, Johnson and guard Sonny Weems will head to Toronto, while Milwaukee will receive small forward Carlos Delfino and guard Roko Ukic, a team source confirmed Monday.\n\nThe 6-foot-6-inch Delfino is the key man in the trade for the Bucks, a player who can provide depth at small forward, still a major concern after the departure of veteran Richard Jefferson in a June 23 trade. That was the same deal that netted Johnson from the Detroit Pistons.\n\nBut the 6-9 Johnson became more expendable in the Bucks' thinking after they signed free agent Hakim Warrick to a one-year, $3 million deal earlier this month. Warrick will have a chance to gain a starting spot at power forward.\n\n*****\n\nHat-tip to, well, everyone in the comments already discussing this deal. It's an odd one for me to digest -- as long-time readers will recall, Delfino and Amir have successively taken turns serving as DBB mascots of sorts -- I've been a long-time believer in both and spent more pixels than I care to admit stumping for each to receive more playing time. Hopefully this trade works out for each of them.\n\nAs you may have noticed, things slowed down to a grinding halt this week -- I've been busy working on my sunburn and punishing my liver in Key West. Expect regularly-scheduled musings (including some related to current Pistons!) to resume shortly."
