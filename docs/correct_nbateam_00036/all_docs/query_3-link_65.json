        "text": "After the trade was leaked to Yahoo! Sports earlier in the day, the Clippers PR department announced the trade shortly after 2 PM Pacific time: Jared Dudley and a 2017 first for Carlos Delfino, Miroslav Raduljica, and a 2015 second rounder.\n\nDudley struggled in his only season as a Clipper, and due to a tight salary situation it made sense for the team to try and get his 2-year, 8.5 million dollar deal off of the books before re-signing DeAndre Jordan next summer.\n\nThe 2017 first round pick, while an asset, also had relatively little worth. The pick is expected to be low (the Clippers have chosen #25 and #28 the last two seasons) and a first round pick's contract is guaranteed, essentially making early second rounders more valuable than late firsts in some cases. That pick will most likely be the Reggie Bullock or C.J. Wilcox of 2017; in other words, not a huge loss.\n\nOn the incoming side, Carlos Delfino is a solid veteran small forward who has struggled with injuries. Contrary to the Yahoo! report, the general expectation seems to be that Delfino will play this season, and could be ready as soon as training camp. Delfino, when healthy, brings athleticism, shooting, and experience to the table. The 31 year old Argentinian wing is a solid shooter (36.5% career 3pt) and puts up good all-around stats (15 points, 5 rebounds, and 3 assists per 36 minutes in 2013). The main question mark is Delfino's health, but if he plays then he could end up being the Clippers' starting SF.\n\nMiroslav Raduljica is a large Serbian center who was a rookie for Milwaukee last season. He is 26 years old and averaged 3.8 points and 2.4 rebounds in just under 10 minutes a night (14/8.4 per36). His contract is guaranteed for this season, and unguaranteed in 2016. If the team keeps him through the last two years of his contract, he will be eligible for restricted free agency in the summer of 2016.\n\nWe'll have more for you in the next couple of days regarding the specific financial implications of this deal, as well as Delfino's health, Raduljica's outlook, and overall analysis."
