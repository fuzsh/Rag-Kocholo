        "text": "There have been a lot of fun nicknames throughout the years of Milwaukee Bucks players that have come and gone. However, my all-time personal favorite may be the one that was given to Carlos Delfino — Carlos Del-three-no.\n\nAn underrated aspect to the 2010 Fear the Deer team, Delfino always ignited the crowd with his 3-point display. His Bucks career started in 2009 when the Raptors signed and traded Delfino along with Roko Ukic in exchange for Amir Johnson and Sonny Weems. The following campaign for Delfino was the best of his career. As I mentioned, he was massive from 3-point land, as he secured a 40.5 percent from deep during the playoffs — anybody else remember his corner three in Game 5 on the road vs. Atlanta?\n\nIn August of 2012, Delfino signed with the Houston Rockets. He became a sixth man there. However, he was then waived by the team in 2013.\n\nThis would pave the way for Delfino’s second stint in Milwaukee, as he signed with the team in July of 2013. However, he wouldn’t even sniff the court, as a broken foot sidelined him. In August of 2014, Delfino was traded along with Miroslav Raduljica and a 2015 second-round pick to the Clippers in exchange for Jared Dudley and a 2017 conditional first-round pick. He was waived by Los Angeles three days later.\n\nThat would be Delfino’s last time in the NBA. From there, he went back home to his native country, where he signed with the Boca Juniors in March of 2017. Then in September the same year, he signed with the Spanish club Baskonia. That would ultimately prove to be a short timeline though, as he finished his time with the club just a month later.\n\nIn July of 2018, Delfino made his way back to Italy (where he had played 14 years prior) and signed with the Italian squad Auxilium Torino. In Feburary of 2019, Delfino then went to Bologna where he suited up for Lavoropiu Bologna.\n\nThere would then be a year-long hiatus for Delfino’s career — which makes sense, as he’s scratching 40 years-old. However, his 38 year-old status isn’t stopping him, as he signed with Victoria Libertas Pesaro, which is the team he currently resides on.\n\nA look at Delfino’s Twitter shows that he was still clearly paying attention to Milwaukee’s postseason run:\n\nLet’s hear your favorite Carlos Delfino memories in the thread below. In addition to that, if you have any additional suggestions for players you’d love to see featured in this series, comment them below!"
