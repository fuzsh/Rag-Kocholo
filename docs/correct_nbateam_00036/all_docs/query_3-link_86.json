        "text": "The NBA has granted the Milwaukee Bucks a Disabled Player Exception of $1.75 million for the loss of small forward Carlos Delfino, as reported by Adrian Wojnarowski of Yahoo! Sports. Under the current Collective Bargaining Agreement, a team can apply for such an exception after losing a player for the majority of the year.\n\nDelfino hasn't really come close to playing this year, suffering multiple setbacks during his attempt to recover from a broken bone in his foot suffered last May. This past summer, Delfino signed a two-year, $6.5 million dollar deal this summer (with the third year not guaranteed), and has seemingly gotten further and further away from playing for Milwaukee as the year has worn on.\n\nThe DPE can be used up until March 10th, and can only be used in a trade or to sign free agents. Don't expect it to be of much use given the Bucks already have 15 players on their roster (it's not like they need to sign someone off the street right now), though in principle the Bucks could find a way to take back another player in a trade with the extra roster spot.\n\nThe league also handed out DPEs to the Brooklyn Nets and Atlanta Hawks this season for season-ending injuries to their star big men Brook Lopez and Al Horford. Both of those are worth $5.25 million."
