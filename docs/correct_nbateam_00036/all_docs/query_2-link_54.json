        "text": "It's Part Deux of the Carlos Delfino Vs. Linas Kleiza Deadliest Warrior saga. This time around we're covering Kleiza, and it's going to be in French...\n\nJust kidding.\n\nLet's get started, shall we?\n\nIt's a battle of the combo guard-forward vs. combo forward-forward, SG/SF vs. SF/PF, Kleiza vs. Delfino. Who will come out victorious?\n\nLinas Kleiza's season stats are as follows:\n\n2005-06 season: team: Denver Nuggets, 3.5 PPG, .2 BPG, .2 SPG, 1.9 RPG, .2 APG played 61 games out of 82 and averaged 8.5 minutes a game.\n\n2006-07 season: team: Denver Nuggets, 7.6 PPG, .2 BPG, .4 SPG, 3.4 RPG, .6 APG played 79 out of 82 games and averaged 18.8 minutes a game.\n\n2007-08 season: team: Denver Nuggets, 11.1 PPG, .2 BPG, .6 SPG, 4.2 RPG, 1.2 APG played 79 out of 82 games and averaged 23.9 minutes a game.\n\n2008-09 season: team: Denver Nuggets, 9.9 PPG, .2 BPG, .4 SPG, 4 RPG, .8 APG played 82 out of 82 games and averaged 22.2 minutes a game.\n\nPer 36 minutes it looks a little something like this:\n\n2005-06 season: 14.8 PPG, .9 BPG, .7 SPG, 8 RPG, 1 APG\n\n2006-07 season: 14.5 PPG, .3 BPG, .7 SPG, 6.4 RPG, 1.1 APG\n\n2007-08 season: 16.8 PPG, .4 BPG, .8 SPG, 6.3 RPG, 1.8 APG\n\n2008-09 season: 16 PPG, .3 BPG, .6 SPG, 6.5 RPG, 1.3 APG\n\nDuring the playoffs it looks like this:\n\n2005-06 POs: 2 PPG, 1.3 RPG, .7 APG; played three games and averaged 3.6 minutes.\n\n2006-07 POs: 1.6 PPG, 1.6 RPG, .4 APG; played five games and averaged 13.2 minutes.\n\n2007-08 POs: 14 PPG, 6.5 RPG, .8 APG; played four games and averaged 30.5 minutes.\n\n2008-09 POs: 6.9 PPG, 3.2 RPG, .5 APG; played 14 games and averaged 15 minutes.\n\nHis career averages are the following:\n\nPer game: 8.3 PPG, .2 BPG, .4 SPG, 3.5 RPG, .7 APG\n\nPer 36 minutes: 15.8 PPG, .4 BPG, .7 SPG, 6.6 RPG, 1.4 APG\n\nPlayoffs: 6.4 PPG, 3.2 RPG, .5 APG\n\nNow for the YouTube clips:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaoVpqYcaJo\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIgVD11HZZU&NR=1\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s628k7pKk34&feature=fvw\n\nSTRENGTHS\n\nHe has good size and strength for a wing, much like his teammate Carmelo Anthony, and he fits well with the Nuggets' system, which is the same as the Raptors' run n' gun. He has really good range and uses his size to his advantage on both defence and offence.\n\nWEAKNESSES\n\nHe still has a long way to go if he wants to be relied on for 30-plus minutes a game. He lacks the speed to keep up or get past other wingers, and he really doesn't help at times with weak defense.\n\nBefore you guys make your decision, take into account that Delfino will be 27 and Kleiza 25 this year. Delfino is a better defender, and I think they're just about the same as far as rebounds. But as of now, Kleiza is the one who is more efficient with his range and has more power, and they're both very intense players."
