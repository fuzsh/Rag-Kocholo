        "text": "THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nHOUSTON — A person with knowledge of the deal says the Houston Rockets have agreed to a one-year deal with Argentine forward Carlos Delfino.\n\nThe person spoke on condition of anonymity because the deal had not been officially announced.\n\nThe 6-foot-6 Delfino played in the Olympics, where he helped Argentina finish fourth. Delfino averaged 15.3 points in London, where he was a teammate with former Rocket Luis Scola. Delfino also played on Argentina’s gold-medal winning team in Athens in 2004 and the bronze-medal team in Beijing 2008.\n\nA first-round pick by Detroit in 2003, Delfino has played his past three seasons with Milwaukee. He averaged 11.5 points, 4.1 rebounds and 32.5 minutes in 2010-11, his most productive NBA season.\n\nThe Houston Chronicle and KRIV-TV first reported the deal."
