        "text": "By of the\n\nCarlos Delfino is coming back to the Bucks.\n\nDelfino and the Bucks agreed Sunday night on a two-year, $6.5 million contract with a third non-guaranteed year that could bring the total to $9.75 million, according to a league source.\n\nThe Houston Rockets released the 6-foot-6 Delfino last week as part of their salary-shedding moves to clear the way for an agreement with center Dwight Howard, who chose to sign with the Rockets on Friday.\n\nDelfino played for Milwaukee for three seasons from 2009 to 2012 and appeared in 178 games, starting 159. He was a reliable performer under former Bucks coach Scott Skiles, who used him at both the small forward and shooting guard positions.\n\nDelfino has guarded some of the elite wing players in the league, including Carmelo Anthony, Kobe Bryant and LeBron James.\n\nDuring the past season Delfino defended Oklahoma City star Kevin Durant in an opening-round playoff series but suffered a fractured bone in his right foot in Game 5 against the Thunder.\n\nHe had to sit out Game 6 as the Thunder beat the Rockets in six games.\n\nDelfino had surgery after the season ended to have a bone spur removed from his foot.\n\nHe provides depth at small forward along with Luc Richard Mbah a Moute and the Bucks' first-round draft pick, 6-9 Giannis Antetokounmpo. Delfino also can play at shooting guard to support O.J. Mayo, another free-agent signing by the Bucks.\n\nMilwaukee has picked up three key players in free agency in the last three days, with Mayo agreeing to a three-year, $24 million deal on Friday and veteran center Zaza Pachulia agreeing to a three-year, $15 million contract Saturday.\n\nContracts can be signed Wednesday when the league's moratorium period ends.\n\nDelfino, 30, is the son of a basketball coach and a key member of Argentina's \"Golden Generation,\" a group that includes Manu Ginobili, Andres Nocioni, Pablo Prigioni and Luis Scola.\n\nDelfino helped his country win a basketball gold medal in the 2004 Athens Olympics and a bronze medal in the 2008 Beijing Olympics.\n\nDelfino shot 36.6% from three-point range with the Bucks. He averaged 11.0 points in his first season in Milwaukee and 11.5 the following year, although he was limited to 49 games the second season due to effects of a concussion that sidelined him for several months.\n\nHe averaged 9.0 points while playing 54 games during the 2011-'12 lockout-shortened season.\n\nLast season in Houston he performed well, averaging 10.6 points while shooting 37.5% from three-point range and 87.5% at the free throw line.\n\nDelfino was a popular player with the Bucks and received a warm welcome when he returned to the BMO Harris Bradley Center on Jan. 4 last season. He sank 8 of 11 shots and 6 of 7 three-pointers and scored 22 points that night in the Rockets' 115-101 victory.\n\nDelfino was selected 25th overall by the Detroit Pistons in the 2003 draft and played three seasons in Detroit and one in Toronto before joining the Bucks in 2009. He was acquired by the Bucks in a trade that sent Amir Johnson and Sonny Weems to the Raptors.\n\nCARLOS DELFINO'S CAREER STATISTICS"
