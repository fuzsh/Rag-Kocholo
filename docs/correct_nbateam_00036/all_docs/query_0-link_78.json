        "text": "BUENOS AIRES (FIBA Basketball World Cup) - Carlos Delfino has endured a run of bad luck for the past year yet he remains hopeful that good times are ahead.\n\nAfter having an operation on his right foot that he injured while playing for the Houston Rockets in the 2013 NBA playoffs, Delfino signed a free-agent contract with one of his former teams, the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nBut in December, Delfino was advised to have another operation on his foot and that led to his missing the entire NBA campaign.\n\nThe second surgery was performed by Donato Villani, the doctor of Argentina's football team, and now Delfino is targeting a return to playing basketball games.\n\nWhat is not clear is his availability for Argentina's national team this summer at the FIBA Basketball World Cup.\n\nA lynchpin in the team since the 2004 Olympics, when he helped Argentina capture a gold medal, Delfino would be a nice weapon for national team coach Julio Lamas to throw at Senegal, the Philippines, Greece, Puerto Rico and Croatia in the Group Phase at the World Cup.\n\nAt this point, he is nothing more than an uncertainty for Argentina.\n\nThe tournament tips off 30 August for Argentina in Seville.\n\nDelfino wants to make something very clear to the fans in Argentina, and in the NBA.\n\n\"I want to play [at the World Cup],\" the 31-year-old said.\n\n\"It's important to make that clear: 'Does Delfino want to play at the World Cup? Yes, he wants to play.'\n\n\"Of course I want to. But it doesn't just depend on me.\"\n\nThe main issues for Delfino's concern is the rehabilitation of his foot, and the wishes of the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nThere have been many instances at past FIBA World Championships and Olympics where players have used international basketball as a launch pad for terrific campaigns in the NBA.\n\n\"I've thought about it,\" he said to Ole.com.ar.\n\n\"I will not lie.\n\n\"Maybe Milwaukee will see it as beneficial for me to get up to speed and so I can arrive at the start of training camp with a little basketball.\n\n\"(Laughs) Hopefully the new owners see it the same way.\"\n\nHerb Kohl has agreed to sell the Bucks to New York-based Wesley Edens and Marc Lasry.\n\nThe sale is pending approval by the NBA and its Board of Governors."
