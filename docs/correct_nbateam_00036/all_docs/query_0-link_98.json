        "text": "AUBURN HILLS, Mich. - James Harden agreed to a big new contract extension - and he certainly looked worth it in his first game with the Houston Rockets.\n\nHarden had 37 points and 12 assists in a stirring debut for his new team, and Carlos Delfino made four 3-pointers in the fourth quarter to lift the Rockets to a 105-96 victory over the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday night.\n\nDetroit led 83-72 early in the fourth, but Harden and Delfino brought the Rockets back. Houston acquired Harden on Saturday night in a trade with Oklahoma City and agreed Wednesday on a five-year, $80 million contract extension with him.\n\n\"I think I just wanted to get out there and play,\" Harden said. \"All the talking and all the craziness that has been happening this last week - I just wanted to go out there and play basketball.\"\n\nThe reigning Sixth Man of the Year fell just short of his career high of 40 points, and his 12 assists were a career best. Not bad for a guy still adjusting to new teammates and a new situation.\n\nHarden started only seven games in three seasons in Oklahoma City, as he developed into an indispensable reserve. But he was in the starting lineup Wednesday and looked ready to play a bigger role with Houston.\n\n\"I just tried to score and create opportunities,\" Harden said. \"Carlos Delfino came in hot. I just tried to get my bigs involved. A lot of different guys stepped up, and I think that's how it's going to be throughout this entire season.\"\n\nJeremy Lin, Houston's other big acquisition, had 12 points and eight assists. The Rockets won without Patrick Patterson, who was out with a left quad strain.\n\nBrandon Knight led Detroit with 15 points.\n\nWith Houston down 11 points, Harden started the comeback with a 3-pointer, and Greg Smith followed with a dunk. Detroit led only 85-83 after consecutive 3-pointers by Delfino, then a layup by Chandler Parsons tied it.\n\nSmith dunked to put the Rockets ahead 89-87, and he dunked again to make it a four-point game before hobbling off with what he later said was a minor left foot injury. By then, Houston was already taking control of the game behind its two new playmakers, Harden and Lin.\n\n¦ Spurs 99, Hornets 95\n\nNEW ORLEANS - Tim Duncan scored 24 points, Tony Parker hit a huge 3-pointer, and the Spurs opened the season with a victory over the Hornets in the debut for top draft pick Anthony Davis.\n\nDavis scored 21 points and grabbed seven rebounds, a promising start for the player who spent only one year at Kentucky, leading the Wildcats to the national title.\n\nBut the wily Spurs showed the rebuilding Hornets a thing or two.\n\nAfter Davis made two free throws with 1:08 remaining to give New Orleans its final lead, 95-94, the Spurs closed strong. Parker connected from beyond the arc with 49.6 seconds left, finishing with 23 points. After Greivis Vasquez missed an open 3, Duncan padded the lead with two fouls shots.\n\n¦ Pacers 90, Raptors 88\n\nTORONTO - George Hill scored the go-ahead basket with two seconds left, completing the Pacers' rally for a season-opening win over the Raptors.\n\nDavid West scored 14 of his 25 points in the fourth quarter, and Paul George had 14 points and 15 rebounds for the Pacers, who trailed 84-74 with just under six minutes left. Roy Hibbert added 14 points for Indiana.\n\n¦ Bulls 93, Kings 87\n\nCHICAGO - Joakim Noah scored 23 points and grabbed 10 rebounds, and the Bulls got off to a good start without Derrick Rose, beating the Kings in the season opener.\n\nRichard Hamilton added 19 points, while Carlos Boozer chipped in with 18 points and eight rebounds.\n\n¦ 76ers 84, Nuggets 75\n\nPHILADELPHIA - Spencer Hawes had 16 points and 12 rebounds to lead the 76ers to a win over the Nuggets.\n\nHawes had a crowd of nearly 20,000 fans chanting \"Spen-cer Hawes!\" in the fourth quarter after he turned back the Nuggets with a string of big baskets and blocked shots. Coming off the bench, Hawes had five blocked shots. Jrue Holiday had 14 and 11 assists, and Dorell Wright scored 14 points.\n\n¦ Jazz 113, Mavs 94\n\nSALT LAKE CITY - Mo Williams and Marvin Williams each scored 21 points to lead the Jazz to a 113-94 victory Wednesday night over the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nPaul Millsap added 15 rebounds and 13 points. Al Jefferson also had a double-double with 14 rebounds and 12 points.\n\nThe score was tied at 70 before Mo Williams hit back-to-back 3-pointers then scored on a driving layup. Marvin Williams followed with his second 3-pointer, putting Utah up 11 points with 2:57 left in the third. The Jazz led by as many as 20.\n\nDarren Collison scored 17 points for the Mavs, who pulled off an upset win over the Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday but couldn't match Utah's pace in the second half.\n\nThe Jazz held a 44-30 advantage on points in the paint and 61-40 edge in rebounds as Dallas continued to play without 11-time All-Star forward Dirk Nowitzki and 7-0 center Chris Kaman.\n\nMuch was made about how Utah had added 3-point shooters in the offseason, but the Jazz started just 1 of 7 from beyond the arc until Mo Williams starting hitting.\n\nOverall, Utah's three new players - Mo Williams, Marvin Williams and backup shooting guard Randy Foye - combined for 55 points and all six of Utah's 3-pointers as the Jazz finished 6 of 14 from beyond the arc.\n\nBrandan Wright added 15 points on 7-of-8 shooting for the Mavs (1-1), while O.J. Mayo and Vince Carter had 12 points apiece.\n\nThe Mavs had pulled off the road win over the Lakers, but coach Rick Carlisle knew Wednesday would be just as much of a battle, calling Utah a \"wrecking crew\" in the paint with its four bigs.\n\nHe was right, even if Enes Kanter sat out most of the first half after needing three stitches to close a gash in his chin.\n\nKanter returned in the third quarter and finished with six points and seven rebounds in 14 minutes.\n\nThe Mavs started off hot despite not arriving in Salt Lake City until about 3 a.m., hitting their first five shots in building a 15-8 lead.\n\nUtah pulled even at 18 with 3:51 left in the quarter on Marvin Williams' fast-break layup. He had 10 first-quarter points, including his first 3-pointer as a member of the Jazz.\n\nStill, the Mavs would lead 26-25 after one despite being outrebounded 16-8, and outscored 14-8 in the paint.\n\nThe Jazz surged ahead 42-35 in the second quarter as Mo Williams settled in, hitting four shots and two free throws in a 4-minute span.\n\nBut the Mavs fought back with six 3-pointers, three by Mayo, two by Jae Crowder and one by Collison that started a 24-8 run and gave Dallas a 63-55 edge at the break.\n\nThe Mavs shot 59 percent in the second quarter, hitting 13 of 22 overall and 7 of 8 from beyond the arc.\n\nUnlike Tuesday night when the Lakers made 12 of 31 at the free throw line, the Jazz cashed in there, making 31 of 42 overall.\n\nThe Jazz also held a 27-12 advantage on the fast-break as Mo Williams, acquired in an offseason trade, used every opportunity to push the ball.\n\nHe finished with six assists and two blocked shots."
