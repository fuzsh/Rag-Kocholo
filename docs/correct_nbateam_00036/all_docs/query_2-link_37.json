        "text": "By of the\n\nA brighter day has arrived for Milwaukee Bucks forward Carlos Delfino.\n\nLast summer he was trying to escape a bad situation in Russia after the professional team he signed a multiyear deal with - Khimki Moscow - hit financial hard times and was unable to meet its salary commitments.\n\nThis summer, the 6-foot-6 forward is coming off a surprising season after starting 66 games for the Bucks and helping them reach the NBA playoffs.\n\nBucks general manager John Hammond recently said he expects the Bucks to pick up the second year on Delfino's contract, which will pay the Argentine player $3.5 million next season. But the Bucks have until June 28 to make a decision. If they do not pick up the contract, they will owe Delfino $500,000 for next season.\n\n\"I was thinking on 12 months ago, my situation, and I can tell you I'm pretty happy about how the season went,\" Delfino said. \"If you start to analyze everything, we took a full team to a seven-game series, missing key pieces. You've got to be optimistic about it.\"\n\nDelfino referred to the Bucks' first-round playoff battle with Atlanta, won by the Hawks in seven games. But at one point the Bucks held a 3-2 lead in the series and had a chance to win it, despite missing 7-foot center Andrew Bogut due to a season-ending injury he suffered in early April.\n\nIt was a roller-coaster playoff ride for Delfino, who struggled to defend Atlanta's 6-9 Josh Smith in the first two games but did much better when matched up against Hawks guard Joe Johnson or small forward Marvin Williams.\n\nAnd Delfino was able to make some huge contributions in the series, including a 22-point effort in Game 4 (6-of-8 shooting from three-point range), a clutch corner three in the Bucks' 91-87 road victory in Game 5 and a 20-point night in Milwaukee's home loss in Game 6.\n\n\"I realized I struggled with the matchups,\" Delfino said. \"I think I missed Bogues a lot; I may be the one missing him the most because he was working a lot for us, getting us the shots from the corner and the weak side, by his presence in the paint.\n\n\"With all those switches, we didn't have as much space to shoot or as much time to shoot. Sometimes I was having a little space, sometimes not. Depending on how they played us, I was having different kind of games.\"\n\nDelfino admitted to being tired in Game 7, when he was 1 for 8 from the field and scored three points as the Hawks won easily at home, 95-74.\n\n\"I think we suffered and arrived just tired, but it was still a good series,\" Delfino said.\n\nNow the 27-year-old is looking forward to playing for Argentina in the World Championships in late August and early September. He was a member of his country's gold-medal winning team in the 2004 Athens Olympics and the bronze-medal team in the 2008 Beijing Games.\n\nHe could be asked to play a larger role because of the absence of San Antonio Spurs guard Manu Ginobili, who will not play for Argentina this summer but expects to return for the 2012 London Olympics.\n\n\"We will miss Manu; he is a key piece,\" Delfino said. \"But we will have all the rest of the guys - (Luis) Scola, (Andres) Nocioni, (Fabricio) Oberto. Of course I'm proud about going to represent my country.\n\n\"Manu does a lot for us on the national team. But we have a great team, a great chemistry, and I think we still have good chances.\"\n\nArgentina holds the top spot in the FIBA world rankings, ahead of the defending Olympic champion U.S. team. The 2010 World Championships will be played in Turkey, and Bucks forward Ersan Ilyasova will play for the host team.\n\nDelfino hopes it will be a big summer for Argentina on the world stage, and not just in basketball. He will be paying close attention in June when Lionel Messi leads Argentina's talent-laden soccer team in the World Cup in South Africa.\n\n\"Hopefully (Argentina will win),\" Delfino said. \"We need that for all the country. I am a soccer fan. When soccer is good in Argentina, all the country is OK, everybody is happy. It would be good for us.\"\n\nWhen the Bucks reconvene in the fall, the team is sure to have a different look. But it also will have an established core group, something it has lacked entering the last few seasons.\n\nFour of the five Bucks starters are under contract for next season - Bogut, point guard Brandon Jennings, Delfino and power forward Luc Richard Mbah a Moute. And the Bucks have made a contract extension offer to the fifth starter, guard John Salmons, who can opt out of the final year of his deal to become a free agent.\n\n\"You don't know how everything will develop during the summer, but you have pieces to build on,\" Delfino said. \"Brandon had a great year as a rookie and in my mind he was the rookie of the year.\n\n\"To think about his development and with Andrew coming back, everyone should be optimistic about the future and to grow into a great organization.\"\n\nBogut to miss Worlds: Bogut announced Monday he would not play in the World Championships, a move that had been expected since mid-March.\n\nHammond said in March that the team had serious concerns about Bogut's participation, and that was before the 7-footer suffered season-ending injuries to his right wrist and right index finger in a game against Phoenix on April 3.\n\n\"This has been a tough decision, but given the nature of the injury I sustained a few weeks back, I knew at that point that playing at the World Championships in 2010 would be doubtful,\" Bogut said in a statement released by Basketball Australia.\n\n\"I am certainly keen to contribute in any way possible to the team's preparations and look forward to working with the team as we prepare for the 2012 London Olympics.\n\nBogut will be entering the second year of a five-year contract extension in the fall and will earn more than $11 million next season.\n\nThe Bucks want to protect that investment and also to make sure Bogut can make a full recovery from his late-season injury.\n\nHe is scheduled to return to Milwaukee at the end of the month to have the cast removed from his right hand. Bogut then plans to return to Australia to begin the rehabilitation process."
