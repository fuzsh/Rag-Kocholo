        "text": "The Houston Rockets opened their season with a stirring 105-96 victory over the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday, thanks to James Harden's 37 points and 12 assists.\n\nDetroit led 83-72 early in the fourth before Carlos Delfino four three-pointers and Harden shifted the momentum to Houston. Houston acquired Harden on Saturday in a trade with Oklahoma City and agreed Wednesday on a five-year, $80 million contract extension with him. Brandon Knight led Detroit with 15 points.\n\nGeorge Hill scored the go-ahead basket with two seconds left to complete the Indiana Pacers' rally for a season-opening 90-88 win over the Toronto Raptors. David West scored 14 of his 25 points in the fourth quarter, and Paul George had 14 points and 15 rebounds for the Pacers, who trailed 84-74 with just under six minutes left. Roy Hibbert added 14 points for Indiana.\n\nKyle Lowry led Toronto with 21 points, and Jonas Valanciunas had 12 points and 10 rebounds in his NBA debut. Andrea Bargnani had 16 points, and Jose Calderon added 15 for the Raptors.\n\nThe Los Angeles Clippers picked up where they left off in their budding rivalry with the Memphis Grizzlies, claiming a 101-92 home triumph. Facing a Grizzlies side they edged out over seven games in the Western Conference first-round playoffs last season, the Clippers prevailed in a scrappy and sometimes ill-tempered contest courtesy of a strong fourth quarter.\n\nOff-season acquisition Jamal Crawford then brought the victory home in the last three minutes with a laser-like three-pointer and a driving layup that put the Clippers 98-90 ahead. Crawford wasted little time endearing himself with the home fans on his Clippers debut by recording a game-high 29 points, including 12 in the pivotal fourth.\n\nSan Antonio Spurs' Tim Duncan scored 24 points and Tony Parker hit a huge three-pointer as they opened the season with a 99-95 victory over the New Orleans Hornets in the debut for top draft pick Anthony Davis. Davis scored 21 points and grabbed seven rebounds.\n\nIn other games, Joakim Noah scored 23 points and grabbed 10 rebounds in the Chicago Bulls' 93-87 win over Sacramento Kings. Richard Hamilton added 19 points, while Carlos Boozer chipped in with 18 points and eight rebounds.\n\nSpencer Hawes had 16 points and 12 rebounds to lead the Philadelphia 76ers to an 84-75 win over the Denver Nuggets, while Mo Williams and Marvin Williams each scored 21 points to lead the Utah Jazz to a 113-94 victory over the Dallas Mavericks."
