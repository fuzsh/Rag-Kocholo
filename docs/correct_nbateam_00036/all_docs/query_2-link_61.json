        "text": "According to La Nacion, Argentina’s leading daily newspaper, it looks like Carlos Delfino, former NBA player and Gold Medal Olympian, might be returning to North America.\n\nDelfino’s agent in Argentina, Carlos Cerisola told La Nacion that Delfino has already arranged a buy-out from Khimki for $500,000, but is waiting for offers greater than what hs is currently making in Europe. The teams that have shown interest include his former team, the Toronto Raptors as well as the New York Knicks.\n\nDelfino surprised many NBA analysts when he opted to sign with Khimki of the Russian Super League, a move earning him rouhghly $3.62 million each of three years. It has long been assumed that Delfino would return to the NBA, where many teams could use his creative style off the bench.\n\nDelfino’s best statistical NBA season came in 07-08, his first year with Toronto, when he averaged 9 points, 4.4 rebounds, and 2 assists in about 20 minutes per game. Delfino also played in Argentina with Venado Tuerto and Santa Fe, as well as in Italy with Skipper Bologna and Reggio Calabria. He averaged 3 points in 9 minutes per game during Argentina’s Gold Medal run in Athens."
