        "text": "The Milwaukee Bucks are bringing back free agent Carlos Delfino. The cost is going to be $6.5 million over two seasons for the 30 year old. Per the Journal Sentinel: “Delfino and the Bucks agreed Sunday night on a two-year, $6.5 million contract with a third non-guaranteed year that could bring the total to $9.75 million, according to a league source. The Houston Rockets released the 6-foot-6 Delfino last week as part of their salary-shedding moves to clear the way for an agreement with center Dwight Howard, who chose to sign with the Rockets on Friday. Delfino played for Milwaukee for three seasons from 2009 to 2012 and appeared in 178 games, starting 159. He was a reliable performer under former Bucks coach Scott Skiles, who used him at both the small forward and shooting guard positions. […] Delfino had surgery after the season ended to have a bone spur removed from his foot. He provides depth at small forward along with Luc Richard Mbah a Moute and the Bucks’ first-round draft pick, 6-9 Giannis Antetokounmpo. Delfino also can play at shooting guard to support O.J. Mayo, another free-agent signing by the Bucks. Milwaukee has picked up three key players in free agency in the last three days, with Mayo agreeing to a three-year, $24 million deal on Friday and veteran center Zaza Pachulia agreeing to a three-year, $15 million contract Saturday. Contracts can be signed Wednesday when the league’s moratorium period ends.”"
