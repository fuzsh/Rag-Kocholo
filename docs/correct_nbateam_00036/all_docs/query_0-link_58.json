        "text": "HOUSTON — Houston Rockets reserve Carlos Delfino is out for the rest of the playoffs because of a bone fracture in his right foot that will require surgery.\n\nDelfino missed the second half of Game 5 against Oklahoma City because of a sore right foot. A CT scan performed Thursday revealed the fracture, and Delfino will have surgery in the off-season.\n\nDelfino has averaged nine points, 2.4 rebounds and two assists in the playoffs this year. Rockets general manager Daryl Morey says Delfino will be ready for the start of next season.\n\nHouston trailed 3-2 entering Game 6 Friday night in the best-of-seven series."
