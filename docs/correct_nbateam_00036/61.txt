Carlos Delfino, one of the few impact players still available in free agency, is reportedly off to Houston.

Jonathan Feigen of the Houston Chronicle was the first to report that Delfino and the Rockets agreed on a two-year deal, the second year a team option.

Delfino, who will be 30 when the season starts, has played for three teams over a seven-year NBA career. He played with the Bucks last season, starting in 53 of the 54 games he appeared in. Delfino averaged nine points in 28.5 minutes per game, both his lowest marks since the 2007-08 season.

Delfino does offer a consistent option from three. He is a career 36.2 percent shooter from beyond the arc, and has shot 36 percent or better from deep each of his last four seasons.

The 6-6, 230 lb. shooting guard played for Argentina in the 2012 Olympics. He averaged 15.4 points in eight games, scoring 13 and 15 points in two games against the United States.

Argentina finished fourth in the tournament, losing to Russia in the bronze medal game.

Delfino could fill a hole left by the departure of Chase Budinger. The Rockets dealt Budinger to the Timberwolves in the offseason after the three-year veteran averaged 9.6 points and shot 40.2 percent from three during the 2011-12 season.
