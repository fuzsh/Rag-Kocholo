HOUSTON — The Houston Rockets have waived guard/forward Carlos Delfino and point guard Aaron Brooks.

Delfino averaged 10.6 points and 3.3 rebounds in 67 games last season. It was his first year with the Rockets after spending three seasons in Milwaukee.

Brooks played in just seven games for Houston last season when the Rockets signed him after he was released by Sacramento. It was his second stint with the team after playing for Houston from 2007-2011.

Rockets general manager Daryl Morey took to Twitter to address the moves on Sunday.

“Thank you to (at)cabezadelfino (Delfino) & (at)Thirty2zero (Brooks), you both have been great Rockets, players & teammates. Hope there is a chance to reunite,” he tweeted.
