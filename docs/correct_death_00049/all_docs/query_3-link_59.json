        "text": "RICHARDSON, Texas (Jan. 25, 2005) — The University of Texas at Dallas (UTD) will present ‘Tis Pity She’s a Whore, a play by John Ford and directed by Raphael Parry, artistic director for the Shakespeare Festival of Dallas, Feb. 11-13 and Feb. 18-20 in the University Theatre on campus. Friday and Saturday performances will start at 8 p.m., Sunday performances at 2:30 p.m.\n\n‘Tis Pity She’s a Whore is perhaps the most popular and frequently performed play by Ford, whom many scholars consider the last major dramatist of the English Renaissance. The play is the tale of an incestuous love between Giovanni and his sister, Annabella, that ends in disaster and death. Set in 17th century Italy, the story takes place amidst a whirlwind of lust, vengeance and greed. Ford’s critique of contemporary culture, morality and interest in aberrant psychology figures prominently in ‘Tis Pity. Characters with powerful emotions, strong intellects and unbridled appetites populate Ford’s withering indictment of a world in which he says most men treat women as whores.\n\nAs an actor and director, Parry has worked in the Dallas theatrical community for more than 20 years. He is co-founder and former artistic director of Undermain Theatre and has performed with many theatres in the area including the Dallas Theater Center, Kitchen Dog, and the Pocket Sandwich Theatre. He is in his fourth season as artistic director for the Shakespeare Festival of Dallas.\n\nTickets for the show are $15 for general admission and free to UTD students with a valid identification.
