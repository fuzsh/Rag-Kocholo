        "text": "Cheshire - It is with heavy hearts that we announce the passing of Elizabeth “Bette” Marinaro, 91, into eternal rest on Thursday, August 24th surrounded by her loved ones during her last few days. She was predeceased by her beloved husband Robert Marinaro whom she was married to for 59 years.\n\nBorn in Waterbury, she was the daughter of the late Catherine (Ostrom) and Anthony Font and sister of the late Robert Font. A graduate of the 1950 class of Crosby High School, she married and later moved to Cheshire where she has resided ever since. She was an incredible Mom raising five children and cherishing her grandchildren who adored her. Bette had a special connection to everyone blessed to know her and was an inspiration in so many ways. Whether it be multi-tasking for her family’s activities or handling medical issues in life with courage and faith, she taught us to never give up.\n\nSunday family pasta dinners with “Mom’s sauce” was a must and her Christmas Eve and Christmas Day were filled with special traditions that will last generations, making holidays special for family and friends. She made everyone around her feel so loved and so special. She loved summers in Charlestown Beach, her many years with her husband in Palm Desert and her last few years in Westerly.\n\nBette also helped out at the family supermarket, Cheshire IGA, handling the payroll and helping at many community events over the years. She was a proud member of Beta Sigma Phi since 1965 and was an avid book reader, gardener and loved feeding her birds. Everyone knew she could have been a Jeopardy champion -- Crosswords, Scrabble and Cryptograms were child’s play for her.\n\nBette will forever be in the hearts of her five children: Robert (Katie) of Watertown, Rick of Wallingford, Randy of Bristol, Roy (Tiffani) of Port Richmond, CA and daughter Leslie of Cheshire. She was also blessed with grandchildren who fulfilled her life and with whom she had special relationships: Eric (Hilary), Rob (Nicole), Tommy, Jamie, Jason, Evan, Nikki, Peter, David and Alexa. The newest addition to the family, Finley, brought a smile to her face these last 3 years. She is also survived by many loving cousins and lifelong and cherished friends.\n\nThe family would like to thank Dr. Sarfeh, Davita Dialysis - Mattatuck Heights and her friend and caregiver Mary Clarke for such wonderful care over the years.\n\nArrangements – Calling hours will be held on Tuesday 8/29 from 4:00-7:00 pm at the Alderson-Ford Funeral Home of Cheshire, 615 S. Main St. On Wednesday 8/30, the funeral procession will depart the funeral home at 9:30 am and proceed to St. Bridget of Sweden Parish - St. Bridget Church, 175 Main St., for a Mass of Christian Burial at 10 am. Burial will follow in St. Bridget Cemetery. Donations in Elizabeth’s name can be made to the Cheshire Community Food Pantry, or a charity of your choice, in her memory.\n\nFind out if pre-planning is right for you."
