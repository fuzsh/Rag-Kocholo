        "text": "USModernist Hugh Kaptur\n\nHUGH MICHAEL KAPTUR (1931-)\n\nKaptur was born in Detroit MI where his father was a designer in the Packard and General Motors studios. He studied architecture at the Lawrence Institute of Technology. He joined the Marines and while stationed at Camp Pendleton, he met his first wife and designed a real estate office for her family in San Clemente, his first built project.\n\nIn 1954, Kaptur returned to Detroit where he worked with his Dad in GM's styling division. He moved to Palm Springs in 1956 and apprenticed with Donald Wexler and Harrison.
