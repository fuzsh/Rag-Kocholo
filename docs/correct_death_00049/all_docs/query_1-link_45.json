They will also have the chance to familiarize themselves with the campuses.\n\nThe fall semester may seem still a long time away, but it will be here before you know it. There are four New Student Orientation options to take advantage of at UAHT. Make plans to attend one of these Orientation sessions.\n\nHope Campus New Student Orientation Options\n\nEvening Morning\n\nMonday, August 12 from 5:30 PM to 8:30 PM. & Tuesday, August 13 from 9 AM to 12 PM.\n\nTexarkana Campus New Student Orientation Options:\n\nEvening Morning\n\nWednesday, August 14 • 5:30 – 8:30 p.m. & Thursday, August 15 • 9:00 a.m. – 12:00 p.m.\n\nIf you are a new student to UAHT this fall it is encouraged to participate at one of the New Student Orientations.
