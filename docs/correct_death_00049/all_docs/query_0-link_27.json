Ford.\n\nJohn Ford was a 20th century Human actor, writer, producer, and director from Earth, best remembered for his western films.\n\nIn 2153, Trip Tucker claimed to have seen every John Ford film when T'Pol asked him if he'd ever ridden a horse before. (ENT: \"North Star\")\n\nIn the final draft script of \"North Star\", Tucker said he'd \"seen every Roy Rogers movie\", instead of referencing John Ford.\n\nIn 2375, Nog watched Ford's 1956 film The Searchers when he was living in Vic Fontaine's apartment in the Bashir 62 holosuite program. Like Vic, he preferred The Searchers to Shane. (DS9: \"It's Only a Paper Moon\")\n\n[]"
