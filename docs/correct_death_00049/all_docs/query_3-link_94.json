        "text": "Biography\n\nThe will of the Rev. Thomas Mallory names \"Mary Forde, daughter, 20 s. to buy her a ring\".\n\nIt is thought that John Ford was born about 1636 and that his first marriage occurred about 1660, or a year or two earlier.\n\nThe Mallorys bought and sold land in the Northern Neck region of the colony as well as in the York River valley.When John Ford's name appears in the county records he is found living on Rappahannock Creek, close to the point where the creek runs into the Rappahannock River.The Rev. Phillip Mallory at one time owned 1,000 acres of land on Fleet's Bay in \"Old\" Pappahannock County.\n\nJohn was active in county affairs. He held 500 acres of land in King and Queen County. This may have been his wife Mary's legacy from her father's estate. He served on the county grand jury in 1685, also in 1693, and was under contract to operate a ferry over the river.His place was on the north side.The county seat was at Hobbs-His-Hole, on the south shore.(Hobbs-His-Hole was the old name for Rappahannock)\n\n\"On January 16, 1686, the court contracted with John Ford to provide and keep a sufficient boat for the transporting of footmen from the mouth of of Rappahannock Creek to Mr.John Daingerfield's landing on the Rappahannock River and over the said Rappahannock Creek on the day before court, the day of court, and the day after court.\"\n\nThe will of John Ford was entered for probate before the Richmond County Court (Old Rappahannock was abolished in 1692) on March 6, 1699. The document is badly damaged, but names are legible.The legatees are wife Patience and son John.Wife to be executrix. Witnesses signed: Henry Chappell, Edward G. Newton, and Selah Newton. There is no reference to the first wife Mary nor to the other children.\n\nNote: A photocopied facsimile of John Ford's will is available from the State Archives, Virginia State Library, Richmond, Virginia.\n\nAfter the death of Mary (Mallory) Ford, John Ford married Patience Newman.Thomas Newman who lived across Rappahannock Creek, had been an early settler there.Patience was evidently well-known to the Fords, whose acreage was at the mouth of the creek.\n\nApart from John mentioned in the will, the only other known children were James (will probated Dec.16, 1702) and Elizabeth who married(?) Barnes.\n\nGift\n\n1697-1701 Richmond County, Virginia Deed Book 3; Part 1 [Antient Press]; Page 46\n\nTO ALL XPIAN PEOPLE to whom these presents shall come, I JOHN FORD SENR. of the County of Richmond sendeth greeting.
