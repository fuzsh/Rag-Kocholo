        "text": "THE EVOLUTION OF STATE FUNERALS\n\nFuneral services of great magnificence evolved as customs (from what is known about early Christian mourning) in the 6th century. To this day, no religious ceremonies are conducted with more pomp than those intended to commemorate the departed. The funerals of service members, more than any other ceremony, have followed an old tradition as the living honor the brave dead.\n\nThe first general mourning proclaimed in America was on the death of Benjamin Franklin in 1791 and the next on the death of President George Washington in 1799. The deep and widespread grief occasioned by the death of the first president assembled a great number of local people for the purpose of paying him a last tribute of respect. On Wednesday, 18 Dec. 1799, attended by military honors and the simplest but grandest ceremonies of religion, his body was placed in the family vault at Mount Vernon, Virginia. Due to slow communications and travel of the time period, community services across the country commemorating his life continued several weeks after his passing as word of his death spread.\n\nAnother national observance early in the country’s history commemorated the deaths of Presidents John Adams and Thomas Jefferson on July 4, 1826. Although known as old rivals, both men were heroes and respected leaders in these early years.\n\nThe national funeral marking the first time the nation mourned as one occurred April 19, 1865, in observance of President Abraham Lincoln’s death. Due to increased communications technology, word spread across the country by telegraph and train allowing the country to mourn the loss of its president together.\n\nSeveral military traditions employed today have been brought forward from the past:\n\n(1) Today's customary three volleys fired over a grave probably originated as far back as the Roman Empire. The Roman funeral rite of casting dirt three times on the coffin constituted the \"burial.\" It was customary among the Romans to call the dead three times by name, which ended the funeral ceremony, after which the friends and relatives of the deceased pronounced the word \"vale\" (farewell) three times as they departed from the tomb. In more recent history, three musket volleys were fired to announce that the burying of the dead was completed, and the burial party was ready for battle again.\n\n(2) The custom of using a caisson to carry a casket most likely had its origins in the 1800s when horse-drawn caissons that pulled artillery pieces also doubled as a conveyance to clear fallen soldiers from the battlefield.\n\n(3) In the mid to late 1800s a funeral procession of a mounted officer or enlisted man was accompanied by a riderless horse in mourning caparison followed by a hearse. It was also a custom to have the boots of the deceased thrown over the saddle with heels to the front signifying that his march was ended.\n\nInformation gathered from the manual Drill and Ceremonies, Dec. 86, HQ DA, FM 22-5, updated using the manual Drill and Ceremonies, July 03, HQ DA, FM 3-21.5.\n\nMILITARY HONORS FOR FORMER PRESIDENTS\n\nFormer presidents are afforded specific military honors according to Department of the Army Pamphlet 1-1. Although the following honors are authorized, the family may choose to decline some or all of these specific entitlements.\n\nMilitary escort for the immediate family - The commanding general for Joint Task Force-National Capital Region (JTF-NCR) serves as the military escort for the former president's next of kin from the time of the official announcement of the death until burial.\n\nGuard of Honor - An armed forces element that provides a ceremonial presence when the former president lies in repose or state. Guard of honor members are assigned to ceremonial units of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force and Coast Guard within the National Capital Region.\n\nArmed Forces body bearers - A nine-person team that carries the casket.\n\nMilitary clergy - A military chaplain from one of the services assigned to assist the former president's immediate family and escort the family clergy.\n\nFlag-draped casket – An honor afforded to all military veterans, including the president as the commander-in-chief of the armed forces.\n\nMilitary flyover – Flyovers with missing man formation are provided at funeral or memorial services in honor of rated active-duty aviation personnel, and dignitaries of the Armed Forces or federal government. During a state funeral, the flyover consists of 21 tactical fighter aircraft, in formation as a single lead aircraft followed by 5 flights of four aircraft each. The number three aircraft in the final flight executes the missing man maneuver.\n\nThis honor is provided as the caisson passes through the intersection of Constitution Avenue and 4th Street, N.W. en route to the U.S. Capitol, or at interment if there is no formal procession in Washington, D.C.\n\nCaisson – First used by the military to carry ammunition, the caisson is now used in a ceremonial capacity during formal military funeral processions. The Caisson Platoon of the U.S. Army’s 3rd Infantry Regiment (The Old Guard) transports the remains during the main funeral procession in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe caisson consists of six horses of the same color, three riders, and a section chief mounted on a separate horse. The caisson is a converted transport wagon for a 75mm cannon and is also used to honor fallen comrades during full-honor funerals at Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nCaparisoned horse – A riderless horse that follows the caisson carrying the casket of any Army or Marine Corps officer in the rank of colonel or above, and presidents as commanders-in-chief. A pair of boots are reversed in the stirrups of the empty saddle to symbolize the warrior will never ride again.\n\n21-Gun Salute - A cannon salute of 21 rounds fired with five-second intervals between rounds.\n\nFiring three volleys over a grave – A volley traditionally fired by a seven-member firing party. This practice originates in the custom of halting battles to remove the dead from the battlefield. Once the deceased troops were removed, three rifle volleys were fired as a signal that the battle could resume. The fact that the firing party consists of seven service members firing three volleys does not constitute a 21-gun salute.\n\nMilitary Musical Honors - The music played at a military funeral to honor the former president during each phase of the funeral. Some traditional selections include:\n\nRuffles and Flourishes - Ruffles are played on drums and flourishes on bugles. They are sounded together, once for each star of the general officer being honored or according to the title or office held. Four ruffles and flourishes are the highest honor and are played for presidents.\n\n“Hail to the Chief” - Traditional musical honors played for the president and former presidents of the United States.\n\nThe National Anthem, “The Star Spangled Banner”\n\n“Taps” - A bugle call sounded over the grave of a service member that dates back to the Civil War.\n\nFor more information and to download fact sheets on military honors, visit www.jfhq.northcom.mil.\n\nInformation gathered from the manual Drill and Ceremonies, July 03, HQ DA, FM 3-21.5.\n\nSTATE FUNERAL CEREMONIAL TRADITIONS\n\nA state funeral is a national tribute which is traditionally reserved for a head of state. The United States conducts state funerals on behalf of all persons who hold, or have held, the office of president as well as a president-elect and other persons designated by the president. Foreign countries also mourn the loss of a former head of state and their participation generates its own protocol.\n\nMilitary regulations provide guidance for how the United States conducts a state funeral and all involved ceremonies. While military regulation, tradition and protocol influence state funerals, personalized plans are developed to reflect family desires. Typically, family desires determine the number, location and sequence of public ceremonies and observances consistent with military regulations.\n\nFor example, in keeping with the wishes of the family, President Nixon's funeral took place over a two-day period from April 26-27, 1994, and included ceremonies in New York and California, but no ceremonies in Washington. President Reagan’s funeral took place over a seven-day period from June 5-11, 2004, and included services and ceremonies in Washington and California. President Ford’s funeral took place over a nine-day period from Dec. 26, 2006, to Jan. 3, 2007, and included services and ceremonies in California, Washington and Michigan.\n\nThe following list identifies the customary elements of a state funeral.\n\nNOTE: This does not reflect the schedule for every state funeral. Each presidential family tailors the funeral to their wishes.\n\nFormal notification of demise to all branches of government, foreign countries and the public.\n\nRepose in home state\n\nMovement to Washington, D.C.\n\nRepose at the National Cathedral in its Bethlehem Chapel\n\nCasket transfer from hearse to horse-drawn caisson at the intersection of 16th Street and Constitution Avenue in Washington, D.C.\n\nMain funeral procession along Constitution Avenue in Washington, D.C.\n\nLying in state at the U.S. Capitol\n\nNational funeral service in Washington, D.C.\n\nMovement to final resting place\n\nPrivate funeral service and interment\n\nExplanation of Special Terms\n\nRepose - The remains lie in one or more selected places for public viewing (e.g. church, presidential library or museum). This also includes appropriate arrival and departure ceremonies.\n\nLying in state - The remains lie in the Rotunda of the U.S. Capitol allowing the public to pay their respects. Appropriate arrival and departure ceremonies are included.\n\nNOTE: Lying in state occurs in the U.S. Capitol ONLY.\n\nCasket Transfer - At 16th Street and Constitution Avenue, the remains are transferred by Armed Forces body bearers from a hearse to a horse-drawn caisson for movement to the U.S. Capitol to begin or end the main funeral procession.\n\nMain Funeral Procession - Moves along Constitution Avenue.\n\nComposition of Main Funeral Procession (in order of march):\n\nInformation gathered from Army Pamphlet 1-1 and historical documents.\n\nPolice escort\n\nMilitary units, including federal service academies, Active Duty, National Guard, Reserve, and military bands\n\nCortege – the segment of the main funeral procession in a state funeral that includes, in order of march:\n\nSpecial honor guard\n\nHonorary pallbearers\n\nNational color\n\nClergy\n\nCaisson\n\nArmed Forces body bearers\n\nPresidential color\n\nCaparisoned horse\n\nFamily"
