Thus I obey ye.\n\nAfter so many quarrels as dissension,\n\nFury, and rage had broacht in blood, and some-\n\ntimes\n\nWith death to such confederates as sided\n\nWith now-dead Thrasus and yourself, my lord;\n\nOur present king, Amyclas, reconcil'd 21\n\nYour eager swords and seal'd a gentle peace:\n\nFriends you profest yourselves; which to con-\n\nfirm,\n\nA resolution for a lasting league\n\nBetwixt your families was entertain'd, 25\n\nBy joining in a Hymenean bond\n\nMe and the fair Penthea, only daughter\n\nTo Thrasus.\n\nCrot. What of this?\n\nOrg. Much, much, dear sir.\n\nA freedom of converse, an interchange\n\nOf holy and chaste love, so fixt our souls 30\n\nIn a firm growth of union, that no time\n\nCan eat into the pledge: we had enjoy'd\n\nThe sweets our vows expected, had not cruelty\n\nPrevented all those triumphs we prepar'd for,\n\nBy Thrasus his untimely death.\n\nCrot. Most certain. 35\n\nOrg. From this time sprouted up that poison-\n\nous stalk\n\nOf aconite, whose ripened fruit hath ravisht\n\nAll health, all comfort of a happy life;\n\nFor Ithocles, her brother, proud of youth,\n\nAnd prouder in his power, nourisht closely 40\n\nThe memory of former discontents,\n\nTo glory in revenge. By cunning partly,\n\nPartly by threats, 'a woos at once and forces\n\nHis virtuous sister to admit a marriage\n\nWith Bassanes, a nobleman, in honour 45\n\nAnd riches, I confess, beyond my fortunes.\n\nCrot. All this is no sound reason to impor-\n\ntune\n\nMy leave for thy departure.\n\nOrg. Now it follows.\n\nBeauteous Penthea, wedded to this torture\n\nBy an insulting brother, being secretly 50\n\nCompell'd to yield her virgin freedom up\n\nTo him who never can usurp her heart,\n\nBefore contracted mine, is now so yok'd\n\nTo a most barbarous thraldrom, misery,\n\nAffliction, that he savours not humanity, 55\n\nWhose sorrow melts not into more than pity\n\nIn hearing but her name.\n\nCrot. As how, pray?\n\nOrg. Bassanes,\n\nThe man that calls her wife, considers truly\n\nWhat heaven of perfections he is lord of\n\nBy thinking fair Penthea his: this thought 60\n\nBegets a kind of monster-love, which love\n\nIs nurse unto a fear so strong and servile\n\nAs brands all dotage with a jealousy:\n\nAll eyes who gaze upon that shrine of beauty\n\nHe doth resolve 1 do homage to the miracle; 65\n\nSome one, he is assur'd, may now or then,\n\nIf opportunity but sort, 2 prevail.\n\nSo much, out of a self-unworthiness,\n\nHis fears transport him; not that he finds\n\ncause\n\nIn her obedience, but his own distrust. 70\n\nCrot. You spin out your discourse.\n\nOrg. My griefs are violent:\n\nFor knowing how the maid was heretofore\n\nCourted by me, his jealousies grow wild\n\nThat I should steal again into her favours,\n\nAnd undermine her virtues; which the gods 75\n\nKnow I nor dare nor dream of. Hence, from\n\nhence\n\nI undertake a voluntary exile;\n\nFirst, by my absence to take off the cares\n\nOf jealous Bassanes; but chiefly, sir,\n\nTo free Penthea from a hell on earth; 80\n\nLastly, to lose the memory of something\n\nHer presence makes to live in me afresh.\n\nCrot. Enough, my Orgilus, enough. To Ath-\n\nens,\n\nI give a full consent. — Alas, good lady! —\n\nWe shall hear from thee often?\n\nOrg. Often.\n\nCrot. See, 85\n\nThy sister comes to give a farewell.\n\nEnter EUPHRANEA.\n\nEuph. Brother!\n\nOrg. Euphranea, thus upon thy cheeks I\n\nprint\n\nA brother's kiss; more careful of thine honour,\n\nThy health, and thy well-doing, than my life.\n\nBefore we part, in presence of our father, 90\n\nI must prefer a suit t' ye.\n\nEuph. You may style it,\n\nMy brother, a command.\n\nOrg. That you will promise\n\nTo pass never to any man, however\n\nWorthy, your faith, till, with our father's\n\nleave,\n\nI give a free consent.\n\nCrot. An easy motion! 95\n\nI'll promise for her, Orgilus.\n\nOrg. Your pardon;\n\nEuphranea's oath must yield me satisfaction.\n\nEuph. By Vesta's sacred fires I swear.\n\nCrot. And I,\n\nBy Great Apollo's beams, join in the vow,\n\nNot without thy allowance to bestow her 100\n\nOn any living.\n\nOrg. Dear Euphranea,\n\nMistake me not: far, far 't is from my thought,\n\nAs far from any wish of mine, to hinder\n\nPreferment to an honourable bed\n\nOr fitting fortune; thou art young and hand-\n\nsome; 105\n\nAnd 't were injustice, — more, a tyranny, —\n\nNot to advance thy merit. Trust me, sister,\n\nIt shall be my first care to see thee match'd\n\nAs may become thy choice and our contents. 109\n\nI have your oath.\n\nEuph. You have. But mean you, brother,\n\nTo leave us, as you say?\n\nCrot. Ay, ay, Euphranea;\n\n____________________\n\n1 Decide 2 Agree.\n\n771\n\nHe has just grounds direct him. I will prove\n\nA father and a brother to thee.\n\nEuph. Heaven\n\nDoes look into the secrets of all hearts:\n\nGods, you have mercy with ye, else —\n\nCrot. Doubt nothing; 115\n\nThy brother will return in safety to us.\n\nOrg. Souls sunk in sorrows never are without\n\n'em.\n\nThey change fresh airs, but bear their griefs\n\nabout 'em. Exeunt omnes.\n\nSCENE II. 1\n\nFlourish. Enter AMYCLAS the King, ARMOS-\n\nTES, PROPHILUS, [Courtiers,] and Attendants.\n\nAmy. The Spartan gods are gracious; our\n\nhumility\n\nShall bend before their altars, and perfume\n\nTheir temples with abundant sacrifice.\n\nSee, lords, Amyclas, your old king, is ent'ring\n\nInto his youth again! I shall shake off 5\n\nThis silver badge of age, and change this snow\n\nFor hairs as gay as are Apollo's locks;\n\nOur heart leaps in new vigour.\n\nArm. May old time\n\nRun back to double your long life, great sir!\n\nAmy. It will, it must, Armostes: thy bold\n\nnephew, 10\n\nDeath-braving Ithocles, brings to our gates\n\nTriumphs and peace upon his conquering\n\nsword.\n\nLaconia is a monarchy at length;\n\nHath in this latter war trod under foot\n\nMessene's pride; Messene bows her neck 15\n\nTo Lacedaemon's royalty. O, 't was\n\nA glorious victory, and doth deserve\n\nMore than a chronicle — a temple, lords,\n\nA temple to the name of Ithocles. —\n\nWhere didst thou leave him, Prophilus?\n\nPro. At Pephon, 20\n\nMost gracious sovereign; twenty of the noblest\n\nOf the Messenians there attend your pleasure,\n\nFor such conditions as you shall propose\n\nIn settling peace, and liberty of life.\n\nAmy. When comes your friend, the general?\n\nPro. He promis'd 25\n\nTo follow with all speed convenient.\n\nEnter CALANTHA, EUPHRANEA; CHRISTALLA\n\nand PHILEMA [with a garland;] and CROTO-\n\nLON.\n\nAmy. Our daughter! — Dear Calantha, the\n\nhappy news,\n\nThe conquest of Messene, hath already\n\nEnrich'd thy knowledge.\n\nCal. With the circumstance\n\nAnd manner of the fight, related faithfully 30\n\nBy Prophilus himself: — But, pray, sir, tell me\n\nHow doth the youthful general demean\n\nHis actions in these fortunes?\n\nPro. Excellent princess,\n\nYour own fair eyes may soon report a truth\n\nUnto your judgment, with what moderation, 35\n\nCalmness of nature, measure, bounds, and limits\n\nOf thankfulness and joy, 'a doth digest\n\nSuch amplitude of his success as would\n\nIn others, moulded of a spirit less clear,\n\nAdvance 'em to comparison with heaven: 40\n\nBut Ithocles —\n\nCal. Your friend —\n\nPro. He is so, madam,\n\nIn which the period of my fate consists:\n\nHe, in this firmament of honour, stands\n\nLike a star fixt, not mov'd with any thunder\n\nOf popular applause or sudden lightning 45\n\nOf self-opinion; he hath serv'd his country,\n\nAnd thinks 't was but his duty.\n\nCrot. You describe\n\nA miracle of man.\n\nAmy. Such, Crotolon,\n\nOn forfeit of a king's word, thou wilt find\n\nhim. — Flourish. 49\n\nHark, warning of his coming! All attend him.\n\nEnter ITHOCLES, HEMOPHIL, and GRONEAS;\n\nthe rest of the Lords ushering him in.\n\nReturn into these arms, thy home, thy sanctuary,\n\nDelight of Sparta, treasure of my bosom,\n\nMine own, own Ithocles!\n\nIth. Your humblest subject.\n\nArm. Proud of the blood I claim an interest\n\nin.\n\nAs brother to thy mother, I embrace thee, 55\n\nRight noble nephew.\n\nIth. Sir, your love's too partial.\n\nCrot. Our country speaks by me, who by thy\n\nvalour,\n\nWisdom, and service, shares in this great ac-\n\ntion;\n\nReturning thee, in part of thy due merits,\n\nA general welcome.\n\nIth. You exceed in bounty. 60\n\nCal. Christalla, Philema, the chaplet. [Takes\n\nthe chaplet from them.] — Ithocles,\n\nUpon the wings of Fame the singular\n\nAnd chosen fortune of an high attempt\n\nIs borne so past the view of common sight,\n\nThat I myself with mine own hands have\n\nwrought, 65\n\nTo crown thy temples, this provincial garland: 2\n\nAccept, wear, and enjoy it as our gift\n\nDeserv'd, not purchas'd.\n\nIth. Y' are a royal maid.\n\nAmy. She is in all our daughter.\n\nIth. Let me blush,\n\nAcknowledging how poorly I have serv'd, 70\n\nWhat nothings I have done, compar'd with th'\n\nhonours\n\nHeap'd on the issue of a willing mind;\n\nIn that lay mine ability, that only:\n\nFor who is he so sluggish from his birth,\n\nSo little worthy of a name or country, 75\n\nThat owes not out of gratitude for life\n\nA debt of service, in what kind soever\n\nSafety or counsel of the commonwealth\n\nRequires, for payment? ____________________\n\n1 A room in the palace. 2 The laurel wreath . . . conferred on those who\n\nadded a province to the empire. (Gifford.)\n\n772\n\nCal. 'A speaks truth.\n\nIth. Whom heaven\n\nIs pleas'd to style victorious, there to such 80\n\nApplause runs madding, like the drunken\n\npriests\n\nIn Bacchus' sacrifices, without reason,\n\nVoicing the leader-on a demi-god;\n\nWhenas, indeed, each common soldier's blood\n\nDrops down as current coin in that hard pur-\n\nchase 85\n\nAs his whose much more delicate condition\n\nHath suckt the milk of ease: judgment; com-\n\nmands,\n\nBut resolution executes. I use not,\n\nBefore this royal presence, these fit slights 1\n\nAs in contempt of such as can direct; 90\n\nMy speech hath other end; not to attribute\n\nAll praise to one man's fortune, which is\n\nstrengthen'd\n\nBy many hands. For instance, here is Prophilus,\n\nA gentleman — I cannot flatter truth —\n\nOf much desert; and, though in other rank, 95\n\nBoth Hemophil and Groneas were not missing\n\nTo wish their country's peace; for, in a word,\n\nAll there did strive their best, and 't was our\n\nduty.\n\nAmy. Courtiers turn soldiers! — We vouch-\n\nsafe our hand.\n\n[HEMOPHIL and GRONEAS kiss his\n\nhand.]\n\nObserve your great example.\n\nHem. With all diligence. 100\n\nGron. Obsequiously and hourly.\n\nAmy. Some repose\n\nAfter these toils is 2 needful. We must think\n\non\n\nConditions for the conquered; they expect 3\n\n'em.\n\nOn! — Come, my Ithocles.\n\nEuph. Sir, with your favour,\n\nI need not a supporter.\n\nPro. Fate instructs me. 105\n\nExeunt. HEMOPHIL stays CHRIS-\n\nTALLA; GRONEAS, PHILEMA.\n\nChris. With me?\n\nPhil. Indeed, I dare not stay.\n\nHem. Sweet lady.\n\nSoldiers are blunt, — your lip.\n\nChris. Fie, this is rudeness:\n\nYou went not hence such creatures.\n\nGro. Spirit of valour\n\nIs of a mounting nature.\n\nPhil. It appears so. —\n\nPray, in earnest, how many men apiece 110\n\nHave you two been the death of?\n\nGro. 'Faith, not many;\n\nWe were compos'd of mercy.\n\nHem. For our daring,\n\nYou heard the general's approbation\n\nBefore the king.\n\nChris. You \"wish'd your country's peace;\"\n\nThat show'd your charity: where are your\n\nspoils, 115\n\nSuch as the soldier fights for?\n\nPhil. They are coming.\n\nChris. By the next carrier, are they not?\n\nGro. Sweet Philema,\n\nWhen I was in the thickest of mine enemies,\n\nSlashing off one man's head, another's nose,\n\nAnother's arms and legs, —\n\nPhil. And all together. 120\n\nGro. Then would I with a sigh remember\n\nthee,\n\nAnd cry \"Dear Philema, 't is for thy sake\n\nI do these deeds of wonder!\" — Dost not love\n\nme\n\nWith all thy heart now?\n\nPhil. Now as heretofore.\n\nI have not put my love to use; the principal 125\n\nWill hardly yield an interest.\n\nGro. By Mars,\n\nI'll marry thee!\n\nPhil. By Vulcan, you 're forsworn,\n\nExcept my mind do alter strangely.\n\nGro. One word.\n\nChris. You lie beyond all modesty: — for-\n\nbear me. 129\n\nHem. I'll make thee mistress of a city; 't is\n\nMine own by conquest.\n\nChris. By petition; sue for 't\n\nIn forma pauperis. — City! kennel. — Gallants,\n\nOff with your feathers, put on aprons, gallants;\n\nLearn to reel, thrum, 4 or trim a lady's dog, 134\n\nAnd be good quiet souls of peace, hobgoblins!\n\nHem. Christalla!\n\nChris. Practise to drill hogs, in hope\n\nTo share in the acorns. — Soldiers! corncutters,\n\nBut not so valiant; they ofttimes draw blood,\n\nWhich you durst never do. When you have\n\npractis'd\n\nMore wit or more civility, we'll rank ye 140\n\nI' th' list of men: till then, brave things-at-\n\narms,\n\nDare not to speak to us, — most potent Gro-\n\nneas! —\n\nPhil. And Hemophil the hardy! — at your\n\nservices.\n\nExeunt CHRISTALLA and PHILEMA.\n\nGro. They scorn us as they did before we\n\nwent.\n\nHem. Hang 'em! let us scorn them, and be\n\nreveng'd. 145\n\nGro. Shall we?\n\nHem. We will: and when we slight them thus,\n\nInstead of following them, they'll follow us;\n\nIt is a woman's nature,\n\nGro. 'T is a scurvy one. Exeunt.\n\nSCENE III. 5\n\nEnter TECNICUS, a philosopher, and ORGILUS\n\ndisguised like a Scholar of his.\n\nTec. Tempt not the stars; young man, thou\n\ncanst not play\n\nWith the severity of fate: this change\n\nOf habit and disguise in outward view\n\nHides not the secrets of thy soul within thee\n\nFrom their quick-piercing eyes, which dive at\n\nall times 5\n\n____________________\n\n1 Appropriately belittling terms. 2 Q. are. 3 Await. 4 Weave. 5 The gardens of the palace. A grove.\n\n773\n\nDown to thy thoughts: in thy aspect I note\n\nA consequence of danger.\n\nOrg. Give me leave,\n\nGrave Tecnicus, without foredooming destiny,\n\nUnder thy roof to ease my silent griefs,\n\nBy applying to my hidden wounds the balm 10\n\nOf thy oraculous lectures. If my fortune\n\nRun such a crooked by-way as to wrest\n\nMy steps to ruin, yet thy learned precepts\n\nShall call me back and set my footings straight.\n\nI will not court the world.\n\nTec. Ah, Orgilus, 15\n\nNeglects in young men of delights and life\n\nRun often to extremities; they care not\n\nFor harms to others who contemn their own.\n\nOrg. But I, most learned artist, am not so\n\nmuch\n\nAt odds with nature that I grudge the thrift 20\n\nOf any true deserver; nor doth malice\n\nOf present hopes so check them with despair\n\nAs that I yield to thought of more affliction\n\nThan what is incident to frailty: wherefore\n\nImpute not this retired course of living 25\n\nSome little time to any other cause\n\nThan what I justly render, — the information\n\nOf an unsettled mind; as the effect\n\nMust clearly witness.\n\nTec. Spirit of truth inspire thee!\n\nOn these conditions I conceal thy change, 30\n\nAnd willingly admit thee for an auditor. —\n\nI'll to my study.\n\nOrg. I to contemplations\n\nIn these delightful walks. Exit TECNICUS.\n\nThus metamorphos'd\n\nI may without suspicion hearken after\n\nPenthea's usage and Euphranea's faith. 35\n\nLove, thou art full of mystery! The deities\n\nThemselves are not secure 1 in searching out\n\nThe secrets of those flames, which, hidden,\n\nwaste\n\nA breast made tributary to the laws\n\nOf beauty: physic yet hath never found 40\n\nA remedy to cure a lover's wound. —\n\nHa! who are those that cross yon private walk\n\nInto the shadowing grove in amorous foldings?\n\nPROPHILUS passeth over, supporting 2 EUPHRA-\n\nNEA, and whispering.\n\nMy sister! O, my sister! 't is Euphranea\n\nWith Prophilus: supported too! I Would 45\n\nIt were an apparition! Prophilus\n\nIs Ithocles his friend: it strangely puzzles me.\n\nAgain! help me, my book; this scholar's habit\n\nMust stand my privilege: my mind is busy,\n\nMine eyes and ears are open.\n\nWalks by, reading.\n\nRe-enter PROPHILUS and EUPHRANEA.\n\nPro. Do not waste 50\n\nThe span of this stol'n time, lent by the gods\n\nFor precious use, in niceness. 3 Bright Eu-\n\nphranea,\n\nShould I repeat old vows, or study new,\n\nFor purchase of belief to my desires, —\n\nOrg. [Aside.] Desires!\n\nPro. My service, my integrity, — 55\n\nOrg. [Aside.] That's better.\n\nPro. I should but repeat a lesson\n\nOft conn'd without a prompter but thine eyes.\n\nMy love is honourable.\n\nOry. [Aside] So was mine\n\nTo my Penthea, chastely honourable.\n\nPro. Nor wants there more addition to my\n\nwish 60\n\nOf happiness than having thee a wife;\n\nAlready sure of Ithocles, a friend\n\nFirm and unalterable.\n\nOrg. [Aside.] But a brother\n\nMore cruel than the grave.\n\nEuph. What Can you look for,\n\nIn answer to your noble protestations, 65\n\nFrom an unskilful maid, but language suited\n\nTo a divided mind?\n\nOrg. [Aside.] Hold out, Euphranea!\n\nEuph. Know, Prophilus, I never undervalu'd,\n\nFrom the first time you mentioned worthy love,\n\nYour merit, means, or person: it had been 70\n\nA fault of judgment in me, and a dulness\n\nIn my affections, not to weigh and thank\n\nMy better stars that offered me the grace\n\nOf so much blissfulness. For, to speak truth,\n\nThe law of my desires kept equal pace 75\n\nWith yours; nor have I left that resolution:\n\nBut only, in a word, whatever choice\n\nLives nearest in my heart must first procure\n\nConsent both from my father and my brother,\n\nEre he can own me his.\n\nOrg. [Aside.] She is forsworn else. 80\n\nPro. Leave me that task.\n\nEuph. My brother, ere he parted\n\nTo Athens, had my oath.\n\nOrg. [Aside.] Yes, yes, 'a had, sure.\n\nPro. I doubt not, with the means the court\n\nsupplies,\n\nBut to prevail at pleasure.\n\nOrg. [Aside.] Very likely!\n\nPro. Meantime, best, dearest, I may build\n\nmy hopes 85\n\nOn the foundation of thy constant suff'rance\n\nIn any opposition.\n\nEuph. Death shall sooner\n\nDivorce life and the joys I have in living\n\nThan my chaste vows from truth.\n\nPro. On thy fair hand\n\nI seal the like. 90\n\nOrg. [Aside.] There is no faith in woman.\n\nPassion, O, be contain'd! My very heart-strings\n\nAre on the tenters.4\n\nEuph. Sir, we are overheard.\n\nCupid protect us! 'T was a stirring, sir,\n\nOf some one near.\n\nPro. Your fears are needless, lady; 95\n\nNone have access into these private pleasures\n\nExcept some near in court, or bosom-student\n\nFrom Tecnicus his oratory, granted\n\nBy special favour lately from the king\n\nUnto the grave philosopher.\n\nEuph. Methinks 100\n\nI hear one talking to himself, — I see him. ____________________\n\n1 Certain. 2 With his arm round her waist. (Dyce.) 3 Coyness; over-particular scruples. 4 Hooks for stretching cloth; on the rack.\n\n774\n\nPro. 'T is a poor scholar, as I told you, lady.\n\nOrg. [Aside.] I am discovered. — [Half aloud\n\nto himself, as if studying.] Say it; is it\n\npossible,\n\nWith a smooth tongue, a leering countenance,\n\nFlattery, or force of reason — I come t' ye,\n\nsir — 105\n\nTo turn or to appease the raging sea?\n\nAnswer to that. — Your art! what art to catch\n\nAnd hold fast in a net the sun's small atoms?\n\nNo, no; they'll out, they'll out: ye may as\n\neasily\n\nOutrun a cloud driven by a northern blast 110\n\nAs fiddle-faddle so! Peace, or speak sense,\n\nEuph. Call you this thing a scholar? 'Las,\n\nhe's lunatic.\n\nPro. Observe him, sweet; 't is but his recrea-\n\ntion.\n\nOrg. But will you hear a little? You're so\n\ntetchy,\n\nYou keep no rule in argument. Philosophy 115\n\nWorks not upon impossibilities,\n\nBut natural conclusions. — Mew! — absurd!\n\nThe metaphysics are but speculations\n\nOf the celestial bodies, or such accidents\n\nAs not mixt perfectly, in the air engend'red 120\n\nAppear to us unnatural; that's all.\n\nProve it; yet, with a reverence to your gravity,\n\nI'll balk illiterate sauciness, submitting\n\nMy sole opinion to the touch of writers.\n\nPro. Now let us fall in with him.\n\n[They come forward.]\n\nOrg. Ha, ha, ha! 125\n\nThese apish boys, when they but taste the\n\ngrammates 1\n\nAnd principles of theory, imagine\n\nThey can oppose their teachers. Confidence\n\nLeads many into errors.\n\nPro. By your leave, sir.\n\nEuph. Are you a scholar, friend?\n\nOrg. I am, gay creature, 130\n\nWith pardon of your deities, a mushroom\n\nOn whom the dew of heaven drops now and\n\nthen;\n\nThe sun shines on me too, I thank his beams!\n\nSometime I feel their warmth; and eat and\n\nsleep.\n\nPro. Does Tecnicus read to thee?\n\nOrg. Yes, forsooth. 135\n\nHe is my master surely; yonder door\n\nOpens upon his study.\n\nPro. Happy creatures!\n\nSuch people toil not, sweet, in heats of state,\n\nNor sink in thaws of greatness; their affections\n\nKeep order with the limits of their modesty; 140\n\nTheir love is love of virtue. — What's thy\n\nname?\n\nOrg. Aplotes, sumptuous master, a poor\n\nwretch.\n\nEuph. Dost thou want anything?\n\nOrg. Books, Venus, books.\n\nPro. Lady, a new conceit; comes in my\n\nthought,\n\nAnd most available for both our comforts. 145\n\nEuph. My lord, —\n\nPro. Whiles I endeavour to deserve\n\nYour father's blessing to our loves, this\n\nscholar\n\nMay daily at some certain hours attend 2\n\nWhat notice I can write of my success, 149\n\nHere in this grove, and give it to your hands\n\nThe like from you to me: so can we never\n\nBarr'd of our mutual speech, want sure intelli-\n\ngence,\n\nAnd thus our hearts may talk when our tongues\n\ncannot.\n\nEuph.

Now 't is well said, my lord. — What,\n\nlady! laugh,\n\nBe merry; time is precious.\n\nBass. [Aside.] Furies whip thee! 90\n\nPen. Alas, my lord, this language to your\n\nhand-maid\n\nSounds as would music to the deaf; I need\n\nNo braveries nor cost of art to draw\n\nThe whiteness of my name into offence:\n\nLet such, if any such there are, who covet 95\n\nA curiosity of admiration,\n\nBy laying-out their plenty to full view,\n\nAppear in gaudy outsides; my attires\n\nShall suit the inward fashion of my mind;\n\nFrom which, if your opinion, nobly plac'd, 100\n\nChange not the livery your words bestow,\n\nMy fortunes with my hopes are at the highest.\n\nBass.

From your brother\n\nBy virtue of your love to him, I require\n\nYour instant presence, fairest.\n\nPen. He is well, sir?\n\nPro. The gods preserve him ever! Yet, dear\n\nbeauty,\n\nI find some alteration in him lately, 140\n\nSince his return to Sparta. — My good lord,\n\nI pray, use no delay.\n\nBass. We had not needed\n\nAn invitation, if his sister's health\n\nHad not fallen into question. — Haste, Penthea,\n\nSlack not a minute. — Lead the way, good\n\nProphilus; 145\n\nI'll follow step by step.\n\nPro.

You stick, Lord Crotolon, upon a point\n\nToo nice and too unnecessary; Prophilus\n\nIs every way desertful. I am confident\n\nYour wisdom is too ripe to need instruction\n\nFrom your son's tutelage.\n\nCrot. Yet not so ripe, 20\n\nMy Lord Armostes, that it dares to dote\n\nUpon the painted meat 1 of smooth persuasion,\n\nWhich tempts me to a breach of faith.\n\nIth. Not yet\n\nResolv'd, my lord? Why, if your son's consent\n\nBe so available, we'll write to Athens 25\n\nFor his repair to Sparta. The king's hand\n\nWill join with our desires; he has been mov'd\n\nto 't.\n\nArm. Yes, and the king himself impórtun'd\n\nCrotolon\n\nFor a dispatch.\n\nCrot. Kings may command; their wills\n\nAre laws not to be questioned.\n\nIth. By this marriage 30\n\nYou knit an union so devout, so hearty,\n\nBetween your loves to me and mine to yours,\n\nAs if mine own blood had an interest in it;\n\nFor Prophilus is mine, and I am his.\n\nCrot. My lord, my lord! —\n\nIth. What, good sir? Speak your thought. 35\n\nCrot. Had this sincerity been real once,\n\nMy Orgilus had not been now unwiv'd,\n\nNor your lost sister buried in a bride-bed.\n\nYour uncle here, Armostes knows this truth;\n\nFor had your father Thrasus liv'd, — but peace\n\nDwell in his grave!

[Aside.] 'A presses home the injury; it\n\nsmarts. —\n\nNo reprehensions, uncle; I deserve 'em.\n\nYet, gentle sir, consider what the heat\n\nOf an unsteady youth, a giddy brain, 45\n\nGreen indiscretion, flattery of greatness,\n\nRawness of judgment, wilfulness in folly,\n\nThoughts vagrant as the wind and as uncertain,\n\nMight lead a boy in years to: — 't was a fault,\n\nA capital fault; for then I could not dive 50\n\nInto the secrets of commanding love;\n\nSince when, experience, by the extremes 2 (in\n\nothers),\n\nHath forc'd me collect. 3 And, trust me, Croto-\n\nlon,\n\nI will redeem those wrongs with any service\n\nYour satisfaction can require for current. 55\n\nArm. The 4 acknowledgment is satisfaction:\n\nWhat would you more?\n\nCrot. I'm conquer'd: if Euphranea\n\nHerself admit the motion, let it be so;\n\nI doubt not my son's liking.\n\nIth.

I present ye\n\nA stranger here in court, my lord; for did not\n\nDesire of seeing you draw her abroad,\n\nWe had not been made happy in her company.\n\nIth. You are a gracious princess. — Sister,\n\nwedlock 65\n\nHolds too severe a passion in your nature,\n\nWhich can engross all duty to your husband,\n\nWithout attendance on so dear a mistress. —\n\n[To BASSANES.] 'T is not my brother's pleasure,\n\nI presume,\n\nT' immure her in a chamber.\n\nBass. 'T is her will; 70\n\nShe governs her own hours. Noble Ithocles,\n\nWe thank the gods for your success and wel-\n\nfare:\n\nOur lady has of late been indispos'd,\n\nElse we had waited on you with the first.\n\nIth. How does Penthea now?\n\nPen.

[Aside.] I like the answer well; 't is\n\nsad and modest.\n\nThere may be tricks yet, tricks. — Have an eye,\n\nGrausis!\n\nCal.

Such delay is easy. —\n\nThe joys of marriage make thee, Prophilus,\n\nA proud deserver of Euphranea's love,\n\nAnd her of thy desert!\n\nPro. Most sweetly gracious! 85\n\nBass. The joys of marriage are the heaven on\n\nearth,\n\nLife's paradise, great princess, the soul's quiet,\n\nSinews of concord, earthly immortality,\n\nEternity of pleasures; — no restoratives\n\nLike to a constant woman! — [Aside.] But\n\nwhere is she? 90\n\n'T would puzzle all the gods but to create\n\nSuch a new monster. — I can speak by proof,\n\nFor I rest in Elysium; 't is my happiness.\n\nCrot.

Sir, I'm not inquisitive 10\n\nOf secrecies without an invitation.\n\nPro.

Rash man! thou layest\n\nA blemish on mine honour, with the hazard\n\nOf thy too-desperate life: yet I profess,\n\nBy all the laws of ceremonious wedlock, 55\n\nI have not given admittance to one thought\n\nOf female change since cruelty enforc'd\n\nDivorce betwixt my body and my heart.\n\nWhy would you fall from goodness thus ?\n\nOrg.

Never shall nor will.\n\nOrg. How!\n\nPen. Hear me; in a word I'll tell thee why.\n\nThe virgin-dowry which my birth bestow'd 100\n\nIs ravish'd by another; my true love\n\nAbhors to think that Orgilus deserv'd\n\nNo better favours than a second bed.\n\nOrg. I must not take this reason.\n\nPen.

Penthea, now\n\nI tell ye, you grow wanton in my sufferance:\n\nCome, sweet, th' art mine.\n\nPen. Uncivil sir, forbear! 110\n\nOr I can turn affection into vengeance;\n\nYour reputation, if you value any,\n\nLies bleeding at my feet. Unworthy man,\n\nIf ever henceforth thou appear in language,\n\nMessage, or letter, to betray my frailty, 115\n\nI'll call thy former protestations lust,\n\nAnd curse my stars for forfeit of my judgment.\n\nGo thou, fit only for disguise, and walks, 2\n\nTo hide thy shame: this once I spare thy life.\n\nI laugh at mine own confidence; my sorrows\n\nBy thee are made inferior to my fortunes. 121\n\nIf ever thou didst harbour worthy love,\n\nDare not to answer.

'A sighed my name, sure, as he parted\n\nfrom me:\n\nI fear I was too rough. Alas, poor gentleman\n\n'A look'd not like the ruins of his youth, 130\n\nBut like the ruins of those ruins.

Just ones, Orgilus,\n\nNot to be contradicted: yet beware\n\nOf an unsure foundation; no fair colours\n\nCan fortify a building faintly jointed.\n\nI have observ'd a growth in thy aspéct 25\n\nOf dangerous extent, sudden, and — look to 't —\n\nI might add, certain —\n\nOrg. My aspéct! Could art\n\nRun through mine inmost thoughts, it should\n\nnot sift\n\nAn inclination there more than what suited\n\nWith justice of mine honour.\n\nTec. I believe it. 30\n\nBut know then, Orgilus, what honour is.\n\nHonour consists not in a bare opinion\n\nBy doing any act that feeds content,\n\nBrave in appearance, 'cause we think it brave;\n\nSuch honour comes by accident, not nature, 35\n\nProceeding from the vices of our passion,\n\nWhich makes our reason drunk: but real hon-\n\nour\n\nIs the reward of virtue, and acquir'd\n\nBy justice, or by valour which for basis\n\nHath justice to uphold it. He then fails 40\n\nIn honour, who for lucre [or] revenge\n\nCommits thefts, murders, treasons, and adul-\n\nteries,\n\nWith suchlike, by intrenching on just laws,\n\nWhose sovereignty is best preserv'd by justice.\n\nThus, as you see how honour must be grounded\n\nOn knowledge, not opinion, — for opinion 46\n\nRelies on probability and accident,\n\nBut knowledge on necessity and truth, —\n\nI leave thee to the fit consideration\n\nOf what becomes the grace of real honour, 50\n\nWishing success to all thy virtuous meanings.\n\nOrg. The gods increase thy wisdom, reverend\n\noracle,\n\nAnd in thy precepts make me ever thrifty! 5\n\nTec. I thank thy wish.

Y' have built me\n\nTo the full height I stand in.\n\nCal. [Aside.] Now or never! — 75\n\nMay I propose a suit?\n\nAmy. Demand, and have it.\n\nCal. Pray, sir, give me this young man, and\n\nno further\n\nAccount him yours than he deserves in all\n\nthings\n\nTo be thought worth mine: I will esteem him\n\nAccording to his merit.\n\nAmy. Still thou 'rt my daughter, 80\n\nStill grow'st upon my heart. — [To ITHOCLES.]\n\nGive me thine hand; —\n\nCalantha, take thine own: in noble actions\n\nThou 'lt find him firm and absolute. — I would not\n\nHave parted with thee, Ithocles, to any\n\nBut to a mistress who is all what I am. 85\n\nIth. A change, great king, most wisht for, 'cause the same.\n\nCal. [Aside to ITHOCLES.] Th' art mine. Have\n\nI now kept my word?\n\nIth. [Aside to CALANTHA.] Divinely.\n\nOrg. Rich fortunes guard, [the] 1 favour of a\n\nprincess\n\nRock thee, brave man, in ever-crowned plenty!\n\nY' are minion of the time; be thankful for\n\nit. — 90\n\n[Aside.] Ho! here 's a swing in destiny — ap-\n\nparent!\n\nThe youth is up on tiptoe, yet may stumble.\n\nAmy. On to your recreations. — Now convey\n\nme\n\nUnto my bed-chamber: none on his forehead\n\nWear a distempered look.\n\nAll. The gods preserve ye! 95\n\nCal. [Aside to ITHOCLES.] Sweet, be not from\n\nmy sight.\n\nIth. [Aside to CALANTHA.] My whole felicity!\n\nExeunt carrying out the king. ORGI-\n\nLUS stays ITHOCLES.\n\nOrg. Shall I be bold, my lord?\n\nIth. Thou canst not, Orgilus.\n\nCall me thine own; for Prophilus must hence-\n\nforth\n\nBe all thy sister's: friendship, though it cease\n\nnot 100\n\nIn marriage, yet is oft at less command\n\nThan when a single freedom can dispose it.\n\nOrg. Most right, my most good lord, my most\n\ngreat lord,\n\nMy gracious princely lord, I might add, royal.\n\nIth. Royal! A subject royal?\n\nOrg. Why not, pray, sir? 105\n\nThe sovereignty of kingdoms in their nonage\n\nStoop'd to desert, not birth; there 's as much\n\nmerit\n\nIn clearness of affection as in puddle\n\nOf generation: you have conquer'd love\n\nEven in the loveliest; if I greatly err not, 110\n\nThe son of Venus hath bequeath'd his quiver\n\nTo Ithocles his manage,2 by whose arrows\n\nCalantha's breast is open'd.\n\nIth. Can't be possible?\n\nOrg. I was myself a piece of suitor once\n\nAnd forward in preferment too; so forward 115\n\nThat, speaking truth, I may without offence,\n\nsir,\n\nPresume to whisper that my hopes, and — hark\n\nye —\n\nMy certainty of marriage stood assured\n\nWith as firm footing — by your leave — as\n\nany's\n\nNow at this very instant — but —\n\nIth. 'T is granted: 120\n\nAnd for a league of privacy between us,\n\nRead o'er my bosom and partake a secret;\n\nThe princess is contracted mine.\n\nOrg. Still, why not?\n\nI now applaud her wisdom: when your king-\n\ndom\n\nStands seated in your will, secure and settled, 125\n\nI dare pronounce you will be a just monarch;\n\nGreece must admire and tremble.\n\nIth. Then the sweetness\n\nOf so imparadis'd a comfort, Orgilus!\n\nIt is to banquet with the gods.\n\nOrg. The glory\n\nOf numerous children, potency of nobles, 130\n\nBent knees, hearts pav'd to tread on!\n\nIth. With a friendship\n\nSo dear, so fast as thine.\n\nOrg. I am unfitting\n\nFor office; but for service —\n\nIth. We 'll distinguish\n\nOur fortunes merely in the title; partners\n\nIn all respects else but the bed.\n\nOrg. The bed! 135\n\nForfend it Jove's own jealousy! — till lastly\n\nWe slip down in the common earth together,\n\nAnd there our beds are equal; save some mon-\n\nument\n\nTo show this was the king, and this the sub-\n\nject. — Soft sad music.\n\nList, what sad sounds are these, — extremely\n\nsad ones? 140\n\nIth. Sure, from Penthea's lodgings.\n\nOrg. Hark! a voice too.\n\nA SONG [within].\n\nO, no more, no more, too late\n\nSighs are spent; the burning tapers\n\nOf a life as chaste as fate,\n\nPure as are unwritten papers,\n\nAre burnt out: no heat, no light\n\nNow remains; 't is ever night.\n\nLove is dead; let lovers' eyes,\n\nLock'd in endless dreams,\n\nTh' extremes of all extremes, 150\n\nOpe no more, for now Love dies,\n\nNow Love dies, — implying\n\nLove's martyrs must be ever, ever dying.\n\nIth. O, my misgiving heart!\n\nOrg. A horrid stillness\n\nSucceeds this deathful air; let 's know tho rea-\n\nson: 155\n\nTread softly; there is mystery in mourning.\n\nExeunt. ____________________\n\n1 Q. to. 2 To the control of Ithocles.\n\n793\n\nACT V\n\nSCENE I. 1\n\nEnter BASSANES, alone.\n\nBass. Athens — to Athens I have sent, the\n\nnursery\n\nOf Greece for learning and the fount of know-\n\nledge;\n\nFor here in Sparta there 's not left amongst us\n\nOne wise man to direct; we 're all turn'd mad-\n\ncaps.\n\n'T is said Apollo is the god of herbs, 5\n\nThen certainly he knows the virtue of 'em:\n\nTo Delphos I have sent too. If there can be\n\nA help for nature, we are sure yet.\n\nEnter ORGILUS.\n\nOrg. Honour\n\nAttend thy counsels ever!\n\nBass. I beseech thee\n\nWith all my heart, let me go from thee quietly;\n\nI will not aught to do with thee, of all men. 11\n\nThe doubles 2 of a hare, — or, in a morning,\n\nSalutes from a splay-footed witch, — to drop\n\nThree drops of blood at th' nose just and no\n\nmore, —\n\nCroaking of ravens, or the screech of owls, 15\n\nAre not so boding mischief as thy crossing\n\nMy private meditations. Shun me, prithee;\n\nAnd if I cannot love thee heartily,\n\nI'll love thee as well as I can.\n\nOrg. Noble Bassanes,\n\nMistake me not.\n\nBass. Phew! then we shall be troubled. 20\n\nThou wert ordain'd my plague — heaven make\n\nme thankful,\n\nAnd give me patience too, heaven, I beseech\n\nthee.\n\nOrg. Accept a league of amity; for hence-\n\nforth,\n\nI vow, by my best genius, in a syllable,\n\nNever to speak vexation. I will study 25\n\nService and friendship, with a zealous sorrow\n\nFor my past incivility towards ye.\n\nBass. Hey-day, good words, good words! I\n\nmust believe 'em,\n\nAnd be a coxcomb for my labour.\n\nOrg. Use not\n\nSo hard a language; your misdoubt is cause-\n\nless. 30\n\nFor instance, if you promise to put on\n\nA constancy of patience, such a patience,\n\nAs chronicle or history ne'er mentioned,\n\nAs follows not example, but shall stand\n\nA wonder and a theme for imitation, 35\n\nThe first, the index 3 pointing to a second,\n\nI will acquaint ye with an unmatch'd secret,\n\nWhose knowledge to your griefs shall set a pe-\n\nriod.\n\nBass. Thou canst not, Orgilus; 't is in the\n\npower\n\nOf the gods only: yet, for satisfaction, 40\n\nBecause I note an earnest in thine utterance,\n\nUnforc'd and naturally free, be resolute 4\n\nThe virgin-bays shall not withstand the light-\n\nning\n\nWith a more careless danger than my constancy\n\nThe full of thy relation. Could it move 45\n\nDistraction in a senseless marble statue,\n\nIt should find me a rock: I do expect now\n\nSome truth of unheard moment.\n\nOrg. To your patience\n\nYou must add privacy, as strong in silence\n\nAs mysteries lock'd-up in Jove's own bosom. 50\n\nBass. A skull hid in the earth a treble age\n\nShall sooner prate.\n\nOrg. Lastly, to such direction\n\nAs the severity of a glorious action\n\nDeserves to lead your wisdom and your judg-\n\nment,\n\nYou ought to yield obedience.\n\nBass. With assurance 55\n\nOf will and thankfulness.\n\nOrg. With manly courage\n\nPlease, then, to follow me.\n\nBass. Where'er, I fear not.\n\nExeunt omnes.\n\nSCENE II. 5\n\nLoud music. Enter GRONEAS and HEMOPHIL,\n\nleading EUPHRANEA; CHRISTALLA and PHI-\n\nLEMA, leading PROPHILUS; NEARCHUS sup-\n\nporting CALANTHA; CROTOLON and AMELUS.\n\nCease loud music; all make a stand.\n\nCal. We miss our servant Ithocles and Orgilus;\n\nOn whom attend they?\n\nCrot. My son, gracious princess,\n\nWhisper'd some new device, to which these revels\n\nShould be but usher: wherein I conceive\n\nLord Ithocles and himself are actors. 5\n\nCal. A fair excuse for absence: as for Bass-\n\nanes,\n\nDelights to him are troublesome: Armostes\n\nIs with the king ?\n\nCrot. He is.\n\nCal. On to the dance! —\n\nDear cousin, hand you the bride; the bride-\n\ngroom must be\n\nIntrusted to my courtship, Be not jealous, 10\n\nEuphranea; I shall scarcely prove a tempt-\n\nress. —\n\nFall to our dance.\n\nMUSIC.\n\nNEARCHUS dances with EUPHRANEA, PROPHI-\n\nLUS with CALANTHA, CHRISTALLA with HEM-\n\nOPHIL, PHILEMA with GRONEAS.\n\nThey dance the first change; during which AR-\n\nMOSTES enters.\n\nArm. (in CALANTHA'S ear.) The king your\n\nfather's dead.\n\nCal. To the other change.\n\nArm. Is't possible? They dance again.\n\nEnter BASSANES.\n\nBass. [whispers CALANTHA.] O, madam!\n\nPenthea, poor Penthea's starved.\n\n____________________\n\n1 A room in Bassanes' house. 2 Q. doublers. 3 The index-hand. 4 Satisfied. 5 A state-room in the palace.\n\n795\n\nCal. Beshrew thee! —\n\nLead to the next.\n\nBass. Amazement dulls my senses. 15\n\nThey dance again.\n\nEnter ORGILUS.\n\nOrg. [whispers CALANTHA.] Brave Ithocles is\n\nmurder'd, murder'd cruelly.\n\nCal. How dull this music sounds ! Strike up\n\nmore sprightly;\n\nOur footings are not active like our heart,\n\nWhich treads the nimbler measure.\n\nOrg. I am thunderstruck.\n\nThe last change. Cease music.\n\nCal. So! let us breathe awhile. — Hath not\n\nthis motion, 20\n\nRais'd fresher colour on your cheeks?\n\nNear. Sweet princess,\n\nA perfect purity of blood enamels\n\nThe beauty of your white.\n\nCal. We all look cheerfully;\n\nAnd, cousin, 't is, methinks, a rare presumption\n\nIn any who prefer our lawful pleasures 25\n\nBefore their own sour censure, t' interrupt\n\nThe custom of this ceremony bluntly.\n\nNear. None dares, lady.\n\nCal. Yes, yes; some hollow voice deliver'd to me\n\nHow that the king was dead.\n\nArm. The king is dead: 30\n\nThat fatal news was mine; for in mine arms\n\nHe breath'd his last, and with his crown be-\n\nqueath'd ye\n\nYour mother's wedding ring; which here I ten-\n\nder.\n\nCrot. Most strange!\n\nCal. Peace crown his ashes! We are queen,\n\nthen. 35\n\nNear. Long live Calantha! Sparta's sovereign\n\nqueen!\n\nAll. Long live the queen!\n\nCal. What whispered Bassanes?\n\nBass. That my Penthea, miserable soul,\n\nWas starv'd to death.\n\nCal. She's happy; she hath finish'd\n\nA long and painful progress. — A third mur-\n\nmur\n\nPierc'd mine unwilling ears.\n\nOrg. That Ithocles 41\n\nWas murder'd; — rather butcher'd, had not\n\nbravery\n\nOf an undaunted spirit, conquering terror,\n\nProclaim'd his last act triumph over ruin.\n\nArm. How ! murder'd !\n\nCal. By whose hand?\n\nOrg. By mine; this weapon 45\n\nWas instrument to my revenge: the reasons\n\nAre just, and known; quit him of these, and\n\nthen\n\nNever liv'd gentleman of greater merit,\n\nHope or abiliment 1 to steer a kingdom.\n\nCrot. Fie, Orgilus!\n\nEuph. Fie, brother!\n\nCal. You have done it? 50\n\nBass. How it was done let him report, the\n\nforfeit\n\nOf whose allegiance to our laws doth covet\n\nRigour of justice; but that done it is,\n\nMine eyes have been an evidence of credit\n\nToo sure to be convinc'd. 2 Armostes, rent not\n\nThine arteries with hearing the bare circum-\n\nstances 56\n\nOf these calamities; thou 'st lost a nephew,\n\nA niece, and I a wife: continue man still;\n\nMake me the pattern of digesting evils\n\nWho can outlive my mighty ones, not shrink-\n\ning 60\n\nAt such a pressure as would sink a soul\n\nInto what's most of death, the worst of hor-\n\nrors.\n\nBut I have seal'd a covenant with sadness,\n\nAnd enter'd into bonds without condition,\n\nTo stand these tempests calmly; mark me,\n\nnobles, 65\n\nI do not shed a tear, not for Penthea!\n\nExcellent misery!\n\nCal. We begin our reign\n\nWith a first act of justice: thy confession,\n\nUnhappy Orgilus, dooms thee a sentence;\n\nBut yet thy father's or thy sister's presence 70\n\nShall be excus'd. — Give, Crotolon, a blessing\n\nTo thy lost son; — Euphranea, take a fare-\n\nwell; —\n\nAnd both be gone.\n\nCrot. [to ORGILUS.] Confirm thee, noble sor-\n\nrow\n\nIn worthy resolution!\n\nEuph. Could my tears speak,\n\nMy griefs were slight.\n\nOrg. All goodness dwell amongst ye! 75\n\nEnjoy my sister, Prophilus: my vengeance\n\nAim'd never at thy prejudice.\n\nCal. Now withdraw.\n\nExeunt CROTOLON, PROPHILUS, and EUPHRANEA.\n\nBloody relater of thy stains in blood,\n\nFor that thou hast reported him, whose for-\n\ntunes\n\nAnd life by thee are both at once snatch'd\n\nfrom him, 80\n\nWith honourable mention, make thy choice\n\nOf what death likes thee best; there's all our\n\nbounty. —\n\nBut to excuse delays, let me, dear cousin,\n\nIntreat you and these lords see execution\n\nInstant before ye part.\n\nNear. Your will commands us. 85\n\nOrg. One suit, just queen, my last : vouch-\n\nsafe your clemency,\n\nThat by no common hand I be divided\n\nFrom this my humble frailty.\n\nCal. To their wisdoms\n\nWho are to be spectators of thine end\n\nI make the reference. Those that are dead 90\n\nAre dead; had they not now died, of necessity\n\nThey must have paid the debt they ow'd to\n\nnature\n\nOne time or other. — Use dispatch, my lords;\n\nWe'll suddenly prepare our coronation.\n\nExeunt CALANTHA, PHILEMA, and\n\nCHRISTALLA.\n\n____________________\n\n1 Capacity. 2 Confuted.\n\n796\n\nArm. 'T is strange these tragedies should\n\nnever touch on 95\n\nHer female pity.\n\nBass. She has a masculine spirit;\n\nAnd wherefore should I pule, and, like a girl,\n\nPut finger in the eye? Let's be all toughness,\n\nWithout distinction betwixt sex and sex.\n\nNear. Now, Orgilus, thy choice?\n\nOrg. To bleed to death. 100\n\nArm. The executioner?\n\nOrg. Myself, no surgeon;\n\nI am well skill'd in letting blood. Bind fast\n\nThis arm, that so the pipes may from their con-\n\nduits\n\nConvey a full stream; here's a skilful instru-\n\nment. [Shows his dagger.]\n\nOnly I am a beggar to some charity 105\n\nTo speed me in this execution\n\nBy lending th' other prick to th' tother arm,\n\nWhen this is bubbling life out.\n\nBass. I am for ye;\n\nIt most concerns my art, my care, my credit. —\n\nQuick, fillet both his arms.\n\nOrg. Gramercy, friendship! 110\n\nSuch courtesies are real which flow cheerfully\n\nWithout an expectation of requital.\n\nReach me a staff in this hand.\n\n[They give him a staff.]\n\n— If a proneness\n\nOr custom in my nature from my cradle\n\nHad been inclin'd to fierce and eager blood-\n\nshed, 115\n\nA coward guilt, hid in a coward quaking,\n\nWould have betray'd fame to ignoble flight\n\nAnd vagabond pursuit of dreadful safety:\n\nBut look upon my steadiness, and scorn not\n\nThe sickness of my fortune, which, since Bass-\n\nanes 120\n\nWas husband to Penthea, had lain bed-rid.\n\nWe trifle time in words: — thus I show cunning\n\nIn opening of a vein too full, too lively.\n\n[Pierces the vein with his dagger.]\n\nArm. Desperate courage!\n\n[Near.] 1 Honourable infamy!\n\nHem. I tremble at the sight.\n\nGro. Would I were loose! 125\n\nBass. It sparkles like a lusty wine new\n\nbroacht;\n\nThe vessel must be sound from which it is-\n\nsues. —\n\nGrasp hard this other stick — I'll be as nim-\n\nble —\n\nBut prithee, look not pale — have at ye! stretch\n\nout\n\nThine arm with vigour and [with] 2 unshook vir-\n\ntue. [Opens the vein.]\n\nGood! O, I envy not a rival, fitted 131\n\nTo conquer in extremities. This pastime\n\nAppears majestical; some high-tun'd poem\n\nHereafter shall deliver to posterity\n\nThe writer's glory and his subject's triumph. 135\n\nHow is 't, man? Droop not yet.\n\nOrg. I feel no palsies.\n\nOn a pair-royal do I wait in death;\n\nMy sovereign, as his liegeman; on my mistress,\n\nAs a devoted servant; and on Ithocles,\n\nAs if no brave, yet no unworthy enemy. 140\n\nNor did I use an engine to entrap\n\nHis life, out of a slavish fear to combat\n\nYouth, strength, or cunning; 3 but for that I\n\ndurst not\n\nEngage the goodness of a cause on fortune,\n\nBy which his name might have outfac'd my\n\nvengeance"
