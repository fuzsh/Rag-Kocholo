        "text": "The Ford estate was recently sold to John McIlwee and his partner Bill Damaschke for $1.675 million, according to Realtor Nelda Linsk of HK Lane Real Estate.\n\n“You should never significantly alter something that has architectural integrity, “ McIlwee said. \"Don’t turn a mid-century marvel into a monstrosity it was never meant to be. We found a box of (architect) Welton Becket’s original plans in the garage. We intend to study them to find out what could have changed over the years. Before we make any decisions. It’s our intention that anything we do, we want people to believe it was, or could have been, original.”\n\nMcIlwee said he and his partner Damaschke, who is chief creative officer of DreamWorks Animation, does plan to do some updates to the interiors.\n\nBetty Ford passed away July 8, 2011 at the age of 93. President Ford died on Dec. 26, 2006, aslo at the age of 93.\n\nThe Ford compound served as the California retreat for President and Mrs. Ford after the Fords left the White House. There are five bedrooms, five full bathrooms, two partial bathrooms, his and hers offices.\n\nThe sale of Ford's \"official office,\" which was used as a command post for U.S. Secret Service agents on Sand Dune Road, is pending, according to Linsk."
