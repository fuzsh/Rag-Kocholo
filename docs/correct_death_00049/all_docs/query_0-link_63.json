We were not able to close the road down and had to wing it slightly at the end of the day, but “stolen” images are often the best.. . There are many constituent parts to this image and I am, as usual, reminded again, just how good our respective teams are when working under pressure.Not only is it 100 degrees outside; we are on a main road deep in the #Californiandesert and there are tourists swarming the area around Roy’s not quite believing their luck at seeing Cindy and yet we managed to pull this off. Just a fraction of a second, but that is all it takes.. . It was a 20-hour day that day, but one of the best we have had together and a huge amount of the credit goes to our production teams. It’s the small things like Cindy’s hair that make such a difference to this photograph and the forecourt of Roy’s is no studio, it’s a working gas station. I raise my glass to Cindy’s hair stylist - the legend that is #PeterSavic. I know working in an arid and sometimes windy desert is not his preferred environment, but he is a total professional.. . The perspective offered by a standard lens is pleasing to the human eye as that is what we are used to day in day out; the camera lens sees what we see. But there are challenges in this frame as I needed to include both her feet and the Roy’s sign and yet I could not afford for her face to be too far from the camera. Only a few angles were going to work and then we also had the props behind.. . But she knows exactly what she is doing and how to help me with my job. That’s why she is who she is.\" - David Yarrow \n\nShown: \nDavid Yarrow\nRoy's \"Cindy Crawford Series\", 2023\nphotograph\nStandard - 53\" x 52\" (framed)\nLarge - 72\" x 71\" (framed)\n\nContact gallery for pricing and availability at info@melissamorganfineart.com \n73660 El Paseo,Palm Desert, CA \n\n#PalmSpringsartscene #shopelpaseo #DiscoverPalmDesert #Visitgps #MeetmeonElPaseo  #contemporaryart #DavidYarrow #melissamorganfineart #artoftheday\".",
