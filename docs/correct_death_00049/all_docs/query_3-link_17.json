Please note that this profile is for John Ford, son of Goodman and Martha Ford who arrived on the Fortune in 1621, and not any of the following:\n\nJohn Ford (abt.1605-aft.1635) who was listed as a servant of John Kingman on the Mary Gould in 1635.\n\nJohn Ford (1659-1693) of Marshfield who died in 1693 and had a wife Hannah. (Some early authors believed the Ford families of Marshield and Plymouth were related).\n\nJohn Ford (bef.1675-bef.1722) of Morristown, New Jersey, son of James Ford (Andrew(1) of Weymouth). See NEHGR 119:112-115.\n\nBiography\n\nJohn Ford immigrated to New England as a child during the Puritan Great Migration (1621-1640).\n\nJohn Ford was born about 1617 in England. John came to Plymouth Colony with his parents at about four or five on the Fortune in 1621. John's father died shortly after their arrival, and is never mentioned by name in the records. His mother Martha remarried to Peter Browne, a passenger on the Mayflower,[1]\n\nJohn was first mentioned by name 22 May 1627 in the division of cattle. 13 November 1637, there is an item listed in William Palmer's inventory, \"due from John Ford\" and 2 November 1640 John \"Foard\" was granted \"30 acres and and some meadow at North River.\" It is noted that the land grants were not immediately laid out, and Barclay concludes that its likely he died before they were taken up. The final reference to John is 5 January 1640/1, is a settlement between him and Jonathan Brewster over the corn crop at the Ferry upon North River.\n\nJohn is not listed among the men able to bear arms in 1643, Based on his age, if he were residing in Plymouth at that time, he would have been included in that list. This suggests that he died or left Plymouth Colony between January 5, 1640/1, and 1643.\n\nResearch notes\n\n28 Sep 1676 death date is suspiciously close to William Ford Sr (abt.1604-1676) death date 23 September 1676, I could find no record in Plymouth that for a John Ford died 28 Sep 1676 Cole-12288 18:22, 25 December 2020 (UTC)\n\nSources\n\n↑ Anderson, Robert Charles; George F.
