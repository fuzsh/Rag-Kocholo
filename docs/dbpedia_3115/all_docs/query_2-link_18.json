The National Board for Wildlife approved Elephant as a National heritage animal of India then Why Animal Welfare Board of India - AWBI not coming forward to declare OXEN - Cow's as a national heritage domestic animal of India, to protect them from slaughtering. \nThe Ministry of Environment and Forest banned Bull, tiger, panther, lion, monkey and bear as performing animals, where as Bullock cart races and Monkey performances are still going, where as PFA Haryana founder Naresh Kadyan played a key role in performing bear rescue, introducing scheme for rehabilitation of kalanders during 1998-99.
