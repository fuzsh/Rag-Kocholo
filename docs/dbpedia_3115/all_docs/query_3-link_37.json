I had a lovely time at the Celebration Banquet on Friday night and Saturday brought a wonderful Awards Luncheon that recognized some extraordinary people. It was a great surprise to meet Montyne Connolly whose parents and grandparents owned The Little White Chapel where Jack and I were married over 40 years ago. A special thank you to Taylor Goodwin and Deborah Striker for providing my transportation and Meaghan Daniel for being my Page. Thank you, Nevada Daughters!\n\n-Pamela Wright, President General\n\nThe Battle Born State held its 99th State Conference in Las Vegas, Nevada. Daughters and guests came together to celebrate the accomplishments of the chapters and state society. Nevada Daughters sparkled as they celebrated historic preservation, education and patriotism.\n\nOpening day of state conference, members and guest heard reports from the state officers and chapter regents. Our President General, Pamela Edwards Rouse Wright, spoke on friendship and cooperation at Friday night’s Celebration Banquet, which also saw the announcement of the 2024 Nevada Outstanding Junior, Taylor Goodwin, of the Helen J. Stewart Chapter.\n\nSaturday brought wonderful reports from the state chairs, along with an Awards Luncheon. Awards were presented for Outstanding DAR Service for Veterans, DAR Good Citizen, Junior American Citizens, the Hannah White Arnett Award, Outstanding Information Specialist, Chapter Achievement, Patriot Records Project, Membership, Women’s Issues Essay and the chapters who have received 100% participation in the President General’s Project. Donations were also given to the Las Vegas Fisher House and the Amargosa Valley School.\n\nThe North Las Vegas Fire Department’s Community Outreach Officer accepted 19 stuffed animals from the Children of the American Revolution. These will be used as trauma case comfort items for minors involved in any type of trauma call.\n\nSaturday night was all about celebrating the past and future of Nevada DAR. We celebrated over twenty graduates from the DAR Leadership Courses, along with the installation of our newly elected State Officers.\n\nPages from across the state and country came, setting a record for the number of Pages attending the Nevada State Conference. Also, for the first time ever, Nevada Daughters welcomed Convention Photography and the DAR Insignia Pop-Up Shop.\n\nSunday morning came early as the Junior and Page Club held their annual breakfast and meeting. New club officers were elected and installed. Next was the Memorial service for those Nevada Daughters who have passed in the last year.\n\nAs the gavel rapped for the last time and the final chapter comes to a close on this administration, Nevada daughters have “Let their Service, Friendship and Patriotism Ring Out.”\n\nKeep the Sparkle shining bright on Nevada DAR!"
