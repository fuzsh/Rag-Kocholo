        "text": "Peter Jan Rens as Mister Kaktus\n\n– reposted article from April 9, 2011 –\n\nIn Thailand an estimated 9.000 Dutch people live there. A not inconsiderable number.\n\nThis group of Dutch people is rather mixed. From young to old. From expats to pensioners and from business people to fortune seekers. Even fugitive Dutch criminals sought refuge in Thailand. The most famous of these are Joran van der Sloot and John Mieremet, who was liquidated in Thailand in 2005 at the age of 45.\n\nThere's another group. An admittedly small group, which I call well-known Dutch people for the sake of convenience. They can be artists, such as musicians or people we know from TV. Sometimes they are Dutch people whose star status is fading. They once had a hit and then fell into oblivion. Still, it is nice to read that they have found their happiness in Thailand. In a number of cases, people ended up in Thailand because of…. Correct! A Thai beauty.\n\nI did some Googling but it didn't turn up much. That is why I also need the help of the visitors of Thailandblog. Do you know the name of a famous Dutch person and preferably also where in Thailand he or she lives? Then I would like to hear that. Reply to this post and we might have a nice list soon. Not that it matters, but it's funny nonetheless.\n\nI'll bite the bullet:\n\nPeter-Jan Rens (Velsen-Noord, October 10, 1950) is a Dutch presenter, actor, writer and former physiotherapist. In 1983 he played the leading role in the film Burning Love, based on the book by Jan Wolkers. Rens performed weekly as Mister Kaktus in the television program Tineke.\n\nHans de Booij (Arnhem, June 2, 1958) is a Dutch singer and songwriter. Hans scored a number of hits in the eighties, of which Annabel was the biggest. The singer has been living on the Thai island of Koh Phangan since 2008.\n\nHans Vermeulen (Voorburg, September 18, 1947) is a Dutch singer, composer, producer, guitarist and keyboardist. Vermeulen started in 1961 with the band Sandy Coast, with which he scored well-known hits such as I see your face again, True love that's a wonder, Just a friend, Capital Punishment and Summertrain. In the early 80s, Sandy Coast made a comeback, scoring another hit with The eyes of Jenny after 8 years. In the 90s, Vermeulen's career went downhill and he emigrated to Thailand. He remarried Thai singer Jariya Chatsuwan, known as Aom. Hans lives in Mae Nam on the island of Koh Samui and has his own website: HansVermeulen.nl\n\nJon Hauser, a Dutch journalist, publicist, author of children's books and Thailand connoisseur, lives in Chiang Mai.\n\nFamous Belgians\n\nRene Desaeyere, is the coach of Chiangmai FC.\n\nTars Lootens, contributor to children's programs of the VRT.\n\nLou Deprijck, producer Singer Composer of Two Man Sound&Lou &Hollywood Bananas Producer of Vaya Con Dios &Viktor Laslo living in Pattaya and still performs regularly for the Belgian Embassy, ​​among others.\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nNumber of times read: 687\n\nLeave a comment"
