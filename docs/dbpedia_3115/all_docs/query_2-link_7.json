In just over a decade he created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most of which date from the last two years of his life. They include landscapes, still lifes, portraits and self-portraits, and are characterised by bold colours and dramatic, impulsive and expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art. He was not commercially successful, and his suicide at 37 came after years of mental illness and poverty. Born into an upper-middle-class family, Van Gogh drew as a child and was serious, quiet and thoughtful. As a young man he worked as an art dealer, often travelling, but became depressed after he was transferred to London. He turned to religion and spent time as a Protestant missionary in southern Belgium. He drifted in ill health and solitude before taking up painting in 1881, having moved back home with his parents. His younger brother Theo supported him financially, and the two kept up a long correspondence by letter. His early works, mostly still lifes and depictions of peasant labourers, contain few signs of the vivid colour that distinguished his later work. In 1886, he moved to Paris, where he met members of the avant-garde, including Émile Bernard and Paul Gauguin, who were reacting against the Impressionist sensibility. As his work developed he created a new approach to still lifes and local landscapes. His paintings grew brighter in colour as he developed a style that became fully realised during his stay in Arles in the south of France in 1888. During this period he broadened his subject matter to include series of olive trees, wheat fields and sunflowers. Van Gogh suffered from psychotic episodes and delusions and though he worried about his mental stability, he often neglected his physical health, did not eat properly and drank heavily. His friendship with Gauguin ended after a confrontation with a razor when, in a rage, he severed part of his own left ear. He spent time in psychiatric hospitals, including a period at Saint-Rémy. After he discharged himself and moved to the Auberge Ravoux in Auvers-sur-Oise near Paris, he came under the care of the homeopathic doctor Paul Gachet. His depression continued and on 27 July 1890, Van Gogh shot himself in the chest with a Lefaucheux revolver. He died from his injuries two days later. Van Gogh was unsuccessful during his lifetime, and was considered a madman and a failure. He became famous after his suicide, and exists in the public imagination as the quintessential misunderstood genius, the artist \"where discourses on madness and creativity converge\". His reputation began to grow in the early 20th century as elements of his painting style came to be incorporated by the Fauves and German Expressionists. He attained widespread critical, commercial and popular success over the ensuing decades, and is remembered as an important but tragic painter, whose troubled personality typifies the romantic ideal of the tortured artist. Today, Van Gogh's works are among the world's most expensive paintings to have ever sold at auction, and his legacy is honoured by a museum in his name, the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, which holds the world's largest collection of his paintings and drawings.\n\nThe Garden of Earthly Delights, The Seven Deadly Sins and the Four Last Things, Allegory of Gluttony and Lust\n\nBirthplace : 's-Hertogenbosch, Netherlands\n\nAssociated periods or movements : Renaissance\n\nNationality : Netherlands\n\nArt Forms : Painting, Drawing\n\nHieronymus Bosch (UK: , US: , Dutch: [ɦijeːˈroːnimʏz ˈbɔs] (listen); born Jheronimus van Aken [jeːˈroːnimʏs fɑn ˈaːkə(n)]; c. 1450 – 9 August 1516) was a Dutch/Netherlandish painter and draughtsman from Brabant. He is one of the most notable representatives of the Early Netherlandish painting school. His work contains fantastic illustrations of religious concepts and narratives. Within his lifetime his work was collected in the Netherlands, Austria, and Spain, and widely copied, especially his macabre and nightmarish depictions of hell. Little is known of Bosch's life, though there are some records. He spent most of it in the town of 's-Hertogenbosch, where he was born in his grandfather's house. The roots of his forefathers are in Nijmegen and Aachen (which is visible in his surname: Van Aken). His pessimistic and fantastical style cast a wide influence on northern art of the 16th century, with Pieter Bruegel the Elder being his best-known follower. Today he is seen as a hugely individualistic painter with deep insight into humanity's desires and deepest fears. Attribution has been especially difficult; today only about twenty-five paintings are confidently given to his hand along with eight drawings. Approximately another half dozen paintings are confidently attributed to his workshop. His most acclaimed works consist of a few triptych altarpieces, including The Garden of Earthly Delights.\n\nAdriaan de Lelie\n\nThe Art Gallery of Jan Gildemeester, Mother and Two Children with Still Life\n\nBirthplace : Kingdom of the Netherlands\n\nNationality : Netherlands\n\nArt Forms : Painting\n\nAdriaan de Lelie (1755-1820) was a Dutch painter. Lelie was the teacher of Dutch portraitist and lithographer Jean Augustin Daiwaille (1786-1850) and Dutch painter Pieter Recco (1765-1820).\n\nDirk Langendijk (Rotterdam, 8 March 1748 – Rotterdam, 15 December 1805), written as Langendyk in his day, was a Dutch draughtsman, painter and etcher. He produced mainly depictions of land and sea battles and other military scenes from the Dutch Patriottentijd (circa 1780–1800) and the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars (from 1792).\n\nJumping Fox with Green Virgin, Flying Fish, En attendent nous\n\nBirthplace : Amsterdam, Netherlands\n\nAssociated periods or movements : COBRA\n\nNationality : Netherlands\n\nArt Forms : Sculpture, Painting\n\nChristiaan Karel Appel (pronounced [ˈkrɪstijaːn ˈkaːrəl ˈɑpəl] (listen); 25 April 1921 – 3 May 2006) was a Dutch painter, sculptor, and poet. He started painting at the age of fourteen and studied at the Rijksakademie in Amsterdam in the 1940s. He was one of the founders of the avant-garde movement Cobra in 1948. He was also an avid sculptor and has had works featured in MoMA and other museums worldwide.\n\nAdriaen Backer\n\nAnatomy Lesson by Dr. F. Ruysch\n\nBirthplace : Amsterdam, Netherlands\n\nAssociated periods or movements : Baroque\n\nNationality : Netherlands\n\nArt Forms : Painting\n\nAdriaen Backer (ca 1635, Amsterdam — buried 23 May 1684, Amsterdam) was a Dutch Golden Age portrait painter, active in Amsterdam and Haarlem."
