The last 15 years of his professional career he leaded Dröger Medical Systems in Benelux, France and Sub-Sahara Africa. In all senior management positions he used the Kgotla principles to transform organisations to profitable growth.\n\nLekgotla is an African word for a meeting circle and tribal management, on which this title is based, is founded on the African concept of Ubuntu meaning ‘I am because we exist’. In Lekgotla author Willem H.J. De Liefde champions the idea of the company as tribe. Inspired by the artwork of Jan Montyn , Willem developed the Universal Life Cycle analysis tool.\n\nKlaus Elle\n\nPicture: Klaus Elle (l) during a Kgotla Day\n\nArtist and philosopher Klaus Elle was born in Leipzig, East Germany. He has worked as a professional artist for over 30 years and regularly collaborates with professors working on international sustainable programs at MIT Boston, the University of Tokyo and ETH Zürich. He plays a key role in our Lekgotla processes, helping to facilitate all kinds of dialogues thanks to his unconventional views and contagious imaginative skills. His input enables people to see how they may adopt a holistic approach. Using art he helps participants of our kgotla sessions access the wisdom they hold inside themselves by helping them become aware of the role their conscious and unconscious, and rational and emotional, processes play in their approach to decision-taking, change or their lives and work in general.\n\nThis book is a meeting of souls from Africa and Europe “ in an attempt to find common ground. It is written for family, friends, colleagues known and unknown, for those who find themselves at the crossroads of their lives, or their careers, and for those who are searching and yearning for a source of change. It is for those who are willing to dig deeper, to look beyond the surface of things. It is an invitation to all to learn from a lekgotla a continuing journey into the future, one driven by caring and commitment to common groundDr. Maki Mandela on Willem de Liefde's book 'Kgotla, leadership through dialogue'"
