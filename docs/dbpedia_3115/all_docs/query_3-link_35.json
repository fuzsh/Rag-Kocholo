        "text": "Robin was born and raised in Raton, New Mexico, and grew up in the New Mexico 4-H program taking many projects with the top three being in Sewing, Baking and Leadership. From a young age, Robin learned about the interesting experiences of the local Cooperative Extension Agents, plus their role in the County Fair. Fair time was always a family affair at the Mack house. Although the Colfax County Fair was small, that never stopped Robin or her brother exhibiting multiple entries or attending workdays because her mother was a Club and Project Leader, plus a member of the Fair Board. As a Senior 4-H member she was selected to be a State 4-H Diplomat on the New Mexico 4-H Leadership Team. As a member of the Leadership Team, Robin acquired many lifetime friends as well as working with several extension agents and looked upon them as mentors. It is these mentors that helped Robin choose her future career path.\n\nIn the Fall of 1991 Robin started college at New Mexico State University where she majored in Home Economics Education. Throughout college, she worked in the State 4-H Office where she had the opportunity to learn more about the Cooperative Extension Service, and this definitely fueled the fire for her becoming a Home Economist/4-H Agent. Upon graduation from college, Robin took her first extension job as the Home Economist/4-H Agent in Luna County. Robin loved working with the Homemakers and 4-H youth by encouraging leadership and home economics with all she taught through her programs.\n\nRobin moved to Lea County in the Fall of 1998 and by Spring she had a job with the Lea County Extension office. Robin worked with the Nutrition Educators on the SNAP-Ed Grant, teaching many youth and adult nutrition education through games and cooking demonstrations. In the Spring of 2002, Robin had earned her Master’s Degree from NMSU and moved into the County Extension Home Economist position. Robin worked with the other agents to promote extension programs in Diabetes Cooking, Childcare Education, Sewing/Quilting/Crafts, Parenting Education, plus many, many other topics. The Homemaker Club members were always anxious to learn and attend the meetings Robin would have on a new topic and workshop. The highlight of the summer was always doing sewing, baking and canning workshops for 4-H members who were getting their projects ready for the county fair.\n\nRobin’s first Lea County Fair was in 1999 when she stepped in to help out as a volunteer. Each year you would find Robin in the Yucca Building with numerous volunteers taking entries and creating displays for the public to enjoy. Robin always thought it was a wonderful feeling to walk into the Yucca Building and see all the exhibits displayed, the quilts hanging, and blue ribbons everywhere, not to mention seeing and hearing the smiles and excitement of everyone seeing how their items placed.\n\nOver the years, Robin passed down her love of entering items in the County Fair to her daughter, Madison. Madison began entering items when she was old enough and even branched out into the Horse Barn for most of her 4-H career. One of the funniest County Fair memories remembered was the year, Robin and her husband, Darrel, entered pickles in the County Fair. Darrel won Reserve Grand Champion on his pickles and Robin came away with 2nd place. He still brings that up during canning season.\n\nRobin retired at the end of 2022 as the County Home Economist after 26 years with the NMSU Extension Service. The Lea County Fair has always been a place you could go and see and visit with everyone from across the county; and Robin will always continue to enjoy visiting with all the friends she made along her way, the many memories, and swapping old stories during the Lea County Fair. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for giving me this opportunity.\n\nIt is certainly an honor to have the 88th Lea County Fair and Rodeo dedicated in my honor as well as my family. The Lea County Fair has been and will continue to be a highlight for me and my family.\n\nI became a part of the county fair in 1984 as an exhibitor of market steers and market lambs. I exhibited livestock at the county show up to 1990.After finishing my show career, I became a volunteer assisting other young members with their show projects at both the county and state level.\n\nAfter graduation from Hobbs High School, I went to Clarendon College in the panhandle of Texas where I was a member the collegiate livestock judging team for two years. While at Clarendon College, I received my Associate Degree of Science and transferred to New Mexico State University. After some years at NMSU, I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Agricultural Education and Extension in 1993 and a Master of Science in Agricultural Education and Extension in 1996.\n\nDuring my time at NMSU as a graduate student, I found the love of my life and my best friend. Montyne and I exchanged vows on January 7th, 1995. At that time, I was teaching High School Agriculture in Socorro, NM. We spent the spring semester in Socorro before I returned home to teach Agriculture at New Mexico Junior College from the fall of 1995 until December 2004. Subsequently, I joined New Mexico State University in January 2005, where I served as the Lea County Extension Agriculture and 4-H Agent until my retirement in the summer of 2020.\n\nBefore assuming the role of Extension Agent, I dedicated three years of service as a member of the Fair board, spanning from 2002 to 2004. Upon stepping into the position of Agent, I continued my involvement by serving as the livestock superintendent from 2005 to 2019. It was truly gratifying to contribute to the development and support of the youth of Lea County in this capacity.\n\nI am most proud of my wife and family. My wife has been the rock that I have needed throughout my career. She has been a constant source of strength, standing by me as I dedicated myself to my work in agriculture and youth training. And, she has been and will always be the glue that kept our family growing and strong. We are the proud parents of Tyler and Tanner Cox. Both exhibited livestock at the Lea County Fair from 2008-2015. Both sons have since graduated from Tarleton State University with degrees in agriculture, a testament to their dedication and hard work. Montyne and I couldn't be prouder of our boys. In May of this year, Montyne and I are proud to add a daughter-in-law, Mattie, to our family, and we eagerly anticipate welcoming Sadie as our next daughter-in-law in March of next year. Our family is my greatest source of joy in my life.\n\nI would like to thank the Lea County Fair and Rodeo for bestowing this honor upon me and my family. Thanks again!"
