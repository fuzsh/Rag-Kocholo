The document is a letter addressed to various Indian government officials requesting protections for oxen. It summarizes that oxen are used for farming work but sometimes slaughtered for meat when they get old or injured. It demands that oxen be declared a national heritage animal in India to protect them from slaughter, equal funding for oxen rescue and rehabilitation, and restrictions on exporting oxen between states to prevent slaughter. The letter is signed by over 100 people supporting stronger oxen protections in India.",
