Will Hulld One In The Summer It la Hinted that Ills Newly Wedded Wife, Who In Said to be Worth tao,000,WI!l Furnish Mis Capital. What Local Men Think. A few weeks ago the Times re ported the marriage of Simon Fried bcrgcr.tho treasure and Pooh Bah of the late Delaware Valley Electric Railway, to Miss Lazarus, of New York city. , It has since been learned that tho wife of tho blond bearded Simon is possessed of great wealth, as much as f 150.000, With this large amount of capital it is said that Friedberger proposes to build tho East Stroudsburg and Matamoras Railroad, for which he possesses tho charter. The dnpiier Simon chums to have closed a deal with a reputable firm of railroad contractors to build the steam railrod as soon as the flowers bloom in the spring, and it has been hinted that the money, with which the road will be built, will be f urn- ished by the lady who he has recently married in New York city. Application will be made for right of way through East Stroudsburg very shortly and then all things will bo complete, as a steam railroad charter' gives the right to the part ios to go ahead and pre-empt lands and condom the property. It will be remember that Messrs. Arbogast and Carrick ran out tho lino for the railroad last summer. A reporter interviewed several of those interested in the Delaware Valloy Railway each one character izing Friedberger 's statement as ono grand bluff. An execution has boen issued against the East Stroudsburg and Matamoras road for $138 and over for labor claims. Mitchol Palmer, Esq., was recently in Philadelphia to Borve the papers on the ex-trea surer but he was out of town. If tho claims are not paid in a von time the road will bo sold at auction and the charter forfeited This will, of course, end any further interference on Friedborger's part. Tho whole matter looks as if Friod- borircr has a somewhat dog in the manger feeling about the matter, lie was unable to build the road himself and hates to see others stop in and accomplish what he could not do.

Free Distribution of Seeds Discon tinued. Scores the Secretary of Arlrtilnrt Sy He Raises I'lante Cleveland's Bouquets. Cats oft the Pobr Farmers' Seeds and Is a Gold Bag. We lost week mentioned the fact that Secretary of Agriculture Morton had discontinued the free distribu tion of seeds, and now this is wliat Senator Vest thinks of that worthy. He said the technical construction of the law by the Secretary was a mere sham to cover up his personal op position to this particular law which had stood for years, and had been executed with incalculable value to the whole country. It was an effort to discredit those in Congress who distribuuted seeds. The Democra tic party has been most unfortunate not only as to its internal discords but also in the fact that the devil has owed it a grudge and paid it in a Secretary of Agriculture. The Secretary has put the Demo- cratio party in antagonism to the great agricultural interests of the party, although that party had al ways stood as the close friend of ag riculture. Why did not this secre tary turn his search light on the sale of bonds to a foreign syndicate? Why did he not investigate tho pro fligacy of public printing. The gi gantic intellect of this Secretary of Agricult ure has daily gone outside of his legitimate duties and why did it not discover some of the really flagrant abuses?\" \"This Secretary, \" assumed to run the entire Goverment. He baa been practically the Secretary of the Trea sury, flooding this country with re ports and pamphlots.denouncing the silver lunatics and upholding the single gold standard. Here was this Secretary, declared Mr. Vest, \"cultivating orchids and lilies of the valley and palms to grace the banquets and receptions of the President in this city, but when we give a few seeds to some poor farmer this Secretary springs to arms and liberty lies bleeding in the street. \" As for himsolf , he would rather send seed to some struggling farmer of the West or put one flower in the sick room of some poor girl, than to decorate the banquets where the chandeliers flashed its light across the red wine. \" Why should the colossal capa city of this Secretary of Agriculture be restricted to cabbages?\" ex claimed Mr. Vest. There was much amusement through the chamber and in the galleries as the Senator compared the Secretory with classic heroes. Like the war horse of Job, his neck is clothed with the thun ders, and he sayeth amoung the trumpets, \"Ha, ha? \" \"The trouble is,\" said Mr. Vest, \" that the Secretary of Agriculture is a monomaniac on the gold stand ard. He sees only gold, gold, red gold, and he thinks any man who does not see as he sees is a lunatic.\" Mr. Vest closed shortly after 2 o'clock with a remarkably sarcastic and bitter peroration. He refered to the useless seeds, \"which it was as sorted the Secretary had properly refused to buy. But, added the Sena tor, there was one seed not men tioned. It was, \" he proceeded, smiling maliciously, the aurifer feniculum canis Mortonae, or in plainer words, Morton's golden dogweed. This would flournish while this Socretary swinging his golden censor at the Executive Mansion shouted, \"Holy holy art thou, oh Grover, king of kings and lord of lords. , Vivisection (t Cornell.

This is suspended over the object to be photographed which is placed on what is called the plate.
