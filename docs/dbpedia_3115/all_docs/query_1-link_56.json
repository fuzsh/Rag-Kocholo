        "text": "June Newton partner of photographer Helmut Newton dies at 97. RIP 10-04-2021\n\nUnder the pseudonym Alice Springs, June Newton earned her spurs in the seventies and eighties as a portrait photographer of the greats of the earth. Artists, politicians, royalty, she got everyone in front of her lens. “And the funny thing is, I’ve never been to Alice Springs,” she says. “In 1970 I started to publish my photos and asked Helmut under what name I wanted to work. We took an atlas and opened it on my native Australia. I closed my eyes and poked somewhere on the map with a needle. He stuck in the middle of the continent, on the town of Alice Springs. “That is your name,” said Helmut. “\n\nFor this portrait of John Irving, we met at an Amsterdam five-star hotel located on the canals. I brought with me a portable light studio and a white backdrop. John proved to be a very cooperative and talented model. From the images, I shot all pictures were very good and this image was used for the HP/de Tijd magazine. Sometime after the first publication, six portraits of John were used for six paperback dutch cover picture versions of his popular books.\n\nIK JAN CREMER\n\nJan Cremer is a legendary artist from Holland. He wrote a bestseller book in 1964 that was self titled, I JAN CREMER. During his long career he published a string of books and his art painting is widely collected around the world. For this image we recreated his famous 1964 book cover with a brand new Harley Davidson this time. This image is an out take from that session for a car magazine, in color. I like this version because of the depth perspective, the moodiness and his relaxed manner of posing.\n\nMarion Bloem\n\nPeter Post\n\nOf Course I knew about Peter Post and was invited to his villa on the outskirts of Amsterdam for Esquire magazine. I also knew he was like me the son of an Amsterdam butcher. In the old days I was told, cyclists had to put a tender piece of meat inside their cycle shorts to protect their behinds. So, I brought him a good juicy and bloody steak and did some pictures with that. Blood running from his hands. For those people who know a thing or two about the hard life of a professional cyclist understand the connection was clear. But even without the bloody steak, you can see the scars and stitches in Peter Post’s worn but still good-looking face.\n\nJan Montyn\n\nI met Jan Montyn for the first time prior to a magazine photoshoot 20 years ago. I was not so much aware of his incredible life story then. This time we had a much more personal connection but Jan was facing health issues and did not live much longer. I personally like the introspective character of this portrait of a man who witnessed hardship and wars and came out of that incredible life of war and conflict to be a great etching and writing artist.\n\nThom Hoffman\n\nDuring the late 1980s early 1996 I was full time working for many glossy magazines. This portrait of Thom Hoffman was made for RAILS, an inflight magazine for the Dutch railways.\n\nI used the romantic travel aspects into this image. Thom Hoffman dressed in a nice trench coat, reminding us of Humphrey Bogart. His reflection in the window worked perfectly with his casted film roles. Playing a handsome but somewhat conflicted character in his latest movie, The Fourth Man, a psycho thriller.\n\nBernardo Bertolucci\n\nAt the time of my meeting with Bernardo, he was working on the Sheltering Sky movie. One of all time favorite movies and book by Paul Bowles. This somewhat introspective portrait was shot in a very small production office in London, using a film spotlight and my trusty Hasselblad camera.\n\nRoman Polanski\n\nI was able to have a private portrait sitting with Polanski in the Pulitzer hotel Amsterdam. The bronze statue of the young female in the background refers to his personal life regarding relationships with women.\n\nPeter Klashorst\n\nPeter Klashorst is after 60 years of making art a 100% certified “art barbarian” and one of the last art Mohicans. He was at a very young age confident enough to sell his first paintings and never stopped. We met before in the late 90s for a magazine picture in Amsterdam and we had immediately a good interaction and fun. We met again in Cambodia late 2010 for to cover his art latest show about the killed Khmer Rouge victims that he photographed at the Tuol Sleng torture museum in Phnom Penh and then he recreated their images on life-size intense painted canvases. I wrote the six-page feature article and images for this article published in HP/de Tijd magazine. After that, we did many more articles and newspaper stories. https://michaelklinkhamer.blogspot.com/2011/05/peter-klashorst-in-phnom-phen-cambodja.html"
