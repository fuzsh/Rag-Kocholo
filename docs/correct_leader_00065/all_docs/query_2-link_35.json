        "text": "TOKYO -- Revelers in Myanmar celebrate the traditional New Year in mid-April by splashing water on each other to cool off and cleanse themselves of the sins of the old year. But the festive mood seemed subdued this year, overshadowed by the enforcement of a conscription law by the military regime under the leadership of Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing.\n\nOn Feb. 10, the regime abruptly put into effect the People's Military Service Law, which was enacted in 2010 but had been shelved in the country's transition to civilian rule. The draft applies to men ages 18 to 35 for now. The military says there are just over 6 million men in that age bracket, and it will call up 5,000 people per month for a total of 60,000 a year."
