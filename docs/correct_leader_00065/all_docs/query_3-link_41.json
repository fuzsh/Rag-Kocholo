        "text": "Thein Sein was sworn into office in March 2011, officially launching a nominally civilian government to replace almost 50 years of military rule.\n\nHe had been hand-picked by Senior General Than Shwe, the country's paramount leader since 1992, to succeed him as Myanmar's head of state.\n\nThe military-led State Peace and Development Council was dissolved, although the new cabinet included several ex-military men, many of whom were ministers in the junta.\n\nMr Thein Sein, who held the rank of general and was prime minister in the previous administration, competed in parliamentary elections in November 2010.\n\nThe elections were marred by the absence of the National League for Democracy party which won the previous election of 1990 by a landslide and which is led by Aung San Suu Kyi, who was under house arrest at the time of the election. The NLD opted to boycott the vote.\n\nMr Thein Sein had long been seen as the relatively untainted face of the military government, and it is thought that Senior General Than Shwe regarded him as the most suitable frontman for Myanmar's democratic transition.\n\nHe is generally considered to be a reformer, and since he became president, there have been undeniable moves towards political liberalisation."
