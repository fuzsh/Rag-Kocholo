We support clients in all areas of the manufacturing, infrastructure (real estate, logistics, construction, telecommunications, energy), financial, commercial, and service industries (IT, healthcare, and others).\n\nWe have also been involved in a number of public activities, including legal system surveys, provision of legal aid, and lobbying support activities at the request of the Japanese government, and have been taking advantage of countless opportunities to share our knowledge of Myanmar's legal system gained through our activities in the country via various publications, seminars, and other activities.\n\nOur Yangon office will continue to support companies in Myanmar, which are facing increasing difficulties in navigating their way through the country's various challenges, by providing problem-solving support based on our wealth of experience and local practices."
