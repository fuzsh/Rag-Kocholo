        "text": "Habitat for Humanity in Myanmar\n\nHabitat for Humanity’s involvement in Myanmar arose after the devastating Cyclone Nargis struck on May 2, 2008. Together with its partner World Concern, Habitat for Humanity built and repaired more than 1,700 core houses in the worst-hit Ayeyarwady delta as part of World Concern’s integrated multi- sector disaster recovery program. In January 2014, Habitat for Humanity began projects in water and sanitation with disaster risk reduction with World Concern.\n\nThe housing need in Myanmar\n\nAt least 1 million people in Myanmar are in need of humanitarian assistance including shelter due to armed conflict, vulnerability to natural hazards or intercommunal violence, according to the United Nations. According to the last population and housing census of 2014 showed that close to 81% of housing units in Myanmar were not durable, about 28% of households obtained their drinking water from unsafe sources, and nearly 14% did not have a toilet.\n\nHabitat for Humanity started working through partners in Myanmar after the devastating Cyclone Nargis in 2008. The office in Yangon opened in 2014 and direct project implementation began in 2016.\n\nHow Habitat addresses the need in Myanmar\n\nBuilding resilience\n\nIn Myanmar, Habitat for Humanity builds community resilience against climate change and the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the coup through development and humanitarian interventions. We partner with village, ward and school committees to promote empowered participation.\n\nHabitat Myanmar’s key interventions include green and sustainable initiatives such as rainwater harvesting, home gardening, and resilient water and sanitation infrastructures. Habitat also provides humanitarian assistance to the vulnerable through distributing drinking water during the hot summer season, multipurpose cash assistance to meet basic household needs as well as livelihood support.\n\nEmpowering communities"
