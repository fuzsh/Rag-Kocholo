        "text": "Mr Webb, a Democrat from Virginia who chairs a senate sub-committee on East Asian and Pacific affairs, announced his two week tour of the region earlier this month, before the Burmese democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi was sentenced to 18 months house arrest but when the outcome of her internationally condemned trial was already widely anticipated.\n\nMrs Suu Kyi, who has spent 14 of the last 20 years in detention, was convicted on Tuesday on charges of breaking the terms of her previous house arrest. The trial was seen by observers as a pretext to keep her locked away during elections planned next year.\n\nThe European Union on Thursday imposed a travel ban and asset-freezing sanctions on the Burmese judges who ruled against Mrs Suu Kyi.\n\nThe Burmese dictator Than Shwe, who has ruled since 1992, is believed to have met only one American official since taking power â€“ a humanitarian administrator who delivered aid following the devastating cyclone that struck the country in 2008.\n\nEarlier this year a senior US State Department official visited the Burmese capital Naypidaw as part of a policy review undertaken by the incoming Obama administration but did not meet the senior general. No US congressman has visited Burma in over a decade.\n\n\"It is vitally important that the United States re-engage with Southeast Asia at all levels,\" Senator Webb said today after arriving in Vientiane, the capital of neighbouring Laos.\n\nHis office earlier said that the Vietnam veteran intends \"to explore opportunities to advance U.S. interests in Burma (Myanmar) and the region\" during his two week, five nation tour."
