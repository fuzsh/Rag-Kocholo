It is the administrative center for Myanmar's Ayeyarwady Division, and with a population of 150,000, the nation's fourth-largest city. I wanted to go there partly because I have been to Myanmar's three other major cities  Yangon, Mandalay and Mawlamyine  and partly because it receives relatively few visitors from the outside world and so I thought it would provide me with an unblemished glimpse of what provincial Myanmar life is really like. As the crow flies, Pathein is only 150 km east of Yangon, but the road is narrow and pot-holed, and at this time of year, its woeful condition is exacerbated by the monsoon rains. The drive took a bone-jarring five and a half hours.\n\nINTERACTIVE Talk back to Asiaweek's correspondents on our message boards\n\nAfter I had checked into the Pathein Hotel ($25, single air-con room with breakfast) and freshened up, I strolled over to the club house of the adjacent Ayeyarwady Golf Club. A couple of tables were occupied in the main room where some members were having a snack and drinking beer. High up on the wooden walls were honors boards marking the names of competition winners and club captains and other office holders. I was intrigued at the preponderance of military names. In 1984, for instance, the Captain's Cup was won by Brig.-Gen. Than Shwe, then the southwest regional commander based in Pathein, and now  as Senior General  the nation's supreme leader. The winner in 1998 was Brig.-Gen. Shwe Mann, the current regional commander, who is widely tipped to follow the Than Shwe trajectory. Other names included Than Shwe's predecessor as head of the junta, Gen. Saw Maung, and the current deputy prime minister, Maj.-Gen. Tin Hla.\n\nAbsent from the honors boards were the names of Nyunt Hlaing, Hla Kyi, Tin Chaw and Kyaw Min. Ten years ago, on May 27, 1990, these four Pathein citizens, all members of the National League for Democracy, were elected by the people of their city to represent them in parliament. But, like the other 388 victorious NLD members, they were not allowed to take their seats. As I sat in the Pathein golf club, I read over my notes about this quartet. Of Nyunt Hlaing, now 55, I had little information. He had won a scholarship to study in the old Soviet Union, and after returning to Myanmar, he had obtained a Master's degree in \"Fishery\"  understandable, perhaps, coming from this river town. He had worked at Mandalay University before becoming involved in politics via his trade union activities (which had led to his arrest in 1988 and his subsequent forced retirement a year later). I think it fair to say without fear of contradiction that Nyunt Hlaing's name will never go up on one of the honors boards at the Pathein golf club.\n\nTen days before I ventured into the Ayeyarwady, I had paid a one-day visit to Mandalay  ostensibly to witness the opening of that northern city's new international airport. The regime's No. 2, Gen. Maung Aye, who is regarded as Than Shwe's heir apparent, was to officiate at the ceremony and I had hoped I might meet him and arrange an interview. Unfortunately, our chartered flight arrived more than an hour after the opening ceremony had ended and Gen. Maung Aye and his retinue had long since left. We were greeted by a deserted terminal and a sea of empty plastic chairs. But at least I got to see the spiffy new building with its airbridges and trendy lounges and well-stocked shops; all that was lacking were passengers. A couple of jumbo jets flew in for the occasion, one each from Thai Airways and All Nippon Airways; but neither of these airlines, nor any other international carrier, has plans to use the new facility.\n\nOf course, some international services will eventually include historic Mandalay, possibly even with 747s; but Tin Chaw, 65, is as likely to travel on one of those jumbo jets as he is to take up his seat as the duly elected member for the constituency of West Pathein 1. He is a former school principal, and until he joined the NLD and entered politics 12 years ago, was head of the West Pathein Education Department. Still, he may take some comfort from the fact that the University of Pathein has finally reopened and is thronged with students, who, on the Saturday evening I was there, crowded the teashops along the road leading to the campus gates, chatting, reading, flirting and listening to noisy music as students do the world over.\n\nI, too, had been listening to some special music on the Friday evening before I went to Mandalay. At the Thailand Cultural Center in Bangkok, the visiting Novosibirsk Theater of Opera and Ballet had put on a stunning performance of Carl Orff's Carmina Burana, one of my all-time favorite compositions. Unaware of exactly what it was, I had first seen this cantata-cum-ballet in 1970 at the National Arts Center in Ottawa and been awestruck by the music, the dancing, and the monastic chanting of the earthy love poems. I had feared the performance by the Novosibirsk company would not make the same impact upon me. I was wrong. It was magic.\n\nAfter the finale, the audience  and remember, Thais are not renowned for their fondness of Western classical music  rose and gave the company a standing ovation. Indeed, if the theater staff working the curtains had not called a halt, I think the encores and curtain calls would have continued long into the night. Sadly, Kyaw Min, 66, will never see such a concert. Soon after his election victory in the West Pathein 2 constituency, the U.S.-trained architect and former lecturer at Yangon's Institute of Technology was detained by the military authorities. Released a year later, he was arrested once again in 1996 and placed in Yangon's notorious Insein Jail, along with several other NLD colleagues. For him, unheard melodies must, we hope, remain sweeter.\n\nIronically, at the time I attended the Novosibirsk company's Carmina Burana, I was mid-way through reading a fabulous new book called In Siberia by Colin Thubron. It is an account of his 24,000-km journey, by plane, train, boat, truck and foot, across Siberia from Yekaterinburg to Magadan. I recommend it to anyone thinking that there are no new frontiers. In it, there is a section on Novosibirsk  a city, says Thubron, most notable for being so spread out and spacious. He recalls going downtown and finding himself \"in the void of Lenin Square, where the largest opera house in Russia, bigger even than the Bolshoi, crouches like a square-headed tortoise under a dome of silver scales.\" His rather jaundiced description somewhat turned me off the place, but then when I saw a picture of the theater in the Carmina Burana program, it did not look so bad. And it made me think that perhaps I should temper my enthusiasm for this particular section of Thubron's account  though I would still unhesitatingly recommend the book to everyone.\n\nOf course, it is not something that Hla Kyi, 55, is ever likely to get a chance to read. Winner of the East Pathein 2 seat, he remains the NLD's treasurer and chief organizer for the Ayeyarwady Division. Regrettably, one of his colleagues, Maung Maung Gyi (a 78-year-old MP-elect from Mon state, who was himself only recently released from 18 months' detention), told me at the NLD headquarters last week that Hla Kyi had been taken away by the military authorities on Sept. 27 and his whereabouts remain unknown.\n\nThis is Myanmar's Gulag: NLD party members disappear and their families are not told where they are for days or weeks, and then they have only very limited access to them. But every right-thinking person must hope that the day will come soon when these four just men of Pathein will be able to take up their positions as elected members of parliament. And that they will be able to read and travel and listen to music like other civilized people. Unfortunately, right now, they do not live in a civilized country.\n\nWrite to Asiaweek at mail@web.asiaweek.com\n\nAsiaweek.com home\n\nQuick Scroll: More stories from Asiaweek, TIME and CNN\n\nLATEST HEADLINES:\n\nWASHINGTON\n\nU.S. secretary of state says China should be 'tolerant'\n\nMANILA\n\nPhilippine government denies Estrada's claim to presidency\n\nALLAHABAD\n\nFaith, madness, magic mix at sacred Hindu festival\n\nCOLOMBO\n\nLand mine explosion kills 11 Sri Lankan soldiers\n\nTOKYO\n\nJapan claims StarLink found in U.S. corn sample\n\nBANGKOK\n\nThai party announces first coalition partner\n\nTIME:\n\nCOVER: President Joseph Estrada gives in to the chanting crowds on the streets of Manila and agrees to make room for his Vice President\n\nTHAILAND: Twin teenage warriors turn themselves in to Bangkok officials\n\nCHINA: Despite official vilification, hip Chinese dig Lamaist culture\n\nPHOTO ESSAY: Estrada Calls Snap Election\n\nWEB-ONLY INTERVIEW: Jimmy Lai on feeling lucky -- and why he's committed to the island state\n\nASIAWEEK:\n\nCOVER: The DoCoMo generation - Japan's leading mobile phone company goes global\n\nBandwidth Boom: Racing to wire - how underseas cable systems may yet fall short\n\nTAIWAN: Party intrigues add to Chen Shui-bian's woes\n\nJAPAN: Japan's ruling party crushes a rebel ì at a cost\n\nSINGAPORE: Singaporeans need to have more babies.
