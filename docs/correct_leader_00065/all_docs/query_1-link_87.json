        "text": "Compliance/Financial Considerations\n\nIf you intend to do any of the following in Burma (Myanmar), please contact Risk Services at risk@berkeley.edu or 642-5141:\n\nHire a local to work for you as an employee\n\nPurchase or lease office or research space\n\nPurchase or lease an automobile\n\nEstablish a long-term (over 90 days) or ongoing project\n\nConduct a clinical trial\n\nU.S. GOVERNMENT COMPLIANCE CONSIDERATIONS\n\nForeign activities may trigger many U.S. laws, including:\n\nImport Controls\n\nExport Controls\n\nTax Reporting\n\nForeign Bank Account Reporting\n\nCountry Embargoes and Targeted Sanctions\n\nForeign Corrupt Practices Act\n\nAnti-Boycott Laws\n\nImport Controls. UC employees must adhere to U.S. import requirements, and may need to enlist the services of a customs broker, especially for shipments arriving by sea and subject to the Importer Security Filing 71730, also known as ISF 10+2.\n\nExport Controls. Export controls may apply to advanced software and technology, research data, and other sensitive assets. UC’s Export Compliance FAQ contains useful information and can be found here. Go here for the University of California plan for compliance with federal export controls. If you plan on taking or sending potentially export-controlled materials to Burma (Myanmar), consult the campus Research Administration Compliance Office at 642-0120.\n\nTax Reporting. The University and its employees may be taxed in foreign countries. The United States does not have a tax treaty with Burma (Myanmar). For more information about double taxation issues, contact the Controller’s Office at:\n\ngao@berkeley.edu or 642-0031 for tax advising and unrelated business income tax coordination, or\n\npayhelp@berkeley.edu or 642-1336 for foreign tax form processing.\n\nForeign Bank Account Reporting. The U.S. Treasury Department requires U.S. citizens with a financial interest in or signatory authority over a financial account in a foreign country, where accounts exceed $10,000 at any point during a calendar year, to report such accounts on a Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FinCen Report 114). Those needing to complete the form should contact the Controller’s Office at cashiers@berkeley.edu or 643-9803 for assistance. An IRS 1040 Schedule B form (Part III–Foreign Accounts and Trusts) must be filed by the signatory for any foreign bank account, regardless of the account balance.\n\nCountry Embargoes and Targeted Sanctions. In general, collaborations between University personnel and scholars at foreign institutions or organizations do not require export licenses unless they involve export-controlled or -restricted research or involve scholars in sanctioned countries. Before engaging in an international collaboration, the University needs to determine whether export licenses are required and to verify that the foreign collaborator is not blocked or sanctioned. The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is responsible for enforcing all U.S. embargoes and sanctions. Depending on each country’s embargo or sanction program, activities may be prohibited without specific authorization or license. UC’s International Collaborations webpage contains additional information on this topic.\n\nThe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) is intended to stop bribery. It prohibits offering to pay, paying, promising to pay, or authorizing the payment of money or anything of value to a foreign official. The term “foreign official” generally includes any employee or contractor of a foreign government, and may include individuals employed by foreign universities. It is also unlawful to make a payment to a third party knowing that all or part of the payment will go to a foreign official. For more information, review the federal government’s Resource Guide to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. If you need further clarification, contact the UC Berkeley Office of Legal Affairs at 642-7122. Transparency International’s 2018 survey of perceived public sector corruption rated Burma (Myanmar) at 29 out of 100 (132nd out of 180 countries reviewed, i.e. corrupt).\n\nAnti-Boycott Laws. The U.S. Department of Commerce is responsible for oversight of laws prohibiting individuals and entities from participating in boycotts not approved or sanctioned by the U.S. government. The Export Administration Act requires that requests to participate in such boycotts or to conduct activities in any of the boycotting countries be formally reported to the Department of Commerce and/or IRS.\n\nFor other compliance-related issues, refer to UC’s International Compliance webpage.\n\nADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR DOING BUSINESS INTERNATIONALLY\n\nForeign Bank Accounts. Employees wishing to open a foreign bank account should contact the Controller’s Office at cashiers@berkeley.edu or 643-9803. Requests to open accounts must be made through the Office of the President’s Banking and Treasury Services Group by the Chancellor or the Chancellor’s designee.\n\nReal Estate Agreements. Only employees with delegated authority to sign contracts on behalf of The Regents may enter into agreements, leases, or other contracts. Foreign affiliates or operations must submit to the Real Estate Services Office property management agreements, personal property leases, or contracts with a term longer than one year or in an amount greater than $25,000 per year. The campus then seeks approval from the University president or designee. For more information, consult the Guidelines for the Establishment and Operation of Foreign Affiliate Organizations and Foreign Operations.\n\nPersonal Safety\n\nBURMAN (MYANMAR) HAS EXTENDED THE INTERNATIONAL FLIGHT BAN THROUGH NOVEMBER 30 AMID CONTINUED HIGH LOCAL CORONAVIRUS DISEASE (COVID-19) ACTIVITY. RELIEF AND CARGO FLIGHTS CAN CONTINUE OPERATING. THE GOVERNMENT HAS EXTENDED THE SUSPENSION OF DOMESTIC FLIGHTS THROUGH NOVEMBER 15.

For more information on the travel insurance program, please go here.\n\nBecause everyone’s health is unique, we suggest seeking the advice of a medical professional before traveling internationally. Members of the campus community interested in protecting their health while abroad may schedule an appointment with the University Health Services International Travel Clinic.\n\nThe threat of civil unrest in Burma (Myanmar) is moderate. Protests occasionally occur in Myanmar and sometimes devolve into violence. Most demonstrations are related to economic conditions, social issues, or political developments. Protests are most common in Yangon, Mandalay, and Sittwe and occasionally cause minor transportation delays.\n\nCrime generally poses a moderate threat. Criminal activity is most prevalent in urban areas, particularly in tourist areas of Yangon and Mandalay. Burma (Myanmar) does not publish crime statistics, but reports suggests rising crime rates; the frequency of criminal activity targeting foreign nationals remains low.\n\nNonviolent crime poses a low threat to foreign nationals; however, crime poses a moderate threat to local staff. Pickpocketing, bag and purse grab, and hotel theft are the most common petty crimes. These opportunistic crimes can occur anywhere, but especially at major tourist attractions, transit hubs, and on public transportation. Foreign nationals are not typically targeted due to the perception that law enforcement will more vigorously pursue such crimes.\n\nCriminal activity is more likely to escalate at night; criminals act alone and in groups.\n\nOverall, the threat of violent crime is low; foreign nationals are rarely targeted. However, foreign nationals have been the victim of violent crimes. Criminals do not typically use force if a victim resists, but there are some isolated instances in which individuals have resisted thieves and have been assaulted during the course of a robbery.\n\nGender-based violence and/or discrimination poses a low threat to foreign nationals in Myanmar.\n\nAnti-LGBT violence does not systemically occur in Burma (Myanmar). However, information regarding attitudes and prevalence of same-sex relationships in the country remains scarce. Same-sex couples that express affection in public may face harassment."
