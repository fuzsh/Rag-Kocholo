        "text": "Burma\n\nCountry Overview\n\nFor over 70 years, the United States has supported the people of Burma in their quest for inclusive democracy despite the challenge of repeated coups by the military. The 2015 elections resulted in a civilian led government and a pathway toward stability and democracy. However, the 2021 military coup d’état that deposed the duly-elected government, and the armed conflict that followed have caused a sharp reversal in Burma’s development trajectory. USAID continues to work through local partners and networks to strengthen civilian government, empower local communities and civil society, promote broad-based, inclusive economic development, foster healthy and resilient communities, and deliver urgent, life-saving humanitarian assistance.\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nLatest Updates\n\nPress Releases\n\nVideo\n\nStories\n\nContacts\n\nStay Connected\n\nStay Connected\n\nFollow USAID in Burma"
