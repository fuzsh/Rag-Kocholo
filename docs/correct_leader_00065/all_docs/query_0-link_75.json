        "text": "Response to Information Request Number: MMR00002.bkk Date: August 17, 2000 Subject: Chronology Of Burmese Major Opposition Groups From: INS Resource Information Center, Washington, DC Keywords: Myanmar, Burma, opposition groups, military government, The State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), The State Peace and Development Council (SPDC), The National Democratic League (NLD)\n\nQuery:\n\nPlease provide a chronology of Burmese major opposition groups.\n\nResponse:\n\nThe following research was completed in response to the request for a chronology of Burmese major opposition groups.\n\nBurma's Fight for Independence from Britain\n\n1906\n\nThe Young Men's Buddhist Association (YMBA) was founded as the first organization to fight for Burma's independence and anti-British colonialism.\n\n1936\n\nThe All Burma Students' Union (ABSU) was formed by and of Burmese student unions through the university level. The ABSU was led by Ba Hein and Aung San, also known as Bo Te Za (Bo, meaning, \"Commander, Leader of a Force or Military Officer\"). In 1941, Aung San was the General leading the Burma Independence Army (BIA)'s military unit under Japanese invasion. After Burma's independence in 1948, the ABSU remained a prominent student organization and was a founding member of The Freedom Bloc.\n\n1939\n\nThe Communist Party of Burma (CPB), also known as The Burma Communist Party (BCP), was founded primarily as an underground insurgent organization, even though the CPB was later registered as a legal political party. The initial founders were Thakin Soe (Thakin meaning \"Master\"), Thakin Than Tun, A.N. Goshal, Thakin Hla Pe and Dr. Naag.\n\n1939\n\nThe Freedom Bloc meaning \"The Association of the Way Out\" was founded in October 1939, to make Britain aware of Burma's rights to freedom. The organization was led by Dr. Ba Maw and merged the following organizations: Do Bama Asi Ayon, The Sinyetha Party and The All Burma Students' Union (ABSU).\n\n1941\n\nThe Burma Independence Army (BIA) was formed and trained by the Japanese and had a core national group named Thirty Comrades, also known as Thirty Heroes. Aung San headed Thirty Comrades and the Comrade-in-Arms was Brigadier Ne Win.\n\n1944\n\nThe Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League (AFPFL) was founded as the military arm of the Burma Independence Army (BIA), and the first independent Burmese army. U Nu served as President and Vice President of The Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League.\n\n1945\n\nThe Patriotic Burmese Forces (PBF) was the new name given on May 30, 1945, to The Burma Independence Army (BIA), after Burmese forces led a Japanese uprising. The PBF disbanded when a new Burmese army was formed as part of The 5 Battalions of the Burma Rifles.\n\nBurma's Fight for Ethnic and Religious Freedom\n\nThere are 7 States associated with ethnic groups in Burma: Shan, Kayins (Karen), Rakhines (Arakenese), Mons, Chins, KaChins and Kayahs.\n\n1947\n\nThe Kayin (Karen) National Union (KNU) was founded in April 1947, and is the oldest ethnic insurgent group. The military arm of the KNU was The Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA). It's leader was General Bo Mya. Currently, the KNU leader is Saw Ba Thin. Historically, the Karens and Burmese were major rivals. In 1950, the KNU was pushed into the border areas of Thailand, eliminating Muslim insurgency groups, and reducing communist groups to opposition organizations. In the 1970's, the KNU was sometimes joined by The Mon National Defense Organization (MNDO) where many of its members, like KNU members, lived in Thailand.\n\n1947\n\nThe Mon National Defense Organization (MNDO) was formed as the military arm to the Mon Freedom League, later known as The Mon United Front, and led by Nai Shwe Kyin and Nai Hla Maung (Maung meaning \"younger brother\"). The organization's aim was to establish an independent Mon-Karen State.\n\n1947\n\nGeneral Aung San was assassinated with the help of his political rival, U Saw on July 19, 1947.\n\n1948\n\nOn January 4, 1948, Burma gained independence from Britain and a multi party system was established. U Nu was elected Burma's Prime Minister through 1962.\n\n1957\n\nThe Karenni National Progressive Party (KNPP), an ethnic rebel organization, was founded by Saw Maw Reh. In the 1960's, the organization controlled most of the Kayah State. The organization has many factions.\n\n1960\n\nThe Arakan National Liberation Party (ANLP) was founded as a Rakhine rebel organization. The party has many factions.\n\n1960\n\nThe Burmese Communist Party (BCP) White Flag faction located in Pegu Yoma and the BCP associated with The Red Flag faction in the Rakhine state (formerly Arakan State) were Communist underground groups assimilated by the government.\n\n1961\n\nThe Kachin Independence Organization (KIO) or Kachin Independence Army (KIA) was founded to promote Buddhism, and remained for some time, the largest and best organized armed ethnic opposition group in Burma.\n\nBurma's Switch to a Single Party System: The Burma Socialist Programme Party (BSPP)\n\n1962\n\nThe Burma Socialist Programme Party (BSPP) or Lanzin, as the party is called in Burmese language, was formed as a result of a military coup on July 4, 1962, by General U Ne Win. From 1962 to 1988, the BSPP was the one legal party until the transfer of power to a multi party system.\n\n1964\n\nThe Shan State Army (SSA) was the result of a merger between The Shan National United Front with The Shan State Independence Army (SSIA). The SSA was led by the Kokang Resistance Force. In 1972, a political arm of SSA was formed, namely, The Shan State Progress Party (SSPP). In the 1980's, the 2 organizations became riffed based on loyalties to The Communist Party of Burma.\n\n1970\n\nThe Karenni National Progress Party (KNPP), the largest Karenni (Kayah) group in the jungle, was a noncommunist group predicated on the 1875 treaty between Burmese kings and Britain. The military arm of the KNPP is The Karenni Liberation Army, which has clashed with The Burmese Communist Party (BCP); The Kayah New Land Revolutionary Council and The Karenni People's United Liberation Front. The KNU cooperated with The Karenni (Kayah) groups in the jungle.\n\n1970\n\nThe Rohingya Patriotic Front was developed by the Muslims, who had supported Britain, which heightened Burmese suspicions of treason. Arakan was the underground home to many opposition parties, mainly the Burmese Communist Party (BCP). Factions to the Rohingya Patriotic Front were The Rohingya Solidarity Organization and its rival, The Arakan Rohingya Islamic Front (ARIF), headquartered in Bangladesh. In 1978, the government mounted a campaign against the Rohingya factions entitled, Ye The Ha and used the \"Four Cuts\" strategy to cut off rebel necessities. The campaign escalated from \"King Dragon\" to murder and rape of the Arkanese, destruction of mosques, and Muslims fleeing to Bangladesh.\n\n1970\n\nThe Kachin Independence Organization (KIO) or Kachin Independence Army (KIA) and The Burmese Communist Party (BCP) cooperated in order to threaten government power. The cooperation effort stopped in 1980-1981 to fulfill regional KIO/KIA goals.\n\n1970\n\nThe Shan State Army (SSA) and the Burmese Communist Party (BCP) cooperated to threaten the Burmese government. The SSA was involved in disagreements over narcotic trading and drugs, which caused the 1976 split from the BCP. A breakaway BCP faction was established and later returned to the SSA. Some cooperation still occurred through the early 1980's.\n\n1973\n\nThe Wa National Army (WNA) which was headed by former Wa Chieftain Mahasang, who encouraged the Wa militants to fight leadership of the Communist Party of Burma (CPB).\n\nA New Constitution and Change from Burma to The Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma\n\n1974\n\nA new Constitution was adopted, and Burma became The Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma.\n\n1975\n\nThe National Democratic Front (NDF) was founded.

To avoid imprisonment, he escaped to Wankha, a Karen liberated area. In 1982, the armed wing of The ALO was established. In 1987, The ALO was reformed as The Muslim Liberation Organization of Burma (MLOB) to represent oppressed Muslims. The MLOB is the founder of The Democratic Alliance of Burma (DAB) and a member of The National Council of the Union of Burma (NCUB).\n\n1980\n\nThe People's Army was the military arm of The Burmese Communist Party (BCP). The group floundered because of it's short supply ammunition.\n\n1980\n\nThe Shan United Revolutionary Army (SURA) was formed as a separatist organization heavily involved in the narcotics trade. Formerly, The Tangyan KKY, it was Shan State Army's (SSA's) rival in the Shan State. The leader of SURA was Mo Heng.\n\nBurma's Switch to a Multi-Party System: The State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) Military Government\n\n1988\n\nThe State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), currently, The State Peace and Development Council (SPDC), was a group of Generals who came into power on September 18, 1988 as a result of a coup. Until April 23, 1992, the SLORC was headed by Senior General Saw Maung, who was replaced by Brigadier General Than Shwe. Another SLORC leader was Brigadier General Khin Nyunt.\n\n1988\n\nThe National Democratic League (NLD), was legally registered and formed by Aung Gyi, U Tin Oo and Daw Aung San Suu Kyi (Daw meaning \"Superior\"). The NLD remains the main opposition party to the military controlled government. Aung San Suu Kyi, the daughter of Burma's independence leader and retired Army General, Aung San, was elected Secretary General of the NLD on September 24, 1988. Aung San Suu Kyi and U Tin Oo were placed under house arrest on July 20 1989. On December 1989, U Tin Oo was sentenced to 3 years hard labor after a trial by a military tribunal. Aung San Suu Kyi was released from house arrest on July 15, 1995.\n\n1988\n\nThe Burma Socialist Programme Party (BSPP), a government ruling body, ended due to the call for mass demonstrations, \"The Massacre of 8-8-88\" and the resignation of General Ne Win. Demonstrators demanded democratic practices such as free and fair elections, freedom of expression, and a multi party system on September 26, 1988. The BSPP became The National Unity Party (NUP), a legally registered political party. U Sein Lwin replaced General Ne Win during additional turbulence, and when killings of protestors started, Dr. Maung Maung (Bo Nyana) replaced U Sein Lwin.\n\n1988\n\nThe People's Democracy Party (PDP) was legally registered on October 4, 1988.

The organization was chaired by U Tun Aung Gyaw.\n\n1988\n\nThe All Burma Federation of Students Union (ABFSU) was an organization formed between August and November of 1988, by students with democratic goals. It was one of the few groups at that time with no legal registration. At its founding rally, Paw U Tun (U meaning \"men of superior age or social status\") called for democracy, a government supporting fair and free elections and peaceful demonstrations. Paw U Tun was arrested on March 24 1989. The organization was also led by Min Ko Naing (Ko meaning \"elder brother\") and boasted membership of 50,000 students.\n\n1988\n\nThe State Restoration Law and Order Council (SLORC) restricted democratic freedoms; enacted laws to ban liberties and arrested opposition group members defying legislation.

The word, Myanmar, sometimes spelled, Myanma, is a Bamar word meaning self-reliance. Because the military junta changed the name to Myanmar, many, including opposition groups, still only recognize the name Burma.\n\n1989-1990\n\nBurmese military forces captured all military bases set up by the following opposition groups: The Kayin (Karen) National Union (KNU); The New Mon State Party (NMSP); and The Kachin Independence Organization (KIO) or Kachin Independence Army (KIA).\n\nThe Main Opposition to SLORC: The National Democratic League (NLD)\n\n1990\n\nAn election was held on May 27, 1990, in which The National Democratic League (NLD) won 81% (392 out of 485) of the Assembly seats and 60% of the valid popular votes over the State Law and Order and Restoration Council (SLORC). 73% of the eligible population voted in the election. However, the military refused to honor NLD's victory and did not transfer power from the government to the NLD. Many NLD members were arrested and activists fled to the Thailand border.\n\n1990\n\nAs a result of the elections, on December 18, 1990, NLD parliamentarians who were not arrested fled to Thailand and formed an exile government, The National Coalition Government for the Union of Burma (NCGUB). The NCGUB Prime Minister was Dr. Sein Wein. Since 1993, the NCGUB is based in Washington, D.C. and does government and lobbying work on behalf of the Burmese. In the 1990's, the Karen National Union (KNU), the Anti-Military Dictatorship National Solidarity Committee (ADNSC), the All-Burma Students' Democratic Front (ABSDF), and the National Democratic League (NLD) were headquartered at Manerplaw, an insurgent Burmese-Thai base. In April 1991, the NLD leaders in Yangon were forced by the military to drop U Tin Oo and Aung San Suu Kyi from their membership. The KNU embraced militancy and armed revolt. Revolt groups were common in areas such as Kayin (Karen), Kachin, Shan and the Mon States, where torture and execution happened.\n\n1991\n\n\"The Anti-Fascist Peoples' Freedom League (AFPFL) was deregistered on January 31, 1991 because its General Secretary Daw Cho Cho Kyaw Nyein and some members of its Central Executive Committee had allegedly establish[ed] links with the armed rebels with the intent to revolt against the state' and therefore turned the AFPFL into 'an overt organization of the rebels.'\"\n\n1991\n\nThe League for Democracy and Peace \"(LDP) was deregistered on February 4, 1991. According to an Election Commission announcement the party had split after the SLORC 'dismissed' U Nu and other party patrons and members of its Central Executive Committee for refusing to dissolve the 'parallel government' they set up shortly before the military coup on September 18, 1988. The Commission ruled that because of the split, the LDP was 'nullified by itself.'\"\n\n1991\n\nThe Palaung State Liberation Party (PSLP) was through April 1991 an ally of The Karen National Union (KNU) in opposition to The State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC). However, in 1992-1993, most of the PSLP leadership decided to relinquish arms and the PSLP was legalized by SLORC as a political organization.\n\n1991\n\nOn October 14 1991, Aung San Suu Kyi was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\n1992-1993\n\nIn April 1992, The State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) invited illegal groups to become legal political parties in order that the parties may be a part of development projects. The following groups accepted the invitation to become legal: Kokang National Group; Wa National Group; Shan State Army (SSA); Shan/Ahka National Group; New Democratic Army (Kachin) (NDA); Kachin Defense Army (KDA); Pa-O National Organization (PNO); Palaung State Liberation Party (PSLP); Kayan National Guard (KNG); The Kachin Independence Organization or Army (KIO) (KIA); Kayini National People's Liberation Front (KNPLF); Kayan New Land Party (KNLP); Shan National People's Liberation Organization (SNPLO). SLORC continued to extend invitations for legalization.\n\n1992-1993\n\nThe Karen National Union (KNU) did not accept The State Law and Order Restoration Council's (SLORC's) invitation for legalization. In fact, during these times of suspension of military operations, The KNU organized other illegal armed groups at the Manerplaw base into The National Council of the Union of Burma (NCUB) led by Bo Mya, also the leader of the KNU. The National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma (NCGUB) was known as \"a parallel government\" to the National League for Democracy (NLD) because it contained many elected NLD candidates.\n\n1992-1994\n\nThe Karen National Union (KNU) bombed and attacked The Htimukhee Tatmadaw (\"military government\"), The Hweponlang Post, and columns in Bilin, Thaton, Pa-an, Hlaingbwe, Kawkareik, Myawaddy, Kyaikmaraw, Mudon, Thanbyuzayat, Yay, Dawai, Palaw, Tanintharyi and Bokpyin townships to continue SLORC opposition.\n\n1994\n\nOn April 10 and 12, 1994, The Karen National Union (KNU), a largely Buddhist organization, dispatched KNU officers to cooperate with the Khun Sa's Mong Tai Army (MTA). To reciprocate, the MTA sent officers to coordinate military and economic cooperation between the KNU and MTA. However, the peace efforts of The KNU backfired when Bo Mya of the KNU treated the Buddhist monk, Myaing-gyi-ngu Sayadaw U Thuzana, with disrespect by evicting him and about 40 other monks from the area. An armed revolt ensued based on KNU internal strife and beliefs of discrimination based on religious beliefs; unfairness in promotions and unwillingness to attain peace.\n\n1994\n\nOn December 1, 1994, the 3,000 people, who split from the Karen National Union (KNU) and revolted, formed the Democratic Kayin Buddhist Organization (DKBO).\n\n1995\n\nOn January 1, 1995, the Karen National Union (KNU) launched an attack on the Democratic Kayin Buddhist Organization (DKBO). With the support of SLORC and the populace, the DKBO won a number of victories, and finally took over the Manerplaw base and KNU headquarters.\n\n1995\n\nAs a result of the internal strife and defeat of the Karen National Union (KNU) and the Democratic Kayin Buddhist Organization (DKBO) victory, Buddhists, Christians, and Kayin people have repatriated to Myanmar. As of February 10, 1995, a total of 5,000 people returned to Myanmar.\n\n1996\n\nThe Student's and Youth Congress of Burma (SYCB) was founded in January 1996. The SYCB is composed of 10 student and youth organizations from Thailand and India, representing various nationalities. The SYCB is comprised of: the All Arakanese Students and Youth Congress (AASYC), the All Burma Students' Democratic Front (ABSDF), The All Burma Student's League (ABSL), The All Kachin Student's and Youth Union (AKSYU), The Democratic Party for a New Society (DPNS), The Kuki Student's Democratic Front (KSDF), The Karen Youth Organization (KYO), The National League for Democracy (NLD) - Liberated Area (Youth), The Overseas Mon National Student's Organization (OMNSO) and The Pa-O Youth Democratic Organization (PYDO).\n\nChange from The State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) to The State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) Military Government\n\n1997\n\nOn November 15, 1997, the name of The State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) was changed to The State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) in order to remove most of the former General leaders. Currently, 28 of the 40 Cabinet members are military, with Foreign Minister Ohn Gyaw as the only civilian in a senior position. General Than Shwe remains the Chairman of SPDC, as does Khin Nyunt remain the Intelligence Chief.\n\n1998\n\nThe National Council of the Union of Burma was formed on September 16, 1998, under orders of 25 National Democratic League (NLD) elected parliament members and 4 ethnic parties: Shan National League for Democracy, Arakan League for Democracy, Mon National League for Democracy, and Zomi (Chin) National Congress.\n\n1998\n\nThe State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) arrested and detained National Democratic League and other opposition members, who had \"sparked unrest,\" as well as NLD parliamentarians that the SPDC later admitted holding as hostages in October and November.\n\n1999\n\nDr. Michael Aris, Suu Kyi's husband of 27 years, was dying of prostate cancer in England. He applied for a visa to Burma to die in his wife's arms, however, his visa was denied. Instead, the SPDC encouraged Aung San Suu Kyi to fly to her husband's side. She stated that the SPDC took advantage of the situation to attempt to get her out of Burma, because everyone knew that once she left, she would not be able to return to Burma. She did not attend the funeral of her husband on March 28, 1999, nor did she visit her two sons.\n\n2000\n\nSince 1989, cease fire agreements with some opposition groups have been finalized, however, fighting still occurs along the Thailand-Burma border under the regulation of Royal Thai Government (RTG).\n\n2000\n\nOn May 2, 2000, the Burmese government accused Aung San Suu Kyi of The National Democratic League (NLD) and her followers of links to rebel groups and \"contacts with dissidents and armed terrorist groups.\" They could \"face the death penalty or life imprisonment\" for high treason.\n\n2000\n\nIn July 2000, The National Democratic League (NLD) filed a suit, for the second time, with The Supreme Court accusing General Than Shwe, Chief of the Military Council and Chairman of The Election Commission of violating electoral law and NLD harassment. In response, Military Spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Hla Min said the NLD should behave \"in a more responsible and constructive manner with the aim of doing serious work in solving Myanmar's real challenges.\" He added that the government was \"working hard to develop Myanmar in it's transition to a stable democracy.\"\n\nReferences\n\nAmnesty International.
