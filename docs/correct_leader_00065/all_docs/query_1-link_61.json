Since 2017, Open Society Myanmar has been registered as a national, independent foundation in the country, following the establishment of a memorandum of understanding with the government in 2012. Open Society Myanmar has continued to work with governmental and civil society actors to expand inclusive education and access to health care, support drug policy reform, protect the rights of ethnic and religious minorities, and support a new generation of political leaders who will help secure the country’s democratic reforms."
