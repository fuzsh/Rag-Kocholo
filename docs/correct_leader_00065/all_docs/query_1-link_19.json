        "text": "She was once seen as a beacon for human rights - a principled activist who gave up her freedom to challenge the ruthless army generals who ruled Myanmar for decades.\n\nIn 1991, Aung San Suu Kyi was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, while still under house arrest, and hailed as \"an outstanding example of the power of the powerless\".\n\nIn 2015, she led her National League for Democracy (NLD) to victory in Myanmar's first openly contested election in 25 years. But she was deposed by a coup in 2021 when the military took control and arrested her and the political leadership around her.\n\nHer official title was state counsellor. The President until the 2021 coup, Win Myint, was a close aide.\n\nIn 2020, her NLD once again won a landslide majority, getting even more votes than in the 2015 vote.\n\nThe still powerful military disputed the results, claiming election fraud. On the day parliament was to a sit for the first time, the military arrested Ms Suu Kyi along with many other political leaders.\n\nIt then declared a state of emergency, handing power to the military for a full year.\n\nMs Suu Kyi was later charged with illegally importing communications equipment. Police said they found seven walkie-talkie radios in her home which she was not authorised to possess.\n\nMs Suu Kyi is the daughter of Myanmar's independence hero, General Aung San.\n\nHe was assassinated when she was only two years old, just before Myanmar gained independence from British colonial rule in 1948.\n\nIn 1960 she went to India with her mother Daw Khin Kyi, who had been appointed Myanmar's ambassador in Delhi.\n\nFour years later she went to Oxford University in the UK, where she studied philosophy, politics and economics. There she met her future husband, academic Michael Aris.\n\nAfter stints of living and working in Japan and Bhutan, she settled in the UK to raise their two children, Alexander and Kim, but Myanmar was never far from her thoughts.\n\nBut the demonstrations were brutally suppressed by the army, which seized power in a coup on 18 September 1988. Ms Suu Kyi was placed under house arrest the following year.\n\nThe military government called national elections in May 1990, which Ms Suu Kyi's NLD convincingly won - but the junta refused to hand over control.\n\nMs Suu Kyi remained under house arrest in Yangon for six years, until she was released in July 1995.\n\nShe was again put under house arrest in September 2000, when she tried to travel to the city of Mandalay in defiance of travel restrictions.\n\nShe was released unconditionally in May 2002, but just over a year later was imprisoned after a government-backed mob set upon her entourage in the north of the country. She escaped because of the swift action taken by her driver, but many of her supporters were savagely beaten and a number died.\n\nShe was later allowed to return home - but again under effective house arrest.\n\nAt times she was able to meet other NLD officials and selected diplomats, but during the early years she was often in solitary confinement. She was not allowed to see her two sons or her husband, who died of cancer in March 1999.\n\nThe military authorities had offered to allow her to travel to the UK to see him when he was gravely ill, but she felt compelled to refuse for fear she would not be allowed back into the country.\n\nMs Suu Kyi was side-lined from Myanmar's first elections in two decades on 7 November 2010 but released from house arrest six days later. Her son Kim was allowed to visit her for the first time in a decade.\n\nAs the new government embarked on a process of reform, Ms Suu Kyi and her party re-joined the political process.\n\nThey won 43 of the 45 seats contested in April 2012 by-elections, in an emphatic statement of support. Ms Suu Kyi was sworn in as an MP and leader of the opposition.\n\nThe following May, she left Myanmar for the first time in 24 years, in a sign of apparent confidence that its new leaders would allow her to return.\n\nDuring her time in power Ms Suu Kyi and the NLD government also faced criticism for prosecuting journalists and activists using colonial-era laws.\n\nWhile there was progress in some areas, the military continued to hold a quarter of parliamentary seats and controlled key ministries including defence, home affairs and border affairs.\n\nIn August 2018, Ms Suu Kyi described the generals in her cabinet as \"rather sweet\" and Myanmar's democratic transition, analysts said, appeared to have stalled.\n\nThe 2021 military coup came as the country was facing one of South East Asia's worst Covid-19 outbreaks, putting new strains on an already impoverished healthcare system as lockdown measures devastate livelihoods.\n\nThe coup triggered widespread demonstrations and Myanmar's military has cracked down on pro-democracy protesters, activists and journalists.\n\nIn December 2021, Ms Suu Kyi was found guilty of inciting dissent and breaking Covid rules in the first of a series of verdicts that could see her jailed for life. UN Human Rights chief Michelle Bachelet called it a \"sham trial\" that would only \"deepen rejection of the coup\".\n\nMs Suu Kyi faces 11 charges in total and denies them all.\n\nYet Ms Suu Kyi remains popular. A 2020 survey by the People's Alliance for Credible Elections, a watchdog, found that 79% of people had trust in her - up from 70% the previous year.\n\nDerek Mitchell, former US Ambassador to Myanmar told the BBC: \"The story of Aung San Suu Kyi is as much about us as it is about her. She may not have changed. She may have been consistent and we just didn't know the full complexity of who she is.\n\n\"We have to be mindful that we shouldn't endow people with some iconic image beyond which is human.\""
