        "text": "Myanmar's parliamentary speaker Shwe Mann has been ousted from his role as chairman of the ruling USDP party, amid a power struggle.\n\nSecurity forces surrounded the USDP offices on Wednesday, preventing officials from leaving.\n\nMyanmar is holding elections in three months, its first since democratic reforms began in 2011.\n\nShwe Mann had been rumoured to be discussing an alliance with opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi.\n\nMs Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) is expected to do well in the 8 November elections, while many believe the ruling Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) will perform poorly.\n\nHowever, Ms Suu Kyi is barred by the constitution from contesting the presidency, so negotiations between the NLD and USDP could help determine who ends up leading Myanmar, also known as Burma.\n\nRead more: Myanmar's 2015 general elections explained\n\nAnalysis by Moe Myint, BBC Burmese service\n\nAung San Suu Kyi and Shwe Mann have often expressed that they have a mutual understanding for future co-operation.\n\nOne likely area is thought to be amendment of the constitution, which prevents Ms Suu Kyi from running for the presidency.\n\nBut for conservative forces in the ruling USDP party and the military, constitutional change is seen as a threat - because the constitution gives the military an automatic 25% of seats in parliament, and safeguards the traditional alliance between the USDP and the armed forces.\n\nThis latest move means an inner circle of the president's has come out on top. It could also worsen the relationships between the ruling elites and the opposition."
