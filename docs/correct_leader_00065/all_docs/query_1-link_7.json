        "text": "The World Health Organization (WHO)\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) was established on 7 April 1948 as the directing and coordinating authority in global public health within the United Nations system. Working at three levels in the Organization (global, regional and country), more than 7000 WHO staff worldwide collaborate with the governments of 194 Member States and other partners to achieve the WHO founding vision of the attainment of the highest possible level of health by all people.\n\nThe South East Asia Region\n\nThe WHO South East Asia Region (SEAR) includes 11 member states, of which Myanmar is one. The others are: Bangladesh, Bhutan, DPR Korea, India, Indonesia, Maldives, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Timor Leste. The WHO South-East Asia Regional Office (SEARO) is located in New Delhi, India.\n\nWHO presence in Myanmar\n\nMyanmar became a party to WHO's constitution on 1 July 1948. WHO staff in the country office have played a central role in supporting the people and the Government of Myanmar to improve health. The mission of WHO in Myanmar is the attainment of the highest possible level of health by the people of Myanmar. WHO country office Myanmar, led by a Representative, provides technical and financial assistance to, and collaborates with, the Ministry of Health and Sports. WHO provides leadership and technical support to the Ministry of Health and other health partners working in the country. WHO's national and international staff provide support for technical assistance, capacity building, advocacy, policy development, standards and guidelines.\n\nWHO vision and mission\n\nThe founding vision of WHO is a world in which all people attain the highest possible standard of health and well-being. The WHO mission is to promote health, keep the world safe and serve the vulnerable. WHO works with a commitment to human rights, universality and equity, based on the principles espoused in the WHO Constitution.\n\nCore functions of WHO include: providing leadership on matters crucial to health and engaging in partnerships where joint action is needed; shaping the research agenda and stimulating the generation, translation and dissemination of valuable knowledge; setting norms and standards and promoting and monitoring their implementation; articulating ethical and evidence- based policy options; providing technical support to catalyse changes; building sustainable institutional capacity; and monitoring the health situation and assessing health trends.\n\nThe mission of WHO in Myanmar is the attainment of the highest possible level of health by the people of Myanmar.\n\nIn order to provide effective support, the WHO country office leverages the three levels of the Organization: to focus support where it can make a difference; to place the right people in the right places; to engage partners effectively; to enhance communications; and to improve operational intelligence.\n\nPriorities of WHO\n\nWHO’s general programme of work (GPW) sets medium-term priorities and strategies of the Organization. The World Health Assembly in May 2018 is expected to approve the 13th general programme of work, covering the period 2019–2023. It encompasses a set of three interconnected strategic priorities, strategic shifts and organizational shifts, as well as 10 outcomes to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. The three strategic priorities are:\n\nUniversal health coverage: 1 billion more people benefitting from universal health coverage\n\nHealth emergencies: 1 billion more people better protected from health emergencies\n\nHealthier populations: 1 billion more people enjoying better health and well-being\n\nWe offer multiple opportunities for people passionate about improving the health for all around the world. From fixed-term international appointments in offices worldwide to generalists, internships and fellowships in regional and country offices, we offer a range of opportunities for people looking to contribute to saving lives.\n\nThrough our global employment portal, you can search for positions in any of our 149 offices. At WHO, we offer a variety of fellowships, study tours and a Health Leadership Development Initiative to prepare health professionals for leadership positions and strengthen national health systems.\n\nOur Internship and Volunteer Programme also provides opportunities for graduate and postgraduate students to gain insight into the work of WHO, while enriching their knowledge and experience in the health field."
