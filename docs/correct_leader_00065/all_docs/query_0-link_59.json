        "text": "Justice for Myanmar (JFM) announced on January 11 that the assets of Myanmar junta chief Min Aung Hlaing’s children were also uncovered by the Thai police raid on the home of drug lord and arms broker Tun Min Latt.\n\nHe was arrested last September on charges of conspiracy to traffic narcotics and money laundering Deeds and bankbooks belonging to Min Aung Hlaing’s daughter and son were found at the home of Tun Min Latt who has business interests in hotels, energy and mining, is a close associate of Myanmar junta leader Min Aung Hlaing and has procured supplies for the military from China and Israel.\n\nThose close ties are illustrated by various photos of Tun Min Latt with the junta leader together, and the picture of them seen together at an arms fair in Bangkok in 2019 published by Myanmar state media.\n\nA 2019 U.N. document says Tun Min Latt is the son of a retired Myanmar lieutenant colonel and that a company he part-owns, had made donations amounting around $71,500 to the Myanmar military in 2017 JFM reports Tun Min Latt is also a business partner of Myanmar Military’s Office of the Quartermaster General and military business conglomerate Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited (MEHL).\n\nJFM Yadanar Maung spokesman elaborated “ This business crony is a co-owner of a military owned casino and is now charged with drug trafficking and money laundering.\n\nAt the same time, he acted as a broker in the purchase of military weapons for the Myanmar military from China and Israel. He is the son of a retired lieutenant colonel who was a former official of the Ministry of Hotels and Tourism under U Than Shwe’s government.”\n\nReuters reported his arrest in Thailand according to a Thai police source “is part of a broader Thai crackdown on money laundering from narcotics in the border town of Tachileik in Myanmar’s Shan state.”\n\nJustice For Myanmar urged the Thai authorities to seize the assets of Aung Pyae Sone and Khin Thiri Thet Mon ( Min Aung Hlaing’s children) and investigate whether they have benefited from the alleged crime, and to block members of the regime and their families and supporters from using Thai banks and purchasing assets in Thailand.”\n\nJFM explained his background “Since November 2017, he has been working in partnership with the Office of the Quartermaster General in the casino business through Myanmar Allure Group, which is the Myanmar subsidiary of Allure Group, which linked him to the drugs and crime nexus of the Golden Triangle region.\n\nThai banks are also required to close the bank accounts of cronies, sanctioned members of the military groups and their family members, JFM said in a statement.\n\n“ Myanmar military group is not only a terrorist organization, but also a transnational criminal enterprise that cooperates with international criminals like Tun Min Latt,” FM spokesperson Ma Yadanar Maung said."
