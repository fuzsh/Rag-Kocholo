Everyone has a role to play—we're proud to do our part.\n\nWomen continue to face challenges in sexual and reproductive health and rights. We strengthen the knowledge, capacity, and coordination of decision-makers, service providers, and community members to advance sexual and reproductive health services and rights in Myanmar. We support the government in developing and implementing new policies and guidelines to advance sexual and reproductive health. We assisted the Ministry of Health and Sports in launching the country’s first guidelines for secondary prevention of cervical cancer. We also help in introducing and scaling up innovative tools for identifying childhood illnesses thus contributing to reduction of mortality in children under five years of age.\n\nWe develop and implement new approaches to prevent, manage, and eliminate infectious diseases such as TB and malaria. To advance TB care and control, we introduced AI augmented chest X-rays to facilitate TB screenings. We also developed gender-responsive TB screening activities, engaging women in TB case detection. To reduce the malaria burden in Myanmar, we are working to accelerate the introduction and scaling of a safe cure for P. vivax.\n\nTo tackle micronutrient malnutrition and anemia, we work with stakeholders to introduce and scale-up fortified rice through commercial and social safety net channels to improve health outcomes. We support the development of national policies and guidelines for rice fortification and nutrition while assisting the food industry and private sector in best production practices. We work to ensure fortified rice reaches the most vulnerable populations, including migrant workers in Yangon. We enhance migrant transitions and promote healthy eating behaviors among them through peer-directed networks and services that focus on promoting healthy diets and food choices.\n\nPATH works with the Central Expanded Program on Immunization under the Ministry of Health and Sports to introduce new vaccines and strengthen national immunization systems. We introduced the Japanese Encephalitis vaccine in Myanmar and the subsequent integration of the vaccine into national routine immunization. We also strengthen immunization systems broadly, including establishing health waste management models for safe disposal of health care waste and needles.\n\nThrough our existing relationships and experience, PATH was well positioned to support Myanmar’s rapid response to COVID-19. We conduct environmental surveillance for COVID-19 as well as We are providing technical assistance to communities, civil society groups, and health care providers who are responding to the pandemic while protecting other essential health care services. We are also distributing informational materials on virus control and infection prevention to rural areas of Myanmar through our partners and their network of civil society organizations.\n\nWe are harnessing the power of technology and innovation to ensure good health is within reach for more people. We help develop and scale digital technologies, and improve the quality and use of data for improved health outcomes. From design to development to implementation, we are helping bring the right solutions to some of the toughest public health challenges. In Myanmar, our digital health portfolio includes data collection and visualization, data science-based prediction modelling, and artificial intelligence for improved service delivery and patient coverage."
