The information is from entry no. 5 in the 1889 catalogue of the Earl of Northbrook collection. It refers, most likely, to noted collector and dealer C. J. Nieuwenhuys [1799-1883], Brussels and London.\n\n[2]. As by Bernard Van Orley.\n\n[3]. In the 1889 catalogue of the Earl of Northbrook collection, this work, no. 5, is simply listed under the \"Early Netherlandish School\" section, with the following footnote: \"A similar picture was, in 1860, in the collection of the Rev. Mr. Heath, Vicar of Enfield.\"\n\n[4]. The Earl lent it to the Royal Academy Exhibition of Flemish and Dutch art in 1927.\n\n[5]. Photo, no. R 770.

(Accession Date: March 26, 2003);NOTES;[1] The early provenance of this painting was established by Carla Kunkel, who kindly shared the results of her research (see correspondence in MFA curatorial file). By 1684, Elector Johann Wilhelm of the Palatine (r. 1690-1716) had already begun to assemble his collection of about 350 paintings through a network of dealers throughout Europe. An inventory of his collection, made at the time of his death and published in 1751, records the MFA painting as one of seven works by Dou: \"An old woman cuts bread, near her is a young boy with a spoon in his hand, and a small child sits at the table, on which is a ham. By Gerard Dou.\" See Johan von Gool, \"Catalogus en uitvoerige Beschriyvinge der voortrefflyke onschatbaere Schilderkunst,\" in De nieuwe Schouburg der nederlantsche kunstschilders en Schilderessen, vol. 2 (s'Gravenhage, 1751).;[2] Karl Philipp inherited his brother's painting collection and transferred it from Düsseldorf to Mannheim in 1730. The painting is recorded in the inventory drawn up at Mannheim in 1730 (no. 132: \"An old woman cutting bread, with a boy holding a candle in his hand\") and is visible in the drawings made of the cabinet walls there in 1731. For these documents, see Everhard Korthals Altes, \"The collections of the Palatine Electors: new information, documents and drawings\" Burlington Magazine 145, no. 1200 (March, 2003): 209 (fig. 98), 212, and Appendix, no. 132. The painting is also included in the 1756 \"inventory of the princely art collection at Mannheim\" (Verzeichnis der in den Churfürstlichen Cabinetten zu Mannheim befindlichen Mahlereyen, no. 109: \"An old woman sits at a table, cutting a loaf of bread, in front of the table stands a boy with a light, behind is a smaller boy, who eats something with a spoon\"). See \"Geschichte der kurfürstlichen Gemäldegalerie in Mannheim,\" in Mannheimer Geschichtsblätter 27 (1926): 38.;[3] In 1777, Karl Theodor, already Elector of the Palatine, inherited the Electorate of Bavaria and the estates of the House of Wittelsbach. Thereafter, the Mannheim Galerie was legally merged with the Wittelsbach family collections.;[4] With Karl Theodor's death in 1799, the Sulzbach line of succession became extinct. The Electorates of both the Palatine and Bavaria passed to Maximilian Joseph, who, as Duke of Zweibrücken (since 1795) was the most senior prince. He became Maximilian I, King of Bavaria, in 1806, at which point the Mannheim Galerie was transferred to the Wittelsbach estate in Munich.;[5] In 1836 King Ludwig I (r. 1825 - 1848) opened the Pinakothek in Munich to exhibit the royal painting collection. It was renamed the Alte Pinakothek with the opening of the Neue Pinakothek across the street in 1853.;[6] In the 1930s, the director of the Bavarian State Paintings Collection, Ernst Buchner, deaccessioned many paintings at the Alte Pinakothek to trade for German works of art. At least seventy-four Dutch paintings, including the Dou, were deaccessioned at this time. In a letter to Dr. Buchner of February 22, 1937, Eduard Plietzsch confirmed the conditions of the trade: in exchange for three German altarpiece panels, he would receive the Dou and a small landscape by Jan Brueghel the Elder, this is confirmed in the registers of the Alte Pinakothek. According to David Alan Brown and Jane Van Niemen (Raphael and the Beautiful Banker [London and New Haven, 2005], p. 218, n. 17), the official date of the trade was March 3, 1937. While Plietzsch received the painting, by April the dealer Heinz Steinmeyer was offering it for sale. In a letter of April 21, 1937 Steinmeyer attested that the Alte Pinakothek had asked to trade the Dou for a German painting. In order to compensate the seller of the German painting, Steinmeyer needed first to sell the Dou. For further information on the deaccessions, see Jonathan Petropoulos, The Faustian Bargain: The Art World in Nazi Germany (Oxford, 2000), 31-32.https://collections.mfa.org/objects/33415/still-life-in-an-architectural-settingFrançois Emmanuel van Ertborn (b. 1716 - d. 1791), Antwerp, August 18, 1807, posthumous Ertborn sale, Beeckmans, Antwerp, lot 42, to Henri-Joseph Stier d'Aertselaer, Antwerp, July 29, 1822, Aertselaer sale, G.

(Accession Date: September 14, 1950);NOTES;[1] On the provenance of this painting from Puthon to Gsell, see Theodor von Frimmel, \"Lexikon der Wiener Gemäldesammlungen\" (Munich, 1913), pp. 290, 375-376. Festetits acquired many works of art from Dräxler von Carin, and it is likely that he acquired this painting from him as well.;[2] With the Anschluss, or annexation of Austria to Nazi Germany in March, 1938, the possessions of Alphonse and Clarice de Rothschild were seized and expropriated almost immediately by Nazi forces. This painting appears in a Nazi-generated inventory of 1939 as no. AR (Alphonse Rothschild) 884: \"Jan Fyt, Architektur mit Stilleben.

The Führermuseum, the art museum Adolf Hitler planned to build in Linz, Austria, was given right of first refusal over the confiscated Rothschild collection. This painting was included in an inventory of the museum drawn up on July 31, 1940. CIR no. 4, attachment 73.;[3] The Führerbau in Munich was used as a repository for works of art. An inventory of the paintings was drawn up in 1943, the Führerbau inventory number, 3225, is recorded on the reverse of this painting's stretcher in chalk and on a label.;[4] Many works of art stored elsewhere by the Nazis were moved to the abandoned salt mines of Alt Aussee in Austria, to be kept safe from wartime bombing.;[5] Allied troops recovered the artwork at the end of World War II and established collecting points where the art could be identified for restitution to its rightful owners. This painting came to the Munich Central Collecting Point in 1945 from Alt Aussee (number 3577), and was numbered 4928, which is recorded on the reverse of the painting stretcher. The Munich Central Collecting Point inventory card is held by the National Archives and Records Administration, College Park, Maryland (Property Card 4928, National Archives Record Group 260, Box 501, and National Archives Record Group 260, Entry USACA-USFA, File Rep & Rest.

(Accession Date: January 2, 1950);NOTES;[1] This biccherna, or account book cover, was recorded by Galgano Bichi in Siena in 1724, see L. Borgia et al., Le Biccherne: Tavole Dipinte delle Magistrature Senesi (Secoli XIII-XVIII) (Rome, 1984), p. 112, cat. no. 36. It was probably dispersed in the late eighteenth or early nineteenth century.;[2] Published in Ramboux's collection catalogue of 1862, no. 21. See A. Geffroy, \"Tablettes Inédites de la Biccherna et de la Gabella de Sienne,\" Mélanges d'Archéologie et d'Histoire 2 (1882), p. 419.;[3] In 1949, when the MFA first considered acquiring the panel, its owner wrote to Walter Schatzki, the dealer through whom it was offered (November 14, 1949). According to a transcript of this letter (which is unsigned, but must have been written by Max Neunzert, as discussed below), \"this painting formerly belonged to my good friend Karl Anton Reichel. I obtained the painting from him in Munich in 1931 upon my return from China, since he then found himself in financial difficulties.\" An authentication of the painting by Georg Swarzenski of February 28, 1933 is, however, addressed to Reichel, which suggests that it was still in his possession at that time. The painting was probably in Reichel's possession in February 1931, as well, when it was authenticated in Munich by Wilhelm Suida.;[4] As discussed above (n. 3), despite the letter attesting that the sale took place in 1931, the authentication of the painting by Swarzenski in 1933 suggests that it was in Reichel's possession at that time. It was certainly in Max Neunzert's possession by July 24, 1934, when it was authenticated by Hanna Gräff on behalf of her husband, Dr. Walter Gräff, and Neunzert was named as the owner. Neunzert later attested that he took the panel to Switzerland in 1934 (see below, Additional Information).;[5] According to his letter to Walter Schatzki (as above, n. 3), Neunzert \"deposited the painting -- when I was forced to flee Munich on account of my anti-Nazi activities -- in Switzerland, and in 1943 put it up for sale at the Galerie Fischer in Lucerne. It is listed in the Fischer catalogue for that year. I did not sell it because of the low price it made.\" Correspondence from Kuno Fischer, Galerie Fischer, to the MFA (February 18, 2004) indicates that the consignor of the painting was Mrs. Dr. Zellweger of Zurich. Whether Neunzert consigned it to Fischer under a pseudonym, or whether he had entrusted the panel to a Mrs. Zellweger, is not known.;ADDITIONAL INFORMATION;Max Neunzert was a member of the Nazi party in the 1920s. The statements that he made to Walter Schatzki in 1949 (see above, n. 3) can be corroborated with what is known of his life. In 1929 Neunzert traveled to China to help spread National Socialism, he returned to Munich in 1931. Like Carl Anton Reichel, he fought for the restoration of the monarchy in Germany. Upon his return from China in 1931, he realized this would not be possible under Hitler, and he left the party. Thereafter he fought actively against the Nazis. He assumed names including \"Max Keck\" and \"Mr. Donau\" and was exiled in Switzerland during the 1940s. For more on Neunzert, see Carlos Collado Seidel, \"In geheimer Mission für Hitler und die bayerische Staatsregierung. Der politische Abenteurer Max Neunzert zwischen Fememorden, Hitler-Pusch und Berlin-Krise,\" Vierteljarshefte für Zeitgeschichte 50, no. 2 (April, 2002): 201-236.;In a signed statement of January 20, 1948, written from Flims-Waldhaus, Max Neunzert attested that the painting was not Nazi loot: \"I herewith declare on oath that the Biccherna panel was legally acquired by me at that time and, therefore, is not Nazi looted property. In order to deny the Nazis access to it, as early as 1934 I was able to bring the panel into Switzerland.;The MFA has no indication that the panel was improperly transferred or stolen during the Nazi era.https://collections.mfa.org/objects/33532/moses-and-the-israelites-after-the-miracle-of-water-from-theBy 1657, Borghese family, Rome [see note 1], by descent within the family to Agnese Borghese (b. 1836 - d. 1920), Principessa di Piombino, Rome [see note 2]. 1900, with Julius Böhler, Munich. 1900, acquired on the Munich art market by the Germanisches Nationalmuseum, Nuremberg [see note 3], 1954, sold by the Germanisches Nationalmuseum, through the Schaeffer Galleries, New York (stock no. 1563), to the MFA for $135,000 [see note 4]. (Accession Date: December 9, 1954);NOTES;[1] This is probably the painting by Lucas van Leyden recorded in the Borghese collection as early as 1657.

The Principessa must have been Agnese Borghese, wife of Rodolfo, 7th Prince of Piombino (b. 1832 - d. 1911).

Drey was the buyer, as documented in Cassirer's records as well as in those kept by the dealer Karl Haberstock, Berlin, who visited the sale that day.;[3] At the time of the painting's acquisition, Eugene Garbáty provided the MFA with a memo dated June, 1934, bearing his signature, regarding comparative works by Zanobi Machiavelli. As he was compiling information on the artist as early as 1934, the painting was probably already in his possession at that time. Mr. Garbáty emigrated to the U.S. in 1939 and lent the painting to the MFA in that year.https://collections.mfa.org/objects/32850/shipwreckUntil 1933, Ludwig Behr (d. 1945), Tutzing, Germany;June 27-28, 1933, Behr sale, Helbing, Munich, lot 176. 1940, private collection, New York;February 15, 1940, sale of private collector, Sotheby Parke-Bernet, New York, lot 42.

Collins, Inc., New York, to the MFA. (Accession Date: October 15, 1980);NOTES;[1] According to notes in the MFA curatorial file.;[2] Published by L. Frölich-Bum, \"Einige Werke des Meisters von Alkmaar in Wiener Privatbesitz\" Oud-Holland 51 (1934), pp. 182-187, as belonging to David Goldmann. When they were in Mr. Goldmann's possession, the two panels formed a triptych, with a 17th-century Spanish relief sculpture of St. Anthony between them. On the collection of David and Lily Goldmann, see Sophie Lillie, Was einmal war, Handbuch der enteigneten Kunstammlungen Wiens (Vienna, 2003), pp. 409-415.;[3] With the Anschluss, or annexation of Austria to Nazi Germany in March, 1938, the possessions of David Goldmann were seized almost immediately by Nazi forces. Goldmann's panels appear in a Nazi-generated inventory of 1939 as no. DG (David Goldmann) 107: \"Hausaltar mit zwei Altarflügeln. Werke eines Malers aus der Antwerpener Schule, auf dem einen Flügel Christus vor Kaiaphas, auf dem anderen Christus vor Pilatus, auf der einen Seite ein heiliger Bischof, auf der anderen der gegeisselte Christus. In dem Schrank ein Heiliger.\" Inventar der Sammlung D.G., in Katalog beschlagnahmter Sammlungen, inbesondere der Rothschild-Sammlungen in Wien, Verlags-Nr. 4938, Staatsdruckerei Wien, 1939, Privatarchiv, reproduced in Lillie, Was einmal war (as above, n. 1), p. 412, no. 107. The panels also appear in a Nazi inventory of July 31, 1940 of works reserved for the decoration of the Führermuseum, the art museum Adolf Hitler planned to build in Linz, Austria: Verzeichnis der für Linz in Aussicht genommenen Gemälde, p. 8: \"Ferner als Reserve für dekorative Zwecke... Niederländisch, um 1500, Hausaltar.;[4] Many works of art stored elsewhere by the Nazis were moved to the abandoned salt mines of Alt Aussee in Austria, where they would be safe from wartime bombing.;[5] Allied troops established collecting points where looted works of art could be identified for eventual restitution to their rightful owners. These paintings came to the Munich Central Collecting Point from Alt Aussee (no. 4095), and were numbered 8875. This information is taken from inventory card 1557 A-B, Stichting Nederlandsch Kunstbezit Archive, no. 846, and Munich Central Collecting Point inventory card, National Archives and Records Administration, College Park, MD (Proprty Card 8875, Microfilm M1946, Reel 50).;[6] After World War II, the Stichting Nederlandsch Kunstbezit (SNK, Foundation for Netherlandish Art Property) was assigned the task of recuperating looted artworks from abroad and returning them to their rightful owners in the Netherlands.;[7] The panels were mistakenly believed to have come from the collection of O. Lanz of Amsterdam. For this reason, they were not returned to David Goldmann immediately following the war, but were taken to the Netherlands along with other works of art destined for restitution by the SNK (letter from Rudolf E. O. Ekkart, Head of the Origins Unknown Project (Bureau Herkomst Gezocht), The Hague, August 17, 2004).;[8] This information was made available through the generous assistance of Arno van Os, registrar at the Museum Catharijneconvent, Utrecht (letter of May 13, 2004). On February 21, 1952 the Archbishop Museum received a letter from the Bureau Herstelbetalings- en Recuperatiegoederen requesting the return of the panels to David Goldmann and on March 10 they left the museum for restitution to him. The panels were listed among the works still missing from Mr. Goldmann's collection in the Verzeichnisse gesuchter Kunstwerke aus österreichischem Besitz (n.d., [1950?]). Their restitution in 1952 to David Goldmann's family has been confirmed in a signed statement by his daughter (May 10, 2004), as well as in a letter from her to the MFA (June 26, 2004).;[9] According to the letter from Mr. Goldmann's daughter (as above, n. 8).;[10] According to an interoffice memorandum (September 20, 1981, in the MFA curatorial file).https://collections.mfa.org/objects/469980/the-calenberg-altarpieceBy 1524, Duke Erich I von Braunschweig-Calenberg (b. 1470 - d. 1540) and his wife, Katharina von Saxonia (b. 1468 - d. 1524), chapel of Calenberg Castle, Pattensen, Germany (original commission) [see note 1], until about 1636, probably by descent within the family, Calenberg Castle, about 1636, probably transferred to Leine Castle, Hanover [see note 2], between 1803 and 1811, dismantled and removed from Leine Castle [see note 3]. 1811, acquired by Bernhard Hausmann (b. 1784 - d. 1873), Hanover [see note 4], 1857, sold by Hausmann to Georg V (b. 1819 - d. 1878), King of Hanover [see note 5], until 2005, by descent within the royal family of Hanover [see note 6], 2005, sold by the royal house of Hanover, through Sotheby's, New York, to the MFA. (Accession Date: April 27, 2005);NOTES;[1] The earliest recorded account of the altarpiece at Calenberg Castle is that of M. Heinrich Bünting (Braunschweigische Chronik, 1584). He specifies that the donors represented in the main panel are Princess Katharina and Duke Erich, the coats-of-arms confirm this. For Bunting's account, see endnote below, this is taken from the German transcription by Bernhard Hausmann, Verzeichniss der Hausmann'schen Gemählde-Sammlung in Hannover (Hanover, 1831), pp. 123-24, footnote. Katharina died in 1524, suggesting the altarpiece had been commissioned by that date.;[2] In 1636 Georg von Braunschweig-Calenberg moved the seat of power to the city of Hanover (subsequently, Calenberg Castle was abandoned and, in 1690, torn down). Presumably the altarpiece was moved to the new princely residence at this time.;[3] Hausmann 1831 (see above and below, nn. 1 and 4) states that he found the altarpiece in pieces in Hanover in 1811, that is, during the French occupation of the city (1803-1813). During this time, Leine Castle was occupied by French troops and plundered. The altarpiece must have been dismantled and discarded or sold as a consequence.;[4] Hausmann described the altarpiece in his collection catalogue of 1831, see Hausmann 1831 (as above, n. 1), pp. 123-125, cat. no. 215a-c. He states that in 1811 he discovered the altarpiece in pieces in two junk shops in Hannover, saved them, and made them part of his collection.;[5] In 1857, Hausmann closed his gallery and sold the collection to Georg V. See Klaus Mlynek, \"Von Privaten zum Öffentlichen - Erste Museumsgründungen in der Residenzstadt Hannover,\" in 100 Jahre Kestner-Museum Hannover, 1889-1989, ed. Ulrich Gehrig (Hanover: Das Museum, 1989), 170.;[6] In 1861, Georg V used the works of art he purchased from Hausmann -- as well as other objects in the family's possession -- as the basis for the Welfenmuseum, the contents of which were entailed, or owned by and inherited within the family. In 1901 these objects formed the basis for the Fideikommissgalerie (\"entailed gallery\") at the Provinzialmuseum, Hanover. There the Calenberg Altarpiece was inventory no. 423. In 1924, it was removed by the family to their residence at the Schloss Blankenburg, Harz. This move coincided with the reorganization of the Provinzialmuseum, when parts of the Fideikommissgalerie were removed (and some were sold). In 1945, the family left Blankenburg and took its contents to the Schloss Marienburg, Hanover. See Hans Georg Gmelin, Spätgotische Tafelmalerei in Niedersachsen und Bremen (Munich and Berlin, 1974), p. 447, Mlynek 1989 (as above, n. 5), pp. 172-174, and Ines Katenhusen, \"150 Jahre Niedersächsisches Landesmuseum Hannover,\" in Das Niedersächsische Landesmuseum Hannover, ed. Heide Grape-Albers (Hanover, 2002), pp. 29, 34-35.;ADDITIONAL INFORMATION;Translation of Heinrich Bünting, Braunschweigische Chronik, 1584, taken from Bernhard Hausmann, Verzeichniss der Hausmann'schen Gemählde-Sammlung in Hannover (Hanover, 1831), pp. 123-124, footnote;It was the Princess Catherine, wife of Duke Eric the Elder, born to a very high princely house, for she was the daughter of the warlike Duke Albrecht of Saxony, a very devout princess, for her Princely Grace had commissioned the chapel in the House Calenberg, and also had the panel made, which was placed upon the altar.;On that same panel appear also the arms of her Princely Grace, the little Saxon crown made up of lozenge shapes, and across from these the arms of Braunschweig, and so they are also both, the Duke and the Princess, painted on [the panel], and an image of Mary sits in the center, and holds the small child Jesus in her lap. The Princess is painted in her raiment, as it was customary at that time, with bare neck and chest, adorned with precious jewels, gemstones and golden chains, and so her Princely Grace's ladies-in-waiting are sitting beside her, also dressed in the same manner.;Duke Eric the Elder sits facing her on the other side, painted in his entire cuirass, with a long brown velvet mantle, in a red velvet cap, adorned with a handsome long white feather. And even though the painting is rather old, still one sees indeed even so still unto this very day, that it must have been a very beautiful panel, upon which the Princess is in particular very painstakingly painted, with her lovely countenance and beautiful red cheeks.https://collections.mfa.org/objects/35483/saint-james-the-great-of-compostellaRichard von Kaufmann (b. 1849 - d. 1908), Berlin, December 4, 1917, Kaufmann sale, Cassirer and Helbing, Berlin, lot 133, to Walter von Pannwitz (d. 1920), Heemstede, The Netherlands [see note 1], transferred to The Aurora Trust [see note 2], July 6, 1966, Aurora Trust sale, Sotheby's, London, lot 72, to Thomas Agnew and Sons, Ltd., London, June 21, 1967, sold by Agnew to William A.

On the reverse of the frame is a label of Arnold Wiggins and Sons, Ltd., London, frame makers. While the earlier history of the painting has not been securely established, it is notable that an Assumption is recorded in the 1728 posthumous inventory of the artist: \"Un quadro dell'assunta con cornice negra. palmi 4 e 6 mano della Buona Anima.\" Inventory of July 27, 1728, Naples, published by Gérard Labrot, \"Collections of Paintings in Naples, 1600-1780\" (Munich: Saur, 1992), p. 353 (f. 2v, no. 60). The dimensions given (about 135.8 x 90.5 cm) are larger than those of the MFA painting (102.2 x 76.8 cm), though it is not known if the frame was included.

Though it was illustrated in the Katalog der Modernen Galerie Heinrich Thannhauser München, published in 1916 (see above, n. 4), it is still quite possible that Schmitz purchased the painting from Thannhauser in 1915, after the gallery catalogue went to press but before its publication in 1916. In 1931, Schmitz left Germany and moved his collection to Switzerland. It was exhibited at the Kunsthaus, Zürich, \"Sammlung Oscar Schmitz,\" January 14-February 14, 1932, cat. no. 45, as \"Rue dans une ville de Normandie.;[6] A large portion of the Schmitz collection was for sale as early as 1934.

This painting, however, does not appear in subsequent sales of paintings from the Comte Duchâtel collection.;[5] The painting was included in the exhibition held at Robert Lebel's gallery at 13, rue de Seine, Paris, \"Une Collection de Tableaux de Petits Maitres Hollandais & Flamands,\" December 11-28, 1934, cat. no. 25. An old photograph of the painting exists in Lebel's photographic archive, it is annotated on the back: \"Eglon van der Neer.;[6] Robert Lebel visited the MFA on October 8, 1943 and told curator W. G. Constable that he had sold this painting to Walter Westfeld around 1937. According to a letter from Walter Westfeld's brother to the MFA (February 6, 1944), Lebel had written to him in the fall of 1943 as well, stating that around 1935/1936 he had sold the painting to Westfeld, who had it at the Galerie Kleucker and \"at a time, in Amsterdam.\" A painting described as a Company Scene by Eglon van der Neer, which is probably the present painting, was exhibited at the Galerie August Kleucker, Düsseldorf, in mid-May, 1936.;[7] A photograph of the painting, supplied to the MFA by Silberman, bears W. R. Valentiner's authentication on the reverse, dated May 15, 1941. The painting was first offered to the MFA on June 3, 1941. A subsequent letter from dealer Abris Silberman to W. G. Constable of the MFA (June 3, 1942) states that \"the painting was brought to this country by a refugee some time ago\" but had never been in a U.S. collection. Attempts to determine when and how Silberman acquired the work have not been successful.;ADDITIONAL INFORMATION;In 1920 Walter Westfeld opened a gallery that bore his name in Elberfeld (present-day Wuppertal). However, under the Nazi regime he was forced to discontinue his business because he was Jewish, the Galerie Walter Westfeld officially closed on May 27, 1936. Several months later, his associate August Kleucker was put in charge of liquidating the gallery stock through the Galerie Kleucker in Düsseldorf. It is not known whether this painting had formed part of Westfeld's gallery stock or whether he owned it privately, thus it is not known if it was part of the 1936 liquidation through Kleucker. In the fall of 1937, Westfeld was forced to turn over to the Gestapo a list of all the works of art still in his possession, the Van der Neer does not appear on this list. Whether it was no longer in Westfeld's possession at this time, or had been deliberately left off the list, is uncertain.;In November 1938 Westfeld was arrested for foreign exchange violations. He was subsequently found guilty of having -- after the closure of his gallery -- illegally shipped works of art and other assets abroad, to Paris and Amsterdam, and of continuing to sell his own works of art through Kleucker. Whether the Van der Neer left his possession in one of these ways is not known. According to correspondence from a family member to the MFA (November 11, 2004), Westfeld had paintings and other valuables at the Rotterdamse Wisselbank in Amsterdam as late as 1939, again, it is not known if the Van der Neer could have been among these. The valuables were apparently taken unlawfully and sold during World War II, and remain untraced.;In 1939 Nazi authorities seized Westfeld's remaining art assets in Germany and auctioned them through Lempertz, Cologne, on December 12-13, 1939. The Van der Neer painting was not included in this sale.;After Westfeld's trial in Nazi Germany, he served a prison sentence at Lüttringhausen. In 1942 he was sent to the Theresienstadt concentration camp and, in 1943, to Auschwitz. He was declared deceased at the end of World War II.;In June, 2011 the MFA reached a financial settlement with the heirs and the estate of Walter Westfeld for the Portrait of a Man and Woman in an Interior, allowing the work to remain at the museum. This was based on a review of the above research, which outlines a limited number of ways the painting could have left his possession. It seems unlikely that Westfeld gave or sold the painting voluntarily after the closure of his gallery in May, 1936. Rather, as a Jewish art dealer living in Nazi Germany, he probably disposed of it due to persecution.;Bibliography: Herbert Schmidt, Der Elendsweg der Düsseldorfer Juden: Chronologie des Schreckens, 1933-1945 (Düsseldorf: Droste, 2005), pp. 273-278, Victoria S.
