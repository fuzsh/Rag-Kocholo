        "text": "Johannes Müller wanted to offer his guests the possibility to take a vacation from their self and become aware of silence as the true essence of their being by listening or dancing to classical music or listening to the deafing sounds of silent mountains and rushing streams in prstine nature.\n\nCritical of individualism, materialism and capitalism, Müller was also an ardent opponent of both the established church. For him, Jesus was the “Conqueror of Religions” and “childlike oblivion of the self”, the prerequisite for fulfilling the promise of salvation on earth contained in the Sermon on the Mount. He has been a fervent opponent of anthroposophy, which he descibned as a dangerous attempt of “divinization of men by men” or in ohter words \"men trying to deify themselves\". He also regarded meditation or any attempt of self-optimization as an obstacle to true self realization.\n\nIn 1933 Johannes Müller transposed, in contradiction to his imperative of abstraction – according to which God was in, but not of this world – his religious ideal of freedom from the “Self” to the totalitarian political ideal of subordinating the “I\" under the “We” of a “community of brothers looking after one another”. To the complete surprise especially of his many Jewish guests, Müller thus came to consider Hitler, whom he had ignored until then, to be the leader of a “national revolution of the common good over self-interest” because of the Nazi leader’s declaration Du bist nichts; dein Volk ist alles (“You are nothing; your people are everything”). However, Müller believed this revolution could succeed only with the help of the Jews as the “better Germans” and “the most noble representatives of the intellectual elite.” His public criticism of antisemitism, which he called a “disgrace for Germany,” kept him and his children from joining the party and not to allow the \"Hitler Gruß\" in Schloss Elmau. Yet because of his appeal to follow Hitler, his criticism of the Nazis’ antisemitism did not result in his immediate detention in Dachau, but only in his publications and speaking tours being limited and finally forbidden. The Staatskanzlei of the Bavarian Government had convinced Goebbels that his paradoxical simultaneous praise of Hitler and Jews actually added moral credibility to his support of Hitler and should therefore be seen as an advantage for the party.\n\nIn 1935 the University of Leipzig wanted to strip Johannes Müller of his PhD because of his critique of antisemitism, though this was prevented by an intervention by the famous philosopher Hans-Georg Gadamer, who was one of his admirers.\n\nIn 1942, to preempt its threatened confiscation by the SS, he leased Schloss Elmau to the Wehrmacht as a “vacation resort for soldiers returning from the front.” In 1943 the office in charge of the concentration camp Sachsenhausen requested his arrest due to his ongoing praise for the Jews, however, probably due to the intervention by former interior minister Wilhelm Frick, who himself had never been to Schloss Elmau, but who had family members which were admirers of Johannes Müller, he was put under house arrest only.\n\nIn 1946 the Bavarian state commissioner for persons subject to racist, religious and political persecution, Dr Philipp Auerbach, sued for a denazification case to be brought against Johannes Müller in Garmisch-Partenkirchen on the grounds of “glorification of Hitler both orally and in writing”.\n\nThe case was found against Müller, based on the claim that his public criticism of the Nazis’ antisemitism had, paradoxically, reinforced the effect of his support for Hitler. But the verdict was seen as controversial, and a call for the immediate expropriation of his property failed—not only because Countess Waldersee refused to sell her share of the property, but also because Müller had been neither a member of the Nazi Party nor been involved in any acts of war. The laws governing liberation from National Socialism and militarism therefore provided no legal grounds for a conviction or punishment.\n\nSince 1998 Schloss Elmau has also become a venue for intellectual and political debates about Liberty and its Enemies with renowned scholars of Political Philosophy, Political Theology and the History of Ideas in cooperation with Christoph Schmidt, Professor of Philosophy at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem; Saul Friedländer, Professor of History of the Holocaus at the University of California in Los Angeles, Professor Gabriel Motzkin, Head of the Van Leer Institute in Jerusalem; Professor Dan Diner, Professor of History at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem and Director of the Simon Dubnow Institute of Jewish History in Leipzig and Michael Brenner, Professor of Jewish History at the University of Munich.\n\nIn 1999 philosopher Peter Sloterdijk gave a speech at the Schloss Elmau Symposium on Political Theology with the title “Beyond Being”, dealing with Emanuel Levinas’ criticism of the lack of ethics in Martin Heidegger’s ontology, entitled “Rules for the Human Park”, later referred to as “the Elmau Speech”. The reactions of Saul Friedländer and Jürgen Habermas led to an unparalleled public debate in the German-language press over several months about the ethical limits of genetic engineering. That resulted int he establishment of a National Ethics Council by the Social Democrat government under Gerhard Schröder. The first and only public meeting of the Council then took place in Schloss Elmau.\n\nShortly before, Friedländer chaired the Schloss Elmau Symposium on “Wagner in the Third Reich”, in which -- for the first time -- almost all of the recognised pro- and anti-Wagner experts participated. The symposium was hailed by the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper as an overdue debate on the ideological roots of National Socialism and the politically fateful role of Bayreuth in the Third Reich. The lectures were subsequently published by C. H. Beck as a book with the same title.\n\nSince 2001 Schloss Elmau has regularly hosted a Jewish Tarbut conference under the direction of Dr. Rachel Salamander and Professor Michael Brenner, where leading Jewish intellectuals from all over the world meet with members of the Jewish communities from Germany, Austria and Switzerland.\n\nSince 2002 regular Transatlantic Forums have been staged by the German Marshall Fund (GMF) of Washington led by the late Dr Ron Asmus, Craig Kennedy and Dr. Karen Donfried. During the forum in June 2005, Chancellor, Dr Angela Merkel gave a vigorously debated lecture about the relationship between Turkey and the European Union. The late Richard Holbrooke, who has been sspecial envoy for Eastern Euopre under President G.W. Bush and Barack Obama, Dr. Ron Asmus, who has been the architect of Nato Expansion and former Swedish Prime Minister Calrd Bildt, led seversal secret meetings with presidents and politicians from Eastern European Countries, Gerogia and Ukraine, who wanted to become member of NATO and the EU to prevent war with Russia and protect liberty."
