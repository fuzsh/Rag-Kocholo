At the turn of the twentieth century, the region gave birth to modern psychology, philosophy, economics and music, and since then has played an important mediating role between Western and Eastern Europe, today participating as a critical member of the European Union. The volumes in this series address specific themes and questions around the history, culture, politics, social and economic experience of Austria, the Habsburg Empire, and its successor states in Central and Eastern Europe.

For a further grant we thank the National Fund of the Republic of Austria for Victims of National Socialism (Nationalfonds der Republik Österreich für Opfer des Nationalsozialismus). In our research, we received invaluable assistance from the Documentation Centre of Austrian Resistance (Dokumentationsarchiv des österreichischen Widerstandes, DÖW) and its director Gerhard Baumgartner, and from staff of the Austrian Research Agency for Post-War Justice (Forschungsstelle Nachkriegsjustiz: Winfried Garscha, Claudia Kuretsidis-Haider, Siegfried Sanwald), which is closely associated with the DÖW, and at all stages of the project we were the beneficiaries of highly competent support given by DÖW staff, in particular Dr Christa Mehany. We are obliged to the director and relevant staff members of the Municipal and Provincial Archives of Vienna (Wiener Stadt- und Landesarchiv) and the Austrian State Archive (Österreichisches Staatsarchiv) for making relevant archive holdings available to us. In this regard we also extend our thanks to foreign archives, in particular the Federal Archives (Bundesarchiv), Berlin, and the Archives of the Republic of Slovenia, Ljubljana. For valuable input and for allowing us to consult documents in their possession, we offer sincere thanks to our historian colleagues Hans Schafranek, Peter Pirker, Hans Hautmann (†), Manfred Mugrauer, Josef Vogl and Wilhelm Mensing. We are likewise indebted to John Nicholson and Nick Somers for their English translation, and we thank Matthäus Zinner for kindly adapting three German diagrams for the English edition. We wish to express our special gratitude to the publisher of the original German edition, Heribert Steinbauer – who as a child witnessed the Vienna Gestapo conducting\n\nx\n\n|\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nsearches at his family home – for generously ceding the rights for the English edition to Berghahn Books. We thank Marion Berghahn for agreeing to include our book in her catalogue, and her staff members Sulaiman Ahmad, Chris Chappell, Mykelin Higham and Caroline Kuhtz for their attentive and conscientious work in seeing the present volume through to publication.\n\nNotes on Text and Transliteration\n\nd I\n\nn some cases, Russian names are not transliterated according to an Englishlanguage system but, rather, as they appear in the archival sources (e.g. ‘Ostarbeiter’ such as Iwan Schelasko, Igor Truskowski and others). Likewise, the ß is retained in German names (e.g. Seyß-Inquart). Police and SS ranks have been left in German. For a list of the Gestapo ranks and corresponding SS ranks, see Chapter 5, n. 49. Military ranks have also been left in German. For British equivalents, see Wikipedia. Vienna is divided up by ‘district’ (‘Bezirk’). The 1st district is the inner city within the Ring, which is surrounded by the 2nd to 9th districts. Outside these are the 10th to 23rd districts. Under the National Socialists, the city borders were expanded to form the Reichsgau of Vienna, with three further districts. Of the many words and expressions rendered in German, the great majority are jargon or colloquialisms specific to the Nazi regime, for example, Wehrkraftzersetzung, Ostarbeiter, Rassenschande or ‘Altreich’. When these are not put in quotation marks, this is not to suggest that they form part of normal German discourse.\n\nAbbreviations\n\nd AdR: Archiv der Republik / Archive of the Republic (of Austria).

The expression ‘Gestapo methods’ has gone into common parlance as a damning political insult. The Vienna Gestapo was the most important instrument of Nazi terror on Austrian soil. It was responsible for combating all forms of resistance, organized and non-organized, and played a leading part in the persecution of the Jewish population. It treated all who violated Nazi norms with unrelenting severity, and was particularly brutal towards foreign forced labourers. Founded in 1938 with the official full name ‘Geheime Staatspolizei – Staatspolizeileitstelle Wien’, it was the biggest Gestapo office with the exception of the central head office in Berlin: until 1939 the secret state police office (Geheimes Staatspolizeiamt, Gestapa) and thereafter Amt IV of the Reich security main office (Reichssicherheitshauptamt, RSHA). The word ‘Leitstelle’ in the Vienna Gestapo’s official name literally means ‘leading office’, and it is translated in the present volume as ‘regional headquarters’. With a staff of over nine hundred, the Vienna Gestapo was numerically the largest Gestapo ‘Leitstelle’ in the German Reich, and bigger than Berlin or Prague. It was also second to none in the number of arrests it made, which amounted to around fifty thousand. The arrestees were commonly subjected to brutal interrogations and torture before being either committed to concentration camps or handed over to the courts to be tried. The area of competence of the Vienna Gestapo extended over the eastern part of annexed Austria – that is to say, over the former federal provinces of Vienna, Lower Austria and (north) Burgenland – and the parts of former Czechoslovakia incorporated into the Reichsgau ‘Lower Danube’ (Niederdonau). It had a total population of over 3.5 million, which was more than half the population of Austria at the time (1939 census: 6.65 million inhabitants, 6.88 million including the incorporated territories). On account of the Reich’s new borders with\n\n2 | The Vienna Gestapo, 1938–1945\n\n(rump) Czechoslovakia (or, after the latter’s occupation, with the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia and with Slovakia) and Hungary, the Vienna Gestapo acquired further important responsibilities and tasks, especially as it was also in charge of the border police and its stations and border posts. Writing the history of the Vienna Gestapo – including the post-war prosecution (or nonprosecution) of its former officials – is thus an important task, to which it is hoped that the present volume will be a valuable contribution. There are numerous publications on the Nazi police machinery in the ‘Altreich’ (i.e. Germany in its pre-1938 borders): with regard to the Gestapo, see among others the seminal studies by Gerhard Paul/Klaus-Michael Mallmann and Robert Gellately, and the admirably concise account by Carsten Dams/Michael Stolle.1 On the Gestapo in Austria, by contrast, there are only a few. In 1991, Franz Weisz presented an extensive doctoral thesis on the Vienna Gestapo, which was meritorious for its recording and analysis of important source materials, in particular the post-war trials of Vienna Gestapo officials by the Vienna Volksgericht, and this performed important preparatory work for the present volume. However, because of its lack of analyses and historical contextualization, Weisz’s thesis had, to a large extent, the character of a voluminous, unstructured and uncommented collection of material, and therefore could not be published.2 Important findings concerning central figures of the Vienna Gestapo have been provided in the degree dissertation and doctoral thesis of Thomas Mang, his dissertation being on the head of the section colloquially known as the Judenreferat (‘Jewish section’) Karl Ebner, and his thesis on Vienna Gestapo head Franz Josef Huber.3 These studies also shed light on the part played by the Vienna Gestapo in the deportations of Jews from Vienna from February 1941, which is still insufficiently recognized, and the strategy of ‘reinsurance’ successfully implemented by Ebner and Huber, which enabled these two heavily incriminated Gestapo officials to survive the prosecutions of the post-war era. Two further Vienna University degree dissertations have been devoted to important Vienna Gestapo officials: one by Christine Cézanne-Thauss on intelligence section head Lambert Leutgeb, and the second on the department head Othmar Trenker.4 A number of thoroughly researched studies on the Vienna Gestapo’s system of informers have been published by Hans Schafranek, who has presented and analysed the devastating impact of the infiltration of undercover agents into the ranks of the resistance groups.5 In this connection, finally, mention must be made of the research studies published by the Dokumentationsarchiv des österreichischen Widerstandes (Documentation centre of Austrian resistance, DÖW) and publications by Wolfgang Neugebauer, which primarily focus on the resistance but at the same time provide a great deal of information about the activity of the Vienna Gestapo.6 An extensive source base has been created through the digitalization and partial publication on the DÖW website of the Vienna Gestapo’s identification\n\nIntroduction | 3\n\ncard index (‘Erkennungsdienstliche Kartei’, preserved at the Wiener Stadt- und Landesarchiv) and the online publication of the Vienna Gestapo daily reports (now only accessible to institutions under licence, see Bibliography);7 however, while these sources are relevant for research into resistance and repression, and were duly utilized for the present publication, they provide hardly any information on the internal structure of the Vienna Gestapo, or on the individuals responsible for its crimes. Our interest in Gestapo research was the result of decades devoted to the subject of resistance and repression in the Nazi period. In the course of her many years as DÖW archivist, Elisabeth Boeckl-Klamper evaluated all the Gestapo documents archived or acquired for archiving there, and played a leading role in the creation of the newly designed memorial room and exhibition in the Leopold Figl-Hof apartment block at the site of the former Vienna Gestapo headquarters on Morzinplatz, also acting as editor for its website and publication.8 In addition to the above-mentioned studies, Thomas Mang has published biographical accounts of Franz Josef Huber and Karl Ebner, the two most important officials of the Vienna Gestapo.9 Wolfgang Neugebauer conducted and published numerous studies on Nazi terror during his many years as director of the DÖW, focusing particularly on the Gestapo’s role in the suppression of resistance; in addition, as honorary professor of contemporary history at Vienna University, he lectured and supervised several degree dissertations and doctoral theses on the Gestapo. Our goal – on the basis of our knowledge and the current findings of research in Austrian and foreign archives and other international research – was to compose as comprehensive as possible an account of the Vienna Gestapo in the years 1938–45, with a presentation and analysis not only of the victims of persecution and repression but also of the structures, organization and individuals actively involved on the Gestapo side, and with at least a rough picture of what became of the perpetrators in the post-war period. The present volume starts by presenting the development of the Gestapo into the Nazi regime’s central instrument of repression, culminating in the foundation of RSHA in Berlin, and the process of fusion – promoted by Reichsführer-SS Himmler – of the security police (Sicherheitspolizei, or ‘Sipo’ – i.e. the Gestapo and the criminal investigation police (Kriminalpolizei, or ‘Kripo’)), the regular uniformed police or ‘order’ police (Ordnungspolizei, or ‘Orpo’), and the SS. The section on the RSHA (and its forerunner agency the Gestapa) is relevant in that in 1938 the Vienna Gestapo was modelled exactly on the Berlin office, the structure of which was laid down in a ‘business distribution plan’ (Geschäftsverteilungsplan, GVP), and when the GVP changed in 1942 and 1944, the changes were also implemented in Vienna. Notwithstanding the dominance of the Berlin central offices, which at the beginning at least appointed ‘Reich Germans’ to leading positions in the Vienna Gestapo, the present volume gives detailed\n\n4 | The Vienna Gestapo, 1938–1945\n\nconsideration to the active part played by Austrian National Socialists (who until March 1938 were members of a prohibited political party and thus ‘illegals’) in the overthrow of the Vienna police and to the recruitment into the Gestapo of officials of the pre-annexation Austrian police, with particular attention to the additional incorporation of Gestapo officials into the SS. The Vienna Gestapo staff structure is investigated on the basis of statistical data, with consideration given to the role played by women on the Gestapo staff. One special aspect of the study is the presentation of the criminal methods employed by the Vienna Gestapo, including the systematic use of torture to extract confessions and coerce victims into betraying fellow resisters, and committals to concentration camps; in this context, a special chapter is devoted to the most efficient method of suppression used by the Vienna Gestapo, namely, the extensive deployment of informers. Another special focus is laid upon denunciations. As a contribution to the ongoing debate on this subject, the extent of denunciation and the composition of the denouncers are analysed in order to assess the place and importance of denunciation in this historical context. A number of substantial chapters focus on the fate of the Vienna Gestapo’s victims, the most important categories being political and religious opponents and resistance fighters, Jews, young oppositionals, persons stigmatized as ‘asocials’, and last but not least the foreign forced labourers, who have hitherto been wrongly neglected in Gestapo research. In connection with this group, a special chapter is devoted to the ‘(forced) labour education camp’ (Arbeitserziehungslager, AEL) of Oberlanzendorf, which was de facto a Vienna Gestapo concentration camp. Furthermore, an ample account is given of the Vienna Gestapo’s part in the persecution of the Jews, which in some publications has been underestimated in comparison with that of the ‘Central Office for the Emigration of Jews in Vienna’ established by Adolf Eichmann; in particular, an account is given of the critical initiative undertaken by Gauleiter Baldur von Schirach in collaboration with Vienna Gestapo head Franz Josef Huber that led directly to the deportations. Particular attention is also devoted to the history of the building on Morzinplatz that served as the Vienna Gestapo headquarters – from the construction of the Hotel Metropole in 1872/73 through to its seizure in 1938 and final destruction from direct hits in the bombing of 1945. In the relevant chapter, a lengthy section is devoted to the two most prominent figures to have been detained at Morzinplatz – former Austrian federal chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg and the banker Louis Rothschild. Equally detailed attention is paid to the first transport of Austrians to Dachau in 1938 and to later mass arrests, notably before the outbreak of war in 1939 and after the assassination attempt and resistance operation of 20 July 1944. In the concluding chapters, accounts are given of the part played by the Vienna Gestapo in the end-phase crimes of 1945 – for example, the murder of captured American pilots – and of the end\n\nIntroduction | 5\n\nof the Vienna Gestapo regional headquarters, which was given up without a fight, its protagonists retreating or going underground after taking all possible measures to destroy evidence of their deeds. Finally, the volume concludes with a critical account of the way in which the Austrian and German judiciary and the denazification bodies dealt with the crimes of the Vienna Gestapo and its officials. The volume also considers five key issues of Gestapo research: 1. The ‘Gestapo myth’ – that is to say, the idea cultivated and propagated by Himmler and Heydrich of the security police being ubiquitous and all-powerful. It has played an important role in modern Gestapo research (Paul/Mallmann 1995, Gellately 1990, and others). While the deconstruction of this myth is in itself right and good, it does run the risk of tending to make light of or underestimate the work carried out by the Gestapo. It was thus an important concern for us to examine the effectiveness and efficiency of the Gestapo, its ‘success’, which we have done principally in relation to its suppression of resistance. 2. Denunciations. As a result of certain far-reaching interpretations, denunciations from the general public have been perceived as being of high importance for the evaluation not only of the Gestapo but of the Nazi regime as a whole. In particular, this has led to a tendency to relativize the dictatorial character of the Nazi regime (by invoking the existence of a ‘nationalsozialistischer Volksstaat’ or ‘National Socialist people’s state’). The extent of such denunciations, the social and political categorization of the denouncers, and the contexts in which the denunciations were made are thus important thematic areas for the present study. 3. Austrian perpetrators. Not only was the proportion of Austrians amongst Nazi perpetrators generally played down in the post-war era but apologias, such as that of Vienna Gestapo deputy head Karl Ebner, made light of their crimes by claiming that the Austrian Gestapo officials were far more moderate than their German colleagues. In the present publication, the subject of Austrian perpetrators is thus not considered merely in terms of statistics: attention is also given to the questions of whether it is possible to demonstrate differences in the procedures followed by Austrian and German officials, whether the distinction was of any relevance at all in practice, and to what extent tensions or conflicts developed. 4. ‘Reinsurance’. The leading officials of the Vienna Gestapo, Franz Josef Huber and Karl Ebner, both pursued the strategy of ‘reinsurance’ by giving favourable treatment to prominent detainees, especially from the Catholic-conservative camp, with a view to guaranteeing their own sur-\n\n6 | The Vienna Gestapo, 1938–1945\n\nvival after the end of the Nazi regime. A special section is devoted to the presentation and analysis of this – ultimately successful – strategy. 5. Women perpetrators? Researchers into National Socialism are increasingly using the gendered term ‘TäterInnen’ (‘male and female perpetrators’), which tends to imply that women had a substantial share in the crimes of the Nazi regime, and even to put them on the same level as the men. By contrast, this volume establishes the actual number of women who worked for the Vienna Gestapo and their position in the hierarchy, and investigates the occasional instances of women participating in criminal acts. When it came to the collapse of the Nazi regime, the leading Vienna Gestapo officials sought to erase all evidence of their crimes by setting about destroying the entire body of files, which they almost succeeded in doing. Fortunately for historians, however, the great majority of the Vienna Gestapo daily reports were in fact preserved, as copies were always sent to other NS authorities – not just to offices in Vienna but also to central offices in Berlin, where the Allies subsequently took possession of them and where they are now preserved in the German federal archives. An important secondary body of source material is provided by the records of the NS courts (VGH, Vienna OLG, Vienna SG; see list of abbreviations), as these often contain surveillance records, the findings of police investigations, accusations made by the Vienna Gestapo when reporting individuals to the prosecutors, and sometimes the testimonies of Gestapo officials. Arguably the most important source for the history of the Vienna Gestapo is the records of the post-war Vienna Volksgericht (People’s Court, 1945–55), which are preserved in the Wiener Stadt- und Landesarchiv (WStLA). The documents relating to the police’s investigations and preparatory research provide information on the organizational structure, training of officials, and administration of the Vienna Gestapo, and not least on its methods as it went about tasks ranging from the processing of complaints and the evaluation of informers’ reports through to the systematic use of torture during interrogations. The judgments, statements of defendants and witnesses, and records of the main court proceedings combine to provide a comprehensive picture, which nevertheless for obvious reasons calls for critical interpretation. An important complementary source was the ‘Gau files’ of the NSDAP (the Nazi party) held in the Austrian state archives, which provided essential information, in particular on the biographies of individual Gestapo officials. Another source that turned out to be relevant was the archival holdings of Department I, state police department, Vienna police headquarters (Abteilung I, Staatspolizeiliche Abteilung, Bundespolizeidirektion Wien), which contain not only the – sadly few – extant original documents of the Vienna Gestapo, but also documents about the Vienna Gestapo drawn up after 1945 by the\n\nIntroduction | 7\n\nAustrian state police; immediately after the collapse of the Nazi regime, these two holdings of documents formed the basis for the tracking down and detention of former Vienna Gestapo officials. At the German federal archives, the holdings of the RSHA and the former US Berlin Document Center were particularly revealing sources for the present study. Another foreign state archive that – surprisingly – turned out to be an important source of information was the archives of the Republic of Slovenia in Ljubljana, which holds a number of key documents on Vienna Gestapo officials stemming from police investigations and court proceedings in former Yugoslavia, in particular against Lambert Leutgeb, head of the Vienna Gestapo intelligence section. Important documents relating to the participation of the Vienna Gestapo and its head Franz Josef Huber in the preparations for the mass deportation of Vienna’s Jewish population were found in the ‘Austria Collection’ of the Institute for Holocaust Research of Yad Vashem. From the National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC, the most relevant items were the microfilms of the Vienna Gestapo’s daily reports, which were in fact published many years ago. Since then, all the extant Vienna Gestapo daily reports have been made available online (‘Deutsche Geschichte im 20. Jahrhundert Online’, access now only possible under licence and to institutions). Even in a volume of this length, it has not been possible to deal with all aspects of the subject thoroughly. Among the aspects insufficiently explored are the activities of the Vienna Gestapo units responsible for espionage and counterintelligence, of the Gestapo branch offices, and of the border police stations and border posts; furthermore, the crimes committed by Vienna Gestapo officials in the occupied territories of Europe have been accorded little attention by historians and are dealt with here only through a number of representative examples. Other subjects requiring further research include the inadequate judicial prosecution of Vienna Gestapo officials, likewise presented here only in case studies relating to certain important figures, and the reintegration of former Gestapo officials into Austrian society after the waning of the anti-fascist spirit, characteristic of 1945.\n\nNotes 1.

However, this goal could not be achieved simultaneously in all the federal states (‘Länder’) of the Reich: first, the Nazis had to take control of the Prussian police, which with its manpower of fifty thousand was the strongest of all the federal state forces. To this end, on the same day, 30 January 1933, Hermann Göring, as the second most powerful figure after Hitler, was appointed Reich commissioner for the Prussian interior ministry and thus also chief of the political police. The Prussian secret police thereby created was to become the germ cell of, and subsequently the binding model for, the secret state police (Geheime Staatspolizei, Gestapo) later organized uniformly throughout the Reich; in fact, ‘Geheime Reichspolizei’ was even one of the proposed names for it.1 With the so-called Reichstag Fire Decree of 28 February 1933,2 the basic rights contained in the Weimar Constitution were suspended and the foundations laid for National Socialist police law. The ‘permanent state of legal emergency’ in the battle ‘between the National Socialist state and its mortal enemies’3 had begun: not for nothing did the jurist and political scientist Ernst Fraenkel describe the decree as the ‘constitutional charter of the Third Reich’.4 The first Gestapo law of 26 April 1933 and the establishment of the secret state\n\n10 | The Vienna Gestapo, 1938–1945\n\npolice office (Geheimes Staatspolizeiamt, Gestapa) brought about a further and essential extension of the powers of the political police. By this time, the Gestapo, under the direction of Göring’s protégé Rudolf Diels, had thus already acquired the status of a special authority; furthermore, it was placed directly under the control of Göring, now prime minister of Prussia. Shortly after the takeover of power, the realization of the potential of a political police force under the aegis of the Nazi state led to a power struggle between the various institutions involved. Göring wanted to extend his Prussian political police uniformly throughout the Reich, which conflicted with the interests of Reich interior minister Wilhelm Frick. What Frick envisaged was a ‘centralized Reich police into which, however, the Prussian political police was also to be integrated’. One way or the other, the Gauleiters and heads of government of the federal states feared that the centralization of the political police would reduce their powers. One particularly serious problem was that of the SA (Sturmabteilung, assault division), which not only laid claim to be the official Nazi ‘Wehrmacht’ (armed force) and thus successor to the Reichswehr but was also ‘apparently presenting its reign of terror in the unauthorized concentration camps as the activity of a state police force’.5 That final outcome – the creation of a unified political police for the whole Reich under the leadership of Heinrich Himmler – was essentially the result of the overthrow of the SA in the operation of 30 June 1934 in which Hitler had Ernst Röhm and other SA leaders murdered, with a leading role being played by Himmler’s SS. Subsequently – ‘in recognition of its outstanding services’ – the SS was separated from the SA, to which it had formerly belonged, and given the status of an NSDAP organization in its own right. The Gestapo’s critical contribution to the rapid erosion of constitutional norms came principally through its possession of a special executive instrument of its own in the form of ‘Schutzhaft’ or ‘protective custody’, which enabled it to arrest suspects and hold them in detention without a court ruling.6 Given that the Gestapo had other police bodies at its beck and call, it could mobilize hundreds of police officers at short notice. As a result, it arrested over thirty thousand people between March and June 1933, mainly Communists, Social Democrats and trade unionists. Originally, the duration of protective custody was limited to three months, and there was, in theory at least, the possibility of appealing against its imposition. However, even the Reichstag Fire Decree enabled protective custody to be imposed for an unlimited period and with no right of appeal. A year later – by which time Himmler was head of the Prussian political police and Reinhard Heydrich head of the Gestapa – the Gestapo’s monopoly over protective custody was confirmed. Neither the NSDAP, the SA nor the SS had the power to take people into protective custody. As a rule, the imposition of protective custody meant committal to a concentration camp. A later decree defined it as a ‘coercive\n\nThe Gestapo as the Central Terror Instrument of the Nazi Regime | 11\n\nmeasure of the secret state police’ against people ‘who by their behaviour endanger the security of Volk and state’.7 The jurist and ‘Gestapo ideologist-in-chief ’ Werner Best defined the competence of the Gestapo as covering tasks concerned with ‘police investigations in matters of high treason, state treason and explosives [i.e. sabotage] and related to other criminal attacks on party and state. However, more important than the prosecution of offences committed is their prevention’.8 The Gestapo was thus not just a law enforcement body acting in the service of the judiciary: its terror was founded above all on its preventive policing tasks.\n\nThe Privilege of a Space to Operate Outside the Law The victims of the Gestapo had no legal security at all, because arrests and concentration camp committals did not require proof of an offence or criminal behaviour: mere suspicion was enough. The Gestapo operated in a space outside the law – it possessed, to quote Ernst Fraenkel, ‘a competence over competence, independent of the courts’.9 On this basis, the Gestapo developed into an organ that had the authority to monitor and revise court judgments but was itself free from any control: if someone was convicted by a court of law, but in the eyes of the Gestapo too leniently sentenced, it took the prosecution into its own hands, committing the convicts to concentration camps or ordering their execution. The third Gestapo law of 10 February 1936 ratified the establishment of the Gestapa as an autonomous special authority, and the political police became a constitutive component of the Nazi state. Paragraph 1 defined the task of the Gestapo as, ‘to investigate and combat all activities dangerous to the state [staatsgefährlich] throughout its territory, and to collect and evaluate the results of those investigations’. As the Gestapo researchers Dams and Stolle point out, the use of the word staatsgefährlich as opposed to staatsfeindlich (hostile to the state) ‘allowed for a broad scale when defining one’s opponents’.10 The power to define who was to be regarded as staatsgefährlich lay solely with the Gestapo. The vision of the police as an ‘internal Wehrmacht’ outside the law had won the day: the incorporation of the political police into the state administrative structure and its subordination to the legal system – as had been the case until then, at least de jure – was now turned on its head. The Nazi understanding of law was now no longer based on the protection of the individual and the equality of all citizens before the law but on the priority of protecting the (supposed) interests of the Volksgemeinschaft (ethnic community). Paragraph 7 of the third Gestapo law made it crystal clear: ‘Decisions and regulations of the Geheime Staatspolizei are not subject to review by the administrative courts’. As a result, in its dealings with political opponents, the Gestapo acquired powers similar to those of the judiciary. In no circumstances was it to\n\n12 | The Vienna Gestapo, 1938–1945\n\nbe obstructed in its freedom of action by ‘unpolitical’ organs such as courts. For Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler – by Hitler’s decree of 17 June 1936 also chief of the German police in the Reich ministry of the interior – the police did not derive its powers ‘from individual laws but … from the tasks entrusted to it by the leadership. On this account, its powers may not be hampered by formal obstacles’.11 It was above all Werner Best who had the task of safeguarding the Gestapo against rival authorities and defending its position as an autonomous institution, unfettered by norms. For a time Heydrich’s deputy at the Gestapa, Best was an unconditional and unscrupulous disciple of Nazi ideology. At the same time, he was a brilliant jurist who represented the prototype of a new leadership elite that contrasted strongly with the senior functionaries of the ‘Kampfzeit’ prior to 1933. Instead of the ‘liberalistic’ view of life, with its emphasis on the protection of the individual, Best championed the völkisch view: ‘The völkischorganic worldview does not see the original (primary) reality of human life in the individual human being … but in the Volk’.12 The purpose of the state was to preserve the ‘power of the Volk’ (Volkskraft) and promote its development. The state’s activity was expressed by the ‘will of the Leader’ (Führerwille), which was binding, lawful and just, without regard for formalities.\n\nFrom the Normative State to the Prerogative State The arrogation of traditional state functions in accordance with the ideology of the NSDAP necessitated a complete reinterpretation of the classical concept of a constitution. The task of the constitution was no longer to order the rights and duties of the individual but to regulate the organism of the Volk as a whole. This no longer had anything to do with ‘law’ or ‘justice’ but, rather, with what Best called a ‘primal and pre-legal creative and formative will’. Even today, the role model for a dictatorship is that of law proceeding from the ‘people’, personified by a quasi-democratically legitimized ‘leader’ figure. This transformation is vividly illustrated by the example of the Gestapo: in a very short time, under political pressure, what had been an institution of the ‘normative state’ (Ernst Fraenkel) – and as such bound by the principles of the separation of legislature, executive and judiciary and of lawgiving – mutated into an institution of the National Socialist ‘prerogative state’.13 As Best apodictically put it, ‘the normative legal regulation of the means to be used by a political police force [is] just as impossible as it is to foresee every kind of attack that could be made by enemies of the state … at any time in the future’.14 To put it more simply, any legal limitation on the Gestapo’s methods was unthinkable, because it had to be prepared to react flexibly to ‘every kind of attack’. In the fight against the ‘enemy within’ – like the Wehrmacht in the battle against the ‘enemy\n\nThe Gestapo as the Central Terror Instrument of the Nazi Regime | 13\n\nwithout’ – it had to be freed from ‘all fixed and invariable legal forms’ if it was to fulfil its task. In other words, the Gestapo was to act in a ‘norm-free’ space in order to protect the functions of the norm-bound state. By fighting the ‘destructive forces’ without being inhibited by statutory norms, the Gestapo enabled the state to act in accordance with the norms when dealing with the Volk’s ‘positive forces’. The deriving of police law from ‘völkisch laws of life’ constituted the ideological foundation for the terror measures of the SS/police machinery – right through to the extermination of European Jewry. Hostile, ‘degenerative’ elements within the German Volk or other peoples were obstacles to the vision of a ‘healthy Volksgemeinschaft’ and thus had to be eliminated. While Wilhelm Stuckart, state secretary in the Reich interior ministry and co-drafter of the Nuremberg Laws, referred to the Jews as the ‘ferment of decomposition’,15 Heydrich talked of the ‘residue of an infection’ that had to be eliminated, meaning thereby the remains of ‘Jewish, liberal and Masonic’ influence, which were summarized in his mind in one single enemy, namely, Judaism, the goal of which ‘for ever remains … domination of the world’. Like Best, Heydrich also invested hard thought in establishing an enemy stereotype for the Nazi mind, noting that according to the ‘liberalist-democratic’ way of thinking, Staatsfeinde (enemies of the state) had been those who were combated by the rulers of state. Changing governments and power-holders thus had – in accordance with the colour of the respective government – changing Staatsfeinde. But it was quite different with National Socialism, which knew only one kind of enemy, the ‘enemy of the Volk’, the Volksfeind.16 Himmler made a distinction between two types of Volksfeind, namely: ‘People who on account of degeneration of either body or soul have separated themselves from the natural structures that make up the Volksgemeinschaft, and … people who as the instruments of [our] ideological and political enemies are striving to demolish the unity of the German Volk and destroy its state power; against these enemies of Volk and state the Gestapo wages its unremitting battle’.17 Thanks to the deliberate vagueness of the term Volksfeind, the Gestapo was able to arbitrarily define all manner of organizations and groups as enemies of the state – even without them doing anything volksfeindlich – and thus as enemies to be fought and destroyed. In the paranoid world of National Socialism, the list of Volksfeinde was a very long one, ranging from Communists, monarchists, ‘politicizing churches’ and homosexuals through to Jewry as the ‘main enemy of the German Volk’. The organizational chart (‘Geschäftsverteilungsplan’, literally ‘business distribution plan’, GVP) of Department II (Gestapa) of the political police office of 1 January 1938 gives an impression of the breadth of anti-opposition activities, which even extended into the ranks of Nazi organizations (Unit II H 2); this GVP’s essential structure was to remain the definitive model for the Gestapo GVP as it changed in the course of the following years:\n\n14 | The Vienna Gestapo, 1938–1945\n\nSection II A:\n\nCommunism, Marxism, Soviet Russians, foreign subversion\n\nUnit II A 1: Unit II A 2: Unit II A 3: Unit II A 4: Unit II A 5:\n\nCommunism Marxism Soviet Russians Evaluation of all manifestations of Communism worldwide Passport forgery\n\nSection II B:\n\nConfessions, Jews, Freemasons, emigrants, pacifists\n\nUnit II B 1: Unit II B 2: Unit II B 3: Unit II B 4:\n\nPolitical Catholicism Protestant movement Emigrants Jews, Freemasons\n\nSection II C:\n\nReaction, opposition\n\nUnit II C 1: Former centre and right-wing parties, monarchism, nobility, societies and associations, paramilitary groupings (Freikorps) Unit II C 2: Black Front, Stennes movement, Sperr-Kreis (monarchist resistance movement in Bavaria), Jungdeutscher Orden (Young German order), Tannenberg-Bund Section II D: Protective custody Section II E:\n\nEconomy\n\nUnit II E 1: Unit II E 2: Unit II E 3: Unit II E 4:\n\nPolitico-economic affairs Politico-agricultural affairs Sociopolitical affairs Societies\n\nSection II F:\n\nCard index, staff files, evaluation of political reputation\n\nSection II G: Assassinations, surveillance, arms, troublemakers, identification service, 24-hour duty office, special tasks Section II H: Party members Unit II H 1: Other affairs not covered by II H 2 Unit II H 2: SA, SS, NSKK, Hitler Youth, BDM, DLV, Feldjägerkorps, Bündische Jugend Section II J:\n\nForeign police forces, dealings with foreign police\n\nSection II P:\n\nPress\n\nUnit II P 1:\n\nHome press\n\nThe Gestapo as the Central Terror Instrument of the Nazi Regime | 15\n\nUnit II P 2: Unit II P 3:\n\nForeign press Cultural politics, Catholic and Protestant press, sects, film, theatre\n\nSection II S:\n\nHomosexuality and abortion\n\nUnit II S 1: Unit II S 2:\n\nHomosexuality Abortion\n\nThe ministry of justice and certain parts of the corps of judges so inclined could do very little to resist Himmler’s successful drive for the Gestapo to be given ‘judiciary-like’ forms and means in their dealings with political opponents. Although in the Weimar Republic the judgments against the left-wing camp had in principle been more severe than against the right wing, the judiciary’s attempt to resist the growth in the Gestapo’s power potential through more rigorous judicial practice only put it even more firmly on the defensive. Hitler’s decision not to allow legal representation to defendants in Gestapo protective custody proceedings put a definitive end to resistance within the judiciary, which had in any case been modest: ‘The Führer has prohibited the calling in of lawyers,’ wrote Reichsführer-SS Himmler to the Reich minister of justice in 1935, ‘and has instructed me to inform you of his decisions’.18\n\nAmalgamation of Police and SS: Dismantling the State Monopoly on the Use of Force The ambitions of Himmler and Heydrich, in the pursuit of which they were very largely able to count on Hitler’s support, went much further than the intermediate goal of establishing a state secret police unimpeded by legal constraints. Their ultimate goal was a centralized structure unified throughout the Reich, and a police force with one homogeneous ideological orientation, entirely independent of all other authorities in the German Reich. The definitive decision for the centralization of the police had been made as early as 1936 with Himmler’s appointment as chief of the German police, which vastly increased his power and that of his SS. He was now in control of the entire German police including the criminal investigation police (Kriminalpolizei, Kripo), the ‘protection police’ (Schutzpolizei, Schupo) and the rural police (Gendarmerie). As a result, he was able to extend the competence of the political police, which until then had been restricted to the prosecution of political offences, to deviant social behaviour and to aligning the entire police machinery with the racial ideology of the SS, under oath. This created the conditions required for the police to focus entirely on the task of guaranteeing the ‘health of the German ethnic body [Volkskörper]’ – which was indeed the critical justification, supported by Hitler, for the amalgamation of the police and\n\n16 | The Vienna Gestapo, 1938–1945\n\nNSDAP machinery. Ulrich Herbert interprets this fusion of party and state tasks, which was intended by Werner Best to be a ‘general empowerment of the political police’, as a ‘constitutive component of the National Socialist Führer state’.19 Himmler’s vision of a state defence corps (Staatsschutzkorps) implied the operational and above all the ideological amalgamation of the security police (Sipo, i.e. Gestapo and Kripo) – that is to say, a state institution – with the SS, an NSDAP organization. This was a process unthinkable under any democratic constitution. It ‘was characterized by the combination of the “normative” and the “prerogative” state, the fusion of the adopted civil service apparatus with an ideologically elitist organization, and the ever-closer interlocking of the legal and the ideological legitimization of terror’.20 Most members of the Sipo bore civil service titles, were paid according to the law governing civil servants, and were subordinate to the Reich interior minister Wilhelm Frick, who naturally resisted the privatization of his police by Himmler’s SS. Himmler, however, with Hitler’s support, had no trouble in thwarting Frick’s ambition of incorporating the Sipo into the overall framework of a centralized police force. Writing in a Festschrift in honour of Frick’s 60th birthday, Himmler stated – with unmistakable irony – that ‘although considerable work’ admittedly still had to be done, ‘under Reichsminister Frick, a unified executive and security force for the German Reich has been created for the first time in a thousand years’.21 Finally, as a gesture of goodwill towards Frick, the matter was regulated through the meaningless compromise formulation contained in the full designation of Himmler’s office: ‘Reichsführer-SS and Chief of the German Police in the Reich Ministry of the Interior’. In practice, however, this in no way implied that Himmler or Heydrich’s Reich security main office (RSHA) were subordinate or answerable to Frick. In terms both of personnel and the institution itself, there was from the beginning a strict separation between the RSHA and the ministry, until finally, on 24 August 1943, Himmler himself became minister of the interior. The monopoly on the use of force held by the state and its police had now definitively passed to the SS, the ‘private army of a political party’.22 The idea of the state had been eroded to a historic low: from the Platonic-Aristotelian idea of a state that does not consist in power and domination but facilitates ‘the best, perfect life’, via the state as the holder of the ‘monopoly over the legitimate use of force’ (Max Weber), through to the privatization of this monopoly by the Nazis. That Gestapo and Kripo officials should become members of the SS was something that was expressly desired and indeed actively promoted, with the aim of furthering the amalgamation of the police and NSDAP machinery. Whoever fulfilled the ‘conditions for admittance to the SS – which were reduced for this case – could be given an SS rank corresponding to his current civil service rank. However, Himmler was emphatic that nobody was to be compelled to join\n\nThe Gestapo as the Central Terror Instrument of the Nazi Regime | 17\n\nthe SS: ‘I want an admission only if … the man applies freely and voluntarily [and] fits racially and ideologically into the SS’.23 After the war, nevertheless, many former Sipo officials sought to save their necks by claiming that admission to the SS had been compulsory, describing the ‘rank alignment’ through which they had received an SS rank as something that happened automatically. However, the historian Robert Gellately states that SS ranks could be awarded in alignment with police ranks ‘in a second, separate procedure’, as a kind of promotion. This was the actual ‘rank alignment’, which ‘involved much more than being merely co-opted into the SS’.24 On admission, Gestapo and Kripo officials were attached to the security service of the SS (Sicherheitsdienst, SD) and wore the diamond-shaped SD flash on their uniform sleeve. Heydrich justified this allocation in terms of the intended division of labour between Gestapo and SD: ‘The Gestapo [Staatspolizei] is to be assisted in its tasks by the party organization of the security service of the Reichsführer-SS, which does not possess executive powers. … While on the one hand the Gestapo’s tasks are tactical and executive in kind, the SD, on the other, has the task, which is to be carried out through intelligence and investigative activities, of providing the strategic foundations for leading the movement and thus the state’.25 Furthermore, the SD was to be developed into the ‘inner elite’ of an ideological ‘state defence corps’, as the scientific and theoretical ‘brain trust’26 of the Nazi leadership – and thus to stand in strong contrast to the political hooliganism of the initial years of the ‘movement’, and in particular the rabid and violent antisemitism of the SA. In any case, the SD was intended to play a special role in the Sipo and SS amalgamation process. In personnel terms, the very names of the newly created posts of ‘Inspector of the Sipo and SD’ (IdSuSD) and ‘Higher SS and Police Leader’ (HSSPF) were indicative of the close cooperation between Sipo and SD – as indeed was Himmler’s title ‘Reichsführer-SS und Chef der Deutschen Polizei’. The inspectors were, as Heydrich’s ‘personal authorized commissioners’, to represent ‘the Gestapo, Kripo and SD … vis-à-vis the central authorities and command posts of the Wehrmacht and offices of the NSDAP’.27 As such they were ‘one of the most important instruments in the Reich for securing the fusion of Sipo and SD’; Heydrich considered their creation to be an ‘indicator of the efforts … to develop and consolidate the position of Sipo and SD within the Nazi power structures’.28 The creation in 1937 of the post of HSSPF was of still greater significance for the amalgamation of police and party machinery. Like the inspectors, the HSSPFs were allocated to the military districts (Wehrkreise, finally twenty-one in number) corresponding to the regional divisions of the Wehrmacht. They were directly subordinate to Himmler, who could also issue them orders via a second command chain, which likewise bypassed any authorities at the RSHA, following which the HSSPFs then passed orders on to, for example, their respective inspectors.29\n\n18 | The Vienna Gestapo, 1938–1945\n\nPeter R. Black writes that one of the HSSPFs’ principal tasks – the monitoring of ideologically motivated measures ordered by Hitler such as ‘the deportation and elimination of Jews, Roma and other real or supposed enemies of Germany’30 – related above all to the conquered territories in the East – that is to say, areas where there were no established state or party structures, and where these measures were carried out on a large scale and with devastating consequences. In the ‘Altreich’ and ‘Ostmark’ (former Austria), where there were solidly established structures of state and party machinery, the tasks of the HSSPFs were more representative in character. This was particularly relevant in the case of the career of Ernst Kaltenbrunner, who as HSSPF of Military District XVII (Vienna, Lower Danube, Upper Danube) found himself in a state of ‘obscurity, political impotence and boredom’31 – until 1943, that is, when he became head of the RSHA.\n\nThe Reich Security Main Office: Terror Centre and ‘Institution of the War’ In September 1939, shortly after the beginning of the war, the efforts to advance the amalgamation of the police with the SD were given an institutional superstructure in the form of the successor organization to the Gestapa, the Reichssicherheitshauptamt (RSHA, Reich security main office). While the task of the Gestapa had above all been the suppression of internal political opponents such as Communists and Social Democrats, the RSHA can justifiably be described as an ‘institution of the war’.32 Its realization in actual practice was the result not so much of long-term conceptual thinking as of the urgent need to create an organizational framework for the wartime deployment of Gestapo and SD officials. As Wildt has put it, ‘Gestapo rule in the occupied territories radicalized [entgrenzte] the practices of the RSHA’, also with respect to the ‘number of people that the RSHA defined as “opponents” and “enemies”. When the Germans conquered Poland, more than three million Jews fell under their control’.33 No documentary evidence exists to show that before the war any thought had been given to the fate of these people at all. The RSHA was not simply a central authority that issued orders to the Gestapo regional headquarters (Leitstellen) and regular offices (Stellen), which were organized, to scale, in exactly the same way as the RSHA itself was. From the very beginning it was a central office of terror, and the offices under it were its branches. What Wildt calls the ‘dissolution of boundaries’ (Entgrenzung) with regard to the tasks of the RSHA not only related to the extent of the territory under Nazi rule but also to ‘the number of victims terrorized, driven out, deported and murdered’, and, not least, to ‘the practices used by the RSHA to implement its own policies, with the radicalization of measures all the way up to systematic genocide’.34 The prototype of Heydrich’s ‘fighting administration’\n\nThe Gestapo as the Central Terror Instrument of the Nazi Regime | 19\n\n(kämpfende Verwaltung) was ‘the ethnic cleansing in the annexed western Polish territories as well as the liquidation of the “Jewish-Bolshevik leading strata” in the Soviet Union’.35 A clear indicator of the extent of the ‘dissolution of boundaries’ with respect to the territory under the authority of the RSHA is given by the number of Gestapo regional headquarters and offices, with particular reference to the occupied territories. In 1939, out of a total of sixty-four Gestapo offices (including ‘Leitstellen’), eleven were located outside the ‘Altreich’ (six of these in annexed Austria); in 1941 the figure was twenty-six out of a total of sixty-seven. But by the end of 1944, as a result of the mass posting of Gestapo staff to the occupied territories, the number of offices in the ‘Altreich’ had sunk to twenty-five. At this point, of the 31,374 Gestapo staff members, around ‘75 per cent … were tied up in “security police operations” outside the Reich borders of 1937’.36 Michael Wildt describes the RSHA as a ‘mobile, flexible organization … of a new type: extremely capable of adapting to circumstances … and of creating new departments and dissolving old ones’.37 An example of this is provided by the GVPs, which were applied according to exactly the same scheme at all Gestapo offices, regulating the distribution of tasks and areas of competence down to the smallest detail. These GVPs were changed four times in a space of six years,38 on each occasion necessitating major interventions in the organizational structure of the individual Gestapo offices. Over and above the additional bureaucratic work, the redistribution and renaming of the sections and departments created competency-related problems and thus inter-staff conflicts at the Gestapo offices. However, far from being an expression of latent dissatisfaction, these measures were in fact typical of the strategy of ‘organized chaos’ with which Himmler, by changing the command hierarchies or creating short cuts within them, sought to increase the efficiency with which his orders were carried out: ‘The constant delimitations of competency kept the power structure of the Third Reich in a permanent state of movement. But this dynamic must not be taken to imply … that the matter of competencies tended to get increasingly chaotic. The chaos served exclusively to advance the swift and efficient realization of the goals of the Nazi leaders.39 Heydrich too was concerned that fusion with the Sipo should not result in his SD becoming what he called a ‘bürokratischer Beamtenladen’ (bureaucratic civil service shop), demanding with absolute clarity: ‘Despite amalgamation … maintain the fighting line’.40 Under the conditions of war, it finally proved impossible to achieve the ultimate goal of the RSHA, namely, to transfer the state’s sovereign rights into the hands of a party organization through the amalgamation of police and SS. Although Himmler wished this process of fusion to be crowned with the institution of a ‘state defence corps’, the law he envisaged in order to fulfil this wish was never passed. It was not even possible to achieve ‘the desired uniformity of\n\n20 | The Vienna Gestapo, 1938–1945\n\ncareer structure, training and remuneration’. Although the RSHA remained an incomplete torso, ‘the objectives of the new institution were unambiguous … maintaining the racial purity of the Volk’s body and repelling or exterminating an enemy defined in völkisch terms. Unfettered by any legal restrictions, it was the law enforcement authority of the racist Volksgemeinschaft’.41 The only instance of the concrete organizational amalgamation of Sipo and SD was the creation of the mobile task forces known as ‘Einsatzgruppen’ (literally, ‘deployment groups’, EGs) and their component parts, ‘Einsatzkommandos’ (EKs) and ‘Sonderkommandos’ (special commando units), each of which was composed of a Gestapo, a Kripo and an SD unit, complemented with squads of regular police and Waffen-SS. Units of this kind were deployed as early as the occupation of Austria (Einsatzkommando Österreich), of the Sudetenland (September 1938) and of the ‘Czech rump’ (March 1939); however, the EGs only became organizations of systematic mass murder in the course of the offensives against Poland, Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union.42\n\nOrganizational Structure of the RSHA From 1936, the security police main office (Hauptamt Sicherheitspolizei, headed by Reinhard Heydrich) and the order police main office (Hauptamt Ordnungspolizei, Kurt Daluege) were subordinate to Himmler as Reichsführer-SS and chief of the German police. While the Sipo was made up of the Gestapo and Kripo, the Orpo consisted of the ‘protection police’ (Schutzpolizei or Schupo), the rural police (Gendarmerie), the technical emergency services (Technische Nothilfe), and the fire protection and local police. This structure changed in 1939 with the establishment of the RSHA, which was divided up by Amt (office or department); these were seven in number, representing functional groups of the Sipo and SD. While the seats of office of the RSHA were on Wilhelmstrasse and Prinz-Albrechtstrasse, the Orpo main office was at the Reich ministry of the interior. The GVP valid on 1 March 1941, which in the opinion of Vienna Gestapo deputy head Karl Ebner ‘proved its worth in the working context’, offers a clear picture of the organization and divisions of the RSHA:43 In Amt I/Personnel, Gestapo and Kripo officials and SS officers in the SD were trained for their functions before being appointed to their posts; this office was also responsible for the SS officers’ schools (SS-Führerschulen). Amt II/Organization, Administration, Law was concerned with, among other things: assessing whether individuals were ‘hostile to Volk and state’; confiscation of assets and ‘expatriation’ (deprivation of citizenship); and matters related to arms, aircraft and motor vehicles, including the construction of gas vans.\n\nThe Gestapo as the Central Terror Instrument of the Nazi Regime | 21\n\nAmt III/Areas of German Life [Deutsche Lebensgebiete] (SD Domestic) was strongly ideological in orientation. Department III B, ‘Volkstum’ (‘Volk-dom’), containing Section III B 3, ‘Rasse und Volksgesundheit’ (race and the health of the Volk), was described by Heydrich as ‘the most important group’ of all. Amongst further important areas covered were ‘Reichsaufbau’ (development of the Reich), with tasks related to educational and settlement policy and appointments in the economy and in science and scholarship, and, furthermore, the intelligence-related reports ‘Meldungen aus dem Reich’. Amt IV/Investigating and Combating Opponents evolved from the security police main office of the Gestapa, and was the central office of the Gestapo within the RSHA. It was divided into five groups: Group IV A Group IV B Group IV C Group IV D Group IV E\n\nOpposition Ideological opponents Card indexes, protective custody Occupied territories Counter-intelligence\n\nEach group was divided into sections: in Group IV A, for example, there was Section IV A 1 (Communism, Marxism, etc.), and in Group IV B there was Section IV B 4 (Jewish affairs), with Adolf Eichmann as section head. The distribution of groups and sections in the GVP was changed and extended in the two GVPs that followed (1942 and 1944). In 1942 a sixth group was added, Group IV F (passports and foreign police forces); in 1944 there was an extensive restructuring, because as the war proceeded the sections concerned with Gestapo operations in the occupied territories became increasingly important. However, this last GVP was never fully implemented at the Vienna Gestapo. Amt V/Crime-Fighting, as the office of the Reich criminal investigation police, was concerned with ‘preventive crime-fighting’ and was the central office for investigation and tracking; it pursued and deported Roma and Sinti and committed homosexuals to concentration camps. In Section V D 2 (Forensic institute of the security police), procedures were developed for Nazi ‘euthanasia’ (murder), gas vans, and poison munitions. Amt VI/SD Foreign had the task of processing and evaluating political information from abroad, with the various sections being devoted to various geographical areas. ‘The SD’s most intensive foreign intelligence work occurred in Vienna, where Wilhelm Höttl and Wilhelm Wanek (Group VI E South) had a diverse network of informants reporting on political and economic relations in south-eastern Europe.’44 Amt VII/Ideological Investigation and Evaluation had a range of tasks that went beyond those of traditional police work: it was concerned with the ideological investigation of opponents on a scientific basis – with a strongly antisemitic\n\n22 | The Vienna Gestapo, 1938–1945\n\norientation. It was the central institution for the confiscation (or robbery) of – principally Jewish – collections, and of archives and libraries in the occupied territories.\n\nNotes 1.

How concrete the preparations for the building up of the Gestapo in Austria had been is indicated by a 133-page SD exposé that foresaw a personnel requirement of 2,059, which turned out to accord fairly exactly with the actual numbers of staff in the subsequent years. These plans were clearly drawn up by experienced police jurists with the help of Austrian police officials who had fled to Germany, and with a wealth of intelligence information supplied by Austrian ‘illegals’ (i.e. Austrian Nazis during the NSDAP’s prohibition in Austria, 1933–38). As well as being extremely precise, the plans varied in their details from region to region – and were systematically implemented following the annexation.1 Franz Josef Huber, later head of the Vienna Gestapo, had worked in the Bavarian political police as head of Section II 1 C ö – ‘ö’ being the abbreviation for Austria – from as early as 1933, following which he continued in the same field in the ‘newly founded Department II 1 H’2 of the Gestapa from 1934. The Gestapa GVP of 1 January 1938 cites Huber as head of Section II C (Reaction, opposition, Austrian affairs). Huber later confirmed that this was why he was\n\nEstablishment of the Gestapo in Austria | 25\n\ntransferred to Vienna and that he ‘had already been concerned with Austrian affairs in Munich and Berlin’.3 From 1935 to 1936 there were several former Austrian police officials working in Section II C who had fled to Germany to escape imprisonment for involvement in Nazi activities, amongst them Hubert Kern, Karl Hemetsberger,4 and Humbert Achamer-Pifrader. The exceptionally ambitious Achamer-Pifrader was extremely well connected, not only with his mentor Otto Steinhäusl but also with Heinrich Himmler and Reinhard Heydrich. In combination with his good contacts with (covert) Nazi-minded circles within the Austrian state and police machinery, these connections soon enabled Achamer-Pifrader to make his mark in Section II C as an expert on Austrian affairs (as head of Unit II C 3, Austrian refugees). Immediately after the annexation he was appointed deputy head of the Vienna Gestapo under Huber. Achamer-Pifrader’s good friend Rudolf Mildner, likewise an ‘Austrian refugee’, continued to work with the Bavarian political police until he became deputy head of the Linz Gestapo following the annexation.5 Hubert Kern, a jurist, had been a member of the Hitler Youth since 1924 and of the NSDAP since 1932; he was an official at the Vienna police headquarters (Polizeidirektion Wien) until 1934, when he was dismissed from police service for his activities as a Nazi. During his period at the Gestapa, where he principally collected material about members of the Austrian government,6 those with whom he was in constant contact for intelligence purposes included his elder brother Anton Kern, who likewise was a jurist, an NSDAP member from 1931, and until March 1936 an official at various Vienna police stations. In 1936, Anton Kern was dismissed from state service for his activities as a Nazi, and sentenced by a court of law, but he was granted an amnesty at Christmas of that year. Until the annexation, he played a leading role at the top level of the illegal Austrian NSDAP; thereafter he worked for a short time on building up the Vienna Gestapo before finally taking over as head of Department III (Staff) of the Ordnungspolizei in April 1938.7 On 14 March 1938, Hubert Kern was transferred from his Berlin post to the Vienna Gestapo, where he played a leading role in the initial build-up phase as head of Department I (Personnel); moreover, he was promoted to the secondhighest rank in the Gestapo regional headquarters hierarchy, Regierungsrat.8 Similarly, Adolf Eichmann, who had grown up in Linz, had left Austria when the NSDAP was made illegal, and offered his services with the SD in Berlin. By his own account, shortly before the annexation of March 1938 he was involved in preparing Hollerith punched cards with thousands of names of ‘persons, organizations, newspapers and periodicals, authorities, schools, etc.’ in Austria – though he himself, of course, just ‘cut cards and punched holes’.9 Based on lists drawn up at the Gestapa, this ‘Austria card index’ was a comprehensive ‘wanted’ list of all individuals and institutions suspected of being opponents of National\n\n26 | The Vienna Gestapo, 1938–1945\n\nSocialism; later, similar lists and indexes were prepared for other countries that had been or were due to be occupied.10 As day broke on 12 March 1938, one day before the ‘reunification of Austria with the German Reich’, Himmler landed at the Vienna-Aspern airfield, accompanied by Sipo and Orpo heads Heydrich and Daluege, as well as further high-ranking SS officers and police and Gestapo officials. On the same day, Huber and Achamer-Pifrader were flown to Munich, as they had originally been intended to arrive in Vienna ‘with the marching troops’,11 and thence to Vienna. The takeover of the Austrian police was initiated without delay, with two special staffs being created: one entrusted with the task of building up the security police (Sipo – i.e. the Gestapo and Kripo), and one with responsibility for regular, uniformed police (Ordnungspolizei, Orpo for short, consisting essentially of Schupo and Gendarmerie). On 14 March, the NSDAP newspaper Völkischer Beobachter was able to report that ‘under the command of Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler … all measures [are being taken to] make the police in Austria what it has long been in the Reich, namely, a reliable National Socialist instrument of power, closely bound to the Volk and firmly in the Führer’s hand’.12 On 15 March, the territorial organization of the Gestapo in Austria was mapped out by the ‘special staff of the chief of the security police [Heydrich]’ at its first, provisional seat of office in the Hotel Regina, not far from the Ring in Vienna’s 9th district:13 the Gestapo regional headquarters (Staatspolizeileitstelle) was to be in Vienna, with regular Gestapo offices (Staatspolizeistellen) in Linz, Salzburg, Eisenstadt, Innsbruck, Klagenfurt and Graz. On the same day, Huber was appointed head of the Vienna Gestapo, with Achamer-Pifrader as his deputy. On the very next day, the entire Austrian police was sworn in under allegiance to Hitler. With the enactment, published on 18 March 1938, of the Law on the Reunification of Austria with the German Reich (Gesetz über die Wiedervereinigung Österreichs mit dem Deutschen Reich), Himmler as Reichsführer SS and chief of the German police was authorized by Reich interior minister Frick ‘to undertake such measures as are necessary for the maintenance of security and order, [even if ] beyond the legal limitations otherwise laid down for this purpose’.14 Heydrich’s decree of 18 March 1938 on the ‘Organisation der Geheimen Staatspolizei in Österreich’15 contained more specific provisions about the tasks and regional responsibilities of the Gestapo on Austrian soil: The Vienna Gestapo regional headquarters is to be established with its seat in Vienna. It takes over the entire political police tasks of the hitherto existing General Directorate for Public Security and the police headquarters and its security directorate in Vienna … The hitherto existing security directorates or commissariats of Linz, Graz, Salzburg, Klagenfurt, Innsbruck, Eisenstadt are to become Gestapo offices, at the\n\nEstablishment of the Gestapo in Austria | 27\n\nsame time taking over the political departments of the respective police directorates. The tasks of the hitherto existing security directorate of Bregens [sic] are to be taken over by Innsbruck Gestapo office.16\n\nThe typing errors, which are uncharacteristic of Heydrich’s decrees, are a telling indication of the urgency with which the measures were to be carried out. Just as the Gestapo offices in the federal provinces were given the same regional competences as their predecessor bodies, the Vienna regional headquarters was given responsibility for Vienna and Lower Austria. Furthermore, it was authorized to ‘issue instructions to and demand reports from the Gestapo offices’. With regard to their relation to the Gestapa – that is to say, to Heydrich himself – the Vienna Gestapo and the provincial Gestapo offices were obliged to submit reports directly to Heydrich, who could also give them orders directly. This was by no means, as has sometimes been suggested, a conscious restriction of the powers of the regional headquarters. It was simply an example of Himmler and Heydrich’s practice of creating short cuts in chains of command, which they considered would result in a more efficient implementation of the measures they ordered.17 The same decree also regulated the Gestapo’s relations to other authorities. As head of the Vienna regional headquarters, Huber was given an additional function as ‘political security adviser to the state secretary for security’, namely, Ernst Kaltenbrunner, who had been appointed to the post shortly after the annexation.18 However, Heydrich imposed a massive limitation on the post’s functions, which for the following four years was to significantly weaken the position of Kaltenbrunner – from September 1938 also HSSPF ‘Danube’ – and force him into a predominantly representative role: although Kaltenbrunner was ‘authorized to issue instructions to the Gestapo in the country [former Austria]’, he could do so only ‘insofar as they do not conflict with orders of [Himmler] or his authorized representatives. In cases of doubt, a decision shall be obtained from the central Reich authority’.19 A comment made by Huber during his denazification proceedings in 1949 reveals how little authority Kaltenbrunner had over the Vienna Gestapo in practice, and over Huber as his ‘political security adviser’: ‘I was the designated head of the future Staatspolizei-Leitstelle … My superior was Kaltenbrunner as Staatssekretär für das Sicherheitswesen in Österreich. Later, the Reichsstatthalter, Josef Bürckel, was officially also head of the Austrian police. In reality, however, I received my orders directly from what was to become the Reichssicherheitshauptamt’.20 With the decree issued on 22 March by Heinrich Müller,21 acting inspector of the Sipo and SD (IdSuSD) for SD-Oberabschnitt ‘Austria’ (later ‘Danube’), the organizational building up of the Gestapo in Austria began at the second, provisional seat of office at Herrengasse 7 (1st district of Vienna, inner city), under SS-Sturmbannführer Heinrich Seetzen.22 The tasks related to coordinating the\n\n28 | The Vienna Gestapo, 1938–1945\n\nSipo and Orpo were undertaken by Gustav Adolf Nosske, head of the Gestapo office in Frankfurt an der Oder.23 In the same decree of 22 March 1938, Müller transferred ‘his Gestapo-related tasks to the Vienna Gestapo regional headquarters’,24 at which point Huber took over the IdSuSD’s supervisory function over the Gestapo, thus launching the period of almost seven years during which he was his own official supervisor as head of the Vienna Gestapo.25 A further decree issued by Heydrich on 23 March 193826 announced the names of those appointed to be heads (and deputy heads) of the Gestapo regional headquarters and offices in Austria. The appointees were almost without exception Nazis from the ‘Altreich’, especially if one includes the Austrians Achamer-Pifrader and Mildner, who – as already mentioned – had been in Germany since 1936 and 1935 respectively. They were as follows: Staatspolizeileitstelle Wien Head: SS-Obersturmbannführer Huber Deputy head: SS-Obersturmbannführer Dr Pifrader Address: Hotel Metropol [sic], Morzinplatz, Vienna I Staatspolizeistelle Linz Head: SS-Sturmbannführer Dr Rasch27 Deputy head: SS-Sturmbannführer Dr Mildner28 Address: Landhaus, Promenade, Linz … Staatspolizeistelle Graz Head: SS-Sturmbannführer Schulz Deputy head: Dr Delphin Address: Paulustorgasse 8, Graz … Staatspolizeistelle Salzburg Head: SS-Untersturmführer Müller Deputy head: Revierinspektor Dr Trenka Address: Kurfürstenstrasse 1, Salzburg … Staatspolizeistelle Klagenfurt Head: SS-Obersturmführer Dr Isselhorst Deputy head: tba Address: Landesregierung, Arnulfplatz 1, Klagenfurt … Staatspolizeistelle Innsbruck Head: SS-Untersturmführer Dr Harster\n\nEstablishment of the Gestapo in Austria | 29\n\nDeputy head: Dr Spann Address: Herrenstrasse 1, Innsbruck … Staatspolizeistelle Eisenstadt Head: SS-Untersturmführer Bovensiepen Deputy head: tba Address: Landhaus, Eisenstadt\n\nIn October 1938 the Eisenstadt Gestapo office was dissolved, Burgenland being divided up between the Reichsgaus of Lower Danube and Styria, and for secret police purposes between the Gestapo regional headquarters in Vienna and the Gestapo office in Graz. The Eisenstadt Gestapo office was converted into a border police station (‘Greko’, short for Grenzpolizei-Kommissariat) of the Vienna regional headquarters. On 1 April 1938 the staff of the ‘Hauptamt der Sicherheitspolizei und des Gestapa’ were informed in a circular from Heydrich29 that the ‘inspector of the Sipo and the Gestapo regional headquarters in Vienna … [had] moved into their new official premises, Hotel Metropol [sic], Morzinplatz, Vienna I’. This top-class luxury hotel, which the Nazis had wasted no time in seizing for their own use, was to become the permanent headquarters of the Vienna Gestapo, and for the following seven years was an address synonymous with the full force of Nazi terror on Austrian soil. In an article in the SS paper Das Schwarze Korps, Heydrich made it unmistakably clear what opponents of the National Socialist regime in Austria would have to expect: ‘The supreme law, the supreme judge over all interventions into personal freedom and property, and, when necessary, over life and death, is the Führer – in Austria as elsewhere’.30 Even as early as 18 March 1938, Werner Best31 had instructed the relevant sections of Gestapa ‘without delay … to make a compilation of all the cases of penal offences (especially high treason and state treason) and subversive activity … stemming from Austria, or with traces leading to Austria or proceeding from Austria into the Reich’.32 On the basis of these ‘blacklists’ and the Gestapa ‘Austria card index’ mentioned above, between fifty and seventy thousand Austrians were arrested in the first six weeks after the annexation, some of whom were released after only a few days but others were kept in detention for years. ‘In this course of events, it was particularly disastrous for opponents of the Nazis that on 12 February 1938, Hitler and Schuschnigg had agreed in Berchtesgaden on responsibility for security being transferred to the (still clandestine) National Socialist Arthur Seyß-Inquart, as it led to all the police records of the Schuschnigg regime, in particular those regarding the illegal left, falling into the hands of the new authorities.’33\n\n30 | The Vienna Gestapo, 1938–1945\n\nRole of the Illegal Austrian National Socialists in Setting Up the Vienna Gestapo in 1938 The Nazi Putsch in the Vienna Police The annexation of Austria in March 1938 and concomitant establishment of the Vienna Gestapo as the most important instrument of Nazi terror in Austria by no means came about solely as an external act of force on the part of German armed forces and powerful police formations. Important roles were also played by Austrian members of the NSDAP – not only ‘illegal’ activists and sympathizers in the Austrian police but also Nazi-oriented Austri"
