        "text": "On April 7th, 1951, Holocaust perpetrator Otto Ohlendorf’s death sentence was carried out according to the ruling of the United States Military Courts in Nuremberg. In The United States vs. Otto Ohlendorf, et. al., leaders of the Einsatzgruppen, mobile killing units, were tried for war crimes which led to the deaths of millions of Jews and partisans. Under Ohlendorf’s leadership of Einsatzgruppen D, more than 90,000 people were liquidated in the Ukraine. After this assignment, Ohlendorf resumed his positions head of Domestic Security in the Reich Security Main Office. As the war ended, he surrendered, and revealed the full scope of Einsatzgruppen activity, which eventually led to the second set of Nuremberg Trials. Outside of the Holocaust and the trial, little has been written on Ohlendorf. His academic career and ideology are insufficiently analyzed. This dissertation analyzes Ohlendorf’s life, career, and National Socialist ideology. The key factor in exploring his motivations is to fuse together careerism and ideology through his elite status as an Alter Kämpfer, “old fighter” and Nazi party member before 1933. From this designation, Ohlendorf enjoyed privileged employment, promotions, and a high level of trust within the party. Further explored is the placement of Ohlendorf into the historiographical debate, and how his ideology, career, trial, and death connected to his position as an Alter Kämpfer. Ultimately, analyzing the historiography reveals how memory has been fashioned in such ubiquitous topics as World War II, Nazi Germany, and the Holocaust.\n\nWE ATTACH -FOR THE SCHOLARS AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC- THIS FULL EDITION (85,000 WORDS, 212 PAGES), WITH THE SCOPE AND PURPOSE THAT THE PUBLIC CAN HAVE A VIEW TO THE COLOSAL CONTINETAL REACH, SIZE & LOGISTICS OF THE JEWISH HOLOCAUST [1933-1945], PERPETRATED BY THE NAZI GERMANY AND SO MANY EUROPEAN COLLABORATORS: INDIVIDUALS, COMPANIES, INSTITUTIONS AND GOVERMENTS ALIKE.

THE TRAINS OF THE HOLOCAUST: An In-Depth Look at How Railway Transports Companies in Europe cooperated and assisted in the Second and Final Phase of the Holocaust, the \"Final Solution\". THIS GENERAL STUDY, deal with the concrete fact about how a modern railway system -the largest capitalist enterprise at the time, the Deutsche Reichsbahn [DRB]- with its associated railways companies (in collusion) in each European country, contributed to the colossal scale of evacuation and displacement, for the purpose of interment and slavery, especially after the Wannsee Conference in January 1942. The Nazi criminal regime (1933-1945), it’s military, civilian organizations, middle-level bureaucracy and associated dictatorial regimes all over Europe, succeeded in murdering millions of people and destroying a flourishing 900-years-old Jewish Culture in Europe. In the process, they murdered of millions of humans across the continent: 6 millions Jews and 20 million other innocent civilians. An efficient railways system across the continent with more than 100,000 km of rail, (only 42,000 km of which were in Germany proper) operated by the largest private railroad at the time, the Deutsche Reichsbahn, with more than 250,000 workers and a formidable 12,500 operational locomotives (kriegslokomotiven), totally sustained and assisted Germany’s formidable war machine and as aided the Nazi organizations in charge of the “Final Solution”. The European railway companies totally and willingly assisted the Nazis in the transportation segment by carrying out this infamous crime: The Holocaust. Without the collaboration of European railways, the Holocaust could not have happened on the scale on which it did. \"\"\"\n\nThis BA-thesis presents an analysis of the political and social structures of the Third Reich and how, informed by the ideology of Nazism, they enabled the Holocaust, from the two different political-scientific approaches of interpretivism and structuralism. The argument is that Nazi ideology informed the structures of the Third Reich in such a way, primarily through the concepts of ‘cumulative radicalization’ and ‘working towards the Führer,’ that the Holocaust unfolded in a haphazard ‘functionalist’ process, through ever fluctuating Nazi anti-Jewish policy, as to emerge in three primary stages and a further two phases. The final stage was the so-called ‘Final Solution’ as we know it – which unfolded in two phases, firstly the Shoah by bullets and secondly the Shoah by gas. This process is referred to by scholars as the ‘twisted road to Auschwitz.’ In this essay, the two primary historiographical approaches to the Holocaust, intentionalism and functionalism, will be synthesized and reconciled with the political-scientific approaches of interpretivism and structuralism. I argue that intentionalism is essentially synonymous with interpretivism, as an approach that looks at ideas as a primary motivating factor; and the same applies to functionalism and structuralism, as an approach that looks at the dynamic of the political/social structures of society, how they function and compete among each other to produce outcomes. I argue that adopting only one of these approaches is insufficient. They have to be applied in unison to sufficiently explain the functioning of the Nazi Regime, and how the greatest genocide in all of human history unfolded.\n\nHorrified by the Holocaust, social psychologist Stanley Milgram wondered if he could recreate the Holocaust in the laboratory setting. Unabated for more than half a century, his (in)famous results have continued to intrigue scholars. Based on unpublished archival data from Milgram’s personal collection, volume one of this two-volume set introduces readers to a behind the scenes account showing how during Milgram’s unpublished pilot studies he step-by-step invented his official experimental procedure—how he gradually learnt to transform most ordinary people into willing inflictors of harm. Volume two then illustrates how certain innovators within the Nazi regime used the very same Milgram-like learning techniques that with increasing effectiveness gradually enabled them to also transform most ordinary people into increasingly capable executioners of other men, women, and children. Volume two effectively attempts to capture how step-by-step these Nazi innovators attempted to transform the Führer’s wish of a Jewish-free Europe into a frightening reality. By the books’ end the reader will gain an insight into how the seemingly undoable can become increasingly doable. It is not necessary to read Vol. 1 before reading Vol. 2 (Vol. 2 has a good summary of Vol. 1's key arguments)."
