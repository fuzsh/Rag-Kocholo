In an attempt to make some sense of the crucial yet diverse support, I would like to thank the following individuals. I am very grateful to my colleagues at Loyola College, who have offered not just intellectual stimulation, but friendship and camaraderie. I will miss them very much as I move on to a new position at Claremont McKenna College. Joanne Dabney, the administrator of the History Department deserves special recognition for her tireless efforts. I would also thank Deans David Roswell and John Hollwitz, who have provided me with the resources needed to conduct research in Europe. I owe a debt of gratitude to the Loyola Center for the Humanities for several summer grants and a junior faculty sabbatical. The German Academic Exchange Service awarded me two fellowships, which permitted valuable research trips to Germany. The Holocaust Educational Foundation and its president, Theodore Zev Weiss, also provided much needed financial assistance. I would convey special thanks to friends who took the time to read the manuscript. James Van Dyke, Paul Jaskot, Scott Denham, Günter Bischof, Chris Jackson, Rebecca Boehling, Ines Schlenker, Stephan Lindner, Marion Deshmukh, and Geoffrey Giles read all or part of the book. I take responsibility for all of its shortcomings, but there would have been many more without their assistance. Similarly, the opportunity to present my findings at lectures and symposia elicited very useful feedback. In this respect, I would thank the following for their suggestions: O. K. Werckmeister, Peter Hayes, Eugen Blume, Dieter Schmidt, Wolfgang Wittrock, Keith Holz, Sabine Eckmann, Christoph Zuschlag, John Czaplicka, Jan Tabor, and Rosl Merdinger. I would also thank\n\nxi\n\nxii\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nseveral senior scholars for continuing to offer wise counsel. I truly appreciate the assistance of Charles Maier, Richard Hunt, Peter Paret, Vernon Lidtke, and Philip Eliasoph. A number of individuals are also studying the looting of art prior to and during World War II, and they have offered me invaluable advice and encouragement over the years. I would recognize Elizabeth Simpson and Konstantin Akinsha, my partners in The Documentation Project, as well as Lynn Nicholas, Willi Korte, Marc Masurovsky, Hector Feliciano, Gerald Aalders, Oliver Rathkolb, Sarah Jackson, Constance Lowenthal, Thomas Buomberger, Cynthia Salzman, Patricia Kennedy Grimsted, Anja Heuss, Wolfgang Eichwede, Ulrike Hartung, Walter Robinson, William Honan, Ulrich Bischoff, Gert Kerschbaumer, and Anne Webber. Certain individuals were invaluable because of their help with the research. At times, they shared valuable documents that they possessed. This was the case with Oliver Rathkolb mentioned above, who copied an important file on Kajetan Mühlmann; Bernard Taper also sent me copies of his interrogations of Mühlmann; Jody Bresnahan, who let me use papers belonging to her father who had served in the Office of Strategic Services; Josephine Gabler, who sent me material pertaining to Arno Breker and Georg Kolbe; and Andrea Schmidt, who shared with me her research on Klaus Graf von Baudissin. Sylvia Hochfield and Milton Esterow also put files in the ARTnews office at my disposal. Michael Dobbs at the Washington Post and Walter Robinson at the Boston Globe also shared useful information with me. Steve Rogers at the Department of Justice’s Office of Special Investigation sent me materials concerning war crimes inquiries. I would also thank my dear friends Timothy and Mary Louise Ryback, who escorted me on trips in and around Salzburg as we searched for houses and graves of figures in the book. There were also a number of professionals who made my work in their institutions very productive. I would thank Timothy Benson and colleagues at Rifkind Center in Los Angeles; Valérie Dahan and Sarah Halperyn of the Centre Documentation Juive Contemporaine; A. J. van der Leeuw, formerly of the State Institute for War Documentation in Amsterdam; Anette Meiburg and Dr. Blumberg at the Bundesarchiv in Berlin-Lichterfelde; Dr. Michael Kurtz, Greg Bradsher, and David Van Tassel at the National Archives in Washington/College Park; Stephen Mize of the National Gallery in Washington, DC; Dr. Cornelia Syre, Dr. Carla Schulz-Hoffmann and their colleagues at the Bavarian State\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nxiii\n\nPainting Collections in Munich; Gode Krämer at the Art Collection of Augsburg; Roswitha Juffinger at the Residenzgalerie Salzburg; Professor Norbert Frei and his coworkers at the Institute for Contemporary History in Munich; F.

Painting is still missing today (NA).\n\nLeonardo da Vinci, Lady with an Ermine (also known as Portrait of Cecilia Gallerani), from the Czartoriski family collection (NA).\n\nIntroduction\n\nImagine the thoughts that passed through the mind of Kajetan Mühlmann in June 1941 as he sat in the first-class compartment of the Reichsbahn train carrying him from Cracow to Berlin. Next to him, wrapped tightly in protective packaging, were three paintings: Raphael’s Portrait of a Gentleman, Leonardo da Vinci’s Lady with an Ermine, and Rembrandt’s Landscape with the Good Samaritan. They were three of the most prized artworks in Poland—taken from the Czartoryski family’s collection—and they were in his personal care. Mühlmann, it would seem, had very mixed emotions as he watched the Polish countryside pass outside the window. On the one hand, he was a Nazi, a German nationalist, and took great satisfaction in the notion that these masterpieces, these examples of “Aryan” superiority, were returning heim ins Reich (“home to the Reich”). Mühlmann later testified about the excitement he felt merely transporting these masterpieces and the prospect of reporting their arrival in Berlin to Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring, his patron and protector, undoubtedly\n\n1\n\n2\n\nThe Faustian Bargain\n\nenhanced this sentiment. Göring was then at the height of his power and had undeniable presence. To be summoned by the Reichsmarschall to his grandiose Carinhall estate was a heady experience that helped bolster Mühlmann’s ego and made him feel a part of the Nazi elite. Yet this excitement and self-satisfaction was tempered by a certain frustration and dread. This was now the second trip to hand over these paintings: after the first delivery to Berlin, when Göring had stored the works in the Kaiser Friedrich Museum, General Governor Hans Frank, another of his superiors, had responded by ordering them returned to Cracow, and Mühlmann had complied.1 He recounted later that he hated being caught in a struggle between rapacious Nazi leaders and feared that it might not only undermine his career, but jeopardize his life. This scholar, who had earned his doctorate by writing a dissertation on baroque fountains in his native Salzburg, also knew at some level that he was violating fundamental ethical precepts, although he remonstrated after the war, “we were art historians; what did we know about international law, the Geneva Convention and such.” He added defensively, “we carried out our project in Poland with absolute humanity.”2 Mühlmann was close friends with several high-ranking SS leaders who played prominent roles in the persecution of Jews and other subject peoples and was actually well aware of the Germans’ policies. Feeling powerful and a part of a historical process, yet at that same time complicit in grave deeds beyond his control, Kajetan Mühlmann expressed his ambivalence about his undertaking in Poland by jumping at the opportunity to transfer his operations to the less brutal occupation administration in the Netherlands. These conflicting thoughts and emotions were common to nearly all of the experts who implemented the Nazi leaders’ art policies. The scene above was not unique. When museum director Ernst Buchner entered a chateau in the south of France and encountered the multipaneled Ghent altarpiece by the Van Eyck brothers, he, too, later testified in 1945 to a flood of mixed emotions.3 An expert in early modern northern European painting, he had a profound appreciation of this altar, one of the greatest artworks of its kind. Yet despite his belief that the altar belonged to Germany and should be repatriated, there was the stark reality that he was escorted by an armed detachment and that the work was being taken by force. Both Mühlmann and Buchner found ways to assuage these pangs of guilt. They rationalized their behavior on the grounds that they were safeguarding cultural property, following orders, and taking what was rightfully Germany’s. It is these varying\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nemotions, this psychic drama, that makes the history of the Nazi art experts so compelling. The “art world” is a somewhat vague term that encompasses a host of professions, ranging from dealers to museum officials and from academics to practicing artists. Additionally, this term conjures up varied and at times conflicting associations. On the one hand, it is characterized by a certain mystery—a place where personal connections are paramount and clandestine transactions not infrequent. Conversely, it is populated by erudite and polished professionals, members of a glamorous international elite who have mastered vast stores of arcane knowledge.4 It is important to emphasize at the outset that the subjects of this book qualify as intellectuals. Most had the benefit of formal education, were cognizant of contemporary political and cultural trends, and possessed a veneer of sophistication. This is the history of skilled and successful individuals who collaborated with the Nazi leaders and helped implement a nefarious cultural program. While it is naïve and without historic foundation to expect members of the intelligentsia to behave in a more scrupulous and humane fashion than those who do not lead the life of the mind, there has nonetheless been a persistent expectation that they will do so. This was especially the case in the nineteenth century, when those who were educated were imagined to have greater insight and a more highly developed social conscience.5 This expectation was also shared by the U.S. intelligence agents in the Office of Strategic Services (OSS)— many of them academics—who hatched a plan during the war to contact intellectuals as part of the invasion of Germany. The OSS agents believed that German intellectuals, along with labor and church leaders, would be most inclined to join the anti-Nazi resistance as soon as it became feasible.6 The OSS agents were sorely mistaken, and as we have subsequently discovered, those in the learned professions were often among the first to be co-opted, not to mention frequently supportive of the Nazi regime right until the end.7 Even later, in the German Democratic Republic, with the lessons of National Socialism all too clear, the professoriate was overrepresented among Stasi (the East German secret police) informers: Timothy Garton Ash cites the statistic that “one in every six professors and one in ten university employees had worked for or in some way cooperated with the secret police under the old regime.”8 In both dictatorships, the Third Reich and the former East Germany, one cannot help but ask, why was this the case and what were they thinking?\n\n4\n\nThe Faustian Bargain\n\nPart of the project of this book is to understand the various motivations that induced talented and respected professionals in the art world to become accomplices of the Nazi leaders—in most cases, to become art plunderers. This is admittedly a daunting project. Because it deals with the complexities of human nature, motivation is at some fundamental level inexplicable. Scholars will never get it entirely right. But this limitation does not mean that one should give up trying. Motivation lies at the core of most history and is central to the drama; as with others who have tackled the subject (such as Michael Kater and his study of musicians in the Third Reich), I proceed knowing that certain critics will be dissatisfied with the conclusions.9 I have not attempted to construct a system to categorize the subjects. While this has been tried in a cursory way at least once before, it seems best to appreciate the uniqueness of the subjects depicted here and leave this project to sociologists or those in other disciplines.10 Some common traits—patterns in gender and class, perhaps even a “syndrome”—emerge in the course of this study. But it is essential to appreciate that the subjects treated here were individuals who acted for their own reasons. It is also not my intention to demonize either these figures or the Nazi leaders. Timothy Garton Ash made a relevant observation about Stasi informers: “If only I had met, on this search, a single clearly evil person. But they were all just weak, shaped by circumstance, selfdeceiving; human, all too human. Yet the sum of all their actions was a great evil.”11 This formulation offers a satisfying balance. On the one hand, the subjects, like most people, fell somewhere in the gray area of behavior. On the other, their story has an important ethical component inextricably linked with the more systematic persecution of the period. The phrase “Faustian bargain” is often used in an imprecise manner to describe any immoral or amoral act that leads to self-advancement. One sees this, for example, in a Newsweek article about Swiss bankers serving the Nazis in return for greater profits.12 In fact, since its inception in the sixteenth century, the story of Faust and his pact with Mephistopheles entailed more than self-interest. He made his deal with the devil in return for greatness and in pursuit of a lofty ideal (in many versions, for knowledge).13 The figures in this study were not simply corrupt or self-promoting. They were at or near the top of their respective fields and held ambitions for even loftier accomplishment. They collaborated with the Nazi leaders, whom they often recognized as brutal and vainglorious, because they perceived opportunities in terms of their own work. They were not concerned with mere survival, but pur-\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nsued a vision of greatness that would ultimately yield fame and a kind of immortality. Additionally, they themselves would have been familiar with the Faustian myth. It was a well-known trope at this time for those who were culturally literate (Oswald Spengler, in Decline of the West, even talked about the twentieth century as the “Faustian era”).14 One finds cases like Albert Speer, who remarked in his memoirs, “For the commission to do a great building, I would have sold my soul like Faust. Now I had found my Mephistopheles. He seemed no less engaging than Goethe’s.”15 The Faustian metaphor, then, is useful not only because of its expressiveness, but also because it was central to the culture discussed in this book. Nonetheless, the metaphor should not be viewed as a procrustean bed where all are trimmed to fit. It is meant as a kind of shorthand for the ethical compromises that occurred and not as an allencompassing explanation for these highly complex histories. These figures in the art world had the opportunity for a Faustian bargain because the Nazi leaders themselves cared so much about culture—the visual arts in particular. This book is intended to complement my earlier study, Art as Politics in the Third Reich (1996), which documented the leaders’ involvement in arts administration and their passion for collecting paintings and sculpture. The Nazi leaders devoted an inordinate amount of time to cultural matters. Indeed, culture and propaganda may indeed have been “the war that Hitler won.”16 Their control of the arts was an important element of their totalitarian system. Similarly, their commitment to amassing both private and state art collections stands as a remarkable aspect of their rule. Never before, with the possible exception of Napoleon and his cohorts, had an entire leadership corps been responsible for the acquisition of so much art. Through purchase and plunder (the Third Reich was a “kleptocracy”), their harvest amounted to hundreds of thousands of pieces.17 The Nazi leaders could not have dominated the artistic sphere or have amassed such collections without the assistance of figures in the art world. It was a joint project. The leaders provided the political leverage and the operating capital, and the subordinates offered their skill and expertise. This collaboration occurred in all branches of the art world, hence the organization of this study. It is divided according to various professions that collectively comprise the art world: museum directors and curators, art dealers, art critics, art historians, and artists themselves. One could have added the profession of conservationists, which was a burgeoning field at a time when military actions increasingly threatened civilian areas. But the history of the conservation\n\n6\n\nThe Faustian Bargain\n\nexperts, because of the nature of their employment, is subsumed within other categories, especially that of museum personnel. One could have also included architects, a group usually included in the German term “bildende Künstler” (visual artist); but such individuals often had little to do with actual artworks, and there is already a substantial literature devoted to their activities in the Third Reich. This book is intended as a contribution to the history of professions in modern Germany. While there have been studies on a range of occupations—from doctors and lawyers to engineers and scientists—there has been no comprehensive work on the professions that comprised the art world.18 It is important to note that these professions are so interrelated that boundaries often are blurred. It is not uncommon to find museum directors who were art historians or critics who took over galleries. Placing individuals in specific categories sometimes proved difficult, but I have situated them in a manner reflecting their primary area of activity and the core of their professional identity. While scholars of the Third Reich have long been aware that the Nazi leaders relied upon technocrats to implement their ideologically determined policies—including coordinating the deportations by rail and designing the gas chambers—this study shows how individuals in the cultural realm were also co-opted.19 It is striking how the Nazi leaders elicited the cooperation of not just ideological zealots, but also many who were ostensibly apolitical. One finds a situation in the art world that is analogous to the findings of Christopher Browning and Daniel Goldhagen, who have both shown that “ordinary” people participated in the murder of Jews and other victims of the Holocaust. Of course, one must tread carefully when making comparisons between mass murderers and art looters; the distinction is profound and must be preserved. But, as I argued in Art as Politics, the two projects were interlinked, part of a continuum. With respect to the cultural sphere, one sees a progression from persecution in the professional realm (dismissing Jewish and left-wing employees) to the expropriation of Jewish property (part of the efforts to dehumanize the victims) to the spoliation of cultural property of neighboring countries and, in certain cases (especially in the East), outright destruction. In short, the Nazi leaders’ cultural policies were inextricably bound up with their racial and geopolitical agendas. The collusion of figures in the art world certainly involved the creation of propaganda and the legitimation of the Nazi leaders’s cultural ambitions (as was the case, for example, with philosopher Martin Heidegger).20 Yet the subjects of this book went a step fur-\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nther because they were deeply implicated in the regime’s criminal programs. And while the figures in the art world discussed here must be regarded as second rank when viewed with respect to the entirety of the political and social structure of the Third Reich, they were not merely reactive to the policies and programs of the Nazi state. They often conceived initiatives and then presented these plans to the leaders for approval. Alternatively, they induced the Nazi elite to amend orders. One of the themes in this study concerns the manner in which the experts influenced the Nazi regime’s aesthetic policies. These figures exercised considerable power with regards to art, and they frequently had official positions—often made up on the spot and involving titles like “commissar” or “delegate”—which denoted this influence. The first of the five main figures, Dr. Ernst Buchner, served during the Nazi era as the General Director of the Bavarian State Painting Collections. This post, where he oversaw a network of fifteen museums, constituted one of the most important in all of Europe. A knowledgeable and well-respected expert on premodern German art, Buchner evolved into a politicized accomplice of the Nazi leaders in the initiative to amass huge collections. The second chapter, on art dealers, focuses on Karl Haberstock, arguably the most successful dealer during the Third Reich. Haberstock’s greatest coup was earning the confidence of Hitler and convincing the dictator to appoint one of his friends, Hans Posse, as the director of the Führermuseum in 1939. This led to special opportunities during the war. Haberstock was exonerated by a denazification court in 1949 and reestablished his business in Munich. He and his wife, who often assisted him in the gallery, left their collection to the city of Augsburg, his place of birth. The third chapter is dedicated to art critics, who served as important mediators between the regime and the public during the Third Reich because they communicated ideological precepts manifest in contemporary art. The most important critic in Nazi Germany was Robert Scholz, who wrote for the Party newspaper, Der Völkische Beobachter, and, as of 1937, edited the flashy official Nazi art journal, Kunst im Deutschen Reich (KiDR). Scholz served as the art expert for Nazi ideologue Alfred Rosenberg, and this drew him into the plunder of France as his chief established a notorious agency. In the 1960s, Scholz revived his career as a leading art critic in radical right-wing German publications. Art historians, although usually concerned with works from previous epochs, were closely bound up in the cultural program of the Nazi\n\n8\n\nThe Faustian Bargain\n\nregime; that relationship is discussed in chapter 4. Kajetan Mühlmann serves as an apt example there because he was arguably the single most prolific plunderer in the twentieth century. An Austrian who once worked for the Salzburg festival, Mühlmann led plundering commandos in Poland and the Netherlands. Mühlmann was truly chameleonlike, and toward the end of the war, he relocated to his native region in the Austrian Alps and appeared to join the resistance. In the 1950s, he lived out his life on the idyllic Lake Ammersee outside Munich, reportedly generating income by selling artworks that he had hidden during the war. The final chapter is devoted to artists, in particular Arno Breker. Breker was simultaneously representative of those who chose to collaborate with the Nazi leaders and exceptional because of his stature within the Third Reich. Breker produced monumental sculptures that have become closely identified with the regime, and indeed, he was one of the most celebrated artists in Nazi Germany. Breker’s Faustian bargain included changing the style of his art. His work shifted from a variant of naturalism, where he was strongly influenced by August Rodin, to a monumental and characteristically fascist idiom.21 Until his death in 1991, he was never able to acknowledge that he had compromised his art or helped sustain the Nazi regime. Like many other figures in this study, Breker’s later years were characterized not only by rehabilitation, but also denial. Within each chapter, three or four ancillary figures are discussed in order to show that the representative figures were not unique. Joining Buchner in the chapter on museum directors, for example, are Hans Posse, who made his Faustian bargain by accepting the directorship of the Führermuseum for the opportunity to build the greatest museum of all time, and Otto Kümmel, who headed the Berlin museums and led a wartime effort to reclaim works removed from Germany during the past four centuries. Although these figures receive shorter treatment, their stories are significant and often quite extraordinary. Prince Philipp of Hessen, the son-in-law of the king of Italy who served as a liaison between Hitler and Mussolini while procuring art for the Nazi elite, offers another example of a remarkable life that merits closer examination. There were a number of factors that mitigated against an intensive exploration of each of the art experts discussed in the book: one was access to extant documentation. It is often extremely difficult to research these second-rank figures. The data protection laws of Germany, Austria, and France, among other countries, limit the release of information for those not considered to possess “world historical\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nstature.” In Germany, the archival law states that one must normally wait until thirty years after the death of the subject to gain access to personal files. Even then, it is not always possible to see documents, and institutions still reject requests to work with files on the grounds of data protection. The prosapographical (comparative biographical) approach, as adopted in studies of the courts in ancient Rome or in imperial Germany, is usually pursued when the subjects have had some fundamental connection with one another.22 This is the case with the subjects in this book. The art world tended to be close-knit to begin with, and it was not unusual to have mentors, academic advisers, or clients in common. Frank McDonald, in a well-researched popular novel on the art world, appreciated this, writing, “They’re all connected, the people in the trade, the dealers, international rings, politicians, the people who run the legal side, even the police. Business is business.”23 Yet those in the art world who served the Nazi leaders had even more extensive contact with one another than is customary. Robert Scholz, to take just one example, wrote about Arno Breker and attended the latter’s openings; he saw Haberstock as part of a commission to sell off the purged modern art; and he worked with Ernst Buchner in the storage of plunder of the Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg (Special Staff of Reichsleiter Rosenberg, or ERR) in the Neuschwanstein castle at war’s end. In other words, Scholz encountered nearly all of the figures discussed in this book. This was frequently the case for those who were art plunderers. Because the looting was directed by a limited number of subleaders administering agencies that were ordered to cooperate with one another and because the experts who comprised the staff moved throughout the Reich and the occupied lands in order to carry out their various projects, there was significant contact between them. Even more remarkable is their interaction in the postwar period. As will become evident from the individual histories, these figures continued to have contact with one another after 1945. They were often incarcerated together pending interrogations (or more rarely, during trials) and this deepened the ties between them. Whatever the reasons—and this would include common histories, a shared interest in art, a similar worldview, the same quest for profit, and an equal need for protection from investigators—many of these figures kept in touch after the war. This interaction was both professional and social, and as a result, one can talk about a clandestine postwar network of former Nazi art experts who operated primarily in Bavaria and Austria.\n\n10\n\nThe Faustian Bargain\n\nThis study underscores the extent to which individuals who participated in the criminal programs of the Nazi regime were able to rehabilitate their careers after 1945. This continuity from the Third Reich to the Federal Republic has been recognized in a wide range of other fields extending from medicine and law to academia and the opera24; most famously, the U.S. government engaged Nazi rocket scientists as part of the cold war space race.25 But these histories have been known for some time. The art world is one of the last areas where misconceptions have endured. This is perhaps partly due to a reluctance to implicate certain cultural figures in the crimes of the Nazis. Frank Whitford, for example, has written of the myths that continue to surround certain modernists: The admittedly more ambiguous sympathies of some of the other heroes of German modernism have been kept under wraps more successfully. Architect Mies van der Rohe, for example, director of the Bauhaus when it was closed by storm troopers as a hotbed of “cultural bolshevism” in 1933, signed an open letter in the Völkischer Beobachter less than a year later, urging that Hitler be given absolute power. Among his co-signatories were [Emil] Nolde, the painter Erich Heckel, and the sculptor Ernst Barlach. In 1937 Mies went to work with Speer on the interiors of the German pavilion at the 1937 Paris Universal Exhibition. . . . The fascist or nationalist leanings of leading modernist heroes such as Mies, Nolde, and Barlach make it clear that the conventional picture of art in Nazi Germany is much more complicated than it might seem.26 Just as the myths of the modernist heroes have recently been exploded, the impression that cultural figures were removed from politics during the Third Reich has gradually been amended. Were those involved with the arts embroiled in politics more than members of most other professions? One is reminded of the remark made by the character Wilhelm Furtwängler in Ronald Harwood’s play, Taking Sides: “only tyrannies understand the power of art.” The Nazi leaders possessed a totalistic ideology in which their cultural policies were inextricably linked with their other goals, and they appreciated how culture could be manipulated so as to secure the support of the German people. Within the cultural realm, then, what started out as compromise and collaboration on the part of a few individuals became a widespread phenomenon. For those who remained in Germany, so many were coopted that one can talk of trends that applied to entire professions. In\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\nshort, prosapography becomes social history and, in the process, shows us one of the most insidious aspects of Nazi Germany: that the regime co-opted “ordinary” people—or alternatively, individuals induced themselves—to support the Nazi policies and participate in criminal acts. This brings us back to the knotty and even paradoxical metaphor of Faust. He was, like the figures in this book, exceptional in many respects as he pursued knowledge and power. But Faust’s story also speaks to humans more generally. He shows that ambitions leave us vulnerable and that we often make unfortunate decisions in the face of a greater power. It is in this spirit—knowing that these art experts made unique choices, but ones that many others, perhaps even we ourselves, might have made—that we examine their pacts with the devil.\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nChapter 1\n\nArt Museum Directors\n\nThe history of art museum directors in Germany is an illustrious one, as royal collections were transformed into public ones in the nineteenth and early twentieth century under the guidance of a number of talented and committed experts. Indeed, it has often been rendered as a kind of hagiography: a succession of great men, from Wilhelm von Bode (1845–1929) and Alfred Lichtwark (1852–1914) to Hugo Tschudi (1851–1911) and Ludwig Justi (1876– 1957).1 These complimentary portrayals are not entirely unjustified: museum directors often combined public service with stellar scholarship. But this history cannot be written as a story of uninterrupted progress and triumph. Because these individuals oversaw significant portions of Germany’s cultural patrimony and occupied such highly visible positions, they were subject to extreme political pressures. Scholars including Peter Paret, Christopher With, and Robin Lenman have documented the tribulations and sometimes compromised behavior of museum officials during the Wilhelmine period.2 The profession, of course, suffered even more intrusive political interference during the Third Reich. Those museum directors who\n\n13\n\n14\n\nThe Faustian Bargain\n\nendured the early purges of the Third Reich were pressured to conform to National Socialist ideological dictates to an extent that not only compromised the ethical principles traditionally associated with humanistic enterprises, but made them complicit in the crimes of the regime. The Nazi administration provoked an unprecedented series of crises and so devastated this once august group that the postwar recovery and reconstruction process could not be—or at least was not—carried out without the involvement of tainted members. Museum directors, while possessing considerable erudition and even international renown, comprised one of the most nazified professions in Germany. An inspection of directors’ dossiers from the Reich Chamber for the Visual Arts files housed in the former Berlin Document Center reveals a frequency of Party membership that rivals those of physicians, one of the most highly nazified professions (Michael Kater estimates that 44.8 percent of doctors in the Third Reich “followed the Nazi Party”).3 One should note that below the level of director, museum staff remained more professional and were not as highly nazified. The Berlin State Museums, for example, had fifty-eight staff members in 1943 who were curators, conservators, or scholarly associates; of these, ten were members of the National Socialist German Workers’ Party (Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiter-Partei, or NSDAP), or about one-anda-half times the national average of 10 percent.4 Like physicians, museum directors—as the case of Ernst Buchner demonstrates—facilitated and even occasionally initiated significant components of the National Socialist ideological program of Gleichschaltung (“coordination, which really meant the elimination or nazification of the social and political institutions”), racially based persecution, and military conquest.5 Of course, there are limitations to this comparison: doctors were involved in the killing operations far more directly. But the purging of Jews from museum staffs, the expropriation of Jews’ artistic property, and the rapacious forays into neighboring lands must be seen as related to the genocidal program. Similarly, a number of museum experts espoused a mixture of hateful anti-Semitism and Teutonic arrogance that characterized many perpetrators of the Holocaust. Certain subfields in particular attracted Nazi ideologues. Archeology (Früh- und Vorgeschichte, literally, early and prehistory), for example, became so nazified that one postwar administrator lamented in a letter to Bavarian Prime Minister Franz Meyers that a “Professor Wagner is the only pre-historian in Bavaria left over from the war.”6 Besides Wagner, the Bavarian administrator thought, archeol-\n\nArt Museum Directors\n\n15\n\nogists were either so politically tainted so as to preclude rehabilitation or they were dead. Others in the museum field, such as Ernst Buchner, the director of the Bavarian State Painting Collections (Bayerischen Staatsgemäldesammlungen, or BSGS) from 1933 to 1945 and then from 1953 to 1957, did not adhere to a zealously Nazi outlook. However, his complicity in the oppressive policies of the regime is a central theme in this chapter. Another concern is the postwar rehabilitation of many museum officials who committed criminal acts in the service of the regime. As with many fields, two explanations can be offered. The first was a perception of necessity: millions of artworks had been displaced during the war and the physical state of German museums was disastrous. Even with the assistance of Allies’ Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives (MFA and A) officers, trained professionals were at a premium, and many compromised German museum directors began to resurrect their reputations by cooperating with the Allies in their postwar reconstruction efforts. The second reason was a general antipathy on the part of Germans for postwar justice. Norbert Frei has documented in his recent study on the Germans’ engagement with their own Nazi past: In autumn 1949, immediately after the opening of the Bundestag, all parties began efforts to end, even in part to reverse, the political cleansing [of Nazis] that had been implemented by the Allies since 1945. . . . Above all, this entailed lifting sentences and [pursuing] integration measures to the benefit of an army of millions of former Party members, who almost without exception regained their previous social, occupational, and civil—if not political—status that they had lost in the course of denazification, internment, or similar “political” penalties. By the middle of the 1950s, almost no one continued to fear that their Nazi past would be exposed by state or legal authorities.7 In other words, unless fired and prosecuted by Allied authorities prior to 1949, those responsible for criminal acts normally went free and resumed their lives.8 And during the occupation the Allies were, with reason, almost exclusively concerned with murderers. The failure of postwar justice and denazification is not a new story, but what has not been recognized is that so highly regarded a profession as museum administration featured such criminal behavior and that there was such tremendous continuity between the Third Reich and the Federal Republic.\n\n16\n\nThe Faustian Bargain\n\nIt should be underscored that not all museum directors in the postwar period had been complicit in the crimes of the National Socialist regime. But this is because many either emigrated or pursued a course of “inner emigration” after 1933. Many chose one of these options out of necessity: the 7 April 1933 Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, which provided for the firing of individuals who were Jewish or politically “unreliable,” was invoked to dismiss museum directors, as well as numerous professors at art academies.9 Across the Reich, twenty-seven museum directors and numerous art academy professors were removed from their offices.10 The former included Gustav Hartlaub in Mannheim, Ludwig Justi in Berlin, Gustav Pauli and Max Sauerlandt in Hamburg (the directors of the Kunsthalle and Art and Crafts Museum, respectively), Carl Georg Heise in Lübeck, Karl With in Cologne, Karl Ernst Osthaus in Hagen, Julius Baum in Ulm, Alois Schardt in Berlin, and Emil Waldmann in Bremen.11 Others attempted to work with the new regime and endured a little longer: Georg Swarzenski continued on in Frankfurt through 1934 and Eberhard Hanfstaengl remained at the Berlin Nationalgalerie until 1937. For those museum directors who were not National Socialists and who tried to resist from within, the challenges were often overwhelming. Between intrusive politicians and aggressive local organizations, such as the Combat League for German Culture (Kampfbund für deutsche Kultur), the pressures could be, and often were, tremendous.12 But the fact remains that the museum officials always had the option of resigning (and the choice of remaining in Germany or leaving). It is true that emigration, even before 1939, was not easy: museum professionals were tied to language and national culture more so than artists or musicians, and they often specialized in German art, which had less appeal abroad than in their native country.13 But these educated men had options and were not forced down the path of criminality. Eberhard Hanfstaengl, for example, even at the late date of 1937, when forced out as director of the Nationalgalerie in Berlin, went to work as an editor for the Bruckmann publishing house in Munich.14\n\nErnst Buchner was raised in Munich, arguably the artistic center of Germany after 1871. As Peter Gay wrote of Walter Gropius, “he had Kultur in his bones.”15 Born on 20 March 1892 as the son of an academic painter, Georg Buchner (a representative of the conservative though\n\nArt Museum Directors\n\n17\n\nflourishing “old Munich school” and then a member of the more progressive Munich Secession), the future director of the Bavarian State Painting Collections was constantly surrounded by artists and members of the related professions.16 His father was quite successful, with paintings in the Munich Glaspalast, the municipal museum devoted to contemporary art. His mother was the sister of sculptor Josef Flossmann, who was sufficiently famous to have a street named after him in the Munich suburb of Pasing where Buchner grew up.17 Buchner was raised in an environment populated by artistically inclined individuals, and this also seemingly affected his brother Georg, who became a successful architect and professor at the Munich Arts and Crafts School.18 Buchner was raised with a high regard for artistic accomplishment. From the time of his youth he was brought up with an awareness of the prestige and power possessed by museum directors, and he admitted in later accounts that he had long dreamed of holding the preeminent post in his native Bavaria. It was extremely common for members of the artistic professions to come from backgrounds where they had been exposed to the arts early in their lives. While one commonly finds that writers with bourgeois roots, like the Mann brothers or Franz Kafka, rebelled against parents who worked in the commercial or mercantile sphere, those who entered into the arts administration typically stemmed from backgrounds where their parents were already familiar with this world.19 Buchner was educated to revere high culture and to believe in German superiority in this regard. Such ideas were not uncommon, especially in Bavaria, where conservative forces were among the strongest in the nation. These views were perhaps best reflected by the transplanted Munich citizen Thomas Mann in his wartime reflections on the relationship between culture and nationality, including “Thoughts in the War” (1914) and Reflections of an Unpolitical Man (1918): German Kultur, with its depth, profundity, and engagement with spiritual matters, towered over rational French Zivilisation, let alone the English with their empiricist obsessions. Ernst Buchner shared such views with Mann prior to the latter’s evolution into a liberal democrat and critic of fascism during the Weimar Republic.20 As OSS officer Theodore Rousseau noted after an extensive interrogation of his prisoner at Altaussee, Austria, in 1945: “Any conversation with [Buchner] on his own subject, German painting, reveals at once his fixed belief in a Greater Germany—whether the Führer be Frederick the Great, William II, or Hitler.”21\n\n18\n\nThe Faustian Bargain\n\nSuch nationalistic sentiments were inculcated at an early age in a traditional education of a Volksschule (1902–9), followed by three years at the Theresien Gymnasium (1909–12). Buchner went on to the Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich, but abandoned his studies when war erupted in 1914. He volunteered for the Seventh Bavarian Field Artillery and spent four years at the front. He demonstrated remarkable courage in the field, meriting the Iron Crosses (both first and second class), the Bavarian Military Service Award with Honors, and the War Service Cross.22 By the end of the war, he had been promoted to first lieutenant and commanded a battery. These experiences during his youth were formative and arguably explain later behavior. Historian Neil Gregor, discussing managers at Daimler Benz, has commented on this link between conservatism in Wilhelmine Germany and National Socialism: “Although many were by no means Nazis, they shared the nationalist attitudes of their class and generation and had been socialized in an authoritarian political culture which facilitated their compliance.”23 Buchner himself was to claim after the war, “I felt and acted nationalistically and as a patriot, not as a National Socialist or Party member.”24 When Buchner returned from the front in 1919, he resumed his studies in art history at the university in Munich, with an interlude in Berlin, and developed his professional persona. He became a student of the famed art historian Heinrich Wölfflin (1864–1945), who wrote, among other landmark works, The Principles of Art History, which offered a systematic approach to the analysis of paintings.25 Buchner was not as theoretical as his mentor, but exhibited an aptitude for connoisseurship and developed a remarkable knowledge of Bavarian painting. Buchner was also perhaps influenced by the political views of his Doktorvater: Wölfflin was a conservative nationalist who later joined the pro-Nazi Combat League for German Culture in 1929 and evinced sympathy for Hitler’s cultural program.26 But Buchner’s relationship with Wölfflin predated the Nazis’ rise to power and the two focused more on scholarship, even if there was talk of artistic “instincts” found in the “blood” of certain people, and other ideas not incompatible with National Socialism.27 Buchner was very hardworking and needed only three years to complete his dissertation, titled “Jan Polack: The City Painter of Munich.”28 Focusing on a local figure proved a shrewd decision not just because of the availability of sources, but because he widened his circle of contacts and developed an area of expertise that would have direct application in finding a job. Buchner’s scholarly\n\nArt Museum Directors\n\n19\n\nmethod here, where he examined virtually all of Polack’s works and subjected them to careful formalist analysis, laid the foundation for his later reputation as the preeminent authority on early Bavarian painting. As was often the case in the fine arts administration in Germany, those seeking to make their career relied upon the patronage of senior members of the profession. Accordingly, Buchner remained close to home at the start of his career, as he utilized the connections that his father and he had made over the years. His links to Wölfflin, who possessed considerable influence, were also helpful: Buchner’s longtime assistant in both Cologne and Munich, Dr. Ernst Holzinger (1901–?), as well as Dr. Karl Feuchtmayr (1893–1961), who left the BSGS to succeed Buchner at the Wallraf-Richartz Museum in Cologne in 1933, all shared the same supervisor.29 A more important and lasting supporter, however, was the Generaldirektor of the BSGS, Dr. Friedrich Dörnhöffer (1865–1934). Dörnhöffer thought highly of Buchner, as his recommendation of Buchner for a curatorial position in 1926 attests: “Dr. Buchner is a museum man of the very first rank. . . . He combines to a very rare degree all the qualities of intellect and character that constitute a museum expert: an unusually receptive artistic talent, a passionate devotion to the researching and investigation of individual artworks, a strong sense for quality, an astonishing memory, a love for organizational work, [and] practicality.”30 Dörnhöffer’s concern for his protégé later extended to encouraging Buchner in 1933 to become a Nazi Party member, thinking that this step would aid his career.31 With Dörnhöffer’s help, Buchner rose through the ranks of the Bavarian State Painting Collections, beginning with an unpaid internship in 1921. From 1922 to 1928, Buchner occupied junior staff positions at various Munich museums. He began as a technical assistant in the graphic arts collection and then moved over to the Residenzmuseum. By 1923 he had become an assistant curator, and by 1926, with the help of the recommendation quoted above, he was promoted to the position of curator at the BSGS.32 Another major break came in 1928 when, at the age of thirty-six, he was offered the directorship of the Wallraf-Richartz Museum in Cologne by Lord Mayor Konrad Adenauer. The museum, arguably the finest in Rhineland-Westphalia, was a perfect stepping-stone for an ambitious young museum official with eyes set upon the first-tier positions in Berlin, Munich, and Dresden. Buchner spent four years in Cologne, staging well-received exhibitions, including the 1928 retrospective of Wilhelm Leibl, and developing a reputation as a scholar. In addition to his position as director, he edited\n\n20\n\nThe Faustian Bargain\n\nthe Wallraf-Richartz Jahrbuch, which, although founded only in 1924, was rapidly growing into a distinguished journal. For curators and museum directors in Germany during the first half of the century, advancement within the profession depended upon not only patronage but scholarly productivity. These two elements determined most appointments in what was a highly competitive profession, so scholarship could not be ignored. One need only look at the other top museum administrators to see that they had carved out areas of expertise: Otto Kümmel of the Berlin State Museums was a leading figure in the study of Asian art, and Hans Posse in Dresden published numerous studies on Dutch masters and Renaissance art. Ernst Buchner built on his knowledge of Bavarian art to become a respected authority on the broader field of Northern Renaissance and German Baroque painting, which featured masters such as Grünewald, the Cranachs, and Dürer. He subsequently published a number of studies, including The German Portrait in the Late-Gothic and Early Dürer Period, Historical and Battle Pictures of the German Renaissance, Concerning the Work of Hans Holbein the Elder, and Martin Schongauer as Painter.33 Buchner was frequently consulted by other curators concerning this field. His stature as a scholar was later confirmed in 1941 when he was inducted into the Bavarian Academy of Scholarship and in 1942 when Hitler elevated him to professor at the Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich. His specialization in German art not only reflected his nationalist orientation, but was also a calculated decision that would position him well for the post he coveted most: director of the museums of his native Munich. Bavaria housed more examples of the German old masters than any other region in the country, thanks to the long tradition of Wittelsbach patronage. Buchner realized his longtime ambition to become director of the Bavarian State Paintings Collections in July 1932. This post was regarded as the second most important in Germany, just behind the head of the Berlin network of museums. Thus, the forty-one-year-old Buchner, after a successful interview with the Bavarian Education Minister, Franz Goldenberger, and “highly confidential” discussions with Konrad Adenauer in Cologne (who let him out of his contract), succeeded his friend, the venerable Geheimrat (Privy Counsel) Dr. Friedrich Dörnhöffer, who had held the post since 1914.34 Because of Buchner’s contractual obligations, he did not begin in Munich until 1 March 1933.35 Still, he had realized his ambition to oversee the collections of what were then fifteen institutions (the number has now more\n\nArt Museum Directors\n\n21\n\nErnst Buchner, at age 40, upon appointment as General Director of the Bavarian State Painting Collections, 26 February 1933 (BHSA).\n\nthan doubled), including the Alte and Neue Pinakotheken, the Neue Staatsgalerie, provincial museums in Aschaffenburg, Augsburg, Bamberg, Burghausen, Ingolstadt, Landshut, Schleisheim, Speyer, and Würzburg, and the castles at Ansbach, Bayreuth, and Neuschwanstein (Füssen).36 These various museums housed some 10,500 pictures.37 Despite the worsening economic crisis, which cut into budgetary allocations and made acquisitions increasingly difficult, it was a dream job for an ambitious young museum administrator. Buchner oversaw a talented curatorial staff and started with the considerable salary of RM 14,000 per year (RM 2.5=$1); by comparison, his colleague Ernst Holzinger, a curator, earned RM 4,800 in 1933.38 With the National Socialist seizure of power in January 1933, Buchner faced the prospect of losing his new job. The 7 April 1933 Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service sanctioned the wideranging purges, especially of Jews and socialists, and many non-Party members perceived a threat. While Buchner was not vulnerable because of ethnicity or a left-wing past, it was abundantly clear that top positions, such as his directorship, would be evaluated in terms of the current political climate. Buchner joined the Nazi Party on 1 May 1933—one of approximately a million Märzgefallenen (March violets)\n\n22\n\nThe Faustian Bargain\n\nwho entered the Party that spring—and he viewed the affiliation as a career move.39 It should be stressed that Party membership was not necessary to retain one’s museum position. Many of Buchner’s colleagues kept their posts without joining.40 But Buchner felt vulnerable. He had been attacked in a 28 March article in the Nazi Party paper, Der Völkische Beobachter, for “his relation to Jews,” and letters between him and a colleague, the curator August Levy Mayer, were found when the police searched the latter’s home in March 1933.41 Buchner therefore perhaps thought that he needed protection from similar attacks in the future. After the war, Buchner reflected that many museum directors perceived challenges on the part of “opportunists hungry for jobs and unleashed by kitsch painters.”42 He was apparently not a very demonstrative Nazi: he refrained from using the Heil Hitler greeting, refused to wear the Party pin on his lapel, and occasionally elicited substandard evaluations from Party functionaries.43 One evaluator even suggested that Buchner intentionally avoided interviews and contact with the Party representatives.44 While it is difficult to gauge the degree to which Buchner initially embraced National Socialism, his behavior suggests that he qualified as what Martin Broszat, in his study of German elite of the period, called a “pre-National Socialist.” That is, Buchner stood among the national conservatives who embraced many of the Nazis’ objectives of revising the Treaty of Versailles and reorganizing the country, without supporting their “boundless racial and geopolitical goals.”45 Buchner, despite having certain reservations about the Nazi Party, complied with most official policies. His three children, for example, all joined either the Hitler Youth or the Association for Young Girls (Bund deutscher Mädel) before membership became compulsory.46 In the professional sphere, Buchner carried out his administrative functions in line with the new regulations specified by the Nazi regime. In one recommendation supporting a subordinate’s promotion, he wrote to the Bavarian Education Ministry, “Dr. Busch is of Aryan extraction and his orientation is national.”47 Granted, Buchner had limited autonomy and his decisions concerning personnel were vetted by the Bavarian Education Ministry. But Buchner, like most Germans, did not buck the system. When one of his employees, the restorer Franz Xaver Durneder, was turned down for promotion because he was not a member of the Party, Buchner communicated the decision to Durneder, and there is no evidence of any argument or appeal.48 Buchner was fortunate that he did not have to contend with the purges that arose from the Law for a Restoration of the Professional\n\nArt Museum Directors\n\n23\n\nCivil Service. There was only one individual in the employ of the BSGS to whom the law appeared to have some application—the Jewish curator, Professor August Levy Mayer, who specialized in Spanish Old Masters—and he was evidently already on his way out because he had been caught dealing art on the side (behavior which to this day constitutes grounds for dismissal among museum staff).49 Levy Mayer and Buchner had a cordial relationship, but Buchner never came to the defense of Professor Levy Mayer. Then again, the curator’s situation was hopeless both because of the art dealing and his Jewishness. It is therefore not surprising that Buchner chose not to intervene here. What is more remarkable is that the BSGS in 1933 had no other Jewish or left-wing employees, a fact that speaks to the conservative orientation of the institution. Buchner generally played according to the rules as they were presented to him by the Nazi regime, and this meant that he at times became a cog in the propaganda machinery. In mid-October 1933, for example, as Hitler laid the foundation stone for the House of German Art, Buchner oversaw the work of artists and artisans as they turned the city into “a sea of banners, floral decorations, pine branches, [and] red cloth. . . white-blue Bavarian flags were expressly prohibited.”50 And prior to the opening of the House of German Art in 1937, he succumbed to political pressure and provided space in the Neue Pinakothek for the work of living, officially approved artists. Buchner evidently did not welcome these annual shows. As he noted in 1945, “the temple of art became the annual art fair. . . the great masterpieces of Schwind, Feuerbach, Böcklin, among others, were stuck in a corner each year in order to make room for modern works that were mostly mediocre.”51 But neither did he do much to protest these shows either, as he waited patiently until the House of German Art was completed in 1937 when he could “reclaim” the exhibition space.52 The files of the Bavarian State Painting Collections also record the loans made by Buchner and his colleagues to other institutions and groups that staged exhibitions. The BSGS, for example, lent art in support of the 1935 show Blood and Soil, organized by the local chapter of the National Socialist Cultural Community (NS-Kulturgemeinde, or NS-KG), and for Volk and Family, which was arranged by the Schutzstaffel (SS) Race and Settlement Main Office, which appeared in the Hamburg Kunsthalle.53 In general, Buchner did not appear overly enthusiastic about crudely political shows (he turned down Robert Scholz, the subject of chapter 3, who requested works for Sea Travel and Art).54 But throughout the 1930s, he proved compliant with\n\n24\n\nThe Faustian Bargain\n\nrespect to requests made by those who embraced the Nazi line. There were even instances with regard to exhibitions when he himself appeared rather “brown.” In 1935, for example, Buchner voiced “the strongest objections” to the idea of sending German Romantic art on a tour of the United States, noting that, “America is one of the lands that shelters many enemies of Germany, who persecute with hate all that is German.”55 In sum, despite his occasional discomfort with Nazi policies and practices, it is not surprising that a 1940 evaluation of Buchner by Party functionaries “raised no political objections.”56 Buchner took great pride in his professional reputation, and there were instances when official policies conflicted with his duties as a custodian of these collections. He claimed after the war that he could not bring himself to purchase “Nazi art” that was exhibited in the official shows, and indeed, he resisted pressure to add such works to the BSGS collection.57 Buchner also maintained that he was censored by the Bavarian Education Ministry for criticizing officially sponsored art shown at the Munich Kunstverein (he used the word “banal”).58 Additionally, he continued to promote premodern German art, even when this provoked controversy. The best example of this was the 1938 exhibition, Albrecht Altdorfer and His Circle, which commemorated the 400th anniversary of the death of the artist.59 Because of the religious nature of the art, Hitler, Minister President Siebert, and Gauleiter (Party District Leader) Adolf Wagner all refused to visit the exhibition, and Buchner was accused of turning the gallery into a “Catholic platform.”60 Although he had been promised a subvention of RM 45,000 for the exhibition, Buchner received only RM 15,000. Yet because of positive public and critical reception, revenues came to RM 96,000 (against costs of RM 92,000).61 The difficulties associated with staging exhibitions in Nazi Germany eventually became moot for Buchner: with the advent of war in 1939, the Alte and Neue Pinakotheken closed their doors to the public and the artworks were sent to the provinces for safekeeping. Although restoration work continued in the museums’ workshops through 1944, there were no wartime exhibitions to organize.62 Yet prior to this point, Buchner became embroiled in a more vivid and important conflict concerning the purging of the so-called “degenerate” works from the state collections. This program began in the summer of 1937, but had roots earlier in the decade. In 1935, Buchner had resisted the efforts of Bernhard Rust and other officials in Berlin to sell works by Manet, Van Gogh, and others that had been acquired largely by legendary museum director Hugo von Tschudi before World War I.63\n\nArt Museum Directors\n\n25\n\nLater, in July 1937, Adolf Ziegler, the president of the Reich Chamber for the Visual Arts, led a commission that toured museums and selected works to be removed. Ziegler wielded orders from Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels, and later from Hitler, and himself occupied an important post where he had the ability to issue fines of up to RM 100,000 to members of the Reich Chamber of Culture who failed to obey regulations.64 Buchner did not recognize the right of the Ziegler commission to seize artworks from public galleries. He considered such actions to be an unlawful incursion into an independent (or quasi-independent) sphere, and accordingly, he defended most of the works in his care with great tenacity. Buchner, like Eberhard Hanfstaengl at the Nationalgalerie, refused to meet Ziegler and the commission; he was absent when they appeared at the Neue Staatsgalerie on 9 July 1937 to undertake their “cleansing” action and then even stood up to Hitler directly in a face-to-face meeting that took place shortly thereafter.65 Hitler made certain concessions in this meeting, promising that all affected museums would be compensated for their losses after the seized works had been sold abroad. OSS officer Theodore Rousseau noted that Buchner “was one of the very few German museum directors who succeeded in holding on to their collections of ‘degenerate’ art.”66 While this is not completely true—108 works from the BSGS were taken, including paintings by Franz Marc and Emil Nolde—Buchner did resist this sort of encroachment and also ultimately obtained at least RM 100,000 and certain traditional works as compensation for the Bavarian State Painting Collections.67 Buchner’s record with respect to modernist art is a mixed one— arguably the best that could be expected of a museum official who endured until the end of the Third Reich. There were certainly cases where his sentiments were laudable: he fought to keep works by the German-Jewish Impressionist Max Liebermann in the galleries; he defended the art of Edvard Munch, citing Goebbels’s letter of praise on the artist’s seventieth birthday in 1933; he defended a number of younger Bavarian artists whose work was proscribed; and he vehemently opposed proposals to destroy the purged art, though he was unable to prevent works from being burned in the furnaces of the Berlin Nationalgalerie in 1936 or at Berlin’s Main Fire Station in 1939 (only the latter contained works from the Bavarian collections).68 But Buchner’s record with regard to modern art is not entirely unambiguous. Buchner, for example, wrote to Emil Nolde in 1935 declining the\n\n26\n\nThe Faustian Bargain\n\nartist’s request for a show, and he noted two years later in an August 1937 letter to Professor Lösche that he had never bought or even wanted to buy art created by Emil Nolde (and signed this letter “Heil Hitler!”).69 Ernst Buchner, like a number of Nazis with “moderate” aesthetic views, admired much modern art, including the French Impressionists and Van Gogh but also extending to the more abstract work of Franz Marc.70 Yet he evinced little sympathy for many other Expressionists (especially those often viewed as more “primitive”) or for the exponents of the New Objectivity (who, like George Grosz, were often politically engaged in support of the left). While Buchner demonstrated certain scruples with respect to the “degenerate” art to be confiscated from the collections under his purview, the same cannot be said about his behavior regarding Jewishowned artworks that were seized by the Gestapo in the wake of Kristallnacht (Night of Broken Glass) in November 1938. Just as 1938 marked a turning point in the broader history of the regime—in terms of not only cultural matters, but also foreign policy and the persecution of the Jews—it was also a critical juncture in Buchner’s own personal evolution. By this time, he was on frequently familiar terms with the top Nazi leaders. His meeting with Hitler about the “degenerate art” was the first of many, as the Führer frequently consulted with Buchner on artistic matters while amassing a collection for a great museum he planned at Linz. Yet it is difficult to explain Buchner’s behavior, which, as will be seen, became gradually more immoral with greater proximity to those with power. His motivation for collaborating with the Nazi leaders reflected a combination of rationalization and indoctrination, a very complex process that entailed an inner struggle. Ernst Buchner undoubtedly believed that he was safeguarding the artworks that came under his care. He later portrayed himself as a protector of art with respect to both confiscated works and those endangered by aerial bombardment. There was certainly an element of the classic rationalization: “If I don’t take these paintings, somebody else is going to do it; and it is better that they are in the hands of an expert who will care for them.” He was also faced with the dilemma, what else could be done that would be more credible? Buchner was hardly in a position to countermand the orders of Hitler, Himmler, and the other Nazi leaders. And other German museums were also adding to their collections by way of works seized from Jews. In many respects, his ethical principles were compromised once he had decided to work with the Nazis. Yet he saw himself as a moderate in the arts administration—\n\nArt Museum Directors\n\n27\n\nsomeone who mitigated the destructiveness of the regime’s policies. Buchner, however, did not act solely due to these considerations or rationalizations; he also internalized many of the beliefs that formed the basis of Nazi policies. From an early point in the Third Reich, he exhibited a willingness to administer confiscated art. In December 1933 he wrote the Bavarian Education Ministry, expressing the desire to acquire a bronze sculpture that belonged to, in his words, the “known pacifist and women’s rights activist Anita Augspurg,” who was now in exile (with the collection in custody of the Bavarian Political Police).71 Buchner also gradually evinced less sympathy for Jews. After the difficulties he experienced as a result of his relationship with Professor Levy Mayer, he exhibited a reluctance to assist old friends or acquaintances who came under attack. By the late 1930s, he had become involved with the artworks taken from local Jews by the Gestapo—first as a response to emigration, then as part of the more extensive Aryanization measures. “Aryanization” was the Nazi term for the transfer of Jewish property to gentiles as a means of ridding the economy of Jewish influence, and the regime developed the idea as an organized program: in 1938, Jews were required to report all wealth and register businesses; they were prohibited from functioning as business managers, then finally pressured to cede their assets or sell them for a fraction of the true value.72 Individuals lost their collections in this manner, and many Jewish galleries, like the renowned Bernheimer firm in Munich, were taken over by Aryan trustees. As the confiscated works mounted up, Buchner cooperated with the Gestapo by making rooms available in the Bavarian National Museum. Yet Buchner did far more than store the works. Utilizing his contacts within the Gestapo, he began to purchase the prized pieces for his own collections. Although Führermuseum director Hans Posse had first choice of the confiscated works, Buchner was next in line when it came to the Munich loot.73 In one instance, he inspected seized artworks in the galleries of the Kameradschaft Münchener Künstler (the new name for the Aryanized Bernheimer firm), and bought three works for RM 37,500, including Spitzweg’s That is Thy World, a work that came from the Bernheimers’ stock.74 Later, during the war, Buchner visited another exhibition of confiscated Jewish art at the Baer Gallery in the Kaulbach Strasse.75 Between 1939 and 1944, Buchner bought at least twentyeight works that had been taken from Jews, including paintings by Delacroix and Trübner.76 He made payments to the Gestapo via the Bank der Deutschen Arbeit and spent at a minimum RM 253,610.77\n\n28\n\nThe Faustian Bargain\n\nPainting by Alois Erdtelt confiscated from Jewish resident of Munich, Hugo Marx, and purchased by Buchner for the Bavarian State Painting Collections, June 1940 (BHSA).\n\nThese works were kept separate from the other objects in the collection and were never exhibited publicly. Because this sort of transaction was unprecedented, it was not even entirely clear if the sales were legal.78 In spring 1943, Gauleiter Paul Giesler suggested that the money paid by the BSGS for the confiscated Jewish art be returned by the Gestapo to the State Painting Collections and that the works be considered “Reich property” that was on loan.79 It is evident that this did not occur. Buchner up through April 1944 was still adding to collections under his control by purchasing “artworks out of non-Aryan property.”80 And the fact remains that when Buchner signed off on such purchases, he had few illusions about the enterprise. He cleared all transactions with Gauleiter Adolf Wagner and even sent reports about which second-rank works were suitable for leaders’ offices.81 Beyond his dealings with the Gestapo and the local Gauleiter, Buchner took the initiative and tried to induce Jews to sell their artworks to him at bargain prices, lest they be seized. Buchner later argued that this was humane in that it kept the police away from the owners. He also maintained that he was under pressure to report Jewish collections to the authorities, and that in the case of the Jewish doctor and art historian Dr. August Goldschmidt, who entrusted his art to Friedrich Dörn-\n\nArt Museum Directors\n\n29\n\nhöffer, Buchner kept silent, which “easily could have cost me my position.”82 But Dörnhöffer was Buchner’s mentor, and his silence in this case was arguably more out of loyalty to this important supporter— who would have come under attack for shielding a Jew—rather than a concern for Goldschmidt. Other episodes also cast doubt on Buchner’s concern for Jewish victims. He reportedly visited one Jewish couple, Hugo and Else Marx, who lived on the Franz-Josef Strasse, and expressed an interest in the art they owned. Else Marx, who along with her son filed a claim for lost works after the war, told how, “one day at the end of 1938 or the beginning of 1939 the director of the Bavarian State Gallery appeared at the residence of a member of the Jewish faith Hugo Marx. . . . He forced the persecuted one under the threat of considerable disadvantages to sell against his will the following three pictures to the State Gallery (by Gustave Courbet, Alois Erdtelt, Eduard Schleich).”83 Buchner purchased the artworks on behalf of the state collection for RM 5,000, RM 1,200, and RM 1,200 respectively—well below market-value (the Courbet, for example, was worth approximately RM 15,000).84 Buchner derived a particular advantage by buying directly from the owner because Hitler and the other top political leaders had first choice of the works taken by the Gestapo. By approaching the actual owners, Buchner circumvented this pecking order. While Buchner may have maintained that he was saving works by keeping them in a public collection, the truth was not nearly as straightforward: his sales sometimes appeared as forced because he raised the specter of the Gestapo’s involvement; he did not pay market prices for the works; and he never did anything for the sellers aside from relieve them of their property; that is, there is no evidence that he attempted to help them emigrate or even retain the remainder of their property. In short, Buchner played an important role in the seizure of Jewish collections and the Aryanization of Jewish art dealerships in Munich. In terms of the latter, which included the Kunsthandlung Helbing on the Wagmüllerstrasse, the Kameradschaft Münchner Künstler, the Heinemann Galerie, and the Fleischmann Galerie, he had good relations with their new non-Jewish “trustees.”85 As a result of such acquisition tactics, the collections under Buchner’s purview grew at an unprecedented rate between 1938 to 1944. The BSGS collections swelled from about 10,500 to 12,000 paintings during his tenure.86 Of course, he was not alone among museum directors in taking advantage of the dislocated Jewish property, the prolific booty flowing from the conquered lands, and the favorable rates of\n\n30\n\nThe Faustian Bargain\n\nexchange in the occupied lands. The Folkwang Museum in Essen, for example, spent 6.9 million francs in Paris alone and museum officials in the Rhineland also expanded their collections via purchases in France.87 While Buchner evidently did not embark on purchasing trips abroad like many other directors, he knew most of the major dealers who worked in the occupied Western territories and bought works acquired there from them. This included purchases from many figures featured in chapter 2: Göring’s agent Walter Andreas Hofer in Berlin; Linz dealers Karl Haberstock of Berlin, the Brüschwiller brothers in Munich, Maria Almas Dietrich in Munich, Hildebrand Gurlitt in Hamburg, and Eduard Plietzsch of the Dienststelle Mühlmann (the looting organization in the Netherlands); as well as Theodor Fischer, a Swiss dealer who auctioned off the “degenerate” art and traded for art plundered by Nazis from French Jews.88 Buchner himself rarely traveled to the occupied West, but let these dealers represent him. In the case of Haberstock, the two would sometimes resort to communication via shortwave radio (the Reichssender) as Buchner made decisions on purchases in Paris.89 While this was a rather unusual procedure for German museum directors, Buchner was clearly an important customer for German dealers. Quite typically, he worked more with compatriots who would travel to the occupied lands rather than with foreign agents. These German dealers sometimes acknowledged their lucrative business relationship by making “gifts” to the BSGS, such as Haberstock’s presentation of Max Klinger’s painting On the Beach in 1943 (which still occupies a prominent place in the Neue Pinakothek), and his gift of a rare volume to the museum’s library.90 The problematic nature of much of this commerce should be stressed. In one document, Buchner discussed utilizing the revenue from the sale of “degenerate” art and noted that the BSGS had bought a Madonna with angel by the Master of the Aachener Altar from Baron von Pöllnitz (who worked with Haberstock in France) for RM 100,000, and two paintings by Ferdinand Waldmüller for RM 30,000, the latter two having been confiscated from the Viennese Bloch-Bauer collection and sold by the Aryanization trustees, the Deutsche Allgemeine Treuhand-AG.91 Furthermore, because foreign currency was in short supply, Buchner was in regular contact with Nazi leaders in Berlin: he was ordered in December 1938 to get Reich Minister Rust’s approval for all acquisitions requiring foreign funds.92 Buchner was able to purchase in quantity from these dealers because he was successful in obtaining funds from both the Reich and provincial\n\nArt Museum Directors\n\n31\n\nadministrations. This was never an easy task, and he made repeated pleas so as to keep up with the institutions of other major cities. As he noted in one appeal to the Bavarian State Education Ministry (Bayerische Staatsministerium für Unterricht und Kultus, or BSUK) for more funds, “the extraordinarily modest allocation for purchases of RM 48,000 cannot [permit the BSGS] to enter seriously into competition with the museums from Cologne, Frankfurt a. M., Bonn, Essen, etc. As the responsible head of the famous galleries of ‘the city of art,’ it is difficult for me to have to see how the collections of the mentioned cities at this time have a budget for new acquisitions at their disposal that is more than ten times ours.”93 He met partial success with his requests early on in the war. In 1942, for example, the Bavarian Education Ministry allocated him RM 250,000 for new acquisitions.94 The following year he requested RM 500,000 aside from the normal budget (ausserplanmässig), and he compared this sum to grants given to the Frankfurt Municipal Museums (RM 2.5 million to obtain a private arts and crafts collection), to the Wallraf-Richartz Museum (RM 3.5 million for the Carstanjensche painting collection which included works by Rembrandt, Hals, and others), to Vienna and Berlin (RM 1 million each), and to the Germanisches Nationalmuseum in Nuremberg (RM 500,000 for new acquisitions).95 Reich Finance Minister Schwerin von Krosigk ultimately granted the BSGS RM 350,000 in 1943 and raised this sum to RM 450,000 in 1944.96 But Buchner was never entirely satisfied with the financial support provided to his institutions, especially in light of the fact that Munich had been declared one of the five “Hitler cities,” specifically, “the city of German art.”97 As a result of budgetary allocations that he considered inadequate, and because foreign currency proved difficult to procure, Buchner entered into a number of trades during the war; these had a discernible impact on the nature of the collections under his supervision.98 After the war, Bavarian authorities and the experts they engaged were very critical of these exchanges, viewing them as financially ill-advised and ideologically biased.99 Indeed, Buchner was required to offer justifications for his deals on several occasions after 1945. It is more generous to say that Buchner’s love for premodern German art got the best of him, as he made disadvantageous trades for such works. In this respect, he shared with Hitler the notion that German art of past epochs was underappreciated and undervalued and that greater recognition would come with time.100 Therefore, Buchner gave up at least 112 pictures in exchanges; most notably a portrait of Bindo Altoviti by Raphael (now\n\n32\n\nThe Faustian Bargain\n\nin the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.) that King Ludwig of Bavaria had acquired at great cost (20,000 ducats in Florence), which Buchner traded for a work that he thought was by Matthias Grünewald, Portrait of a Holy Man, although other experts disputed the attribution.101 In this trade for a work by one of the venerated German Old Masters, Buchner also deaccessioned Gerard Dou’s Market Criers (now in the Boymans-van Beuningen Museum in Rotterdam) and Rubens’s Maria with Child. In another trade in 1940, where he came to terms with Karl Haberstock in Berlin, he exchanged works by Renoir (St. Marks in Venice), Monet (Cliffs of St. Adresse), Menzel (The Contribution), and three Dutch works for Hans Thoma’s Girl Feeding Chicken.102 And in one of many deals with Eduard Plietzsch, Buchner traded a landscape by Jan van Goyen and a work attributed to Adam Elsheimer in exchange for a predella by Wolf Huber and Johann Jakob Zeiler’s Study for a Church Ceiling (neither of which are exhibited today).103 Many of Buchner’s exchanges and sales—and only a few are noted above—were made without consulting the curator of the Wittelsbacher Provincial Foundation (Landesstiftung), and this constituted a violation of procedure.104 A representative of the foundation complained after the war that they “had not been kept informed [of exchanges and sales] between 1933 and 1945 and that “the collection of Dutch paintings was hard hit” (at least seventy-four Dutch works were deaccessioned).105 Buchner, then, behaved in a rather autocratic way, but he had Hitler’s personal support to this. The two met in early 1941 to discuss “museum questions,” and the dictator expressed complete confidence in the director. An ancillary idea that both agreed upon was that the Bavarian State Painting Collections would sell certain works to the Führermuseum in Linz and then use the revenue to purchase works that would fill holes in the two Pinakothek collections. Hitler asked Buchner for more specific suggestions, and the director offered a painting from Rubens’s workshop that had been in the Aschaffenburg filial gallery (after thirty years in a depot). Hitler paid RM 200,000 and Buchner used the revenue to buy works by Van Ruisdael, Rottmann, Kalckreuth, and Zick.106 OSS investigators found at least eighteen other works in the Linz collection that came from the BSGS and indicated that there were probably more.107 The deaccessioning of works to the Führermuseum, like the trades, were means of creating opportunities to bolster the Bavarian collections, but they were not uncontroversial in terms of either method or result. These exchanges speak more to a poor job of directing a museum\n\nArt Museum Directors\n\n33\n\nthan to any criminal behavior, but they are important because they grew out of an increasingly nazified worldview. Buchner was instrumental in shaping the venerable collections in his care according to Nazi precepts, and the legacy of his actions is still apparent today. It should be stressed that foreign currency was at a premium and that trades were therefore a common acquisition tactic. But trades, by definition, entail cutting into the permanent collection. Buchner was sufficiently professional to realize that a great encyclopedic museum (that is, the entire collection of the BSGS), needed examples from all the important phases and schools in the history of art, and he tried to prevent any one area from being gutted completely. He turned down a request to trade French modern works for a Bellini, noting explicitly that he intended to preserve this part of the collection, and he rebuffed Karl Haberstock’s approach to trade for paintings by Max Liebermann.108 Yet, as noted above, Buchner’s love of German art was too strong, and he made poor decisions. One need only see the letters in the files of the BSGS; they document the postwar efforts by Eberhard Hanfstaengl (1886–1973), Buchner’s successor as director, attempting to nullify or reverse certain trades. In 1950, he was pressuring Karl Haberstock to return a Renoir and a Degas, which had been exchanged for another work by Hans Thoma (The Bible Lesson), and Generaldirektor Hanfstaengl’s tone was one approaching desperation.109 He was not able to undo Buchner’s work, and even today, many curators in the BSGS view Buchner’s trades as unmitigated disasters. Very few paintings Buchner acquired by trade, one curator noted, still hang on the walls today. Another BSGS curator, Konrad Renger, who is an expert in Flemish Old Masters noted with wit, “Berlin lost artworks due to the war; Munich lost them due to the director.”110 The trend toward unbridled arrogance continued as the war progressed and led to an increased disregard for both museological convention and international law. For Buchner, the nadir came with the peak of the Germans’ expansion in the summer of 1942 when he led an expedition into unoccupied France in search of the famed Ghent altarpiece, the Van Eyck brothers’ elaborate work, The Mystic Lamb. This twelvepaneled depiction of Christ surrounded by prophets, martyrs, and knights was one of the first oil paintings, and ranks, in the words of art historian Colin Eisler, “among the very greatest works of art in Northern Europe from the fifteenth century.”111 The mayor of Ghent had taken the altar from St. Bavo’s Cathedral and entrusted it to the French in May 1940 as he and other compatriots feared a repeat of the Schlieffen\n\n34\n\nThe Faustian Bargain\n\nplan, a German invasion of the West through Belgium. The French authorities evacuated the altar from Paris to Pau in the unoccupied region as part of their own safeguarding measures, which included moving most of the Louvre’s contents to châteaus in the south. The altar remained in a local museum in Pau until 1942, when Buchner received orders from the Reich Chancellery in June 1942 to remove the multipaneled altar and transport it to Germany. During postwar interrogations, Buchner remarked that the order came by complete surprise and that he had never discussed the subject with authorities. But this claim seems rather disingenuous considering Buchner’s area of expertise (he knew this work exceedingly well, including its provenance) and the fact that this piece had great political significance: four panels had been repatriated to the Belgians in the Treaty of Versailles as compensation for the destruction of cultural treasures by the Germans in World War I (two from the Kaiser-Friedrich Museum in Berlin and two from the Alte Pinakothek in Munich), and the altar had emerged as a focal point of the revanchist art policy of the Nazis.112 Buchner also maintained that the order he received from the Reich Chancellery “specifically stated that the altarpiece was not being confiscated by the German Reich, but was being put out of danger from air attacks so that it could eventually be restored to its legal owners.”113 While Buchner’s experience at the front in World War I had exposed him to the ravages of war, and he perhaps genuinely feared the destruction of art that he loved, there were actually no military operations or air raids in this region at the time. Buchner later confessed to OSS interrogators “in an unguarded moment” that the altar was destined for the Kaiser Friedrich Museum in Berlin (now the Bode Museum).114 It is also significant that the panels were first stored with more than 21,000 artworks plundered from French Jews by the Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg (ERR), at Schloss Neuschwanstein, which was part of Buchner’s bailiwick.115 In the summer of 1944, he helped transfer the altar to the salt mine at Altaussee, where Hitler safeguarded the works destined for the Führermuseum, among other treasures.116 Throughout the entire undertaking, Buchner was sworn to strict secrecy, which is arguably also an indication that it was not an entirely legal maneuver.117 Buchner’s sojourn to Pau remains a remarkable, if still murky, episode in his career. On the exculpatory side, one finds that Buchner’s museum would not have been the beneficiary of the “transfer” and that the enterprise was apparently sanctioned by the French authorities. Vichy Prime Minister Pierre Laval approved an order on 3 August 1942 assenting to the removal, and the Vichy militia escorted Buchner and his associates\n\nArt Museum Directors\n\n35\n\nA panel of the Van Eyck altar with protective coverings over fragile areas—measures taken by Buchner and his staff, 1945 (NA).\n\nto the demarcation line as the altar made its way back to Germany via Bordeaux, Tours, Dijon, and Belfort.118 Buchner was accompanied by the chief restorer of the Bavarian Museums, Professor Reinhard Lischka, and they used the professional transport firm that they normally engaged, the Spedition Wetsch (Wetsch had also carted off the purged modern art from the BSGS in 1937).119 Additionally, Buchner’s actions might be justified on the grounds that Himmler and the SS were hatching plans to seize the altar. An art historian and expert on the Van Eycks by the name of Dr. Martin Konrad had been charged with securing the treasure in June 1941, and the SS very well may have succeeded if not for the efforts of the head of the Wehrmacht’s Art Protection (Kunstschutz) office, Franz Graf von Wolff-Metternich (1893–1978), who managed the astonishing feat of preventing Himmler’s agents from crossing over the demarcation line into the unoccupied zone. The leaders of the Security Service (SD) in France were confident they could pull off a secret raid with Dr. Konrad but decided that this was inappropriate considering the renown of the altar.120 The role of the SS in the removal of the altar remains uncertain. According to some postwar reports, Buchner was escorted by an SS commando,\n\n36\n\nThe Faustian Bargain\n\nbut this seems not to have been the case, and the files in the Bavarian State Painting Collections contain letters where he thanks a Wehrmacht captain named Wilhelm Abert and his cohorts in a motor pool for their assistance.121 What was less ambiguous was that the Germans were claiming ownership of the masterpiece. Additionally, it was obvious that Laval had no authority to sign over Belgian property entrusted to the French for purposes of safekeeping. In the end, one must recognize that the Reich was planning to seize the altar as its own, and Buchner knew it. As he wrote his counterpart in the capital, Otto Kümmel of the Berlin State Museums, who was not only director of the Berlin State Museums but also special commissar for Securing Foreign Museums and German Cultural Objects: “with you I enthusiastically greet the fact that finally the screaming injustice of the Versailles Treaty, in which top works of European art that were paid for with good German royal currency (Königtalern) were robbed from us, and that they will again be restituted.”122 While Buchner may have been acting out of principle and because of orders from above, he himself benefited from the enterprise: after the altar was removed to Germany Hitler awarded Buchner a special honorarium of RM 30,000 (officially justified as compensation for evaluating potential purchases).123 The seizure of the Ghent Altar was followed by a similar incident approximately one month later, in late August 1942, when Buchner led an expedition to Leuven to confiscate four panels of Dirk Bouts’s triptych The Last Supper.124 This work, like the Van Eyck brothers’ altar, had also been awarded to the Belgians in the Treaty of Versailles as stipulated in Article 247. Two of the four panels had been in the Alte Pinakothek until 1920, and this perhaps induced Buchner to take the lead in pushing for its “repatriation.”125 On 7 July 1942, he wrote to Walter Hanssen at the Führerhaus in Munich, Through the dictated peace of Versailles, not only the panels of the Ghent Altar of Hubert and Jan van Eyck, but also four panels of the Leuven Last Supper Altar of Dirk Bouts were carried off to Belgium without justifiable legal title. The panels are among the most exquisite in old Netherlands painting. The panels are currently housed in the Church of Peter in Leuven and are in great danger from air attack. In consideration of the reparations and the screaming injustice of the Versailles Treaty, nothing stands in the way of an immediate return of the panels. Permit me the suggestion that the four panels be returned to Germany.126\n\nArt Museum Directors\n\n37\n\nHitler approved Buchner’s request to pursue the Bouts altar and the actual seizure took place on 28 August.127 The trips to Pau and Leuven, although comparable in many respects (including Buchner’s repetition of the phrase “screaming injustice of the Versailles Treaty”), should be viewed as separate.
