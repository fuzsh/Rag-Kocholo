I had written to Lohse in May asking to interview him for the book I was writing about the complicity of art experts in Nazi plundering (The Faustian Bargain: The Art World in Nazi Germany, published in 2000). Bruno Lohse had been Göring’s art agent in Paris during the war, and in 1943 he became the deputy director of the Paris branch of the Special Task Force of Reich Leader Rosenberg, the Nazi art-­plundering agency otherwise known as the ERR (Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg). Lohse had responded to my letter informing me that while he had little information of use to offer, he was happy to meet for lunch in Munich. The reasons he agreed to meet were complex—as was Lohse—but at the heart of the matter was an inextinguishable self-­importance deriving from his years as the self-­proclaimed “king of Paris.” He cared deeply about the way he was treated in historical accounts and wrote letters to authors and publishers over the years, including to Metropolitan Museum of Art director (and former Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives officer) James Rorimer, after the latter released his memoir Survival in 1950. Lohse later penned a missive to Paul List, the German publisher of David Roxan and Kenneth\n\n1\n\n2\n\nPrologue\n\nWanstall’s pathbreaking 1964 book, The Rape of Art, where he again contested certain statements.1 For my part, I wanted information from Lohse. I hoped he would tell me about the postwar lives of the art plunderers I was studying in Faustian Bargain—and he did. As I gradually learned, the wartime networks of Nazi dealers persisted after the end of the conflict, and individuals like Lohse grew prosperous selling to museums and collectors—often cashing in on goods with complicated wartime pasts. I met with Lohse hoping he would tell me about the disposition of looted art that had gone missing— and he did. For me, our meetings were fact-­finding missions. Yes, I sometimes needed to have coffee or a meal with him, but that was a means to an end. I shared much of the information I obtained from Lohse and his friend Peter Griebert: I sent a report to the Federal Bureau of Investigation after I was shown a fourteenth-­century altarpiece from a church in Venice, turning to a friend in the Department of Justice to pass along my concerns in this instance; and at other times, I shared my “intelligence” with organizations like the Art Loss Register and Christie’s auction house. My meetings with Bruno Lohse were not Tuesdays with Morrie feel-­good visits but a kind of game—I tried to pry information from him and he attempted to outfox me. I soon appreciated his charm—it’s what made him Göring’s man and shaped his postwar career in profound ways. I do not want to give the impression that I befriended him or in any way seem to whitewash his deeds. Yes, I was friendly to him; that was necessary. But it was motivated by my ever-­increasing desire to understand him, and to use his career as a way to comprehend not only the art world but also the way the Nazis had persisted and often thrived in the postwar period. I engaged with Bruno Lohse because it was the only way to get information about his world—the archives becoming relatively silent after 1950 when denazification came to an end. The Central Office for the Investigation of National Socialist Crimes in Ludwigsburg was created in 1958 to research and prosecute Nazi criminals, but the staff focused more on active killers rather than art plunderers (even though the two were not mutually exclusive, as was likely the case with Lohse).2 The fact remains: in order to understand the postwar period, I had to rely on the few surviving actors, and Lohse was one of the last. Yet I am mindful of journalist Gary Younge’s observation: “Interviewing Nazis is a tricky business, as I can attest from personal experience.”3 Over the decades since the war, Lohse had offered very limited cooperation to various authors, including to Heinrich Fraenkel in 1961, who\n\nPrologue3\n\nin the course of writing a now well-­known biography of Göring, interviewed not only Lohse but also the latter’s wartime rival, art dealer Walter Andreas Hofer, as well as Monuments officers like Rose Valland and Professor S. Lane Faison, who had been part of the Allied effort in the west to safeguard cultural property and then restitute the looted objects.4 Lohse also spoke with author Matila Simon for her 1971 book, The Battle of the Louvre, and told her many of his favorite stories, such as saving the art and ERR card catalogue held in the Neuschwanstein castle: this Kartei was a set of cards that comprised an inventory of the plundered works: each card detailed the original owner, which proved crucial to the postwar restitution process.5 In the late 1990s, Lohse answered questions (in French) posed by then filmmaker Anne Webber (who went on to co-­chair the Commission for Looted Art in Europe). Webber went to Lohse’s flat in Munich, but he would not let her in and he did not appear in her film (Making a Killing, 2000) about the Goodman heirs’ efforts to recover their family’s property. Some of the art—a Degas landscape, for example—was evidently looted by Lohse. As best as I can judge, Bruno Lohse spoke more freely with filmmaker and journalist Maurice Philip Remy, and they had a relationship that lasted years. Generally speaking, Lohse typically interacted with those interested in his life. He was, after all, unrelentingly egotistical. But Lohse was also compelled to meet with researchers because he felt unfairly treated by history and he sought redress wherever he could find it. Another consideration that induced Lohse to speak with me grew out of his postwar experiences, when he was arrested by the Americans and interrogated by the experts in the Office of Strategic Services’ (OSS) Art Looting Investigation Unit (ALIU).6 Lohse maintained a fondness for the Harvard-­educated art historians who comprised the ALIU. The Americans and Lohse had found a modus vivendi that helped lead to the restitution of thousands of works, and the ALIU agents had treated him respectfully as a professional counterpart. Lohse went on to spend five years in confinement, an unusually long time for an art plunderer, but during his incarceration, he kept in contact with these ALIU officers—James Plaut (1913–96), Theodore Rousseau (1912–73), and S. (short for Samson) Lane Faison (1907–2006). Lohse hoped that they would help him secure an early release from the Cherche-­Midi prison in Paris, and, in fact, the three ALIU officers responded positively. They wrote letters to the French authorities, shared what they could of their ALIU reports, and provided some of the documentation they had collected. This assistance in the late 1940s established a foundation for relationships that continued during the\n\n4\n\nPrologue\n\nsubsequent decades. In Lohse’s eyes, my PhD from Harvard put me in their company, and apparently rendered me worthy of his time. It turns out I had known two of the three ALIU officers from my time at Harvard (1983–93). James Plaut lived near Cambridge and would meet me for lunch at the Harvard Faculty Club, and Lane Faison lived in Williamstown in western Massachusetts, where I visited him on a number of occasions. Already back in 1940, Faison had been chair of the art history department at Williams College after four years as an assistant professor at Yale (1932–36) and then an additional four as an assistant at Williams.7 In short, Faison had a stellar academic career prior to the war and he was known as something of an institution, even after his formal retirement in 1976. Lane Faison’s friend and colleague James Plaut also had a promising early career at Harvard; by 1939, he was the first director of the Boston Museum of Modern Art (later the Institute of Contemporary Art, which he co-­founded).8 After the war, Plaut publicized the topic of Nazi art looting by penning important pioneering articles in magazines like ARTnews (August 1946) and the Atlantic (September and October 1946).9 Both Plaut and Faison enjoyed telling their stories, which extended beyond tracking Nazi-­looted art. I recall Plaut’s account of interviewing captured U-­boat crews in the North Atlantic, an assignment he had prior to moving on to direct the ALIU in November 1944. Lohse did not know of my friendships with Plaut and Faison when he agreed to meet with me in 1998, but he asked about them early on in our initial conversation. I eventually became a kind of conduit between Lohse, on the one hand, and Plaut and Faison, exchanging greetings and hand delivering the occasional letter. Among all the former ALIU officers, Ted Rousseau had grown closest to Lohse, but he died in 1973 before I could interview him. I remember clearly my first meeting with Bruno Lohse in June 1998 at the Zentralinstitut in Munich. It was a hot summer afternoon as I sat in the shade offered by the massive neoclassical portico of the building commissioned by Hitler and designed by Paul Ludwig Troost. Looking up, I saw a mosaic of green and orange swastikas embedded in the ceiling. It seemed a fitting place to wait for a Nazi art plunderer. I was unsure what to expect. Would he be friendly or hostile? Expansive or reticent? Frank or deceitful? These and other questions passed through my mind. Finally, a large Mercedes pulled up; an elderly gentleman with a shock of silver hair and dark glasses sat in the back seat. He had an imperious air about him. A younger man, still in his fifties, drove the impressive automobile. Was this his chauffeur? Dr. Lohse was taking me to lunch in style. We were going\n\nPrologue5\n\nto a restaurant—an elegant Bavarian beer garden—but not to his home. His Munich residence, rumored to be filled with valuable artworks looted during the war, was just one of the many mysteries surrounding Lohse. But that day, we headed toward a very public beer garden; it would be several more years before I was invited to his apartment. I sat in the back seat next to him as we drove southeast, along the English Garden and into the lush green valley that cradles some of Munich’s most fashionable neighborhoods. Upon our arrival at the beer garden, the Freisinger Hof, we were escorted to Lohse’s preferred table. He was well known here—I would learn that this was the case throughout much of Munich—and he held court in his self-­aggrandizing manner, arranging the seating and taking the lead in ordering. He insisted that we begin with soup, a practice that would become customary when I dined with him. It was usually some fritellen (crêpe) soup with chicken, which I rather liked, although sometimes he insisted upon the less agreeable Leberknödelsuppe, or liver dumpling soup. I suffered through a bowl of the latter during several early meetings, but subsequently developed the confidence to amend the order to some other kind of soup. He was intimidating in a way that is difficult to describe, while at the same time pleasantly engaging. At our first meeting, we began with polite small talk, chatting about the splendors of Munich and the region’s unpredictable weather. For all of the intrigue surrounding this notorious Nazi art plunderer, he looked more like a retiree, an elderly uncle dressed simply in a striped golf shirt and slacks. His build alluded to a past athleticism. At six foot four and now over three hundred pounds (he had gained weight since the war), he was physically imposing. But on this particular afternoon, he seemed to be playing the role of cordial older man as he told stories from what I later learned was an established repertoire. It was not until later, when Dr. Lohse became “Bruno” to me and our meetings took place more frequently, that I saw the other side of him. His mood would shift, his face turning red as he became angry and aggressive. He spewed vulgarities that I found jarring (in part because German profanity can be so graphic: “Kiss my ass” in German is “Lick my ass”—­Leck mir den Arsch), and language like this left me somewhat shocked and off-­ balance. Yet it was in these moments that the reports of his more nefarious deeds seemed not only imaginable but credible. In spite of the many secrets he harbored, Dr. Lohse had his stories— his “safe” stories—that he felt free to tell without the danger of suffering serious consequences or disclosing incriminating information. He had\n\n6\n\nPrologue\n\nbeen interrogated so many times right after the war and had made such a concerted effort to prepare his defense for the Paris trial of 1950 that he had developed self-­serving narratives that he retained nearly his entire life. Still, as I got to know him, he seemed to grow more open and outspoken. By 2001, the ninety-­year-­old Lohse felt immune from prosecution or other serious consequences resulting from his wartime activities. He was still mistrustful, but he had loosened up. At times, this volubility appeared to stem from his own sense of resignation—the good old days were over and his stories were all he had left. When I first met him, he was eighty-­ seven years old: still sharp in general, but prone to repetition and memory lapses. The lapses would increase in frequency and scope with age, yet his basic narratives remained the same. My relationship with Lohse proceeded in stages, and all of our early meetings were in public places. The Freisinger Hof, or what Lohse and Peter Griebert called “the Croats,” was the most common and comfortable venue for him. At these lunches, Lohse talked about his relationships with the former OSS officers who had interrogated him at war’s end; he talked about Hofer and other fellow art dealers during the Third Reich— especially Karl Haberstock and Kajetan Mühlmann, figures I was writing about in The Faustian Bargain. Lohse offered me specific stories and details that I included in the book, especially about their activities during the postwar era. The paper trail for these art plunderers, as for most second-­ rank figures in Nazi Germany, largely dried up after their interrogations and denazifications in the late 1940s. The oral history offered by Lohse and other old Nazis provided one of the few ways to reconstruct the postwar experiences of this cohort. Lohse’s remarks strengthened my belief that the former Nazi dealers had maintained a network in the postwar period and continued to engage in business with one another. At the start of my sabbatical in the summer of 2000, I was living in Munich, making it easier to contact Lohse. I had his telephone number and could ring him up somewhat freely. Not long after I had settled in, Lohse invited me to his home. He suggested that I come for Kaffee und Kuchen (coffee and pastries). This sounded very promising indeed. He asked if I knew the address, and I told him I did. What I did not reveal is that I had bicycled by his apartment building on several occasions. As I looked up at the balcony to his flat, I had imagined the artworks housed inside. Now I might see if the rumors about the art in his apartment were true. And so I arrived at Bruno’s home for the first time in September 2000. I had brought pastry and wine from the Alois Dallmayr emporium, the\n\nPrologue7\n\nHarrods of Munich, which I knew Lohse liked. I had also brought along a micro tape recorder. Lohse greeted me at his front door and invited me in. He appeared as friendly and relaxed as could be. He had a housekeeper, Frau Goebel, but otherwise his was a fairly modest operation. The apartment was small—three rooms plus a kitchen and bathroom—­although there was a neighboring unit that housed some sort of office, which I subsequently briefly glimpsed once or twice. What I found most exciting, however, was the art on his walls. Lohse had several works by Emil Nolde, including a landscape oil painting of a marsh rendered in red and black hues, as well as a watercolor of a bright sunflower. Surprised that he placed Expressionist works in this “public” room, his living/dining room, I turned around to survey vibrant watercolors by Marianne von Werefkin and Gabriele Münter, two artists associated with the Blue Rider group that flourished in and around Munich prior to World War I. His study, which was also his television room, contained a wall filled with Dutch Old Masters. There were about a dozen pictures there, mostly pieces with smaller dimensions. I thought to myself how easy it would have been to conceal the smaller works in his luggage as he traveled back from France during the war. All told, the art in Lohse’s apartment was worth millions. I had to suppress the many questions running through my mind, beginning with how had he acquired these works and were any of them looted? These questions would continue to preoccupy me in the years to come. For the moment, I was more concerned with getting Bruno to retell an intriguing story he had shared in our earlier meetings: the one about Georges Wildenstein offering him a choice of three paintings and his subsequent relationships with family members. We sat down at a table among the German Expressionist works, drinking coffee, eating Kuchen, and exchanging pleasantries. Before asking him about the Wildensteins, I shared my upcoming plans with Lohse: I was headed to Lake Constance for a conference on networks of persecution (it was not lost on me that Lohse himself was part of such a network). His reaction to the mention of the Holocaust, then and later, was mixed: at times he appeared remorseful and apologetic, but mostly he donned the cloak of cynicism and declared, “It is all shit” (Es ist alles Scheisse). He maintained that it was pointless to talk about, let alone study, the Holocaust. For him, it was best to ignore the darker side of the Third Reich. He could never understand how the men he revered—and Göring in particular—had become mass murderers, and he doubted that historians could do much to explain this history. I responded that scholars would never get it 100 percent right, but what\n\n8\n\nPrologue\n\nwas the alternative? Not to study history (and this history in particular)? Lohse appeared unconvinced. His was a cynical worldview, unconcerned with ethics or moral responsibility. He was also particularly adept at suppressing parts of the past that he perceived as uncomfortable: “Es ist alles Scheisse”—as best I could tell—stood as his governing philosophy. Because Lohse was notoriously temperamental, I expected that he would become angry if we discussed the Holocaust in depth, and so I changed the topic of conversation, at least temporarily, to something less controversial: hiking in Switzerland. Bruno brightened as we talked about the grandeur of the Alps, and then it was time. “Tell me again about Monsieur Georges Wildenstein and the three paintings in Paris after the war?” I asked. “Na, ja,” Lohse responded, and we were off. The story wasn’t quite as good—as rich in detail—as the first time he’d told it the previous June. But there were always new details when he retold a story. And significantly, this time I captured it on tape. I had asked for and received his permission before placing the recorder on the table that we shared, even though I did not have him sign a formal release. I had worried that the recorder might make him more reserved. Yet I thought it best to have a recording of the story in case I was challenged by Wildenstein family members, who had been known to initiate litigation to protect their reputation. Later, after I left Lohse’s apartment and cycled back to my own, I took that tape out of the recorder, labeled it carefully, and then packed it away. A key individual who was present in all my interactions with Lohse was his onetime business associate, private secretary, and friend, Peter Griebert. I had encountered Peter on the very first meeting with Lohse, when I was picked up at the Zentralinstitut by the Mercedes; but I had believed at the time that Peter was Lohse’s driver, or aide, not realizing he was a successful art dealer in his own right. Peter remained a mystery to me throughout my first meetings with Lohse. I gradually ascertained from his interventions in the conversation that he was in the trade and also a longtime friend of Bruno, but beyond that he was guarded about his personal life and appeared somewhat defensive, even territorial. I didn’t fully understand the relationship between the two men, and neither Bruno nor Peter made any attempt to clarify it for me. Indeed, throughout our first few meetings, I was under the impression that Peter was Bruno’s nephew; perhaps Peter had said Bruno was “a kind of uncle” and I had mistranslated the German. I really did not know. I did not envision the role that Peter would play as I came to know Lohse and tried to uncover his secrets. Peter later explained how his father, an art historian, had studied in\n\nPrologue9\n\nBerlin with Bruno in the 1930s. According to Peter, they had not been particularly close, but none of the other students really cared much for Bruno, whom they regarded as arrogant and moody. Peter recounted that his father took pity on him and made an effort to be gracious. In the spring of 1950, just after his release from prison in Cherche-­Midi, Bruno called on the elder Griebert. The judges at the Paris Military Tribunal had told him he could transition back home in the French Zone in Baden-­ Württemberg, and the Grieberts were the only people in that part of Germany whom Bruno knew. Emaciated from years in prison and required to report in with French authorities every day, Lohse had begged the Grieberts for sanctuary. For many years, my understanding of this story was that Lohse remained with them on Lake Constance for months. It was much later, when I found Lohse’s denazification files, that I realized he spent less than three weeks in the area before returning to Munich. Peter Griebert’s stories, I learned, also needed to be treated with caution. Yet over time, Peter began to help me pry information from Bruno, offering statements of clarification and even follow-­up questions. Although Lohse did not supply a tremendous amount of new information as a result of Peter’s interventions, I began to view the younger dealer as an ally in my efforts. I came to respect his knowledge of looted art issues. I also learned that he had helped the Goodman heirs pursue lost family property back in the 1970s and 1980s.10 Peter certainly kept up with current publications. At one point in the summer of 2000, he made a joke about both Bruno and me being photogenic: in February 2000, Hugh Eakin from ARTnews magazine interviewed me regarding my contact with old Nazis who had been art looters.11 The article featured a photo of Bruno and me at “the Croats” that Peter had taken with my camera. Both Bruno and I were smiling in the shot, and it all looked very friendly. I had never asked either Peter or Bruno for permission, and the magazine’s editors had not requested that I do so. The article was harmless enough, though it did announce to the art world that Dr. Bruno Lohse was alive and well and residing in Munich.12 Griebert was not visibly upset by the photo, but he wanted me to know that he was aware of its existence. A topic that resurfaced a number of times with Lohse and Griebert concerned the photos and documents that the old art plunderer kept in his Munich apartment. Actually, I came to understand that there were two sets of papers: photos and selected documents he showed me on several occasions (including Göring’s 20 April 1946 affidavit), and those in the so-­called Geheimkoffer (literally, “secret suitcase”). I heard of the Geheim-\n\n10\n\nPrologue\n\nkoffer only from Peter, but I came to understand that it contained the most compromising extant documents. It was not uncommon for individuals of that generation to keep wartime papers in contemporaneous luggage, as did Munich art dealer Hugo Helbing, whose Nachlass (literary estate) was found in an old leather suitcase in 2004 (the suitcase remains part of the archive housed at the Zentralinstitut in Munich). Around the time of Lohse’s death in 2007, I learned that the Geheimkoffer also reportedly contained thirty volumes of wartime diaries, all entered in moleskin journals. But I did not know that at the time. I nevertheless asked Lohse often what he planned to do with his documents after his death and he replied that he would have them destroyed. This was part of his cynical worldview. I always averred that I would gladly take them, and Lohse, on several occasions, said, “Well, fine, you can have them.” I was caught by surprise in March 2007 when I received an unexpected call from Peter. Bruno had died—and he had left something for me. I was in Munich, trying to advance efforts to return a masterpiece by Camille Pissarro to the Fischer family, so I arranged to meet Peter for an early lunch of Bavarian Weisswürste. He handed me a large manila envelope and said, “Bruno wanted you to have these.” The envelope contained many of his photos from the ERR days, as well as a collection of various documents from the 1930s to 1950s. It was not the Geheimkoffer, but to me it represented a treasure trove; I knew then that I would one day write a book about Bruno. The documents also provided a window into his personality: he had carefully selected evidence that supported his narratives as part of his attempt to shape his legacy. Lohse wanted to be known as Göring’s “man in Paris,” as someone acquitted by the Paris Military Tribunal, and as part of a network of international art dealers—all points reinforced by the carefully chosen documents and articles he left to me. It would be my job to read them critically and to place them in a broader context, which is the aim of this book. Separating Lohse’s stories from the truth became a central challenge in writing his biography (the dearth of archival sources, the culture of silence among the participants, and the general desire among most of those involved to conceal this history being other challenges). But I believe it to be worth the effort. Bruno Lohse’s stories yielded insights that are key to understanding what transpired with regard to art looted by the Nazis during the Third Reich, as well as in the postwar period.13 True, we are working with incomplete information when it comes to Bruno Lohse and others in this segment of the art world. Complexity and\n\nPrologue11\n\na paucity of information are challenges, no doubt, yet it has been possible to make progress in understanding this history. Even seventy-­plus years since the war, we make new discoveries and previously closed records are opened. On 24 December 2015, for example, the French prime minister issued a decree allowing the opening of files with materials dated “as late as December 1960 that relate to matters that happened between September 1939 and May 1945.”14 This meant that for the first time, researchers could see important documents pertaining to collaboration and to the murder of some seventy-­six thousand Jews who were deported from French territory, among other topics. This order proved a boon to me, as I was able to travel to Le Blanc (just south of the Loire Valley) to the Dépôt Central d’Archives de la Justice Militaire to conduct further research. The archives are housed in what feels like a rather impenetrable and sizeable military base (but in actuality serves as the facility of the local gendarmerie). To gain entry, researchers must produce a passport and have an escort. The archives of the French Military Justice authorities contain the records of the Tribunal Militaire Permanent from the Seine, a body that tried Bruno Lohse and other ERR staffers in 1950. The trial records run to hundreds of pages, and while the documents left many questions unanswered, they also provided a new perspective on Lohse’s wartime years. Understanding Lohse is like peeling an onion (to appropriate the title of Günter Grass’s autobiography, which seems somewhat justified considering the Nobel laureate in literature and left-­leaning public intellectual revealed in the book the secret he concealed for many decades—that he had been conscripted into the Waffen SS toward the end of the war).15 With both Nobel laureate writers and art plunderers, time has a way of exposing more layers of the onion.\n\nIntroduction\n\nT\n\nhe evening was planned as a form of theater, a series of carefully staged scenes. Each room, or set, in the extraordinary eighteenth-­century Parisian hôtel particulier featured a theme or a moment in art history. One was the French rococo of the eighteenth century with, in the words of one of the guests, “the most beautiful Fragonards and Bouchers you have ever seen situated among Louis XVI furniture.”1 After champagne and hors d’oeuvres in the first salon, the diners moved on to the next course among the Impressionists— Monets, Degas, and Renoirs surrounding them. White-­gloved waiters served exquisite food, lifting gleaming silver plate covers in unison to reveal the gourmet repast. After the main course, the guests enjoyed dessert and drinks among the moderns—Matisse, Picasso, and Modigliani. It was a show, a lesson in art history, a display of power, and an exercise in trust, all at the same time. Very few were permitted into the Wildensteins’ inner sanctum on the rue La Boétie (pronounced in the Parisian argot “La Bo-­ ay-­see”). Back in the 1950s, crowds flocked to the Wildenstein showrooms a short distance away in the rue du Faubourg Saint Honoré for exhibitions on the art of Monet, Gauguin, and many others whose work they acquired and sold. As purveyors of very expensive works to elite collectors, the Wildensteins were part of the cultural life of both Paris and New York. In France, they often have been referred to simply as “Les W.”2 Monsieur Daniel, the patriarch of the world’s greatest art-­dealing dynasty from the death of his father in 1963 until his own passing in 2001, had carried on a family tradition of exclusivity, even as he formally shifted the business 12\n\nIntroduction13\n\ncenter of Wildenstein, Inc. to New York. Their clients included J. Paul Getty, Nelson Rockefeller, Gianni Agnelli, and Walter Annenberg, but also many of the world’s greatest museums, beginning with the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Yet it was the Wildensteins themselves who decided to whom they would show something, and when they would sell it. They were known to hoard treasures for decades, even for generations, locking away works in their repositories dispersed around the globe. In 1978, they reportedly had ten thousand paintings in their possession, with the New York storeroom (also referred to as “The Vault”) alone holding twenty-­five Courbets, ten van Goghs, and twenty Renoirs, among many other works.3 The two guests on this evening in the mid-­1980s would have warranted additional discretion. They were German colleagues, art dealers from Munich. But one in particular represented a threat to the reputation of the Wildensteins, who were of Alsatian Jewish origins. Dr. Bruno Lohse had been Hermann Göring’s art agent in Paris during World War II. Göring stood as the second most powerful figure in the Nazi leadership during the early years of the war, and this helped make Lohse among the most prominent individuals in the French branch of the ERR, which ravaged the collections of French Jews. The ERR itself was a sizeable multinational organization, with branches in Belgium and the Netherlands and even more ambitious operations in the east (with a key office in Riga).4 Lohse had helped Göring commandeer over seven hundred pictures from the ERR in Paris, with the then number two man in Nazi Germany never parting with a Pfennig. The young Nazi dealer organized for his powerful patron eighteen of the twenty exhibitions in the elegant Jeu de Paume museum on the Place de la Concorde—shopping sprees, if you will (without the necessity for payment). Göring sauntered among the looted works (or had them presented to him while seated), selecting those he fancied. These exercises in power proved so rife with meaning that even George Clooney and associates used the scene to open the 2014 film Monuments Men: the Cate Blanchett character, who calls to mind French curator and Resistance member Rose Valland, spits in the champagne glasses of the Göring and Lohse characters before serving them their drinks. In real life, Bruno Lohse, due to a long-­standing stomach ailment, drank very little alcohol. During the war, Bruno Lohse felt himself to be the king of Paris. Armed with a pass offering the sweeping support of Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring, he could travel without limitations and buy what he wanted. Nights out at Maxim’s or Schéhérazade (a cabaret very much en\n\n14\n\nIntroduction\n\nvogue during the occupation), silk stockings for his French girlfriends— such was his life until August 1944. One French intelligence report from 1945 stated that Lohse “was without scruples: he had numerous personal affairs in Paris and made a lot of money.”5 He enjoyed considerable independence. As his ERR colleague Walter Borchers testified after the war, “It was known that Dr. Lohse was the special representative of Göring in this taskforce and therefore, in a certain sense, he was feared—not because of his comportment, but because of his direct connection to Göring.”6 Granted, Lohse had a demanding boss, one who competed with Hitler and the other Nazi leaders for Europe’s artistic treasures. The young art dealer, who was a member of the SS (the Schutzstaffel, or Protection Service), also had to answer to Heinrich Himmler, not to mention Alfred Rosenberg and his henchmen, who formally controlled the ERR. Lohse often found himself uncomfortably close to Jewish victims. There was no escaping the fact that he was helping steal their property and that many he plundered faced horrible fates in the east. After the war, some of the ERR staffers attempted to rationalize their behavior, such as Staff Chief Gerhard Utikal, who claimed, “We never felt ourselves to be robbers. We were of the opinion that the art action was carried out according to the law.”7 That said, the linkage between plundering—especially taking a people’s cultural property—and genocide was evident to Lohse and many contemporaries during the war, even if they did not know all the details of what was transpiring.8 When asked in 1947 whether he had participated in the M-­Aktion (short for Möbel-­Aktion, or “Furniture Action”) that deprived French Jews of their household property, Lohse responded, “Thank God, no! That was a matter for the Ministry of the East, with which the ERR had nothing to do.”9 His vehement denial intimated that he understood the implications of the theft: the processing of victims’ property after they had been deported to the murderous east. In many ways, the plundering of property epitomized the objectives embodied in the Nazis’ “Final Solution”: what Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel has described as “a combination of both perverse, hate-­filled idealism and convenient, cheap robbery.”10 In 1943, Lohse allegedly boasted to a German army officer named Ehrengard von Portatius that he had beaten Jewish victims to death “with his own hands.”11 At six feet four and over two hundred pounds during the war, this was well possible for the former SS sports teacher, but the postwar report, which von Portatius penned in 1951, remains unverified—both as to what Lohse allegedly said and also its veracity. The aristocrat said he had been “astonished” when he received the report that Lohse had been\n\nIntroduction15\n\nacquitted by the Permanent Military Tribunal of Paris in 1950, and this prompted him to recall the 1943 conversation as well as a subsequent visit home to his parents in Berlin late in the war. When von Portatius told his parents about Lohse, they responded, “He will be the first to hang after our defeat.”12 Portatius acknowledged that this had not happened—that “unfortunately, the big criminals have got back on their feet while the minor members of the Party, for example, and the poor prisoners of war suffer.”13 The handwritten complaint that Ehrengard von Portatius sent to French Monuments officer Rose Valland in 1951 was viewed as sufficiently serious that a transcription was typed out, but there was no will to attempt to reopen the case against Lohse. Although authorities took up an investigation into another murder charge near the end of Lohse’s life, there would be no judicial determination about whether he had killed people during the war. Undisputed, however, is the fact that Lohse helped steal a remarkable number of artworks. French curator turned Monuments officer Rose Valland told her U.S. counterpart Captain James Rorimer shortly after the liberation of Paris in August 1944, “The Germans had taken one third of the privately owned art in France.”14 The ERR in France alone had plundered about 30,000 objects: there were 21,903 counted in the main depot in Germany, the Neuschwanstein castle (of which 10,890 were paintings), but there were five other ERR repositories in the Reich—including the Kloster Buxheim monastery near Memmingen in Bavaria and Schloss Nikolsburg in Moravia (now Czech Republic)—containing an additional 10,000 objects.15 These works came from several hundred different Jewish collections. The plundering agency stole a wide range of art: from Old Masters like Jan Vermeer’s The Astronomer (owned by Édouard de Rothschild) to more quotidian pieces—the art that decorated the homes of the middle classes, for example. As an operative associated with the ERR headquartered in Paris’s Musée du Jeu de Paume and the effective co-­ director of the Paris branch of the agency for a year during the war, Lohse ranks in the top five among history’s all-­time art looters. Trying to satisfy the near-­insatiable demand of Göring could not but help push him to greater lengths as a plunderer and dealer. Göring had remarkable power until the final phase of the war. The Reichsmarschall, who had been given this invented title after the victory over France in the summer of 1940, was also chief of the Luftwaffe, minister president of Prussia, and head of the Four-­Year Plan Office (a major force in the German economy). Göring’s power stretched across both the civilian and military\n\n16\n\nIntroduction\n\nsectors, and it transcended international borders as well. The Reichsmarschall deployed agents to plunder in both western and eastern Europe, but no city could match Paris when it came to the quantity and quality of art. All told, Göring amassed an art collection of over seventeen hundred pictures (although he sold works too and his collection fluctuated).16 While Hitler and his agents acquired more works for the monumental Führermuseum planned for Linz (around eight thousand pictures), Göring had the largest collection of any Nazi subleader, and he boasted after his capture in 1945 that it was the finest art collection in private hands in Europe (a more dubious claim).17 Some of the collection went missing at war’s end, with pieces bubbling up on the art market from time to time (more on that to come).18 Göring’s art bloodhound in Paris, “Dr. Lohse,” had his full support— both politically and financially—which made him unantastbar (untouchable). The written order from Göring that he possessed, a document dated 21 April 1941 that instructed all offices of the state, Party, and armed forces to support his work, rarely left his body. Lohse kept the folded sheet with the Reichsmarschall’s signature in the breast pocket of his suit, and over sixty years later, at the time of his death, the faded and torn authorization remained among his papers.19 American Monuments officer James Plaut observed that “Lohse provoked the resentment and jealousy of his fellow-­ workers through the enjoyment of special privileges in the execution of his mission for Goering.”20 With his car and driver, his elegant civilian clothes, and a healthy expense account—in addition to other advantages he gained from Göring’s patronage—his colleagues viewed him as undeservedly fortunate. Lohse repaid Göring’s support by sending a steady stream of artworks to his patron. Göring acquired at least 386 pictures in France (although not all came via Lohse).21 These were purchased from the scores of French dealers who sought to collaborate with the wealthy Germans. The art market flourished in wartime Paris, and Lohse was a frequent attendee at the auctions of the primary auction venue in the French capital, the Hôtel Drouot.22 Additionally, Lohse helped Göring obtain most of the 700-plus works taken from ERR stock during the Jeu de Paume selections. Göring had removed these works from the ERR headquarters right after his selections, then placed them on one of his private trains and transported to his Carinhall estate outside Berlin. James Plaut stated unequivocally, “Goering did not pay the Einsatzstab—or any other organization or individual—for the works he acquired in this manner” (that is,\n\nIntroduction17\n\nselections from the exhibitions that Lohse organized on most occasions).23 Lohse, however, bought art for Göring from a range of sources. Some came from collaborators, paid for with devalued francs, which traded against the Reichsmark at twenty to one (compared to thirteen to one before the war). Others sellers came from Belgium and the Netherlands. The database of the German Historical Museum that documents Göring’s collection lists seventy-­seven such works brokered by Lohse during the war, but there were almost certainly many more.24 It is also striking that among the seventy-­seven entries in the database, the current location of fifteen works, including pictures by Jan Brueghel and Jan van Goyen, remains unknown.25 In other words, nearly 20 percent of the works in Göring’s collection linked to Lohse have gone missing, and these are only the documented losses: as noted above, it is unlikely that the database has recorded every work that Lohse helped the Reichsmarschall acquire. Bruno Lohse took refuge after the war in the mantra that “he was just doing his job”—a variation of “just following orders.” This is what he claimed he told Monsieur Georges Wildenstein in 1951 when he returned to Paris. Monsieur Georges (1892–1963), the son of Nathan (1852–1934) and the father of Daniel (1917–2001), headed the family firm during the war. Monsieur Georges had fled Paris in May 1940 and headed south to Vichy, the unoccupied zone. He then made his way to New York in 1941. Rumors circulated then and later that he had, via proxies, continued unimpeded in the art trade in Nazi-­occupied Europe. His agents included his business manager Roger Dequoy, who during the war continued to occupy the Wildenstein & Cie premises in Paris on the rue La Boétie (he remained in the Wildensteins’ employ after 1945). But the Wildensteins were also victims of Nazi depredations, losing scores of pictures to Lohse and his accomplices ( Jim Plaut of the ALIU reported that 302 pictures belonging to Georges Wildenstein were stolen by the Nazis).26 A stockpile of theirs in the Paris branch of the Banque de France was an early target of the ERR, and other works of theirs were taken from the Château de Sourches in the Loire Valley, as well as from the Château de Moyres near Angers.27 Nazi art dealer Karl Haberstock told American investigators after the war that in November 1940 “the most important part of the Wildenstein collection had been loaded on a boat sailing for [the] USA, that the boat had been intercepted by a German submarine and forced back into the Bordeaux harbor, where its cargo had been unloaded and the collection seized by German authorities.”28 One OSS document titled “Pictures from the Wildenstein Collection Acquired from the Einsatzstab\n\n18\n\nIntroduction\n\nRosenberg by Marshal Goering” lists fourteen works, including paintings by Boucher, Fragonard, and van Goyen.29 And Göring was kept apprised of the “Aryanization” of the Wildensteins’ property, including their art collection, as the process played out in May 1941: Major General Friedrich Carl Hanesse (1892–1975), then the air force commandant of Paris, assured his chief that he would have first choice of all the Wildensteins’ artworks—after Hitler.30 Lohse recounted in later years how he received orders to seize their famed archive, which included photographs and annotated cards ( fiches) that documented the history of thousands of artworks and proved a kind of secret weapon vis-­à-­v is their competition.31 The Wildensteins knew the locations of many of these artworks, and this information would have been of inestimable value to the Nazis as they searched for Jewish-­owned collections. Lohse also claimed after the war that he had been ordered to destroy this archive, although this claim merits skepticism (if only for the strategic value just noted). The Nazis tended to be practical when it came to cultural property from western Europe (it was different in the east, where outright destruction occurred more frequently). A more credible part of Lohse’s account was that he turned to Göring and asked permission to secure and preserve the Wildenstein archive. According to a longtime friend of Lohse’s, the young art historian hatched a plot to declare the archive “without value”—and he drafted a document stating this that Göring signed—and this enabled the archive to remain on the premises of the rue La Boétie headquarters throughout the war.32 A secretary to the Wildensteins then smuggled out many files and took them to her apartment for safekeeping. While this rendition relies on Lohse, the point is that the gallery archives evaded seizure by the Nazis and that Lohse received credit for the documents’ survival. Many questions remain regarding this account. Where is this document declaring the archive unimportant? (It did not appear in any ERR files or among postwar documents, including his trials.) Why is there also a document showing Lohse trying to purchase the archive (but not doing so) in late 1943?33 How does this fit in with his narrative? Did Lohse himself have access to information in the archive as he helped the ERR undertake raids in France? Why would Lohse have helped the Wildensteins in the first place? The latter is perhaps the easiest to answer, with power and profit emerging as motivating factors in Lohse’s life. Despite the questions, Lohse had a clear recollection of details regarding the archives. He related that when he first arrived on the premises on\n\nIntroduction19\n\nthe rue La Boétie during the war, he saw the binders that “reflected close to a hundred years of work in the art business.”34 He pulled out one binder on eighteenth-­century Venetian painter Francesco Guardi and recalled being astonished by the wealth of information. And this was just one of the binders on Guardi. He explained—in this account given some fifty-­ five years later—that there were seven other binders for the artist. Lohse nonetheless claimed he made the report to Göring about the materials, stating that the archive had little value.35 Somehow Lohse helped to prevent the transfer of the archive to Germany. As noted by Yves Stavridès, an author who has written about the Wildenstein dynasty, “The marvelous library—books + archives—was sold by the administrator appointed by Vichy. But it never went to Germany. The whole stuff remained [at the] rue La Boétie. The library was saved by the D-­Day [forces] after the Liberation of Paris!”36 Regardless of the murky history of the archive during the war, it survived and was among the property that Monsieur Georges recovered in 1945. According to Lohse, the Wildenstein patriarch had called him to the family’s home in 1951 to thank him for this service. Lohse had been released recently from a French prison—a verdict of “not guilty” came down on 3 August 1950 after a three-­day trial. But his sixty-­three months in Allied prisons, including nearly three years in the Cherche-­Midi lockup on the Left Bank, had been hard. He was malnourished, and the fact that he had been incarcerated longer than any of his art-­looting cohort made him bitter. After stopping in Baden-­Württemberg to register with the authorities (it had been the French Zone and the French still had officials there to whom he initially reported), Lohse headed to Munich. He intended to return to art dealing in some manner, although it’s not clear he had a plan as to how to do this. Between 1945 and 1950, the art market in Germany had been in a deep freeze (save the beginning of the flow of works to the uniquely rich United States). While imprisoned, Lohse had not missed much in the art trade. But the landscape looked brighter in 1950 and dealers began to contemplate moves in accordance with the new realities: that the art market was poised to take off precipitously and that the pro-­business government of Chancellor Konrad Adenauer would not only encourage commerce but turn a blind eye to former Nazis, who often received their pensions and also sometimes held posts in the state administration.37 Lohse therefore plotted the revival of his career, and this included utilizing the contacts he had made in France during the war to find his new niche. Within weeks of his release, he reestablished his re-\n\n20\n\nIntroduction\n\nlationship with Victor Mandl (1890–­?) (sometimes rendered as Mandel-­ Markowsky), a collaborationist dealer who had been active in Berlin before the war and also had a gallery on the rue La Boétie, just down the street from the Wildensteins.38 Lohse recalled later in his life details from the 1951 visit to Paris to see Georges Wildenstein—acknowledging that the story may have been a fabrication (there is no documentary evidence to support it and it has never been confirmed by a member of the Wildenstein family).39 Lohse nonetheless offered a wealth of detail, recalling that he stayed in the hotel that once had been favored by Luftwaffe officers, and that he had met the Luftwaffe chief for Paris, General Friedrich Carl Hanesse, there on many occasions during the war. As he told the story, Lohse recounted that he was in his room when he received a message: Monsieur Georges wanted to speak with him. Lohse made his way to the Wildensteins’ hôtel particulier on the elegant Right Bank, and was led to a vast but empty second-­story room that featured three easels, each of which held a painting. They were Dutch Old Masters, the genre most admired by Lohse. The three works were all exquisite in their own ways, Lohse recounted. After leaving Lohse alone with the paintings for a few minutes, Monsieur Georges appeared with his aides and took a seat in the corner. According to Lohse, Monsieur Georges stated in a very measured, formal manner that the doctor had rendered a great service to the house of Wildenstein by saving their archive during the war. For this he would like to thank him and reward him. He instructed Lohse to select a work from those before him. Lohse recounted some fifty years later that he was surprised, even shocked, but that he quickly regained his composure. He replied, “Thank you, Monsieur Georges, but I was only doing my duty. I cannot accept your generous offer.” According to Lohse, Monsieur Georges initially insisted but ultimately relented. Yet he concluded the meeting by informing Lohse that he could always consider himself a friend of the house of Wildenstein.40 As Lohse told the story, recalling the words of Monsieur Georges, he alternated back and forth between French and German, the former spoken in a clear, grammatically correct manner, albeit with a pronounced German accent. In fact, the rendition of the story in French may have been yet another deception; at least when Lohse met with Georges’s son Daniel, the two spoke German with one another (and with the others in the room). As one person present at some of the meetings recalls, the Wildensteins hailed from Alsace-­Lorraine and, taking pride in the Germanophone tradition, they all spoke excellent German.41\n\nIntroduction21\n\nLohse’s self-­serving account about his episode with Monsieur Georges concealed the fact that he still possessed looted art, including one of the last pictures ever produced by Camille Pissarro (who counted among the few Jewish French Impressionists). A rendering of the Seine River, painted in a room where Pissarro would die just weeks later in 1903, the picture had belonged to the Fischer family—the famed publishers who had started in Frankfurt but moved on to Vienna in the mid-­1930s. The Pissarro had been ripped from their walls in Vienna after the Anschluss in 1938, and after being auctioned off in Berlin during the war, it disappeared. Yet between 1957 and Lohse’s death in 2007, it had been a part of his collection. The Pissarro was among some 47 pictures found in his possession (or known to have been in his possession recently) when Lohse’s estate was examined by authorities in 2007. His vault in Zurich—“Safe Number 5”—included works by Monet, Renoir, Sisley, Corot, and Wouwerman.42 While this cache did not come close to that of Cornelius Gurlitt—the 1,258 works found in Munich and 239 pictures in Salzburg in 2012 represented a different magnitude—Lohse’s collection warranted a valuation in the millions of dollars.43 Just the fact that Lohse rented out a large, walk-­in bank vault in the Zurich Cantonal Bank (Zürcher Kantonalbank) says something about his postwar enterprise. If Lohse could afford the not inconsiderable cost of a vault of this size (with annual fees in the thousands of dollars), and if he needed such a safe, then presumably he was dealing with a significant number of artworks. Walter Feilchenfeldt, the president of the Swiss Art Trade Association from 1997 to 2007, quipped in an interview that he would not have been surprised if Franc Marc’s Tower of the Blue Horses had been in Lohse’s vault, referring to a lost Expressionist masterpiece that counts among the most sought-­after works that disappeared during the Third Reich.44 While Feilchenfeldt was being provocative, he was more serious in inferring that many in the art trade suspected that Lohse harbored looted art. News of Lohse’s safe broke shortly after his death in 2007 and generated headlines around the world.45 The safe seemed to confirm the suspicions of Feilchenfeldt and other art world insiders. Yet the discovery seemed to raise more questions than it answered—starting with: How did this art plunderer amass such a collection? This is among the many questions explored in Göring’s Man in Paris. Others include: What do his experiences during the war tell us about the nexus of culture and barbarism? How should we understand the postwar networks that took hold, and how does Lohse’s story help us learn more\n\n22\n\nIntroduction\n\nabout the fate of Nazi-­looted art? Why was he recounting stories about both meeting Georges Wildenstein in the 1950s and 1960s and enjoying dinners with Daniel Wildenstein in the 1980s and 1990s?46 How did I get to know Lohse, and what kind of opportunities and dangers did these meetings pose? And finally, a word on the structure and concept of the book: I offer first-­person accounts of meeting Lohse and other old Nazis in the prologue and epilogue, but otherwise do not appear in the narrative until chapter 6, which begins 1998 when I first met Bruno Lohse. From that point in the story, there are moments where I relate personal experiences and observations that shed light on Lohse and his world.\n\nC HA P TER O NE\n\nArt Historian, Art Dealer, Member of the SS (1911–41)\n\nI\n\nf one were to venture a single adjective to describe Lohse, it might be elusive. He did not want people to know him as a person—at least, not all sides of him—and he worked hard to keep his professional life a mystery. When I asked him in the late 1990s if he went through denazification after his return to Germany in 1950, he replied no. He claimed that after five years in a French prison and a trial before a French Military Tribunal, he could not face another judge. His refusal to go through denazification, he said, prevented him from regaining his license as an art dealer. He therefore refashioned his place in the art world as an “art adviser” (or Kunstberater, as he would call himself ). He worked in the private sphere, a murky figure with confidential clients and contacts: as a broker, ein Vermittler. Yet a visit to the State Archives in Munich turned up his denazification file and revealed a different story. Lohse had lied to me—and it would not be the only time. Granted, the German judicial review in 1950 was perfunctory. The public prosecutor in Munich ruled within weeks of Lohse’s release from a French prison that because he was not suspected of being in the first two categories of complicity (a “major criminal” or a “heavily burdened” figure) within the five-­category scale, there was no need for a formal trial.1 The prosecutor even ordered the state to cover the costs of the cursory process. Lohse, therefore, was formally “denazified.” That he misrepresented his experiences, or told them only in a partial and 23\n\n24\n\nArt Historian, Art Dealer, SS Member\n\nmisleading way, proved typical. Indeed, piecing together the basics of his life required navigating the smoke and mirrors that he employed. I am not certain why Lohse lied to me about his denazification trial: perhaps he feared it would lead me to a paper trail. Perhaps this narrative could explain any self-­perceived career failures—it was easier to say he had been banned from certain opportunities rather than admit that he just didn’t achieve them. This also may have been his way of explaining how his wartime notoriety forced him into the shadows after 1950. Bruno Lohse was complicated, as even he seemed to realize. Wilhelm Peter Bruno Lohse was born on 17 September 1911 in Düingdorf bei Melle, a twenty-­house village in Lower Saxony—which, contrary to the sound of its name, is in northwestern Germany not far from the Dutch border and the Teutoburg Forest. The family did not remain there long, soon moving to Berlin, a rapidly growing metropolis with better job opportunities. Bruno’s father, August Lohse, was a musician who had the good fortune to land a job as a percussionist with the Berlin Philharmonic, a position he held for some forty years. The Lohses were an upper-­ middle-­class family. Bruno had an elder brother, Siegfried (1909–42), who went missing in combat on the eastern front during World War II, and a sister, Brünhilde (1914–2014). The names suggest a connection to the world of music and opera—specifically to Richard Wagner. The family of five resided in a comfortable apartment on the Humboldtstrasse in Steglitz, a leafy neighborhood in the southwest section of the capital, halfway between the city center and the green suburbs spreading out toward Lake Wannsee.2 Many of the buildings on their street were elegant Jugendstil structures, with elaborate stained-­glass windows and finely crafted stucco work that reflected a prosperous bourgeoisie during the fin de siècle period. The genteel suburb, which was incorporated into Greater Berlin only in 1920, developed around the vibrant retail shops on the Schloss Strasse. Those who knew the Lohses described them as wohlhabende (prosperous). They were members of the Bildungsbürgertum—the educated bourgeoisie—and as such, were connected to a wide range of artists, writers, publishers, art dealers and, of course, musicians. One family friend recounted that in the 1930s “during evenings in the Lohse house, to which I was often invited, political subjects and the like were never discussed. The conversation always concerned literary or musical topics, as well as the area of the beautiful arts.” This family friend, who became an SS officer, also reported that Lohse’s father was “a known art collector.”3 Bruno Lohse later recalled that his father had been friends with the legendary Berlin mu-\n\nArt Historian, Art Dealer, SS Member\n\n25\n\nseum director Wilhelm von Bode (namesake for the Bode Museum), and that the two men would often examine pictures together.4 Another family friend said that Bruno received Dutch pictures from his father, so they were sufficiently well off to collect on a minor scale.5 But all was not idyllic in the Lohse household. We do not know the details of the family dynamic; only refractions of problems are apparent. For example, later in life, after Bruno had married in 1958, his wife Ilse, who loved music, frequented the philharmonic and the opera. Bruno, his friends reported, disliked music and would not accompany her to concerts. She would therefore go with other friends, and this would anger him further. How could a son of a musician who played for the Berlin Philharmonic, let alone a member of the Bildungsbürgertum, dislike music? The most likely explanation is that it stemmed from his feelings toward his father. Of course, his disinterest in music might be construed as a sign of his often dour character, but such conclusions are precarious. We know little about the inner dynamics of the Lohse household, except that his father, August, was demonstrably anti-­Nazi, and this probably proved a source of conflict. Bruno’s older brother Siegfried also became a Nazi, joining the Party on 1 April 1933 (six months before Bruno joined the SS).6 Bruno was devoted to his mother, Anna Catherine Hönekop Lohse. However, she died in 1938.7 Lohse’s father remarried, and Bruno did not like his stepmother.8 Despite these tensions, both Bruno and Siegfried sustained a relationship with their father. The boys shared a fairly sizeable house three hundred yards down the street from the family home in Steglitz starting in the mid-­1930s. Lohse obtained formal approval in November 1936 to turn the house at Humboldtstrasse 27 into a “Sales Venue for Old and Contemporary Masters” (Verkaufsstelle für Gemälde alter und zeitgenossischer Meister).9 Lohse thus began his career as an art dealer just down the street from his family home, which continued to serve as a base for him. After the war, Rose Valland found documents and other property that Bruno had entrusted to his father to be stashed in the family home. Lohse graduated from Gymnasium with an Abitur in 1930 and went on to the Friedrich Wilhelm University (later renamed Humboldt University) in Berlin to pursue his studies in art history, philosophy, and Germanic culture. At the same time, he qualified as a sports teacher, passing a state exam in 1932. Tall and athletic, Lohse developed into a seriously competitive handball player (a Continental sport that mixes elements of basketball and soccer). He and his SS teammates won the national championship in early 1935. He also recorded in his SS file that he was the “victor in the pen-\n\n26\n\nArt Historian, Art Dealer, SS Member\n\ntathlon and the javelin” and that he had won the Storm Troopers’ Sport Award in Gold, among other honors (an SS man winning an SA award, no less).10 These were especially impressive feats considering that Lohse was simultaneously working on his PhD in art history in Berlin. In early 1935, he managed to arrange for a four-­month stay in France, where he worked on his dissertation and polished his French. When Lohse returned to Germany, he matriculated at the University of Frankfurt, where he continued his doctoral work with Professor Albert Erich (A. E.) Brinckmann (1881–1958). A wide-­ranging and astonishingly prolific art historian whose many books stretched from the medieval period to baroque sculpture to eighteenth-­century architecture, Brinckmann moved from Berlin to the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University in Frankfurt to take up a chair in art history, and he brought some of his students with him.11 Those close to Lohse later revealed how Brinckmann was actually forced out of Berlin. He had ignored his teaching responsibilities and engaged in romantic relationships with many of his female students, with whom he would embark on “study trips.” Even in those days, when a powerful Doktorvater could take liberties that today would be regarded as actionable, Brinckmann reportedly went too far. He later portrayed his forced move from Berlin to Frankfurt as politically motivated, noting that he was replaced by the “most prominent Nazi professor” Wilhelm Pinder (1878–1947), a renowned art historian who moved to the Reich capital from Munich.12 Pinder would be a towering figure among art historians in the Third Reich. Brinckmann noted that Pinder worked with Berlin authorities to create “a nationalistic and Nazi art history for Germany.”13 Pinder also supervised the theses of a number of figures mentioned in this book, including Erhard Göpel (an art agent for Hitler and close friend of painter Max Beckmann), Bernhard Degenhart (who went on to a successful career in the museum world in Bavaria), and Benno Griebert (an art dealer and the father of Peter Griebert).14 Lohse was reportedly the only male doctoral student to move with Brinckmann to Frankfurt. Having written a dissertation on Jakob Philipp Hackert (1737–1807), a German painter known for landscapes in a classical style, Lohse completed his studies in February 1936. The young PhD developed an extensive knowledge of Dutch Old Masters, and this would prove particularly useful later in his career. As is required in Germany, his doctoral thesis on Hackert was published as a book and appeared in 1936 from the Lechte-­Verlag in Emsdetten.15 At 170 pages, the dissertation was competent but not definitive, although it is still cited today among art histo-\n\nArt Historian, Art Dealer, SS Member\n\n27\n\nrians, art dealers, and those studying the Brandenburg artist. Lohse had traveled to Riga, where he found a box of Hackert’s letters in the State Library of Latvia (Hackert had a number of German-­Latvian patrons). This discovery constituted a genuine scholarly contribution. The dissertation was also not an ideological tract, even though his Doktorvater, Professor Brinckmann, was a Nazi (and one of three art historians who were full professors to be dismissed after the war).16 Lohse did not engage Nazi “blood and soil” or racial themes, and his analysis did not evince a pronounced nationalism. As opportunistic as he often appeared, Lohse did not use his thesis to curry favor with the Nazi authorities. Later, in his testimony given to the ALIU officers, he boasted about having studied with anti-­Nazi professors (mentioning three by name).17 The published dissertation is also interesting because Lohse thanked Dr. Hermann Voss (1884– 1969) from the Nassauisches Landesmuseum in Wiesbaden. Voss went on to become the director of the Führermuseum in 1943 (no doubt a useful contact for Lohse later).18 Lohse’s was a solid monograph on an understudied artist. His work, however, was not sufficiently distinguished so as to place him on a track for a professorship or an academic career. When Lohse died in 2007, he left one of his friends a copy of the Hackert dissertation bound in gold leaf—a Prachtband (ornamental volume)—­suggesting that Lohse, like many Germans, viewed the doctorate as means to become salonfähig (socially acceptable).19 His doctor title was also central to his self-­presentation as a Kulturmensch—a man of culture—and this conceit helped him rationalize his behavior throughout his life. The twenty-­five-­year-­old “doctor” returned to his parents’ home in Berlin in 1936 and contemplated his next move. Lohse spent about nine months thinking about a career in the art world, and to this end, he acquired books, prints, and other art historical materials pertaining to Dutch art. As he later termed it, he amassed a “material collection” (Materialsammlung). His father, for all his apparent shortcomings in Bruno’s eyes, put an “atelier” in the family home at his disposal. August Lohse also provided capital to buy stock as his son began to organize art exhibitions in the Steglitz house.20 Many of the works in these exhibitions were for sale, and the young dealer had sufficient success to finance buying trips to Holland in the later 1930s. Dutch art historian Adriaan Venema documented Lohse acquiring artworks in Amsterdam in the prewar period.21 Lohse also joined the compulsory state organizations for art dealers—most notably, the Reich Chamber for the Visual Arts. While the young art historian turned dealer scarcely counted as a player in the international art trade,\n\n28\n\nArt Historian, Art Dealer, SS Member\n\nhe was able to make a living. And he enjoyed the lifestyle—the travel, the social life, the freedom. As Walter Feilchenfeldt noted about being an art dealer, “There are no opening or closing hours. . . . The only fixed rule one can count on is that—in all probability—no work of art was ever sold before 10 o’clock in the morning. Therefore most art dealers tend to rise on the late side.”22 We can manage only glimpses of Lohse’s prewar business activities, but they show the early stages of a promising career as an art dealer. In March 1938, he sold Sleeping Amor by Friedrich Georg Weitsch, a German court painter and engraver from the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, to the well-­established Berlin dealer Karl Haberstock for Reichsmarks (RM) 1,400.23 Haberstock had emerged after 1936 as arguably the leading purveyor of art to Hitler, Göring, Goebbels, and other Nazi elite, and this transaction suggests that Lohse was making inroads with important connections. Where he obtained the picture, or whether it came from a Jewish owner selling under duress, remains unknown. In May 1938, some two months after acquiring it, Haberstock sold Weitsch’s painting to Goebbels’s Reich Propaganda Ministry, along with three other pictures (including a Bismarck portrait by Franz von Lenbach) for RM 42,500.24 The extant records do not disaggregate the latter sale in a way that reveals Haberstock’s profit, but he likely did very well. After the war, Lohse reported that he himself earned about RM 3,000 per year from 1937 to 1939 (this when the average annual salary was RM 2,500).25 With only modest housing costs that came from sharing a house with his brother Siegfried in Berlin-­Steglitz, Lohse managed to maintain appearances. The extant documents reveal that Lohse displayed considerable initiative in his new profession—for example, inquiring with Joseph Goebbels’s Reich Propaganda Ministry in June 1938 whether he could buy or trade for “degenerate” artworks removed from state museums.26 This undertaking came straight on the heels of Hitler’s proclamation of 31 May 1938 giving the Nazi state the right to sell off purged art, nominally legalizing the process for all involved. That Lohse attempted to sell the purged art suggests his opportunism: he actually liked German Expressionism and many genres of modern art. In this way he was like Karl Haberstock, who had trained as a young man with Paul Cassirer, the legendary dealer who promoted and sold Impressionist art. Haberstock sold works by Impressionists and Postimpressionists over the course of his career (Pissarro, van Gogh, Liebermann, and Corinth, among others), even though he helped to defame modern art in the latter half of the 1930s.27 Lohse’s cynical\n\nArt Historian, Art Dealer, SS Member\n\n29\n\noverture proved unsuccessful, however, as Goebbels’s employees turned to more established dealers with international connections: most notably Ferdinand Möller, Hildebrand Gurlitt, Bernhard Böhmer, and Karl Buchholz. The four dealers took the lead in selling off the twenty-­one thousand “degenerate” works removed from German museums, although a few others eventually got in on the action—including Hildebrand Gurlitt’s cousin Wolfgang Gurlitt (1888–1965).28 But as the 1930s drew to a close, Lohse continued to hover on the periphery of the Berlin art trade, still striving to forge links to the power brokers at the center. As part of his studies at university after 1933, Lohse had been required to endure a program in “political indoctrination.”29 He claimed after the war that “in order to avoid the implications of such indoctrination . . . I volunteered to teach sports in the General SS [Allgemeine SS].” He taught sport after he joined the SS on 5 November 1933, a position he held until 1938, when ill health prevented him from discharging his duties. His assertion to postwar authorities that he was apolitical appears to have been overblown or part of a self-­exculpatory defense. He joined the Nazi Party in 1937 and remained a member of the SS until 1945.30 He was promoted within the SS on a regular basis after he formally took the oath on 29 August 1934. The promotions continued through the war, with Himmler personally approving certain advances in rank (the Reichsführer-­SS was at his field headquarters when he signed a 30 April 1942 appointment of Lohse as an Untersturmführer, or second lieutenant).31 His last promotion came in April 1944, when Himmler elevated him to the rank of first lieutenant (Obersturmführer).32 While the rank was not extraordinarily lofty, the final elevation proves that he remained in good standing within the SS. And the fact that Himmler had him transferred from the General SS to his Personal Staff of the Reichsführer-­SS in 1942 indicates that the Reichsführer-­ SS took a particular interest in Göring’s man in Paris.33 In August 1942, an SS-­lieutenant in Berlin by the name of Hans Leimer penned a report in which he called “SS-­Ustuf. Dr. Lohse” the “representative of the Reichsführer-­SS for art purchases,” a designation effectively confirming that Lohse delivered works to Himmler as well.34 The report discussed one particularly impressive collection that Leimer valued at 30 to 50 million French francs. Leimer also noted that a 10 percent commission would be paid, and invoked the names of a series of German Gestapo agents in Paris, including the notorious Paris chief Helmut Knochen. Hans Leimer also detailed the use of French informants to the Gestapo, emphasizing the role played by a particularly effective and re-\n\n30\n\nArt Historian, Art Dealer, SS Member\n\nliable collaborator named Henry Rigeaux who, along with his “people,” could help transport pictures over the Spanish border. The document made it appear that Lohse was siphoning off works from the seized Jewish works—Leimer is very clear that the art in question came from a Jewish collection (“an important collection of paintings from Jewish possession” was his phrasing)—and that the SS agents were using French informants (Vertrauensmänner: literally, “trusted men”) to surreptitiously transport the works out of France.35 For his efforts, Rigeaux wanted German citizenship. Whether the works would remain in fascist Spain or then be transported to Himmler in Germany cannot be discerned from the report. Because the works were located in the unoccupied zone in the south, and in light of the timing, SS-­Lieutenant Leimer was likely discussing the famed Schloss collection, which Lohse helped plunder and liquidate. The Schloss collection went to Paris (and is discussed in more detail later), but the plans Leimer related are significant in their own right. Leimer characterized Lohse as an SS asset who continued on as a trusted member in good standing in the SS well into the war (August 1942). Lohse always had an explanation for awkward facts pertaining to his political activities. For example, he maintained that he was automatically made a Nazi Party member in 1937 because he had been in the SS, and that he was promoted within the SS because of his “art activities.” He also claimed that although he was asked to wear the SS uniform, he had never done so.36 A photograph from the period, however, shows that on at least one occasion he wore garments with SS insignia. He had a French-­Polish paramour, Jacqueline Seratzki, who reportedly loved to see him in the notorious black ensemble of Himmler’s elite.37 One encounter was documented in a photograph that Lohse retained among his papers. Wearing a sweater with the large SS symbols clearly visible (indeed, at the center of the photograph), Lohse is on a bed, his right arm nestling the heads of two women; a male comrade in uniform is on the other side, talking on the telephone. They were evidently “playacting” in setting this scene, captured by an unnamed photographer. The shot was clearly posed to document their carousing (the inclusion of empty wine bottles in the foreground may or may not have been intentional). While the image of Lohse and his German comrade with two women fits into a larger trope of photography during the German occupation of France—German men often liked to take pictures with their French girlfriends (part of what historian Julia Torrie has called the “visible trophies of war”)—the SS sweater he wears remains jarring.38 Julia Torrie adds that the “occupiers’ snapshots\n\nArt Historian, Art Dealer, SS Member\n\n31\n\nreveal how intimately their photographed leisure was linked to everyday systematic oppression.”39 In certain ways this photograph is akin to one of Lohse raising his arm in a Hitler salute to Alfred Rosenberg during the latter’s visit to the Jeu de Paume on 4 November 1943: the image of Lohse making this Nazi gesture is unsettling, to say the least.40 Yet the fact remains that Lohse was a card-­carrying Nazi and he kept his original Party membership card with him until his death. His SS file also shows him making efforts to obtain an SS-­Führerausweis (an SS leader identity card) in January 1943.41 One can imagine Lohse utilizing this SS document to diabolical advantage as he pursued artworks during the war. Lohse’s earlier experiences made him a suitable fit for wartime deployment in France. In the prewar period, he had taught sport at a Renault factory in Berlin. The French automobile manufacturer sought someone to help the engineers and workers with exercise. One requirement of the position was a command of French, which Lohse had developed during his school and university years. Lohse had also spent four months in France on a language fellowship in 1933. His time at the Renault factory provided him with a knowledge of colloquial French that would afford him special opportunities during the war. Few Germans mastered the argot as he did: he could converse not only with learned French art historians but with the laborers responsible for packing, shipping, and the like. Lohse also proved adept at carrying out negotiations in French with local art dealers; on occasion he was even called upon to liaise with Vichy officials during the German occupation. The aspiring art dealer evidently met Göring before the war, but how Lohse came into the Reichsmarschall’s orbit remains a mystery. Like other men his age—twenty-­eight when war broke out on 1 September 1939— Lohse volunteered for the army in late August 1939. His official date of entering the Wehrmacht, 27 August 1939, shows the German buildup prior to the actual attack on Poland. Lohse participated in the Polish campaign as a corporal (Gefreiter), and apparently fought as a member of a tank crew in a mechanized infantry unit (Panzerjägerabteilung). As part of a tank corps, he experienced firsthand the violent fighting at the front. The Germans suffered some fifty thousand casualties in the campaign (around sixteen thousand killed), and the conflict was more costly to the Germans than the quick victory might indicate. Exhibiting his personal survival instincts, Lohse managed to transfer to a medical unit, where he served as an ambulance driver attached to the Fourth Field Army Hospital.42 Lohse nonetheless fell ill and was sent to the infirmary. He sometimes claimed he\n\n32\n\nArt Historian, Art Dealer, SS Member\n\nwas wounded in the Poland campaign, which left him at a reduced capacity (of 55 percent, as he said in postwar accounts).43 We do not know exactly what happened to Lohse in Poland in 1939, except that he was left with a scar on his right breast and lung troubles. He may have been shot while driving an ambulance, but the record is silent on the specifics. The young corporal also developed an ulcer in August 1940 and entered a field hospital in the Polish town of Siedlce, located some sixty miles east of Warsaw. He had acute pain in his lower intestine, and on 4 September 1940, he was transported to a larger hospital in Cracow.44 Lohse recuperated sufficiently by October to be transferred to the Baltic city of Kolberg, where he joined a reserve unit. He remained on the Ostsee until early 1941, experiencing an uneventful four-­month respite. In January 1941, Lohse was ordered to Paris, where he was formally conscripted into the Luftwaffe as a member of a parachute division called the Fallschirm-­Panzerkorps Hermann Göring. He was given the rank of lance corporal. Bruno Lohse’s life stood at a crossroads. He would not have been reassigned to Paris without his personal assent; that is, he made a conscious choice to work for Göring. One can well (if not fully) understand the decision, even though it made him complicit in genocidal crimes. If one takes stock of the moment in January 1941, who was Bruno Lohse? What had he accomplished? What were his prospects? He was a salonfähig PhD with no prospects of a professorship or academic career. He was an unknown art dealer, selling from his parents’ extra rooms in a Berlin suburb. He had a distinguished record as an athlete—perhaps his most notable achievement to date. The SS membership, the proficiency in French, and some helpful social connections also boded well for his career in Nazi Germany. He had served in the military and on the eastern front—a Nazi badge of honor. But up until January 1941, Lohse’s potential surpassed his actual accomplishments. With high paternal expectations and the clock ticking, the nearly thirty-­year-­old bachelor decided it was time to take the risk and serve as Göring’s agent in Paris. His life was about to change in ways he scarcely could have imagined.\n\nC HA P TER TW O\n\nThe “King of Paris” (1941–43)\n\nW\n\nhen Lohse arrived in Paris in February 1941, he was greeted by Baron Kurt von Behr, the manager of ERR operations in the west and later the chief of the notorious M-­Aktion, in which the home furnishings of Jews in France were confiscated and shipped to the Reich.1 Behr explained to Lohse that they were securing “ownerless” Jewish property in accordance with the German-­French armistice signed at Compiègne in June 1940. Behr also informed Lohse that the entire operation was secret: even the provisions in the armistice granting the Germans the right to transport this ownerless property were secret. Lohse later talked about his Schweigepflicht, or “secrecy oath,” although he also admitted to violating it on a limited basis.2 The ERR was a kind of open secret, with a significant section of the French and German art world having some knowledge of the agency. Vichy officials issued numerous protests against the Germans’ seizure of Jewish cultural property, and they had extensive knowledge of the ERR.3 French police also handed over registration lists (Meldelisten) to the Germans, which helped Lohse and his cohort to locate Jewish property.4 With regard to the official policy of secrecy, Lohse explained that Göring ordered it because he did not want the foreign press to launch propaganda attacks, especially with regard to the trade in seized works (Tauschgeschäften), which the media would portray falsely.5 Lohse was told that this was an urgent mission, and that Reichsleiter Alfred Rosenberg, who held a Nazi Party post as supervisor of the intel33\n\n34\n\nThe “King of Paris”\n\nlectual and spiritual guidance of the German people, had been given the important responsibility of collecting information and cultural property relating to the enemies of National Socialism: Jews, Communists, and Freemasons. This was the origins of the ERR—collecting the archives and libraries of these declared enemies in France and other German-­occupied countries—and Rosenberg expanded his mandate to include artworks in the summer and fall of 1940. As the ERR widened its operations to include art—and the agency seized many important Jewish collections in France early on—the Reichsleiter detailed a team of professional art historians to divide the works into categories, photograph them, catalogue them, and, in many instances, appraise them.6 The peak of the ERR plundering came in late 1940 and early 1941, and they were desperate for trained staff.7 The assignment was initially temporary—to last only four weeks.8 Lohse was to work for Dr. Günther Schiedlausky (1907–2003), who headed the ERR’s staff of art historians.9 Schiedlausky, formerly in the sculpture department of the Kaiser Friedrich Museum in Berlin, was taciturn but cultured. Rose Valland described him as a Francophile who spoke the language well.10 Lohse later recounted that Schiedlausky initially told him that his job was to provide “a scholarly inventory” of the already secured Jewish artworks and that no confiscations would take place unless the owners were known to have fled: those who left France would be deemed stateless and their property could be confiscated.11 Lohse held fast to the notion that his job was to compile an inventory, always downplaying his role in the actual search and seizure of objects.12 He also claimed that he frequently requested reassignment during the war—that he sought to return to a fighting unit. He certainly made this request on several occasions during the war, but it’s unclear if he was earnest in every case or if this was merely a gesture for show (to suggest that he was a man of honor and possessed physical courage, among other messages). Evidence suggests that Lohse knew that these guidelines and rationalizations were a sham. He was initially charged with inventorying the Alphonse Kann collection—one of the great collections taken by the ERR. Alphonse Kann (1870–1948) collected art ranging from Old Masters to Picasso and Matisse.13 It was a collection of extraordinary quality, even if part of it was “degenerate” according to Nazi aesthetic policy. But Lohse protested the assignment shortly after beginning it. He claimed that “he found the work uncongenial” and “requested formally to be returned to his regiment at the end of the stipulated four weeks of duty.”14 Lohse had become aware of von Behr’s operational style. As ALIU officer\n\nThe “King of Paris”\n\n35\n\nJames Plaut noted, “All sources are agreed that [von Behr] initiated, directed, and personally conducted the majority of the E.R.R. confiscations without fear of consequence, without legal pretext, and without respect for ownership or quality of the works of art seized. He was impatient with all suggestions for moderation in confiscation, or for orderly cataloguing of objects received.”15 That Lohse continued to suffer from an ulcer may also be an indication that he worked for an unstable chief (and, perhaps, that he had pangs of conscience). A number of the Nazi leaders, including Himmler and Albert Speer, suffered stomach ailments during the war that appeared to have psychological origins.16 Lohse’s gastric problems had begun in Poland in August 1940—his experiences in that environment, marked by violence and bloodshed, were likely factors contributing to his affliction. For Lohse to ask to return to his unit in Poland in the spring of 1941 spoke to his deep unhappiness with his new post. Yet something extraordinary happened on 3 March 1941, two days before Lohse’s transfer back to the east was scheduled to occur: Hermann Göring came to the Jeu de Paume to inspect the artworks looted by the ERR and Lohse received him for the first time in the museum turned plundering depot. This was Göring’s third trip to the ERR headquarters, and as usual, he was accompanied by Walter Andreas Hofer, who that same month received the official title director of the art collection of the Reichsmarschall.17 Göring had visited the Jeu de Paume on both the 3rd and 5th of November 1940, the latter standing out because he issued his famous—or infamous—order detailing the pecking order for recipients of the loot: Hitler was first, followed by Göring, Alfred Rosenberg’s ideological schools, and then German museums.18 Hitler had pushed back with a memo of 14 November 1940 in which he claimed the prerogative to determine the fate the of the art (Führer-­Vorbehalt in German), but Göring, writing from his hunting lodge at Romintern on 21 November, explained to the Führer that he had a particular ability to coordinate “the recovery of Jewish art treasures.”19 Göring added that he had “resorted to bribery and hiring of French detectives and police officials to winkle these treasures out of their (often devilishly clever) hiding places.”20 Hitler did not respond and the matter simmered on unresolved. Göring clearly had ambitious plans for the ERR in Paris, and he kept a close eye on the operation. The agency had morphed from its origins as a tool of “ideological struggle” into a unique hybrid of plundering agency and art dealership.21 OSS investigator James Plaut believed it was the force of Göring’s personality, his active involvement in the affairs of the ERR in\n\n36\n\nThe “King of Paris”\n\nParis, and his utilization of Luftwaffe motor and train transport that enabled him"
