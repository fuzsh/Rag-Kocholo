Washington: Royal Netherlands Embassy, November 1998.\n\nNote: During WWII, the Nazis looted art from the occupied Netherland and transferred the booty to Germany. Although the Dutch government in exile in London took measures that enabled many confiscated art objects to be returned to their rightful owners, the ongoing problems related to the issue have led the Netherlands to launch new initiatives: the Origins Unknown Project which will investigate the origins of art objects returned from Germany and in the custody of the Dutch State; the Museums Acquisitions Project, a museum-led project, which will investigate art object acquisitions during and after WWII.\n\nOnline: http://www.netherlands-embassy.org/ww2-musea.htm .\n\n2.

In Eastern Europe, ERR, a special plunder force looted both private and public collections, whereas in the West museum collections were touched less frequently than the private collections of Jews.\n\nFiled in the Library at A2.\n\nOnline: http://www.dhh-3.de/biblio/bremen/sow3/diplom.htm .\n\n3.

The Russians occupying Germany stole the German art of Berlin and Dresden, as well as art plundered by Germans, as compensation for Soviet losses.\n\n17.

Ethics policies were analyzed to determine how the policies guide museums currently dealing with claims against their collection and prevent the acquisition of looted art in the future. In addition, three professionals knowledgeable about looted art were interviewed to determine the perception of the adequate or inadequate nature of the policies. Both the policy analysis and interview revealed the ethics policies to be vague. Interview subjects made recommendations to be included in future policies.

All party and state officials were ordered to help Hans Posse, the Director of Dresden Art Gallery and Hitler's art expert, in collecting art for the Linz gallery. Hitler's agents divided the artworks into that which was confiscated from the state's internal enemies and that which was safeguarded from the state's external enemies; other property was purchased, although frequently at a low price. The collecting headquarters for the Linz Gallery was below ground near Munich; all major works were photographed.\n\n43. Clark, Ian Christie and Lewis E. Levy.

The author's belief that Hitler's failure as architect and artist was behind his driven rise to power was confirmed by Professor Robert Waite, author of The Psychopath God: Adolf Hitler, who associates Hitler's compulsion to destroy and rebuild to a deeply rooted association in Hitler's mind between being an artist and being a creative and innovative political leader.\n\n52.

Faison tells of his dismay when he realized that works still awaiting provenance identification were to be sent to Austria and notes that Austria has been plagued with lawsuits about these objects ever since.\n\n77.

When, in November 1945, Farmer received directions to select 200 of the most important German works of art to be sent to the US temporarily, Farmer called a meeting of MFA&A members to protest the decision which he felt would discredit everything that had been done to demonstrate the integrity of the US in the its handling of German cultural treasures. The group agreed to prepare and send the Wiesbaden Manifesto, the only act of protest by officers in WWII. The paintings were sent along with the protest which was publicized by an article, \"German Paintings in the National Gallery, a protest\", by Charles Kuhn, a former Monuments Officer, which appeared in the College Art Journal in January 1946.\n\n78.

Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Ukraine is eager to obtain information on the fate of Ukrainian cultural property lost during and after WWII. The author presents a clear picture of the wartime plundering activities and notes the problems of creating an inventory of lost cultural property.\n\n79. Feliciano, Hector. The lost museum: the Nazi conspiracy to steal the world's greatest works of art. New York: BasicBooks, 1997. ix, 278 pp.\n\nNote: In the late 1930's, Paris was the world's center of art where some of the most important painters, collectors, art dealers, and experts of this century resided. We learn how the Nazis stripped French museums, churches, gallery owners, and art collectors of rare art works between the years 1939 and 1944, shipping paintings, drawings, and sculpture for the museum of European art planned for Austria after the war, as well as for the private collections of high Nazi dignitaries. By the time of the Liberation in 1944, France was the most looted country in Western Europe: one-third of all the art in private collections had been taken by the Nazis for Hitler's planned \"super museum\" at Linz, with less desirable works of art sold off to the art trade. The author focuses on the collections of five Jewish families in France; the Rothschild, Rosenberg, Bernheim-Jeune, David-Weill, and Schloss collections were chosen because of their size and importance, as well the fact that they demonstrate the methodical nature of the Nazi effort to confiscate valuable art.\n\n80. Feliciano, Hector. \"The Mauerbach Case: an equivocal sale. Part II\". Spoils of War no. 3(December 1996): 24-27.\n\nNote: The author notes that Mauerbach auction catalog, prepared by the London auction house Christie's, has a foreward by Thomas Klestil, President of Austria, stating that the artworks hidden in the Alt Aussee salt mines and stored at the Mauerbach monastery belonged to Austrian Jews. Feliciano objects and points out that the Nazis had used Alt Aussee to store art looted from all over Europe; he also notes that Austria was very secretive about the unclaimed art and made no real effort to find the rightful owners. Feliciano is critical of Christie's for not checking on ownership claims before the sale.\n\nJournal is kept in the National Archives Library.\n\nOnline: http://www.dhh-3.de/biblio/bremen/sow3 .\n\n81.

Artists were forced to join this organization if they wanted to practice their art and non-Aryan artists were excluded. In parallel, Rosenberg's Office for the Supervision of Ideological Training and Education, became the state's official watchdog, involved in book burning and emptying museums of \"non-German\" or \"degenerate\" works of art.

In the 1980s, the Soviet Union secretly returned some paintings. In 1992 a commission was set up whose task was to plan the return of works taken from Hungary and held in Russia.

In this presentation, Kline traces the steps along the way to settlement of the case and remarks on other instances in which victims have brought claims of cultural-property theft and pursued them to settlement on favorable terms or to success in courts, including the Bremen Kusthalle case.\n\n191.

In 1939, Koenigs was prepared to negotiate with the museum for the sale of the collection when the threat of invasion forced him to leave Amsterdam.

In Anglo-American law, the good trust of ownership principle, cited by Rudolf Leopold in Austrian law, does not exist; according to the European ownership principle, if the \"sincere owner\" buys from a trader through authorized trade means, with \"good trust\" and on the trader's recommendation, he or she becomes owner even, if subsequently, it is discovered that the painting has been stolen. This principle, which provides for secure ownership in trading, is not recognized in American law.\n\nFiled in the Library at K1.\n\nOnline: http://museum-security.org/reports/00398.html .\n\n197.

In 1945, Joe T. Meador, an American officer, stole many of the most valuable objects and sent them to his home in Texas. When Meador's heirs began to sell parts of the treasure after his death in 1980, Korte, a private investigator specializing in WWII displaced art, became involved through the Foundation for Prussian Cultural Heritage in Berlin.

During the German occupation, the Germans moved engravings, maps, drawings, plans, and photographic negatives and positives, mosaics, frescoes were taken to Germany.
