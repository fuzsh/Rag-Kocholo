I didn’t want to meet the people who had, if not exactly collaborated, certainly had not fought the Nazis. I was too prissy. And then, as I began to learn more about Europe under the occupation, and what it was like, and to compare it to us, I became less prissy about it. Because the people who were defending their children and their lives were in a different situation from the people who were defending their swimming pools and their contracts at Metro. They weren’t brave enough to be partisans, but they hadn’t sent any Jews to Auschwitz, either. I wasn’t gonna be the one from America to tell them they were wrong. Of course, I never forgave the people who sent Jews to the camps. But I did get so I could forgive the people who entertained the German troops. What else were they gonna do—not entertain them? Not entertain, and go where? If you had no group, if you were a group of one, what could you do? I can make a case for all the points of view.

Was any “good” culture produced during the Third Reich? There are, of course, the well-known accomplishments of Albert Speer and Leni Riefenstahl, Carl Orff, and Ernst Jünger. But conventional wisdom insists that any genuinely interesting art was rooted in the modernism of the Weimar Republic, while Nazi culture, with its rigidity and monumentality, was bad. This view is both coarse and wrong. The cultural life of Nazi Germany was complex. Fascism did not defeat modernism. It persisted as an unresolved issue throughout Hitler’s reign. Simply put, what are we to make of those cultural figures, many already with significant international reputations, who tried to find accommodation with the Nazi regime? And what effect, if any, did doing so have on their work? This book offers a more comprehensive and complicated understanding of culture during the Third Reich. While no single volume will ever be exhaustive, the history of these modernist (and modernist-­ influenced) artists goes a long way to capturing the rich and contentious cultural life of this period. “Modernism” and “modernist” are terms that I use to refer to cultural figures—and their ideas and works—that were in sympathy with avant-garde movements that rose and flourished in the last decades of the nineteenth and the first half of the twentieth century. Some historians have employed the phrase “classic modernism,” while others prefer “modernisms” to denote the plurality of styles and projects.1 Yet these modernists were united in questioning the social realism of the period and in arguing that the world as it appears to our senses constitutes an inadequate representation of reality. Instead, they argued for a deeper interiority, a greater appreciation of our instincts, and a heightened awareness of the subjectivity of our perceptions. In rejecting verisimilitude and traditional historicist idioms, they developed new aesthetic strategies, including the use of abstraction and alternative color schemes. In the visual arts the key modernist movements include Post-­Impressionism, Cubism, Expressionism, Dada, and New Objectivity. In music, atonality and dissonance were its hallmarks, s the notion\n\nPreface\n\nwith Arnold Schoenberg playing a particularly important role. Literature, for its part, featured an expressionist style of its own, although modernism in this discipline might also extend to nonlinear narrative structures and the efforts to give a voice to the poor and marginalized (for example, the works of Émile Zola). There were parallel stylistic trends across the disciplines, as well as common intellectual projects: among them, Sigmund Freud’s quest to understand the unconscious; a fascination with irrational impulses; an exploration of social alienation, and a desire to challenge the stale and oppressive conventions of the regnant order. That said, modernism can be an elusive concept, and for some it has more to do with a visceral impression. It is akin to U.S. Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart’s famous definition of pornography—that he knew it when he saw it. My approach in this book rests upon a fairly expansive conception of modernism. I recognize that certain figures do not qualify as ideal types— that their work and aesthetic philosophies contain contradictory elements. But all the figures treated at length here engaged modernist ideas in a meaningful manner at some stage of their careers. Rather than advancing a narrow conception of modernism—and trying to force figures as varied as Barlach and Riefenstahl into a procrustean bed—I argue for a broader and more flexible conception of the term: one that allows for more fruitful analytical comparisons and a more holistic examination of the multifaceted cultural history of the Third Reich. I am also aware of the sensitivities that arise when one explores the engagement with National Socialism on the part of individuals who have long been viewed as anti-Nazi or, for that matter, those who were pro-Nazi. This finds expression in the word collaboration, which has myriad associations. While some scholars have used the word to denote complicity in the crimes of the Nazi regime, I take a more expansive definition that includes accommodation and the pursuit of accommodation. The sensitivities attendant with the study of Nazi Germany demand certain responsibilities from the historian. Chief among them is scholarly and moral precision, and I take care to ensure that my sources are clearly identifiable. Researching this book compelled me to visit numerous archives and examine original documents, as well as to synthesize a vast secondary literature. In terms of the former, some figures presented particular challenges: for example, the painter Emil Nolde. I was denied access to his papers in Seebüll in northern Germany and was advised simply to consult the existing scholarly literature. But this does not prevent a deeper underxii\n\nPreface\n\nstanding of the subjects. Even with figures as elusive and as private as Nolde in North Schleswig or Ernst Ludwig Kirchner in the Swiss Alps, there are rich sources to consult. Understanding the past is inherently fraught. I undertake it with humility in the hope that my efforts will shed light on what remains a dark and haunting time.\n\nxiii\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nArtists Under Hitler\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nIntroduction\n\nI\n\nn march 1945,\n\nwith the Soviet Red Army pursuing its brutal Vistula-Oder offensive and the Western Allies advancing from the opposite direction, battling to cross the Rhine at Remagen, all of Germany’s major cities lay in ruin. Basic services were disrupted, and transport proved a difficult if not impossible proposition (many German soldiers had recently fled the Netherlands on stolen bicycles). Yet amid this chaos and destruction something remarkable occurred—or, more precisely, continued. Art dealers carried on with transactions involving the paintings of Emil Nolde and other Expressionist artists. Renowned dealer Ferdinand Möller had long based his operations in Berlin, where he provided one of the havens for lovers of modern art, but he had recently relocated to his home in eastern Pomerania, where he persevered with his trade in modern works. Möller negotiated with his counterpart Ludwig Gutbier, who had left Munich for the more secure environs of rural Bavaria. On 26 February 1945, Möller had written to Gutbier to request the transport of several modern paintings to him in the East: “I would ask you to please send the crates to me here.”1 Gutbier responded on 9 March 1945—their correspondence having been delayed—“Yesterday I received your lines from 26 February. . . . [but] there is no possibility of sending objects to Berlin, or to the locations of both of my [Karl Schmidt-] Rottluff and [Erich] Heckel customers.” He added, “I have marked as unsellable the two other paintings by Nolde and [Swiss modernist Lothar] Bechstein that are kept in my study. We follow the events in Berlin with great excitement and communicate to you our hopes that there will soon be a turn of events.” In other words, Gutbier had finally accepted\n\nIntroduction\n\nthat the current situation precluded the transport of these Expressionist works in his possession, but he continued to hope for a change of fortune. Möller and Gutbier had sustained their enterprises until that point, and other colleagues of theirs actually continued to sell modern works until late April 1945—some two weeks before the final defeat. Their establishments had become rubble-strewn and lacked heat, but they carried on. They even used the official Reichspost to transact their business. The dealers also did not appear unduly concerned about the Gestapo or other intelligence agencies pursuing them for trading in officially proscribed art. A second revealing episode involves Max Beckmann, the legendary artist who had left Germany in July 1937 when the Nazi regime had opened the twin shows in Munich, The Great German Art Exhibition, which featured officially accepted works, and the Degenerate Art Exhibition, which mocked and vilified modernist works. Beckmann had relocated to Amsterdam, where he enjoyed one of his most productive periods. He completed over seven hundred paintings during his time in the Netherlands, many of them during the war. Despite being a modernist and a figure associated with the Weimar Republic—which the Nazis reviled—Beckmann continued his work unimpeded after the Nazi occupation commenced in May 1940. He also overcame the logistical challenges when canvas and paints proved difficult to come by. How did he manage this? The answer lies in his close friend, Erhard Göpel, an art historian and dealer. Göpel also served as an agent for Adolf Hitler and scoured the Netherlands and France for artworks that would go to the Führermuseum planned for Linz. Göpel trafficked in looted art, playing a central role, for example, in the liquidation of the famed Schloss collection in France, consisting of some 330 paintings. Yet even while working as a plunderer and navigating networks of nefarious characters, Göpel remained friends with Beckmann. He carried letters back and forth between the artist and various contacts in Germany and, on occasion, transported paintings. Beckmann painted Göpel’s portrait during the war, including a well-known picture created in the midst of the infamous Dutch “Hunger Winter” of 1944 in which he portrayed Hitler’s agent in seemingly full health, seated in a comfortable interior and holding an art book. The two men continued their close relationship into the postwar period. Later, after the artist had succumbed to a heart attack in 1950, Göpel edited Beckmann’s diaries for the war years, and also published a series of well-regarded books on the artist, including a catalogue raisonné of Beckmann’s paintings. Erhard Göpel, along with his wife, art historian Barbara Göpel, became authorities on Beckmann in the postwar period. 2\n\nIntroduction\n\nMax Beckmann would not be the only modernist cultural figure to consort with plunderers and perpetrators in Nazi Germany. A third vignette took place even earlier—in February of 1933—and concerns a competition to design a new Reichsbank in Berlin. Hitler had been appointed chancellor on 30 January and had immediately set out to define his regime by way of architecture and other cultural initiatives. He ordered bank president Hans Luther, a former Reich chancellor, to organize a competition, which Luther in turn entrusted to Heinrich Wolff, the head of the Reichsbank’s building department. Rather than commence a timeconsuming open competition, Wolff and his committee selected thirty architects to submit designs. Among them were Bauhaus founder Walter Gropius and the current Bauhaus director, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. The Bauhaus, which counted as the most famous art school in Germany—if not the world—stood as a vivid symbol of the Weimar Republic. The locus of controversy since its founding in 1919—the Bauhaus had been forced to move from Weimar to Dessau in 1925 due to local opposition, and then to Berlin in 1932 for similar reasons—the school had been a favorite target of the Nazis. Yet here were two of its leaders asked to undertake a design for Hitler’s first public building. Gropius and Mies complied, submitting elaborate plans and models. Indeed, Gropius provided a great deal more material than was called for, including blueprints, cost estimates, a philosophical statement, and photographs of a mock-up.2 The image of Walter Gropius working feverishly on the new Reichsbank headquarters in early 1933 and hoping that he would become an official architect in the Third Reich needs to be integrated into the cultural history of Nazi Germany. Examining the experiences of those modernist cultural figures who sought to find a place in the Third Reich prompts a central question: why did they seek accommodation with the Nazi regime? The answer is multifaceted. People are complex and rarely, if ever, act due to a single motivation. Rather, several factors entered into the thinking of the figures in this book: first, a misunderstanding of the Nazi leaders and their goals; second, an unchecked ego and sense of self-importance, whereby they thought their work to be indispensable to their field; third, a highly developed survival instinct—in part a legacy of an earlier time when modernism provoked veritable culture wars—combined with a more garden-variety opportunism; fourth, the mixed signals from the Nazi leaders themselves, some of whom embraced modernism and buoyed the cultural figures’ optimism; and finally, a belief that the intellectual goals of modernism and fascism were compatible—that a new and meaningful synthesis between the two 3\n\nIntroduction\n\nwas possible. It is helpful, before considering specific figures and their experiences, to elaborate briefly on these factors. A key to understanding the history of Nazi Germany is the realization that the regime gradually grew more radical. The dark, totalitarian society of 1943, with the ongoing murder of European Jews, the violent response to dissent, and the near complete mobilization of the population as part of the “total war” measures, was quite different from Germany in 1933— or even 1937. Of course, intimidation and violence also characterized the earlier years, and anti-Semitism proved an enduring facet of National Socialism, but many initially held out hope for a “kinder and gentler” Nazi regime. Hitler had checks on his power—for example, in President Paul von Hinden­burg until August 1934, and in the armed forces and the Foreign Office. Correspondingly, there was also considerable cultural heterogeneity. The Nazis’ efforts at coordination (the virtually untranslatable word they coined was Gleichschaltung) had not yet run their course. Furthermore, most artists did not endorse a racial war of conquest or mass murder. Their efforts at accommodation were born out of fundamental misapprehensions about the Nazi regime. This does not mean that they were not anti-Semitic, or fervently anti-Communist, or chauvinistically nationalistic. Some were all of the above. But when they sought out a place in the Reich, they scarcely imagined what would transpire during the war. The modernists were not the only ones to underestimate Hitler. Kurt Hahn, the Jewish educator who had overseen an elite school at Salem on Lake Constance before emigrating to the United Kingdom (where he founded the Gordonstoun School, among other institutions), initially believed that the responsibilities of office would moderate the behavior of the Nazi leader; but this, according to historian Golo Mann, “was not the real Hitler but an imaginary one that had a place in Hahn’s political thought.”3 Their own egos often blinded them to the realities of the time. Some saw themselves as gods in a kind of modernist pantheon and were often celebrated as such on an international level. For example, the Museum of Modern Art in New York organized a grand retrospective on the Bauhaus in 1938, and Gropius was the star of this show—just as he had been in the 1930 exhibition on the Bauhaus organized in Cambridge, Massachusetts, by a coterie of Harvard students.4 Many cultural figures believed their work was so central to their fields that excluding them would be virtually impossible. They had altered the courses of their disciplines and remained confident that they would continue to play a pivotal role, even if this meant making concessions to the new regime. The triumphs they had enjoyed in 4\n\nIntroduction\n\nthe 1920s—professorships, directorships, commercial success, and fame— had only added to their sense of self-importance. The last director of the Bauhaus before it was closed in 1933, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, to take another example, was a gruff man, a “difficult genius” type. He preferred the word “Baukunst” (literally, building art) to “Architektur.” Years after he had immigrated to the United States, Mies remained brusquely demanding. With regard to the Seagram Building in New York that he designed with Philip Johnson, his biographer Elaine Hochman noted that between 1954 and 1958 “the Seagram employees were not allowed to close the Venetian blinds in their offices in his skyscraper in New York, lest the resulting disorder mar the appearance of the façade from the street. Only Mies’s death released them from this constraint.”5 Comprehending his colleague’s belief that art came first and that he possessed the extraordinary talent that enabled him to design for anyone, Philip Johnson quipped, “If the devil himself offered Mies a job he would take it.”6 Of course, these modernist icons expected certain difficulties in Nazi Germany, but they had weathered storms throughout their careers. Before World War I, audiences rioted at Stravinsky concerts and few bought Expressionist paintings. Even during the Weimar Republic, when, to play upon historian Peter Gay’s famous phrase, “The outsider became an insider,” they faced strong opposition in many quarters, especially in the countryside and in provincial cities.7 But just as they had endured attacks and insults before, they expected to find a way to move forward after 1933. The figures in question were not Jewish. Most Jewish modernists recognized that it would be impossible to make a career in Nazi Germany and therefore emigrated. Those non-Jews who sought accommodation with the Nazi regime did not want to lose their positions, or to part with family and friends. Reality eventually set in for many—especially those who were iconic figures in their fields prior to the Nazi seizure of power—who gradually came to the realization that they would never be accepted. Despite their egos and predilection for opportunism, many departed Germany in the mid-to-late-1930s, finally giving up in the face of the regime’s unrelenting radicalization. Another key component that induced many modernists to seek accommodation was the perceived sympathy for their cause exhibited by certain Nazi leaders. The central figure in the early years of the Third Reich was Joseph Goebbels, the intensely energetic Propaganda Minister who styled himself as the “czar of Nazi culture.” With his Reich Ministry for People’s Enlightenment and Propaganda, which came into existence in March 1933, and the establishment of his Reich Chamber of Culture the following Sep5\n\nIntroduction\n\ntember (every practicing artist was obliged to join the latter group) he was well on his way to realizing his ambitions. His appointment as Reich Minister included the provision that Goebbels was “competent for tasks concerning the cultural molding of the nation,” and this augured well for the pro-modernist camp. In the spring of 1933, Goebbels engaged a young and then unknown architect-designer named Albert Speer to remodel his home on Lake Wannsee in Berlin. The Reich Propaganda Minister expressed his approval of Speer’s choice of landscapes by Emil Nolde as part of the decoration. Indeed, Goebbels’s wife, Magda, had accompanied Speer to the Berlin Nationalgalerie and helped select the pictures by Nolde, an act that suggested even greater solidarity in support of the artist.8 Back in 1924, after visiting the Wallraf-Richartz Museum in Cologne, Goebbels noted in his journal that he had discovered “a Spanish dancer by Nolde. Wonderful colors. An exquisite, deep red.”9 Goebbels also kept a small figure on his desk (Man in a Storm) by Expressionist artist Ernst Barlach. In a January 1936 letter to his son, Barlach wrote that he believed that Goebbels actually owned two of his sculptures (the other was apparently Begging Woman). In 1924, Goebbels had written about another Barlach sculpture, The Berserker (1910), that was also exhibited in the Wallraf-Richartz Museum, exclaiming that he was “gripped by the sculpture. . . . The true spirit of Expressionism! Brevity raised to the level of grandiose interpretation.”10 In mid-1935, Goebbels commissioned a portrait by Berlin Secessionist Leo von König, an aristocratic painter who worked in a distinctly modern style (his paintings were purged two years later as part of the “degenerate art” action). Goebbels admired the painting and ordered a second rendition (paid for with ministerial funds). Baron von König signed his letters to the Propaganda Ministry “Heil Hitler!”—indicating that he also hoped for official acceptance.11 Modernists continued to have sympathizers in the upper reaches of the Nazi state and carved out room to create and exhibit their work. For example, in the late 1930s Nazi Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop and his wife, Annelies, commissioned painter Otto Dix to paint a portrait of their children, despite the fact that Dix had been a prominent modernist in both the Expressionist and the Neue Sachlichkeit (New Objectivity) movements and had always been associated with the political left. The Ribbentrops hung works in their homes by Franz Radziwill (a former member of the left-wing Novembergruppe), André Derain (a French Fauve), and Gustave Courbet (a leader of the Paris Commune and radical in his day).12 The art of the former Communist and Neue Sachlichkeit painter Georg Schrimpf, whose works were included in the Degenerate Art Exhibition, hung in the 6\n\nIntroduction\n\nhomes of Deputy Führer Rudolf Hess, Reich Peasant Leader Richard Walter Darré, and Bernhard Rust, Reich Minister for Science, Education, and People’s Culture.13 Modernist works were also exhibited in public spaces during the Third Reich. In Vienna, for example, an exhibition of young artists, many of whom worked in abstracted styles, opened in February 1943, the same time the regime was moving to a “total war” footing and growing more malignant. That the Viennese governor and former Hitler Youth Leader Baldur von Schirach had sponsored the show made it all the more remarkable. The exhibition Junge Kunst im Deutschen Reich (Youthful Art in the German Reich) elicited controversy and was shut down on Hitler’s orders. But Vienna’s cultural life continued to include modernist elements until 1945. Exhibitions of the art of Gustav Klimt and the regular sale of works by Egon Schiele at the Dorotheum, the state-owned auction house, were but two indications of the persistence of modernism in the former Habsburg capital. Fascist Italy, where Mussolini had embraced Futurism and other cultural modes associated with the avant-garde, provided yet another reason for the modernists’ hopefulness. The acceptance of modernism prevented the alienation of key constituencies and helped legitimate the political leaders —validating them as sophisticated elites, which was especially important after years of “thuggery and vulgarity.”14 Fascism and modernism also shared many core principles, starting with the “myth of national regeneration.” As historian Emilio Gentile has noted, exponents of “the modernist avant-garde . . . proposed a spiritual revolution that, starting from a philosophy or art, should affect all areas of life, including the world of politics.”15 Gentile mapped much of the common terrain shared by the Italian modernists and the Fascists, including the notion of a spiritual revolution, the belief in youth as a regenerative force, and the glorification of violence. The Futurists also celebrated speed and technology, detested Bolshevism, and styled themselves as nationalists, and did so publicly (and in the German press) well into the late 1930s.16 All of these ideas could easily be reconciled with the German brand of fascism. It also did not hurt that Mussolini had been influenced by his mistress, Margherita Sarfatti, and had come to appreciate German Expressionism, with a special regard for the artists in Die Brücke (The Bridge). Young Fascisti also often evinced enthusiasm about other German modernists. The Neue Sachlichkeit works of Otto Dix, for example, were exhibited in Milan in 1933.17 Mussolini himself believed that his German counterparts should embrace modernism, albeit with distinctive national characteristics. Because the Nazis had borrowed heav7\n\nIntroduction\n\nily from the original Fascists—the Roman salute (“Heil Hitler!”) and the black shirts of the Squadristi as uniforms for the SS, to take two examples— many observers believed that the Fascists and the Nazis would share a common cultural policy. Even the contemporaneous Austro-fascist leaders in Vienna promoted modernism, despite their nationalistic, anti-Bolshevist, and staunchly Catholic orientation. Certain Nazi officials appreciated the potential for a common, or at least coordinated, cultural policy among fascist countries, and invited Mussolini’s government to send exemplars of its modernist art to Berlin in the spring of 1934. The reconciliation of fascism and modernism emerged as an international trend and constitutes the fifth key factor frequently underlying the search for accommodation. French author Louis-Ferdinand Céline, American poet Ezra Pound, American architect and designer Philip Johnson, and Finnish composer Jean Sibelius count among the modernists who exhibited sympathies for fascism. In many respects, this quest for a synthesis between modernism and, in the German case, National Socialism brings to mind literary critic George Steiner’s question that he posed in his 1971 essay “A Season in Hell”: Art, intellectual pursuits, the development of the natural sciences, many branches of scholarship flourished in close spatial, temporal proximity to massacre and the death camps. It is this structure and meaning of that proximity which must be looked at. Why did humanistic traditions and models of conduct prove so fragile a barrier against political bestiality? In fact, were they a barrier, or is it more realistic to perceive in humanistic culture express solicitations of authoritarian rule and cruelty?18 As Steiner suggests, certain aspects of modernism dovetailed with the National Socialist ideology. While this synergistic relationship took many forms, three elements stood out: a desire to explore and exploit the irrational side of humans; a belief that modernist cultural forms corresponded to specifically German national characteristics; and an appreciation of technology and machines. Many modernists and National Socialists shared a belief in the power of irrational instincts. An earlier generation of modernists had tried to tap into the Dionysian forces—the wild, instinctive, and animalistic aspects of humanity that played a role in sublime art (at least according to Friedrich Nietzsche). This energy was part of the appeal of the “neo-Primitivism” of Picasso and others—what George Steiner called “the charismatic ap8\n\nIntroduction\n\npeal of ‘barbaric forms.’” Hitler and his cohort also proved adept at utilizing irrational appeals to followers. Standing among hundreds of thousands of spectators in Nuremberg, surrounded by vibrant red and black swastika banners and otherworldly lighting effects, the viewer lost himself (or, less often, herself) in an amorphous crowd. The religious qualities of the event—the “longing for transcendence”—and the hypnotic appeal of the dictator affirmed these irrational impulses. With the chorus of “Heil Hitler” chants shouted in unison, among other theatrical effects, the Nazis organized a kind of Gesamtkunstwerk that touched people on a deep, visceral level. Thomas Mann realized this when he opined in the 1930s that National Socialism and Expressionism stemmed from the same “root.”19 A number of modernist cultural figures who tried to find accommodation with the Nazis—Martin Heidegger, Gottfried Benn, even Albert Speer— identified commonalities based on emotions, instincts, and profound life forces. Historian Richard Wolin coined the phrase “the seduction of unreason” to describe certain intellectuals’ gravitation to fascism.20 Another argument advanced in this effort to reconcile modernism with National Socialism concerned national character. In the realm of visual arts (along with architecture, the focal point of the debate about modernism in the Third Reich), many believed that Expressionism captured essentially Germanic qualities. The landscapes of Emil Nolde, with their rural settings and spiritual overtones, seemed a perfect representation of the “Blut und Boden” (Blood and Soil) motif favored by the Nazis—or, certainly, the conservative, völkisch faction. It did not hurt that Nolde was an avid supporter of the Nazis and begged to play a meaningful role in the “new” Germany. Ernst Ludwig Kirchner painted mountain scenes that glowed incandescently in vibrant hues—suggesting a deeper spiritual resonance—and he populated many of his canvases with isolated peasant herders and their animals. The focus on the power of nature and the soul-killing effects of modern society provided additional linkages between German Expressionism and National Socialism. The black and white wood-block print, a favored medium for German Expressionists, harkened back to the German medieval tradition, and the historic Gothic style resonated in the work of sculptors like Ernst Barlach. These affinities between the medieval, Romantic, and modernist cultural forms offered an intellectual underpinning for those who hoped for a more tolerant Kunstpolitik (arts policy). The phrase “Nordic Expressionism,” which occurred with greater frequency in the early 1930s, also reflected a belief that Expressionism and National Socialism could be reconciled (Plates 4–7).21 9\n\nIntroduction\n\nOn a more practical level, Germans had often taken the lead with modernist projects in the twentieth century, and this provided Goebbels and his cohorts with plenty of German talent to exploit. Goebbels believed with good reason that having gifted people in Germany would reflect positively on his ministry and the regime more generally. He therefore sought to enlist the most prestigious cultural figures he could. The Reich Chamber of Culture offered the best opportunity. The seven arts-specific chambers (literature, journalism, radio, theater, music, film, and visual arts) each needed a president and a vice president, and there would be a Reich Cultural Senate to which he could appoint those luminaries whom he favored. Goebbels, for example, explored the idea of luring director Fritz Lang back from Holly­wood to head up the Reich Chamber of Film. Both Goebbels and Hitler greatly admired Lang’s 1926 epic, Metropolis, which explored the theme of a leader’s psychological power over the masses. In particular, they praised the manner in which the director coordinated the movement of people. Although an iconic figure in the Weimar modernist renaissance, Fritz Lang came into consideration for the post, just as Goebbels turned to Richard Strauss, who served as the first president of the Reich Chamber of Music. According to Lang, he met with Goebbels in March 1933 and, rather than being castigated for putting “Nazi slogans into the mouth of a pathological criminal,” which he had done in The Last Will of Dr. Mabeuse, Lang was offered “a leading post in the German film industry.” The director, of course, did not accept the offer from Goebbels. He later engaged in some self-mythologizing about his departure from Germany—he did not, as he claimed, flee to Paris that very night “practically penniless”—yet the discussions about his assuming the presidency of the film Chamber are in themselves illuminating.22 The Reich Propaganda Minister was also prepared to mend fences with Thomas Mann, who had so forcefully defended the Weimar Republic and denounced National Socialism. Because Mann had been a patriot in World War I, was loyal to the imperial monarchy, and was not Jewish, Goebbels believed it might be possible to bring him into the fold.23 Mann’s books, such as his modernist novella Death in Venice, were not thrown into the pyres during the protests “against the un-German spirit” on 10 May 1933. Thomas Mann as head of the Reich Chamber for Literature would have been a sensation. There were other appointments to make, and other cultural luminaries to co-opt. Goebbels would compel Wilhelm Furtwängler, arguably the most famous conductor in the world at the time, to continue on at the Berlin Philharmonic, which Goebbels effectively controlled. He 10\n\nIntroduction\n\nalso made Furtwängler the vice president (under Strauss) of the Reich Chamber of Music. Perhaps he could even lure Marlene Dietrich back from Hollywood? An enthusiasm for technology offered another affinity shared by modernists and Nazis. Granted, one must avoid the simplification that an embrace of technology equals modernity, which in turn equals modernism. The relationships are far more complicated and provisional. Yet machine aesthetics intrigued many modernists, especially those with a more rationalistic approach (as compared to the Expressionists). Machines offered a highly favored metaphor, with Le Corbusier, for example, articulating his well-known credo, “A house is a machine for living in.” Kurt Weill and Paul Hindemith engaged modern technology in another way in their opera Der Lindberghflug (The Lindbergh Flight) (1929), which also allowed them to explore myths about the United States (a country that itself constituted one of the “quintessential symbols of modernity”).24 Modernist architects typically engaged technology, with most favoring austere, streamlined design and embracing new machine-made materials such as glass, concrete, and steel. This kind of architecture persisted throughout the Third Reich. Modernists during the Weimar period also worked in the diverse fields of industrial design—what Pierre Bourdieu would later call (with an element of sarcasm) “the illegitimate arts”: that is, the less established fields such as graphic design, advertising, and photography, among others.25 Because these newer arts did not attract the same publicity as more traditional genres, with practitioners working out of the limelight and often as members of larger teams, it was often possible to continue this work during the Third Reich. The graphic artists for the magazine Die neue Linie (The New Line), for example, which was published in Leipzig, continued with progressive design techniques until the magazine ceased production in 1943.26 Bauhaus “Werkmeister” Christian Dell, who created sleek modernist lamps, also continued his industrial design work during the Third Reich. And Herbert Bayer, who conceived so many of the iconic images associated with the Bauhaus and was later known for the ski posters he did in Aspen, produced images for a propagandistic exhibition staged by the Nazi regime in 1934. Bayer also contributed to a brochure in the mid-1930s “meant to lure people from all over the world to see the Führer’s achievements.”27 Despite the relatively low visibility of most of these designers with modernist ties, they were important to the culture of the Third Reich. Modernists, therefore, often sought accommodation with the National Socialist regime, and did so for both ideological and personal reasons. This 11\n\nIntroduction\n\nis not to deny that some modernists were truly against Hitler and chose to emigrate. The German émigré community during the Third Reich represented the greatest assemblage of cultural talent ever to leave a country. Yet the image of virtuous émigrés has long overshadowed the fact that a wide array of cultural figures who were trained or who worked in a modernist tradition attempted to find a place in Hitler’s Reich. This includes Walter Gropius, Paul Hindemith, Gottfried Benn, Ernst Barlach, Emil Nolde, Richard Strauss, Gustaf Gründgens, Leni Riefenstahl, Arno Breker, and Albert Speer, as well as Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Wilhelm Furtwängler, Carl Orff, Werner Egk, Herbert von Karajan, Martin Heidegger, Gerhart Hauptmann, and Ernst Jünger. The list goes on. Although it is important to preserve distinctions and recognize significant differences between these figures, including their different relationships to modernism, they all shared a belief that their work would be an asset to the new Germany. Some of the modernists successfully acted on this belief and, by altering the styles of their work, reached the apogees of their careers. Speer and Riefenstahl, who were trained in modernist traditions, offer vivid examples. Others went even further in terms of adapting to the regime and meeting its “needs.” Fritz Ertl, for example, who was one of about 1,300 students to pass through the Bauhaus, studying at the Dessau facility between 1928 and 1931, became a Waffen-SS officer, and an urban planner at the Ausch­ witz site.28 Ertl obviously represented an extreme example, while most other modernists sought accommodation in a less injurious manner. These efforts, as indicated earlier, were more common in the early years of the Third Reich. For example, an August 1934 petition in support of Hitler succeeding Paul von Hindenburg as head of state bore the signatures of many leading cultural figures, including Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Wilhelm Furtwängler, Richard Strauss, Emil Nolde, Erich Heckel, and Ernst Barlach. Granted, as detailed later, these signatures were obtained in certain instances by subjecting the artists to a measure of duress, but their compliance nonetheless attested to a yearning for a peaceful coexistence with the Nazi regime. Other documents penned by modernist heroes prove more troubling. Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, a founding member of Die Brücke and a pioneer of German Expressionism, responded to pressure to resign from the Prussian Academy of the Arts (Preussische Akademie der Künste) on 17 May 1933 by sending the executive secretary the following response: I have never derived any personal advantages from the membership. I have instead tried to honor the institution and have always sent my 12\n\nIntroduction\n\nbest work for your exhibitions. For more than thirty years now, I have struggled through my work for a new, strong, and authentic German art and will continue to do this as long as I live. I am neither a Jew nor a Social Democrat, nor otherwise been politically active; and in general, have a clean conscience. I am therefore waiting patiently to see what the new government will do with regard to the question of the Academy and leave with confidence the question of my membership in your hands.29 The Prussian Academy held off making a decision about Kirchner, as it did with architect Mies van der Rohe and sculptor Rudolf Belling. All three tried to find accommodation with the Nazi regime. As artist Max Pechstein said about Belling, “he is performing the most fantastic leaps, like a salmon he is trying again and again to overcome the weir to climb the heights, but until now in vain.”30 Yet all three were later forced out of the Academy in 1937. Of course, they were not alone in expressing regret about being unable to play a role in the new Reich. In July 1937, architect Bruno Paul wrote, “I would still like to emphasize how much I have regretted, and still regret, that I was not able to use my extensive experience and knowledge in the area . . . of art . . . in the service of National Socialistic principles.”31 This book in no way seeks to minimize the sacrifices or suffering of the many modernist cultural figures who opposed the regime, especially during the war. Painter Max Pechstein went fishing in order to feed himself, and former Bauhaus Master Oskar Schlemmer painted camouflage for the Luftwaffe and then worked in a lacquer factory in Wuppertal.32 At a different level of hardship, Bauhaus-trained artist Franz Ehrlich, who had studied with Wassily Kandinsky, Paul Klee, and Lázló Moholy-Nagy, designed the gates of the Buchenwald concentration camp, where he had been a prisoner since 1935. Ehrlich rendered the inscription, “Jedem das Seine” (To each his own), in such a way that the Bauhaus influence was readily apparent.33 A number of cultural figures opposed to the regime paid with their lives, including writer Erich Mühsam (1878–1934), journalist Carl von Ossiet­ zky (1889–1938), film director Herbert Selpin (1904–1942), and pianist Karlrobert Kreiten (1916–1943). And Jews always faced grave dangers, as evidenced by the tragic fates of modernist painters Felix Nussbaum (1904– 1944), Ignaz Kaufmann (1885–1941), and Charlotte Salomon (1917–1943), as well as sculptor Otto Freundlich (1878–1943). Yet this clearly was not the entire story. The figures in this book have been selected for a variety of reasons, but 13\n\nIntroduction\n\nBauhaus-trained artist Franz Ehrlich, who studied at the Dessau school from 1927 to 1930, designed the gates of Buchenwald in 1938 while incarcerated in the camp. It features the famous slogan “Jedem das Seine” (To each his own). (Peter Hansen/Sammlung Gedenkstätte Buchenwald)\n\nlargely because of their important artistic work and high-profile careers, and because they were representative of the most important fields in the cultural life of the Third Reich. In both Chapter 2 (about failed attempts to find accommodation) and Chapter 3 (accommodation realized), I have selected five figures that broadly cover the cultural life of Nazi Germany. Chapter 3 does not include a painter (only a sculptor, Arno Breker), which in part speaks to the more stridently anti-modernist policies that eventually prevailed with regard to pictures. Of course, there were painters with modernist roots that found official acceptance—Paul Mathias Padua, Albin EggerLienz, and even Adolf Ziegler, among others—but none rivaled Breker in terms of importance of their work to the field of the visual arts. These ten figures, when considered collectively, cannot reflect every facet of culture in Nazi Germany, but they go a long way toward capturing this complex history.\n\n14\n\nPart I “The Summer of Art” and Beyond\n\nM\n\nodernists came closest to realizing their vision of reconciliation with the National Socialists in 1933—more specifically, during “the summer of art,” as some have called it. At least, this proved true in terms of the coalescence of support for modernism among certain Nazi leaders. The summer of 1933 marked the apogee regarding the debate over Expressionism. Hitler remained indecisive with respect to cultural policy, and this created an environment rife with impassioned debate. In order to understand the modernists’ quest for accommodation, one must appreciate the uncertainty, the aspirations, and the alliances that provided the basis for this hopefulness. This “summer of art” saw the misapprehension of the true nature of National Socialism and the belief in the importance and compatibility of the modernists’ own work in a revived Germany. These views would persist until 1937, when Hitler induced Goebbels to organize the Degenerate Art Exhibition. Even then, support for Expressionism and other forms of modernism continued, but not with the transparency and optimism of the earlier years. A cohort of former Bauhaus architects, for example, constructing the massive Hermann Göring Works in Linz in the late 1930s in a modern, functional idiom, might offer a different high point in terms of practice. Hitler himself cared most about architecture among all the arts (although painting, his former profession, and opera, especially Richard Wagner’s work, also occupied important parts of his mental life). Yet in the early years of the Third Reich, the visual arts offered the most dramatic contest over aesthetic policy. In late July 1933, the exhibition Thirty German Artists opened.\n\n“The Summer of Art” and Beyond\n\nThe show featured works by established Expressionists, such as Emil Nolde, Ernst Barlach, and Christian Rohlfs, but also by a younger generation, including Otto Andreas Schreiber and Hans Weidemann. The latter two were Nazis who, in addition to painting modernist canvases, were storm troopers (members of the Sturm Abteilung, or SA). Schreiber and Weidemann, along with Fritz Hippler, also headed the Berlin chapter of the National Socialist German Students’ League—the NSD-Studentenbund. The leaders of the Students’ League, along with modernist art dealer Ferdinand Möller, organized Thirty German Artists. Prior to the opening of the exhibition, the students staged a pro-modernist rally. They advertised the event by making posters themselves. Many were titled “Youth Fights for German Art” and “Witness of Youth for Art.” These were bright red in color and covered the walls of the university in the days prior to the rally. The students also extended special invitations to a number of luminaries, including Mies van der Rohe, Karl Hofer, and Berlin Nationalgalerie director Ludwig Justi. On the evening of 29 June, the students and their special guests convened in the main auditorium at the Humboldt University on Unter den Linden. Observers reported that the atmosphere was electric, with the auditorium bursting with an overflow crowd. Fritz Hippler—later a key aide to Goebbels —delivered a speech in which he railed against the “restoration of Wilhelmian academicism and all regulation of art.”1 He was followed by other speakers who defended Expressionism. The last speaker was Otto Andreas Schreiber, who announced that the art exhibition was formally under the protection of the student group. The participants at the rally approved a resolution that declared, “The principal threat to the birth of a new art lies in the narrow-minded exclusion of valuable German artists from this collaborative effort [to regenerate the nation and its culture]—this, for reasons not related to their personalities or work.”2 During this pro-modernist rally at the Humboldt University, Hippler and Schreiber whipped the crowd into a frenzy. But they had more in mind than an emotional catharsis. The carefully phrased resolution that they had drafted (with the aforementioned line about “the principal threat to the birth of a new art lies in the narrow-minded exclusion of valuable German artists from this collaborative effort”), and that they proceeded to pass by acclamation, had unambiguous political undertones. Historian Peter Paret noted, “The meeting attracted attention in the public and the press, not only because of the speakers’ challenging words but also because one of the organizers [Weidemann] worked in the Propaganda Ministry, which suggested that the meeting represented Goebbels’s views, or at least was being 16\n\n“The Summer of Art” and Beyond\n\nFerdinand Möller, a modernist artwork dealer and co-organizer of the important but controversial 1933 exhibition Thirty German Artists. (Berlinische Galerie)\n\nused by Goebbels to test how far disagreements on cultural issues were still permissible.”3 If there were any doubts about the implications of the rally, Schreiber also “proclaimed the dissolution” of the anti-modernist pressure group, the Fighting League for German Culture, at the Berlin art schools and academies. Schreiber’s speech was published on 10 July 1933 in the Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung, and then again a second time on 14 July. The paper also published declarations of support from student groups at other universities. There was widespread optimism in the bourgeois press, which had not yet been taken over by the Nazis. For example, the Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung reported that Hitler “regretted the breach with Barlach.”4 Word then leaked that Goebbels had borrowed several Nolde paintings from the Berlin Nationalgalerie. Rumors also circulated that Goebbels had expressed regrets about the 10 May 1933 book burnings, which had provoked negative reactions abroad.5 Three weeks later, the Thirty German Artists exhibition opened at the Ferdinand Möller Galerie on the Lützow-Ufer in central Berlin—just down the street from Jewish modernist Alfred Flechtheim’s famous gallery. Throngs 17\n\n“The Summer of Art” and Beyond\n\nof students, artists, and other culturally aware observers packed the premises so that one could hardly move, let alone see the Expressionist works. But the opening was less about viewing the art than it was a demonstration of support for a more “liberal” arts policy. If Hitler and the other Nazi leaders were serious about empowering German youth, if they were to act on their promises for change and renewal, and if they were dedicated to finding a truly Germanic form of art, then they would respect this bold studentled initiative. But in a foreshadowing of events to come—such as the Röhm Purge of June 1934, when the more socialistic branch of the Nazi Party came under attack, including its figurehead, the storm trooper chief—Hitler and key subleaders moved against the overly “progressive” students. Three days after the exhibition’s opening, Reich Minister of the Interior Wilhelm Frick, who controlled the police, set his forces on the Möller Galerie. Utilizing the powers derived in the wake of the Reichstag fire from the Emergency Decree of 28 February 1933, Frick closed the exhibition and stationed uniformed officers at the entrance. This was by no means the end of the battle, and the show’s organizers managed to arrange for its reopening a week later; it was, however, a clear signal that the fight would be arduous.\n\n18\n\n1 The Fight over Modernism\n\nLeo von König, Portrait of Dr. Goebbels (1935)—a work that featured modernist stylistic influences and so pleased the Reich Propaganda Minister that he commissioned von König to execute a replica. (Reprinted from Bruno Kroll, Leo von König, Berlin: Rembrandt Verlag, 1941)\n\nT\n\nhe debate over Expressionism, which stood out as the most visible fault line in the battle over modernism, actually represented a struggle for overall control of Nazi cultural policy. The two chief combatants, the figureheads of their respective camps in the early years of the Third Reich, were Alfred Rosenberg, a rabidly anti-modernist philosopher, and Joseph Goebbels, the recently appointed Reich Minister for People’s Enlightenment and Propaganda and the Gauleiter (Nazi Party district leader) of Berlin. Goeb­bels and the pro-modernists had a distinct advantage in terms of bureaucratic standing. Rosenberg headed up the Fighting League for German Culture (Kampfbund für Deutsche Kultur)—a kind of cultural nongovernmental organization—but had no state or Party position with regard to culture in 1933. On the other hand, the slippery Goebbels was wavering in his support of modernism—at least publicly—and reluctant to expend political capital on a cause that he knew Hitler opposed on a personal level. Having grown up in provincial Linz, Austria, Hitler never developed an appreciation for modernist culture and instead developed affinities for more traditional historicist styles. One of the pro-modernists’ problems grew out of the less than firm support shown by the Reich Propaganda Minister. For example, curator Ernst Holzinger wrote Berlin Nationalgalerie director Eberhard Hanfstaengl in 1937 that Goebbels was reported to have said back in 1934 that “[Franz] Marc would probably have been the leading German artist if he had not fallen in war.”1 The two museum officials were uncertain whether Goebbels actually uttered these words, but the fact that the rumor circulated among museum officials captures the sense among those engaged in this debate that he supported modernism, but not in an unwavering or open manner. Rosenberg and his allies, on the other hand, were never lacking in resolve or self-assuredness. Rosenberg had been the first among the Nazi leaders to build an organization for cultural affairs. The editor of the Nazi newspa20\n\nThe Fight over Modernism\n\nArno Breker, Portrait Bust of Alfred Rosenberg (1940), the Nazi ideologue and unofficial leader of the völkisch movement. (Zentralinstitut für Kunstgeschichte, Munich)\n\nper, Der Völkische Beobachter, Rosenberg had founded the Fighting League for German Culture in Munich in 1927, and by 1933 the pressure group had branches stretching across Germany. He oversaw an ambitious initiative to lobby politicians, publish periodicals, and organize various kinds of lectures and exhibitions. Yet Rosenberg and the Munich leadership of the Fighting League felt somewhat marginalized by their colleagues in Thuringia, who had entered into a coalition government in 1930. This situation came about in the September 1930 elections, when the Nazis fared so well in the provincial elections that they earned a place in the state’s government. On a national level, the Nazis saw their percentage of the vote jump from 2.6 percent in 1928 to 18.3 percent, netting an additional 103 seats in the Reichstag. In the Thuringian provincial government, negotiations for cabinet posts resulted in the Nazis gaining hold of the Ministry of Interior, which gave them considerable influence over cultural matters. In both Thuringia in 1930 and the Reich government in 1933, Wilhelm Frick served as the Minister of the Interior. Although he seemed a rather dull and forgettable lawyer on the surface, Frick was a radical National Socialist. In Thuringia, he immediately transferred control of the state art academy in Weimar to Paul Schultze-Naumburg, a capable traditional architect and radical völkisch (or culturally conservative) activist. The Weimar art academy had formerly housed the Bauhaus before Walter Gropius 21\n\n“The Summer of Art” and Beyond\n\nmoved the school to Dessau in the neighboring province of Saxony-Anhalt in 1925. Frick and his cohorts sought to draw attention to their new cultural policies in Thuringia. Most notoriously, they focused on the iconic mural that Oskar Schlemmer had executed in 1923 at the Weimar facility. The now-famous wall painting climbed the central stairs in the workshop that Henry van de Velde had designed. Rendered in a kind of three-dimensional style and featuring man-machine imagery, Schlemmer’s Bauhaus murals captured the spirit of Weimar modernism. Paul Schultze-Naumburg and his Nazi associates arrived at the Bauhaus one day in October 1930 and destroyed the murals, pulling some parts down and plastering over other sections. Alfred Barr Jr., the founding director of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York, subsequently acquired a related work—a 1932 painting that served as an “homage” to the Bauhaus. Schlemmer’s painting of the Bauhaus staircase was purchased by architect Philip Johnson during the Third Reich and later donated to MoMA in 1942.2 The Nazis’ cultural policies in Thuringia in 1930 foreshadowed what transpired after 1937. Just as with the sensational Degenerate Art Exhibition, the Nazis tried their best to be incendiary, using provocative language in the 5 April 1930 decree “Against Negro Culture—For Our German Heritage.”3 Frick and his aides also purged the Schlossmuseum in Weimar of some seventy works by Otto Dix, Wassily Kandinsky, and Emil Nolde, among other modernists. The rationale was that these works had “nothing in common with Nordic-German essence, but rather limited themselves to depicting Jewish, Slavic, or otherwise inferior sub-humanity.”4 “‘The battle for art’ was,” as art historian Berthold Hinz has noted, “by no means a National Socialist invention. The slogan and the issue [of a “German” art] had been of central concern in German cultural life for decades.”5 Modernism had elicited strong opposition prior to World War I, with nationalistic and even racist arguments wielded as weapons. Yet starting in Thuringia, the Nazis took this battle to a new level, purging museums, closing schools, and censoring books, among other initiatives. The Thuringian Nazis and their Fighting League allies would also disrupt concerts of atonal and other modern music. This training ground produced many of the key spokesmen for the National Socialists in the cultural sphere: joining Schultze-Naumburg were Adolf Bartels, Hans F. K. Günther, Richard Walther Darré, and Hans Severus Ziegler, among others. They became standouts in the völkisch faction, waging a relentless campaign against the pro-modernists. The Thuringian Nazis enjoyed a generally positive popular response to their anti-modernist agitation, and intensified their harassment of oppo22\n\nThe Fight over Modernism\n\nnents. Yet they also faced resistance. For example, the purging of modernist art from the Schlossmuseum in Weimar resulted in challenges that they had exceeded their legal authority. The Thuringian parliament issued a vote of no-confidence, citing Frick’s action in the Schlossmuseum as part of his excesses. Frick was subsequently forced to resign his position as minister in April 1931.6 But again, despite such setbacks, the Nazis’ policies in Thuringia met with widespread public support. In the July 1932 elections, the National Socialist German Workers Party (Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiter Partei [NSDAP]) received 42.5 percent of the vote in Thuringia (as compared to 37 percent nationwide). This resulted in Nazi Gauleiter Fritz Sauckel leading a coalition government—meaning that Thuringia fell under Nazi rule even before Hitler’s appointment as chancellor in January 1933. The stridently anti-modernist policies in Thuringia appeared to have considerable popular support. The völkisch faction, of course, extended far beyond the Fighting League. One umbrella organization for smaller societies, the Führer’s Council for German Art and Cultural Organizations, had 250,000 members in 1933. The völkisch camp had genuine grassroots support, and many of those in these pressure groups were not hesitant to assert themselves as activists. Historian Hildegard Brenner suggests that many members were “motivated largely by resentment.”7 One such example would be Bettina FeistelRohmeder, an unsuccessful Dresden-based artist who published several journals, including Deutsche Bildkunst and Deutscher Kunstbericht. FeistelRohmeder was an activist who devoted most of her energy to attacking art and artists whom she did not like. While she had no standing in the Nazi Party—even the Nazi leaders found her unpleasant—Feistel-Rohmeder’s periodicals had relatively large circulations and served as a platform for her allies, especially before 1933 (Deutsche Bildkunst had some three thousand subscribers).8 With the advent of the Third Reich, Feistel-Rohmeder and her supporters allied themselves with Alfred Rosenberg and tried to induce Hitler to appoint him the Minister of Culture. Although mocked by rivals as “almost Rosenberg” because he was almost a philosopher, almost an artist, and almost a foreign policy expert, Rosenberg remained a force with which to reckon. Serving as editor of Der Völkische Beobachter in itself would serve as a solid power base until Nazi Party and state positions came his way during the Third Reich. Rosenberg had his own foreign policy office within the Party and would later oversee the largest Nazi looting operations in World War II (a Party post called the Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg, or ERR); he also served during the war 23\n\n“The Summer of Art” and Beyond\n\nas Reich Minister for the Occupied Eastern Territories (a state post). But his first official appointment in the cultural sphere did not come until January 1934, when Hitler appointed him to a Party office for ideological supervision (the title was so prolix that it was known by the acronym DBFU).9 Rosenberg’s unofficial status in 1933 was one reason for the modernists’ optimism. While Rosenberg was left out of Hitler’s initial cabinet, at least his old friend and ideological ally Wilhelm Frick held a post—and a key one at that, as Reich Minister of the Interior. Of course, this gave the Nazis control over the police, but the Ministry of the Interior also had jurisdiction in the cultural sphere. As Frick had shown when he was the Minister of the Interior in Thuringia, the post afforded almost limitless possibilities. After his appointment as Reich Minister, Frick returned to the Thuringian model by engaging Paul Schultze-Naumburg as his adviser on artistic issues. The architect, who had been made a Nazi Reichstag deputy in 1932, appeared to be a rising star. Schultze-Naumburg met with Hitler and briefed him on a range of issues, including the presence of modern art in museums. Therefore, through mid-1933, most members of the völkisch groups, although cognizant of their organizational disunity, believed that they were destined to prevail, especially with Frick in office in the Reich Interior Ministry. Because the völkisch faction had gained so much momentum in early 1933, many in this camp were shocked and mystified by Goebbels’s appointment as Reich Minister for People’s Enlightenment and Propaganda on 13 March 1933. Of course, no one knew what this newly fabricated and curiously titled ministry meant at that point (that it came into existence due to a decree from President Hindenburg further confused matters). Perhaps Goebbels and Rosenberg had a better understanding of the appointment: that it entailed a major victory for Goebbels. But Rosenberg did not succumb and, true to form, redoubled his efforts to challenge his rival. Both the principals believed that the debate over modernism was the key to resolving the competition. Hildegard Brenner noted, “Art policy became a factor in the struggle for power. . . . In this conflict the political interest groups were mobilized above all by one question, which led to a bitter confrontation. This was the question of modernism, particularly in the fine arts.”10 Hitler therefore kept his subordinates Goebbels and Rosenberg balanced in a state of tense opposition, as was common in the Third Reich, believing in the “divide and rule” philosophy, and also the Social Darwinian notion of struggle determining who was most fit. With the subleader rivalry as a backdrop, and the Reichstag turned into 24\n\nThe Fight over Modernism\n\na rubber-stamp body by way of the 23 March 1933 Enabling Act, the Nazi government took another aggressive step against many modernists with the landmark 7 April 1933 Law for the Protection of a Professional Civil Service. This statute gave the government the power to cashier any employee of the state, and was meant to target those who were left-wing or Jewish. Yet it also led to the firing of many modernists. Among the notable figures who lost their teaching posts in the initial round of purges in the spring of 1933 were Max Beckmann (Frankfurt), Willi Baumeister (Frankfurt), Otto Dix (Dresden), Karl Hofer (Berlin), Paul Klee (Düsseldorf), Käthe Kollwitz (Berlin), and Oskar Schlemmer (Stuttgart); as well as a number of professors of architecture, including Hans Poelzig (Berlin) and Bruno Taut (Berlin). One could add some thirty museum directors, including Gustav Hartlaub from Mannheim, who coined the term Neue Sachlichkeit in 1925; Max Sauerlandt, the influential director of the Museum for Arts and Crafts in Hamburg who then died shortly thereafter; Ernst Gosebruch, who had taken over the Folkwang Museum from its founder, Karl Ernst Osthaus, and helped turn it into a world-class public institution in Essen; and Ludwig Justi, who co-founded the Berlin Nationalgalerie in the Kronprinzenpalais after World War I when the Hohenzollern palace was turned into a museum. The purge also resulted in the dismissal of the Reichskunstwart Edwin Redslob, who was in charge of design throughout most of the Weimar Republic. From the state theater, those dismissed included Jewish impresario Max Reinhardt. These were the people who had been most responsible for institutionalizing modernism during the Weimar Republic, transforming the “outsiders” to “insiders.” Similar events occurred in the musical sphere, with a purge of Jewish and also modernist artists from their posts. By late 1934, “49 out of 85 opera houses had experienced a change of intendant, a considerable turnover of personnel.”11 The transformation of the musical sphere included the departure of Jewish conductors Otto Klemperer and Bruno Walter, as well as Jewish composers Arnold Schoenberg and Hanns Eisler. Schoenberg was forced to resign his professorship at the Prussian Academy in Berlin—“the Nazis viewed his expulsion as a precondition for musical reconstruction along völkisch lines.”12 All of these figures, and many others, emigrated, an avenue that appeared distinctly more open for musicians than those in any other field due to the nature of the profession (including less of a reliance on a native language). Of course, a number of non-Jewish musicians joined the exodus from Nazi Germany, including conductors Hermann Scherchen, Fritz Busch, and the latter’s brother, violinist-composer Adolf Busch. That 25\n\n“The Summer of Art” and Beyond\n\nsaid, most serious musicians remained in Germany, even if they more often ended up playing the compositions of officially approved composers such as Werner Egk, Hans Pfitzner, and Gottfried Müller, rather than Alban Berg, Ernst Krenek, or Kurt Weill. Being sacked from a state position did not preclude joining the Reich Chamber of Culture. Many modernists availed themselves of this possibility of joining one of the seven arts-specific chambers, knowing that it was necessary in order to work. Thus, one finds today in various archives the Reich Chamber of Culture identity cards for a range of figures, from Otto Dix to Walter Gropius.13 Even certain Jews were admitted to the Chamber—at least from the autumn of 1933 until it was purged in 1935–36. In 1935, there were 1,328 Jews expelled from the Reich Chamber for the Visual Arts alone, which gives a good indication of the numbers.14 The Nazi authorities made exceptions beyond this point, such as the Devisenjude, or Jews who brought in foreign currency. Famed art dealer Curt Valentin, for example, received authorization to sell art abroad from the Reich Chamber for the Visual Arts in November 1936, but this was unusual. German Jews were then expected to join the Jüdischer Kulturbund, where, in principle, they could practice their art.15 This distinct Jewish cultural sphere also offered a space for modernism—for a limited time— that yielded some surprising results: for example, the memorial exhibition of the work of painter Max Liebermann that took place in 1936—a year after his death—in the Berlin Jewish Museum.16 A number of his works rendered in Impressionist and Post-Impressionist styles were included in the show. The forces of aesthetic open-mindedness, or the pro-modernists, were certainly aware of the consequences of the 7 April 1933 law, yet many found ways to rally. Musician Wilhelm Furtwängler led the way, writing Reich Propaganda Minister Goebbels about the regime’s future cultural policies. Goebbels responded and allowed the exchange to be published in the national press on 11 April 1933. Furtwängler, the conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic (among other posts) and one of the most revered artists in Germany at the time, maintained that he recognized only good and bad art—and contended that the dismissal of Jewish artists was justifiable only if they were bad artists. Goebbels offered vague assurances that “artists of real ability, whose work outside the field of art does not offend the elementary norms of state, politics, and society, will continue to find the future, as they have always in the past, the warmest encouragement and support.”17 Granted, the Bauhaus Berlin was raided and the school closed that very 26\n\nThe Fight over Modernism\n\nday (11 April). Yet this was the initiative of Reich Interior Minister Wilhelm Frick, with the backing of Prussian Minister President Göring. The fiefdom created by Goebbels in the cultural realm remained in its protean state, but his initial signals about freedom and his willingness to engage in dialogue emboldened the pro-modernists. The director of the Bauhaus in Berlin, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, responded to the institution’s closure by seeking out Alfred Rosenberg. On 12 April 1933—the day after the raid—they met at Rosenberg’s office in Berlin at 11 p.m. Rosenberg had also trained as an architect, and Mies hoped to have a serious discussion with him. Mies reportedly initiated the exchange by asking, “Where do you, as the cultural leader of the new Germany, stand on the aesthetic problems which have emerged as the result of technical and industrial development?” Rosenberg, who appeared unprepared for this kind of discussion, deflected the question, “Why do you ask?” He added, “Why do you want the backing of political power? We are not thinking of stifling individual initiative. . . . If you are so sure of what you are doing, your ideas will succeed anyway.”18 The two men talked past one another, but it seemed there was an element of mutual respect. Rosenberg terminated the meeting abruptly but reportedly said, “I will see what I can do for you.” Mies responded, “Don’t wait too long.”19\n\n27\n\n2 Otto Andreas Schreiber and the Pro-Expressionist Students\n\nA factory exhibition organized by Otto Andreas Schreiber, Hans Weidemann, and associates. Because one needed security clearance to visit most factories, they provided spaces for the pro-modernists to show controversial works. (Der Arbeiter und die bildenden Kunst [Berlin: NS-Gemeinschaft KdF, 1938])\n\nI\n\nthis unsettled environment that a group of Berlin university students, who led the local branch of the NSD-Studentenbund, made the decision to offer a more public defense of modernism. Theirs was a remarkable and important undertaking. The students, of course, were Nazis. Just because they were agitating for a more pluralistic cultural policy (which makes them sympathetic in certain ways), they remained anti-Semitic, hypernationalistic, and misogynist, among other less-than-attractive qualities. The NSDStudentenbund was formed in 1926 and initially had little to do with cultural policy.1 Although it served as an umbrella organization for Nazi student groups at the various universities in Berlin, the leaders eventually found a natural linkage between university affairs and cultural policy. Significantly, art students moved into leadership positions. Like their cohort in cities like Hamburg and Munich, the Berlin students gravitated to the debate about modernism. In a very real sense, they responded to the destructive policies of the Nazis in Thuringia after 1930. The Berlin students had no desire to have Paul Schultze-Naumburg or some other völkisch leader impose restrictions on them. They were open-minded in the sense that they saw multiple aesthetic styles as fitting into the new Reich, as compared with the more restrictive and monolithic aesthetic vision that characterized the völkisch camp. The leaders of the Berlin students’ group viewed the Fighting League members as provincial and regarded the völkisch art favored by Alfred Rosenberg and his allies as dull and reactionary. The students looked down on the anti-modernists, and many in the völkisch faction accused them (with good reason) of arrogance. As Elaine Hochman has noted, the members of the NSD-Studentenbund in Berlin “tended to be younger, better educated, and more accustomed to artistic experimentation than their [Fighting League] counterparts. German Expressionism had been part of their own formative aesthetic experiences, and many were unt was in\n\n29\n\n“The Summer of Art” and Beyond\n\nfamiliar with the longstanding Nazi antipathy for modernism, which had occurred mostly outside Berlin.”2 The German capital, of course, acted as a magnet for the more culturally “progressive” types, even during the Third Reich. It is no accident that former Bauhaus instructor Lyonel Feininger moved to Berlin in 1933. Even though his wife was part-Jewish (and he American-born), Feininger remained in Berlin until mid-1937, when he returned to the land of his birth to teach at Mills College in Oakland. But up until his emigration, Feininger, like so many others who hoped that modernism might find acceptance in Nazi Germany, believed that the metropolis would offer the greatest freedom for him to continue with his work. The pro-modernist campaign of the NSD-Studentenbund captivated the imagination of many Berlin students and faculty—especially those studying or teaching studio art and art history. The students knew that they were entering the fray, what with the pressure-cooker atmosphere of the first months of the Third Reich. All the dismissals from the universities and academies, not to mention the state of emergency that followed the Reichs­tag fire of 28 February, had created a highly charged atmosphere. Fritz Hippler, the leader of the Brandenburg section of the NSD-Studentenbund, hailed from the “left-wing” element of the Nazi Party: those with a more antibourgeois, anti-capitalist, and anti-establishment animus to their thinking. He had joined the NSDAP in 1925 at age seventeen.3 In 1932, Hippler had been dismissed from the University of Berlin as a result of his involvement in violent protests, but after the Nazi seizure of power he was reinstated by order of Reich Minister Bernhard Rust, who granted amnesties to all students sanctioned due to “national” demonstrations. Hippler continued to pursue violent methods, for example helping organize an aggressive rally outside the Berlin stock exchange in opposition to Hitler’s alliance with “reactionary” Alfred Hugenberg. The event turned disorderly and a number of windows were broken in the surrounding neighborhood.4 Historian Peter Paret has characterized Hippler as fairly unsophisticated and opportunistic, but he had been awarded a doctorate in philosophy at Heidelberg with a dissertation on Karl Marx, John Stuart Mill, and Paul Lagarde.5 Hippler was also a capable organizer. He is now best known as the producer of the 1940 pseudodocumentary The Eternal Jew, which counts among the most anti-Semitic works of the Third Reich, with the visual metaphor of Jews and rats and actual footage from ghettos in the newly formed General Government. One scholar described it as “a preview of coming atrocities, preparing the German populace for the ‘final solution.’”6 The Eternal Jew also featured modernist techniques, such the dissolves where “‘the 30\n\nSchreiber and the Pro-Expressionist Students\n\nEastern Jew, with his caftan, beard, and sideburns’ [is transformed in-]to the camouflaged and grinning ‘clean-shaven, Western European Jew.’”7 Hippler became a powerful cultural bureaucrat, serving as the head of the film department in the Reich Propaganda Ministry until a falling out with Goebbels in March 1943. That year also marked the discovery that he had a Jewish great-grandmother, which resulted in his expulsion from the SS (Schutzstaffel—Himmler’s elite corps that began as a protection staff).8 Hippler’s deputy, painter Otto Andreas Schreiber, had joined the NSDAP at age twenty-four in November 1931. He had been born in West Prussia, but his family was driven out in 1919 when the League of Nations determined that this territory would be the “Polish Corridor.”9 Schreiber was trained by Jesuits and had been a member of their New Germany Society, a Catholic youth group. Later, between 1927 and 1931, he studied philosophy at the University of Berlin, and painting at the State Art Academies in Breslau, Königsberg, and, again, in Berlin. Among his teachers were leading Expressionist painters Otto Mueller (who exhibited with both Die Brücke and Der Blaue Reiter) and Oskar Moll, with whom Schreiber studied in Breslau. Both encouraged the young artist to become part of the next generation of Expressionists. Schreiber gradually grew more committed to National Socialism in the early 1930s. He joined the storm troopers (SA) and assumed a leadership role in the NSD-Studentenbund—even though he had been appointed an Assistent (and was therefore a kind of faculty member) at the State Art School in Berlin-Schöneberg after passing his examinations in 1931. By 1933, he represented four Berlin art schools within the organization. Schreiber was a self-assured, aggressive Nazi who added to this reputation on 17 February 1933 when he led an uprising of Nazi students at one of the Berlin art schools. He compelled some of his Brown Shirt friends (members of the SA) to storm the school and evict several professors. They then proceeded to beat up those students who attempted to defend the targeted faculty. The assault occurred during the state exams, when nerves were already on edge; the disruption of the important tests only amplified the impact of the rampage. Peter Paret noted, “Schreiber represented a familiar type in the regime’s early stages: the university-­educated humanist, whose ready use of intimidation and even violence was motivated by intense ideological conviction but coexisted with a cultural idealism beyond the mental horizon of the Party’s rank and file bullies.”10 This incongruity found expression in a letter that Schreiber wrote in March 1933 to artist Otto Pankok. After describing the attack that he and other storm troopers had carried out at the Berlin Kunstschule, Schreiber concluded 31\n\n“The Summer of Art” and Beyond\n\nOtto Andreas Schreiber, a painter and leader of the pro-Expressionist National Socialist German Students’ League (NSDStudentenbund) in Berlin. ­Schreiber later organized factory exhibitions of modernist artworks. (Bundesarchiv-Berlin)\n\nthe letter by talking about his career as an artist, relaying news about three upcoming exhibitions and noting, “My painting, I think, goes forward.”11 The Berlin students were in contact with officials at the Propaganda Ministry, and several eventually found positions in Goebbels’s ministry. These pro-modernist student leaders were relatively capable individuals who went on to considerable success in both Nazi and postwar Germany. In short, they were not inept or without influence, and they had a reasonable chance of realizing their vision of more tolerant cultural policy. Another key figure in this younger cohort was Hans Weidemann, who although not a matriculated student in 1933 served as the main representative of Goebbels in the minister’s dealings with the Berlin students. Weidemann had joined the Nazi Party in 1927. His low Party membership number—below one hundred thousand—would be a significant asset in his career.12 He first served as the deputy to the Gauleiter of Essen, Josef Terboven, before moving on to work for the Berlin Gauleiter Goebbels in 1930. Both Gauleiters situated themselves in the left wing of the Nazi Party, although the latter was clearly more important as a mentor. Weidemann was a painter as well as a musician. He had spent four years studying at the Düsseldorf Art Academy and a year at the State Music School in Cologne. He had then worked as an “independent painter” until 1930. Weidemann had been trained in an 32\n\nSchreiber and the Pro-Expressionist Students\n\nHans Weidemann, another leader of the NSD-Studentenbund. He went on to work for Goebbels’s Reich Propaganda Ministry, where he promoted modernist art. Weidemann also became a member of the SS and is shown here in uniform. (Bundesarchiv-Berlin)\n\nExpressionist style and was described as “a young protégé of Nolde.”13 He was not without artistic talent. The Folkwang Museum in Essen acquired one of his works, and only his personal appeal to the director of the museum, Count Klaus von Baudissin, prevented its inclusion in the Degenerate Art Exhibition. Weidemann noted after the war that “Baudissin regarded it as a special favor to me.”14 Regardless, Hans Weidemann was far more important as a cultural bureaucrat. In March 1933, Goebbels made him a section chief in the newly minted Reich Propaganda Ministry, where he headed up Section II (simply titled “Propaganda”). Goebbels then selected him to be the liaison with Robert Ley, the head of the mammoth Nazi trade union known as the German Labor Front, which featured the Strength Through Joy leisure time organization. Weidemann in turn headed up the Culture Office of the Strength Through Joy initiative, although this proved short-lived due to conflict at the ministerial level. Yet Goebbels held Weidemann in high regard, and subsequently appointed him a vice president of the Reich Chamber for the Visual Arts, among other posts. While this also proved a shortlived assignment—Weidemann was sacked when he pushed for Nolde to become president of the Chamber—he retained his position on the Chamber’s Presidential Advisory Board until 1937, when the new President, Adolf Ziegler, appointed a new group of more stridently anti-modernist advisers.15 Weidemann henceforth ceased to be a force in the administration of 33\n\n“The Summer of Art” and Beyond\n\nthe visual arts, although his career took an interesting turn and he remained active in the cultural sphere more broadly. Weidemann, like his friend Hippler, turned to film and oversaw the newsreel division in the Reich Propaganda Ministry. Shortly after this appointment, in May 1938, Weidemann joined the SS.16 During the war, he personally went to the Eastern Front, where he filed reports for the Waffen-SS unit Kurt Eggers and for the SSTotenkopf (Death’s Head) Division. This was a kind of exile for the once prominent and well-connected cultural bureaucrat, yet he received positive reviews as an “exemplary SS-Man” and was promoted to the rank of SSSecond Lieutenant in early 1943.17 Weidemann experienced brutal frontline conditions in the Soviet Union, but he managed to survive. In a letter to former museum director Alois Schardt in 1949, he expressed remorse for his “political error” and blamed it on “a great measure of idealism and youthful inexperience.” But this was before he faced a denazification trial, and he was looking for witnesses who were not Nazis to vouch for him. In his appeal to Schardt, he claimed that “Barlach is dead [but], Nolde, Heckel and others have remained true to me.” Schardt, who had headed up the modern section of the Berlin Nationalgalerie in 1933, replied with a helpful letter and Weidemann went on to rehabilitate his career as a journalist, even working for the prominent magazine Stern from 1964 to 1970.18 In the spring and summer of 1933, Hippler, Schreiber, and Weidemann realized that they needed a wider range of allies in order to advance their pro-modernist agenda. More specifically, they sought to enlist members of the art world. To do so, they created an organization they called “The Ring of German Artists” and invited both high profile and relatively unknown artists to join. The motto of the “Ring” was “Against French Aesthetics— For a Nativist German Art.” More specifically, they built upon the ideas of prominent art historians Heinrich Wölfflin and Wilhelm Worringer, who posited a distinction between Germanic and Mediterranean cultures, and opposed Impressionism, which they viewed as French/Latin and hence superficial and insubstantial. Instead, they rallied on behalf of the spiritually deeper “Nordic Expressionism,” which in their minds communicated fundamentally German attributes. As Nazis, they phrased their ideas in terms of “the mythic powers of German blood” and talked of “the essential bond between the German people and the German artist, who served the race, and whose work expressed in spirit . . . Nordic Aryan values.”19 Anti-Semitism also permeated their thinking: Impressionism, for example, had been foisted upon the Germans by Jewish dealers. The leaders of the Weimar Republic (“the Jewish Republic,” in Schreiber’s words) had entered into this 34\n\nSchreiber and the Pro-Expressionist Students\n\nconspiracy on behalf of the Impressionists, and in the process “betrayed” Expressionist artists such as “Barlach, Nolde, Heckel, Schmidt-Rottluff, Marc, and Rohlfs.” Toward the end of one of his most important speeches Schreiber asserted, “Our blood instinctively rejects the Jewish people and its art.”20 Several art dealers emerged as key allies for the pro-modernist students. One was Ferdinand Möller, who had founded his first gallery in Breslau in 1917 and made it a point of pride—especially during the Third Reich—to stress that he focused on German artists. Möller wrote to one Nazi museum director, Count Baudissin, in mid-1936, In the years of the Weimar regime, not one of these artists gained advantages from the state or received a state position. Their work was only valued by a few museum directors and private collectors domestically and abroad, and was collected by a few patrons, but the Jewish art trade ignored them. When Flechtheim declared to me that he could not understand how I could make a living with this “German garbage,” well then you have an approximate idea of how the majority of the Jewish dealers opposed this art.21 Möller went on to say that one could criticize modernist artists on a variety of grounds—as part of the avant-garde they were accustomed to attacks—but “the accusation that they were Jewish, or that Jewish art dealers had intervened on their behalf, was not true.”22 While Möller was by no means a Nazi, he could find common cause with certain Nazi officials: he became a dealer of the purged “degenerate” art in part due to his relationship with Joachim and Annelies von Ribbentrop.23 It is therefore understandable that Schreiber and his allies turned to Möller once they had decided to organize an exhibition of German Expressionism. Alfred Rosenberg, as was his nature, did not sit by passively but rather mounted a counterattack in the summer and fall of 1933. He made a series of speeches and penned articles dated 6 July and 14 July 1933 that ran in his paper, the Völkischer Beobachter, where he criticized the pro-modernist element in the Party.24 He accused Schreiber of being “a cultural Otto Strasser” (a former Nazi leader in the left wing of the Party who was out of favor in 1933—and had fled the country, while his brother, Gregor Strasser, was later murdered in the Röhm purge of 1934). Rosenberg vilified these leaders of the “Black Front.” But he was onto something: the left wing of the NSDAP featured a disproportionate number of those in the Party who evinced a sympathy for modernism, as Schreiber, Weidemann, and Hippler 35\n\n“The Summer of Art” and Beyond\n\ndemonstrated. Perhaps it was the interest in socialism that translated into an internationalism with regard to art; more likely, it correlated to education level. There were myriad factors that made the left-wing Nazis gravitate to the pro-modernist camp. Because they constituted formidable opponents for Rosenberg, he did not completely dismiss their views. He also still hoped to occupy an official post in the Nazi cultural administration, and took pains to appear reasonable and judicious. It is in this light that we should understand his review of 7 July 1933 in the Völkischer Beobachter, in which Rosenberg praised Nolde’s seascapes as “strong and powerful,” yet lamented other works, which he “declared to be negroid, raw, without piety and inner strength of form.”25 Rosenberg could leave much of the dirty work to others. For example, he turned to an anti-modernist drawing teacher and journalist from Hamburg, Walter Hansen, to pen articles for the Völkischer Beobachter. Hansen labeled the 29 June rally “an effective blow against the art policy of the Führer and Rosenberg”; “a maneuver of falsification directed against national art and the racial principle”; and “an act of sabotage.”26 Hansen would later help instigate the Degenerate Art Exhibition, as he and Nazi artist/ideologue Wolfgang Willrich prepared a study of the “degenerate” works in the Berlin Nationalgalerie. Another article, authored by Hans Schemm, the Bavarian Minister of Education, and featured in the Nationalsozialistische Lehrzeitung (National Socialist Teachers’ Magazine), labeled the Thirty German Artists exhibition an “open attack on the sovereignty of the Party.”27 Otto Andreas Schreiber replied to Rosenberg’s first piece in the Völkischer Beobachter by sending a letter to the Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung that was published on 12 July 1933. While Schreiber affirmed his support for modernism and a more tolerant cultural policy, he also tried to reduce the escalating tensions by giving “his word of honor . . . that student youth . . . are not attacking his [Rosenberg’s] personal view of art.”28 Schreiber acknowledged that he had written the piece as an individual, not as a representative of the NSD-Studentenbund, an attempt to defuse the explosive situation. However, both sides were caught up in a pitched battle, and these minor concessions did little to help matters. The exchanges became so acrimonious that Bernhard Rust, the Reich Minister for Education, issued an order on 15 July prohibiting further discussion of these issues—­ especially in the press. Hans Hinkel, a State Commissioner who also worked for Goeb­bels, repeated this edict in an article published in the Völkischer Beobachter on 16–17 July 1933. Hinkel threatened that disciplinary actions would be taken against “all those who twist the words of sincere National 36\n\nSchreiber and the Pro-Expressionist Students\n\nSocialists and so attempt to bring division into the front of the true new German art.”29 Many observers had recognized that the debate over modernism threatened the unity of the Party, giving rise to divisions that could undermine the fledgling Nazi regime. Thirty German Artists opened the following week, on 22 July 1933. It actually featured the work of thirty-three artists. As noted above, both the elder and the younger generation of Expressionists were represented. Among the elders were August Macke, a member of Der Blaue Reiter who had fallen in World War I, and Karl Schmidt-Rottluff, who had designed the symbol of the German eagle for the fledgling Weimar Republic.30 The show received a number of positive critical responses in the local press, including strong praise for the younger artists, such as Schreiber and Weidemann, as critics found their work “refreshing” and “vividly filled with the desire for the new and contemporary.”31 Certain artists whose work was featured in the exhibition subsequently found official acceptance in Nazi Germany, including Georg Kolbe. But it was a provocative and risky undertaking for the organizers. Their decision to borrow two carvings by Ernst Barlach from his Jewish dealer, Alfred Flechtheim, for example, would have opened them up to even harsher attacks had this fact become public. Despite efforts on the part of Rust and others to minimize conflict over the show, the völkisch faction would not back off. They had been encouraged by the firing of Ludwig Justi from his post as director of the Berlin Nationalgalerie right after the 29 June rally. They now pressured Reich Interior Minister Frick to close the Thirty German Artists exhibition, and he complied. Three days after the opening, on 25 July, Frick sent uniformed police to enforce the decision; two SS men were subsequently placed at the entrance to the Möller Gallerie. The presence of SS men appeared to send a message of support from SS leader Heinrich Himmler and signaled this was a Nazi Party measure (as compared to a Reich or a state action). Members of the völkisch faction therefore believed they had the upper hand, and they were able to induce Party leaders to expel both Hippler and Schreiber from NSD-Studentenbund. Both students, however, were permitted to go on with their studies at the university. Yet this was not the end of the saga surrounding Thirty German Artists. A week later, on 2 August 1933, Reich Minister Frick and the National Socialist authorities allowed the show to reopen, but this time without the sponsorship of the NSD-Studentenbund. The modification was an attempt to render it an “ordinary” exhibition, although its previous history made this effort impossible. Institutional support mattered a great deal in the de37\n\n“The Summer of Art” and Beyond\n\nbate over modernism, and the separation from the powerful Berlin student association greatly undermined the pro-modernists’ initiative. This brought the matter of the Thirty German Artists show to a gradual close. Each side believed that it had advanced its cause, but neither could conclude it had prevailed. Members of both camps continued to agitate as best they could. In a 7 January 1934 article he wrote for the magazine Deutsche Zukunft; for example, museum director Max Sauerlandt referred back to the students’ support of modernism the previous summer: “To have made the first attempt to clear the way for these most authentic among artists of the recent past and to have set them apart from the mass of incompetents and charlatans will redound to the eternal credit of the National Socialist Students’ League and its leaders.”32 And so the debates and battles persisted. Otto Andreas Schreiber’s most significant accomplishments in his fight for modernism in the Third Reich were still to come. In November 1933 he launched a journal, called Kunst der Nation (Art of the Nation), that would become the most important venue for the pro-modernists. It had approximately 3,500 subscribers and could be purchased at newsstands for thirty Pfennigs. Goebbels not only sponsored Kunst der Nation but even contributed articles under his own name. Schreiber, who was the lead editor, took responsibility for its contents, and he was bold in his vision. For example, in a special Winterhilfswerk (Winter Relief) issue in 1934, he put a sculpture by Ernst Barlach on the cover.33 The article, written by Alfred Hentzen, a curator at the Berlin Nationalgalerie, praised Barlach as a German master (Hentzen would go on to be director of the Hamburger Kunsthalle from 1955 to 1969). Historian Hildegard Brenner noted, “This excellently written magazine was able to appear for almost two years. Although the butt of much hostility, the editors managed to come out openly and militantly for Expressionism without being prosecuted for opposition to the Party.”34 This would be the case until 1935, when Alfred Rosenberg and other völkisch Nazis took more careful aim at the magazine. To state that it was “excellently written” arguably heaps too much praise on this Nazi organ, which was, after all, a product of the Reich Propaganda Ministry. Some dubious premises surfaced within its pages, such as “Van Gogh als Deutscher,” whereby the Dutch artist, who lived in France during his most productive period, was claimed by the Nazis as one of their own (or closely related as a Niederdeutsch).35 Yet a series of distinguished figures penned pieces for Kunst der Nation, including art historian Werner Haftmann, a passionate champion of modern art who later directed the Berlin Nationalgalerie from 1967 to 1974, and Wilhelm Pinder, the es38\n\nSchreiber and the Pro-Expressionist Students\n\nOtto Andreas Schreiber, Double Portrait (1936): a work with pronounced Expressionist elements.

Dealer Ferdinand Möller also offered his support to the enterprise. Indeed, Schreiber had to deflect criticism that the periodical was “not published by true National Socialists, but the Galerie Ferdinand Möller.”36 This charge had been leveled by a drawing teacher named Jansen at a museum opening in Jena and provoked a passionate response from Schreiber. Kunst der Nation proved sufficiently important that Alfred Rosenberg contacted the Gestapo and demanded that the police agency close down the operation and confiscate all existing issues. The request was denied, but the periodical nonetheless folded in mid-February 1935 with the appearance of the last of its thirty-two editions. For sixteen months, however, Kunst der Nation provided Schreiber and his allies with an important platform. Besides serving as editor, Schreiber authored seven articles in which he articulated his vision reconciling modernism and National Socialism. His most important programmatic statement was a piece published in the first edition of Kunst der Nation, titled “Do We Young Artists Have a New Art Ideal?”37 Here he emphasized the national and racial components of art, rejecting, for example, an “inter39\n\n“The Summer of Art” and Beyond\n\nnational artistic impulse [Kunstwille],” which he saw as a “betrayal of our foundational principles.” That said, he also believed many diffe"
