        "text": "NEW LIGHT ON OLD STORIES ABOUT MARSHAL TUKHACHEVSKII: SOME DOCUMENTS RECONSIDERED*\n\nThe innocence of Marshal Tukhachevskii and the other military commanders condemned with him in 1937 has become firmly accepted by both Soviet and Western historians.[1] The current scholarly consensus also includes the view that \"the Nazi secret archives contain no sort of evidence of anything\" like a plot between the Soviet military and Germany, that \"not a lot of evidence has emerged from the German archives.\"[2] The present article re-examines some of the material bearing upon the Tukhachevskii case which has come to light so far from the captured German Foreign Office files, and concludes that it suggests a plot of some kind involving Tukhachevskii and the German High Command may, in fact, have existed.\n\nIn 1974 a newly-discovered document from these files was examined by British historian Frederick L. Carsten.[3] It is a report concerning high-level rumours current in Munich in early 1937, which ended up in the Vienna Bureau of the Austrian Chancellor. Among other matters it deals with relations between the German and Soviet military commanders, about which it makes four points: 1) It claims that the top men in the German General Staff, including Generaloberst Freiherr Werner von Fritsch, Chief of Staff of the German Army (Chef der Heeresleitung), were at that time involved in trying to form an alliance with the Soviet military. 2) It claims that Marshal Tukhachevskii had been present at the German army's autumn manoeuvres in the past year (den vorjährigen deutschen Herbstmanoevern). 3) At that time Tukhachevskii is said to have proposed a toast to the German Army \"as the champion (Vorkämpferin) against world Jewry,\" and to Göring. 4) It claims that the German military was closely following the \"power struggle presently taking place in Russia,\" in hopes that Stalin would be overthrown in favour of a military dictatorship.[4]\n\nCarsten denies the validity of the first three of these points on several grounds: 1) He claims that the last time any Russian officers attended German manoeuvres was the autumn of 1933. 2) Though admitting that Tukhachevskii congratulated General Ernst Köstring, German military attaché in Moscow, upon the German army's successful occupation of the Rhineland in March, 1936, Carsten avers that \"this is a far cry from being a declare antisemite and a sympathiser with the Nazi ideology. Even Karl Radek congratulated General Köstring on the same occasion in Moscow.\"[5] 3) For Carsten, the existence of this document is explained by the story that Reinhard Heydrich's Sicherheitsdienst (SD, the intelligence division of the SS) was busy fabricating a dossier of forged materials to incriminate Tukhachevskii and decapitate the Soviet military. No doubt, then, the SD would have been \"spreading this kind of 'news' about Tukhachevskii, his sympathies with Nazism and his allegedly intimate relationships with leading German officers.\"[6]\n\nThe present article uses an analysis of this report from the Austrian Bundeskanzleramt (BKA) as a framework within which other documents, including those from the German Foreign Office files which bear on the Tukhachevskii case, are reexamined. It examines each of the assertions (one through four) in the document, and each of Professor Carsten's objections (1 through 3).\n\nGeneral Ernst Köstring, former German military in attaché in Moscow, stated in memoirs published in 1965 that \"Autumn 1933 was the last instance of Russian officers participating (Teilnahme) in our manoeuvres.\"[7] Evidently Carsten has misinterpreted this passage, for Köstring says nothing to rule out Soviet attendance at, as opposed to participation in, German manoeuvres in later years. In letters to Paris at the time General Renondeau, French military attaché to Berlin, reported that Soviet officers attended German army manoeuvres in both 1936 and 1937.[8] Apparently either Komkor (corps commander) Orlov (according to Renondeau) or Komandarm (army commander) Uborevich (as Walter Görlitz has it) were present at German manoeuvres in autumn 1936.[9] Tukhachevskii, Uborevich, and Orlov were closely associated with the Soviet military cooperation with Germany under the Treaty of Rapallo. This association might account for the rumour, reported in the Austrian BKA document, that it was Tukhachevskii who had attended the 1936 German manoeuvres (point one)–particularly since the marshal had visited Berlin at least once in 1936.[10] Thus the rumour is perhaps not very wide off the mark.\n\nCarsten would have it (2) that it is hard to believe Tukhachevskii could have made such a pro-Nazi and antisemitic toast as the document recounts. In fact, the opposite is true: such a statement would have been entirely consistent with what was widely reputed to be Tukhachevskii's attitude.\n\nIn 1928 a former French officer published a short biography of Tukhachevskii. \"Pierre Fervacque\"–nom de plume of the French journalist Remy Roure–had been Tukhachevskii's fellow prisoner-of-war in 1917 in the German officers' camp at Ingolstadt, Bavaria. In his biographical sketch he set down the contents of several conversations he had with the young Russian lieutenant during their captivity, among them the following:\n\n--You are an anti-semite, then, I said to him. Why?\n\n--The Jews brought us Christianity. That's reason enough to hate them. But then they are a low race. I don't even speak of the dangers they create in my country. You cannot understand that, you French, for your equality is a dogma. The Jew is a dog, son of a dog, which spreads his fleas in every land. It is he who has done the most to inoculate us with the plague of civilisation, and who would like to give us his morality also, the morality of money, of capital.\n\n--You are now a socialist, then?\n\n--You socialist? Not at all! What a need you have for classifying! Besides the great socialists are Jews and socialist doctrine is a branch of universal Christianity.... No, I detest socialists, Jews, and Christians.[11]\n\nTukhachevskii never protested the contents of this well-known book. On the contrary, until shortly before his execution Tukhachevskii maintained friendly relations with Roure. He spoke with the French journalist at a banquet in Paris in 1936, and then three days later held another, private, conversation with him. Roure recalled in July 1937 that, in his book, he had portrayed the young Tukhachevskii as expressing horror and disgust for Western civilisation and a juvenile love of \"barbarism\" in hair-raising tones (which we note, could have come from the most radical Nazis). Twenty years later Tukhachevskii had mellowed, had become an admirer of French culture, but remained a \"patriotic\" pan-slavic nationalist and imperialist who felt that, by serving Bolshevism, he had served his country.[12] We have examined and rejected Carsten's first two objections to the Austrian BKA report, and in so doing have determined that the second and third points made in that report accord well with facts attested elsewhere. We turn now to points four and one of the Austrian document. The fourth point is the claim that the German military was watching the \"power struggle\" (meaning the Moscow Trials) in the USSR in hopes that a military dictatorship might replace Stalin. In December 1936 the Soviet government assigned David Kandelaki, head of the Soviet Trade Delegation to Germany, the task of \"feeling out\" the German government concerning the possibility of opening secret talks. By early 1937 Hitler had turned the USSR down,[13] as is illustrated in an interesting document, noted by Erickson, from the German Foreign Office files whose significance for the Tukhachevskii Affair has not yet been appreciated. This is a letter to Dr. Hjalmar Schacht (head of the Reichsbank and the person whom Kandelaki had approached concerning the Soviet Government's desire for formal secret talks) from the German Foreign Minister, Baron Constantine von Neurath.[14] In this letter Neurath summarises Hitler's view, with which Neurath also declares his agreement. This is expressed as follows:\n\nAs concerning the eventual acceptance of talks with the Russian government, I am, in agreement with the Fuehrer, of the view that they could not lead to any result at this time, would rather be made great use of by the Russians to achieve the goal they seek of a closer military alliance with France and, if possible, to achieve as well a further rapprochement with England. A declaration by the Russian government that it dissociates itself from the Comintern agitation, after the experience with these declarations in England and France, would be of no practical use whatever and therefore be unsatisfactory.\n\nNeurath adds an interesting qualification: \"It would be another thing if matters in Russia should develop in the direction of an absolute despotism propped up by the military. In this event we should not let the opportunity to pass us by to involve ourselves in Russia again.\" The Neurath-Schacht letter is dated 11 February 1937, while the cover letter to the Austrian BKA document, on BKA stationery, is dated four days later, and the report itself deals with the previous month. Thus the letter proves that the rumour set down in the report does, in fact, reflect the real views of the Nazi hierarchy at precisely the time it claims: in other words, the Neurath-Schacht letter strikingly verifies point four of the Austrian BKA report.\n\nIn early 1937 there were two leading military figures in the Soviet Union: Tukhachevskii and the Commissar for Defence, Marshal Kliment Voroshilov. It was well known that tensions within the top leadership of the Soviet military were profound.[15] Too much should not be made of an argument e silentio. But later in the same letter Neurath may be tacitly letting Schacht know which one of the two Soviet military leaders he means: \"In this connection I should also note, for your personal information, that, according to reliable information reaching us concerning the events in Russia, there is nothing to any split between Stalin and Voroshilov. So far as can be determined, this rumour, which is being spread by our press as well, originated in interested circles in Warsaw.\" Perhaps this passage suggests that, with Voroshilov still a staunch Stalinist, Germany would only be interested in talks with Russia in the event of a military dictatorship under Tukhachevskii.\n\nThere remains the first point in the Austrian BKA report, the supposed attempt by the German General Staff to form an alliance with the Soviet Army. To begin with, we note that Neurath was very close to Fritsch and to General Blomberg, worked with them behind Hitler's back on several occasions, and was replaced as foreign minister by Ribbentrop on 4 February 1938, the same day that Fritsch and Blomberg resigned and dozens of other generals and officials were dismissed to be replaced by officers more compliant with Hitler's desire for war.[16] If Fritsch were in secret touch with Tukhachevskii, Neurath might well have been informed. But there is no other evidence of a Tukhachevskii-Fritsch connection.\n\nIn his famous book I Paid Hitler, Fritz Thyssen, the former German steel magnate, one of the immensely influential \"Schlotbarone\", the Ruhr heavy industry magnates, and an early member of the Nazi Party explicitly associated Tukhachevskii with Fritsch: \"Fritsch always advocated an alliance with Russia, though not with a Communist Russia. Attempts were made to establish relations between Fritsch and the Russian generalissimo, Tukhachevskii. The two had one point in common: each desired to overthrow the dictator in his own country.\"[17]\n\nThyssen was certainly in a positiont o know of the kind of secret liaisons he alleges here, and may have been in on it too, since by 1936 or 1937 he himself was deeply disillusioned with Hitler. Professor Erickson, who cites this passage but would clearly like to dismiss it, confidently states in the text of his book that \"not a single item of evidence has emerged to justify the charge of treasonable contact with the Germans.\" However, in a footnote on the same page he refers to the Thyssen passage quoted above, and adds the following remark: \"It is difficult to know where the support for this statement comes from, although there was a contemporary Polish newspaper report that a letter or note from Fritsch had been seized from Tukhachevskii.\"[18]\n\nThere is yet more evidence from the German Foreign Office files hinting at a link between Tukhachevskii and the German General Staff. This is the set of documents referred to on page 435 of Erickson's study, The Soviet High Command. These documents record the loan, between February and November 1937, of military court papers concerning Tukhachevskii when he was a prisoner-of-war in Germany during World War I (the court papers themselves are not extant). A study of the four loan request documents reveals that the Tukhachevskii files were requested from the Potsdam branch of the Heeresarchiv (army archives) by the Wehrmachtamt, Aus. (Ausland) VI, the seciton which dealt with foreigners. Wehrmachtamt requested it on behalf of the \"GZ.\" This is the abbreviation for Generalstab-Zentralstellung, the main headquarters of the German General Staff.[19] GZ was of course in Berlin, and was headed by General von Fritsch.\n\nIt is noteworthy that someone in Fritsch's Berlin HQ was apparently showing some considerable interest in Tukhachevskii at precisely the same time that: 1) the report to the Austrian BKA told of Fritsch's interest in an alliance with the Soviet military–a report backed up by Thyssen's testimony; and 2) both that report and Neurath speak of an interest in a military coup in the USSR.\n\nOur examination of the Austrian BKA report shows that, as regards German-Soviet military relations, it is highly consistent with other evidence available. Points one, three, and four are fully consistent with this other evdience, while point two may simply be due to a confusion (or may even be correct as well). We have also disposed of the first two of Professor Carsten's objections to it. However, there remains his third point; that the documents might have been related to the well-known German SD plot to forge a dossier incriminating Tukhachevskii as a traitor. The whole matter of this alleged forgery is very complex, and cannot be unravelled in this article. In addition, it is in principle impossible to prove a negative–in this case, that no German forgery attempt was made. One can merely examine the evidence cited to support the existence of such a forgery attempt and see how it holds up. This said, several considerations are relevant to the matter at hand.\n\nFirst, the crucial sources for the \"SD-NKVD forgery\" story are untrustworhty. In his introduction to the English edition of Walter Schellenberg's memories, Alan Bullock concludes: \"Nor would it be wise to accept Schellenberg as a trustworthy witness where his evidence cannot be corroborated.\" Erickson also points out several important passages of Schellenberg's which he recognises cannot be true.[20] The account by Alfried Naujocks, the SS man who claimed to have been personally responsible for organising the forgery and who is usually taken at his word, is even more patently false.[21]\n\nSecond, according to all the accounts of the \"forgery plot,\" Hitler and Himmler were both a party to it. But nothing of the kind could be inferred from their later references to the military purges. For example, Himmler is reported to have discussed the Tukhachevskii Affair in a conversation with the renegade Soviet General A. A. Vlasov on 16 September 1944, in a manner which makes it clear he believed Tukhachevskii had been guilty of some plotting: \"Himmler asked Vlasov about the Tukhachevskii Affair. Why this had gone awry. Vlasov gave a frank answer: 'Tukhachevsky made the same mistake that your people made on 20 July. He did not know the law of masses.'\"[22] In an important speech in Posen on 4 October 1943, Himmler stated:\n\nWhen–I believe it was in 1937 or 1938–the great show trials took place in Moscow, and the former czarist military cadet, later Bolshevik general, Tukhachevskii, and other generals were executed, all of us in Europe, including us in the [Nazi] Party and in the SS, were of the opinion that here the Bolshevik system and Stalin had committed one of their greatest mistakes. In making this judgement of the situation we greatly deceived ourselves. We can truthfully and confidently state that. I believe that Russia would never have lasted through these two years of war–and she is now in the third year of war–if she had retained the former czarist generals.[23]\n\nThis probably reflected Hitler's assessment as well, for, according to Goebbels (diary entry of 8 May 1943): \"The conference of the Reichsleiters and Gauleiters followed.... The Fuehrer recalled the case of Tukhachevski and expressed the opinion that we were entirely wrong then in believing that Stalin would ruin the Red Army by the way he handled it. The opposite was true: Stalin got rid of all opposition in the Red Army and thereby brought an end to defeatism.\"[24]\n\nFinally, the German forgery–if indeed there was one–does not exclude the existence of a real military plot. In fact, all of the German SD sources for the forgery leave open the possibility that the marshal was in fact plotting with the German General Staff.[25]\n\nThus the story of the \"SD-NKVD forgery\" is very problematic. Based purely on hearsay, it abounds in contradictions and outright lies. If it were nonetheless consistent with the other evidence concerning the Tukhachevskii Affair, it might merit consideration despite it all. But the opposite is true.\n\nThe only pre-war account of any plot to frame Tukhachevskii is that of Walter Krivitsky, which concludes that the NKVD possessed its own evidence against Tukhachevskii quite independent of any forged dossier.[26] This coincides with the opinion of Heinz Höhne, the most recent student of the forgery plot from the German and SD side.[27]\n\nImportant testimony asserting the existence of a real conspiracy including Tukhachevskii and other military leaders comes from Nikolai N. Likachyov, better known as Andrei V. Svetlanin. A lecturer in Russian at Cambridge, then journalist and finally editor (1955-65) of the émigré Russian journal Posev, Svetlanin claimed second-hand knowledge of the conspiracy as a member, during the mid-1930s, of the staff of the Far Eastern Army (later the Red Banner Far Eastern Front) commande by Marshal Bliukher.\n\nIn this account, the military and party leaders executed during 1937 as part of the \"Tukhachevskii Affair\" were in fact part of a wider conspiracy, the central figure in which was Yan Gamarnik.[28] Chief of the Political Directorate of the Army, Gamarnik had probably begun the plot, together with Tukhachevskii, as early as 1932. By the time of the Seventeenth Party Congress in 1934, it was well-developed. The plotters, motivated by the disastrous consequences of collectivisation, were said to have considered two distinct plans. Plan \"A\", originating with Tukhachevskii and the young commanders around him, centred on a coup in the Kremlin, to be supported by party and military leaders in some of the provinces. Plan \"B\", envisaging independent revolts in different border areas of the USSR, originated with Gamarnik and the state and party officials in the plot, and was the version finally approved by the conspiratorial centre. The Far Eastern Region was to have been the site of the initial revolt.\n\nSvetlanin never claims to have been a part of the conspiracy himself which, he insists, was limited to men of the highest rank. Apparently no one of his acquaintance in the Far Eastern Army believed the Tukhachevskii Affair to have been a frame-up against innocent men. His story can be partially checked from independent sources, the main one of which is the account by Genrikh S. Liushkov given to the Japanese interrogators after his defection to them in June 1938 (Liushkov, head of the Far Eastern Region NKVD, had been sent there to help the 1938 purge). Liushkov disclosed to the Japanese the existence of a plot in the Far East, and his account of the plot confirms Svetlanin's in several minor respects.[29]\n\nCuriously, none of the post-1956 Soviet accounts have revealed any information other than that which was already available in the West, and draw principally upon the German SD accounts of the forged dossier. Even the Western sources used by Nikulin, the \"official\" Khrushchev-era biographer of Tukhachevskii, are carefully pruned of evidence they contain that suggests some real conspiracy in fact occurred. There is, strictly speaking, no Soviet post-Stalin historical account of the Tukhachevskii Affair at all, since Nikulin's work, upon which all others rely, is filled out with dramatic dialogue and frankly termed fictionalised (povestvovanie).[30]\n\nTaken singly, none of these bits of evidence is very significant in itself. But when considered as a whole, they constitute at least a prima facie case that some real military conspiracy involving Tukhachevskii may have actually existed. Nor is it difficult to understand why Khrushchev might have wanted to rehabilitate real conspirators. Khrushchev used the rehabilitations of the Tukhachevskii group as a stick with which to beat Stalin and, more importantly, remaining \"Stalinists\" in high places–that is, in order to hold power and support certain policy decisions. The Soviet military elite regards Marshal Tukhachevskii and those associated with him as the fathers of the contemporary Soviet armed forces.[31] To accuse Stalin of having wrongly killed them was at once to make of the military a firm ally and to blacken any policies associated with Stalin's name.\n\nIn conclusion, each of the points concerning Tukhachevskii mentioned in the Austrian BKA document is consistent with other, independent evidence. The \"German SD forgery plot\" story, and the Khrushchev-era version of the Tukhachevskii Affair, have been recorded a degree of scholarly acceptance that is not justified by the contradictions and inconsistencies which abound in them. Any new study should examine them far more sceptically than has hitherto been the case. The present scholarly consensus notwithstanding, there is little about the Tukhachevskii Affair, including the very basic matter of Tukhachevskii's guilt or innocence, about which we can be certain."
