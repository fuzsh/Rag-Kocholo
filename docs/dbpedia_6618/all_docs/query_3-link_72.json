The museum uses discourses of victimhood and survivors’ testimonies of the Gulag or the Communist secret police. Yet, the museum that also tries to represent the Holocaust (to a certain extent) fails to find a space for Jewish voices since it would mitigate and undermine the generalization of Hungarians as victims. Although both non-Jewish Hungarians and Jewish Hungarians suffered under those regimes, the specificities of both periods are erased and relativized.\n\n[47]\n\nLaCapra, History and Memory after Auschwitz, 50.\n\n[48]\n\nIbid.\n\n[49]\n\nIbid.\n\n[50]\n\nCsősz and Gellért, “Holocaust Research and Infrastructure in Hungary,” 150.\n\n[51]\n\nÉ.

I must thank historian László Karsai who guided me through the museum. A room presents several pictures of victims of the Nazi and Communist rule in Hungary. Closer attention allowed us to see names such as Remenyi-Schneller Lajos—Minister of Economy from the Pál Teleki cabinet (that proposed and enacted far-reaching anti-Jewish laws), who regularly informed the Germans about the Hungarian political developments and who was hanged in 1946 in Budapest for war crimes and high treason. We also found Kun Andras—a Roman Catholic priest of the Franciscan Order who was the commander of an antisemitic death squad for the Arrow Cross Party—and Pálffy Fidél—a Hungarian nobleman who was a leading supporter of Nazism in Hungary and became an important contact for Wilhelm Höttl during his work on behalf of the SS in Budapest.

[…] they do not fight directly, but by stealth; they are not honorable, but unprincipled; they are not national, but international; they do not believe in work, but speculate with money; they have no homeland, but feel that the whole world is theirs. They are not generous, but vengeful, and always attack the heart—especially if it is red, white and green [Hungarian national colors].” Joshua Shanes. “Netanyahu, Orban, and the Resurgence of Antisemitism: lessons of the last Century,” Shofar: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Jewish Studies 37, 1 (Spring 2019): 112."
