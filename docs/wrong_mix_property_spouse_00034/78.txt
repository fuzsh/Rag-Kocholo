Actress Jill Halfpenny has split from her husband of four years and has a new boyfriend.

The actress revealed to the Daily Mail she recently separated from fellow actor Craig Conway, who she has a two-year-old son called Harvey with.

Since the split, the 35-year-old has found love with a mystery man who has not only captured her heart but changed her style.

The former EastEnders' actress said: 'I've downsized my whole wardrobe by about half, which was hugely cathartic.

'I have a new partner who is very complimentary of both my tomboy look and my glamorous look.'

Despite the split, Halfpenny and Conway - who are now living in separate houses in London - will be appearing in a film together, which is currently in production.

The actress is best known for her roles in the BBC soap and as a contestant on Strictly Come Dancing in 2004.

She recently finished a run in the west end musical Legally Blonde as the part of Paulette.

A source close to the former couple said: 'It all happened quite a while ago but they're definitely still friends.

'It's sad, but they get on together now much better than they did before,' they added.

It has been suggested that the pair's busy schedule is to blame for their relationship ending.
