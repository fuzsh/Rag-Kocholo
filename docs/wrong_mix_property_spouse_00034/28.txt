On 8 June 2008 we published an article which included the allegation that Craig Conway, husband of actress Jill Halfpenny, had failed to make any payments to the Child Support Agency for his daughter Bronwen.

In fact, Mr Conway has, since being contacted by the CSA in 2007, made the required payments for his daughter. The payments had not been received by Bronwen's mother, Debbie Jones, due to an administrative error by the CSA.

We are happy to set the record the straight and apologise to Craig Conway and to Jill Halfpenny for any distress our article may have caused.
