        "text": "Ant & Dec fans were gutted when the presenting duo announced earlier this year that Saturday Night Takeaway would be ‘taking a break’ next year. With that series rested (who knows how long for) it was assumed that the pair would be focusing on their other projects, such as I’m A Celebrity, Britain’s Got Talent and Limitless Win.\n\nOn Tuesday, July 4 it was announced that Ant & Dec would be producing a reboot of the series in which they first made a name for themselves. Yes, Byker Grove is returning to screens.\n\nThe upcoming series will have the new name Byker and is in development with Fulwell 73 and Mitre Studios. Are you excited for the show to return? Let us know in the comments.\n\nRead more: Stars from Coronation Street, EastEnders and Hollyoaks who've been in more than one of the big soap operas\n\nByker Grove debuted on our television screens back in November 1989 and was a mainstay and childhood favourite for those growing up until it was axed in December 2006. For 17 years, the show was notable for breaking boundaries such as screening the first ever gay kiss on a British children's show, along with hard-hitting topics such as child abuse, drug addiction and homelessness. Here we take a look at what's happened to the stars of Byker Grove...\n\nAnt McPartlin & Declan Donnelly\n\nOne of the lasting legacies of the show, of course, has been the two faces that seem to be always on our TV screens - the presenting super duo Ant & Dec. In Byker Grove, PJ was played by Ant, and Duncan by Dec.\n\nAlong the way, the duo pursued a glittering pop career, with three top 10 hits among more than a dozen chart singles between 1993 and 1997, and reached number 3 with We're On The Ball in 2002. The duo also branched out into presenting when they got their own show imaginatively titled The Ant & Dec Show. This was followed by a switch to ITV and saw them hosting SM:TV Live with Cat Deeley, primarily between 1998 and 2001, which gave us classic segments such as Challenge Ant, Eat My Goal, Wonky Donkey and the Friends-inspired Chums. The duo then presented Pop Idol for two series from 2001 until 2002.\n\nThe year 2002 was a big one for the duo when, in June, they started presenting their own primetime show - Ant & Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway. Also, in August of that year, they hosted the first series of I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! and continue to do so today, along with Britain's Got Talent - the duo are clearly doing something right.\n\nAlong the way, the duo saw more chart success when they finally hit the number 1 spot after a performance of Let's Get Ready To Rhumble on Saturday Night Takeaway in 2013 - almost 20 years after it reached number 9 on its initial release.\n\nThe personal lives of the duo have taken different paths over the years from Ant's divorce from his first wife Lisa Armstrong to his run-in with the law in 2018 after he pleaded guilty to drunk driving and subsequent rehab. He's now happily married to second wife Anne-Marie Corbett. Dec married Ali Astall in 2015 and they have two children together.\n\nJill Halfpenny\n\nJill Halfpenny played Nicola Dobson, one-third of the Dobson family who attended the youth club, and was a central part of the show in the early years.\n\nSince leaving the show in 1992, Jill has appeared in various roles - her most notable including as Rebecca Hopkins in Coronation Street, Kate Mitchell in EastEnders, Izzie Redpath in Waterloo Road, and she also won Strictly Come Dancing's second series in 2004 with professional dancer Darren Bennett. She has also appeared in In The Club, Humans, Dark Money and both The Drowning and The Holiday.\n\nHer personal life has also seen many ups and downs. In 2007, Jill married fellow actor Craig Conway, although the couple divorced in 2010 after having one child together in 2008.\n\nSince then, the actress has remained private about her love life but opened up about her grief in 2019 following the death of her partner Matt, who sadly passed away after suffering a heart attack at the gym in 2017.\n\nLyndyann Barrass\n\nWhile not a household name, one look at Lyndyann and you remember exactly who she played in the show. Yes, Lyndyann played the youth club stalwart Spuggie.\n\nSpuggie was in the series from the beginning until the sixth series and, while not seen on TV much since leaving the show, she has appeared on stage in local amateur productions of Annie Get Your Gun and High Society.\n\nIn 1999, the Sunderland-based star married husband Allan and had two kids with him before their split in 2012.\n\nShe told the Mirror in 2014: \"I'm a newly single parent with kids.
