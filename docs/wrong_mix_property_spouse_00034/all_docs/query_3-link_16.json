Is it because she isn‚Äôt wearing glasses?‚Äù. Nope, none of the above ! I am actually missing my front tooth (I know it‚Äôs barely noticeableüòâ!). As some of you may know, I sustained extensive facial and dental injuries in 2013 as a result of (one of) the times I was hit by a car while riding. I found out a couple of months ago that my body was rejecting my last jaw bone graft (done in 2017) and that I would need to have another maxillary bone graft and then a dental implant. I woke up from surgery last Thursday to find out that the bone loss was more extensive than they had thought and they were unable to place a new dental implant at this time due to the amount of new bone they needed to place. When I looked in the mirror (and for the following 5 hours) I balled my eyes out - I have upcoming commitments that require me to show up and all I wanted to do was hide. I allowed myself to feel those feelings and then I made a choice, the choice that I would keep showing up. I encourage my clients to bring their WHOLE selves to our coaching calls and I will continue to do the same- front tooth or not! Whistle while I work? Don‚Äôt mind if I do. Are you fully embracing who YOU are today? Keep showing up, no matter what circumstances you are going throughüòä\" Post by Emily Rodger, shared with permission ‚ù§Ô∏è"
