        "text": "***\n\nFun-loving, intelligent, sexy journalist and single mum… seeks companionship (ideally), love (possibly), sex (definitely maybe!); laughter (compulsory)…. with like-minded, clever, cute middle-aged single man (no ‘still-married-but-my-wife-doesn’t-get-me’s need apply) Ideally based in the SW…\n\nParenting journalist Anni is 46 and mum to teenage daughter, Cassie. It’s two years since her philandering first (and only) love Joel walked out taking the last of her self-confidence with him and she has remained resolutely single ever since. Her friends decide it’s high time she was back in the dating game; they set up a Tinder profile to encourage her to venture out of her slippers and into her Louboutains. But Anni is woefully unprepared for the virtual world of romance and trying to learn the protocols of social media might just be a Bitmoji too far…\n\n***\n\n***\n\nQ&A\n\nWhen and where do you prefer to write?\n\nAs a working mum, juggling two jobs and two teens, I write wherever and whenever I can. I like to write in bed in the early mornings, but I also love a coffee shop with writer pals, or sitting in the waiting room at gymnastics, or on a touchline at rugby. I can write in the car, whilst in a boring work meeting (sorry!) I write dialogue in my head while I’m running and have to race home to get it on the page.\n\nDo you need peace and quiet when you are wrting?\n\nSee above. Peace and quiet often seem so improbable that I’ve largely given up expecting either. I do put my headphones on and drown everything out with a bit of ‘One Direction’ or Tay-Tay!\n\nIf you had the chance to co-write a book. Whom would it be with?\n\nHelen Fielding (author of Bridget Jones) or perhaps Phoebe Waller Bridge.\n\nSay someone asks if they can use your name in a book. Would you rather be the ‘good one’ or the ‘bad one’?\n\nOMG, totally the bad one. I’ve spent my life being the good girl, the one who handed her homework in on time and got straight As and gold stars and Blue Peter Badgers. It’s turned me into an adult who is a tortured people-pleaser who can’t say no. So I should love to vicariously experience the rush of out and out dastardly villainy! Who knows what it might bring out in in me!\n\nWho would you like/have liked to interview?\n\nI was lucky enough to meet Nelson Mandela many years ago. We had a little dance and I wish I’d asked more questions. Nowadays I’d like to interview Taylor Swift. Love that girl and I think there would be so much juicy goss to spill.\n\nWhere can I find you when you are reading?\n\nIdeally, I am in bed with a nice scented candle and my heated blanket. But I do take my Kindle everywhere with me cos when I am engrossed in a book I cannot put it down. I read whilst walking along the street, in the bath, I’ll switch between Kindle and Audible if I’m driving or running. When I’m hooked on a book, I’m hooked!\n\nWhere can I find you wen you are not writing/reading?\n\nHopefully in a coffee shop having brunch or in a cocktail bar sipping Porn Star Martinis with my gals! But possibly doing the ironing!\n\nWhat goes through your mind when you hold your new book in your hands for the first time?\n\n‘Oh god – what if people hate it!’ And with this one, ‘Oh god, I’m a teacher and I’ve written a Rom-Com. That’s OK – right? There’s no smut, but still …’\n\nHow do you come up with a title for your book?\n\nI very rarely do! I am obviously rubbish at titles because the ones I come up with are routinely (but politely!) rejected by publishers in favour of much cleverer ones!\n\nHow do you pick a cover for your book?\n\nI don’t usually get much say with covers but for this one I was very clear the aesthetic I was going for: the cartoon ‘Tik-Tok Made me Buy It!’ vibe of books like ‘The Love Hypothesis’, ‘The Spanish Love Deception’, ‘The Kiss Quotient’ anything by Tessa Bailey or Beth O’Leary. What the brilliant designer Nikki East and the team at Spellbound came up with made me laugh out loud and grin from ear to ear! It’s funky, funny, sassy and cool! I love it!\n\nThank you, Cqtherine Bruton and Zooloo’s Book Tours\n\n***\n\nAbout the author\n\nCatherine Bruton studied English Literature at Oxford and has been juggling life as an award-winning children’s author, teacher and mum ever since. Her novels for young people, including the multi-award winning ‘No Ballet Shoes in Syria’ have earned national and international acclaim, but it turns out that writing for and teaching young people are far easier than raising them! Her debut rom-com novel was written during Lockdown and is a tribute to the trials and tribulations of parenthood and dating in the digital era, the amazing mum friends you meet along the way and the joy of raising teens! She lives in a village outside Bath with her husband and two children, who are the best thing that ever happened to her.\n\n***\n\nAuthor Links\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/catherineabruton/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/catherinebruton\n\nWebsite : http://www.catherinebruton.com/\n\n***\n\n***\n\nBook Links\n\nAmazon UK https://www.amazon.co.uk/Confessions-Helicopter-Mummy-TikTok-generation-ebook/dp/B09SBD7ZR4"
