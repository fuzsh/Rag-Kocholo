        "text": "Jill Halfpenny has admitted she finds her friends \"quite annoying\" when they're with their children.\n\nThe actor, 46, - who started her career on Byker Grove - is a parent herself, sharing son Harvey with her ex-husband Craig Conway, whom she was married to from 2007 to 2010.\n\nThe Strictly Come Dancing winner however has suggested that being a parent around your friends isn't much fun, with her instead preferring to see pals without their children.\n\nShe made the comment whilst promoting her new show, the Holiday, which sees a group of friends go on a vacation together with their families - though Jill isn't as keen.\n\nThe Waterloo Road alum opened up about her reservations to the Daily Mail, suggesting that friends aren't the same when they're having to be parents at the same time.\n\nShe commented: \"The thing is you're not hanging out with your mates. You're hanging out with your mates as parents.\"\n\nJill referred to that as a \"completely different ball game,\" with the former EastEnders actor adding that she doesn't \"really like\" her friends as parents.\n\nDiscussing her feelings about this further, she said: \"I find them quite annoying. And I'm sure they find me annoying.\"\n\nHer comments come ahead of the launch of her new series the Holiday, in which four families get together abroad, with a dark secret leading to a murder among the group.\n\nJill plays Kate in the show, who begins to suspect that her husband Sean - played by Killing Eve alum Owen McDonnell, 47 - is having an affair with one of her friends.\n\nThe thriller will air on Channel 5 over four consecutive nights, with the first episode set to be broadcast during the primetime slot on the channel later this evening.\n\nDo you enjoy reading about celebrities? Sign up for all the best celeb news from the Mirror here .\n\nOther cast members in the four-part series - based on a bestseller by author TM Logan - include Liv Mjönes, Siobhan Hewlett, Aidan McArdle, Andrew Macklin and Cat Simmons.\n\nThe Holiday starts tonight on Channel 5 at 9pm. It will continue each night this week, concluding on Friday at 9pm."
