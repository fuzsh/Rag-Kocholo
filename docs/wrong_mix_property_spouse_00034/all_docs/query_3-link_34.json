        "text": "Actress Jill Halfpenny is to star in the first stage adaptation of best-selling novel The Girl on the Train.\n\nThe former EastEnders star and Strictly Come Dancing winner will play Rachel, the troubled woman who watches other people's lives from her commuter train.\n\nPaula Hawkins' thriller has sold almost 20 million copies and was turned into a film starring Emily Blunt in 2016.\n\nThe stage premiere will take place at the West Yorkshire Playhouse in Leeds from 12 May. A UK tour is planned.\n\nHalfpenny is best-known for playing Kate Mitchell in EastEnders from 2002 to 2005, and for appearing in Waterloo Road, In the Club and Three Girls. She was the Strictly Come Dancing champion in 2004.\n\nOn stage, she won an Olivier Award in 2011 for her role in Legally Blonde, and played Roxie Hart in Chicago in the West End.\n\nHalfpenny said she was relishing the prospect of playing a character who is \"completely flawed\".\n\n\"What I love about the book is that every character has done something they think perhaps morally they shouldn't have done,\" she told BBC News.\n\n\"So no-one can stand up and say, 'I am completely innocent'. So I guess it's about embracing the flaws.\"\n\nActors sometimes have a tendency to want their characters to be liked, she said.\n\n\"And Rachel's not always likeable, and that's OK,\" she added.\n\n\"I think you want to try to convey to an audience that we're all flawed, we're all messed up, and if you don't think you are, then you're probably lying to yourself.\""
