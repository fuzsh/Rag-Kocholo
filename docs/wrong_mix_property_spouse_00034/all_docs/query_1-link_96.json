        "text": "With the new season of Strictly Come Dancing just around the corner, fans of the celebrity dance show will be chomping at the bit for its return to our screens. Strictly winners hold a special place in many people's hearts, having been decided by public vote.\n\nMany celebrity winners go on to have illustrious careers in TV, music, theatre, news reading, and more. In light of the upcoming season, we took a trip down memory lane to see where all the past winners are now.\n\nFrom family life to career success, here's a look at what past Strictly Winners are up to today and what they've done since leaving Strictly.\n\nRead more: Every Strictly Come Dancing 'curse', scandal and controversy over the years\n\nNatasha Kaplinsky - Series 1\n\nGoing all the way back to 2004 and the very first series of Strictly, the show's first winner was BBC news presenter Natasha Kaplinsky. The broadcast journalist returned to her role at the BBC and has gone on to new and exciting projects since then.\n\nIn 2006, Natasha became only the youngest woman to ever present the BBC's Ten O'Clock News. In 2008, she went on to relaunch Five News for Channel 5, before taking a break from work to have her daughter, Angelica.\n\nMoving to ITV in 2011, Natasha presented a number of moving documentary. She was also asked by then Prime Minister David Cameron to take on the role of Holocaust Commissioner in a project interviewing 112 survivors. For this work, she was awarded an OBE in 2017.\n\nShortly after this success, tragedy struck her family, when Natasha, her father, and her eight-year-old daughter were seriously hurt when their boat caught fire in Corfu. All three survived but were left with serious burn injuries.\n\nToday, Natasha serves as a celebrity ambassador for Save The Children and Barnado's. She's also returned to Strictly twice, in 2012 for a Christmas special and in 2018 for a tribute to Sir Bruce Forsyth.\n\nJill Halfpenny - Series 2\n\nSeries 2 winner Jill Halfpenny has enjoyed great acting success since winning the dancing competition in December 2004, starring in shows like Bodies, Waterloo Road, Murdoch Mysteries, and more.\n\nJill married fellow actor Craig Conway in 2007 and they had one child together before divorcing in 2010. Today, she works as a radio broadcaster for Radio 2, a role she's held since 2017.\n\nDarren Gough - Series 3\n\nCricketer Darren Gough won the third series of Strictly while partnered with Lilia Kopylova, despite never making it to the top of the Strictly leaderboard during the show's 12-week run. Much of his career success was in the 1990s, where he made his name as England's second-highest wicket-taker in one-day internationals with 235 wickets, and became England's ninth-most-successful wicket-taker ever.\n\nAlthough Darren retired in 2008 and went on to appear on shows like Question of Sport, he eventually returned to the sport in 2019 as a fast bowling consultant for the England cricket team for test matches against New Zealand. In December 2021, Gough was appointed the director of cricket for Yorkshire.\n\nMark Ramprakash - Series 4\n\nAs part of the first Strictly couple with Karen Hardy to achieve a score of 40, Mark Ramprakash won the show back in 2006. Another cricketer, Mark is one of only 25 players in the history of the sport to have scored 100 first-class centuries.\n\nSince leaving Strictly, Mark returned to the show to win once again in a special edition of Strictly Come Dancing for Sport Relief on March 14, 2008. He has enjoyed a successful career in cricket, going on to coach in his retirement from the game and serving as England's batting coach, being appointed in 2014.\n\nAlesha Dixon - Series 5\n\nAlesha Dixon is still very well-known to Strictly fans since winning 2007's Series 5, swapping the dancefloor for a judge's chair just two years after her success. She left Strictly Come Dancing in 2012 to be a judge on Britain's Got Talent and has since presented various dance-related TV shows, including Alesha's Street Dance Stars (2010), Your Face Sounds Familiar (2013), Text Santa (2014–2015), Dance Dance Dance (2017), The Greatest Dancer (2019–2020), and Comic Relief (2019–2022).\n\nShe also has a child, Azura Sienna, with former backing dancer Azuka Ononye. Alesha put her music career on hold to focus on motherhood, having continued to release regular albums alongside her TV jobs.\n\nTom Chambers - Series 6\n\nActor Tom Chambers joined Waterloo Road as headteacher Max Tyler shortly after winning Series 6 of Strictly. His dancing win was controversial at the win, as he scored the lowest of the three finalists with the judges in the live final but still won due to his popularity with the public.\n\nTom also returned to Strictly in 2015 as part of that year's Christmas special, dancing with Oti Mabuse.\n\nChris Hollins - Series 7\n\nAside from his Strictly success, Chris Hollins is best well-known for his role as BBC News Presenter and the face of Watchdog from 2010 to 2015. Today, he co-presents Secret Britain on the BBC alongside Ellie Harrison and Denise Lewis.\n\nKara Tointon - Series 8\n\nEastenders star Kara left Strictly in a glamourous romance, dating her dance partner Artem Chigvintsev for four years after leaving the show. After winning the show, Kara worked largely in theatre, going on to star as Maria in The Sound of Music in 2015.\n\nShe has two sons with partner Marius Jensen, born in 2018 and 2021 respectively.\n\nHarry Judd - Series 9\n\nMcFly drummer Harry Judd has returned to Strictly several times since his 2011 win, taking part in Sport Relief's version in 2012 and the 2015 Christmas Special. He's also appeared on celebrity versions of various UK shows, including The Chase and The Million Pound Drop Live.\n\nToday, he's enjoying life married to Brittany \"Izzy\" Johnston and with their three kids. Harry is still known to be in touch with fellow McFly bandmates and together they support various charitable causes, including the Brain Injury Rehabilitation Trust.\n\nLouis Smith - Series 10\n\nIn the same year as his Strictly win, Louis took home a bronze medal and two silver medals from the 2012 Olympics. Now retired from professional gymnastics, Louis has since stepped back into the public eye by performing on the Masked Singer in 2021.\n\nThis came after the Olympic gymnast faced some controversy in 2016 when a video leaked of him mocking the salah, the ritual prayer that is obligatory for Muslims to perform five times a day. Louis released a video at the time apologising for his comments.\n\nIn Louis' personal life, he announced he was expecting his first child with partner Charlie Bruce, a British jazz dancer back in September 2021. The due date was announced as late February 2021.\n\nAbbey Clancy - Series 11\n\nTV personality Abbey Clancy won Strictly alongside Aljaž Skorjanec. She went on to feature in various other TV shows following, including going back to her own roots as the new host for a revived series of Britain's Next Top Model in 2015, nine years after she began her own career on the show.\n\nThe 26-year-old now has four children with footballer husband Peter Crouch. The couple have been married since 2011.\n\nCaroline Flack - Series 12\n\nCaroline Flack went on to immediate success after her Strictly Win, presenting first The X-Factor and subsequently ITV dating show Love Island. She left Love Island in 2019 after assault allegations.\n\nTragically, in 2020, Caroline was found dead in her flat at the age of 40. Her death was later ruled as a suicide. The tragedy sparked a mental health movement, with social media users urging one another to 'Be Kind'.\n\nSeveral of Caroline's friends also participated in a charity fundraising event in her memory, called Climb for Caroline. It challenged participants to climb 24 peaks in the Lake District within a 24-hour period, with proceeds from the event were donated to mental health charity, the Samaritans.\n\nJay McGuiness - Series 13\n\nHaving first achieved stardom with boyband The Wanted, Jay has appeared on various celebrity TV shows since winning Strictly in 2015.
