        "text": "Jill Halfpenny has spoken candidly about her private struggle with alcoholism. The 48-year-old actor, who has been sober for more than a decade, revealed she previously found it difficult to manage her drinking as she dealt with the grief of losing her father at the tender age of four.\n\nIn her forthcoming memoir A Life Reimagined: My Journey of Hope in the Midst of Loss, she wrote: \"I began to see that I became a different person when I drank and I didn't always like who I became.\" She reflects in the book on how alcohol once seemed like an escape from her thoughts while paradoxically feeling it unlocked deeper parts of herself: \"For a long time, alcohol had helped me escape, to stop thinking. Conversely, I thought it also helped me access all the things that lay dormant inside me.\"\n\nDuring her recovery journey Jill recounts the impact of meeting another actor at an AA meeting who provided her with support. Describing the encounter she said: \"As I calmed myself down, I noticed a woman walking around, asking a few of the attendees if they would be happy to do a reading. She looked radiant, happy... 'I want what she has! ' I thought.\"\n\nRead more:Taylor Swift donated amazing gift to people in Cardiff who really needed it and didn't tell anyone\n\nRead more: Foo Fighters fans given weather warning as thousands head to huge Cardiff gig\n\nUpon recognising the woman as a fellow actor Jill said she felt a surge of emotion. \"I took a closer look and realised I recognised her. She was an actress. She looked at me and smiled warmly. I wanted to cry so bad.\"\n\nJill goes on to describe the profound experience of attending AA meetings. \"I experienced something I never have before people, strangers, sharing how they feel. No small talk or pretence, just real authentic feelings. They were talking about how their insides didn't match their outsides, how they struggled with feelings of unworthiness and for the first time in my life, I felt completely seen.\"\n\nThe memoir also touches upon the tragic loss of Jill's father Colin who died from a heart attack at 36 while playing football. Appearing on The One Show Jill also said she had found love again following the tragic loss of her partner Matt Janes in 2017 due to a fatal heart attack.\n\nAs she put it: \"When you lose a partner, a romantic relationship, it can sometimes feel slightly like a betrayal if you move on and it's not. You're absolutely allowed to be happy again. If you do the process and the healing and the work, you can go into another relationship and be happy again.\n\n\"If you haven't managed to do that work, there'll always be a part of you somewhere else. I feel I do deserve to be happy and I do feel happy and it's really nice to be in love again.\"\n\nJill spoke about what she wanted her son to learn from this, saying: \"When my partner died, I really wanted my son to know you can be in a lot of pain and have a lot of suffering but you can get through it.\"\n\nShe added: \"I think it's an important lesson for a child. Say to them: 'I will be okay. This will take some time but it will be okay.' I didn't want to hide it away from him. I wanted to be honest and say I'm struggling but I will be okay. I hope he's learned a lot from that.\""
