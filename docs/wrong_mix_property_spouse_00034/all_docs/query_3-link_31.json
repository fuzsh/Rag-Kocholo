        "text": "AS I get older, I appreciate mornings more.\n\nWhen I was younger and woke at 6am, I’d be really annoyed and think it was such a waste, but now I get excited about how much I can get done.\n\nI’ve worked out the exact time I need to get my son Harvey, 10, up and out for school, so we have an agreement that I don’t wake him any earlier, but he has to be like a robot and just get ready right away.\n\nMy body wouldn’t feel like mine if I didn’t exercise. It’s nothing to do with weight, it’s about strength and vitality.\n\nIf I’m not working, I’ll go to an hour-long class at 9.30am – anything from conditioning or spin to barre or yoga. The body needs to be kept flexible.\n\nI don’t want to be that old lady who breaks a hip when she falls over.\n\nAfterwards I eat breakfast. I might have yoghurt with fruit and honey or toast with scrambled egg, or I might wander to my local cafe and get pancakes.\n\nI don’t think any actor likes auditions. I don’t know how many job interviews the average person has in a lifetime, but actors have thousands.\n\nIf I have an audition coming up, I’ll learn lines and prepare the scene for a couple of hours after breakfast. I used to take rejection to heart and presume I wasn’t good enough, but now I know it could be that I’m the wrong height or have the wrong hair colour.\n\nIt takes a strong person to put themselves through that. If you don’t gain perspective, you can become bitter or anxious.\n\nAfter my lines, I’ll do life admin and have a snack like chia pudding or cheese on toast. Then I collect Harvey from school at 3pm.\n\nShopping for groceries is the most boring thing in the world.\n\nIf I were rich, I’d have a chef, but I’ve signed up to a food delivery company that sends ingredients and recipe cards for delicious meals.\n\nI like that everything is measured out and it makes me prepare dishes I wouldn’t normally dare to.\n\nYesterday we had chicken with harissa, barley, coriander, cherry tomatoes and green beans with figs.\n\nHarvey and I will sit down and watch RuPaul’s Drag Race – we’re addicted – then eat at around 6pm.\n\nI don’t have a night routine. Harvey goes to bed at 7.30pm and I might read or listen to an audiobook as I fall asleep.\n\nI love therapeutic books. I can’t learn enough about the brain and the way people are conditioned.\n\nAt the minute, I’m reading Dark Nights Of The Soul: A Guide To Finding Your Way Through Life’s Ordeals by Thomas Moore.\n\nI’m fascinated by what makes people tick.\n\nSome days I might have a theatre show in the evenings, so I won’t get home until 11pm.\n\nEither way I try not to go to sleep too late as I like getting up early."
