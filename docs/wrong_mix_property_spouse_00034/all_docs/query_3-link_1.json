        "text": "Channel 5 today announce brand-new domestic thriller, The Feud (6×60’), starring Jill Halfpenny and Rupert Penry-Jones. Produced by Lonesome Pine Productions, in association with Banijay Rights and North East Screen.\n\nThe Feud introduces Emma and John Barnett, played by Jill Halfpenny (The Cuckoo, The Long Shadow, Everything I Know About Love) and Rupert Penry-Jones (Spooks, Our House, The Drowning), who, along with their teenage daughter Beth, played by newcomer Megan Trower, appear to live an idyllic life on Shelbury Drive. They’re close friends with their neighbours, Sonia and Alan, played by Amy Nuttall (Downton Abbey, Chemistry of Death, Mr Bates vs The Post Office) and Ray Fearon (Fleabag, Barbie, Harry Potter), and despite their foibles, are also fond of older couple, Derek and Barbara, played by James Fleet (Unforgotten, Bridgerton, Vicar of Dibley) and Tessa Peake-Jones (Grantchester, Only Fools and Horses, Unforgotten).\n\nThe close friendships in this seemingly peaceful street prove to be not quite as harmonious as they seem. When Emma and John decide to add a kitchen extension to their house, things quickly start to spin drastically out of control. As objections to the plans are raised, unexpected skeletons and life-threatening secrets begin to rise to the surface. Laced with menace, The Feud reveals how Emma’s aspirational dream turns sharply into obsession, paranoia, and fear. One decision sets in motion events that have unforeseeable consequences for both her and the people living on her street.\n\nFurther cast include Jamie-Lee O’Donnell (Derry Girls, Screw, Unwelcome) as scorned police officer PC Gallagher, Larry Lamb (The Inheritance, Gavin and Stacey, EastEnders) as Emma’s wheeler-dealer father Terry, Alex Macqueen(The Inbetweeners, The Thick of It, Hijack) as oddball neighbour Nick, and Chris Gascoyne (Coronation Street, New Street Law, Moving On) as intimidating builder Lee. Judith Alexander (The Crown, Coronation Street, Walk Like a Panther), Joel Beckett (The Office, EastEnders, Casualty), and newcomers Luke Hammond and Joel Kai Ali round off The Feud’s cast.\n\nThe Feud has been ordered for Channel 5 by Paul Testar, Commissioning Editor, Drama, Channel 5.\n\nWritten and created by Aschlin Ditta (The Inheritance, The Catherine Tate Show, Doc Martin), the series will be directed by Andy de Emmony (Vigil, Lucky Man, The Nest) with Lesley Douglas producing for Lonesome Pine Productions. Aschlin Ditta and Andy de Emmony will also executive produce the series, with Banijay Rights onboard for international distribution and funding by North East Screen Industries Partnership delivered by North East Screen.\n\nOn filming The Feud, Jill Halfpenny comments: “The spiral that we see Emma’s world take in The Feud, from one seemingly innocent situation to life altering revelations, is something I can’t wait to dive into! Getting to work in the Northeast with the teams at Channel 5 and Lonesome Pine, along with the rest of this brilliant cast, is a joy.”\n\nOn adding the series to Channel 5’s critically acclaimed drama slate, Paul Testar says: “Neighbourly disputes happen every day. The Feud takes that premise and runs with it to its extreme limit. What starts as an innocuous renovation triggers an extraordinary sequence of events. We’re excited to work with the wonderful team at Lonesome Pine again to bring this great story and stellar cast to the Channel 5 audience.”\n\nDoes Emma know the people around her as well as she thinks? Who is hiding behind facades, who is manipulating events, and who is simply exactly who they appear to be? A drama full of paranoia, The Feud has started filming in Newcastle and is set to air on Channel 5 in 2025."
