        "text": "The actress went on to say her partner’s death felt like a “double loss” as it was similar to the circumstances of her father’s in 1979.\n\nThe latter died after suffering a heart attack in the middle of a football match.\n\nJill was previously married to actor Craig Conway from 2007 to 2010, and the couple share son Harvey.\n\nThe mother-of-one tends to keep her private life under wraps, so it’s unclear if she is currently dating.\n\nIn the series, while coming to terms with her son's disappearance, Jodie spots a teenager named Daniel (Cody Molko) whom she ends up obsessing over as she convinces herself he resembles her son.\n\nViewers will witness the dangerous lengths the heartbroken mum goes to in order to find out the truth about Tom.\n\nJill stars alongside Jonas Armstrong as Jason, who plays her on-screen brother, and Deborah Findlay as Jodie’s mother Lynn.\n\nThe Drowning continues tonight at 9pm on Channel 5."
