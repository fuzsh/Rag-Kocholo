        "text": "Five years after her triumph on the BBC's Strictly Come Dancing, the work still keeps rolling in for busy working mum Jill Halfpenny.\n\nBefore that, EastEnders viewers knew her as Kate Mitchell but by the time she and professional dance partner Darren Bennet were crowned reality show winners, she was a household name.\n\nJill, 34, has since gone on to achieve many of her acting goals, as well as getting married to her actor boyfriend Craig Conway, and becoming a mum.\n\nJust this week, Gateshead-born Jill was announced as the new face of jewellery brand Ortak, who called her the \"perfect choice\".\n\nOrtak retail director Yvonne Carr said: \"As well as being very elegant, she is a very real and warm individual who appeals to a wide spectrum of women.\"\n\nThe year-long contract is the icing on the cake for Jill, who is currently in the stage version of Calendar Girls in London's west end.\n\nShe stars as Miss July, alongside Jerry Hall, Gemma Atkinson, and two fellow former EastEnders, June Brown (Dot) and Anita Dobson (Angie).\n\nJill, who was delighted to accept the semi-nude role, said: \"I immediately said to my agent, 'I will go and see it. That was the most obvious thing to do.\n\n\"I really enjoyed it. It's so well done and really humorous. I then accepted the part.\n\n\"The nudity is done exactly the same as it's done in the film. There's props involved and we cover each other until we are ready. It's choreographed to the nth degree, so everyone feels very safe and secure.\"\n\nThe size 8-10 actress - who was 84th in FHM's Sexiest Woman In The World poll in 2004 - naturally doesn't feel selfconscious about baring her flesh to a live audience every night.\n\nShe added: \"The whole point of Calendar Girls is that it celebrates women and the female form, so I wasn't thinking about how I looked.\"\n\nAs mum to 17-month-old Harvey-Rhys, Jill could not bear being parted from him for the four-month run of the play, so the family relocated from their home city of Newcastle to a flat in London's Soho.\n\nJill, who married Craig in 2007, said: \"It just had to be done. I don't think I would have been able to be away from him for four months and only see him at weekends. That would have killed me. I would have been miserable. We've been in London since July and just got on with it.\"\n\nIn between shows, Jill hopes to catch the new series of Strictly, which starts on Friday, September 18, but she may need to buy a video recorder first.\n\nJill, who took part in the Strictly Come Dancing Tour this year, said: \"I haven't got Sky Plus in the flat we're staying in. I don't even have a video recorder. If it starts at 7pm, I can watch the first half before I go on stage.Then I will have to record it.\"\n\nHaving worked with his brother Dean Lennox Kelly on Shameless a few years ago, Jill is hoping actor Craig Kelly - who is paired with Italian professional dancer Flavia Cacace - will dance his way to the Strictly final.\n\nShe said: \"I think that will be a very good partnership. I just have a feeling he will be able to move, I don't know why. I also think he'll come across as a really nice guy. If Craig is anything like his brother, he will be absolutely lovely.\"\n\nEven today, Jill cannot believe the impact her appearance on Strictly Come Dancing has had on her acting career.\n\nThe actress, who played Martin Platt's mistress in Coronation Street before joining EastEnders as an undercover cop, said: \"When you leave a show like EastEnders, the one thing you never expect is to do something so quickly that almost eclipses that.\n\n\"Although people totally remember me as from EastEnders and still refer to it, of course, I am more so remembered for Strictly.\n\n\"I entered Strictly being known as Kate Mitchell from EastEnders and I left being known as Jill Halfpenny, so that absolutely changed things for me.\n\n\"It was such an amazing part of my life and what's brilliant is I am still involved with it, in one way or another, every year.\n\n\"It's such a lovely thing to be involved in and I am so grateful to have had that opportunity come my way.\"\n\nSince her Strictly success, Jill and Darren have reunited for Champion of Champions competitions - and won.\n\nShe has also appeared with husband Craig in the play The Bodies, on stage as Roxie Hart in Chicago and played teacher Izzie Redpath in Waterloo Road onTV.\n\nBut Jill admits that balancing her acting career with motherhood can be difficult.\n\nShe said: \"It can be really tough but if I think about it too much and worry about it, it's a complete waste of time and energy because there's nothing I can do about it.\n\n\"Now, with each opportunity that comes up, I have to sit down with Craig and discuss whether it would work for us, how it would work and is it something that I so desperately want to do.\n\n\"The main thing for an actor is that if you get a job that would be a long time away on tour, then it's probably going to be a 'no no' when you have a small child.\n\n\"I'm sure at some point I will feel ready to do that again but as a mum that's probably the one thing that is very tough to do when they are very young.\"\n\nAs a teenager, Jill starred in the BBC children's series Byker Grove before going to drama school.\n\nAt the age of 20, she was spotted performing at the Assembly Rooms at the Edinburgh Festival.\n\nJill, who left drama school early to appear at the Fringe, said: \"That probably gave me my first big break. I got my agent from it. I got a few jobs from that because casting directors had seen me.\n\n\"I fell in love with the Edinburgh Festival the first time I did it, so I was very pleased to go back.\n\n\"If you are in something that's going well in Edinburgh, the one thing you can guarantee is that people will see it. It really did help me.\"\n\nLast summer, Jill was back at the Festival - at the Assembly Rooms - where she starred in Surviving Spike opposite shamed entertainer Michael Barrymore. Still breast-feeding Harvey-Rhys at the time, Jill and Craig relocated to Edinburgh for the summer.\n\nAnd this week, she forged another Scottish connection with her new role as the face of Orkney-based Ortak - one of the UK's biggest manufacturers of gold and silver jewellery.\n\nFaces of the brand's past campaigns have included Amanda Lamb, Myleene Klass, and Suzanne Shaw.\n\nAs her first Ortak pictures show, Jill looked stunning as she was captured on film by Scots fashion photographer Stephen Kearney at the Edinburgh Residence hotel.\n\nDelighted with her new appointment, Jill said: \"I thought, 'What a nice thing to be asked to do'. I am a bit of a jewellery freak. It was a really pleasurable job.\n\n\"I love the new Ortak collection, in particular the necklace with silver rings called Purity. You can dress it up or dress it down and it will always look stunning.\n\n\"That was one of the pieces that Ortak gave me and every time I wear it, people always ask me where I got it from.\"\n\nJill is the new faceof Ortak - one of the UK's biggestdesigners and manufacturers of goldand silver jewellery.Thereare 14Ortak stores in Orkney, Glasgow,Edinburgh, Livingston, Inverness,Aberdeen, Dundee, NewcastleandSheffield.View their new collection onlineat www.ortak.co.uk oratanybranch."
