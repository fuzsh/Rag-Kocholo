        "text": "If you’re looking for a new drama to sink your teeth into, Channel 5’s The Cuckoo could be just the thing for you. Featuring plenty of family drama and conflict, the four-part series sees one family take in a lodger called Sian (Jill Halfpenny) in order to help ease their financial difficulties.\n\nHowever, after welcoming Sian into their family home, things begin to change and the family’s dynamic starts to become undone as they quickly realise that their new lodger might not be who she claims to be.\n\nSo, as Jill Halfpenny has us hooked in her latest role, let’s take a peek at her life off-screen and where you may recognise her from…\n\nThe 48 year old actress started her career on hit show Byker Grove in 1989 when she was just 13 years old, where she played the character Nicola Dobson until 1992.\n\nFollowing her stint on the show, Jill went on to find fame on soaps including Coronation Street and EastEnders and even appeared on an episode of Heartbeat where she played Mitzi Wyler.\n\nIn 2004, the soap star’s career took a different turn when she appeared on series two of Strictly Come Dancing and was paired with professional dancer Darren Bennett. Despite being up against celebs including Julian Clary and Denise Lewis, Jill was crowned winner of the show and took home the Strictly Come Dancing glitterball trophy.\n\nAfter wowing viewers at home with her impressive footwork, the TV sensation later secured roles in the West End, appearing in musicals such as Chicago and Legally Blonde. More recently, Jill has starred in shows such as BBC miniseries Dark Money as well as Channel 5’s The Drowning. At present she is appearing in the play A Taste of Honey at Manchester’s Royal Exchange.\n\nAway from her work on stage and on screen, Jill has a son called Harvey, whom she shares with ex-husband Craig Conway. Jill and Craig, who is also an actor, tied the knot in 2007 though called time on their relationship in 2010.\n\nIn January 2017, Jill’s partner Matt sadly died from a heart attack when he was just 43 years old. Discussing the impact of her loss, Jill explained how she was “utterly bereft” six months after his passing.\n\n“It was my 42nd birthday six months later, and – still utterly bereft, floundering under the weight of his loss – I didn’t feel like celebrating, or even spending it in England,” she told The Telegraph in 2022."
