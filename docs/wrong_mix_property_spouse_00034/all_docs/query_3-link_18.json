        "text": "Former EastEnders and Coronation Street's Jill Halfpenny has been lined up for a role in new ITV drama about the infamous Yorkshire Ripper, called The Long Shadow.\n\nThe six-part drama is set to air later this year, and will look into one of the most notorious serial killers to ever exist. Peter Sutcliffe, who became known as the Yorkshire Ripper, caused terror between 1975 and 1981. He was convicted of brutally murdering 13 women and attempting to murder seven others.\n\nHis crimes took place in Bradford, Leeds, Manchester, Halifax, Huddersfield, Keighley and Silsden. After a five-year long manhunt, which was the largest recorded in UK history involving over a thousand police officers, Sutcliffe was finally caught in 1981.\n\nRead More: The two monsters who met in cell 43 before 'poetic justice' prison murder\n\nThe actress, who played Kate Mitchell in EastEnders and Rebecca Hopkins in Corrie, will play the role of Doreen, the mother of Jacqueline Hill - Sutcliffe's final victim, who was killed in Leeds in 1980.\n\nThe all-star cast also includes the likes of Daniel Mays, David Morrissey, Toby Jones, Lee Ingleby, Stephen Tompkinson and fellow former Coronation Street actress Katherine Kelly.\n\nIt has not yet been confirmed when ITV's The Long Shadow will air, but it is thought it will be broadcast later this year. However filming for the drama seems to be well under way, as former Katherine Kelly was spotted in character as Sutcliffe's second victim, Emily Jackson.\n\nSutcliffe, who spent decades in Broadmoor Hospital, was told he would never be released from custody. He died in 2020 at the age of 74.\n\nRead Next:"
