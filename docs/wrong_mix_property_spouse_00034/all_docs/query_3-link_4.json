        "text": "ACTRESS JILL Halfpenny delved into danger for her latest role, acting opposite terrifying wild animals.\n\nThe former EastEnders actress has joined the cast of ITV1’s Wild At Heart, the popular show following the adventures of a British family who run a game park in Africa.\n\nAnd she endured something of a baptism of fire on the set – especially when she ended up sharing a tent with leopards.\n\nShe said: “They were boisterous and playful because they were young, and they adored rolling around on the bed in the tent.\n\n“I’d been warned before I started that acting on the series could be a bit difficult to get used to at first – you can just as easily be performing with an elephant standing next to you or something, but lively young leopards wasn’t what I expected.\n\n“It was a bit scary but to my relief, they were very well-behaved and even though traditionally actors are warned never to act with animals and children because they always steal the limelight, I’ve enjoyed this so much I’ll ignore that rule in future.”\n\nThe Gateshead-born star makes her entrance next month as Fiona Lynch, the estranged wife of vet Ed Lynch, played by Robert Bathurst.\n\nJill, 36, said: “I think my character helps shake things up a bit. She’s pretty feisty and is trying to get back her relationship with her husband.”\n\nJill has starred in a whole heap of popular shows including Coronation Street, Waterloo Road and Shameless, but recently she’s preferred to tread the boards.\n\nShe won an Olivier Award for her role in Legally Blonde, bared all – very tastefully of course – in Calendar Girls and was announced last week as taking the lead in a revival of the classic stage play Abigail’s Party, due to open in March.\n\nHer three-year-old son, Harvey, three, from her marriage to fellow actor Craig Conway ensures she’s just as busy in her personal life, but she says working away from him can be tough.\n\n“Harvey is a real little character; full of questions and it’s energising just to see the world through his eyes and enjoy his company,” she said.\n\n“Separations from him are sometimes necessary because I have to go away to work and it’s hard, but I love my job and I have to support us. I’m fortunate to have a wonderful support network of family and friends.”"
