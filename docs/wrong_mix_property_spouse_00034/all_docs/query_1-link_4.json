        "text": "STRICTLY Come Dancing star Jill Halfpenny and North actor Craig Conway are celebrating the birth of their first child.\n\nJill and Craig, both 32, have become proud parents to a little boy.\n\nThe couple are said to be “over the moon” at their little bundle of joy and have decided to call their son, born on May 3, Harvey Reece.\n\nThe infant weighed a healthy 6lb 8oz and Jill — who has starred in Coronation Street, EastEnders and Waterloo Road — had a smooth labour.\n\nDoting dad Craig said they hadn’t announced the birth because they were still finding their feet, but revealed that new mum Jill was doing fine.\n\nCraig, born in South Shields, South Tyneside, said: “We are really proud of our baby. We said we won’t do anything for a couple of weeks because we just want to get settled.”\n\nJill’s mum Maureen, of Gateshead, who already has five grandchildren, revealed that the couple hadn’t picked out a name for a girl.\n\nShe added: “He’s not named after anyone in the family. I think they couldn’t make their minds up. They’re over the moon.\n\n“He is lovely . . . a real cutie. It is hard to tell who he looks like when they are little like that. We’re waiting to see. We’re all very happy.”\n\nThe couple first met and fell in love when they starred in a stage version of George Orwell’s classic novel 1984 at the Newcastle Playhouse six years ago.\n\nThey set up home in East London but, homesick for their family and friends in the North, moved back to the region permanently at the end of 2006, to a new home in Stocksfield, Northumberland.\n\nThe Sunday Sun was there when the couple married in February last year in St Andrew’s Church, Newcastle.\n\nWe revealed how the down-to-earth pair turned down magazine deals for their wedding photos and posed happily for well-wishers outside the church."
