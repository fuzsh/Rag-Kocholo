        "text": "Jill Halfpenny's romantic life has taken her to some sad places.\n\nThe 48-year-old actress will tonight be starring in The Cuckoo, a brand new four-part series on Channel 5 about a strapped-for-cash couple who decide to take in lodger Sian, played by Jill. Needless to say, the initially friendly arrangement doesn't exactly go swimmingly.\n\nThis is yet another memorable role for Gateshead-born Jill, who made a name for herself as a soap star in both Coronation Street and EastEnders, before breaking into the West End. In recent years, prolific Jill, who is currently starring in A Taste of Honey at Manchester's Royal Exchange Theatre, has taken on weighty subject matter in dark dramas such as Three Girls (2017) and The Long Shadow (2023).\n\nAs viewers tune in for twists and turns with The Cuckoo, we take a look at Jill's life behind the scenes, including her famous ex-husband, and the tragic loss that inspired her memoir.\n\nDates with Ant McPartlin\n\nTalented Jill cut her teeth in iconic teen drama Byker Grove, alongside the most famous Geordie duo in TV history - Ant and Dec. During a 2016 appearance on This Morning, Jill shared that she had taken the initiative and asked Ant McPartlin out on a date during their teenage years.\n\nTo the delight of countless Byker Grove fans, Jill revealed: \"We went to the cinema together, we went to see The Commitments in real life! I said to him 'there's a really good film that's come out called The Commitments, do you wanna come?' He was like 'Ah aye, yeah great!'\"\n\nThe cinema date didn't develop into anything serious, however, with Jill confirming: \"It fizzled…. We weren't right for each other!\"\n\nFamous husband\n\nJill married fellow actor Craig Conway in 2007, with cheering crowds waiting outside St Andrew's Church, Newcastle to wish them all the best. Expressing sheer wedded bliss during an interview with The Northern Echo at the time, Craig, whose work includes The Serpent (2020) and Dog Soldiers (2002), declared: \"We are the two happiest people in Newcastle today, and it's just great to be back home.\"\n\nIn May 2008, the couple, who had first locked eyes while performing in a Newcastle Playhouse stage version of George Orwell's 1984, announced they had welcomed their son Harvey Reece. Jill's mum Maureen told ChronicleLive at the time that the proud parents were 'over the moon' with their new arrival.\n\nA happy ending ultimately wasn't in store for Jill and Craig however, who parted ways in 2010 after three years of marriage.\n\nDevastating loss\n\nIn 2017, Jill suffered a terrible loss after her partner Matt Janes suffered a fatal heart attack at the gym. He was only 43 years old. Opening up with Line Of Duty star Craig Parkinson on his Two Show Podcast back in 2019, Jill explained that Matt's death had felt like a 'double loss' as it bore striking similarities with the death of her father Colin, who suffered a heart attack while playing five-a-side football in 1979.\n\nJill, who had been just four years old when she lost her dad, went on to express her feelings of grief over Matt, telling Craig: \"My grief at losing Matt, my partner, was so brutal and so shocking but then what happened was it brought out all of the grief from my dad as well. It was like dealing with a double loss – a loss I'd never actually dealt with. I just found myself thinking, 'Oh my god, this is unbearable. What am I going to do? I cannot cope. I just want cessation, this feeling to stop'.\"\n\nIn her upcoming memoir A Life Reimagined: My Journey of Hope in the Midst of Loss, which will be published June 20, 2024, Jill shares how she dealt with two such devastating bereavements, and how her trauma has shaped her as a person.\n\nYou can catch Jill Halfpenny in The Cuckoo at 9pm this evening (April 8) on Channel 5.Follow Mirror Celebs and TV on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads ."
