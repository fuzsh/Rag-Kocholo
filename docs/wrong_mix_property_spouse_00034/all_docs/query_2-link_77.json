        "text": "The six-parter by creator Danny Brocklehurst returns this week with the same theme, but with a new cast in a different location. This time the characters work in a large sportswear retailer in Wales in a series starring Griff Rhys Jones, Angela Griffin, Happy Valley’s Con O’Neill, ex-EastEnder Matt Di Angelo and Fresh Meat’s Kimberley Nixon.\n\nJill stars in the first episode as Belinda Brierley, a nurse who’s married to the company’s affable head of sales, Joe (Con O’Neill), with whom she has two teenage kids. On the surface, Belinda is an ordinary woman living a suburban life, but her husband becomes worried that she’s hiding a big secret.\n\n“Joe knows that Belinda’s told a lie about her whereabouts,” explains Jill. “But he doesn’t quite know why she’s lying, and the most obvious thing he thinks is that she’s cheating on him.\n\n“He checks her phone and decides to take drastic measures – he puts secret cameras in the house just to spy on her.” The plotline explores how people in long-term relationships can grow apart if they stop talking to each other.\n\nJill can’t divulge whether Joe’s fears are proved correct, but she does hint strongly that Joe discovers facts about Belinda or their children that knock him sideways.\n\n“The thing that Danny has explored is the fact that if you have suspicions or doubts about somebody and you try to catch them out, what you might find out is something you wish you hadn’t known,” teases Jill.\n\n“Perhaps curiosity killed the cat. I really like the idea of a husband having an idea and finding out that the truth is completely different, but not necessarily any better. What if something else is revealed which is even more painful?”\n\nOrdinary Lies, Tuesday, 9PM, BBC1"
