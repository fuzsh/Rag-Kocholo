Jill will be celebrating this holiday with her son, Harvey, who is from her ex-husband Craig Conway in 2008.\n\nCouple separated in 2010 and are now on good terms, but Jill has admitted life as a single mum wasn’t easy.\n\nDuring 2016 she gave interview where she told: “I might have a great situation now, but there have been times when I’ve felt alone, like I’m bringing up a child by myself, and that’s hard.\n\n“You always thinks the hardest times will be when there’s an emergency… but actually the most difficult thing is having no one to share the happy moments with.”\n\nJill shot to fame as teenager on Byker Grove, she used her experience for her character as frazzled mum-of-four Diane in BBC’s In the Club in 2014.\n\nShe said, “I can bring those experiences into Diane, but equally I can’t imagine what it must be like for somebody who has four children to raise them all on their own.”\n\nJill and Craig both have now moved on with new partners, she said the family unit was doing well.\n\n“Harvey gets on with all the adults who look after him, so we’ve managed to make all that work.”\n\nHer sensitive character portrayals, Jill is always on top of the casting directors’ list, she said she still feels guilty for going to work\n\n“I don’t really know where it comes from, but there’s just something inside you that makes it hard to be apart from your child.”"
