Peter Pascoe as the pair team up for the very first time to investigate a serious murder case. Wetherton Rugby Club's golden boy, Sam Connon, wakes up after arriving at home with a hangover, to find his wife, Mary, dead in the armchair. Being vice-president of the rugby club himself, Dalziel decides to ruffle a few feathers and find out who had enough of a motive to want to kill her. However, with the murder weapon nowhere to be found, evidence of the killer's involvement is rather thin on the ground. The discovery of hidden 'dirty' letters, discussion of naked foreplay at the bedroom window and the unearthing of the murder weapon during the search for a missing eight-year-old boy make for the final pieces of the puzzle. Does someone at the rugby club bear a terrible grudge against the couple – or is the true murderer closer to home?\n\n2\"An Advancement of Learning\"[2]Maurice PhillipsAlan Plater23 March 1996 ( )\n\nDalziel and Pascoe are thrown into university life when the body of a former university principal, Alison Girling, who supposedly died in a bus crash in Austria, is found underneath her own memorial statue in the university car park. Speaking to all of the staff who worked with Girling prior to her death, Dalziel struggles to make any headway until the body of Anita Sewell, a student accusing another staff member of sexual harassment is found naked on a nearby golf course. Suspecting they may have a serial killer on their hands, the trail leads straight to the doorstep of the accused – Sam Fallowfield – only for the pair to find his house trashed and gay slurs written all over the wall. Suspecting the culprit is closer to home, Dalziel's anger blows its top when he arrives back at the university to find his temporary police HQ has been trashed by students. And then Fallowfield is found dead.\n\n3\"An Autumn Shroud\"[3]Richard StandevenMalcolm Bradbury30 March 1996 ( )\n\nHaving persuaded Pascoe to marry the long-suffering Ellie, Dalziel finds himself with the opportunity to whisk himself away on holiday while Pascoe is on honeymoon. But, as ever, events fail to go to plan when Dalziel's car breaks down and he finds himself amidst a river funeral procession. Invited to stay at the deceased's house by his attractive widow, Dalziel believes all his dreams have come true, until her son goes missing, the housekeeper ends up dead in Epping Forest and an insurance investigator with a tip-off about an insurance scam regarding the family's newest business venture ends up drowned in a nearby lake.

Meanwhile, back home, Dalziel is on the trail of a bungling burglar who urinated in a poor old lady's kettle after robbing her most valued collectibles. The murder of an aspiring estate agent, which at first appears to be entirely unconnected, soon provides the missing piece of the puzzle. And if all else couldn't be worse, Pascoe is smug when Ellie manages to identify the bungling burglar before Dalziel, and his promotion to inspector finally comes to fruition, with delight.\n\nFeaturing Susannah Corbett as Ellie Pascoe, Michael Pennington as Hartley Culpepper, Patrick Ryecart as Anton Davenant, Peter Blythe as Supt Derek Backhouse, Freddie Jones as French, David Royle as Det Sgt Edgar Wield, Navin Chowdhry as Police Cadet Sanjay Singh, Joseph Morton as Carlo, Rupam Maxwell as Timmo Mansfield, Matthew Radford as Colin Hopkins, Victoria Korner as Rose Hopkins, Andrew McCulloch as Sam Dixon, Philip Manikum as Det Sgt Crowther, Andrew Callaway as Det Sgt Hamblin, Davyd Harries as Angus Pelman, Meg Davies as Marianne Culpepper, Laurence Harrington as James Palfrey, Olive Pendleton as Mavis Sturgeon and Mark Benton as Jonathan Etherege.\n\n5\"A Killing Kindness\"[5]Edward BennettMalcolm Bradbury21 June 1997 ( )\n\nDalziel and Pascoe find themselves on the trail of \"The Choker\", a serial killer who strangles young girls and then phones the local newspaper with quotes from Shakespeare's Hamlet.

At the time, a seven-year-old girl was murdered, and initially, a serial killer who confessed to killing five other girls was suspected. However, she was good friends with Farr, and due to the fact they both went missing on the same day, certain townsfolk believed he was somehow responsible.

Torn between staying loyal to her husband and supporting her student, Ellie helps Colin to do a runner when a second body is found down the mines – this time that of mining boss Heppelthwaite.
