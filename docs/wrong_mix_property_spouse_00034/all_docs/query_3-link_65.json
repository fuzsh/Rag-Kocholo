        "text": "Despite only being officially engaged, the 27-year-old has now seemingly confirmed they’ve already tied the knot, during an interview with US news show Access Hollywood.\n\nEd – who got engaged to risk advisory consultant Cherry on New Year’s Eve – was asked: “What about the wedding details? Have you picked a date? Do you know where? Do you know when yet?”\n\nBut rather than answering verbally the Suffolk-raised star simply shrugged before pointing to a silver band on his ring finger and smiling.\n\nThis prompted his interviewer to say: “Ah right. Congratulations my friend! That’s exciting,” to which Ed coyly replied: “Yeah.”\n\nWhen asked how he managed to keep the nuptials a secret, Ed said: “Well, I never really do anything too public anyway.”\n\nThe reporter then added: “That’s awesome,” and Ed thanked him.\n\nIn January the singer shared the news of his engagement on social media. The following month he denied reports he and Cherry had secretly wed after he was spotted wearing what looked like a silver wedding band on his ring finger. He was also asked shortly after when he and his other half were planning on walking down the aisle, but refused to be drawn on a potential wedding date, saying: “It will be a situation like this where no one knows.”\n\nThe pair, who have known each other since meeting at school, have been dating since 2015.\n\nJill Halfpenny finds it weird to ask the questions\n\nActress turned radio host Jill Halfpenny insists going from interviewee to interviewer certainly took some getting used to.\n\n“It’s really weird when I’m interviewing people because I’m now thinking: ‘Oh my God, this is what it feels like when I’m sat there waiting for somebody to ask me questions.’ It can be quite intimidating,” the 43-year-old tells express.co.uk.\n\nJill, who cut her acting teeth alongside Ant and Dec in Children’s BBC show Byker Grove and has since starred in a number of West End productions as well as TV shows such as Corrie and EastEnders, adds: “You want them to feel good and you want to get the best out of them but you’ve also got certain questions you’ve been asked to ask… It’s just a bit of a juggling act.”\n\nThe former Strictly star has been co-hosting Good Morning Sunday from 6-9am on BBC Radio 2 throughout August, sitting in for Rev Kate Bottley, and is deputising for Sara Cox this week from 10pm-midnight.\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

I’d have given anything to have had him on a show. He simply didn’t do interviews. He didn’t need to. Nancy Sinatra was a guest on my radio show but it wasn’t quite the same!”\n\nParky, 83, did at least get to grill most of his musical heroes.\n\n“Tony Bennett the singer and Sammy Cahn, the songwriter, both became friends,” adds the retired star, whose hugely popular show, which ran from 1971-1982, was revived by ITV from 1998- 2007.\n\n“I met Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice… after they had done Jesus Christ Superstar.”\n\nAll right Parky, that’s enough name dropping!\n\nRomance for Jennifer Aniston and Adam Sandler?\n\nCould an unlikely new showbiz coupling in the shape of Jennifer Aniston and Adam Sandler be on the cards after the pair were spotted hand in hand in Milan?\n\nUnfortunately not, Jennifer fans, as the perennially unlucky in love star was just filming a scene for a new film alongside fellow comedy actor Adam, who has been happily married to wife Jackie Titone, with whom he shares two children, since 2003.\n\nJen, 49, and 51-year-old Adam were on the set of Murder Mystery, the Netflix comedy in which they star as a married couple who travel to Italy to reinvigorate their marriage.\n\nBefore arriving in the country’s capital of fashion, the two have also been seen filming on Italy’s Amalfi Coast and visiting Jennifer’s ex-husband Brad Pitt's former pal George Clooney in Lake Como.\n\nTo be a fly on that wall…\n\nI made up for it!\n\nHoward Donald\n\nHoward Donald fancied fast cars before girls\n\nFast cars and beautiful women go hand in hand for most teenage fellas but Take That’s Howard Donald has admitted that it was very much a case of the former rather than the latter in his youth.\n\nDiscussing his teenage love of flash vehicles, the 50-year-old tells us: “I remember that on my wall I had pictures of cars. I didn’t start getting into girls until I was 16 – I was a late starter!”\n\nBut the star – who can’t have been short of a female admirer or two since forming part of Nigel Martin Smith’s multiple Brit-award winning Mancunian boyband in 1988 – has no regrets, adding: “I made up for it!”\n\nAnd nowadays father-of-four Howard, who has been happily married to Katie Halil since 2015, appreciates his more stable lifestyle.\n\n“I have kids and I am so lucky that I have a job that means I can usually be with them all day long.”\n\nCher: I'm not a diva\n\nAnyone thinking the terms diva and Cher go hand in hand are wrong – at least according to the woman herself.\n\nThe miraculously preserved 72-year-old insists she’s actually anything but.\n\n“I’m so not a diva. I don’t really care what anyone calls me. It doesn’t make any difference to me,” she says.\n\n“But that’s just not who I am. Like, I’m not somebody who makes people take the green M&Ms out of the bag.”\n\nAnd despite her plethora of image changes over the years she doesn’t like being called the queen of reinvention.\n\n“I don’t get that whole reinvention thing. Like I do stuff with hair and costumes and things like that because what am I going to do? Come in a pair of overalls and a white T-shirt? I mean, that would be boring!”\n\nLet’s hope that’s not a dig at Mamma Mia co-star Meryl Streep who wears exactly that in the film!"
