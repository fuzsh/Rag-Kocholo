        "text": "EastEnders star Jill Halfpenny shared the heartache she felt when her partner died two years ago for the first time.\n\nThe actress, who shot to fame on Byker Grove at the age of 14, bravely spoke about the devastation she felt after she lost her boyfriend - in circumstances that mirrored that of her father Collin Halfpenny's death in 1979.\n\nHer unnamed partner went to the gym and then had a heart attack in 2017.\n\nTwo years on, the EastEnders star, 44, frankly chatted about her trauma when she appeared on Line of Duty actor's Craig Parkinson podcast The Two Shot Podcast.\n\nThe brunette said: Something happened a couple of years ago - I experienced something I've never ever spoken about.\n\n\"In January 2017 my partner, in very similar circumstances to my dad, went to the gym, had a heart attack and died.\"\n\nReflecting on the grief, she added: \"what happened was that it brought all of my grief from my dad as well; it was like dealing with a double loss - a loss I'd never dealt with.\"\n\nThe EastEnders star laid bare the \"unbearable\" pain as she admitted she struggled to cope with her feelings following her partner's death.\n\nShe said: \"Oh my god, it's unbearable. I cannot cope with these feelings. I just want cessation: the feeling to stop.\"\n\nJill, who was only aged four when her father died, also shared on the “brutal” effect of losing her dad.\n\nThe soap star recalled how he headed out to play a game football and never returned.\n\nAlso, Jill touched on pretended to act happy in front of her family due to their “get on with things” attitude but then she would cry alone in her bedroom.\n\nThe Babylon star confided in Parkinson that she now prefers to deal with her emotions rather than hiding them.\n\nShe said to the host: \"It's been a rough few years but I'm here and talking to you.”\n\nThe actress was previously married to North East actor Craig Conway and has a son."
