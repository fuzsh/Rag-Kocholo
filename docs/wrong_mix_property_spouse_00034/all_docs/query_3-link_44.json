        "text": "Another 4 nighter, starting tonight on Channel 5, 9pm.\n\nLooks promising from the trailers, but‚Ä¶.\n\nStarring Jill Halfpenny, who also starred in ‚ÄòThe Drowning‚Äô and ‚ÄòThe Holiday‚Äô, both previous channel 5 (I think) 4 nighters, both equally awful.\n\nNot forgetting the recent ‚ÄòLove Rat‚Äô, but cannot blame Jill for that one.\n\nWell, we live in hope for this week‚Äôs offering.\n\nAnd by the second break, telling her life story to the new lodger, hasn‚Äôt known her 24 hours, plus drinking with her and going home drunk.\n\nBit unlikely.\n\nü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\nI wanted this to be good, but.... she moves in straight away, no luggage?\n\nHas ¬£3000 cash on her??\n\nCooks breakfast for the family on the first morning - did she provide the food or just use the family's? Talk about taking a liberty!\n\nYep, well dodgy and highly unlikely. She even sat watching TV with them all. I wouldn‚Äôt have that!\n\nI think we need some new actors coming through. As someone else said JH has been on or is coming on so many TV progs that it gets confusing which prog you are watching.\n\nI shall try and stick with it, although it's a typical Ch5 drama full of plot holes (aren't they always). I really don't want her to turn on them with the kitchen knives during the night though.\n\nIf you want some decent drama (great stories, actors and scripts) turn to 'Clocking Off' on the BBC. I started a thread on this because it's so brilliant.\n\nIt did seem a bit far fetched that while he was in his office she could see everything that was going on. Even a mirror placed so she could see him using his safe. What's the betting that she could even see the combination he was using.\n\nI gave up half way through. All too silly and I kept expecting Jill Halfpenny to start dancing as all I could remember was the jive she did.\n\nThe ¬£3000 was her ‚Äòdeposit‚Äô. For what? Her first month‚Äôs lodge money? I would be expecting a mini suite for that amount, including a kitchenette and my own telly.\n\nAnd if I were a genuine person looking to rent a room, it would certainly put me off if I thought my prospective landlord/ landlady owed money to tradespeople, and had their wives coming round to chase up monies that had been owing for a while.\n\nYes, I know, it‚Äôs only a story!\n\n(And does she always sleep in her clothes?)\n\nYou can't fault the actors, they are doing a stirling job. It's the plots which are always lacking in these Ch5 dramas because they are never realistic and have too many holes. Still, as long as there are no serial killers or grisly murders I'm not complaining.\n\nAnnoying load of rubbish. I don't like Gill Halfpenny anyway- she just plays herself. Claire Goose is a much better actress but there is nothing much else on and at that time of night im ready for bed anyway."
