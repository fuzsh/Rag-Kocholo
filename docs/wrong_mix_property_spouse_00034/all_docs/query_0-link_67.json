        "text": "Lewis has just finished directing all 7 parts of THE LONG SHADOW for New Pictures/ITV. Prior to this he directed James Graham’s SHERWOOD for House Productions/BB1 and Jimmy McGovern’s TIME for BBC Studios starring Sean Bean and Stephen Graham. All three shows were nominated for multiple TV BAFTAs in 2022/23/24, with TIME going on to win Best Mini-Series, as well as Lewis being nominated in the Best Director Category in both 2022 for TIME and most recently in 2024 for THE LONG SHADOW.\n\nIn 2020 he directed and executive produced DES for New Pictures and ITV, having created the three-part drama with writer Luke Neal. The series won the International Emmy Award for Best Performance By An Actor in 2021, and was also nominated for Best TV Movie/Mini-Series. The first episode had consolidated viewing figures of 11.4 million making it ITV's biggest new series since the launch of series CLEANING UP in January 2019, a show which he developed with writer Mark Marlow, directing the first four episodes for Sister Pictures.\n\nIt was on graduating from the National Film and Television School in March 2013, that Lewis embarked on directing his first TV project, directing with two episodes of the final series of BAFTA-winning C4 show, MISFITS. He followed this up by directing the first four episodes of Russell T Davies’s new E4 show, BANANA, and was named a Broadcast Magazine Hotshot 2014 for his work on both shows.\n\nOther credits include BROADCHURCH and HUMANS, which became Channel 4's most successful original drama in over 20 years when it aired in 2015. After directing two episodes on series one, he was asked back a year later to direct the lead block of the second series for Kudos and AMC.\n\nLewis is also represented in the US by Matt Greenberg and Jon Cassir at CAA.\n\nSHERWOOD\n\nThe Guardian - 5*\n\nThe Times - 4*\n\nThe Financial Times - 4*\n\nThe Telegraph - 4*\n\n“the BBC’s latest – and let me say up top, one of its greatest – drama series. The cleverest, most compelling show I’ve seen in years” The Guardian, Lucy Mangan\n\n“This is going to be a knotty, complicated story, but I doubt it could be in better hands” The Times, Carol Midgley\n\nTIME\n\nThe Guardian - 5*\n\nThe Financial Times - 5*\n\nThe Times - 4*\n\nThe Telegraph - 4*\n\n\"“striking direction from Lewis Arnold, ensures that these three hour-long episodes are difficult but essential viewing” Evening Standard. Katie Rosseinsky\n\n“…compelling television, with a premium cast and written like a punch to the face. In a good way.” The Times, Carol Midgley\n\n“Time is a necessary lesson on the British prison system and a masterclass in acting.” The Metro, Billy Schwabb Dunn\n\n“Under the gaze of director Lewis Arnold, every line, every flicker of emotion on those two famous faces is pushed to the fore… BBC One prison drama is brutal, must-watch television.” Radio Times, Flora Carr\n\nDES\n\nThe Times - 5*\n\nThe Financial Time - 5*\n\nThe Telegraph - 5*\n\nThe Guardian - 4*\n\n“Rare it is to watch a drama about a serial killer that leaves you feeling as though the victims have been done a service. In the end, perhaps the greatest accolade that can be given this sensitive, finely worked piece is that Nilsen himself, attention-seeking narcissist though he was, would surely have hated it.” The Guardian, Lucy Mangan\n\n“Superb: restrained, too, given the subject matter and sensitivities, and all the better for it.” Euan Ferguson, The Guardian."
