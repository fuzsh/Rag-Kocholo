        "text": "School-based drama Waterloo Road comes to BBC ONE, Thursday 9 March 2006\n\nJill Halfpenny plays Izzie Redpath\n\nGive a description of the character you play:\n\nIzzie is a teacher at Waterloo Road and the mother of two teenage girls. She was a former singer and dancer and is a free spirit at heart. She is warm, open and feistyâ€¦ and in love with her best friend!\n\nDescribe your character in three words:\n\nSpontaneous, creative, feisty.\n\nWhat do you like about Izzie?\n\nIzzie let's her heart rule her head and I admire that.\n\nWhat do you like least about Izzie?\n\nIzzie has her moments of being very stroppy.\n\nWould you like your character if you met them?\n\nYes, I would like her spirit.\n\nWhat are Izzie's life values and do these differ from your own?\n\nShe is unconventional in her thoughts and actions which is not like me but she believes love is the most important thing in life and I have to agree.\n\nHow are you similar or different to Izzie?\n\nI don't have children and couldn't imagine having them so young.\n\nDoes your character have a love interest?\n\nIzzie tries to fight the feelings but she is in love with Tom who is another teacher at the school. Unfortunately Izzie is best friends with Tom and his fiancÃ© Lorna - which makes it a bit tricky!\n\nWhy do you think Izzie is attracted to Tom?\n\nTom and Izzie are attracted because they both have similar outlooks on life. They are both spontaneous and free-spirited and they make each other laugh.\n\nWhich character at Waterloo Road does Izzie relate to best?\n\nTom for all the above reasons.\n\nDo you think you would make a good teacher?\n\nI don't think I would be patient enough to be a teacher.\n\nWhat school did you go to?\n\nSt. Edmund Campion and St. Augustines.\n\nWhich aspect of school did you enjoy the most?\n\nDinnertime! I never truly enjoyed school until my A Levels - I did enjoy doing the school plays though.\n\nWhat was your favourite subject and why?\n\nEnglish Literature and Music were my favourite subjects. I loved reading new books and plays and really enjoyed learning about music and listening to different instruments.\n\nWhat was your least favourite subject and why?\n\nI always thought Geography was pretty boring but maybe it was just my teacher.\n\nWhat were your school reports like?\n\nPretty good actually. I was never a problematic kid. I was well-behaved and got good grades but I definitely talked too much.\n\nCan you remember any of the descriptions used in your school reports to describe you?\n\nTalkative, attentive, lively.\n\nDid you have to wear a uniform?\n\nMy uniform was a black blazer and skirt/trousers with white shirt and black/gold/red tie.\n\nDid you have an inspiring teacher?\n\nI had a primary school teacher called Mr Nesbitt. He used to get us to read books and poetry out loud and he would say \"taste the words\". I loved his enthusiasm and his love of drama.\n\nHave you ever had the opportunity to teach?\n\nNo.\n\nDo you think you could teach?\n\nI think I could teach but I'm not sure I could do it full time.\n\nWhat sort of student were you?\n\nKeen and inquisitive!\n\nHave you continued to study in any form?\n\nI haven't done any further learning but I would love to learn a language and think I will at some point. I also want to learn to play the guitar.\n\nHow did you do at school?\n\nI did well at school. Nine GCSEs and three A-levels.\n\nDo you still keep in touch with anyone you were at school with?\n\nI recently got back in touch with some school friends which is nice. You tend to lose touch as you progress through life.\n\nHave you ever been a victim of bullying?\n\nYes.\n\nAny words of advice to kids who are victims of bullying?\n\nStand up to your bully, not physically but use your inner-strength to let them know you won't stand for it.\n\nHow do you think you would do if you went back to school?\n\nI think I would enjoy it more and push myself harder.\n\nWere you good at sport at school?\n\nI always loved P.E and really enjoyed learning new sports.\n\nHow do you keep in shape nowadays?\n\nI keep in shape these days by going to the gym.\n\nWhere were you born and brought up?\n\nGateshead.\n\nWhere do you live now?\n\nEast London.\n\nIf you had to teach what subject would you like to teach most?\n\nEnglish Literature.\n\nWhat were your first impressions of arriving at the Waterloo Road set?\n\nMy first impression of the Waterloo Road set was that it was cold and empty. It's strange being back in school but feeling no sense of anxiousness or worry or fear of it.\n\nWere the classrooms and corridors of waterloo road the same as when you were at school?\n\nThey looked pretty much the same.\n\nDo you see similarities between waterloo road and a school you know or attended?\n\nYes there are a few similarities. I went to an inner-city comprehensive where there was a cross-section of backgrounds, like Waterloo Road.\n\nDescribe the staff room at Waterloo Road:\n\nThe staffroom is really quite cosy. There are lots of chairs and last time I was in there, there was lots of free chocolate but I bet it's not always like that.\n\nDo you think Waterloo Road is a realistic portrayal of a school?\n\nSo far I think it is.\n\nWhat was your favourite school term at school and why?\n\nSummer because I looked forward to the 6 week holiday.\n\nHow did you spend your school holidays?\n\nMy school holidays were spent on family trips or playing with friends.\n\nDid you have a Saturday job?\n\nYes, I had lots of different restaurant jobs and worked at fast food places.\n\nDo you have brothers and sisters and were you at school together - if so how was it?\n\nI was at school with my two sisters. I can't remember seeing them much but it was nice to know they were there.\n\nCan you remember how much pocket money you used to get?\n\n50p a week.\n\nDid you ever go on a school trip?\n\nWe went to France for a school trip and I got caught buying alcohol by my French teacher! She wasn't happy as I had tried to hide it in some poor guy's garage. Anyway I got told off and that was the end of it.\n\nWere you naughty at school?\n\nNot really. And when I was I made sure I wasn't caught!\n\nWhat was the worst thing you did and did you get caught?\n\nThe worst thing I did was I got told off for being somewhere I shouldn't have been and I couldn't stop laughing. The more cross the teacher became the more and louder I laughed.\n\nWhat age did you leave school?\n\n18 and then I went to drama school in London.\n\nWhat was your first professional acting role?\n\nMy first acting role was playing an urchin in a production of Sweeny Todd at the Newcastle Playhouse.\n\nWere you a member of the drama club at school?\n\nI did go to a drama club outside of school.\n\nWhat role are you best known for?\n\nKate in Eastenders.\n\nWhat is your favourite storyline coming up and why?\n\nI'm looking forward to seeing how the Tom/Lorna/Izzie triangle works out.\n\nWhat have you enjoyed most about filming Waterloo Road?\n\nI work with some great people (both cast and crew) which is really important. It's also been good fun playing a mother which I've rarely done.\n\nHave you any long term goals or ambitions for the future?"
