        "text": "Coronation Street's Chris Gascoyne, who is a legend on the cobbles, has bagged his first major role since his departure last year.\n\nFans of the soap were left teary-eyed over Christmas when Peter Barlow, portrayed by Chris, 56, bid farewell to Weatherfield and his wife Carla Connor. The character Peter had been grappling with the sudden death of Stephen Reid, whom he accidentally ran over with his taxi in fear that Stephen was going to harm Jenny Connor.\n\nSince Stephen's demise, Peter had been feeling lost and battling his own inner demons before making the decision to leave.\n\nFast forward five months from the emotional on-screen exit, Chris' next role has been unveiled where he will be teaming up with several fellow soap stars.\n\nChris has landed a role in the new Channel 5 thriller, The Feud, where he will star alongside Jill Halfpenny, Amy Nuttall and Larry Lamb, to name a few. Filming has already kicked off in Newcastle and it is slated to air on Channel 5 in 2025.\n\nJill, 48, is recognised for her roles in popular soaps like Coronation Street and EastEnders, as well as recent dramas such as The Long Shadow and Liar. On the other hand, Amy, 41, is best known for her role as Chloe Atkinson in Emmerdale and has recently starred in Mr Bates vs The Post Office.\n\nLarry, 76, is famous for his role as Archie Mitchell in EastEnders and of course Mick Shipman in Gavin and Stacey.\n\nThe Feud sees Emma and John Barnett, played by Jill and Rupert Penry-Jones, who along with their teenage daughter Beth, played by Megan Trower, appear to live an idyllic life on Shelbury Drive. They have close friends in their neighbours, Sonia and Alan, played by Amy and Ray Fearon.\n\nThey are also close with older couple, Derek and Barbara, played by James Fleet and Tessa Peake-Jones. However, in true drama style, the close friendships in the seemingly peaceful street prove to be not quite as harmonious as they seem.\n\nA synopsis teases: \"When Emma and John decide to add a kitchen extension to their house, things quickly start to spin drastically out of control.\"\n\n\"As objections to the plans are raised, unexpected skeletons and life-threatening secrets begin to rise to the surface. Laced with menace, The Feud reveals how Emma's aspirational dream turns sharply into obsession, paranoia, and fear. One decision sets in motion events that have unforeseeable consequences for both her and the people living on her street.\"\n\nLarry will play Emma's wheeler-dealer father Terry while Chris will play intimidating builder Lee. Talking about filming the new drama, actress Jill said: \"The spiral that we see Emma's world take in The Feud, from one seemingly innocent situation to life altering revelations, is something I can't wait to dive into! Getting to work in the Northeast with the teams at Channel 5 and Lonesome Pine, along with the rest of this brilliant cast, is a joy.\""
