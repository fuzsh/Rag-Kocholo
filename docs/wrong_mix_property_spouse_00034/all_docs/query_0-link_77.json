From Jill Halfpenny and Hollywood actor Charlie Hunnam, here's a look at what some of the stars from the original cast have been up to through the years.\n\nThis list isn't intended to be comprehensive, we've taken a look back at what a number of cast members have went on to do through the years. But if you feel a star or something should have been included, let us know in the comments section below.\n\nAnt & Dec - PJ and Duncan\n\n‌\n\nWe’ll get these two out of the way first as they're most definitely the biggest success story to come out of the Grove. After releasing their debut single as PJ and Duncan, the much loved pair have never looked back.\n\nWith three albums to their name as well as a string of top 20 hits including Eternal Love, U Krazy Katz and, of course Let’s Get Ready To Rhumble, Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly became Saturday morning and prime time TV stars hosting the likes of SMTV Live, Pop Idol, Saturday Night Takeaway and Britain’s Got Talent. In 2020 the pair, who have an unbroken run of winning the National Television Award for Best Presenter spanning 21 years, released tell-all book Once Upon A Tyne celebrating their year 30 years in showbiz and have recently been back on screen with a new series of both Takeaway and Britain's Got Talent, which followed the second run of their brand new game show Limitless Win.\n\nThey delivered a blow to fans in May, when they announced that they'd be 'stepping back' from Saturday Night Takeaway, after its been entertaining millions of viewers for over 20 years.\n\n‌\n\nJill Halfpenny - Nicola\n\nAnother household name spawned by Byker Grove is this popular actress who appeared on the show between the ages of 13 and 17. Back in the early days of the show, Halfpenny's character Nicola Dobson was a big favourite with viewers and the now 45-year-old actress remains in-demand and hugely popular with fans decades on.\n\nShe's been a TV regular, with stints in Coronation Street and as Kate in Eastenders - which led to a winning run in Strictly Come Dancing and a West End career in the likes of Chicago and Legally Blonde, for which she won an Olivier award. Other dramas have included Waterloo Road, In The Club and Dark Money - which saw her speak about being put through the emotional wringer -while stage roles have seen her star in Abigail's Party.\n\n‌\n\nShe returned to the screen in new Channel 5 drama The Drowning in 2021 and in February 2022 took the lead in another thriller for the broadcaster - The Holiday.

She and Jayni then attempted to ‘do a PJ and Duncan’, launching the double act Crush.\n\n‌\n\nTheir singles Jellyhead and Luv’d Up didn’t make the Top 40 here, but won them fans in Japan and America. Donna, from Newcastle, turned TV presenter which saw her at the helm on the likes of The Big Breakfast, MTV’s Total Request Live and Live from Studio Five.\n\nShe is now known for being something of a fashion entrepreneur and has also shown off her skills on Dancing on Ice.

He then added an impressive string to his acting bow by appearing regularly on Doctor Who. Other subsequent TV roles have seen him in Russell T.Davies’ new Channel 4 drama Cucumber and Hollyoaks as DS Gavin Armstrong, who was killed in a shocking Christmas murder at the end of 2017.\n\nYou'll now regularly hear his voice on many ITV links as he has been a voiceover guy for the channel for a number of years now. In 2015, Andrew took home the Rising Star accolade at the LGBT Awards.\n\nAnna Orwin - Lou\n\n‌\n\nAn ever present character on the Grove for 16 years, Lou was foster parent to a whole host of regulars at the youth club. In addition to being the most famous mam on children's TV, Anna also starred in Newcastle based crime drama 55 Degrees North, as well as Holby City and hit comedy show The League of Gentlemen. She also had roles in Coronation Street and Emmerdale.\n\nDo these awaken any memories for you? Let us know in the comments section below.\n\nCharlie Hunnam - Jason\n\n‌\n\nYes Charlie Hunnam! Ok, so he appeared in only three episodes as Jason but the Newcastle-born actor has to have a mention as he's gone on to have worldwide success, firstly starring in Russell T Davies’s Queer as Folk and secondly landing the lead role in smash hit US drama Sons of Anarchy.Roles. He pulled out of the lead role in the Fifty Shades of Grey films, which of course was taken on by The Fall's Jamie Dornan.\n\nCharlie left the film due to a packed schedule at the time and later revealed: \"I bit off more than I could chew and it was painful. I loved the character and I wanted to do it … It was one of those damned if you do, damned if you don’t situations.” Other roles have ranged from Green Street, to the lead in 2002's Nicholas Nickleby to the star spot in Guy Ritchie's 2017 King Arthur: Legend of the Sword.Charlie lives in Los Angeles with his long-term, the jewellery designer Morgana McNelis.\n\nLyndyann Barras - Spuggy\n\n‌\n\nLyndyann was definitely one of the show's most famous faces, thanks to her playing the role of Spuggy. Spuggy was a dedicated Grover for six series and although she hasn’t made such an impact on the small screen since, she has appeared on stage in local amateur productions of Annie Get Your Gun and High Society and still lists herself as an actress as well as a businesswoman on Twitter and Instagram. She’s also a mam-of-two.\n\nIn 2020 she hosted a segment on Channel 5 throwback show Top of the Box, fronting the children's TV highlights from 1989, which saw her in front of the camera both at 'the Grove', which is actually in Benwell and on Newcastle Quayside.\n\nBilly Fane - Geoff\n\n‌\n\nLike Spuggy, Billy’s character Geoff was a staple of Byker Grove for many years, until the club’s head honcho met an unfortunate end in a gas explosion in 2000. Billy appeared in countless pantomimes across the region as well as in Heartbeat. He is perhaps best known for appearing in North East films Billy Elliot and Purely Belter.\n\nIn other news he graduated with a postgraduate course in Education and Educational Special Needs from Hull University.\n\nBrett Adams And David Oliver - Noddy and Marcus\n\n‌\n\nThe lads, better known to Byker Grove viewers as Noddy and Marcus (looking very young here!) went onto be in boyband Point Break, who had a top 10 hit with Stand Tough in 2000 and other chart hits with the likes of Freakytime and Do We Rock.\n\nFor more nostalgia stories, sign up to our Liverpool Echo newsletter here.\n\nDenise Welch - Polly\n\n‌\n\nWhile she might have only been on Byker Grove for seven episodes, Denise too had a slice of TV fame on the CBBC show, before going onto see her profile sky rocket with leading roles in both Soldier Soldier and Coronation Street.

He was the loveliest of guys, even though he was a Denton ‘Burner’, the the arch nemesis of the Byker ‘Grovers’! A sad loss at such a young age. RIP Dale.
