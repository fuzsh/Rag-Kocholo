        "text": "It was filmed in the North East of England\n\nChannel 5 bosses have announced a brand new six-part drama called The Feud, starring popular actors Jill Halfpenny, Rupert Penry-Jones and Jamie-Lee O’Donnell.\n\nWith filming taking place in May 2024 in the North East of England, bosses have now released more details about the upcoming drama, which is directed by Vigil director Andy de Emmony. Here's everything you need to know about The Feud.\n\nWhat is The Feud?\n\nThe Feud is an upcoming six-part drama series which will air on Channel 5, following neighbours on a suburban street who come to blows over plans to build an extension on their property.\n\nChannel 5 say of the plot: 'The Feud introduces Emma and John Barnett, who, along with their teenage daughter Beth, appear to live an idyllic life on Shelbury Drive. They’re close friends with their neighbours, Sonia and Alan, and despite their foibles, are also fond of older couple, Derek and Barbara.\n\n'The close friendships in this seemingly peaceful street prove to be not quite as harmonious as they seem. When Emma and John decide to add a kitchen extension to their house, things quickly start to spin drastically out of control. As objections to the plans are raised, unexpected skeletons and life-threatening secrets begin to rise to the surface.\n\n'Laced with menace, The Feud reveals how Emma’s aspirational dream turns sharply into obsession, paranoia, and fear. One decision sets in motion events that have unforeseeable consequences for both her and the people living on her street.'\n\nIs there a trailer?\n\nNo trailer has been released for The Feud at the time of writing.\n\nWhen is it on TV?\n\nThere's no exact start date just yet, but bosses have confirmed it will air in 2025.\n\nWhat channel is it on?\n\nThe new drama will air on Channel 5 and My5.\n\nWho is in the cast?\n\nActress Jill Halfpenny continues her work with Channel 5, taking on the lead role of Emma Bartlett. Derry Girls star Jamie-Lee O'Donnell will also appear as PC Gallagher, whilst Gavin and Stacey's Larry Lamb is taking on the role of a character called Terry.\n\nSee the full list of cast members below:\n\nJill Halfpenny as Emma Bartlett\n\nRupert Penry-Jones as John Bartlett\n\nJamie-Lee O'Donnell as PC Gallagher\n\nLarry Lamb as Terry\n\nAmy Nuttall as Sonia\n\nRay Fearon as Alan\n\nTessa Peake-Jones as Barbara\n\nJames Fleet as Derek\n\nMegan Trower as Beth Bartlett\n\nAlex Macqueen as Nick\n\nChris Gascoyne as Lee\n\nJudith Alexander\n\nJoel Beckett\n\nLuke Hammond\n\nJoel Kai Ali\n\nWhere was it filmed?\n\nThe Feud was filmed in Jarrow and Newcastle in the North East Of England, with filming also taking place inside houses on a street in Benton.\n\nOn filming The Feud, Jill Halfpenny said: “The spiral that we see Emma’s world take in The Feud, from one seemingly innocent situation to life altering revelations, is something I can’t wait to dive into!\n\n\"Getting to work in the Northeast with the teams at Channel 5 and Lonesome Pine, along with the rest of this brilliant cast, is a joy.”\n\nWho wrote it?\n\nThe Feud has been written and created by Aschlin Ditta, whilst being ordered for Channel 5 by Comissioning Editor Paul Testar.\n\nThe series will be directed by Andy de Emmony (Vigil and The Nest) with Lesley Douglas producing for Lonesome Pine Productions.\n\nAschlin Ditta and Andy de Emmony will also executive produce the series, with Banijay Rights onboard for international distribution and funding by North East Screen Industries Partnership delivered by North East Screen.\n\nPaul Testar says of the series: “Neighbourly disputes happen every day. The Feud takes that premise and runs with it to its extreme limit. What starts as an innocuous renovation triggers an extraordinary sequence of events. We’re excited to work with the wonderful team at Lonesome Pine again to bring this great story and stellar cast to the Channel 5 audience.”\n\nCheck out the best TV crime dramas to binge right now:\n\nThe Feud will air on Channel 5 in due course.\n\nNow read:\n\nBenidorm fans can't believe how different Chantelle actress looks now\n\n18 TV shows we REALLY wish would make a comeback\n\nAll of the rumoured stars for I'm A Celeb 2024\n\nHow to listen to Hits Radio:\n\nTurn it up with Hits Radio!
