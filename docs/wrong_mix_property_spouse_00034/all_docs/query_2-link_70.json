        "text": "ACTRESS Jill Halfpenny had no sooner put down her suitcase from a dream honeymoon in the Maldives than she was in the car driving to Birmingham.\n\nAnd now 31-year-old Jill, who married actor Craig Conway in their home town of Newcastle last month, does not expect to see her new husband again until she finishes playing Sonya in Chekhov's Uncle Vanya at Birmingham Repertory Theatre.\n\n\"Our honeymoon was just amazing,\" she says. \"We stayed on an island called Beautiful Island and it really was. We just wanted a relaxing holiday as we knew we wouldn't then see each other for a while. Craig is now filming in South Africa and I came to Birmingham almost immediately from the honeymoon.\n\n\"It is strange because we have always seen each other's work and it is a shame that he won't because it is such a big part of your life.\"\n\nJill is probably best known to readers as Kate Mitchell in EastEnders and as Izzie in Waterloo Road but she really captured the public's imagi-nation when she took the Strictly Come Dancing crown.\n\n\"That really widened my audience massively,\" she says. \"I still get all kinds of people coming up to me and saying they saw me in Strictly Come Dancing.\n\n\"And what is surprising is the breadth of the audience. I get builders on building sites shouting 'show us a tango' and little old ladies telling me they loved it. It was a great show and a real experience.\"\n\nBut Jill admits that she has had to leave the dancing on one side since partnering Darren Bennett.\n\n\"How can you match dancing with a world champion?\" she says. \"And I just don't have time. Dancing will never be my main thing - it is acting so I have to concentrate on that.\"\n\nJill did have the opportunity to kick her heels when she gained the role of Roxy Hart in the West End show Chicago.\n\n\"It was fantastic fun but really hard work,\" she says. \"I really take my hat off to those girls and lads who work all the time in musical theatre. You have to be really dedicated. You can't do it if you are out on the town all the time.\"\n\nAnd after her West End success, Jill was keen to try something different. Last year she played the lead role in Zola's Therese Raquin in Newcastle and was then offered the part of Sonya by Rachel Kavanaugh, Birmingham Rep artistic director and director of this stage production.\n\n\"It was weird,\" recalls Jill. \"I was sitting there thinking I would really like to do some classical theatre and an hour later my agent rang to say Rachel was interested in offering me the part. I said 'I will do anything she wants to do'.\n\nLuckily Rachel, who took over the management of the theatre last year, is proving to be not too harsh a taskmaster.\n\n\"She is great. I am really enjoying it and all the cast are brilliant,\" enthuses Jill. n Bryony Lavery's adaptation of Uncle Vanya opens tonight at Birmingham Repertory Theatre and plays until April 14."
