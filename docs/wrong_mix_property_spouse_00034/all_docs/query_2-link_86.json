        "text": "The actress got emotional as she spoke about losing her partner in 'devastating' circumstances for the first time\n\nAn Eastenders star has opened up for the first time about her heartache after losing her partner who died two years ago.\n\nJill Halfpenny, who shot to fame in Byker Grove at the age of 14, bravely spoke about the devastation she felt after she lost her unnamed boyfriend who died from a heart attack when he went to the gym in 2017, reports the Mirror Online .\n\n‌\n\nThe circumstances sadly mirrored that of her father Colin Halfpenny's death in 1979.\n\nTwo years on, the EastEnders star, 44, frankly chatted about her trauma when she appeared on Line of Duty actor's Craig Parkinson podcast The Two Shot Podcast.\n\nBoris Johnson humiliated by dad of sick child furious about the state of the NHS\n\n‌\n\nLiverpool Echo Icon\n\nSign up to FREE email alerts from ECHO Daily News\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you’ve consented to and improve our understanding of you.

More info\n\nThe actress said: \"Something happened a couple of years ago - I experienced something I've never ever spoken about.\n\n\"In January 2017 my partner, in very similar circumstances to my dad, went to the gym, had a heart attack and died.\"\n\nReflecting on the grief, she added: \"What happened was that it brought all of my grief from my dad as well; it was like dealing with a double loss - a loss I'd never dealt with.\"\n\n‌\n\nThe EastEnders star laid bare the \"unbearable\" pain as she admitted she struggled to cope with her feelings following her partner's death.\n\n‌\n\nShe said: \"Oh my god, it's unbearable. I cannot cope with these feelings. I just want cessation: the feeling to stop.\"\n\nSeven things we learnt at a deeply concerning Liverpool City Council meeting\n\nJill was only four when she lost her dad and shared the \"brutal\" effect of losing her dad.\n\n‌\n\nThe star recalled how he went out to play a football game but never returned.\n\n‌\n\nShe also touched on how she pretended to act happy in front of her family due to their \"get on with things\" attitude but she would later cry in her bedroom.\n\nThe Babylon star confided in Parkinson that she now prefers to deal with her emotions rather than hiding them.\n\nShe said to the host: \"It's been a rough few years but I'm here and talking to you.”\n\n‌"
