Jill's marriage to Craig Conway

In 2007, Jill married fellow actor Craig Conway, who has featured in a number of stage plays, films and TV shows, including the BBC's Doctors. The couple divorced in 2010 after welcoming one child together, Harvey Reece, in 2008.

Relationship with Matt Janes

The actress has remained very private about her love life but opened up about her grief in 2019 after the death of her partner two years prior.

The 46-year-old appeared on Line of Duty star Craig Parkinson's podcast, The Two Shot Podcast, where she shared her grief following the death of her partner Matt, who sadly passed away when he suffered a heart attack at the gym in 2017.

Jill explained how his death mirrored that of her father, Colin Halfpenny, who also died of a heart attack in 1979, when the actress was just four years old.

"In January 2017, my partner, in very similar circumstances to my dad, he went to a peloton class at the gym, and he had a heart attack and died," Jill said.

With her voice starting to break, she continued: "My grief at losing Matt, my partner, was so brutal and so shocking but then what happened was it brought out all of the grief from my dad as well. It was like dealing with a double loss â€“ a loss I'd never actually dealt with."

The Three Girls star added: "I just found myself thinking, 'Oh my god, this is unbearable. What am I going to do? I cannot cope. I just want cessation, this feeling to stop.'"
