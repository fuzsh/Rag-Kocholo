        "text": "Is there one medium that gives you more satisfaction as an actor?\n\nThere is a different kind of satisfaction. When you are working in front of the camera, it's really just you and the director. So it's a different apparatus. For a play, there's the immediate feedback from the audience and the big difference is that you can't turn to them and say, \"I just screwed that up, can we take it again?\"\n\nHave you needed to say that during this run?\n\nThere have been a few glitches, but the smartest thing I did was start to learn the big monologue back in January, and we didn't go into rehearsal until March. I guess another way to look at it is that I'd be pretty stupid not to have done that. I talked to [director] Bob Falls about it first. One of the great benefits of a play is getting to rehearse with actual people and learning lines as you go. It can be counterproductive to learn your lines before you go into rehearsal because you have no idea what the other actors are going to do and how you should respond to their choices or what the director might want. Bob and I decided that so much of the story my character tells is without that much interaction with anyone else on the stage, I could go ahead and learn it before rehearsal. So to answer the question in a really long-winded, roundabout way: Yeah, there have been little spots like the first time a cell phone went off. But I know it well enough—and I'm looking for wood to knock on now—that if I skip ahead I can go back and stitch it back in. I call it freestyling, but thankfully I haven't had to do that much. Life is long, so I'd rather not tempt fate. Put it this way: I'm terrified every night. I'm constantly humbling myself before the line gods.\n\nAnd I'm sure the line gods didn't make things any easier since you needed to learn the lines and master an Irish accent at the same time.\n\nNo, not really. I went to Dublin and hung out with Conor, and he had very specific ideas about how each person should speak. It was just repetition and immersion and then forgetting about it. God knows, the last thing that you want to be doing on stage is playing your accent. It's very far from the classic Lucky Charms or leprechaun accent that most people associate with being Irish. And we had a great dialect coach who steered me away from that, but you can make yourself crazy with this stuff so you have to give yourself a break. I mean, no two people in Dublin sound alike. If you're consistent, the audience will eventually relax and believe you. People have seen me in other things, so the first five minutes of the show is always \"There's Oliver Platt doing an accent,\" but then they get used to it and hopefully just forget that I'm doing anything. We've heard really nice things from Irish people! That's the best thing I can tell you. The complaints come from people who live in Milwaukee. The Irish people think it's great.\n\nWhy did you feel the need to go to Ireland for the role?\n\nI had the free time and it just seemed crazy not to go. When I'm telling my big story in the show, there are all these very specific places mentioned in Dublin. I'd never been to Dublin before and Conor was there and it was a real luxury to sit and talk with the playwright. He was really happy I came. And then we drove to all the places I mention in the story—except the whorehouse. That's for next time.\n\nThe ladies of the night might recognize you after all your TV and film work—and now a Tony nomination.\n\nThe nomination is just now sinking in. I found out about it in classic style, as I was in bed and my publicist called me and woke me up. I sleep strange hours now. I can't wake up at 8:00 am if I want to be at my best at 8:00 pm. The nominations are announced way too early."
