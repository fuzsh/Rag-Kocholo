Phil and Claire have a surprisingly good time with unlikely dinner companions, their neighbors Ronnie and Amber, and Gloria and Mitch agree to go clubbing with Haley to prove theyâre still young and fun but they didnât anticipate the pre-party portion of the night.\n\nFinding Fizbo\n\nAn online video sets Cam on a quest to restore Fizbo's good name. Meanwhile, Phil's in for a surprise when he meets his future step-brother."
