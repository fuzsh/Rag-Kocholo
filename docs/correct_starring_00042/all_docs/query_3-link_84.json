        "text": "Originally produced at London’s Royal Court Theater, Conor McPherson's Shining City \"focuses on John (Oliver Platt), a guilt-ridden man who visits a therapist after seeing the ghost of his recently deceased wife. What starts out as an everyday exchange becomes a gripping struggle to survive — a struggle that will change both men for the rest of their lives.\"\n\nMcPherson had a Broadway and London sensation with his The Weir.\n\nTony Award winner Robert Falls (Long Day's Journey Into Night) will direct the Broadway staging at the Biltmore Theatre. Previews begin April 13, 2006, toward a May 3 opening.\n\nAdditional casting will be announced at a future date.\n\nPlatt recently earned Emmy and Golden Globe nominations for his work in the critically acclaimed Showtime series \"Huff,\" which just completed filming its second season. Platt will be seen in the upcoming films, \"Casanova,\" directed by Lasse Hallstrom, and \"Ice Harvest,\" in which he stars with John Cusack and Billy Bob Thornton. He most recently worked with Cusack on the feature \"Martian Child,\" for New Line Cinema. Platt made his producing debut on the independent film \"Big Night,\" which was co-directed by actors Stanley Tucci and Campbell Scott. Platt later re-teamed with Tucci for \"The Imposters.\"\n\nOn television, Platt received an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series for his role as White House Counsel Oliver Babish on the political drama \"The West Wing.\"\n\nHe graduated from Tufts University with a degree in drama and immediately began working in regional theatre, as well as Off-Broadway, in such productions as The Tempest, and John Guare's Moon Over Miami. He also starred in the Lincoln Center production of Ubu and Jules Feiffer's Elliot Loves, directed by Mike Nichols. Platt most recently received rave reviews for his performance as Sir Toby Belch in Brian Kulick's Twelfth Night.\n\nSingle tickets for Shining City are available by calling TeleCharge.com at (212) 239-6200 or at www.telecharge.com or at the Biltmore Theatre box office (261 West 47th Street).\n\nVisit www.manhattantheatreclub.com."
