        "text": "Highest Rated: 100% The Tale of the Princess Kaguya (2013)\n\nLowest Rated: 4% Shut In (2016)\n\nBirthday: Jan 12, 1960\n\nBirthplace: Windsor, Ontario, Canada\n\nThe definitive scene-stealing supporting player, Oliver Platt built a steady acting career with his knack for taking unappealing characters, like Russell Tupper on \"Huff\" (Showtime, 2004-06) and making them funny and unexpectedly empathetic. Platt's large frame, expressive face, and booming, gravelly voice were leveraged to great effect in countless roles as attorneys and other educated professionals, with the actor earning acclaim for guest stints on TV's \"The West Wing\" (NBC, 1999-2006) and \"Nip/Tuck\" (FX, 2003-10). On the movie screen, he made pompous, amoral scoundrels his calling card in \"A Time to Kill\" (1996), \"Bulworth,\"(1999) and \"Frost/Nixon\" (2008), while occasionally getting the chance to steal the spotlight in the madcap comedy \"Impostors\" (1997) and on Broadway with his Tony-nominated performance in \"Shining City.\" Platt's unique talent for balancing imposing physical presence with subtle wit, while hinting at the vulnerable side of the over-confident blowhard made him one of the most interesting, craft-oriented actors on stage and screen.\n\nHighest rated movies\n\n93% Frost/Nixon\n\n91% Bessie\n\n90% Babes\n\n90% Kinsey\n\n87% Professor Marston & the Wonder Women 87% Chef 86% X-Men: First Class\n\n85% Please Give\n\nPhotos\n\nOliver Platt Oliver Platt at arrivals for NBC Entertainment Upfronts 2019, The Four Seasons, New York, NY May 13, 2019.
