        "text": "The flashy new Broadway revival of the 1950 musical Guys and Dolls stars Lauren Graham (Gilmore Girls), Craig Bierko (The Music Man), and—a personal favorite of ours—Oliver Platt (Frost/Nixon, The West Wing) as Nathan Detroit, a role previously filled by such big shots as Nathan Lane and Frank Sinatra. But despite the agony of influence, Platt puts his own stamp on the iconic character, bringing a touching element of tortured anxiety to the part of the floating craps game orchestrator. We spoke with him this week about his return to the stage after some busy years spent doing movies and television.\n\nIt's been a number of years since you've done theater, right? Right. About two or three years, I think.\n\nWas it tough to make the transition back to stage after doing screen work? Not so much, given that I've made that transition before. What was much more difficult was to do a musical. Musicals are just a whole different beast. The last play I did was much more naturalistic, much more cinematic, in the sense that I kind of sat on a couch and talked. This couldn't be further, obviously, than sitting on a couch and talking. It's a big show, there are moving parts, and it's also incredibly well-known material. Of course you're doing it because it's classic, but once you decide to do it you have to kind of mind-fuck your way into it, and approach it as freshly as possible.\n\nHave you seen the successful Nathan Lane revival? I did, I saw that, many moons ago.\n\nWas that the one that was hardest to get out of your head? I really admired that revival and all the performances in it. It was very clear to me that the reason it's a classic is that it holds up over time. Not only will a classic hold up, but it'll hold up to a number of different approaches. I was really interested in the approach that took the relationships seriously. And [director] Des McAnuff really wanted to focus a little bit more on taking the relationships more seriously. Naturalistic is the wrong word... but in an emotionally truthful way. It wasn't easy. The truth is, we're sitting here talking about this as if it's some sort of grand plan, but I really wouldn't know any other way to do it, in a sense. But that's what we did.\n\nThe night I saw it someone's phone went off. Do you get a lot of that? We get surprisingly little of that, actually. I've heard a couple of cell phones, maybe. You tell them to turn them off at the beginning but of course not everybody gets the message. My first reaction when a cell phone goes off is, \"Oh shit, it's mine!\" I have that guilty conscience. I don't take my cell phone onstage with me, but I have that instantaneous reaction.\n\nYou once said you like to choose roles that are different from what you just did, as a contrast. What were you working on before this? The last thing I did was a Roland Emmerich disaster epic. I played the White House chief of staff. So yeah, I guess that would fit that criteria.\n\nThere have been some good reviews and some tough reviews. Do you read reviews while you're doing a show? I do not. It's just an insane thing to do if you have to get up on stage and do it every night. Good or bad, I know very few actors who work on the stage who do that, because it's just a terrible idea. You have to be a Zen mind warrior to do this anyway, even without reading the reviews. Good or bad. Obviously, you don't want to read the bad ones, but even the good ones... They talk about some moment they liked and then it's gone for good! You get to that moment, you think, \"Here it comes! Here it comes! My great moment!\" And then, \"Where's my great moment? What happened to my great moment?\"\n\nWhat's your favorite part of the show? I like singing \"Sue Me\" with Lauren.\n\nCarol Rosegg\n\nLeading up to this you did an interview with your brother at New York Magazine. Do you ever disagree with him about his restaurant reviews? I really enjoy going out with him, but you have to be very careful what you say; you say something disparaging about a crab cake and that would be it for that restaurant. So you feel a lot of responsibility. I'm over-identifying with the crab cake and the guy that made it. So I gotta be careful about that. But my brother is very good at what he does; he's very fair too. If he goes somewhere and it's not a high-profile place, and he doesn't like it, then he won't review it.\n\nDoes he ever give you feedback on your acting? He's supportive, he's my bro. We look after each other. I tend to hear more from him about stuff he likes, let's put it that way.\n\nAre there any stage roles that you've always wanted to do but you haven't had the opportunity yet? I'm just not, for better or for worse, the kind of actor who sits around going, \"I've always wanted to play this or that.\" I pick the best job that comes my way, when I get a job. I'm incredibly fortunate to be able to make a living doing what I do, and I love my job, but it's a job. I ultimately do it for very selfish reasons, but I don't do it because I think it's the most important thing in the world. So it's not like I sit around musing about how I'm going to make my next mark or anything.\n\nAre you having fun with the other cast members? I am. We have a great group.\n\nDo you guys go out after the show? It's tricky because it's a long show, and we do it eight times a week, and you have to be as judicious with your party energy as you are with your onstage energy. You can't go out every night. But we do go out together. Lauren and I have date night. Every two weeks we go out on a date, just the two of us. We go out for dinner, talk over events.\n\nCan you sense a different energy from the audience from night to night? Absolutely, every single audience, I guarantee, is going to be different. It's their very nature. You can kind of lump them into different character groups, you can make generalizations with this kind of audience, that kind of audience, but they always surprise you. The biggest mistake you can make, and you always make this mistake early in a run, is that once you get a quiet house, you think you're dead. It's got a lot to do with material, too. They've always got it by the end, and this play just works if you let it, if you just tell the story. But we get quiet houses that are going nuts at the end, and we get houses that are crazy at the beginning that kind of settle in and then come back at the end. There are all kinds of houses. That's part of the fun of live performance, is making those little adjustments and not pushing and just staying in the saddle and telling the story.\n\nI really loved The Ice Harvest. Was it a challenge to make that extended inebriation believable? Not at all! [Laughing] A lot of that movie was shot at night, and a lot of that stuff happened at three in the morning. What was tricky was charting the levels of inebriation. The guy started out utterly plastered and he ended up essentially... It's not like he started out tipsy. He started out plastered and progressed. He started out plastered and he just gets more and more self-destructive and pathetic as the night goes on. But I'm glad you enjoyed that; I have a particular fondness for that role, that guy Pete. He's a lovely old fellow. Sad guy.\n\nWhat's your most memorable fan interaction? That's an interesting question. The fan interactions range all over the map. I try and be really nice to fans because I've always appreciated them. The important thing to remember about fan interactions is that they're just all over the map. No sooner does someone come up to you and tell you you're God's living gift to theater or film, then another person comes up and asks, \"Were you in my macrame class at Fresno State?\" Those are the best ones; those are the ones that ground you and give you perspective on life and work. I'm grateful that people appreciate what I do and I try to be gracious. People in New York are pretty understanding and respectful. It's not like I get worried about being rushed by screaming weirdos. There's a steady trickle of admirers but nothing I couldn't handle.\n\nDo you have a pet project? I'm bizarrely reluctant to talk about those things. I'll talk about it once I know what's happening. You'll be the first guy I call. But I'm superstitious about talking about stuff before it's real. If you leave something out there people will say \"what happened to...\" And you'll be like \"Oh. Well, I guess it kind of sucked.\" So the smart money says talk about something when you need to talk about it. But I appreciate the question."
