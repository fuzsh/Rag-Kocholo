Taking to the road, Chef Carl goes back to his roots to reignite his passion for the kitchen - and zest for life and love.\n\nIndecent Proposal\n\nDavid and Diana are a loving couple who are facing financial ruin. When they head to Las Vegas hoping to save their house, they meet a mysterious billionaire who offers a solution to their money problems: $1 million - if he can sleep with Diana.\n\nKill the Messenger\n\nBased on the true story of Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Gary Webb, who uncovered a conspiracy involving the men smuggling crack cocaine into America, and the role the CIA played in it as they used profits to arm rebel fighters in Nicaragua."
