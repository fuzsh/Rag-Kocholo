Interpretation of this Part.\n\nFor the purpose of this Part-\n\n(a) a person shall not, in relation to the Government or an officer of the Government, be deemed to be interested in any land being resumed or occupied under this Part, or entered upon under any of its provisions, unless such person either has an interest which is protected under section 132, although it is not registered, or has an interest which is protected by registration under Part VII or has any rights lawfully created under section 5,6 or 7; but nothing in this definition shall be deemed to preclude the Court, in from giving effect to any right or equity which a person may have against a person receiving or entitled to receive compensation under this Part; and\n\n[Am. by A78]\n\n(b) \"Court\" means the High Court.\n\n84. Settlement Notification.\n\n(1) Whenever it appears to the Director that in any area there may be doubt or uncertainly as to whether the existing documents of title properly define the rights and interests of those entitled or the boundaries of the land included therein, or where it appears likely that rights of ownership have been acquired by natives by the exercise of their customary rights, or whenever for any other reason he is of the opinion that it is expedient to affect a settlement of rights, he may publish in the Gazette a Settlement Notification in accordance with subsection (2).\n\n(2) The Settlement Notification shall state the situation and limits of the area, hereinafter called \"the settlement area\", within which the settlement of rights to land and registration thereof shall be effected and shall declare that, after a period to be defined in the Settlement Notification, the demarcation of parcels and presentation of claims may begin in any block within the settlement area.\n\n(3) On or after the publication of the Settlement Notification under this section, the Director shall assign a Settlement Officer and such Assistant Settlement Officer as may be necessary to carry out the settlement.\n\n85. Notice by Settlement Officer.\n\n(1) The Settlement Officer shall cause a preliminary notice of the intended survey, settlement and registration of rights in any block within the settlement area to be published at the office of the District Officer and at convenient places in the neighbourhood of such block.\n\n(2) The notice shall be published not less than thirty days before any exercise by the Settlement Office of the powers conferred upon him by section 88 and shall contain-\n\n(a) directions as to the clearance of boundaries and the presentation of documents of title in support of claims;\n\n(b) notice of the consequence of failure to present claims in due time; and\n\n(c) such instructions as the Settlement Officer may think fit for obtaining assistance and information in respect of native customary rights.\n\n86. Staying actions after publication of any notification.\n\n(1) No proceedings concerning rights to land in any block within the area for which a Settlement Notification has been published shall be commenced in any court.\n\n(2) Any proceedings commenced before the notification in published may be continued, and the Settlement Officer may delay dealing with the rights in the land concerned until such proceedings have been finally determined. Any such proceedings may, by leave of the court, be withdrawn upon such terms as the court may, in all the circumstances, consider equitable.\n\n87. Notice of progress to be published.\n\nBefore and during the course of the settlement, the Settlement Officer shall publish from time to time notices stating the order in which he intends to proceed. The notices shall be published in the District Office and at convenient places within the settlement area.\n\n88. General powers of Settlement Officer.\n\nSubject to this code, the Settlement Officer, in execution of his duties, may-\n\n(a) publish notices ordering the attendance at any time and place of claimants to land in the settlement area;\n\n(b) order any claimant to cut the boundaries of the land claimed by him before such date as he may direct; and in default of compliance, may cause such boundaries to be cut at the expense of such person;\n\n(c) issue notices or orders requiring the attendance of any person or the production of any documents that he may deem necessary for carrying out the settlement, and may administer oaths in any inquiry made for the purpose of the settlement;\n\n(d) dispense with the attendance of any person or the production of any document;\n\n(e) make a copy of any document produced, and endorsed or stamp such document with some writing to show that it has been produced to him;\n\n(f) authenticate any document signed and attested before him; and\n\n(g) extend the time for the performance of any act to be done under this code.\n\n89. Scheduled of alienated land.\n\n(1) If any parcels of lawfully alienated land are situated within the limits of the settlement area, the Settlement Officer shall, after an examination of registers, counterparts or issue documents of title, instrument, survey plans and maps and other evidence, draw up a Schedule of Alienated land which shall be in Form D in the First Schedule and shall show in respect of alienated land in the block-\n\n(a) the name of the district in which the land is situate;\n\n(b) the name and number of the block;\n\n(c) the reference numbers of all parcels in the block;\n\n(d) the area of each parcel;\n\n(e) the name and address of the proprietor of each parcel or of each proprietor, if there are more proprietors than one;\n\n(f) where there are more proprietors than one of any parcel, the share held by each proprietor;\n\n(g) the nature of the title to each parcel;\n\n(h) the commencement date, and the term, of the title to each parcel;\n\n(i) any other interests in each parcel, and the name and address of every person holding any such interest;\n\n(j) the annual rent payable in respect of each parcel;\n\n(k) any special conditions of title in respect of each of any parcel; and\n\n(l) any other particulars which may be prescribed by rules made under section 213.\n\n(2) During the preparation of the Schedule of Alienated land, it shall be lawful for the Settlement Officer to introduce corrections, amendments and additions in respect of the following particulars relating to any parcel of alienated land, namely-\n\n(a) the spelling of names of persons and places;\n\n(b) references to survey plans and maps;\n\n(c) statement of areas;\n\n(d) diagrams of alienated land;\n\n(e) the phrasing of special conditions;\n\n(f) particulars required to give effect to subsection 40(3) or (4) and any other particulars requiring clarification:\n\nProvided that any person aggrieved by the exercise of the power aforesaid may lodge an objection thereto with the Settlement Officer during the period when the Schedule of Alienated land is open to public inspection, and such objection shall be investigated and dealt, with for all purposes, including appeal under section 102, as if it were a claim presented under section 91.\n\n90. Publication of Schedules of Alienated Land.\n\n(1) Every Schedule of Alienated land together with the appropriate survey plans shall be open to public inspection during the normal land Registry officer hours of business for a period of three calendar months at the office of the Superintendent of the division, in which the land, the subject matter of the Schedule, is situate, and copies of the Schedules shall be posted at the office of the District Officer in whose district the land is situate and at some convenient place in the neighbourhood of the land, the subject matter of the Schedule.\n\n(2) A notice to the effect that the Schedule of Alienated land has been prepared and stating the places and times at which it can be inspected shall be published in the Gazette and in such other publications as may effect the widest possible publicity, not less than fourteen days before the date on which the Schedules are first open to public inspection.\n\n91. Amendments to Schedule of Alienated Land.\n\n(1) Every person possessing any claim to a right, title, share or interest requiring and capable of registration under the this code, which has not been entered into the Schedule of Alienated land, shall present such claim to the Settlement Officer during the period when such Schedule is open to public inspection.\n\n(2) The Settlement Officer shall publicly investigate all claims presented in accordance with subsection (1) and shall have power to make a decision thereon or may, in the case of conflicting claims, permit the parties to refer the determination of the same to arbitration under the Arbitration Act 2005 [Act 646].\n\n92. Entries in Register, etc.\n\n(1) On expiry of the period of three calendar months during which the Schedule of Alienated land is open to public inspection, the Registrar shall enter in the Register all necessary particulars of each parcel specified in the Schedule of Alienated land, other than any parcel the subject matter of any dispute which has not been finally decided.\n\n(2) Where the particulars relating to any parcel of land have not been entered in the Register by virtue of the fact that a dispute in respect thereof has not been finally decided, the Registrar shall, as soon as the matter in dispute has been finally decided, make the necessary entries relating to the title of such parcel in the Register in accordance with the terms of such decision, and subsection (1) shall then apply to such title.\n\n(3) If the Settlement Officer considers that the document of title relating to any parcel of land, in respect of which particulars have been entered in the Register under this section, should for any reason be replaced by a new document of title, he shall give a certificate under his hand to the effect and upon production to him of that certificate, the Registrar shall issue an appropriate certificate in Form F in the First Schedule.\n\n93. Presentation of claims to State land.\n\n(1) All claimants to State land in the block shall appear at such time and such place as the Settlement Officer, by notice under section 88, direct.\n\n(2) Claimants may appear in person, or by advocate, or by any representative approved by the Settlement Officer and shall produce to the Settlement Officer all documents held by them, or under their control, affecting the State land which they claim. A claimant who fails to appear may submit to the Settlement Officer a statement of his claim in writing.\n\n94. Investigation of claims to State land.\n\n(1) The Settlement Officer shall investigate publicy all claims to State land, whether based upon documentary evidence, native customary tenure or otherwise, and shall have power to determine in whose favour the rights to such land shall be shown in the Settlement Order made under section 95 or may, in the case of conflicting claims, permit the parties to refer the determination of the same to arbitration under the Arbitration Act 2005. [Act 646].\n\n(2) In the case of native customary rights, the Settlement Officer may provide for the termination thereof by the payment of compensation or shall show the same in the Settlement Order and, if the rights are such as would enable a lease to be issued to the persons entitled, shall enter also all the particulars to enable a lease to be issued:\n\nProvided that, if the Settlement Officer provides for the termination of any native customary rights under this section and there is a dispute as to the amount of compensation to be paid, the Settlement Officer shall refer the matter for arbitration in accordance with section 212.\n\n[Am. by A78]\n\n(3) If, before the Settlement Order has been published as provided for in section 95, the Settlement Officer is satisfied that any person who has not presented a claim is entitled to any right to land, he may proceed as if such person had presented a claim within the time prescribed.\n\n95. Settlement Order.\n\n(1) After full investigation and final determination of all claims, the Settlement Officer shall make a Settlement Order which shall be in Form E in the First\n\nSchedule and shall contain any other particulars which may be prescribed by rules made under section 213.\n\n(2) Every Settlement Order shall be published in the Gazette, and copies thereof shall, at the same time and for a period of one month thereafter, be exhibited at the office of the Superintendent in whose division, and at the office of the District Officer in whose district, the land is situate and at any other place which may be prescribed.\n\n(3) After the publication of the Settlement Order, the Settlement Officer may by notice in the Gazette, with copies exhibited in the same manner as in the case of the Settlement Order, correct any clerical errors and make any clerical amendments or additions to the Settlement Order, as may be necessary to give effect to his decision.\n\n96. Registration of new grant or lease in respect of land specified in Settlement Order.\n\n(1) A new folio in the Register prescribed by section 112 shall be prepared for each parcel of land shown in the Settlement Order and a grant or lease, as the case may be, for each such parcel, in respect of which the Settlement Order specifies some person as the proprietor of such parcel, shall be prepared by the Superintendent and registered in accordance with section 112, and any such grant or lease shall be for such tenure and upon such conditions as may be prescribed by this code.\n\n(2) [Deleted by Ord. No 2/74].\n\n97. Representation of absentees, minors, persons under disability and others and also of members of a class.\n\n(1) Subject to any general or special direction of the * Minister, the Settlement Officer shall, after consultation with-\n\n(a) any local authority having jurisdiction over any part of the settlement area; and\n\n(b) the Probate Officer,\n\n[Am. by Ord. No 2/74]\n\n[*Modified by Swk. L.N. 68 of 1964]\n\nappoint a committee of suitable persons to advise him on any relevant system of customary law, to represent the interests of absent persons, minors, and persons under disability and to bring to the attention of the Settlement Officer any claims which may not for any reason have been presented.\n\n(2) The appointment of a committee under subsection (1) shall not without further order give such committee the right to appear before the Settlement Officer or upon any appeal, but the Settlement Officer shall take into consideration any representations made by such committee and the Settlement Officer or any court to which appeal lies may, if satisfied that there is not other person entitled to represent a party who is absent or under disability and that it is desirable to make such appointment, by order appoint such committee, or some of them, to represent such party in the proceedings before the Settlement Officer or upon such appeal, as the case may be:\n\nProvided that no appointment under this section shall render the committee liable to pay the costs of any other party.\n\n98. Exclusion of areas from Settlement Area for Native Communal Reserves.\n\n(1) After consultation with the committee appointed in accordance with section 97(1) the Settlement Officer may exclude from the provisions of this Part any area which is subject to, or likely to become subject to, section 6, and he shall forthwith submit a report on the area to the Director for submission to the Minister.\n\n[Modified by Swk. L.N. 68 of 1964.]\n\n(2) Provided that, if the part of such area to which the declaration under subsection (1) relates is comprised in a block in respect of which a notice under section 85 relates, the Settlement Officer shall-\n\n(a) amend such last mentioned notice accordingly; and\n\n(b) take all reasonable steps to inform any persons whose attendance he may have required under section 88 in connection with such part and such other persons, if any, who may have presented claims in connection with such part.\n\n99. Government rights to unclaimed land.\n\nAll land in any settlement area to which rights are not established by any claimant and registered in accordance with section 112, other than land in in respect of which a dispute has not been finally decided shall belong absolutely to the Government and shall be entered as such in the Register.\n\n100. Restriction on dealing pending settlement.\n\n(1) After publication of any notice under section 85, no dealing affecting the title to any land in the block affected by such notice, whether such dealing purports to be a disposition affecting the whole or part of the land in the title or an undivided share therein, shall be accepted for registration until after the posting of the Schedule of Alienated land provided for in section 90(1) and the expiry of the period within which an appeal may be made under section 102 or, if such an appeal is made, until such is disposed of pursuant to the said section:\n\nProvided that any such dealing may be produced to and accepted by the Settlement Officer and duly taken into consideration by him in drawing up the Schedule of Alienated land.\n\n(2) Nothing in subsection (1) shall be so interpreted as to allow registration after the date of the posting of the Schedule of Alienated land, or the extended time referred to in that subsection, of any instrument which could not be registered before that date, unless such instrument complies with the appropriate provisions of this code and contains a sufficient description of the land dealt with therein to enable the land to be properly identified.\n\n101. No claim to compensation on account of failure to locate parcel in existing Registers.\n\nNo claim to compensation shall lie, and no action shall be maintainable against the Government-\n\n(a) on account of any failure during the settlement to locate a parcel to which the record in any existing Registers, or any existing title deed, or the judgement of any court relates.\n\n(b) on account of any failure to establish any right to land which purports to be based on any record in an existing Register or an existing title deed; or\n\n(c) on account of any error in the establishment of any boundaries in the partition of any land or in the statement of any area.\n\n102. Appeal from a decision of Settlement Officer or of the Superintendent under section 18.\n\n(1) Any person aggrieved by any act or decision of the Settlement Officer, or by any decision of the Superintendent to exercise or refrain from exercising the power conferred by section 18, may, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in section 7 of the Subordinate Courts Ordinance [Act 92]* contained, appeal to the court of a Magistrate of the First Class by a petition in writing made within three months from the date of the publication in the Gazette of the Settlement Order containing the decision which is the subject of appeal or, in the case of a decision arising out of a claim investigated by the Settlement Officer in accordance with section 91(2), within three months from the date on which a copy of such decision was served on the person so aggrieved, and, for the purpose of any further appeal, any such decision made by a Settlement Officer or the Superintendent as is mentioned in this section shall be deemed to have been made in civil proceedings.\n\n[Am. by Ord. No 3/79]\n\n(2) Any court to which an appeal is made shall notify the Director of any such appeal and shall also notify the Director in writing of its decision.\n\n(3) A fee as prescribed by rules made under section 213 shall be payable on the presentation of any appeal under subsection (1).\n\n*See also sections 3 &amp; 111 of the Subordinate Courts Act 1948 [Act 92]\n\n103.

General powers.\n\nAny Surveyor or Settlement Officer or any fit and proper person authorized in writing in that behalf by a Superintendent may, at any reasonable time, enter upon all lands which he is required to mark out or survey, and upon any neighbouring land, and may make all inquiries, and may affix or set up and boundary mark in or upon such land, and dig up any ground for the purpose of so doing, and may cut down and remove any timber or other growth which may obstruct any survey line or any boundary:\n\nProvided always that as little damage as possible shall be done to the land or to any property thereon.\n\n105. Note to secure attendance.\n\n(1) Any Surveyor or Settlement Officer may cause a notice to be served on any person owning, occupying, applying for or otherwise interested in any such land and any land abutting thereon, or on any person employed on or connected with such land, requiring such person to attend before him at a time and place to be stated in the notice for the purpose of pointing out the boundaries of such land, or of rendering aid in placing or repairing the boundary marks, or of affording assistance or information for the purpose of marking out or survey.\n\n(2) Every person upon whom such notice may be served shall be legally bound to attend as required by the notice, and to do, so far as he may be able, any of the things mentioned therein. A contravention of this section shall constitute an offence: Penalty, a fine of two hundred ringgit.\n\n106. Clearing boundary lines.\n\n(1) Any Surveyor or Settlement Officer may cause a notice to be served on any proprietor or occupier of, or applicant for, such land requiring him to clear any boundary line, or to cut any line which may be necessary for the purposes of marking out or survey, or to provide labour or otherwise assist in such work.\n\n(2) Every proprietor, occupier or applicant upon whom such notice may be served shall be legally bound to comply with the requirements thereof.\n\n(3) If any proprietor, occupier or applicant fails to comply with the requirements of such notice he shall be guilty of an offence: Penalty, a fine of one hundred ringgit, any such officer may hire labour for the purposes specified in the notice, and the Superintendent may, in the proceeding before the Magistrate taking cognizance of the offence recover the cost of such labour from such proprietor, occupier or applicant.\n\n107. Compensation for injury done by clearance.\n\n(1) If it is necessary to remove or destroy any trees, fences, crops or other property of value in order to clear any line, the Surveyor or Settlement Officer shall assess the value of the same and shall pay or tender the amount so assessed to the proprietor thereof:\n\nProvided that the assessment shall be made before the property is removed or destroyed.\n\n(2) Any dispute regarding the sufficiency of the amount so paid or tendered shall, unless the proprietor requires that it be referred to arbitration, be determined by the Superintendent whose decision shall be final.\n\n108. Boundary marks to be set up.\n\nAny Surveyor or Settlement Officer may, after making due inquiry, mark out the boundaries of such land, and may, unless sufficient permanent marks of a suitable description have already been set up, cause the same to be affixed or set up in such manner and number as he may consider sufficient, and the Superintendent may recover the cost thereof from the proprietor or applicant.\n\n109. Power to re-erect and repair boundary marks.\n\nWhenever a Superintendent becomes aware that any boundary mark in his district has been injured, destroyed, removed or not properly maintained he may cause the same to be replaced or repaired, and may recover the expenses of so doing from the person who is bound to preserve such mark.\n\n110. Removal of or interference with survey and boundary marks.\n\nNo land mark, boundary mark, trigonometrical station or other survey mark shall be defaced, obliterated, moved, injured or otherwise impaired, destroyed or rendered useless, except by a person duly authorized thereto by the officer having control of such station or mark, and any person acting in contravention of this section shall be guilty of an offence: Penalty, imprisonment for six months and a fine of one thousand ringgit, and the offender may further be ordered to pay the costs of repairing or replacing such station or mark and of making any survey rendered necessary by the act for which such conviction was had, the amount to be recovered by the process provided for the recovery of fines. Should any person have occasion to require the temporary or permanent removal or alteration of any such station or mark, he may make an application in writing to that effect to the Superintendent, setting forth the reasons for such application, whereupon the Superintendent may comply with such application and shall be entitled to recover from the applicant the cost of such work as may be thereby entailed.\n\n111. Recovery of cost.\n\nWhenever it is provided in this Part that the Superintendent may recover the cost or the expenses of doing any act or thing, the same may, if not paid on demand, be sued for by the Superintendent by summons returnable before any Magistrate having jurisdiction over the recovery of debts.\n\n112. Register.\n\n(1) Every Registrar shall keep a Register in such form as may be prescribed and shall record therein particulars of all instruments, dealings and other matters required to be registered or entered on the\n\n(2) Any existing land Register under the former land Ordinance [Cap. 27 1948 Edition] or the former land Settlement Ordinance [Cap. 28 1948 Edition], hereinafter referred to as \"a previous register', shall notwithstanding any difference in form, be deemed to form part of the Register, and any instruments or other dealings affecting land in either of these registers may be registered in accordance with this code.\n\n(3) Notwithstanding subsection (2), upon the expiration of the term of a lease, Occupation Ticket or other document of title now registered in any previous register or upon the replacement of such a lease, Occupation Ticket, or document of title by a new lease or leases, whether upon a subdivision or otherwise, any new lease or leases shall, if the survey of the land has been completed to the satisfaction of the Superintendent, be registered in the Register and the prior record in the previous register shall be cancelled.\n\n(4) The Registrar may at any time, if he is satisfied as to the sufficiency of the survey of the land in any lease, Occupation Ticket or other document of title in a previous register under the former land Ordinance [Cap. 27 1948 Edition], cancel the record in that register and transfer to the Register all the necessary particulars relating to the lease, Occupation Ticket or other document of title.\n\n(5) In this section a reference to a lease shall include a grant.\n\n(6) Notwithstanding anything in this section, if registration of an estate or interest, or of any entry in a previous register, has been made otherwise than in the name of a person, or has been made in the name of a person who would not be entitled to be registered as a proprietor under this code, then that registration, and any other registration in the previous register affecting that registration, shall not form part of the Register until it has been included in the Register pursuant to an order of a competent court made under the provisions of section 224 or has, otherwise, lawfully been included in the Register; and, if by any failure to appreciate that this subsection applies or by any error or omission, the registration of that estate, interest or entry, as the case may be, is included in the Register, such inclusion shall be void and shall not for the purposes of section 119 be deemed to have been registered in accordance with this Part.\n\n113. When instruments deemed to be registered.\n\nEvery grant and lease of State land and every instrument or other dealing affecting land under this code shall be deemed to be registered under the\n\nprovisions and for the purposes of this code as soon as particulars regarding the same, together with the name of the person entitled to the interest therein, have been entered on the Register and the entry signed by the Registrar:\n\nProvided that any grant, lease or provisional lease of State land shall also be deemed to be registered as soon as one part of such grant or lease, duly completed is permanently annexed to, or forms party of, the Register.\n\n114. Provision for counterparts.\n\n(1) Whenever there is no duplicate of any instrument tendered for registration, the Registrar shall retain and file such instrument.\n\n(2) If, upon application for registration, any instrument tendered for registration has been executed in duplicate or in more parts, the Registrar shall, after retaining and filing one such part and upon payment of the prescribed fee, affix his signature to such other parts as have been executed:\n\nProvided that nothing in this subsection contained shall be construed as imposing any obligation on the Registrar to affix his signature on more parts than there are parties to the grant, lease or other instrument excluding the part retained and filed by him in pursuance of this subsection.\n\n(3) Nothing in this section shall preclude the Registrar in his discretion, in any particular case or class of case, from making an additional copy of a lease of State land or other dealing.\n\n(4) Where there is any conflict between the Register, or of any instrument retained by the Registrar pursuant to subsection (2), and the issue document of title delivered to the person entitled, the Register shall prevail.\n\n115. Registered proprietor.\n\nThe person named in any grant, lease or other instrument registered in accordance with section 113 as entitled to or taking any estate or interest shall be deemed to be the registered proprietor thereof.\n\n116.

Informal instruments not to be registered.\n\nNo Registrar shall register any instrument purporting to transfer or otherwise to deal with or affect any estate or interest in land under the provisions of this code, except in the manner herein provided, nor unless that instrument is in accordance with the provisions hereof.\n\n121.

Registration in name of deceased person.\n\n(1) The death of any person, either before or after the presentation of any instrument executed by him, shall not prevent the registration of such instrument, but such instrument may be registered and shall be valid, notwithstanding such death.\n\n(2) A lease or grant of State land, a transfer, charge or any other instrument may be registered notwithstanding that the person acquiring the interest therein has previously died, and the interest thereby acquired shall devolve in like manner as if the instrument had been registered immediately prior to the death.\n\n125.

Where the charge is wholly discharged, any caveat included therein shall cease to have any effect.\n\n(3) The duplicate of every charge wholly or partially discharged as aforesaid shall be surrendered to the Registrar to be cancelled or partially cancelled, as the case may be, unless the Registrar sees reasonable cause to dispense with this surrender.\n\n155.

As between the chargor and chargee, any amount which is eventually shown by the person entitled to the charge to have been in fact due and payable over and above the amount so paid shall continue to be a specialty debt due under the charge.\n\n(3) The Court shall order the amount so paid into Court to be paid to the person entitled upon the application of that person and on proof that the charge and all other necessary documents have been delivered to the person by whom the amount was so paid into Court or have been otherwise satisfactory accounted for.\n\n156.

When chargee becomes purchaser.\n\nWhere the chargee becomes the purchaser at a sale conducted under section 150, the amount at which the property was sold, whether that amount is the reserve price at the auction or an amount in excess thereof, shall be treated as the value of the property and, subject to any directions that may be given by the court, that value shall be adopted for the purpose of determining the amount of debt, if any, still owing by the chargor to the chargee after due allowance is made for any moneys owing by the chargor under any prior charges, if any.\n\n158. Form of sub-lease.\n\nWhen any land is intended to be subleased for any term exceeding one year, the proprietor and the sublessee shall execute for the purpose of registration a memorandum of sublease in Form L in the First Schedule, which memorandum shall give such description of the land as may be necessary to identify the same and shall refer to any entry in the Register relating thereto.

Agreements implied in subleases.\n\nIn every sublease there shall be implied the following agreements by the sublessee-\n\n(a) that he will pay the rent thereby reserved at the time therein mentioned, provided that in case the premises or any part thereof shall at any time during the continuance of the sublease be destroyed or damaged by fire, flood, storm or tempest so as to render the same unfit for the occupation and use of the sublessee, then the rent thereby reserved or a proportionate part thereof according to the nature and extent of the damage shall abate and all or any of the remedies for the recovery of the rent shall be suspended until the premises shall have been rebuilt or made fit for the occupation and use of the sublessee;\n\n(b) that he will at all times during the continuance of the sublease keep and, at the dermination thereof, yield up the premises in good and tenantable repair having regard to their condition at the commencement of the sublease, accidents and damage from fire, flood, storm and tempest and fair wear and tear excepted.\n\n163.

Agreement implied in sublease.\n\nThere shall be implied in every memorandum of sublease an undertaking by the lessor that he shall, during the continuances of the sublease, pay all rent, taxes and other charges, if any, which are payable to the Government and shall keep the sublessee indemnified against all claims and demands in respect of such rent, taxes and other charges, and in respect of any moneys payable under any charges on the property.\n\n165.

Upon the registration of a memorandum of extension, the estate of the sublessee thereunder shall be deemed to be subject to all encumbrances and other interests to which the sublease is subject at the time of the registration of the memorandum of extension.\n\n(3) The covenants, conditions and restrictions contained or implied in the sublease may be expressly varied, negatived or added to by the memorandum of extension.\n\n(4) A memorandum of extension may be registered in the same manner as the original sublease, and a certificate thereto shall be entered on the Register and on all relevant instruments.\n\n(5) If the land affected by the memorandum of extension is, at the time of the registration of the memorandum, subject to any charge, the memorandum shall not be binding on the chargee unless he has consented thereto in writing on the memorandum.\n\n167. Surrender of sublease.\n\n(1) The surrender of a sublease by agreement between the parties may be effected by endorsing thereon the word \"surrendered\" and that the endorsement, if signed by all necessary parties and attested, shall be noted on the Register and on the issue document of title, and shall thereupon operate to vest all the estate and interest of the sublessee in the lessor.\n\n(2) No sublease subject to a charge or sublease shall be surrendered without the consent of the chargee of sublessee.\n\n168. Re-entry by lessor.\n\n(1) In case of re-entry and recovery of possession of any premises held under a sublease, either by process of law or by exercise of any power of re-entry in the sublease contained or implied, the Registrar shall, upon proof to his satisfaction of the re-entry and of actual recovery of possession, notify the re-entry upon the Register and upon the issue document of title, if produced to him for that purpose:\n\nProvided that the Registrar shall require notice of the application to register the same be served upon all persons interested under the sublease or, failing such notices, shall give at least one month's notice of the application by publication in the Gazette before making any entry on the Register.\n\n(2) The estate of the sublessee shall thereupon cease and determine, but without releasing him from liability in respect of breach or non-observance of any covenant or condition in the sublease contained or implied.\n\n169.
