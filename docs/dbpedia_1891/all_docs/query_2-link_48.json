        "text": "Malaysia occupies a strategic location in Southeast Asia, split between two regions - Peninsular Malaysia and East Malaysia. Peninsular Malaysia, to the west, shares borders with Thailand to the north and is situated to the south of the Vietnamese part of the Indochinese peninsula, while East Malaysia, to the east, borders Indonesia and Brunei on the island of Borneo. The South China Sea separates these two regions. The country's total area stands at approximately 330,803 km2 (127,720 mi2), encompassing both flatlands and rugged terrains. Furthermore, running along the peninsula are numerous caves, carved out by water eroding limestone, with the Mulu Caves in East Malaysia being one of the largest cave systems in the world. In general, the coastal plains of Malaysia rise gently into hills and mountains, all covered by dense rain forests.\n\nPeninsular Malaysia constitutes the southernmost tip of the mainland Asian continent to the west of East Malaysia. This region mainly consists of the Malayan Mountain Range, running the length of the peninsula with the highest peak, Mount Tahan, reaching 2,187 m (7,175 ft) above sea level. The range primarily serves as a watershed, with rivers flowing into the Straits of Malacca to the west and the South China Sea to the east. The coastal plains adjacent to the Malacca Straits are wider and more fertile, supporting agriculture, while the eastern plains are narrower and less fertile.\n\nEast Malaysia consists of the northern part of the island of Borneo and includes the two states of Sabah and Sarawak. Sarawak has a diverse topography with swampy lowlands along the coast and hills inland, leading up to the rugged highlands towards the border with Indonesia. The highest peak in Sarawak, Mount Murud, measures 2,424 m (7,946 ft). Sabah, on the other hand, features the Crocker Range, where Mount Kinabalu, the highest peak in Malaysia and Southeast Asia, is located at a height of 4,095 m (13,435 ft).\n\nRivers and Lakes: Malaysia's major rivers predominantly run through the country's vast and fertile plains, providing essential water resources for agricultural, industrial, and residential use. The longest river in Peninsular Malaysia, the Pahang River, measures approximately 459 km (285 mi), while the longest river in East Malaysia, the Rajang River, spans about 563 km (351 mi). There are only two natural lakes within Malaysia's borders: Bera Lake and Tasik Chini. Created in 1985, Kenyir Lake is an artificial lake that is said to be the one of the largest (man-made) in the world, covering some 260 km2 (100 mi2).\n\nSeas and straits: To the west of Peninsular Malaysia lies the Straits of Malacca, one of the most significant shipping lanes in the world. The South China Sea borders the east of the peninsula, while the Celebes Sea and the Sulu Sea border Sabah in East Malaysia."
