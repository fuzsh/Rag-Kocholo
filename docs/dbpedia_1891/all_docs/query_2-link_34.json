        "text": "Sarawak has experienced the spatial inequality since the state join the formulation of Malaysia in 1963 and the state also facing a high rate of incident of poverty. The Ninth Malaysia Plan shown that spatial inequality in Sarawak has widened and needs attention. Therefore, spatial development is very important in addressing this issues in order to achieve a balance growth distribution in the state. The launching of Sarawak Corridor of Renewable Energy (SCORE) marked the shift to the new approach of development in improving the spatial inequality in Sarawak through regional development strategy. There are five growth nodes has been selected for this regional development project such as Samalaju, Mukah, Tanjung Manis, Tutoh and Baram. Samalaju will get an advantages from its strategic location due to the historical industrial background of its area namely Kidurong and it will also contribute by other factors. So, the objective of this paper is to study the potential of Samalaju Growth Node in addressing the spatial inequality in north Sarawak in the context of regional development planning in Sarawak. The result show that the growth node have a potential in addressing the spatial inequalities in north Sarawak due the historical background of Bintulu as an industrial city and other factors. ABSTRAK Sarawak telah berdepan dengan masalah ketidakseimbangan ruang dan insiden kemiskinan yang tinggi sejak menyertai pembentukan Malaysia pada tahun 1963. Rancangan Malaysia Kesembilan (2006-2010) menunjukkan masalah ketidakseimbangan ruang di Sarawak semakin melebar dan perlu diberikan perhatian. Oleh itu, perancangan dan pembangunan ruang sangat penting untuk menangani masalah ini agar matlamat pengagihan pertumbuhan yang seimbang antara kawasan di Sarawak dapat dicapai. Pelancaran Koridor Tenaga Boleh Diperbaharui Sarawak (SCORE) merupakan pendekatan pembangunan baru dalam meningkatkan ketidakeimbangan ruang melalui strategi perancangan pembangunan wilayah. Lima nod pertumbuhan utama SCORE telah dipilih dalam projek pembangunan wilayah ini seperti Samalaju, Mukah, Tanjung Manis, Tutoh dan Baram. Nod pertumbuhan Samalaju akan mendapat kelebihan dari lokasinya yang strategik kerana latar belakang industri sejarah kawasan berdekatan seperti Kidurong dan ia faktor-faktor lain. Justeru, kertas kerja ini bertujuan membincangkan potensi Nod Pertumbuhan Samalaju dalam menangani ketidakseimbangan ruang di utara Sarawak dalam konteks perancangan pembangunan wilayah di Sarawak. Dapatan kajian mendapati pusat pertumbuhan tersebut berpotensi mengurangkan ketidakseimbangan ruangan di utara Sarawak kerana faktor sejarah Bintulu sebagai bandar industri dan beberapa faktor lain.\n\nGoverning property development has always requires a holistic approach in decision making. The legislations for property development that are in placed still could not ensure the sustainability of development pertinently on highland and steep slope areas. These areas need more detail consideration and approaches specifically in the development process, implementation as well as the monitoring aspect. In lieu of that, the current planning, development guidelines and regulations have been evaluated as to examine the effectiveness of the current development mechanism in ensuring sustainable highland and steep slope development. Evidences from the case study have shown that the weaknesses lie in the decision making process, implementation and enforcement aspect of the property development process which have high influence in the property development growth and values. Besides, the study also revealed that property legislation setting should provide the implementation mechanism. Recommendations to ensure the prospect and sustainability of high land and steep slope development are emphasis on the needs in continuation of legislations and implementation procedures, monitoring actions as well as the necessity for the development players to collaborate and understand the important of sustainable development.\n\nIt is apparent that the weakness in land reclamation development in Malacca includes the incapability of the existing laws in terms of guiding the delivery of development. Additionally, the lack of comprehensiveness of the present development plan causes the inefficiency of the planning procedures for development. The paper focuses on the power of planning authorities, related laws, as well as the development control instruments in relation with development within a reclamation area. This study will directly contribute to the efficiency administration and development control system to assist the State Government of Malacca towards systematic and efficient land reclamation developments.© 2016.
