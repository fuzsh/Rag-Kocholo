        "text": "The Strata Management Ordinance 2019 (SMO 2019) in Sarawak sets out the duties, powers and responsibilities of the management bodies that are responsible for managing and maintaining buildings or lands that are subdivided into parcels and common property. These management bodies include the developer, the joint management body (JMB), the management corporation (MC), and the subsidiary management corporation (Sub-MC).\n\nThe following is the main provisions of SMO 2019 that relate to the duties, powers and responsibilities of each management body in Strata Properties:\n\nDeveloper\n\nDeveloper: During the initial period after a strata property is completed, the developer is responsible for managing and maintaining the building or land and the common property. This period is known as the Developer Management Period (DMP) and lasts until one month after the JMB is established or until the date as extended by the Commissioner of Building (COB).\n\nDuring the Developer Management Period (DMP), the developer is responsible for managing and maintaining the building or land and the common property. The developer must: - establish maintenance and sinking fund accounts, determine and collect maintenance charges and sinking fund contributions - effect insurance - enforce by-laws - prepare accounts and records, and - comply with any notice or order given by the local authority or any competent public authority\n\nJoint Management Body (JMB) and Management Corporation (MC)\n\nWhat are JMBs and MCs?\n\nJMBs and MCs are corporate bodies that have perpetual succession and a common seal. They may sue and be sued in their own name. They comprise different members depending on their stage of establishment.\n\nA JMB comprises the developer and the purchasers of parcels in a strata development. A JMB is established upon the convening of its first annual general meeting (AGM) within 12 months from:\n\nThe date of issuance of occupation permit (OP) if issued before 1st March 2022; or\n\nThe first delivery of vacant possession (VP) of a parcel to a purchaser if OP issued after 1st March 2022\n\nA JMB will cease to exist three months after the establishment of an MC.\n\nAn MC comprises all parcel owners in a strata development. An MC is established at the point when:\n\nThe developer successfully completes subdivision of buildings or lands into parcels;\n\nRelevant strata titles have been issued by Superintendent of Lands and Surveys (SLS); and\n\nAt least 25% of aggregate share units have been transferred to parcel owners excluding those owned by developer\n\nA JMB or an MC may also establish one or more subsidiary management corporations (SMCs) for different parts of a strata development, such as mixed development phases or limited common property. An SMC comprises all parcel owners who have an interest in or right over that part.\n\nHow are JMBs and MCs established?\n\nJMBs and MCs are established through different processes depending on their stage of establishment.\n\nTo establish a JMB, the developer must convene its first AGM within 12 months from commencement of developer’s management period (DMP) or first delivery of VP to a purchaser, whichever is earlier. The developer must also notify COB of the establishment of JMB within 30 days.\n\nAt the first AGM, the JMB must elect a joint management committee (JMC) to perform the duties and conduct the business of JMB. The JMB must also open and maintain a maintenance account and a sinking fund account for the purpose of collecting and spending monies for the management and maintenance of the common property.\n\nThe JMB will take over the management and maintenance of the common property from the developer upon its establishment. The developer must hand over all relevant documents, accounts, records, and monies to the JMB within one month after its establishment.\n\nTo establish an MC, the developer must file a certified strata plan with SLS within six months from:\n\nThe date of issuance of OP if issued before 1st March 2022; or\n\nThe first delivery of VP of a parcel to a purchaser if OP issued after 1st March 2022\n\nA certified strata plan is a final plan that shows the actual subdivision of buildings or lands into parcels and common property after completion of construction. It also shows the final allocation of share units for each parcel.\n\nThe filing of a certified strata plan is required by section 21 of the Strata (Subsidiary Titles) Ordinance 2019 (SSTO 2019). The developer must file four copies of Form 6 together with the prescribed fee. The SLS will then open a strata register and issue subsidiary titles for each parcel.\n\nThe opening of a strata register and issuance of subsidiary titles will result in the establishment of an MC for the strata development. The establishment of an MC will also result in the dissolution of the JMB, if any. The JMB must hand over all relevant documents, accounts, records, and monies to the MC within three months after its dissolution.\n\nAt the first AGM, the MC must elect a management committee (MC) to perform the duties and conduct the business of MC. The MC must also open and maintain a maintenance account and a sinking fund account for the purpose of collecting and spending monies for the management and maintenance of the common property.\n\nWhat are the duties and powers of JMBs and MCs?\n\nJMBs and MCs have similar duties and powers under SMO 2019. Some of these include:\n\nTo manage and maintain the buildings or lands subdivided into parcels and the common property, and keep them in a state of good and serviceable repair\n\nTo determine and impose maintenance charges and contribution to sinking fund for each parcel in proportion to their share units, and collect them from parcel owners\n\nTo establish maintenance account and sinking fund account in their own name, and deposit all monies collected into these accounts within seven working days\n\nTo effect insurance for strata development against fire and other perils according to SMO 2019\n\nTo comply with any notice or order given by local authority or competent public authority requiring abatement of nuisance, repairs, or other works on common property\n\nTo prepare and maintain a register of all parcel owners in Form 12\n\nTo ensure that accounts are audited annually by an approved company auditor and provide audited financial statements to COB within 14 days after audit\n\nTo enforce by-laws for proper management and maintenance of common property\n\nTo comply with any direction given by COB for matters connected with SMO 2019\n\nJMBs and MCs may also exercise other powers under SMO 2019, such as:\n\nTo acquire movable property for use in relation to common property\n\nTo renew or replace any fixture or fitting on common property\n\nTo upgrade or refurbish common property\n\nTo make additional by-laws or amend existing by-laws by special resolution\n\nTo appoint property managers or managing agents with COB’s approval\n\nTo apply to court or tribunal for enforcement or restraining orders relating to by-laws\n\nJMBs and MCs must perform their duties and exercise their powers in accordance with SMO 2019, SSTO 2019, HDO 2013, and any other relevant laws and regulations. They must also act honestly and in good faith in the best interests of all parcel owners.\n\nHow do JMBs and MCs operate?\n\nJMBs and MCs operate through their respective committees, which are elected by their members at general meetings. The committees are responsible for carrying out the day-to-day administration, management, and maintenance of strata developments.\n\nThe committees consist of not less than three and not more than 14 members. The members must be either parcel owners or nominees of parcel owners. The committees must elect among themselves a chairman, a secretary, and a treasurer.\n\nThe committees must hold meetings at least once every three months. They must also convene annual general meetings (AGMs) at least once every year. They may also convene extraordinary general meetings (EGMs) as necessary.\n\nThe committees must keep proper records and accounts of their activities and finances. They must also report to their members at general meetings on their performance and plans.\n\nThe committees may employ agents or servants to assist them in their duties. They may also delegate some of their powers to sub-committees or other persons as they deem fit.\n\nSubsidiary Management Corporation / Sub- MC (for mixed development phases or limited common property)\n\nWhat are Sub-MCs?\n\nSMCs are corporate bodies that have perpetual succession and a common seal. They may sue and be sued in their own name. They comprise all parcel owners who have an interest in or right over a specific part of a strata development.\n\nA specific part of a strata development may be:\n\nA mixed development phase, which is a part of a strata development that consists of parcels used for different purposes, such as residential, commercial, industrial, or institutional\n\nA limited common property, which is a part of a common property that is designated for the exclusive benefit or use of certain parcel owners\n\nFor example, in a strata development that consists of residential towers and a shopping mall, there may be an Sub-MC for each residential tower and another Sub-MC for the shopping mall. Alternatively, in a strata development that consists of apartments with different types of facilities, there may be an Sub-MC for each type of facility, such as swimming pool, gymnasium, or playground.\n\nThe purpose of establishing Sub-MCs is to ensure that different parts of a strata development are managed effectively according to their specific needs and preferences. Sub-MCs can also help to avoid conflicts or disputes among parcel owners who have different interests or rights over common property.\n\nHow are Sub-MCs established?\n\nSub-MCs are established through different processes depending on their stage of establishment.\n\nTo establish an Sub-MC for a mixed development phase, the developer must file an application with COB within six months from:\n\nThe date of issuance of OP if issued before 1st March 2022; or\n\nThe first delivery of VP of a parcel to a purchaser if OP issued after 1st March 2022\n\nThe application must include:\n\nA certified copy of the certified strata plan showing the mixed development phase;\n\nA proposed allocation of share units among parcels in the mixed development phase;\n\nA proposed budget for management and maintenance expenses for the mixed development phase;\n\nA proposed by-law for the proper management and maintenance of the mixed development phase;\n\nAny other information required by COB.\n\nThe COB will then consider the application and may approve, reject, or impose conditions on it. The COB will also notify the developer and the MC of its decision within 30 days.\n\nIf the application is approved, the developer must convene the first AGM of the Sub-MC within one month from the approval date. The developer must also notify COB of the establishment of the Sub-MC within 30 days.\n\nAt the first AGM, the Sub-MC must elect a subsidiary management committee to perform the duties and conduct the business of Sub-MC. The Sub-MC must also open and maintain a maintenance account and a sinking fund account for the purpose of collecting and spending monies for the management and maintenance of the mixed development phase.\n\nThe Sub-MC will take over the management and maintenance of the mixed development phase from the developer upon its establishment. The developer must hand over all relevant documents, accounts, records, and monies to the Sub-MC within one month after its establishment.\n\nTo establish an Sub-MC for a limited common property, the MC must pass a special resolution at a general meeting to designate a part of a common property as a limited common property for the exclusive benefit or use of certain parcel owners.\n\nThe MC must then file an application with COB within 30 days from passing the special resolution. The application must include:\n\nA certified copy of the certified strata plan showing the limited common property;\n\nA list of parcel owners who have an interest in or right over the limited common property;\n\nA proposed allocation of share units among parcels in relation to the limited common property;\n\nA proposed budget for management and maintenance expenses for the limited common property;\n\nA proposed by-law for the proper management and maintenance of the limited common property;\n\nAny other information required by COB.\n\nThe COB will then consider the application and may approve, reject, or impose conditions on it. The COB will also notify the MC and the parcel owners of its decision within 30 days.\n\nIf the application is approved, the MC must convene the first AGM of the SMC within one month from the approval date. The MC must also notify COB of the establishment of the Sub-MC within 30 days.\n\nWhat are the duties and powers of Sub-MCs?\n\nSub-MCs have similar duties and powers as MCs under Part V Chapter 4 of SMO 2019. Some of these include:\n\nTo manage and maintain their respective mixed development phases or limited common properties, and keep them in a state of good and serviceable repair\n\nTo determine and impose maintenance charges and contribution to sinking fund for each parcel in proportion to their share units, and collect them from parcel owners\n\nTo establish maintenance account and sinking fund account in their own name, and deposit all monies collected into these accounts within seven working days\n\nTo effect insurance for their respective mixed development phases or limited common properties against fire and other perils according to SMO 2019\n\nTo comply with any notice or order given by local authority or competent public authority requiring abatement of nuisance, repairs, or other works on their respective mixed development phases or limited common properties\n\nTo prepare and maintain a register of all parcel owners who have an interest in or right over their respective mixed development phases or limited common properties in Form 12\n\nTo ensure that accounts are audited annually by an approved company auditor and provide audited financial statements to COB within 14 days after audit\n\nTo enforce by-laws for proper management and maintenance of their respective mixed development phases or limited common properties\n\nTo comply with any direction given by COB for matters connected with SMO 2019\n\nSub-MCs may also exercise other powers under SMO 2019, such as:\n\nTo acquire movable property for use in relation to their respective mixed development phases or limited common properties\n\nTo renew or replace any fixture or fitting on their respective mixed development phases or limited common properties\n\nTo upgrade or refurbish their respective mixed development phases or limited common properties\n\nTo make additional by-laws or amend existing by-laws by special resolution\n\nTo appoint property managers or managing agents with COB’s approval\n\nTo apply to court or tribunal for enforcement or restraining orders relating to by-laws\n\nSub-MCs must perform their duties and exercise their powers in accordance with the SMO 2019, the Strata (Subsidiary Titles) Ordinance 2019 (SSTO 2019), and the Housing Development (Control and Licensing) Ordinance 2013 (HDO 2013), as well as any other relevant laws and regulations. This ensures that Sub-MCs operate in a fair and transparent manner, protecting the rights and interests of parcel owners and occupants in strata developments."
