        "text": "It's finally updated!\n\nThanks to Anna and Bread for type-in help.\n\nThanks to Anna, Simon, and TOP for standardisation. The source that we use now is Wikipedia.\n\nThanks to 4knowledge for Egypt map fix.\n\nThanks to Stewart for lowering the map file size.\n\nAnd finally, thanks to you for taking the quiz!\n\nFinally reached the 5 points! Got 998 with 17 countries completely guessed: USA, uk, Canada, Australia, Spain, India, Pakistan; and also New Zealand, Netherlands and Denmark which are admittedly pretty easy and a bunch of other countries that named all their divisions with the capital and/or north/south/east/west…\n\nAlmost got South Africa, Mexico, Brazil, France, Italy and Germany complete as well which is my next objective, along with having at least one division guessed in every country (missed 13 countries, though admittedly it would have been more of it wasn’t for cardinal directions and spelling luck). Amazing quiz!\n\nThis quiz breaks me\n\nAnd I know all of the countries and their capitals and can recognise their flags\n\nAnd I know most of like the biggest cities of the world\n\nThere’s a subdivision called “No”?\n\n(I was typing “north” when it gave “no” as a correct answer!”)\n\nEdit: I just got more than twenty subdivisions from typos and trying to type other subdivisions I knew!)"
