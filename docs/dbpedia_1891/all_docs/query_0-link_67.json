The definition of a city is fluid in how itâs used and perceived by people. To avoid misrepresenting a boundary, we used several data types and levels to properly capture US city and municipality boundary polygons.\n\nAdmin, level 3 = US county sub-divisions that are active governments or entities with designated officials that provide primary general-purpose functions to their residents.\n\nAdmin, level 4 = US census incorporated places (excludes Census Designated Places, or CDPs, which are only statistical).\n\nStats, level 3 = all US county sub-divisions (all serve a statistical purpose, while only some serve an administrative purpose).\n\nLocality, level 2 = this level was created to provide a one-stop location to provide what people colloquially refer to as a city in the US. It is constructed by using all US county sub-divisions as a basis, then adding all US census places (both incorporated and CDPs).\n\nCompleted a full review of all global Administrative boundaries, which resulted in recategorizing several boundaries to a statistical or legislative level as the purpose, function, or both purpose and function of those boundaries was changed by the government.\n\nv2.2â\n\nQ4 2019\n\nRelease blog post\n\nMetadataâ\n\nNew iso_3166_1_alpha_3.
