It is caused by the environmental saprophyte Burkholderia pseudomallei, a bacterium that is intrinsically resistant to many commonly used antibiotics. Its presence in Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo, has been documented, and recently, a novel gentamicin-susceptible strain discovered. However, there are limited data on the burden and clinical characteristics of melioidosis in Sarawak, both in adults and in children. In this study, we comprehensively investigated all pediatric melioidosis cases in Central Sarawak over a 6-year period. We found that this region has a very high incidence of pediatric melioidosis, and that children frequently presented with disseminated disease and had high fatality rates, despite the absence of any predisposing risk factor. We confirmed that these infections were caused predominantly by gentamicin-susceptible B. pseudomallei strains. We also highlighted other undescribed epidemiological, clinical and microbiological features, which may help in the overall understanding of B. pseudomallei infections. We emphasized the importance of improving the awareness and recognition of melioidosis in children, both in Sarawak and in other endemic regions.",

        "text": "Discussion\n\nThis study is the first detailed report of childhood melioidosis in Sarawak, and shows that B. pseudomallei infections in this region have important epidemiological, clinical and microbiological differences when compared with other melioidosis endemic regions.\n\nThe incidence rate of pediatric melioidosis in Central Sarawak (4.1 per 100,000 children), and in particular Kapit and Tatau districts (20.2 and 15.7 per 100,000 children respectively), were among the highest observed in any melioidosis endemic region, including the Malaysian states of Sabah and Pahang (0.64 and 0.68 per 100,000 children respectively) and northern Australia (5.48 per 100,000 children) [13, 14, 25]. A large study in Cambodia has also recently reported extremely high pediatric melioidosis incidences (28–35 cases per 100,000 children) [26]. In fact, the pediatric incidence rates recorded in this Cambodian study, and in the present one, are comparable to that of adult cases in northern Australia (19.6/ 100,000) and northeast Thailand (21.3/ 100,000) [27, 28], highlighting the significant and likely unrecognized burden of melioidosis in children. This underscores an urgent need to better define the global and regional epidemiology of pediatric melioidosis, as well as strengthen diagnostic capacities. Despite our findings, we believe the incidence of pediatric melioidosis in Central Sarawak remains under-estimated. Firstly, bacterial culture, the gold standard for diagnosis, lacks sensitivity [29], and may only be positive after repeated attempts. This is exemplified in Patient 9 (Table 4), who, having had negative admission blood cultures despite a prolonged illness of 14 days, developed septic shock, and succumbed 72 hours later. B. pseudomallei was only isolated from a repeat blood culture obtained shortly before she died. Second, a culture-confirmed diagnosis may have been missed in a number of patients in Central Sarawak, as selective media were not used in the study. B. pseudomallei, a slow growing bacillus, is often rapidly overgrown by the normal flora when samples from non-sterile sites are cultured using routine bacterial agar such as blood or MacConkey agar. B. pseudomallei selective media such as Ashdown media are known to increase the yield of B. pseudomallei from these non-sterile sites. Ashdown media, however, contains gentamicin, and is unsuitable for use in Central Sarawak. Alternative selective media, for instance one that utilizes colistin instead of gentamicin, should be considered, and may further enhance the detection of melioidosis cases in this region.\n\nAnother interesting finding was the marked regional variation in incidences, both in Sarawak as a whole, and within Central Sarawak. A review of the microbiology laboratory records of all major public hospitals outside of Central Sarawak revealed only 3 culture-confirmed pediatric melioidosis cases during the entire study period. In addition, a similar epidemiology is also seen in the adult population, with high melioidosis incidences confined to Central Sarawak (Personal communication, Dr. Jeffery Anak Stephen, Sarawak State Health Department, 1st April 2017). Within Central Sarawak, incidences varied widely between the different districts, despite all 3 study centers using similar diagnostic approaches. Indeed, differences in diagnostics or healthcare seeking behavior are unlikely to explain the apparent ‘hotspots’ in the adjacent districts of Kapit and Tatau, as children in Kapit district are seen in Kapit Hospital whereas those in Tatau district are seen in Bintulu Hospital (S2 Table). Thus, we believe these ‘hotspots’ of higher melioidosis incidence to be real, and not artefactual. Interestingly, a similar finding of regional ‘hotspots’ was also noted in the recent Cambodian study [26]. The reasons for these regional variations in incidences remain unknown, but may be related to differences in the local environment or in human behavioral activities and living conditions. However, there are very few differences in the behavioral activities and living conditions present throughout Sarawak, possibly indicating the existence of true ecological hotspots in Central Sarawak. Future environmental studies will be crucial in confirming these hypotheses.\n\nPediatric melioidosis infections in Sarawak did not appear to be related to rainfall, in contrast to the well-established melioidosis epidemiology in other regions [3]. Although more than half the cases were admitted during the drier months of our study, there was no statistically significant correlation between the monthly incidence and the average monthly rainfall, possibly due to the small sample size and short study period. The observed higher number of cases during the drier months may be related to the various water sources from which rural households obtain their water supply. In Central Sarawak, the primary water source for rural households are gravity-fed systems that draw water from higher-elevated streams. During the dry season, these systems are often disrupted. Households are then forced to seek alternate water sources, mainly rivers and ponds, for both bathing and drinking. These water sources and its surrounding environments may be important reservoirs of B. pseudomallei. Similar environmental reservoirs have been found in relation to pediatric melioidosis infections in Balimo, Papua New Guinea [30].\n\nPreviously published studies have shown that the majority of children with melioidosis present with localized disease [11, 26]. However, in our study, 55% of children had disseminated disease. All deaths occurred in this disseminated disease group, with a case fatality rate of 43%. This pattern has also been noted in other studies. For example, in Cambodia, deaths occurred in 72% of bacteremic and in <1% of non-bacteremic children [26]. The overall mortality rate was 24% in the present study, in comparison to 7–22% in northern Australia, Thailand and Cambodia [8, 11, 26]. Despite the high mortality seen in Central Sarawak, melioidosis remains largely neglected when compared with other infectious diseases such as dengue, receiving little attention from both the local media and health authorities. Of note, dengue infection, commonly considered the most important infectious disease in Malaysia, did not cause any deaths in children <15 years in Central Sarawak during the study period (Personal communication, Dr. Jeffery Anak Stephen, Sarawak State Health Department, 1st April 2017).\n\nIn adults, melioidosis is considered an opportunistic infection; risk factors including diabetes mellitus, renal impairment, hazardous alcohol use and immunosuppression are identified in as many as 80% of patients [31]. In children, the importance of host risk factors remain undetermined. None of the children in our study had any apparent predisposing medical conditions, a finding that was also observed in Pahang [13]. Similarly, only 3% of children in the Cambodian study had significant co-morbidity [26]. In contrast, 41% of children with melioidosis in Sabah (another Malaysian Bornean state), the majority of whom were ethnic Kadazandusuns, had β-thalassemia major, while 31% of children in Kuala Lumpur (in peninsular Malaysia) had hematological malignancies [14, 32]. Five (12%) children in our study had moderate or severe anemia at presentation (hemoglobin 6.4–7.8 g/dL). Although there were no red blood cell indices or blood films available, the likelihood that these anemias were due to β-thalassemia is low. β-thalassemia major and intermedia have never been reported in the ethnic Iban population of Sarawak [33]. The ethnic Ibans, who make up the majority of patients in our study, do not possess the β-globin gene deletion which is found in 13% of the ethnic Kadazandusuns of neighboring Sabah [34]. A limitation of the present study, however, was that patients were not investigated for α-thalassemia, as well as other occult inherited conditions, including primary immunodeficiency disorders, which may possibly predispose to melioidosis [35]. Nearly 1/3 did have poor nutritional status, as did 13% and 48% of children in northern Australia and Cambodia respectively [8, 26]. Malnutrition may thus be an important risk factor in pediatric melioidosis, and warrants further investigation.\n\nPneumonia and undifferentiated fever were the two most important manifestations of disseminated disease in Sarawak. Pneumonia, the commonest manifestation, was found in 83% of children with disseminated disease. In 1/3 of these children, the lungs had been infected as a secondary site. Although limited by a small sample size, our analysis indicates a statistical trend towards a higher risk of death in these children who had lung involvement as a secondary site. We postulate that this finding is related to increased disease severity from an extensive hematogenous dissemination that is occurring when the lungs are involved as a secondary site, evidenced by the universal presence of bacteremia and bilateral, widespread, alveolar opacities on the chest radiographs. Undifferentiated fever was the next commonest presentation of disseminated melioidosis. The high fatality rate seen with this presentation may be related to the more prolonged, untreated, disease observed in these children.\n\nChildren with localized melioidosis in Sarawak presented primarily with cervical node swelling, subcutaneous abscesses or lacrimal gland infections. These presentations highlight the intriguing regional differences in clinical manifestations of childhood melioidosis. Lacrimal gland infection, or dacrocystitis, caused by B. pseudomallei has not previously been reported. In contrast, cutaneous melioidosis and suppurative parotitis are the predominant manifestations of localized melioidosis in northern Australia and mainland Southeast Asia respectively [8, 36]. Further studies are needed to elucidate the reasons for these regional variations. Ingestion of B. pseudomallei from contaminated unchlorinated water has been suggested as a cause of parotitis in Southeast Asia [37], and may well underlie the cervical node infections seen in Sarawak. Nevertheless, other regional epidemiological and bacterial virulence differences may also be important.\n\nA delay in seeking medical attention and/or clinical diagnosis was observed in most patients in the study, and was a major contributing factor to the high fatality rate. These fatalities occurred soon after admission despite intensive care support. In northern Australia, melioidosis fatalities reduced from 30% to 9% mainly through earlier diagnosis, earlier treatment, and improved access to intensive care [31]. Thus, in Sarawak, increasing the awareness in the local community and in primary healthcare providers will also be key to improving outcomes. Melioidosis must be considered in children who have pneumonia, prolonged fever, cervical lymph node swelling or septic arthritis. In addition, the empiric antibiotics recommended for these common pediatric conditions, based on guidelines developed primarily in non-melioidosis endemic regions, may not be appropriate. For example, amoxicillin or benzyl penicillin is recommended for children with community-acquired pneumonia, while cloxacillin is recommended for empirical treatment in septic arthritis [38]. As these antibiotics have no activity against B. pseudomallei, empirical treatment with ceftazidime should instead be considered, especially in a child with suspected melioidosis and severe sepsis. However, it is also important to note that ceftazidime (a broad spectrum third-generation cephalosporin) is a potent extended-spectrum beta-lactamase inducer [39], and injudicious use as an empirical antibiotic may lead to the development of antimicrobial resistance problems in hospitals. As such, determining the regional epidemiology of B. pseudomallei and improving the understanding of the disease manifestations remain crucial.\n\nNinety-seven percent (35/36) of B. pseudomallei isolates tested were susceptible to gentamicin. We have shown previously that gentamicin-susceptible B. pseudomallei isolates in Central Sarawak are of ST881, or its single-locus variant ST997 [17]. In the current study, we determined the presence of 3 putative virulence factors, namely BimA, FhaB3, and the BTFC and YLF gene clusters [24], to find possible explanations for the distinctive clinical characteristics observed in Central Sarawak. All B. pseudomallei strains possess BimA, which confers the bacteria’s ability to move between eukaryotic cells and evade host immune responses [40]. BimA consists of two variants, BimABm and BimABp. A study in northern Australia showed that the bimABm variant found in 12% of their isolates was associated with a 14 times higher risk of neurological melioidosis, while patients infected with the commoner bimABp were twice as likely to develop pneumonia [24]. All isolates in the present study were of bimABp variant. This is consistent with the rarity of neurological disease in Sarawakian children. FhaB3 is a variably present anti-macrophage factor that similarly renders B. pseudomallei strains the ability to evade host immune responses [41]. 83% of Australian isolates possessed fhaB3, with fhaB3 positive patients twice as likely to be blood culture positive and fhaB3 negative patients more likely to have localized cutaneous disease [24]. All isolates in the present study possessed fhaB3, which may explain the high rate of bacteremia and disseminated disease seen in the study and conversely, the rarity of cutaneous disease. BTFC and YLF gene clusters are mutually exclusive in the B. pseudomallei genome, with YLF previously shown to be over-represented in clinical isolates [42]. The YLF cluster is more common in Thailand, while 79% of Australian isolates possessed the BTFC cluster, although no correlation with any clinical presentation has yet been found [24]. All isolates in the present study possessed the YLF cluster.\n\nIn conclusion, Central Sarawak has a very high incidence of pediatric melioidosis, caused predominantly by gentamicin-susceptible B. pseudomallei strains. Children frequently presented with disseminated disease and had an alarmingly high death rate, despite the absence of any apparent predisposing risk factor. Enhancing awareness and recognition of the protean manifestations of melioidosis will hopefully lead to better patient care and outcomes."
