        "text": "The role of the development concept in marketing\n\nThe consensus from all respondents is that the development concept is important in the successful marketing of township development project. An ex-general manager from a developer offered his view based on his 30 years of experience in township development that for a sizable project above 100 acres, inclusion of a distinctive theme will certainly enhance its marketability. The development concept is about creating a project's unique selling proposition. The ‘me too’ project would not work under intense competition, more so if one expects to generate above average profit. He also contends that developers should not be over-zealous about cost reduction. Many people cannot differentiate between cost-cutting and value-engineering. Indeed, he asserts that the word cost-cutting is a ‘taboo’ to him as far as property development business is concerned. The real challenge should be enhancing profit through value creation rather than mere cost-cutting. A senior manager from a reputable developer opines that good development concept is important simply because buyer's expectation on housing needs are diverse and the more affluent the society the higher the expectation in terms of aesthetics and lifestyle requirements.\n\nSimilar to those from the developers, a respondent who is a principal in a private architecture practice concurs that the development concept plays an important role in ensuring the marketability of a project. To illustrate the point, he highlights that there is a growing propensity of Malaysians in general to pursue a living lifestyle that calls for a more sustainable type of living environment such as tropical living concept with lush greenery. Consequently, modern urban living and cityscape environments are reflected in the design concept of many of his projects, of which seems very much mimicking the footage of western lifestyle. Without a good and relevant concept that matches the market needs and wants, the developers may risk losing their competitiveness in the marketplace. Another respondent who is a practicing architect and town planner put it succinctly that\n\n… developers nowadays emphasise on the development concept to ensure the marketability of their projects, other than the location of the project. The traditional mantra of ‘location, location, location’ to attract buyers is obvious but due to increasing competition in townships, the development concept differentiates each project and becomes a selling point.\n\nAnother respondent who is a principal of a quantity surveying consultancy could not be more agreeable to all the aforementioned opinions. He emphasized that a good development concept is definitely an important marketing tool. While location is the key criteria in determining the potential of a particular scheme, a well-conceived concept with enhanced accessibility can otherwise turn a scheme of only an average location advantage into a competitive masterpiece. Citing example of Desa Park City in Bandar Manjalara, the respondent accentuates that in terms of location, Desa Park City is definitely subservient to Bandar Utama. However, with its excellent park concept and unique architecture feature, it was able to rival Bandar Utama in terms of property value and market competitiveness. Although average price of housing in Bandar Utama is almost stagnant at about RM700 000 per unit, the price for similar unit in Dasa Park City is almost hitting RM700 000–800 000 per unit and is still on a rise. Another respondent who is the principle of a quantity surveying consultancy agrees that development concept is very important in the marketability of the project as purchasers search for answers to their current housing woes and changing personal/family needs lifestyle, security, green features, pleasant environment and so on.\n\nA real estate agent who has been involved in the downstream activities of property marketing for the past 15 years opined that the development concept plays a very important role in township marketing. Planned community with good security surveillance system, clubhouse facilities, well-planned pedestrian walking path and lush landscaping with strong emphasis on environmental friendly and ‘green’ concept is a necessity rather than a privilege in township development. According to another real estate agent, for up-market properties in the Klang Valley, property prices may become a secondary consideration. The customers are looking for locations that are well-served by a wide range of amenities and good infrastructure accessibility. For township within 1-hour drive time to Kuala Lumpur City Centre, the key issue is agglomeration economies rather than mere location. Citing example of the Setia Eco Park at Klang, he points out that owing to the investment in the dedicated highway connecting to the existing North Klang Valley Expressway, the otherwise less attractive location of Setia Eco Park has been witnessed to be able to be transformed into a much sought after township.\n\nFrom the interviews conducted, it is established that the ‘value creation’ strategy is far superior to ‘cost focus’ strategy in ensuring the market competitiveness of township development. Gone were the days where the developers focused on mass housing with the hope of achieving economies of scale. Selling prices were pegged relatively low against the competitors. The pressure was to seek ways and means to ‘cost down’ the design and infrastructures/amenities in order to squeeze some margins out of the tight selling prices. Return on development value might be low because of low selling prices. However, owing to low selling prices, the take-up rate was a breeze in creating the desired volume. Through the mass volume created, the absolute profits were sufficiently high to sustain the competitiveness of the business in the marketplace. The general consensus derived from the interviews was somehow seemed to be against this old strategy.\n\nThe finding suggests that for a sizable development, a theme that sets it away from the pack tends to enhance its marketability. This is because development concept is about creating a project's unique selling proposition. It is important simply because buyer's expectation on housing needs are diverse and the more affluent the society the higher the expectation in terms of aesthetics and lifestyle requirements. Without a good and relevant concept that match the market needs and wants, the developers may risk losing their competitiveness in the marketplace in no time. Developers nowadays emphasize on the development concept to ensure the marketability of their projects, other than the location of the project. The traditional mantra ‘location, location, location’ to attract buyers is obvious, but owing to increasing competition in townships, the development concept differentiates each project and becomes a selling point.\n\nSupply of land within certain preferred location is finite. Eventually, township developments have to move horizontally away from the city center. This is seen in line with the literature review in which according to Hamid (2002), the characteristics of real estate that are distinct from other commodities give rise to one unique aspect about real estate development in that the ‘project is product’ or the ‘site is factory and product’. As emphasized by Hamid (2002), development concept comprises an amalgam of product hardcore characteristics such as building architecture and layout design; the situs characteristics such as location, amenities, surrounding neighborhoods and infrastructure provisions; and economic characteristics such as selling price and after-sale services.\n\nAlthough location is the key criteria in determining the potential of a particular scheme, it was deduced from the interviews that a well-conceived concept with enhanced accessibility can otherwise turn a scheme of only an average location advantage into a competitive masterpiece. Planned community with good security surveillance system, enhanced accessibility through investment in infrastructure, clubhouse facilities, well-planned pedestrian walking path and lush landscaping with strong emphasis on environmental friendly and ‘green’ concept is a necessity rather than a privilege in township development.\n\nThe current trend in township development in Malaysia\n\nOn the question of what is the current trend in township development in Malaysia, some of the opinions expressed by the respondents are rather quite general in nature while some are more specific. As one of the respondents from the developer put it … to be successful, one has to be competitive in a market place. The more savvy players have learned to incorporate such themes as resort living, golf course town-ship or university town to attract purchasers. On the whole it is a healthy trend for it shows our consumers too have progressed. Now they crave for higher level of utility. What he was trying to explain is that the ‘rule of the game’ has changed owing to higher expectation from the public. The current trend is a testimony of changes in social-economic setting of the nation. Another respondent who is also from the developer explains more specifically that the planning and development of township in the coming trend tends to focus on incorporating green and sustainable features to suit the expectation of the consumers. Township's planning nowadays do incorporate ideas along the New Urbanism philosophy. One of the respondents caveats that the trend is also dependence on the target market, nevertheless he is of the opinion that in township development, most developers attempt towards building a self-sufficient and self-contained development, and in most instances an integrated one.\n\nAs a framework for argument, one respondent who is an architect and town planner by profession offers his broad view that the overall success of township development depends on the strength of the planning or development concept, more so with intense competition from developers. The public being better informed and exposed to development concepts by developers are also more discerning in selecting the township based on the development concepts. Increasingly, developers are turning to unique and innovative design concepts as a marketing tool. To conclude these points, a respondent who is also a fellow architect reiterates that the trend in township development as expected and demanded by the public depends on the types of potential house buyers. For instance, high-end buyers tend to look for township development with the concept of environmental friendly, lush landscaping, modern lifestyle, comprehensive security and so on. The medium-class buyers tend to go for moderate living lifestyle, greenery, recreation facilities, security and so on. On the other extreme, the low-income groups expect better ‘community and socialism context’ type of living and are less concerned about security and environmental issues.\n\nFurther interview with other respondents reveal similar opinions that the current trend in township development includes lifestyle, green, sustainability, security, connectivity, accessibility, security, connectivity, accessibility, facilities, conveniences and exclusivity. In short, the current trend of township development in essence is a self-contained community complete with good landscaping, amenities, security and lifestyle concept. Those respondents who are pretty much involved in downstream property marketing activities highlight that, of late, most developers tend to focus on pocket size development or boutique development with luxurious fittings and furnishing. They are moving towards green building standard and ecological environment.\n\nOne respondent who is a real estate agent cautions that we shall not generalize the trend. It depends on whether the development is 10 acres, 100 acres or 1000 acres in size. An urban township development could be below 10 acres in size but suburban development could reach 1000 acres and takes 10 years or more to complete. Different sizes of development have different critical success factors to consider. There is also a trend in large township developments to ‘break down’ the entire site into smaller parcels with ‘gated and guarded’ features individually. Generally, as the respondent explains, the current trend calls for modern but not too futuristic with attractive façade design and internal layout, as well as the overall master layout concept. It must also be a ‘gated and guarded’ community in view of the higher risk of theft and vandalism in currently facing the society. In addition to the above, the landscape is a very important feature to prevent the so-called ‘concrete jungle’.\n\nThe level of awareness of New Urbanism principles in Malaysia\n\nThose respondents from the development companies are generally not aware or well-informed of the jargon ‘New Urbanism’ in the first instance. However, after presenting the concept of New Urbanism to them, they reckon that the idea of New Urbanism is not something alien to the local context. They do observe that the idea of emphasizing on the design concept such as addressing the ecological issue by providing large reserve of green area, water features, self-sufficient township with complete facilities and amenities within the township and so on have been very much emphasized by the reputable developers in the country, hence, is not a new phenomenon. However, the question remains; to what degree are the principles of New Urbanism actually being adopted locally?\n\nThose respondents with background in architecture and town planning are more aware of the philosophy of New Urbanism as a urban planning movement that emphasizes on few main factors that govern the principle of the design, such as traditional neighborhood, community's living, economic's zoning, satellite's planning and so on. One respondent explains succinctly that new urbanist principles have been promoted by several groups of design professionals, mainly in the United States, to create a better neighborhood environment.\n\nGenerally, like those from the developers, respondents from other professional practices feedback that they are not aware of the jargon ‘New Urbanism’ but after reading its literature, they feel that it is not really a new thing in Malaysia. Many of those design principles as advocated in the movement have been witnessed in the country, particularly in reputable and up-market township developments by reputable developers. However, one of the respondents who is in quantity surveying practice reiterate that the New Urbanism movement generally relates to problems originating from cities getting bigger and bigger and the resulting problems thereon. Most jobs are in the cities but as the land prices keep increasing, city housing becomes more expensive and most residents get pushed out to the suburbs. Inner city decay, ghost towns at night, transportation nightmares, pollution and so on. New urbanist principles developed to resolve those issues above.\n\nThe applicability of new urbanist principles in the local context\n\nIn general, all respondents are optimistic that the philosophy of New Urbanism is applicable in the local context albeit with some caveats. As one respondent explains, any design concept adopted must be capable of maximizing the utility of the customers while at the same time achieving the company's profit goal. The new urbanist design principles are wide and comprehensive. He reckons that a thorough survey may have to be put in motion for feedbacks on the importance of each of the principles. Another respondent from a developer opines that the new urbanist principles are practical and ‘do-able’ if developers are committed and understand on the needs and expectation of potential consumers. Awareness and understanding on subject matters will support the incorporation and implementation of new urbanism principles in future development. Likewise, a respondent who is also from a development company suggests that in the local context, particularly in greenfield development, such principles should be promoted. The principles are certainly applicable universally, but in existing developed areas adaptation has to be made. After all, the principles appear to be an ideal way to develop our limited, precious and finite land resource.\n\nAn architect feels that the new urbanist principles should be applied selectively to targeted group of buyers to suit their needs of living lifestyle. He points out that low-medium income group constitutes the majority of Malaysian population and this group of people needs a healthy community type of living. Therefore, only selected principles are applicable. Another respondent who is a practicing architect and town planner cautions that the new urbanist principles are general statements of intent, which need to be incorporated physically into the master plan layout. In the local context, the new urbanist principles can be applied as long as they comply with local planning laws and regulations. Most principles can be applied but specific new urbanist principles such as ‘green transportation’ involves public transportation that depend on government policy and government support.\n\nSomewhat sharing a same sentiment, a respondent who is a practicing quantity surveyor caveats that while new urbanist principles seem applicable locally, their specific application has to be dependence on location. With his years of experience in doing cost estimate and feasibility study for developers, he foresees that the construction will be higher based on the new urbanist design principles. As such, the selling price also has to be higher to commensurate with the higher cost.\n\nHenceforth, the applicability of new urbanist principles may be only confined to Klang Valley and such other developed areas in which the purchasing power of the populace is envisaged to be higher. He illustrates his point by quoting Desa Park City in Bandar Manjala as an example where the concept of New Urbanism can probably be observed, the success of which is supported by premium selling prices. A fellow practicing quantity surveyor summarizes that in the local context, all or most of those principles are applicable but the extent or emphasis depends very much on developer's marketing plans and strategies in relation to their own projects/development land. Respondents who are involved in the downstream activities of marketing believe that the ideas (New Urbanism movement) are good and people may welcome it and love to stay in this type of development, particularly among the medium-income group. They feel that some of the principles are very practical particularly in regard to walkability and connectivity, which are very much the panache in mixed development. This may help create a wonderful and convenience sanctuary for the residents and occupants.\n\nThe conclusion derived from the interviews is that there are potential applications of new urbanist principles to the local context particularly in greenfield development. After all, the principles appear to be an ideal way to develop our limited, precious and finite land resource. However, one has to be selective and critical in the application. The new urbanist principles are general statements of intent that need to be incorporated physically into the master plan layout. In the local context, the new urbanist principles can be applied as long as they comply with local planning laws and regulations. Evaluating from the perspectives of professionals and practitioners, the potential application of new urbanist principles to township development in Malaysia are subject to the following parameters:\n\n1\n\nApplication shall be selective based on the targeted group of buyers to suit their needs of living lifestyle. Low-medium income group constitutes the majority of Malaysian population and this group of people needs a healthy community type of living. Therefore, only selected principles are applicable.\n\n2\n\nMost principles can be applied but specific new urbanist principles such as ‘green transportation’ involves public transportation that depend on government policy and government support.\n\n3\n\nThe specific applications of new urbanist principles are dependence on location. The expected construction cost is envisaged to be higher based on the new urbanist design principles. Consequently, the selling prices also have to be higher to commensurate with the construction cost. In this respect, the applicability of new urbanist principles may be only confined to such developed areas in which the purchasing power of the populace is envisaged to be higher.\n\n4\n\nAll or most of those principles are applicable but the extent or emphasis depends very much on developer's marketing plans and strategies in relation to their own projects/development land.\n\nFrom the survey conducted on the ranking of the significance of various new urbanist principles based on Likert scale, the following are the results obtained where Band 1 is being most significant in contributing to the marketability of a township development and Band 8 being the least:\n\nBand 1::\n\nQuality of life\n\nBand 2::\n\nConnectivity and sustainability\n\nBand 3::\n\nWalkability; quality architecture and urban design; and green transportation\n\nBand 4::\n\nTraditional neighborhood\n\nBand 5::\n\nMixed-use and diversity\n\nBand 6::\n\nMixed housing\n\nBand 7::\n\nIncreased density\n\nThe ranking of significance is organized into various ‘Bands’ because there are a number of principles that scored the same Relative Index (RI) in the analysis. Looking beyond the quantitative figures, a few controversial issues were revealed from the interview as summarized as follows:\n\nNot all the 10 principles are applicable locally. Notably, only those that fall within Band 1–Band 4 are of potential applications locally from the marketing point of view.\n\nThe social stigma that may otherwise associate with high density development. Good living environment is normally associated with quite and serene living surrounding free from busy economic activities and traffic noise. While increased density leads to economies of scale to sustain the commercial component of the development as advocated in the New Urbanism concept, the ‘not-in-my-backyard (NIMBY)’ phenomenon among the urban dwellers is not uncommon.\n\nLow cost provision in mixed housing is a good concept from social point of view; however, because of social stigma, some may not prefer low cost housing to be located in the vicinity of high cost housing.\n\nIn general, New Urbanism appears more suitable for medium to medium high cost development. In its purest form, new urbanist movement seems to cater more to the average general public rather than the elite society that constitutes a totally different sector from the marketing point of view. Hence, in up-market development, only selected principles are applicable.\n\nLast but not least, there is an issue pertaining to quality of life. It should be regarded as the outcome of the combination of all the other new urbanist principles rather than a principle, therefore, should not be included in the list. Quality of life should be viewed as a function of an amalgam of product hardcore characteristics such as building architecture and layout design; the situs characteristics such as location, amenities, surrounding neighborhoods and infrastructure provisions; and economic characteristics such as selling price and after-sale services offered by the developers.\n\nRanking of the importance of key new urbanist principles\n\nDuring the interview, the respondents were asked to rank the significance of the following 10 key new urbanist design principles in contributing to the success of a township development in Malaysia based on the scale of 1–10, where 1 is the most significant and 10 is the least.\n\n1)\n\nWalkability\n\n2)\n\nConnectivity\n\n3)\n\nMixed-use and diversity\n\n4)\n\nMixed housing\n\n5)\n\nQuality architecture and urban design\n\n6)\n\nTraditional neighborhood structure\n\n7)\n\nIncreased density\n\n8)\n\nGreen transportation\n\n9)\n\nSustainability\n\n10)\n\nQuality of life\n\nHowever, it was not necessary for the respondents to rank each and every one of the above based on descending order. In other words, they might group a few of the attributes under the scale of 1 if they feel that they were of equal importance and could not be separated. They might also single out those attributes that they feel were not relevant.\n\nThe feedbacks were transformed into a Likert scale with the range from 1 to 5 in an ascending order where 1=Not significant; 2=Less significant; 3=Neutral; 4=Significant; and 5=Most significant. Table 3 shows the equivalent of the ranking used in the interview vis-à-vis the Likert scale. Summarized in Table 4 are the results obtained.\n\nIt was expected not all respondents would provide their opinion with regard to the ranking owing to their busy schedule. However, it was hoped that data collected would be sufficient for study and analysis through the two methods suggested, those being Frequency Analysis and Relative Index (RI).\n\nFrequency analysis, which depends on the percentage of respondents giving the same answer, was adopted in this study to measure the degree of agreement for the significance of the various new urbanist principles to township development in Malaysia. The formula is denoted below:\n\nwhere n is number of respondents; N is total number of respondents received.\n\nTo evaluate the ranking of the significance of each design attributes to the success of the township development, the rating made against the five-point scale described previously was combined and converted into relative significance indices for each attribute, adopting the RI ranking technique (Kometa et al, 1994). This determined the relative ranking of the different attributes by comparing the individual value of the relative significance indices for each attribute. The highest ranking referred to the highest RI value.\n\nThe individual numerical rating of each of the identified attributes (from the Likert scale) was transformed to relative factors, by using the following formula:\n\nwhere n1 is number of respondents for ‘Not significant’; n2 is number of respondents for ‘Less significant; n3 is number of respondents for ‘Neutral’; n4 is number of respondents for ‘Significant’; n5 is number of respondents for ‘Most significant’; and N is total number of respondents.\n\nThe result of the analysis is tabulated in Table 5. On the basis of the analysis, the respondents agree that the most significant attribute is quality of life, which gives a RI of 0.880. It is then followed by connectivity and sustainability, both with an RI of 0.780. Following behind are walkability; quality architecture and urban design; and green transportation; all of which fair at a RI of 0.720. The bottom 50 per cent of the score are made of traditional neighborhood structure (RI 0.640); mixed-use and diversity (RI 0.629); mixed housing (RI 0.580); and increased density (RI 0.540).\n\nOne of the developer respondents was of the opinion that all the new urbanist principles are excellent and need to be continually promoted by both authorities and development organizations. He suggests that concerted efforts, continuous education and creation of awareness in the public in this area are certainly required to ensure more wide-spread success. In this light, he ranks all the principles of equal importance and significance. Another respondent who is an architect maintains that only six of the 10 principles are applicable locally. Citing example of Singapore, he opines that community planning concept should also be included as one of the principles as it has been successfully proven in contributing to healthy environment, social obligation and society’s environment.\n\nSome respondents point out to three controversial issues in the new urbanist principles, which are increased density, provision of low cost housing and quality of life. The first issue is with regard to increased density. While increased density leads to economies of scale to sustain the commercial component of the development, the ‘NIMBY’ phenomenon among the urban dwellers is not uncommon. On one hand, people love to have good amenities in the neighborhoods but on the other hand they want a quiet and serene living environment free from economic activities and traffic.\n\nSecond, low cost provision is a good concept from social point of view; however, because of social stigma, some may not prefer low cost housing to be located in the vicinity of high cost housing. In general, this respondent feels that New Urbanism is more suitable for medium to medium high cost development. It caters more to the general public rather than the elite super rich that constitutes a totally different sector from the marketing point of view. The third issue is pertaining to quality of life. Some of the respondents point out that quality of life should not be included as one of the principles. It should be regarded as the outcome of the combination of all the other new urbanist principles. Therefore, the quality of life should be viewed as a function of an amalgam of product hardcore characteristics such as building architecture and layout design; the situs characteristics such as location, amenities, surrounding neighborhoods and infrastructure provisions; and economic characteristics such as selling price and after-sale services offered by the developers. On the basis of the list of principles provided, the respondents are of the opinion that quality of life should be singled out. It is an outcome rather than a principle.\n\nAnother respondent who is a real estate agent cautions that one should not generalize the applicability of new urbanist principles. It depends on individual lifestyle. Some yuppies may love to have shopping malls and shops located just at a walking distance from their residence or apartment. The middle age group may prefer housing location of at least a couple of kilometers away from the busy commercial hub in order to enjoy family life in a peaceful environment after a long-day work. The affordable ones or those above 40s may want to stay at a peaceful and quite zone yet not too far from the commercial zone. All these boil down to individual preference and economic affordability."
