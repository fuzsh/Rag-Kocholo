This chapter examines native customary land rights in Sarawak and the government's strategy of using trusts for commercial development of these lands. It provides background on the land classification system and evolution of land legislation. Traditionally, native communities had rights to cultivate land and use jungle resources. The government now places native customary lands into trusts for joint ventures with corporations for large-scale agriculture. However, the chapter argues stronger protections may be needed given that past policies reduced native land rights and impacts of development on their livelihoods and culture.",
