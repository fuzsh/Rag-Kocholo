        "text": "Introduction\n\nIn biology, classification is the process of arranging organisms, both living and extinct, into groups based on similar characteristics. The science of naming and classifying organisms is called taxonomy. The term is derived from the Greek taxis (“arrangement”) and nomos (“law”).\n\nTaxonomists classify organisms into a structural hierarchy—a multi-level system in which each group is nested, or contained, within a larger group. Groups at the highest level are the largest and most general and contain a wide variety of living things. These groups are divided into smaller groups of similar organisms. Each smaller group is split into even smaller groups, which contain organisms with even more similar features: For example, a large group that includes all plants would contain smaller groups of that contain similar types of plants, such as trees, bushes, mosses, flowering plants, and so forth. Each of these groups would contain still smaller groups; for example, the tree group might be divided into conifers and broadleaf trees.\n\nEach group in biological classification—that is, each level in the hierarchy—is called a taxon (plural, taxa).The most basic taxon is the species, a group of closely related organisms that can breed and produce offspring that in turn can reproduce.\n\nScientific Names\n\nOrganizing large amounts of information in a standardized way makes it easy to locate information and to communicate it to others. Scientists use an internationally accepted system for classifying and naming organisms. The system is based on the classification method introduced in 1758 by Carolus Linnaeus, a Swedish botanist regarded as the founder of modern taxonomy.\n\nThe Linnaean system assigns each species a two-part scientific name composed of Greek or Latin words. The first part of the scientific name is the organism’s genus, a taxon that includes closely related species. Wolves, dogs, coyotes, and jackals are all members of the genus Canis. Conventionally, scientific names are always italicized or underlined, and the genus name is always capitalized.\n\nThe second part of the scientific name is called the species name, and it is particular to each species in the genus. The species name of the coyote is latrans; that of the gray wolf is lupus. The species name is always written in lowercase and italicized.\n\nTogether, the genus name and the species name comprise the scientific name of the species. Thus, the coyote’s scientific name is Canis latrans; the gray wolf’s name is Canis lupus. The two-part scientific name is sometimes called a binomial—from the Latin words bi-, meaning two, and nomen, meaning name.\n\nUsing scientific names helps scientists avoid the confusion that can arise when referring to an organism by its common, or everyday, name. For example, the name robin may refer to the European robin or to the American robin, or even to any of several other birds; however the robins’ scientific names—Erithacus rubecula and Turdus migratorius (European robin and American robin, respectively)—clearly identify the species being referenced. The scientific names show that the birds are distinct species and verify that they are not closely related, since each belongs to a different genus.\n\nLevels of Classification\n\nThe classification system commonly used today is based on the Linnean system and has eight levels of taxa; from the most general to the most specific, these are domain, kingdom, phylum (plural, phyla), class, order, family, genus (plural, genera), and species. (For plants, the term division is generally used instead of phylum.) Each level is contained, or nested, within the level above it. For example, a genus contains one or more species; a family contains one or more genera; an order contains one or more families; and so on. The domain is the highest level of organization and is the largest group.\n\nFollowing are overviews of each taxonomic level in modern biological classification. (For a detailed description of domains and kingdoms, see “Classification of Living Things” in the article living things.)\n\nDomain\n\nThe domain is the highest rank in biological classification. There are three domains—Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya. The Archaea and the Bacteria each contain prokaryotes (single-celled organisms that lack a true nucleus) but differ in structural, genetic, and biochemical characteristics. The domain Eukarya contains eukaryotes—organisms whose cells contain a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles.\n\nKingdom\n\nBefore the domain taxon was introduced during the 1990s, the kingdom ranked as the highest taxonomic level in classification. Most scientists today recognize six kingdoms: Archaea (prokaryotes with distinct cellular characteristics that adapt them to extreme environments, such as deep-sea vents and hot springs); Bacteria (prokaryotes that are not archaeans); Protista (chiefly protozoa and algae); Fungi (mushrooms, molds, and yeasts); Plantae (plants); and Animalia (animals). The kingdoms Archaea and the Bacteria each constitute a separate domain. The Protista, Fungi, Plantae, and Animalia all belong to the domain Eukarya.\n\nPhylum\n\nThe phylum (plural, phyla) ranks below the kingdom and above the class in taxonomy. Scientists generally use the term phylum for archaea, bacteria, protists, fungi, and animals, but they substitute the term division for plants.\n\nOrganisms are classified in a phylum or division based largely on general body plan. For example, members of the Phylum Arthropoda have external skeletons, segmented bodies, and jointed legs. Insects, crabs, and arachnids are examples of arthropods. A muscular foot and a soft unsegmented body that may or may not be covered with a shell are hallmarks of the Phylum Mollusca; familiar mollusks include mussels, snails, and clams. Animals of the Phylum Chordata have an internal skeleton and a backbone or notochord (a primitive backbone). Fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals (including humans) are in this group. (See also vertebrate.)\n\nClass\n\nThe class ranks below the phylum and above the order in taxonomy. Members of a class share more characteristics with each other than they do with other organisms in the same phylum. Amphibians and reptiles both belong to the Phylum Chordata, but each belongs to a different class. Members of the Class Amphibia (chiefly frogs, toads, and salamanders) have moist, smooth skin and reproduce by laying large quantities of jellylike eggs in water. Members of the Class Reptilia (snakes, lizards, turtles, and tortoises) reptiles have dry scaly skin and reproduce by laying small clutches of leathery eggs on land.\n\nOrder\n\nThe order ranks below the class and above the family in the taxonomic hierarchy. The groups in an order have more in common with each other than they do with other members of the same class. Because reindeer (caribou) and whales both belong to the Class Mammalia, they share the basic traits of mammals, such as feeding milk to their young; however, each belongs to a different order. Reindeer are part of the Order Artiodactyla, which includes cloven-hoofed mammals; cows, pigs, antelope, and giraffes are fellow artiodactyls. Whales belong the Order Cetacea, a marine mammal order that counts porpoises and dolphins as members.\n\nFamily\n\nIn taxonomy, the family ranks below the order and above the genus. Members of the same taxonomic family are more closely related to each other than they are to other members of the same order. For example, foxes, coyotes, lions, cats, otters, and weasels all belong to the Order Carnivora. However, foxes and coyotes belong to the family Canidae. Lions and cats belong to the family Felidae; otters and weasels are part of the family Mustelidae.\n\nGenus\n\nThe genus (plural, genera) is the taxonomic rank between family and species. The groups of organisms in a genus share many structural similarities and are very closely related. Members of a genus are more closely related to each other than they are to other genera in the same family. The cat family, Felidae, includes lions, tigers, ocelots, domestic cats, bobcats, and lynx. However, lions and tigers belong to the genus Panthera, ocelots and domestic cats are part of the genus Felis, and lynx and bobcats are in the genus Lynx.\n\nSpecies\n\nThe species is the most fundamental unit in taxonomy and ranks at the base of the biological classification hierarchy. Members of the same species share the same evolutionary history and are more closely related to each other than they are to any other organisms, including other members of the same genus. Organisms are grouped into a species based on physical and genetic similarities. All members of a species have the same number of chromosomes.\n\nThe most important factor in species classification is the ability of members to successfully interbreed—that is, to mate and produce viable offspring (those that can in turn breed and produce more offspring). Individuals of the same species can successfully interbreed with one another but almost never with members of other species. Different species within a genus have been known to produce hybrid offspring, but the offspring are almost always sterile. An example of this is the mating of a horse and a donkey, which produces a mule. Because mules are sterile, the interbreeding is not considered successful.\n\nEach species has its own scientific name, composed of the genus name and species epithet. The lion’s scientific name is Panthera leo, whereas the scientific name of the tiger is Panthera tigris.\n\nSome species include groups with such distinctive traits that they are classified as subspecies; in these cases, a subspecies name is added to the end of the species name. Subspecies of Panthera tigris include the Siberian tiger (Panthera tigris altaica) and the Indian, or Bengal, tiger (Panthera tigris tigris).\n\nChanges in Classification Systems\n\nIn Linneaus’s time, scientists characterized organisms as either plants or animals. Linnaeus followed this general rule, dividing all living things into two kingdoms—the Kingdom Plantae (plants) and the Kingdom Animalia (animals). His system was later modified by other scientists, especially as advances in microscopy revealed key differences among organisms at the cellular level. For example, Linneaus classified fungi and algae in the plant kingdom. When later scientists noted key differences in the cell structures of these groups, algae and fungi were reclassified in different kingdoms.\n\nOver time, the Linnean classification system was expanded, first to three kingdoms and then to four. By the 1960s, scientists had organized living things into five kingdoms—the Monera (bacteria), Protista (protozoa and algae), Fungi (mushrooms, yeasts, and molds), Plantae (plants), and Animalia (animals). The five-kingdom system was widely accepted and used for many years.\n\nIn the late 1970s, American microbiologist Carl Woese reported on several key genetic differences he had observed in prokaryotes. Woese’s findings led scientists to split the Kingdom Monera into two kingdoms—the Bacteria and the Archaea. The six-kingdom system has been the standard used in taxonomy since the 1990s. Woese further proposed a major change in classification by placing all organisms into three domains—Eukarya, Bacteria, and Archaea—to reflect their three separate lines of evolution."
