        "text": "In 2007, Mr Howard Limbert and Ms Deb Limbert – leading the members of The British Vietnam Cave Expedition Team came to Phong Nha and did some research and surveys of caves in the area. Based on the analysis of limestone topography, river systems and faultlines., Howard predicted that there was a very large cave after the exit of Hang En but he did not know the exact location of the cave. In a talk with Howard, Mr Ho Khanh coincidently mentioned the cave entrance that he accidentally saw with strong winds, dense fog and the loud sound of a roaring river echoing coming from the cave. Howard and Deb were very excited and urged Ho Khanh to try to remember the location and the way to where this cave is located.\n\nAdmiring the enthusiasm of Mr Howard and his team members, Ho Khanh diligently searched for the mysterious cave many years later. Supposed to be forgotten, in 2008, on another trip to the wood, Ho Khanh was lucky to find the location of the cave entrance. He carefully memorised the location and map the route to get to the cave entrance in his mind by orienting the mountains and trees. When he returned, he then tried to find a way to contact the expedition team.\n\nOn April 07, 2009, Howard Limbert led a caving expert team in collaboration with the Geography Department of Hanoi University of Science to survey the cave. The first person stepping inside Son Doong was Peter MacNab, a member of The British Vietnam Cave Expedition Team. This was also the first time Ho Khanh went inside the cave. During this expedition, they determined that this is the world’s biggest cave, in Vietnam with its own ecosystem. Ho Khanh and the cave expert team discussed and decided to call the cave Son Doong (A combination of 2 words: Son means mountain, Doong is the name of the valley where the Bru-Van Kieu ethnic minority people have lived since 1992 and it is where Thuong River comes from). Since then Son Doong Cave has become known around the world and has become a famous cave in Vietnam.\n\nDissolved carbon dioxide makes rain and river water weakly acidic, which allows the water to dissolve limestone, eroding it over millions of years. The tropical rainfall, wide fault lines and thick limestone beds have enabled the creation of a huge tunnel beneath the mountains. There were places where the cave ceiling was too thin, causing collapses and forming the dolines, and creating the magnificent Son Doong Cave as it is today. The length of Son Doong cave is nearly 9 km, at some points, the height is up to 200m and the width is 160m, large enough to accommodate 40-storey buildings. With a volume of 38.5 million cubic metres, Son Doong surpassed Deer Cave in Malaysia to become the largest natural cave in the world. The formation of Son Doong is still ongoing. Please find out more information about the geology and geomorphology in Son Doong at this link.\n\nAn underground river flows in the cave, which is home to many species of fish, which are developed to adapt to the eternal darkness of the cave. Up to now, in Son Doong Cave, biologists have found more than 7 new species of animals, including some species of fish, woodlice, millipedes, spiders, and scorpions... with the same feature of no eyes and transparent bodies.\n\nSon Doong Cave has a very large volume that can accommodate skyscrapers, there are wide sections enough for a Boeing to fly through besides streams, waterfalls, and a primaeval forest. With such a huge size, Son Doong has its weather system, the temperature is around 22 to 25 degrees Celsius in summer and 15 to 20 degrees Celsius in winter. It is always lower than outside from 8 to 12 degrees Celsius in the summers due to the effect of lack of sunlight, damp atmosphere and difference in air pressure, causing airflow.\n\nWith those unique features, mother nature has created a very interesting ecosystem inside Son Doong cave that is nowhere else. You can learn more about the ecosystem inside Son Doong Cave here.\n\nDuring the survey of Son Doong, cave experts found that the underground river disappeared into a flooded passage below Doline 1, about 4.5km from the entrance. They suspected this river would connect to Thoong (Thung) Cave 600m away. In 2019, Howard Limbert and Martin Holroyd, with Chris Jewell, Rick Stanton, and Jason Mallinson (who participated in the rescue of a child soccer team trapped in Tham Luong cave, Chiang Rai, Thailand) dived to a depth of 78m and found an underwater cave passage. Due to a lack of equipment for diving deeper, they decided to stop the survey and announced they had found an underwater passage found at 60m and descending to 78m with no end in sight. If they could find the connection between Son Doong and Thung Cave, Son Doong's volume would increase by 1.6 million metres. Son Doong - the massive cave in Vietnam still contains many mysteries that are waiting for explorers to discover. Please learn more about the survey of the underground river inside Son Doong in 2019 here. It is expected that in March 2023, the cave diving expedition led by Mr Howard Limbert, including John Volanthen and Martin Holroyd will continue."
