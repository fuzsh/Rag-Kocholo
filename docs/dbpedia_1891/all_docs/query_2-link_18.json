        "text": "The principal legislation governing all land matters in Malaysia is:\n\nNLC, which is the principal land law governing all land matters in Peninsular Malaysia (including the Federal Territories of Labuan);\n\nNational Land Code (Penang & Malacca Titles) 1963;\n\nSarawak Land Code (Cap 81); and\n\nSabah Land Ordinance (Cap 68).\n\nPursuant to the Federal Constitution of Malaysia, land matters generally lie within the jurisdiction of the State Authority of each State in Malaysia (“State”). Each State has enacted its own subsidiary land legislations, such as various land rules, enactments, and ordinances to supplement the operation of the principal legislation mentioned above.\n\nOther than the States, land matters relating to the three federal territories of Kuala Lumpur, Putrajaya, and Labuan fall under the purview of the Federal Government.\n\nIn addition to the above statutes, there are other legislations that govern specific land matters such as:-\n\nStrata Titles Act 1985 (which governs and facilitates the subdivision or stratification of buildings or land into parcels); and\n\nStrata Management Act 2003 (which regulates the maintenance and management of strata buildings and common property).\n\n1. Generally, alienated land in Peninsular Malaysia may be transferred freely (to non-foreigners) unless expressly restricted by a restriction-in-interest on the issued document of title.\n\n2. For foreigners acquiring property, the NLC provides that prior approval of the relevant State Authority must be obtained before acquiring the title or interest in any real property in Peninsular Malaysia.\n\n3. Pursuant to the Guideline on the Acquisition of Properties (“EPU Guideline”) issued by the Economic Planning Unit (“EPU”), the EPU’s approval is required for real property transactions resulting in the dilution of Bumiputera interest or government agency in real property as follows:\n\n(a) Indirect acquisition of real property through acquisition of shares where:\n\n(i) the transaction results in a change in control of the company owned by Bumiputera interest and/or government agency;\n\n(ii) real property makes up more than 50% of the said company’s assets; and\n\n(iii) the real property is valued at more than MYR 20 million.\n\n(b) Direct acquisition of real property where:\n\n(i) there is a dilution of Bumiputera or government interests in real property; and\n\n(ii) the property is valued above MYR 20 million.\n\nThe following are defined under the EPU Guidelines:\n\n(i) “Foreign interest” means a person who is not a Malaysian citizen, or a foreign incorporated company or a local incorporated company with 50% or more of its equity interest held by a Malaysian citizen or a foreign incorporated company\n\n(ii) “Bumiputera interest” means any interest, associated group of interests or parties acting in concert comprising:\n\n(A) a Bumiputera individual (a Malay individual or aborigine as defined under the Federal Constitution);\n\n(B) a Bumiputera institution and trust agency; or\n\n(C) a local company or institution where the parties stated above hold more than 50% of the voting rights in that local company or institution.\n\n(iii) “Government agency” means the statutory bodies, non-listed government linked companies, government linked investment companies including their subsidiaries\n\n4. If the acquisition (whether direct or indirect) will result in the dilution of Bumiputera interest or government agency, the approval of EPU will be granted subject to:\n\n(a) an equity condition requiring the foreign entity to have of at least 30% Bumiputera interest shareholding; and\n\n(b) the paid-up capital of the foreign entity shall be at least MYR250,000.\n\n5. That said, the EPU Guidelines contain certain exemptions whereby the approval of the EPU will not be required. Certain key exemptions include:\n\n(a) Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) status companies are allowed to acquire any property in the MSC area provided that the property is only used for their operational activities including as residence for their employees;\n\n(b) Acquisition of properties in the approved area in any regional development corridor by companies that have been granted MSC status by the local authority as determined by government; and\n\n(c) Acquisition of industrial land by a manufacturing company.\n\n6. Additionally, as land matters fall within the purview of the relevant State Authority, each State also has specific policies restricting the acquisition of land by foreigners, which vary from State to State. Further, foreigners are generally restricted from directly acquiring agricultural lands in Peninsular Malaysia under the policies of the States.\n\nGenerally, an owner or occupier will not inherit liability for matters relating to the property before purchase or occupation unless otherwise agreed. Typically, the owner or occupier will only be liable for the matters relating to the property bought or occupied by them from and including the date they take vacant or exclusive possession.\n\nHowever, an owner could inherit liability prior to their acquisition by operation of law in certain circumstances. For example, where there is a breach by the previous legal owner which continues after the property is bought over by a new owner, of any of:\n\nCondition of title\n\nEnvironmental requirements\n\nBy way of example, the land registry/land office may require the current owner to comply with specific conditions of title and the Malaysian Department of Environment may require the current owner to clean up contamination even if the owner had not caused the contamination."
