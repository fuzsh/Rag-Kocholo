        "text": "Development administration is a very broad concept because its approach is meant to be used to understand the system of public administration in a country. However, the concept of development itself covers many areas such as social development and physical development. The focus of discussion in this paper is presented in the context of physical development that centres on real estate development in Sarawak. This paper is important because it also looking at centralization processes being done by the State Authorities in the aspect of land development in Sarawak. In order to sustain the discussion on the administrative aspect of this real estate development, it will be studied in detail via the allocation of development, and the method and process of how the said development is undertaken. There are several factors that influence the development plan of properties in any particular area, such as factors of politics, history, urbanization, interaction of resources, type of soil, location, and so on. To overcome the side-effects which would occur in the development of a particular area there is a need for controls to be done or taken by the parties concerned. Among some of the development controls that are taken are controls from the legal aspect and from the process of obtaining development approvals. In addition to that, the other parties involved in the process of property development in Sarawak are the State Planning Authority, Land and Survey Department, the local authorities and other technical agencies. Thus, the balancing effect in the process of the development administration itself will lead to the achievement of sustainable development which is also an important factor in ensuring that the planned development will be beneficial to all parties and that it will ensure equilibrium in the environment in order to preserve it. This paper is formed conceptually because emphasis is given to the aspects of the administration of property development that is practiced in Sarawak. Hopefully this paper may able to solve the problems faced during planning and controlling stages in Sarawak."
