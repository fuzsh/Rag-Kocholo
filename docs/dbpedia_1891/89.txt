It's finally updated!

Thanks to Anna and Bread for type-in help.

Thanks to Anna, Simon, and TOP for standardisation. The source that we use now is Wikipedia.

Thanks to 4knowledge for Egypt map fix.

Thanks to Stewart for lowering the map file size.

And finally, thanks to you for taking the quiz!

Finally reached the 5 points! Got 998 with 17 countries completely guessed: USA, uk, Canada, Australia, Spain, India, Pakistan; and also New Zealand, Netherlands and Denmark which are admittedly pretty easy and a bunch of other countries that named all their divisions with the capital and/or north/south/east/west…

Almost got South Africa, Mexico, Brazil, France, Italy and Germany complete as well which is my next objective, along with having at least one division guessed in every country (missed 13 countries, though admittedly it would have been more of it wasn’t for cardinal directions and spelling luck). Amazing quiz!

This quiz breaks me

And I know all of the countries and their capitals and can recognise their flags

And I know most of like the biggest cities of the world

There’s a subdivision called “No”?

(I was typing “north” when it gave “no” as a correct answer!”)

Edit: I just got more than twenty subdivisions from typos and trying to type other subdivisions I knew!)
