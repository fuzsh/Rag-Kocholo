        "text": "Music recording certifications are typically awarded by the worldwide music industry based on the total units sold, streamed, or shipped to retailers. These awards and their requirements are defined by the various certifying bodies representing the music industry in various countries and territories worldwide. The standard certification awards given consist of Gold, Platinum, and sometimes Diamond awards, in ascending order; the UK also has a Silver certification, ranking below Gold. In most cases, a \"Multi-Platinum\" or \"Multi-Diamond\" award is given for multiples of the Platinum or Diamond requirements.\n\nMany music industries around the world are represented by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI). The IFPI operates in 66 countries and services affiliated industry associations in 45 countries.[1] In some cases, the IFPI is merely affiliated with the already operational certification bodies of a country, but in many countries with lesser-developed industries, the IFPI acts as the sole certifying body servicing the country or region's music industry. Still other countries not represented by the IFPI have certifying bodies operating independently, such as individual record companies which service the country or region's music industry as a whole.\n\nThough all certifying bodies give awards for album sales or shipments, many also certify singles, paid digital downloads, streaming media, music videos, music DVDs, and master ringtones. Additionally, some certifying bodies have separate threshold scales for works of domestic or international origins, varying genres, lengths, and formats. From the 2010s digital streaming was included in some territories.\n\nAlbums\n\n[edit]\n\nNote: Top numbers represent threshold for domestic material, italicized numbers in parentheses represent threshold for international material if different from the domestic requirement. Other notes and exceptions are provided in footnotes below each table.\n\nThresholds of certification for albums, by country or territory Country/\n\nTerritory Certifying body Thresholds per award
