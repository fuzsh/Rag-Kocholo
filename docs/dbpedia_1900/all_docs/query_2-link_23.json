        "text": "BTS has just made history in Japan!\n\nEarlier this year, the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) implemented a new certification system for online streaming of songs, as an addition to its pre-existing certification systems for physical album shipments and digital download sales. According to the new system, songs are certified silver once they reach 30 million streams, gold at 50 million streams, and platinum at 100 million streams.\n\nIn its latest batch of certifications (dated November 2020), the RIAJ officially awarded BTS’s smash hit “Dynamite” a platinum certification in the streaming category after the song surpassed over 100 million streams in just three months. Although BTS has previously received platinum certifications from the RIAJ for physical albums, this latest achievement marks the first time that one of their songs has been certified platinum for streaming.\n\nAdditionally, “Dynamite” is now the first song by any foreign group in RIAJ history ever to receive a platinum certification for streaming—and only the second overall song by a foreign artist, following Ed Sheeran’s “Shape of You” (which went platinum last month).\n\nBTS also racked up two gold certifications for “DNA” and “Stay Gold,” each of which surpassed 50 million streams, as well as a silver certification for “Your Eyes Tell,” a Japanese song that was co-composed by Jungkook.\n\nMeanwhile, TWICE also earned several new certifications in the streaming category, extending their record as the foreign artist with the most songs that have received official streaming certifications from the RIAJ.\n\nThe group’s hits “What is Love?” and “YES or YES” were both officially certified gold, while their Japanese song “Candy Pop” went silver after surpassing 30 million streams.\n\nCongratulations to BTS and TWICE on their impressive achievements!\n\nSource (1)\n\nRecommended Watch:\n\nWhat are Cookies?\n\nWhen you visit any web site, it may store or retrieve information on your browser, mostly in the form of cookies.
