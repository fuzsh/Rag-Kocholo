        "text": "The RIAA is an acronym for the Recording Industry Association of America. The RIAA is the trade organization that supports and promotes the creative and financial life of major music companies in the United States. The Recording Industry Association of America awards records which sell at significant numbers. So I thought that I would explain in more detail what the RIAA certifications represent and the history behind these awards.\n\nGOLD certifications are for albums and singles for sales of 500,000 or more.\n\nGold certifications began in 1958 and were originally for sales of 1,000,000. The certification was later lowered to 500,000 where it still stands today. Gold certs are marked by a small circle next to the title of the album or song.\n\nPLATINUM certifications are for albums and singles for sales of 1,000,000 sales or more.\n\nPlatinum certs began in 1976. Platinum certifications are marked by a small triangle shape next to the song or album title.\n\nDIAMOND certifications are for sales of albums or singles of 10,000,000 or more. This began in 1999. This is represented by you guessed it a diamond shape next to the title.\n\nHistory of the certifications\n\nIn the 1950s, records were selling in the millions with the advent of Rock N’Roll. Records were sold in LP (Long Play), full length album format and the 7″ vinyl single. 7″ vinyl singles were very popular especially with America’s youth. The recording industry of America wanted to award artists in all musical genres a special recognition for selling over a million albums. The RIAA began a program to award musicians which would be Gold certifications. This achievement would induct musicians into an elite club for their efforts. The intentions were not necessarily altruistic. The RIAA certifications help the music industry keep track of which artist is a big seller and the number of hits each artist has achieved.\n\nThe very first Gold Award went to Perry Como’s hit single, “Catch a Falling Star”, on March 14, 1958. On July 8, 1958 the first Gold album was awarded to the “Oklahoma!” soundtrack. Gold albums and singles originally were awarded for sales of 1,000,000 copies sold.\n\nGold singles were originally signified with these odd looking symbols on some of the earlier charts.\n\nThere are also times where singles and albums were already certified Gold upon entering the charts. This was due to advanced sales of the song or albums before entering the chart. There were also times when a record was already certified for 1,000,000 + shipments to retail stores.\n\nPlatinum awards began in 1976. Platinum certs were awarded to albums which have sold over 1,000,000 copies. Gold certifications for albums were lowered to 500,000 copies sold starting in 1975. The first Platinum album went to the Eagles Greatest Hits (1971-1975).\n\nFor singles, they had to do a little more work. Gold certifications remained at sales of 1,000,000 copies. Platinum singles were for sales of 2,000,000 copies.\n\nStarting in 1984, the RIAA awarded records for multi platinum status. This rewarded artists who have sold millions of copies. Multi-Platinum albums would be indicated by a small number next to the platinum symbol.\n\nOn January 1, 1989, the requirements for Gold and Platinum singles were revised. The RIAA decided to lower the requirements for the status. Gold single status went down to 500,000 copies sold and Platinum was lowered to 1,000,000 copies sold. It has been this way ever since.\n\nRIAA Certifications in Modern Times\n\nIn 1999, the RIAA began Diamond certifications. Diamond certs were for albums and singles which have sold over 10,000,000 copies. With the inception of the Diamond certification, many albums which were previously big sellers from were eligible for the Diamond certification. These included albums such as: The Beatles “Sargent Peppers Lonely Heart Club Band”, Led Zeppelin “Physical Graffiti”, Michael Jackson’s “Thriller” and many more well known albums and singles.\n\nDigital Certifications\n\nBy the early 2000s, music downloading became a new way to purchase music. It came in the form of MP3s and later MP4s. Paid downloading sites such as iTunes, Rhapsody, Musicmatch, and Roxio were established to purchase MP3s. The RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America) extended the Gold and Platinum awards designation for paid digital downloads from the internet, which had the title of Digital Gold and Digital Platinum. This took effect in late 2004. The certification level was 100,000 downloads for Gold, 200,000 for Platinum and Multi-Platinum status beginning at 400,000. Retail sales remained the same. The RIAA changed the certification standards to match retail distribution in August 2006 (500,000 for Gold and 1,000,000 for Platinum). All Platinum and Multi-Platinum awards for a digital release were withdrawn for late 2004 up to August 2006. Gold certifications, however, were not, meaning a song that was downloaded over 100,000 times and certified so by the RIAA during that time frame retains its Gold status.\n\nHow people purchase music has changed especially with digital downloads dominating musical tastes. Vinyl records have made a comeback while sales of CDs are on the decline. However, Billboard Magazine has reported recently that overall sales of albums have sunk to a historic low. RIAA certifications have retained the same criteria and still caries the same honor."
