By returning to first principles and creating an enforceable new intellectual property right, the legislation lays the foundation for free market negotiations that will propel both innovation and safety forward in AI, not just for artists but for everyone,\" shared RIAA Chairman & CEO Mitch Glazier. Read more about how this act sets the stage for safe and innovative AI advancements. https://bit.ly/46rRdOa\n\nThe Human Artistry Campaign (a coalition of over 200 entertainment organizations) officially endorsed the NO FAKES Act that was just officially introduced today in the U.S. Senate. This legislation, importantly, would create an enforceable new federal intellectual property right allowing victims of nonconsensual deepfakes and voice clones to have them quickly taken down and recover damages. Yes, a rare bipartisan bill. And glad to see Senator Amy Klobuchar from my original great state of Minnesota, once again, helping to lead the charge on behalf of the Creative Community! https://lnkd.in/gitJ7NiS #ai #artificialintelligence #nofakes #media #entertainment #hollywood #humanartistrycampaign\n\nHappy National Intern Day! üéâ We‚Äôve been incredibly fortunate to have phenomenal interns this summer semester.

Thank you Leanna Scachetti for having us! #TeamRIAA\n\nToday, the Recording Industry Association of America¬Æ (RIAA) is reinforcing its commitment to protect artists and their creative works. We have filed significant copyright infringement lawsuits against Suno AI and Udio AI for using copyrighted sound recordings without permission. \"Unlicensed services like Suno and Udio that exploit artists' works without consent or compensation hinder genuine innovation,\" states RIAA Chairman and CEO Mitch Glazier. \"These are straightforward cases of copyright infringement involving unlicensed copying of sound recordings on a massive scale. Suno and Udio are attempting to hide the full scope of their infringement rather than putting their services on a sound and lawful footing,\" states RIAA Chief Legal Officer Ken Doroshow Read more about our efforts to safeguard artists' rights and promote responsible AI development in our official press release: https://bit.ly/3xwZBio\n\nCelebrating the Recording Industry Association of America¬Æ (RIAA) certification of ‚ÄúWhat A Wonderful World‚Äù with RIAA Awards and Wynton Marsalis, Managing and Artistic Director of Jazz at Lincoln Center and President of the Louis Armstrong Foundation üé∫ Today we are thrilled to announce the Recording Industry Association of America¬Æ (RIAA)‚Äôs historic 5x Platinum certification of ‚ÄúWhat A Wonderful World,‚Äù marking the original recording‚Äôs cumulative US sales of more than 5 million since its first release in 1967.
