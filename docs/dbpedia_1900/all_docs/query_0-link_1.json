Her debut album, These Words, was released independently in the United States in early 2000 and was sung entirely in English.[1] After returning to Japan in 2003, Aki followed this with a Japanese-language extended play, One, released under Virgo Music in 2005.[2][3][4]\n\nGame musician Nobuo Uematsu offered Aki the chance to sing the theme song for the game Final Fantasy XII after hearing one of her demos in 2003.[2] Aki made her major debut under the Sony Music Japan sub-label Epic Records Japan in 2005 with the single \"Home\" and released the Final Fantasy XII theme song \"Kiss Me Good-Bye\" in 2006.[5] Her debut album, Home (2006), was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of Japan.[6]\n\nHer most commercially successful singles were released between 2006 and 2008: \"This Love\" (2006), which was used as an ending theme song for the anime Blood+, \"Sakurairo\" (2007), and \"Tegami (Haikei Jūgo no Kimi e)\" (2008), which was the compulsory song learnt by junior high choirs for the 2008 Nationwide Contest of Music sponsored by NHK.[5] \"Sakurairo\" has been certified gold twice by the Recording Industry Association of Japan, while \"This Love\" and \"Tegami (Haikei Jūgo no Kimi e)\" have been certified multi-platinum.[7][8][9][10] Aki's second and third albums, Today (2007) and Answer (2009), both debuted at number one on the Oricon albums chart.[11][12] For the fifth anniversary since her major-label debut single \"Home\", Aki released White (2011), an album composed of a mix of new songs, re-recordings, and covers.[13] In 2012, Aki released Songbook, a collection of Western music covers from her discography that she had performed on her NHK Educational TV television show Angela Aki no Songbook in English.[14]\n\nAfter releasing her first greatest hits album Tapestry of Songs: The Best of Angela Aki in 2014, Aki took an indefinite hiatus from music in Japan, moving to the United States to enrol in a music school to learn how to write musicals.[5]\n\nStudio albums\n\n[edit]\n\nList of albums, with selected chart positions Title Album details Peak positions Sales (JPN)[15][A] Certifications
