        "text": "Like LiSA, Aimer is definitely one of the biggest Japanese female singers of this generation. Aimer’s name is French and means “to love”.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, Aimer’s father was a bassist in the band so she was always surrounded by music. She started to play music in elementary school. At the age of 15, Aimer lost her voice due to vocal cord overuse and underwent silence therapy for treatment. After she recovered, she acquired her distinctive husky voice.\n\nSince Aimer’s debut in 2011, she has released six studio albums, all of which made it into the top 20 of the Oricon Albums Chart, with fourth album Daydream being certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of Japan. Her 2021 song “Zankyōsanka” became her first song to reach the top of the Japan Hot 100 chart, selling 87,649 downloads in its first week. It also charted at number 37 on the Billboard Global 200, marking her first appearance on the chart!\n\nI personally haven’t watched most of the shows listed below, so I first noticed Aimer when I watched Fire Force in 2021. I then noticed her when she appeared in One OK Rock’s documentary “Flip A Coin”. I later fell in love with her Demon Slayer song “Zankyou Sanka”. Imagine my surprise when I saw that she had over 20 anime songs, and is almost hitting 30! I think that is the most out of any artist I’ve covered so far, so definitely take a moment to get familiar with this amazing and talented artist.\n\nIf you’d like to discover other Japanese music and artists, check out my playlists on Youtube!
