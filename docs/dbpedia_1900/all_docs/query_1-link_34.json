        "text": "In the new methodology, 1,500 streams will count as the equivalent of 10 track sales or 1 album sale.\n\nThis means that the RIAA is retroactively awarding 17 different album titles with gold or platinum certifications. Among the newly platinum albums: Kendrick Lamar's \"To Pimp a Butterfly,\" Hozier's self-titled album, and Coldplay's \"Ghost Stories.\"\n\nNicki Minaj has been one of the most vocal proponents of counting streaming toward an artist's sales and certifications. She announced that her most recent album, \"The Pinkprint,\" had gone triple platinum including streaming (officially, it hadn't even gone platinum) and faced a lot of criticism online.\n\nWhile Minaj was not one of the artists given a new album certification Monday, it looks like the industry is only moving further her way."
