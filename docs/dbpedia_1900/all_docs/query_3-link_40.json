        "text": "IMPALA SALES AWARDS\n\nThe European Sales Awards promote independents and their artists on the basis of pan-European sales at different points in the success spectrum.\n\nThe IMPALA Awards are the first sales awards which recognise that success on a pan-European basis needs to be acknowledged on different levels. They celebrate the fact that success begins well before sales reach 1 million (the only pan-European sales level officially recognised before IMPALA launched its own scheme). The IMPALA Awards are intended to provide a new tool for independent music companies and artists to promote themselves, both domestically and internationally. They also recognise new talent and cultural diversity, and the fact that in order to promote cultural diversity in a meaningful and practical way, success needs to be celebrated at a much earlier point in an artist’s career than when they reach 1 million sales.\n\nOver 950 albums have now been registered for the IMPALA Sales Awards, representing more than 100 million units sold and €1.5bn in revenue.\n\nLevels and Conditions\n\nThese awards are open, not only to Europe based independent record companies, but also to independent record companies situated outside Europe, providing the CD, track, single etc. has reached the number of shipments below in Europe. Please note that digital consumption also counts, local rules can be used to covert as appropriate. There is no release date restriction on the sales awards.\n\nThe Award categories are (note that digital consumption also counts, please use local rules to covert):\n\nIMPALA Silver 20 000\n\nIMPALA Double silver 40 000\n\nIMPALA Gold 75 000\n\nIMPALA Double Gold 150 000\n\nIMPALA Diamond 200 000\n\nIMPALA Platinum 400 000\n\nIMPALA Double Platinum 800 000\n\nAll shipments, made at any time, to anywhere in Europe can be counted in the number of shipments claimed for an award providing they are included in the qualifying territories list. This can include home territory and/or any other European territories. Note, as mentioned above, that digital consumption also counts, please use local rules to covert).\n\nPublication\n\nIMPALA compiles a list of releases for which an award is claimed via the IMPALA website. It is possible to certify shipments for an award and be included in this list (by submitting part A of the certification form). The list will be published every quarter and will also be posted on the IMPALA website. You may also go on to complete part B of the form to order the physical award to offer to your artist, the producer, etc.\n\nAward orders\n\nAward winners can order the IMPALA award. It is presented in a glass case containing the CD and cover, the IMPALA sales award stamp “in recognition of ‘x’ sales in Europe” and a personalised printed plaque with the title of the recording, the artist and the name of the record company releasing the record, plus the name of any intended recipient.\n\nIMPORTANT: To mount the award the agent needs the corresponding number of copies of the actual CD and the released CD cover.\n\nPrices\n\nFor prices, visit the award registration page. You will receive a confirmation by e-mail of the order, the inscription to be put on the personalised plaque and the amount of the invoice. Payment is to be made to the agent handling the orders on behalf of IMPALA. The agent will send the invoice together with the award(s) ordered. The agent will endeavour to deliver your order within two to three weeks.\n\nQualifying territories\n\nEU\n\nAustria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden\n\nEEA\n\nIceland, Lichtenstein, Norway\n\nOther European countries\n\nAlbania, Armenia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Georgia, Israël, Kosovo, Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, Russia, Serbia, Switzerland, Tunisia, Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom"
