        "text": "Sheldon Rocha Leal, PhD\n\n·\n\nFollow\n\n8 min read\n\n·\n\nMar 18, 2017\n\n--\n\nby Sheldon Rocha Leal\n\nI’m a big chart watcher and album sales figures fascinate me. What fascinates me the most is the fact that an artist can so unanimously appeal to the social conscious that people will go out on mass to purchase their album and even more fascinating, in the album’s first weeks of release. In order to attain this level of success an act really needs to be in tune with what is happening on society, what audiences want, whilst remaining true to their brand and music. It’s a tough juggling act.\n\nAfter having observed the charts for many years, I have noticed a few trends regarding the way in which people buy albums. There are a few times in which album sales spike:\n\nThe first few weeks after the initial release of an album (that’s obvious);\n\nChristmas time: in the lead up to Christmas album sales increase exponentially;\n\nGrammy time: in the week after the Grammy ceremony album sales increase;\n\nAfter the death of a major celebrity, people seem to go out in droves to purchase an artist’s past catalogue, almost as a way to show respect to the artist or maybe as a way to hold on to something from their past.\n\nFor me, one of the things I really forward to is seeing how an album fares, with regards to sales, in its first week. After observing sales trends for many years I started noticing that some artists shift such large quantities of albums in their first week, that they attract an immediate certification. Normal artists will usually take a protracted time before their albums are certified, gold, platinum or diamond, but the sales of these mega albums are so large that they obtain instantaneous certifications. In order for an album to attract a certification, they need to sell a certain number of units. In the USA, for example, there are three major categories:\n\nGold: 500,000\n\nPlatinum: 1,000,000\n\nDiamond: 10,000,000\n\nIt is clear, therefore, that all of the artists, in the list that follows attain Platinum status in their first week of sales in the USA alone, if sales were limited to the USA. With album sales dropping, fewer artists are achieving these targets. That being said, there are still some artists that attain the USA platinum benchmark in the first week of release. This just goes to prove that if one produces something people want, audiences will go out and buy it, in droves.\n\nWithout further ado, here are the Top38 biggest opening weeks, for an album, in music history (the focus of this article):\n\n1. Michael Jackson: Bad (1987) 7 million (global sales)\n\n2. Adele: 25 (2015) 5,706,000 (global sales)\n\n3. Michael Jackson: Dangerous (1992) 5 million (global sales)\n\n4. The Backstreet Boys: Black and Blue (2000) 5 million (global sales)\n\n5. Elvis Presley: Elv1s 30 #1 Hits (2002) 4.7 million (global sales)\n\n6.

Taylor Swift: The Tortured Poets Department (2024) 3,353,000 (global sales)\n\n12. Hikaru Utada: Distance (2001) 3,002,720 (Japanese Sales)\n\n13. Ayumi Hamasaki: A Best (2001) 2,874,870 (Japanese Sales)\n\n14. Eminem: The Marshal Mathews LP (2000) 2.8 million (global sales)\n\n15. BTS: Proof (2022) 2,752,000 (South Korean Sales)\n\n16. B’z: The Best “Pleasure” (1998) 2,709,530 (Japanese Sales)\n\n17. BTS (Bangtan Boys): Map Of The Soul-Persona (2019) 2,514,000 (global sales)\n\n18. B’z: The Best “Treasure” (1998) 2,500,120 (Japanese sales)\n\n19. BTS: Be (2020) 2,444,000 (global sales)\n\n20. *Nsync: No Strings Attached (2000) 2,416,000 (US sales)\n\n21. Britney Spears: Oops!…I Did It Again (2000) 2.4million (global sales)\n\n22. Hikaru Utada: Deep River (2002) 2,350,710 (Japanese Sales)\n\n23. Mai Kuraki: Delicious Way (2000) 2,218,640 (Japanese sales)\n\n24. Stray Kids: Maxident (2022) 2,185,000 (South Korean Sales)\n\n25. Blackpink: Born Pink (2022) 2,141,000 (global figures)\n\n26. Taylor Swift: Midnights (2022) 2,125,000 (global figures)\n\n27. SEVENTEEN: Face The Sun (2022) 2,067,000\n\n28. Hikaru Utada: First Love (1999) 2,026,870 (Japanese sales)\n\n29. Glay: Review (1997) 2,003,150 (Japanese sales)\n\n30. Taylor Swift: Folklore (2020) 2 million (global sales)\n\n31. Taylor Swift: Reputation (2017) 2 million (global sales)\n\n32. Eminem: The Eminem Show (2002) 2 million (global sales)\n\n33. *Nsync: Celebrity (2001) 1,983,000 (US, UK, Canada and Japan first-week sales)\n\n34. Namie Amuro: Sweet 19 Blues (1996) 1,921,850 (Japanese sales)\n\n35. Lady Gaga: Born This Way (2012) 1,921,000 (global sales)\n\n36. Ed Sheeran:➗(2017) 1,789,000 (global sales)\n\n37. Ayumi Hamasaki: I Am (2002) 1,751,360 (Japanese sales)\n\n38. Led Zeppelin: In Through The Outdoor (1979) 1.7million (global sales)\n\n39. Taylor Swift: 1989 (2014) 1,681,000 (global sales)\n\nSo these are the 39 biggest first weeks in the rock era. It has now reached a point that if an artist wants to be eligible for the Top 20 they need to have shipped over 2.4 million units in one week. To break into the Top 10 an act needs to ship at least 3,5million units. At one stage a 2million debut week would have been a tall ask, but now 32 albums have achieved this feat, most of them in the new millennium. It is also interesting to note that female artists dominate the Top 39, with 16 positions occupied by solo female artists. Seven solo male artists occupy placements and the remaining 16 positions are occupied by bands.\n\nTaylor Swift has placed 6 albums in the Top 39, BTS have placed 4, whilst Utada Hikaru has placed 3. Michael Jackson, *Nsync, Eminem, SEVENTEEN, Ayumi Hamasaki and B’z have each placed two albums on the list. Another interesting fact is that Asian artists, mainly from Japan and South Korea, have placed 19 albums on the list, indicating a growing worldwide appetite for Asian music and exhibiting their dominance on the list. Additionally, 16 acts are from the USA, whilst three positions are occupied by British artists. It will be interesting to see if anyone will be able to challenge the records that currently stand. I for one would be interested to see who would be able to beat Michael Jackson’s astounding 7 million unit achievement. All we can now do is wait and see…\n\nDisclaimer: Whilst all attempts were made to secure worldwide first-week sales for all the albums listed in this article, sometimes only first-week sales figures from one country were available at the time this article was published. Whilst this is not ideal, the albums for which I could not obtain worldwide figures, after further investigation, were not really big outside their country of origin, therefore, the quoted sales accounted for the majority of their worldwide sales in their debut week. This also goes to prove how overwhelmingly popular these albums were, that they were able to make it onto this list, based purely on the sales from one country, whilst other albums needed worldwide figures to qualify for the list"
