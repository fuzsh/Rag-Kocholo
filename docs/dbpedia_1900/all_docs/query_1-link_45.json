        "text": "Post by ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡² dollybaby ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡² on\n\nAfrodisiac turns 15 today!! It was released on June 28, 2004. What are your fave tracks from the album? Mines are Who Is She 2 U, Should I Go, and Talk About Our Love.\n\nUpon release, the critical response to Afrodisiac was highly positive, eventually garnering critical acclaim for its mature lyrics, Brandy's vocalizing, and its overall experimental sound. The album has been called a predecessor to alternative R&B, having been cited as an influence by artists such as Rihanna and Solange. Afrodisiac was nominated for several awards including nominations at the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards and the 47th Annual Grammy Awards. The album debuted at number three on the US Billboard 200, eventually earning a gold certification by the RIAA. Internationally, Afrodisiac scored minor success, appearing on the top 40 album charts in the UK, Canada, and Japan. The album spawned three singles â€” \"Talk About Our Love\", \"Who Is She 2 U\" and \"Afrodisiac\".\n\nAfrodisiac debuted at number three on the US Billboard 200 behind Lloyd Banks' solo debut The Hunger for More and Usher's Confessions album, and at number four on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, selling more than 131,700 copies in its first week.Though sales soon declined and the album fell short off the upper half of the Billboard 200 in its eighth week, it was eventually certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America for more than 500,000 copies shipped to stores, including 417,000 sold copies. In international music markets, Afrodisiac failed to reach the top thirty on the majority of the charts it appeared on except China, Japan and Switzerland where it managed to debut within the top ten and number twenty-six, respectively. In the United Kingdom, the album was awarded a silver certification by the British Phonographic Industry on September 24, 2004 based on a sales total of 60,000 copies.\n\nTalk About Our Love: #36 Hot 100, #2 Dance, #16 R&B\n\nWho Is She 2 U: #85 Hot 100, #2 Dance, #43 R&B\n\nAfrodisiac: #11 UK, #1 UK R&B"
