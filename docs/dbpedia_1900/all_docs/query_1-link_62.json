        "text": "Yeah, I was really excited to get that 2008 Japan Love Letters due to the four single mixes it contains, but the sound quality leaves quite a bit to be desired due to the EQ emphasis of the high-end frequencies.\n\nThere's a few other titles in that series with the 45 mixes, including Something for Everybody (There's Always Me and Judy), and some with undubbed versions:\n\nエルヴィス・プレスリー紙ジャケット・コレクション\n\nI am in total agreement with you on the greatness of those two songs and performances. They really are rather hidden gems as well, despite the fact that I'm Leavin' actually hit #2 on the Billboard Easy Listening chart, which was no small matter at the time. Since its foundation, that format, which later become known as the Adult Contemporary format, has always been one of the top two or three radio formats in the United States, but its success is often dismissed by rock enthusiasts. I'm Leavin' also hit a pretty respectable #23 on the British singles chart, so it was slightly more successful than some people give it credit for being at the time. Once again, a good song gets buried and not placed on a proper studio album at the time of its initial release. I believe it was considered one of the \"lost\" singles when RCA put it on the Silver box set in 1980, if I am remembering it correctly.\n\nElvis's voice does indeed show a haunting fragility as @mark winstanley so well points out in his fine post. I just love the dramatic change in tempo as that is a technique that I always find intriguing. Glen Spreen once again is back to do a stellar string arrangement, and I also dig Jerry Carrigan's \"I ain't backing down for nobody\" drumming that Peter Guralnick spoke about in his autobiography on Elvis. Just a terrific record and vocal all around to my ears.\n\nC'MON EVERYBODY (LP)\n\n(US) RCA Camden CAL 2518\n\nReleased: July 1971\n\nC'mon Everybody is a compilation album by American singer and musician Elvis Presley released by RCA Records on July 1, 1971.[2] The album was certified Gold on January 6, 2004 by the Recording Industry Association of America.[3]\n\nAll tracks from C'Mon Everybody originated from four of Elvis's films and were only released on soundtrack EP's prior to this issue. The remaining EP tracks from the same four movies were compiled into another budget RCA Camden album, I Got Lucky, released three months later.[4]\n\nSide one\n\n1. \"C'mon Everybody\" (from Viva Las Vegas) Joy Byers July 9, 1963 2:18\n\n2. \"Angel\" (from Follow That Dream) Sid Tepper, Roy C. Bennett July 2, 1961 2:38\n\n3. \"Easy Come, Easy Go\" (from Easy Come, Easy Go) Ben Weisman, Sid Wayne September 28, 1966 2:10\n\n4. \"A Whistling Tune\" (from Kid Galahad) Sherman Edwards, Hal David October 26, 1961 2:38\n\n5. \"Follow That Dream\" (from Follow That Dream) Fred Wise, Ben Weisman July 2, 1961 1:3\n\nSide two\n\n1. \"King Of The Whole Wide World\" (fromKid Galahad) Ruth Batchelor, Bob Roberts October 27, 1961 2:07\n\n2. \"I'll Take Love\" (from Easy Come, Easy Go) Dolores Fuller, Mark Barkan September 28, 1966 2:13\n\n3. \"Today, Tomorrow And Forever\" (fromViva Las Vegas) Mack David, Sherman Edwards July 2, 1961 3:25\n\n4. \"I'm Not The Marrying Kind\" (from Follow That Dream) Ben Weisman, Fred Wise October 27, 1961 1:50\n\n5. \"This Is Living\" (from Kid Galahad) Bill Giant, Bernie Baum, Florence Kaye July 11, 1963 1:43\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis album, and particularly when it was released, is just kind of weird. It is a good collection of songs, and we have already been through them all.\n\nIt seems like and album of essentially early sixties songs released in the early seventies just seems somewhat confusing. On one hand you can instantly hear how different Elvis' musical style was between the two eras, and on the other you can hear how different the production and arrangement is different between the two eras. I don't dislike it, but as I say, it just seems a little weird.\n\nI am very interested to hear from those who were around at the time of release about their knowledge of how well known was it, about what was going on with the releases and how surprising was it to get a new album that was all quite old material? Was this release schedule confusing fans, in the ages before mass online media information.\n\nFor an album like this, I'm interested in everyone's opinions obviously, but please, if you were around at the time of release, please let us know all the feelings, and circumstances etc of what the general feeling was about this kind of release. I know we have talked about the Camden releases and the agenda of releasing songs hat never made it onto LP's, but the further we get from the recording date, the stranger it seems.\n\nAnyway,\n\nFill us in on the details guys.\n\nCheers\n\nMark"
