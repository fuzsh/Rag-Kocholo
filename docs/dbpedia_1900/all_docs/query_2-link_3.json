        "text": "In a groundbreaking achievement, singer-songwriter Kenshi Yonezu's hit track \"KICK BACK\" has struck gold with the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). This marks a historic moment as the very first song with Japanese lyrics to achieve gold certification from the association.\n\n\"KICK BACK\" served as the opening theme song for the popular anime \"Chainsaw Man.\" Co-arranged alongside Daiki Toneda of King Gnu, the song was released on October 12, 2022, and quickly won the hearts of listeners. It made history by securing the 47th position on Spotify's \"Top 50 - Global\" daily song ranking, establishing Kenshi Yonezu as the first Japanese artist to achieve this milestone.\n\nThe RIAA, responsible for recognizing gold and platinum achievements in the U.S., acknowledged \"KICK BACK\" for reaching 500,000 units of the song as of August. Upon receiving this exciting news, Kenshi Yonezu attributed his success to \"Chainsaw Man,\" saying, \"I don't really feel it that much, but I was really happy.\""
