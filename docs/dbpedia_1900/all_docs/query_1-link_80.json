        "text": "Boy band Stray Kids’ 2022 hit ‘Maniac’ has been certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The band’s agency, JYP Entertainment, announced on Wednesday.\n\nThe RIAA issues gold certificates for digital singles or albums which sell more than 500,000 units, platinum certificates for more than 1 million units, multi-platinum certificates for more than 2 million units and diamond certificates for more than 10 million units.\n\nThis is the fourth gold certification for Stray Kids, following their full-length album ‘5-Star’ (2023), EP ‘Rock-Star’ (2023) and single ‘God’s Menu’ (2020).\n\n“Maniac” is part of the EP “Oddinary” (2022), which debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart 10 days after its release. Stray Kids have three other chart-topping albums, ‘Maxident’ (2022), ‘5-Star’ and ‘Rock-Star’.\n\nStray Kids are set to release their new single “Lose My Breath (Feat. Charlie Puth)” on the 10th of May to kick off their summer comeback. The new song will be produced by the band’s in-house production team 3RACHA, consisting of members Bang Chan, Changbin and Han.\n\nStray Kids are set to headline overseas music festivals including Milan’s I-Days and London’s British Summer Time Hyde Park in July. They will also play Lollapalooza Chicago in August. According to JYP Entertainment, tickets for the day of Stray Kids’ performance at Lollapalooza Chicago are currently sold out.\n\nFrom The Kpoppie Newsroom"
