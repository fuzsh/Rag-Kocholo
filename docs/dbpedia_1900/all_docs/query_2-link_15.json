A history-making moment, “KICK BACK” is now the first and only song written and performed in Japanese to be certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America. The opening theme to last season's breakout anime hit Chainsaw Man, “KICK BACK” began breaking records immediately upon its release, landing on Spotify's Global Top 50 chart and making Yonezu the first-ever J-pop artist to appear on the chart.\n\nToday's news is the latest in what has been a massive year for Yonezu, the J-pop hitmaker continuing to reach international audiences with musical contributions to some of the year's biggest titles. His most recent release, “Spinning Globe,” features as the official theme song to the new Studio Ghibli film The Boy and the Heron, with legendary director Hayao Miyazaki specifically enlisting Yonezu for the project. Also extending his talents to the gaming world, Yonezu provided the official theme song to the new Final Fantasy XVI entitled “Tsuki Wo Miteita - Moongazing.”\n\nABOUT KENSHI YONEZU\n\nAfter posting a series of Vocaloid tracks under the moniker Hachi , Kenshi Yonezu distinguished himself from the crowd with remarkable results. He later began releasing material under his real name Kenshi Yonezu, in 2012. He has since gained wide-known recognition as a multi-talented creative, not only for his music but also for his album cover illustrations and music productions.\n\nThe music video to his smash hit, “Lemon,” is still the most-viewed music video in Japan. The song topped Billboard Japan's year-end charts for 2 consecutive years, leaving its mark on music history, nationally and internationally. His album, STRAY SHEEP, released in 2020, sold over 2 million units. Yonezu remained engaged and productive and produced results throughout the pandemic. He performed in a virtual concert hosted by the online game Fortnite, collaborated globally with UNIQLO on their UT collection, participated in the GIVENCHY 21SS collection Instagram project alongside other celebrities from around the world, was awarded an AAC Award and Best Newcomer, the Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology Art Department Prize, and was listed in Forbes' 100 Asian Digital Stars amongst other achievements.\n\n“KICK BACK,” the opening theme to the anime series Chainsaw Man, entered Spotify's Global Top 50, a first-ever by a Japanese artist. Kenshi Yonezu goes from strength to strength, proving he is not just a national superstar but an artist with a dynamic international presence.\n\nIn 2023, Yonezu wrote “LADY” for the TV commercial of “Georgia” coffee product line, followed by “Moongazing,” as the theme song of the action role-playing game FINAL FANTASY XVI. And this time, he wrote “Spinning Globe” for The Boy and the Heron, the new movie directed by Hayao Miyazaki.\n\nKenshi Yonezu appears in fashion brand LOEWE's FW23 men's collection campaign, coinciding with the brand's 50th anniversary in Japan.\n\nCONNECT WITH KENSHI YONEZU: WEBSITE | INSTAGRAM | TWITTER | TIKTOK | YOUTUBE\n\nbookmark/share with:\n\nPress Release homepage / archives"
