        "text": "Taylor Alison Swift is a multi-Grammy award-winning American singer/songwriter who, in 2010 at the age of 20, became the youngest artist in history to win the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. In 2011 Swift was named Billboard's Woman of the Year. She also has been named the American Music Awards Artist of the Year, as well as the Entertainer of the Year for both the Country Music Association and the Academy of Country Music, among many other accolades. As of this writing, she is also the top-selling digital artist in music history.\n\nTaylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989, in Reading, Pennsylvania, to Andrea (Finlay), a one-time marketing executive, and Scott Kingsley Swift, a financial adviser. Her ancestry includes German and English, as well as some Scottish, Irish, Welsh and 1/16th Italian. She was named after James Taylor, and her mother believed that if she had a gender neutral name it would help her forge a business career. Taylor spent most of her childhood on an 11-acre Christmas tree farm in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. When she was nine years old the family moved to Wyomissing, PA, where she attended West Reading Elementary Center and Wyomissing Area Junior/Senior High School. Taylor spent her summers at her parents' vacation home at the Jersey shore. Her first hobby was English horse riding. Her mother put her in a saddle when she was nine months old and Swift later competed in horse shows. At the age of nine she turned her attention to musical theatre and performed in Berks Youth Theatre Academy productions of \"Grease\", \"Annie\", \"Bye Bye Birdie\" and \"The Sound of Music\". She traveled regularly to New York City for vocal and acting lessons. However, after a few years of auditioning in New York and not getting anything, she became interested in country music. At age 11, after many attempts, Taylor won a local talent competition by singing a rendition of LeAnn Rimes' \"Big Deal\", and was given the opportunity to appear as the opening act for Charlie Daniels at a Strausstown amphitheater. This interest in country music isolated Swift from her middle school peers.\n\nAt age 12 she was shown by a computer repairman how to play three chords on a guitar, inspiring her to write her first song, \"Lucky You\". She had previously won a national poetry contest with a poem entitled \"Monster in My Closet\", but now began to focus on songwriting. She moved to Nashville at age 14, having secured an artist development deal with RCA Records. She left RCA Records when she was 15--the label wanted her to record the work of other songwriters and wait until she was 18 to release an album, but she felt ready to launch her career with her own material. At an industry showcase at Nashville's The Bluebird Café in 2005, Swift caught the attention of Scott Borchetta, a Dreamworks Records executive who was preparing to form his own independent record label, Big Machine Records. Taylor was one of the new label's first signings.\n\nTaylor released her debut album, \"Taylor Swift\", in October of 2006 and received generally positive reviews from music critics. The New York Times described it as \"a small masterpiece of pop-minded country, both wide-eyed and cynical, held together by Ms. Swift's firm, pleading voice\". Her single \"Our Song\" made her the youngest solo writer and singer of a #1 country song. The album sold 39,000 copies during its first week. In 2008 she released her second studio album, \"Fearless\". The lead single from the album, \"Love Story\", was released in September 2008 and became the second best-selling country single of all time, peaking at #4 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Four more singles were released throughout 2008 and 2009: \"White Horse\", \"You Belong with Me\", \"Fifteen\" and \"Fearless\". \"You Belong with Me\" was the album's highest-charting single, peaking at #2 on the Billboard Hot 100. The album debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200 Album Chart. It was the top-selling album of 2009 and brought Swift much crossover success.\n\nIn September 2009 she became the first country music artist to win an MTV Video Music Award when \"You Belong with Me\" was named Best Female Video. Her acceptance speech was interrupted by rapper Ye, who had been involved in a number of other award show incidents. West declared Beyoncé's video for \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\", nominated in the same category, to be \"one of the best videos of all time\". When Beyoncé later won the award for Video of the Year, she invited Taylor onstage to finish her speech. In November 2009 Taylor Swift became the youngest ever artist, and one of only six women, to be named Entertainer of the Year by the Country Music Association.\n\nShe released her third studio album in October 2010, \"Speak Now\", and wrote all the songs herself. She originally intended to call the album \"Enchanted\" but Scott Borchetta, her record label's CEO, felt the title did not reflect the album's more adult themes. Swift toured throughout 2011 and early 2012 in support of \"Speak Now\". As part of the 13-month, 111-date world tour, Swift played seven shows in Asia, 12 in Europe, 80 in North America and 12 in Australasia (three dates on the US tour were rescheduled after she fell ill with bronchitis). The stage show was inspired by Broadway musical theatre, with choreographed routines, elaborate set-pieces, pyrotechnics and numerous costume changes. Swift invited many musicians to join her for one-off duets during the North American tour. Appearances were made by James Taylor, Jason Mraz, Shawn Colvin, Johnny Rzeznik, Andy Grammer, Tal Bachman, Justin Bieber, Selena Gomez, Nicki Minaj, Nelly, B.o.B., Usher, Flo Rida, Tip 'T.I.' Harris, Jon Foreman, Jim Adkins, Hayley Williams, Hot Chelle Rae, Ronnie Dunn, Darius Rucker, Tim McGraw and Kenny Chesney. In May 2012 Taylor featured in B.o.B's song \"Both of Us\".\n\nSwift's fourth studio album, \"Red\", was released on October 22, 2012. She wrote nine of the album's 16 songs alone; the remaining seven were co-written with Max Martin, Liz Rose, Dan Wilson, Ed Sheeran and Gary Lightbody. Nathan Chapman served as the album's lead producer but Jeff Bhasker, Butch Walker, Jacknife Lee, Dann Huff and Shellback (aka Shellback) also produced individual tracks. Chapman has said he encouraged Swift \"to branch out and to test herself in other situations\". She has described the collaborative process as \"an apprenticeship\" that taught her to \"paint with different colors\". \"Red\" examines Swift's attraction to drama-filled relationships; she believes that, since writing the record, such relationships no longer appeal to her. Musically, while there is some experimentation with \"slick, electronic beats\", the pop sheen is limited to a handful of tracks sprinkled among more recognizably Swiftian fare. \"Rolling Stone\" enjoyed \"watching Swift find her pony-footing on Great Songwriter Mountain. She often succeeds in joining the Joni/Carole King tradition of stark-relief emotional mapping . . . Her self-discovery project is one of the best stories in pop.\" The Guardian described Swift as a \"Brünnhilde of a rock star\" and characterized \"Red\" as \"another chapter in one of the finest fantasies pop music has ever constructed\". \"USA Today\" felt that the \"engaging\" record saw Swift \"write ever-more convincingly--and wittily and painfully--about the messy emotions of a young twenty something nearing the end of her transition from girl to woman\". The \"Los Angeles Times\" noted the exploration of \"more nuanced relationship issues\" on \"an unapologetically big pop record that opens new sonic vistas for her\".\n\nAs part of the \"Red\" promotional campaign, representatives from 72 worldwide radio stations were flown to Nashville during release week for individual interviews with Swift. She made television appearances on Ellen: The Ellen DeGeneres Show (2003), Good Morning America (1975), The View (1997), Late Show with David Letterman (1993), ABC News Nightline (1979) and All Access Nashville with Katie Couric (2012). She performed at Los Angeles' MTV VMAs and London's Teen Awards, and will also perform at Nashville's CMA Awards, Frankfurt's MTV Europe Music Awards, Los Angeles' AMA Awards and Sydney's ARIA Music Awards. Swift offered exclusive album promotions through Target, Papa John's and Walgreens. She became a spokesmodel for Keds sneakers, released her sophomore Elizabeth Arden fragrance and continued her partnerships with Cover Girl, Sony Electronics and American Greetings, as well as her unofficial brand tie-ins with Ralph Lauren and Shellys. The album's lead single, \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\", was released in August 2012. The song became Swift's first #1 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, recording the highest ever one-week sales figures for a female artist. Two further singles have since been released: \"Begin Again\" (country radio) and \"I Knew You Were Trouble\" (pop and international radio).In her career, as of May 2012, Swift has sold over 23 million albums and 54.5 million digital tracks worldwide.\n\nTaylor Swift is only beginning to emerge as an acting talent, having voiced the role of Audrey in the animated feature Der Lorax (2012). She also made appearances in the theatrical release Valentinstag (2010) and in an episode of CSI: Vegas (2000). She contributed two original songs to Die Tribute von Panem - The Hunger Games (2012) soundtrack: \"Safe & Sound featuring The Civil Wars\" and \"Eyes Open\". Taylor released her fifth album, titled \"1989\", on October 27, 2014. This album is when she finally made the complete transition from country to pop. She says that she will not be going to any Country Music Award shows. The album is named after the year she was born, and is a sort of '80s-sounding album, in the sense that it's more electronic.\n\nIn March 2015 she began dating Scottish Disc Jockey Calvin Harris after having met at the Brit Awards in February. They were together for thirteen months.\n\nBTS also known as the Bangtan Boys, is a seven-member South Korean boy band formed by Big Hit Entertainment. The name subsequently became a backronym for Beyond the Scene in July 2017. On June 12, 2013, they performed the song \"No More Dream\" from their initial album 2 Cool 4 Skool to commemorate their debut on June 13, 2013. They won several New Artist of the Year awards for the track \"No More Dream\", including at the 2013 Melon Music Awards and Golden Disc Awards and the 2014 Seoul Music Awards. The band continued to gain prominence with their subsequent albums Dark & Wild (2014), The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Part 2 (2015) and The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever (2016), with the latter two entering the U.S. Billboard 200. The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever went on to win the Album of the Year award at the 2016 Melon Music Awards.\n\nTheir second full album, Wings (2016), peaked at #26 on the Billboard 200, which marked the highest chart ranking for a K-pop album ever. In South Korea, Wings became the best-selling album in the Gaon Album Chart history at the time. It sold more than 1.5 million copies, making it BTS's first \"million seller\", and the group was subsequently awarded Artist of the Year at the 2016 Mnet Asian Music Awards. The group's next release, Love Yourself: Her (2017), debuted at #7 on the Billboard 200, the highest rank for an Asian artist in history. The group also managed to debut on the Billboard Hot 100 for the first time with the album's title track, \"DNA\", which entered at #85 and peaked at #67. Another track from the album, \"Mic Drop\", was remixed by Steve Aoki with a feature by Desiigner and peaked at #28 on the Billboard Hot 100. Both tracks are certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America, a first for any Korean group and the second Korean act overall after PSY. The album sold over 1.2 million copies on South Korea's Gaon Album Chart in its first month, achieving the highest monthly album sales in the chart's history and the highest on any Korean chart in 16 years, second to g.o.d's Chapter 4 album in 2001. BTS was awarded the Mnet Asian Music Award for Artist of the Year for the second year in a row in 2017. Their third full album, Love Yourself: Tear (2018), debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200, making them the only K-Pop act to achieve this feat so far. The album's title track, \"Fake Love\", is the group's third song to reach Gold certification. Love Yourself: Answer, the repackage of that album, also debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200. The repackage sold over 1.9 million copies on Gaon Album Chart in August 2018, breaking the chart's all-time monthly record once again. On November 9, 2018 \"Love Yourself: Answer\" became the first Korean album to be certified Gold (500,000+ units), and BTS became the first Korean group to get a Platinum (1,000,000+ units) certification with the single \"MIC Drop\" in the United States.\n\nKnown for their large social media presence, BTS were listed by Forbes as the most retweeted artist on Twitter in March 2016. In May, Twitter launched its first ever K-pop emoji, featuring BTS. In October, Billboard placed BTS #1 on their Social 50 chart, making them the first Korean group to top the chart. To date they have spent 98 weeks at #1 on the Social 50 chart. Also in 2016 they charted on YouTube's Music Global Top 100: 17th on the video chart, 6th on the artist chart and 14th on the tracks chart. In May 2017, they won the Top Social Artist Award at the Billboard Music Awards, becoming the first Korean group to win a BBMA. In June 2017, Time magazine named the band one of the 25 most influential people on the internet. On November 20, 2017, Guinness World Records revealed that BTS had earned a spot in their 2018 edition for \"having the world's most Twitter engagements for a music group\". That December, they were revealed to be the most tweeted about celebrity in 2017, being \"liked or retweeted over half a billion times (502 million)\" worldwide. In 2018, BTS became #1 on the Forbes Korea Power Celebrity list, which ranks South Korea's most powerful and influential celebrities, as well as became the youngest ever recipients to be awarded the Order of Cultural Merit from the South Korean government. In September 2018, BTS gave a speech at the United Nations as ambassadors for UNICEF. In October 2018, BTS were featured on the cover of Time magazine, with Time naming them 'Next Generation Leaders'.\n\nBTS' first members were recruited through Big Hit's \"Hit it\" auditions in 2010 and 2011. The original lineup went through several changes before the final group of members was established in 2012. Half a year prior to debut, the members began building their name and creating a relationship with fans through Twitter, video blogs, fancafe posts, and by releasing various song covers via YouTube and SoundCloud.\n\nBefore debuting in 2013, RM was already performing as an underground rapper and had released several tracks informally, including a collaboration with Zico. Jin had been a student at Konkuk University, majoring in acting, before being streetcast for auditions, while Suga was an underground rapper in Daegu. J-Hope, who was part of a street dance team named Neuron, was active in the underground dancing scene, participating in various battles and competitions. Before joining Big Hit, Jimin entered Busan High School of Arts as the top student in modern dance, but later transferred to Korea Arts High School with V, who auditioned in Daegu. Jungkook was cast by multiple agencies after leaving auditions for Superstar K, but eventually chose Big Hit after seeing Rap Monster's rap.\n\nThe group's debut single album 2 Cool 4 Skool, the first installment in their \"school trilogy\" series, was released simultaneously with its lead single \"No More Dream\" on June 12, 2013. While the album peaked at number five on the Gaon Album Chart and sold over 105,000 copies, \"No More Dream\" and the subsequent single \"We Are Bulletproof Pt.2\" were not major hits. Expanding their endeavors into Japan, \"No More Dream\" was later re-recorded in Japanese and released on June 4, 2014.\n\nThe second part to the \"school trilogy\" was the extended play O!RUL8,2?, released on September 11, 2013, which sold over 120,000 copies to date and peaked at number four. Its supporting singles \"N.O\" and \"Attack on Bangtan\" failed to chart high. That same month, BTS starred in their own variety show, SBS-MTV's Rookie King Channel Bangtan, based on a fake broadcast station, \"Channel Bangtan\", through which members parodied variety shows such as VJ Special Forces and MasterChef Korea. At the end of the year, BTS was recognized with several New Artist of the Year awards, including the 2013 Melon Music Awards and Golden Disc Awards and the 2014 Seoul Music Awards.\n\nTheir Japanese studio album, Wake Up (2014), released that December, peaking at number three on the weekly Oricon Albums Chart and selling 25,000 copies. Along with re-recorded Japanese versions of older songs, it also contained the original tracks \"Wake Up\" and \"The Stars\". Their first concert tour, 2014 BTS Live Trilogy Episode II: The Red Bullet, was held from October to December.\n\nAt the beginning of 2015, BTS toured Japan for the first time with their BTS's First Japan Tour-Wake Up: Open Your Eyes. They also held their second solo concert in Korea, BTS Live Trilogy - Episode 1: BTS Begins. Their third EP, The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Part 1 (2015), was released that March and was the only Korean album to be included in Fuse's list of the \"27 Best Albums of 2015 So Far\" that year. The lead single \"I Need U\" was a top five hit on the weekly Gaon Digital Chart in South Korea and garnered BTS their first ever music show win on SBS MTV's The Show. Although the second single, \"Dope\", peaked at number 44 on the weekly Gaon Digital Chart, its music video became BTS' first to accrue over 100 million views on YouTube in October. \"Dope\" later peaked at number three on Billboard's World Digital Songs Chart. The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Part 1 have sold over 300,000 copies to date.\n\nOn March 17, 2015, the group's leader RM (then known as Rap Monster) released his first solo mixtape, the eponymous RM, for free on the streaming service SoundCloud. The mixtape was ranked 48th on the \"50 Best Hip Hop Albums of 2015\" list published by Spin Magazine.\n\nBTS' fourth Japanese single, \"For You\", was released that June to celebrate the first anniversary of their Japanese debut.
