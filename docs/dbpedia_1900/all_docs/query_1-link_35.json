        "text": "By: Katarzyna Zablotna\n\nWhat does it take for a rap song to make it to The Golden Record of Rap? People enjoy a rap song when they understand and value what the rapper is rapping about and enjoy how they delivered it. When you feel their emotions and appreciate their transition from lyric to lyric. There are a few legendary rap songs that inspired countless other artists.\n\nLauryn Hill, ‘Lost Ones’\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdNFFC0p7N4\n\nI had to start off the Golden Record of Rap with the song that started off Lauryn Hill’s five time Grammy winning album “the Miseducation of Lauryn Hill.” Technically it’s the second track on the album but it’s the first song after the forty seven second intro. The lyrics evidently seem to be about a break up and it’s rumored that this song is about former Fugees band mate Wyclef, although she denied those rumors. It’s an amazing song to start an amazing album. She confidently sang and rapped a song with a valuable meaning. Her vocals and the song itself is filled with strength and feeling. In the music industry there seems to be a lot more male rappers being heard rather than female rappers so it’s refreshing to hear a female’s voice and point of view.\n\nMissy Elliot, ‘Get Ur Freak On’\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPoKiGQzbSQ\n\nThis song was written and produced by Missy Elliot and Timbaland and released March 6,2001. Since then it reached number seven on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart, was number fourteen in Rolling Stone’s Best Songs of the Decade, and was number 466 on their Greatest 500 Songs of All Time list updated in 2010. This song won a Grammy Award for best solo rap performance. The song itself has Indian/Punjab elements and melodies and the song starts and ends with a man speaking Japanese. In the beginning of the song he says what translates to,”everyone start dancing together wildly now. Let’s make some noise, let’s make some noise.” That’s exactly what this song is. It’s highly energetic. It’s a song that hypes you up, a song that you party to, a song you dance to.\n\nMobb Deep, ‘Shook Ones Part II’\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoYZf-lBF_U\n\nShook Ones was ranked number 23 by Complex on their list of 25 most violent rap songs of all time. This song is considered gangsta rap and is also in a sub-genre called East Coast hip-hop. Shook Ones Part 2 is a sequel to Shook Ones, with similar lyrics but less profanity. Many agree the sequel is better than the original. This song is basically delivering a warning to fake wannabe thugs. One of the rappers in this hip-hop duo, Prodigy, told NPR during an interview that rapping was his way of getting his anger out. He was an angry kid because he had sickle cell anemia. My favorite lyric from this song is “I’m only 19 but my mind is old, when things get for real my warm heart turns cold.” Prodigy mentioned in an interview with Noisey that sickle cell and other circumstances in his life led him to grow up faster so when he was 19, he felt 40.\n\nWu-Tang Clan, ‘C.R.E.A.M.’\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBwAxmrE194\n\nC.R.E.A.M is an acronym for cash rules everything around me. This song was produced by the Wu-Tang Clan’s leader, RZA. C.R.E.A.M samples the 1967 Charmels’ song “As Long As I Got You.” The song’s opening riff is looped throughout the whole song. Although this song received praise from music critics, when it was released in 1994 it only reached number sixty on the Billboard’s Hot 100 chart. In 2009 this song was certified gold in the U.S. and it’s been called one of the greatest hip-hop songs of all time. Raekwon and Inspectah Deck rap the lyrics and Method Man does the hook. Rza explained to Power 106 that Method Man was the master of hooks. This song only features three of the nine members. The success of this song led to five members of the group to earn solo contracts from Loud Records and release solo albums – produced by RZA.\n\nKanye West, ‘Runaway’\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bm5iA4Zupek\n\nThis song was on Kanye’s My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy album. I knew I had to add a song from Kanye and I knew it had to be from this album. The album received a double platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America. This album won a Grammy Award for best rap album. Many consider this album the best album of 2010, the year it was released, and Kanye’s best album of all time. In 2009, Kanye interrupted Taylor Swift’s acceptance speech for a MTV music video award and the controversy led him to run away to Hawaii. Pusha T. was invited down to Hawaii to be featured on this song. His lyrics explore any criticism that has been directed towards him and he has a “toast for the douchebags” that only have something negative to say about him.\n\nNotorious B.I.G., ‘Juicy’\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JZom_gVfuw\n\nThis song was The Notorious B.I.G.’s first single and it blew up. It was on his debut album Ready To Die. The beat can be recognized anywhere. He sampled the Mtume song Juicy Fruit. “It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up! magazine” is the first lyric of the song. It’s Biggie’s most iconic lyric and arguably the most known lyric in hip-hop. Complex ranked this lyric the number one best opening line in rap history. Jay-Z made a whole song inspired by this lyric called A Dream. This lyric sets up the theme for the whole song. It’s probably such a popular lyric because so many other rappers and people could relate to it. It all starts out with a dream.\n\n50 Cent, ‘In da Club’\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qm8PH4xAss\n\nThis song was the lead single on 50 Cent’s album Get Rich or Die Tryin’. It reached number one on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 making it 50 cent’s first number one single. This song won a Grammy Award for the best male rap solo performance and best rap song. This song was also on the Rolling Stone’s 500 greatest songs of all time list at number 448. It was mentioned as one of the best songs of the decade by both Rolling Stone and Billboard. 50 Cent was discovered by Eminem, who is featured in the music video. 50 Cent calls this song a celebration of life because “everyday is someone’s birthday.” While most of the other songs on the album are slightly darker, this is more of an upbeat party song.\n\nJay-Z, ’99 Problems’\n\nhttps://www.anonymouscontent.com/work/us/music-videos/anonymous/mark-romanek/jay-z-99-problems/\n\nThis song is so great. It’s basically saying Jay-Z has so many problems but none of them are girl/relationship problems. His problems are a little bit more serious, like a cop racially profiling him or rap critics. I was surprised to learn this song only reached number thirty on the Billboard hot 100 chart. The hook is sampled from Ice-T’s single with the same name. Unfortunately, even though Ice-T deserves the credit for this hook most people attribute this hook with Jay-Z. In the second verse Jay-Z raps about an experience based on a true story. He was carrying cocaine in a secret compartment in his car and was pulled over by the police. He wouldn’t let the police officer search his car without a warrant, so the officer called for a drug-sniffing dog. Police had to let him go when the dog didn’t show up. Moments after he drove away he saw a police car with dogs drive by.\n\nEminem, ‘Lose Yourself’\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Yhyp-_hX2s\n\nThis song was for the soundtrack of 8 Mile, the movie Eminem starred in. It was written and produced by Eminem for his character in the movie, B-Rabbit. This was Eminem’s first single to make it to number one of the Billboard hot 100 chart and it stayed in that spot for twelve weeks straight. Some even say this is Eminem’s best work to date, as well as one of the best hip-hop songs of all time. It has a spot in the Rolling Stone’s 500 greatest songs of all time list. This song was the first rap song to win an Academy Award. It won for best original song. It also won a Grammy Award for best rap song and best solo performance. It’s certified diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America.\n\nChildish Gambino, ‘This is America’\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYOjWnS4cMY\n\nThis is the most recently released song on this record and it’s the most politically important one. This song addresses issues of gun violence, mass shooting, police brutality, racism, and discrimination against African Americans in the U.S. Which is a big juxtaposition to the happy melody that plays in the beginning of the song. The music video is just as powerful as the lyrics. This song was Gambino’s first number one on the Billboard hot 100. This song won four Grammy Awards for record of the year, song of the year, best rap/sung performance, and best music video."
