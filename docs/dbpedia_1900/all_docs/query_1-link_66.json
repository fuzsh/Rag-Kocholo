        "text": "ENHYPEN recently made their Japanese debut just last month with \"Border: Hakanai,\" and now, they are certified gold disk platinum in Japan.\n\nKeep on reading to know more.\n\nENHYPEN's Japanese Debut Becomes Certified Gold Disk Platinum by RIAJ\n\nENHYPEN is showing off their potential to be the icons of fourth-generation boy groups after they received gold disk platinum from the Recording Industry Association of Japan with their Japanese debut single album, \"Border: Hakanai.\"\n\nAccording to the Recording Industry Association of Japan on August 10 KST, ENHYPEN, who released their Japanese debut single album, \"Border: Hakanai,\" back in July 13, received the gold disk platinum certification after accumulating more than 350,000 album copies sold since the single's release.\n\nIN CASE YOU MISSED IT: ENHYPEN, EPEX, and LIGHTSUM Selected as 'Super Rookies' by Global Fans\n\nThe gold disk platinum is given to those that have accumulated more than 350,000 sales, and ENHYPEN became certified as platinum after they sold more than 250,000 album copies at the same time their Japanese debut single was released proving their popularity in the country.\n\nPreviously, \"Border: Hakanai\" topped the Oricon Daily Singles chart for seven days in a row during the time of its release. Not only that, but it also topped the Weekly Singles chart during the week of July 19.\n\nTheir Japanese single album includes the title song \"Given-Taken,\" from their Korean debut album, \"Border: Day One,\" which was released in November of last year, the Japanese version of their B-side song, \"Let Me In (20 CUBE)\" and their first Japanese original song, \"Forget Me Not.\" With that, a total of three tracks are included in the singles album.\n\nIN CASE YOU MISSED IT: ENHYPEN 'BORDER: Transient' Sets Second Highest 1st Week Sales Record among Foreign Male Artists in History\n\nMeanwhile, fourth-generation icon, ENHYPEN, is receiving praise from various media outlets such as Forbes, an American business magazine, who described the HYBE and CJ ENM boy group to have shown remarkable progress and success right after their debut.\n\nENHYPEN Reveals Which BTS Concept They Want to Try in the Future\n\nOn August 5, HYBE's youngest boy group, HYBE, recently took part in an interview with Seventeen, where they also participated in the magazine's \"Lyric Challenge,\" a game where the members would have to guess a song's title and artist based on a single line.\n\nOne of the songs that were played was their labelmates and seniors, BTS's song, \"Boy With Luv,\" which features Halsey. As soon as the members saw the lyrics on-screen, they immediately knew which song it was and even sang and danced along!\n\nIN CASE YOU MISSED IT: ENHYPEN Becomes the First Act in 6 Years to Break the Highest 1st Week Sales Record for a Japanese Debut Album\n\nWhen the song was finished, ENHYPEN member, Jake, revealed that he wants to try making a song with the same kind of concept as \"Boy With Luv.\"\n\n\"I want to do a song with this kind of concept,\" said, Jake.\n\nJake asked his fellow ENHYPEN members what they thought of doing a similar concept, to which Sunghoon responds by saying it might take them five years for them to be able to do the concept.\n\nWith ENHYPEN only having debuted just last year, they will surely be able to try numerous concepts in the future.\n\nCheck out the full interview here:\n\nFor more K-Pop news and updates, always keep your tabs open here on KpopStarz."
