        "text": "Story of Song\n\nAdam Young was interviewed by Anti Music; when asked about the story of his hit single, he said: “It was 2 AM and I was sitting on the floor in my parent’s basement with a MicroKorg on my lap. I built this synthy legato, ‘ping’ sound routed through a low pass filter and ran it through a bunch of guitar pedals. I come up with a little cascading part that wound up as the intro and verses of a song called ‘Fireflies.’ I have insomnia and I’ve always had a tough time falling asleep for as long as I can remember. I wanted to sing about my inability to sleep in a whimsical way that portrayed the condition as lighthearted and almost more of a ‘blessing’ than a curse. It’s ironic that when sleep and I cannot bring ourselves to meet is often when inspiration strikes hardest. I’d just been on vacation to Iowa the week before I wrote the song and was amazed at how many fireflies came out at dusk. I didn’t really have to think about making a connection between insomnia and lighting bugs, it just sort of happened and the song basically wrote itself. It was a lot of fun.”\n\nRelease date\n\nReleased July 14, 2009\n\nSongwriter/s\n\nAdam Young\n\nLabel\n\nUniversal Republic\n\nChart Rankings\n\nUS – 1\n\nUK – 1\n\nGERMANY – 6\n\nIn the UK, ‘Fireflies’ topped the Official Charts Company and sold over 792.000 copies.
