        "text": "The Record Industry Association of America (RIAA) has announced a major change in its methodology for awarding gold and platinum certifications based on the number of albums an artist has sold. Since 1958, the RIAA has recognized a half million records sold has a gold certification, one million records sold as platinum. Now, along with physical album sales, the RIAA will factor in on-demand audio and video streams into certifying a record platinum or gold.\n\nFor every 1,500 on-demand audio and video streams, the RIAA will now equate that to one album sale. However, it is unclear as Pitchfork points out, if for instance “one stream of a 17-song album will count the same as 17 streams of a single taken from the album. “\n\nRIAA CEO and chairman Cary Sherman says in a statement:\n\nFor nearly six decades, whether it’s vinyl, CDs, downloads or now streams, the Gold & Platinum Program has adapted to recognize the benchmarks of success in an evolving music marketplace. We know that music listening—for both for albums and songs—is skyrocketing, yet that trend has not been reflected in our album certifications. Modernizing our Album Award to include music streaming is the next logical step in the continued evolution of Gold & Platinum Awards, and doing so enables RIAA to fully reward the success of artists’ albums today."
