        "text": "The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) has bestowed many gold, platinum and diamond certifications over the years. However, only 12 titles in the United States have accomplished a unique feat. That feat? Moving over 20 million units and achieving double diamond status.\n\nIn fact, of those 12 titles, two can be considered triple diamond moving a staggering 30 million units.\n\nFrom rock to pop to country and areas in between, scroll through the gallery below to see which 12 albums have been certified double diamond.\n\nFacts About the RIAA\n\nThe RIAA was formed in 1952 and acts as the main recording industry trade organization in the United States. Its mission statement reads, in part, “We work to protect artists’ creative freedom, fight for state and federal policies that strengthen the modern music ecosystem, and explain the work labels do to support their artist partners.”\n\nOne of the most popular functions of the RIAA is its gold and platinum awards program, which first launched in 1958. In the 60+ year history of the program, the RIAA has certified over 17,000 titles gold or platinum. It wasn’t until 1999 that the RIAA unveiled the Diamond Award, which honors an album or single selling 10 million copies or more.\n\nAnd now, here are some additional facts about the RIAA, according to their statistics:\n\n-The first single to be certified gold was Perry Como’s “Catch a Falling Star.”\n\n-The first album to be certified gold was the cast album of Oklahoma! sung by Gordon MacRae.\n\n–Eagles/Their Greatest Hits 1971-1975 was the first album to be certified platinum.\n\n-Johnnie Taylor’s “Disco Lady” was the first single to be certified platinum.\n\n-USA for Africa’s “We Are The World” was the first single to be certified multi-platinum.\n\n-The highest-certified soundtrack album is Whitney Houston’s The Bodyguard, which has been certified 18X platinum."
