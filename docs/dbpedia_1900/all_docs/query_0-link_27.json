        "text": "Butterfly\n\nReleased on September 16, 1997, Butterfly debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 after selling over 235,000 copies in the United States. It maintained that position for one week and remained in the Top 20 for twenty-one weeks. Butterfly was certified 5x Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America on December 15, 1999.\n\nButterfly was released right after Mariah's separation from Sony Music's chairman and CEO Tommy Mottola. “People are going to be so analytical about a lot of it because of what's been going on in my personal life, but even beyond that, it almost feels like I'm letting go of a part of me,” Mariah explained. “This album is probably the most personal album I've written. Lyrically, there are a bunch of songs on there that relate to me personally, where as before I'd imagine certain scenarios or write about other people's situations — this is more about me.”\n\n“I feel like I'm in a very good place, creatively and personally. My life is in disarray right now, but I feel like I'm at the best and most creative place that I've ever been in,” Mariah explained. “I threw myself into this album in that way. There were peaks and valleys emotionally, and each time I went through those peaks and valleys, I put it into the music. Because there wasn't a day I wasn't recording. I've come into my own as an artist, and at this point I feel free enough to express what I'm really feeling, without using a smoke screen. I feel good about it because there are so many things that are real on it. It's definitely an evolution for me.”\n\nCritics accused Mariah of going into a more urban direction. Even the record label considered Butterfly harder to market because of it being what they perceived as a “hip hop record.” “I don't think it's in any way obvious which things on this album are influenced by R&B, because in the end, it's my voice on top of a track that has a harder edge or a hip-hop loop, something I've done even as far back as ‘Dreamlover,’ which was a loop of a song by Big Daddy Kane,” Mariah said. “I knew I always wanted to go in that direction anyway but it was sort of always a struggle because when record companies see that they can have success with you as one thing, it gets very frightening and unsure for them to see you do something else. I'm still known for songs like ‘Hero,’ and I don't think that I've shunned that on this album at all. I think that in a sense people were trying to project this image on me, that ‘she's gone left-of-centre, she's made a hip hop record,’ but it's not a hip hop record. I collaborated with people I wanted to collaborate with, I worked with producers I wanted to work with, but it's basically the direction I was going in on ‘Fantasy,’ on the ‘Always Be My Baby’ remix, it's the 1997/98 version of where I wanted to be on Daydream.”\n\nOnly two songs saw a commercial release in the United States, both of them topping the Billboard Hot 100 chart. “I remember having so many meetings with my record company about releasing more of an illustration of my work in order to show fans who maybe only bought singles what I'm about, especially with the ballads doing so well. But their thoughts were that stylistically different singles would ‘confuse’ the core audience. I know how rounded I am musically but it was everyone else that was banging on about the pop diva. Unfortunately there were only two singles commercially released from that album, and they were seven months apart.”\n\n“Honey,” which Mariah produced with Sean “Puffy” Combs, The Ummah (Q-Tip and Ali Shaheed Muhammad of A Tribe Called Quest, and Jay Dee) and Stevie J., was released as the lead single on August 26, 1997. “Q-Tip, from A Tribe Called Quest, came up with the idea to use the ‘Body Rock’ loop,” Mariah said about creating the song. “He played it to me over the phone and I knew immediately that this was the happy, light summer vibe I needed. Then we thought it out and put ‘Hey DJ’ on top of it and Puffy came in with all his ideas, so it was a collaborative effort. That's what I'm about. I don't just get a producer to come in and invent or reinvent me.” “Honey” became Mariah's third single to debut at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and only the sixth to do so in the history of the chart. “Honey,” which sold over 135,000 units in its first week, was certified 2x Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America on March 27, 2022.\n\nThe album's title track, co-produced with Walter Afanasieff, was sent to radios as an airplay-only single on September 29, 1997, and peaked at number sixteen on the Billboard Hot 100 Airplay chart during the week of November 15. The song started as a collaboration with dance producer David Morales. “When I first wrote the song it was just gonna be a house record with David. As I wrote it, I decided that it should be a ballad and so I decided to do another version,” Mariah explained. “‘Butterfly’ was a wish list of things I hoped somebody would say to me, but I wrote it as though I were talking to someone else. The lines ‘Spread your wings and prepare to fly / For you have become a Butterfly / Fly abandonedly into the sun’ is like someone saying, ‘Do your thing.’ There's another line: ‘Wild horses run unbridled / Or their spirit dies.’ You can't restrain a free spirit — either you're going to break them or they're going to leave and never come back.”\n\nMariah worked with Bone Thugs-N-Harmony on the song “Breakdown,” which was sent to radios in February 1998. “It's a completely different type of singing for me, I love what they do and I think their style is so unique.” Mariah said back in 1997. “You can tell in a lot of R&B their style is starting to penetrate. I was very inspired by them when I came up with the song and I told Puffy ‘Let's do a Bone Thugs type track.’ We got Stevie J. to lay down the track and I wrote the melody over it. I wrote the song to fit in with that type of style they do and I realized it's really hard to sing those types of rhythm. They make it sound so easy. Now, having experienced the difficulty at first hand. I respect them even more.”\n\nIn the United States, “My All” was commercially released as a double-sided single with “Breakdown” on April 21, 1998. “‘My All’ is one of the more passionate songs in my catalog.” Mariah wrote about the song on the #1 To Infinity liner notes. “I really love singing it! It takes me back to a really specific moment in my life where I fell in love with love.” After selling 122,000 copies, the song entered the Billboard Hot 100 at number two. Two weeks later, it became Mariah's thirteenth number-one song on the chart, tying her with Michael Jackson for third place among acts with the most number-one singles. “My All” spent twelve consecutive weeks inside the Top 10 and was certified 2x Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America on November 17, 2022.\n\nMariah worked with the Trackmasters on “The Roof,” which is based on a sample of the song “Shook Ones Part II” by Mobb Deep and got a very limited release in Europe and the United Kingdom as the album's third single. “It's my favorite song on this record,” she said. “I've been wanting to use that sample for a really long time. Just having the sample of when he's saying, ‘I got you stuck off the realness.’ Two years ago, people would have had a heart attack if I said I wanted to leave that voice on the record.”\n\nButterfly also saw Mariah collaborating with Missy Elliott for the first time on the song “Babydoll.” “Missy to me is on the cutting edge of where R&B is going today. I think, because she's a rapper, her lyrical sense is different from someone who's just a singer and a writer. She uses references only a rapper would use. So I called her and went to Virginia. I already had the idea for the chorus of ‘Babydoll’ and I asked Missy what melody ideas she had for the verses, which I never usually do but I wanted her flavor. So she came up with that skipping, choppy approach. She's really talented. I think we complemented each other musically, because her philosophy to writing is just write it and not to be obsessive over it. For me, though I have people scrutinize what I do. She had one line, ‘You can beep me 911 and I'll come running quick as the cops’ and I told her that I didn't think that particular line was working too well for my particular song. That's how we came up with ‘I'm gonna leave my cellphone turned on in my purse by the bed’ line, which is like ‘what?’ on a Mariah Carey record. It's kind of a reality song of what people go through when they're waiting for that special someone to call.”\n\n“Close My Eyes,” is a song included on Butterfly that, as Mariah told VH1 in 1997, she first started writing in 1993. “I had just done my first concert for a TV special in Schenectady, NY. I hadn't done anything other than Unplugged and little one-off shows with a piano player, so it was like my first real concert. I got off stage and went home to this really pretty farm in upstate New York. I was taking a bath and looking out the window — one of my favorite things. The moon was out and I was reflecting on my life. It was the first time I really sat and took it all in. It's almost like I watched my whole career go by. I took a breath and said, ‘I've really accomplished something. What did it take to get here?’ That started the concept for the song. I wrote the whole first verse and kept it in the back of my mind — I didn't even write it down — for like four years. Fast forward to '97, and while writing Butterfly, I picked up where I left off after the first chorus.”\n\nMariah closed the album with “Outside.” “A lot of people could relate to it for a lot of different reasons,” Mariah told Molly Meldrum in 1997. “For me it was basically about being multiracial and feeling like I come from another planet because I never knew anyone in the exact same position as me in that way. And I know other people that are mixed, but somehow because of the way I look — because I'm kind of ambiguous looking, I could be anything really — the experiences that I've had made me feel like an outsider in a lot of ways in every situation that I'm in. Less now, but then things will turn up that will just kind of reinforce that inner feeling that rises every now and then.”\n\nTracklist\n\nOriginal Release\n\nTrack # Song Run time 1\n\nHoney\n\nWritten by Mariah Carey, Sean Combs, Kamaal Fareed, Steven Jordan, Stephen Hague, Bobby Robinson, Ronald Larkins, Larry Price, Malcolm McLaren.\n\nProduced by Sean “Puffy” Combs, The Ummah, Stevie J. and Mariah Carey.\n\n4:59 2\n\nButterfly\n\nWritten by Mariah Carey, Walter Afanasieff.\n\nProduced by Mariah Carey and Walter Afanasieff.\n\n4:34 3\n\nMy All\n\nWritten by Mariah Carey, Walter Afanasieff.\n\nProduced by Mariah Carey and Walter Afanasieff.\n\n3:52 4\n\nThe Roof\n\nWritten by Mariah Carey, Jean Claude Oliver, Samuel Barnes, Cory Rooney, Albert Johnson, Kejuan Muchita.\n\nProduced by Poke and Tone and Mariah Carey.\n\n5:15 5\n\nFourth Of July\n\nWritten by Mariah Carey, Walter Afanasieff.\n\nProduced by Mariah Carey and Walter Afanasieff.\n\n4:22 6\n\nBreakdown (feat.
