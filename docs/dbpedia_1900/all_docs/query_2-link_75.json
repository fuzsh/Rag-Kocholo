        "text": "The Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) recently shared a new batch of albums that achieved gold certifications. Included in the list are boy groups SEVENTEEN and ENHYPEN, and K-pop girl group TWICE.\n\nENHYPEN Gets All-Kill RIAJ Certifications\n\nENHYPEN is the only K-pop group that has all of its albums certified by the Recording Industry Association of Japan. It is definitely something amazing because even their senior boy groups BTS, EXO, and BIGBANG did not achieve this.\n\nFor the 4th generation boy group, all of ENHYPEN's albums (Korean and Japanese) have been certified by RIAJ. \"BORDER: DAY ONE,\" \"BORDER: CARNIVAL,\" \"DIMENSION: DILEMMA,\" \"DIMENSION: ANSWER,\" and recently, their \"MANIFESTO: DAY 1\" album all have surpassed the 100,000 album copies sold to be certified gold in Japan.\n\nMeanwhile, their Japanese album \"BORDER: Senkou\" has a Platinum certification with more than 250,000 copies, while their second Japanese album, \"DIMENSION: Senkou,\" has a Double Platinum certification with more than 500,000 album copies sold.\n\nSEVENTEEN Achieves Double Platinum\n\nAs for SEVENTEEN, it was reported that their latest Korean album, \"Face The Sun,\" earned a double platinum certification, selling over 500,000 album copies in Japan.\n\nThis is their very first double platinum achievement in the country. Their Korean mini albums \"Your Choice,\" \"Attaca,\" and \"Power Of Love\" all got single platinum certifications, meaning they sold over 250,000 copies nationwide.\n\nREAD ALSO: Kep1er Matches BTS & TWICE's Historic Milestone on Billboard Japan With 'WA DA DA'\n\nTheir Japanese single albums \"Fallin' Flower\" and \"Not Alone\" also earned the same certification, double platinum. The achievement of \"Be The Sun\" continues to prove how influential SEVENTEEN is.\n\nTWICE Tops K-pop Girl Groups With Most RIAJ Certifications\n\nTWICE has achieved no other Korean girl group has ever achieved in Japan. They have now more than 15 albums certified by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ).\n\nTheir \"Wake Me Up\" album has been certified double platinum. Their \"#TWICE,\" \"One More Time,\" \"Candy Pop,\" \"BDZ,\" \"#TWICE2,\" \"HAPPY HAPPY,\" \"Breakthrough,\" \"&TWICE,\" and \"Fanfare\" all have single platinum certifications.\n\nMeanwhile, their \"BETTER,\" \"#TWICE3,\" \"Kura Kura,\" \"Perfect World,\" \"Doughnut,\" and \"#TWICE4\" all have gold certifications by RIAJ. And now, their album \"Celebrate\" joins the group of gold-certified albums.\n\nWith all of TWICE's albums, it is evident that they are the biggest Korean girl group in Japan. Having three Japanese members definitely helped with it as Japanese fans adore seeing them interact with the Korean members.\n\nOn the other hand, those album numbers will definitely increase as TWICE is gearing up for another comeback. \"BETWEEN 1&2\" will be the girl group's 11th mini album since its debut in 2015.\n\nWith the title track \"TalkThatTalk,\" TWICE is coming back on August 26 of this year. Pre-orders are ongoing and ONCEs are expecting it to get gold certification by RIAJ in no time after its release.\n\nIN CASE YOU MISSED IT: TWICE Becomes Hot Topic Following 'Between 1&2' Trailer- Here's Why\n\nAre you excited about their comeback?\n\nKpopStarz owns this article\n\nWritten by Jaswin Singh"
