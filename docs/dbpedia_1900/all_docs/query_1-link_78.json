        "text": "In case you hadn‚Äôt heard, the year is 2002, the most popular song on the radio is ‚ÄúSk8r Boi,‚Äù and you just got into a huge fight with your mom because she refused to take you to the mall so you could buy some Hot Topic safety pin earrings. Or at least that‚Äôs where I am mentally now that Blink-182‚Äôs Travis Barker is once again an A-lister and out here making pop-punk songs with Machine Gun Kelly.\n\nIn August 2021, MGK released his banging single ‚ÄúPapercuts‚Äù featuring Travis, and just last February he dropped ‚ÄúEmo Girl‚Äù featuring Willow Smith. And honestly‚Ä¶both go h-a-r-d. Much like Machine Gun Kelly‚Äôs career in general right now, tbh. This dude has come a looong way since his days of feuding with Eminem‚Äînow he‚Äôs busy being engaged to Megan Fox (though it's kiiiind of unclear how that's shaping out amid all the rumors that they may have split üëÄ), starring in a bunch of movies that he refuses to promote, and dropping the soundtrack to our angsty summers and winters.\n\nBut questions remain. Like how much money, exactly, has Machine Gun Kelly made since becoming someone who makes headlines almost daily and is casually friends with the Kardashians? Um. A f*cking ton. We‚Äôre getting into his $$$$, but first I‚Äôm making everyone listen to this with me and time-travel to a simpler time when you may or may not have owned a wallet chain:\n\n*Most* of Machine Gun Kelly‚Äôs Money Comes From Music\n\nMachine Gun Kelly started his career by releasing mixtapes, and he blew up so fast that he ended up signing with Bad Boy Records and releasing his debut studio album, Lace Up. And then he just went off. MGK has released four albums since (General Admission, Bloom, Hote Diablo, and Tickets to My Downfall) and just dropped a sixth called Mainstream Sellout in March 2022.\n\nMGK‚Äôs switch from rap to pop-punk was apparently a success, because Tickets to My Downfall did *amazingly* well on the charts. As in, songs from it occupied legit half the spots on Billboard‚Äôs Hot Alternative Songs chart, with ‚ÄúMy Ex‚Äôs Best Friend‚Äù being particularly popular. Apparently, a ton of people downloaded his music‚Äîlike, according to the Recording Industry Association of America, MGK has sold 16.5 million certified units of digital singles. W-O-W.\n\nBut He Also Acts!\n\nI can‚Äôt imagine Machine Gun Kelly has made too much money from his acting career since he tends to take on smaller parts. But still, every paycheck counts! Some things you might have seen him in? Beyond the Lights, Nerve, Bird Box, The Dirt, and‚Äîah, yes‚ÄîMidnight in the Switchgrass, the film he slammed on Twitter:\n\nCan‚Äôt Forget MGK‚Äôs Endorsements\n\nEndorsements and sponcon are two major ways celebrities make money in these dark times, and Machine Gun Kelly has managed to secure himself some pretty fancy deals with the likes of Reebok and Young & Reckless. MGK promoted the Club C sneaker for Reebok, which, frankly, I will be buying immediately:\n\nOh, and he also has his own line of merch, including a range of hats and mugs.\n\nSo What Is Machine Gun Kelly‚Äôs Total Net Worth?"
