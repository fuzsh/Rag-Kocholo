Over 1 million copies sold earns a million certification.\n\nThe band’s two other English singles “Butter” (2021) and “Permission To Dance” (2021) were also certified platinum. For “Butter,” it became the fastest song to achieve the certification in merely 72 days since its release.\n\nWith the latest additions, the band now has a total of eight songs which have been certified platinum, including “Dynamite” (2020), “Boy With Luv” (2019), “Stay Gold” (2020) and “DNA” (2017).\n\nBY LEE JAE-LIM [lee.jaelim@joongang.co.kr]"
