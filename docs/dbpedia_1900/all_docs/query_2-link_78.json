        "text": "Frontman and founding member Chino Moreno's specific and unique lyrical style is often described as ambiguous and indirect. The band's legacy is frequently compared to alternative rock group Radiohead, with some in the media dubbing Deftones \"The Radiohead of metal.” Depeche Mode, Faith No More, Afrika Bambaataa, The Cure, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, Duran Duran, Thompson Twins, and Hum are just a few of Moreno’s well-known influences.\n\nOver the last 30 years, Deftones have released seven studio albums, including three platinums, and one gold certificate for its bestselling self-titled album. From humble beginnings, it’s incredible to see the journey that the band has made.\n\nStephen Carpenter, guitarist of the band, taught himself the instrument while confined to a wheelchair at the age of 15 after he was hit by a car while skateboarding. When his childhood friends, vocalist Chino Moreno and drummer Abe Cunningham, learned he could play, the three began jamming together, and soon formed a group.\n\nThe group featured a rotating cast of instrumentalists in the late ‘80s and early ‘90s, as Cunningham temporarily departed and bassist Chi Cheng joined. With Cunningham’s return in 1993, the band finalized its lineup. Deftones signed a recording contract with Maverick Records and released the first album, Adrenaline, a few years later, in 1995.\n\nThe group’s sophomore effort, Around the Fur, dropped in 1997 and soared up the charts. The singles from the album became the band's first songs to be certified by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\n\nThe band found continued success with the third album, White Pony, in 2000. White Pony marked a transition away from the band’s earlier, more traditional metal sound to a progressive, experimental style. The band enjoyed the most prominent commercial success with the lead single, \"Change (In the House of Flies).\"\n\nDeftones released a self-titled album in 2003, marking the band’s fourth studio effort. Deftones was a darling of critics, but it failed to generate the same commercial success the band saw with White Pony.\n\nDeftones' released its fifth album, Saturday Night Wrist, was released in 2006. Again, the album garnered much critical acclaim, but personal tensions and creative differences among band members impacted the production. Some of these issues inspired the songs included on the album.\n\nIn 2008, Deftones was at work on the next album, \"Eros, tragedy struck. A severe traffic accident in Santa Clara, CA, left bassist Cheng comatose, leading to Cheng's eventual death in 2013. Sergio Vega replaced the bassist in 2009.\n\nDeftones released its sixth album, Diamond Eyes, in 2010. In promotion of the new album, Deftones embarked on a triple-headline tour. Alice in Chains and Mastodon were the other headliners, and the tour encompassed many major North American cities.\n\nKoi No Yokan, the band's seventh album, dropped in 2012, followed by Gore in 2016. Both albums highlighted the band's increasingly experimental shift in style and received high critical praise.\n\nDeftones released its ninth album, Ohms, in September 2020. The album received significant critical acclaim for the return to the band's original sound. At the same time, the band was scheduled to begin a joint tour with Gojira, which was ultimately postponed twice due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn October 2020, the band announced a 20th-anniversary reissue of White Pony, scheduled for release in December of that same year. The special reissue edition was initially packaged along with Black Stallion, a companion remix album featuring guest performances by artists DJ Shadow, Mike Shinoda, and Robert Smith.\n\nIn March 2022, an official announcement was made that bassist Sergio Vega had left the band in early 2021.\n\nAs well as producing several critically acclaimed albums, the band has a Grammy Award under its belt for Best Metal Performance in 2001 for its song “Elite.” Additionally, Deftones also received Album of the Year at the Revolver Golden Gods Awards for Koi No Yokan.\n\nDeftones has spent a large proportion of its career touring locally, internationally, and worldwide."
