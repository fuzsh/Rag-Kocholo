        "text": "The legacy of Linkin Park lives on, as the group just secured additional certifications from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), picking up a few more multi-Platinum, Platinum, and Gold certifications for three singles.\n\nThree tracks from their 2012 LP Living Things, the lead single “Burn It Down,” \"Lost In the Echo,” and \"Castle of Glass\" were among the honored tracks. “Burn It Down” has now gone triple-Platinum (3 million copies sold) as of this writing, while “Lost In the Echo” has now officially reached Gold status (500,000 sold) and \"Castle of Glass\" was certified both Gold and Platinum (500,000 and then 1 million sold).\n\nEarlier this month,Linkin Park and Funko! teamed up again for another album cover figurine, this time Reanimation, the band's 2002 remix LP. In 2020, the toy company took a crack at Linkin Park's Hybrid Theory album. Linkin Park also digitally reissued their 2007 album Minutes To Midnight for its 15th anniversary, which in addition to the original version of the album, features bonus tracks that originally appeared on the Japanese and iTunes versions of the album. Linkin Park's Mike Shinoda recently said in a Twitch stream that no plans other than the aforementioned reissues are in the works for Linkin Park."
