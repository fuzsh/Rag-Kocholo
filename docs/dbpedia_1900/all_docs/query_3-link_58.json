        "text": "Born in St. Louis and raised in Maplewood, NJ, genre-defying, and GRAMMY Award winning recording artist SZA released her major label debut album Ctrl (TDE/RCA) in 2017. Revered for its raw and honest lyrics, it landed at No. 1 on Billboard's R&B Albums chart, No. 2 on the R&B/Hip Hop Albums chart and No. 3 on the Billboard 200 chart, according to Nielsen Music. The now RIAA-certified 3xPlatinum album received five Grammy nominations in 2018 and more than half the songs on Ctrl are currently certified multi-Platinum and Gold. Ctrl remains on the Billboard 200 chart since its release in 2017 and holds the record for the longest run for any Black female artist's debut album. In 2022 alone it sold over 600,000 units and is the 10th best-selling female album this year in the country and 50th best-selling album in 2022 overall.\n\nSZA has won various awards since the release of Ctrl including a 2022 GRAMMY Award for Best Pop Dou/Group Performance for \"Kiss Me More\" with Doja Cat, Billboard Music Awards' Top R&B Female Artist, BET Awards' Best New Artist, BET Soul Train Awards' Best R&B/Soul Female Artist and Best New Artist, MTV Video Music Awards' Best Visual Effects for the \"All The Stars\" with Kendrick Lamar, and NAACP Image Awards' Outstanding New Artist. In 2019, she won NAACP Image Awards' Outstanding Duo or Group for \"All The Stars\" with Kendrick Lamar and Outstanding Soundtrack/Compilation for the Black Panther Soundtrack. SZA also received Billboard's 2019 Women in Music Rule Breaker award.\n\nTo this day, SZA continues to set the standard on creativity and songwriting, while shattering records with over 7.2 billion streams worldwide across all platforms. To close out the trying year of 2020, SZA gifted fans on Christmas Day with the hopeful track \"Good Days.\" Grammy-nominated for Best R&B Song, the single quickly became SZA's greatest gainer solo single release, peaking at #9 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and marking her first time in the chart's top ten as the main artist. December 2021, SZA scored her second lead artist top 10 on Billboard's Hot 100 chart with the official release of \"I Hate U,\" which debuted at #7. The song also entered at #1 on both Spotify and Apple Music US charts and broke the record for the most streamed R&B song by a female artist on Apple Music in its first week. \"Shirt,\" her most recent single has garnered over 60 million streams globally since its release in October. SZA's long-awaited new album SOS includes features by Travis Scott, Don Toliver, Phoebe Bridgers and Ol' Dirty Bastard; with production by Ctrl hitmaking collaborators ThankGod4Cody and Carter Lang, alongside Jeff Bhasker, Rob Bisel, Benny Blanco, Kenny \"Babyface\" Edmonds, Emile Haynie, Rodney \"Darkchild\" Jerkins, Jay Versace, and more."
