        "text": "SEVENTEEN keeps on reaching greater heights on the Japanese music scene as they bag a prestigious double-platinum certification for “Not Alone!”\n\nPowerhouse group SEVENTEEN has proven its influence over the Japanese market once again—but this time it is in conjunction with their latest single album Not Alone.\n\nOn May 14, the Recording Industry Association of Japan (“RIAJ”) announced that SEVENTEEN’s Not Alone has successfully earned a double-platinum certification. The organization awards the said recognition when a certain song or album by an artist reaches 500,000 monthly cumulative net shipments.\n\nThis particularly marks the group’s second Japanese single album to go double platinum following Fallin’ Flower, which was released last April 2020. Making it more meaningful, SEVENTEEN was able to achieve such amazing accolade in less than a month since its successful worldwide release.\n\nWith this, SEVENTEEN also became the first foreign male group to surpass 200,000 first-week sales with three consecutive Japanese singles.\n\nUnveiled on April 21, Not Alone surpassed 500,000 copies sold in April alone. Meanwhile, the title track of the same name also dominated various international music charts such as iTunes Top Songs Chart, Line Music, and Rakuten Music.\n\nProving that they are indeed unstoppable, SEVENTEEN also ranked first on Oricon’s Weekly Singles Ranking Chart with their newest Japanese track.\n\nSEVENTEEN AS A RECORD-BREAKING BOY GROUP\n\nPrior to attaining the aforementioned feat, the talented boy group earned platinum certifications for their second Japanese mini-album 24H and their first single album Happy Ending. Their first Japanese EP We Make You, on the other hand, bagged a gold certification.\n\nThanking CARATs for their continuous support and love, SEVENTEEN said in a statement released through Pledis Entertainment, “Thank you to CARATs, who always give us their support. We are sincerely grateful that a song in which we promise a reunion with CARATs is receiving love from so many people. We will become a group that always works hard and remains humble so that you can be proud of us.”\n\nMeanwhile, SEVENTEEN has been putting colors onto fans’ days with their weekly variety show GOING SEVENTEEN. They are also nominated for the upcoming 2021 BBMAs.\n\nBTS, SEVENTEEN, BLACKPINK Nominated At The 2021 BBMAs\n\nSource: Herald Pop\n\nPhoto from Pledis Entertainment"
