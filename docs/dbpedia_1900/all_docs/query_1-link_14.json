        "text": "LE SSERAFIM\n\nhas been certified as \"Platinum\" in the streaming sector by the Japan Record Association.\n\nAccording to an announcement by the Japan Record Association on the 27th, the title track of LE SSERAFIM's second mini-album \"ANTIFRAGILE\" exceeded 100 million cumulative plays as of May, obtaining the \"Platinum\" certification.\n\nAs of January this year, \"ANTIFRAGILE\" was certified as a streaming \"Gold\" by the Japanese Record Association, exceeding 50 million cumulative plays. Since then, 50 million more streams have been played in just four months, reaching 100 million.\n\nThis is even more meaningful as it was achieved ahead of LE SSERAFIM's comeback in Japan. They will release their second single \"UNFORGIVEN\" locally on August 23. The new album will contain a total of three songs, including the Japanese version of the first full-length album title song \"UNFORGIVEN\" and \"ANTIFRAGILE,\" released in Korea in May, and a new song in collaboration with popular artists.\n\nFollowing the title track \"UNFORGIVEN\" of his first full-length album, LE SSERAFIM is receiving a lot of attention for the song \"Eve, Psyche and Blue Beard's Wife.\" The song shows a steady rise in the ranking on the domestic music charts, including reaching #4 on Melon.\n\nSource"
