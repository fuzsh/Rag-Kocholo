        "text": "The National Music Publishers Association (NMPA) has revealed the top songwriters in the US for the fourth quarter of 2023, recognizing the top artist-songwriter and non-performing songwriter of the period.\n\nFrom October to December, a total of 1,843 Gold, Platinum and Multi-Platinum certifications were awarded.\n\nAmerican singer-songwriter Lana Del Rey, known for her poignant and nostalgic compositions, emerged as the top artist-songwriter, securing 20 certifications including the 8X PlatinumÂ Summertime Sadness, the 3X PlatinumÂ Off to the Races,Â and the Double PlatinumÂ West Coast, which are all published by Sony Music Publishing.\n\nDel Rey, now published by Universal Music Publishing Group, continues to captivate listeners with her unique blend of melancholic pop, infused with vintage Hollywood allure and themes of tragic romance.\n\nBorn Elizabeth Woolridge Grant, she has produced nine full-length albums throughout her career including her second studio album, Born to Die (2012), which emerged as the fifth best-selling album globally in its year of release.\n\nBorn to Die was also named as the International Album of the Year by the Danish Music Awards in 2012 and the GAFFA Awards in Denmark and Norway. It also secured the Best International Pop Video award in the UK Music Video Awards.\n\nDel Rey went on to receive the Ivor Novello Award for Best Contemporary Song for Video Games, a track from Born to Die. She also received the Billboard Women in Music – Trailblazer Award in 2015, Variety’s Decade Award at the Variety Hitmakers Awards in 2021, and the Billboard Women in Music Awards – Visionary Award in 2023.\n\nIn 2023, Lana Del Rey continued her artistic journey with the release of her ninth studio album, Did You Know That There’s a Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd, marking her fourth album in less than four years.\n\nâQ4 saw some of the last decadeâs biggest hits be rewarded for their continuing popularity. Noahâs massive success with Drake continues to enjoy huge numbers, and Lana Del Rey cemented her legacy as a game-changing songwriter and artist.”\n\nDavid Israelite, NMPA\n\nMeanwhile, Noah “40” Shebib claimed the title of the top non-performing songwriter on the NMPAâs Gold & Platinum Program, amassing 13 certifications for songs such as the Multi-Platinum certified One Dance, God’s Plan, In My Feelings, and Started from the Bottom, all recorded by Drake. He is published by Kobalt.\n\nâQ4 saw some of the last decadeâs biggest hits be rewarded for their continuing popularity. Noahâs massive success with Drake continues to enjoy huge numbers, and Lana Del Rey cemented her legacy as a game-changing songwriter and artist. We are thrilled to honor all of the quarterâs Gold & Platinum hitmakers,â said NMPA President & CEO David Israelite.\n\nThe full list of songwriters and publishers honored can be found here.\n\nIn conjunction with the Recording Industry Association of Americaâs (RIAAâs) Gold & Platinum Program, the NMPA acknowledges and certifies the songwriters and publishers behind RIAA-certified singles.\n\nThe RIAAÂ incorporates both sales and on-demand streams when determining the Gold (500,000), Platinum (1 million), and Multi-Platinum (2 million or more) thresholds.\n\nSince its inception in 2007, the NMPA program has celebrated the talent and artistry of thousands of songwriters. Among the recipients of the NMPA Gold & Platinum Program are luminaries Luke Combs,Â BeyoncÃ©,Â Juice WRLD,Â Kane Brown,Â Lil Nas X, Kanye West,Â J.Cole,Â Lil Baby, and Lin-Manuel Miranda.\n\nMusic Business Worldwide"
