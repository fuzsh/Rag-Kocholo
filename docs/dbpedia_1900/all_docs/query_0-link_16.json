        "text": "Thank God I Found You\n\n“Thank God I Found You” is a collaboration with R&B singer Joe and American boy band 98 Degrees that Mariah wrote with with Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis for her Rainbow album. “We were just sitting in a studio vibing off each other,” she explained about the creative process. “‘Thank God I Found You’ was a love song inspired by a relationship I was in at the time. I sang it to Jimmy and Terry and we put the song together from there. They have been so inspirational to me throughout my life. Growing up, I listened to so many songs they have written which are classics.”\n\n“When she called me to come to the studio I had no idea I would record at that moment,” Joe said. “I couldn't let the opportunity slip away. She sat in the control room while I was singing in the booth and it was amazing to have her sit there and watch her smile and be in her zone.” Jam and Lewis originally wanted R&B duo K-Ci and JoJo to sing on the track. “They were on a different record label and there were a lot of problems getting clearance for them to do it,” they remembered. “We booked studio time and kept saying to them, ‘Just come in and sing it, you could nail it in an hour. We'll worry about the politics later.’ ”\n\n“Thank God I Found You” was released as the second single from Rainbow on January 25, 2000. It became Mariah's fifteenth number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100 chart during the week of February 19, 2000, marking her eleventh consecutive year with a number-one song, and was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America on February 23, 2000.\n\nRemixes\n\nMariah recorded new vocals for the Make It Last remix, which interpolates Keith Sweat's 1987 hit “Make It Last Forever” and features rapper Nas. “It's become one of my trademarks to revisit my songs when we do remixes,” Mariah told Billboard. “To me, it's not good enough to just let someone go into the studio and add some beats or samples to my songs. Inevitably, I wind up rewriting a lot of the song, or rearranging the vocals and melodies. It's a fun exercise in that it allows me to rethink the song and add some new ideas.”\n\nIn 2024, to commemorate Rainbow's 25th anniversary, a previously-unreleased Mariah-only version of “Thank God I Found You” was included as a bonus track on the digital expanded edition of the album. Additional remixes were produced by Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis and StarGate.\n\nSong Remix Run time Thank God I Found You\n\nMariah Only Version\n\n4:16 Thank God I Found You\n\nCelebratory Mix\n\nProduced by Jimmy Jam, Terry Lewis.\n\n4:15 Thank God I Found You\n\nStarGate Radio Edit\n\nProduced by StarGate.\n\n4:19 Thank God I Found You\n\nMake It Last Remix feat.

Joe and 98 Degrees visited MTV's Total Request Live on October 14, 1999, for the world premiere of the music video, with Mariah calling in from Spain. “[The video] was shot in Minneapolis in the summer,” Mariah explained. “The song wasn't even done yet — it was written, but the record wasn't mixed or anything. We performed it in front of 30 to 40 thousand people. We did it twice and the second time the crowd was singing along, so that was really cool.”\n\nMake It Last Remix\n\nThe Make It Last Remix video for “Thank God I Found You” was filmed in October 1999 at the Rossi Bar in Germany and New York. It premiered on BET's 106 & Park on November 3, 1999, and was directed by Sanaa Hamri. “The remix video was shot in Hamburg and in New York. It's a club feel, very natural,” Mariah explained. “We weren't done with the record yet, I was in the studio the night before singing and the rap wasn't even on it yet, I kinda like to do things spur of the moment. But it's a fun video and there's a really cute puppy in it and some really nice shots of my shoes!”\n\nThis video marked Sanaa Hamri's directorial debut, who would later go on to work with people like Jay-Z, Prince and Lenny Kravitz. “One day [Mariah] turned to me and said, ‘You know, you really should direct,’ ” Hamri told CNN. “And then I got the opportunity to direct her in this video called ‘Thank God I Found You (Remix).’ It was extremely natural to me and I realized that Mariah was right — this is where I belong.”\n\nReleases\n\nUnited States\n\nIn the United States, the “Thank God I Found You” Single was released on CD and Cassette, including the Album Version and the Celebratory Mix of the song. The CD Maxi Single includes the Make It Last Remix Edit, the Make It Last Remix w/o Rap, the Album Version of “Thank God I Found You” and “Babydoll,” from Mariah's Butterfly album. “Thank God I Found You” was also released on 12\" Vinyl, including the Make It Last Remix, the Make It Last Remix Instrumental, the Celebratory Mix and the Bad Boy remix of “Fantasy,” featuring Ol'Dirty Bastard.\n\nEurope\n\nEurope saw the release of three “Thank God I Found You” CD Singles, two CD Maxi Singles and a 12\" Vinyl.
