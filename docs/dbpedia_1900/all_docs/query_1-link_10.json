        "text": "ince its inception in 1958, the Recording Industry Association of AmericaÂ® (RIAA) has been honoring artists whose music not only spans generations but also achieves significant milestones in U.S. sales and streaming. As we approach the end of the year, it's a time to acknowledge the top albums, singles, and debut artists for their remarkable accomplishments. The #RIAAClassOf 2023 features an impressive roster of 57 emerging artists who have received their inaugural Gold & Platinum certifications this year, encompassing three albums and 48 singles.\n\nKey Highlights of 2023:\n\nLeading the charge is Peso Pluma, whose album 'GÃ©nesis' has been recognized as the highest-certified album by a new artist, proudly brandishing a Platinum certification. Ice Spice, a name resonating across the charts, has firmly established her dominance in the Class Of 2023. Her repertoire includes multiple Gold singles such as âMunch (Feelinâ U)â and âIn Ha Mood.â Further elevating her status is her Platinum collaboration with PinkPantheress on âBoyâs A Liar Pt. 2.â\n\nSpeaking of Country music, Megan Moroney has carved a niche for herself with the 2x Platinum single âTennessee Orange,â achieving the highest solo certification in this genre within the Class Of 2023. This accomplishment underscores her significant impact and growing influence in the country music scene.\n\nKenshi Yonezu has etched his name in history by introducing the first-ever full Japanese language track to receive RIAA certification. His single âKick Backâ has been adorned with a Gold certification, marking a milestone in the recognition of Japanese music on a global platform.\n\nJung Kook of BTS has achieved a personal milestone with his first RIAA solo certification for the Platinum single âSeven,â featuring Latto. Furthermore, his fellow BTS member, Jimin, has achieved the same recognition with \"Like Crazy.\"\n\nLaufey, with her Gold single âFrom The Start,â holds the unique distinction of being the only Jazz certification in both the Class of 2023 and Year-End lists. This achievement not only highlights her individual talent but also the enduring appeal of Jazz music.\n\nThe Class of 2023 has been a remarkable year for breakthroughs, with 15 new artists surpassing the 1,000,000 unit mark to achieve Platinum status, and 33 artists reaching the Gold threshold with 500,000 units (encompassing sales and streaming equivalents). This achievement highlights the evolving consumption patterns in the music industry and the broad appeal of these artists.\n\nThe diversity of genres represented in the #RIAAClassOf 2023 is a reflection of the eclectic tastes of the modern listener. The list includes 16 R&B/Hip-Hop, 12 Pop, 7 Country, 6 Dance/Electronic, 2 Alternative, 2 Latin, 1 Christian/Gospel, 1 Jazz, 1 Rock, and 1 Soundtrack title, all of which have been inducted into the prestigious Gold & Platinum program. This diversity not only celebrates the range of musical styles but also the inclusive nature of the music industry today.\n\nRIAA Gold and Platinum Awards: Class of 2023, Full List:\n\nAlbums:\n\nPeso Pluma | GÃ©mesis, Prajin Parlay Inc. - platinum\n\nStray Kids | 5-Star, JYPÂ Entertainment / Imperial - gold\n\nTOMORROWÂ XÂ TOGETHER | THE NAME CHAPTER: TEMPTATION, Big Hit Music / Imperial / Republic Records\n\nMulti-Platinim &Â Platinum Singles:Â\n\nKane Brown &Â Katelyn Brown | Thank God, RCA Nashville\n\nMegan Moroney | Tennessee Orange, Arista Nashville / Columbia Records\n\nDavid Kushner | Daylight, David Kushner\n\nHailey Whitters | Everything She Ain't, Pigasus Records / Big Loud REecords / Songs & Daughters\n\nHitkidd, GloRilla | F.N.F.
