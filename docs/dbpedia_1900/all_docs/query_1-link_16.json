        "text": "ILLIT has added another record in Japan for their debut album.\n\nAccording to the Japan Recording Industry Association, the mini album's title track \"Magnetic\" has been certified \"platinum\" in the streaming category. As of last month, it has accumulated over 100 million plays.\n\nThe Japan Recording Industry Association grants certifications each month based on the cumulative number of plays of a song. There are three levels of certification: Gold (50 million or more plays), Platinum (100 million or more plays), and Diamond (500 million or more plays).\n\nThe record was achieved within about three months of the song's release. This is the shortest time ever for a song by a female group, including local artists. ILLIT has also mesmerised fans in the archipelago.\n\n\"Magnetic\" was also hot on the Japanese music charts, taking the top spot in the New Artist category of the Tower Records Music 2024 H1 Streaming Rankings.\n\nIn the \"Line Music 2024 H1 Rankings,\" the group ranked in the top 10 in the \"Top 10 Trending Rankings\" and \"BGM Rankings. She remains at the top of major local music charts such as Spotify Japan.\n\nThe fashion world has also taken notice. ILLIT recently shot a photo shoot with Vogue Japan for their September issue. She turned heads with her more mature visuals.\n\nMeanwhile, \"Magnetic\" is a song that compares the feeling of being drawn to someone you like to a magnet. The song has an addictive melody and ILLIT's cheerful vocals."
