        "text": "The 16-year NBA veteran gives children gift bags, shirts and autographs at his annual hometown basketball clinic\n\nPEEKSKILL – While NBA team training camps are in full swing to prepare for the upcoming season, Elton Brand is coming home.\n\nNo, the 16-year veteran hasn't retired — not yet, at least — but he's returning to Peekskill for his annual Youth Day basketball clinic on Saturday at Peekskill High School.\n\nThe hometown hero, who was drafted first overall in the 1999 NBA Draft out of Duke University, has been giving back to the Peekskill community for years. The basketball clinic, which he started with his mother, Daisy, 11 years ago, is a celebration of the city's most popular sport.\n\nA month before last year's clinic, Daisy passed away at age 64 from stomach cancer. It was her generosity, having started C.A.M.P., Inc., a non-profit organization founded in 2004 and dedicated to the betterment of the city's youth, that always kept Elton close with Peekskill.\n\nAt last year's Youth Day, Brand gave the nearly 300 participants a pair of Nike sneakers to go with the gift bag, t-shirt and autograph given in years past. Brand, along with legendary Peekskill coach Lou Panzanaro and members of the Red Devils team, works with athletes ranging from ages on different aspects of the game.\n\n\"He wants to see a smile on all the kids' faces and improve their game, even if it's just a little,\" Brand's cousin Joyce Armstrong said. Armstrong has taken over the organizing duties that her Aunt Daisy held for 10 years.\n\nMore surprises are in store for this year, Armstrong said, but she wouldn't reveal any details.\n\nPast attendees at the clinic include former Knicks start John Starks, New York Liberty legend Teresa Witherspoon and fellow hometown NBA pick Hilton Armstrong.\n\nBrand, 36, played in limited action last season for the Atlanta Hawks, who lost in the Eastern Conference Finals. He is currently a free agent, though there are rumors that Brand could soon announce his retirement from the NBA. Joyce Armstrong would neither confirm or deny the rumor.\n\nYouth Day also falls just one day after TMZ released a report that Brand has filed for separation from his estranged wife, Shahara Simmons.\n\nElton Brand Youth Day begins at 11 a.m. For more information, call 914-737-3300."
