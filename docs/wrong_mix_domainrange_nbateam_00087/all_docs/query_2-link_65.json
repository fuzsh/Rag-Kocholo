        "text": "Several other teams have expressed interest in Brand, according to the source. Brand is attracted to the Knicks because of their winning culture and first-class organization. In addition, the team is close to his hometown — he’s from Cortlandt Manor, N.Y., and his mother, Daisy, still lives nearby — and qualify of life is important to him as he decides on his next team.\n\nSeeing his team fall 10 games below .500 on Jan. 9 after also beginning the year without Nowitzki for the first 27 games, Brand would assist the Mavs’ veteran leaders in staging a late-season rally to get back into the playoff conversation before finishing up by breaking even at 41-41. Now, Brand hopes to continue calling Dallas his home as the Mavericks’ front office tries to build a team capable of competing in the Western Conference. “You know, free agent-wise, of course I’d like to be back,” Brand said. “Like I said, .500 for this organization, that’s definitely a failure. I don’t want to be a part of that. It left a bad taste, so I definitely want to be here on a winning team and try to rectify what happened this season if possible.”"
