        "text": "The Philadelphia 76ers season has ended really badly. After a year full of ups and downs in which the viability of the project – the connection between Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons – was questioned, those from Pennsylvania hoped to take a step forward in the Orlando bubble to show that they were ready for battle. It has not been. Simmons fell injured and could not be in the first round of the playoffs against the Boston Celtics, in which the Sixers have been swept by the Boston Celtics with a resounding 4-0.\n\nThe first consequence of Philadelphia's early goodbye to the season has been the dismissal of Brett Brown. After seven years at the helm of the team, the coach The Process gives way to a new stage in which, however, everything indicates that there will be few changes in the foundations beyond his farewell. Elton Brand, general manager of the organization, stated a few days ago that He has no intention of trading Embiid or Simmons. Now he completes this statement by ensuring that he continues to owe the city of Philadelphia.\n\n«We owe it to them. We owe it to these fans. I owe it to this city to meet our goals,\" says Keith Pompey of The Philadelphia Inquirer before ensuring that he has no doubts that the future can be bright and that this bad moment will be nothing more than a setback. «Of course we can overcome this obstacle. It's time to improve. \"That moment begins right now.\"\n\nThe truth is that Philadelphia has had the feeling of not being able to take the last step for some time. The foundation of the team, with two enormous players like Embiid and Simmons at the helm, is firm. A different matter is whether they know how to build around it. In the 2018/19 season, with guys like JJ Redick or Jimmy Butler on the roster, they seemed to be really close to being able to reach the top; So much so that the Toronto Raptors (champions) could only finish them off in seven games and with a shot from Kawhi Leonard at the buzzer. In the present, rushing out of the playoffs, the context is different.\n\nLue, the favorite for the bench\n\nThat's how it is. Tyronn Lue, the coach who won the ring in Cleveland with LeBron James, seems to be at the forefront of the race to take the position of head coach of the Pennsylvania franchise, as emphasized by the aforementioned journalist. If the 76ers choose him for the position, they will have to dig deep into their pockets, since according to Clevis Murray of The Athletic the now assistant Los Angeles Clippers could ask for seven million dollars per season. In any case, it is too early to assure anything, since other teams follow in Lue's footsteps.\n\n(Photo by Mitchell Leff/Getty Images)"
