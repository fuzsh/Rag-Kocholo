        "text": "TORONTO — Elton Brand scored a season-high 25 points, Andre Miller and Andre Iguodala each had 18, and the Philadelphia 76ers snapped a three-game losing streak by beating the Toronto Raptors 106-96 on Wednesday night.\n\nWillie Green scored 17 points and Marreese Speights had 12 for the 76ers, who won for the first time in four road games this season.\n\nBrand, who had scored just 31 total points in Philadelphia’s past three games, eclipsed his previous high of 24, set in an Oct. 31 victory over New York.\n\nChris Bosh had 30 points and 12 rebounds, but Toronto still lost for the fourth time in five games after starting the season 3-0. Jermaine O’Neal added 19 points and 11 rebounds, and reserve Andrea Bargnani scored 15 for the Raptors.\n\nThe 76ers, who had been held below 90 points in each of their past three games, passed that barrier on a jumper by Brand with 7:27 left in the fourth, putting them up 91-80.\n\nPhiladelphia led 26-13 after one quarter before 11 points from Bargnani and six consecutive points by Bosh helped Toronto close the gap to 46-45 with 1:20 left in the second. But a tip-in by Speights and a 3-pointer from Green gave the 76ers a 51-45 edge at the half.\n\nToronto guard Jose Calderon went to the locker room for treatment on a tight right hamstring after clutching at his leg at the end of the first. Calderon played 13 more minutes in the second and third quarters before leaving the game for good with 4:42 remaining in the third.\n\nNotes:@ Philadelphia had averaged more than 18 turnovers in its past three games, but cut that to 13 on Wednesday. … The Raptors had won eight of their previous 10 games against the 76ers."
