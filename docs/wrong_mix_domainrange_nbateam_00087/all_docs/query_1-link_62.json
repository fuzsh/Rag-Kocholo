        "text": "It has been a long search but the Philadelphia 76ers finally found someone to fill their vacant general manager position and that would be former Delaware Blue Coats general manager Elton Brand.\n\nBrand was named general manager of the franchise on Tuesday, according to ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski.\n\nBrand was promoted this off season by the 76ers to executive vice president of basketball operations.\n\nBefore the promotion, Brand served a year as the general manager of the 76ers NBA G-League affiliate Delaware Blue Coats.\n\nThe former 76ers player definitely has impressed the front office in his two years working there as Brand started as player-development consultant in 2016.\n\nRelated:Philadelphia 76ers Hire Elton Brand As GM Of G-League Team Delaware 87ers\n\nAccording to Wojnarowski, “Brand had sold the ownership and Brett Brown on vision, preparedness and the ability to grow into the role at a crucial time for the organization.”\n\nBrand beat out several former general managers for the position as they were Utah Jazz assistant GM Justin Zanik, Houston Rockets vice president Gersson Rosas and assistant Golden State Warriors GM Larry Harris, according to Wojnarowski.\n\nThe former NBA player will have a challenge to continue the success that team had last year with 52 wins. The franchise is definitely hoping players like Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons will continue to dominate the league as they did last season.\n\nLiberty Baller’s contributor Eric Sidewater makes a great point that Brand is loved in the front office and is open to everything there. Then, on the other side he is someone that players can relate to which could bring in good talent.\n\nBrand was a former number one draft pick out of Duke University who earned Co-Rookie of the Year with Steve Francis when he was with the Bulls.\n\nOne of his last stops in his playing career was with the Philadelphia 76ers where he signed a five year, 82 million contract with the team.\n\nIn five seasons with the 76ers ( 2008-2012 & 2015-2016) Brand played 263 games, started 222 games, 6.3 points per game, .488 FG percentage, .746 Free Throw percentage, 8.5 rebounds per game, 1.7 assists, 1.2 steals and 1.5 blocks.\n\nFor his career overall, Brand averaged 15.3 points per game, 8.5 rebounds per game, 2.1 assists, 50 % FG and 73.6% FT."
