        "text": "Allen Iverson was the first overall pick in the 1996 NBA draft. Three years later, Elton Brand received the same accolade. From opponents to teammates, their careers crossed paths for 11 years.\n\nBrand returned to the Sixers in January for his 17th season. A month later, Iverson was named a finalist for the Basketball Hall of Fame. The class of 2016 will be announced Monday.\n\n“[He] put the team on his back, put the city on his back, brought them to the Finals,” Brand said of Iverson. “[He was the] scoring champ many years. He definitely deserves it.”\n\nBrand got his first experience playing against Iverson early in his career. As a rookie on the Chicago Bulls in 1999, he faced the Sixers in just his fifth regular season game. Iverson scored 35 points, including 16 for 23 at the line, seven rebounds, six assists and three steals in 42 minutes in the Sixers’ 92-86 win on Nov. 12, 1999.\n\nEven though they played different positions, Iverson’s ability to get to the basket made defending him a team effort.\n\n“He'd see the mismatches and he'd just exploit them,” Brand said. “That crossover was unstoppable. The way he finished around the rim was uncanny.”\n\nYears later, they were joined together through Team USA basketball. Brand got to see a different perspective of Iverson. He witnessed the preparation, not just the final result as an opponent.\n\n“Playing with him on USA teams, seeing his motor and his joy of basketball, his basketball IQ is very, very underrated,” Brand said. “He knew how to get fouls. He knew how to play the game. He was a special player.”\n\nBrand and Iverson became teammates on the Sixers when Iverson re-signed with the team in December 2009. By that time, Brand was in his 11th NBA season and A.I. was playing in his 14th. Iverson appeared in 25 games before being released in March.\n\n“He worked hard,” Brand said of Iverson’s final season. “They were joking about practice, practice, things like that. That's the ongoing joke, but he practiced. He got extra shots. … He was just a wonderful, all-around teammate to be around.”\n\nHaving played with and against Iverson gave Brand a unique appreciation of what he brought to the game.\n\n\"One-sixty-five, they said 6-1 but he's probably 5-11,\" Brand said. \"He's just relentless, played through every injury. He represented Philadelphia the right way.\""
