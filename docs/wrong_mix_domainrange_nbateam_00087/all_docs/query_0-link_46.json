Barnes averaged 15.3 points in each of his first two seasons. He is a strong defender and continues to develop in the passing game, dishing out 4.8 assists per game last season. And other starters O.G. Anunoby and Jakob Poeltl complement the lineup well with size and tough defense. New head coach Darko Rajakovic has Toronto headed in the right direction.\n\nScotiabank Arena has unique premium seating options for patrons.

The Raptors’ current roster should help that trend continue. Pascal Siakam is the longest tenured star for the Canada-based squad. Siakam just averaged a career-high 24.2 points while tallying nearly eight rebounds and six assists in 2022-23. Next to Pascal is young forward Scottie Barnes. Barnes averaged 15.3 points in each of his first two seasons. He is a strong defender and continues to develop in the passing game, dishing out 4.8 assists per game last season. And other starters O.G. Anunoby and Jakob Poeltl complement the lineup well with size and tough defense. New head coach Darko Rajakovic has Toronto headed in the right direction.\n\nScotiabank Arena has unique premium seating options for patrons. The Sher Club and Air Canada Signature Club provide great experiences and high-end amenities. The Sher Club, a members-only area, is invite only. Designed for Canadian rapper Drake, the Club has top-notch service in an intimate 4,000 square foot space. The Air Canada Signature Club also has a fine dining restaurant and a premium bar and lounge. Suites at Scotiabank are also fantastic spaces for a group. The Mastercard 200 Level Executive Suites include a floor of 12 tickets (accommodate up to 20 guests), private in-suite service, early access, VIP entrance, catering, and more. The 500 and 600 Level Theatre Suites have at least eight tickets (accommodate up to 14 guests) with similar amenities.\n\nPast Spotlights\n\nAfter a down year likely due to playing their home games in Tampa, Florida due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Raptors returned home last year and were back in the playoffs as a 5-seed. They hope to continue to improve with reigning Rookie of the Year Scottie Barnes, who is back with usual suspects Pascal Siakam, Fred VanVleet, and OG Anunoby. The team has size, and Nick Nurse uses the matchups to his advantage.\n\nIf you haven’t checked out the Air Canada Club at Scotiabank Arena, now is the time. First-class dining awaits, and then at game time, head up to the 100-level seats that give you the best view of the game. The Mastercard Club Courtsides are another popular option, but the 200 Level and 500 & 600 Level Suites provide a luxurious gameday experience for workplace or family gatherings, holding from 12 to 40 people.\n\nA return to normalcy is what the Raptors seek more than anything. After relocating to Tampa for a beleaguered season full of injuries and a COVID-19 outbreak, a return to Toronto in front of a full\n\ncapacity crowd is just what this franchise three years removed from a NBA Championship needs. Former Coach of the Year Nick Nurse will lean heavily on his “Big 3” of Pascal Siakam, Fred VanFleet, and OG Anunoby to get back to the postseason. Gone is one of the most highly decorated and respected players in team history, Kyle Lowry, but both Goran Dragic and Precious Achiuwa, who were acquired in that trade with Miami should see many minutes in the rotation. No. 4 overall draft pick Scottie Barnes could slide right into the starting lineup, potentially joined there by Gary Trent Jr., who made great strides in limited time last season. After a year without basketball in Ontario’s Queen City, fans can welcome themselves back with Scotiabank Arena’s most popular premium option: Platinum Club Seats. Terrific views come with access to the Platinum Club Restaurant. Scotia Club Combo Seats offer the complete entertainment package and admittance to the private Scotia Club. The Mastercard Club Courtsides remain the hottest ticket in town, but the Mastercard 200 Level Executive and 500 & 600 Level Theatre Suites provide a luxurious gameday experience for workplace or family gatherings.\n\nTOP\n\n×\n\nScotiabank Arena / Toronto Raptors Suite Map and Seating Chart\n\nThe seating chart below shows where the Toronto Raptors suites at Scotiabank Arena are located.\n\n×\n\nStay in Touch\n\nBook a Suite\n\nThank you\n\nThank you for submitting your request.

If this is the case, certain clients are willing to pay a premium to be in a lower level suite that is closest to the action on the field. We will give you details on suite location as we provide you with availability for the game you desire.\n\nDoes it pay to wait to book a suite until closer to the event?\n\nWith regular tickets, prices will often drop in the days leading up to a game. While every once in a while the same occurs with suites, in general, pricing does not drop before the game. In fact, because of the very limited availability of luxury suites, it is advised to book a suite well in advance, as suites are often not available at the last minute. In addition, in coordinating events for larger groups (suites can hold up to 20 guests or more), it is often necessary to give guests a longer lead time to confirm their availability to attend.\n\nAre there additional expenses I should consider?\n\nIf you are hosting guests in your suite, consider allocating enough budget to order catering for your suite. Catering is typically not included in the price of the suite. Suite Experience Group clients typically spend between $1,000-$2,000 for catering, with some clients spending even more if they order significant amounts of alcohol.\n\nAre there discounts if I buy multiple games at once?\n\nSome clients purchase multiple suites in multiple venues at one time. Suite Experience Group can provide special package pricing for clients who buy three or more suites at one time.\n\nHow can I maximize my budget?\n\nIf you are working within a budget and trying to maximize your spend, we would welcome an opportunity to further discuss your goals for the event and the different options available to you. Please call us at 800-592-7043 or fill out this form to get started. We look forward to the opportunity to help you explore your options in renting a luxury suite."
