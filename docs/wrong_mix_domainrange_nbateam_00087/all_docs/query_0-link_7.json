Hats off to the champs. ... It just shows me we were close, we are close.”\n\n»READ MORE: The Sixers can take a lot of lessons from the Raptors in the NBA Finals, one in particular | David Murphy\n\nSo, Brand’s goal this summer is to get better through the draft and free agency to be able to compete at that level.\n\n\" It definitely hurts,\" he said of losing that heartbreaker to the eventual champions. “From the players, the coaches, my staff we want to grow and get better.”"
