        "text": "ESPN's Quinn Buckner: Having run the triple-post offense in Dallas, I know you need a player like Elton Brand. He can penetrate through a defense with his size and quickness. He has great hands, and he's a smart player, having played for Mike Krzyzewski at Duke. He can step out and shoot the ball, but he's a great post-up presence as well.\n\nESPN's Kevin Loughery: It surprised me that he measured out at 6-foot-8, but he's got the wingspan of a 7-footer. Brand is a great low-post player because he has great hands. He can also run the floor very well.\n\nESPN's David Aldridge: I hate to be a cynic, but Brand's agent, David Falk, represents a lot of future free agents, like New Jersey's Keith Van Horn. A team like Chicago is certainly going to have a lot of cap room both this year and next year, when Van Horn becomes a free agent. There might be some winks and nudges here that if you take my guy first, I'll deliver more guys later.\n\nAldridge: The only real question is his knee, with the ACL injury he had last year. Other than that, Davis would be a great fit running the offense down in Charlotte.\n\nBuckner: I saw him play a number of times after his knee injury, and I felt he still had most of his explosiveness. Davis is a great talent, and Charlotte needs some leadership at the point, so he's going to the right team.\n\nLoughery: This really changes things for the Clippers. They might go with the next point guard, but they still have Lamar Odom out there. It just goes to show that if you have some character issues, you can get passed over, because Odom was definitely one of the top three players in the draft.\n\nBuckner: The Clippers took who they felt was the best player available. The Clippers needed star power, but I still think Wally Szczerbiak is the best guy left here. Odom, by far, is the most talented player. He's a 6-10 small forward, and if you can get talent and height, you go for it\n\nAldridge: If Odom plays the way he's capable of playing, the Los Angeles Clippers have just rejoined the NBA.The first inklings we heard in analysis of Odom compared him to Danny Manning, whom the Clippers drafted long ago. The Clips have basically two pieces -- Michael Olowokandi and Maurice Taylor -- and they have as many as eight free agents. So they very well could be looking to replace five to six guys. But Odom is a great start, and he brings star power.\n\nAldridge If you look at Wally Szczerbiak and Kevin Garnett together on the front line, that's pretty darn good.\n\nBuckner: Who they really got here is a player a lot like Tom Gugliotta. But Wally is a better shooter than Googs, and he can really stretch a defense. He also probably has a little bit better feel for the game than Googs, because this young man has been around basketball for his entire life.\n\nLoughery: Szczerbiak is a much better athlete than people give him credit for. He faced double- and triple-teams almost every game in his college career. Minnesota got a terrific player here. He has good range on his jumper, and a small forward with good range is a great combination in the NBA.\n\nBuckner: I really like him. The Cavs' Wayne Embry sees a guy with some poise. Miller is a fifth-year senior, and he was well coached by Rick Majerus at Utah. This move now makes Brevin Knight expendable. Miller can explore. He explores the teeth of the defense.If the shot's not there, he can pass off. But he also can take it all the way and finish.\n\nLoughery: He can also defend for a point guard. We saw in the Finals how important that is. This kid can defend, but he's also a true point guard. He's a good passer, and will make those around him better.\n\nAldridge: I think Randy Witman will be the coach of this team, and they're really loaded now -- with Shawn Kemp, Zydrunas Ilgauskas, Cedric Henderson, Derek Anderson and Brevin Knight. Plus, they've got the 11th pick, and we might see them go big there -- especially if Ilgauskas' injury isn't fully healed.\n\nLoughery: Terry was the best clutch player I saw in college basketball last season. He took the key shot, demanded the basketball and went after it. He can also pull up and shoot the ball on a fast-break situation, which is rare in today's game.\n\nBuckner: You want guys coming down the stretch who aren't afraid to catch the ball and shoot it. Terry wants the ball in the clutch, and he makes things happen.\n\nAldridge: The addition of Terry, along with that trade for Bimbo Coles, gives the Hawks a good backcourt and replaces Mookie Blaylock. However, I don't think Atlanta is done yet. The Hawks need a little edge, and they need a little attitude. They've got a lot of nice guys down in Atlanta. That's why I think before it's all said and done, you might see John Starks end up down there in Atlanta.\n\nBuckner: This 7-3 center from Barton County Community College in Kansas has got skills. He was a player who was going to Ohio State, but he played something like 19 minutes of professional ball overseas and that forced him to enter the draft. He can shoot the ball a little bit. He doesn't have overall size. He only weighs 245, but he has put on 25 pounds of that in the last year. He can speak the language well, and he has a good sense of humor in the language.\n\nLoughery: He's 7-3, and he's athletic. Those two things will give you a chance in the NBA. He needs to build up his body to play in the NBA. But they say he plays like Vlade Divac, and that's obviously a very skilled player.\n\nBuckner: Artest has flat-out skills. He can play the game, and he plays it with passion. This is a really good pick for the Bulls.\n\nAldridge: I really like this pick. I think Ron Artest is a heck of a player. The Bulls might be dealing Toni Kukoc, and if they deal him, they've still got Brand and Artest up front. You can see this thing starting to come together for the Chicago Bulls.\n\nBuckner: Thomas has a history of injuries. New Mexico has had a tough time keeping him on the floor. When he's got it going offensively, however, Thomas is very good.\n\nLoughery: He's a highly skilled player. But if you have a player in college who you're concerned about him giving 100 percent every night, that's scary. But a lot of teams think they have a chance of turning him around. He has a big body and can be a strong frontcourt player. The real key is whether the Rockets can get him to play -- and play hard -- every night."
