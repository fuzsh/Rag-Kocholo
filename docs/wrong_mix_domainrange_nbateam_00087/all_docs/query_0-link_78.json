        "text": "AP Photo/Matt Rourke\n\nThe NBA trade deadline has come and gone, and while the league's decision-makers have since shifted to identifying which complementary players might be had on the developing buyout market, let's instead take some time to examine the impact moves made before Thursday's embargo became official.\n\nDon't Edit\n\nSixers acquire Tobias Harris, Boban Marjanovic, Mike Scott | Clippers get Landry Shamet, Wilson Chandler, Mike Muscala, 2020 first-round pick, 2021 first-round pick (via Miami), 2021 second-round pick, 2023 second-round pick\n\nPhiladelphia grade: B\n\nOn the surface this deal looks as if it should be graded higher, however the risk associated with picking up three unrestricted free agents - especially one presumed to be a long-term member of the starting five - is what hurts GM Elton Brand here. But I am a gamblin' man so I do respect taking this chance.\n\nTobias Harris is a stud and a clear upgrade over Chandler at the four, although he was the focal point of the Clippers. How will he adapt to an offense where he's no longer the top option?\n\nBoban and Scott provide good depth on a 76ers bench that sorely needed better output from its veterans. Time will tell if their presence proves just as important as Harris joining the starters.\n\nDon't Edit\n\nLos Angeles grade: A\n\nWhat? How did the Clippers make out on this deal when they got rid of their best player? Because I am someone who watched in agony as low-seeded (and low-talented) Sixers teams made the playoffs year after year only to exit in the first round. Kudos to the Clippers (currently the West's 8-seed) for dropping back and focusing on the future over some meaningless milestone.\n\nMuscala was moved to the Lakers, but he's been having a streaky year as a three-point specialist. Landry Shamet proved this year that he's got the more reliable hand already as a rookie, and he'll be a nice piece for the Clippers moving forward. (So will those draft picks.)\n\nDon't Edit\n\nAP Photo/Tony Gutierrez\n\nMavericks acquire Kristaps Porzingis, Tim Hardaway Jr., Trey Burke, Courtney Lee | Knicks get Dennis Smith Jr., DeAndre Jordan, Wesley Matthews, two first-round picks.\n\nDallas grade: B\n\n15 years after letting soon-to-be Hall of Fame guard Steve Nash walk in free agency, Mavs owner Mark Cuban traded for his chance at a do-over with a young duo by aligning sensational rookie playmaker Luka Doncic (still just 19!) with Porzingis, the fourth pick by the Knicks in the 2015 pick.\n\nFolks a little higher on Porzingis would perhaps give Dallas an 'A' but I have serious concerns about the 23-year-old's durability. He's exactly the injury-riddled talent that Sixers fans feared Joel Embiid could become earlier in his career.\n\nTim Hardaway Jr. is owed a good chunk of change ($37 million over the next two seasons) but was averaging a career-high in points with New York this season (19.1 PPG shooting 38 percent from the field).\n\nDon't Edit\n\nNew York grade: C\n\nThe Knicks drafted Porzingis to be its franchise cornerstone for years to come. Pulling the plug after parts of three seasons to roll the lottery dice all over again is a defeat. The Latvian has talent, but clearly New York doesn't believe he's worth leaning on given his injury history.\n\nMatthews is a steady role player, so of course he was bought out on Thursday and signed with Indiana.\n\nThis deal does help the Knicks in that they added a young prospect in Smith and most importantly salary cap relief that will be more helpful in luring someone like Kevin Durant or Kyrie Irving this summer.\n\nDon't Edit\n\nDon't Edit\n\nAP Photo/Brandon Dil\n\nRaptors acquire Marc Gasol | Grizzlies get Jonas Valanciunas, Delon Wright, C.J. Miles, 2024 second-round pick\n\nToronto grade: A\n\nJust when it was looking like the Sixers were making strides to jump the Raptors (second in the East), in comes a player like Gasol to shore up Toronto's front court. A playoff battle between the three-time All-Star center and Embiid would be an epic match-up.\n\nValanciunas is a lot younger than Gasol, who can opt in for his age 35 season in 2019-20 for $25.6 million (yikes), but the onetime Defensive Player of the Year is still more valuable on the offensive end of the floor.\n\nHey, when Gasol opts in after Kawhi Leonard bolts in free agency, at least the Raptors will have another player to market alongside Kyle Lowry!\n\nDon't Edit\n\nMemphis grade: C\n\nThe Grizzlies shipped off their heart-and-soul in Gasol, but did at least hang onto Mike Conley for sentimental value.\n\nValanciunas can be immediately inserted into the starting lineup to keep rookie Jaren Jackson Jr. on a pace that doesn't put too much on the teen's plate too early.\n\nDelon Wright is a versatile guy that plays both guard positions and even made his way to small forward at times for Toronto. He's the most intriguing return for Memphis, who may reap the benefits of giving the 27-year-old additional responsibility.\n\nDon't Edit\n\nChris Graythen | Getty Images\n\nBucks acquire Nikola Mirotic | Pelicans get Jason Smith, Stanley Johnson, four second-round picks.\n\nMilwaukee grade: B\n\nThe Bucks missed this offseason by signing former Sixer Ersan Ilyasova, who is having a down year across the board. Mirotic takes his place as a stretch four who can shoot and use his vision to play with All-Star Giannis Antetkuonmpo.\n\nImprovements by teams atop the Eastern Conference standings made this move necessary for Milwaukee, who didn't give up much to bolster their offensive game.\n\nDon't Edit\n\nNew Orleans grade: B\n\nSmith is just a bench body and nothing more.\n\nJohnson, however, has some real defensive ability and is still just 22 years old. You're not going to get much scoring from the pair, but New Orleans is tearing it all down anyways so they might as well take a long look at a former No. 8 overall pick (selected by Detroit in 2015).\n\nDon't Edit\n\nTim Hawk | For NJ.com\n\nMagic acquire Markelle Fultz | Sixers get Jonathon Simmons, protected first-round pick and second-round pick.\n\nOrlando grade: C\n\nOn the plus side the Magic gave up nothing for Fultz, who could very well be finished in the NBA, although that's not likely. Markelle is an enigma for sure, but he'll most certainly give it another go in Orlando when he feels healthy enough to return to action.\n\nMaybe Fultz sits the rest of the year. The Magic have the luxury of holding the youngest player ever to record a triple-double under contract for two more years of evaluation, although that won't come cheap. Fultz is owed $22.0 million through 2020-21 should his team option be picked up during that last season.\n\nIf there is a perfect place for the 20-year-old to rebound, it's a market like Orlando.\n\nDon't Edit\n\nDon't Edit\n\nPhiladelphia grade: F\n\nO.K., the grade is really an 'A' because miracle-worker Elton Brand landed a potential first-round pick for the biggest draft bust in Sixers history, but it remains an 'F' because of the failure that this deal represents. (Thanks, Colangelo.)\n\nThe fan support for Fultz to succeed was always there, but man I don't know how he doesn't end up as one of the most loathed 76ers ever. Right up there with Andrew Bynum and his no-show season.\n\nFultz (7.7 PPG, 3.4 RPG, 3.4 APG in 33 games) wishes he had Shawn Bradley's stat line as a Sixer (9.7 PPG, 7.5 RPG, 1.1 APG in 143 games).\n\nDon't Edit\n\nNJ Advance Media\n\nWATCH: Who will win the Eastern Conference?\n\nDon't Edit\n\nJoe Trinacria covers the Sixers for NJ.com.
