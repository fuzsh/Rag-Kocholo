        "meta_description": "Michael Mann. Producer: Insider. As a director, screenwriter, and producer, four-time Academy Award nominee Michael Mann has established himself as one of the most innovative and influential filmmakers in American cinema. After writing and directing the Primetime Emmy Award-winning television movie The Jericho Mile (1979), Mann made his feature-film directorial debut with Thief (1981), followed by executive producing the television series Miami Vice (1984). He went on to direct Manhunter...",

        "text": "In 1985, sued William Friedkin for plagiarism, claiming that Friedkin stole the entire concept of Miami Vice (1984) when he made the movie Leben und sterben in L.A. (1985) (which, ironically, starred William Petersen, who later played Will Graham in Manhunter - Roter Drache (1986)). Mann lost the lawsuit. Despite this, the two directors are close friends nowadays. Friedkin even tease Mann in several interviews by saying \"Michael Mann is one of my favorite directors because he tries to make films like mine!\".\n\nDuring production of Manhunter - Roter Drache (1986), he wanted Francis Dollarhyde (Tom Noonan) to have a tattoo of William Blake's \"Red Dragon\" painting on his back, but ended up discarding the idea after deciding the tattoo trivialized Dollarhyde's inner struggles. In Roter Drache (2002), the second adaptation of Thomas Harris's novel, director Brett Ratner decided to include the tattoo and the subplot about Blake's painting \"The Great Red Dragon and the Woman Clothed with the Sun\" (ca.1803-1805).\n\n[on whether he operates the camera] The criterion is when I want to see what's going on through the lens. Usually, it comes down to performance more than technique . . . I've also worked with the same camera crews, even down to the assistants, on the last four films. So, we've developed a family in camera. A family that picks right up where they left off every few years. I see the world from the perspective of a 5'8\" person, not someone who is 6'4\". so naturally, I'm going to choose certain lens heights over and again . . . Sometimes nature makes choices for you. [1999]\n\nCould I have worked under a system where there were Draconian controls on my creativity, meaning budget, time, script choices, etc.? Definitely not. I would have fared poorly under the old studio system that guys like Howard Hawks did so well in. I cannot just make a film and walk away from it. I need that creative intimacy and, quite frankly, the control to execute my visions, on all my projects.\n\nI think it's easy for directors to stay fresh more than actors, especially once an actor becomes a star. It's hard for Russell Crowe to walk down a street or take a subway. I can fly coach."
