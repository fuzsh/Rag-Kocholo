        "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Speaking onstage at our Contenders London event over the weekend, Ferrari director Michael Mann confirmed that Heat 2 is set to be his next movie.\n\nAsked whether the novel adaptation would be his next screen epic, the legendary filmmaker told us: “Yes. Meg Gardiner and myself wrote the novel Heat 2, which came out right when we were shooting Ferrari. It did very well. I plan to shoot that next.”\n\nDeadline revealed earlier this year — pre-strikes — that Mann’s Ferrari lead Adam Driver was in talks to play the young Neil McCauley (the character played by Robert De Niro in the first movie) in Heat 2, which also had Warner Bros in talks to join.\n\nRELATED: Al Pacino’s Idea For His Successor In ‘Heat 2’? Timothée Chalamet\n\nWhen asked whether he could reteam with Driver on the movie, Mann laughed and told us: “Perhaps. We don’t talk about that yet. Let me put it this way: Adam and I got along like a house on fire [on Ferrari]. We have the same work ethic – which is pretty intense. We like each other, and we had a great time working together artistically.”\n\nRELATED: ‘Ferrari’ Teaser With Adam Driver Trades Dialogue For Revving Engines As Its Race Begins\n\nHeat 2 serves as both a prequel and a sequel to the first film. The story follows McCauley, Chris Shiherlis (originally played by Val Kilmer), and Vincent Hanna (originally Al Pacino) in the years leading up to the L.A.-set crime saga and chronicles what happens to the surviving characters in the years after.\n\nThe storyline takes readers back to Chicago in 1988 when McCauley, Shiherlis and their high-line crew are taking scores on the West Coast, the U.S.-Mexico border and in Chicago. At the same time, Hanna is cutting his teeth as a rising star in the Chicago Police Department chasing an ultraviolent gang of home invaders.\n\nAfter its publication in August, Heat 2 became a No. 1 New York Times bestseller.\n\nThe original 1995 movie, also made with Warner Bros, was a solid hit that has since become a revered crime classic with a global following.\n\nMann’s Ferrari, a passion project two decades in the making, launched at the Venice Film Festival and will get a Christmas Day theatrical release via Neon in the U.S. Driver stars with Penelope Cruz and Shailene Woodley in the story of Enzo Ferrari’s obsession to win the Mille Miglia, a treacherous 1,000-mile race across Italy, and his complicated home life between two women."
