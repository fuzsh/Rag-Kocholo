        "text": "Michael Mann is making a sequel to his 1995 film Heat and is sharing an update on when he plans to begin production.\n\nIn a new interview, the filmmaker said he is working on writing the screenplay for the sequel based on his novel Heat 2.\n\nMann told the Los Angeles Times that he wants to begin shooting the film by the end of 2024 or the beginning of 2025. The director stopped short of talking about the cast set for Heat 2, telling the publication, “I can’t talk about that.”\n\nHeat is a crime film starring Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. The cast included Jon Voight, Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, Diana Venora, Amy Brenneman, Ashley Judd, Mykelti Williamson, Wes Studi and Ted Levine.\n\nMann wrote and directed the film, which follows the conflict between an LAPD detective (Pacino) and a career thief (De Niro).\n\nHeat 2 will be based on the novel of the same name and function as a prequel and a sequel to Heat. The book jumps between two time periods, the first following Chris Shiherlis as he tries to evade the LAPD and Detective Vincent Hanna following the bank robbery gone bad with the second storyline taking place in Chicago in 1988.\n\nAdam Driver and Austin Butler are rumored to be taking over De Niro and Kilmer’s roles. Mann worked with Driver on his latest film, Ferrari, and was asked in October 2023 if he would reteam with him for the Heat sequel.\n\n“Perhaps. We don’t talk about that yet. Let me put it this way: Adam and I got along like a house on fire [on Ferrari],” Mann said. “We have the same work ethic – which is pretty intense. We like each other, and we had a great time working together artistically.”"
