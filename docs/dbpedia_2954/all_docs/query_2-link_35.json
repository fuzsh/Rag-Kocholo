        "text": "The media of the 21st century has advanced and expanded over the enhancement and technological advancement that has shift the social paradigm shift in how information, communication and even art has evolved through the evolution of digital technology. Within the realm of the cinema, the accessible and highly-advanced technology has allowed filmmakers to explore to higher and more complex methods of presenting their narrative, paving way for the age of the digital cinema.\n\nBut John Mateer asks that “but for all of this change, has the process of film making been fundamentally altered? Is this truly a new era in which the cinematographer has become more of a data-capture specialist than a visual artist?” (2014, p. 3).\n\nOne film-maker I’m sure who would disagree is Michael Mann. Ever since his experiment with the use of the Viper FilmStream High-Definition Camera on his film Collateral (2004), Mann has become a key proponent in the advancement and use of digital technology in cinema, with every one of his film being shot on the digital format since. Despite being one of the first, if not the first, to pushed for the need of digital technology in Hollywood, his use of the digital format have received criticism on his execution of it’s presentation. Two of his films, Miami Vice (2006) and Public Enemies (2009) received mixed reviews, partly over their use of the digital format that changes the way the film is perceived.\n\nMiami Vice (2006) is a film I found hard to watch, simply because the way light is exposed and the unbalance of light and shadows through a more prototype digital camera. The camera’s awkward movements andhigh-definition imagery ironically just doesn’t suit well with Mann’s intent on hyper-realism, which left me cold when watching this. While I agree with Chuck O’Leary assertion that the film “that reportedly cost $125 million by some accounts and $150 million by others, yet somehow looks worse than somebody’s bad home videos” (2006), I am however interested by Jean-Baptiste Thoret’s review, stating “Miami Vice makes up first of all a novel sensory experience and, from a formal point of view, an inspired synthesis of impressionism and hyper-realism… that Mann’s camera relentlessly pursues convey the feeling of a hallucinatory film” (2007).\n\nPublic Enemies (2009) was Mann’s fully integrated HD film, and I find a much more frustrating film to watch, simply because the High-definition quality just takes me out of the 1930s period environment. I mean, wouldn’t it be hard to try to be within the experience of Mann’s interpretation of the 1930s if I’m constantly aware that it looks like it was shot on a DSLR? That’s just my problem with the film. Manohla Dargis however wrote that “Michael Mann’s ‘Public Enemies’ is a grave and beautiful work of art. Shot in high-definition digital by a filmmaker who’s helping change the way movies look, it revisits with meticulous detail and convulsions of violence a short, frantic period in the life and bank-robbing times of John Dillinger” (2009).\n\nDespite the debate over the advancement and effects that digital cinema has had on films and the industry in genreal, Callum Marsh argues that the films of Michael Mann and others are “marks an important shift for Hollywood in the digital era for the way it actively engaged with the implications of a technological change most had simply taken for granted” to the point that “The advent of the digital was never regarded, at least by the mainstream media and the viewing public, as any kind of fundamental change to the way movies are made or seen” (2013).\n\nREFERENCES\n\nDargis, M 2009, ‘Seduction by Machine Gun’, The New York Times, 30 June, viewed 30 May 2016, http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/01/movies/01enemies.html?_r=0.\n\nMarsh, C 2013, ‘Blown Out: Calum Marsh on Miami Vice’, Reverse Shot, viewed 30 May 2016, http://reverseshot.org/archive/entry/552/miami_vice.\n\nMateer, J 2014, ‘Digital Cinematography: Evolution of Craft or Revolution in Production?’, Journal of Film and Video, vol. 66 no. 2, p.3.\n\nO’Leary, C 2006, Miami Vice, Fulvue Drive-in, online review, unknown, viewed 30 May 2016, http://www.fulvuedrive-in.com/review/4049/Miami+Vice+(2006/Theatrical+Film+Review).\n\nThoret, J-B 2007, ‘Gravity of the Flux: Michael Mann’s Miami Vice’, Senses of Cinema, issue 42, viewed 30 May 2016, http://sensesofcinema.com/2007/feature-articles/miami-vice/.\n\nFILMOGRAPHY.\n\nCollateral, 2004, DVD, Paramount Home Entertainment, Hollywood, California, directed by Michael Mann.\n\nMiami Vice, 2006, DVD, Universal Pictures Home Entertainment, Universal City, California, directed by Michael Mann.\n\nPublic Enemies, 2009, Blu-ray, Universal Pictures Home Entertainment, Universal City, California, directed by Michael Mann."
