These things include nearly everything that could be seen, heard, touched, tasted, met, or experienced. The material culture’s center is in the home and the workplace. All things in the home and at work are contained in the scope of this book. The church and the monastery had their things, as did the warriors. There are things in entertainment and the arts. Some people are counted as things, particularly if they were notable types throughout Europe who were defined by having a unique set of things. Two key events, the Crusades and the Black Death plague, are included because they shaped the material culture in dramatic ways and also had their own identifying things. The raw materials of the things are also included so that their nature and technology can be understood. Europe is defined as broadly as can be useful. It includes Scandinavia, Spain, Europe’s heartland of England, France, Germany, and Italy, and the Byzantine Empire that overlapped Europe and Asia. Information is not always available for all of these regions at all times, but where available, it has been included to give as broad a picture as possible. Europe’s Middle Ages span about 1,000 years, a time that transitions between antiquity and the modern world. Historians and authors have no exact dates for when the Middle Ages began and ended. It is the period between certain key events that clustered in the opening and closing centuries and seemed to mark a transition of culture and technology. This book uses roughly the years 550 and 1450 to define the Middle Ages.\n\nIntroduction The heartland of the Roman Empire, Italy, came under domination by the invading Goths at the end of the fifth century, and Roman rule shifted entirely to Constantine’s eastern capital, Constantinople. Around the same time, the first Merovingian kings ruled the Franks; King Clovis I died in 511. Benedict of Nursia founded monasteries and wrote his Rule of Saint Benedict not long after 500. Around 550, the last Roman outposts in Britain fell to invading Anglo-Saxons. The Plague of Justinian carried off about one-third of Constantinople’s (and Egypt’s) population around 550. In Mecca, Mohammed saw visions and founded a new religion around 600. These events define the effective beginning of Europe’s Middle Ages, although the early years are often called, informally, the Dark Ages. Rome no longer towered over Europe with superior technology and culture and a strong government and army. The Goths in Italy, the Anglo-Saxons in England, the Franks in France and Germany, and the Visigoths in Spain were all relatively primitive and uncivilized compared to Rome and Constantinople. Europe’s Middle Ages are the time when these Germanic tribes grew up, developing government, culture, and technology to match and surpass Rome’s. At the same time, the birth and growth of Islam also defined medieval Europe. Muslims were an aggressive force always pushing at Europe’s borders. Defensive and aggressive action against Muslim armies was the heart of medieval warfare. The Muslim Caliphate, which spanned the southern shore of the Mediterranean Sea, was also a conduit for technology and products from far away. Gems, silk, spices, and ideas came from India and Persia through the Muslim Empire that united the Far East with Egypt and Spain. European culture imported products from Muslim traders while pushing back Muslim armies. The most famous events in the Middle Ages were the Crusades, waves of defensive/aggressive war to take back territory from Islam. It was the age of the knight and his castle. Crusaders learned new construction methods and began building the classic castles of medieval Europe. Minstrels learned musical instruments from the East and sang “The Song of Roland” at tournament feasts. Spices from the East dressed meat, fish, and fruit in castle kitchens. The Byzantine story of Saint George and the dragon and travelers’ stories populated Europe’s imagination with knights, dragons, unicorns, lions, and sea monsters. The medieval period in Europe was also the time when Latin dominated government, education, and literature. It was still the native language of Rome in 500, but Greek was already the native tongue in Constantinople. Latin was soon nobody’s native language but everybody’s common channel of communication. The Middle Ages were the time of Latin book production, Latin schooling, and Latin liturgy in the church. Lectures at the new universities of Bologna, Paris, and Oxford were taught in Latin.\n\nviii\n\nIntroduction It was the age of monasteries and the high-water mark of the Roman Catholic Church’s influence. The Rule of Saint Benedict spread all over Europe. Both monasteries and convents dotted all regions thickly; they owned much of the land. Monks hand copied books and painted fanciful scenes and animals in the margins. Pilgrims venerated relics and donated to saints’ shrines, and enormous cathedrals rose at these sites. Monastic choirs sang Latin plainchant under stone vaults and stained glass windows. The governing system of medieval Europe was the Franks’ feudalism. Designed as a way to create mini-kingdoms to support armed knights, feudalism assigned all land to men loyal to the king. Everyone who lived on the land was assigned to support these nobles with their labor, keeping only enough of their produce to live on. Towns began to grow, and peasants moved to the towns, but they needed to buy their freedom first, and towns had to be chartered by the king or count as free of feudal obligations. International commerce and technology grew within these free towns, but the countryside remained chained to feudalism. The end of the Middle Ages was when, within a century, all these trends came to an end. By 1350, the Black Death plague had wiped out at least one-third of Europe’s population, and feudalism stopped making sense not long after. By 1381, England’s peasants staged a revolt. Gunpowder was coming into use around the same time, during the Hundred Years’ War, and, by 1400, cannons were the key siege weapon. Armor and castles were quickly obsolete, and the arts of the knight became simply a rich man’s sport. Restlessness and disillusionment from plague, famine, and war brought out dissent within the church, and the early Reformation came in the form of Lollards and Hussites. Latin was no longer anyone’s native tongue, and reformers wanted the Bible to be in the vulgar languages, as secular books now were. Pilgrimages, monasteries, and relics lost influence, and many were destroyed in the 16th century. The modern world was being born. The key date for the end of the Middle Ages is 1453—the fall of Constantinople to an army of Muslim Turks. The early Middle Ages had seen the fall of Rome and the birth of Islam; the period closed with a Muslim army triumphant in the remaining Roman capital. Gunpowder had breached the invincible walls. Scholars, artisans, and priests fled Constantinople as Roman scholars, artisans, and priests had fled Rome. They brought the learning of Greece back to Europe, and Europe’s culture transitioned into the period we call the Renaissance.\n\nix\n\nList of Entries Agriculture Alphabet Animals Armor Arthur, King Astrolabe Babies Banks Barrels and Buckets Beekeeping Beggars Bells Beverages Books Bricks and Tiles Bridges Calendar Castles Cathedrals\n\nChurch Cities Climate Clocks Cloth Clothing Clothing Accessories Coal Coins Compass and Navigation Cosmetics Crusades Dance Drama Embroidery Eyeglasses Fairs Fasts\n\nList of Entries Feasts Fish and Fishing Food Forests Funerals Furniture Games Gardens Glass Gold and Silver Guilds Gunpowder Hair Hats Heraldry Holidays Hood, Robin Horses Hospitals Houses Hunting Hygiene Iron Jewelry Jews Kitchen Utensils Knights Latrines and Garbage Lead and Copper Libraries\n\nxii\n\nLights Locks and Keys Machines Magic Maps Medicine Mills Minstrels and Troubadours Monasteries Monsters Music Muslims Numbers Painting Parchment and Paper Pens and Ink Pilgrims Plague Poison Pottery Printing Prisons Records Relics Roads Roland, Song of Saints Salt Schools Sculpture Seals Servants and Slaves\n\nList of Entries Ships and Boats Shoes Sieges Spices and Sugar Stone and Masons Tapestry Taverns and Inns Tools Tournaments\n\nUniversities Wagons and Carts Water Weapons Weddings Weights and Measures Women Zoos\n\nxiii\n\nGuide to Related Topics Art\n\nBooks Embroidery Glass Gold and Silver Heraldry Jewelry Painting Sculpture Tapestry Buildings and Places\n\nCastles Cathedrals Cities Hospitals Houses Mills Monasteries Prisons Schools\n\nTaverns and Inns Universities Business and Finance\n\nBanks Coins Fairs Gold and Silver Guilds Numbers Records Seals Weights and Measures Clothing\n\nArmor Cloth Clothing Clothing Accessories Cosmetics Embroidery\n\nGuide to Related Topics Eyeglasses Hair Hats Jewelry Shoes Customs and Events\n\nCalendar Funerals Heraldry Holidays Hygiene Magic Tournaments Weddings Education\n\nAlphabet Books Libraries Schools Universities Entertainment\n\nAnimals Arthur, King Dance Drama Feasts Games Hood, Robin Hunting Minstrels and Troubadours Music Roland, Song of Zoos Food and Drink\n\nAgriculture Barrels and Buckets\n\nxvi\n\nBeverages Fasts Feasts Fish and Fishing Food Gardens Hunting Kitchen Utensils Poison Salt Spices and Sugar Taverns and Inns Water Government\n\nCastles Church Cities Fairs Guilds Jews Latrines and Garbage Muslims Prisons Weights and Measures The Household\n\nBarrels and Buckets Castles Cities Furniture Gardens Glass Houses Hygiene Kitchen Utensils Latrines and Garbage Lights\n\nGuide to Related Topics Pottery Tapestry Medicine\n\nFood Gardens Hospitals Magic Monasteries Plague Spices and Sugar Universities Natural Resources\n\nCoal Forests Gold and Silver Iron Lead and Copper Salt Stone and Masons Water People\n\nBabies Beggars Jews Knights Minstrels and Troubadours Muslims Pilgrims Saints Servants and Slaves Women Plants and Animals\n\nAgriculture Animals Beekeeping Fish and Fishing\n\nGardens Horses Hunting Monsters Poison Zoos Reading and Writing\n\nAlphabet Books Libraries Maps Numbers Parchment and Paper Pens and Ink Printing Records Schools Universities Religion\n\nBells Books Calendar Cathedrals Church Crusades Drama Fasts Feasts Funerals Holidays Hospitals Jews Magic Medicine Monasteries Music Muslims\n\nxvii\n\nGuide to Related Topics Pilgrims Relics Saints Science and Technology\n\nAgriculture Astrolabe Bridges Climate Clocks Compass and Navigation Eyeglasses Gunpowder Iron Locks and Keys Machines Maps Mills Numbers Printing Sieges Tools Weights and Measures Time\n\nAstrolabe Calendar Clocks Holidays Transportation\n\nAstrolabe Bridges Compass and Navigation Horses Maps Pilgrims Roads\n\nxviii\n\nShips and Boats Taverns and Inns Wagons and Carts Warfare\n\nArmor Castles Crusades Gunpowder Heraldry Knights Sieges Tournaments Weapons Work\n\nAgriculture Banks Barrels and Buckets Beekeeping Books Bricks and Tiles Cities Clocks Cloth Embroidery Fairs Fish and Fishing Gardens Glass Gold and Silver Guilds Heraldry Horses Hospitals Hunting Iron Jews Knights\n\nGuide to Related Topics Medicine Mills Minstrels and Troubadours Monasteries Painting Parchment and Paper Pottery Records Schools\n\nServants and Slaves Ships and Boats Stone and Masons Taverns and Inns Tools Universities Wagons and Carts Weights and Measures Women\n\nxix\n\nA\n\nAgriculture\n\nAgriculture Some time in the seventh or eighth centuries, Europe entered a period of climate warming. The Medieval Warm Period increased average temperatures by several degrees, which opened higher elevations for farming and spurred a long expansion in farm productivity. During the ninth century, Europeans began to use a new plow, the moldboard plow, and their farming methods shifted to include other new technologies. In most of Europe, farmland was owned by a lord or a monastery. The land was divided into several large fields. Peasants each held a certain strip of the field for their personal farming. The peasants cooperated with each other in plowing and harvesting but tended and profited from their own strips. They also owed free labor to the landowner, so they helped farm his strips as well. In the late Middle Ages, when the plague had badly reduced the peasant farming population, this system broke down, and landowners were forced to hire plowmen and harvesters.\n\nPlows Settlement in Northern Europe required some changes in technology. In the Mediterranean region, the soil was light and dry. It could be adequately plowed with a simple wooden scratch plow, which drew a stick through the surface, pulled by one ox. In Northern Europe, greater rainfall and clay content made the soil heavier. A shallow plow could not exploit the richer nutrients of the soil. In the sixth century, Slavs had developed the moldboard plow, a heavy wheeled plow that spread across Europe and revolutionized agriculture. The moldboard plow had three parts: the coulter that slashed into the ground, the plowshare that cut horizontally at the grass roots, and the moldboard that turned the cut slices of turf on their sides. Where the old plow had cut a rough line in the soil, the moldboard plow sliced the soil and flipped it over, opening a much deeper furrow. The plow was mounted on wheels, since it was too large for a man to hold up as it cut through the turf. The wheels acted as a fulcrum so the plowman could bear down on the plow’s handles or let up so the plow blade rose a little for easier handling. Its blades had to be made of iron, or at least shod with iron, to cut into the heavy soil and not be dulled by rocks. The moldboard plow was so heavy it needed to be pulled by four yoke of oxen in most soil. Because few peasants owned eight oxen, villages pooled their oxen together and worked each other’s field strips together. The number of oxen each owned may have determined his share of the plowed strips. This system, called open field farming, was dominant through the 12th century. The heavy plow also shaped the fields and their\n\n3\n\nAgriculture system of measurement. Fields were not square, like modern fields, because it was difficult to turn the plow. They were long and narrow, and after a team of peasants plowed them together, they sowed their own strips with their seed. The wheeled plow did not work in all kinds of soil. In places where the ground was too wet, the spoked wheels picked up dirt and became too heavy and caked to move well. Medieval plowmen also used foot plows and swing plows, which were similar to the original simple scratch plows. Foot plows had a board that lay on the surface of the earth and kept the blade from going too deep, while swing plows had only the blade for the plowman to control. Some medieval estates owned more than one kind of plow. Seeds were broadcast by hand, not planted in rows. The sower wore a bag of seed over his shoulder and walked along the field, broadcasting seed with his hands; even coverage was the goal. Medieval fields are always shown thickly planted. Different grains were often sown together, since they could\n\nA small wheeled plow, requiring only one yoke of oxen, works a spring field in late medieval Italy. Larger plows in northern Europe often required a team of up to eight oxen or horses and two men to work the heavy soil. (Giraudon/The Bridgeman Art Library)\n\n4\n\nAgriculture be used together. Wheat and rye grew together and were harvested and milled together. The harrow was invented after the heavy plow and was in use in England by the time of the Norman conquest. The plow cut deeply into the soil and turned it, but it left deep furrows and ridges. The harrow was a large wooden rake with iron teeth; a horse pulled it across the furrows, leveling them and burying the cast seeds. Even before horses were used to draw plows, they were used to pull the much lighter harrows. Harvesters used sickles to cut the seed heads off the grain, leaving the stalks standing. A second harvesting pass with larger scythes cut the straw. In the 13th century, harvesters began to use larger scythes to cut the stalks above the roots and separate grain from straw during threshing. The earlier method created better straw, so when wheat straw was a valuable thatching material, it was worth the trouble to harvest twice. The new plowing methods may have doubled grain yield per acre. In general, a farmer could expect to get back four times as much grain as he sowed in seed. Medieval seed heads for wheat and barley were much smaller than those of modern grain hybrids, so the yield of seed was not great. Each seed had to grow enough other seeds that the peasant could save some for next year’s planting, give some to both church and manor in tithes and rent, and have enough to eat for the year. In bad years, families ate the seed they were saving for spring planting. Food production went up quickly with the use of the new plow. New land could be cleared because this plow could handle the heavy soil of lowlands near rivers. Europe’s population moved into these more fertile areas, which had been left wild. They also broke into new lands at higher elevations on mountain slopes. Medieval farmers also learned to enrich the soil more effectively. The value of manure had been known since Roman times. Allowing sheep to graze on a fallow field left it spread with manure as fertilizer, and, in the early Middle Ages, manure was a sheep’s most valuable product. Not only animal manure, but also the stalks of some plants such as hay and lupines, were left to rot or plowed under the soil. In the late Middle Ages, the Cistercian monks, who developed many iron-smelting operations, learned to gather the phosphate slag from their process to use as fertilizer. Improved crop rotation was the next stage in the medieval agricultural revolution. Growing the same crop over and over in a field exhausts the soil, since each plant takes different nutrients and puts out different waste products. Since ancient times, farmers had known to allow a field to lie fallow in alternate years so weeds could replace what the soil had lost to grain. In the 9th and 10th centuries, European farmers began to farm their strips in a three-way rotation. When a strip was planted in oats or legumes in the\n\n5\n\nAgriculture spring, it could be harvested at summer’s end. It was then replanted in wheat and rye and later left fallow for a third season. By using fall and spring planting, farmers could get an extra crop out of the same strip. On average, it may have added up to as much as 50 percent more food. The soil, refreshed by nitrates from the legumes, grew more grain. When rotation included oats, this high-protein grain allowed horses to be kept through the winter and worked harder. Around the same time, the invention of the horse collar increased the horse’s ability to pull heavy loads. The plow could be drawn by eight oxen or six horses, and sometimes with mixed teams of both. In a pinch, four horses or fewer could draw the plow. By the 14th century, many farms were switching over to all-horse teams. Horses increasingly used in farm work were also available for riding, and even peasants became more mobile, allowing for better access to markets and imported food. As horses replaced oxen, some small hamlets were abandoned, since the farmers could ride to their fields and keep their family homes in a larger town. Horses could also pull carts faster and farther than oxen. By the 13th century, horse transport lowered the price of food in towns and the price of manufactured goods in rural places. Even with all these farming improvements, crops frequently failed. Too much rain was the worst cause; widespread famines year after year in the early years of the 14th century were caused by torrential, continual rains that did not permit the crops enough sunshine to grow. Another danger was a poisonous fungus, ergot, which grew on rye. Ergot was more prevalent in damp times, so the early 14th century was also a time of danger from ergotism. Since even high temperatures did not kill ergot, it was still active in rye bread. It contained many poisons, including the substance we know as LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide). A peasant with ergotism had abdominal pain, skin inflammation, and delirium. In some cases, it progressed to gangrene and death. The Arab conquest of Spain brought another hazard. Arabs imported the barberry bush, which is host to a black stem rust virus that can devastate wheat fields. Mediterranean farmers did not know that the barberry bush, whose red berries were edible and medicinal, carried the rot. Famines followed these failures of the wheat harvest.\n\nIrrigation In the early Middle Ages, wetlands were wet and central plains were dry. By the 15th century, wetlands had been drained or crossed by causeways, small islands had been built into habitable dry land, and plains were irrigated. Flood and drought had not been such serious issues before that time; the Nile Valley routinely flooded, so nobody built houses in the floodplain.\n\n6\n\nAgriculture After cities built down to shorelines and drained marshes, floods became disasters. Droughts were very serious in places that could not support farming with their normal rainfall. Italy inherited Rome’s network of dams, canals, and ditches and, after a period of disorganization, were maintaining many of them by the ninth century. Ditches can serve for both drainage and irrigation, but rivers were usually at lower levels than the land, and early medieval Italy had not yet installed water wheels or Archimedes’s screws to move water to a higher level. Muslim Spain used Middle Eastern methods of small-scale irrigation. Caliph Abd al-Rahman, in the middle of the eighth century, brought in irrigation technology as well as imported plants from Syria. They used waterwheel and bucket systems to lift water from a stream into irrigation canals. The waterwheels were not large and were often operated by animal or human muscle power. Valencia, in the central plain, was highly dependent on irrigation for its farming economy. There was a well-developed system of canals and water gates so farmers could regulate the canal’s depth and how much water their lands received. The community held a court to make rulings over water disputes; the judges were farmers elected to the court who made rulings quickly and orally. The Water Court of Valencia is the oldest continuous self-governing institution in Europe.\n\nFruits and vegetables from the Near East came to Spain with the Islamic conquest. Among these imported plants, pomegranate trees flourished in the hot southern climate of Granada. The imported plants soon became part of the native scenery; the coat of arms of Granada includes a pomegranate. The picture shows a ripe pomegranate carved in relief on stone.

Arabs brought to Spain a number of crops not before known in the peninsula, including rice, hard wheat, sugar, citrus fruits like oranges and lemons, pomegranates, bananas, spinach, artichokes, and watermelon. They also introduced cotton. An Arab emissary to Constantinople managed to smuggle out a seedling of a fig plant, and figs became a major export crop from Muslim Spain.

See Beverages Alphabet The northern Germanic tribes used runes cut in stone to make memorials. The runic script may have been developed in the southern Alps, where Germanic-speaking people had some contact with the Etruscan alphabet. The Goths who settled in Italy did not use runes, but the northern Germans used them before they adopted Christianity and the Latin alphabet. The 24 letters were usually written left to right, but they could also run right to left or upside down. Runes were never used for writing long texts; they were used to write names and places, simple transactions of making and buying, and charms. Runes had religious meaning; in Norse legend, Odin invented them and used them for magic. In the Anglo-Saxon language, rune meant “secret.” Each symbol had both a word meaning and a sound, and it could be used to stand for either. Even after the adoption of Christianity and Latin letters, runes were still used for decorative purposes and magic. They continued to\n\n8\n\nAlphabet be part of folk culture in England; the Christian poet Cynewulf embedded runes in some of his poems as riddles and clues. The Latin alphabet became the dominant script of Europe. Medieval script styles in Latin were developed first in monastery scriptoria and later were practiced in a community of lay scribes who worked near universities and taught by writing masters. Through the centuries, the letters evolved into the two alphabets used today, the capital and lowercase forms. Roman script had written Latin in all capital letters, all the same size. Text written all the same size, like modern ALL CAPITALS, is called majuscule writing. The early Christian church adapted a form of this majuscule Latin script for its texts. The form in use at the opening of the Middle Ages, around the sixth century, was based on the Roman capital letters but wrote some of them larger or in a more exaggerated way. This way, scribes began to develop a system of capital and lowercase letters, a style of writing now known as uncial. Uncial letters were more rounded than the Roman style, as they were influenced by Greek. They were designed for pen and ink and had serifs—little decorative pen marks at the ends of lines. Scribes also began to create punctuation, which was unknown to Latin. Points and slanted lines began to indicate pauses and stops. The S-shaped question mark and a small dash to indicate quotation from a source also came into use in early forms. A very formal uncial script now called artificial uncial came to England with the first missionaries and became the script of Anglo-Saxon monks. However, as scribes in Rome produced more manuscripts, the style changed again to include ascending and descending strokes that made the letters different sizes. A script that uses different sizes of letters is called minuscule. The seventh-century style is now known as half-uncial because the letters were first used to make small notes in book margins. The style was easier and faster to write. Half-uncial developed lowercase letters such as b, d, and e out of the short-cut cursive forms scribes had been using. Early cursive tied letters together with ligatures as the scribe’s pen dragged between letters. Scribes developed certain letter combinations that were always tied with ligatures, a practice still used today ( ff and tt are connected with ligatures in many fonts). The monks of Ireland had been converted to Christianity during Roman times, and they continued to use a distinctive script that rounded the Latin letters. It is generally called insular majuscule because it was isolated on an island and the letters were all one size. Insular majuscule is familiar to modern eyes as the writing in famous works such as the Book of Kells. The letters were round, decorative, and frequently elongated or tied together with ligatures. The Irish monks also developed a minuscule script with lowercase letters. Insular minuscule had descending strokes in letters like g and q. Both these Irish scripts came to England, influenced Anglo-Saxon manuscripts, and then were copied in other European monasteries.\n\n9\n\nThe Luttrell family’s psalter, one of the best-preserved illustrated manuscripts, uses the 15th-century Gothic script. It was a minuscule script, although letters that started lines or sentences were often large and decorated. The lower loop of a G was closed, not open, in the Gothic; R was drawn in an abbreviated form; S was a straight line within a word, but at a word’s end it appeared as an angled curve similar to a modern S. Some Gothic scribes meticulously drew three-pointed feet on the bottom of their letters, while others were content with simpler serifs. (The British Library/StockphotoPro)\n\nInsular majuscule writing in the Book of Kells is made up of letters that resemble modern capital letters. This style, developed in Ireland, was beautiful but still easy to read. Here, many capital letters are decorated as animals. (The Print Collector/StockphotoPro)\n\nAlphabet By the eighth century, court scribes often chose to write scripts that were very difficult to read. If they were hard to read, they were also hard to forge, and it meant another scribe must be asked to read the document. Because they often wrote royal charters, the term “charter script” means this intentionally dense, complicated writing. They used exaggerated ascending and descending strokes and crowded the letters together. Merovingian royal documents are very difficult for modern scholars to read, and there is evidence that contemporaries, including the kings and Popes themselves, could not decipher them. A new approach called for a new script. King Charlemagne set up schools and a scriptorium to try to copy as many texts as possible and build up literacy and libraries. He set an example by becoming the first pupil in his school, along with his sons. To build up general literacy and generate new books as quickly as possible, he needed a simple script that was easy to read and write. His English adviser, Alcuin, wrote in insular minuscule, but other styles met in the land of the Franks. A script from the monastery at Luxeuil featured exaggerated ascending and descending strokes, while scripts from Italy were more similar to the original Roman style. Alcuin and his scribes could choose from a variety of known styles. Charlemagne’s scriptorium developed a standardized minuscule style now known as Carolingian minuscule. It used moderate, conservative ascending and descending strokes so lines could be written closer together to fit more on a page, and its letters were rounded and uniform. It used capital letters and periods to set off sentences. Words had small spaces between them to make reading easier, although close word spacing continued to be an issue until the late Middle Ages. A lowercase N in the modern form n evolved, as did the earliest step toward a modern W, as overlapping U and V. Because Carolingian scribes copied a very large number of old texts that were falling apart, their script became universal and dominant. They also used some of the older scripts from the material they were copying in order to set off headings and first letters. During the 11th century, a new script, now called Gothic, came into use. Gothic letters were narrower, in order to fit more letters on a page of parchment. They were written quickly, and the style included serifs—lines left as the pens were lifted at an angle. Ideally, the appearance of every letter was, at first, highly uniform, and to modern eyes the letters blur into a series of lines. Gothic letters were often connected by ligatures or ended with a flourish, and individual scribes, particularly in Northern Europe, sometimes made their Gothic letters so decorative that we have difficulty reading them. Some Gothic scripts used large, colored designs for capital letters called versals. Versals were often irregular or alternative shapes for the letters, and they were often set off in decorative boxes.\n\n12\n\nAlphabet The Gothic script continued to be dominant through the 15th century, and since the architectural and artistic style was ornate, scribes wrote in increasingly ornate hands. Ascending strokes were tall, looped, curled, broken, and dotted. Descending strokes also curled and looped, and letters became slanted, rounded, and irregular. National script trends developed; letters tended to be tall and narrow in Northern Europe and rounded in the Mediterranean. Writing in Germany tended toward heavy strokes and elaborate capital letters. Paleographers call the uniquely ornate style that came out of 14th-century Germany “Gothic Littera Bastarda.” Every hand in this style was different, although the letters had the same essential formation. Pages of ornate Gothic writing were as beautiful as stone tracery in a Gothic cathedral. By the late Middle Ages, scribes in the more conservative Mediterranean regions were turning back to forms of Carolingian minuscule. Gothic letters had become too ornate and difficult to read. Carolingian minuscule became the basis for styles in the Renaissance and the new technology of typeface. The Latin alphabet was not the only one in common use in medieval Europe. Jews continued to read and write in Hebrew, and the Muslims of Spain and Sicily used Arabic. Arabic was often written with elaborate, artistic calligraphy, and it influenced styles in art. Arabic writing was often painted onto ceramic dishes and woven into silk. Arabic was also the daily language of half the Mediterranean and most of Spain. Even Christians and Jews in Spain spoke Arabic and wrote Arabic treatises and poetry. Arabic was a more beautiful, civilized alphabet in contrast with the crude block letters of Latin. Hebrew was influenced by Arabic to become more elaborate and decorative in the Muslim countries where Jews absorbed Arabic culture. In Northern Europe, Hebrew script was influenced by Latin and by the need to use it as a business correspondence language. During the Middle Ages, Jews in France and Germany developed faster, simpler ways to write the ancient Hebrew letters. Their shortcuts are now known as cursive, although the letters are not connected by ligatures as in a true cursive. Whereas the formal Hebrew script required calligraphy, medieval Hebrew cursive could be written quickly with lines. The cursive used in Israel today is very similar to medieval German Jewish cursive.

Beast, originally a French word for a wild animal, came to mean any nonhuman living thing and encompassed both domestic and wild animals by the end of the period. The distinction between wild and domesticated animals was not as clear in the Middle Ages as it is now. Even today, some dogs can be wild, pets, or working animals; at that time, many other animals could be any of these categories. Medieval philosophers and common people were convinced that animals felt emotion and could think to some extent. Certain animals were thought to exemplify emotional or moral traits: dogs love their masters, apes are lunatics, camels are filled with lust, and lions do not hate men unless they are wounded. Although they did not consider man an animal, they lived in harmony with animals, surrounded by them at all times, down to the fleas on their bodies.\n\nBooks about Animals There were many books about animals in the Middle Ages. The most common type had encyclopedia-style entries and was called a bestiary. The most influential was known as the Physiologus, after its anonymous author. This bestiary, emerging from classical times in Greek, was translated into every known language. The original had about 50 beasts; as it was translated and copied, anonymous authors added local animals as well as more hearsay. Artists added illustrations that were very inaccurate for unknown animals but quaintly accurate enough for native beasts. Bestiaries began as guides to the animals of the Bible, many of which were unfamiliar to Europeans. The lion was not native to Europe, and its habits had to be explained. In later bestiaries, familiar European animals such as wolves and sheep were explained in moral terms, in addition to the exotic animals. Animals were described as morally good or bad. Wolves were the epitome of evil, and the habits of wolves could help a medieval reader\n\n14\n\nAnimals understand the habits of the devil. A wolf’s eyes shine in the dark like a lamp because the devil’s works seem beautiful. Wolves, the reader learns, cannot turn their heads to look backward, but must turn their whole body, which means the devil cannot turn and repent. Because bestiaries began as natural history companions to the Bible, they tried to provide sermon illustrations to teach moral lessons. Bestiaries classified animals into beasts, birds, reptiles, and fishes. Reptiles and fish were grouped together in a primitive recognition of their coldblooded nature. Bats were birds, but the bestiary noted that bats were the only birds that had teeth and gave birth to live young. Satyrs, mythical humanoids, were beasts. Ants were beasts, since they were not birds or fish, but worms of all kinds were classed with the snakes, with fleas added for completeness. Whales and dolphins were fish, and frogs were also grouped with fish. In some cases, an animal was clearly considered to be fish, bird, or beast, but in other cases, it may only have been a convenience of grouping. The Middle Ages did not seem to consider insects as their own class. Rumored animals from far away also appeared in bestiaries; some are reasonably identifiable or even accurate (the hyena and the ostrich), but most\n\nIn a 13th-century bestiary, the wolf’s image was more important as a symbol of evil and danger than as an accurate drawing of the real animal. (The British Library/ The Bridgeman Art Library)\n\n15\n\nAnimals are fictitious monsters (the griffin and the unicorn). The manticora, the medieval reader learned, was a man-eating beast with a lion’s body and a man’s face. The unicorn was the size of a goat, was both swift and fierce, and could only be captured by a young virgin. The phoenix, dying on its funeral pyre to come to life again, was reported as factually as any other animal. Some bestiaries tried to be careful, and one 12th-century work explained to the reader that the many-headed hydra dragon was a myth. Bestiaries passed on the accumulated scientific knowledge of animals, often from Roman sources like Pliny the Elder. The information was more often inaccurate than accurate. For example, a 12th-century reader learned from one bestiary that the livers of mice are enlarged at the full moon, that weasels give birth through their ears or mouths, that rams butt heads because it helps the itching in their brains caused by worms, and that elephants live 300 years. Some accurate information could be found in a bestiary, especially concerning animals native to Europe. The stag’s rutting season was accurately described, as well as the deer’s habit of giving birth in a hidden place. Bestiary writers observed that deer moved upwind to mask their scent, migrated from pasture to pasture, and crossed rivers in a line. Even in relatively accurate information, inaccuracy and folklore intruded. Stags eat snakes to cure their sicknesses, said the writer, so if you want to keep snakes away, use the ashes of a burned stag’s horn. Writers of the later Middle Ages tried to improve the accuracy of these sources. The Dominican monk Albertus Magnus, writing in the 13th century, composed De Animalibus, a many-volume encyclopedia of animals based on the ideas of Aristotle, with several original volumes from his own observational knowledge. His motivation for writing was still to educate preachers and other writers about animals they might not have seen and to apply the animals’ traits to moral teachings. However, unlike previous copiers and annotators of bestiaries, Albertus Magnus tested the unquestioned knowledge of the ancients by experimenting. He verified that moles did not have eyes but found that neither did they have black oil for eyes, as Aristotle had said. His concern was to make an accurate book as much as a complete book. Veterinary information was nonexistent at first, and animals had no medical care. But as the wealthy began to have highly bred, well-trained animals, they wanted to know how to treat their disorders. Medical philosophy offered the same framework to animal medicine as to human medicine. All living things were made up of hot and cool, wet and dry. The creature’s overall complexion was the way these four humors were balanced. Bees were cold and dry, while horses were hot and dry. Fish, obviously, were cool and wet. This system was very consistent and passed as scientific, but it could recommend few practical therapies for colic, sprains, worms, or injuries.\n\n16\n\nAnimals The falconers or horse trainers of kings sometimes wrote books. Emperor Frederick II of Germany himself wrote a treatise on the care of falcons, taking a scientific approach. His Master of Stables wrote a similar work on the care of horses that examined their common ailments and discussed how best to manage them. Veterinary medicine may have moved beyond Aristotle more quickly than human medicine, abandoning the four humors theory in favor of pragmatic therapies.\n\nDomesticated Animals Domesticated animals of the Middle Ages were the same kinds we still have on our farms and in our homes, although the animal breeds were somewhat different. A domesticated animal is entirely dependent on its owners for food, but a wild animal forages on its own. Some medieval farm animals were not fully domesticated and lived half wild. Pigs, horses, and even cows were sometimes kept half wild and lived on their own in forests. When animals were free to forage for themselves, they often bred with wild species, such as the wild boar. Half-wild animals were often smaller, since they could not be selectively bred like farm animals. Although the Romans had practiced selective breeding to produce larger farm animals, the Middle Ages saw a reversal of this trend, and animals became on average smaller. Medieval pigs were only about one-third the size of a modern pig. Cows were smaller and leaner. Foraging also meant the animals did not get as much to eat as barn-fed animals. Farm animals tended to be kept longer than modern animals. Because they were smaller and leaner, they did not reach a useful size quickly. Pigs were the chief animal raised for food in medieval Europe. They were smaller than modern pigs, but with longer legs. Like the wild boar, they had long faces with pointed snouts, were dark brown, and had very stiff, bristly hair. Unlike cattle and sheep, pigs did no useful work when they were alive, but they had the advantage of eating nearly everything. Pigs could be released to forage on acorns and beechnuts in the forest, or they could wander a town’s streets, eating garbage and the waste grain from breweries. In cities, they were considered a serious nuisance. Not only were they voracious, but occasionally they killed a small child who also had been left to wander the streets. Many medieval towns tried to ban or restrict pigs, but they were too important to the medieval diet for the effort to be successful. Pork was easy to preserve, since it was still fairly good after being salted, smoked, or dried. Its fat was good for cooking. Pigs became less important in the food economy of the late Middle Ages because forests were being cut for charcoal to make iron, which reduced acorn foraging.\n\n17\n\nAnimals Cattle and sheep were more numerous than pigs after that time. However, the pigs that remained were more often kept in pigsties in the farmyard. These pigs grew larger and fatter and, over time, grew lighter in color and less like wild pigs. Poultry were the most common animal kept by the poor, even in cities. In Anglo-Saxon times, England had more chickens than geese, but geese became the primary poultry of the later Middle Ages. Many manors also kept doves as producers of manure. The primary value of poultry was in egg production. Chickens and geese were only eaten for special occasions, since their eggs had more food value than their meat. A hen could lay on average one egg every two days, and some peasants paid rent in eggs. Sheep were among the most prized farm animals, and they were the most numerous in some regions. Medieval sheep were smaller than modern sheep. They could find grass on land that was not rich enough for wheat fields, including at elevations where crops could not grow. They were milked, and farmers made sheep cheeses and butter. Sheep’s milk was originally more commonly used than cow’s milk. They dropped manure on fields that could later be plowed and planted, and, for this reason, their folds were moved frequently, even daily. Their wool, particularly as longhaired sheep were bred, was highly valuable, and wool was the primary export of England. Once slaughtered, their meat was mutton and their skin became parchment for books. During the 14th century, sheep herds greatly increased. Cloth production made their wool more important than their milk, and shepherds focused on lambing rather than milking. Sheep were also kept longer before slaughter, since they produced wool long past their milking usefulness. By the 12th century, some monasteries and manors were beginning selective breeding to produce better wool, and, by the 14th century, these new breeds had finer wool. Sheep bred by Cistercian lay brothers were the best. In 13th-century Spain, sheep breeders created the Merino sheep with the softest wool. Spanish shepherds had to move their sheep from summer to winter pastures, sometimes over long distances. Late medieval Spain was honeycombed with sheep trails, which were maintained by the mestas, the sheep owners’ regional organizations. The level of organization required to maintain the trails and rules also permitted organized breeding, overseen by the mestas. The new breed they developed was perfect for their conditions. The Merino sheep could walk long distances and it could get by on only scruffy grazing in a hot, dry climate. It produced large amounts of very fine wool. Cattle were primarily draft animals and only shifted to dairy and meat animals as the horse became the main draft animal. There may have been more cattle than sheep in early medieval England. They were smaller than\n\n18\n\nAnimals modern cattle and had longer horns. A castrated male was called an ox and was the main plowing animal for most of the Middle Ages, until the 13th-century shift to growing oats made it easier to keep horses. Oxen typically plowed in teams of eight, where possible. They could be eaten when they wore out their strength in work; their other parts produced glue, leather, parchment, and fat for soap. Horses could plow faster, but the church did not allow people to eat them. Until the murrain outbreaks of the 14th century, cattle had fewer diseases than horses, and they did not need shoes. During the 13th century’s agricultural shift to three-field crop rotation and draft horses, cattle became more important as dairy cows. Males were still castrated as oxen if not needed as bulls, but barn and field resources shifted to maintaining as many females as possible for milk. Once cattle became more valuable for their milk, they were given more food and began to grow larger. Goats and sheep were the most common farm animals in Mediterranean countries. Goats were never well established in the north, although they were kept in some places. By the 13th century, English farms rarely kept goats. In Alpine regions, goats and sheep had to be moved to winter or summer pastures for the most efficient use of scanty pasturage. Wild hares were native to Europe, but the smaller, fatter domesticated rabbit was an invader during the Middle Ages. Monasteries kept rabbits, since baby rabbits were declared fish by the church and could be eaten on fast days. As monasteries made progress in raising rabbits on their farms, aristocrats introduced them back into the wild in new areas so they would reproduce for sport hunting. The rabbit came to England in 1176, and, at the same time, aristocrats introduced partridges, pheasants, peafowl, and fallow deer. Domestic and wild rabbits interbred, and rabbits easily went wild if they escaped. Although they were rare during most of the Middle Ages, by the Renaissance rabbits were a common nuisance and had displaced the native hare. Manure from all domesticated animals was an important agricultural product that had high market value. Manure’s value as fertilizer was wellknown. The landowner often claimed not only the dung of his own estates and fields, but also the swept-up droppings on the town streets, which poorer people would have been glad to salvage. Street droppings swept up in London were sold to country farms. Peasants could not develop their fields as well, since they had fewer animals.\n\nPets Rabbits were not only wild or farm animals. Like people today, medieval people noticed that rabbits made good pets. They were easy to feed\n\n19\n\nAnimals and did not take up much space. Anyone with a fondness for animals and enough money to produce a little spare food might keep a rabbit or squirrel. Manuscript pictures show ladies with squirrels in collars that are clearly tame pets. Birds were also popular small pets. Today’s pet birds are usually exotic birds from the Orient, but in the Middle Ages, the only exotic bird known was the parrot, called a popinjay. It was extremely expensive and very rare. Native birds could be tamed, most commonly jays, jackdaws, and magpies. Jackdaws and magpies could be trained to imitate speech. The queens of England kept cages of small birds such as nightingales, and a few had African parrots—gifts sent by foreign royalty. North African monkeys were imported to Europe and were popular aristocratic pets. While a monkey would be beyond the means of a university student, who might rather keep a rabbit or bird, some ladies kept monkeys. Monkeys could be bought at large fairs, and traveling minstrels used trained monkeys in their shows. Dogs were part of European civilization from the start, first as hunting dogs. Most knights kept hunting dogs at their manors. By the Middle Ages, there were many different breeds. Hunting required different sizes and skills in dogs: greyhounds and alaunts could catch up to running deer and pull them down, mid-sized running hounds tracked and chased the quarry, and bloodhounds tracked and killed downed animals. Mastiffs and similar dogs were used for guarding flocks. Hunting dogs were not exactly pets, since they lived in kennels, but some favorite hunting dogs were permitted to come into the castle hall and eat scraps. Dogs are described in bestiaries in terms similar to the modern phrase “man’s best friend”: dogs had been known to help solve crimes or to leap onto the funeral pyre of a dead master. Ladies had lap dogs, and, in the less disciplined convents, nuns kept dogs as pets. The dogs ate table food that might have been given to the poor or used by the nuns themselves, so the church tried to discourage the habit. Even worse, in some places, nuns brought their pets to chapel, where they distracted everyone from the service. Aristocratic ladies kept dogs without any fear of ecclesiastical rebuke; a pet dog was a socially approved sign of wealth. Pet dogs are pictured in manuscript illuminations in different shapes and sizes; some look like small spaniels, a later popular pet of the aristocracy. Cats were not part of early medieval Europe but became popular luxury pets in the late Middle Ages. They rate scantier mention in the bestiaries than mice. They first entered Europe’s economy as small predators similar to ferrets, probably brought from the East on ships. Their bones are found in French towns from the 10th century, but they appear to be small and feral. As the rat population grew in towns, cats were useful town animals\n\n20\n\nAnimals to keep them in check. Many churches and businesses kept cats around for that purpose, but these were usually feral cats. Common people must often have tamed them, but they were considered low animals and were always associated with witchcraft by the church. Feral town cats might be killed for their fur, which could be passed off as fox fur if the seller were lucky. Even as cat fur, it had value. In the late Middle Ages, though, travelers began importing exotic breeds, such as the Persian cat, from the East. Exotic cats joined lap dogs as pets for aristocratic ladies, and paintings from the late medieval years show cats in settings with people.\n\nWild Animals While some animals were wild but became domesticated, others were always wild. These included predatory animals like wolves, foxes, and bears and grazing deer hunted for their meat. They also included many small animals that still live at the margins of human society. The most feared animal was the wolf. In the 7th and 8th centuries, much of Europe was covered with deep forest, and human settlements were isolated or coastal. By the 14th century, the forests were nearly gone, except for fringes on mountain slopes. Wolves withdrew to these ranges, and, where possible, they were hunted to extinction. While modern man has a sense that wolves are needed to keep the natural world balanced, medieval man saw wolves as wholly wicked. The real wolf of the forest easily became the wicked wolf of the fairy tale, since man’s only contact with wolves was their fierce predation against his flocks. Medieval wolves were large enough to take down horses, cattle, sheep, and goats. In the forests, they hunted the same animals that hunters pursued. In outlying villages, older wolves sometimes killed small children. Wolves were not valuable animals to hunt. They carried rabies, and medieval people believed their bite was generally poisonous. Their fur could make good blankets, but it had a distinctive smell that had to be removed. Because they were evil, nobody ate them; however, for that same reason, some of their parts were thought to have magical or medicinal power. Bears were also hunted to extinction in medieval Europe, although there were always some in captivity. They may have originally been more common in Spain, where they were protected as royal hunting game. Bears were possible to tame, unlike wolves. Foxes were not tamed and were both less dangerous and more numerous than wolves. They were prized for their fur and were very popular hunting targets, as they are today. Deer were protected in royal forests in much of Europe, so they were kept from extinction by the efforts of professional foresters. The red, roe, and fallow deer were Europe’s native breeds. Fallow deer were native to the Mediterranean; they were the smallest kind. Red and roe deer were native\n\n21\n\nAnimals to the British islands. They continued to live wild, while fallow deer increased in numbers in protected forests and parks. All kinds of deer lived in the large royal forests. Deer browsed on meadow grass and tree leaves. The medieval practice of coppicing trees produced many young shoots suitable for deer to eat. In winter, deer in protected parks were often fed hay. Their rutting (mating) season was in the fall, and they gave birth to fawns in the spring. Professional hunters were careful to hunt bucks only in the summer and does only in the fall. Fierce wild boars, twice the size of domesticated pigs, roamed the forests and could easily kill both dogs and hunters. They were black and had very coarse, bristly hair. The wild sows were also fierce, but the boar had long, sharp tusks. Other wild animals abounded: otters, beavers, and muskrats in the lakes and streams; hares, badgers, and hedgehogs in the fields; and weasels and lynx in the forests. In the Alps and Pyrenees, there were ibex and chamois mountain goats.\n\nEntertainment with Animals In addition to the rare entertainment of a king’s parade of his private zoo—a menagerie of exotic animals—medieval townspeople enjoyed shows of more common animals. Animal fighting was a very popular spectacle for medieval peasants and townspeople. Animals could also be trained, in some cases. Trainers for dogs, horses, bears, and apes traveled to fairs and castles or stayed at a nobleman’s court. Bears and dogs could both learn to dance. Apes could learn to juggle, ride on dogs, or work simple machines like wheelbarrows. Bears also learned to pretend to fight with actors so the crowd could enjoy watching a wrestling match. Cockfighting began as a sport for boys in France, but it became an adult sport for betting. Medieval people believed that roosters were natural fighters, like knights, and that it was noble for them to fight each other. Cockfights were like tournaments for the poor. The watchers were used to the blood and injury and found fights very exciting. The most popular spectacle at a fair was bearbaiting. A bear, muzzled so it could not bite, was kept in an enclosure or tethered to a stake. Sometimes the bear was blind. Fighting dogs were sent to attack the bear, which could only use his paws to defend himself. People placed bets on how many dogs the bear could kill before it died. Bulls, too, were baited. In Spain, the tradition of bullfighting goes back to medieval times. Nobles fought bulls to prove their courage, and commoners fought bulls for cash prizes. In Northern Europe, bulls were baited like bears, with dogs set on them. Bulldogs were bred to have vice-like\n\n22\n\nAnimals\n\nThe men watching this bearbaiting have placed bets on how many dogs the bear can kill before it collapses or dies.

Schoolboys played a game of burying a chicken up to its neck and throwing rocks at it until it was dead. Some games made the normal slaughter of farm animals into gory play, such as mock jousting to decapitate a goose or a blindfolded game of beating a sow to death. A number of small wild animals, such as birds and frogs, also served as targets for rock throwing or mutilation.

New spear-based weapons made plate armor a necessity in war, and it took center stage in the fad for tournaments. Gunpowder then began the process of making plate armor obsolete. The height of plate armor craft came after the Middle Ages, during the early Renaissance, when it had become a ceremonial and athletic accessory. Real war technology had moved on. Even in the late Middle Ages, chainmail was still in use in real wars, and only a small percentage of fighters ever had a full suit of expensive plate armor. Any sort of armor was always a mark of status; low-ranked fighters had a quilted or leather tunic, at most. Leather could be hardened to be as tough as wood, and it never went completely out of use as primary armor. During the 14th century in Italy, some hardened leather armor was tooled and gilded and was used by those who could have afforded metal. It was cooler and easier to use for light combat. In most of Europe, though, the trend was always toward incorporating the largest amount of iron available at the time and for the user’s budget. The standard was chainmail, made of interlocked iron rings and called simply “mail.” Mail was deemed good enough until two new weapon developments early in the 14th century. In Flanders and Switzerland, in 1302 and 1315, peasants and townsmen used halberds and pikes to kill large numbers of well-armed knights. The sharp point of a spear could go through mail. And, in 1346, English longbows sent yard-long arrows through French knights’ armor at the Battle of Crécy. The French army had a squadron of Genoese crossbowmen, and their bolts, too, could pierce a mail hauberk. Plates were first attached to leather and then were bolted together in increasingly complete suits. Milan was the armor-making center of Europe during the Middle Ages. Although armor was made locally in all parts of Europe, the finest armor\n\n24\n\nArmor always came from Milan. When trends changed, they changed first in Milan. In the 1280s, the Milanese armorers began to reinforce mail with plates to block arrows at key points. By 1340, they viewed plate armor as their main product and supplementary mail as a secondary product. The wealthiest aristocrats and kings ordered armor from Milan. Milan-trained armorers were enticed to move elsewhere, bringing their knowledge. Milan sent armorers into other cities of Italy: Brescia, Rome, Venice, Modena, and Naples. Around 1400, Milanese craftsmen began moving to England and France and populated Milanese shops in Paris, Tours, Innsbruck, Bruges, and Artois. In Nuremberg and Augsburg, cities of southern Germany, armor-making increased in the middle of the 14th century. German armies were pushing back a Turkish invasion at the Hungarian border, and these cities supplied the armor. Germany also exported armor to Poland. Before its downfall as a craft in the 16th century, armor-making was big business in Europe. Merchant armorers worked with craftsmen to fill very large orders for kings who were preparing for war. A king might buy armor pieces for several thousand men in addition to his knights, who already had armor. Guild regulations prevented arms from being sold in large amounts on the open market so that craftsmen could retain control over their wares, but no single craftsman could fill these large orders. Determined merchants found ways around the guild rules or simply flouted them. Large multinational corporations with stockholders grew up in the arms trade. In the 14th and 15th centuries, kings, dukes, and earls spent a great deal on armor that would stand out from the rest of their knights. Sometimes the armor was ceremonial, and sometimes it was really intended for war. The armor had gold-plated decorations in visible places, like on the visor of a helm, or was engraved with fine decorations on the main plates. Some armor was even enameled black with gold designs or was embedded with jewels. These gold-decorated armor pieces cost as much as the annual income of the kingdom. Most of the luxury armor came in the period after the Middle Ages proper. In the Renaissance, luxury armor was a great prestige symbol, even though it was no longer useful in war.\n\nShields In the early Middle Ages, reinforced wooden shields were a key part of a warrior’s kit. They were usually round, in Northern European usage. Anglo-Saxon and early Frankish round shields probably had metal rims to protect the edges from splintering as easily. It seems likely that they were painted or decorated with metal. The shield found in the rich Sutton Hoo grave had silver rivets and other decorative metal touches, while the\n\n25\n\nArmor decorative shields from a boat burial in Norway were painted yellow and black directly on the wood. Shields were critical to Anglo-Saxon warfare. Foot soldiers formed a shield wall, and the strategy depended on not allowing the enemy to break through the wall. The Norse Vikings used round, flat wooden shields covered with leather, often painted. Their purpose was to ward off arrows and some blows, but they could easily be shattered with an ax, and some Vikings ran through more than one shield in a battle. The shields were about the size of a pizza—14 inches to 30 inches at the largest. They had a hole cut in the center large enough to fit a hand. A metal boss covered this hole; it had a handgrip bar at the back. It was nearly cone-shaped, with a point to deflect blows. Very few wooden shields have survived, but many shield bosses have been found in pagan graves. The Norman invasion in 1066 brought a new style of shield. The shields shown on the Bayeux Tapestry are large and kite-shaped, carried on the left arm. It is likely the kite shape was an adaptation to carrying the shield on horseback. From this time on, Norman knights carried shields for mounted warfare—usually some form of a triangle, narrower at the bottom where they might knock against the horse. During the Middle Ages, shield shapes changed as their purpose shifted. Shields were made of plywood, not iron. From round Norse shields to medieval jousting shields, they began with thin layers of wood glued together so the grain of each layer was at right angles to the grain of its neighbors. Most shields were bent into a curved shape so blows would slide off. The face of a shield was covered with leather and then often with gesso, a plaster glue used to prepare wooden surfaces for painting in fine art. The shield could then be painted. The back of the shield needed straps or handles. Norse shields had a handle bolted to the metal center boss as well as a strap for the elbow to help support the shield. Straps on the back of a shield are called enarmes. Medieval shields had leather straps riveted to the plywood to support the elbow and wrist. Some shields also had a third, small strap to hook fingers into when they were not being used. Additionally, most had a strap that could sling the shield around the neck or back when at rest. This strap was called the guige. The shield’s back was covered with fabric, either linen or something finer. A pad of horsehair often padded the area where the arm rested against the shield to protect it from being bruised by direct blows. At first, the new tactical method of cavalry charges with lances made knights carry larger, heavier shields during the 12th and 13th centuries. The shields were called targes and were covered with leather. Knights needed to take several shields, which were carried by their squires, into battle. However, this increased use of shields did not last. Shields were not used as an active part of a knight’s defenses after full plate armor came into use. Some\n\n26\n\nArmor armored knights still used small shields, but a wooden shield was not nearly as strong as the armor itself. Tournament shields still had a function since they helped support the lance. They were designed with a notch cut in one top corner to rest the lance while charging. Shields had a second life as less personal weapons in later warfare. In sieges, many kinds of wooden walls and shields were needed to protect those who were shooting or operating machinery. A tall, freestanding wooden shield, called a pavis, was supported by legs and could shelter two or more fighters. Archers usually fought behind pavises. These shields were not much more than large boards.\n\nHelmets Viking helmets, like the helmets used by the Franks and Anglo-Saxons, were close-fitting and made of metal or leather. They did not generally have horns, but they often had nose guards. Some had cheek plates and chinstraps; they were made of several metal plates, riveted together. The few helmets that survived in rich ship burials often have totem animals mounted on top, like a crest. On the Bayeux Tapestry, the fighters wear close-fitting round steel helmets with nose guards. They are fitted over chainmail hoods (coifs) that protect the neck. Under the mail coif was a padded cloth cap. This type of head protection was the most common through most of the Middle Ages. Variations were in how rounded or pointed the helmet was or whether it\n\nThe helmet of King Henry V of England is in the expensive, elaborate style required for 15th-century tournaments. Whether in battle or jousting, the knight’s neck, head, and face were entirely covered. The small slit allowed vision only when the knight’s head was lowered in a charge. The full helmet sacrificed visibility for protection. (Royal Armouries/David Lyons/StockphotoPro)\n\n27\n\nArmor was made from a single plate or several plates welded to a frame. In the later Middle Ages, the simple round helmet was called, in French, a cervellière. It could even be worn under a larger helmet. Later helmets were larger and flat on top. They protected the head better but restricted visibility. They had fitted leather linings that supported the helmet, similar to a football helmet. As fighting tactics changed, so too did helmet styles. There was always a trade-off between visibility and protection. Knights who were jousting or fighting in cavalry charges with lances needed maximum protection, even at the expense of visibility. Foot soldiers needed mobility and wore helmets that left the face open. The knight’s bascinet, in the 14th century, had a hinged visor that could be closed in fighting conditions or left open for visibility; one version had a hinge that allowed the visor to hang at the chin. The neck of the bascinet was covered with a plate so a chainmail hood was not necessary and the neck was better protected. This curved plate, called a gorget or an aventail, went all around the neck. Tournament helms were often beaked in front so they would turn a lance’s point to the side. Closed great helms were less and less used on the battlefield. A more practical battlefield helmet looked more like a hat with a brim; blows from above, such as from a mounted knight or a descending arrow, would glance off. It was used extensively by infantry soldiers during the 12th century and after. It was variously called a chapel de fer or war hat. It did not protect the wearer’s face, but it also did not restrict vision at all. In the 15th century, battlefield helmets still included both bascinets (especially to protect the face from arrows) and brimmed iron hats. Mail coifs were no longer used; most chainmail had fallen out of favor. Gorgets and aventails protected the throat and neck instead.\n\nMail Armor A mail shirt was usually called a hauberk, but in the Norse literature, it is called a byrnie. It was the earliest type of European armor, and it defended a fighter well against sword or knife cuts. It was not a good defense against spears or arrows, which could pierce and tear the rings. Mail was made from a fabric of interlocked iron rings. These rings were either made from iron wire or punched out from a thin sheet of iron. When they were made from wire, the process was fast. Wire was wrapped in a spiral around a rod and then cut along one side to make many single rings. The mail maker flatted the ends of each wire ring, reheating it to make it soft, and punched tiny holes in the metal. The ends overlapped so the ring could close. Wire rings were riveted with a special tool; when solid punched rings were used, they had to alternate with riveted wire rings—one riveted ring for every four solid ones connected to it.\n\n28\n\nA 12th-century mailed knight kneels to receive a blessing. Embroidered crosses on his surcote show that he is a Crusader. (The British Library/StockphotoPro)\n\nArmor The mail maker worked with a dummy like a dressmaker’s. The dummy had a head and shoulders, at least, so he could shape the fit of the rings around these surfaces. The mail across the chest and back did not need to be carefully shaped, but a mail hood, and mail shoulders and arms, had to fit properly. Mail makers probably used written patterns that told them how many rings to put in each row and how to link the rings for the proper shape, but no patterns or guild treatises on the craft survived. A mail hauberk alone was not enough. If the iron rings were pressed hard against flesh, they would cause their own injury, so there was always a leather or padded tunic under the hauberk. Once cotton was imported from Italy, it became the best quilt padding. During the 12th century, armor makers invented mail mittens to protect a fighter’s fingers. Called mufflers, they had fabric on the palms and a slit the hand could slip through, allowing the hand coverings to dangle. Armor makers also developed mail leggings, called chausses, that attached to straps under the tunic. These, too, had to be padded with leather or linen. In Anglo-Saxon and Frankish times, it is unlikely that the common foot soldier had a hauberk or byrnie. They were only used by elite warriors, as described in Beowulf. By the end of the Carolingian period, before the Norman conquest, 10th- and 11th-century soldiers were more likely to have mail shirts. A hauberk was an expensive investment, and it was passed down in families. In the 12th century, a lighter and less expensive form of mail hauberk was called a haubergeon. It did not have long mail sleeves or mittens. By the 13th century, there were even less expensive kinds of soft armor that may not have used any chainmail, only quilted cotton padding. Quilted armor types were called aketon (Arabic for cotton), gambeson, and pourpoint. A 14th-century development from the chainmail hauberk was a sleeveless leather tunic with metal plates riveted in an overlapping pattern that covered the surface completely. It is often called a coat of plates. The plates themselves did a better job of guarding the wearer against arrow points, but the riveted joints were weaker spots that an arrow or halberd might pierce. The leather, too, could be hardened to provide some protection. The coat of plates could be worn in combination with a mail hauberk, either over it or under it. Similarly, there had been a Byzantine and Asian tradition to use lamellar armor, which used small overlapping metal plates to cover the surface of leather. Lamellar armor sometimes used hardened leather alone, which was more common in areas that were both poorer and hotter than Northern Europe. The surcote was a linen tunic worn over chainmail. It kept the sun from direct contact with the metal, which could heat to the point of burning its wearer. The surcote was slit at the sides so it did not hinder movement. Crusaders’ surcotes were decorated with a red cross. Other knights wore surcotes with their heraldic arms or the arms of the lord they served.\n\n30\n\nArmor\n\nPlate Armor During the 13th century, metal plate armor began with open greaves that covered the shins and knees worn under mail hauberks. Closed greaves for the whole calf came after 1300, and then came full protection for the upper leg, called a cuisse or cuish. The entire leg harness was called the jamb, and its joint plate at the knee was called the poleyn. After 1380, leg armor included the sabaton, an iron shoe made of narrow plates that moved with the foot. Mounted on either steel shoe or leather boot, spurs completed the knight’s leg harness. The first plate armor for the body was a cuirass, a piece made to cover the chest and back. After an original leather foundation provided its name, the cuirass evolved into a shirt made of solid pieces of iron. Below the rib cage, the armor needed to flex and bend with the body, so it was made as iron rings riveted to a leather skirt on the main cuirass. These hoops could overlap and move as the body moved. The skirt of hoops was called a fauld. In the last years of the Middle Ages and moving into the Renaissance, armorers added tassets, additional protective plates hanging from the fauld. At the shoulders, where arm protection attached, there were hinged plates called pauldrons. Arm protection developed during the 14th century. Enclosed plates for the forearm and upper arm, called cannons, were hinged and connected by an elbow plate, the couter. The whole assembly was called a vambrace. Pieces of armor might be hinged and buckled, or they could come in separate pieces to be tied together. Some cuirasses were hinged on the left and then buckled on the right; others were separate back and front pieces. When armor was tied in place, it was often tied with laces sewn on the undergarments. The laces were made of waxed twine and were called points. Putting on armor took time and at least one servant’s help. Plate armor construction began with beating a sheet of heated iron into a thin plate, often with a water mill that drove mechanical hammers. Cut into proper shapes, the plates were beaten on anvils shaped like the final products. There were many different hammers, as well as different forms, and the best armor was thicker and thinner in strategic places. At some points, the metal could be hammered and worked while it was cold enough to touch; some contemporary drawings show smiths holding the pieces with bare hands. Frequently, the pieces had to be annealed; they were reheated to red hot and then allowed to cool and worked while still soft. Fine shaping and fitting had to be done with more care. Some knights had wax models of their legs or arms made so the armor could be custom fitted for them; others had cloth patterns cut to their limbs so the armor maker could reconstruct their exact shape. Fine adjustments in size and curvature were then made, with the pieces frequently annealed. At this\n\n31\n\nArmor stage, the edges of the plates were carefully fitted together or curled around to help deflect blows. Plates were case hardened by covering the outside with charcoal and heating it to red-hot again. The iron absorbed extra carbon and became a layer of steel on the outside of the iron. If it cooled very fast by being plunged into water, it became very hard and could be polished to look like glass, but it was also more brittle. Slower cooling, or cooling and then reheating to temper it, produced the best result. The process of determining how best to harden steel led to the first industrial tests. Blades, arrows, or bullets were used on the newly made armor to prove it was strong. This was called “armor of proof,” and it was guaranteed to work. The full harness was temporarily assembled, too, to check if it had been properly fitted. It was finished, but it was black, rough, and dented. The pieces of plate armor were polished, either by hand or on a waterdriven polishing wheel. The steel began to shine like glass. For luxury armor, the pieces were etched with acid or plated with gold. Finally, the master armorer finished the harness. He riveted the pieces together and riveted strips of leather to the proper edges. He riveted hinges made by a locksmith and added more straps and buckles. Many of the plates were fitted with padding. The final harness weighed around 60 pounds, comparable to a modern soldier’s heavy pack. In the 14th century, armorers developed plate armor for horses. The most important plate, the peytral, covered the horse’s chest, which was most vulnerable to a pike or lance attack. The face was also covered with a plate that left the mouth and nose open and had eyeholes and ear covers. This was called a shaffron, and a crinnet—a curved, hinged piece—sat on the back of the horse’s neck. Usually the horse’s flanks were covered with leather to protect against scratches without inhibiting the horse’s movement, but there were also full armor plates in occasional use. The crupper was a set of curved plates for the horse’s back end, while the midsection was protected by both the knight’s saddle and flanchards. The horse’s armor had to sit on a thickly quilted coat so it didn’t bruise the animal. There must have been great danger for the horses to overheat.

In England, the legend of King Arthur was extremely popular. The stories were anachronistic even then, set in a time long past but dressed in the fashions and attitudes of the High Middle Ages. They were a vehicle not only for entertainment but also for educating the aristocracy in the values of courtly love and chivalry. The setting for the legends of King Arthur is the period when the Roman Empire was collapsing and the Germanic tribes were expanding across Europe, pushing out the Celts who had been dominant under Rome. The basic framework is that the Roman troops had left, and the Saxons had initial victories, but the Britons organized themselves and drove the Saxons out for a time. During the time before the Anglo-Saxons returned in numbers, Arthur, the king responsible for their military success, ruled his land in peace and Christianity. Scholars debate whether a real King Arthur existed. Arthurs are listed in the Irish histories, but the details do not match the legends at all. At least one Roman with the family name Artorius came to Britain. The history of Gildas, a fifth-century British monk, told about the Battle of Badon Hill in which the Saxons were pushed back but did not mention Arthur. His military leader is named Ambrosius Aurelianus, a name without clear similarities to the name Arthur. Arthur could have been a nickname that came to mask a very different historical given name. In 1985, Geoffrey Ashe argued in The Discovery of Arthur that Camelot was Cadbury Castle in Somerset and Riothamus, a Romanized British general, was the true Arthur. After the Celtic Britons lost ground to the invading Anglo-Saxons, many of them withdrew to the mountains of Wales or crossed the channel to\n\n33\n\nArthur, King France, founding the county of Brittany. King Arthur emerged from the legends of Wales in the work of Geoffrey of Monmouth. Geoffrey, possibly a native speaker of Breton, the Celtic language that survived in Brittany, translated an earlier work into Latin, perhaps adding his own stories. His book was called Historia Regum Britanniae: The History of the Kings of Britain. In 1155, a Norman, Wace, translated Geoffrey’s work into French poetry, the “Roman de Brut.” Wace added the Round Table and some other flourishes. Provençal troubadours took over the story from there, adding side stories and new characters. The troubadours added the romance of Lancelot and Guinevere. Arthur’s story and related stories, such as Tristan and Isolde, were called “Matter of Britain” by the troubadours. Between 1170 and 1190, Chrétien de Troyes, a troubadour at the court of Marie de France, countess of Champagne, added the stories of “Yvain, Knight of the Lion,” “Lancelot, Knight of the Cart,” and “Perceval, the Story of the Grail” to the cycle. Around 1200, the English poet Layamon wrote the Arthurian stories back into Middle English, adding more details; he made the Round Table large enough to seat more than 1,000 knights. In the same period, Robert de Boron wrote some poems in which Merlin created the Round Table and made each name magically appear at a place. “Sir Gawain and the Green Knight,” an anonymous poem in Middle English, was written in the 14th century. Troubadours spread the stories, which were taken very seriously by both royalty and commoners. The authenticity of Geoffrey of Monmouth’s\n\nWinchester’s “Round Table,” made for a feast, soon lost its true history; people thought that it was King Arthur’s actual table. (Nick Lewis Photography)\n\n34\n\nArthur, King history was not doubted, and the inventions of the early period were absorbed into the assumed truth of the whole. After 14-year-old Eleanor of Provence married King Henry III in 1236, a court record suggests a trip to see Arthur’s grave. Their son, King Edward I, ordered a large round table made of wood and painted with the names of Arthur’s knights. It was used at a feast in the Great Hall of Winchester Castle, probably for an Arthurianthemed tournament. The table hung on the wall as a decoration for many centuries, long after the castle had been dismantled. In 1485, William Caxton, England’s first printer, published Thomas Mallory’s collection of Arthurian stories, Le Morte d’Arthur, translated from the French stories and songs. Mallory probably arranged the existing stories and added more of his own, playing up the Grail and including Arthur’s mystical death. A year later, King Henry VII and Elizabeth of York named their first son Arthur, hoping to unite an England fractured by civil war behind the national symbolism. Later, the large round table at Winchester Castle was even taken as proof of Arthur’s existence. The stories were set in a fabled 12-year peace between the Britons and the Saxons, when Geoffrey’s history placed Arthur’s court at the center of the world’s attention as a model of excellence. Arthur himself rarely starred in the tales, but his court at Camelot served as the framework for a series of adventures for his knights. One of Arthur’s convenient traits was to grant boons without knowing what they would be so plot complications could arise. He usually insisted on an adventure before the court could feast, which formed the frame story for stories like “Gawain and the Green Knight.” The basic types of Arthurian stories concerned the Holy Grail, Merlin, Lancelot and Guinevere, and the death of Arthur. Family matters for the knights were complicated; Arthur fathered a bastard son with his sister, without knowing who she was, and Lancelot fathered Galahad with the lady of the Grail Castle. Magical ladies, such as Morgan le Fay and the Lady of the Lake, could enchant, distract, and deceive, as with the repeating character of the “false Guinevere.” Arthur’s death came about through an involved story in which he must condemn his queen to death, besiege Lancelot’s castle, and fight against his bastard son, Mordred. Magical elements were never far off, as when a hand comes out of the lake to receive Excalibur at Arthur’s death. The cycle came to a rest with Merlin in an enchanted death-sleep, Arthur carried away by Morgan le Fay, Lancelot in a monastery, and Guinevere in a convent. The stories are profoundly anachronistic. Stone castles did not yet exist in the 6th century; a real Camelot could not have been more than a timberwalled hill fort. Although British, Irish, and Saxon kings had warrior bands, they did not have knights in the 13th-century sense. In the 6th century, warriors did not wear armor, nor did they hold tournaments. The British\n\n35\n\nAstrolabe of the 6th century were Christians, but the cult of the Virgin Mary and the Grail had not yet developed. Only the marriage details could be historical, since kings always married the daughters or sisters of nearby or rival kings. In the stories of Arthur, a medieval audience could enjoy a gilded version of their own world, in which everyone had noble purposes and experienced miracles. The Arthurian cycle served a further purpose in medieval society. Arthur’s knights were on the side of law and order, and they were deeply religious. They fought against ghostly demon knights who had not been true to the code of chivalry, and they opposed renegade knights who used their strength to rob and oppress. Malory’s Arthurian tales state that each year, the Round Table knights had to swear not to rape women. The legend became a set of morality tales for the knights and their social class, reminding them not to use their weapons for harm. In a heavily armed society, this was a much-needed value.

It could be used for telling time if the user’s latitude was known, for surveying, and for solving some geometry problems. A mariner’s astrolabe was developed for use on a ship’s deck. Similarly, the armillary sphere was a globe of the stars and planets and could be used as a teaching aid, for navigation, and to calculate future cycles of the planets. The first certain treatise on an astrolabe was written in 4th-century Alexandria, a scientific center of the Roman and Byzantine cultures. Knowledge of the astrolabe spread in Greek, Syriac, and Arabic, while travelers\n\n36\n\nAstrolabe carried them to Persia and India and west to North Africa and Spain. During the 10th century, scholars like Gerbert of Aurillac (the future Pope Sylvester) learned the astrolabe’s use in Barcelona and translated treatises into Latin. Most early European astrolabes were imported from Arabic regions, but they were a standard part of university study by the 13th century. They may not have been commercially produced in Europe until the 15th century. Astrolabes were made of brass. There was a hollow disk, the mater, that was deep enough to hold flat plates, the tympans. Each tympan was made for a specific latitude and was engraved with lines to represent objects in the sky as they appeared in that location. (Most astrolabes came with several spare tympans for different altitudes; these nested inside the mater’s womb and could be swapped when a traveler moved 70 miles north or south.) The rim of the disk was marked with hours of time, usually on the front, with degrees of arc on the back. On the back, there was often an alidade, a sighting instrument that allowed the user to measure a star’s altitude. The front had a rule, a rotating pointer. A single pin ran through the center, holding all the turning pieces together. The rete lay on top and could rotate. It was a precision-cut sheet of brass that functioned like a star chart, with pointers to the brightest stars and circles, arcs, and lines showing the celestial equator, ecliptics, and tropics. The center point functioned as the North Pole, while the rete itself was based on the position of the stars at the South Pole. A single full rotation of the rete represented one day. Most astrolabes had charts etched into the quadrants of the back piece, showing information needed for calculations. They could have a chart for solving trigonometry problems, since the alidade could be used for land surveying as well as astronomy. They could have data for calculating the position of the sun, the direction of Mecca, or unequal hours. The astrolabe’s chief purpose was to find stars; an astronomer could predict times of a star’s rising without direct observation. In observation use, the astrolabe could measure a star’s position so the astronomer could study heavenly movement. An astronomer could measure distances in the sky, such as a comet’s tail or the parallax of the moon. Astrology was considered a branch of astronomical science, since it explained the “natural magic” of the stars. Astrologers could use the astrolabe to tell what stars were in control at the time of a baby’s birth or the right times to try bleeding. The instrument also told time, and it showed how to convert between the unequal hours used by common people and the exact equal hours of science. Mosques used astrolabes to calculate the correct hours of prayer, although Christian churches did not look for such precision in prayer hours. Surveyors used astrolabes to solve trigonometric problems related to the height of buildings or the distances between places they could not measure\n\n37\n\nAstrolabe\n\nThe astrolabe was the first instrument to represent both time and space as a circle divided into 24 units. (Brian Maudsley)\n\ndirectly. Medieval surveyors could now measure the heights of mountains and the distances between their peaks. The principle of the astrolabe led to an early step in the development of the clock. One early clock, made around 1330, was essentially a star map rotating behind a fixed rete. The idea of a rotating hand moving around a marked dial led to the first clock faces. Armillary spheres were among the earliest complex mechanical devices. The armillary sphere was built as a model of the universe. It consisted of a set of graduated, interlocking brass rings (Latin armilla) that represented the circles made by the sun, the moon, the known planets, and some stars as they seemingly revolved around the earth each day. Rings also showed the equator, the earth’s poles, and the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, which mark the farthest points north and south at which the sun appears to be directly overhead. The 12 signs of the zodiac also are marked on a ring. At the center is a globe. During the Middle Ages, the armillary sphere was geocentric—that is, the central globe was the earth, with the rings showing how the sun, moon, stars, and so on all presumably revolved around the earth. Armillary spheres were developed by the Chinese and the Greeks. It is not known with certainty which culture was the source of Europeans’ knowledge of the spheres. During the Middle Ages, however, armillary\n\n38\n\nAstrolabe spheres became both more common and more sophisticated. There were four main ways they were used. Navigation was one important use of the armillary sphere. Sailors could use it to determine both what time it was and what latitude their ship was sailing on. It was used in astrology, to study the presumed connections between the heavens and events on earth. For example, people studied how the stars and planets were aligned at the time of the plague, hoping the next outbreak could be predicted; the medieval assumption was that certain alignments corrupted the air on earth. The armillary sphere was used to teach astronomy in universities, since the rings could be moved to demonstrate time and seasons. Similarly, church officials could use the sphere to calculate the dates of Easter. Easter was supposed to be after the first full moon after the spring equinox.

Infant mortality was high, and just surviving birth with a live mother was a significant achievement. Medieval people were sure babies who died unbaptized could not go to heaven, so an infant in danger must be baptized quickly. It is impossible to calculate infant mortality in medieval Europe because of inadequate record keeping, but as many as a quarter of babies may have died in their first year. Babies were born at home with the help of a midwife and the mother’s female relatives. Medieval society considered male doctors for women to be a scandalous idea, and some women may have given birth alone rather than let men assist them. When the baby was born, it was washed, sometimes in wine. In much of medieval Europe, babies were tightly swaddled with their arms and legs held straight. It was believed that the infant’s limbs needed to be straightened for the first few months or their bones would grow crooked. Medieval baptism meant the official naming of the child, as well as a ceremony that moved the child into Christendom—the kingdom of those who had been christened, another term for baptism. Babies were baptized early in their lives, often within a week, and not usually later than a few months. B"
