        "text": "James History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nEngland-Alt\n\nEngland\n\nIreland\n\nThe name James was brought to England in the great wave of migration following the Norman Conquest of 1066. It comes from the personal name Jacob, the Latin Jacobus via the Late Latin Jacomus. The Latin Jacobus is derived from the Hebrew name Yaakov which is traditionally interpreted as coming from the Hebrew akev, which means heel. 1\n\n\"The first appearance of this Christian name in our annals is in the Domesday [Book].\" 2\n\nJames the Cistercian (fl. 1270), also called James the Englishman, \"was the first professor of philosophy and theology in the college which Stephen Lexington, Abbot of Clairvaux, founded in the house of the counts of Champagne at Paris for the instruction of young Cistercians. \" 3\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the James family\n\nThe surname James was first found in Surrey. At an early time the name migrated from Normandy under the name FitzJames, as one of the noble house of Normandy. In nearby Utrecht the name became Van Haestrecht, whence it became FitzJames again, having migrated from Utrecht into England, into the manor of Ightham, at the time of King John, about the year 1210 A.D. They acquired the manors and estates of Hamon de Cravignuier, from De Inge, Zouch of Harringworth, Read, and Willoughby, and thence to the noble house of James.\n\n\"In early documents the name is usually Jacobus, but James is occasionally found in the 12th and 13th centuries, sometimes alternating with Jack or its diminutives Jackamin, Jackett and Jacklin.\" 4\n\n\"The principal home of this name is in South Wales and Monmouthshire. Lower tells us of a very ancient Pembroke family possessing an estate successively held by thirteen persons bearing the name of William James. 2 The name is also frequent in Shropshire and Herefordshire on the Welsh border, and in the neighbouring counties of Gloucester and Stafford. It is also numerous in the south - west of England, especially in Somerset, Dorset, and Cornwall. In the eastern counties it nearly disappears, but it reappears in the north, though in no great numbers. \" 5\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the James family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our James research. Another 117 words (8 lines of text) covering the years 1542, 1573, 1592, 1593, 1610, 1617, 1619, 1620, 1624, 1626, 1629, 1635, 1638, 1644, 1653, 1654, 1656, 1659, 1661, 1670, 1673, 1679, 1681, 1685, 1689, 1690, 1700, 1702, 1705 and 1719 are included under the topic Early James History in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nJames Spelling Variations\n\nA multitude of spelling variations characterize Norman surnames. Many variations occurred because Old and Middle English lacked any definite spelling rules. The introduction of Norman French to England also had a pronounced effect, as did the court languages of Latin and French. Therefore, one person was often referred to by several different spellings in a single lifetime. The various spellings include James, Fitzjames, St. James, Jaimes, Geames and many more.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Notables of the James family\n\nOutstanding amongst the family at this time was\n\nRichard James (1592-1638), English scholar, born at Newport in the Isle of Wight in 1592, the third son of Andrew James of that town, by his wife Dorothy, daughter of Philip Poore of Durrington, Wilts...\n\nThomas James (1573?-1629), was Bodley's librarian, uncle of Richard James [q. v.], was born about 1573 at Newport, Isle of Wight. 3\n\nThomas James (1593?-1635?), was a navigator, a kinsman, it is believed, of Thomas James (d. 1619), alderman and twice mayor of Bristol, was born about 1593. 3\n\nWilliam James (1542-1617), was Bishop of Durham, the second son of John James of Little Onn, Staffordshire, by Ellen, daughter of William Bolte of Sandbach, Cheshire, where William was born in 1542.

The British continued to expand the settlements including setting the First Federation in the British West Indies by 1674; some of the islands include Barbados, Bermuda, Cayman Island, Turks and Caicos, Jamaica and Belize then known as British Honduras. By the 1960's many of the islands became independent after the West Indies Federation which existed from 1958 to 1962 failed due to internal political conflicts.

Mottoes first began to be shown with arms in the 14th and 15th centuries, but were not in general use until the 17th century. Thus the oldest coats of arms generally do not include a motto. Mottoes seldom form part of the grant of arms: Under most heraldic authorities, a motto is an optional component of the coat of arms, and can be added to or changed at will; many families have chosen not to display a motto.\n\nMotto: J'aime à jamais\n\nMotto Translation: I love forever.\n\nSuggested Readings for the name James +\n\nJames Families of America Since 1630 by Wynne James.\n\nThe James Family of Wales and Bucks County, Pennsylvania, 1638-1974 by Wynne James.\n\nCitations +\n\nHarrison, Henry, Surnames of the United Kingdom: A Concise Etymological Dictionary Baltimore: Geneological Publishing Company, 2013.
