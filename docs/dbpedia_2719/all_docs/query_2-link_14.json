A life of Rossetti, in the full sense of the word, could only be written by one who was intimately and sympathetically associated with his work during the major portion of his career; and of the very few who could have undertaken the task some are no longer alive, whilst others have either abandoned or postponed it until too late. For this reason we can hardly expect now to have a life of this great and most original genius, written by anyone with enough knowledge to interpret his many-coloured personality, yet sufficiently disinterested to form a critical estimate of his true position and influence.\n\nOf the materials which I have mentioned it would be ungrateful to complain, seeing that as occasion demanded I have used or borrowed from most of them. I must, however, say that careful research has not always tended to confirm the information they afforded, and I may claim, I think, for this memoir that it will be found correct on many points where errors previously existed. Three of the above-named authorities, Mr. Sharp, Mr. Knight, and Mr. W. M. Rossetti, have published catalogues or lists of Rossetti's pictures, giving dates and a few other scanty particulars. Mr. Rossetti's list is certainly by far the best of these, though not itself complete, the two earlier ones being almost useless now for purposes of reference. I say this with no intention of disparagement, for Mr. Sharp's list was a wonderful one to have compiled in the time allowed him; and he had no previous data to work on, whereas I have had three lists to collate and check, and possibly better opportunities of acquiring information. In addition I have received much help with some of the more tangled problems both from Mr. Rossetti and from Mr. Fairfax Murray, the latter of whom is recognized as an expert in all matters connected with Rossetti's work. To Mr. Murray moreover I am indebted for kindly checking the list of works and dates which appears as an appendix to this volume, as well as for revising some of the proofs. What use I have made of the assistance so generously given is my own affair, and for this I alone am answerable. In acknowledging the benefit I do not wish to alienate the responsibility.\n\nWith a few rare exceptions, owing to owners' refusals, or in the case of The Blue Bower and The Blessed Damozel from the pictures being held in trust, there is scarcely a work of individual importance by Rossetti which will not be found illustrated in this book or in some way represented. In general, moreover, where a choice existed, it is the best version of each particular subject from which the reproduction has been made, though there are cases where this was not possible, owing to the pictures having gone abroad or become untraceable. It would hardly be believed how difficult Rossetti's pictures are to find since their dispersal after the great Graham, Leyland, Turner, Ruston, and Leathart sales. Even with the kind help of Mr. Croal Thomson and Messrs. Agnew there are many that I have not located, though I have been fortunate in borrowing private photographs of some of these and published prints of others. No doubt the constantly increasing value of Rossetti's works is partly responsible for their restlessness, but there is something almost melancholy in the way that they seem perpetually to change hands. The Rae and Heaton collections are almost the only ones of importance that have remained intact. Mr. Ruskin, who at one time had quite a number of good water-colours, has parted with all but the unfinished Passover , and no one seems to know where some of them have gone. The Boyce collection has shared the same fate, though in this case the bulk of it has passed into the hands of Mr. Murray, who amid the maelstrom of flux and change has constituted himself a sort of natural vortex or harbour of refuge.\n\nThis is one of the circumstances which has made the illustration of a book on Rossetti not altogether easy, and which may have prevented its being undertaken before. Even now I am conscious of many omissions and failures, which mar the completeness of the work. But it is no part of an author's duty to specify these for his readers, most of whom will be ready enough to find them, and perfectly candid in pointing them out.\n\nH. C.

B\n\nDANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nINTRODUCTORY\n\nAlbeit English in its main external features, the environment of the Rossetti family in London remained essentially Italian during the lifetime of Gabriele Rossetti. Their house was the resort of all classes of Italians passing through or resident in town. Musicians and literary men met there with revolutionaries fresh from the wasting struggle for Italian liberty. A romantic odour of assassination hung round one at least of the regular habitués of the house, and added spice to the somewhat fusty atmosphere of the father's own particular studies. Gabriele Rossetti was a commentator on Dante, and himself a writer of verse, mainly in a politico-satirical vein. He had a gift for declamation and improvization, which is not so uncommon in men of his nationality as of ours; but the exposition of Dante was his chief occupation, as well as the one by which he is now best known. To the ears of the young Gabriel, familiarized by habit with the sonorous metres of the “Inferno” and “Paradiso,” the name of Dante for many years conjured up no very stimulating thoughts. It was not until he had begun himself in early life to read upon his own lines, that the pictorial richness and splendour of the Florentine dawned on him and seized him with its spell. There is a sketch by Rossetti of his father, engaged upon his labours of interpretation, and surrounded, as Mr. W. M. Rossetti has described him, by heavy folios in italic type, his “libri mistici,” full of the lore of Swedenborg, alchemy, and Brahminism, with the aid of which he is devotedly burying the poetry of his subject beneath unprofitable layers of teleological symbolism. “The ‘Convito,’ ” says his son, “was always a name of dread to us, as being the very essence of arid unreadableness,” an interesting fact to remember when dealing, as we shall presently have to do, with the influence which Dante was destined afterwards to exert upon two members at least of the family.\n\nMr. William Bell Scott, in his “Autobiographical Notes,” says, “I entered the small front parlour or dining-room of the house, and found an old gentleman sitting by the fire in a great chair, the table drawn close to his chair, with a thick MS. book open before him, and the largest snuff-box I ever saw beside it conveniently open. He had a black cap on his head furnished with a great peak or shade for the eyes, so that I only saw his face partially.” This description tallies in a remarkable way with the drawing of his father just mentioned, done by Dante Gabriel in 1853, though otherwise not remarkable for insight or fullness of detail. A more interesting picture is one by Mr. F. G. Stephens, Rossetti's early associate, quoted from his “ Portfolio” monograph:\n\n“As might be expected of one possessing so many accomplishments, and whose career was marked by so much courage, the professor was a man of striking character and aspect. . . . To a youngster, such as I was, he seemed much older than his years, and while seated reading at a table with two candles behind him, and, because his sight was failing, with a wide shade over his eyes, he looked a very Rembrandt come to life. . . . Near his side, but beyond the radiant circle of the candles,—her erect, comely, and very English form and face remarkable for its noble and beautiful matronhood, sat Mrs. Rossetti, the mother of Dante Gabriel. He too, leaning his elbows upon the table and holding his face between both hands so that the long curling masses of his dark brown hair fell forward, sat on the other side, his attenuated features outlined by the candle's light.”\n\nReared in this studious atmosphere, it is not to be wondered at that the young Rossettis early took to literature. Before they were six years old they had made acquaintance with Shakespeare and Scott, in addition to the usual works of childhood, and were steeped in romance of a more lofty kind than is common at such an age. A healthy crudity of taste and strong boyish proclivities, together with the influence of his mother, prevented this precocity from developing into priggishness in the case of the youthful Gabriel, whose letters, even up to his sixteenth or seventeenth year, are as remarkable for naïve simplicity as for their rather florid style and sonorous diction. They are also marked by an early sense of humour. How many children of fourteen are there who possess the power of expression, to say nothing of the critical observation, shown by this juvenile specimen of Gabriel's domestic correspondence.\n\npage: 5\n\n“CHALFONT ST.-GILES,\n\n“ Thursday, 1 Sept., 1842.\n\n“MY DEAR MAMMA,\n\n“We arrived safely at Chalfront at 12 o'clock yesterday. The village is larger than I expected. The first thing we did on our arrival was to demolish bread and butter, of which I at least was much in want. We then, with considerable difficulty, opened Uncle Henry's trunks, and after depositing a portion of their contents in a chest of drawers, sallied forth to reconnoitre. I saw Milton's house, which is unquestionably the ugliest and dirtiest building in the whole village. 1 It is now occupied by a tailor. . . .\n\n“Yesterday I commenced reading ‘The Infidel's Doom,’ by Dr. Birch, which work forms part and parcel of Uncle Henry's library. However, I have abandoned the task in despair. I then began ‘ The Castle of Otranto,’ which shared the same fate, and am now engaged on Defoe's ‘ History of the Plague.’ This morning we deposited Uncle Henry's books in a closet in Uncle Henry's bedroom, which, in common with all the other closets in this house, possesses a lock but no key.\n\n“I do not think that I shall go to church on Sunday, for in the first place I do not know where I can sit, and in the second place I find we are so stared at wherever we go that I do not much relish the idea of sitting for two hours the loadstone of attraction in the very centre of the aborigines, on whose minds curiosity seems to have taken strong hold. . . . I ‘in longing expectation wait’ the appearance of my dinner; for which, however, I need not yet look, since it is now nearly three o'clock, which is the nominal dinner hour, but, the fire having gone out, Uncle Henry prophesies that it will not come till 4.\n\n“I remain, dear Mamma,\n\n“Your affectionate son,\n\n“GABRIEL ROSSETTI”\n\nIn 1837, after a short preliminary training at a private school, Dante Gabriel and his brother were admitted to King's College, where their father was Italian professor. Here the former remained for four or five years, acquiring a fair knowledge of Latin and French, with a smattering of Greek. German he learnt just well enough to enter upon a study of the wonderful literature of that language, and Italian, of course, came naturally to him. The drawing-master at King's College was the celebrated Cotman, of Norwich, from whom, however, he derived little or no instruction.His artistic training did not begin until 1842, when he left school, 2 and entered himself at a drawing academy known in those days as “Sass's,” and kept by Mr. F. S. Cary, son of the translator of Dante.\n\nTo return to his artistic life, Gabriel Rossetti remained some four years at Cary's Academy, during which period he seems to have acquired the bare rudiments of his art and to have made a small reputation for eccentricity. In July, 1846, having sent in the requisite probation-drawings, he was admitted to the Antique School of the Royal Academy. His first appearance is thus graphically delineated by a fellow-student, whose observant eye has preserved for us a probably accurate conception of the fiery young enthusiast, impatient of ordinary considerations in the matter of attire, burning with zeal to paint his already vivid imaginings, yet scornful of the routine and drudgery by which it was supposed that masterhood must be acquired. The description, from which the following is an extract, has often been quoted before.\n\n“Thick, beautiful, and closely-curled masses of rich brown much-neglected hair fell about an ample brow, and almost to the wearer's shoulders; strong eyebrows marked with their dark shadows a pair of rather sunken eyes, in which a sort of fire, instinct with what may be called proud cynicism, burned with a furtive sort of energy. His rather high cheekbones were the more observable because his cheeks were roseless and hollow enough to indicate the waste of life and midnight oil to which the youth was addicted. Close shaving left bare his very full, not to say sensuous lips, and square-cut masculine chin. Rather below the middle height, and with a slightly rolling gait, Rossetti came forward among his fellows with a jerky step, tossed the falling hair back from his face, and, having both hands in his pockets, faced the student world with an insouciant air which savoured of thorough self-reliance. A bare throat, a falling, ill-kept collar, boots not over familiar with brushes, black and well-worn habiliments, including not the ordinary jacket of the period, but a loose dress-coat which had once been new—these were the outward and visible signs of a mood which cared even less for appearances than the art-student of those days was accustomed to care, which undoubtedly was little enough.”\n\npage: 14\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nTHE “PRE-RAPHAELITE BROTHERHOOD”\n\nIN relating afresh the history of the “Pre-Raphaelite” movement, one has many precedents to choose from. According to the point of view selected one may see in it the conscious expression of a great artistic revival, deliberately planned by a body of zealots, and based upon a structure of lofty principles; or one may go to the opposite extreme and regard it merely as an exuberant freak, an irresponsible outburst on the part of a few impulsive youths linked together for one brief moment by a mutual combination of enthusiasm and high spirits. For both of these points of view ample authority might be quoted, and the truth as usual lies somewhere safe between them. For the more emotional and serious aspect of the case we have to thank Mr. Ruskin, who, finding in the work of the men in question qualities and tentative aims such as he himself admired, forthwith, as his manner was, read into it all the high morality of purpose and principle that he conceived appropriate to ideal craftsmanship. On the other hand, there have never lacked writers who from personal dislike, or, it may be, a touch of jealousy, have tried to depreciate both Rossetti's work and his wonderful influence over others. The facts of the case are, it happens, abundantly in evidence. From Mr. Holman Hunt, Mr. F. G. Stephens, Mr. W. M. Rossetti, and from others, who, if not so intimately connected with the movement as these, were at all events in a good position to know about it, we have received separate, and on the whole confirmatory accounts of its origin and aims. No personal feeling or bias any longer obtrudes itself into the matter; we can see the truth, if we will, in a clear perspective, and nothing remains to obscure our vision but the amount of distortion that it may have contracted from impressions formed on writers of the above-mentioned divergent opinions, or from strongly developed artistic sympathies and prejudices.\n\npage: 15\n\nThe tendency has been on the whole, not unnaturally, to exaggerate the significance, and to over-estimate the importance of the “Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood,” which after all was but the grain of mustard seed from which a great tree sprung. Looking upon the tree, some are apt to magnify the seed, forgetting what qualities of climate, soil, or accident may have assisted to promote its growth. Those who do so, however, must either not have passed through an impressionable youth themselves, or else have forgotten how naturally at such a budding age men form romantic coteries based upon common friendships, common ideals, and common habits of life. In such associations there is nearly always one dominant personality which gives the tone to the set. A craving for expression, and more particularly for expression in verse, is also a general characteristic. The intellectual standing of the members of such a group is, no doubt, a measure of the value of such expression, but not of its earnestness or motive power, its romantic affinities, or its influence upon the men so brought together. Dozens of “Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhoods” are formed every year, at the great schools and at the universities, tracing lineal human descent from the classical age which combined Platonic friendship with an enthusiasm for philosophy. That few or none of them rise to celebrity is not so wonderful as that one should have attained to such celebrity. Accident and circumstance, at least as much as the strong personal qualities of the members of the group, combined to bring this about; and if argument were needed to prove it, beyond the witness of the facts themselves, it would be found in the deprecatory manner in which the leading “Pre-Raphaelites,” and none more than Rossetti, were accustomed to look back on their turbulent, romantic, and on all accounts most interesting past.\n\nWe left Rossetti, in order to describe the formation of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, at the point where he had just settled down in a joint studio with Holman Hunt to paint his first picture. In an enthusiasm for community of action, and a spirit of devotion to Keats, it had been proposed that each of the Brethren should illustrate, by an etching, a scene from that poet's “Isabella”. Hunt, however, was already engaged upon his picture of Rienzi swearing Revenge over his Brother's Corpse ; Millais had work of a less than Pre-Raphaelite character to finish off, and Rossetti himself was seized with desire to paint a subject which much commended itself to his intensely mystical and symbol-loving mind, The Girlhood of Mary Virgin . The only one of the three, eventually, who touched Keats that year (1848) was Millais, who achieved a real triumph with the striking picture, Lorenzo and Isabella . He had been engaged to the last minute upon his old work, when suddenly, in the graphic words of Mr. Hunt, about November, the whole atmosphere of his studio was changed, and the new white canvas was installed on the easel. Day by day advanced, at a pace beyond all calculation, the picture now known to the whole of England, which I venture to say is the most wonderful painting that any youth still under twenty years of age ever did in the world. Whether posterity will support so overwhelming a verdict as this may, without disrespect either to the critic or the picture, be questioned.\n\nSo by the following spring (1849) all three pictures were ready for exhibition, and were hung, Millais's and Hunt's in the Academy, and Rossetti's either from choice or necessity in the so-called Free Exhibition held in a gallery at Hyde Park Corner. Here it was bought for £80 by the Marchioness of Bath, in whose family an aunt of Rossetti's was acting as governess; and on her death it was bequeathed to her daughter, Lady Louisa Feilding. It is now in the possession of Mrs. Jekyll, one of the daughters of the late William Graham, by whose courtesy it is reproduced here.\n\nTwo or three other pen-and-ink drawings of 1848 belong to Mr. J. A. R. Munro, having been originally given to Rossetti's friend, Alex. Munro, the sculptor. They include Gretchen in the Chapel , with Mephistopheles whispering in her ear, and The Sun may shine and we be cold , a sketch of a girl with clasped hands, crouching in the embrasure of a window, apparently a prisoner. Both of these were exhibited in 1883 at the Burlington Fine Arts Club.\n\nThe cream of Rossetti's Pre-Raphaelite work, however, during the two years subsequent to 1848, is the Ecce Ancilla Domini , a sequel in sentiment to Rossetti's picture of the previous year, and the realization on canvas of the last lines of the sonnet.This is so well known to frequenters of the National Gallery 1 that to describe it would be superfluous. It was exhibited in 1850 under the same auspices as its predecessor (though the gallery this year was moved to Portland Place), and was priced at £50. Its appearance was the signal for a storm of abuse and raillery, which descended with impartial violence also upon the pictures of the other Pre-Raphaelite brothers exhibited at the Academy, and which pursued them relentlessly until time and success finally established their position. Munro, the sculptor, just mentioned, had incautiously published the meaning of the mystic letters P.R.B., and no peace or quarter was vouchsafed to those who dared to stand up against traditional authority.\n\nOn the other hand, if we are not to credit the “Pre-Raphaelites” with all the fine sentiments attributed to them in Ruskin's inspired defence, it is absurd to imagine, as some have done, that they failed to take themselves or their work seriously because Rossetti in his family letters used to speak flippantly of his unlucky little picture, which, like a curse, had come home to roost. Men often enough speak lightly to friends of things which have lain at the heart; and if Rossetti joked to his brother about “the blessed white eyesore” and “the blessed white daub,” it is none the less true that he had striven to put all his thoughts and all his knowledge into it, with such success that it reveals to us to-day an intensity of feeling and reverence which few modern painters have emulated, and to which Rossetti in his later work did not always attain.\n\nOn the whole, the announcement in “ Art and Poetry” is worse than this. It contains the following paragraph:\n\n“With a view to obtain the thoughts of Artists, upon Nature as evolved in Art, in another language besides their own proper one, this Periodical has been established. Thus, then, it is not open to the conflicting opinions of all who handle the brush and palette, nor is it restricted to actual practitioners; but is intended to enunciate the principles of those who, in the true spirit of Art, enforce a rigid adherence to the simplicity of Nature either in Art or Poetry, and consequently regardless (sic) whether emanating from practical Artists, or from those who have studied Nature in the Artist's School.”\n\nThe “ Germ,” as its brief career sufficiently denotes, fell almost stillborn upon an ungrateful world; but amongst a small class of artists and admirers it undoubtedly served to strengthen Rossetti's reputation. There was nothing feeble or immature about the poetical ideas expressed in it, and one may even be surprised that such an original piece of work as the “Blessed Damozel” did not attract greater attention, imperfect as it now seems compared with the revised and later versions. Both this and “Hand and Soul” have frequently been reprinted. The latter is valuable, in addition to its literary qualities, for the light it throws upon Rossetti's mediæval and mystical mind. To some extent it is no doubt an autobiographical record, a memory of mental perturbations and experiences which beset the young painter, striving to preserve and foster the spiritual side of his nature at the expense of more than commonly strong bodily inclinations. From an abstraction like this story of the mythical young painter Chiaro dell' Erma, we may feel we get one truer glimpse of the real Rossetti than any number of life-histories, overlaid with trivial incidents which obscure rather than reveal his personality, can give us.\n\nLet us be frank, and not try to understand Rossetti. He probably did not fully understand himself, if he even ever sought to. He has written poems and painted pictures that charm us by their infinite light and shade, their suggestiveness, their harmony, their music, their colour, and a hundred subtle qualities not to be described. Why should we cavil at accents, at occasional faults of drawing, when there is so much beyond that lies outside of us and above our commonplace? The art of modern journalism is gradually subjecting all great men and all great things to the insult of our understanding. Is not this sufficient reason why we should give thanks to Heaven for one revelation that is cryptic, one man of passion and genius whom not even biographies as yet have entirely reduced to common terms?\n\npage: 32\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nWORK 1849 TO 1853\n\nINFLUENCE OF BROWNING AND DANTE\n\nBEFORE the first number of the “ Germ” had appeared, and while it was in progress, Rossetti, accompanied by Holman Hunt, paid a short and hurried visit to Paris and Belgium. A rhyming diary and a series of jocular sonnets, interspersed with a few serious ones, recall the vigour of his first impressions. A large proportion of the time was spent at the Louvre and other galleries, rushing through Old Masters at a furious rate. A sonnet marked each stop. Giorgione's Venetian Pastoral evoked the fine one beginning “Water, for anguish of the solstice,” Ingres's Ruggiero and Angelica afforded material for a second, being, as Rossetti writes, “unsurpassed for exquisite perfection by anything I have ever seen.” This slightly premature pronouncement was accompanied by another, which serves to show that Rossetti's taste in art was still an unfixed and indefinite quantity: “Now for the best,” he writes, “Hunt and I solemnly decided that the most perfect works, takenin toto, that we have seen in our lives are two pictures by Hippolyte Flandrin, in the Church of St. Germain des Près. Wonderful! wonderful!! wonderful!!!”\n\nCorrespondingly emphatic, but abusive, were his comments on the work of “Rubens, Correggio, et hoc genus omne,”\n\n“Because, dear God! the flesh thou madest smooth\n\nThese carked and fretted, that it seemed to run\n\nWith ulcers; and the daylight of thy sun\n\nThey parcelled into blots and glares, uncouth\n\nWith stagnant grouts of paint.”\n\nThe Laboratory was, in all probability, Rossetti's first attempt at water-colour (it is painted over a pen-and-ink drawing, as several of his early ones were), and bears but slight resemblance either in thought or execution to the work by which he is popularly known. The picture bears the legend:\n\n“In this devil's smithy\n\nWhere is the poison to poison her, prithee?”\n\nand illustrates the scene described by Browning as typical of the “ancien régime.” The lady of the poem, with passion in her eyes and clenched hand, rises to take the tiny phial which the alchemist has prepared for her, and is depositing her jewels and offering the old man her mouth to “kiss if he will,” before going on to the ball where she is to meet her rival. The brilliant and striking colour, and the movement of this drawing are much commented on by Mr. Stephens, and besides reflecting, according to his judgment, the teaching of Madox Brown and the influences of the Flemish and Italian pictures just visited, mark the decided opening of Rossetti's second period.\n\nIn addition to these three subjects, chosen, as he put it with a certain wayward affectation of insincerity, “on account of their presumptive saleableness,” but also out of his deep admiration for Browning, 1 Rossetti drew or painted in the years 1849-50 other themes of a romantic and mediæval nature. Amongst them was his first illustration to Shakespeare, a scene from “Much Ado about Nothing,” representing the happy lovers, Benedick and Beatrice , receiving the felicitations of those who had plotted their match. Rossetti wrote to his brother on September 3rd, 1850, describing the subject and announcing his intention of painting it. The water-colour was never executed, but the author possesses the pencil design, reproduced on the next page, which shows the composition and grouping of the characters.\n\nMiss Siddal was the model for most of Rossetti's earliest and finest water-colours containing women, and probably for all his Beatrices except the last. A little later Miss Fanny Cornforth, a favourite model, who sat to Rossetti until almost the end of his life, began to appear at intervals in his pictures, notably as the woman in Found .\n\nIn the same year (1851) was produced the first design for a subject of weird and ghostly conception, called How they met Themselves . This depicts a pair of lovers wandering at twilight in a wood, and suddenly confronted with their own doubles. The lady is fainting; her lover with a terrified look essays to draw his sword. The apparitions, glancing defiantly and ominously in their faces, are passing on, outlined with a pale halo of light. The legend of the Döppelgänger was one of a class of mysterious horrors which greatly appealed to Rossetti's imagination, and which fascinated him from boyhood up. Few but he would however have dared to draw it, and fewer still could have succeeded with it. The first design just referred to, in pen-and-ink, was destroyed or lost at an early date; but Rossetti re-drew it for Mr. Boyce in 1860 whilst at Paris on his honeymoon, and four years later painted two water-colour versions, [version 1] [version 2] one of which, formerly included in the Graham collection, and now belonging to Mr. S. Pepys Cockerell, is reproduced here. It was last seen in public at the New Gallery, 1897-8. The other was lent to the Burlington Fine Arts Club in 1883 by Mr. J. Anderson Rose. It is, according to Mr. Fairfax Murray, rather the finer of the two, and is now in California. The pen-and-ink version dated 1851-1860 was exhibited at Burlington House in 1883, the year after the artist's death. It was one of a number of subjects which Rossetti had photographed from time to time in order to distribute copies to his friends.\n\nTo the year following, 1852, belongs a remarkably fine water-colour, representing Giotto painting the portrait of Dante . 1\n\nThe subject is intended to give expression to the following lines from Canto XI. of the Purgatorio on the waxing and waning of fame:\n\n“Credette Cimabue nella pintura\n\nTener lo campo; ed ora ha Giotto il grido,\n\nSì che la fama di colui oscura.\n\nCosì ha tolto l'uno all' altro Guido\n\nLa gloria della lingua; e forse è nato\n\nChi l'uno e l'altro caccerà del nido.”\n\nThis picture, we are informed by Mr. W. M. Rossetti (“ Letters and Memoir,” vol. i., p. 163), was intended only for the centre of a triptych, on the sides of which were to be represented Dante, as one of the Priori, banishing the factious chiefs from Florence, and next Dante, mocked by the clown, in exile at the court of Can Grande. The rest of the subject was never painted. Mr. MacCracken was at one time in treaty for the water-colour, which however passed into the possession of Thomas Seddon, the artist, one of the early friends of the group. A few years ago it was sold at auction, and realized no less a sum than £630, being more than sixty times the amount originally paid for it to the artist. The present owner is Mr. John Aird, M.P.\n\nThe little water-colour sketch called Carlisle Wall , in the collection of the late Mr. Virtue Tebbs, belongs to 1853. It was simply named The Lovers originally, and the inscription states that it was done at Carlisle. Mr. Tebbs himself gave the picture the name it bears, probably because the rich sunset effect behind the lovers on the tower suggested to him the ballad line, “The sun shines red on Carlisle wall.” The picture first belonged to Madox Brown, and passed through two other hands at least before it reached its late owner. It was exhibited at Burlington House in 1883, and again at the New Gallery in 1897-8.\n\nTranscribed Footnote (page 41):\n\n1 The real date of the drawing is probably 1850. It was altered later and inscribed as “drawn in 1853.”\n\npage: 42\n\nIn connection with Mr. MacCracken he writes: “I replied to what he said about The House of John and told him that I should have no objection to paint something else instead, mentioning the two pictures I had in contemplation, viz., the Magdalene at the door of Simon and the town subject. . . . I also offered him the Dante water-colour, begun in London, for thirty-five guineas. This last he snatches at. . . .”\n\nThe “Dante water-colour” was the advanced version of his pen-and-ink design, Dante drawing the Angel on the Anniversary of Beatrice's Death ( reproduced page 36). After multitudinous negotiations this drawing actually passed into MacCracken's hands, and at his sale, in May, 1855, was bought by Mr. Thomas Combe, of Oxford. Rossetti, before the picture left him, worked on it for several months, improving it so much beyond his original idea that he says, “the stipulated thirty-five guineas is absurdly under its value now, and I think I must give MacCracken to understand as much.” In an explanatory letter, such as he was fond of sending with his pictures, Rossetti says that he had had “an idea of an intention of the possibility of a suggestion” that he would turn the lady visitor into Gemma Donati, whom Dante afterwards married, and so he meant to paint the Donati arms on her dress, but gave it up as impracticable. He also had a notion of connecting the same personage with the “Lady of Pity” who occurs in the “ Vita Nuova,” and whom he painted more than once later.\n\nThere was something in the air at the time which caused this everlasting and painful human problem to take strong hold of the entire group of “Pre-Raphaelite” poets and painters. Bell Scott, as we have seen, treated it pretty openly in his poem called“Rosabell” or “Mary Anne”. Holman Hunt painted it in a much-discussed picture, The Awakened Conscience . Rossetti sought to give expression to it in Found , and also in a different manner in “Jenny”, one of the earliest of his poems. The theme comes out in other work of his besides, as, for instance, in the Gate of Memory and in the drawing called Hesterna Rosa . Difficult as it is to treat delicately, the subject in Rossetti's hands never falls below a lofty level of reverence and pathos. Hood was not more sympathetic or pure-minded in his treatment of it. That “Jenny”, which breathes the very spirit of pitiful tenderness, should have been attacked later on the grounds of impurity is one of those incongruities of the journalistic mind which cannot rationally be accounted for.\n\nThere were a few exceptions to his rule of seclusion which may as well be mentioned here, though they involve some anticipation of future chapters. In 1857 a small “Pre-Raphaelite Exhibition” was organized at No. 4, Russell Place, Fitzroy Square, to which Millais, Holman Hunt, Madox Brown, Arthur Hughes, W. L. Windus and others all sent pictures. Rossetti exhibited a water-colour Dante's Dream , Dante drawing the Angel , the pen-and-ink Hesterna Rosa , a Mary Magdalene at the Door of Simon , and a very beautiful little water-colour done in this year, the Blue Closet . In 1858, at the annual exhibition of the Liverpool Academy, a body which for many years was staunchly faithful to the Pre-Raphaelites, and which died for its allegiance, Rossetti exhibited the Dante's Dream again and two other water-colours, the Christmas Carol and Wedding of St. George . In this year the old Hogarth Club was founded, and Rossetti at first took some interest in its exhibitions. The earliest version of Lucretia Borgia was exhibited under these auspices, as was also the oil portrait called Bocca Baciata , and possibly other things as well. In 1862 the Royal Scottish Academy in Edinburgh held an exhibition to which Rossetti sent for sale, from his studio in London, a study for Found called The Farmer's Daughter and a head in oils called Fair Rosamund . A few other pictures were exhibited in Glasgow (1878 and 1879), Liverpool (1864), and Edinburgh (1877); and the great Loan Exhibition in Manchester in 1882, the last year of Rossetti's life, included no fewer than nine subjects by his hand—the greatest number ever exhibited together up to that date. With these exceptions, and possibly one or two others of minor importance, it is essential to remember that Rossetti's work was absolutely unseen by the public, who became acquainted with him as a poet long before they knew him even dimly as a painter. The effects of this ignorance are still discernible. Even after two great exhibitions of his works in London, and after the publication of a wide selection from his designs, there are people who believe that Rossetti never painted but from one model, and that all his pictures are distinguished by impossible lips and a goitrous development of neck.\n\npage: [50arecto]\n\npage: [50averso]\n\nNote: blank page\n\npage: 51\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nFRIENDSHIP WITH RUSKIN.—MARRIAGE, AND\n\nDEATH OF MRS. ROSSETTI\n\nRossetti seems to have gone to Paris and to have enjoyed meeting the Brownings there, after which the incident drops. No one can read these letters of Ruskin's without feeling that there breathes through them a spirit of wonderful generosity and kindness, unmixed with a single mean thought or secondary motive. He never tried to get a drawing more cheaply than the market price, or to sell it at a higher without sending the difference to the artist. The wiles of the bargainer were foreign to him, and even in conferring kindnesses he is at evident pains to conceal the obligation. On the other hand he had, in private as well as in his writings, a vigorous mode of expression not always meant to be taken seriously, and a dogmatic way of criticising what he did not like, and of suggesting alterations, which some men might not have resented, but which Rossetti in time could not bring himself to bear. The next letter to the one just quoted is an instance in point:\n\n“DEAR ROSSETTI,\n\n“ I have been mighty poorly. . . . Coming to scratch again gradually. Please oblige me in one or two matters or you will make me ill again. Take all the pure green out of the flesh in the Nativity I send, and try to get it a little less like worsted work by Wednesday, when I will send for it. I want the Archdeacon of Salop, who is coming for some practical talk over religious art for the multitude, to see it. . . .”\n\n“You are a conceited monkey,” he writes once more on a similar occasion, when an alteration had displeased him, “thinking your pictures right when I tell you positively they are wrong. What do you know about the matter, I should like to know?”\n\nNor was Rossetti, though he may have chafed often enough at the criticisms lavished upon his work and methods, a backward or half-hearted friend. He speaks in a family letter of Ruskin as the best friend, with one or two exceptions, that he had ever made, and up to the limits of his capricious nature he evidently took genuine pains to please him. The fact of the intimacy lasting a full eight years proves this. It came to an end gradually and without any open disagreement, from the purely natural circumstance that Rossetti was developing upon his own lines and had too much independence to subject his genius permanently to the fixed ideas of any critic, however eminent. 1 Other causes as well may have helped to determine the inevitable. Marriage, especially in the case of self-absorbed natures, is an effectual solvent of old ties; and in addition to marriage Rossetti had his constant anxiety for his wife's health to occupy him. So it came about that the two fell apart, and whether we should count it loss or gain we cannot entirely tell, saving as a matter of sentiment. The long duration of the intercourse, and its closeness for so many years, are points to be borne in mind in judging of Rossetti's character; for an unfair impression of him might easily be got from the Ruskin letters, which, besides revealing only one side of the correspondence, are so scattered in date as to convey a false idea of the length of time they cover, and by consequence a false idea of the rapidity of the dénoûment.\n\nBefore passing from the subject of Ruskin it is interesting to note that he enlisted Rossetti as an active helper in the scheme promoted by Frederick Denison Maurice for bringing art into the East end.\n\nIn Rossetti's “Letters to William Allingham,” edited by Dr. Birkbeck Hill, this episode in the painter's life is referred to many times:\n\nOctober 15 th, 1854. “Ruskin is back. . . . He has written to me saying he wants to consult with me about plans for ‘teaching the masons’; so you may soon expect to find every man shoulder his hod, ‘with upturned fervid face and hair put back.’”\n\nNovember.“Perhaps you know that he [Ruskin] has joined Maurice's scheme for a Working Men's College, which has now begun to be put in operation at 31, Red Lion Square. Ruskin has most liberally undertaken a drawing class, which he attends every Thursday evening. . . . He is most enthusiastic about it, and has so infected me that I think of offering an evening weekly for the same purpose when I am settled in town again.”\n\nJanuary 23 rd, 1855.“I began my class last night at the Working Men's College: it is for the figure, quite a separate thing from Ruskin's, who teaches foliage. I have set one of them as a model to the rest till they can find themselves another model . . . some of them, two or three, show unmistakable aptitute—almost more than one could ever have hoped for.”\n\nHer life, so much as we know of it, was passive and singularly free from adventure. Wrapped up in Rossetti, as he was in her, she varied the monotony of her confined existence by occasional changes of air at Hastings, Matlock, Bath, or Clevedon in Somersetshire, with one longer trip abroad in the winter and early spring of 1855-6. During the intervals she worked in Rossetti's studio at Chatham Place, Blackfriars, or sat to him for endless studies, concerning which Madox Brown's diary of 1855 contains the following passage: “He (Rossetti) showed me a drawer full of ‘Guggums’; God knows how many, but not bad work I should say for the six years he has known her. It is like a monomania with him. Many of them are matchless in beauty, however, and one day will be worth large sums.”\n\nIn 1860 Rossetti and Miss Siddal carried out their long projected plans of matrimony, which had been delayed by uncertain prospects, and perhaps also by a final want of resolution on Rossetti's part. In a private letter to his mother, dated Hastings, April 13, 1860, he says:\n\n“I write this word to say that Lizzy and I are going to be married at last, in as few days as possible. . . . Like all the important things I ever meant to do—to fulfil duty or secure happiness—this one has been deferred almost beyond possibility. I have hardly deserved that Lizzy should still consent to it, but she has done so, and I trust I may still have time to prove my thankfulness to her. . . . The constantly failing state of her health is a terrible anxiety indeed; but I must still hope for the best, and am at any rate in a better position to take the step, as regards money prospects, than I have ever been before.”\n\npage: [60bverso]\n\nNote: blank page\n\npage: 61\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nWORK FROM 1854 TO 1857\n\npage: 65\n\nSig. K\n\nIn 1856 were completed the water-colours of Dante's Dream and Fra Pace ; the former for Miss Heaton, the latter for anyone who would buy it,—Ruskin, who had the first offer, having pronounced it to be “very ingenious and wonderful, but not my sort of drawing.” Mr. William Morris, who, as we shall presently see, acquired several early water-colours by Rossetti, was apparently the first purchaser of Fra Pace , which later on found its way into the great Graham collection, and is now in the possession of Mrs. Jekyll, one of Mr. William Graham's daughters. It represents, as the plate will show, a kneeling monk busy illuminating at a desk. He is copying a dead mouse, and has worked so long and with such preoccupation that the cat has coiled itself up asleep upon his trailing robe. A youthful acolyte is tickling it with a straw in order to beguile the tedium of the long silence. The drawing is somewhat archaic in character and stiff in design—based upon Memling, some have said; but it is eminently characteristic of Rossetti, full of quaint conceits and devices, from the row of little bottles that hold the good man's pigments to the split pomegranate that lies uneaten by his side. From the amount of humour it contains Rossetti must evidently have enjoyed doing it.\n\nOf the same date as Dante's Dream is a pen-and-ink design belonging to Mr. Arthur Hughes, which represents Faust and Margaret in the prison. 1 Mephistopheles is coming down the steps, urging the pair to make haste. At the very close of his life Rossetti essayed to paint an important picture, dealing with the incident of the jewel-casket, to be called Gretchen , or Risen at Dawn . Particulars as to this will be found in Chapter IX.\n\npage: 74\n\nIn March, 1856, Rossetti secured an important commission— judged by the standard of his current work and prices—to paint a reredos in three compartments for the cathedral of Llandaff, which John P. Seddon was engaged in restoring. The matter had been broached a year earlier, when Madox Brown had felt a momentary annoyance at being passed over himself and asked to recommend Rossetti. This did not deter him from pushing his friend's interests, and through the influence of Mr. Bruce, M.P., afterwards Lord Aberdare, and the Seddons, Rossetti got the commission at his own price, viz., £400 for the triple picture—“a big thing,” as he wrote, “which I shall go into with a howl of delight after all my small work.” The subject he chose for this undertaking was The Seed of David , showing in the centre-piece the infant Christ on his mother's knee being adored by a shepherd and a king, and on either side a single figure of David, first as a shepherd-boy slinging the stone for Goliath, and secondly as a king harping to the glory of God. In this year the Llandaff triptych got no further than a set of water-colour designs, which for a long time have been in the possession of Rossetti's early friend Vernon (now Mr. Justice) Lushington. Even they were probably not all completed until later, as several earlier studies [study 1] [study 2] [study 3] [study 4] [study 5] were made, of which some were sold after Rossetti's death, and are to be found in the possession of Mr. J. W. Thompson, of Walcot, Stalham. Mr. Fairfax Murray also has one or more. The painting was started about 1858, and was evidently much discussed with Ruskin, who wished Rossetti to use for the face of the Virgin the handsome features of Miss Herbert, an actress whose acquaintance he had just then made, and who sat to him more than once. In 1857, however, Rossetti had met Miss Burden, afterwards Mrs. Morris, and it is her face which appears in the picture. The colouring and the work in general is not unlike that of the early Adoration by Burne-Jones , which was painted about the same time, under the strong influence of Rossetti, and which will be remembered at the Winter Exhibition of the New Gallery, 1898-9. In this picture also Mrs. Morris sat for the Virgin, and William Morris and Swinburne are recognizable among the group of worshippers. The triptych was not completely finished until 1864, and after that was considerably retouched in 1869, when Rossetti went down to Llandaff for the purpose.\n\nThe year 1856 (or, if we take the date of publication, 1857) deserves commemoration apart from these annals as the year of the famous Moxon “Tennyson”, for which Rossetti designed no fewer than five illustrations. The first mention we have of the matter is in a letter from Rossetti himself to Allingham, dated January 23, 1855, in which he says:\n\n“The other day Moxon called on me, wanting me to do some of the blocks for the new Tennyson. The artists already engaged are Millais, Hunt, Landseer, Stanfield, Maclise, Creswick, Mulready, and Horsley. The right names would have been Millais, Hunt, Madox Brown, Hughes, a certain lady, and myself. NO OTHERS. . . . Each artist, it seems, is to do about half-a-dozen; but I hardly expect to manage so many, as I find the work of drawing on wood particularly trying to the eyes. I have not begun even designing for them yet, but fancy I shall try the‘Vision of Sin’, and‘Palace of Art’, etc.—those where one can allegorize on one's own hook, without killing for oneself and everyone a distinct idea of the poet's.”\n\nFor these Tennyson designs, according to Mr. W. M. Rossetti, his brother got £15 each. 1Separate pen-and-ink drawings [drawing 1] [drawing 2] [drawing 3] [drawing 4] exist for most, if not for all of them, 2 and water-colours were afterwards painted from three: St. Cecily (1857), described by a well-known writer as glowing “with such a glow of gold and amethyst as sometimes burns upon the sunset Atlantic”; Sir Galahad in the Chapel (1859), formerly in Mr. James Leathart's collection, and now in the Corporation Gallery at Birmingham; Mariana (1862)—not to be confused with an oil Mariana of later date, named direct from the lady in “Measure for Measure.” The water-colour belongs to Mr. George Rae, and is also known by the title Heart of the Night .\n\nAbout 1857 was designed a drawing in crayons of St. Luke the Painter , for which the artist composed the fine sonnet beginning:\n\n“Give honour unto Luke Evangelist;\n\nFor he it was (the aged legends say)\n\nWho first taught Art to fold her hands and pray.”\n\nThis sonnet was afterwards included in the “House of Life” series, under “Old and New Art”, as No. LXXIV. It is an interesting enunciation of “Pre-Raphaelite” principles.\n\nIn point of number and interest the productions of 1857 are remarkable. It was the year of the Oxford frescoes, for one thing, though these dragged on till 1859; and it was the year of a charming little series of water-colours, which were acquired one after the other by Rossetti's newly-made acquaintance, William Morris, who, some time later, being in want of capital for his own business, sold them in a batch to their present possessor, Mr. Rae. These comprise—to leave the frescoes until later:\n\n(1) The Damsel of the Sanc Grael , robed in green, holding a long-stemmed cup in her hand, and with the holy dove above her bearing a censer in its beak. Many years later, in 1874, Rossetti painted an oil version of the same subject for Mr. Rae, in which he modernized, and many will think spoilt, the archaic simplicity of the design. As both versions are reproduced in this book, readers will be able to form their own opinions on the point, though they will miss in the one case the primitive charm of the fresh green colour, and in the other the sumptuous and heavy richness of the painting.\n\n(2) The Death of Breuse sans Pitié , one of the crudest and least successful of all Rossetti's water-colours. The terribly realistic encounter of two knights struggling in the foreground, and the grimness of the scene behind, where a dead man is hanging contorted on a tree while a lady waits beside him with a halter round her neck, has a repulsive and unpleasant effect. The composition, moreover, is grotesque and strained, and the painting (although Rossetti worked on it later) unsatisfactory.\n\n(4) The Tune of Seven Towers , a quaint little scene, very characteristic of Rossetti's fertility and originality of invention. A lady in red with mediæval head-dress is sitting in a high oaken chair, which above towers up into a sort of belfry, and is playing upon a musical instrument which also forms part of the chair. A man in green doublet, with long boots, sits sideways on a stool close by watching her, and a second lady stands mournfully behind. In an alcove at the back a maid is seen reaching through a little window to place an orange branch upon a bed. A banner hangs down at the right from a pole which cuts the picture diagonally in half, and which ends in a socket beside the oaken chair.\n\n(5) The Blue Closet , the gem of the collection for beauty of colour, represents two queens, the one on the left in red with green sleeves, and the one on the right in crimson and grey, playing upon opposite sides of a carved and inlaid dulcimer or clavichord. Two other ladies stand behind them singing. Above their heads the wall is tiled with blue, and so likewise is the floor, suggesting the title of the picture. Strong blue touches upon an escutcheon at the back carry the thought still further.\n\nWilliam Morris, with whom the last two pictures were especial favourites, used their romantic and sweet-sounding titles as themes to base two poems on; and this has led to a confused idea that the pictures illustrate the poems. In reality they have nothing in common but their names, and for these the painter, not the poet, was responsible. In Mr. Rae's catalogue the poems are quoted.\n\nA sixth subject acquired in the same manner as the others, and at the same time, by Mr. Rae, was the early water-colour triptych of Paolo and Francesca , which used to belong to Mr. Ruskin and has already been mentioned ( see page 66).\n\nIn the Christmas vacation of 1855 Burne-Jones came up to London, and after attending a meeting of the Working Men's College in order to see Rossetti, whom he and Morris had already begun to worship, he was introduced to him at Vernon Lushington's rooms in Doctors' Commons. The next day he visited Rossetti in his studio at Blackfriars, and saw him working on Fra Pace . Thus was laid the foundation of an alliance that even more potently than the “P.R.B.” has changed the face of art in England—an alliance which consolidated the principal factors that were working in the field of reform, and resulted in the formation of a group which for combined poetic, literary, and artistic power is unapproached in the history of the nation. Incidentally, it was this visit that determined Burne-Jones—hankering after art but predestined for the Church—to become a painter; and no one can fail to be struck with the evidence of Rossetti's influence upon his early work.\n\npage: [84bverso]\n\nNote: blank page\n\npage: 85\n\nThe ménage at Red Lion Square lasted till 1859, and was a sort of rallying point for all members of the circle. “From the incidents that occurred or were invented there,” says Mr. Mackail, “a sort of Book of the Hundred Merry Tales gradually was formed, of which Morris was the central figure. A great many of these stories are connected with the maid of the house, who became famous under the name of Red Lion Mary. She was very plain, but a person of great character and unfailing good-humour, with some literary taste and a considerable knowledge of poetry. She cooked and mended for the new lodgers, read their books and letters, was anxious to be allowed to act as a model, and neglected all her other duties to stand behind them and watch them painting.” 1\n\nTranscribed Footnote (page 85):\n\n1 The following story, stripped of some absurd and unlikely details about rolling\n\npage: 86\n\nThe Red House, on which so much love and labour had been spent, was abandoned in 1865, owing to the exigencies of Morris's rapidly growing business, and at the break-up the Dante and Beatrice panels were removed from their cabinet and sold. They came into the possession of Sir Frederick Burton, the late Director of the National Gallery, from whom they were afterwards acquired by Mr. Leathart. At the sale of the latter's pictures in 1896 they were bought by Mr. F. J. Tennant, of North Berwick, in whose possession they doubtless remain. One is dated, “June 15-25, 1859,” and the other has the year merely.\n\nBesides the Dante and Beatrice panels, Rossetti painted on the backs of two armchairs, either at Red Lion Square or at the Red House, subjects from Morris's own poems, one representing Gwendolen in the Witch-tower , with the Prince below kissing her long golden hair, and another The Arming of a Knight , from the Christmas Mystery of “Sir Galahad”. These chairs are now in the possession of a member of the Morris family, and, so far as I know, they have never been mentioned in a list of Rossetti's works before. They and the Dante panels are particularly interesting as being painted by Rossetti's own hand, which was not the case with the designs executed a year or two later (1861 and 1862) for the firm of Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co., of which he was one of the original co-partners.\n\nConfirmatory evidence of the beauty of the designs at the time when they were first executed is to be found in a notice by Mr. Coventry Patmore, dated December 26, 1857, which speaks of the colour as “sweet, bright, and pure as a cloud in the sunrise,” and “so brilliant as to make the walls look like the margin of an illuminated manuscript.”\n\npage: [94averso]\n\nNote: blank page\n\npage: 95\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nWORK FROM 1858 TO 1862\n\nIn addition to this description Rossetti wrote a sonnet for the picture, which is found in his first volume, called Poems. The first eight lines are addressed by the lover to Mary, seeking to dissuade her from entering the house, and the sestett is her reply:\n\n“Oh loose me! See'st thou not my Bridegroom's face\n\nThat draws me to Him? For His feet my kiss,\n\nMy hair, my tears He craves to-day:—and oh!\n\nWhat words can tell what other day and place\n\nShall see me clasp those blood-stained feet of His?\n\nHe needs me, calls me, loves me: let me go!”\n\nThis drawing of Mary Magdalene with her many companions was not the first finished version done, for Rossetti mentions in one of his letters an earlier “single figure of Mary leaving the house of feasting, ” which had been noticed in the “North Atlantic Monthly.” Whether this exists or not I am unaware. The big drawing itself has had a chequered history. It was originally acquired by Mr. Plint, but did not figure in his sale. Subsequently it vanished for some years, and was re-discovered not long since in a shop in Brompton Road. It is now in the possession of Mr. Charles Ricketts, the artist.\n\nAn enlarged circular drawing of the head of Christ in mixed oil and water-colour was done in 1859, and belonged for some years to Mr. Moncure D. Conway, who exhibited it at the Burlington Fine Arts Club in 1883. He has since sold it.\n\nAnother subject finished in 1858, though in hand as already mentioned a year or two earlier, was Mary in the House of John . The scene is at late twilight, or in an eastern night, the red glow of the sky casting a purple light over the clustered dwellings of Nazareth, with deep blue hills beyond. In the interior of the room are Mary and St. John, the latter seated in shadow, engaged in striking light from a flint; whilst Mary, standing before the tall window, the framework of which resembles a cross, fills a hanging lamp from a long red jar of oil. The suggestion for this—as for more than one other of his pictures of the Virgin—is to be found in Rossetti's poem of “Ave”. I quote the special passage:\n\n“Mind'st thou not (when the twilight gone\n\nLeft darkness in the house of John)\n\nBetween the naked window-bars\n\nThat spacious vigil of the stars?—\n\nFor thou, a watcher even as they,\n\nWould'st rise from where throughout the day\n\nThou wroughtest raiment for His poor;\n\nAnd finding the fixed terms endure\n\nOf day and night which never brought\n\nSounds of His coming chariot,\n\nWould'st lift through cloud-waste unexplored\n\nThose eyes which said, ‘How long, O Lord?’”\n\nThe next drawing to be chronicled is one called Golden Water , or The Princess Parisadé , a subject taken from “The Arabian Nights.” This probably belonged once to Mr. Ruskin, and is now in the possession of Mrs. Constance Churchill. The Princess, a sort of Cinderella, is seen descending from the mountain, with the singing tree behind her and over her head the talking bird. In her arms she bears the barrel of golden water.\n\npage: [100bverso]\n\nNote: blank page\n\npage: 101\n\nThe last and most important item of this year, completed about November, is a highly-finished little head in oils, called Bocca Baciata , which came into the possession of Mr. Boyce. The model for this—or rather the sitter, for it is simply a portrait framed in marigolds—was Miss Fanny Cornforth, afterwards Mrs. Schott, who has already been mentioned as the model for Found , and whose florid type of beauty reappears in a series of sensuous pictures of the kind that Rossetti began to paint after 1862— Aurelia (Fazio's Mistress) , The Blue Bower , The Lady at her Toilet , Lilith , and The Lady of the Fan . These pictures, and numerous portraits in oil and water-colour, of which there is a typical one dated 1862 in the possession of Mr. Rae, give a sufficiently recognizable idea of this model, who exercised almost as remarkable an influence over Rossetti's life as over his art. “She was pre-eminently a fine woman,” says Mr. William Rossetti, who was in a position to judge, “with regular and sweet features, and a mass of the most lovely blonde hair—light-golden or harvest yellow. ” Her régime, however, came at a later period than the one we are discussing, and does not concern us here. The title of Bocca Baciata is taken from some lines in a sonnet by Boccaccio: “Bocca baciata non perde ventura, anzi rinuova come fa la Luna ”—the mouth that has been kissed loses not its freshness; still it renews itself even as does the moon. The portrait is full-face, perhaps a little faded in colour, with lips of a purplish crimson, and bright reddish-gold hair. The flesh under-tints are very green, but the modelling is like a miniature, as fine and delicate as anything by a Dutch or Flemish master. It was exhibited at the old Hogarth Club, and later at Burlington House in 1883. At the sale of Mr. Boyce's pictures this much esteemed work was acquired by Mr. Fairfax Murray. Rossetti painted several heads later after much the same pattern as Bocca Baciata , of which two, a Regina Cordium done for the late Mr. Trist, of Brighton, and a water-colour of 1868 called Bionda del Balcone , may be regarded as inferior replicas.\n\nThe connection of this subject with the painter, Bonifazio (or Fazio) degli Uberti, even if intended, is entirely fanciful. There can be little doubt—in fact a letter from Rossetti to Mr. Boyce, quoted in the “Hobby Horse,” says as much—that it was intended to illustrate Rossetti's own story of “St. Agnes of Intercession”. When this story was to appear in “ The Germ,” Rossetti began to do an etching for it, which turned out a failure. Millais then, in a hurry, did another to replace it, which was never used, because “ The Germ” came to an end and the story was not published. A couple of proofs from Millais's plate (one of which I have seen) remain to show the incident illustrated, which is taken from the end of the tale, where the lady to whom the hero is affianced suddenly falls back and dies as he is painting her, thereby fulfilling a sort of destiny enjoined by the like tragedy which had happened in a previous state of existence. In addition to the water-colour, Mr. Murray has allowed me to reproduce an earlier pen-and-ink sketch , which has not been published before.\n\nBonifazio's Mistress has no connection whatever either in subject or composition with the oil painting done for Mr. Blackmore in 1863 (now Mr. Rae's), and afterwards re-named Aurelia . The latter is simply a three-quarter length figure of a lady plaiting her hair before a toilet glass.\n\npage: [104averso]\n\nNote: blank page\n\npage: 105\n\nSig. P\n\nAmongst other less known compositions Rossetti is one belonging to this year, of Joseph accused by Potiphar's wife , a finished pen-and-ink drawing which used to belong to Mr. Anderson Rose, and which a note on the back states was acquired by him at Rossetti's studio on a certain date, “at 3 o'clock in the morning.” The Egyptian “local colour ” in this design is strongly marked, and it is altogether a pleasant little work. It has not been mentioned in any previous list or record, though it appeared at the Burlington Club in 1883, and figures in the catalogue of Mr. Anderson Rose's sale. It now belongs to Mr. Fairfax Murray.\n\nThe pity is great that Rossetti never had an opportunity to paint the picture for which this was merely a preliminary design. Mr. Leyland and Mr. Rae both had the offer of it, but at a very high figure (£2,100, I believe), and it was never commenced. Rossetti, at the date when these offers were made, had begun to paint the deeply imaginative or sumptuous single figures which proved so acceptable to his later patrons, and he could not thenceforward find time or encouragement or money to carry out elaborate subjects. The one exception, almost, to this rule is the great picture of Dante's Dream , the disposal of which (on account of its size) gave the painter an infinite amount of anxiety and trouble.\n\nAbout this time (1861-1862) the firm of Morris, Marshall, Faulkner and Co. was just being started, with William Morris, Rossetti, Faulkner, Burne-Jones, Madox Brown, Webb, and others as the active promoters of a venture which was to reform the arts of decoration and furniture making. The notion of a trading company, at that date a most unheard-of and revolutionary one, was due in large measure, Mr. Mackail says, to Madox Brown, “but perhaps even more to Rossetti, who, poet and idealist as he was, had business qualities of a high order and the eye of a trained financier for anything that had money in it.” Tapestry, furniture, wall-papers, stained glass, painted panels, and later on carpet weaving and dyeing, were among the industries to which this band of highly original artists and designers turned their attention, the principle on which they went being that each member should be paid individually for the work commissioned by the firm, and that profits should be divided in a proper ratio at the end.\n\nThe Anglo-Catholic movement and the demand for decoration and ritual of an æsthetic and sensuous kind gave the new firm plenty to do, amongst their first commissions being the embellishment of two new churches then being built by Bodley, St. Martin's on the Hill, Scarborough, and St. Michael's at Brighton. For the former Rossetti executed a design for two pulpit panels and several windows, achieving from the very first a mastery over this branch of art which few designers have ever surpassed. It is characteristic of his original mind that he went right back to the fundamental principles of vitraux, paying no attention whatever to the elaborations which had grown round them, and recognizing that a picture which was transparent, that is, seen by transmitted light, must be conceived in flat tones and not made to give the illusion of shading, as can be done in the case of a surface from which the light is reflected. The following are the designs by Rossetti done for St. Martin's, and to be seen there now.\n\nAdam and Eve before the Fall . Two windows for the west end, representing in one compartment Adam leaning upon a branch of a leafy tree and with his foot tickling a small brown bear that curls itself upon the ground. A squirrel watches him from above. In the other Eve is seen standing in a richly flowered field, her long fair hair falling unbound about her shoulders. She presses a white dove to her bosom, and in the tree above her a solemn owl is perched. Both figures are nude, with a rosy glow of flesh-colour, broken up by the graceful veiling of thick green foliage.\n\nThe Parable of the Vineyard . Seven designs for a window in the choir, of which M. Olivier Georges Destrée, one of the most appreciative critics of Rossetti, writes that it produces “an impression of colour, dazzling and magnificent, velvety and harmonious, resembling the Flemish stained glass windows decorating the Gothic cathedrals.” The central compartment of the window represents The Crucifixion , and round it are grouped the different incidents of the parable, the planting of the vine, the letting it out to husbandmen , the stoning of the servants , the feast of the vintage , the arrival of the young heir against whom the husbandmen are plotting, and, lastly, their judgment and condemnation by the master. The designs for the Parable of the Vineyard were at one time in the possession of Mr. Leyland, it is believed, and later came into the hands of Mr. McConnel, whose effects were sold at Manchester about 1870. I have not ascertained who has them now.\n\nTo the same category of work designed for Morris and Co., and executed by them during 1861 or 1862, may be added the following:\n\nThe Last Judgment . Nine designs in a circle for stained glass, of which the originals, formerly in Rossetti's possession, were bought after his death by a Mr. Brough.\n\nKing René's Honeymoon . This was a design for a panel, one of four representing the arts, done for the famous Gothic cabinet which Mr. J. P. Seddon had built by Morris and Co. to hold his architectural drawings. The history of this cabinet has recently been written by Mr. Seddon himself, and is published by Batsford, with separate illustrations of the various panels designed by Rossetti, Madox Brown, Burne-Jones, and others. Rossetti's subject was “Music,” in which the amiable and enlightened King of Sicily is seen leaning over a species of chamber-organ, on which his bride is playing, to kiss her. Rossetti also designed one of the minor panels, representing “Gardening.” The water-colour sketch for this, whether done at the time in colours or painted over the design afterwards, got the title of Spring , and as such is catalogued among Rossetti's works, mostly under the year 1864. A pen-and-ink drawing of the subject —a girl cutting blossoms from a tree—formerly belonged to Mr. H. V. Tebbs, but was sold by him to Mr. Murray. The whole question of dates, regarding this cabinet, has been somewhat mysterious. Mr. Sharp in his list gives “ King René's Honeymoon : oil: 1850,” which is of course impossible. The painting in oil was not done by Rossetti, and the Morris firm was not thought of in 1850. Mr. J. P. Anderson, in Mr. Knight's little book, gives the date as 1856-7, which is not much better; and even Mr. W. M. Rossetti has not corrected the mistake. Somewhere or other the water-colour design for King René's Honeymoon should exist, unless it has perished. A replica of it was painted in oil a year or two later for Mr. Trist, of Brighton, amongst whose pictures it figured in the sale of 1892.\n\nAmor, Amans, Amata . These are three small figures in ovals, designed for the back of a sofa which Rossetti had made for himself, and which for many years stood in his house at Chelsea. The sofa, which has also six little circular heads in brown on gold along the front, belongs now to Mr. Murray.\n\nKing René's Honeymoon . Another subject from the story of the Sicilian king (or perhaps the same), done for a series of stained glass windows in Mr. Birket Foster's house. The drawing in ink, which I have not seen, belongs to Mr. A. S. Stevenson, and was exhibited at the Burlington Fine Arts Club in 1883.\n\nThe Annunciation . This is a design for a window, and is different again from any versions of the subject previously mentioned. The cartoon for it is in the possession of Mr. Watts-Dunton.\n\nJoseph and Mary at the house of St. Elisabeth ; St. Margaret ; and An Angel swinging a censer . These are three other windows of which the cartoons are in Mr. Watts-Dunton's possession, and there may possibly be more.\n\nThreshing . A design for a tile, presumably one of a series, the original sepia sketch for which was acquired by Colonel Gillum at Rossetti's sale.\n\nThe remainder of Rossetti's work in applied art, unless other unrecorded examples exist, comprise a memorial window in Christ Church, Albany Street, representing the Sermon on the Mount , erected in 1869 to the memory of Rossetti's aunt, Miss Polidori, who died in 1867; and a bright little water-colour drawing for a window representing Christ Crowned , with a regal globe in his hand, and above and below two pairs of winged angels. This was formerly in the possession of Mr. Trist, and now belongs to Mr. Murray. It may or may not be the same as a Christ in Glory (“sketch for stained glass”), sold to Mr. William Graham in 1873, but its date of course is much earlier than that. For convenience I have catalogued it under 1862.\n\nTranscribed Footnote (page 115):\n\n1 There is a letter from Mr. Frederick Shields to Rossetti referring to the water-colour in Mr. McConnel's possession, and saying: “I agree with you in regarding it as one of your finest”—or words to that effect.\n\npage: 116\n\nThe Paolo and Francesca water-colour done for Mr. William Graham I have included under the date 1861, although no particular authority exists for this beyond the auctioneer's catalogue. In the catalogue of the Burlington Fine Arts Club it was given as 1854, which would ante-date by a year the original diptych painted for Mr. Ruskin and now in the possession of Mr. Rae ( see page 66). There is a possibility, borne out to some extent by internal evidence, that this may have been an early sketch not used at the time, but taken up later and finished off to sell. The paper on which it is painted has been added to on all four sides for the purpose of extending the composition. Traces of this patching are plainly visible in the reproduction, especially at the bottom and across the window. In its original form, therefore, the drawing would have included the pair of lovers and practically nothing else.\n\nThis beautiful and luminous little water-colour represents, as I have described already, the first compartment of the double subject. In the other half of the complete picture the souls of the lovers are shown "
