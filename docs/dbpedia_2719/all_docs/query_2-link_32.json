        "text": "Williams History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nGermany\n\nWales\n\nIreland\n\nThe Welsh name Williams is a patronymic surname derived from the personal name William, which is in turn derived from the Old German names Willihelm and Willelm (the Norman French version was Guillaume). Following the Norman Conquest of 1066, William became the most popular personal name in Britain for a time.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Williams family\n\nThe surname Williams was first found in Breconshire and Monmouthshire on the English/Welsh border, where they are traditionally believed to be descended from Brychan Brecheiniog who was Lord of Brecknock at the time of King Arthur of the Round Table.\n\nThe mediaeval seat of the ancestors of the Williams family was at Llangibby Castle in County Monmouth. More recently, the family is descended through Rhys Goch, the red haired Lord Ystradyw from Caradog Vreichvras.\n\nOne of the first records of the name was listed as Robertus filius Willelmi 1 which was listed in the Domesday Book. 2 Other early records include Richard Williams who was listed in the Hundredorum Rolls of 1279 and John Wylyam who was listed in the Subsidy Rolls of Sussex in 1296.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Williams family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Williams research. Another 134 words (10 lines of text) covering the years 1500, 1604, 1621, 1623, 1635, 1636, 1641, 1656, 1660, 1661, 1666, 1668, 1675, 1679, 1683, 1688, 1689, 1692, 1696, 1712, 1739, 1846 and 1890 are included under the topic Early Williams History in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nWilliams Spelling Variations\n\nWelsh surnames are relatively few in number, but they have an inordinately large number of spelling variations. There are many factors that explain the preponderance of Welsh variants, but the earliest is found during the Middle Ages when Welsh surnames came into use. Scribes and church officials recorded names as they sounded, which often resulted in a single person's name being inconsistently recorded over his lifetime. The transliteration of Welsh names into English also accounts for many of the spelling variations: the unique Brythonic Celtic language of the Welsh had many sounds the English language was incapable of accurately reproducing. It was also common for members of a same surname to change their names slightly, in order to signify a branch loyalty within the family, a religious adherence, or even patriotic affiliations. For all of these reasons, the many spelling variations of particular Welsh names are very important. The surname Williams has occasionally been spelled Williams, Quilliams, Guilliam, Guilliams and others.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Notables of the Williams family\n\nProminent amongst the family during the late Middle Ages was\n\nRoger Williams (c.1604-1683), English-born, American clergyman, founder of the colony of Providence Plantation in 1636\n\nSir Henry Williams, 2nd Baronet (c. 1635-1666), a Welsh politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1660 to 1661\n\nJohn Williams, Archbishop of York in 1641\n\nNathaniel Williams (1656-c.1679), a Welsh writer from Swansea\n\nSir Trevor Williams, 1st Baronet (c. 1623-1692) of Llangibby, Monmouthshire, Welsh gentry landowner and politician\n\nSir William Williams, 6th Baronet (c.1668-1696), a Welsh politician, Member of Parliament for Caernarvonshire (1689-1696), Vice-Admiral of North Wales (1688-1696)\n\nWilliam Williams of Connecticut, signer of the American Declaration of Independence\n\nWilliams World Ranking\n\nIn the United States, the name Williams is the 3rd most popular surname with an estimated 1,738,413 people with that name. 3 However, in Canada, the name Williams is ranked the 17th most popular surname with an estimated 63,729 people with that name. 4 And in Quebec, Canada, the name Williams is the 544th popular surname. 5 Newfoundland, Canada ranks Williams as 27th with 705 people. 6 France ranks Williams as 6,400th with 1,000 - 1,500 people. 7 Australia ranks Williams as 3rd with 105,855 people. 8 New Zealand ranks Williams as 2nd with 8,814 people. 9 The United Kingdom ranks Williams as 23rd with 115,923 people. 10 South Africa ranks Williams as 34th with 106,885 people. 11\n\nMigration of the Williams family to Ireland\n\nSome of the Williams family moved to Ireland, but this topic is not covered in this excerpt.\n\nAnother 87 words (6 lines of text) about their life in Ireland is included in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nWilliams migration to the United States +\n\nThe Welsh migration to North America in the late 19th and early 20th centuries contributed greatly to its rapid development.

The British continued to expand the settlements including setting the First Federation in the British West Indies by 1674; some of the islands include Barbados, Bermuda, Cayman Island, Turks and Caicos, Jamaica and Belize then known as British Honduras. By the 1960's many of the islands became independent after the West Indies Federation which existed from 1958 to 1962 failed due to internal political conflicts. After this a number of Eastern Caribbean islands formed a free association. 22\n\nWilliams Settlers in West Indies in the 17th Century\n\nMr. John Williams, aged 21, British settler travelling from Gravesend, UK aboard the ship \"Hopewell\" arriving in Barbados on 17th February 1634 13\n\nMr. Owen Williams, (b. 1600), aged 34, British settler travelling from Gravesend, UK aboard the ship \"Hopewell\" arriving in Barbados on 17th February 1634 13\n\nMr. Richard Williams, Cornish settler from St Columb, Cornwall, (b. 1604), aged 30, British settler travelling from Plymouth, England aboard the ship \"Margarett\" arriving in St Christopher (Saint Kitts) on 1st March 1634 23\n\nMr. Teage Williams, Irish settler from Ireland, (b. 1616), aged 18, British settler travelling from Plymouth, England aboard the ship \"Margarett\" arriving in St Christopher (Saint Kitts) on 1st March 1634 23\n\nMr. Davie Williams, (b. 1618), aged 17, British settler travelling from London, England aboard the ship \"Anne and Elizabeth\" arriving in Barbados in 1635 24\n\n...

Mottoes first began to be shown with arms in the 14th and 15th centuries, but were not in general use until the 17th century. Thus the oldest coats of arms generally do not include a motto. Mottoes seldom form part of the grant of arms: Under most heraldic authorities, a motto is an optional component of the coat of arms, and can be added to or changed at will; many families have chosen not to display a motto.\n\nMotto: Ensuivant la verite\n\nMotto Translation: By following the truth.\n\nSuggested Readings for the name Williams +\n\nThe Ancestors and Descendants of Ebenezer and Martha Porter Williams of Painesville, Ohio by Percy Williams Lewis.\n\nThe Ancestor; The World of William Williams by John Francis Williams.\n\nDiamonds in the Desert: The Family History of Bill and Gertie Williams by Billie William Yost.\n\nCitations +\n\nReaney, P.H and R.M.
