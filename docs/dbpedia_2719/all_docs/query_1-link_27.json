        "text": "We forget so much. All those memories of great meals, travel, landscapes, conversations, insights, theater, and scenes in distant cities, moments you swore you’d remember forever, so many washed away like Etch A Sketch drawings.\n\n– Anne Lamott\n\nThe Zen way of teaching teaches one to see that you cannot be in complete control of your whole life situation. You cannot, in other words, fundamentally possess yourself.\n\n– Alan Watts\n\nFor a lifetime I was\n\nunable to say my heart’s desire\n\nAnd the beloved never understood\n\nwhat this silence was.\n\n– Nida Fazli\n\nthe CEO’s / primary rival / is sleep\n\n– Alec Finlay\n\nOut of the silence of centuries, discrete words will, one day, surface for us and then for those who have gradually learned to read us in the void. Our book is for tomorrow.\n\n– Edmond Jabès, (tr. Rosmarie Waldrop)\n\nPowers of the deeper world move among us. Call them gods or daimons, ancestors or archetypes. Most of the time we are unaware of their presence. When they are in the field – noticed or invisible, invoked or uninvoked – their presence has a shimmer effect on the ordinary world. The fabric of physical reality in their vicinity becomes fluid and unstable. We experience the shift as synchronicity or anomaly. If we become alert to the shimmer effect, and make the right moves in that moment, we can help manifest extraordinary things.\n\n– Robert Moss\n\nThe irony is that we attempt to disown our difficult stories to appear more whole or more acceptable, but our wholeness – even our wholeheartedness – actually depends on the integration of all of our experiences, including the falls.\n\n– Brené Brown\n\nThe dancer’s body is simply the luminous manifestation of the soul. The true dance is an expression of serenity; it is controlled by the profound rhythm of inner emotion. Emotion does not reach the moment of frenzy out of a spurt of action; it broods first, it sleeps like the life in the seed, and it unfolds with a gentle slowness. The Greeks understood the continuing beauty of a movement that mounted, that spread, that ended with a promise of rebirth.\n\n– Isadora Duncan\n\nDividing earth and sky\n\nis not the right way\n\nto think about this wholeness.\n\nIt only allows one to live\n\nat a more precise address–\n\nwere I to be searched for\n\nI’d be found much faster.\n\nMy distinguishing marks\n\nare rapture and despair.\n\n– Wislawa Szymborska\n\nTo be blessed\n\nsaid the old woman\n\nis to live and work\n\nso hard\n\nGod’s love\n\nwashes right through you\n\nlike milk through a cow\n\nTo be blessed\n\nsaid the dark red tulip\n\nis to knock their eyes out\n\nwith the slug of lust\n\nimplied by\n\nyour up-ended skirt\n\nTo be blessed\n\nsaid the dog\n\nis to have a pinch\n\nof God\n\ninside you\n\nand all the other\n\ndogs can smell it\n\n– alicia ostriker\n\nRecovery cannot be pigeonholed in one genre category: poetry and prose, autobiography and theory, fiction and nonfiction, for instance, are labels that are not only challenged and deconstructed, but that rapidly prove utterly irrelevant. What comes instead to the fore is a kind of linguistic and performative “flicker,” with rhythm and kinetics as its key features.\n\n– Jan Baetens\n\nThere was a silly damn bird called a Phoenix back before Christ, every few hundred years he built a pyre and burnt himself up. He must have been the first cousin to Man. But every time he burnt himself up he sprang out of the ashes, he got himself born all over again. And it looks like we’re doing the same thing, over and over, but we’ve got one damn thing the Phoenix never had. We know the damn silly thing we just did. We know all the damn silly things we’ve done for a thousand years and as long as we know that and always have it around where we can see it, someday we’ll stop making the goddamn funeral pyres and jumping in the middle of them. We pick up a few more people that remember every generation.\n\n– Ray Bradbury\n\nAt his best, man is the noblest of all animals; separated from law and justice he is the worst.\n\n– Aristotle\n\nI don’t have that thing that everyone wants to talk about—writer’s block.\n\n– Alice Notley\n\n— Go, my beauty, and live! Strut at concerts, give talks, love, and make your mistakes!\n\n– Mandelstam, The Egyptian Stamp\n\nWe were kissed by poems,\n\ntaken away by seas of prose.\n\n– Rudy Vitkauskas\n\nMaybe life is a series of crashes, climbs, and smiling for pictures.\n\n– Rudy Francisco\n\nWe already have everything we need. There is no need for self-improvement. All these trips that we lay on ourselves— the heavy-duty fearing that we’re bad and hoping that we’re good, the identities that we so dearly cling to, the rage, the jealousy and the addictions of all kinds-never touch our basic wealth. They are like clouds that temporarily block the sun.\n\nBut all the time our warmth and brilliance are right here. This is who we really are. We are one blink of an eye away trom being fully awake.\n\nLooking at ourselves this way is very different from our usual habit. From this perspective we don’t need to change: you can feel as wretched as you like, and you’re still a good candidate for enlightenment. You can feel like the world’s most hopeless basket case, but that feeling is your wealth, not something to be thrown out or improved upon.\n\n– Pema Chödrön\n\nFor psychotherapy to be effective a close rapport is needed, so close that the doctor cannot shut his eyes to the heights and depths of human suffering.\n\n– C.G. Jung\n\nA tainted society has invented psychiatry to defend itself against the investigations of certain superior intellects whose faculties of divination would be troublesome.\n\n– Antonin Artaud\n\npuddles in retreat –\n\nlike untrained men\n\nstepping into Spring.\n\n– Pure Land Haiku\n\nThe person engaged in action is always unconscionable; no one except the contemplative has a conscience.\n\n– J. W. von Goethe\n\nThree apples fell from heaven: the first, for the one who told the tale, the second for the one who listened, and the third for the one who understood. This is the way most Armenian fairytales end.\n\n– Osip Mandelstam\n\nI love man as my fellow; but his scepter, real or usurped, extends not to me.\n\n– Mary Wollstonecraft\n\nThought is always troublesome to him who lives without his own approbation.\n\n– Samuel Johnson\n\nIs there anything better than iced coffee and a bookstore on a sunny day? I mean, aside from hot coffee and a bookstore on a rainy day.\n\n– Emily Henry, Book Lovers\n\nI could tell you that listening is made for the ashen sky,\n\n– Deema K. Shehabi\n\nI’m for the living, suffering, laughable, stuck-in-a-rut human being who blows his stock of meager life-juice just to feel a moment of fraternity with another derivative being.\n\n– Charlie Chaplin\n\nIt is thus that arabesques spring up in the margins of first drafts and live independent, gorgeous, and perfidious lives.\n\nLittle men shaped like violins drink the milk of the paper.\n\n– Mandelstam\n\nHe spoke – a question, perhaps, all in mumble, and she replied, perhaps, an endearment of words, and that was all he needed …\n\n– shome dasgupta\n\nI have run the sands of this day\n\nthrough my fingers and watched them sparkle\n\ninto smoke, and blow away.\n\nTomorrow I will do the same.\n\nIf I’m lucky.\n\n– @cross_mouse\n\nI am tired of little tight-faced poets sitting down to\n\nshape perfect unimportant pieces.\n\nPoems that cough lightly — catch back a sneeze.\n\nThis is the time for Big Poems,\n\nroaring up out of sleaze,\n\npoems from ice, from vomit, and from tainted blood.\n\nThis is the time for stiff or viscous poems.\n\nBig, and Big.\n\n– Gwendolyn Brooks\n\nI’ve known many successful people whose lives I wouldn’t want to have. They had intelligence, they had drive, they had opportunity, and the wherewithal to use them all. But they were missing something else. They knew how to get what they wanted, but the things they wanted weren’t worth wanting. In fact, the things they wanted ended up disfiguring their lives.\n\n– @farnamstreet\n\nThe hardest thing to listen to – your instincts, your human personal intuition – always whispers. So you have to be ready every day of your lives to hear what whispers in your ear.\n\n– Steven Spielberg\n\nIn the distant sky, a bird has gotten hold of a fat snake of smoke and is wrangling it out from the treetops, while down below, a woman lies in the burning house where the bright hot tongue of the snake is lashing.\n\n– @CynthiaMHoffman\n\nReligion is a framing mechanism. It is a language of orientation that presents itself as a series of questions.\n\n– Marilynne Robinson\n\nThe highest level of consciousness is not the one who speaks in a language that no one else can understand. It’s the one who can meet anyone right where they’re at and speak to them in the exact language that they can hear.\n\n– Nika Solé\n\nI’m not your love,\n\nI’m the excuse not to love.\n\nPlease stop using me.\n\nOpen your heart and go.\n\n– @tuttysan\n\nyes, it’s bizarre for educated people to “believe” in astrology; I prefer to think it’s like “believing” in poetry–a kind of benign groupthink. yet, oddly, people will argue about it, & it is difficult to change the subject. must be a kind of secular religion? whyever?\n\n– Joyce Carol Oates\n\nsuch a dream of cleaving\n\na clandestine meeting\n\nof moving earth from deep within\n\nof mysterious molten things\n\nmost elemental\n\n– Julie Kalendek\n\nWe are building a life\n\nupriver from the\n\nplace where life fell\n\napart.\n\n– Leslie Jamison\n\nSome of the difficulty with quantum mechanics has to reside in the problem of coming to terms with the simple fact that there is no such thing as information in and of itself independent of the apparatus necessary to its perception. There were no starry skies prior to the first sentient and ocular being to behold them. Before that all was blackness and silence.\n\nAnd yet it moved.\n\n– Cormac McCarthy\n\nBusy your mind with the concepts of harmony, health, peace, and good will, and wonders will happen in your life.\n\n– Dr. Joseph Murphy\n\nIt is always difficult, the transition from noisy refusal to humble acceptance.\n\n– Zoë Heller\n\nPeople nowadays think that scientists exist to instruct them, poets, musicians, etc. to give them pleasure. The idea that these have something to teach them — that does not occur to them.\n\n– Ludwig Wittgenstein\n\nWe did that often, asking each other questions whose answers we already knew. Perhaps it was so that we would not ask the other questions, the ones whose answers we did not want to know.\n\n– Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie\n\nMarried life is not all sugar, but grace in the heart will keep away most of the sours.\n\n– Charles Spurgeon\n\nWe are all apprentices in a craft where no one ever becomes a master.\n\n– Ernest Hemingway\n\nIf they feel as we feel they may stop.\n\n– Ernest Hemingway\n\nThe irony of not wanting your taxes to pay for services like healthcare and student loans is that people who take this position are often afraid that if they get taxed, they won’t have enough money to pay for their healthcare and student loans.\n\n– Ethan Nichtern\n\n“None of these things move me,” is a wonderful affirmation.\n\n– Florence Scovel Shinn\n\nThe things the spectacle presents as eternal are based on change, and must change as their foundations change. The spectacle is totally dogmatic, yet it is incapable of arriving at any really solid dogma. Nothing stands still for it. This instability is the spectacle’s natural condition, but it is completely contrary to its natural inclination.\n\n– Guy Debord\n\nNormalize not building your identity around a career.\n\n– the.holistic.psychologist@\n\nOur judgments, like our watches, none go just alike, yet each believes his own\n\n– Alexander Pope\n\nNo man who merely skims the Bible can profit from it. We must dig and mine until we obtain hidden treasure.\n\n– Charles Spurgeon\n\nIndividuation is not linear but a circumambulation of the self; a spiral journey towards wholeness where the head and heart work together; a life-long process of integrating the opposite, bringing split-off parts into more holistic personality.\n\n– Karin Syrett\n\nThe only path by which another person can upset you is through your own thought.\n\n– Dr. Joseph Murphy\n\nThe only absolute\n\nYou should keep in your boot\n\nIs that absolutes\n\nAre absolutely\n\nRidiculous\n\n– Mark Haptonstall\n\nWe are slowed down sound and light waves, a walking bundle of frequencies tuned into the music of the cosmos, we are souls dressed up in sacred biochemical garments, and our bodies are the instruments through which our souls play their music.\n\n– Albert Einstein\n\nThe old hunger for voyages fed at his heart… To go alone…into strange cities; to meet strange people and to pass again before they could know him; to wander, like his own legend, across the earth–it seemed to him there could be no better thing than that.\n\n– Thomas Wolfe\n\nThe difficulty for me in writing—among the difficulties—is to write language that can work quietly on a page for a reader who doesn’t hear anything … one has to work very carefully with what is in between the words. What is not said.\n\n– Toni Morrison\n\nYou need to have a community. You need to have meaningful values, not the junk values you’ve been pumped full of all your life, telling you happiness comes through money and buying objects. You need to have meaningful work. You need the natural world. You need to feel you are respected. You need a secure future. You need connections to all these things. You need to release any shame you might feel for having been mistreated.\n\n– Johann Hari\n\nSo, I begin each day with a gesture of cynicism, and close it with a gesture of faith; or, if you prefer, begin it by reminding myself that, for me at least, goals and objectives are without value, and close it by demonstrating that the fact is irrelevant. A gesture of temporality, a gesture of eternity. It is in the tension between these two gestures that I have lived my adult life.\n\n– John Barth\n\nI marvel at the capacity\n\nOf memory\n\nWhich, in some deep pocket\n\nOf my mind, preserves you whole—\n\nAs wind is wind, as the lion-taming\n\nSun is sun, you are, you stay:\n\nNothing is lost, nothing has blown away.\n\n– Barbara Howe\n\nFeminism is an endeavor to change something very old, widespread, and deeply rooted in many, perhaps most, cultures around the world, innumerable institutions, and most households on Earth—and in our minds, where it all begins and ends. That so much change has been made in four or five decades is amazing; that everything is not permanently, definitively, irrevocably changed is not a sign of failure. A woman goes walking down a thousand-mile road. Twenty minutes after she steps forth, they proclaim that she still has nine hundred ninety-nine miles to go and will never get anywhere.\n\n– Rebecca Solnit\n\nLiving in duality ignores the collective self, while embracing our interdependence aligns our universal essence.\n\n– Mitch Takefman\n\nSeek not the favor of the multitude; it is seldom got by honest and lawful means. But seek the testimony of few; and number not voices, but weigh them.\n\n– Immanuel Kant\n\nIt is good to stand in the middle of the stream and live rather than stand on the bank..to have both a sense of participation and also a sense of wise detachment because one knows the reality of things.\n\n– Amitava Kumar\n\nI never knew the charm of spring, Never met it face to face, I never knew my heart could sing, Never missed a warm embrace ‘til April in Paris…\n\n– Yip Harburg\n\nFor us only a name remains\n\nA sound miraculous and lasting.\n\nTake from me these grains of sand:\n\nI’m pouring them from hand to hand.\n\n– from Mandelstam’s final poem to Tsvetaeva\n\nSPRING\n\nSomething new in the air today, perhaps the struggle of the bud\n\nto become a leaf. Nearly two weeks late it invaded the air but\n\nthen what is two weeks to life herself? On a cool night there is\n\na break from the struggle of becoming. I suppose that’s why we\n\nsleep. In a childhood story they spoke of the land of enchant-\n\nment. We crawl to it, we short-lived mammals, not realizing that\n\nwe are already there. To the gods the moon is the entire moon\n\nbut to us it changes second by second because we are always fish\n\nin the belly of the whale of earth. We are encased and can’t stray\n\nfrom the house of our bodies. I could say that we are released,\n\nbut I don’t know, in our private night when our souls explode\n\ninto a billion fragments then calmly regather in a black pool in\n\nthe forest, far from the cage of flesh, the unremitting “I.” This was\n\na dream and in dreams we are forever alone walking the ghost\n\nroad beyond our lives. Of late I see waking as another chance at\n\nspring.\n\n– Jim Harrison\n\nA RIVER MOVING IN YOU\n\nWhen you do things from your soul,\n\nyou feel a river moving in you, a joy.\n\nWhen actions come from another place,\n\nthe feeling disappears.\n\nDon’t let others lead you. …\n\nDon’t insist on going where you think you want to go.\n\nAsk the way to the spring.\n\nYour living pieces will form a harmony.\n\n– Rumi\n\nWe disliked the rigors of existence, the unfulfilled longings, the enshrined injustices of the world, the labyrinths of love, the ignorance of parents, the fact of dying, and the amazing indifference of the Living in the midst of the simple beauties of the universe. We feared the heartlessness of human beings, all of whom are born blind, few of whom ever learn to see.\n\n– Ben Okri, The Famished Road\n\nCause-and-effect assumes history marches forward, but history is not an army. It is a crab scuttling sideways, a drip of soft water wearing away stone, an earthquake breaking centuries of tension. Sometimes one person inspires a movement, or her words do decades later, sometimes a few passionate people change the world; sometimes they start a mass movement and millions do; sometimes those millions are stirred by the same outrage or the same ideal, and change comes upon us like a change of weather. All that these transformations have in common is that they begin in the imagination, in hope.\n\n– Rebecca Solnit\n\nThe path up is the path down. The way forward is the way back. The universe inside is outside but the universe outside is inside.\n\n– Robert Anton Wilson\n\nWhen I overgive, I feel terrible. What am I trying to get from it? What’s my neediest need underneath that I’m not listening to, communicating, and receiving where it is (and isn’t) being met?\n\n– McCall Erickson\n\nOur society has not even begun to face its shadow.\n\n– C.G. Jung\n\nThe photograph is meant to get lost somewhere in a box in an attic. It is a nomadic thing that has only a small chance to survive.\n\n– WG Sebald\n\nEven in the darkest and most devastating times, love is nearby if you know what to look for.\n\n– Anne Lamott\n\nThe things, which impress us from outside, can only do so because of our inner attitude.\n\n– CG Jung\n\nWe’ve convinced ourselves that the land around us—generously abundant at some moments, ferocious and unforgiving at others—is really a set of sheer facts; we hold ourselves apart from the world in order to subdue its wildness.\n\n– David Abram\n\nBecause you don’t\n\nyou can’t,\n\nthe old monk said.\n\n– The Old Monk\n\nWhere I begin is all one to me\n\nWherever I begin I will return again\n\n– Parmenides\n\n(tr. Stanley Lombardo)\n\nSometimes on arriving at dusk at a small town I would feel that I had been transported into another world ….the church bell clanging, the sense of being unknown to everyone and perhaps invisible would make me walk as if I was treading on air.\n\n– Gerald Brenan\n\nEverything is Broken\n\nby Bob Dylan\n\nBroken lines, broken strings\n\nBroken threads, broken springs\n\nBroken idols, broken heads\n\nPeople sleeping in broken beds\n\nAin’t no use jiving, ain’t no use joking\n\nEverything is broken\n\nBroken bottles, broken plates\n\nBroken switches, broken gates\n\nBroken dishes, broken parts\n\nStreets are filled with broken hearts\n\nBroken words never meant to be spoken\n\nEverything is broken\n\nSeem like every time you stop and turn around\n\nSomething else just hit the ground\n\nBroken cutters, broken saws\n\nBroken buckles, broken laws\n\nBroken bodies, broken bones\n\nBroken voices on broken phones\n\nTake a deep breath, feel like you’re choking\n\nEverything is broken\n\nEvery time you leave and go off someplace\n\nThings fall to pieces in my face\n\nBroken hands on broken ploughs\n\nBroken treaties, broken vows\n\nBroken pipes, broken tools\n\nPeople bending broken rules\n\nHound dog howling, bull frog croaking\n\nEverything is broken\n\nThe fundamental, ultimate mystery-the only thing you need to know to understand the deepest metaphysical secrets-is this: that for every outside there is an inside and for every inside there is an outside, and although they are different, they go together.\n\n– Alan W. Watts\n\nIf you don’t tell the whole truth about yourself, life is a ridiculous exercise.\n\n– Joel Grey\n\nan old gnarled root\n\ndried out and dishevelled\n\nthe rope still around it\n\nthat dragged it from the\n\nground\n\n– Thomas A Clark\n\nBe grateful for\n\nwhat you’ve got —\n\nthere’s not much of it\n\ngoing around,\n\nthe old monk said.\n\n– The Old Monk\n\nI want to write in the language of those\n\nwho have been to that place before me.\n\n– Chase Twichell\n\nWelcome events in whichever way they happen: this is the path to peace.\n\n– Epictetus\n\nI am sorry but the list of questions does not interest me to answer. Nor have I that respect for the public.\n\n– Djuna Barnes\n\nlichens, droppings, stones\n\nI bend to inspect\n\ndetail in a clarity\n\nI cannot leave\n\n– Thomas A Clark\n\nAgainst whom do we ever struggle if not against our own double?\n\n– Yves Bonnefoy\n\nLiterature is the most agreeable way of ignoring life.\n\n– Fernando Pessoa\n\nCliche protects us from facing the catastrophe, the unbearable, the ineffable; thus far the major inexplicable areas of human existence—birth, death, and love—we have the maximum number of cliches.\n\n– Svetlana Boym\n\nThe poem is the skin of the poet.\n\n– Alda Merini\n\nCan’t you calm him down? It’s only in bourgeois countries that people are shot because of poems.\n\n– Soviet soldier to Nadezhda Mandelstam about Osip, on train from Kazan station to Solikamsk\n\nI am freezing without proper clothes.\n\n– Mandelstam\n\na full moon\n\nthe magnolia\n\nshines bright\n\n– James Welsh\n\nClose your ears.\n\nTo hear again\n\nis to be in love\n\nwith that strange girl\n\nunder the wave,\n\nwho lulls you\n\ntill you want to be her.\n\nCome inside,\n\nbefore she’s all you\n\nknow and you live forever\n\nin a house with no floor.\n\n– Billie Chernicoff\n\ntenderly\n\ntend\n\nthis\n\nyou.\n\n– Eric Bond\n\nWas she ever the same person? Were there any two moments in her life when she was comparable to herself?\n\n– Jenny Erpenbeck\n\nPoetry matters, because even when a country & language are fragmented, shattering around you, it is a human voice that won’t refuse to speak.\n\n– Ilya Kaminsky\n\nThere is something in you I like\n\nmore than yourself. Therefore\n\nI must destroy you\n\n– Jacques Lacan\n\nHappiness is not determined by what’s happening around you, but rather what’s happening inside you.\n\n– @JoshBulriss\n\nBut the sense is much altered and the hearer’s conceit strangely entangled by the figure *metalepsis*, which I call the Far-Fetched. As when we had rather such a word a great way off then to use one nearer hand to express the matter as well and plainer.\n\n– George Puttenham\n\nThe soul is but a flaw in this flesh.\n\nI’m a stream deprived\n\nof the right to flow into the sea.\n\nI’m a plant\n\nthat’s seedless and rootless.\n\nI’m the stone\n\nthat cannot pass the test\n\nof its own duration.\n\n– Alain Bosquet (translated by Édouard Roditi)\n\nNature is pleased with simplicity. And nature is no fool\n\n– Isaac Newton\n\nPeople who didn’t grow up in a small town church will never know the awkward savour of those sermons aimed specifically at one member of the congregation, and everyone knows who\n\n– River Kenna\n\nAn ecosocialist version of the fetter thesis would recognize that democratic control over the productive forces would enable us not only to unleash socially and ecologically beneficial forms of production but also reduce damaging and unnecessary forms of production.\n\n– Jason Hickel\n\nWhat sounds dissonant to you may sound quite mellifluous to me. The literary world does not expect Gide or Mann or T.S. Eliot to emote with the accents of Victor Hugo or Walter Scott. It may be that new music sounds peculiar for the sole reason that, in the course of ordinary listening, one hears so little of it by comparison with the amount of conventional music that is performed year in and year out. Radio and concert programs, the advertisements of the record manufacturers, or school curricula – all emphasize the idea, unwittingly, perhaps, that “normal” music is music of the past, familiar music that has proved its worth.\n\n– Aaron Copland, 1949\n\nYearning for education was just part of the culture. My friends and I worshipped literature. We thought everything we would ever know or care about or be ­devoted to was to be found in literature.\n\n– Vivian Gornick\n\nAjahn Chah said, “I hope you’re not afraid to suffer.” I asked him what he meant. He continued “There are two kinds of suffering. There is the suffering you run away from, which follows you everywhere and there is the suffering you face directly and in doing so become free.”\n\n– Jack Kornfield\n\nA heavy burden lifted from my soul, I heard that love was out of my control.\n\n– Leonard Cohen\n\nHappy is what you realize you are a fraction of a second before it’s too late.\n\n– Ali Smith\n\nShamanistic cultures view illness and trauma as a problem for the entire community, not just for the individual or individuals who manifest the symptoms.\n\n– Peter A. Levine\n\nThere is no more miserable human being than one in whom nothing is habitual but indecision.\n\n– William James\n\nPut it to the test and cast your eyes upon the history of mankind.\n\n– Notes from the Underground, Fyodor Dostoevsky\n\nWhat a beautiful inspirational model for how human beings might live: in a shared economy based not on greed but on nurturing relationships and mutual cooperation.\n\n– Paul Stamets\n\nBe seriously involved with growing, with your own development, and never fear.\n\n– Jeff Buckley\n\nThe maker of the stars is at the same time the physician for broken hearts and wounded spirits.\n\n– Charles Spurgeon\n\nAwake. Love. Think. Speak. Be walking trees. Be talking beasts. Be divine waters.\n\n– C. S. Lewis\n\nThe decks are cleared for Divine action.\n\n– Florence Scovel Shinn\n\nWake up first,\n\nwith pure and unapologetic selfishness,\n\nor you’re just another shipwreck victim\n\nfloundering in the ocean\n\nand all the compassion in the world\n\nis of absolutely no use to the other victims\n\nfloundering around you.\n\n– Jed McKenna\n\nWhen you’re the OPPRESSED you know everything about the OPPRESSER.\n\n– Elizabeth Plank\n\nThe highest level of consciousness is not the one who speaks in a language that no one else can understand. It’s the one who can meet anyone right where they’re at and speak to them in the exact language that they can hear.\n\n– gyallikevee@\n\nAvoid a sugar-coated gospel. Seek that gospel which rips up, tears, and cuts, and even kills, for that is the gospel that makes alive again.\n\n– Charles Spurgeon\n\nNormalize using words like: colleague, classmate, acquaintance, old school mate, neighbor, client.

Our food, our products, our environment, and even our thoughts impact the chemical reactions in our cells.\n\n– Kim Eallonardo\n\nIt is hard for me to understand a culture that not only hates and fights his brothers, but even attacks Nature and abuses her. Man must love all creation or he will love none of it. Love is something you and I must have. We must have it because our spirit feeds upon it. Without love our self esteem weakens. Without it our courage fails.\n\nWithout love we can no longer look out confidently at the world. Instead we turn inwardly and begin to feed upon our own personalities and little by little we destroy ourselves.\n\n– Chief Dan George\n\nI wish that I could put up yesterday’s evening sky for all posterity, could preserve a night of love, the sound of a mountain stream, a realization as it sets my mind afire, a dance, a day of harmony, ten thousand glorious days of clouds that will instead vanish and never be seen again, line them up in jars where they might be admired in the interim and tasted again as needed.\n\n– Rebecca Solnit, The Faraway Nearby\n\nLet’s never accept half our country living with fewer rights than they had 50 years ago. Let’s never normalize a political party embracing Russian propaganda. Let’s never relent until those who attempted to overthrow our democracy are held to account – in the courts and at the ballot box.\n\n– Jack E. Smith\n\nI detect an undercurrent of self-doubt among some Americans about what your role in the world should be… At a time when our world is at history’s turning point… Freedom and democracy are currently under threat around\n\nthe globe.\n\n– Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, 2024\n\nSome empathy must be learned and then imagined, by perceiving the suffering of others and translating it into one’s own experience of suffering and thereby suffering a little with then. Empathy can be a story you tell yourself about what it must be like to be that other person; but its lack can also arrive from narrative, about why the sufferer deserved it, or why that person or those people have nothing to do with you. Whole societies can be taught to deaden feeling, to dissociate from their marginal and minority members, just as people can and do erase the humanity of those close to them.\n\nEmpathy makes you imagine the sensation of the torture, of the hunger, of the loss. You make that person into yourself, you inscribe their suffering on your own body or heart or mind, and then you respond to their suffering as though it were your own. Identification, we say, to mean that I extend solidarity to you, and who and what you identify with builds your own identity. Physical pain defines the physical boundaries of the self but these identifications define a larger self, a map of affections and alliances, and the limits of this psychic self are nothing more or less than the limits of love. Which is to say love enlarges; it annexes affectionately; at its utmost it dissolves all boundaries.\n\n– Rebecca Solnit\n\nDrugs. Alcohol. Poverty. Violence. The seeds of the problem were planted long before she or Maya or anyone of their generation took a breath. The heritage of historical trauma loomed large over all Native people. For the Diné, Hwéeldi, or the Long Walk, epitomized the cruel efforts of mainstream society to turn Indians into white people. The forced march from their homeland to the prison camp at Bosque Redondo and the devastating loss of elders and infants during those years of captivity and dislocation still rippled through the Navajo world. When the People returned to their sacred land, they faced more hardship. The boarding school movement sent children to institutions that forcibly prohibited them from speaking the Navajo language and returning home for ceremonies. How did people learn to be parents if they grew up without the example and guidance of loving relatives? It was a testimony to the enduring strength and wisdom of the Navajo culture that so much of their traditions remained vibrant and resilient. They were as much a part of this landscape as the mountains and rivers.\n\n– Anne Hillerman\n\nJournalist: “What do you think is your greatest achievement?”\n\nDavid Bowie: “Marrying my wife.”\n\n“But as a musician?”\n\n“Nothing else matters.”\n\nWe’re living in a civilization that doesn’t understand metaphor.

As I see it, fighting to bridge those gaps isn’t what really matters. The most important thing is to know them inside and out, as differences, and to understand why certain people are the way they are.\n\n– Banana Yoshimoto\n\nJung recounts that his intense study of mythologies forced him to conclude that without a myth, a human “is like one uprooted, having no true link either with the past, or w/ the ancestral life which continues within him, or yet with contemporary human society.\n\n– Lance Owens\n\nSynchronicities can produce the crack in our consciousness that expands our choices, our capacities and our consciousness of the divine. These mysterious moments go beyond our ego consciousness and open us to the sacredness of being a part of something larger than we are.\n\n– Laurence Hillman, Alignments\n\nIf your everyday life appears to be unworthy subject matter, do not complain to life. Complain to yourself. Lament that you are not poet enough to call up its wealth. For the creative artist there is no poverty—nothing is insignificant or unimportant.\n\n– Rainer Maria Rilke\n\nBeauty is no quality in things themselves: It exists merely in the mind which contemplates them; and each mind perceives a different beauty. One person may even perceive deformity, where another is sensible of beauty; and every individual ought to acquiesce in his own sentiment, without pretending to regulate those of others.\n\n– David Hume\n\nA mind that believes there is a God, or that there is no God, is a conditioned, prejudiced mind.\n\n– Krishnamurti\n\nThe earthy smell, the sunless air, the sensation of the world being shut out, the resounding of the organ through the black and white arched galleries and aisles, are wings that take me back, and hold me hovering above those days, in a half-sleeping and half-waking dream.\n\n– David Copperfield, Charles Dickens\n\nTo evolve is to explore the vast landscapes of self, where each step forward is a homecoming to who we are meant to be.\n\n– Avalon Ash\n\nYou could go to brunch this weekend, or you could stay home and make a dent in the to-read pile that’s been sitting on your nightstand since January.

You act like a mortal in all that you fear, and like an immortal in all that you desire.\n\nEvery heartbreak weaves a new patch into the quilt of our emotions, colorful and resilient in its unfolding.\n\n– Avalon Ash\n\nAny worldview organizes a world to view.\n\n– Joseph Pearce\n\nIt’s your life.

Johnson\n\nThe Western worldview says, in essence, that technological progress is the highest value and that we were born to consume, to endlessly use and discard natural resources, other species, technological gadgets, toys, and, often, other people, especially if they are poor or from the Third World. The most highly prized freedom is the right to shop. It’s a world of commodities, not entities, and economic expansion is the primary measure of progress. Competition, taking, and hoarding are higher values than cooperation, sharing, and gifting. Profits are valued over people, money over meaning, First-World entitlement over global peace and justice, ‘us’ over ‘them’. This addiction is the most dangerous one in the world, not only because of its impact on most of humanity but because it is rapidly undermining the natural systems that sustain the\n\nearth’s biosphere.\n\nAll other addictions in the West can be seen as components of this larger one. If we are born to consume, then it is a dog-eat-dog world, there is no deeper meaning, no human soul, and creation is just a huge, dumb joke. That’s a conclusion you wouldn’t want to live with every day; better to\n\ndistract and deaden yourself with addictions. By the time we reach adulthood, our ways of thinking about ourselves and the world have been moulded and constrained by the predominant values of Western culture. This limits us in ways difficult to see at first; we are like fish in the sea, unconscious of the cultural\n\nwaters within which we have come of age.\n\nAll children and adolescents fashion personalities that fit within their native culture. In the West, that means a society largely materialistic, synthetic, technological, anthropocentric, ethnocentric, and egocentric. Fitting in with such a culture is difficult to accomplish without losing contact with our souls and with nature, the web of life. Western lifestyles that revolve around a constant barrage of anaemic distractions may be, in part, ways of self-numbing so as to minimise the pain of that loss. Many people have succumbed to daily routines of soul-starving entertainment, superficial fashion, and mind-numbing jobs. This way of life becomes an addiction. The more we live this way, the more alienated we become from something deeper and more meaningful, and the more we need this way of life to keep us from experiencing that alienation.\n\n– Bill Plotkin, Soulcraft\n\nOur identities are not really as individual or independent as we think. They’re interrelated with other people’s lives.\n\n– Gabriella Souza\n\nThere is a movement of transmuting suffering into art;\n\nIt can only take place when things have been sufficiently felt through.\n\nIt is the culmination of the breakdown –\n\nArt falls out the bottom.\n\nThis might happen as actual art (poems, drawings, music),\n\nOr it may come in a moment of transmuted perception,\n\nWhere personal psychological pain becomes redeemed\n\nIn the life of soul and the meaning of all things.\n\n– Daniel Thorson\n\nthe history of my poetry must coincide with my history. i reject and i consider out of bounds the cold determination of the intellect, the exercises (no matter how civilized), the experiments that slyly or ingenuously attempt the impossible throw of the dice.\n\n– bartolo cattafi\n\nIf poetry has half a chance to getting wind of truth, it is because it knows all its disguises. (If truth has eluded philosophy through time, it is because philosophy has claimed truth’s territory as intrinsic.)\n\n– Stathis Gourgouris\n\nJust as no bodily pleasure at all can gladden the mind of one whose body is engulfed in flames, so too those full of compassion cannot come near to feeling joy when living beings are in distress.\n\n– Śāntideva\n\nMoney is everywhere but so is poetry.

To eliminate something from your life, ignore it, do not avoid it.\n\n– Vadim Zeland\n\nWe must distinguish two others, at least two; an other with a big O, and another with a small o, which is the ego.

This is what our society needs — not new ideas and inventions; important as these are, and not geniuses and supermen, but persons who can “be”, that is, persons who have a center of strength within themselves.\n\n– Rollo May\n\nIt’s not enough to love something–or someone. Of course you love a person or art or music or the theatre. But you have to imagine that this person or this thing is trapped in a house afire, and the fire is apathy, and the fire is ignorance, and you have to go into the house all the time, day after day, year after year, and put out the flames and save the thing you love and rebuild the house in which it lives, and show it to others who will come to the rescue when you no longer can. Love is cheap and silly–a moron can love ice cream–but devotion is something worth talking about.\n\n– Eva Le Gallienne\n\nPeople are mostly layers of violence and tenderness wrapped like bulbs, and it is difficult to say what makes them onions or hyacinths.\n\n– Eudora Welty\n\nFor there is a spot the size of a shilling at the back of the head which one can never see for oneself. It is one of the good offices that sex can discharge – to describe that spot the size of a shilling at the back of the head. Think how much women have profited by the comments of Juvenal; by the criticism of Strindberg. Think with what humanity and brilliancy men, from the earliest ages, have pointed out to women that dark place at the back of the head! And if Mary were very brave and very honest, she would go behind the other sex and tell us what she found there. A true picture of man as a whole can never be painted until a woman has described that spot the size of a shilling.\n\n– Virginia Woolf\n\nBeauty is often spoken of as though it only stirs lust or admiration, but the most beautiful people are so in a way that makes them look like destiny or fate or meaning, the heroes of a remarkable story.\n\n– Rebecca Solnit\n\nHere’s how I became myself: mess, failure, mistakes, disappointments, and extensive reading; limbo, indecision, setbacks, addiction, public embarrassment, and endless conversations with my best women friends; the loss of people without whom I could not live, the loss of pets that left me reeling, dizzying betrayals but much greater loyalty, and overall, choosing as my motto William Blake’s line that we are here to learn to endure the beams of love.\n\n– Anne Lamott\n\nWe actually contain a built-in ability to rise above restriction, incapacity, or limitation and, as a result of this ability, possess a vital adaptive spirit that we have not yet fully accessed. While this ability can lead us to transcendence, paradoxically it can lead also to violence; our longing for transcendence arises from our intuitive sensing of this adaptive potential and our violence arises from our failure to develop it.\n\n– Joseph Chilton Pearce\n\nOur duty, as men and women, is to proceed as if limits to our ability did not exist. We are collaborators in creation. We are one, after all, you and I, together we suffer, together exist, and forever will recreate each other. Remain true to yourself, but move ever upward toward greater consciousness and greater love!\n\n– Pierre Teilhard de Chardin\n\nThe thing we must do intensely is be human together. People are more important than things. We must get together. The best thing humans can have going for them is each other. We have each other. We must reject everything which humiliates us. Humans are not objects of consumption. We must develop an absolute priority of humans ahead of profit — any humans ahead of any profit.

Orage\n\nLife is occupied in both perpetuating itself and in surpassing itself; if all it does is maintain itself, then living is only not dying.\n\n– Simone de Beauvoire\n\nI believe good art, good poetry, and true mythology communicates, without our knowing it, that life is not just a series of insulated, unrelated events. The great truths—when they can be visualized in images—reveal deep patterns, and reveal that we are a part of them. That deeply heals us, and it largely happens beneath our conscious awareness. A great story pulls us inside of a cosmic story.\n\n– Richard Rohr\n\nI did not feel Armageddon in my bones but I worried about all those people who did, who were ready for it, wishing hard, making phone calls and bank withdrawals.

They are the same koan in a way. They heal into eachother, like medicine and sickness do.\n\n– Susan Murphy Roshi\n\nThere is an art in listening. Listen to find out if what is said is of significance, and after listening, judge, accept, or throw out; but first of all listen. The difficulty with most of us is that we do not listen. We come prepared to be antagonistic or friendly, and not to listen neutrally. If you listen neutrally, surely then only you begin to discover what lies behind the words. Words are a means of communication. You have to learn my vocabulary, the meaning behind my words, and then you will find the significance of the subject. The thing of first importance is to learn to listen rightly. If you read a poem and are biased, how can you understand it? To appreciate what the poet wants you to understand, you must come with freedom to do so.\n\n– Krishnamurti\n\nI know a few things about healing\n\nit’s not a good employee.\n\nit shows up when it’s ready\n\nand only works when it wants to.\n\n– Rudy Francisco\n\nThe story doesn’t change when we pretend it was all an illusion. The story doesn’t change when we get addicted to transcendence and float above it. The story doesn’t change when we feign forgiveness and resolution. The story doesn’t change when we confuse dissociation with expansion. The story doesn’t change when we tell ourselves that there are no victims. The story changes when we own our pain. The story changes when we are truly seen in our suffering. The story changes when we work it through to the lessons at its core. The story changes when we heal our heart. We are made of story- there’s no shame in that. The illusion is illusion, itself. Either we work through our story, or our story will work through us.\n\n– Jeff Brown\n\nI learned from Whitman that the poem is a temple – or a green field —a place to enter, and in which to feel. Only in a secondary way is it an intellectual thing—an artifact, a moment of seemly and robust wordiness— wonderful as that part of it is. I learned that the poem was made not just to exist, but to speak-to be company. It was everything that was needed, when everything was needed. I remember the delicate, rumpled way into the woods, and the weight of the books in my pack. I remember the rambling, and the loafing-the wonderful days when, with Whitman, I tucked my trowser-ends in my boots and went and had a good time.\n\n– Mary Oliver\n\nSweet enemy,\n\nwith a butterfly net\n\nyou set traps for me\n\namong the folds of pleasure.\n\n– Maria-Mercè Marçal\n\nThe world is wonderful, it was said, if you take the trouble to travel through it on foot.\n\n– Robert Walser\n\nAll song is bent\n\nby a silent measure;\n\na dancer’s foot\n\nis a luminous disk in flight.\n\nThis song is an open field,\n\nand a fibrous exploration\n\nwhere the voice feels braced\n\nby its own fluidity.\n\n– Jay Wright, Music’s Mask and Measure\n\nThe choice to abstain from certain technologies is – and will increasingly become – key to human flourishing\n\n– River Kenna\n\nI am not able, and do not want, completely to abandon the world view that I acquired in childhood. So long as I remain alive and well I shall continue to feel strongly about prose style, to love the surface of the earth, and to take a pleasure in solid objects and scraps of useless information. It is no use trying to suppress that side of myself.\n\n– George Orwell\n\nWhen I see a man getting ready to put the world in order, I know there will be great trouble.\n\n– Alan Watts\n\nThe artist tries to see what there is to be interested in … He has not created something, he has seen something.\n\n– T.E. Hulme\n\nHegel is the last great philosopher. After him, decadence begins.\n\n– Cioran\n\nYes, when I address someone, I do not know whom I am addressing; furthermore, I do not care to know, nor do I wish to know, him. Without dialogue, lyric poetry cannot exist. Yet there is only one thing that pushes us into the addressee’s embrace: the desire to be astonished by our own words, to be captivated by their originality and unexpectedness. Logic is merciless. If I know the person I am addressing, I know in advance how he will react to my words, to whatever I say, and consequently, I will not succeed in being astonished in his astonishment, in rejoicing in his joy, in loving in his love. The distance of separation erases the features of the loved one. Only from a distance do I feel the desire to tell him something important, something I could not utter directly seeing his face before me as a known quantity. Allow me to formulate this observation more succinctly: our sense of communication is inversely proportional to our real knowledge of the addressee and directly proportional to our felt need to interest him in ourselves. Acoustics can take care of itself: we need not be concerned about it. Distance is another matter. Whispering to a neighbor is boring. But it is downright maddening to bore one’s own soul. On the other hand, exchanging signals with the planet Mars (not fantasizing, of course) is a task worthy\n\nof a lyric poet.\n\n– Osip Mandelstam\n\nWrite when you’re emotional. Edit when you’re not.\n\n– David Mcllroy\n\nThe great law of nature is that it never stops. There is no end.\n\n– Ryan Holiday\n\nThe stars are undoubtably superb, as Freud remarked on reading Kant’s cosmological proof of the existence of God.\n\n– Samuel Beckett\n\nVery few of us are what we seem.\n\n– Agatha Christie\n\nTHE GOOD LIFE\n\nWhen some people talk about money\n\nThey speak as if it were a mysterious lover\n\nWho went out to buy milk and never\n\nCame back, and it makes me nostalgic\n\nFor the years I lived on coffee and bread,\n\nHungry all the time, walking to work on payday\n\nLike a woman journeying for water\n\nFrom a village without a well, then living\n\nOne or two nights like everyone else\n\nOn roast chicken and red wine.\n\n– Tracy K. Smith\n\nI never wrote poems in summer. The blossoming and resplendence were too sensuous for me. In summer I was melancholy. In autumn a melody came over the world. I was in love with the fog, with the first beginnings of darkness, with the cold. I found the snow divine, but perhaps even more beautiful, more divine, seemed the dark wild warm storms of early spring. In the winter cold, the evenings glistened and shimmered enchantingly. Sounds bedazzled me, colors spoke. It goes without saying I lived eternally alone. Loneliness was the bride I indulged, the friend I preferred, the conversation I adored, the beauty I enjoyed, the society in which I lived. Nothing was more natural and nothing friendlier to me. I was a clerk and often without a suitable position, which was fine with me. O the delightful dreamy melancholia, the enchanting hopelessness, the heavenly beautiful dejection, genial sorrow, sweet cruelty. I adored the outskirts with its figure of the solitary laborer. The snow- covered fields spoke intimately to me, the moon seemed to be weeping low onto the ghostly white snow. The stars! It was glorious. I was so princely poor and so regally free. In the wintry night, towards morning, I stood at the open window in only my nightshirt, the icy air blowing on my face and chest. And at the same time I had the strange illusion that the air was glowing all around me. Often in the remote room that I inhabited, I threw myself on my knees and begged God to give me a pretty line of verse. Then I walked out the door and lost myself in nature.\n\n– Robert Walser, Poetry, (t. by Whalen, Kongeter, and Wiesner)\n\nNow the traveling eye presents its ambassadorial credentials to the consciousness. A cold treaty is drawn up between the viewer in the picture, something on the order of a state secret.\n\n– Osip Mandelstam\n\nYou have dared call Time your “brother,” take as your ally the worst of torturers. On this point, our differences explode: you walk in step with Time, while I precede or drag after it, never adopting its manners, unable\n\nto think of it without experiencing something like a speculative sorrow.\n\n– Emil Cioran\n\nSome people turn sad awfully young. No special reason, it seems, but they seem almost to be born that way. They bruise easier, tire faster, cry quicker, remember longer and, as I say, get sadder younger than anyone else in the world. I know, for I’m one of them.\n\n– Ray Bradbury\n\nhere are three people in one person, one eight years old, another forty, the third one, one hundred and five years old. Picture this: those three people live in one room; they have nothing in common in terms of coming to agreement and sharing work.\n\n– Gurdjieff, Paris Meetings\n\nBeing stubborn, set in their ways and uninterested in being lectured to for four hours, the questioners, when they read this, will doubtless ask me: ‘well, but what solutions do you offer?’ And I, to conclude, will tell you that if you want solutions, go to the store across the street, because I have no such thing to sell you. My endeavor has been, is and will be that those who read me should think and meditate on fundamental things, and it has never been to give them ready-made answers. I have always sought to agitate, and, at most, suggest, rather than instruct. What I offer is not bread, but the yeast or ferment with which to make it.\n\n– Miguel de Unamuno\n\nIt is the artistic mission to penetrate as far as may be toward that secret ground where primal law feeds growth.\n\n– Paul Klee\n\nAnd again and again I have to remind myself that the whole art of life is to lean on people, to involve oneself with them quite fearlessly and yet—when the props are kicked away—remain leaning, as it were, on empty air. Like levitation.\n\n– Christopher Isherwood\n\nIf you feel irritated by the absurd remarks of two people whose conversation you happen to overhear, you should imagine that you are listening to a dialogue of two fools in a comedy.\n\n– Arthur Schopenhauer\n\nIt is better to remain in a state of not knowing than to go into the mind in search of an answer.\n\n– Leonard Jacobson\n\nWhen at last we knew how little\n\nWould survive us—how little we had mended\n\nOr built that was not now lost—something\n\nLarge and old awoke.\n\n– Tracy K. Smith\n\nNo man is entitled to act toward me as if he knew me\n\n– Walser\n\nGoing was dying, and staying was dying. When we get to junctures like that, we had better choose the dying that enlarges rather than the one that keeps us stuck.\n\n– James Hollis, What Matters Most\n\nHow often I find you\n\nthen on your patio, pajamaed\n\nand distressed, head thrown\n\nback so your eyes can pick apart\n\nnot the darker version of myself\n\nbut the carousel of stars.\n\nTo you I am merely background.\n\nYou barely hear my voice.\n\nRemember I am most vibrant\n\nwhen air breaks my light.\n\nDo something with your brokenness.\n\n– David Hernandez\n\nNot knowing can help.\n\nEvery knowing ignores something else.\n\nEach this is not that.\n\nFreedom doesn’t have a home\n\nWhat if my songs go for a vacation?\n\nWhat if my heart decides to live again?\n\n– George Gorman\n\nDifferent people\n\nhave different inclinations.\n\nEvery human\n\nis a different species.\n\nEvery relationship\n\nis a different throw\n\nof the chemistry inherent\n\nin everything.\n\n– George Gorman\n\nPhilosophy and literature are speculative constructs of the commerce between word and world.\n\n– George Steiner\n\nIf people are living the same as always, with their bellies full of food, they’ll just go on the same way. If they get hungry and unhappy enough, something happens.\n\n– Paul Bowles\n\nIn transactional relationships, people only reach out when they want something from you. They use your connection to achieve their goals.\n\nIn meaningful relationships, people get in touch when they think of you. Staying connected and being helpful are their goals.\n\n– Adam Grant\n\nAll those years and their moments—\n\nCrackling bacon, slamming car doors,\n\nPoems tried out on friends,\n\nWill be one more archive,\n\nOne more shaky text.\n\n– Gary Snyder\n\nI myself had to undergo the original experience, and, moreover, try to plant the results of my experience in the soil of reality; otherwise they would have remained subjective assumptions without validity.\n\n– C.G. Jung\n\nWhich is worse for your mental health…?\n\nBeing subjected to the pain & suffering of the world.\n\nor\n\nAttempting to ignore it.\n\n– Vince Fakhoury Horn\n\nInstead of waiting until you die, die now. Die now to the personal pronouns; die now to your big ego trip and story of myself and how horrible or how great or wondrous. And by dying now, wake up to the beauty of this moment and realize how much bigger you are than your story.\n\n– Jon Kabat-Zinn\n\nIt’s not ‘cloud seeding’.\n\nIt’s $7,000,000,000,000 a year in fossil fuel subsidies.\n\n– Climate Dad\n\nI don’t think anybody ever knows what another person means when they speak, frankly. It’s more than translation, it’s just throwing yourself into the dark. Language is so very, very personal, private. Weird. I guess you could think of it as translation, that seems like a kind of euphemistic metaphor. It’s probably a lot more hopeless than that. But the effort of speaking as a human is the effort to get past that hopelessness with every sentence.\n\n– Anne Carson\n\nSome people will do a PhD rather than go to therapy.\n\n– @AcademicChatter\n\nthe happiest person in this country cannot help breathing in smokers’ cigarette fumes, auto exhaust, and airborne chemical dust…that happiness can insulate us against the results of our environmental madness is a rumor circulated by our enemies to destroy us.\n\n– Audre Lorde\n\nA tear may be the poetical resume of so many simultaneous impressions, the quintessence of so many opposing thoughts ! It is like a drop of one of those precious elixirs of the East which contain the life of twenty plants fused into a single aroma.\n\n– H.-F. Amiel\n\nGod save us from twentysomethings who’ve recently discovered a System That Explains Everything.\n\n– River Kenna\n\nBabel was a blessing. Each and every language maps a possible world, a possible calendar and landscape.\n\n– George Steiner\n\nMy heaven, my art, became a world beyond, as remote as my love. Everything real became hazy and what is hazy has no definite outlines.\n\n– Karl Marx\n\nAt the bottom of the modern man there is always a great thirst for self-forgetfulness, self-distraction… and therefore he turns away from all those problems and abysses which might recall to him his own nothingness.\n\n– Henri-Frédéric Amiel\n\nSPACE IN THE MIND\n\nWhen there’s space in the mind, the mind relaxes, and we feel a simple sense of delight. We experience the possibility of living a life in which we are not continuously aggravated by emotions, discursiveness, and concepts about the nature of things….\n\nDespite all the ups and downs of our life, we are fundamentally awake individuals who have a natural ability to become compassionate and wise. Our nature is to be cheerful. This cheerfulness is deeper than temporary conditions. The day does not have to be sunny for us to be cheerful.\n\n– Sakyong Mipham Rinpoche\n\nKurt Vonnegut’s 8 rules for writing: ⁣\n\n1. Use the time of a total stranger in such a way that he or she will not feel the time was wasted.⁣ ⁣ 2. Give the reader at least one character he or she can root for.⁣ ⁣\n\n3. Every character should want something, even if it is only a glass of water.⁣ ⁣\n\n4. Every sentence must do one of two things—reveal character or advance the action.⁣ ⁣\n\n5. Start as close to the end as possible.⁣ ⁣\n\n6. Be a sadist. No matter how sweet and innocent your leading characters, make awful things happen to them-in order that the reader may see what they are made of.⁣ ⁣\n\n7. Write to please just one person. If you open a window and make love to the world, so to speak, your story will get pneumonia.⁣ ⁣\n\n8. Give your readers as much information as possible as soon as possible. To hell with suspense. Readers should have such complete understanding of what is going on, where and why, that they could finish the story themselves, should cockroaches eat the last few pages.⁣\n\ni miss the days my friends\n\nknew every mundane detail about my life\n\nand i knew every ordinary detail about theirs\n\nadulthood has starved me of that consistency\n\nthat us\n\nthe walks around the block\n\nthe long conversations when we were\n\ntoo lost in the moment to care what time it was\n\nwhen we won and celebrated\n\nwhen we failed and celebrated harder\n\nwhen we were just kids\n\nnow we have our very important jobs\n\nthat fill up our very busy schedules\n\nwe compare calendars just to plan coffee dates\n\nthat one of us eventually cancels\n\ncause adulthood is being too exhausted\n\nto leave our apartment most days\n\ni miss knowing i once belonged\n\nto a group of people bigger than myself\n\nthat belonging made life easier to live\n\n– Rupi Kaur\n\nMetaphors are not how we define territories; they are how we travel across thresholds between categories. They are bridges across difference. Through them, we connect the abstract and the concrete, the small and the large, the live and the inanimate, the human and the nonhuman. Sometimes the metaphors are built so deeply into language we hardly notice the bodily anatomy that gives mountains foothills, rivers headwaters and mouths (curiously, at opposite ends), needles eyes, vases necks, chairs arms, and tables legs. We think through our bodies, and that includes seeing bodies elsewhere, making bodies the terms of understanding how animate and inanimate, tiny and huge objects and systems work. Both needles and storms have eyes. Metaphor is the process of relating things that are alike in some fashion, to some degree, and the literal-minded object on the grounds of those differences while the metaphorically minded understand the limits of similarity.\n\n– Rebecca Solnit, Crossing Over\n\nAnd we offer each other words of consolation or distraction or encouragement when we see that one or the other of us is in need of such words.\n\n– Javier Marías\n\n…the holy innocence of those who forgive themselves.\n\n– Albert Camus\n\nAnyone whose goal is ‘something higher’ must expect someday to suffer vertigo. What is vertigo? Fear of falling? No, vertigo is something other than fear of falling. It is the voice of the emptiness below us which tempts and lures us, it is the desire to fall, against which, terrified, we defend ourselves.”\n\n– Milan Kundera\n\nI should like to know which is worse… to undergo all the miseries we have each of us suffered — or simply to sit here and do nothing?\n\n– Voltaire\n\nYour supply comes from Infinite Intelligence, you will always be provided for, in both big and little ways.

If you want to be healthy, happy, prosperous, doing a constructive work, having a continuous understanding of God, you do not picture it necessarily, but you think it, feel it, and get interested in it.\n\n– Emmet Fox\n\nYou cannot show me any man or woman who is successful in his field, from president down to shoeblack, who is not interested in his work; nor can you show me any man who has his heart in his work who is not successful.\n\n– Emmet Fox\n\nThere is no algorithm\n\nTo silence our poetry.\n\n– Darryl Barfuss\n\nSome triangles are broken\n\nfrom the start\n\nHearts dangle\n\nVictors guilty\n\nUnruly desires\n\nLove\n\ntoo complex for geometry\n\n– Rachel Newcombe\n\nThe mark of a basic shit\n\nis that he has to\n\nbe right.\n\n– William Burroughs\n\nrain, flower, sea, wind\n\nmap my dark horizon. i\n\ninhale earth’s songbook\n\n– Tyehimba Jess\n\nThe reason I stopped seeing my psychotherapist was that she wanted to talk about how I should get a teaching job, and I knew I wasn’t going to get one.\n\n– Alice Notley\n\nMaking jazz swing in\n\nSeventeen syllables AIN’T\n\nNo square poet’s job.\n\n– Etheridge Knight\n\nChoose the least important day in your life. It will be important enough.\n\n– Thornton Wilder\n\nThe slowing\n\nstream of morning\n\nnews murmurs in his ear.\n\nIt cradles him\n\nin a sound, like some\n\nobject of history.\n\n– John James\n\nBlues Haiku [let me be yo wil]\n\nlet me be yo wil\n\nderness let me be yo wind\n\nblowing you all day.\n\n– Sonia Sanchez\n\nI come weary,\n\nIn search of an inn—\n\nAh!

Fresh and new.\n\n– Eckhart Tolle\n\nThe world is a stage, but the play is badly cast.\n\n– Oscar Wilde\n\nNot what you see, but what you perceive: that’s poetry. Not the noise, but its rhythm; an arrangement of derangements…\n\n– Terrance Hayes\n\nSeven Steps to Heaven Haiku\n\nby Tony Medina\n\nIf every bomb\n\nAppeared in the sky a dove\n\nShrapnel into rain\n\nIf vengeance vanquished\n\nFrom the cursed lips of weak men\n\nAn idea never taking root\n\nIf every tank vanished\n\nIf by chance a miracle\n\nPeace reclaims the land\n\nIf laughter broke out\n\nLike wars fought with satire’s\n\nPugilist punning\n\nWhat room would there be\n\nFor anger what bitter root\n\nNot allowed to stretch\n\nIts tentacles\n\nThrough the hearts of men hardened\n\nBy indifference\n\nWhat will we bequeath\n\nOur children if not a world\n\nEvermore human\n\nindigo bunting\n\nthe birds I see\n\nin my dreams\n\n– @pauldavidmena\n\nThe essay is a true story told with art.\n\n– Brian Doyle\n\nYou begin to realize that the mind is limitless. When I mean the mind, I mean awareness. So this is something that’s not particular to me or you or people who really are devoted to meditation. Everybody, the nature of the human mind is that it’s It’s limitless.\n\n– Jon Kabat-Zinn\n\nBioregional learning is not an option. It’s a necessity.\n\n– Legacy Project\n\nIt is difficult to speak of or to practice love, friendship, generosity, understanding, or solidarity within a system whose rules, goals, and information streams are geared for lesser human qualities. But we try, and we urge you to try.\n\n– Dana Meadows\n\nBABEL\n\nScattered across the islands of the Galápagos archipelago there are half a dozen species of lizard that rely upon a method of communication comprised of what can only be called “push-ups.” When one lizard encounters another, each takes its turn bobbing head and torso up and down in a complex and jerky system of frantic interaction. By this means, lizards of each species establish territorial authority, reinforce social hierarchies, even engage in mating rituals.\n\nIt appears that these lizards evolved from a single species settling the islands from the mainland some 34 million years ago in what scientists have identified as two major waves of colonization. A small “Eastern Radiation” left two species endemic to San Cristóbal and Marchena, while the majority of lizards have come to inhabit the southern and western islands, spreading over time to the younger islands as the older were transported eastward, eventually eroding below sea level.\n\nEach species has developed its own particular vocabulary, its own dialect of body language, to such an extent that each species might be said to “speak a different language.” Suffice it to say, when a lizard from one species encounters a lizard from another, bobbing head and torso up and down in a complex and jerky attempt at frantic interaction, try as they might they cannot understand each other. Lizards from one island are consequently unable to interbreed with lizards from another island. Without communication, it appears, there can be no intercourse.\n\n– Matthew Shelton & Timothy Liu\n\nAt our core, we are devoted to learning. Specifically, we want to learn how to extract as much value as possible from everyone and everything we interact with.\n\n– Andrew Patrick Clark\n\nA little Learning is a dangerous thing;\n\nDrink deep, or taste not the Pierian Spring\n\n– Alexander Pope\n\nSecond Place\n\na string of prayer flags\n\nholding the night breeze\n\n… letting it go\n\n– Chen-ou Liu, Canada\n\nAt best, sometimes I think of myself as a Platonic anarchist. It is not a winning ticket.\n\n– George Steiner\n\nVinegar and milk, sky, ocean,\n\nThe sky’s dense mass,\n\nEverything conspires towards this quivering\n\nLying in the dense heart of darkness.\n\n– Antonin Artaud, (translated by Victor Corti)\n\nAll that we reckoned settled shakes and rattles; and literature, cities, climates, religions, leave their foundations and dance before our eyes.\n\n– Emerson\n\nEvery abyss is navigable by little paper boats.\n\n– João Guimarães Rosa, Tutaméia\n\nWhat I mean of course is that voices on the radio and in politics and public life in general speak a language that marches all too well with the executioners and therefore I, we, must seek a new language that does not collaborate with the executioners.\n\n– Tomas Tranströmer\n\nFruit of the earth, sprout, rise up — and Heaven, pour out the water of life.\n\n– @RedBookJung\n\nI’m so glad you outlasted your worst storms.\n\nYou’re still here.\n\nInstead of constantly looking for rainbows, you decided to became one.\n\n– Dr. Thema\n\nPostactivism is not a project,\n\nit is grace.\n\nA grace that flowers.\n\n– Báyò Akómoláfé\n\nLet us justly appreciate the old opportune Belgian motto: ‘Light bursts forth from the collision of ideas’.\n\n– James Ensor to Albert Einstein\n\nWe unwittingly worship\n\nWhatever we keep\n\nHeld in our unconscious\n\nBring it to light\n\nAnd we intentionally\n\nParticipatory\n\nGet to serve and receive\n\nThe beautiful Life we choose\n\nTo move unconscious material\n\nInto consciousness\n\nIsn’t a vain pursuit\n\nIt is the forfeiting\n\nOf a life as a blind, controllable\n\nPawn\n\nA life as a slave\n\nTo the Stockholm syndrome\n\nOf your own wounds\n\nTo the retrieval of choice,\n\nOf freedom,\n\nOf agency, of power\n\nOf love.\n\nPlease do not\n\nBelieve the stories\n\nOf the darkness within you.\n\nNot one of them is ultimate.\n\nEach just needs\n\nTo be truthfully seen\n\nAnd it will yield to love.\n\n– Chelan Harkin\n\nWithout bravery, we will never be able to realize the vaulting scope of our own capacities. Without bravery, we will never know the world as richly as it longs to be known. Without bravery, our lives will remain small – far smaller than we probably want our lives to be.\n\n– Jack Gilbert\n\nAmor Intellectualis (1878)\n\nby Oscar Wilde\n\nOft have we trod the vales of Castaly\n\nAnd heard sweet notes of sylvan music blown\n\nFrom antique reeds to common folk unknown:\n\nAnd often launched our bark upon that sea\n\nWhich the nine Muses hold in empery,\n\nAnd ploughed free furrows through the wave and foam,\n\nNor spread reluctant sail for more safe home\n\nTill we had freighted well our argosy.\n\nOf which despoilèd treasures these remain,\n\nSordello’s passion, and the honied line\n\nOf young Endymion, lordly Tamburlaine\n\nDriving his pampered jades, and more than these,\n\nThe seven-fold vision of the Florentine,\n\nAnd grave-browed Milton’s solemn harmonies.\n\nThe night is fresh and cool—\n\nStaff in hand, I walk through the gate.\n\nWisteria and ivy grow together along the winding mountain path;\n\nBirds sing quietly in their nests and a monkey howls nearby.\n\nAs I reach a high peak a village appears in the distance.\n\nThe old pines are full of poems;\n\nI bend down for a drink of pure spring water.\n\nThere is a gentle breeze, and the round moon hangs overhead.\n\nStanding by a deserted building,\n\nI pretend to be a crane softly floating among the clouds.\n\n– Ryokan\n\nHe drew forth a phrase from his treasure and spoke it softly to himself: —A day of dappled seaborne clouds. The phrase and the day and the scene harmonised in a chord. Words. Was it their colours? He allowed them to glow and fade, hue after hue: sunrise gold, the russet and green of apple orchards, azure of waves, the greyfringed fleece of clouds. No, it was not their colours: it was the poise and balance of the period itself. Did he then love the rhythmic rise and fall of words better than their associations of legend and colour? Or was it that, being as weak of sight as he was shy of mind, he drew less pleasure from the reflection of the glowing sensible world through the prism of a language manycoloured and richly storied than from the contemplation of an inner world of individual emotions mirrored perfectly in a lucid supple periodic prose?\n\n– James Joyce\n\nParadoxically, the moment of utter defeat can be the traditional turning point in the journey. It is the moment when all conscious strategems have failed, the ego abdicates, and deeper forces of life may make their appearance.\n\n– Marc Ian Barasch\n\nOne does not become fully human painlessly.\n\n– Rollo May\n\nIf the injustice is part of the necessary friction of the machine of government, let it go, let it go: perchance it will wear smooth–certainly the machine will wear out… but if it is of such a nature that it requires you to be the agent of injustice to another, then I say, break the law. Let your life be a counter-friction to stop the machine. What I have to do is to see, at any rate, that I do not lend myself to the wrong which I condemn.\n\n– Henry David Thoreau\n\nMost of us identify ourselves with something – with the family, with the country, with an idea, with a belief – hoping thereby to forget our petty little selves.\n\n– Krishnamurti\n\nRepetition is the ritual of obsession. Repetition is a way to jumpstart the indecision of beginning. To persevere and to begin over and over again is to continue the obsession with work. Work comes out of work. In order to work you must already be working.\n\n– Richard Serra\n\nI border still on a word and on a different land,\n\nI border, like little else, on everything more and more.\n\n– Ingeborg Bachmann (translated by Mark Anderson)\n\nPoets utter great and wise things which they do not themselves understand.\n\n– Plato\n\nLetting go means falling behind the energy instead of going into it. It just takes a moment of conscious effort to decide that you’re not going there. You just let go. It’s simply a matter of taking the risk that you are better off letting go than going with the energy.\n\n– Michael Singer\n\nWe cannot be present and run our story-line at the same time.\n\n– Pema Chodron\n\nIn an age in which the media broadcast countless pieces of foolishness, the educated man is defined not by what he knows, but by what he doesn’t know.\n\n– Nicolas Gomez Davila\n\nThe same eyes\n\nthat fix on us\n\nwere closed before\n\nThe same ears\n\nthat eavesdrop\n\nwere shut before\n\nThe hounds\n\nsniffing for blood now\n\ncared not when we were bleeding\n\n– Grace Tame, Hard Pressed\n\nWith every piece of advice,\n\nconsider sometimes the\n\nopposite is equally true.\n\n– Rick Rubin\n\nheavy traffic\n\nto my nearside\n\nrooks amid cowslips\n\n– James Gilbert\n\nI moved my chair into sun\n\nI sat in the sun\n\nthe way hunger is moved when called fasting.\n\n– Jane Hirshfield\n\nIn guarding their fortune men are often closefisted, yet, when it comes to the matter of wasting time, in the case of the one thing in which it is right to be miserly, they show themselves most prodigal.\n\n– Seneca\n\nTo Be a Good Buddhist Is Ensnarement\n\nThe Zen priest says I am everything I am not.\n\nIn order to stop resisting, I must not attempt to stop resisting.\n\nI must believe there is no need to believe in thoughts.\n\nOblivious to appetites that appear to be exits, and also entrances.\n\nWhat is there to hoard when the worldly realm has no permanent vacancies?\n\n"
