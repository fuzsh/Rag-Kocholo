        "text": "The Tenure of Elsbeth Anne Roth\n\nAisha bint Asad Ud-Din. Device. Or, a sexfoil within the Arabic words \"Kaana Khafi bishshawkihi Jamaaiat-il-Wardata\" in annulo gules.\n\nNo translation was including for the Arabic words. Without evidence of what the phrase means, this cannot be registered. (06/23/1999)\n\nAarnimetsä, Barony of. Badge. Argent, on a bend sable three Bowen knots palewise argent.\n\nConflict with Diego Miguel Munoz de Castilla, Argent, on a bend sable three escallops palewise argent, and George of Berwick, Argent, on a bend sable, three double roses argent, barbed vert. In each case there is only one CD for substantially changing the type of the tertiaries. (09/1999)\n\nAaron MacGregor. Device. Per bend bendy argent and gules and sable, a sinister hand argent.\n\nConflict with Kenric Manning, Lozengy azure and Or, a hand argent, registered September, 2000. There is not a CD between a dexter hand and a sinister hand, therefore there is only a single CD for the change to the field. (10/2000)\n\nAbigail Chandler of Caithness. Name.\n\nThe documentation was not adequately summarized on the LoI: it is not sufficient to say that a name element is found in a book; we need to know what is said. While the College provided independent evidence for some elements they did not do so for the locative. We therefore have to return this as per the May LoAR cover letter. (03/2001)\n\nAdam Stedefast. Device. Per chevron azure and sable, a phoenix Or rising from flames proper issuant from the line of division and a rose argent.\n\nThe flames should not extend along the entire line of division, but should be only under the phoenix's body and slightly beyond. By extending to the edge, the flames appear to be a chevron of flame, which is not allowed. In addition, while not a reason for return, the per chevron line should extend higher onto the field. (07/2000)\n\nAdele Krin of Malagentia. Device. Quarterly, purpure and argent, a cross patee botonny counterchanged.\n\nNo documentation was provided that such a cross, which looks like a cross bottony with added flanges, was a reasonable variant of period crosses. (07/1999)\n\nAdele Krin. Device. Quarterly purpure and argent, a cross formy and bottony counterchanged.\n\nWe can do no better than quote Brachet:\n\nLooking at the drawing in Foster, it seems to me likely that the blazon is happenstantial and this is just a fancy drawing of a cross bottony. Note that the drawings in Foster are not period drawings, they are 19th C. work by the author.\n\nA bit more research proves confusing. Anglo-Norman Armory II, C. Humphery-Smith, p309 blazons the cross of John Benstede (from the Falkirk Roll) as ... a cross clechy voided and bottony argent (and each convex intersection of the cross clechy has a small trefoil attached!) Brault, in Eight Rolls of Arms, p89, gives the blazon from the Thevet version of the Falkirk Roll as \"87. Sir John de Benestede port la croys perce' et patee et botonee d'argent.\" (There are no emblazons in Brault.) In the notes it says that the tincture of the field is missing in both copies of the roll. Looking at the rest of the roll the blazon is peculiar in several respects, not the least of which is the lack of field. If different authorities in different books have vastly different interpretations, enough to change the recorded blazon in the case of Cecil H-Smith, it seems to me that this is good evidence that this cross is a one-off period weirdness.\n\nThe appeal, therefore, is denied. (08/2000)\n\nAdele Krin. Device. Quarterly purpure and argent, a cross formy and botonny counterchanged.\n\nThis was returned in the August 2000 LoAR. (11/2000)\n\nAdelheid von Katzenellenbogen. Badge. Gyronny Or and sable, an ermine spot counterchanged.\n\nThe counterchanging of the ermine spot rendered it unidentifiable. In general one should avoid counterchanging over a gyronny field. (01/2000)\n\nAdelicia of Caithness. Name.\n\nThe documentation was not adequately summarized on the LoI: it is not sufficient to say that a name element is found on a book, we need to know what is said. As the College did not provide independent evidence, we have to return this as per the May LoAR cover letter.\n\nAdella de Tourlaville. Device. Argent, on a nesselblatt azure, a single-headed chess knight argent.\n\nConflict with Mielikki Kantelensoittajatar, Argent, on a nesselblatt azure a lion rampant contourny Or, foreleg armored and brandishing a sword argent. There is only a single CD for the changes to the charges on the nesselblatt. (07/2001)\n\nAdrian Dragon and Claudia von Lübeck. Joint badge. Argent, a dragon segreant purpure.\n\nThe badge has a number of conflicts, including Minimoto Akataro, reblazoned elsewhere in this letter, Argent, a dragon segreant vert maintaining a Latin cross bottony Or, Deirdre McLair, Argent, two dragons combattant purpure, maintaining an arrow inverted vert, and Angelica of Bohemia, Per bend argent and bendy purpure and argent, in chief a dragon courant bendwise purpure. Against Akataro, there a CD for the tincture of the dragon, but nothing for the removal of the maintained charge. Against Deirdre, there is a CD for the number of primary charges, but again nothing for the removal of the maintained charge. Against Angelica, there is a CD for the field, but nothing for the forced change of position on the field, and there is also not a difference between segreant and courant bendwise. (10/2000)\n\nAdriana Kavanaugh. Device. Vert, a chevron ployé between two feathers bendwise sinister and an open scroll argent.\n\nConflict with Caitlyn Emrys, Vert, a chevron between three peacocks pavonated to base argent, and Harrys Rob of Wamphray, Vert, a chevron between three winged spurs argent. In both cases there is only a single CD for the type of the secondary charges. (04/2000)\n\nAdriana Lynette Noel. Device. Per bend argent and Or, a cross parted and fretted purpure between in bend sinister two penguins respectant proper.\n\nThe penguins are unidentifiable. One of the reasons that they are unidentifiable is that they appear to be in a rampant posture; rampant is not an allowable posture for birds. (11/2000)\n\nAdriano Veneziani. Device. Azure goutty d'eau, on an bird facing sinister displayed Or a cross of Cleves sable.\n\nThe charge was originally blazoned as a phoenix and reblazoned at Kingdom as an eagle. The actual depiction is neither one nor the other, but is in fact a modern stylized drawing which blurs the two. Thus this violates RfS VIII.4.d, Obtrusive Modernity (Modern Style) as well as RfS VIII.3, Armorial Identifiability. (06/2000)\n\nAdriona Nichole la rousse de Beauvoir. Name and device. Purpure, a schnecke issuant from sinister chief argent charged with a rose gules, slipped and leaved vert, in dexter chief and in base two fleurs-de-lys argent.\n\nAdrion is not in the article cited in the LoI. Further, Nichole is only documented from the 13th century, before double given names appeared. As she does not allow us to drop the first given name we have to return this.\n\nThere are two reasons for returning the device. First, on the large emblazon the charge in chief was still closer to a rosebud than a rose. Second, as we know of no period examples of schneckes with secondary or tertiary charges, we find the use of both in this device to be two steps beyond period practice. We may allow secondary or tertiary charges with a schnecke, but we doubt that the use of either is period practice. (11/2000)\n\nAedh Finn mac Cormaic. Name.\n\nNo forms were sent to Laurel. (11/2000)\n\nÆdla æt Fiendwic. Name.\n\nThe byname is intended to mean \"of Enemy's Camp.\" The only justification for this byname is a citation from an Anglo-Saxon dictionary, but no evidence was provided to support a place name with this kind of meaning. The College did not provide such evidence either; on the contrary, commenters felt this was not consistent with Anglo-Saxon naming practice. (07/2001)\n\nÁengus Ó Dubhghaill. Name.\n\nThis conflicts with Angus MacDougall, registered 6/91. (10/2000)\n\nAeron Aschennen of Clan MacKenzie. Name change from Anastacia de Maris and device change. Barry bendy azure and argent, a mantyger rampant guardant Or maintaining a roundel azure .\n\nAs noted before, Hanks and Hodges is a particularly poor source for period names. According to Metron Ariston, Aeron appears in some sources as the name of a Welsh battle goddess and it is certainly the name of a river in Wales; however, no one has been able to find it as a given name for a human in period. Furthermore, the construction of Clan X has been disallowed since June 1998. As the submitter does not allow major changes we have to return this.\n\nThe primary charge is a misdrawn mantyger. A mantyger has a human head, while this is a lion's head with a human face. Therefore, it conflicts with Belgium, Sable, a lion rampant Or , and various others of the form <Field>, a lion rampant Or . (05/2000)\n\nÆthelmearc, Kingdom of. Order name Order of the Caltrop.\n\nThe name conflicts with Caltrop Pursuivant, which is registered to the Kingdom of Calontir. Æthelmearc has a letter to conflict from the King and Queen of Calontir. However, current practice allows someone owning Order of the X to use X Pursuivant and vice versa. Therefore two such items are effectively identical. Since we cannot register two identical items even with permission, the order name must be returned. (10/1999)\n\nÆthelmearc, Kingdom of. Order name The Order of the Grand Caltrop.\n\nWithdrawn by the submitting kingdom. (11/2000)\n\nAgnes van Kouwenhoven. Name.\n\nThe byname was dated to 1652, which is beyond our gray area. While van Berkel and Samplonius, Nederlandse plaatsnamen, mention the place name Coudenhove in 1585, the submitter requested an authentic German name, more specifically one from Saxony. We are therefore reluctant to give her a Dutch one. (07/2000)\n\nAidan of Aran. Device. Per bend sinister argent and sable, a bird displayed and a pig statant, a bordure counterchanged.\n\nThis is returned for a redraw. As drawn, neither the pig nor the martlet was identifiable as such. In addition, please instruct the submitter to draw the bordure wider in future submissions. (01/2001)\n\nAilionora Caointiarn. Name.\n\nAilionora and Caointiarn are both Irish feminine given names. We know of no examples of Irish names consisting of two given names. Nor can we make the second name a metronymic. There is no evidence that metronymics were used in Ireland; the only examples found involved genealogies of royalty whose claim to royalty involved descent through the female line. We recommend that Ailionora choose a name for her father and form a name from that.\n\nHer armory was registered under the name Ailionora of Tir Ysgithr. (02/2000)\n\nAindrea Gille Eoghainn. Device. Sable, a reremouse dormant dependent from an annulet argent.\n\nThe bat was not dormant, but was rather in its natural sleeping posture. We know of no examples of this posture in period heraldic depictions of bats, and for good reason: this posture eliminates any identifiable aspects of the bat. Therefore the device violates VIII.4.c, Natural Depiction: ... Excessively natural designs include those that depict animate objects in unheraldic postures ... and VIII.3, Armorial Identifiability. (08/2000)\n\nAislynn Crystyn. Badge. (Fieldless) A card-pique inverted Or.\n\nConflict with the badge for the Gilded Leaf of Caerthe (Barony of Caerthe), Sable, an aspen leaf inverted Or. There is no difference between an aspen leaf and a card pique inverted, as there is no evidence that the charges were considered different in period (in particular, there is no evidence that the aspen leaf was used as a charge in period), and visually the two charges are almost identical. Therefore, there is only 1 CD for fieldlessness. This is clear of Constance le Royer de la Tour, Azure, a tower argent issuant from a heart Or, because the tower and the heart are clearly co-primaries. (06/2000)\n\nAislynn the Wanderer. Device. Per pale purpure and sable, a dragonfly Or.\n\nConflict with Maol Anna de Chassant, Per fess sable and gules, a dragonfly Or. There is only one CD for the changes to the field. (09/2000)\n\nAkilli Asian Sarolta. Name change from holding name Sarolta of Tir Ysgithr.\n\nThis name has several problems. First, Hurrem/Roxelana, cited in the submission, was known by her original Russian name only to the West; to Turks, she was known by the Turkish harem name. Combining the two names seems to be restricted to modern history books.\n\nSecond, an epithet is not acceptable simply because a native speaker says so; modern-day people do not normally have that kind of knowledge about period naming practices. Third, Sarolta is incompatible with the rest of the name: it is only known from 10th century Hungary, and by the time of the Turkish invasion, pagan-era Hungarian female names had already disappeared. (07/2000)\n\nAlail Horsefriend. Device change. Vert, a horse rampant contourny argent crined Or.\n\nConflict with Mary Felix the Fool, Vert, two zebras combattant argent, striped sable. By precedent \"there is...nothing for the stripes on the zebra. (Elsbeth Anne Roth, LoAR March 2000, p 12), so there is only a single CD for number of primary charges. (03/2001)\n\nAlatheia Fenwick Campbell. Device. Quarterly vert and sable, a sun in splendour argent.\n\nThe device has multiple conflicts, including Aelfwine Denedom, Quarterly vert and sable, a mullet of four points throughout argent. There is a CD for changing the type of the primary charge, but a sun and a mullet (of any number of points) are not substantially different; therefore we cannot call the two devices clear by RfS X.2 Difference of Primary Charge. (06/2001)\n\nAlatheia the Harper. Device. Per bend sinister Or and sable, two winged harps counterchanged.\n\nIn general, winged objects should have a pair of wings which are of equivalent size to the main charge. There is only one wing on each of these harps, and the wing is far too small and badly formed. While the use of a single wing may be acceptable, the combination of a single wing and an unusually small one is not. It is also likely that the size itself would be cause for return. (06/2000)\n\nAleksandr the Traveller. Device change. Per pale vert and Or.\n\nConflict with Ædric the Grene, Per pale sable and vert. Rfs X.4.a.ii.b, Complete Change of Tincture, requires that the two pieces of armory share no tincture in common. Therefore there is only a single difference for changing half the field. (06/2001)\n\nAleksandra von Drachenklaue. Name.\n\nMixing Russian and German, while not very plausible, is registerable under our rules. The byname was documented from a web site titled Magische Welt Ija Marcar, under Der dritte interaktive Netzroman. That is, \"The Magical World Ija Marcar\", \"The Third Interactive Net Novel\". While fantasy novels are not acceptable as documentation, a case was made for the byname as a hypothetical constructed locative as well. However, no forms were sent to Laurel, so we have to return the name. (11/2000)\n\nAlexander le Browere. Device. Per pale sable and vert, a serpent involved in annulo Or.\n\nThe device conflicts with Vladimir Vitalieich Volkov, Per pale argent ermined purpure and purpure an annulet Or. There is one CD for the field but nothing for involved serpent vs. annulet. (07/1999)\n\nAlexandra de la Mer Verte. Badge. (Fieldless) A griffin segreant maintaining a sword vert.\n\nConflict with the badge for Margaret Holmwood (Étaín Dhomhnullach), A gryphon segreant, its dexter forepaw gauntleted and maintaining a sprig of three holly leaves vert, fructed gules. There is no difference for the maintained charges, thus only a single CD for fieldlessness. (02/2000)\n\nAlexandria nic Alleyn. Name.\n\nOf the Scots variants of Alan, the -eyn spellings are all in French constructions and thus not be appropriate in a Gaelic byname construction. As she does not allow us to make spelling corrections we have to return this. Either Alexandria nic Allayn or Alexandria Alleyn would be possible. The submission was made on forms dated A.S. XXV. Please note that all submissions should by now be on the new ones.\n\nHer device has been registered under the holding name Alexandria of Calontir. (06/2000)\n\nAlianore de Harcourt. Device. Or semy of gillyflowers gules seeded Or, on a pile invected azure a unicorn rampant argent.\n\nThe device has two problems, requiring that it be returned for redrawing. First, the flowers are unidentifiable as to type; gillyflowers are identified by their \"pinked\" edges, which are not visible in this device. Second, the unicorn had some identifiability issues; it had no beard and the type of hooves was hard to discern. (06/2001)\n\nAlicia d'Avignon. Name change from Alicia of Greyhill.\n\nThis name conflicts with that of Alix d'Avignon, registered in July of 1985. (07/2000)\n\nAlina Marie de Valenciennes. Device. Per bend gules and sable, a bend between a sun in his splendour and a lions head cabossed Or.\n\nConflict with Christopher of Lions' Nest, Per bend gules and sable, a bend between a winged lion passant guardant to sinister and a raffia-covered wine bottle Or. There is only a single CD for the change of type of the secondary charges. (04/2000)\n\nAlisandre Oliphant. Badge. (Fieldless) A rose purpure barbed and seeded proper .\n\nConflict with Alyanora of Vinca, Argent a periwinkle (vinca minor) proper . Periwinkles are bluish purple and by current precedent (see the September 1996 LoAR, pg. 17, s.n. Rosalyn MacGregor) they are not significantly different from either blue or purple roses. (05/2000)\n\nAlmaith ingen Chormaic. Household name House of the Golden Hunter.\n\nNo documentation was provided as to why this would be a period inn name construction. (05/2000)\n\nAl-Mufassir Ibrahim ibn Abi Cali Mahmud Al-Fatimi. Name.\n\nSubmitted on the LoI in this form, Cali seems to be a misreading of Ali. Even so, the documentation of this name had several problems, and while none of them would in itself be grounds for return, the combination is not registerable.\n\nUsing the kunya of ones father as a part of the name, such as Abi Ali here, seems to have been rare enough to be considered a weirdness, at least when followed by fathers ism, in this case Mahmud.\n\nMahmud itself is a Turkish form of Muhammad, unattested in an Arabic context. While registerable as a part of an Arabic name it is also a weirdness.\n\nFinally, al-Mufassir is essentially an occupational byname. As such it should normally appear either as the final element or right before the final element. Its position at the beginning of the name is a weirdness as well.\n\nThe first weirdness would be corrected by dropping either abi Ali or Mahmud, the second by changing Mahmud to Muhammad and the third by moving al-Mufassir to the end of the name. As the submitter requested an authentic name we would have changed the name to Ibrahim ibn Muhammad al-Fatimi al-Mufassir (note that al- is not capitalised), although the name would have been registerable after correcting only two of the three problems. However, as the submitter does not allow major changes we cannot drop name elements or change their languages; therefore we cannot correct the first two weirdnesses but must return the name instead. (06/2001)\n\nAlroth Himmel von Arkesleve. Name and Device. Argent, a chevron sable between two mermaids each maintaining a sword and a crescent azure.\n\nEach of the name elements is documented as a place name. Since there is no given name, we have to return this. As he does not allow the creation of a holding name, the armory must be returned as well.\n\nThe device originally blazoned the mermaids as respectant, but that implies that their bodies are in profile as well. There is no way to indicate in the blazon that the tails are symmetrical; the direction of the tail is normally artistic license and not blazoned. (07/2001)\n\nAlthea ni Cullogh. Name change from Alatheia McCullaugh.\n\nNo documentation was provided for the given name. We would have changed it to a similar-sounding name dated in Withycombes The Oxford Dictionary of English Christian Names to 1606. Since she requested an authentic name we would have changed the byname to a wholly Anglicized form as well. These changes, however, would have resulted in her currently registered name. (02/2001)\n\nAlycie Stirling. Device. Gules, a ferret statant argent.\n\nConflict with Rima of Rockridge, Gules, an ermine statant guardant proper, with no CD's for tincture (ermines are primarily white) or the position of the head. The device is also in conflict with the badge for Brittany, An ermine passant argent marked sable. There is only a CD for fieldlessness. (04/2000)\n\nAlys Wallas. Device. Vert, on a bend Or a ferret statant embowed sable.\n\nConflict with David of Moorland, Vert, on a bend Or three Moor's heads couped sable. There is only one CD for the changes to the tertiaries. (06/2000)\n\nAn Gearasdan Òir, Stronghold of. Branch name and device. Per pale vert and azure, in pale a laurel wreath argent and two daffodils slipped in saltire, a chief embattled Or.\n\nGearasdan \"garrison\" appears to be a loan word from English. The College found only one instance of this word in 1598, but there is no evidence that it was used in period place names and some doubt as to whether the word itself was used at that time to refer to a physical structure. The most typical way to say what the submitters want would be Dun an Óir, but unfortunately there is already a Barony of Dun Or.\n\nThe submitters might consider either caiseal or ráth, both meaning \"ring fort\"; either Caiseal na Óir or Ráth na Óir would be reasonable place names with a meaning very close to that desired.\n\nAs we cannot form holding names for groups, the armory must be returned as well. (07/2001)\n\nAn Tir, Kingdom of. Badge. Sable, a maunch argent within a bordure countercompony Or and argent.\n\nThe device violates Rule RfS VIII.2.b, Contrast Requirements, with a bordure divided into multiple parts of two metals. The kingdom asked that this be registered under the Grandfather Clause (RfS VII.8), given that their device plus a number of their badges has a field checky Or and argent, and furthermore they have one badge with a checky charge, On a heart checky Or and argent, a rose slipped and leaved sable. RfS VII.8, however, indicates that the extension of motifs used in already registered armory is very limited: Only the actual armorial element from the originally registered submission may be covered by this permission. For example, if an individual had registered armory containing a fimbriated lion many years ago, only that fimbriated lion would be covered under this rule, not fimbriated wolves, eagles, or lions in other postures. This means that the kingdom can registered fields and hearts checky Or and argent, but not general charges. Furthermore, the allowance only applies to checky, not other multiply divided fields. While countercompony is similar to checky, it is not the same field division. (10/2000)\n\nAnastasia Gutane. Device. Purpure, a chevron inverted ermine between three weasels couchant guardant argent.\n\n\"The chevron [inverted] should not intersect the corners of the chief\" (Baldwin of Erebor, LoAR 7 July 1986, p. 6). The device needs to be redrawn with the ordinary issuing from the sides of the shield. (10/1999)\n\nAnastasia of Whispering Oaks. Name.\n\nThis was an appeal of the October 1999 registration of Anastasia of the Oaks. The submitter argues that since there have been five registrations of bynames of the form of [the] Whispering X the construction should be considered SCA compatible.\n\nUnfortunately for the submitter, none of these earlier registrations are of [the] Whispering Oaks. They also are all at least seven years old. Given these considerations, we would require a substantially larger number of prior registrations. (06/2001)\n\nAnastasiia Novgorodskaia. Device. Per chevron wavy sable and azure, a decrescent, an increscent, and a sea-griffin argent.\n\nThe contrast between the two halves of the field is so low that the line of division is not distinguishable. Past Laurels have returned extremely low-contrast lines of division even when there is not an overall charge (for an example, see the return of Isabel dAvignons device, June 1997 LoAR). Please inform the submitter that if she must have a sea-griffin, it should have prominent ears to distinguish it from a sea-eagle (not that the difference is sufficient for a CD). (10/1999)\n\nAndela Romier. Badge. (Fieldless) A mouse sejant ululant to sinister argent.\n\nWhile we allow wolves and foxes to be ululant, the head posture is an SCA invention. It is possible that had the head posture been introduced today we would not allow it. Allowing ululant wolves is a step beyond period practice; allowing anything but canines to use the position is two steps beyond period practice and therefore grounds for return. (12/2000)\n\nAnders Botman. Device. Vert, an owl displayed wings inverted argent.\n\nBy current precedent, there is not a CD between an owl displayed and an eagle displayed. Therefore, this device has multiple conflicts, including Poland (important real-world arms), Gules, an eagle displayed argent crowned Or, and the badge for the Shire of Adlersruhe, Vert, an eagle displayed, wings inverted and a base argent. Against Poland, there is not a CD for the removal of the crown; therefore, there is only a single CD for the change of the field. Against Aldersruhe, there is only a single CD for removing the base.\n\nThis is clear of Sebastian Alexander Stormmane, Sable, an owl displayed argent holding on its breast a rose gules. As depicted, the rose is effectively a tertiary charge, so there is a CD for the change to the field plus a second for removing the tertiary charge. (03/2001)\n\nAndrés Miguel Rodriguez de la Rosa. Device. Checky azure and Or, a tierce sable, overall a winged rabbit rampant maintaining a rapier argent.\n\nThere is long standing precedent against having charges overlie a peripheral charge. \"It was ruled some five years ago that flaunches should not be surmounted by charges (Wilhelm von Schlüssel, April, 1983) and we see no reason to reverse that ruling.\" (Alisoun MacCoul of Elphane, LoAR 23 April 1988, p. 16). Barring evidence that such was done in period, we see no reason to overturn this precedent. We also see no reason to classify a tierce as a field division barring solid evidence that period heralds considered them as such. (07/1999)\n\nAndrew Hawoc. Name.\n\nThis is in conflict with Andreas Hak, registered December 1980. The given names are variants of each other, and not quite different enough to be clear; the bynames are in aural conflict. (11/2000)\n\nAndrew Macleod. Name.\n\nThis is in aural conflict with Aindrea MacLeod, registered in May 1994. (07/2001)\n\nAndrew of Theodford. Device. Or, a cross quadrate couped checky gules and azure within a bordure sable.\n\nThe device violates Rule VIII.2.b.iv, Contrast Requirements. A checky charge must have good contrast between the two tinctures. Furthermore, please instruct the submitter to draw the arms of the cross significantly longer; many members of the College of Arms were unable to identify the charge. (07/2000)\n\nAndrew Quintero. Device. Azure, on a pale wavy argent a feather gules.\n\nFrom the July 1992 LoAR, p.17: \"This sort of wavy ordinary, with the waves opposed instead of parallel (wavy bretessed instead of wavy-counter-wavy), was returned on the LoAR of Dec 91 as a non-period depiction.\" Andrews device has the same problem. In addition, the pale is too wide. (09/1999)\n\nAndrew Talbot. Badge. (Fieldless) On a cross moline argent fimbriated gules, a lions head contourny sable.\n\nThis is being returned for violating the precedent set by Bruce Draconarius of Mistholme as Laurel (January 15, 1993, cover letter) concerning which charges are suitable for fimbriation. A cross moline is too complex to fimbriate. Note that being fieldless is not itself a reason to return a fimbriated charge; while the fimbriation is not needed to avoid a contrast problem, it is nevertheless a valid design feature. (07/1999)\n\nAndronicus Ursacor. Change of name and badge. Barry wavy argent and vert, a griffin segreant contourny gules.\n\nThere was no documentation indicating that a byname which is possibly justifiable in Middle English could be used for a Latin byname. Metron Ariston recommends the cognomen Ursus and we pass on the recommendation.\n\nThe badge conflicts with Garth ap Ronan, Quarterly argent and sable, a griffin segreant to sinister gules. There is just one CD for the field. (07/1999)\n\nAneala, Barony of. Badge. (Fieldless) A bezant voided of a two headed swan displayed heads respectant.\n\nThe voiding here is essentially an attempt to use a tinctureless (or rather, omni-tinctured) tertiary charge. Such have been disallowed for some time. In returning A cross pierced of a mullet Daud ibn Auda wrote, as Laurel: \"It is true that we have registered fieldless badges consisting of a charge which has been pierced or voided, but in these cases the piercing/voiding was part of the definition of the charge (e.g., a mascle, a rustre) and can hardly be considered as being in the same category as cross pierced of an (omni-tinctured) mullet.\" (January 1996, pg. 27 (Anlon MacMatha, Calontir))\n\nIn addition, this badge uses a plain line charged roundel on a fieldless badge, a practice that has been disallowed since Baldwin of Erebors tenure as Laurel. (07/1999)\n\nAngelica Blauschild. Device. Azure, a pair of wings argent conjoined by a Hungerford knot Or, pendant from the knot a needle and a quill pen argent, a bordure ermine.\n\nThe device has a complexity count of nine, which is over the rule-of-thumb limit. While we sometimes register armory with this complexity count, those cases follow patterns of period complex armory, which this device does not. Furthermore the needle and quill pen were unidentifiable.\n\nIn any resubmissions, if the wings must be joined by a knot, please drawn the knot substantially thicker. (08/2000)\n\nAngus de Botha. Device. Argent, three roses sable.\n\nConflict with Kaie Haraldson, Or, three cinquefoils sable. There is a CD for the field, but nothing for the difference between a cinquefoil and a rose. (07/2001)\n\nAnita de Challis. Device. Gules, a schnecke issuant from sinister chief argent, on a chief Or, a xonecuilli fesswise gules.\n\nThe only registrations of a xonecuilli were to John the Idiota in 1978 and again by him in 1982. It is listed in the Pictorial Dictionary as an Aztec artistic motif. We no longer register artistic motifs even from European sources without evidence that they are compatible with heraldry. Therefore we declare that the xonecuilli is no longer registerable barring evidence that it is compatible with medieval heraldic style. (02/2000)\n\nAnna Graham of Montrose. Name and device. Azure, a bend sinister wavy between a horseshoe and a thistle Or.\n\nSubmitted as Anna Graham of Montrose. While adding of Montrose clears the earlier conflict with Hannah Graham it adds the new problem that the Graham chiefs are also the Dukes (originally Earls) of Montrose. This means that the submitted name would have been used only by a member of the immediate family of the clan chief and is thus presumptuous. As the submitter doesn't allow us to drop Graham, we have to return this.\n\nThe device conflicts with Miriam of Gateacre, Azure, a bend sinister wavy between two Lacy knots Or. There is only a single CD for the change of type of the secondary charges. (04/2000)\n\nAnna Mactaggart. Device. Per bend sinister argent and gules, a dragon sejant erect and a winged maiden counterchanged.\n\nThe maiden is not in any blazonable posture. (12/1999)\n\nAnna Ridley. Device change. Per saltire vert and azure, a saltire floretty throughout argent.\n\nConflict with Annalia Dragotta, Per saltire vert and azure, a saltire tripartite and fretted argent. There is only one CD for the type of the saltire. (03/2000)\n\nAnne Cary. Name.\n\nThis name conflicts with the real-world opera singer Annie Louise Cary, 1841-1921, found in Encyclopaedia Britannica. (08/2000)\n\nAnne Mary Quinn. Device. Per bend sinister gules and azure, a swan naiant contourny and a sun Or.\n\nConflict with Johann Kiefer Hayden, Per bend sinister gules and azure, two owls contourny Or. While there is a CD between a swan and an owl, there is not the substantial difference between the two birds needed for X.2 to hold. Therefore, there is but a single CD for a change of type of the primary charges. (11/2000)\n\nAnthony of Beaumaris. Device. Per pall inverted argent, sable, and azure, two falcons striking respectant counterchanged and a castle argent.\n\nConflict with Chad Silverswan, Per pall inverted argent, sable and azure, two swans rousant respectant counterchanged and a Latin cross argent. There is a CD for the type of all the primaries, but there is not a CD for the change in posture between rousant and striking. Furthermore, swans and falcons, while significantly different, are not substantially different therefore we cannot call the two pieces of armory clear by RfS X.2, Difference of Primary Charges. (05/2001)\n\nAntoinette la Rouge d'Avignon. Household name La Compagnie des Liouns Erraunte.\n\nNo evidence was provided as to why \"Company of the Errant Lions\" (or \"Company of the Itinerant Strong\") would be a reasonable period name for an organized group of people. (07/2001)\n\nAnton Cwith. Name.\n\nNo forms were sent to Laurel. (11/2000)\n\nAntwerp, City of. Device. Gules, a walled city and in chief a pair of hands in chevron inverted argent.\n\nThis was ruled not important enough to protect in June, 1995 with the following comments: Though the city itself is important in later period, and its arms relate to the legend of how the city received its name, the arms do not otherwise appear to be of sufficient importance for us to protect them. No additional evidence was presented to lead us to change that decision. (12/2000)\n\nAntwerp, Margraviate of. Device. Per fess Or and gules, in chief a double-headed eagle displayed sable and in base a walled city beneath a pair of hands in chevron inverted argent.\n\nNo evidence was given that the Margraviate of Antwerp was an independent entity, nor that it is otherwise important enough or familiar enough to protect. See the Cover Letter for more details. (12/2000)\n\nAodhnait Máire Siobhàn ní Nuanáin. Device change. Per pale azure and vert, a cat sejant argent striped sable maintaining a needle argent threaded Or.\n\nConflict with Jordre Pargon of Windhover's Reach, Azure, a snow leopard sejant argent, spotted sable, and Louis-Philippe Mitourard, Per bend sinister gules and azure, a striped silver tabby cat sejant guardant proper. There is no difference given for the change in the markings or for the maintained needle, so there is only a single CD for the field. (01/2000)\n\nAonghas Cu. Device. Or, on a pale azure a tree argent.\n\nConflict with Elspeth of the Wood, Vert, on a pale azure, fimbriated, an oak tree Or. There is a CD for the field, but Aonghas' tree, though blazoned as a fir tree, was drawn round enough that we could not call it significantly different from Elspeth's oak tree. (02/2000)\n\nArabella Silvermane. Device. Per pale gules and sable, a griffin segreant maintaining an axe Or.\n\nConflict with Degary Golafre of Pembroke, Quarterly sable and gules, a griffin segreant coward bearing in her dexter talon a Celtic cross and in her sinister talon a sword inverted Or. There is a CD for the field but nothing for changing the maintained charges and nothing for the tail position. (02/2000)\n\nArcturius Aleator. Device. Or, a die vert marked Or.\n\nWhile dice were shown in perspective, the known period examples depicted them face forward, rather than edge forward. This minimizes the effect of perspective. Therefore, we must return this device for redrawing. (04/2000)\n\nAriadne la Noire. Device. Sable, three swans rousant wings displayed within a bordure Or.\n\nThe original submission was returned for redrawing, as it blurred the distinction between rousant and displayed. The posture of the swans in the current submission is identical to the previous submission, except that it is less clearly drawn, and therefore the device must be returned again for redrawing. (11/1999)\n\nArianna Katzenfreunde die Wissbegierige. Name.\n\nThe submitter stated that Katzenfreunde was found in Bahlow, Deutsches Namenlexikon, under Katz, but the word is found there only has a possible derivation for Katz, not as a name. The submitter should also be informed that Wissbegierige, inquisitive, is an unlikely descriptive epithet, being both overly complex and overly abstract.\n\nHer armory was registered under the name Arianna of Atenveldt. (04/2000)\n\nArianwen ferch Arthur. Device. Quarterly azure and argent, four ounces sejant counterchanged.\n\nConflict with Renate Gabrielle Grossvogel von Ramsau, Quarterly azure and argent, in bend two cats sejant, dexter forepaws raised, argent. There is a CD for the number of cats, but nothing for the change in the position of one forepaw. (06/2001)\n\nArik Alton. Household name Hawks Keep.\n\nThis conflicts with Hawk Herald of Calontir. Keep is the designator, and therefore does not contribute towards difference; neither does the addition of the possessive. (08/1999)\n\nArmand DArcy. Device. Or, a winged unicorn segreant sable.\n\nThe primary charge is not really a winged unicorn but a unicornate pegasus with a lions tail. It is missing both the beard and the cloven hooves. Thus it blurs the distinction between unicorns and horses. It is also in conflict with Kathleen of Riverrose (registered 1976), Or, a unicornate pegasus statant sable, with only a single CD for the posture of the monster. (02/2001)\n\nARMSTRONG. Device. Argent, three pallets azure.\n\nThere was insufficient evidence given to justify protecting these arms. (08/1999)\n\nArn Hold, Barony of. Badge for the Order of the Amethyst Chalice. (Fieldless) A chalice purpure.\n\nConflict with the badge for Dorcas Dorcadas, Or, a goblet purpure, jeweled proper. The jewels contribute no difference so there is only a single CD for fieldlessness. (01/2000)\n\nArn Hold, Barony of. Badge for the Order of the Cercle d'Honneur. (Fieldless) An annulet Or.\n\nConflict with Vladimir Vitalievich Volkov, Per pale argent ermined purpure and purpure, an annulet Or. There is only a single CD for fieldlessness. (01/2000)\n\nArn Hold, Barony of. Order name Order of Le Pomme d'Or and badge. Purpure, an apple Or.\n\nConflict with the Palme d'Or, the award for best film at the Cannes Film Festival. As one of the very few international awards known in America, we consider it important enough to protect, and there is insufficent difference in sounce between Pomme and Palme.\n\nThe badge conflicts with Adelicia Gilwell, An apple Or. There is only a single CD for fieldlessness. (01/2000)\n\nArn Hold, Barony of. Order name Order of the Gaudium Alces.\n\nFirst, the grammar is incorrect  the name should be Gaudium Alcis. More importantly no evidence was given, nor could any be found, to indicate that \"Joy of the Moose\" matched any known naming pattern for order names. (01/2000)\n\nArnak Haifisch der Laut. Name and device. Sable, a shark haurient affronty argent.\n\nThis name has several problems. First, no dated evidence was submitted for the given name. Second, neither was evidence given for the unusual byname Haifisch, meaning 'shark.' Third, the second byname der Laut does not mean 'the Loud' but 'the Tone'; this doesn't fit with our knowledge about period bynames. Finally, no evidence was submitted for using two descriptive bynames in German.\n\nNo device forms were included for this submission. In addition, we would like evidence of this posture's use in period armory.\n\nIn redesign beware of Gest Grimsson, Vert, a narwhal hauriant embowed argent, and Balin the Fairhaired, Sable, a whale hauriant argent. (07/2000)\n\nArnaud de Gournay of Dragonsley. Device. Per saltire vert and Or, an eagle displayed counterchanged.\n\nThis device conflicts with Leonie de Civronnay, Per saltire vert and Or, a mockingbird displayed head to sinister proper perched on an ocotillo branch fesswise vert, flowered gules. There is one CD for change in tincture of the charge. While it is true that birds do not always conflict with other birds, only eagles were displayed in period. Therefore there is not a CD for change in type. Examination of the emblazon shows that the branch is not significant, so there is no CD for its removal. (10/1999)\n\nArtemisia da Quieto dArzenta. Device. Per chevron ermine and purpure, in base a compass star argent.\n\nThere are multiple conflicts, including the one mentioned in the Letter of Intent: Ulrich Drachendonner, Tierced in pall azure, gules and sable, in chief a compass star argent. Because the position of Artemisias compass stars is forced, there is not a CD for position, even though the location of Ulrichs compass star is not forced.\n\nThe device is also in conflict with Andrew Greencloak Hethilsson, Per chevron argent and vert, in base a mullet of four points argent, the badge for the Barony of Rivenstar, Azure, a riven star argent, and the badge for Eleanor Leonard, (Tinctureless) A mullet of four points distilling a goutte. By prior precedent there is not a CD between a compass star and a mullet of four points, nor is there a CD between a compass star and a riven star; therefore in each case there is only a single CD for the changes to the field. (04/2001)\n\nArtemisia da Quieto d'Arzenta. Device. Per saltire purpure and sable, a legless dragon tergiant head to sinister and in chief three mullets argent.\n\nThis device, pended from the July 2000 LoAR, has been withdrawn by the submitter. (10/2000)\n\nArtemus of Grimsby. Name.\n\nNo documentation was provided for the given name. We would have changed it to the documented Artemas, but as he does not allow any changes we have to return it. (02/2001)\n\nArtois, Counts of. Device. Azure semy-de-lys Or, a label gules.\n\nNo evidence was given that the Counts of Artois was an independent entity, nor that it is otherwise important enough or familiar enough to protect. See the Cover Letter for more details. (12/2000)\n\nAruba. Flag. Azure, a bar gemel abased Or and in canton a mullet of four points gules fimbriated argent.\n\nAruba is not a sovereign nation so its flag is not automatically important enough to protect, and no evidence was given to indicate why it should otherwise be protected. (11/1999)\n\nAsagiri Tetsuo. Name and device. Azure, a reremouse displayed argent maintaining a sword fesswise proper.\n\nNo evidence was given to indicate that Asagiri, meaning \"Morning fog\", is a reasonable surname, which are primarily based on geographical features, not weather phenomenon. Furthermore the submitters given name was incorrectly spelled as Tetsuo instead of Tatsuo. While not a reason for return, the submitter should be informed that men in the samurai class invariably has a nanori as well as a surname and given name.\n\nThe submitter has a letter of permission to conflict with Chabi of Burkhan Khaldun, Per bend sinister sable and vert, a reremouse argent; however, as he did not allow the formation of a holding name, we must return the device as well. (10/1999)\n\nAshir al-Zahir. Name.\n\nNo documentation was provided for the given name, nor was the College able to find such.\n\nHis device has been registered under the holding name Christian of Sundragon. (07/2000)\n\nAsmarani al-Aswani. Name.\n\nThe only documentation for the given name was the assertion of a native Arabic speaker that it was a name. However, in most cases a native speaker does not know very much about period naming practice. This, therefore, is not sufficient documentation  it would be similar to accepting the word of the submitter as documentation for an English name. Since the College could not find documentation for the name we have to return it.\n\nHer device has been registered under the holding name Shelley of Windale. (03/2001)\n\nÁsta Þorvaldsdóttir. Device. Purpure, a chevron couched from dexter interlaced with a chevron couched from sinister Or between two arrows, overall an arrow inverted argent.\n\nThis violates the ban on depictions of the same charge in two different sizes on the field. As drawn, it is unclear if the arrows on the sides are intended to be secondaries or overall charges. (02/2001)\n\nAstasia de Moncellis. Device. Per bend wavy gules and sable, a decrescent and in chief two mullets argent.\n\nThis is being returned for having charges overlying a low contrast field with a complex line of division. An exception to this rule is only made when the overlap is very small, but that is not the case here. (06/23/1999)\n\nAstasia de Moncellis. Device. Quarterly argent and argent vêtu ployé azure, in bend sinister two decrescents azure.\n\nThe device violates RfS XI.3, Marshalling. In particular it violates the clause in RfS XI.3.b:\n\nSuch fields may only be used when no single portion of the field may appear to be an independent piece of armory. No section of the field may contain an ordinary that terminates at the edge of that section, or more than one charge unless those charges are part of a group over the whole field. Charged sections must all contain charges of the same type to avoid the appearance of being different from each other.\n\nWhile this case is not precisely one of the cases enumerated, there is no evidence of a vêtu field being used on only part of the field; therefore the two vêtu sections can only be independent pieces of armory. Reblazoning as Quarterly argent and azure, in bend sinister two lozenges ployé throughout each charged with a decrescent azure does not help, because the lozenges are both charged and throughout, so the quarters still appear to be independent armory. (04/2001)\n\nAstrid Olafsdatter. Name.\n\nThis is in aural conflict with Astrith Ulfsdottir. For the resubmission it would be useful to know whether she wants a Viking-era Old Norse name or a later-period Norwegian, Danish or Swedish name. The current submission is late period Danish/Swedish, but the documentation and submission forms are vague on this point.\n\nHer device has been registered under the holding name Astrid of Eisental. (06/2001)\n\nAstrid Radulfsdottir. Household name House Wolfgang von Neunkirchen.\n\nNo evidence was provided that ships in period were named after specific individuals. On the contrary, based on the knowledge we have, this seems not to have been the case. As an alternative, the submitter would have accepted House Neunkirchen. Unfortunately, however, the town has its own entry even in the one-volume pocket encyclopedia we checked (Tasku-Tietojätti, Gummerus 1984), so it falls in the category of protected real-world names. (07/2000)\n\nAstrid Ravenlocks Thorvaldsdottir. Name.\n\nRavenlocks does not follow any pattern for Norse names; \"raven\" refers only to the bird. We cannot drop the element because that would bring it into conflict with the registered name Astrid Thorvardsdatter. We recommend that the submitter consider using in hásvarta, \"the black-haired woman.\" (10/1999)\n\nHer armory was registered under the holding name Astrid of Wyrmgeist.\n\nAstrid Wulfkunzel. Name change from Astrid Radulfsdottir.\n\nThe constructed name Wulfkünzel has the problem that Künzel seems only justified as a protheme. That is, based on the Wolf- names and Konrad submitted as evidence, we would get Wolfrad (which would not need such hypothesizing, since Bahlow cites Wolfradus von Stain, 1291).\n\nIt is possible to construct a name from these elements, however. Wulf is found as both protheme and deutherotheme, so swapping the elements should be acceptable. In Anglo-Saxon we even have evidence of such a name: Searle has in Onomasticon Anglo-Saxonicum several cites of Coenwulf in the 8th11th century. (07/2000)\n\nAtenveldt, Kingdom of. Heraldic title Paramount Pursuivant.\n\nThis title conflicts with Paramount Pictures, which the College of Arms feels is a non-SCA name important enough to protect. Also, wed like to see more evidence of adjectives used as heraldic titles in period. (07/1999)\n\nAtlantia, Kingdom of. Badge for the Kings Guard. (Fieldless) A sealion maintaining a sword bendwise sinister Or.\n\nThe consensus of the College is that the sword is not large enough to count as a co-primary. As a maintained charge its addition is worth no difference so the badge is in conflict with the badge for the Shire of Adamestor, A sea-lion Or maned sable. There is a CD for fieldlessness but nothing for changing the tincture of the mane of the lion nor for the addition of the sword. (04/2001)\n\nAtlantia, Kingdom of. Badge for the Page School. Page School. (Fieldless) On a rose gules barbed vert a chalice argent.\n\nThis badge conflicts with the badge of the House of Tudor (important non-SCA armory) A tudor rose. One depiction of a Tudor Rose can be blazoned as a On a rose gules a rose argent. There is a CD for fieldlessness; however, there is none for changing the type only of a tertiary charge.\n\nThis was accidentally left off the July 1999 LoAR. (09/1999)\n\nAubrée Symonne de Ver. Device. Or, on a fess between a sprig embowed to chief and a sprig embowed to base gules, a collie and a cat sejant respectant Or.\n\nCollies as a breed originated after the 16th century, therefore they may not be used as a charge. Additionally, while not a cause for return, many commenters found the two similar but not identical sejant beasts on the fess to be visually confusing. (03/2000)\n\nAvacal, Principality of. Badge for the Order of the Gilded Griffin. (Fieldless) A griffin segreant Or.\n\nThis was an appeal of the kingdom return of this badge for conflict with Degary Golafre of Pembroke, reblazoned elsewhere in this letter, Quarterly sable and gules, a griffin segreant coward maintaining in its dexter talon a Celtic cross and in its sinister talon a sword inverted Or. As seen by the reblazoning, the held charges are maintained (that is, are significantly smaller than the griffin) and thus do not contribute to difference, even in combination. Therefore, there is but a single CD for fieldlessness. (07/2000)\n\nAvacal, Principality of. Order name Award of the Little Griffin.\n\nNo evidence was provided that this name would conform to period patterns of order names. As the College could not find such evidence either, we have to return this. (09/2000)\n\nAvacal, Principality of. Order name Order of the Griffin's Flame.\n\nA flame is not an attribute associated with a griffin, therefore we need to see evidence that Griffin's Flame is a reasonable name for an order. (01/2000)\n\nAvarga Chagaadai. Name.\n\nAccording to Pennon, Avarga may very well mean 'Giant' or 'Big One' in Modern Mongolian, specifically the Khalkhan dialect; also, this fits the pattern of elements used in Mongol naming practices. Unfortunately, however, this would not be the word used in period. The Khalkhan dialect has changed the spelling of some original words and time has added not only words but letters to the language. V is not found in Mongol words prior to 1206 when Genghis Khan ordered the use of the Uighur script for writing Mongolian. Its use came in with the importing of words from other cultures and did not find its way into Mongolian names until after period.\n\nThe word the submitter is looking for is Yeke. Meaning literally 'great' it is used as a synonym for 'big' and 'large' also. There are several instances of its use as a personal name element in period. In the Index of the Secret History of the Mongols, translated by Francis Woodman Cleaves (Professor Emeritus of Harvard University) there are 6 instances of Yeke: Yeke Barula, Yeke Cheren, Yeke Chiledü, Yeke Nerghürin, and Yeke Nidün.\n\nThe spelling of Chagaadai is modern - a good attempt, but modern none the less. As the submitter allows minor changes, we would have changed it to Chaghadai; however, the change from Avarga to Yeke is far too major for us to make.\n\nWe suggest Yeke Chaghadai as a more period name with the desired meaning. (04/2000)\n\nAzelin Cola of Wishford. Household name House Ancaster and badge. (Fieldless) On a bell Or, a duck statant gules.\n\nThis name is in aural conflict with the protected real-world house of Lancaster.\n\nThe badge is in conflict with Roger de Hinchelie, Vert, on a bell Or a lion rampant guardant gules. There is a CD for fieldlessness, but not a second for changing the type only of the tertiary charge. A bell is not simple enough to void and thus not simple enough for X.4.j.ii to apply. (08/2000)\n\nBaildrin MacEinri. Device. Per pale indented azure and gules, a lion passant and on a chief argent, three roses gules.\n\nThe lion obscures the low contrast line of division to the point where identifiability is significantly reduced. Such cases have been the cause for return for some time. (11/1999)\n\nBalthasar van Maldeghem. Device. Per pale sable and Or, a mace and a bordure embattled counterchanged.\n\nThere was discussion as to whether the mace was wide enough to be counterchanged along its long axis. Previous cases have decided that winged swords are not, and that double-bitted axes and comets are. The issue is identifiability  such counterchanging was banned precisely because the charge became unidentifiable. After examining the emblazon, we decided that the charge was just barely too narrow to be counterchanged like this. (08/2000)\n\nBalthazar lEscallier. Device. Vert, a bend cotised between two acorns argent.\n\nNo forms were sent to Laurel. (09/2000)\n\nBanba McGowen. Name and device. Per fess vert ermined argent and argent, in base three hedgehogs azure.\n\nThe name and device are returned for lack of paperwork. Additionally the documentation for Banba indicates that it was used only as a place name or as the wife of a god. Lastly, while not a reason for return anymore, the submitter should be informed that mixing Irish Gaelic and English spellings in a single name is a vanishingly rare practice. If the submitter is interested in the period Irish given name Banbnat, pronounced roughly \\BAHNV-nitch\\, then Banbnat ingen in Gobann would be an authentic Irish name meaning \"Banbnat, daughter of the smith.\" (10/1999)\n\nBARCLAY of Towie. Device. Azure, a chevron Or between three crosses formy argent.\n\nThere was insufficient evidence given to justify protecting these arms. (08/1999)\n\nBasil von Köln. Badge. (Fieldless) A cross clechy sable, the crossbar draped of a cloth argent. (03/2001)\n\nNo evidence was given, nor could the College provide any, that draping a cloth over a cross was a motif found in period heraldry. Furthermore, the particular form of draping obscures enough of the cross that it is equivalent to the type of overall charges that have been disallowed for many years (see the cover letter for the November 1992 LoAR, pg. 3). Any future submission should document the particular depiction to period, preferably in heraldry. Moreover, it should limit the amount of overlap so that both charges are clearly identifiable. (03/2001)\n\nBastian Wolfhart. Device. Argent, a wolf statant gules atop a mount vert.\n\nThe wolf appears to be neither on nor atop the mount; a blazon which more accurately reproduces the emblazon is Argent, a mount vert, overall a wolf statant gules. However, we do not register charges that overlap peripheral ordinaries. (11/1999)\n\nBathory Anastasia. Device. Per fess wavy sable and barry wavy Or and sable, in chief a decrescent Or.\n\nThe submitter withdrew the device. (02/2000)\n\nBattista Kie De Lagos. Name and device. Per fess vert and purpure, on a fess between two keys fesswise Or two scorpions fesswise addorsed tails entwined sable.\n\nThe \"d\" in \"De\" should not be capitalized. As the submitter would accept no changes, this name must be returned. Also, please inform the submitter that Battista is a masculine name.\n\nBecause she would not accept a holding name, the device must be returned as well. (08/1999)\n\nBear Mountain, Canton of. Branch name and device. Per pall inverted azure, argent and vert, in chief two laurel wreaths counterchanged.\n\nThese are returned because the petitions contained neither the group name nor a description of the device.\n\nThe submitters should be informed that there is little evidence that mountain was used in this form as a place name element in period. They may want to consider the considerably more authentic name Bearmont instead. (01/2000)\n\nBearaich Ó Harald-o. Name.\n\nThe submitter requested an authentic 11th-12th century Manx name. However, the name has several problems. The given name appears to be in the genitive case. Furthermore, even the nominative form Berach is likely to be a Modern Irish spelling of the name, and we were not able to find a form dated to the desired time period.\n\nThe byname is even more problematical. Contrary to what the LoI claims, the form given in Woulfe's Irish Names and Surnames is O'Harold. This is an Anglicised spelling; Woulfe gives Ó hArailt as the Gaelic form. However, it is undated, and the Anglicised form is dated to the very end of our period. Based on examples in the Annals of Tigernach, mac Arailt Oicc would seem a reasonable early form of the byname.\n\nThe combination Berach mac Arailt Oicc would still not be quite authentic, as it would have mid-to-late-period given name combined with an early-period byname. Further, all of this has been documented from Irish sources, not Manx. Still, we would have registered it if the submitter had allowed us to make major changes. Since he did not, we are unwilling to change the name so radically from the submitted form. (11/2000)\n\nBeatrice Domenici della Campana. Badge. Vert, a mazer and in chief three lemons two and one fracted to base distilling gouttes Or.\n\nConflict with Graffico de Drell, Vert, entwined about a chalice Or, a serpent head to sinister sable. The serpent is not significant, therefore there is only one CD for the addition of the secondary charges. We would also like to see evidence of lemons or other fruit depicted this way in period heraldry. (12/2000)\n\nBeatrice Domenici della Campana. Device. Argent, on a pall between three roses azure four roses argent.\n\nConflict with Rosalyn of Thornabe on Tees, Argent, a pall arrondy between three forget-me-nots azure. There is a CD for the addition of the tertiary charges, but nothing for straightening the arms of the pall nor for the difference between a forget-me-not and a rose. (03/2000)\n\nBeau Fort, Shire of. Badge change. (Fieldless) A yale rampant sable, armed and spotted Or, maintaining an escutcheon sable charged with a fleur-de-lys Or.\n\nThe yale is not touching the escutcheon and by rule VIII.5 fieldless badges must contain only conjoined charges. Moreover, the yale is drawn midway between passant and rampant. If the yale is drawn as rampant, it will conflict with the badge of Alejandra Mercedes de Rosanegra, A yale rampant sable platy, with a CD for fieldlessness, but nothing for changing the tincture only of the tertiary roundels. (10/1999)\n\nBeau Fort, Shire of. Badge. Sable, a fleur-de-lys within a bordure Or.\n\nConflict with Catarina della Zimarra, Sable a fleur de lys within the horns of a crescent Or. A check of Catarinas emblazon shows that the fleur-de-lys is definitely the sole primary charge. Therefore there is only one CD for changing the type of the secondary/peripheral charge. (10/1999)\n\nBeinntheine, Shire of. Badge. (Fieldless) A cauldron sable.\n\nConflict with the badge for the House of the Blackened Pot (Jana Aoibeall), Or, a cauldron suspended from a tripod sable. The tripod is not significant enough to contribute difference. (03/2000)\n\nBéla Kós. Device. Per pale bevilled argent and sable, a hawk volant contourny and a skull all counterchanged.\n\nNo evidence was given that per pale bevilled is a legitimate line of division. Furthermore, even the documented per bend bevilled cannot, by Laurel precedent, be used with dissimilar charges. Legh, Accidences of Armory (1586), asserts that the field should not be charged at all. We have, as one step beyond period practice, allowed the field to be used with a single type of simple charge. The submitted device, however, would be at least two steps beyond period practice. (02/2001)\n\nBéoán mac Tarbh. Name.\n\nNo evidence was presented for mac Tarbh as a period byname. Instead the LoI argued that some Gaelic names were formed from animal names, for instance MacCon 'son of the Wolf', Branan from bran 'raven', MacCart 'son of Art' from Arto 'bear'. Further, as the argument went, Johnston, Place Names of Scotland, under Tarff, gives its origin as Gaelic Tarbh 'bull'. However, no dates are given, and furthermore Johnston's etymologies are sometimes suspect. Barring better documentation for the byname we are returning this. (10/2000)\n\nBermuda. Flag. Gules, on an escutcheon the state arms (Argent, a base vert, a lion sejant erect affronty crowned gules holding a shield showing the sinking of the ship Sea Venture off Bermuda in 1609) and a canton of the Union Jack.\n\nBermuda is not a sovereign nation so its flag is not automatically important enough to protect, and no evidence was given to indicate why it should otherwise be protected. (11/1999)\n\nBernard de Barre. Name.\n\nConflict with the registered name Bernard ben Barra. Neither ben nor de contribute to difference and the primary elements are not significantly different. (03/2000)\n\nBerowelf fon Haholtesheime. Device. Per saltire argent and gules, two axes argent.\n\nThe device technically conflicts with Richard of Walterna, Quarterly Or and sable, in bend sinister two double-bitted axes argent. There is one CD for the changes to the field. Under current precedent the arrangement of the axes is a forced change and not worth a CD. (07/1999)\n\nBianca Fioretta da Ravenna. Device. Purpure, a cross moline disjointed within a bordure Or.\n\nListed on the letter of intent as a resubmission, at the Laurel level, the device is actually a new device. Therefore we cannot register it without a fee. (10/1999)\n\nBice di Pietro. Device. Gules, a cross Or, overall on a lozenge sable fimbriated an estoile all within a bordure Or.\n\nThis device is returned for violating rule XI.4: Arms of Pretense. The fimbriation makes the lozenge appear to be charged with a bordure. (09/1999)\n\nBiringeira de Vasconçellos. Device. Per pale urdy gules and sable.\n\nConflict with the badge of Peter of Dun Calma, Per pale embattled gules and Or. There is a CD for change of tincture, but by precedent (Arinbjorn Ragnarsson, January 1997, p. 18) there is not a CD for urdy vs. embattled. (04/2001)\n\nBjorn of the Kuma. Name.\n\nNo evidence was given to show that a locative taken from a river name is a valid byname in either Norse or Russian.\n\nThe device is registered under the holding name Bjorn of Gyldenholt (08/1999)\n\nBlatha an Oir, Barony of. Order name L'Ordre de l'Hèrme d'Or.\n\nAn OED citation for the English herm is not sufficient to document the French hèrme. Even if the word were documented as a period French word, we would have the problem that hèrme seems too specific to be used in an order name  Order of the Statue would be fine but Order of the Statue of Hermes much less so. (04/2000)\n\nBleddyn ap Llwelyn. Name.\n\nConflict with the registered name Bleddyn ap Llwelyn. His armory was registered under the holding name Bleddyn of Hornwood. (02/2000)\n\nBlóð-Úlfr inn Berserki. Name change from holding name John Norris of Dreiburgen.\n\nNo documentation was provided for Blóð-Úlfr as a given name; the previous Laurel return mentioned that it was possibly a valid byname but not a given name. (11/1999)\n\nBohemond Guiscard. Device. Sable, in pale a sunburst Or issuant from clouds and a prickspur fesswise reversed argent.\n\nConflict with the badge for Sigurd Ericsson of Bergen, Sable, a spur fesswise reversed argent, with only one CD for the addition of the sunburst. (06/2001)\n\nBohémond le Sinistre. Device change. Per bend sinister argent and argent semy-de-lys sable, on a bend sinister gules a sword inverted Or, in chief an elephant head cabossed sable.\n\nCurrent precedent disallows strewn charges on only part of a plain field, even when the field has a \"natural\" division such as an ordinary (see July 1998 LoAR, Miriel MacGregor), barring evidence that such fields were used in period armory. (01/2001)\n\nBorealis, Barony of. Badge. Azure, in pale two wolfs heads erased addorsed and conjoined at the neck argent and two rapiers inverted in saltire Or.\n\nThis is being returned for conflict with the badge for the Order of the Silverwolf, Azure, in pale two wolfs heads erased addorsed and conjoined at the neck argent and two swords inverted in saltire Or, registered to Borealis in this letter. We do not register identical items, even to the same submitter. Blazon A is considered identical to blazon B if, given blazon A and B, you could draw them identically. Therefore only one of those two blazons can be registered. As it is reasonable to draw charges blazoned as swords as rapiers, we are only registering the more general badge; however, that badge can be drawn with rapiers as needed. (12/1999)\n\nBorealis, Barony of. Order Name Order of the Wolfs Paw.\n\nThe use of the apostrophe is post period. Since they allow no changes, this order name must be returned. (12/1999)\n\nBran ap Gruffudd. Name.\n\nUnfortunately the name Rhianwen ferch Bran ap Gruffydd has already been registered in June 1986. The current submitter is, in effect, claiming to be Rhianwens father, and the submission is therefore in violation of section VI.3 of the Rules for Submissions. (05/2001)\n\nBran of Lough Derg. Device. Or, in pale a bird displayed sable perched atop a crescent inverted gules, between the horns a mountain of three peaks couped sable.\n\nThe device has three different types of charge in the same charge group, violating the rule of thumb in RfS VIII.1.a. Armorial Simplicity, ... As another guideline, three or more types of charges should not be used in the same group. (06/2000)\n\nBran Trefonin. Badge for House Corvus. (Fieldless) Three birds close conjoined in annulo sable.\n\nThese birds are not conjoined in annulo, they are connected by the legs. As such, this depiction is not blazonable. We would need evidence that this motif is a reasonable heraldic depiction as well as a valid blazon for it in order to register it. As his currently registered badge, Three birds close conjoined in annulo argent, has the birds connected head to tail, we cannot register this motif using the Grandfather Clause. (11/2000)\n\nBrandric of Rhydderich Hael. Badge. (Fieldless) An eagle-headed torc opening to chief Or.\n\nThis conflicts with Weyland OFaoláin, Per fess embattled vert and Or, in chief a torque, opening to chief, Or. There is a CD for fieldlessness, but we do not give a CD for position when one of the pieces of armory is fieldless, and there is nothing for the opening decoration. (10/1999)\n\nBrendan of Dormansford. Device. Gyronny sable and purpure, an eagle displayed argent and in chief three estoiles Or.\n\nThe device violated RfS VIII.2.b(iv) \"Contrast Requirements  Elements evenly divided into multiple parts of two different tinctures must have good contrast between their parts.\" A gyronny field must have good contrast between its parts. (09/2000)\n\nBrendoken, Barony of. Device. Per pale vert and sable, a compass star within a laurel wreath Or.\n\nConflict with the Shire of Champclair, Per fess azure and vairy Or and azure, in chief a sun within a laurel wreath Or. There is not a CD between a compass star and a sun. Furthermore, the position of the shires charges is forced by the rules of contrast, so there is not a CD for the position of the charges on the field. Therefore there is only a single CD for the change of the field. In addition, the wreath was not drawn as a laurel wreath but as two sprigs of laurel. A wreath should be nearly circular, but this case had only a little curvature of the laurel springs at the top. (05/2001)\n\nBrenna Michaela Sine Macghie of Clan MacKay. Name.\n\nThere are several problems with the name. Brenna is not Gaelic, but is justfiable as possibly Italian. This makes the name acceptable by itself, but not with the rest of the name. The mixture of English and Gaelic spellings in the name is a weirdness. Furthermore, there is no evidence of Scottish or Irish names with two given names, much less three. Also, there is no evidence of the use of Clan <X> in names. Lastly, the Macghie of MacKay implied that the submitter is the clan chief or the clan chief's daughter, which is presumptuous. The submitter should also be informed that Michaela is not Irish. (04/2000)\n\nBrian Brock. Household name Clan Caer Lonn.\n\nThe name mixes two languages, Welsh (Caer) and Gaelic (Lonn) in one phrase, violating rule III.1.a, \"Linguistic Consistency.\" Brian should also be informed that Clans were named after personal names and nicknames, not places. Lastly we would prefer to see some evidence that \"Strong\" is a reasonable adjective to apply to keeps. (07/1999)\n\nBrian du Val. Name and device. Bendy and per bend sinister argent and azure, a goblet within an orle Or.\n\nNo forms were sent to Laurel. (11/2000)\n\nBrian Killian the Red. Badge. (Fieldless) On a grenade Or enflamed proper, a crescent sable.\n\nThis badge is returned for conflict with Wolfgang Schwarzburg (Sep 93), Per saltire sable and gules, on a fireball Or enflamed proper a winged cat segreant sable. There is one CD for fieldlessness, but none for the change of type only of the tertiary. Al-Jamal provided evidence that standard sources (Parker, Elvin, and Franklyn and Tanner) define fireballs and grenades as identical charges or, at most, minor artistic variants of one another. (08/1999)\n\nBrian Ó Duinn. Name.\n\nThis conflicts with the registered name of Brianna O Duinn. (04/2000)\n\nBrianna Baptista. Device. Gules, on a sun Or a decrescent sable, a bordure Or.\n\nThere are a number of conflicts, including Eleric Sønn Hvittann, Sable, on a sun Or an anvil sable, within a bordure Or, and Alwyn of Kittisford, Per saltire azure and gules, on a compass star Or a pellet and a bordure Or. In both cases there is a CD for the field, but not another one for changing the type only of the tertiary charges. (07/2000)\n\nBriget MacLeod. Device. Per pall inverted gules, argent, and sable, in base a Norse sun cross Or.\n\nThe Norse sun cross is also the symbol for Earth, and by precedent symbols cannot be registered as the sole charge. This ruling was applied to Norse sun crosses in April 1994 (pg. 15, s.n. Barony of Bonwicke). (09/2000)\n\nBrighid ingen ui Gobhainn. Name.\n\nThis conflicts with Brigid MacGowan, registered in July 1996.\n\nHer device has been registered under the holding name Brighid of the East. (06/2001)\n\nBrighid inghean Mhurchada. Device. Per pall inverted gules, Or, and sable, two bat-winged lions combatant Or and gules and a glove palewise argent.\n\nThe things on the lions' backs are not wings but fishtails. We know of no examples in period of charges formed in this manner. (04/2000)\n\nBrighid Wolfshead. Device. Azure, a winged wolf segreant within a bordure argent.\n\nConflict with Thomas Wakefield, Azure, a winged wolf rampant to sinister, wings addorsed, argent, the head environed of a nimbus Or, within a bordure argent. There is not a CD for the removal of the nimbus, thus there is only a single CD for the orientation of the primary charge. (06/2000)\n\nBrion Enkazi. Name.\n\nThis was an appeal of a kingdom return. The appeal was based largely on a persona story which has no bearing on the acceptability of the name. Brion is acceptable as an Irish name, although the submitter should be informed that we know of no examples of the name in Central Europe where he based his persona. Enkazi was documented as an Italian mercenary name based on a mispronunciation of und Kazi, but no evidence was given that any byname was formed from this type of transformation, much less an Italian mercenary name. Therefore we must deny the appeal and return the name. (02/2000)\n\nBrione de Barre. Name.\n\nThe name conflicts with Brian de Barri , registered in January 1998. (05/2000)\n\nBRODIE of Brodie. Device. Argent, a chevron gules between three mullets azure.\n\nThere was insufficient evidence given to justify protecting these arms. (08/1999)\n\nBronwen Gwehyddes Angelsey. Device. Vert, three chevronels braced, in chief in pale a unicorns head couped argent.\n\nThe head was not a unicorns head, but rather a unicornate horses head, as it lacked a beard. Unicornate horses have not been registerable for some time because they blur the distinction between horses and unicorns. (12/1999)\n\nBronwen o Gydweli. Device change. Per pale sable and argent, an antelope statant and in chief a coronet all counterchanged.\n\nThe submitter requested that her current device, Per pale sable and argent, an antelope statant counterchanged, be retained as a badge. She already, however, has three badges registered, thus she cannot have her current arms as a badge without violating the limit on the number of pieces of armory registered. Therefore were are returning the new device until she can indicate which armory should be released in order to register this one. (06/2000)\n\nBruce Draconarius of Mistholme. Device change. Azure, on a chief embattled argent a dragon couchant azure, winged sable gorged of a coronet Or. For augmentation, the dragon maintaining between its forefeet an escutcheon azure charged with four crescents conjoined in saltire, horns outward argent.\n\nWithdrawn by the submitter. (12/1999)\n\nBrychan ap Dafydd. Device. Vert, on a bend sinister argent three crosses palewise formy fitchy sable.\n\nConflict with Leslie the Brown, Vert, on a bend sinister argent a Hermit Thrush close proper (Hylocichla guttata). There is only a single CD for the changes to the tertiaries.\n\nThe submitter should be informed that the crosses following the line of the bend sinister would be more authentic. (06/23/1999)\n\nBryne McClellan. Device. Argent, a double rose proper within a wreath of thorns sable a bordure vert.\n\nConflict with Adelaide de Beaumont, Argent, a pimpernel gules, slipped and leaved, within a bordure vert; there is only a CD for the addition of the wreath of thorns. There is no CD for the difference between a pimpernel and a rose (even a double rose), and there is no CD for removing the slipping of a rose-like flower. (09/2000)\n\nCadlae inghean uí Sheanacháin. Device. Gules, on a chalice inverted between two roundels Or a wooden spiked mace inverted proper.\n\nAs far as we know, maces were not made entirely of wood; therefore, there is no support for the head being brown. Furthermore, both cups and maces were rarely inverted in period, so inverting both may be excessive. (11/2000)\n\nCadwallon y Rhudd. Name correction from Cadwallon Rudd.\n\nAccording to the submitter, the change of name from Cadwallon y Rhudd to Cadwallon Rudd in August 1981 was in error, as he originally submitted Cadwallon Rudd but it was changed to Cadwallon y Rhudd. The LoARs and the files indicate that he originally submitted Cadwallon Rudd and it was changed by Laurel in March 1981 to Cadwallon y Rhudd; however, that change was appealed and Laurel changed the name back to Cadwallon Rudd in August 1981. Therefore the armorial is correct. (11/2000)\n\nCadwan Galwiddoe of Redmarch. Badge. Gyronny of sixteen gules and argent, a windmill sable, a bordure vert bezanty.\n\nThis device has multiple weirdnesses or rarities: a gyronny of sixteen with a central charge, a complexity count of eight, and identifiability problems with the primary charge. While none of these problems (with the possible exception of identifiability) would, by themselves, make the device returnable, the combination is fatal. (06/2000)\n\nCaecilie Selig. Device. Purpure, a standing seraph proper winged and vested argent haloed Or.\n\nConflict with Angelica Winter of the Willows, Purpure, two standing seraphs and a willow tree eradicated argent. There is but a single CD for the number of primary charges. The combination of the device and the name Selig, blessed, is not presumptuous: there are many examples of the byname \"blessed,\" and while a standing seraph is a religious symbol, it is not associated with either the cult of saints in general or with Saint Cecilia in particular. (07/2000)\n\nCaer Gwyn, College of. Branch name and device. Purpure, on a tower argent a laurel wreath vert, on a chief argent three apples vert.\n\nThe name conflicts with House Caergwen, registered in June 1991 to Denys de Caergwen. As we do not register holding names for groups, the armory must be returned as well. (01/2001)\n\nCainder ingen hui Chatharnaig. Device. Per chevron argent and sable, two hazel springs and an owl counterchanged.\n\nThe hazel sprigs are unidentifiable as drawn. (09/2000)\n\nCainneach mac Asgaill. Device. Sable, an annulet argent.\n\nConflict with Minowara Kiritsubo, Sable, an annulet surmounted by three dragon's claws in pall conjoined at the tips argent between, as an augmentation, in fess two bezants and in pale in annulo an Oriental dragon passant to sinister and another passant inverted Or. The base armory is still protected, even with the augmentation, so there is only a single CD for the deletion of the overall charge group. (04/2000)\n\nCairenn inghean Dubhthaigh. Name and device. Per pale azure and vert, a fret argent.\n\nWhile the given name appears in Ó Corráin and Maguire's Irish Names, they say that \"The only bearer of this name was Caireen Chasdubh ('of the dark curly hair'), daughter of the king of the Britons, and mother of Niall of the Nine Hostages, legendary ancestress of the high-kings of Ireland.\" Because of this, the name has already been ruled unregisterable in August 1991.\n\nThe device is in conflict with Meredudd Brangwyn, Per saltire gules and pean, a fret argent. There is only a single CD for the changes to the field. For resubmission, please inform the submitter that the fret should issue from the corners of the shield. (07/2001)\n\nCait inghean ui Flannagain. Name.\n\nConflict with the registered name Catairiona ní Fhlannagáin. By rule V.1.a.i (Difference of given names), \"Irrespective of differences in sound and appearance, a given name is not significantly different from any of its diminutives when they are used as given names.\" Furthermore, no documentation was given, nor was any found, showing that Cait is a period diminutive. (11/1999)\n\nCaitlin Davies. Badge. (Fieldless) A cross patonce gules.\n\nConflict with the Order of Santiago (import non-SCA badge), A cross of Santiago gules. A cross patonce and a cross of Santiago are both considered artistic variants of a cross flory; therefore, there is no CD for a cross patonce versus a cross of Santiago. (03/2001)\n\nCaitlin Donegal. Device. Purpure, two seahorses combattant, tails crossed, within a bordure engrailed argent.\n\nThis is being returned for a redraw. The engrailing on the bordure needs to be drawn much bolder. (10/1999)\n\nCaitlin MacKenzie. Name (See PENDS for device).\n\nConflict with Caitlin nicCoinnich. MacKenzie is an anglicized form of mac Coinnich, making the two identical for the purposes of conflict. The submitter should also be told that mixing Gaelic and English forms in period is vanishingly rare. It would be better to have a name in either totally English or totally Gaelic forms. (10/1999)\n\nCaitriona Campbell of Argyll. Name.\n\nSince the Chief of Campbell is also the Duke of Argyll, the submitted name would imply membership in the immediate family of the chief. As she doesn't allow us to drop either Campbell or of Argyll we have to return this.\n\nHer device has been registered under the holding name Caitriona of Grey Niche. (06/2000)\n\nCaitríona inghean Aoidh. Name.\n\nThis name conflicts with Catriona Nic Aoidh, registered in December 1998.\n\nHer device is registered under the holding name Caitríona of the Middle. (02/2001)\n\nCalafia, Barony of. Order name Order of the Serpents Fang.\n\nNo evidence was presented that fang meant \"tooth\" in period. Barring conflict, the Order of the Serpents Tooth would be acceptable. (11/1999)\n\nCalafia, Barony of. Order name The Order of the Serpent's Fang.\n\nWhile fang was indeed used in period, it seems to have been applied only to canine animals. No new evidence was provided that a serpent's fang follows period patterns for order names  or even that it would have been a meaningful concept in period. We therefore have to deny the appeal. (07/2000)\n\nCalontir, Kingdom of. Heraldic title Buteo Pursuivant.\n\nThe Laurel office never received any forms. (08/2000)\n\nCalontir, Kingdom of. Heraldic title Gold Penguin Herald.\n\nThe Laurel office never received any forms. (08/2000)\n\nCalontir, Kingdom of. Heraldic title Gyr Pursuivant.\n\nThe Laurel office never received any forms. Furthermore, contrary to what the LoI states, there is no such bird as Gyr, although there is a species named Gyrfalcon. (08/2000)\n\nCalontir, Kingdom of. Heraldic title Harrier Pursuivant.\n\nThe Laurel office never received any forms. (08/2000)\n\nCalontir, Kingdom of. Heraldic title Kite Pursuivant.\n\nThe Laurel office never received any forms. (08/2000)\n\nCalontir, Kingdom of. Heraldic title Merlin Pursuivant.\n\nThe Laurel office never received any forms.\n\nThe question was raised in commentary whether this title conflicts with the literary person Merlin. However, personal names and other names are two separate categories. (08/2000)\n\nCalontir, Kingdom of. Heraldic title Raptor Pursuivant.\n\nThe Laurel office never received any forms. Furthermore, contrary to what the LoI claims, the name is not \"the name of a hunting bird from the hawk, eagle or falcon families, which were common during period\". To quote Metron Ariston:\n\nIn classical and medieval Latin raptor is the term for a thief or plunderer or even a rapist, essentially anyone who seizes upon something and carries it away. The earlier English usage for this term follows that meaning. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the use of the term for the order of birds of prey would appear to be a nineteenth century usage.\n\nThe name does not appear to follow period examples of heralds' titles, any more than the synonymous Rapist Pursuivant would. (08/2000)\n\nCanton of Kennasport. Branch name.\n\nThe documentation for Kennasport was as a spelling variant of Keneport or \"Cena's port\". The \"e\" in Cena, however, is long, so it is not appropriate to double the \"n\". Also the additional \"s\" was not used in this type of formation. Either the Middle English Keneport or the Old English Cenanport would be acceptable; however, the letter of intent stated that the canton would not accept either change.\n\nWhile the forms did not include the designator Canton, the petition did. The element -port in this case can be a designator (although Corpora (V.C) then requires the group to be a military institution), or it can be a more integral part of the name similar to -ton. (02/2000)\n\nCaointiarn Comhthaistealaí. Badge. (Fieldless) A lion couchant guardant argent.\n\nConflict with Ellen of Caer Seiont, Pean, a domestic cat dormant guardant argent, Kareina Talvi Tytar, Azure, vetû, a long-haired domestic cat dormant argent, and James Winter of White Forest, Per fess sable and ermine, in chief a lion dormant argent. As there is not a CD between dormant and couchant, and there is no CD for position on the field against a fieldless badge, in all cases there is only a single CD for the change in the field. (09/2000)\n\nCaptain of CLAN CHATTAN. Device. Or, a lymphad sails furled oars in saltire azure flagged gules.\n\nWhile there was more general support for protecting these arms, there was insufficient evidence given to justify protecting part of a coat of arms, even if the bearer of the whole is important enough to protect. (08/1999)\n\nCarrick MacCucharraige. Name.\n\nCarrick is derived from a place name, and thus the name lacks a given name.\n\nHis device was registered under the name Michael of Shattered Crystal. (09/1999)\n\nCassandra Felicia. Device. Azure, two sheep passant respectant reguardant, on a chief argent a shepherds staff reversed proper.\n\nThe sheep are neither guardant nor reguardant but somewhere between the two. (09/2000)\n\nCassandra of the Western Green. Badge. (Fieldless) A sprig of honeysuckle gules slipped and leaved vert within and conjoined to a torse wreathed argent and vert.\n\nThe base of the sprig slightly overlaps the torse; this has long since been grounds for return. The charges should either touch without overlapping, or the sprig should be entirely on the torse. (04/2000)\n\nCassandra von Schwabing. Device. Azure, a sunflower Or seeded proper on a chief Or three sunflowers azure.\n\nThere is no default color for the seeds of sunflowers: sometimes they are black, sometimes brown. Therefore, we cannot register a sunflower proper. As these were colored brown, a non-heraldic tincture, we could not register it with an alternate blazon. (11/2000)\n\nCassandra Zoë Paganel. Device. Azure, a silkie Or headed argent, in chief on three flames Or three gouts azure.\n\nGouttes on flames are inherently unidentifiable. \"The gout is unrecognizable as such on the flames, appearing to be a part of the flames rather than a separate charge.\" (Daud ibn Auda, LoAR August 1994, p. 16) (08/1999)\n\nCatalina de Navarra. Name and device. Purpure ermined, a sun in splendor argent.\n\nUnfortunately for the submitter, Catherine of Navarra or Catalina de Navarra was the sovereign queen of that kingdom in the early 1480's; she ruled jointly with her husband Jean d'Albret until 1512, when the kingdom became a part of Catalonia-Aragon.\n\nThe device is in conflict with Hieronymus Dernoma, Gyronny argent and sable, an estoile of seven points argent fimbriated sable. There is a CD for the field, but nothing for this difference between a seven-rayed estoile and a sun, and nothing for the removal of the fimbriation. (07/2001)\n\nCatalina Oro Sol. Device. Gules, a sunburst Or issuant from clouds argent within a bordure Or.\n\nConflict with Cordelia Fitzrobert of York, Gules, a demi-sun in splendor Or issuant from a cloud argent. There is only one CD for adding the bordure. (03/2000)\n\nCatelin O'Meighan. Device. Azure, a fox sejant argent maintaining in its mouth a bunch of grapes Or.\n\nConflict with Katya Zhdana Volkova Kievskaya, Azure, a wolf sejant ululant and in chief three crossbows argent, with a CD for removing the crossbows but nothing for the change in head position nor for adding the maintained charge. The device is also in conflict with the badge for Asne Whitewolf, registered April 2000, A wolf sejant argent. There is only a single CD for fieldlessness. (10/2000)\n\nCatharina de Bruyn. Device. Argent chapé, a tulip purpure slipped and leaved vert.\n\nConflict with Dai of the Tulips, Argent, a tulip gules slipped and leaved vert. Tulips are like thistles, the slipping and leaving of a tulip makes up more than half the charge; therefore, it is the tincture of the slips and leaves rather than the tincture of the flower that is used when checking conflict. Because the plant portion of the tulip is more significant than the flower, there is not a CD for changing its tincture. Therefore there is only a single CD for the field. (09/2000)\n\nCatharine Grenewode. Name.\n\nConflict with the registered name Caitlin of Greenwood. When pronounced correctly, the only difference in sound is the very minor difference between an \"r\" and an \"l\" and sometimes the difference between a \"t\" and a \"th\". Neither change is sufficient difference. (01/2000)\n\nCatherina of Dandroy. Name.\n\nNo documentation was presented, and none could be found, showing that Dandroy is a period place name or can be constructed from period elements. We recommend as a substitution the French patronymic d'André, from Dauzat, Dictionnaire étymologique (s.n. Daudray), but did not feel we could make the change without consulting with Catherina.\n\nHer armory was registered under the name Catharina of Londinium ad Rubrum Flumen (04/2000)\n\nCatherine OHerlihy. Device. Per fess wavy azure and vert, an otter statant and a pen bendwise sinister argent.\n\nNo paperwork was included for this device. (02/2000)\n\nCatrina Mackrae. Name and device. Per fess gules and sable, a demi-sun issuant from the line of division Or and two needles in saltire argent.\n\nThe name is in aural conflict with Catríona Macraith, registered in April 1994: the given names are identical and the bynames differ only in the final consonant.\n\nThe large emblazon had the sun colored tenne. As this is not a registerable heraldic tincture, we must return the device. (05/2001)\n\nCatriona Campbell. Name change from holding name Catriona of Grey Niche.\n\nThis conflicts with Katharine Campbell, registered in June 1988. According to RfS V.1.a, two name elements need to \"differ significantly in sound and appearance\" to be considered different. The difference in pronunciation between Catriona and Katharine is not quite significant enough. (05/2001)\n\nCatriona McKenzie of Kintail. Name.\n\nAs one of the seats of the McKenzies was Kintail, by long standing precedent, using McKenzie of Kintail is presumptuous. Catriona did not allow major changes, therefore we must return the name. Her armory was registered under the holding name Catriona of Twin Moons.\n\nPlease inform the submitter that mixing a Gaelic spelling of her first name with an Anglicized (and masculine) form of her byname is at best extremely unusual. A fully Scots form of her given name, such as Catrina or Katerin, would be considerably more authentic. A fully Scots Gaelic form of her name would use a literal patronymic and not a clan name. (12/1999)\n\nCeara inghean Leogháin. Device. Per bend azure and vert, a winged Bengal tiger passant argent striped sable.\n\nConflict with a badge for the Barony of Windmasters' Hill, A winged cat passant, forepaw extended, wings elevated and addorsed, argent and with a badge for Alain FitzWilliam l'Aileleon, Per pale Or and gules, a winged lion statant argent. There is not a CD for the addition of the stripes to the tiger, therefore there is only a single CD for the change or addition of the field. (04/2000)\n\nCecil Dupont. Name.\n\nThe forms lacked the legal name and address or any other contact information.\n\nCedric fils de Guillaume. Badge for House Ironwood. (Fieldless) A sword inverted argent issuant from a stump eradicated proper.\n\nConflict with Dubhghlas the Scavenger, Vert, a sword inverted argent, inflamed and issuant from an oak stock proper. There is one CD for the field, but an oak stock is a stump, and the flames in Dubhghlas's device are not worth heraldic difference. (07/2001)\n\nCeenguled filia Dunguall. Name.\n\nUnfortunately, the documentation for Dunguall was not summarized on the LoI: it is not sufficient to tell that the submitter has provided a copy of an article and a letter; we need to know what these documents say. As the College was unable to provide independent documentation we have to return the name as per the May 2000 LoAR cover letter. (03/2001)\n\nCelestine de Chatham. Device. Vert chapé sable, a quatrefoil and in chief two crosses fleury Or.\n\nListed on the LoI as having a per chevron line of division, the location of the line of the division and the relative sizes of the charges makes this an example of chapé. Therefore, it must be returned both for using a low contrast chapé field and for charging its upper portions. If it were redrawn as Per chevron sable and vert, two crosses fleury and a quatrefoil Or, then it would conflict with Pádraig Ó Deághaidh, Per chevron sable and vert, two Celtic crosses and a stag's head cabossed Or. There is a CD for changing the type of the primary charges, but the difference between a Celtic cross and a cross fleury, while significant enough for a CD, is not substantial enough for X.2, Difference of Primary Charges, to apply. (01/2000)\n\nCelestine of Arn Hold. Device. Per saltire purpure and vert, a swan rousant contourny argent.\n\nConflict with Margarete Rau, registered November 2000, Per saltire purpure and vert, a swan rousant contourny wings displayed argent. There is only a single CD for the position of the wings (displayed vs. addorsed). (12/2000)\n\nCerdic von Budingen. Device. Or, a rams head caboshed sable between three eyes gules.\n\nThe eyes used on this device did not match any known period examples. Barring evidence that this is a period depiction, this must be returned for redrawing. (06/2001)\n\nCesare Ambrogino Salvuzzi. Badge. Or, a sword inverted between two natural seahorses sable.\n\nConflict with Fergus of Ironwood, Or, a sword inverted sable transfixing a heart gules between two sea-lions respectant sable. There is one CD for changing the type of the secondary charges, but the pierced heart on Ferguss device is so small as to be effectively a maintained charge, and therefore its removal does not give the second necessary CD. (06/2001)\n\nChandani bint Razi. Name.\n\nContrary to what the submitters claim, Chandani does not appear in Schimmel's Islamic Names; on the contrary, the evidence found by the College suggests that it is a modern non-Arabic name. (08/2000)\n\nCharles le Verdier. Device. Per fess argent and azure, a fess counterchanged gules and argent between three elm leaves bendwise vert and a wolf courant contourny argent.\n\nThe wolf is neither passant nor courant but somewhere in between, blurring the distinction between them. Therefore the device is returned for a redraw as one or the other. (11/2000)\n\nCharles of Whithorse. Device. Quarterly sable and gules, two horses combattant argent.\n\nConflict with Evandre of Middleham More, Quarterly sable and gules, a horse rampant argent. There is only one CD for the number of primary charges. (02/2000)\n\nCharles Roberts. Name and device. Gyronny sable and Or, a cross rayonnant gules.\n\nConflict with Sir Charles Roberts Canadian nationalist writer and naturalist, who has his own listing in the Britannica Online.\n\nThe device conflicts with flag of England, Argent, a cross gules. We cannot give a difference for the rays because at least half of them have low contrast with the field and because they are drawn relatively small. (11/1999)\n\nCharles the Bull. Badge. Sable, on a Celtic cross argent a thistle proper.\n\nConflict with Keii Gerard de Courtenay, On a Celtic cross argent, a candle vert, lit proper. There is a CD for fieldlessness, but Charles' thistle is primarily vert, so there is not a second CD for changing only the type of the tertiary charge. (07/2000)\n\nChief of the CLAN MATHESON. Device. Gyronny gules and sable, a lion rampant Or.\n\nThere was insufficient evidence given to justify protecting these arms. (08/1999)\n\nChirhart Blackstar. Badge. (Fieldless) A mullet sable .\n\nConflict with Eleanor Leonard, (Tinctureless) A mullet of four points distilling a goutte. . Although the LoI indicated that the submitter had permission to conflict, such a letter was not included with the submission.\n\nIt is also in conflict with the Chronicler's badge for the Kingdom of Ansteorra, A mullet of five greater and five lesser points distilling goutes . As with the mullet of four vs. a compass star (see the June 1995 LoAR, pg. 23), the lesser points of the mullet have very little visual impact, and as mullets of greater and lesser points are not known in period, the visual difference counts. This reaffirms the precedent set in July 1990 (pg. 13). (05/2000)\n\nChristall MacKellar. Device. Azure, a chevron between two hunting horns and a slaughteraxe Or.\n\nConflict with Edmund Middleton of York, Azure, a chevron between three estoiles Or. There is a single CD for the change of type of the secondary charges. (04/2000)\n\nChristoph van den Brake. Device. Sable, in pale a compass star and a caravel argent.\n\nConflict with Runa Ragnarsdóttir, Sable, a drakkar argent. By long standing precedent, there is not a CD between two types of ship, therefore there is just the single CD for the addition of the compass star. (04/2000)\n\nCiar inghean ui Mhaoildeirg. Device. Per chevron throughout argent and vert, a stag statant at gaze argent.\n\nConflict with Gianni Arcieri, Per fess azure and bendy sable and argent, a stag at gaze argent. There is a single CD for the changes to the field. (12/1999)\n\nCiara inghaen uí Bleithir. Name.\n\nNo documentation was submitted for the patronymic, except that a similar name was registered in 1986 and 1988. Since the College could not find documentation for the element and since no evidence was provided that the submitter belongs to the immediate family of either of the earlier registrants, we have to return this. The submitter might wish to consider Beirichtir instead of Beithir.\n\nThe documentation for the given name was similarly a simple reference to prior registrations. However, Ciara appears to be a modern Anglicisation of a Latinisation of either Ciar, Ciarnait or Ceara. Finally, please note that the particle is properly spelled inghean. (06/2001)\n\nCiarán Grianánach. Name.\n\nThe documentation implies that the epithet refers uniquely to Ogma, champion to the Tuatha and, in some sense, the Irish analogue of Hercules. As such, it is not appropriate as a byname, so barring new evidence to the contrary we have to return it. (01/2001)\n\nCiarmhac Sayenga. Name.\n\nWhile we allow real-world name elements in SCA names without further documentation, this is restricted to cases where \"such elements are not excessively obtrusive.\" Combining a Gaelic Irish given name with what appears to be a non-European surname falls afoul of this restriction.\n\nHis armory was registered under the holding name Ciarmhac of Stormsport. (07/2000)\n\nCicilia Deldanza. Device. Gules, on a bend sinister argent between a sun in his splendor and an increscent Or, three mullets sable within a bordure argent mulletty sable.\n\nThis has a complexity count of nine. \"While it is true that armory exceeding this rule of thumb has been registered on rare occasions, these exceptions have only been made for particularly elegant proposals\" (Daud ibn Auda, January 1994 LoAR, p. 16). \"Particularly elegant\" generally means that otherwise it is typical of a style of complex period armory, such as Tudor armory. With the use of dissimilar secondary charges and a bend sinister, this is not \"particularly elegant\". (11/1999)\n\nCitadel of the Southern Pass, Barony of the. Badge for War Ensign of the Citadel of the Southern Pass. Pily bendy sinister azure and Or, a chalice gules.\n\nConflict with Phelim Gervase, Quarterly Or and argent, a cup gules. There is only one CD, for the change to the field. (10/1999)\n\nClare Hele. Badge. (Fieldless) A dolphin haurient argent maintaining in its mouth a vine vert.\n\nThe badge conflicts with Anton Hojen (registered November 1980), Gyronny from canton Or and sable, to sinister a dolphin haurient argent. There is the CD for fieldlessness, but nothing for position on the field versus a fieldless badge, and nothing for the held charge. (07/1999)\n\nClarissa Wykeham. Device change. Or, a seeblatt azure.\n\nWhile the armory was lovely, Only one copy of the device form was submitted. (02/2000)\n\nCluny MACPHERSON. Device. Per fess Or and azure, a lymphad counterchanged, sails furled argent, in chief a hand fesswise holding a dagger and a cross crosslet fitchy gules.\n\nThere was insufficient evidence given to justify protecting these arms. (08/1999)\n\nColdedernhale, Shire of. Device. Argent, chausse, a yale rampant and in chief a laurel wreath vert.\n\nConflict with Nicholos of the Hill Folk, Vert, on a pile argent, a dragon rampant gules. As we do not give difference between a pile and chausse, there is only one CD for the changes to the tertiary charges. (04/2000)\n\nColin McKenna. Device. Vert, a tree blasted and eradicated argent surmounted by a lions face Or.\n\nThe lion is barely overall, which has long been a reason for return. It also conflicts with Ioseph of Locksley, the Rhymer, Vert, a tree eradicated argent. There is only one CD for the addition of the overall charge. (12/1999)\n\nColin Tyndall de ffrayser. Badge. (Fieldless) A dragon sable, crowned Or and sustainin"
