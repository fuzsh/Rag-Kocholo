        "text": "Precursors\n\nThe outlines of the continents flanking the Atlantic Ocean are so similar that their correspondence was apparent as soon as accurate maps became available. The earliest references to this similarity were made in 1596 by Flemish cartographer Abraham Ortelius and later in 1620 by the English philosopher Francis Bacon, in his book Novum Organum, and by French naturalist Georges-Louis Leclerc, count de Buffon, a century later. Toward the end of the 18th century, Alexander von Humboldt, a German naturalist, suggested that the lands bordering the Atlantic Ocean had once been joined.\n\nIn 1858 French geographer Antonio Snider-Pellegrini proposed that identical fossil plants in North American and European coal deposits could be explained if the two continents had formerly been connected. He suggested that the biblical Flood was due to the fragmentation of this continent, which was torn apart to restore the balance of a lopsided Earth. In the late 19th century the Austrian geologist Eduard Suess proposed that large ancient continents had been composed of several of the present-day smaller ones. According to this hypothesis, portions of a single enormous southern continent—designated Gondwana (or Gondwanaland)—foundered to create the Atlantic and Indian oceans. Such sunken lands, along with vanished land bridges, were frequently invoked in the late 1800s to explain sediment sources apparently present in the ocean and to account for floral and faunal connections between continents. These explanations remained popular until the 1950s and stimulated belief in the ancient submerged continent of Atlantis.\n\nIn 1908 American geologist Frank B. Taylor postulated that the arcuate (bow-shaped) mountain belts of Asia and Europe resulted from the creep of the continents toward the Equator. His analysis of tectonic features foreshadowed in many ways modern thought regarding plate collisions.\n\nAlfred Wegener and the concept of continental drift\n\nIn 1912 German meteorologist Alfred Wegener, impressed by the similarity of the geography of the Atlantic coastlines, explicitly presented the concept of continental drift. Though plate tectonics is by no means synonymous with continental drift, the term encompasses this idea and derives much of its impact from it.\n\nWegener came to consider the existence of a single supercontinent from about 350 million to 245 million years ago, during the late Paleozoic Era and early Mesozoic Era, and named it Pangea, meaning “all lands.” He searched the geologic and paleontological literature for evidence supporting the continuity of geologic features across the Indian and Atlantic oceans during that time period, which he assumed had formed during the Mesozoic Era (about 252 million to 66 million years ago). He presented the idea of continental drift and some of the supporting evidence in a lecture in 1912, followed by his major published work, The Origin of Continents and Oceans (1915).\n\nIsostasy\n\nWegener pointed out that the concept of isostasy (the ideal theoretical balance of all large portions of Earth’s lithosphere as though they were floating on the denser underlying layer) rendered the existence of large sunken continental blocks, as envisaged by Suess, geophysically impossible. He concluded that if the continents had been once joined together, the consequence would have been drift of their fragments and not their foundering. The assumption of a former single continent could be tested geologically, and Wegener displayed a large array of data that supported his hypothesis, ranging from the continuity of fold belts across oceans, the presence of identical rocks and fossils on continents now separated by oceans, and the paleobiogeographic and paleoclimatological record that indicated otherwise unaccountable shifts in Earth’s major climate belts. He further argued that if continents could move up and down in the mantle as a result of buoyancy changes produced by erosion or deposition, they should be able to move horizontally as well.\n\nDriving forces\n\nThe main stumbling block to the acceptance of Wegener’s hypothesis was the driving forces he proposed. Wegener described the drift of continents as a flight from the poles due to Earth’s equatorial bulge. Although these forces do exist, Wegener’s nemesis, British geophysicist Sir Harold Jeffreys, demonstrated that these forces are much too weak for the task. Another mechanism proposed by Wegener, tidal forces on Earth’s crust produced by gravitational pull of the Moon, were also shown to be entirely inadequate.\n\nWegener’s proposition was attentively received by many European geologists, and in England Arthur Holmes pointed out that the lack of a driving force was insufficient grounds for rejecting the entire concept. In 1929 Holmes proposed an alternative mechanism—convection of the mantle—which remains today a serious candidate for the force driving the plates. Wegener’s ideas also were well received by geologists in the Southern Hemisphere. One of them, the South African Alexander Du Toit, remained an ardent believer. After Wegener’s death, Du Toit continued to amass further evidence in support of continental drift."
