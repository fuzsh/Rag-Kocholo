        "text": "Use of ancient religious symbol\n\nThe swastika (from Sanskrit svástika) is an ancient Eurasian religious symbol that generally takes the form of an equilateral cross with four legs each bent at 90 degrees in either right-facing (卐) form or left-facing (卍) form.[2][3] It is considered to be a sacred and auspicious symbol in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism and dates back at least 11,000 years.[4]\n\nThe swastika (gammadion, fylfot) symbol became a popular symbol of luck in the Western world in the early 20th century, as it had long been in Asia, and was often used for ornamentation. The Nazi Party adopted the symbol in the 1920s,[5] and its use in Western countries faded after the Nazi association became dominant in the 1930s.[6] In recent decades many public swastikas have been removed or covered over, although some have been retained.\n\nBackground\n\n[edit]\n\nThe discovery of the Indo-European language group in the 1790s led to a great effort by European archaeologists to link the pre-history of European people to the hypothesised ancient \"Aryans\" (variously referring to the Indo-Iranians or the Proto-Indo-Europeans). Following his discovery of objects bearing the swastika square in the ruins of Troy, Heinrich Schliemann consulted two leading Sanskrit scholars of the day, Emile Burnouf and Max Müller. Schliemann concluded that the Swastika square was a specifically Indo-European symbol, and associated it with the ancient migrations of Proto-Indo-Europeans. He connected it with similar shapes found on ancient pots in Germany, and theorised that the swastika square was a \"significant religious symbol of our remote ancestors\", linking Germanic, Greek and Indo-Iranian cultures.[7][8] Later discoveries of the motif among the remains of the Hittites and of ancient Iran seemed to confirm this theory, but the symbol was also known for its use by indigenous American Indians as well as Eastern cultures.\n\nThe word \"swastika\" was absorbed into English in the late 19th century.[9]\n\nBy the early 20th century it was used worldwide and was regarded as a symbol of good luck. The swastika's worldwide use was well documented in an 1894 publication by the Smithsonian.[10] The symbol appeared in many popular, non-political Western designs from the 1880s to the 1920s, with occasional use continuing into the 1930s.\n\nWestern use of the motif was subverted in the early 20th century after it was adopted as the emblem of the Nazi Party. The swastika was used as a conveniently eye-catching symbol to emphasise the so-called Aryan-German correspondence and instill racial pride. Since World War II, most Westerners have known the swastika as a Nazi symbol, leading to confusion about its sacred religious and historical status.\n\nEurope\n\n[edit]\n\nDenmark\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Danish brewery company Carlsberg Group used the swastika as a logo[11] from the 19th century until the middle of the 1930s, when it was discontinued because of association with the Nazi Party in neighbouring Germany. However, the swastika carved on elephants at the entrance gates of the company's headquarters in Copenhagen in 1901 can still be seen today.[12]\n\nFinland\n\n[edit]\n\nIn Finland, the swastika (Finnish: hakaristi) was used as the official national marking of the Finnish Defence Forces between 1918 and 1945 and also of the Finnish Air Force, anti-aircraft troops as a part of the air force and tank troops at that time. The swastika was also used by the Lotta Svärd organisation, a Finnish paramilitary organisation for women, which was dissolved in 1944 according to the terms of the Moscow Armistice.\n\nThe tursaansydän, an elaboration on the swastika, is used by scouts in some instances and by a student organization.[which?] The Finnish village of Tursa uses the tursaansydän as a kind of a certificate of authenticity on products made there, and is the origin of this name of the symbol (meaning 'heart of Tursa'), which is also known as the mursunsydän ('walrus-heart'). Traditional textiles are still made in Finland with swastikas as parts of traditional ornaments.\n\nThe Finnish Airforce units still wear a swastika on their colours.[13][14] In addition, the shoulder insignia of the Airforce Headquarters bears a swastika design.[15] In 1945, the Air Force changed its national emblem to a roundel, but the use of swastika in some other insignia was continued. In 1958, the President of Finland Urho Kekkonen inaugurated the colours of the Air Force units which feature a swastika design. The latest colour of this pattern was inaugurated by president Tarja Halonen 25 October 2005 for the newly formed Air Force Academy.[15] Also the Utti Jaeger Regiment, responsible for training special forces, bears a swastika-like emblem (sun cross) on its colour. In January 2017, the Air Force Command replaced its emblem, which had contained a swastika, with a design reminiscent of the Air Force service emblem; a golden eagle and a circle of wings.[16]\n\nThe swastika has not disappeared in Finnish medals and decorations. The decorations of the Order of the Cross of Liberty, designed by Akseli Gallen-Kallela – who also designed the emblem of the Finnish Air Force and the Finnish flight mark in 1918 – bears a swastika laid on a George's Cross. The President of Finland uses a Cross of Liberty in the personal flag. However, in the flag is only the 3rd Cross of Liberty, although the highest Finnish decoration is the Grand Cross of the White Rose of Finland with Collar. During the Continuation War and immediately after the wars, 191 soldiers were appointed Knights of the Mannerheim Cross.\n\nFrance\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1917, René Croste identified the swastika and the Basque lauburu.[17] The tourism industry and promoters of Basque culture in the French Basque Country used both for souvenirs and general Basque symbolism. In 1935, the Musée Basque of Bayonne asked to avoid the swastika for its Nazi association and use the lauburu. It was however contested by Ph. Aranart who saw both as Christian crosses. The success of the campaign was not total and the German occupiers of the French Basque Country were surprised to find swastikas in tombs, frontons, and houses. Basque collaborationists attempted to take advantage of the similarity.[citation needed] After the Second World War, the swastika was not considered a Basque symbol any more.[18]\n\nGermany\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Swastika saw use by nationalist movements before the Nazis emerged into prominence: the Bundesarchiv has photos from the 1920 Kapp Putsch showing Marinebrigade Ehrhardt Freikorps using the symbol, however, it was not the most important symbol of the putschists.\n\nIceland\n\n[edit]\n\nEimskipafélag Íslands (founded in 1914), a major shipping company in Iceland, once used a variation on the swastika as their company logo. The appearance was similar to a blue fylfot on a white circle. Usage continued after World War II – MV Gullfoss in service from 1950 to 1972 had the symbol in a roundel on the ship's prow. Although they have since replaced their logo, the swastika remained on their old headquarters, located in downtown Reykjavík. When the Radisson SAS hotel franchise bought the building, the company was banned from destroying the symbol since the building was on the list of historical sites in Iceland. A compromise was made when the company was allowed to cover the symbol with the numbers 1919 which was the year when the building was erected.[19]\n\nIreland\n\n[edit]\n\nAncient swastikas are found sparingly throughout Ireland, starting in the 5th-7th centuries AD.[20]\n\nIn Dublin, Ireland, a laundry company known as the Swastika Laundry existed for many years in Dartry and Ballsbridge (both on the river Dodder) on the south side of the city. It was founded in 1888 as the Dublin Laundry Company.[21] Upon the outbreak of World War II in 1939, the company's customers were concerned about the company's name. Accordingly, it was changed to \"Swastika Laundry (1912) Ltd\". The company's fleet of electric delivery vans were red, and featured a black swastika on a white background.[21]\n\nThe business started in the early 20th century and continued up until recent times.[when?] The Laundry's tall chimneystack was emblazoned with a large white swastika, a protected structure,[22] which was clearly visible from the surrounding streets. The name and logo eventually disappeared when the laundry was absorbed into the Spring Grove company.\n\nIn his Irisches Tagebuch (Irish Journal), the future Nobel Laureate, Heinrich Böll writes about a year spent living in the west of Ireland in the 1950s. While in Dublin before heading to Co. Mayo, he:\n\n... was almost run over by a bright-red panel truck whose sole decoration was a big swastika. Had someone sold Völkischer Beobachter delivery trucks here, or did the Völkischer Beobachter still have a branch office here? This one looked exactly like those I remembered; but the driver crossed himself as he smilingly signalled to me to proceed, and on closer inspection I saw what had happened. It was simply the \"Swastika Laundry\", which had painted the year of its founding, 1912, clearly beneath the swastika; but the mere possibility that it might have been one of those others was enough to take my breath away.[23]\n\nLatvia\n\n[edit]\n\nIn Latvia, too, the swastika (known as Fire Cross, Latvian: ugunskrusts, or Thunder Cross, Latvian: pērkonkrusts) was used as the marking of the Latvian Air Force between 1918 and 1934, as well as in insignias of some military units.[24] It was also used as a symbol by the Latvian fascist movement Pērkonkrusts, as well as by other organisations.\n\nThe Latvian left-facing swastika or Thunder Cross dates back to Bronze Age. It is widely seen scratched on surfaces like rocks, and on weapons and pottery as a protector sign.\n\nNorway\n\n[edit]\n\nThe iron balconies of the building facing Veiten in Bergen are also decorated with swastikas. While it may appear that they date back to World War II, as they face the old Gestapo headquarters, they are actually twenty years older.[25][26]\n\nMikal Sylten took up the swastika as a symbol in 1917 for his antisemitic periodical Nationalt Tidsskrift.[27]\n\nPoland\n\n[edit]\n\nSince the early Middle Ages the sign of the swastika was well established among all Slavic lands. Known as swarzyca,[28] it was primarily associated with one of the Slavic gods named Svarog.\n\nWith time the association with Slavic gods faded, but the swastika was preserved both as a personal symbol of various personalities, such as the Boreyko Coat of Arms, and in folk culture, for example, in the region of Podhale, where the swastika was used as a talisman well into the 20th century. As a solar symbol, it was painted or carved on various parts of houses in the Tatra Mountains and was thought to save the household from evil.\n\nThe ancient symbol used by the Góral societies was adopted by the Polish mountain infantry units in the 1920s. It was adopted as a regimental insignia by the artillery units of the 21st and 22nd Infantry Divisions, as well as by the soldiers of the 4th Legions' Infantry, the 2nd and the 4th Podhale Rifles. A distinctive blue swastika was a background emblem of the Air defence and Anti-gas League (1928–1939, LOPP), which had circa 1.5 million members in 1937.\n\nOutside of the military traditions, the mountaineer's swastika also influenced a number of other symbols and logos used on Polish soil. Among them were the logo of the IGNIS publishing company (est. 1822), and the personal symbol of Mieczysław Karłowicz, a notable composer and admirer of the Tatras. After his death in the mountains in 1909, the place of his death was marked by a memorial stone and a swastika.[29]\n\nRussia\n\n[edit]\n\nThe left-facing swastika was a favorite sign of the last Russian Empress Alexandra Feodorovna. She placed it where she could for happiness, including drawing it in pencil on the walls and windows in the Ipatiev House – where the royal family was executed. There, she also drew a swastika on the wallpaper above the bed where the heir apparently slept.[30]\n\nThe Russian Provisional Government of 1917 printed a number of new bank notes with right-facing, diagonally rotated swastikas in their centres[31] The banknote design was initially intended for the Mongolian national bank but was re-purposed for Russian ruble after the February revolution. During the Russian Civil War, the Red Army's Kalmyk units wore distinct armbands featuring the swastika with \"РСФСР\" (Roman:\"RSFSR\") inscriptions on them.[32][33][34]\n\nIn 1922, People's Commissar of Education Anatoly Lunacharsky issued a warning prohibiting further use of the swastika in the Soviet Union because of its association with fascism:\n\nDue to a misunderstanding, an ornament called a swastika is constantly used on many decorations and posters. Since the swastika is a cockade of the deeply counter-revolutionary German organization Orgesch, and has recently acquired the character of a symbolic sign of the entire fascist reactionary movement, artists are warned in not to use this ornament under any circumstances as it induces a deeply negative impression, especially in foreigners.[35][36]\n\nSpain\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1914, Euzkeltzale-Bazkuna, the group promoting the Basque language in the Bilbao branch of the Basque Nationalist Party proposed a swastika as a silver lapel pin to mark Basque speakers. They considered the curvilinear lauburu and the rectilinear swastika as primitive Basque symbols. Later Euzkadi advertised the sale of this badge, the euskalorratza, \"Basque needle\". As time passed, it became associated to Basque nationalism. Its use became more common from 1931 and the Second Spanish Republic. Giant swastikas were painted in the campaign for the Basque Autonomy Act of 1933.[citation needed]\n\nIn 1932, the leftist Basque Nationalist Action (EAE-ANV) chose for its flag a white swastika in a green six-pointed star. The swastika was variously said to represent the Basque language and race or happiness, living together.[citation needed]\n\nBy the end of the Republic, the confusion of the Basque nationalist swastika (horizontal and vertical) with the Nazi version (tilted 45 degrees) led to substitution of the \"Basque swastika\" with the lauburu. However, during the Spanish Civil War, some mendigoxale (\"mountaineer\") corps still used swastikas in their flags. The bombing of Gernika by the swastika-bearing German Legion Condor would make clear the incompatibility of both swastika uses. The flag used by EAE-ANV during the war already used a lauburu instead of a swastika.[citation needed]\n\nIn 1962, it was possible to find typed swastikas in ETA's clandestine organ Zutik due to the technical difficulty of drawing a lauburu. In 1981, the old nationalist Zurizpi tried to claim the swastika for the Basques but had no success.\n\nSweden\n\n[edit]\n\nThe 1872 painting Thor's Fight with the Giants by the Swedish artist Mårten Eskil Winge features a swastika clearly visible in Thor's belt.\n\nThe Swedish company ASEA, now a part of Asea Brown Boveri, used the swastika in its logo from the 1890s to 1933, when it was removed from the logo.[citation needed]\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Anglo-Indian author Rudyard Kipling (1865–1936), who was strongly influenced by Indian culture, used a swastika as his personal emblem on the covers and flyleaves of many editions of his books, along with the elephant, signifying his affinity with India. With the rise of Nazism, Kipling ceased to use the swastika. One of his Just So Stories, \"The Crab That Played with the Sea\", included an elaborate full-page illustration by Kipling including a stone bearing what was called \"a magic mark\" (a swastika); some later editions of the stories blotted out the mark on the stone, but left the caption unaltered, leaving readers puzzled.\n\nDuring the First World War, the swastika was used as the emblem of the British National War Savings Committee.[38][39]\n\nThe swastika was also used as a symbol by the Boy Scouts in Britain, and worldwide. According to \"Johnny\" Walker, the earliest Scouting use was on the first Thanks Badge introduced in 1911.[40] Robert Baden-Powell's 1922 Medal of Merit design added a swastika to the Scouting fleur-de-lis as a token of good luck for the person receiving the medal. Like Kipling, Baden-Powell would have come across this symbol in India. During 1934, many Scouters requested a change of design because of the use of the swastika by the Nazis. A new British Medal of Merit was issued in 1935.\n\nA bank in Bolton has refused to remove swastika mosaic tiles from the entry of a branch office constructed in 1927. A bank spokesperson replied to critics noting that \"At that time, these symbols were commonly used as architectural decoration.\"[41]\n\nLocated on the Woodhouse Crag, on the northern edge of Ilkley Moor in West Yorkshire there is a swastika-shaped pattern engraved in a stone, known as the Swastika Stone. The figure in the foreground of the picture is a 20th-century replica; the original carving can be seen a little further away, at the centre-left of the picture.[42]\n\nThere are both left- and right-facing swastikas on the war memorial at the entrance to Balmoral Castle in Scotland.[43]\n\nThere is a swastika-like tile pattern on the floor of the entrance hall of Upminster Bridge tube station in London, opened in 1934.[44]\n\nThe druids in the mid-1920s adorned their dress with swastikas.[45][46]\n\nThere is a fylfot made into the brickwork on a building inside the British Aerospace factory in Broughton in Wales. It is unknown why the fylfot was put on a brick, but it has been suggested[by whom?] it was done so because it was an ancient Asian peace symbol. The current Broughton site which makes wings for the Airbus has a history of fighter plane construction going back to WWI.\n\nThe Royal Air Force's 273 Squadron adopted a cruciform fylfot as opposed to the Nazi Swastika which was a reversed fylfot, which it used as a squadron badge. It was around since the earliest RAF in 1918 and was an emblem for the Ceylon Fighter Defence in 1939.[47][48]\n\nThe Essex County Council headquarters in Chelmsford features engraved swastika facing both left and right. Construction began in 1928; the building was finished in 1939, the same year Britain declared war on Nazi Germany. The architectural design had been finalized years before.[49]\n\nMany churches and cathedrals in the UK feature swastika motifs.[50][51]\n\nNorth America\n\n[edit]\n\nCanada\n\n[edit]\n\nSwastika is the name of a small residential community in northern Ontario, Canada, approximately 580 kilometres (360 miles) north of Toronto, and 5 kilometres (3 miles) west of Kirkland Lake, the town of which it is now part. The town of Swastika was founded in 1906. Gold was discovered nearby and the Swastika Mining Company was formed in 1908. The government of Ontario attempted to change the town's name during World War II, but the town resisted and many posted signs \"To hell with Hitler. We came up with our name first!\". The Swastika United Church is located in Swastika, Ontario, as is the Swastika Public School, Swastika Fire Hall and Swastika Laboratories, which provides assaying services for the mining industry.[52]\n\nIn Puslinch, Ontario, a private road called Swastika Trail has been the subject of debate for years. In 2020, Divisional Court declined to overturn the township's decision to keep the name despite the objection of some residents.[53]\n\nIn Windsor, Nova Scotia, there was the Windsor Swastikas ice hockey team from 1905 to 1916, and their uniforms featured swastika symbols. There were also hockey teams named the Swastikas in Edmonton, Alberta (circa 1916), and the Fernie Swastikas in Fernie, British Columbia (circa 1922).\n\nThe Traveller's Hotel[54] in downtown Ladysmith, British Columbia, has a façade decorated with brickwork swastikas. Further north on Vancouver Island, the Japanese cemetery in Cumberland has several grave markers decorated with swastikas.\n\nA repeating pattern of swastikas appeared on a few Canadian postage stamps[55] that were produced by commercial airlines from 1924 to 1932.[56]\n\nThere used to be a swastika brick pattern located outside at the top of a house located at 75–81 Troy Street, in Verdun, a borough of Montreal, Quebec.[57]\n\nThe swastika was also used as border art for the weekly pet health column in the Calgary Herald newspaper in the early years of the 20th century.[58]\n\nCentral America\n\n[edit]\n\nA swastika shape is a symbol in the culture of the Guna people of Guna Yala, Panama. In Guna tradition it symbolises the octopus that created the world, its tentacles pointing to the four cardinal points.[59] In February 1925, the Guna revolted vigorously against Panamanian suppression of their culture, and in 1930 they assumed autonomy. The flag they adopted at that time is based on the swastika shape, and remains the official flag of Guna Yala. A number of variations on the flag have been used over the years: red top and bottom bands instead of orange were previously used, and in 1942 a ring (representing the traditional Guna nose-ring) was added to the center of the flag to distance it from the symbol of the Nazi party.[60]\n\nUnited States\n\n[edit]\n\nAs a Native American symbol\n\n[edit]\n\nBecause this was a popular symbol with the Navajo people, the Arizona State Highway Department marked its state highways with signs featuring a right-facing swastika superimposed on an arrowhead.[62] In 1942, after the United States entered World War Two, the department replaced the signs.\n\nThe original Penobscot Building in Detroit, Michigan, completed about 1906, \"was named after the Penobscot Indian tribe and region of Maine, the boyhood home of one of the investors. An interesting feature in the Indian-themed detail of the building is the occasional appearance of a swastika, a symbol important to the Penobscots long before it was adopted by the Nazi party.\"[63] The decorative symbols feature right-facing arms and are tilted in the same manner as the Nazi flag, leading to confusion over their origin.\n\nThe Passamaquoddy Nation, whose homeland within Dawnland extends across the Canada–United States border between Maine and New Brunswick, used an elongated swastika on their war canoes in the American colonial period as well as later.[64] A carving of a canoe with a Passamaquody swastika was found in a ruin in the Argonne Forest in France, having been carved there by Moses Neptune, an American soldier of Passamaquody heritage, who was one of the last American soldiers to die in battle in World War I.[65]\n\nShortly after the beginning of World War II, several Native American tribes (the Navajo, Apache, Tohono O'odham, and Hopi) published a decree stating that they would no longer use the swastika in their artwork:\n\nBecause the above ornament which has been a symbol of friendship among our forefathers for many centuries has been desecrated recently by another nation of peoples. Therefore it is resolved that henceforth from this date on and forever more our tribes renounce the use of the emblem commonly known today as the swastika or fylfot on our blankets, baskets, art objects, sandpainting, and clothing.[66]\n\nUse by the military\n\n[edit]\n\nThe 45th Infantry Division of the United States Army used a yellow swastika on a red background as a unit symbol until the 1930s, when it was switched to a thunderbird.[67][68][69] The American Division wore the swastika patch while fighting against Germany in World War I.\n\nThe Lafayette Escadrille squadron flew World War I fighters against Germany from 1916 to 1918, first as volunteers under French command and later as a United States unit.[70] The official squadron insignia was a Native American with a swastika adorned headdress. Some of the squadron planes also bore a large swastika in addition to the squadron insignia.[71]\n\nAmong the Lafayette Escadrille members who were killed in action was Arthur Bluethenthal of Wilmington, North Carolina, who is buried in a Jewish cemetery with a grave marker that includes the squadron insignia, complete with swastika.[72]\n\nThe U.S. Army 12th Infantry Regiment coat of arms includes a number of historic symbols. A tepee with small, left facing swastikas represents the unit's campaigns in the Indian Wars of the late 19th century. The Regiment fought German forces during World War II, landing on D-Day at Utah Beach, through five European campaigns and received a Presidential Unit Citation for action during the Battle of the Bulge.\n\nGovernment use\n\n[edit]\n\nSwastikas surround the exterior window iconography at the Marriner S. Eccles Federal Reserve Board Building in Washington D.C. on Constitution Avenue between 20th and 21st Streets. The building was designed by Paul Philippe Cret and completed in 1937. Cret fought against Germany during World War I while serving in the French army.[73]\n\nThe Reno, Nevada Post Office features both left and right facing swastikas, along with other designs typical of \"Zig Zag Moderne\" style, later known as a variation of \"Art Deco\". It was designed in 1932 by Frederic Joseph DeLongchamps, who had previously served as the Nevada State Architect.[74] The building was financed in part by the federal Civil Works Administration and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.\n\nThe Allentown, Pennsylvania Post Office, built in 1934, included inlaid swastika floor tiles. In 1965 The General Services Administration removed tiles with arms facing to the right, but retained some with arms facing to the left.[75]\n\nThe six-story Federal Building in downtown Albuquerque, New Mexico features a Mediterranean style and decorative Native American design motifs. Built in 1930, its decorative features include \"Radiators set in each wall of the foyer [that] are hidden by brass grilles in a swastika design\".[76] It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1980.[77]\n\nThe third La Crosse County, Wisconsin courthouse was built in 1903 and razed in 1965. Numerous swastika patterns are visible in photographs of a mosaic tile floor. The symbols have shortened arms pointing to the left.[78]\n\nThe DeKalb County Courthouse in Sycamore, Illinois, built in 1905, includes swastika decorated railings. The Classical Revival style courthouse was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.\n\nSwastikas are a minor feature in painted murals in the Allen County Courthouse in Fort Wayne, Indiana, completed in 1902. They are described as \"a Native American symbol for joy\".[79] The murals were restored beginning in 1994 as part of an eight-year, $8.6 million project. The courthouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976, and as a National Historic Landmark in 2003.[80]\n\nMosaic swastika tile patterns decorate the floor of the Washington County Courthouse in Marietta, Ohio, designed by Cincinnati architect Samuel Hannaford and built in 1901. The tiles are described as \"an adopted Indian symbol for 'good luck and prosperity.'\"[81]\n\nSwastikas are featured on a Native American figure on a plaque outside the Brown County courthouse in New Ulm Minnesota.\n\nIn 2017, a candidate for the Cedar Rapids, Iowa city council called for removal or alteration of a Native American scene in a restored 200-foot long City Hall mural because it contains a swastika symbol. The mural was created in 1936, part of the federal Treasury Relief Art Project when the building served as a federal courthouse.[82] Several images in the mural had generated complaints for decades, resulting in it being painted over and then restored, twice.[83]\n\nThe Laguna Bridge[84] in Yuma, Arizona was built in 1905 by the U.S. Reclamation Department and is decorated with a row of swastikas with right-facing arms.[85][86] \"These symbols, the Yuma Sun writes, stem from a trip the project engineers took to India, where they “came across a symbol that represented a Hindu goddess with power over water.\" The bridge is part of the Laguna Diversion Dam project, based on examples in India of a weir design that fit local conditions. [87]\n\nDisplayed with Christian and Jewish symbols\n\n[edit]\n\nSeveral examples of U.S. architectural decoration feature swastikas displayed alongside other religious symbols.\n\nThe Baháʼí Faith's House of Worship for the North American continent, located in Wilmette, Illinois, depicts religious symbols on each of its 9 outer pillars. \"The symbols are arranged in chronological order-from bottom to top-on the pillars. That's why the swastika is at the base, with the Star of David above it...\"[88] The design dates to 1920 but construction was not completed until 1953. The largest Baháʼí House of Worship in the world, the white domed building has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1978.\n\nThe \"Golden Rule Window\" in the Transfiguration Episcopal Church in New York City features medallion symbols depicting world religions, with Buddhism represented by the \"flyflot cross\" near a Jewish menorah. Built in 1849 with several modifications through 1926, the church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. During the Civil War the church worked for abolition of slavery and harboured runaway slaves.[89]\n\nA student union at the University of Michigan includes a 1929 chapel with stained glass windows that feature religious symbols. A swastika with right-facing arms is included, along with a Christian cross, Hebrew star and others.[90]\n\nThe Yerkes Observatory in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, established in 1897 by the University of Chicago, includes ornate decoration. The rotunda includes a swastika symbol adjacent to a Star of David.[91]\n\nPlacenames\n\n[edit]\n\nSwastika Park is the name of a housing subdivision in Miami, Florida, created in 1917.[92]\n\nA subdivision of Cherry Hills Village, Colorado was named \"Swastika Acres\" until April 16, 2019, when it was renamed to Old Cherry Hills.[93] The name had been traced to the Denver Swastika Land Company, founded in 1908.[94]\n\nSwastika, New York,[95] located near the Adirondack Park preserve in the northeast corner of the state, which is adjacent to \"Swastika Road\". In 2020 the town voted to keep the name despite its connotations.[96]\n\nThe \"Swastika Trail\" is a historic auto trail in Iowa.[97]\n\nAs early as 1914, \"Swastika Beach\" was recorded as the name of the unincorporated community at the southwest end of Fish Lake in Jackson County, Minnesota.[98]\n\nSwastika Lake is located in Albany County, Wyoming, in Medicine Bow – Routt National Forest.[99]\n\nCommercial use\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the early 1900s, swastikas were included on postcards wishing people good luck.[100][1] By 29 December 1908, the Stanford Card Co. of Brooklyn New York was using swastikas.[1] A red coloured swastika was also found on a 1910 postcard.[100]\n\nIn the 1920s the Coca-Cola made 'lucky' brass watch fobs in the form of a swastika to advertise their product.[101]\n\nThe K-R-I-T Motor Car Company, Detroit, Michigan built cars from 1909 to 1915 with a radiator badge that featured a right-facing white swastika on a blue background.[102]\n\nThe Crane Valve Company manufactured steel valves in the 1920s and 30s in the U.S. with swastika markings, using a symbol with the arms pointed to the right.[103]\n\nThe Buffum Tool Company of Louisiana, Missouri manufactured \"High Grade Tools for High Grade Workmen\" from about 1909 to 1922.[104] The Buffum company's trademark was a swastika with right facing arms. During World War I it made bayonets and aeroplane parts. The company's logo was the \"Good Luck/Blessing/Swastika Cross\" and many of the products, sold nationwide, had \"the good luck cross on them.\"[105][104]\n\nThe Washington Charcrete Company manufactured \"laundry trays\" (concrete utility sinks) with an imprinted logo bearing a swastika. Some examples survive,[106][107] but the date of their manufacture is unknown. The company did business in the states of Washington and Oregon and is mentioned in a 1914 ruling by the Supreme Court of Washington State.[108]\n\nThe Duplex Adding Machine Company of St. Louis, Missouri issued stock certificates in 1910 that show the company's logo, a swastika with right-facing arms and math symbols.[109]\n\nFlour was sold under the brand name Swastika, The Lucky Flour by the Federal Milling Co., Lockport, N.Y. as advertised in 1909,[110] and by the Monte Vista Milling and Elevator Company of Colorado, which registered the name in 1910.[111]\n\nThe Downtown Historic District in Raton, New Mexico, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, includes the Swastika Coal office and Swastika Hotel buildings.\n\nThe mining town of Lakeview Idaho featured a \"Swastika Hotel\" in 1910, owned and operated by the Swastika Mining Company.[112]\n\nThe St. Louis, Rocky Mountain and Pacific Railroad Company operated with cars and locomotives \"emblazoned with the red swastika symbol adopted as the road's trademark.\" The symbol featured right facing arms and was tilted at an angle. The 105-mile \"Swastika Line\" operated from about 1902 to 1915, with major stops at Raton and Cimarron, New Mexico. The tracks were torn up for scrap during World War II when \"Swastika Line iron was used to fight a different kind of swastika in Europe.\"[113]\n\nA \"Swastika Theater\" operated in Sausalito, California in the early 20th century.[114] Another \"Swastika Theater\" operated in Akron, Indiana.[115] The historic Strand Theatre, in Louisville, Mississippi, built in 1923 includes a facade with a left facing swastika. [116]\n\nThe Swastika Novelty Company of Charleston, West Virginia, made a \"talking board\", similar to a Ouija board, in 1907.[117]\n\n\"Swastika Boards\" were built using laminated redwood and balsa wood by legendary surfer Lorrin \"Whitey\" Harrison in Los Angeles from 1931 until 1939 when they were renamed \"Waikiki Surfboards\"[118] Swastikas became the most widely used production solid board of the period leading into World War II.\"[119]\n\nStates Steamship Company painted a black swastika on the red funnels of their ships. This was changed in the 1940s to a white sun cross on a blue background and in the 1950s to a red seahorse.[120]\n\nIn popular culture\n\n[edit]\n\nThe swastika is seen on binders of pre-Nazi era publications of works by Rudyard Kipling. Both left and right orientations were used.\n\nTwo white swastika symbols on an Indian blanket made an appearance in the 1922 Buster Keaton silent movie \"The Paleface\". A newspaper columnist noted Nazis had adopted the swastika in 1920, prior to the film's release, but that \"Only a bonehead would read anything sinister into that coincidence.\"[121]\n\nPublisher Harold Hersey adopted a blue swastika as a symbol for his line of pulp magazines, Magazine Publishers. When the company was purchased by A. A. Wyn in 1929, the swastika was replaced with an Ace of Spades.[122]\n\nSwastika quilt patterns were popular in America prior to World War II.[123] In 2010, the Greeley Museums in Greeley, Colorado, received a donated quilt covered in 27 swastikas, believed to date to around 1900. \"The swastika quilt-block pattern is also known as the Battle X of Thor, Catch Me If You Can, Devil's Dark Horse, Whirligig and Zig Zag\" according to the museum registrar. The quilt was not put on general display while museum officials considered how to provide context.[124]\n\nA quilt with swastika-like pattern dating to 1927 was removed from display from a Havre, Montana museum in December 2010 after complaints from the public. A group of residents of the Bear's Paw Mountains had embroidered their names in the historic quilt, a gift for an ill neighbour. \"It was a very, very nice quilt and the story behind it was absolutely heartwarming\" according to a member of the museum foundation.[125]\n\nMetal typeface Swastika borders were used by U.S. printers in the early 20th century.[126] Controversy arose in 1937 when they appeared on Passaic, New Jersey sample election ballots. The printer responded, \"I've used the swastika emblems for ballot borders long before the world ever knew Hitler.\"[full citation needed]\n\nIn the 1925 novel The Great Gatsby, one of the characters runs a business called \"The Swastika Holding Company\".\n\nOne of the few examples of its decorative use in Post-war American popular culture can be found in the 1950 George Cukor film Born Yesterday. Wallpaper featuring prominent gold swastikas serve as the background to many scenes involving Broderick Crawford's character, Harry Brock.\n\nUse by non-political clubs and organizations\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Ladies' Home Journal sponsored a Girl's Club with swastika membership pins, swastika-decorated handkerchief and a magazine titled \"The Swastika\". Their version of the symbol was square with right facing arms. The club was formed at the beginning of the 20th century to encourage young women to sell magazine subscriptions.[128]\n\nThe 1939 Tennessee State University yearbook lists a \"Swastika Club\" among women's student organisations. The group focused on literature, scholarship and \"clear and straight thinking\". Tennessee State is the only state-funded historically black university in Tennessee.[129]\n\nThe yearbook for Catawba College in Salisbury, North Carolina, first published in 1927, was known as the \"Swastika\", after a Native American design pattern found in the original tile of a campus administration building.

The tokens that can be dated range from 1885 to 1939, with a few later exceptions. About 57 percent have the swastika symbol facing to the left, 43 percent to the right. Most promise good luck or feature other symbols such as a horseshoe, four leaf clover, rabbit's foot, wishbone or keys.[136]\n\nIn 1925, Coca-Cola made a lucky watch fob in the shape of a swastika with right-facing arms and the slogan, \"Drink Coca-Cola five cents in bottles\".\n\nThe Waterloo Gasoline Engine Company of Waterloo, Iowa offered a \"Good Luck\" token featuring a left facing swastika in addition to a four-leaf clover, horseshoe, wishbone and Plains Indian emblem.

The five swastika tiles alternated with a related design featuring the Lauburu or \"Basque cross\".[184] The upper church's final design was created by the local architectural firm of Nairne W. Fisher, who had fought against Germany during World War I.[185] Three of the tiles were destroyed in the process of removal; one was put on permanent display at the church. The removal was prompted in part by criticism from some current and former faculty at St. Cloud State University, where the university's electronic diversity newsletter featured a series of articles[186] that claimed by 1920 it was already \"the symbol of Aryan conquest and mastery.\"[186]\n\nOther Catholic Cathedrals that include swastika tiles among their decorations include: Saint Joseph Cathedral,[187] Wheeling, West Virginia, a Romanesque design by architect Edward J.
