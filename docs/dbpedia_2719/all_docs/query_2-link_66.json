        "meta_description": "Illustrated with hand colored woodcuts.\nShort stories for children about the rewards for behaving correctly and the punishments and lessons for those who are bad.\nReview from the American Journal of Education for the year 1927: \"This excellent little volume might be used in the nursery, long before any thought was entertained of a child being employed in learning to read. Mothers and nurses should have their memories stored with such simple and interesting little stories. The recital of one of them will do more to sweeten the habitual temper of a child, or even to claim the passions when excited than any course of indulgence or punishment which a misguided ingenuity could devise. Along with these good moral results, there would be the direct cultivation of the habit of attention, that invaluable prequisite to all improvement.\"\nNew edition.\nThe top illustration depicts the third story in which a young boy learns not to abuse animals.  The boy delights in throwing stones at animals, but once he realizes that both people and animals think he is quite a bad boy, he resolves to behave better so that everyone will like him again. Here he is depicted being attacked by a swan.\nThe bottom illustration depicts the fourth story in which two young boys are taken to the fair as a reward for their good behavior. When they got home, they share their cakes from the fair with their friends.",
