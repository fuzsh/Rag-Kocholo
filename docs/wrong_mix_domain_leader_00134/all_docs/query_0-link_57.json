Please visit the Student Financial Services site for more information on eligibility for financial aid, types of aid available, and application procedures.\n\nTo assist especially high-caliber applicants, the Democracy & Governance Program awards a small number of scholarships each year to prospective students from the general applicant pool.

At the end of the two-year fellowship, Fellows enter the USAID Foreign Service. (Deadline is usually mid-October)\n\nNSEP David L.

Their reasons for doing so were several. They wished to “give back” to the country that had afforded them and their children such great opportunities and felt a fellowship program was an appropriate vehicle. They also felt that assisting young New Americans at critical points in their educations was an unmet need. Finally, they wished to call attention of all Americans to the extensive and diverse contributions of New Americans to the quality of life in this country (Deadlines are usually early November)."
