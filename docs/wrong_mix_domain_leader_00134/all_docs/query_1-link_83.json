Your request is being handled under the terms of the Freedom of\n\nInformation Act 2000 ('the Act').\n\nThe Act requires that a response must be given promptly, and in any event\n\nwithin 20 working days. We will therefore aim to reply at the latest by\n\n8th December.\n\nPlease remember to quote the reference number above in any future\n\ncommunications.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nFreedom of Information Team\n\nCabinet Office\n\nDear Prime Minister's Office,\n\nPlease pass this on to the person who conducts Freedom of Information reviews.\n\nI am writing to request an internal review of Prime Minister's Office's handling of my FOI request 'Exchange of letters between Harold Wilson and Levi Eshkol during the May-June 1967 crisis'.\n\nIn your response to my request, you told me that the correspondence between Harold Wilson and Levi Eshkol I had asked was not held by the Prime Minister's Office and that I should check The National Archives instead. However, I had already searched for that information at The National Archives before filing a FOIA request with the Prime Minister's Office, but had been unable to locate it. Yet I know that Messrs. Wilson and Eshkol exchanged letters during that period, since that correspondence is mentioned explicitly in the US archives (see my initial request for the exact reference), so it has to exist somewhere.\n\nA full history of my FOI request and all correspondence is available on the Internet at this address: https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/e...\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nPhilippe Lemoine\n\nDear Philippe Lemoine,\n\nThank you for your request for an internal review (reference\n\nIR2024/00471), which was prompted by our response to your request for\n\ninformation under the Freedom of Information Act 2000.\n\nWe shall endeavour to complete the internal review and respond to you\n\nwithin 20 working days.\n\nPlease remember to quote the reference number above in any future\n\ncommunications.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nFOI Team"
