        "text": "It was a matter of universal agreement during the years of Harold Wilson’s leadership of the Labour party that his private and political secretary, Marcia Williams, who has died aged 86, was the single most influential figure among his staff. She exerted an unrivalled degree of power throughout his four periods in office as prime minister and ran his office for 27 years, but became a source of conflict and division that clouded his years in Downing Street and ultimately diminished his political standing.\n\nThe principal cause of damage to his reputation proved to be Wilson’s resignation honours, which became infamous as the “lavender list”, so called because the original draft by Williams was on lavender-coloured notepaper. Roy Jenkins described the list as “at best, eccentric”, because among those rewarded with peerages and knighthoods were a number of adventurous businessmen who were close neither to Wilson nor to the Labour party and several of whom were later publicly disgraced. They included Lord Kagan, manufacturer of the Gannex raincoat favoured by Wilson, who had helped finance Williams’s political office and the first of two neighbouring houses she owned in a Marylebone mews; he was subsequently jailed for currency offences.\n\nAnother beneficiary was James Goldsmith, who received a knighthood even though he had financed the Conservative party in two recent elections. It was later disclosed that he had helped pay for the private education of Williams’s two sons. Another knighthood was awarded to Eric Miller, a wealthy Labour party financier, who bought the second mews house for Williams. He took his own life when on the point of being declared bankrupt and shortly before a critical Department of Trade and Industry report into his business dealings.\n\nDespite the ignominy heaped upon Wilson and, somewhat tragically, upon his political legacy as a consequence of this humiliating episode at the end of his long career, there was nevertheless no doubt among those who worked with him about the extraordinary debt he owed Williams for the loyalty and inspiration she had provided for him throughout his rise to the leadership of the Labour party. Roy Jenkins believed that she had the best judgment and the greatest courage among Wilson’s advisers in what was then known as the “kitchen cabinet”, and Richard Crossman noted in his diaries in 1967 that “Marcia … has got more influence with Harold now than any single man”.\n\nShe had a sharp political insight, was admired for her ability to transform the prime minister’s speeches with sheer brainpower, and was invaluable to Wilson because she understood the Labour party and recognised the importance of keeping him in line with the left wing.\n\nThat she was imperious, impulsive and unpredictable could often prove difficult for the smooth running of the government operation, but the flip-side advantage was that she could also use the same characteristics to assert her political will over the stubborn resistance of the civil service bureaucracy.\n\nShe was particularly feared in the Treasury. She always played an important part in any government reshuffle, often deciding the fate of individual cabinet ministers. Tony Benn, who both liked her and appreciated her strategic skills, confided to his diary with some approval in 1973 that Wilson was being “run” by her. “Fix it up with Marcia” was a watchword in Wilson’s office from his earliest years at Westminster.\n\nShe was born at Long Buckby in Northamptonshire, the daughter of Harry Field, a brickworks manager, and his wife, Dorothy. According to a story related to others by Wilson and believed by him but not otherwise authenticated, Dorothy, born in 1902, was an unacknowledged child of Edward VII, a prodigious womaniser during his many years as Prince of Wales who accepted no responsibility for any offspring. In Wilson’s account, an aide de camp named Falkender was obliged to claim fatherhood of Dorothy, whose assumed surname her daughter would later take as her title in the House of Lords.\n\nMarcia was a pupil at Northampton high school, where she became an enthusiastic Labour supporter, influenced in her political awakening by her French teacher, Janet Margesson, the daughter of the former Conservative minister Lord Margesson, who had succeeded Anthony Eden as secretary of state for war in Churchill’s war coalition government. She studied for an honours degree in history at Queen Mary College, London, topped it up with a secretarial course, and in 1955 took a job working for the then Labour party general secretary, Morgan Phillips, at Transport House. In the same year she married George Williams, known as Ed, an engineer.\n\nThe following year, shorthand pad at the ready, she encountered Wilson at a notorious dinner given by the Labour party for Nikita Khrushchev at which the Soviet leader had a shouting match with the future foreign secretary, George Brown. She claimed later that she and Wilson first met shortly afterwards, when he recognised her at a bus stop as a member of the party staff, and gave her a lift. It was then that he discovered she was the anonymous author of notes sent to him about the poor state of Labour’s organisation, when he was compiling a report into its “penny farthing” operation, warning him about political moves against him on the party executive.\n\nHe hired her to work in his private office in 1956 and swiftly imbued her with a huge degree of personal responsibility, which rapidly grew consistently with his career. They were both clever and ambitious, and he needed Williams to manage his relationship with the Labour party in the highly charged political atmosphere of the early 1960s, as he unsuccessfully challenged Hugh Gaitskell for the leadership in 1960 and then succeeded him in the contest that followed Gaitskell’s death in 1963. Once inside 10 Downing Street, Williams began empire-building, with an office immediately opposite the cabinet room and a growing staff and sense of her own authority.\n\nThere was always a certain sensitivity about their personal relationship in their early years working together. Marcia and Ed Williams’s marriage had not been a success, and he emigrated to the US, settling in Seattle in 1957. Marcia had a number of affairs while working for Wilson and one reason for sensitivity was the widespread rumour that he was among her lovers. An account published later by Wilson’s press secretary, Joe Haines, reported her claim to have had a brief affair with Wilson in 1956, something she apparently related unkindly and dismissively to his wife, Mary, in 1972, in a deliberate attempt to cause offence.\n\nLord Archer of Sandwell, who as Peter Archer served as solicitor general under Wilson from 1974, commented once: “I thought it was established years ago that this rumour wasn’t true. Apart from his first-class mind, Harold Wilson always struck me as an ordinary, dull chap who didn’t do the things us ordinary dull chaps don’t do.”\n\nWhatever the truth, Mary Wilson forgave Williams, to whom, in interviews in later years, she paid much credit. What is known is that when first challenging for the party leadership, Harold Wilson took particular care to avoid the difficult publicity that could have been caused by Ed Williams’s wish to divorce his wife and he secretly visited him in Seattle to urge discretion. The divorce was successfully kept from the press when it was granted in 1961.\n\nWilliams’s private life certainly helped fuel her intense fear and dislike of the press, but it was inevitable, given her growing power and status in Downing Street in the first two Wilson governments from 1964 to 1970, in opposition until 1974, and then with Wilson unexpectedly once again in office, that she should be subject to considerable public attention. It was thus remarkable that she conducted her longest affair with the political journalist Walter Terry, political editor successively of the Conservative-supporting Daily Express, Daily Mail and Sun, and with whom she had two sons, in 1968 and 1969, without a whiff reaching the press for many years of what would have been a considerable, even government-threatening scandal. Labour ministers at the time did report with surprise that if they called on the prime minister at No 10 in the late evening “the drinks always seem to be served by Walter Terry”, but even after the Profumo affair, as a new era of press reporting was developing, the secret somehow held.\n\nThe prime minister shared Williams’s constant anxiety about the press, and in retrospect it is possible to see that they both recognised a profound insecurity in the other, which their professional relationship constantly mirrored. She resorted to the law on a number of occasions to silence claims made against her when in government and in 2006, when she successfully sued the BBC for libel in The Lavender List, a drama to mark the 30th anniversary of Wilson’s resignation. She was awarded £75,000 and £200,000 in costs, and the BBC undertook never to repeat the programme.\n\nAs recorded in depth in memoirs and diaries by both Haines and Wilson’s policy adviser, Lord (Bernard) Donoughue, life in Downing Street became increasingly difficult because of Williams’s mercurial nature. She became dominating and wilful, and both men record the extent to which her problems absorbed the prime minister.\n\nThere were endless rows, often involving other members of staff, and a culture of fear developed in which Williams would storm into rooms, shout at people and accuse them of treachery. Haines wrote that she spoke to the prime minister in “terms that would make a slavemaster blush”. Donoughue recorded: “I get the feeling that everything he does in politics is to please her. He does not care about the people, the party or himself. She is the daughter who he delights in, however outrageous, and who he is working to please. It is amazing to watch. His patience with her is endless.”\n\nThat patience was tested particularly in early 1974 when it was discovered during the first election campaign of that year that Williams, her sister, Peggy, and brother, Tony, both of whom had worked in No 10, were partners in the ownership of some slag heaps in Lancashire which the Guardian revealed had been bought and sold, at considerable profit to the Field family, with planning permission for development. A fraudster, Ronald Milhench, involved in the development had forged a letter purporting to be signed by Wilson on House of Commons writing paper. Milhench was exposed and jailed for three years, but the prime minister surprised political observers with the vehemence of his defence of the Fields, and he was jeered in the Commons.\n\nThe outcome was a demand from Williams, who was appointed CBE in 1970, that Wilson elevate her to the House of Lords. He acceded to this in 1974, amid much derision from the press and the Labour party. Private Eye dubbed her “Lady Forkbender”. She remained Wilson’s political secretary after his retirement in 1976 (she unsuccessfully attempted to postpone this) and continued in the role until 1983.\n\nExtraordinarily, in 1979 she began working secretly with the late Sir Gordon Reece and the late Lord McAlpine, two close advisers of Margaret Thatcher, to help the Conservative leader win office. Charles Moore revealed in the first volume of his biography of Thatcher that Falkender attended discreet meetings with them and an aide of the Tory chairman, Lord Thorneycroft, at the flat of the Conservative businessman James Hanson, who was initially knighted in Wilson’s lavender list retirement honours and was later created a peer in 1983 by Thatcher. Moore wrote: “ The purpose of the meetings was for Lady Falkender to convey to the Tory campaigners her assessment of what the Labour party was thinking.”\n\nShe took up a number of business appointments thereafter, including serving on several film industry committees. She attended the House of Lords regularly, but never made a speech, apparently due to a paralysing fear of speaking in public. She attracted further undesirable press attention for an expenses claim for £128,000 to cover the cost of taxis to Westminster for five years from 2006-11. Figures prior to 2006 were not available.\n\nFalkender published two books, Inside Number 10 (1972) and Downing Street in Perspective (1983). She suffered a stroke in 1998 and was in poor health for her last years.\n\nShe is survived by her sons, Tim and Dan."
