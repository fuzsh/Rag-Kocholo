        "text": "No. 10 Downing Street has housed many famous and illustrious people over the years. Two of the most iconic British Prime Ministers to call it home were Winston Churchill and Harold Wilson, who both served more than one term here.\n\nChurchill was elected as Conservative MP for Oldham in 1900, before defecting to the Liberal Party in 1904 and spending the next decade climbing the ranks of the Liberal government. Read his biography here\n\nChurchill's warnings against the Appeasement of Nazi Germany were proven correct when the Second World War broke out in 1939. Following Neville Chamberlain’s resignation in May 1940, Churchill succeeded him as Prime Minister.\n\nSome of his most memorable speeches were given during his time as Prime Minister, and are credited with stimulating British morale during periods of great hardship.\n\nChurchill, who also adopted the self-created position of Minister for Defence during the war, was central in leading the British war effort.\n\nLabour's Clement Attlee won a surprise general election victory in 1945 which saw Churchill out of office. However, Churchill would return to No. 10 in 1951, serving another four years as Prime Minister.\n\nHarold Wilson, the son of a chemist and teacher, was born in Yorkshire during the First World War. In 1924, aged 8, he visited 10 Downing Street, which would eventually become his home. Read his biography here\n\nHe entered Parliament in 1945 as MP for Ormskirk and later becoming MP for Huyton. Aged 31, he had become the youngest member of the Cabinet in the 20th century.\n\nAfter Hugh Gaitskell passed away suddenly in 1963, Wilson fought and won a leadership contest against George Brown and James Callaghan. As Labour leader, he won 4 of the 5 General Elections he contested.\n\nOn 16 March 1976, 5 days after his 60th birthday, he stunned the nation when he announced his intention to resign, a decision that he claimed he had made 2 years previously."
