        "text": "American science fiction writer\n\nDayton Ward (born June 7, 1967) is an American science fiction author primarily known for his Star Trek novels and short stories, which began with publication in the Strange New Worlds anthology series. He published stories in each of the first three Strange New Worlds volumes,[1] making him the first author to render himself ineligible under the rules of that series. As such, future authors who achieved the same feat were said to have earned a \"Wardy\".\n\nIn addition, he has written numerous articles in Star Trek Communicator and Star Trek Magazine. He has also published a number of short stories in various magazines and collections. His frequent collaborator on these and other works is fellow author Kevin Dilmore.\n\nWard has been nominated six times for, and has won twice, the Scribe Award from the International Association of Media Tie-In Writers. The winning entries were Star Trek: The Next Generation: Armageddon's Arrow, in 2016,[2] and Star Trek: Discovery: Drastic Measures, in 2019.[3]\n\nWard was born and raised in Tampa, Florida. After graduating high school, Ward enlisted in the United States Marine Corps, where he worked in information systems. He was eventually stationed in Kansas City, Missouri.[1] He served for more than eleven years, before being honorably discharged. He remained in and lives with his family in Kansas City. Ward worked as a software developer and part time writer before becoming a full time writer. He also consults for CBS on Star Trek licensee projects, including publications from Simon & Schuster and IDW Publishing.[1]"
