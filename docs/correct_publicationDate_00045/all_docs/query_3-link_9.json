        "text": "The Summoning Charm (Accio) was a charm that summoned an object toward the caster.[2] It was able to summon objects in direct line of sight of the caster, as well as things out of view, by calling the object aloud after the incantation[2] (unless the spell was cast nonverbally).\n\nThis spell needed thought behind it, and the object had to be clear in the caster's mind before trying to summon it.[2] The opposite charm of the Summoning Charm was the Banishing Charm.[3]\n\nHistory[]\n\nThe Summoning Charm was one of the oldest known to wizarding society.[4] This spell's most famous use was, according to Miranda Goshawk, by the Accionites and their leader, Gideon Flatworthy.[4]\n\nIn the traditional wizarding tale \"The Wizard and the Hopping Pot\" from The Tales of Beedle the Bard, the son of the titular pot's original owner summoned a lost donkey belonging to one of his fellow villagers.[5]\n\nThis charm was taught to fourth-years at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in Charms class[6][7] and was revised again in a student's fifth in preparation for O.W.L.s.[8] In the 1890–1891 school year, Professor Abraham Ronen had his fifth-years review the charm before they used it in a game of Summoner's Court.[9] This spell was located in The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 4 by Miranda Goshawk.[10]\n\nDuring the Calamity in the 2010s, a Calamity Investigator working for the task force used a combination of this spell and the Slowing Charm to harvest hair from even the swiftest Granian winged horses. The investigator found that the hair from extremely swift Granians was even more potent, reducing the brewing time for their Exstimulo Potion.[11]\n\nCasting and effects[]\n\nThe Summoning Charm could not be used on buildings.[4] In addition, it would not work on living things, although they might be moved indirectly by summoning things they were wearing or holding.[12][13] It was risky to summon them in this manner, because they travelled at close to the speed of light and might be injured in the process.[12][14] The only known exception to this rule were Flobberworms, which were generally not considered worth summoning.[4]\n\nThe further the desired object was from the caster, the harder it was to summon. Hermione Granger, however, stated that it did not matter how far away the object was — so long as the caster had it clearly in mind, they should be able to summon it with ease.[2] In addition, the object's general location must be known, otherwise it couldn't be summoned.[15]\n\nThere existed counter-spells that could be placed on objects to keep them from being summoned.[16][17] Most wizarding goods sold as of the 20th century and early 21st century came pre-enchanted with an anti-theft charm to keep them from being summoned by anyone but their rightful owners.[4]\n\nHorcruxes also could not be summoned in any way possible due to the high levels of protections that have been placed on them, as seen when nothing happened when Hermione tried to summon Slytherin's Locket, Hufflepuff's Cup, and Ravenclaw's Diadem.\n\nKnown uses[]\n\nSuccessful[]\n\nCaster(s) Dates Notes Modesty Rabnott 1269 Summoned a Golden Snidget to herself in a Quidditch game, in order to rescue it from harm.[18] Eleazar Fig 1 September 1890 Used it wandlessly to pull the Vault 12 key to him as quickly as possible.[19] Used it on a Guardian in Vault 12 of Gringotts Wizarding Bank.[19] Abraham Ronen 2 September 1890 Used it during Charms class to summon a textbook from his student.[9] 1890–1891 school year Used it during at least one match of Summoner's Court.[20] Unidentified 19th-century Hogwarts student 2 September 1890 Used it during Charms class.[9] 1890–1891 school year Used it to summon two Wizard's Field Guide pages to complete Professor Ronen's assignment.[21] Used it during at least five matches of Summoner's Court.[22][23][24][25][20] Used it to collect Cressida Blume's books in the Hogwarts Library.[26] Used it to collect Zenobia Noke's Gobstones from high places around Hogwarts Castle.[27] Natsai Onai 2 September 1890 Used it during Charms class.[9] Dinah Hecat Used it nonverbally to summon a training dummy during her Defence Against the Dark Arts class.[28] Gerbold Ollivander Used it nonverbally to summon a wand from a top shelf for the new fifth-year student.[29] Mirabel Garlick 1890–1891 school year Used it to summon a pot of Mandrake during Herbology class.[30] Leander Prewett Used it during at least one match of Summoner's Court.[22] Samantha Dale Used it during at least one match of Summoner's Court.[23] Grace Pinch-Smedley Used it during at least one match of Summoner's Court.[24] Charlotte Morrison Used it during at least one match of Summoner's Court.[25] Matilda Weasley 1891 Used it to summon the Wizard's Field Guide from her student's hands to review it[31] Newton Scamander 6 December 1926 Used it nonverbally to summon an Occamy egg held in Jacob Kowalski's hand, which also caused Jacob to be summoned along with it.[32]\n\nUsed it to summon jewellery stolen by his Niffler from inside its pouch to pull it towards him.[32]\n\nSeptember 1927 Used it to summon his Niffler.[32] Used it to summon his suitcase from the ground while riding a Zouwu.[33]\n\nGellert Grindelwald (disguised as Percival Graves) 6 December 1926 Used it nonverbally and wandlessly to summon Newt Scamander's suitcase in the MACUSA Headquarters.[32] Porpentina Goldstein 7 December 1926 Used it to summon Percival Graves's wand, shortly before he was revealed to be Gellert Grindelwald in disguise.[32] Leta Lestrange September 1927 Used it to summon the Lestrange family tree in the Lestrange Mausoleum.[33] Filius Flitwick June 1976 Used it to summon over a hundred rolls of parchment during an O.W.L.s exam, and in cause the parchments knocked him backwards off his feet.[34] Wilfred Levi Kidd 1989–1990 school year Used it to summon a glass of Butterbeer from Madam Rosmerta's tray, but the glass flied so fast that it was shattered when it hit the wall.[35] Verucca Buckthorn-Snyde 22 June 1991 Used it to wandlessly summon her wand at the Viaduct after being disarmed of it.[36] Molly Weasley August 1994 Used it several to summon many different magical sweets Fred and George Weasley were trying to sneak out of the house to the 422nd Quidditch World Cup.[37] Minerva McGonagall 2 September 1994 Used it nonverbally to summon the books she had dropped back into her arms. She had dropped the books in shock after seeing Alastor Moody transfigure Draco Malfoy into a ferret.[38] Hermione Granger 23–24 November 1994 Used it to teach the charm to Harry Potter, who later used it in the First Task of the Triwizard Tournament.[2] 18 June 1996 Used it during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries to summon Harry's wand to him.[39] July 1997 Used it to summon books about Horcruxes from the Headmaster's office; it flew through an opened window.[40] Harry Potter 24 November 1994 Used it to summon books, feathers, chairs, Gobstones and Trevor in the Gryffindor common room in order to use this spell in the first task of the Triwizard Tournament.[2] Used it to summon his broom to outmanoeuvre the Hungarian Horntail during the First Task of the Triwizard Tournament.[2]\n\n24 June 1995 Used it to summon the Triwizard Cup, which had been made a Portkey, in order to escape Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters from the Little Hangleton graveyard, carrying Cedric Diggory's corpse.[41] 8 October 1995 Used it to summon his toad with which he was practising his Silencing Charm in Charms class.[42] 30 June 1997 Used it to summon Madam Rosmerta's brooms to himself and Albus Dumbledore to get back to Hogwarts.[43] 31 July 1997 Used it to summon his glasses on his 17th birthday.[44] 2 September 1997 Used it to summon Dittany from Hermione Granger's handbag.[45] Bartemius Crouch Jnr (disguised as Alastor Moody) February 1995 Used it to summon the Marauder's Map away from Severus Snape before he could read it.[46] Sirius Black 18 December 1995 Used it to summon the half a dozen bottles of Butterbeer at 12 Grimmauld Place for himself, Harry Potter and Weasleys.[47] Ron Weasley 18 June 1996 Used it in the Brain Room during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries to summon a brain in a tank to himself while under the effects of a spell.[39] Severus Snape March 1997 Used it nonverbally to summon the 25 essays on countering Dementors from his students in Defence Against the Dark Arts class.[48] George Weasley May 1996 Used it to summon his broom from Umbridge's office when escaping from Hogwarts in his seventh year.[49] Fred Weasley August 1997 Used it to summon hairs from a red-haired Muggle boy in Ottery St Catchpole in order to help Harry disguise himself during the wedding using Polyjuice Potion.[50] Dirk Cresswell October 1997 Used it to summon salmon to eat.[15] Lord Voldemort 2 May 1998 Used it nonverbally to summon the Sorting Hat from the Headmaster's office; it flew through a shattered window.[51] Fischer Frey 2008–2009 school year Used it nonverbally to summon Kevin Farrell's copy of the Daily Prophet.[52] Unidentified Muggle-born Hogwarts student 2009–2010 school year Used it to summon Robyn Thistlethwaite's Auto-Answer Quill.[52] Elspeth MacGillony 2010–2011 school year Used it to summon the chest that held the crown of courage.[52] Daniel Page Used it to summon Victor Gridley's desk as a means of bringing down Gridley himself to the dungeon of his caravan.[52] Used it to summon Gridley's wand.[52] Calamity Investigator in the Statute of Secrecy Task Force Late 2010s or early 2020s Used this charm in combination with the Slowing Charm to slow down Granian winged horses for long enough to collect their Granian hair.[11]\n\nUnsuccessful[]\n\nCaster(s) Dates Notes Harry Potter 23 November 1994 Used it to summon books and feathers in preparation for the first task of the Triwizard Tournament, but unsuccessfully.[2] 1 September 1996 Used it nonverbally and wandlessly to summon his wand after Draco Malfoy hit him with a Full Body-Bind Curse, but unsuccessfully.[53] 30 June 1997 Used it to summon Salazar Slytherin's fake locket in the Crystal Cave, but unsuccessfully.[54] 27 July 1997 Used it to summon Hedwig and Rubeus Hagrid during the Battle of the Seven Potters, but unsuccessfully.[55] 2 September 1997 Used it to summon the Salazar Slytherin's Locket in the Dolores Umbridge's office during the infiltration, but unsuccessfully.[56] 24 December 1997 Used it wandlessly to summon his wand after it had been knocked out of his hand during his fight with Nagini in Bathilda Bagshot's home at Godric's Hollow, but unsuccessfully.[57] 28 December 1997 Used it to summon the Sword of Gryffindor from the frozen pool in the Forest of Dean, but unsuccessfully.[58] Antonin Dolohov 18 June 1996 Used it to summon the prophecy about Harry and Voldemort in the Death Chamber during the battle in the Department of Mysteries, but unsuccessfully, because he was pushed by Sirius Black.[39] Bellatrix Lestrange Used it to summon the prophecy about Harry and Voldemort in the Hall of Prophecy during the battle in the Department of Mysteries, but unsuccessfully, because Harry cast the Shield Charm.[39] Used it to summon the prophecy about Harry and Voldemort in the Atrium during the battle in the Department of Mysteries, but unsuccessfully, because it was already smashed.[59] Hermione Granger 2 August 1997 Used it to summon Salazar Slytherin's Locket in Regulus Black's bedroom at 12 Grimmauld Place, but unsuccessfully.[16] 1 May 1998 Used it to summon Helga Hufflepuff's Cup in the Lestrange Vault at Gringotts Wizarding Bank during the break-in, but unsuccessfully, because the protections on the Horcruxes made this impossible.[17]\n\nKnown practitioners[]\n\nModesty Rabnott[18]\n\nWizard (fictional)[5]\n\nUnidentified Muggle-born Hogwarts student[52]\n\nCalamity Investigator in the Statute of Secrecy Task Force[11]\n\nEtymology[]\n\nThe Latin word accio can mean \"I call\", \"I summon\", or \"action\". In the Hungarian translation, the spell is called \"Invito\", possibly from the word \"to invite\".\n\nBehind the scenes[]\n\nIn the 2006 short film The Queen's Handbag, Harry Potter and Ron Weasley both use the charm in an attempt to retrieve Queen Elizabeth II's handbag, which has been lost. They are unsuccessful and Hermione suggests they're too far away from it, suggesting the charm may have a maximum range. However, in Goblet of Fire, Hermione stated that distance didn't matter, as long as the caster was concentrating hard enough. Also, the short film's canonicity is uncertain, so it is unlikely this applies to mainstream continuity.\n\nIn canon, various pronunciations for the incantation of this spell are heard, including:\n\n(AK-ee-oh) or (AK-see-oh) from the films.\n\n(AK-see-oh) from the UK audiobook performed by Stephen Fry and video game.\n\n(AS-see-oh) from the US audiobook performed by Jim Dale.\n\nSuggested pronunciation includes (AT-chee-oh), the Anglo-Catholic pronunciation, whereas the original Latin translation sounds like (AK-ee-oh).[citation needed]\n\nIn the console and PC versions of LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4, it can be bought at Wiseacre's Wizarding Equipment in Diagon Alley.\n\nIn the handheld versions of LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4, Accio can move an object in any direction, not just towards the caster. In some cases, it moves an object directly away from the caster, working more like its opposite.\n\nWhen Hermione Summoned Secrets of the Darkest Art from Dumbledore's office, she simply said \"Accio Horcrux books\", instead of the specific book name, meaning that this spell can function even when the item's description is not detailed.\n\nAccording to Wonderbook: Book of Spells, the hand motion is this:\n\nGiven that the Summoning Charm will not work on most living objects, the Summoning of the donkey in \"The Wizard and the Hopping Pot\" may have been one of the uses of poetic licence on the part of Beedle the Bard.\n\nDespite not being able to summon most living objects, Gideon Flatworthy managed to summon livestock along with a farm and well-stocked larder, all of which crushed him to death.\n\nIn Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, Teddy was pulled through the air due to this spell pulling on all the jewellery inside the Niffler's pouch, causing the jewels to fly out towards Newt along with the Niffler. What seemed to be this spell was used to summon Jacob Kowalski though the air in a hazy wind by Newt using the spell to summon the Occamy egg Jacob was holding. It may have again been, used by Grindelwald, under the guise of Percival Graves, to wandlessly summon Newton Scamander's suitcase and wand, causing the former to fly next to him and the latter to fly to his hand.\n\nAccio is Tom Felton's favourite spell.[65]\n\nThe summoning of a Golden Snidget by Modesty Rabnott in the book Quidditch Through the Ages as well as Newton Scamander's use of the charm to summon a Niffler in the film Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald seemingly clashes with the rule that living creatures supposedly can't be summoned. Ted Tonks also summons salmon in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, though it is not entirely clear if the salmon was alive at the time.\n\nHarry Potter uses this charm to summon toads on two occasions; firstly to summon Neville Longbottom's toad, Trevor, when practising the charm in preparation for the Triwizard Tournament, and secondly in his fifth year to retrieve the toad on which he was practising his silencing charm. A possible explanation is that the Summoning Charm can be used on some living creatures, but they must be in direct line of sight and/or only a short distance away.\n\nAlbus Dumbledore may have used the Summoning Charm during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries to stop a Death Eater from escaping, as his spell is described as having \"pulled him back as easily and effortlessly as though he had hooked him with an invisible line\" which matches the effects of this charm as previously described.\n\nIn Hogwarts Legacy, the mechanics of this charm, in both gameplay and story, work similarly to those of the Seize and pull charm, by sending out a string of light that wraps around the target and pulls it towards the caster, or pulls the caster towards a target, as well as being capable of releasing the object before it reaches the caster.[citation needed]\n\nAppearances[]\n\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (First appearance)\n\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)\n\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (video game)\n\nHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\n\nHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (video game)\n\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\n\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game)\n\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\n\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1\n\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2\n\nFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them: The Original Screenplay\n\nFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (film)\n\nFantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald - The Original Screenplay\n\nFantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald\n\nFantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore - The Complete Screenplay\n\nFantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore\n\nQuidditch Through the Ages\n\nThe Tales of Beedle the Bard\n\nThe Queen's Handbag\n\nLEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4\n\nHarry Potter Trading Card Game\n\nWonderbook: Book of Spells\n\nHarry Potter for Kinect\n\nPottermore\n\nWizarding World\n\nThe Wizarding World of Harry Potter\n\nHarry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery\n\nHarry Potter: Wizards Unite\n\nHarry Potter: Puzzles & Spells\n\nHarry Potter: Magic Awakened\n\nHogwarts Legacy\n\n[]\n\nAccio at the Hogwarts Legacy Wiki\n\nNotes and references[]\n\nCharms (class) Charm-book writers and developers Blagdon Blay · Daisy Pennifold · Delfina Crimp · Miranda Goshawk · Jarleth Hobart · Basil Horton · Helixa Hyslop · Syna Hyslop · Randolph Keitch · Levina Monkstanley · Orabella Nuttley · Mnemone Radford · Scarpin · Elliot Smethwyck · Felix Summerbee · Violeta Stitch Professors Fortinbras · Filius Flitwick · Abraham Ronen · Unidentified male professor · Unidentified medieval professor Textbooks Achievements in Charming · Extreme Incantations · Quintessence: A Quest · The Standard Book of Spells Charms studied at Hogwarts Anti-Alohomora Charm · Ascension Charm (Ascendio) · Banishing Charm (Depulso) · Blackboard Writing Spell · Blue sparks · Bombardment Spell (Bombarda) · Box Blasting Charm (Cistem Aperio) · Bubble-Head Charm · Cheering Charm · Cleaning Charm · Colour Change Charm (Colovaria) · Confundus Charm (Confundo) · Counter-charm for hiccoughs · Dancing Feet Spell (Tarantallegra) · Descendo · Disarming Charm (Expelliarmus) · Disillusionment Charm · Drought Charm · Entrancing Enchantments (theoretically) · Eradication Spell (Deletrius) · Engorgement Charm (Engorgio) · Extinguishing Spell · Fire-Making Spell (Incendio) · Freezing Charm (Immobulus) · Freezing Spell (Glacius) · Full Body-Bind Curse (Petrificus Totalus) · General Counter-Spell (Finite Incantatem) · Gouging Spell (Defodio) · Growth Charm · Ice Jinx · Impervius Charm (Impervius) · Knitting Charm · Knockback Jinx (Flipendo) · Leg-Locker Curse (Locomotor Mortis) · Levitation Charm (Wingardium Leviosa) · Locking Spell (Colloportus) · Locomotion Charm (Locomotor) · Lumos Solem Spell (Lumos Solem) · Mending Charm (Reparo) · Memory Charm (Obliviate) · Muffliato Charm (Muffliato) · Nonverbal spells · Pack Charm (Pack) · Red Sparks (Vermillious) · Reductor Curse (Reducto) · Scouring Charm (Scourgify) · Seize and pull charm (Carpe Retractum) · Severing Charm (Diffindo) · Shrinking Charm (Reducio) · Silencing Charm (Silencio) · Slowing Charm (Arresto Momentum) · Skurge Charm (Skurge) · Softening Charm (Spongify) · Spell for growing legs · Substantive Charm · Summoning Charm (Accio) · Tickling Charm (Rictusempra) · Unlocking Charm (Alohomora) · Vinegar to wine spell · Wand-Extinguishing Charm (Nox) · Wand-Lighting Charm (Lumos) · Lumos Maxima · Water-Making Spell (Aguamenti)"
