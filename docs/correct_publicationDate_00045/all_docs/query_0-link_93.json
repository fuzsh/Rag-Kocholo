        "text": "Open Secrets is the fourth instalment of the compelling new Vanguard series, which returns to the original Star Trek era, but with an entirely new perspective. These novels run parallel to Captain Kirk's original five-year misson, but feature all-original characters who uncover the hidden secrets and flesh-out the complex relationships between the allies and enemies first featured in the original Star Trek series. Open Secrets begins on a space station in the vast and remote region of space known as Taurus Reach. A new commander has taken control of Starbase 47 while his predecessor stands trial for treason. Meanwhile, the station's intelligence officer fights for her life and her very mind, while the ever-present tension with the Klingons escalates into all-out war. Building upon the drama of its Vanguard predecessors, Reap the Whirlwind, Summon the Thunder and Harbinger, Open Secrets uncovers new truths and features all-new characters to offer a completely new take on the classic Star Trek era.\n\nKevin Dilmore has been a contributor to Star Trek Communicator magazine since 1997.
