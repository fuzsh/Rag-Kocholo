Video premiere: The Royal Oui, ‘Usually I Would’

Like persistent rays of sunshine busting through cracks in ominous clouds, “This Is Someday,” the second album from Vancouver duo the Royal Oui, injects a little sophisticated, earnest optimism on a seemingly dour world. Released last month via Vancouver label File Under: Music, it’s the latest batch of smart pop from the husband-and-wife team of Adrienne Pierce and Ari Shine, each of whom accumulated notable solo releases before they got together.

The video for the upbeat single “Usually I Would” is exemplary — it follows a day in the life of Vancouver drag queen Thanks Jem, from prep to rehearsal to performance. Directed by Jem’s real-life partner Matt Leaf, it’s got good vibes to spare. Which is just what the songwriters had in mind. “‘Usually I Would’ is the heart of ‘This is Someday,’” Pierce says. “It’s a reminder that you don’t have to wait for someone else to give you permission to be who you already are.”
