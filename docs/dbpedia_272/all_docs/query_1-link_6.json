        "text": "Vancouver husband and wife duo Ari Shine and Adrienne Pierce have created 11 glorious tracks of baroque pop-infused goodness that blend acoustic guitars with rainstorms and haunting boy-girl harmonies, all while making it seem new and natural. “True” is a delicate ‘90s number that could play over the end credits to Reality Bites 2, while opener “Sirensong” gets diverse and cohesive all at once. With mostly gentle, walk-in-the-rain-while-you-pine inflection, each singer never leaves the other hanging, though at times Pierce’s vocals pop a little more, as on “Montauk (This is the End)”. “Heart Safe” and “The Real Thing” are equal parts precious and sincere, poppy and petite, while “I’ll Meet You” is pensive and powerful. Definitely for fans of Belle and Sebastian that are keen to fall in love all over again.\n\nPublished in Volume 68, Number 21 of The Uniter (February 19, 2014)"
