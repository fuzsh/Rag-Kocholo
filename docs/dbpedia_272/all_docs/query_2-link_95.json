        "text": "From all desserts made in this home over the past many, many years, I think clafoutis definitely ranks number one when it comes to made most often. It definitely wins when it comes to easiest and quickest one, that is if you cheat a bit and use a jar of sour cherries. Personally, it ranks absolute top on comfort food too!\n\nTraditionally made with cherries but you can use apples or, one of my personal favourites, the green reine claude plums…you get the idea: just use what’s in season! But let’s get back to the real thing! As the name gives away, we are talking a French dessert, mais oui, finding its origin in the Limousin region where local griottes, sour cherries, are used. The name is said to come from the Occitan dialect word ‘claufir’, which means to cover or fill. you can find many recipes on the internet or in culinary magazines or books, some use butter, some don’t, this is how I make it…The combination of fresh juicy fruit and the sweet batter will transport you to dessert heaven, promised, so head towards your kitchen!\n\nWhat you need:\n\n1 round baking dish and a little butter or oil to grease\n\n4 large eggs\n\n4 tbsp of flour\n\n100 gr sugar + extra 2 tbsp for baking dish\n\n185 ml cream\n\n125 ml milk\n\n+/- 400 gr cherries\n\nI usually add a little Kirsch too\n\nOptional: a few drops of almond essence, two or three, just to give a hint, you don’t really need to flavour\n\nWhat to do:\n\nPreheat the oven to 180° C.\n\nGrease a baking dish large enough to hold the cherries in one layer, add two tbsp of sugar. Spin the dish round to coat the inside with the sugar, remove any excess if any, then set aside.\n\nMix the dry ingredients, then add the milk and cream and next add the eggs.\n\nLayer the cherries in your baking dish. If you use a jar, let them go through a sieve first, but catch the liquid, you can use this for a nice gelato sauce or to accompany your clafoutis.\n\nPour the liquid (not to worry, it’s a very liquid batter) over the cherries and place in the oven for 30-35 minutes until golden and puffy.\n\nDust with icing sugar and serve lukewarm or lightly chilled depending on your own preference.\n\nBon appétit, mes amis!\n\nIngrid\n\nxxx"
