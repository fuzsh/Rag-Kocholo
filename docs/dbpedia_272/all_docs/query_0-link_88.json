        "text": "Since its premiere in 2016, Netflix’s “The Crown” has followed the reign of Queen Elizabeth II, blending fact and fiction as each season inches closer to the present day. Last year, after complaints about the show’s historical inaccuracies, Netflix added a disclaimer that “The Crown” is a “fictional dramatization.”\n\nThe show’s sixth and final season, the first four episodes of which arrived on Thursday, opens in 1997, eight weeks before the death of Diana, Princess of Wales (Elizabeth Debicki), in a car crash in Paris, along with her boyfriend, the Egyptian film producer Emad Mohamed al-Fayed, known as Dodi (Khalid Abdalla). (The driver, Henri Paul, was also killed.)\n\nThe accident, as the couple was pursued by paparazzi, shocked the world, and 30 million people in the United States alone watched the funeral of “the people’s princess” on television.\n\nBut the public wasn’t privy to the private conversations between Diana and the people close to her in the weeks leading up to her death, which “The Crown” imagines. In the first four episodes — the final six will land on Dec. 14 — Diana is navigating co-parenting with her ex-husband, Charles, uncertain about her future and her relationship with Dodi as the press follows the couple’s every move.\n\nSo how accurate is the show’s depiction of the period leading up to the accident, and the subsequent fallout?\n\nHere is a look at how The Times and other news outlets reported on this period at the time. You can find more in the TimesMachine archive browser. (Warning: This feature contains spoilers for Season 6 of “The Crown.”)\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
