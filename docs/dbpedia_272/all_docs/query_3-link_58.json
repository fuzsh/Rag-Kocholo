        "text": "Q& A with Miss Rodeo North Carolina\n\nHello, we are listening to Oui Talk Raw on rBeatz Radio. I’m your host, Chelsea Walsh, and today I have a special guest named Izzy Rockwell. Now Izzy is quite famous here in North Carolina, anywhere in the world actually. She is Miss Rodeo North Carolina. Izzy, welcome.\n\nHi, thank you so much for having me today. I’m so excited to be here. Thank you.\n\nI’m so glad that you are here, it’s so exciting.\n\nYes.\n\nIzzy, why don’t you kind of talk about how you got into Rodeo -ing? Rodeo -ing, that’s a hard one.\n\nIt’s okay, some people mistake it for radio sometimes. So it’s okay.\n\nThere you go, there you go.\n\nSo growing up, I was originally born in Florida. We quickly moved to Upstate New York, where my dad’s side of the family is from. When we were up there, they have a lot of agriculture, and they had a rodeo called the Double M Western Rodeo. And I used to watch it, and I used to watch the sparkly rodeo queens come out with their big wings and their chaps, and they would come out carrying flags, and I was like, I wanna do that when I grow up.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo when we moved down to North Carolina, when I was about five, my parents put me in horseback riding lessons because I begged them too. to. And shortly after that, I started showing in the English world, which if you watch the Olympics, it’s all like the hunter jumpers and dressage and fun stuff like that, I did the jumpers. So it was a totally different world. It wasn’t until later on when I got my first barrel horse, I actually started rodeoing. And I was like, man, I really want to be a rodeo queen. I want to be involved. And they were like, hey, you know, we have a miss division, which is my age range in North America, in North Carolina. So that’s when I looked into it. And from there, here we are.\n\nSo, so intriguing. Now, I caught you saying something when you got a barrel horse…\n\nYes.\n\nI didn’t know that there was a difference in the kind of horses.\n\nSo not only with breeds, but there’s also different disciplines horses can do. So different breeds can cross different disciplines. So for example, we have a quarter horse that not only does Western riding, but they do English. And when I say Western versus English, it’s just two different saddles. The style’s a little bit different based on the background of their history. But other than that, horses can do different things and they have different skills, kind of just like people do. They have different skills for jobs. Some may be athletic, some may be ready to model. Yeah, we have model horses too, so you never know.\n\nYou have four horses. horses, I believe, correct?\n\nI do, yes.\n\nSo what are they? What kinds of, like, what do you use them for? What are their names?\n\nSo I have Newcastle, Benjamin, Junior, and Batman. So that is an order from oldest to youngest. Newcastle is an Irish sport horse. He’s gonna be 28 this year. He’s my old man, but we can’t call him old. He’ll get mad.\n\nYes.\n\nIf my mom’s listening, she’ll be like, “Call him vintage.” But he, did the jumpers with me for a long time and he also did fox hunting. So I don’t know if you’ve seen the old pictures, if you go to like a vintage store that has the guys in the red coats with like following the hounds.\n\nYes, yes.\n\nSo that’s what we do. We don’t actually hurt any of the prey or anything like that, but we follow the hounds and we follow scent trails for fox hunting. So he did all of that. He was actually born in Ireland and imported here when he was about four years old. So he’s a true Irishman and then I have Benjamin and Junior and they are both what I call my all -around rodeo horses. So they do barrels, poles, I’ve set them on cattle, I can rope… really poorly.\n\nMaybe not, you’d be better roper than me.\n\nMy hand-eye off the horse is maybe not the best. Definitely can’t play polo either. But so I have those two and then Batman is actually a mini pony. So he is about the size of a Great Dane. He weighs about 250 pounds, and he is currently in training to drive a cart behind him. So ponies can actually pull about three times as much as they can carry. So he can pull like, you know, two normal size adult humans, and–\n\nOh, so is he gonna like, what’s his purpose gonna be, Batman? Like, is he just gonna be like, hey, hop on, guys, let’s go.”\n\nYeah, pretty much. So you could show the mini ponies. There’s not a whole lot of mini showing around here, but I would really just use him for fun. Just go on a little eat\n\nand go down the road in your little cart and have fun. He’s also a big cuddle bug, so.\n\nI love that.\n\nIt’s nice to just kinda have pony snuggles.\n\nI love that. So you started at a young age, right? You saw Miss, or no, Queen, what was it?\n\nShe’s one of the queens at the Double S Rodeo.\n\nOkay, yeah, yeah.\n\nThey always had, I think it was actually the owner’s daughter who used to come out, and she would carry flags, but they would come out and have these big, beautiful, like red, white, and blue chaps, and this sparkle everywhere. And it was just like, it always made me tear up, and it still does to this day, just like kind of thinking about it.\n\nRight, right.\n\nIt definitely sparked the interest for me right away.\n\nIs that your aspiration someday to become the queen?\n\nI mean, I am the queen.\n\nYou are, you are, you are, you are Miss Rodeo. But isn’t there a difference between like, ’cause of your age division?\n\nSo our age divisions, we have sweetheart, princess, junior, teen, and miss. So miss is the highest, so I’m there, I did it. Now, I do get –\n\nHow did you get here though? (laughing) Because when I spoke with you earlier on, I think this is a huge life lesson in the story and quite frankly, I think it’s the hook of this entire interview. Tell me a little bit, how did you get to your title today? It wasn’t like number one right away.\n\nIt wasn’t like, hey, here we go.\n\nYeah.\n\nNo, so I started looking into the missed division, I think around 2019, 2020, which obviously 2020, we won’t mention what year that was, but it was rough. And from 2020 to 2021, we actually had, that was the first year that we had all the state queens. They were queens two years in a row because of COVID. So I started looking into it then and I wound up competing in 2022 for the 2023 title. And I wound up actually coming in third place.\n\nWhich is huge.\n\nIt was kind of a shell shock. And I was certainly just, but you know, if you come into something, you have, everyone has to start somewhere. So my platform is “Start Somewhere”\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd you know, I started at the bottom. I didn’t know what to do. My horsemanship was not great. My interview skills were not great. I was really nervous. I totally bombed my speech the first year. I mean, I think I got frozen on stage, looked my mom dead in the eyes and was like, “Thank you all for coming, goodbye.” So, I mean, it was just like a whole process. So, the second year I came back, and I was like, okay, we’re gonna practice our horsemanship, our interview. I made sure people quizzed me and tested me.\n\nSo what people may not know is there’s actually a written test that goes along with the PRCA rulebook, which the PRCA is the Pro -Rodeo Cowboys Association, which is what all of us state queens are under. And when you do the test, it’s a lot of just facts. It’s a lot of flash card facts, it’s horsemanship facts, it’s parts of the horse, parts of the saddle, illnesses, everything like that. So you really have to study and look forward to it. I’m not a great test taker, so I struggled on that. And it was definitely hard to kind of step myself back up. I was really defeated after the first year, and I was like, I’m not coming back.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd then I was like, hold on, let me just retrace my steps and fix what I could do better. So this past year I competed and it went super well. I feel like I really aced everything. Obviously I would hope I did.\n\nYes, you’re here.\n\nBut I am here and it was just such a great accomplishment. So, you know, if anyone is out there, please do not get discouraged. Just try again, every day is a new day. Another chance.\n\nYeah, well I love that story. I think that there’s so much to be said for that. When you compete, I don’t know if I would have had the courage honestly to go back and retry again. Placing third and then just being like okay, let me try this again. It looks like though or sounds like you did your due diligence. Like you went in you went back to studying, you did all the training that it took to kind of get here. your title today.\n\nYes, and that’s the thing, is you have to really upkeep it. So later on in the year, I’ll actually go and compete for Miss Rodeo America. And if you think that the state, if I thought the state was hard, you’d think competing against all the other states.\n\nHow many states actually partake in it?\n\nThis past year, I believe we had 33. This year, I think we have more, just because I think we have more queens and more interest in it. Kind of becoming a more well-known thing. So if we can spread the word even more, hopefully we can get all the states on board.\n\nYeah, that would be amazing.\n\nYeah, it would be awesome.\n\nSo, okay, you were saying that you’ve refined your learning abilities and test taking and I kind of want to go ahead and quiz you.\n\nOkay.\n\nI came up with a list of questions on Chelsea’s Trivia Extravaganza. Are you ready to kind of dive in on these questions?\n\nI’m ready, I’m ready, I’ve been prepared.\n\nAll right, are we gonna queue it up on the screen here? Woo, there we are. Look at that Izzy. Oh, you look beautiful. For all of those that are listening and not able to actually see us, Izzy has on her beautiful crown. She’s got this gorgeous white, hat with her big gold, what is that? It’s called a crown, right?\n\nYeah, this is our crown, yeah.\n\nBig gold crown.\n\nIt’s actually a separate piece from our hat, so we can change different hats.\n\nAnd then she’s got a gorgeous belt buckle. It has her name on it. It’s so amazing, and she has on her, what is it?\n\nIt’s a sash.\n\nSash, yes. It’s gorgeous.\n\nThank you.\n\nAnyways, okay, so I just wanna give you a little bit of a visual description as to what she looks like. Are we ready to go? I want to stump you.\n\nChelsea wants me to hear that noise.\n\nI do, I want you to get at least one wrong. That way. I know I did my job. Okay, we’re gonna hop in, I’m sorry. Giddy up, let’s go. Okay, question one. In calf roping, what is the rope in the roper’s mouth called?\n\nOh goodness, is this a pigging string?\n\nYes.\n\nHey, great.\n\nI was like, does she know it, does she not? Are these too hard? I’m thinking, oh my gosh\n\nGoodness. That one is a tough one, actually.\n\nIs it?\n\nYes. I think if you asked a lot of rodeo people who weren’t involved with calf roping, I think they would have questions. Although, unless you goat tie, if you goat tie as well, you’d use the same type of deal.\n\nOkay, well, we’re off to a good start here.\n\nSo far.\n\nNumber two, the term balking means, what does it mean?\n\nOh goodness, I might get this wrong.\n\nIt’s okay.\n\nShe might have me stumped, guys. So, balking, I believe is normally when your horse is like kind of like backing off like away from, I don’t know how to describe this. I can like to show you.\n\nIt refuses to come out of the what. What does it refuse to come out of?\n\nThe shoot?\n\nYay!\n\nOkay! I’m over here like..\n\nNow I’m aiming for you to win. I’m like, jeeze, these are too hard.\n\nNo, no, not at all. See, so I’m a barrel racer and that might have a really bad stigma around it, especially if you watch Yellowstone, we are not all super cuckoo crazy, I promise. Maybe a little about our horses, but that’s about it. But so my mind is like over here in rodeo barrel, like barrel racer, so I’m like in the alley sitting on my horse, my horse does that in the alley, not the shoot, so.\n\nOh Lord have mercy, I’m so sorry. Okay, well let’s try this one. This is a calf roper situation. How many legs are tied to keep the calf roper tied together?\n\nThat would be three.\n\nYes!\n\nYes! Easy.\n\nI gotta be quiet when that nay comes because I’m overriding it.\n\nI like the nay, that sounds like my horse when I bring snacks to him. He just whinnies at me the whole time, he’s nickering.\n\nI love that. Okay, let’s see, question number four. What is the rider who rides on the right side of the steer wrestler called?\n\nThat would be a bulldogger.\n\nNo, I Have it as a hazer.\n\nOh, yeah. Oh hazer. Well bulldogging is another name for steer wrestling I spoke too soon\n\nOh well, they’re both right. I mean you knew it was hazing so there we go, we got it. What penalty is assessed on a barrel racer for knocking down a barrel?\n\nThat would be a five second penalty.\n\nYes, I was like, if you don’t get this one right.\n\nYes, yeah. We’ve been there a couple of times, unfortunately, if you don’t knock a barrel, you know.\n\nHow many times does it actually take place? Like when you’re in the rodeo, does that happen often or is it?\n\nIt can happen, I mean, it’s really a game of chance, honestly, but if you’re consistent and you’re practicing. or you’re like Lisa Lockhart and you can lift your leg above your head to get around the barrel, then you can do it.\n\nNow, are the rodeos inside or outside? We’re kind of taking a sidetrack, but I think weather conditions would probably make–\n\nReally, there’s both. So summer season, there’s a lot of outdoor rodeos, obviously it’s warmer, it’s nicer, there’s not as much rain, also depends on what state you’re in. So for example, if you’re in a more northern state or like the Northwest, like Washington, where it rains all the time you’re most likely gonna have more indoor rodeos. But down here in the Carolinas, we’re all outside.\n\nAre you?\n\nOh yeah, most of it.\n\nSo if it’s really windy, do you get sand kicked up in your eye?\n\nSometimes, sand, your hat might try to come off…\n\nDo you have straps to keep the hat on?\n\nI actually do not. I have my tips and tricks.\n\nI wanna know.\n\nWould you like to know?\n\nYes.\n\nOkay, all right, I’m giving away my secrets here.\n\nI am done.\n\nWhen I ride and I have my crown and my hat on, to keep my hat on, I use toupee tape.\n\nReally?\n\nI take, you know, you would stick to a person’s head for the toupee?\n\nYes.\n\nI take that little piece of tape and I stick it to my forehead and I stick my hat on the toupee tape and it just stays.\n\nMy mouth is on the floor. I have no idea.\n\nIt sounds goofy when I wear it.\n\nIt would beat having a strap. To me, maybe a strap would be a little bit weird or like a fastener.\n\nYeah, well, growing up, I mean, I rode English and jumping in the English world, it’s a lot more of helmets.\n\nIt is, I love the look. I love it, I think it’s just the equestrian like, you know, it’s just so proper looking, very beautiful.\n\nWell, it is sleek and, you know, your brain’s kind of important. So we would like to protect that. that.\n\nYeah.\n\nI know a lot more people than I should that have broken their neck. So, you know, helmets, I am all for helmet safety. Actually, when I was a little kid and I used to do summer camps, my instructor would play this, it was called the helmet safety video. And I think it was from probably like 1975. And it was a VHS tape. I mean, she put it in her little VHS tape, you know, player.\n\nYeah?\n\nYeah, the VHS player, and we would watch it as like little kids, and it was terrifying,\n\nyou know?\n\nThat is scary.\n\n‘Cause it showed people that had traumatic injuries, and you’re like, you know, I don’t wanna become that, so, you know, safety comes first, always be safe.\n\nSafety, yes, for sure. So we have the toupee tape is what keeps that.\n\nToupee tape, yeah, some girls use eyelash glue, like for your fake eyelashes, and they do that, but I am so afraid my hat’s going to come off. I am so tall, so everything catches a little differently with the wind.\n\nRight.\n\nSo that toupee tape off Amazon.\n\nWow, I love it. All right, all right. Okay, let’s get back. So, let’s see, where were we? What question are we on? We’re on number six. All right, what does breaking the barrier in a rodeo mean?\n\nOkay, so in your roping events or in your… bulldogging events, the calf has to have a head start. So most places they actually have a rope around the calf’s neck. It’s, I think, I don’t remember how many feet it is. That sounds really bad. But you, the calf gets a couple feet ahead. And if you go and you cross the barrier that’s in front of like your box, call it the roping box, in front of your box, before that calf gets a head start, that’s a penalty.\n\nGotcha, that is correct. I mean, on my end, way to go. All right, question seven, what is a bulldogger?\n\nOkay, so a bulldogger, we just kind of talked about this. Yes, they jump off their horses and they grab the steers by a horn. So a steer is, you know, a young, I don’t want to say cow because that’s incorrect, but a steer has horns and they’re usually like a young bull.\n\nAnd they’re angry, right? Aren’t they kind of angry?\n\nNo, they’re pretty sweet. They’re pretty docile. But this stems from back when we would have to brand and castrate back in the Wild West. So when they jump off, they grab the steer’s horns and they pull them down to their shoulder on the ground. And once that steer is completely flat, that’s when they raise their hand. and the time goes.\n\nGot it.\n\nSame thing, basically, as a steer wrestler, but we also have what we call shootdoggers, and there’s a girls division, actually, in the Carolinas.\n\nWhat is that?\n\nSo we don’t jump off horses. We actually just hold the steer’s heads in the chute, so like a chute gate, like a bucking stock would come out of, and we do the same thing. We let them come out of the chute, and you just pull them to the ground.\n\nHave you done it?\n\nI have not yet. I’m going to try it this year.\n\nAre you?\n\nI’m scared. My best friend split her pants doing it. (laughing)\n\nOh my gosh.\n\nI’m gonna try it though. I’m excited.\n\nGet some spandex pants or something.\n\nYes, right?\n\nOh, like what size are these steers? I mean, how many pounds are we talking?\n\nThey’re about 400 pounds. They’re a good size, yeah.\n\nThey are a good size. Outside of wearing a cowboy hat, I mean, what are some protective gear? You know, I feel like you should be wearing artillery, like we should be in steel costumes. I mean, what are you–\n\nMedieval Renaissance, like the Knights outfit.\n\nYes, exactly.\n\nSo we have–\n\nLook at you here. We just pulled up an image.\n\nOh my goodness, yes.\n\nSo this is you with your English. Your horse is so beautiful. Who, what horse?\n\nThis is Newcastle. He’s my, this is my Irishman.\n\nYou’re a little 20 years old.\n\nYes, I think he was probably about 16 or 17 in this pic. And I think I was also probably 15 in this picture. But yes, speaking of the sleek helmet.\n\nIt is a sleek helmet.\n\nYes, we have the whole English look going on here. We used to do the jumpers, which is a timed event. So it’s not judged on looks or anything. So no one look at my equitation if you’re watching this. I was very young. but he’s so good at jumping. He’s just a blast to jump. He’d go so fast. I mean, it was awesome.\n\nIt had to be exhilarating sitting in that saddle or out of the saddle, I guess, when you jump.\n\nYes, yes, that’s actually called a two point, fun fact.\n\nOkay.\n\nSo our two point or AKA jumping position is when you’re up off of your horse’s back and it just allows them to round out their back and kind of get over the jump nicer.\n\nHere’s another picture of you doing some barrel racing.\n\nYes, that’s me, that is Benjamin. I really liked his bottom in this picture. He’s squatting low there, sitting around the barrel.\n\nMuscle, I mean, that’s power right there.\n\nHe is pure power and he is the biggest goofball you will meet. He always has hay in his mane, somewhere, somehow. And he will be in your pocket. He will be your best friend. If you ignore him, he gets sad. So that’s my buddy, he’s a sweetheart. But yeah, that was back, oh goodness. That had to be right after I was a freshman in college, maybe.\n\nSo it’s interesting that you’re not wearing a cowboy hat in that photo, but in a helmet. Is that what you wear in traditional barrel racing?\n\nSo traditionally, you would wear a cowboy hat back in, I think before 2019, it was you had to wear a cowboy hat, cowboy boots, belt, and a button -up shirt tucked in. That was your–\n\nThat’s your uniform.\n\nAttire, yes, the uniform. Now we’ve switched over to helmets. There’s been a lot of safety talk, and one of my favorite barrel racers is Fallon Taylor, and she actually broke her vertebrae. She broke her neck, she was in the big Regina George neck thing.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd she preaches helmet safety awareness and now she is a truck sole sponsor, which is a brand of helmet and she makes all these cool colors. So it matches all of our barrel racing stuff. I have like a tie dye one, it’s super fun.\n\nAh, that is so, so cool.\n\nWhen I race I normally wear a helmet just because we’re going so fast and anything can happen. I’ve seen some crazy accidents.\n\nAbsolutely, I love this photo. Tell me a little bit about this one.\n\nOkay, so this is not a typical rodeo event. This is called pole bending. And you have six poles that you’re weaving in and out of. You go up and back down. This is one thing with Benjamin. Here’s his front side. He’s super cute on the front too.\n\nHe is.\n\nBut this is our favorite event. It’s a speed event once again.\n\nSo how fast and how many pegs? So for those of you just listening and not actually seeing this image, it is, well, why don’t you describe it? You’re better than what I would say.\n\nOkay, so basically you have six poles. They look like PVC pipes, which they pretty much are. They’re about six feet tall and they’re all in a line. And this picture is of myself on my cute little bay horse. Well, he’s actually registered paint, but he’s a solid. And we are weaving through these poles here. And it’s a timed event. So it’s pretty cool. But, in this–\n\nDid the poles ever fall down? ‘Cause they look like they could.\n\nThey could, so it’s kind of the same premise as barrel racing, it’s a five second penalty for every pole you knock, same with barrels. So I have caught myself on the end pole before, and actually if you look at my feet in this picture, you’ll see my right toe turns out more than my left.\n\nI see that.\n\nMy right toe has caught a pole a time or two on accident So it is not that it’s my horses fault, iit was mine for sure, but yeah, that’s my buddy. This was actually at a finals race. And this is Benjamin. Ben actually won me a paycheck at that race. So that was pretty cool.\n\nWow.\n\nThat was one of my favorites. My friend and I placed back to back, so we were the top two in the division, so that was pretty cool.\n\nSo, so, so cool. All right, oh, I love this picture.\n\nYeah, so this is a recent one because I have my crown.\n\nYes, you do. Love that buckle.\n\nOh my goodness. Thank you.\n\nAnd the crown. I love it all.\n\nAnd that’s actually our perpetual crown. So we actually have two different crowns right now in rotation. So this one I’ll wear in nicer weather when we’re just kind of doing…\n\nRadio interviews.\n\nMore formal stuff. Radio interviews.\n\nWhen you’re here.\n\nEverything like that, when I’m here in the cool studio. But that one is more for like different weather. But this is my vintage man. This is Newcastle now, he is 28. You can see the gray has started to spread on his face. He’s got a little dip in his withers, but that is my main buddy. I love him.\n\nThat is your buddy. Aw. What’s the longevity of a life of a horse?\n\nSo it used to be around 30 years old. We’re finding horses live longer just because we have more.\n\nYeah, better nutrition, probably veterinary care.\n\nNutrition, vet care, same, kind of same with humans.\n\nYeah, yeah.\n\nCatch diseases earlier, so. And we’re also trying to, and I don’t speak for everyone, but a lot of people are trying to breed out poor conformation, so like how a horse looks, their bone structure, their coat styles, as they grow older, so that’s really helping the horse industry in letting them live longer.\n\nThat’s wonderful. Thank you so much.\n\nNewcastle’s gonna live forever. I’m convinced.\n\nHe is, he’s got another at least 28 years.\n\nYes, easily.\n\nYes, yes. Okay, let’s go back to our trivia. We are on number, number eight. Okay. Which of the following roping events begin? Oh, this is a good one. Which of the following roping event began out of the medical need during the turn of the century?\n\nA medical need for?\n\nI think for the safety of the, that’s a good question.\n\nI was gonna say team roping.\n\nIt’s tie down roping.\n\nIs it tie down?\n\nYeah, tie down.\n\n‘Cause I can see both, so I would say team just because we normally, when we tag and brand and castrate, if you’re doing it on horseback, you’re doing it as a team. Because you’re spreading them so that way you don’t get kicked by a cow, which does not feel good.\n\nRight. You would think, right?\n\nBut the tie -down makes sense too, because if you’re alone and you’re a single cowboy and you’re doing it, then you have to use, you know, all your pig and string, all resources.\n\nRight.\n\nAnd have a darn good horse too.\n\nAnd you giddy up girl, okay. That’s my southern twang there guys for all of you that are listening. Um, all right, so I think that was a point for me then.\n\nYes, that was a point for you, that was a point for you.\n\nOkay, okay, okay.\n\nWe’ll give it to you, it’s okay.\n\nWhat is the term used for a female horse under the age of four?\n\nA filly.\n\nYes, where does that come from? What’s the origin of that?\n\nI actually could not tell you. So under the age of four for a male would be a colt.\n\nOkay.\n\nA year would be yearling, and then anything after that would be a horse. I call everything a filly a pony or a baby horse. Everything’s cute to me. So we have like a six year old at the barn where I work and he’s still a baby horse. So fun fact, horses aren’t fully developed unitl they’re six.\n\nReally?\n\nSo to me, they’re still toddlers anywhere between the ages of two and five.\n\nBatman, right? Is that your youngest?\n\nYes, Batman. He’s actually seven or eight this year. He’s getting old. He’s matured now.\n\nWow.\n\nHe’s my little buddy, but he was very cute when he was tiny. I knew him when he was like much smaller. He’s precious. Definitely has that toddler attitude though.\n\nDoes he?\n\nOh yeah, the ponies have sass, so that’s for sure.\n\nWhat is the tallest horse breed? Is question 10.\n\nOh goodness, well that would be your draft horse. But, but she’s looking at me like she’s gonna stump me right now. And I really wanna go with Persher on, but I feel like that’s wrong. And it could be a Belgian.\n\nI have it as a Shire.\n\nOh, the Shires, yes, they are huge. So draft horses, like what you would use for pulling carts or if you see the Shire, like if you watch the Royal–\n\nYes.\n\nAnything, you have the big drum horses? So those are Shires. So they’re all huge. I actually worked with a giant Belgian horse. He was 19 hands. So a hand is four inches. It’s actually the width of your hand from like your thumb to pinky. And so if you think 19 hands, what that translates to is his back was over my head and I’m six feet tall. So he was huge, insane.\n\nThat is crazy.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd that was a Shire or what was that?\n\nHe was a Belgian.\n\nA Belgian.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat are the Budweiser horses?\n\nThose are Clydesdales.\n\nOh, I love those. They’re so beautiful.\n\nThey’re so cute.\n\nIt’s like so American.\n\nIt is. It’s very American.\n\nIt is.\n\nI love the draft horses. They’re probably the sweetest.\n\nAre they?\n\nThey’re big, gentle giants. Oh yeah. It’s like when you meet a great dame, I’ve never met a bad great dame.\n\nYeah, no, they’re always so sweet.\n\nYes, so it’s like the giant horses are always the best too.\n\nHow many bones are in a horse’s body? Is the next question, question 11.\n\nOh my goodness, she really, you’re really like stumping me here today.\n\nOh my, thank you. I’m like grinning. It’s okay. You’re gonna do it. Do you want me to give you a range?\n\nI wanna say it’s close to ours, is it not?\n\nI don’t know how many bones we have actually.\n\n206.\n\nOh my gosh, you were like one off.\n\nIs it 205 or 206?\n\nYes!\n\n205?\n\nYes! I’m gonna give you that one.\n\nOkay, cool, thanks.\n\nWhere’s that nae, where’s that nae? Okay, Give me that nae, give me that nae. We have 205 bones in the horse’s body.\n\nInteresting, I wonder what their one less is.\n\nYeah, I didn’t know we had 206.\n\nOh gosh, I don’t know, what is theirs?\n\nMaybe one less tooth.\n\nOh my gosh, I think they have more teeth than we do.\n\nIt’s insane.\n\nTheir teeth never fail to just amaze me. Because if you look at a horse, right, okay, and they lift their lips up at all, they have those front teeth, right?\n\nYeah.\n\nBut what you don’t realize is there’s a gap for their bit and then their teeth go all the way up the sides of their cheeks.\n\nI didn’t know that either.\n\nYeah, so it’s insane. I mean, their teeth go all the way back and their molars with the roots are like this long.\n\nOh, I can only imagine.\n\nLike that’s like a solid of four inches. They’re huge, insane.\n\nListen, when I had my wisdom teeth pulled. I was blown away. I got to keep my, okay, we’re not gonna go down that rabbit hole.\n\nNot that rabbit hole.\n\nBut anyways, yes, I can’t even imagine a horse’s tooth, but I don’t know where that extra bone is in our human anatomy.\n\nI don’t either, yeah, that’s a good fact, yeah.\n\nOkay, the final question of the day for this trivia extravaganza is–\n\nI love this question.\n\nWhat are the five parts of a horse’s hoof?\n\nOkay, so you have the bars, sole, the wall, the frog. Hold on, I have to think of what a hoof looks like. You have the heel bulbs as well.\n\nSo I have it as the heel, the toe.\n\nOh yes, the toe, I think it’s the only one I forgot.\n\nYeah, the wall, the bar.\n\nAnd the sole.\n\nAnd the frog.\n\nAnd the frog, yeah.\n\nWhy is it called a frog? I think of like, you know, the green thing that jumps around.\n\nYes, well it’s funny, that’s why we say horses as they’re said to be. springy when they jump is ’cause they have frogs on the bottom of their feet.\n\nOh, that’s clever.\n\nBut the frog actually, what it does is it pumps blood and circulates through their legs. So the reason why if you talk to a farrier that frog has to touch the ground at some point and it pushes the blood back through their legs and body.\n\nOh, that’s impressive.\n\nYeah, it’s actually quite squishy if you touch it, it’s actually quite sensitive too.\n\nWell, okay, so with a horse’s shoe.\n\nYes.\n\nSo that would be on the toe part of it then, correct?\n\nYes, the toe and kind of like the, your nails go into the wall. So yeah, it’d be on the toe and part of the sole.\n\nI’m learning so much today, you have no idea.\n\nOh good.\n\nWhat is next for you today? Or no, what is next for you today? What am I saying? (laughing)\n\nI guess they have to go to work. Yay!\n\nWhat is next for you this month? this year?\n\nSo I actually leave on Saturday to go to Rodeo Houston and Stock Show.\n\nAmazing.\n\nI made the pivot team.\n\nThat is incredible. What is the pivot team?\n\nSo the pivot team is the flag girls at the beginning, middle, and end of the rodeo. So we carry sponsor flags. We ride what we call the Cervi Black Horses. And that is the Cervi Pro Rodeo Company. They own those horses and they provide them for us. So they’re all matching. There’s like 15 black horses, beautiful, and I love them. So we get to run around with the flags and only 30 girls over the span of the whole Rodeo Houston Stock Show, which I think is a total of three to four weeks get chosen out of hundreds of applicants. So I feel really honored and really blessed.\n\nThis has been a huge dream and goal of mine. So I cannot wait to go to Houston. I’ve never been, so.\n\nThat is so exciting. I’m so excited for it. For you.\n\nYes, thank you.\n\nThat is so amazing. Is there anything that you wanna share as part of your title holdings? Like, what are you passionate about? I feel like this is like the end of the interview where I’m like, tell me, like what is, what do you hope to get done this year in your title ship, if that’s even–\n\nYeah, so I really hope to educate the youth and everyone about not only the importance of rodeo, rodeo, but also the importance of agriculture and what we can do to help our farmers and our community. I would also love to really reach out and get more sponsors for our program, for our Miss Rodeo North Carolina program. Besides my division, we also have a sweetheart princess, junior and teen. So we’re always looking for sponsors if anyone would like to sponsor.\n\nHow can you become a sponsor? What are the steps?\n\nYou can become a sponsor through going. to our Facebook or Instagram page. There’s a whole packet on there. There’s different sponsorship levels and every level gets something awesome. Actually, I have something for you guys today.\n\nWhat?\n\nThat is one of our sponsor gifts. And let me see if I can get it out of my purse here. It is actually my head shot. What a nice little signature. So this is for you guys ’cause I appreciate you guys so much for having me on.\n\nI, where’s the camera? I love this. You guys, you gotta check into the Miss Rodeo North Carolina. We need sponsors, y ‘all.\n\nYes, and we are a 501 (c)(3) nonprofit. So everything we do, our whole organization is volunteer -based. My director is an awesome volunteer. Everyone in the board, myself, and all the other misses, we’re just super excited to really just serve our community and our rodeo world. So really this year, I just wanna put a name for us on the map and make sure that people really know that rodeo isn’t dying, we’re not giving up, and we’re here to stay.\n\nNo, I love that.\n\nThank you.\n\nIt has been such an honor and a privilege to have you here today. I’ve learned so much.\n\nThank you so much. I’m just like blown away. I’ve always wanted to be on the radio, so thank you for letting my dreams come true.\n\nOf course, we want you back.\n\nYes, I’d be happy to.\n\nIs there any way to follow you on this rodeo in Texas?\n\nYes, so please follow my journey.
