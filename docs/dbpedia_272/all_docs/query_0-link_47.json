Featuring Oui The Label's Marigold and Elevate, photographer Kate encapsulated this enchantingly organised shoot!\n\nThe additional details of what a bride-to-be’s wedding could incorporate are what made this shoot oh-so-touching to us.\n\nElevate’s dramatic puff sleeves and Marigold’s structured, strapless bodice are contemporary wedding gowns made for the modern bride! Head over to a Paperswan Bride’s boutique, to explore more of Oui The Label's bridal gown styles."
