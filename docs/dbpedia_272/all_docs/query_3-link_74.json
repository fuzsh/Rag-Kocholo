        "text": "Last weekend, I was invited to stay for a night at the beautiful Royal Palms Resort. As you all know, I love a good staycation. You get the feeling of being on vacation but your journey back home the next day is only a short drive away. No airport hassles! The best. Plus, to me it’s so fun to experience all the different resorts and food that Arizona has to offer. Maybe I need to start an Arizona travel guide!? ?\n\nI usually travel with at least JJ and Vivienne during these nights away (most of the time the dogs join too) but this time… I decided to leave them all at home and take a girlfriend with me instead. It was only my second time being away from Vivienne overnight, so you can imagine that a little me time was necessary. Great food, spa treatments, and an uninterrupted night of sleep. It’s not always easy to be away, but reminds me of the importance for us mamas to take the time for ourselves.\n\nOf course, not everyone has the luxury of staying the night away. It’s as easy as sitting in a quiet room after the kids go to bed with a good book, tv show, or even your favorite dessert in hand. It’s taking the time to escape your crazy busy life and enjoy something for you! For me… I am all about the treats! The new Oui by Yoplait French style yogurt is a simple and delicious pleasure. The yogurt is subtly sweet with an incredibly fresh taste. Have you taken the time for you today?\n\nThis is a sponsored conversation written by me on behalf of Yoplait. The opinions and text are all mine.\n\nPhotos by @Amaes_Photography"
