        "text": "This article contains the full transcript of Elias and the Royal Yacht.\n\nEnglish Transcript[]\n\nNOTE: Taken directly from the Norwegian DVD’s English Subtitles by Nick Norris and Trine Borg.\n\nMost of the Cozy Cove boats are gathered around a barge full of burning wood in the harbour as Jovial tells a story;\n\nJovial: The hurricane is about to smash the Royal Yacht. The wind bowls so hard the jellyfish turn to jello. Then his rudder breaks in two! My dear friends, the Royal Yacht is convinced the end is near. When suddenly a boat appears. The Royal Yacht yells out “Head back! The ocean will swallow us both!” But the boat refuses to listen because this is the rescue boat; Fearless.\n\nHe licks his top lip.\n\nJovial: He hooks his cable to the Royal Yacht - and tows him gently home to the Royal Harbor. When the others see that Fearless has rescued the Royal Yacht… Well… You could hear their cheers all the way here to Cozy Cove.\n\nElias: How did he do it, in that hurricane?\n\nJovial: He simply never gave up. Fearless doesn’t give a da… [pauses] He never gave up. That’s what made him the greatest rescue boat ever!\n\nElias looks admiringly. Some burning wood falls out the barge, making Cruiser jump.\n\nSentimental: We better put the fire out.\n\nFishmonger: Those clouds will take care of it.\n\nElias: Come on, Swifty, let’s make our rounds, and check things out.\n\nElias and Swifty exit the cove and head through the fjord.\n\nThe waves are already becoming more fierce as they pass Little Blinky. The hurricane is visible in the distance.\n\nElias: [cont’d] This storm is gonna be a big one.\n\nIt’s now completely dark and the waves are very large. Elias and Swifty sail on until Elias eyes the outline of a nearby vessel.\n\nElias: Hey! Wait!\n\nIt’s Rocke Gabrielsen II; a wide yacht. Elias trundles alongside.\n\nElias: It’s dangerous out here! Head for the Port!\n\nRocke Gabrielsen II: You think I should? The day I need help from a measly little rescue boat from the middle of nowhere, then I’ll let you know!\n\nElias is a little hurt, but shrugs it off and heads back in the direction of Cozy Cliffs. Rocke confidently battles the stormy seas, until one wave is so fierce, it nearby tips him.\n\nHe speeds back to Elias and Swifty.\n\nRocke Gabrielsen II: Sorry I seemed so brash before. You’re only doing your job.\n\nElias: Yes?\n\nRocke Gabrielsen II: You see, I need to get to Big Bay as quickly as possible. And since you seem so… fearless… You may have the honor of escorting me - Rocke Gabrielsen II - to Big Bay.\n\nElias: It’s not safe to go to Big Bay now. Follow me to the nearest Port.\n\nRocke Gabrielsen II: I am a patient yacht, but I don’t have time for this. Escort me to Big Bay this instant!\n\nElias: I’m sorry, Mr. Gabrielsen. I can’t leave my district.\n\nRocke Gabrielsen II: (furiously) What are you saying?\n\nElias: I can only take orders from the Rescue Center.\n\nRocke Gabrielsen II: You… you… rude, little… [snaps] No one says “no” to Rocke Gabrielsen!\n\nThe furious yacht races for the open sea.\n\nElias: (sadly) He would have never treated Fearless like that.\n\nThe next day, it’s dusk in the Port of Cozy Cove and Craney is unloading fish from Smacky. Trawler is in line.\n\nCraney: I hope Elias shows up soon. This super-urgent express message from Big Bay is for him.\n\nTrawler shoves Smacky out of the loading quay.\n\nTrawler: [cont’d] Here’s a super-urgent express message from Trawler; Get his darn catch off me before it starts sinkin’.\n\nFishmonger is annoyed. Then they hear Elias’ motor.\n\nCraney: There you are!\n\nElias and Swifty have returned.\n\nElias: What’s up?\n\nCraney gets out the message.\n\nCraney: Let me see… “To Elias. Come to the Rescue Center in Big Bay right now!”\n\nElias: Is that it?\n\nCraney: Eh… Yes.\n\nElias: The Rescue Center in Big Bay! I’ve never been there before!\n\nAs he and Swiftly head out. The Red Houses chat among each other;\n\nRed Houses: [chattering]\n\nRed Houses: Big Bay is the capital!\n\nNaughty: It isn’t exactly the center of the universe.\n\nCraney: Imagine that! Elias is going all the way to Big Bay!\n\nTrawler: Big Bay? So what? I, Trawler, am going as far up as Rofoten to fish. Last year, I beat the record set by that trawling cheat; Pedro Gonzales!\n\nThe Red Houses are more amused or apathetic than impressed.\n\nTrawler: [cont’d/o.s.] Trawler hauled up so much halibut,\n\nHe biffs the loading quay, making Fishmonger jump.\n\nTrawler: [cont’d] there wasn’t even a single sea urchin left out there!\n\nTrawler glares towards the sea with a small chuckle.\n\nElias and Swifty travel to Big Bay. It’s night by the time they arrive at the harbor buoy.\n\nThey pass by an industrial area and hear;\n\nElias: Cool music! Let’s ask where the Rescue Center is.\n\nThey head down a canal full of old equipment, then tons and tons of containers. Conversations can be heard.\n\nThe moment Elias sails out of the Canal, a reach stacker grabs him.\n\nReach Stacker: Look what the gulls threw away!\n\nHe throws him towards a giant gantry crane named Siggy.\n\nSiggy: Have you ever seen such cuddly babies? You looking for something?\n\nElias: Yes… We’re looking for the Rescue…\n\nTwo more gantry cranes on each side of Siggy roll in.\n\nRight Gantry Crane: Lose your pacifier?\n\nLeft Gantry Crane: Need to poo-poo?\n\nSeveral cranes laugh.\n\nSiggy: Was there something you wanted, Chubby?\n\nElias: No. We’re going to the Rescue Center.\n\nSiggy: It’s common courtesy to introduce yourself.\n\nElias: This is Swifty. And I’m Elias, the Rescue Boat.\n\nSiggy: You don’t say, Elias and Swifty? Allow us to introduce ourselves.\n\nSong: The Night is Long - Elias is violently thrown around by several cranes on the quay, first by the Right Gantry Crane.\n\nTall Crane: Did we freak you out?\n\nEveryone in the Port laughs at Elias.\n\nSiggy: You look a little shaky. Scared of heights? I’ve heard of Fearless, but it looks like your name should be ‘Fearful’!\n\nElias seems calmly dejected. Swifty turns.\n\nElias: Hang on, Swifty. (jovially and nonchalantly) Can you guys tell me where the Rescue Center is?\n\nThe Gantry Cranes are a little stunned. Siggy is impressed.\n\nSiggy: I think we’re got a tough one here! [to Elias] Sure, we know where it is, but why go there now? Spend the night here, where the action is.\n\nThe next dusk, the Container Port is working. The middle gantry crane loads the last container onto one of the ships.\n\nRight Gantry Crane: That was the last one. I need a drink!\n\nAs the container ship leaves, the left and middle crane prematurely show off with their expending arms.\n\nSuverina: You sure look happy. Hook something big?\n\nSiggy: I’m a professional crane. We’ve lifted 1455 containers today!\n\nHe nudges his crew.\n\nSiggy: [cont'd] Are we awesome or what?!\n\nSuverina: I wonder how things went with that little rescue boat.\n\nSiggy: Hey, there he is!\n\nElias enters the Port looking sad; sailing towards Suverina and the Gantry Cranes, who are all somewhat sympathetic.\n\nElias: Swifty. They took him away from me.\n\nSuverina: What?\n\nElias: They won’t let me be a rescue boat anymore.\n\nThe gantry cranes’ attention has been taken off him.\n\nSiggy: Here he comes.\n\nRocke Gabrielsen II speeds into the Port. The gantry cranes look at him respectfully.\n\nSiggy: Good evening, Mr. Gabrielsen!\n\nRocke Gabrielsen II: Status?\n\nSiggy: 1455.\n\nRocke Gabrielsen II: (patronisingly) Ah really… You must be pleased with yourself.\n\nSiggy glares proudly and looks at his pals.\n\nRocke Gabrielsen II: [changes his tune] But tomorrow, I want over 2000. Or else, I’ll dock your pay. All of you! Understood?\n\nHe looks left and his apathetic expression instantly changes to fury as he sets his eyes on Elias. He slowly drifts towards him...\n\nRocke Gabrielsen II: (holding his anger) You look familiar. That’s right. You’re the so-called “rescue boat” from Cozy Cove. What are you doing here?\n\nElias: I…\n\nSurvina: Elias is on vacation. Visiting me.\n\nRocke Gabrielsen II: Vacation? I see. Is that what you call it? [raises his voice] You should all know, Elias is no longer a rescue boat.\n\nElias looks down for a second and seeing this, Survina glowers at the ranting Rocke.\n\nRocke Gabrielsen II: [cont’d] The poor thing has gone and done something utterly unforgivable. He neglected to rescue me, when I was in desperate need of help!\n\nSiggy looks at Elias - surprised.\n\nElias: What? Tha… That isn’t true!\n\nRocke Gabrielsen II: [reduced to tears] I could have been lost out there. I was totally helpless! [cries] I only saved myself by the skin of my teeth. It hurt, but I had no choice. [aggressively] I had to report him, Rocke Gabrielsen II is a man of honor.\n\nAll three gantry crane glare at Elias.\n\nRocke Gabrielsen II: But Elias, didn’t you have a little dinghy buddy? That’s right! They took him away from you. Are you all alone now?\n\nElias doesn’t reply. He merely looks down very sad.\n\nRocke Gabrielsen II: There, there, Elias. I am a yacht with a big heart. You can stay here till tomorrow. (furiously) But after that, I never want to see you in my Container Port again! [leaves] Goodbye!\n\nElias looks at the gantry cranes. Siggy and the left crane look ahead while the right one shoots him a nasty look.\n\nThat night, Elias looks one more time at the Container Port and sails to the buoy. When he gets there, Suverina cruises alongside.\n\nElias: [sighs] I wanted to be like Fearless.\n\nSuverina: Fearless? Who’s that?\n\nElias: The world’s greatest rescue boat. He rescued the Royal Yacht once.\n\nSuverina: Wow… The Royal Yacht?\n\nElias nods.\n\nSuverina: [nudges him] Come here. Let me show you something.\n\nThey sail to the…\n\nSuverina: Look! The Royal Harbour!\n\nElias: Wow!\n\nOnce near the statue, the two boats turn off their lights and sail towards the building. The two guards are asleep.\n\nSuverina: Those guards are good for nothing.\n\nElias: [referring to the dinghies on the right] Who are those guys?\n\nSuverina: Paparazzi. They stick their noses into absolutely everything. Let’s sneak inside!\n\nElias: Is that such a good idea?\n\nSuverina: Shh… You won’t regret it. It’s amazing in there.\n\nElias cruises past the Guards, goes through the corridor leading to the hall.\n\nHe looks excitedly and admiringly at the portraits of past rescue boats on the wall. One raises his positive mood:\n\nElias: Fearless!\n\nRocke Gabrielsen II: [o.s.] But we have the healthiest food in the world!\n\nThree boats are coming down the corridor.\n\nAdjudant Hoff: Monsieur Gabrielsen, who has told you such lies?\n\nSuverina: Elias! [pulls him down another hallway and they watch on]\n\nAdjudant Hoff [cont’d/o.s.]: Your food za most boring in za world.\n\nRocke Gabrielsen II [o.s.]: You…\n\nAdjudant Hoff [o.s.]: What?\n\nRocke Gabrielsen II: Frog eater!\n\nAdmiral Bang: Gentleman! The Coast Day is in less than a week.\n\nAdjudant Hoff: It is not like za Royal Yacht to disappear like zis. He has not been himzelf lately.\n\nRocke Gabrielsen II: He’s probably taken some days off. Who wouldn’t?\n\nAdmiral Bang: I will immediately send the Royal Navy north… I mean south… In all directions!\n\nHe launches rockets and loses his monocle. The rockets shoot the chandelier and it drops down into the water.\n\nAdjudant Hoff: Admiral Bang. It is important to keep our low profiles out of sight. We don’t want a scandal. [looks to Rocke] I’m sure he iz in Rofoten.\n\nRocke grins smugly.\n\nAdmiral Bang: Let’s send Captain Gunpowder. She is our best man. I mean he is our best woman. She has shown unrivalled disobedience…\n\nHoff and Rocke glare at each other appalled.\n\nAdmiral Bang: [cont’d] I mean decisiveness. I mean, she is courageous and strong. Gunpowder-strong! [chuckles] And she does exactly as I say!\n\nAdjudant Hoff: Oui, Admiral Bang, but we also need someone with brains, non? Un peu d’intelligence, comprend? [beat] What about this Sinus?\n\nAdmiral Bang: Sinus could never work with Captain Gunpowder!\n\nAdjudant Hoff: How about a m’nage trois? A third boat could protect Sinus and communicate better with his captain.\n\nAs he speaks, Suverina looks at Elias approvingly. As he finishes, there’s a beat, then;\n\nSuverina: Come on. I know another exit.\n\nShe and Elias leave.\n\nAdjudant Hoff: But the Paparazzi must hear nothing!\n\nThe next day, the Paparazzi stand outside the mansion until Hoff comes out.\n\nUno: Hey, there he is, the old fart.\n\nThe guffawing-cunningly Paparazzi sail in front of Hoff.\n\nTre: Any news?\n\nDue: Where is the Royal Yacht?\n\nUno: We have inside information from a reliable source that the Royal Yacht has a little sailboat on the side.\n\nDue: Any comment, honorable Adjudant?\n\nUno: Or is it. [pause] Arrogant?\n\nAdjudant Hoff is irked. The Paparazzi just laugh.\n\nDue: Or Elephant?\n\nTre: Or kangaroo!? [the laughing stops, beat] Does the Princess Boat’s shipwreck have anything to do with this story?\n\nAdjudant Hoff: Absolutely not. Have you lost your minds?\n\nUno: The people are entitled to the truth, Aspirant.\n\nAdjudant Hoff: Za Royal Yacht’s vacation has gone a tad longer zan expected.\n\nThe Paparazzi close in\n\nAdjudant Hoff: Must I spill it out to you?\n\nPaparazzi: Ooooooooo…\n\nThey close in more.\n\nDue: You aren’t acting very wisely now, old driftwood.\n\nUno: You wouldn’t want your reputation tarnished, would you?\n\nPaparazzi: [singing] You seem to forget who we are!\n\nTre: Absent-minded old fool!\n\nDue: You won’t get away that easy.\n\nSong: The Knights of the Free Word - The Paparazzi represent knights and angels in fantasy before recording Adjudant Hoff as he backs off, defended by the Guards.\n\nThe Paparazzi leave guffawing.\n\nAdjudant Hoff: Are those snoops gone?\n\nSuverina and a reluctant Elias approach the Royal Harbor.\n\nSuverina: Come on, Elias. This is your big chance.\n\nThey meet Hoff.\n\nSuverina: Hello, Adjudant, meet my new buddy, Elias. He’s a rescue boat.\n\nAdjudant Hoff: You have a new body every… What was that you say, you said? A rescue boat?\n\nSuverina: A rescue boat. And he has some time to spare. Need any help around here?\n\nAdjudant Hoff: I say, zats something good of a coincidence, yes! I have za most exciting mission for you.\n\nElias: But…\n\nSuverina nudges him.\n\nElias: Cool!\n\nIn the Hall, Elias and Gunpowder are having their mission detailed by Admiral Bang.\n\nAdmiral Bang: Attention! Captain Gunpowder will be the commander of Operation Whoopity Doo. And you will lie under her. I mean ‘be’ under her, ‘command’. Is that clear?\n\nElias: Yes, sir!\n\nGunpowder looks at him seemingly disdainfully.\n\nAdmiral Bang: The Adjutant believes the Royal Yacht is in Rofoten. But we have received information that the Royal Yacht may be…\n\nHoff gives him an annoyed look.\n\nAdmiral Bang: [cont’d] Anyway, Operation Whoopity Doo. See to it that the Royal Yacht is here to greet his subordinates on Coast Day.\n\nGunpowder: Affirmative, Admiral Bang. We shall initiate ASAP. We are waiting for Sinus.\n\nAdjudant Hoff: He should be here any moment. Make sure you keep the paparazzi…\n\nAdmiral Bang: Don’t worry. Captain Gunpowder has been informed of all unthinkable and… unthinkable… hostile… peaceful… top secret…\n\nAs he speaks, Sinus pushes past focusing on his screen. When Bang notices he’s heading for the wall, his monocle flies off.\n\nAdmiral Bang: Civilian, look out!\n\nElias jumps in and hooks onto Sinus. Stopping him.\n\nSinus: Perfect! Yes! A new high score!\n\nGunpowder: Civilian Sinus, I will have no computer games during our operation! Understood?\n\nSinus: (nervously) Yes, Captain Gunpowder. My apologies for the late arrival. I had trouble with my display. My operative system crashed because my drivers weren’t… compatible.\n\nAdmiral Bang: The search for the Royal Yacht will begin immediately!\n\nGunpowder: Forward sail!\n\nShe, Elias and Sinus leave the Royal Harbor.\n\nMeanwhile… Outside the Container Port. Rocke is meeting up with the Paparazzi.\n\nRocke Gabrielsen II: Know what I think? The Royal Yacht is losing his marbles. The Adjutant thinks he’s in Rofoten searching for the Princess Boat! [laughs] Our old monarch is going senile!\n\nDue: What a lovely scandal.\n\nUno: A full menu… With desert.\n\nTre: And right before Coast Day.\n\nRocke Gabrielsen II: Make sure you find his Royal Senility as soon as possible.\n\nUno: We’ll squeeze him like a blood orange.\n\nDue: We are the “press” after all.\n\nRocke Gabrielsen II: This will be the scoop of the century.\n\nDue: You have a gigantic nose… for news.\n\nUno: A nose like a blood clot. I mean a bloodhound.\n\nRocke Gabrielsen II: But no one must ever find out that you heard this from me!\n\nDue: Of course not. We always protect our sources.\n\nUno: Especially when our source owns us.\n\nThe laughing Paparazzi leave.\n\nRocke Gabrielsen II: This means the end of monarchy. [chuckles] And guess who will be the country’s first president!\n\nThe Operation Whoopity Doo party is currently crossing through Stormy Bay.\n\nGunpowder: Sitrep!\n\nSinus: Right! Situation report! [gets out his screen] We are at 66 degrees, 27 minutes and 2 seconds north. 12 degrees, 56 minutes and 34 seconds east. The wind is NNW at force 6, which equals 11.7 meteors per second.\n\nGunpowder: Prepare to cross Stormy Bay!\n\nElias: We should stay close to the shore in this wind.\n\nGunpowder: Have I asked you? You snotty little plastic tub? And you always refer to me as Captain Gunpowder!\n\nElias: [defeated] Yes, Captain Gunpowder.\n\nSinus: According to my calculations, the wind will increase to force 11. Gusts up to 35.2 meters. Stronger then Hurricane Gertrude.\n\nGunpowder: Get out of here!\n\nSinus: Thank you.\n\nGunpowder: I didn’t mean that literally! Get to the point.\n\nA wave almost causes Sinus to roll over.\n\nSinus: [standing up] My conclusion is that it would be most irresponsible, borderline insanity, to attempt a crossing under these conditions.\n\nGunpowder: We are to locate the Royal Yacht as quickly as possible.\n\nSinus: But Captain…\n\nGunpowder: If you civilians are chicken, fine!\n\nLeaving Elias and Sinus, Gunpowder heads through some very fierce and horrific waves, mirroring Rocke in the beginning of the film. Meanwhile, Elias and Sinus are heading near the shore.\n\nElias: She risks going down in this weather!\n\nSinus: There is a 73.2% chance that we will also go down.\n\nA wave almost tips him. Elias throws his hook to his bow and pulls him to safety.\n\nSinus: 98.7%!\n\nMeanwhile, Gunpowder becomes confound before disappearing in the shadow of a massive wave.\n\nElias has gotten Sinus to a cove, where the current is more gentle.\n\nSinus: Thank you, Elias. I wouldn’t have made it without you.\n\nElias: I wonder how Captain Gunpowder is.\n\nSinus: She’s fine. She defies all kinds of weather.\n\nElias: I’m not so sure. I need to go search for her.\n\nSinus: What about me?\n\nElias: Wait here. I’m be back.\n\nSinus: Are you sure?\n\nElias searches the stormy sea. Eventually, he finds that she has run aground on a reef.\n\nElias: Gunpowder. What happened?\n\nGunpowder: Forget something?\n\nElias: Captain Gunpowder.\n\nGunpowder: Yes, exactly! No reason to drop formalities just because of some high seas.\n\nElias: Okay. I’ll get you down, Captain Gunpowder.\n\nAt first, Gunpowder barely moves. Then, she slides back into the ocean, though she ignores Elias.\n\nThe next day, the current is calm as they as they sail by tons of mountains and cliffs.\n\nGunpowder: Halt! We are approaching Rofoten. The Royal Yacht should be nearby. Before we start, I have something to tell you, civilian Elias. At first I couldn’t understand why you were on this mission. But now I can’t comprehend what I would do without you, Elias. So from now on, you can just call me Gunpowder.\n\nElias: Roger, Captain Gunpowder.\n\nSinus: Roger, Just Gunpowder. What am I saying? Just Gunpowder? Only Gunpowder, right?\n\nGunpowder: Ready for action? Initiate the search for the Royal Yacht!\n\nSong - We’re On Our Way - Mirror antics for and between Elias, Gunpowder and Sinus. Ends with Elias getting Sinus’ glasses from a Paralithodes Camtschatica.\n\nSinus: The king crab, Paralithodes Camtschatica, is new to our fauna. We should eat it before it eats us. Just drop it in a large kettle and serve with lemon slices, mayonnaise and French bread.\n\nBack at the Royal Harbor at night, Bang, Hoff and Rocke are cruising in the mansion.\n\nAdmiral Bang: Unfortunately, they have yet to find the Royal Yacht. But Captain Gunpowder reports that they are cooperating magnificently. Particularly thanks to Elias.\n\nRocke Gabrielsen II: Elias?\n\nAdjudant Hoff: Mais oui. Elias the Rescue Boat.\n\nRocke Gabrielsen II: (livid) What?! That cunning little- [restrains himself and laughs out loud]\n\nA puzzled Bang loses his monocle.\n\nRocke Gabrielsen II: I heard that Elias had been fired.\n\nAdjudant Hoff and Admiral Bang look at each other - coldy.\n\nBack to the Operation Whoopity Doo party resting under a hill. Gunpowder leaves a sleeping Sinus to join Elias in watching the horizon.\n\nElias: Gunpowder, I was wondering…\n\nGunpowder: About what?\n\nElias: Admiral Bang mumbled something about the Royal Yacht. What was that about?\n\nGunpowder: It’s the Princess Boat. The Royal Yacht was devastated. Losing someone dear to you, Elias, it can be terribly difficult.\n\nMood is ruined by the chipper text sound from Sinus’ computer.\n\nSinus: A message from the Royal Harbour.\n\nGunpowder: Yes?\n\nSinus: Let me decode it first. [types] It was… just some spam.\n\nGunpowder: [closing in] What?\n\nSinus: (nervous) Never mind… It was nothing. Just a filofax… a faulty fax… Someone wanted to buy lottery tickets, I mean sell, I mean…\n\nGunpowder gets out her rocket launchers.\n\nGunpowder: [cont'd] Who was that message from? Answer me!\n\nSinus: [slowly] From the Royal Harbor.\n\nGunpowder: What does it say?\n\nSinus hits the edge.\n\nSinus: Water samples! What a fool! I forgot to take water samples!\n\nGunpowder: Sinus, come here! Forget those samples.\n\nSinus looks in defeat.\n\nGunpowder: Elias, you wait there!\n\nThe two get a distance away.\n\nMeanwhile, the chatting and laughing Paparazzi are not far behind them.\n\nGunpowder is enraged talking to Sinus. She charges at the unknowing Elias.\n\nGunpowder: We have received a message from the Royal Harbor. I had every reason to be skeptical about you.\n\nElias: What… What do you mean?\n\nGunpowder gets out her launchers.\n\nGunpowder: You withheld information that you were recruited! Elias, honor and loyalty is something I value tremendously! What you have done is a betrayal of the worst kind! You betrayed the country. You betrayed the Royal Yacht. You are discharged from Operation Whoopity Doo. Effective immediately!\n\nGunpowder storms off, leaving Elias devastated.\n\nSinus: But Gunpowder…\n\nGunpowder: No questions from you! I refuse to drag along some impostor!\n\nSinus: Elias, I…\n\nBeat. Sinus turns to follow Gunpowder.\n\nSinus: I’m sorry.\n\nSong - Lonely - An upset Elias sails through fjords.\n\nElias is moored at a run-down Port, still sad. A vessel, obscured by darkness, approaches.\n\nPassing Vessel: Good evening.\n\nElias: Hi.\n\nPassing Vessel: Is something wrong? You look sad.\n\nElias: No. Nothing.\n\nPassing Vessel: You can talk to me. Don’t worry.\n\nElias: It won’t help.\n\nPassing Vessel: I see. But after a long life as… I have learned that it helps to talk about things.\n\nElias: Everything has gone wrong.\n\nPassing Vessel: Yes?\n\nElias: [sighs] I wanted to be like Fearless. But I don’t know what I am anymore.\n\nPassing Vessel: Fearless? He became a legendary rescue boat. But you can never be exactly like him.\n\nElias: What do you mean?\n\nPassing Vessel: Fantastic stories are told about Fearless are told time and again. Eventually we forget that he also was nothing but a regular boat.\n\nHe looks down. Beat.\n\nPassing Vessel: We are all. Just regular boats.\n\nBeat.\n\nPassing Vessel: We live our own lives. No two are the same. That is why you can’t be like Fearless.\n\nElias looks down.\n\nPassing Vessel: I see you’re struggling now. Find a way to face your difficulties. Find your own strength. Your own way in life.\n\nBeat. Elias is still sad.\n\nPassing Vessel: It isn’t easy. But if you succeed, you will become a great rescue boat.\n\nElias: (a little motivated) Do you really think so?\n\nPassing Vessel: Yes. I do. I must move on. Farewell.\n\nThe vessel leaves.\n\nElias spends the night at the run-down Port. Then, when he awakens and heads out.\n\nThe Paparazzi arrive at the Port. Sniffing ironically.\n\nDue: I smell a hot story.\n\nUno: We’re on the verge of a scoop.\n\nThey laugh.\n\nTre: Imagine the headline: “Senile Sovereign Spotted by Seashore.”\n\nUno: Not bad. Or how about: “The King may come” And on Page 2: “Or not… Since he’s… senile!”\n\nThey laugh and continue their search.\n\nDue: “Senile With a Smile!”\n\nThe vessel that spoke to Elias is in fact the Royal Yacht wearing a fake moustache and regular searchlights instead of his crown. He is standing near the Black Current; a whirlpool.\n\nElias follows two great cormorants and find the Royal Yacht.\n\nElias: Excuse me. The current here can be dangerous. Do you need help?\n\nThe Royal Yacht: You again? No, I’m fine. I’ve been here before. But thank you.\n\nHe sneezes off his moustache.\n\nThe Royal Yacht: Oh no! My disguise!\n\nElias: You’re the Royal Yacht! But, Your Majesty, why are you in disguise?\n\nThe Royal Yacht: Because of the paparazzi. If they write that I’m still looking for my daughter… Everyone will think I’ve lost my mind.\n\nElias: I’m so sorry about the Princess Boat.\n\nThe Royal Yacht: They say I have to face the truth. What truth? That she vanished here in the Black Current?\n\nBeat.\n\nThe Royal Yacht: I don’t think she went down. I’m going to find my daughter! No matter how long it might take!\n\nElias: I’ll help you, Your Majesty, as sure as my name is Elias!\n\nThe Royal Yacht: Would you really do that? First give me my disguise back.\n\nElias nods.\n\nThe Royal Yacht: First give me my disguise back.\n\nElias puts the moustache back on.\n\nThe Paparazzi catch up and spot them sailing on the other side of the fjord.\n\nTre: It’s the Royal Yacht!\n\nThey race towards them. Meanwhile, Trawler is fishing by the shore.\n\nPaparazzi: We have a story! / No doubt about that!\n\nThe Blue and Red Dinghies avoid Trawler’s net. A cautious Trawler reduces speed, creasing the size of the gap between him and his net, causing Due is crash into the net and lose all of the caught fish.\n\nTrawler: What in burning bacalao are you doing?!\n\nIn a fit of rage, Trawler chases the Paparazzi down the fjord, swinging his hook.\n\nTrawler: No one gets away from Trawler!\n\nHe catches Due. Uno and Tre catch up to Elias and the Royal Yacht.\n\nTre: Who in the world are you?\n\nThe fake moustache is loose. The Uno knocks it off it’s place with his megaphone.\n\nTre: It’s the Royal Yacht! I knew it!\n\nBefore they can do anything, Trawler grabs him and throws them into his cargo deck.\n\nTrawler: I’ll teach you blabberboats some manners!\n\nThey go their separate ways.\n\nUno: You’re impeding the free word!\n\nOther: [protest]\n\nTrawler: Shut up!\n\nFADE TO BLACK.\n\nCUT TO: A fog comes down, Elias and the Royal Yacht find a cave.\n\nElias: Your Majesty?\n\nThe Royal Yacht: We can seek refuge in this cave over here.\n\nThey go in.\n\nThe Royal Yacht: We can wait here until the fog lifts.\n\nAs they look around, they suddenly hear a female chorus.\n\nBeat. Light coming from the holes above become warner.\n\nThe Royal Yacht: (emotionally) Elias, we have found my daughter!\n\nElias: It’s coming from over there. Look! An opening, under water!\n\nElias goes to it. Beat.\n\nGunpowder: (o.s.) Halt!\n\nGunpowder and Sinus have arrived.\n\nGunpowder: Your Majesty, I am the commander of Operation Whoopity Doo. Admiral Bang has ordered me to bring you…\n\nAt the sight of Elias. Gunpowder explodes and aims her launchers at him again.\n\nGunpowder: You impostor!\n\nThe Royal Yacht: Elias is no impostor.\n\nGunpowder: I’m have you court-martialled for this!\n\nThe Royal Yacht: We have just found the Princess Boat.\n\nGunpowder: [aloofly stunned] She went down in the Black Current.\n\nThe Royal Yacht: [annoyed] But listen!\n\nGunpowder: Ahem... The Royal Navy has combed every centiliter of these waters. The Princess Boat is gone for good.\n\nThe Royal Yacht: No! She is not gone. If you want to follow orders, be prepared to use your weapons!\n\nThe chorus returns.\n\nThe Royal Yacht: Listen, Captain.\n\nThey all listen. Sinus records it.\n\nGunpowder: It… It’s can’t be! It is the Princess Boat. Your Majesty, I’ll get us to the Princess Boat!\n\nThe Royal Yacht frantically clears as she launches rockets at the opening.\n\nGunpowder: Sinus, hold on to your glasses!\n\nThe convey sail through the widened opening. As Sinus sails through, rocks fall, one destroying his telecommunication.\n\nSinus: There went our communication!\n\nThey are in the Island’s lake. The water is bright blue. As they look around, Sinus notices a loose boulder above the opening.\n\nElias turns a corner and Princess; a small, pink boat sails into sight.\n\nPrincess: Who are you?\n\nElias: Elias.\n\nShe spots the Royal Yacht.\n\nPrincess: Daddy!\n\nThe Royal Yacht: My little girl! It is you. It really is you!\n\nThey reunite.\n\nPrincess: I thought I’d never see you again.\n\nThe Royal Yacht: My little Princess. My darling. I can’t believe it. Everyone was sure you were at the bottom of the sea.\n\nElias: Except you, Your Majesty. You never gave up hope.\n\nGunpowder joins in.\n\nThe Royal Yacht: [laughs] True. I never could have done it without you. Let’s go home!\n\nSinus comes over.\n\nSinus: I’m afraid we have a problem. The opening caved in.\n\nBeat.\n\nSinus: And I can no longer call for help. Help…\n\nElias: How did you get in, Your Highness.\n\nPrincess: I’ll show you.\n\nShe leads the convey to another cave. As they enter;\n\nPrincess: [cont’d] Beware of the current.\n\nIn the corner of the cave is another whirlpool.\n\nSinus: [studying] The Black Current.\n\nThe Royal Yacht: So this is where it ends. [pauses] Incredible!\n\nElias: What happened?\n\nPrincess: I lost Daddy in the fog. Couldn’t see a thing. I drove around, crying out. Suddenly, I was sucked under water, deeper and deeper. The last thing I remember was… [sobbing] A terrible creature with arms everywhere and huge eyes! When I awoke, I was in here.\n\nThe Royal Yacht: I see. So the Black Current did get you, like everyone said. Yet here you are. It’s a miracle!\n\nSinus is studying.\n\nSinus: [cont’d] Well spoke, Your Majesty. Miracle is the word. No one has ever survived a similar experience.\n\nSky view of both ends of the Black Current. Sinus takes a sample of the water. The typing and sounds on his computer take awhile and eventually annoy Gunpowder.\n\nGunpowder: Stop that Sinus! You’re driving me crazy!\n\nSinus: Yes, yes!\n\nGunpowder: Stop it!\n\nSinus: Yes! This is… maybe… a way out of here. Listen up. The current turns with the tide twice a day. In order to escape, we must follow the current. The problem is that the undercurrents will drag us down. But according to my calculations, under special circumstances, a unique phenomenon may occur. Just what you experienced, Your Highness.\n\nGunpowder: [apathetic] Get to the point, Sinus.\n\nSinus: [interrupting] This phenomenon, The Princess Syndrome, sucks you down to a certain depth, but then it pulls up and out on the other side. [excited] And best of all, the Princess Syndrome, should occur again the next time the tide turns!\n\nSinus: The Princess Syndrome will occur in 30 seconds.\n\nHe gets out the timer on his computer.\n\nSinus: Captain Gunpowder?\n\nGunpowder: Right. Line up in the formation that I agreed upon.\n\nThe convey lines up. The timer runs out. The tide turns. Sinus and Gunpowder charge for the whirlpool.\n\nGunpowder: Full steam ahead!\n\nPrincess watches horrified as they are sucked in.\n\nElias: Come on!\n\nPrincess: But the monster!\n\nElias: We have to hurry! This is our only chance!\n\nVery reluctantly, Princess charges at the whirlpool ahead of Elias and is sucked through a cave. She is trapped between the wall and a column. Elias hooks onto her.\n\nCUT TO: Gunpowder and Sinus get spat out into the open sea.\n\nSinus: The current could turn any second! We have to get away.\n\nCUT TO: The cave. A huge boulder floats rapidly towards Elias and Princess. Elias tugs harder. The boulder takes out the column trapping Princess and others. Elias and Princess escape and float to the surface - as a limb moves nearby. Elias and Princess are spat out.\n\nPrincess: Where is daddy?\n\nSinus: Get over here! The tide is turning!\n\nBeat. Gunpowder has a solemn reaction, Princess is becoming devastated. Then Elias heads back to the whirlpool.\n\nGunpowder: That… That’s madness!\n\nPart of the Royal Yacht’s bowsprit floats to the surface, horrifying Elias.\n\nElias: Shoot a line over here!\n\nGunpowder shoots a line and Elias catches it. He heads into the whirlpool. The Royal Yacht is sinking, then Elias comes and throws Gunpowder’s hook onto his railing.\n\nElias is sucked down and eventually picked up by a giant octopus.\n\nThe others wait for Elias, a little sad.\n\nThe Royal Yacht: Elias… You rescued my Princess and you rescued me. But you yourself were lost. You sacrificed yourself, brave little rescue boat.\n\nUnderwater, the octopus fiddles with Elias. A drowning Elias sees some wrecks surrounding the creature and horrified, has flashbacks of Fearless’ portrait, Rocke berating him for the first time, his second dismissal, and meeting the Royal Yacht at the run-down Port.\n\nSiggy: (v.o.) Might as well call you Fearful!\n\nRocke Gabrielsen II: (v.o.) Elias is no longer a rescue boat!\n\nThe Royal Yacht: …your own way in life.\n\nSuverina: (v.o.) This is your big chance!\n\nElias picks up the boulder from before and throws it in the creature’s face, making it let him go.\n\nThe Royal Yacht: Find your own strength…\n\nHis body floats up to the surface.\n\nThe Royal Yacht: Come, my Princess. There’s nothing more we can do.\n\nBeat.\n\nPrincess: Look!\n\nElias’ body comes to the surface. Gunpowder and Sinus return, the former throws her line on him before he sinks and pulls him to safety.\n\nPrincess checks on the body.\n\nPrincess: Elias?\n\nShe pulls alongside and nudging her head on Elias’, she sobs. Gunpowder, Sinus and the Royal Yacht are devastated as well.\n\nPrincess: Elias!\n\nElias coughs.\n\nPrincess: What? Elias! Elias, you’re alive!\n\nElias smiles broadly at Sinus, Gunpowder and Princess, who does so towards the Royal Yacht.\n\nCUT TO: The Royal Harbor. It’s Coast Day. Thousands of boats are watching, including almost all of the boats from Cozy Cove and some from the Container Port.\n\nAdjudant Hoff and Admiral Bang come out. The guards sound their trumpets as the Royal Yacht with his crown and Princess appear on the mansion’s balcony. The Paparazzi are documenting. The crowd is cheering.\n\nThe Royal Yacht: Dear everyone… Being here today, with my Princess at my side… It hardly feels real. It’s surreal. But without the help of some special friends, we never would have experienced this.\n\nElias, Gunpowder and Sinus come out of the mansion - cheered on.\n\nThe Royal Yacht: [cont’d] Each of these brave boats have contributed to this moment. Captain Gunpowder found a way to the Princess Boat. And Sinus found the way out.\n\nThe Paparazzi take pictures and record.\n\nThe Royal Yacht: And then… Elias.\n\nElias looks at the crowd. A proud Smacky and Suverina look at each other.\n\nThe Royal Yacht: Without you, none of us would be here today. Elias… You risked your life and the Princess and for me. I remember when I was young and inexperienced, being saved by the legendary Fearless. But, my dear friends, Elias’ feat in the Black Current surpasses it all.\n\nMove out.\n\nCUT TO: That evening, Elias and Princess cruise in the hallway.\n\nElias: Time for me to head back to Cozy Cove.\n\nPrincess: You are always welcome here.\n\nElias: Thank you.\n\nAs Elias and Princess look at each other, Elias notices;\n\nElias: Swiftly! There you are!\n\nSwiftly has got past the Guards. He jumps in front of Elias excitedly.\n\nElias: There, there, Swiftly!\n\nPrincess: He’s so cute!\n\nElias: Behave yourself, now. You’re in the Royal Harbor after all. [to Princess] Bye for now.\n\nPrincess: Thanks again.\n\nElias and Swiftly leave.\n\nPrincess: See you later!\n\nElias and Swiftly sail into the sunset.\n\nCredits\n\nAbrupt cut to the guards throwing Rocke out of the Royal Harbor, following by a furious Royal Yacht.\n\nThe Royal Yacht: Don’t ever show yourself around here again!\n\nHe heads back inside. The guffawing Paparazzi is taking photographs and recording, their intentions are clear as day.\n\nRocke Gabrielsen II: If you print this in the paper, so help me, I’ll have you melted into bedpans!\n\nPaparazzi: (ironically) Oh no, bedpans!\n\nThey just laugh.\n\nRest of Credits\n\n'"
