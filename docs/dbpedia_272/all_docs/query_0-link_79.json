This investment will support Oui Care and its management in this new stage of development.\n\nFounded in the early 2000s, Oui Care is the leading personal and household services provider in France. As a multi-specialist, Oui Care covers all customers’ needs at home with a full range of services ranging from household to house cleaning services, childcare to senior and disabled care, and small to major repair works and gardening, for the benefit of more than 100,000 families. Oui Care is one of the largest recruiters in its sector, bringing together a huge task force of 18,000 employees in France, Spain, Portugal and Mexico. Since 2013, Oui Care has made six key acquisitions to expand its footprint into new geographical areas and complete its portfolio of services.\n\nCreated in 2004, CAPZA is an established European private investment platform. The company is majority-owned by its teams and supported by the AXA Group. With US$5.7 billion of assets, CAPZA offers a platform of six complementary areas of expertise: flex equity, private debt, transition3, artemid senior loans4, growth tech and mid-cap expansion. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, CAPZA has been entrusted by AXA with a US$605 million fund to enable SMEs to strengthen their balance sheets and recover from the shock after the implementation of emergency measures.\n\nRAISE Impact is an impact investment structure developed within the RAISE Group. The fund is focused on supporting ambitious projects that are likely to bring about significant, or even systemic, changes in our lifestyles, production methods and consumer behavior. The fund’s purpose is to invest in mission-driven companies and firms in the process of transformation that are committed to creating a more sustainable future and a society built on greater solidarity. RAISE Impact is a signatory to the IFC’s Operating Principles for Impact Management and its France 2i fund has been awarded the “Relance” label.\n\nOaklins’ team in France acted as financial advisor to Oui Care in this transaction.\n\nParties\n\n“This financial transaction is fully in line with Oui Care’s ambition to become the world leader in personal and household services in 15 years. Oaklins’ team was key in structuring the financing; their perfect understanding of our strategy and their strong involvement was decisive in securing this transaction which, at the same time, enabled us to refinance the group’s debt in a market that was shaken by COVID-19. Oui Care is now ready to strongly accelerate its development in France and abroad.”\n\nGuillaume Richard\n\nCEO and Founder, Oui Care Group\n\nRelated deals\n\nRoyal Reesink has sold Motrac Industries to Anders Invest\n\nPrivate Equity | Industrial Machinery & Components\n\nRoyal Reesink has sold Motrac Industries to Anders Invest\n\nRoyal Reesink and Anders Invest have completed the sale of Motrac Industries, a specialist in hydraulic and electrical engineering.\n\nLearn more\n\nManagement and founders of Sansidor have successfully invested alongside IK Partners\n\nPrivate Equity | Business Support Services\n\nManagement and founders of Sansidor have successfully invested alongside IK Partners\n\nIK Partners has signed an agreement to invest in Sansidor, a fast-growing testing, inspection and related services provider.
