T The time to wait T is the amount of time which the server 402 should wait before

the server 402 by the client 404 in a step 606. Based on the time to wait T, the server 402

the server 402 send rate is set to a multiple of the time to wait T, such as, for example, the server 402 send rate is set to about 110% of the time to wait
