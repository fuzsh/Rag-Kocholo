Instead, AOE is requesting that the state agency be allowed to notify the Health Department of SFSP site locations on behalf of the sponsors.

USDA previously granted this waiver to AOE for the period of May 26, 2020 to August 31, 2020 and October 1, 2020 - September 30, 2021. This request is for the period of February 1, 2022 – September 30, 2022. – Granted March 4, 2022.

The proposed rule would allow National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and School Breakfast Program (SBP) operators to permanently offer flavored, low-fat milk as part of a reimbursable meal, allow for half of the weekly grains to be whole grain-rich, and provide schools more time for gradual sodium reduction by retaining Sodium Target 1 through the end of school year (SY) 2023-2024, continuing to Target 2 in SY 2024-2025, and eliminating the Final Target.

Instead, AOE is requesting that the state agency be allowed to notify the Health Department of SFSP site locations on behalf of the sponsors. This is part of an effort to reduce the burden on the Department of Health, which is particularly critical during the current pandemic. USDA previously granted this waiver to AOE for the period of May 26, 2020 to August 31, 2020. This request is for the period of October 1, 2020 - September 30, 2021. – Granted December 23, 2020 and remains in effect until September 30, 2021.\n\nVermont Waiver Request to USDA to Allow Flexibility of State Agency and Sponsor Monitoring Requirements during Fiscal Year 2020-2021\n\nThe State Agency is seeking waivers of numerous monitoring requirements at both the state agency and sponsor level. As part of our response to COVID-19, the state has received numerous nationwide and state-specific waivers from USDA that allow programs to be operated very differently from usual. Because of these waivers, and the unique way that programs are currently operating, many of the usual monitoring requirements do not make sense. The state agency seeks to alleviate the burden of these requirements on the state agency and on sponsors and proposes an alternative monitoring plan to ensure that program integrity, food safety, and other critical components of the programs are continuing to be followed during this unique and difficult time. – Granted on March 31, 2021.

This waiver would allow SFAs to use the SFSP meal pattern if more appropriate to their needs, and would also allow SFAs to use the NSLP/SBP meal pattern instead of the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) Meal Pattern for meals served to non-co-mingled Pre-K students. The State agency is seeking to simplify operations as much as possible for SFAs during School Year 2020-2021 as meal service will be vastly different compared to normal operations. - Deemed unnecessary as a result of the extension that was granted by USDA on October 9, 2020 of the “Nationwide Waiver to Allow Meal Pattern Flexibility in the Child Nutrition Programs”.

This will allow children to have continued access to meals until the school year begins. The current nationwide waiver for non-congregate feeding in the SFSP extends until August 31, 2020 with the intention that schools will re-open for school year 2020-2021 by September 1, 2020.

This will allow children to have continued access to meals until school year begins and school meals are provided, and allow programs to maintain social distancing efforts to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The current nationwide waiver for parent and guardian pick-up of meals in SFSP extends until August 31, 2020 with the intention that schools will re-open for school year 2020-2021 by September 1, 2020.

Bulk distribution of food items (i.e. a loaf of bread and jar of peanut butter, instead of 5 sandwiches.) would allow Program operators to provide households with the necessary food items to meet meal pattern compliance in the required portion sizes, limiting the additional work needed to prepare unitized meals. This would also reduce the amount of time food service staff spend in close contact with one another, to maintain the health and safety of foodservice personnel during unanticipated school and center closures due to COVID-19. - Deemed unnecessary as a result of the Q&As that were released by USDA on April 11, 2020, indicating the allowance of offering meals in this fashion.\n\nWaiver related to serving meals during previously scheduled Breaks occurring during an Unanticipated School Closure\n\nThe Vermont Agency of Education is seeking a waiver of USDA guidance requiring schools to “cancel” their previously scheduled breaks and holidays in order to allow continuous meal service during an unexpected school closure.
