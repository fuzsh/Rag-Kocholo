        "text": "Emily Kies, Emergency Preparedness Coordinator, Illinois\n\n“I have gained a great network of experiences to draw upon in a variety of fields. I have gained a greater insight into the challenges that other EM’s face, and possible solutions. I have implemented pieces of an Emergency Management Program, but haven’t gotten a solid handle on the Program as a whole, I feel like the Academy has given me the tools to take the pieces of the program and bring them together and fill the gaps”\n\nEmily Kies, Emergency Preparedness Coordinator, Illinois\n\n“Most definitely, I think every disaster or incident I have participated in has a component that has correlated from the training from the Academy. Actually I just got a phone call today from the State to be a part of the committee to assist in implementing updates and changes for the Administrative Code that we operate under. I was just thinking about how the Change Management course as well as the individuals that are state coordinators would be really beneficial moving forward in this project. I didn’t attend Basic Academy, so I will have to keep you posted”\n\nNancy Carter, Basic Academy graduate (Edgewood Chemical Biological Center, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD)\n\n“The instructors provided during the Basic Academy were the best resource of this course. The mix of local emergency management personnel, and those who have worked at a state and federal level gave the class the benefit of learning from their first-hand experience but by also being able to relate to situations they had dealt with. The instructors also had a chance to learn from us, since we deal with some very specific high hazard areas in chemical and biological defense. It was a great interaction all around”\n\nEric Stevens - Basic Academy graduate (U.S. Army Test and Evaluation Command, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD)\n\n“The Basic Academy curriculum is some of the best training that I have received during my government career. Beyond the applicability to my duties, the training offered a unique opportunity to network with other emergency management personnel in the region and to learn from seasoned emergency managers with a wealth of experience at the Federal, state, and local levels. The value of the instructors' real-world experience and ability to apply that experience in the learning environment cannot be overstated”\n\nTom Tarrants, Preparedness Specialist, U.S. Coast Guard Fifth District\n\n“The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) has placed tremendous value in the FEMA EMI training programs. The USCG has incorporated EMI Independent Study courses into mandated training for all personnel, emergency management related certifications and qualifications and as prerequisites for some Coast Guard resident training courses. In addition, the Coast Guard Headquarters Office of Contingency Preparedness and Exercise Policy (CG-CPE) provides funding for personnel assigned specific types of duties to attend career enhancing training at EMI. In addition, some District offices are doing the same at their level.”\n\n“Several highlights are identified below.”\n\n“The IS-100, IS-700, and IS-800 courses are Mandated Training for all Coast Guard personnel, military and civilian. Additionally, many other IS courses are required training for mid-level and higher personnel.”\n\n“The Response Officer Specialty Competency Contingency Preparedness Specialist (OAR-18) requires the completion of EMI training courses to obtain the Apprentice, Journeyman and Master level certification.”\n\n“– Apprentice level requires Homeland Security Exercise and Evaluation Program (HSEEP) (K/L0146), IS-230, IS-235, and IS-453”\n\n“– Journeyman level requires IS-240, IS-241, IS-242, IS-454, IS457, IS-809, IS-810 and IS-820”\n\n“– Master level requires Master Exercise Practitioner Program (MEPP), IS-293, IS-775 and IS-860”\n\n“CG-CPE has funding set aside annually for personnel to attend the MEPP, National Emergency Management Advanced Academy (NEMAA), and National Emergency Management Executive Academy (NEMAA) and in the past has sponsored Coast Guard specific MEPP cohorts”"
