        "text": "Hot foods should be refrigerated as soon as possible within two hours after cooking. Food kept without temperature control allows the food to cool to the same temperature as the environment and allow harmful bacteria to grow. Don't keep food if it's been stored below 135F or above 41F for more than two hours. Each temperature scenario incurs different risks regarding the type of foodborne pathogens able to grow and the rate of growth likely to occur so don't taste test it, either. Even a small amount of contaminated food can cause illness.\n\nDate leftovers so they can be used within a safe time. Generally, they remain safe when properly refrigerated for three to five days. If in doubt, throw it out.\n\nAccording to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), food can be safe forever from a foodborne-illness standpoint - but if shelf-stable food has been on the shelf for an extended period of time, you might not want to eat it because the quality may not be good. In this case, a \"Best if Used By/Before\" date indicates when a product will be of best flavor or quality. Food quality deals with taste, texture, and nutritional value of food, it is not a purchase or safety date. A \"Sell-By\" date tells the store how long to display the product for sale for inventory management..\n\nFor example, freezer burn, rancidity, and food spoilage are all quality-related issues. The FDA does not require an expiration date for shelf-stable foods, since the storage time for these foods is a quality issue, not a food safety concern.\n\nMany health experts agree that using a process called irradiation can be an effective way to help reduce food-borne hazards and ensure that harmful organisms are not in the foods we buy. During irradiation, foods are exposed briefly to a radiant energy source such as gamma rays or electron beams within a shielded facility. Irradiation is not a substitute for proper food manufacturing and handling procedures. But the process, especially when used to treat meat and poultry products, can kill harmful bacteria, greatly reducing potential hazards.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration has approved irradiation of meat and poultry and allows its use for a variety of other foods, including fresh fruits and vegetables, and spices. The agency determined that the process is safe and effective in decreasing or eliminating harmful bacteria. Irradiation also reduces spoilage bacteria, insects and parasites, and in certain fruits and vegetables it inhibits sprouting and delays ripening. For example, irradiated strawberries stay unspoiled up to three weeks, versus three to five days for untreated berries.\n\nFood irradiation is allowed in nearly 40 countries and is endorsed by the World Health Organization, the American Medical Association and many other organizations.\n\nIrradiation does not make foods radioactive, just as an airport luggage scanner does not make luggage radioactive. Nor does it cause harmful chemical changes. The process may cause a small loss of nutrients but no more so than with other processing methods such as cooking, canning, or heat pasteurization. Federal rules require irradiated foods to be labeled as such to distinguish them from non-irradiated foods.\n\nFor example, freezer burn, rancidity, and food spoilage are all quality-related issues. The FDA does not require an expiration date for shelf-stable foods, since the storage time for these foods is a quality issue, not a food safety concern.\n\nFood cannot be irradiated unless the Food and Drug Adminstration (FDA) approves it. The FDA has evaluated irradiation safety for 40 years and found the process safe and effective for many foods. Health experts also say that in addition to reducing E.coli O157:H7 contamination, irradiation can help control the potentially harmful bacteria Salmonella and Campylobacter, two chief causes of foodborne illness.\n\nIrradiation does not make food radioactive, compromise nutrional quality, or noticeably change the taste, texture, or appearance of food, as long as it's applied properly to a suitable product. It's important to note that irradiation cannot be used with all foods. For example, it causes undesirable flavor changes in dairy products and it causes tissue softening in some fruits, such as peaches and nectarines.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration has approved irradiation of meat and poultry and allows its use for a variety of other foods, including fresh fruits and vegetables, and spices.

The FDA does not require an expiration date for shelf-stable foods, since the storage time for these foods is a quality issue, not a food safety concern.\n\nOne of the critical factors in fighting food-borne illness is temperature. Bacteria grow slowly at low temperatures and multiply rapidly at mid-range temperatures. To be safe, a product must be cooked to an internal temperature high enough to destroy harmful bacteria. Using a thermometer is a reliable way to ensure that food has reached the proper temperature. However, to be effective, the thermometers must be used properly and calibrated correctly. If the thermometer is inserted incorrectly, or placed in the wrong area, the reading may not accurately reflect the internal temperature of the product. In general, the thermometer should be place in the thickest part of the food, away from bone, fat or gristle. Read the manufacturer's instructions on how to calibrate (check the accuracy of) the thermometer. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, temperature is the only way to guage whether food is sufficiently cooked. USDA research reveals that the 'color test' can give consumers misleading information about the safety of the foods they are preparing, since cooked color varies considerably. For example, freezing and thawing may influence a meat's tendency to brown prematurely.\n\nExample Problems:\n\nYour hot dog has a strip of plastic inside.\n\nThe canned chili contains a metal washer.\n\nYou think a restaurant dinner made you ill.\n\nA piece of glass was in your box of cereal.\n\nWhat can you do?\n\nFor help with meat, poultry and egg products: Call the toll-free USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline at 1 (800) 535-4555.\n\nFor help with restaurant food problems:\n\nCall the Health Department in your city, county or state. In Tulsa county, call (918) 595-4300.\n\nFor help with non-meat food products: For complaints about food products which do not contain meat or poultry - such as cereal - call or write to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Check your local phone book under U.S. Government, Health and Human Services, to find an FDA office in your area. The FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition can be reached at 1 (888) 723-3366.\n\nIn order for the USDA or FDA to investigate a problem, you should have:\n\nthe original container or packaging;\n\nthe foreign object (the plastic strip or metal washer, for example);\n\nand any uneaten portion of the food (refrigerate or freeze it).\n\nInformation you should be ready to tell the Hotline on the phone includes:\n\nyour name, address and phone number;\n\nthe brand name, product name and manufacturer of the product;\n\nthe size and package type;\n\ncan or package codes (not UPC bar codes) and dates;\n\nestablishment number (EST) usually found in the circle or shield near the \"USDA passed and inspected\" phrase; (if meat, poultry, or egg product)\n\nname and location of store and date you purchased the product.\n\nYou can complain to the store or the product's manufacturer if you don't choose to make a formal complaint to the USDA or FDA.\n\nIf you think you are ill, see a physician\n\nIf an injury or illness allegedly resulted from use of a meat or poultry product, you will also need to tell the Hotline staff about the type, symptoms, time of occurrence and name of attending health professional (if applicable).\n\nIf an injury or illness allegedly resulted from restaurant food, call your State or local Health Department.\n\nIf an injury or illness allegedly resulted from non-meat food products, call or write to the FDA.\n\nBottom line: If you sense there's a problem with any food product, don't consume it. \"When in doubt, throw it out.\"\n\nThe symptoms of food poisoning can vary greatly depending on the organism(s) causing the illness. There are actually two types of food poisoning: intoxication and infection.\n\nWith intoxication, the first or most predominate symptoms are upper gastrointestinal tract symptoms (nausea, vomiting) which occur shortly after ingestion of the contaminated food (2-24 hours).\n\nWith infection, the first or most predominate symptoms are lower gastrointestinal tract symptoms (abdominal cramps, diarrhea) which occur longer (6-36 hours up to several days) after ingestion. Other symptoms associated with food poisoning can include fever, chills, malaise, headache, and bloody diarrhea. Some organisms may cause neurological or allergic symptoms such as dizziness, blurred vision, puffiness, tingling, itching skin, burning throat and muscle aches.\n\nIn order to confirm food poisoning a doctor must run tests on blood, stool, and/or vomit to detect the presence of the organism. However, with many of the intoxication type of illnesses, the organism is not detectable. Food samples may also be checked to find the organism."
