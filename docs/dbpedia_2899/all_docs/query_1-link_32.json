        "text": "2.1 Application Process\n\nApplication Review\n\nJump to Section:\n\nApplicant Type\n\nPre-Award Risk Assessment\n\nDOJ High-Risk Grantee Designations\n\nAudit Issues\n\nVerification of Taxpayer Identification Number\n\nReview of Applicant Federal Debt\n\nConfirmation of Dun & Bradstreet Data Universal Numbering System Number\n\nConfirmation of Listing in System for Award Management\n\nDOJ awarding agencies are required to ensure that awards meet certain legislative, regulatory, and administrative requirements. This requires that each DOJ awarding agency review and assess each application to determine the following:\n\nThe applicant is eligible for the specified program.\n\nThe costs and activities in the application are for allowable, allocable, necessary, and reasonable costs.\n\nThe applicant possesses the responsibility, financial management, fiscal integrity, and financial capability to administer Federal funds adequately and appropriately.\n\nApplicant Type\n\nExamples of types of applicants include, but are not limited to:\n\nNonprofit organization ??? Some DOJ programs may require that an organization have 501(c)(3) status (as described in the U.S. Internal Revenue Code)\n\nFor-profit organization (including organizations designated as small businesses)\n\nState\n\nUnit of local government\n\nTribe\n\nInstitution of higher education\n\nCourts\n\nIndividuals (in limited circumstances)\n\n[ back to top ]\n\nPre-Award Risk Assessment\n\nDOJ is required to review and assess the potential risks presented by applicants for Federal grants prior to making an award (2 C.F.R. ?? 200.205). DOJ will use a variety of factors which may include financial capabilities and past performance in a risk-based approach. To facilitate part of the risk assessment, DOJ applicants (other than an individual) may be required to complete a questionnaire to assess their financial capability and submit it to DOJ before they can be approved for an award.\n\n[ back to top ]\n\nDOJ High-Risk Grantee Designations\n\nThe DOJ???s High-Risk Grantee Designation Policy was formally approved on January 6, 2012, and was adopted by its three primary grant-making components:?? the Office of Justice Programs (OJP), the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS Office), and the Office on Violence Against Women (OVW). OJP???s Office of Audit, Assessment, and Management (OAAM) is charged with administering the high-risk grantee process on behalf of DOJ. When an applicant is designated as high-risk by the OAAM, all DOJ grant-making components must consider the applicant as high-risk.\n\nThe purpose of the high-risk policy is to provide DOJ with a means of continuing to fund much needed criminal justice programs benefiting communities across the U.S., while maintaining proper stewardship of Federal funds and mitigating risk in the administration of DOJ-funded grant programs. It is important to note that high-risk grantees are not prohibited from applying for or receiving new awards from DOJ. However, high-risk grantees are managed and monitored closely, and any new awards these grantees receive are subject to additional restrictions, typically imposed through the inclusion of high-risk special conditions. Such conditions may be imposed not just at the beginning of a grant, but at any time throughout the period of the grant, if appropriate.\n\nIn general, a recipient may be designated as high-risk if any of the following apply to the recipient:\n\nHas a history of unsatisfactory performance;\n\nIs not financially stable;\n\nHas a management system that does not meet the standards set forth in ??2 C.F.R. Part 200 (Subpart D-Post Federal Award Requirements (Standards for Financial and Program Management));\n\nHas not conformed to the terms and conditions of previous awards; or\n\nIs otherwise not responsible.\n\nUnder DOJ???s policy, recipients may be designated as high-risk automatically, or as a result of a referral to OAAM from sources such as a DOJ grant-making component or other federal grant-making organization.\n\nHigh-risk referrals can be made by any DOJ personnel who works with grants, and can result from a wide variety of reasons, including, but not limited to:\n\nissues identified during grant programmatic or financial monitoring reviews, budget reviews, financial capability reviews, etc.;\n\nconcerns noted during the routine administration of grants;\n\naudits/investigative issues;\n\ncomplaints by recipient personnel, third parties, and/or the media, etc.\n\nAutomatic high-risk designations are made by DOJ if any of the following conditions apply:\n\nRecipient has audit reports with recommendation(s) that have been open for more than one year, and has not submitted documentation adequate to close the recommendation(s).\n\nRecipient has not provided a corrective action plan to the DOJ within 105 days of transmission of the audit report to the recipient.\n\nRecipient has audit reports with questioned costs in excess of $500,000 (regardless of the amount of time the audit report has been open).\n\nRecipient has been referred to the Department of Treasury for collection because of their failure to timely repay funds owed on a DOJ award.\n\nRecipient has been placed on the COPS Office Restricted Grantees List due to non-compliance with a previous COPS award(s).\n\nRecipient has been recommended for government-wide suspension or debarment by a DOJ office or component.\n\nIf high-risk grantees do not comply with the additional conditions/restrictions imposed, or fail to make timely progress in addressing the issues that resulted in their high-risk designation, DOJ can consider more substantial sanctions, such as:?? freezing funds on current DOJ awards; termination of existing awards; barring the grantee from receiving future DOJ grants; and/or recommending the grantee for (nonprocurement) government-wide suspension or debarment.\n\n[ back to top ]\n\nAudit Issues\n\nDOJ may choose not to approve an applicant for an award if the applicant has an overdue audit report, an open audit report that has not been responded to, or if the applicant has not tried to resolve the issues identified in the audit.\n\nIf you are not in compliance with audit requirements, your application for an award may be rejected, or your funds may be withheld until audit compliance is achieved.\n\n[ back to top ]\n\nVerification of Taxpayer Identification Number\n\nDOJ may verify the employer identification number (EIN) provided on the application.\n\nDOJ may assign a vendor number very similar to your EIN. This is done to ensure that a sub-agency within your government which receives awards directly will have a separate identifier from that of the parent agency.\n\nFor example, you are a State government and your EIN is 123456777. A police department within your government applies for and receives an award from DOJ, but since the EIN is the same, we assign them an DOJ vendor number of 123456778 so that we can identify them as a sub-agency within your government.\n\n[ back to top ]\n\nReview of Applicant Federal Debt\n\nThe SF-424 asks if the applicant is delinquent on any Federal debt.\n\nThe applicant is the organization that is requesting Federal assistance, not the person who signs the application as the authorized representative of the organization.\n\nFederal debt includes delinquent audit disallowances, loans, taxes, and any outstanding debts with the Treasury.\n\n[ back to top ]\n\nConfirmation of Dun & Bradstreet Data Universal Numbering System Number\n\nAll recipients must have a Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number when applying for Federal awards and cooperative agreements (initial or supplemental awards) (2 C.F.R. Part 25 - Universal Identifier and System of Award Management).\n\nAs an organization, you can obtain a DUNS number at no cost by calling the toll-free DUNS number request line at 1-866-705-5711.\n\nIndividuals who apply for grant awards or cooperative agreements from the Federal Government are exempt from this requirement.\n\n[ back to top ]\n\nConfirmation of Listing in System for Award Management\n\nThe System for Award Management (SAM) is the Official U.S. Government system that consolidated the capabilities of the Central Contractor Registration (CCR), Federal Agency Registration (FedReg), the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA), and the Excluded Parties List System (EPLS). It became operational in August 2012. Recipients must have registered their DUNS in www.SAM.gov in order to receive an award.\n\nSAM collects, validates, stores, and disseminates data on organizations to help agencies in their acquisition missions, including Federal agency contract and assistance awards. The term “assistance awards” includes grants, cooperative agreements, and other forms of Federal assistance.\n\nYou must update or renew your registration at least once per year to maintain an active status. SAM will send notifications to the registered user via email 60, 30, and 15 days prior to the expiration of the record.\n\nTo update or renew your entity record(s) in SAM, you will need to create a SAM User Account and link it to your migrated (existing) entity records.\n\nIt takes 2 to 3 days for SAM to complete record updates. You will be notified via email when the process is complete and your record is active in SAM.\n\nIf your organization is new to doing business with the Federal Government, the initial registration in SAM takes up to 5 days to become active. Registration with SAM requires a DUNS number and your entity’s Tax ID number (TIN).\n\nYour organization must maintain an “active” registration in www.SAM.gov for the entire period of your award."
