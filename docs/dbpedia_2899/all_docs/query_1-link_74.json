        "text": "Patient Population Under Consideration\n\nThis recommendation applies to women who are asymptomatic for BRCA-related cancer and have unknown BRCA mutation status. It includes women who have never been diagnosed with BRCA-related cancer, as well as those with a previous breast, ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal cancer diagnosis who have completed treatment and are considered cancer free but have not been previously tested. While this recommendation applies to women, the net benefit estimates are driven by biological sex (ie, male/female) rather than gender identity. Persons should consider their sex at birth to determine which recommendation best applies to them.\n\nAssessment of Risk\n\nMutations in the BRCA1/2 genes cluster in families, showing an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance in either the mother’s or father’s family. When taking medical and family history information from patients, primary care clinicians should ask about specific types of cancer, primary cancer sites, which family members were affected, and whether relatives had multiple types of primary cancer. Clinicians should also inquire about the age at diagnosis, age at death, and sex of affected family members, both immediate (ie, parents and siblings) as well as more distant (ie, aunts, uncles, grandparents, and cousins).\n\nFor women who have family members with breast, ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal cancer or have a personal history of these types of cancer, primary care clinicians may use appropriate brief familial risk assessment tools to determine the need for in-depth genetic counseling. Tools evaluated by the USPSTF include the Ontario Family History Assessment Tool (Table 1), Manchester Scoring System (Table 2), Referral Screening Tool (Table 3), Pedigree Assessment Tool (Table 4), 7-Question Family History Screening Tool (Table 5), International Breast Cancer Intervention Study instrument (Tyrer-Cuzick) (Table 6), and brief versions of BRCAPRO. Each of these tools has been validated and accurately estimate the likelihood of carrying a harmful BRCA1/2 mutation. They can be used to guide referrals to genetic counseling for more definitive risk assessment.28 General breast cancer risk assessment models (eg, the National Cancer Institute Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool, which is based on the Gail model) are not designed to identify BRCA-related cancer risk and should not be used for this purpose.\n\nIn general, these brief familial risk assessment tools include factors associated with increased likelihood of potentially harmful BRCA1/2 mutations. These include breast cancer diagnosis before age 50 years, bilateral breast cancer, presence of both breast and ovarian cancer in one individual, male family members with breast cancer, multiple cases of breast cancer in the family, 1 or more family members with 2 primary types of BRCA-related cancer (such as ovarian cancer), and Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. The USPSTF recognizes that each risk assessment tool has advantages and limitations and found insufficient evidence to recommend one over another.\n\nGenetic Counseling\n\nThe process of genetic counseling includes detailed kindred analysis and risk assessment for potentially harmful BRCA1/2 mutations. It also includes identification of candidates for testing, patient education, discussion of the benefits and harms of genetic testing, interpretation of results after testing, and discussion of management options. Genetic counseling about BRCA1/2 mutation testing should be performed by trained health professionals, including suitably trained primary care clinicians. Several professional organizations describe the skills and training necessary to provide comprehensive genetic counseling.\n\nGenetic Testing\n\nTesting for BRCA1/2 mutations should be performed only when an individual has personal or family history that suggests an inherited cancer susceptibility, when an individual is willing to talk with a health professional who is suitably trained to provide genetic counseling and interpret test results, and when test results will aid in decision-making. Clinical practice guidelines recommend that BRCA1/2 mutation testing begin with a relative with known BRCA-related cancer, including male relatives, to determine if a clinically significant mutation is detected in the family before testing individuals without cancer.29 If an affected family member with a BRCA-related cancer is not available, then the relative with the highest probability of mutation should be tested. The type of mutation analysis required depends on family history. Individuals from families with known mutations or from ancestry groups in which certain mutations are more common (eg, Ashkenazi Jewish founder mutations) can be tested for these specific mutations. Because risk assessment is primarily based on family history, it is unclear how women with a limited or unknown family history should be assessed for BRCA1/2 mutation risk and potential referral to counseling or genetic testing.\n\nTests for BRCA1/2 mutations are highly sensitive and specific for known mutations. The availability of testing options has changed since the 2013 US Supreme Court ruling that determined human genes are not patentable (Association for Molecular Pathology et al v Myriad Genetics Inc et al).30 Previously, BRCA1/2 mutation testing in the United States was mainly conducted by 1 laboratory. Since the ruling, the number of testing options has significantly increased, with more than 80 multigene panels that include BRCA1/2, as well as tests marketed directly to consumers.31\n\nGuidelines from the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, which were updated in 2015, recommend new standard terminology for reporting BRCA1/2 mutations identified by genetic tests. These include a 5-tier terminology system using the terms “pathogenic,” “likely pathogenic,” “uncertain significance,” “likely benign,” and “benign.”32\n\nTreatment and Interventions\n\nManagement of increased cancer risk related to BRCA1/2 mutations is beyond the scope of this Recommendation Statement. In general, care for women with harmful BRCA1/2 mutations consists of a variety of interventions to lower future cancer risk. This includes intensive screening, risk-reducing medications, and risk-reducing mastectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy.\n\nAdditional Tools and Resources\n\nThe National Cancer Institute Cancer Genetics Services Directory provides a list of professionals who offer services related to cancer genetics, including cancer risk assessment, genetic counseling, and genetic testing.33\n\nBurden of Disease\n\nFor women, breast cancer is the most common cancer in the United States after nonmelanoma skin cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death.37 In 2017, an estimated 252,710 women were diagnosed with breast cancer in the United States and 40,610 died of the disease.37 Ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer death in women in the United States.37 In 2017, an estimated 22,440 women were diagnosed with ovarian cancer and 14,080 died of the disease.37 Mutations of the BRCA1/2 genes are estimated to occur in 1 in 300 to 500 women in the general population8-11 and account for 5% to 10% of breast cancer cases and 15% of ovarian cancer cases.9,11,38\n\nEstimates of the prevalence of potentially harmful BRCA1/2 mutations vary by population. The estimated prevalence is 0.2% to 0.3% in the general population of women, 6.0% in women with cancer onset before age 40 years, and 2.1% in the general population of Ashkenazi Jewish women.39 In a meta-analysis of studies in which recruitment was based on family history of breast or ovarian cancer, BRCA1 mutation prevalence was 13.6%, BRCA2 mutation prevalence was 7.9%, and prevalence of either mutation was 19.8%.39\n\nScope of Review\n\nTo update its 2013 recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a systematic review28,40 on risk assessment, genetic counseling, and genetic testing for potentially harmful BRCA1/2 mutations in asymptomatic women who have never been diagnosed with BRCA-related cancer, as well as those with a previous breast, ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal cancer diagnosis who have completed treatment and are considered cancer free. The USPSTF reviewed interventions to reduce the risk for breast, ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal cancer in women with potentially harmful BRCA1/2 mutations, including intensive cancer screening (eg, earlier and more frequent mammography or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] of the breast), medications (eg, tamoxifen, raloxifene, or aromatase inhibitors), and risk-reducing surgery (eg, mastectomy or salpingo-oophorectomy). Although male breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, and melanoma are associated with BRCA1/2 mutations, discussion of these types of cancer is outside the scope of this recommendation.\n\nAccuracy of Familial Risk Assessment\n\nThe USPSTF reviewed studies of familial risk stratification tools that could be used in primary care settings to determine the likelihood of potentially harmful BRCA1/2 mutations. These tools are primarily intended for use by health care clinicians untrained in genetic cancer risk assessment to guide referral to genetic counselors for more definitive evaluation. In general, these tools elicit information about factors associated with increased likelihood of BRCA1/2 mutations, including family and personal history of cancer (including types of cancer and age of diagnosis) and ancestry (Ashkenazi Jewish). Because risk assessment is primarily based on family history, it is unclear how women with an unknown family history should be assessed for BRCA1/2 mutation risk.\n\nModels that have been validated in studies include the Ontario Family History Assessment Tool (Table 1),15-18 Manchester Scoring System (Table 2),16-21,41 Referral Screening Tool (Table 3),22 Pedigree Assessment Tool (Table 4),23,24 7-Question Family History Screening Tool (Table 5),25 and the International Breast Cancer Intervention Study instrument (also known as Tyrer-Cuzick) (Table 6), and their variations.26 The USPSTF found that these tools are clinically useful predictors of which individuals should be referred for genetic counseling. Compared with results of other models or genetic testing in studies, these tools all have sensitivity estimates between 77% and 100% and areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve between 0.68 and 0.96,28 although some models have been evaluated in only 1 study.22,25,26 The USPSTF reviewed a study of brief versions of BRCAPRO (eg, BRCAPRO-LYTE), designed for primary care clinicians, followed by the full BRCAPRO (used by genetic counselors) and found that the sequential testing scheme identified a similar number of BRCA mutation carriers as the full BRCAPRO.42 The USPSTF recognizes that each risk assessment tool has advantages and limitations and found insufficient evidence to recommend one tool over another.\n\nEffectiveness of Genetic Counseling, Genetic Testing, and Interventions\n\nTo understand the full benefits and harms of genetic counseling, the USPSTF reviewed studies on pretest and posttest counseling, BRCA1/2 mutation testing, and interventions.\n\nPretest and Posttest Counseling\n\nThe USPSTF reviewed 28 studies on pretest counseling.43-72 Studies reported measures of distress associated with genetic counseling for BRCA-related cancer, including cancer worry (17 studies), anxiety (13 studies), and depression (7 studies). In general, pretest genetic counseling either decreased or had no effect on breast cancer worry, anxiety, and depression.28 Twenty-two studies examined understanding of risk, with most reporting either improved understanding (14 studies)45,48,53,55-58,61,64,65,67-69,72,73 or no association (6 studies),43,52,59,62,70,71 1 study reporting decreased understanding,60 and 1 study reporting mixed results.46 Five studies that evaluated the effects of genetic counseling on BRCA1/2 mutation testing intention found decreased intent to test in 4 studies45,53,58,67 and increased intent in 1 study.74\n\nAlthough several studies included discussion of management options as part of the pretest counseling process, none evaluated benefits or harms of counseling conducted after receiving test results.\n\nBRCA1/2 Mutation Testing\n\nOne good-quality trial (n = 1034) of women and men of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry evaluated population-based BRCA1/2 mutation testing vs family history–based testing.75 Results showed that a strategy of population-based testing for founder mutations detected more BRCA1/2 mutation carriers than testing persons who met family history criteria. However, no clinical outcomes were reported and, because not all participants had BRCA1/2 mutation testing, the accuracy of this strategy could not be determined. Genetic testing generally improved risk perception, with increased perceived risk of breast and ovarian cancer risk in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers and decreased perceived risk in persons testing negative.76,77\n\nInterventions\n\nStudied interventions to reduce risk for cancer in women who are BRCA1/2 mutation carriers include earlier, more frequent, or more intensive cancer screening (eg, breast MRI or mammography); use of risk-reducing medications (eg, selective estrogen receptor modulators or aromatase inhibitors); and risk-reducing surgery (eg, mastectomy or salpingo-oophorectomy).\n\nThe USPSTF reviewed 11 randomized clinical trials of selective estrogen receptor modulators and aromatase inhibitors, although none were conducted specifically in women who were BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. Results of meta-analysis78 indicated clinically significant reductions in invasive breast cancer with the use of tamoxifen, raloxifene, and aromatase inhibitors, with 7 fewer events per 1000 women for tamoxifen (4 trials),79-82 9 fewer events per 1000 women for raloxifene (2 trials),83,84 and 16 fewer events per 1000 women for aromatase inhibitors (2 trials),85-89 assuming 5 years of treatment. Tamoxifen reduced invasive breast cancer more than raloxifene in the head-to-head trial (relative risk, 1.24 [95% CI, 1.05-1.47]).90 Risk reduction persisted at least 8 years after discontinuation in the 2 tamoxifen trials providing long-term follow-up data. All medications reduced estrogen receptor–positive, but not estrogen receptor–negative, invasive breast cancer. Breast cancer–specific and all-cause mortality were not reduced.78\n\nIn cohort studies of high-risk women and women who were BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, risk-reducing surgery such as mastectomy (6 studies),91-97 oophorectomy (7 studies),98-104 or salpingo-oophorectomy (2 studies)91,105 were associated with reduced risk for breast or ovarian cancer. Bilateral mastectomy was associated with a 90% to 100% reduced breast cancer incidence and 81% to 100% reduced breast cancer mortality. Oophorectomy was associated with 81% to 100% reduced ovarian cancer incidence. In general, there was no association between oophorectomy or salpingo-oophorectomy and reduced breast cancer risk, although some studies showed reduced risk in younger women (age <50 years).78,98,99\n\nThe USPSTF found no studies on the benefits of intensive screening for BRCA-related cancer on clinical outcomes in women who are BRCA1/2 mutation carriers.\n\nHarms of Genetic Counseling, Genetic Testing, and Interventions\n\nThe USPSTF reviewed the psychological effects of test results. Nine studies evaluated breast cancer worry or distress after genetic testing. Increased worry was found in 7 studies,77,106-111 particularly in women who are BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, and 2 studies reported decreased worry.112,113 Studies reporting anxiety related to genetic testing were mixed, with 4 reporting increased anxiety,106,109,113,114 2 reporting decreased anxiety,111,115 and 6 reporting no association.75,108,112,116-118 Two studies noted higher anxiety in women who were not tested compared with those who were tested.111,119 Of the 8 studies evaluating depression, none reported increases in anxiety after genetic testing.75,108,111,112,115,117,118,120\n\nIntensive screening for breast and ovarian cancer is associated with false-positive results, additional imaging tests, and surgery for women without cancer. In a retrospective analysis of a cohort of women with potentially harmful BRCA1/2 mutations or first-degree relatives with BRCA1/2 mutations, women screened with mammography were more likely to have additional imaging tests than those screened with MRI.121 In 2 studies comparing mammography with MRI for breast cancer screening in which 18% to 100% of study participants were BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, MRI was associated with higher false-positive rates (14% vs 5.5% in the first round of screening; P<0.001;122 15% vs 11% in another study121). Intensive screening for ovarian cancer using transvaginal ultrasound demonstrated high false-positive rates (3.4%).123 A second study in women who were BRCA1/2 mutation carriers reported a diagnostic surgery rate of 55% after annual screening with transvaginal ultrasound and serum tumor marker cancer antigen125 measurements for women without cancer.124 Most women did not experience anxiety after screening with MRI, mammography, or clinical breast examination, although women recalled for additional testing reported transient anxiety.125\n\nEight placebo-controlled trials and 1 head-to-head trial of tamoxifen and raloxifene reported harms of risk-reducing medications. Raloxifene and tamoxifen increased risk for thromboembolic events compared with placebo, and raloxifene caused fewer events than tamoxifen in the head-to-head trial.78,126,127 An increased risk of endometrial cancer was seen with tamoxifen (4 cases per 1000 women) but not with raloxifene or aromatase inhibitors. Women using tamoxifen had more cataract procedures compared with placebo or raloxifene.79,90 The most common adverse effects were vasomotor symptoms and vaginal discharge, itching, or dryness for tamoxifen and vasomotor symptoms and leg cramps for raloxifene.28\n\nThirteen studies of mastectomy128-140 and 9 studies of oophorectomy or salpingo-oophorectomy141-145 reported harms associated with surgical interventions, although most were small in size and had mixed outcomes. For mastectomy, complication rates ranged from 49% to 69%.28 Complications included numbness, pain, tingling, infection, swelling, breast hardness, bleeding, organizing hematoma, failed reconstruction, breathing problems, thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism.28 Postsurgical complications associated with oophorectomy/salpingo-oophorectomy included bleeding, pain, infection, and hematoma formation, with 1% to 3% of women in 1 study reporting such complications.142 In another small study of women who were BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, most women reported worsening vasomotor symptoms and decreased sexual function.146 Seven studies reported psychological outcomes in women receiving risk-reducing mastectomy132-140 and 3 studies in those receiving risk-reducing oophorectomy/salpingo-oophorectomy.143-145 Commonly reported symptoms included reductions in body image, sexual activity/satisfaction, and general mental health (anxiety/depression symptoms); however, many of these symptoms were transient.28\n\nEstimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit\n\nFor women whose family or personal history is associated with an increased risk for harmful mutations in the BRCA1/2 genes, there is adequate evidence that the benefits of risk assessment, genetic counseling, genetic testing, and interventions are moderate. For women whose family history is not associated with an increased risk for harmful mutations in the BRCA1/2 genes, there is adequate evidence that the benefits of risk assessment, genetic counseling, genetic testing, and interventions are small to none.\n\nThe USPSTF found adequate evidence that the overall harms of risk assessment, genetic counseling, genetic testing, and interventions are small to moderate.\n\nFor women whose family history is associated with an increased risk for harmful mutations in the BRCA1/2 genes, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the net benefit outweighs the harm of risk assessment and referral to genetic counseling for consideration of testing, detection, and intervention is moderate. For women whose family history is not associated with an increased risk for harmful mutations in the BRCA1/2 genes, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the harms of risk assessment and referral to genetic counseling for consideration of testing, detection, and intervention outweigh the benefits.\n\nHow Does the Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?\n\nThe BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are tumor suppressor genes. Harmful mutations of these genes have been linked to hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. Risks for breast, ovarian, and other types of BRCA-related cancer are greatly increased in patients who have inherited potentially harmful BRCA1/2 mutations. Genetic testing may identify these mutations. Several options are available to reduce cancer risk in patients found to be mutation carriers.\n\nResponse to Public Comment\n\nA draft version of this Recommendation Statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from February 19 through March 18, 2019. In response to public comments, the USPSTF clarified language regarding risk assessment and included additional information on the risk assessment tools referenced in the recommendation. It also incorporated language clarifying that the recommendation includes women with a personal history of BRCA-related cancer who have completed treatment and are considered cured.\n\nComments requested that the population under consideration be expanded to include other BRCA-associated cancers such as pancreatic cancer, melanoma, and prostate cancer, as well as men with breast or prostate cancer. The USPSTF recognizes the association of BRCA1/2 mutations with cancers such as pancreatic, prostate, and melanoma. However, the scope of the recommendation is limited to the prevention of breast, ovarian, tubal, and peritoneal cancer because the net benefit demonstrated was in the prevention of these cancers. The USPSTF did not review evidence on the benefits or harms of risk assessment, genetic counseling, and genetic testing in men.\n\nSeveral comments requested changes to the recommendation related to newer genetic testing options. This includes the use of multigene panels, expanding the recommendation to include other gene mutations linked to increased risk of cancer (eg, TP53, ATM, PALB2), and the use of direct-to-consumer testing. The USPSTF acknowledges that there is increasing access to multigene panels; however, the clinical significance of identifying pathogenic variants in multigene panels requires further investigation. The evidence is currently limited on other moderate penetrance genes, given their relatively low incidence in the population. The USPSTF’s recommendation focuses on BRCA1/2 mutations because they are more prevalent and the findings are clinically actionable. The USPSTF found no evidence on the benefits or harms associated with the use of direct-to-consumer testing. Current National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines recommend that multigene testing be offered in the context of professional genetic expertise for pretest and posttest.29 The USPSTF added language emphasizing that the net benefit relies on genetic counseling to accompany testing results, including results from direct-to-consumer testing.\n\n1.
