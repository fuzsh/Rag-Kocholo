        "text": "Other updates on Jordan's Principle\n\nUnder Jordan's Principle we are ensuring that First Nations children can access the products, services and supports they need, when they need them, while we work with First Nations partners, provinces and territories to develop long-term approaches to help better address the unique needs of First Nations children.\n\nOn September 29, 2021, the federal court upheld orders by the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal regarding eligibility under Jordan's Principle and compensation. The Government of Canada did not appeal the orders about Jordan's Principle eligibility for products and services.\n\nThis means that First Nations families can continue to access Jordan's Principle under the same eligibility criteria that has been in place since November 25, 2020.
