        "text": "SRA Tool for Windows\n\nThe SRA Tool is a desktop application that walks users through the security risk assessment process using a simple, wizard-based approach. Users are guided through multiple-choice questions, threat and vulnerability assessments, and asset and vendor management. References and additional guidance are given along the way. Reports are available to save and print after the assessment is completed.\n\nThis application can be installed on computers running 64-bit versions of Microsoft Windows 7/8/10/11. All information entered into the tool is stored locally on the user's computer. HHS does not collect, view, store, or transmit any information entered into the SRA Tool.\n\nDownload Version 3.4 of the SRA Tool for Windows [.msi - 70.4 MB]\n\nSRA Tool Excel Workbook\n\nThis version of the SRA Tool takes the same content from the Windows desktop application and presents it in a familiar spreadsheet format. The Excel Workbook contains conditional formatting and formulas to calculate and help identify risk in a similar fashion to the SRA Tool application. This version of the SRA Tool is intended to replace the legacy \"Paper Version\" and may be a good option for users who do not have access to Microsoft Windows or otherwise need more flexibility than is provided by the SRA Tool for Windows.\n\nThis workbook can be used on any computer using Microsoft Excel or another program capable of handling .xlsx files. Some features and formatting may only work in Excel.\n\nDownload Version 3.4 of the SRA Tool Excel Workbook [.xlsx - 128 KB]\n\nSRA Tool User Guide\n\nDownload the SRA Tool User Guide for FAQs and details on how to install and use the SRA Tool application and SRA Tool Excel Workbook.\n\nDownload SRA Tool User Guide [.pdf - 3.3 MB]\n\nWhat's new in Version 3.4:"
