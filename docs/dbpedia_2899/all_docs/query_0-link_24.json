        "text": "On Tuesday, Sept. 12, the Kansas State Board of Education approved licensure test changes.\n\nRecommendations approved by the State Board were:\n\nRemoving the Principles of Learning and Teaching (PLT) pedagogy exam as a requirement for licensure.\n\nEstablishing a process through the Licensure Review Committee to address educators who completed Kansas-approved teacher preparation programs but haven’t passed the required content exam after two attempts to qualify for a standard Kansas teaching license.\n\nThe approval of these items means that effective immediately Kansas program completers and out-of-state program completers won’t be required to take the PLT pedagogy exam to qualify for a standard initial teaching license.\n\nIndividuals who have a current valid temporary nonrenewable license and only require a passing PLT score to qualify for a standard initial teaching license will be reissued a standard initial teaching license. Those who have a temporary nonrenewable license that lists both content testing and the PLT will be reissued an edited temporary nonrenewable license with the PLT requirement removed.\n\nKSDE’s Teacher Licensure team will review all currently valid temporary nonrenewable licenses and reissue applicable licenses. Educators aren’t required to submit an application to receive a reissued license.\n\nIf an educator doesn’t have a current valid temporary nonrenewable license and hasn’t qualified for a standard initial Kansas teaching license because he or she hasn’t received a passing PLT score, the individual can email Teacher Licensure at TLALicense@ksde.org to verify eligibility for an initial teaching license and receive instructions on how to apply for the license.\n\nA process for people who haven’t passed the required content exam after two attempts is under development. The process will be established as quickly as possible, and guidance will be sent out once the final process is approved by the State Board.\n\nEmergency Substitute License Temporary Modification - Wednesday, May 10, 2023\n\nAt the May 10, 2023, meeting, the Kansas State Board of Education moved to allow for an extension of the temporary modification to the Emergency Substitute License for two years.\n\nTemporary Expanded Qualification: Expires June 30th of the expiration year, and will not be eligible for renewal after June 30, 2025\n\nLicense Limitations:\n\nLicense is non-transferable, limited to the local school district listed on the license.\n\nCan apply for multiple districts if each district submits an expanded emergency substitute qualification form.\n\nOnly one $60.00 application fee is required if an educator applies to multiple districts.\n\nIndividual may serve no more than 25 consecutive days in the same assignment.\n\nIndividual may substitute up to 75 school days each semester in one school district.\n\nApplication Process:\n\nAn individual may temporarily qualify for an emergency substitute license with the following:\n\nHigh school diploma.\n\nand\n\nCompletion of Greenbush’s Emergency Substitute Training Modules (training may be completed now *).\n\n​and\n\nVerification of hire from a local school district.\n\nApplication and $60 processing fee.\n\nFingerprint background check and $50 fee.\n\n*Click here to register and complete the Greenbush Emergency Substitute Training Modules: plus.greenbush.org.\n\nExpanded Emergency Substitute Application Instruction:\n\nTo apply for the emergency substitute license based on completion of the Greenbush Training Modules, complete the following:\n\nComplete the Greenbush Emergency Substitute Training Modules.\n\nThe Greenbush training modules include a step-by-step video that details how to submit the application. HERE is a link to the video.\n\nSubmit the Form 8 application via the Kansas Licensure Application System. Here is a link to the application system User Login for KSDE Web Applications.\n\nWithin the “Education Information” Section of Form 8, select the following:\n\nState: “KS”\n\nName of College/University: “Greenbush – Modified Emergency Substitute”\n\nDegree Earned: “No”\n\nTranscript Delivery Method: “Upload Transcript”\n\nUpload the Greenbush Certificate of Completion to the application.\n\nSubmit payment.\n\nContact the hiring district to complete the Expanded Emergency Substitute Qualification Form\n\nExpanded Emergency Substitute Application Local School District Instructions:\n\nComplete the Expanded Emergency Substitute Qualification Form for hired applicants.\n\nSubmit the completed form to experienceform@ksde.org.\n\nThere is a new policy for extending an Initial Teaching License if it expires the same semester a mentoring program will be completed.\n\nEducators will now complete Form 21: Upgrade an Initial Teaching License to a Professional License Based on Mentoring. The Extension of Initial Teaching License Form will no longer be used.\n\nSchool Specialist and School Leadership are not eligible for an extension.\n\nPlease note that the application will start with a basic question: “Have you completed mentoring?” The educator will need to answer “YES” in order to submit the application.\n\nThe district MUST verify completion of mentoring at the end of the semester and enter a future date of completion within the form.\n\nWhile processing the application, the licensure team will extend the Initial Teaching License to the date the district verifies mentoring will be completed. A Professional Teaching License will be issued with an effective date equivalent to the date mentoring was completed as verified by the district.\n\nIt is the responsibility of the applicant and the district to notify KSDE Teacher License if the mentoring was not completed.\n\nIf you have questions, please submit them to TLALicense@ksde.org"
