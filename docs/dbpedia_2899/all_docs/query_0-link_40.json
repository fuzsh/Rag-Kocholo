        "meta_description": "Between 2017 and 2021, the Institute for Policy Integrity[[The Institute for Policy Integrity has filed amicus briefs in several of the cases discussed in this Roundup. Policy Integrity did not represent any of the parties.]]documented the outcomes of litigation over the Trump administration's use of federal agencies to implement its policies.[[The Roundup does not include litigation over self-implementing presidential memoranda or executive orders or over project-level decisions.]] We tracked litigation over agency actions such as regulations, guidance documents, and agency memoranda.[[At times, advocates have brought lawsuits over a single agency action in multiple different courts. The Roundup combines decisions from different courts regarding the same agency action in a single entry. ]] The win-loss rate below reflects all decisions through January 20, 2021, when the Biden administration took office. [[A new administration’s litigation strategy may differ from the previous administration’s litigation strategy due to differences in policy objectives. See Bethany A. Davis Noll, “Tired of Winning”: Judicial Review of Regulatory Policy in the Trump Era, 73 Admin L. Rev. 353, 389 (2021) (noting ways in which Biden administration’s strategy changed in light of substantive goals). Accordingly, changes after President Biden took office are not clearly attributable to the Trump administration, and we did not recategorize reversals that occurred after this transition.]] Any reversals or modifications on appeal that occurred during the remainder of 2021 are noted in the case descriptions. [[The Roundup reflects wins and losses as they stood on January 20, 2021 when President Biden was inaugurated and his administration took over the defense of cases. Subsequent reversals on appeal or any other subsequent modifications that occurred prior to April 1, 2022 are noted in the relevant entry, but are not reflected in \"win\" or \"loss\" categorizations. If cases in the tracker were instead categorized as wins or losses based on subsequent substantive reversals on appeal or other subsequent modifications that occurred, 57 cases (23%) would have been successful for the administration and 188 (77%) of cases would have been unsuccessful for the administration.]] As of April 25, 2022, those updates are no longer being added.",

No. 21-4120)\n\nDecember 10, 2020: A federal district court in Utah denied a request to vacate 59 leases of public land in the Uinta Basin for oil and gas exploration, concluding that the agency complied with the National Environmental Policy Act in several respects and, while finding that the agency had failed to properly analyze two reasonable alternatives, explaining that the record did not indicate that, upon documenting its reasonable alternatives analysis, the agency would fail to justify a similar decision.\n\nCenter for Biological Diversity v. Bernhardt, 982 F.3d 723 (9th Cir. 2020)\n\nDecember 7, 2020: A federal appeals court vacated the Department of Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management’s approval of an offshore oil drilling and production facility along the coast of Alaska in the Beaufort Sea, finding that the Bureau acted arbitrarily and capriciously in failing to quantify—or explain why it could not quantify—the emissions resulting from foreign oil consumption in its Environmental Impact Statement, as required by the National Environmental Policy Act.\n\nPangea Legal Services v. Department of Homeland Security, No. 20-07721, 2020 WL 6802474 (N.D. Cal.

Wolf, No. No. 20-2245, 2020 WL 6770508 (D.D.C. Nov. 18, 2020), stayed (D.C Cir. Jan. 29, 2021)\n\nNovember 18, 2020: A federal district court enjoined a Center for Disease Control and Prevention rule—which restricted immigration due to the COVID-19 pandemic (by for example, requiring unaccompanied minor noncitizens to be detained in facilities pending their expulsion), finding that, the plaintiff was likely to prevail on the argument that, under the applicable federal statute, the authority to prohibit the “introduction” of persons did not grant the agency authority to eject or evict persons subsequent to their entry. A federal appeals court subsequently stayed the injunction pending appeal. P.J.E.S. v. Pekoske, No. 20-02245 (D.C Cir. Jan. 29, 2021).\n\nCalifornia v. Azar, No. 19-02552 (N.D. Cal.

United States Army Corps of Engineers, No. 418-251, 2020 WL 5837650 (S.D. Ga. Sept. 30, 2020)\n\nSeptember 30, 2020: A federal district court upheld the Army Corps of Engineers’ permit allowing a real estate developer to use an offshore source to renourish the beach in front of a development, finding that the Corps’ permit grant was not arbitrary and capricious, for the Agency had adequately analyzed practicable alternatives as required under the Clean Water Act, had engaged in the requisite hard look required by the National Environmental Policy Act before making its finding that there would be no significant environmental impact, and appropriately determined that subsequent permit modifications did not significantly increase the scope of the permitted activity so as to require a new application procedure.\n\nTiktok Inc. v. Trump, No. 20-658, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 177250 (D.D.C. Sep. 27, 2020), appeal dropped (D.C. Cir. 20-5302)\n\nSeptember 27, 2020: A federal district court in D.C. blocked the Department of Commerce's removal of TikTok from U.S. app stores. The Department of Commerce had directed TikTok's removal following a presidential executive order banning the app. In a separate case, a federal district court in California blocked the Department of Commerce's removal of WeChat from U.S. app stores, holding that plaintiffs had shown likelihood of success on their First Amendment claim.

The court held that Pendly—who had been appointed by the Secretary of the Interior as Acting Director of the Bureau of Land Management, but had not been confirmed by the Senate—was unlawfully serving in that role, in violation of the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution, the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998, and the Administrative Procedure Act, and that any decisions issued by Pendley were arbitrary and capricious.\n\nCasa de Maryland v. Wolf, No. 20-02118, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 166613 (D. Md. Sep. 11, 2020), appeal dropped (4th Cir. 19-2222)\n\nSeptember 11, 2020: A federal district court held that two Department of Homeland Security rules (here and here) imposing new asylum restrictions are arbitrary and capricious for failure to consider important alternatives and failure to fully consider harms.

Scalia, No. 20-01689, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 163498 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 8, 2020), appeal dismissed as moot (2d Cir. No. 20-3815)\n\nSeptember 8, 2020: A federal district court held that the Department of Labor rule revising and narrowing the Department’s interpretation of the term “joint employer” under the Fair Labor Standards Act, was inconsistent with the Act and that the agency had failed to provide a reasoned explanation.\n\nNat'l Urban League v. Ross, No. 20-05799, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 162878 (N.D. Cal. Sep. 5, 2020), stay granted No. 20A62, 2020 U.S. LEXIS 5052 (U.S.S.C. Oct. 13, 2020), appeal dropped (20-16868)\n\nSeptember 5, 2020: A federal district court temporarily stayed the Commerce Department's plan to end the census count one month early and deliver the population data to the White House several months early. On September 24, the court then issued a preliminary injunction preventing the early conclusion, holding that the plan violated Administrative Procedure Act's notice-and-comment and reasoned decisionmaking requirements.\n\nGomez v. Trump, No. 20-1419 2020 WL 5367010 (D.D.C. Sept. 4, 2020), appeal dismissed as moot (D.C. Cir. No. 20-5292)\n\nSeptember 4, 2020: A federal district court in D.C. enjoined several of the State Department's policies implementing President Trump’s Proclamation barring foreign guest workers from entering the United States, holding that the policies were in excess of the agency's statutory authority and that the agency failed to provide a reasoned explanation.

California Oct. 1, 2020).\n\nNative Ecosystems Council v. Mehlhoff, 2020 WL 2060354 (D. Mont. 2020)\n\nAugust 29, 2020: A federal district court in Montana found that the Bureau of Land Management had correctly analyzed three prescribed burn projects under the requirements of the Sage Grouse plans and that as such the plans did not violate the FLPMA. The court did find, however, that the agency had failed to comply with FLPMA for one of the areas.\n\nAlaska Urological Institute, P.C. v. Small Business Administration, 619 B.R. 689 (D. Alaska 2020)\n\nAugust 20, 2020: A federal district court held that the Small Business Administration’s adoption and implementation of rules precluding bankruptcy debtors from qualifying for loans made available under the Payroll Protection Program created as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act was arbitrary and capricious for failure to provide a reasoned explanation. Other courts came to similar conclusions. Diocese of Rochester v. Small Business Administration, 466 F. Supp. 3d 363 (W.D.N.Y. 2020); In re Roman Catholic Church of Archdiocese of Santa Fe, 615 B.R. 644 (Bkrtcy.D.N.M. 2020); In re Vestavia Hills, Ltd., 618 B.R. 294 (Bkrtcy. S.D.Cal. 2020).\n\nWalker v.

Clayton Cty., Ga., 140 S. Ct. 1731 (2020).\n\nNew York v. Department of Education, No. 20-4260 2020 WL 4581595 (S.D.N.Y.

DeVos, No. 20-01468, 2020 WL 4673413 (D.D.C. Aug. 12, 2020), a federal district court in D.C. denied plaintiffs’ request for an injunction, finding that the plaintiffs had not established a likelihood of success on their claims.\n\nNew York v. Wolf, No. 20-1127 (S.D.N.Y. 2020)\n\nJuly 23, 2020: The Department of Homeland Security withdrew a prohibition on New York State residents’ access to Trusted Traveler programs, after being sued for violating the Fifth Amendment, Tenth Amendment, and Administrative Procedure Act.

Bernhardt, No. 18-05712, 2020 WL 4001480 (N.D. Cal July 15, 2020), appeal filed (9th Cir. No. 20-16793)\n\nJuly 15, 2020: A federal district court in California vacated the Department of Interior's rescission of the Waste Prevention Rule.

LEXIS 66162 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 15, 2020). Separately, a federal appeals court in Massachusetts has also held that EPA's directive is judicially reviewable.

Dec. 20, 2019)\n\nDecember 20, 2019: A federal district court vacated the National Marine Fisheries Service’s issuance of an exempted fishing permit—which would have allowed two ships to engage in commercial longline fishing in the West Coast Exclusive Economic Zone for two years and would have endangered the survival and recovery of Pacific leatherback sea turtles and other endangered species—holding that the permit issuance violated the Endangered Species Act on account of the Service’s disregarded for the best available science and binding case law.\n\nCalifornia v. Trump, 407 F. Supp. 3d 869 (N.D. Cal. 2019), affirmed Nos. 19-17501, 2020 U.S. App. LEXIS 32172 (9th Cir. Oct. 9, 2020), vacated and remanded (U.S.S.C. 20-685) (due to changed circumstances following President Biden's inauguration)\n\nDecember 11, 2019: A federal district court in California held that federal defendants use of funds under Section 2808 of the National Emergencies Act for eleven specific border barrier construction projects in California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas, was unlawful, holding that federal defendants had \"not satisfied the mandatory conditions set by Congress\" for use of the funds. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the decision. A separate court in Texas rejected a similar challenge, holding that plaintiffs did not have standing. El Paso County, Texas v. Trump, 2020 WL 7090797 (5th Cir. 2020).\n\nNorthern Alaska Environmental Center v. Department of the Interior, No. 19-35008, 2018 WL 6424680 (D.

The court found that the agency failed to provide adequate notice to interested parties and failed to give a reasoned explanation for the rule. Two other federal district courts reached similar conclusions. Washington v. Azar, 426 F. Supp. 3d 704, 722 (E.D. Wash. 2019); City v. Azar, 411 F. Supp. 3d 1001, 1005 (N.D.

Separately, a federal district court in Illionois vacated the rule, see also Cook Cty., Illinois v. Wolf, 962 F.3d 208 (7th Cir. 2020) (affirming the preliminary injunction) and a federal district court in California enjoined it. City and County of San Francisco v. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, 408 F.Supp.3d 1057 (N.D.Cal. 2019), aff'd No. 19-17213 (9th Cir. Dec. 2, 2020), appeal dropped (U.S.S.C. 20-962. Mar. 9, 2021).\n\nEast Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Barr, 385 F. Supp. 3d 922 (N.D. Cal. 2019), stayed Barr v. East Bay Sanctuary Covenant, 140 S. Ct. 3 (2019), affirmed East Bay Sanctuary Covenant v.

July 6, 2020)\n\nSeptember 9, 2019: A federal district court in California enjoined a rule that categorically denied asylum to those entering the United States at the southern border who did not first apply for asylum in another country. The court found that the Department of Justice violated the Administrative Procedure Act’s notice-and-comment requirement, failed to provide a reasoned explanation for the rule, and violated Congress’ underlying statutory regime. A separate federal district court in D.C. later vacated the rule for failure to comply with notice-and-comment requirements.\n\nWestern Organization of Resource Councils v. Bernhardt, No. 18-139, 412 F. Supp. 3d 1227 (D. Mont. August 13, 2019)\n\nAugust 13, 2019: A federal district court in Montana enjoined reliance on the recommendations of the Royalty Policy Committee after holding that the Department of Interior failed to consult with the General Services Administration prior to re-establishing the Committee, in violation of Federal Advisory Committee Act and that the agency’s failure to provide a rational basis for its decisions on the membership of Committee was arbitrary and capricious.\n\nCenter for Biological Diversity v.

Azar, 397 F. Supp. 3d 11 (D.D.C. 2019)\n\nJuly 29, 2019: A federal district court in DC held that Health and Human Service’s November 20, 2018, decision approving New Hampshire’s Medicaid work requirement plan—an effort to roll back the Medicaid expansion in the Affordable Care Act—was arbitrary and capricious for failure to address the lost coverage that would occur under the decision. The court also found that the agency’s decision failed to advance the purposes of the Medicaid Act.\n\nDefenders of Wildlife v. Department of the Interior No 18-2090, 931 F.3d 339, 2019 WL 3366598 (4th Cir. July 26, 2019)\n\nJuly 26, 2019: A federal appeals court vacated a 2018 Biological Opinion and Incidental Take Statement issued by the Fisheries and Wildlife Service, holding that the agency’s conclusion that a proposed pipeline would not jeopardize endangered rusty patched bumble bee’s and clubshell’s survival and recovery was arbitrary and capricious for failure to address prior contradictory findings and failure to consider important aspects of the problem. The agency also violated the Endangered Species Act’s requirements on take limits for the endangered Indiana bat and threatened Madison Cave isopod.\n\nIdaho Conservation League v. Wheeler, 930 F.3d 494 (D.C. Cir. 2019)\n\nJuly 19, 2019: A federal appeals court in D.C. upheld EPA's decision not to finalize a proposed Obama-era rule that would have required hard-rock mine operators to establish and maintain evidence of financial responsibility to prove they could pay for cleanup in the event of toxic disasters or hazardous spills. The court rejected arguments that the decision contravened the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, was arbitrary and capricious, and was procedurally defective.\n\nSierra Club v. Trump, No. 19-00892, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 108933 (N.D. Cal. June 28, 2019), stayed (U.S.S.C. July 26, 2019), affirmed 963 F.3d 926 (9th Cir. June 26, 2020); California v.

See 2020 WL 2615527 (May 22, 2020).\n\nGuedes v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms & Explosives, 920 F.3d 1 (D.C. Cir. 2019), cert. denied, 140 S. Ct. 789 (2020)\n\nApril 1, 2019: The U.S. Court of Appeals declined to enjoin a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives rule—which classified bump-stock devices (devises that allow a shooter of a semiautomatic firearm to initiate a continuous firing cycle with a single pull of the trigger) as “machineguns” under the National Firearms Act of 1934 and the Gun Control Act of 1968, thus rendering bump-stock devices prohibited under the Acts—finding that the Bureau’s classification was reasonable, it had authority to promulgate the rule, and the rule was not arbitrary or capricious.\n\nStewart v. Azar, 366 F. Supp. 3d 125, 130 (D.D.C. 2019), appeal dismissed Stewart v. Azar, Nos. 19-5095, 19-5097, 2020 U.S. App. LEXIS 535 (D.C. Cir. Jan. 8, 2020).\n\nMarch 27, 2019: A federal district court in DC held that Health and Human Service’s November 20, 2018, decision approving Kentucky’s Medicaid work requirement plan—an effort to roll back the Medicaid expansion in the Affordable Care Act—was arbitrary and capricious for failure to address the lost coverage that would occur under the decision. Additionally, the court found that the decision violated the governing statute. (A previous and similar rule was also vacated. See the entry dated June 29, 2018.)\n\nCity of Council Bluffs, Iowa v.

The court held that EPA's regulations did not require compliance with water quality standards by the end of the variance's term.\n\nNational Parks Conservation Association v. Semonite, 916 F.3d 1075 (D.C. Cir. 2019)\n\nMarch 1, 2019: A federal appeals court in D.C. held that the Army Corps had violated the National Environmental Policy Act and Preservation Act in granting a permit to build a new electrical station and transmission lines across the James River in the Jamestown historic district.

The court held that plaintiffs were likely to succeed at showing that the new rules were not in accordance with the Affordable Care Act and thus violated the Administrative Procedure Act. Another federal district court in Pennsylvania blocked the suspensions on a nationwide basis. See Pennsylvania v. President, 351 F. Supp. 3d 791 (E.D. Pa. 2019), affirmed 930 F.3d 543 (3d Cir. 2019). (The two new rules had replaced a rule that had previously been enjoined. See the entry dated December 15, 2017.)\n\nFront Range Nesting Bald Eagle Studies v. Fish and Wildlife Service, 353 F. Supp. 3d 1115 (D. Colo. 2018), appeal dismissed (10th Cir. 19-1062)\n\nDecember 13, 2018: A federal district court in Colorado vacated a permit, and its associated environmental analysis, that had authorized a construction company to engage in activities that may significantly disturb bald eagles, holding that the agency’s analysis violated the National Environmental Policy Act for failure to consider cumulative impacts and that the agency had violated notice and comment requirements by providing only a seven-day public comment period.\n\nLeymis V. v.

Secretary United States Department of Homeland Security, 967 F.3d 242, 245 (3rd Cir. 2020), cert granted, 141 S.Ct. 973 (Jan. 8, 2021).\n\nRegents of the University of California v.

A different federal district court separately enjoined the rescission. Batalla Vidal v. Nielsen, 279 F. Supp. 3d 401, 429 (E.D.N.Y. 2018). Another court vacated the rescission. National Association for the Advancement of Colored People v. Trump, 315 F. Supp. 3d 457, 461 (D.D.C. 2018). A third district court denied a motion to enjoin the rescission. See Casa De Maryland v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 284 F. Supp. 3d 758, 779 (D. Md. 2018).

July 8, 2020)\n\nSeptember 24, 2018: A federal district court in Montana that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's decision to delist a population of grizzly bears in Yellowstone National Park from the federal list of endangered species violated the Endangered Species Act because the agency had not studied the effects that delisting that population would have on other populations of the species. The Ninth Circuit upheld that decision.\n\nWestern Watersheds Project v. Zinke, 336 F. Supp. 3d 1204 (D. Idaho 2018), appeal dismissed (9th Cir. 20-35342)\n\nSeptember 21, 2018: A federal district court in Idaho enjoined a Bureau of Land Management rule limiting environmental review and public participation in oil and gas lease sales that would threaten the sage grouse for violating Administrative Procedure Act notice-and-comment requirements, for exceeding its statutory authority under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, and for violating the National Environmental Policy Act. On February 27, 2020, the district court held that the grounds for the preliminary injunction remained sound and granted summary judgment in plaintiffs’ favor.\n\nZzyym v. Pompeo, 341 F. Supp. 3d 1248 (D.

Department of Energy, No. 17-06989 (S.D.N.Y.)\n\nAugust 13, 2018: The Department of Energy lifted a suspension of efficiency rules for air conditioners and heat pumps after being sued for failing to comply with the law in delaying.

See Natural Resources Defense Council v. Department of Energy, 362 F. Supp. 3d 126 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 22, 2019).\n\nEnvironmental Defense Fund v. Environmental Protection Agency, No. 18-1190 (D.C.

Additionally, in Sweet v. DeVos, No. 19-03674, 2020 WL 6149690 (N.D. Cal.

Pruitt, No. 17-0817 (D.D.C.)\n\nSeptember 18, 2017: After being sued, EPA withdrew the indefinite delay of a rule restricting toxic-metal wastewater discharges from power plants, and replaced it with a new delay. Later, a federal district court in D.C. denied summary judgment against the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), finding that the challenge to the delay was moot because it had been withdrawn. 315 F.

Cir. 2017)\n\nJuly 3, 2017: The U.S. Court of Appeals vacated the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) delay of a rule limiting methane leaks at oil and gas facilities. The rule requires companies to plug methane leaks, which would help recover valuable natural gas as well as help clean up the air. EPA delayed the rule, claiming that industry had raised objections that could not have been raised prior to the rule’s issuance. The court found that the delay was outside the agency’s authority under the Clean Air Act."
