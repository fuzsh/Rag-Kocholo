The RSC Regulation governs the preparation of risk assessment in Ontario for chemical contaminants in support of the submission of a Record of Site Condition for an individual property. Risk assessment reports must comply with the mandatory requirements specified in Section 4 of Schedule C (Table 1). References to the RSC Regulation and the EPA and exact quotes, taken from Schedule C are provided which identify the mandatory requirements for all risk assessment reports and identify the characteristics of risk assessments that may use alternate procedures and be subject to alternate time lines. However, stakeholders are still required to understand what is in the legislation and regulations and where necessary, seek legal counsel. Stakeholders should ensure that they refer to the most recent version of this document and any amendments to the RSC Regulation or Act.\n\nWhere the guidance document refers to mandatory requirements for risk assessment reports, as set out in regulation, these actions are signified by the word \"must\". Failure to meet these mandatory requirements means that the risk assessment work undertaken and the subsequent risk assessment report will not be considered by the ministry to be completed in accordance with the RSC Regulation. Where the guidance document indicates that something \"should\" be done, this is an expression of what the ministry considers to be a best practice. If the best practice is not undertaken, it is advisable that the reasons why the best practice was not followed be set out in the risk assessment report. It is the discretion of the approving Director to determine whether, and to what extent, best practices have been met, and whether to accept the risk assessment report, under Section 168.5 of the Environmental Protection Act.\n\nThis Procedure document provides the minimum requirements for conducting both the human health and ecological components of risk assessment for contaminated properties. It is not a comprehensive description of the risk assessment approach required for every potential contaminant situation or site condition. Since site conditions differ at each property and decisions may have to be made that are unique to existing circumstances, some risk assessment options are provided. Sound scientific judgment should be exercised throughout the risk assessment, however, in all cases.\n\nIn general, this Procedure document does not provide details for biological or hydrogeological monitoring, or epidemiological studies or address all activities required for the design of community-based or area-wide risk assessment studies.\n\nThis Procedure document is intended for use by experienced risk assessors in conjunction with best professional judgment. Additional information sources are provided at the end of this Procedure document for reference purposes.\n\nSection 1. Initiating the Risk Assessment\n\n1.1 Background to Risk Assessment\n\nRisk, in the context of environmental risk assessment, is a measure of the probability that a hazard will cause harm to an individual, population or the natural environment under defined conditions of exposure to a contaminant. Risk assessment is the scientific examination of the nature and magnitude of risk. It is a scientific process used to describe and estimate the likelihood of adverse health effects resulting from exposure of both human and ecological receptors to environmental contaminant(s).\n\nHuman health risk assessment (HHRA) is the evaluation of the risk of adverse health effects, and the accompanying uncertainties, to humans caused by exposure to a contaminant at a given property. Ecological risk assessment (ERA) is a process that evaluates the risk that adverse ecological effects may occur, or are occurring, as a result of exposure to contaminant(s). Both assessments take into consideration that many contaminants may be present simultaneously in several media such as food, air, water, soil, dust and/or consumer products, and that these contaminants reach receptors through multiple exposure pathways.\n\nSince property-specific characteristics are incorporated into risk assessment, there can be numerical differences between the published ministry site condition standards and the property specific standards developed through risk assessment. The level of risk afforded by property specific standards derived through risk assessment is intended to be the same as the target level of risk for any of the site condition standards published in the document Soil, Ground Water and Sediment Standards for Use Under Part XV.1 of the Environmental Protection Act (site condition standards). The main difference is that under a risk assessment, many of the input variables to the risk assessment process are determined for the specific property. Some of the conservative assumptions utilized in the setting of the generic site condition standards are not required to meet the target risk level and are replaced with property-specific values.\n\nRisk assessment can often lead to recommendations to utilize risk management to provide protection to human health and the environment. In this situation, risk management measures must be maintained to achieve the same target level of risk as the site conditions standards. Risk management is a process which is distinct and separate from other components of risk assessment, by which measures to control or reduce the level of risk estimated by the risk assessment are developed and implemented. Risk management integrates the results from the other components of risk assessment with information about technical resources, socio-economic factors and control options in order to reach decisions about the best way to manage a property. It is important that the HHRA and ERA components of risk assessment are clearly separated from the risk management component so that risk managers have scientifically based risk estimates upon which to base risk management decisions.\n\n1.2 When to Consider Risk Assessment\n\nFor the purpose of this Procedure document, risk assessment is a process for estimating the likelihood of adverse effects that could arise from the presence of contaminants of concern (COCs) and exposure pathways to human and ecological receptors at a contaminated property. As such, information derived from conducting a risk assessment is used to determine the standard for each COC that may be applied when filing a RSC for a property under section 168.4 of the EPA and referred to as a property specific standard. The risk assessment process can also help risk managers evaluate and compare the effectiveness of remediation and risk management alternatives for a specific property.\n\nRisk assessment principles have been utilized in the generic process which the ministry used to develop the site condition standards. The site condition standards are applicable at the majority of situations encountered at a contaminated site but may not always be appropriate for situations where property-specific considerations deviate substantially from the conditions assumed in the ministry generic process used to develop the site condition standards.\n\nIf the risk assessment approach is considered as an alternative to using the site condition standards in order to account for property specific considerations, the property owner should be advised of the recommendations of this Procedure document and the potential limitations associated with the risk assessment approach. Based on the level of effort required to assess risk for COCs on some properties it may be preferable to remediate the property to the site condition standards.\n\nThe RSC Regulation Part IX Site Condition Standards and Risk Assessments should be referred to when considering if the risk assessment approach is appropriate.\n\nWhen considering potential COCs refer to the following sections of the RSC Regulation;\n\nSchedule C Part I Mandatory Requirements\n\nSection 3 Contaminants of Concern.\n\nFurther clarification relating to contaminants detected on the site for which there are no site condition standards is provided in the RSC Regulation;\n\nSection 43 Applicable Site Condition Standards \"N/A\", \"N/V\" or not listed.\n\nThe following sections of the RSC Regulation should also be referred to when considering what approach might be taken to the risk assessment;\n\nSection 44 Risk Assessment Form\n\nSchedule C Part I Mandatory Requirements\n\nSection 1 Definitions and\n\nSection 2 Components of a Risk Assessment and\n\nSchedule C Part II Alternative Risk Assessment Procedures.\n\nIn the initiation stages of a risk assessment reference should be made to the following sections of the RSC Regulation;\n\nSchedule C Part I Mandatory Requirements\n\nSection 3 Mandatory Requirements of a Pre-Submission Form\n\nSchedule C Table 1\n\nReport Section 2 Risk Assessment Team\n\nReport Section 8 Public Communication Plan\n\nAdditional guidance on meeting the requirements of these sections is provided below.\n\n1.3 Role and Responsibilities of the Risk Assessment Qualified Person\n\nA risk assessment must be conducted by a qualified risk assessment team under the supervision of a Qualified Person (QPRA). The qualifications associated with the QPRA are specified in the RSC Regulation. A resume for the QPRA and each team technical lead are to be provided in an Appendix to the risk assessment report.\n\nAs part of the process of submitting a Pre-Submission Form (PSF), the QPRA will self-declare the qualifications set out in the RSC Regulation by attaching a post secondary education transcript and work references. Once these qualifications have been submitted to the ministry via a previous PSF they may not be required again.\n\n1.3.1 Making Certified Statements\n\nThe QPRA must make the certified statements verbatim as set out in Schedule C, Part I, Section 5 \"Mandatory Certifications\" of the RSC Regulation.\n\n1.3.2 Formation of Risk Assessment Team\n\nIn addition, the QPRA must identify the technical leads for the RA team and demonstrate that the team represents all of the required/relevant disciplines to complete the RA. If a technical lead for a specific discipline is absent from the RA team, the QPRA must explain why that particular discipline is not required for the completion of the RA. The minimum requirements for the risk assessment team are provided in Table 1 of the RSC Regulation, Schedule C, and reproduced below.\n\nReport Section Heading Sub-Heading Minimum Requirements 2. Risk Assessment Team Membership State the expertise required to complete this risk assessment and design of any risk management measures specified in report section 7 and justify the omission of areas of expertise normally associated with the completion of a risk assessment.\n\nIdentify each team member with the expertise necessary to complete the risk assessment and state how their qualifications relate to the given role and expertise required for this risk assessment.\n\nRisk assessment team technical leads should be identified in the Pre-Submission Form and the Risk Assessment Report for each of;\n\nHuman Health Risk Assessment\n\nEcological Risk Assessment\n\nHydrogeology\n\nEngineering (if risk management is required)\n\nThe following areas of expertise are normally associated with completion of a RA. A particular risk assessment team should generally cover all areas of academic expertise listed below, but may vary depending on the project. Several areas of expertise may be covered by a single team member, and team members' expertise may overlap, however all areas should be covered by the team as a whole.\n\nEducational qualifications for individual risk assessment team technical leads should include a specialized post-secondary education equivalent to a four-year degree level in one or more of the following areas:\n\nHuman and/or mammalian toxicology\n\nEcotoxicology (aquatic and terrestrial)\n\nGeology/hydrogeology\n\nSoil science/soil chemistry\n\nEnvironmental science\n\nEnvironmental chemistry\n\nAnalytical chemistry\n\nEngineering\n\nOne or more team members also should have work experience in one or more of the following:\n\nContaminated land assessment\n\nEnvironmental sampling, including soil sampling design and methodology\n\nGround water sampling design and methodology\n\nSurface water and sediment sampling and design\n\nBiota assessment, including sampling and bioassay\n\nInterpretation of analytical data and QA/QC procedures\n\nAssessment of contaminant exposure pathways and risk\n\nContaminant fate and transport in the environment\n\nExposure assessment\n\nData evaluation/statistical analysis\n\nToxicity evaluation (including hazard and dose-response assessment)\n\nRisk evaluation\n\nRemediation technologies\n\n1.4 Preparation for Conducting a Risk Assessment\n\nRisk assessment, in the context of Part XV.1of the Environmental Protection Act (EPA), is used to establish risk-based standards for a property and may include risk management measures. A risk assessment is built upon the results of a Phase one ESA and the extensive sampling, analytical work, hydrogeology and other elements of property characterization done in a Phase two ESA. The Phase one and Phase two ESAs must be conducted according to the requirements described in Parts VI, VII and VIII of the RSC Regulation. Any analytical results to be relied upon in the risk assessment must meet the requirements of Part IX Section 47 of the RSC Regulation.\n\nTo clarify, the ministry is fully supportive of the use of novel and innovative techniques to investigate environmental contamination, identify contaminant sources and extent and develop a conceptual site model in a cost effective and timely manner. Analytical results which are critical to support the assumptions in the risk assessment, however, must be confirmed using methods which comply with Section 47 of the RSC Regulation. As an example, field-portable analytical devices such as photoionization detectors, portable gas chromatographs and x-ray fluorescence detectors can be effective tools to identify appropriate locations for collection of samples to be analyzed in compliance with the RSC Regulation and relied upon in the risk assessment. Similarly, data from older site assessments which do not comply with the RSC Regulation can be used to identify where confirmatory analysis is required. Both compliant analysis and background supporting studies should be summarized in the risk assessment report.\n\nThe core of the risk assessment is a risk evaluation based upon toxicology, exposure assessment and characterization of ecological and human receptors and exposure pathways, as described in this Procedure document. The inter-relationship between a Phase one ESA, or Phase two ESA, and risk assessment is illustrated in Figure 1: Flowchart for the Site Remediation Process with Risk Assessment, shown in Section 8 of this Procedure document.\n\n1.4.1 Pre-Submission Form\n\nAs the first stage of conducting a risk assessment, a Pre-Submission Form (PSF) must be submitted by the RA property owner to the ministry for review in advance of the RA report. Conducting a risk assessment now includes compiling property characterization and receptor characterization information in the PSF. The QPRA should develop the PSF with a team of experts who possess the expertise required to address all exposure pathways and receptors of potential concern.\n\nThe PSF provides an opportunity to confirm with the ministry that the risk assessment approach and general scope as described in both narrative and visual forms (conceptual site model) are appropriate for the site and contaminants being considered.\n\nThe QPRA must prepare the PSF for the property owner, based on the results of the Phase one ESA, and Phase two ESA and any other information that the QPRA considers relevant. The ministry will prepare a letter of response that indicates the review timeline required for the RA approach, as well as comments concerning the scope of the RA. The purpose of the PSF is to:\n\nIdentify the RA property and ownership;\n\nIdentify the risk assessment team technical leads and self declaration of the QPRA;\n\nConfirm that a Phase one ESA and Phase two ESA have been conducted as prescribed by the RSC Regulation;\n\nProvide the proposed scope of the risk assessment including a preliminary conceptual site model and hazard identification of the RA property by:\n\nDescribing the RA property setting, contaminant sources, potential COCs, transport pathways, exposure pathways (including the results of any screening level assessment, if performed), and human and ecological receptors,\n\nIncluding a summary of key data that supports the conceptual model,\n\nProposing the collection of additional data, if required, and\n\nProposing an approach for proceeding with the risk assessment that will determine the timeline for risk assessment review.\n\nThe PSF provides the ministry with a general view on the approach to the risk assessment and the risk assessment team at an early stage.\n\nThe PSF process is intended to improve the quality of risk assessment submissions when they are made to the ministry at the end of the risk assessment process. The outcome of this preliminary consultation is not binding on the RA property owner or the ministry, as the understanding of site conditions may develop and/or change during the course of the risk assessment. For this reason, the ministry comment on the PSF does not in any way indicate acceptance of the final risk assessment approach or other conclusions or acceptance of the risk assessment report by the Director pursuant to s. 168.5 of the EPA.\n\nRequirements for submission of a Pre-Submission form (PSF) are specified in the RSC Regulation in Section 3 of Schedule C. A form containing much of the information required by the RSC Regulation is provided in Appendix D of this Procedures document. The remaining information is to be provided as drawings with explanatory notes (text). The PSF must be accompanied by a site plan and conceptual site model diagrams as described in the RSC Regulation. Explanatory notes should be provided to the extent necessary for the reader to understand the hazards, transport and exposure pathways, receptors and key site data on which the risk assessment approach is based, and including the rationale for why receptors will or will not be exposed to the contaminated media, with and without risk management, and the type of risk management which is contemplated. Guidance for completion of the form is provided in the Technical Update \"Preparation and submission of a Pre-Submission Form for a risk assessment to be submitted under the new Record of Site Condition Regulation (O. Reg. 153/04)\". The form and the Technical Update are available on the ministry’s Brownfields webpage.\n\nIf, at any time after submitting the PSF, the qualified person responsible for the preparation of the risk assessment changes or the property owner changes, the property owner shall give notice to the Director of the change in circumstance.\n\nKey to the success of obtaining useful ministry comment is the clear description in the PSF of the proposed conceptual site model. The complete requirements of the RSC Regulation with respect to the PSF form and attached drawings are in Schedule C Section 3. Subsections (8) and (9), which specifically relate to the required content of a conceptual site model, are copied in the text box below;\n\nIf a risk assessment is to be submitted to support a naturally elevated background concentration as a property specific standard, the requirements of a PSF relating to human and ecological receptors and exposure pathways do not apply. Provisions relating to a PSF for this purpose are included in Schedule C Section 3 (10) and are copied in the text box below. In these cases, the site plan and cross sections of the property are intended to convey the rationale for attributing elevated concentrations to natural geological features and to support and describe the planned sampling program to meet Schedule C subsections 8(4) to (9).\n\nSchedule C, Subsection 3\n\n(10) In respect of an estimation of natural local background concentration risk assessment described in section 8,\n\nclauses (8) (b) and (c) and subsection (9) do not apply; and,\n\nin addition to the information specified in clause (8) (a), the pre-submission form must also include information on the methods described in subsections 8 (4) to (9) that will be used to support the natural local background concentration soil standard that will be proposed under subsection 8 (1).\n\nFurther explanation regarding the description of the conceptual site model are provided below.\n\nPSF Preparation Requirements - Drawings\n\nThe PSF is comprised of a completed form and attached drawings. Drawings that support and elaborate on the content of the form are to include a scale site plan, one or more cross-sections of the property and other line drawings, including pictures, line art, flow diagrams, text and tabulated data at the discretion of the proponent and QP.\n\nThe goal of the drawings is to provide a three dimensional illustration (site area and depth) of the subsurface hydrogeological conditions, contaminant sources, extent of contamination, transport pathways, receptors and routes of exposure which, together, comprise a preliminary conceptual site model. The soil layers and groundwater units identified on the PSF should be clearly identified in the drawing(s). Combined with the information provided in the form, the drawings are intended to convey to the ministry the risk assessment team’s current understanding of the types and location of hazards, potential exposure pathways and barriers within pathways, and the type and location of potential receptors consistent with the proposed land use. Sufficient site information data should be provided to determine if there is adequate knowledge of the site on which to base a risk assessment consistent with the illustrated conceptual site model and the planned risk assessment approach.\n\nIt is suggested that a location map showing the property in context to the local neighbourhood and adjacent land uses be included.\n\nThe proponent should include with the PSF any additional supporting information, which may not be site-specific or compliant with the regulation but which they believe provides additional information to support the proposed risk assessment as well as any plans for the collection of additional information.\n\nIn developing and illustrating a conceptual site model, the qualified person should consider;\n\nwhether site and local knowledge are sufficient to support the geological and hydrogeological interpretation. For example;\n\nare all contaminant sources identified?\n\nhave contaminant plumes been adequately delineated and characterized for the purpose of the risk assessment?\n\nwhether sampled media and sample locations address all potential transport pathways\n\nwhether a pathway can be considered incomplete or non-existent based on the intrinsic physical/chemical properties of the contaminant and the natural geology/ hydrology of the site\n\nwhether a pathway can be considered incomplete based on the presence of a barrier (current and / or designed as part of the proposed land use) which relies on human intervention;\n\nfor the creation of the barrier and/or,\n\nto communicate knowledge of the importance of the barrier on human or ecological exposure to future site owners/users as a measure to prevent future disruption or deterioration of its effectiveness\n\nwhether all potential receptors, including sensitive receptors (for example children, pregnant woman, person with asthma), have been identified on and off the property\n\nwhether the models to be used;\n\nare suited to the conceptual site model,\n\nwill have adequate site data to support assumptions\n\nThe conceptual site model presented in the PSF is considered to be a preliminary model which will be confirmed, possibly modified, at the time of submission of the risk assessment.\n\nPSF Preparation Requirements Other Attached Documents\n\nThe proponent may attach other documents which they believe support the risk assessment approach. This would include any documentation which supports deviation from best practice or regulatory requirements, if any are contemplated at the time of PSF submission, for consideration by the Director. They would also include plans for additional data collection, if any are contemplated at the time of PSF submission.\n\nThe proponent may also include in the PSF any toxicological information relating to potential adverse human health effects and surrogate ecological test species, if these have been considered at the time of submitting the PSF, on which the proponent wishes to seek ministry comment. For example, if at the time of preparing the PSF the RA team has selected surrogate species which they intend to represent the site VEC's they may provide by way of a table the VEC's selected for the site (a subset of the species present on the site) and the species selected from the literature to be used for determining the toxicity reference value (i.e., whether dog or rat toxicity data will be used to represent red fox).\n\nIf a public communication plan has been developed at the time of the PSF submission, this may be attached for the ministry comment.\n\nIf the QPRA has not previously self declared their qualifications to the ministry, the PSF will have attached the resume, work references and post-secondary transcripts that support the QPRA declaration. While attached to the PSF submission, the QPRA qualifications should be bound separately from the rest of the PSF material and provided to the ministry as a single copy, so that it can easily be separated from the rest of the submission and handled in a manner which respects the privacy of the QPRA. If a QPRA has previously self declared, they are not required to attach supporting documentation to subsequent PSFs.\n\n1.4.2 Public Communication\n\nThe RA property owner is encouraged to prepare a public communication plan, which includes both the general public and the local municipality when choosing the risk assessment approach. This Procedure document uses the term \"public communication\" to include both consultation and notification.\n\nNotification of the RA approach to the municipality is required where the QPRA intends to prepare an RA that assumes groundwater under the RA site does not or will not serve as a municipal water supply for a drinking water system and non-potable standards are to be developed.\n\nThe RA property owner is required to provide broader public communication in situations where the ministry District Office has indicated by way of comment on the Pre-Submission Form, that the site is located in a wider area of abatement. The property owner should also undertake public communication if there is a likelihood of contaminant migration off the RA property and in relation to any property for which risk management is being proposed. Where public communication is undertaken, a summary of any public input must be provided to the ministry.\n\nIn general, public communication is beneficial to the site redevelopment process. The proponent is encouraged to consider public communication as early as possible in the process of site assessment and redevelopment. Minimum requirements for reporting on public communication as part of the risk assessment are provided in Schedule C, Table 1 of the RSC Regulation, and are reproduced below.\n\nReport Section Heading Sub-Heading Minimum Requirements 8. Public Communication Plan (if applicable) Public Communication Plan Optional Communication Plans\n\nIf owner has implemented a plan to consult the public as part of the development of the risk assessment, provide,\n\na description of the plan, including any opportunities given to the public to comment on the proposed risk assessment;\n\na summary of the comments received during the consultation; and\n\na description of how the public comments were considered as part of the risk assessment process.\n\n8. Public Communication Plan (if applicable) Public Communication Plan Required Communication Plans For RA Properties in Wider Area of Abatement\n\nIf the risk assessment has been identified by the Ministry as relating to a property located within a wider area of abatement under section 10, the risk assessment shall include,\n\na description of the public communication plan required by clause 10 (2) (b) including any opportunities given to the public to comment on the proposed risk assessment;\n\na summary of the comments received during consultation under the plan;\n\na description of how the public comments were considered as part of the risk assessment process; and\n\na copy of all the written comments received from the Ministry under clause 10 (2) (a).\n\nIf public communication is planned, the ministry recommends that whenever possible, the RA property owner include the public communication plan in the PSF. This communication plan should, as a minimum provide for:\n\nnotification of the owners of neighbouring properties that a risk assessment will be undertaken, and\n\nprovision for input to the risk assessment process by the local community.\n\nAny written input offered by the community should be recorded and attached to the submitted risk assessment report as an Appendix.\n\nThe specific conditions and situation at each RA property should always be considered in determining the methods and the extent of public communication required, and the appropriate response to community input. Ideally, public concerns should be addressed throughout the risk assessment process.\n\nThe property owner should consider the goals listed below when designing and implementing a public communication plan:\n\nProviding an explanation of the process to be followed including the inter-relationship of the Phase one ESA, Phase two ESA, risk assessment work and remediation of the RA property, the steps to be followed at each phase, the proposed timing and the opportunities for public input;\n\nProviding a forum for receiving public input and information on potential contamination at the RA property;\n\nProviding initial and ongoing information to the public as needed, on the nature and extent of RA property contamination and the activities proposed for risk assessment and including any risk management requirements (the ministry recommends that at least 30 days notice of property activity be provided to affected stakeholders);\n\nAllowing public input on plans for addressing risk, including the basis for the property specific standards developed through risk assessment and ongoing management and monitoring if warranted; and\n\nAllowing the public to provide input on the risk associated with the parts of the proposed remedial work plan, such as soil excavation, treatment and/or transportation, which may generate dust or have impacts on other exposure pathways that may affect workers or local residents.\n\nExamples of methods which can be considered for inclusion in a communication plan are:\n\nPosting a notice on the RA property;\n\nAdvertising in the local newspapers or community bulletins;\n\nDelivering flyers or newsletters door to door;\n\nUsing dedicated telephone lines to provide or receive information;\n\nPlacing material in local libraries, community centres or establishing a temporary local office;\n\nHolding public meetings, information sessions or an open house;\n\nEstablishing a public liaison committee; and/or\n\nAny other method of consultation or notification that, in the opinion of the QPRA, is adequate.\n\nSection 2. Preparation Of A Risk Assessment Report\n\nRisk assessment (RA) reports must meet the requirements of the RSC Regulation as set out in Schedule C, O. Reg 153/04. The RA process must include both human health and ecological risk assessments in a single report. Under the RSC Regulation, the RA report now includes the following sections:\n\nSection 1 - Summary of Recommendations/Findings\n\nSection 2 - Risk Assessment Team Membership\n\nSection 3 - Property Information, Site Plan and Geological Interpretation\n\nSection 4 - Human Health Risk Assessment (HHRA)\n\nSection 5 - Ecological Risk Assessment (ERA)\n\nSection 6 - Conclusions/Recommendations\n\nSection 7 - Risk Management Plan (RMP) if applicable\n\nSection 8 - Public Communication Plan if applicable\n\nAppendices - including Certified Statements\n\nThe RA report must include the headings, sub-headings and minimum requirements as stated in Table 1, Schedule C of the RSC Regulation. Other headings, sub-headings or other information considered relevant may also be included in the RA report. The move towards a standard RA report format will improve consistency in RA submissions and reduce the time required for the ministry to complete reviews.\n\nOpportunities for Report Revisions\n\nThe ministry will advise the QPRA as early as possible in the review process if more information is needed in the review of RAs. Resubmission, or submission of additional information, may have an impact on the time required for ministry review. Provisions for making changes or additions to the RA report are set out in the RSC Regulation Section 46. At the Director’s discretion, proponents will have the opportunity to provide the requested information in an advised limited period of time or resubmit the entire report setting the timeline back to the beginning. Alternatively the proponent may choose to withdraw the submission. Failure to respond to the Director’s notice to provide the requested revision may prevent the risk assessment from being accepted by the Director.\n\nIf a risk assessment is not accepted by notice of the Director under section 168.5 of the EPA, the proponent may choose to submit a revised risk assessment or choose not to pursue the risk assessment option. If a revised risk assessment is submitted after the Director has issued a decision notice under section 168.5 of the EPA, it must be provided as a new risk assessment, starting with a new PSF, for consideration by the ministry. The basis for not accepting a risk assessment will be provided by letter in all circumstances.\n\nGeneral Report Requirements\n\nIn the preparation of a RA report, reference should be made to the RSC Regulation, and in particular to the following sections;\n\nSchedule C Part I \"Mandatory Requirements\"\n\nSection 4 \"Mandatory Requirements of Risk Assessment Reports\"\n\nSection 5 \"Mandatory Certifications\"\n\nSchedule C Table 1 \"Mandatory Requirements For Risk Assessment Reports\"\n\nAdditional requirements for those risk assessments which are subject to transition from the former Guideline for Use at Contaminated Sites in Ontario (1996) are provided in the RSC Regulation section 44 \"Risk Assessment Form\" and section 45 \"Transition\". Other unique circumstances may be subject to Schedule C section 11 \"Exemption\".\n\nGuidance on the RA Report Sections \"Risk Assessment Team\" and \"Public Communication\" as specified in Schedule C Table 1 has been provided in Section 1 of this Procedure document for reference at an early stage in the risk assessment process.\n\nGeneral guidance on reporting the risk assessment outcome and meeting the requirements of the \"Summary and Recommendations\", \"Conclusions and Recommendations\" Report Sections of Schedule C Table 1, as well as \"Appendices\" as specified in Schedule C section 4, is provided in the following sections (Sections 2.1 to 2.3) of this Procedures document.\n\nGeneral guidance on conducting a risk assessment to support filing a RSC, including how to report on the geological setting and contaminants of concern to meet the requirements of \"Property Information, Site Plan and Geological Interpretation\", is provided in Section 3 of this procedure document.\n\nDetailed guidance on conducting HHRAs and ERAs and presenting the results in accordance with the RSC Regulation are provided in Sections 4 and 5 of this Procedures document, respectively.\n\nAdditional report sections which may be required are \"Risk Management Plan\" and \"Public Communication Plan\". Guidance on preparing these sections is provided in Sections 6 and Section 1.4.2 of this Procedures document, respectively.\n\nA control document called a Certificate of Property Use (CPU) may, at the Director’s discretion, be issued. For this reason, if a risk management plan is included in the RA report, a summary of the Risk Management Plan should be provided with the RA report to facilitate Environmental Bill of Rights (EBR) posting for public comments, as part of the approval process. The summary may be posted, as received by the ministry, as a requirement being considered by the Director.\n\n2.1 Summary and Recommendations\n\nAs set out in the RSC Regulation, Section 1 of the RA report must provide a summary including the findings of the HHRA and ERA. This section will form the basis of information to be entered into the Brownfields Environmental Site Registry in support of filing a RSC. The information will also assist processing of the risk assessment review. Any deviations from information which was provided previously to the ministry in the PSF must be identified. Property-specific standards, risk assessment assumptions, and risk management requirements are also stated in this section. The minimum requirements for the Summary and Recommendations Section are provided in Table 1 Report Section 1 \"Summary and Recommendations\" of the RSC Regulation, Schedule C, and are reproduced below.\n\nReport Section Heading Sub-Heading Minimum Requirements 1. Summary of Recommendations / Findings Risk Assessment Objectives and Approach Summarize the risk assessment objectives, including those specified in report section 4 (Human Health Risk Assessment) and report section 5 (Ecological Risk Assessment)Summarize the type or types of risk assessment approaches taken to meet the objectives. 1. Summary of Recommendations / Findings Deviations from Pre-submission Form\n\nDescribe in detail any deviations from the information provided in the pre-submission form including,\n\nany changes to the conceptual site model that was submitted as part of the form;\n\nwhether there has been a change in the type of risk assessment approach identified in the form; and,\n\nwhether another computer model was used other than the model specified in the form.\n\n1. Summary of Recommendations / Findings Risk Assessment Standards State the proposed standard specified in the risk assessment for each contaminant of concern. 1. Summary of Recommendations / Findings Risk Assessment Assumptions State the assumptions used in determining each standard specified in the risk assessment, including property use assumptions. 1. Summary of Recommendations / Findings Risk Management Requirements State the risk management measures and on-going monitoring , maintenance and contingency plan requirements, if applicable.\n\nThe standards specified in the risk assessment (proposed property specific standards), risk assessment assumptions and risk management measures are preferably to be listed in table form. Risk assessment assumptions should highlight key assumptions which place limits on the out come of the risk assessment, i.e. the assumptions made in the risk assessment which are critical to the acceptability of these standards (for example sensitive model parameters, risk management measures, property use assumptions).\n\nReport Section 2 requires information on the \"Risk Assessment Team\". For guidance on how to complete this section please refer to Section 1.3.2 of this document.\n\nGuidance on how to complete Report Sections 3 through 5 is provided in Sections 3 to 5 in this document.\n\n2.2 Conclusions and Recommendations\n\nConduct of the risk assessment will include separate assessments for HHRA and ERA based on a single geological interpretation of the site and conceptual site model. Guidance for conducting and reporting on those assessments follow in sections 3, 4 and 5 of this procedure document. The conclusions and recommendations of the RA report must therefore summarize and consolidate the findings of the HHRA and ERA and propose the property specific standards to be used for filing a RSC. Minimum requirements for conclusions and recommendations (Section 6) of the RA report are provided in Table 1 of the RSC Regulation, Schedule C, and are reproduced below.\n\nReport Section Heading Sub-Heading Minimum Requirements 6. Conclusions / Recommendations Recommended Standards A standard must be specific in the risk assessment for each contaminant of concern. The specified standard shall be, at a minimum, the more stringent of the human health standard and the ecological standard being proposed for the RA property.\n\nIn the case of an estimation of natural local background concentration risk assessment, the specified standard shall be the local background concentration soil standard proposed under subsection 8 (1).\n\nState critical assumptions on which the standards specified in the risk assessment rely, having regard to the discussion of uncertainty in the “Risk Characterization” in report sections 4 (Human Health Risk Assessment) and 5 (Ecological Risk Assessment). 6. Conclusions / Recommendations Special Considerations for Ground Water Standards If a standard being proposed in the risk assessment for ground water in or under the RA property is greater than 50% of the solubility limit, demonstrate the risk of free product formation and propose any risk management measures necessary in order to mitigate the formation of free product.\n\n2.2.1 Recommend Property-Specific Soil and/or Ground Water Standards\n\nIt is not sufficient for the RA report to demonstrate that risk to human health and the environment is acceptable or negligible. Schedule C of the RSC Regulation requires that all risk assessments specify a property-specific soil and/or ground water standard (numerical value) for each COC identified in the Phase two ESA and Report Section 3 of the RA report. This is necessary because a Qualified Person (QPESA), when filing a RSC, is required to enter the maximum concentration of every COC at the RA property. The Brownfields Environmental Site Registry requires a standard for each COC for comparison purposes.\n\nA recommended tabular format for summarizing the proposed property specific standards in the RA report is provided in the example below.\n\nProposed Standards for Industrial Land Use Environmental media Contaminant Of Concern Maximum Concentration Applicable Site Condition Standardfootnote 1[1] Recommended Property Specific Standard Dominant exposure pathway(s) Risk management requirement Potential for off-site exceedance of SCS Soil (full depth) lead 2215 µg/g 1000 µg/g 2300µg/g Human dermal exposure Yes, surface cover No Ground Water (non-potable) lead 40 µg/L 32 µg/L 40 µg/L Aquatic biota off site No No\n\nSpecial considerations may apply if the risk assessment determines that existing contaminant concentrations on the property present acceptable or negligible risk. The QPRA can propose either the maximum site concentration (measured or estimated) as the property-specific standard, or the concentration below which adverse effects would not occur (effects-based standard), as predicted by the risk assessment. In either case the concentration proposed as the standard must be evaluated explicitly in the risk assessment and must not interfere with the proposed use of the property, as certified in the RSC.\n\nGuidance related to excessively high property specific standards\n\nFor the purpose of clear communication to public stakeholders through the Brownfields Environmental Site Registry, the ministry expects that the proposed standard will not exceed a reasonable upper estimate of the actual concentrations remaining on the property at the time the standards are to be used to file a RSC. The ministry also expects that the proposed standard will respect public expectations regarding aesthetics (taste, odour, visibility). The ministry will not accept a concentration which is not physically possible (greater than 100% i.e. pure chemical compound) as a property specific standard. This clarity is important for fostering public and commercial confidence in the risk assessment process.\n\nFor the purpose of clarity in the risk assessment review process, it is the ministry’s preference that the standard specified in a risk assessment be no greater than an estimate (for example based on measured sample variance) of the maximum concentration existing on the property at the time of undertaking the risk assessment.\n\nIf a standard specified in a risk assessment exceeds the maximum concentration on the property by a significant amount, the property owner should be aware that the risk management measures required in conjunction with that standard may be more onerous than what is required for the actual contamination present. Risk management measures are required in conjunction with the standard, not the Phase two ESA data, and must apply to the entire property area to which the standard (and the RSC) applies. They must be sufficient to manage risk to all receptors (human and ecological) due to contamination of all portions of the property at the concentration proposed as the standard. Risk management measures may be allocated to a portion of the property only where site characterization clearly demonstrates that the rest of the property meets some other approved standard such as the applicable site condition standards published by the ministry.\n\nThorough site characterization therefore should be considered as a more efficient and effective approach to managing site uncertainty than the use of risk management alone.\n\nGuidance related to the use of multiple standards at a property\n\nIf it has been demonstrated that contamination on some portion of the property does not require risk management, or requires a different risk management strategy, the property owner may choose from two alternative approaches;\n\nRisk management may be limited, through a CPU, to parts of the property which do not meet the site condition standards published in the document Soil, Ground Water and Sediment Standards for Use Under Part XV.1 of the Environmental Protection Act\n\nSome other lower concentration may be specified in the risk assessment as a separate standard, and a separate RSC filed, for the portion of the property which meets the lower concentration standard. This will require a clear delineation in the risk assessment, including a legal survey of the different RSC property areas.\n\nRisk to all receptors (human and ecological) resulting from each concentration proposed as a standard, on and off site and in the absence of risk management, therefore must be explicitly identified in the risk assessment report in order to justify the extent of the proposed risk management measures.\n\nA single risk assessment may propose one or more property specific standards to support filing more than one RSC. In such a case, the RSC properties should be clearly delineated in the risk assessment by way of a legally surveyed property description. The separate RSC may refer to surveyed portions of a single property or may refer to separate properties owned by one or more property owners. If more than one property owner is involved, each property must be the subject of Phase one and Phase two ESAs and the owners of all RSC properties must have signed and submitted the PSF related to the single risk assessment.\n\nThe Brownfields Environmental Site Registry can identify only one standard per land use for each RSC property description.\n\nGuidance related to the assessment of off site risk\n\nUnder the RSC Regulation, the potential effects of a property specific standard on neighbouring off-site properties must be considered as part of the risk assessment and review process. Any expectation that a proposed property specific standard will result in an exceedance of the appropriate full depth site condition standards on a neighbouring property must be assessed and explicitly reported.\n\nAs part of the Certified Statements in the RA report Appendices, the QPRA must certify whether meeting the property-specific standards will result in an exceedance of the appropriate full depth site condition standards at the closest off-site receptor (human or ecological). For a given COC, the ministry’s response to the potential for any off-site exceedance of the soil and/or ground water site condition standard will be determined on a case-by-case basis by the ministry District Office, which will prioritize any action that may be warranted on a specific property, considering the potential human health and ecological risk level, social and economic impacts.\n\nProperty specific standards applicable to off-site properties are not accepted by the Director under the RSC Regulation. If standards are to be proposed as a result of a risk assessment for any property, the conduct of the risk assessment should have the explicit agreement of that property owner who has signed and submitted a PSF to the Director. The RSC process does allow for a single risk assessment to be conducted on behalf of several property owners, jointly submitted by those owners to the Director and, if accepted, used for filing separate RSC based on the legal descriptions of the individual properties.\n\n2.2.2 Special Considerations for Ground Water Standards\n\nMandatory risk management is no longer automatic if the ground water concentration for a given chemical parameter exceeds the 50% solubility concentration. Nevertheless, as indicated in Table 1 of the RSC Regulation, risk management measures may be required, based on a demonstration of the risk of free product formation and the need for mitigation.\n\nFree product on a site should be removed to the extent technologically practicable. Standards specified in a risk assessment should not result in the formation of free petroleum hydrocarbon product. Standards specified for potable groundwater use should not result in a sheen, taste or odour due to petroleum hydrocarbon contamination. Consistent with the approach in place through the 1996 Guideline for Use at Contaminated Site in Ontario, the issuance of a certificate of property use and registration on title through a certificate of requirement will generally be required where risk management is necessary to control potential for free product.\n\nIf no ground water standards are proposed that exceed the 50% solubility concentration and no other special considerations apply, the QPRA should indicate that no special considerations apply to the ground water.\n\n2.3 Appendices\n\nAdditional documents which must be supplied as Appendices to all RA reports are identified in the RSC Regulation Schedule C;\n\nSection 4 \"Mandatory Requirements of Risk Assessment Reports\" and\n\nSection 5 \"Mandatory Certifications\"\n\nA check list of documents to be attached to the RA report is provided below. The QPRA is directed to the regulation regarding the required content of these documents:\n\nMandatory Certifications\n\nPre-Submission Form, ministry response and how ministry concerns, if any, were addressed.\n\nResumes for the QPRA and team technical leads, contact information for work references (employers, colleagues, clients) who can support experience claims of the QPRA.\n\nList of documents relied upon in the preparation of the RA report.\n\nA summary of Phase one and Phase two ESA reports, including justification for the sampling approach, data obtained and data QA/QC evaluation.\n\nA copy of any reports documenting further site investigations conducted for risk assessment purposes (if applicable).\n\nA copy of the written notice of intention to conduct a risk assessment that assumes non-potable ground water condition addressed to the municipality in which the RA property is located, together with a copy of any response from the municipality (if non-potable ground water use was assumed).\n\nAn engineering or hydrogeological report recommending the design of engineering and/or hydrogeological controls, including detailed plans and specifications (if applicable).\n\nOther information may be provided as Appendices to the RA report at the discretion of the QPRA.\n\nSection 3. General Guidance for Conducting Risk Assessments to Support Filing a RSC\n\nDepending on the required scope of the risk assessment, the various components set out in Schedule C of the RSC Regulation may be conducted in a qualitative or quantitative manner. However, the Ministry now requires that a property specific standard be recommended for each COC for inclusion in the Brownfields Environmental Site Registry.\n\nSection 3 of this Procedures document describes the risk assessment procedures common to Human Health Risk Assessments (HHRA) and Ecological Risk Assessments (ERA), while Sections 4 and 5 describe procedures specific to HHRA and ERA, respectively. Section 7 describes alternative procedures that may be used for risk assessment under certain specified conditions.\n\n3.1 Principal Elements of Risk Assessment (HHRA and ERA)\n\nAll risk assessments must include all of the following four elements for both HHRA and ERA:\n\nProblem Formulation/Hazard Identification/Receptor Characterization\n\nExposure Assessment,\n\nToxicity/Hazard Assessment for contaminants with complete exposure pathways, and\n\nRisk Characterization.\n\nThe elements of ERA and HHRA may be given different names. They may proceed in the sequence as listed or with many feedbacks and overlaps between the different elements.\n\nRequirements of both HHRA and ERA are described in the RSC Regulation. Guidance for the four basic elements will be discussed in detail in subsequent sections. Depending on the objective of the risk assessment, individual elements may be conducted in a qualitative or quantitative manner.\n\n3.2 Risk Assessment Objectives\n\nFor each of the HHRA and the ERA the QPRA must provide a statement of the objective of the risk assessment. The risk assessment objectives determine the most appropriate procedures to follow in undertaking the risk assessment, the necessary data quality to meet the objectives and whether uncertainty in site specific property knowledge could prevent the risk assessment from meeting the objectives. For example, if the objective of the risk assessment is to demonstrate that Table 2 site condition standards are suitable for use at a particular environmentally sensitive area, uncertainty in some site specific detail may have little impact on meeting this objective provided conservative qualitative assumptions are used.\n\nA statement of the objective of the risk assessment includes, but is not limited to, identifying the proposed use of the RA property, the receptors and exposure pathways to be assessed and choosing from the following approaches:\n\nconducting a quantitative risk assessment for the purpose of calculating new property specific standards, or\n\nconducting a qualitative risk assessment for the purpose of justifying the use of existing standard values (ministry site condition standards or standards from other jurisdictions) as property specific standards, or\n\nusing a combination of qualitative and quantitative approaches;\n\nusing the standard risk assessment procedures as described in Sections 4 and 5 of this Procedure document, or\n\nusing one of the alternative risk assessment procedures according to requirements of the RSC Regulation Schedule C Part II and described in Section 7 of this Procedure document. Alternative risk assessment procedures include:\n\nLimited Scope Risk Assessment,\n\nEstimation of Natural Local Background Concentrations,\n\nNew Science Risk Assessment,\n\nWider Area of Abatement Risk Assessment.\n\n3.3 Property Information, Site Plan and Geological Interpretation\n\nThe HHRA and ERA rely on a common description of the property, it’s geological and hydrogeological setting and contamination status. This information is normally collected and reported through Phase one and Phase two ESAs. A summary of this information which supports the approach and assumptions of the human health and ecological risk assessments must be provided with the RA report. Much of this information would have been provided with the PSF to support the preliminary conceptual site model. The information provided with the RA report would confirm or finalize the conceptual site model for use in the HHRA and ERA.\n\nThe third section of the RA report must provide a summary and analysis of information from the Phase one and Phase two ESA, including property information, a site plan and pertinent geological information. The minimum requirements for Section 3 of the RA report are provided in Table 1 Report Section 3 “Property Information, Site Plan and Geological Interpretation” of the RSC Regulation, Schedule C, and reproduced below.\n\nReport Section Heading Sub-Heading Minimum Requirements 3. Property Information, Site Plan and Geological Interpretation Property Information State the property location and ownership\n\nDescribe the general physical characteristics of the property including size of the property and size of contaminated area.\n\nProvide sufficient detail on the property to support the conceptual site model used in the preparation of the risk assessment report, including,\n\na summary of past and current use of property;\n\na summary of past and current use of any relevant property that is adjacent to the property;\n\na description of off-site sources of contaminants of concern and off-site receptors; and,\n\nan indication of the proposed use of property.\n\n3. Property Information, Site Plan and Geological Interpretation Site Plan and Hydrogeological Interpretation of RA Property Provide the site plans, cross-sections and a hydrgeological interpretation of the RA property that satisfies the requirements of clause 3 (8) (a) and that was relied upon in the preparation of the risk assessment and all documentation used to support this interpretation. 3. Property Information, Site Plan and Geological Interpretation Contaminants of Concern List all of the contaminants of concern.\n\nThe contaminants of concern must include the following:\n\nAny contaminants detected on, in or under the RA property that exceed the applicable site condition standards.\n\nAny contaminants detected on, in or under the RA property and for which no applicable site condition standard is prescribed under Part IX (Site Condition Standards and Risk Assessment) of the Regulation.\n\n3. Property Information, Site Plan and Geological Interpretation Contaminants of Concern Sampling Programs With reference to the sampling programs summarized in the appendices to the risk assessment report, describe how the program is adequate for the risk assessment objectives and approach specified in report section 1.\n\nIn the case of an estimation of natural local background concentration risk assessment, specify the methods that were used to estimate the local background concentrations in soil, including details of,\n\nany sampling programs undertaken in accordance with subsections 8 (4) to (8);\n\nany existing geological data, as described in subsection 8 (9) that were used to estimate the natural local background concentrations in place of sampling data.\n\n3.3.1 Property Information\n\nThe property description must provide basic information on the RA property, including a summary of past and current use of the property and a summary of past and current use of all other relevant adjacent properties. The RA team should consider the general physical characteristics of the property (for example, vegetation, soil type, hydrogeology, presence and location of surface water, utility trenches, climate, geologic setting, etc.) and summarize these characteristics into a conceptual site model diagram.\n\n3.3.2 Site Plan and Hydrogeological Interpretation of Risk Assessment Property\n\nIt is the RA team’s responsibility to utilize the results of the Phase one and Phase two ESAs, and any additional investigations required, to determine the hydrogeological setting, and the anticipated contaminant behavior in that setting and to articulate a conceptual site model of contaminant distribution for the property. Sufficient detail must be provided to demonstrate that the site has been adequately characterized and that the site and regional geology, hydrogeology and natural and contaminant geochemistry, are adequately understood to support the development of a conceptual site model and to support the risk assessment and any risk management plan proposed. The RA team must be able to provide a description of routes of potential contaminant transport in the context of property specific characteristics.\n\n3.3.3 Subsurface Transport Component of the Conceptual Site Model\n\nA conceptual site model is defined in the RSC Regulation in Section 3 of Schedule C as comprising specified drawings with explanatory notes (text description). The conceptual site model provides a three-dimensional (area and depth) description of site conditions that illustrates contaminant sources and distributions, release mechanisms, exposure pathways, migration routes and potential receptors. A conceptual site model must show all potential human receptors and valued ecosystem components (VEC) and exposure pathways specific to the site and adjacent properties. Each relevant pathway is to be provided, including those that may be eliminated through risk management measures. The conceptual site model is expected to highlight the effects of any existing or anticipated pathway barrier on potential exposure pathways. Therefore the conceptual site model must distinguish between the routes of exposure which would potentially exist without risk management measures and routes which are expected to exist under conditions which include risk management measures (existing or future pathway barriers).\n\nThe conceptual site model for sub-surface transport provides an organized, three dimensional picture of the hydrogeologic setting (minimum of site plan and cross section). A narrative should be provided to explain the groundwater flow and contaminant behavior, interactions with receptors, as well as consideration of the consequences of natural and human activities.\n\nThe conceptual site model must meet all the requirements specified in Schedule C Section 3 and described in section 1.4.1 of this Procedures document for the PSF. The conceptual site model presented in the RA report should be a finalized and refined version of the model presented in the PSF. Any changes to the conceptual site model which may impact the risk assessment outcome must be identified in Report Section 1 \"Summary of Recommendations/Findings\" under the heading \"Deviations from Pre-Submission Form\".\n\n3.3.4 Contaminants of Concern\n\nIt is intended that the QPRA and the QPESA work together to identify COCs which require the development of property specific standards.\n\nThe selection of chemicals as COC must include all contaminants exceeding site condition standards with reference to the RSC Regulation Part IX \"Site Condition Standards and Risk Assessment\". In addition, the QPRA and the QPESA should consider if the following apply;\n\nAre there any characteristics of the property which may increase the likelihood for one or more contaminants to interfere with the property use beyond that considered in the development of the ministry site condition standards?\n\nAre there any contaminants on the property which may degrade to a more toxic product?\n\nAre there any chemicals measured at the property which do not have site condtions standards published by the ministry?\n\nIf there are chemicals without ministry site condition standards, are they likely to interfere with property use?\n\nBased on consultation with the QPESA, COCs may include one or more contaminants which meet the site condition standards if there is some concern on the part of either QP that they may interfere with the proposed use of the property. The latter may occur if the conceptual site model on which development of the site condition standards was based did not include site specific features which may increase the level of risk to the proposed receptors (for example contaminated groundwater situated within 1 m distance from a building slab). The conceptual site model on which development of the site condition standards was based is described in the document \"Rationale for the Development and Application of Generic Soil, Ground Water and Sediment Criteria for use at Contaminated Sites in Ontario\" (MOE 1996) as updated from time to time.\n\nAlso, based on consultation with the QPESA, COCs may include contaminant degradation products or other chemicals for which there are no published site condition standards and for which there is some concern on the part of either QP that they may interfere with the proposed use of the property.\n\nIf a chemical has been measured at the property which does not have a ministry site condition standard, the QPESA must decide if the chemical is a COC based on an understanding of geoscience. For example, natural elements of the earth’s crust (such as Al, Fe, Ca) may be measured but have no ministry site condition standards. These chemicals are generally ubiquitous in soil at non-toxic concentrations but may become limiting to site use at some concentration. The QPESA must determine within the context of the Phase two ESA if the presence of a chemical without a standard is trivial or if there is potential for concern. If the chemical is of potential concern, the chemical should be evaluated as part of the RA and a property specific standard should be developed. The QP should refer to the following sections in the RSC Regulation for making this determination:\n\nPart IX section 43(3)\n\nSchedule A certifications required in the RSC, including but not limited to\n\nSection 6,\n\nSection 10(3), or\n\nSection 16(2) and 17(3).\n\nWhere a chemical is measured and there is no site condition standard, the QPRA has the following options; 1) submit a new science RA (refer to section 9 of Schedule C on the RSC Regulation and Section 7.3.1 of this document) to propose a property specific standard or 2) to identify in the summary of site investigations in the RA report that, in the opinion of the QPRA and the QPESA, a risk assessment is not required for this contaminant. The certifications made by the QPESA in the RSC will confirm that there is no evidence of contaminants left on the property that will interfere with the proposed use of the site.\n\nThe QPRA must provide in the RA report a brief description of the sampling program, a description of the COCs and justification for determining if contaminants measured on site are not considered COCs. The QPRA should consider the following in identifying COCs:\n\nContaminants identified on the property that exceed the applicable site condition standards. At the discretion of the QPESA, COCs should include chemical parameter(s) for which there is no site condition standard specified in the Soil, Ground Water and Sediment Standards document with reference to Part IX section 43 of the RSC Regulation;\n\nThe hazard profile (see guidance on Toxicity Assessment, Sections 4 and 5 of this Procedure document) of each identified COC and potential degradation products, including but not limited to, adverse effects, environmental fate and transport, persistence and bioaccumulation (for example vinyl chloride can be generated from TCE under anaerobic conditions);\n\nUncertainty that exists in terms of the completeness of the Phase one ESA and/or Phase two ESA and the quality of data to be relied upon in the risk assessment. A contaminant should be considered a potential COC if the QPRA is not confident that the data demonstrates that a pathway is incomplete or that a ministry site condition standard is not exceeded.\n\nSome or all of these COCs may require a detailed quantitative risk assessment in order to justify a property specific standard. Others may be evaluated using a qualitative descriptive approach (non-numeric) or a qualitative screening (numeric) approach.\n\nA risk assessment is not required for contaminants that are not detected or present at concentrations less than the detection limits identified in Analytical Methods Used in the Assessment of Properties Under Part XV.1 of the EPA.\n\n3.3.4.1 Screening Process for Quantitative Risk Assessment\n\nFor certain properties the list of COCs which potentially require a quantitative assessment may be lengthy. The QPRA may wish to reduce the number of COCs to be carried through the quantitative calculation of risk. An acceptable technique for assessing contaminants for detailed quantitative risk assessment is to conduct a screening assessment on the contaminants at the property. A screening assessment is a preliminary tool with specific purposes as follows:\n\nTo identify if, in the opinion of the QPRA, there is an insignificant likelihood of risk to human health or the natural environment; and/or\n\nTo assist in determining the scope of the risk assessment.\n\nFor the purposes listed above, a screening assessment may be undertaken as part of the problem formulation step and may be presented with the PSF. The results of this process are qualitative or semi-quantitative only and can be used only in contaminant selection, eliminating irrelevant routes and/or pathways of exposure or irrelevant receptors for further consideration in the risk assessment and in justifying standards developed through some other process . The result of any screening assessment must be reported as a qualitative risk assessment in the risk assessment report.\n\nThe main principle in screening or short-listing COCs is that all potential COCs without site condition standards should be included for detailed assessment (together with all contaminants exceeding the applicable site condition standards) unless there is information that supports exclusion. The following principles are to be used as guidance when considering a screening approach.\n\nIf a screening process is employed the following should be provided:\n\nThe complete list of COCs found on the RA property, including a summary of the monitoring data and detection limit for each COC and illustration of the spatial distribution of COCs on the property,\n\nThe process for screening which COCs are to be followed through quantitative calculations in further steps in the risk assessment process; specifically, toxicity/hazard assessment and exposure assessment, and\n\nAn appropriate property specific standard recommended for all COCs found on the property, including those deemed to present no significant risk through a screening process. The recommended property specific standard must be determined from some means other than the screening method (see section 2.2.1 and sections 4 and 5 of this procedure document).\n\nWhen considering information to support exclusion, it should be noted that COCs lacking site condition standards should be included for quantitative assessment when these COCs are:\n\nKnown or probable carcinogens;\n\nContaminants for which no human threshold has been established by a credible agency (see Section 4.3.2 of this Procedure document);\n\nContaminants which are present at toxic concentrations and don't degrade or metabolize; and/or\n\nContaminants which degrade to other contaminants which may then be present at toxic concentrations.\n\nScreening assessment is a type of qualitative risk assessment. The screening process uses risk assessment techniques, however, screening assessments are usually based on a 'worst case scenario' instead of verifiable property specific conditions. For example, the screening assessment could use maximum concentrations in each exposure pathway and maximum exposure periods and the physical/chemical characteristics of the most toxic isomer or member of a chemical group. A screening assessment should contain the same elements as a quantitative risk assessment: i.e., 1) Problem Formulation, 2) Exposure Assessment, 3) Toxicity Assessment and 4) Risk Characterization. However, screening assessments cannot provide a quantitative estimate of risk or back-calculate a property specific standard.\n\nA screening assessment may include a consideration of criteria from another reputable jurisdiction, together with an assessment of the basis of that criterion, as part of the screening process. Maximum concentrations found on site can also be proposed as property specific standards, as described in Section 2.2.1 of this procedure document, for COC which pose negligible risk based on a screening assessment.\n\nA comparison of the types of standards which may be supported by a screening assessment with those which may be supported by the quantitative approach and the non-numeric qualitative approach are summarized in the table below. The suitability of a particular approach for a particular circumstance must be explained in the risk assessment. The ministry will consider whether a particular approach is suitable as part of the risk assessment review.\n\nType of property specific standard Qualitative risk assessment – non numeric\n\n(descriptive) Qualitative risk assessment – numeric\n\n(conservative screening assessment) Quantitative risk assessment Effects-based level (back-calculation) no no yes – with considerations identified in Section 2.2.1 Site maximum concentration yes – eliminate receptors and pathways yes – determine if risk is insignificant yes – calculate risk Ministry site condition standard yes – justify SCS for sensitive receptor / pathway yes – determine if risk of SCS is insignificant for sensitive receptor/pathway yes – calculate risk of SCS in non-generic situation Modified ministry site condition standard yes – eliminate pathway(s) yes – eliminate pathway(s) yes – eliminate or modify pathway(s) Adopted standard from other jurisdiction yes – justify adopted standard yes – determine if risk of adopted standard is insignificant yes – calculate risk of adopted standard\n\n3.3.4.2 Summary of Sampling Program\n\nAll risk assessments are dependent on the quality of information provided through the property characterization, carried out in the Phase one and Phase two ESAs and any other investigations, and the associated uncertainty in the supporting toxicological and exposure information. At a minimum, Phase one and two ESAs must be conducted in accordance with CSA standards as modified by the RSC Regulation. Other studies relating to sediments, surface water and biota may also be required to support a risk assessment. These should be conducted with consideration of the most recent ministry guidance and best scientific practice.\n\nThe RA report must include a summary of the Phase one and two sampling programs, specifically considering data quality, uncertainty and suitability of the data for use in the RA, and details of any additional sampling undertaken to support the RA. On a case by case basis the ministry may request additional information or copies of Phase one or two ESAs and/or other relevant site reports that the ministry deems necessary for review. Characterization of the RA property and COCs in the RA report should fully document the following:\n\nwhat investigation methods were used;\n\nwhat portions of the property or environmental media remain uncharacterized, if any;\n\nhow the risk assessment objective can be addressed through the use of available information;\n\nthe quality assurance/quality control procedures used; and\n\nan analysis of the sources, relative magnitude and implications of uncertainty in the data obtained.\n\n3.3.4.3 Data Quality Assessment\n\nQuality assurance and control is necessary in both sample collection and sample analysis to ensure that the data utilized in a risk assessment is representative of the site conditions on a RA property. The collection and analyses of environmental data in Phase two ESAs should be carried out in accordance with the CSA Phase II ESA Standard (CAN/CSA Z769-00) as modified by the RSC Regulation. The data quality objectives which the site assessment information should meet are specific to the issues addressed by the risk assessment and are to be determined by the QPRA as part of the risk assessment.\n\nThe RSC Regulation requires that the QPRA demonstrate that the data used for the HHRA and ERA is sufficient to meet the objectives of the assessments. In the RA report the RA Team should discuss the completeness of all data sets and indicate whether appropriate analytical methods were utilized (for example, the methods comply with Section 47 \"Analytical Procedures\" of the RSC Regulation and the method detection limits were met).\n\nThe RA Team is expected to use standard data quality measures of representatively and reproducibility (accuracy and precision) when evaluating the data. The RA team should consult the sampling guidance portions (section 5 through 7 and section 9) of the former guidance document \"Guidance on Sampling and Analytical Methods for use at Contaminated Sites in Ontario\" (MOE 1996) and any replacement guidance as updated from time to time.\n\nThe required QA/QC data quality objectives will be dependent on the sensitivity of the risk assessment outcome to uncertainty in the data. The QPRA and QPESA should exercise professional judgment in selection of appropriate techniques to obtain representative samples and achieve the risk assessment objective. The designer of the sampling program should have expertise in the design of sampling for the subject environmental medium.\n\nIt should be noted that it is the responsibility of the QPRA to ensure that all analytical results used to support critical assumptions in the risk assessment must comply with Section 47 \"Analytical Procedures\" of the RSC Regulation. In addition, the QPRA should always be diligent about the quality of analytical results obtained from a laboratory. If historical investigations on a risk assessment property included analysis of samples which may be questionable the QPRA should clearly identify these analyses in the risk assessment and provide the ministry with confirmatory analysis and assurances that the questionable samples have not been relied upon in any way in the risk assessment.\n\n3.3.4.4 Site Investigation and Currency of Property Data\n\nProperty characterization data used in the assessment should reflect the most recent site conditions. This is to assist the QPRA in ensuring that certified statements in the risk assessment report relate to site conditions which are still relevant at the time of signing the report.\n\nSubstantial time may elapse between an initial Phase two ESA, the initiation of the risk assessment and the submission of a RA report. The RA Team should satisfy themselves that contaminants of concern concentrations on the site and the problem formulation/hazard assessment used in the risk assessment represent site conditions at the time the risk assessment report is completed and signed.\n\nInformation contained in the RA report, including the description of site conditions, COCs and ecotoxicity tests, should include measurements carried out within the two years prior to submission. Two years is proposed based on a typical period which may elapse between initiating a site assessment and submitting a risk assessment report. If the Phase two investigation was conducted earlier than two years from RA submission, the QPRA should assess the data and confirm with more recent sampling any information which may have changed, potentially impacting the risk assessment outcome. The use of older data is ultimately left up to the judgment of the QPs, as two years may be sufficient or insufficient, depending on the contaminant, receptors and site circumstances.\n\nAdditional characterization may be undertaken, such as collection of additional property or receptor characterization data, to reduce uncertainty in the overall risk assessment so that the RA results will be useful for making meaningful risk management decisions.\n\nSection 4. Requirements Specific to Human Health Risk Assessment (HHRA)\n\n4.1 Problem Formulation Component of HHRA\n\nThe first component in the HHRA is Problem Formulation. The minimum requirements for the Problem Formulation component of HHRA are provided in Table 1 of the RSC Regulation, Schedule C and are reproduced below.\n\nReport Section Heading Sub-Heading Minimum Requirements 4. Human Health Risk Assessment (HHRA) Problem Formulation Human Health Conceptual Site Model\n\nProvide a human health conceptual site model that,\n\nsatisfies the requirements of clause 3 (8) (b);\n\nexplains how the information provided under report section 3 was incorporated into the human health conceptual site model; and,\n\nwas relied upon in the preparation of the risk assessment.\n\n4. Human Health Risk Assessment (HHRA) Problem Formulation Risk Assessment Objectives\n\nState the objectives of the human health risk assessment and include an indication of,\n\nthe proposed use of the RA property\n\nthe receptors and exposure pathways to be assessed by the human health risk assessment\n\nwhether a qualitative or quantitative assessment of risk or both will be used in the human health risk assessment; and\n\nthe type of approach used for the human health risk assessment.\n\nDemonstrate that the data used for the human health risk assessment is sufficient to meet the objectives of the assessment, having regard to,\n\nthe data quality objectives specified in the reports on the sampling program summarized in the appendices to the risk assessment report; and\n\nany other relevant information the qualified person has gathered or obtained in conducting the assessment.\n\nState how any uncertainty resulting from variable data, poor data quality or gaps in data in relation to the RA property affected,\n\nthe setting of objectives for the human health risk assessment; and\n\nthe ability to meet those objectives.\n\n4.1.1 Human Health Conceptual Site Model\n\nThe human health conceptual site model is a physical description of the potential contamination problem to be assessed from a human exposure and health risk perspective. The human health conceptual site model must meet the requirements of the RSC Regulation as described in Schedule C Section 3(8)(b) and Table 1 Report Section 4 \"Human Health Risk Assessment\". Potential receptor populations for the proposed property use must be identified along with all associated potential exposure routes and pathways. For each of the sources of COCs for the RA property, the QPRA must ensure that the conceptual site model identifies 1) the release mechanisms and transport pathways, 2) all human receptors located both on and off the RA property, as well as exposure points and routes of exposure.\n\nThe human health conceptual site model must identify potential exposure pathways for those receptors based on physical/chemical characteristics of the COCs and geological characteristics of the site as identified in the subsurface transport component of the conceptual site model in Report Section 3.\n\nThe human health conceptual site model must clearly distinguish between pathways which are naturally incomplete and those which may be rendered incomplete through risk management measures.\n\nFor each applicable receptor, the RA team should identify all potential on-site and off-site exposure pathways (for example soil ingestion) based on the characteristics and anticipated activities of that receptor and the expected mobility of the potential COCs under the geological conditions present at the site. For each receptor and exposure pathway, the RA team should indicate further if a man-made barrier or measure to interrupt this pathway is present or anticipated.\n\nAny exposure pathways which can be anticipated based on chemical properties and site geology should be included in the risk assessment. Elimination of these pathways from assessment will require justification in the form of pathway-specific site assessment evidence. Pathways which can be anticipated but which will be mitigated by a barrier or other measure should be included for the assessment of risk level. The barrier or other measure must be identified as risk management measures in the development of property-specific criteria.\n\n4.1.2 Risk Assessment Objectives\n\nThe QPRA must provide risk assessment objectives which describe the approach to studying the potential contamination problem (refer to Section 3.2 of this Procedure document) with reference to the human health conceptual site model (Section 4.1.1) and demonstrate that data used in the HHRA are sufficient to meet those objectives. It is important to state whether the RA is a qualitative or quantitative assessment of risk and the type of approach used for the human health risk assessment.\n\nExamples of HHRA Objective Statements would be;\n\nExample 1:\n\n\"The objective of this HHRA is to provide a qualitative demonstration that the Table 2 site condition standards are appropriate to protect human health at this site using a modified generic approach.
