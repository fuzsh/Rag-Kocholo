        "text": "(a) The contract shall contain the paragraph entitled \"Payment\" of the clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Products and Commercial Services. If the contract will provide for contract financing, the contracting officer shall construct a solicitation provision and contract clause. This solicitation provision shall be constructed in accordance with 32.204 or 32.205. If the procedure at 32.205 is used, the solicitation provision at 52.232-31, invitation to Propose Financing Terms, shall be included. The contract clause shall be constructed in accordance with the requirements of this subpart and any agency regulations.\n\n(b) Each contract financing clause shall include:\n\n(1) A description of the-\n\n(i) Computation of the financing payment amounts (see paragraph (c) of this section);\n\n(ii) Specific conditions of contractor entitlement to those financing payments (see paragraph (c) of this section);\n\n(iii) Liquidation of those financing payments by delivery payments (see paragraph (e) of this section);\n\n(iv) Security the contractor will provide for financing payments and any terms or conditions specifically applicable thereto (see 32.202-4); and\n\n(v) Frequency, form, and any additional content of the contractor’s request for financing payment (in addition to the requirements of the clause at 52.232-29, Terms for Financing of Purchases of Commercial Products and Commercial Services; and\n\n(2) Unless agency regulations authorize alterations, the unaltered text of the clause at 52.232-29, Terms for Financing of Purchases of Commercial Products and Commercial Services.\n\n(c) Computation of amounts, and contractor entitlement provisions.\n\n(1) Contracts shall provide that delivery payments shall be made only for completed supplies and services accepted by the Government in accordance with the terms of the contract. Contracts may provide for commercial advance and commercial interim payments based upon a wide variety of bases, including (but not limited to) achievement or occurrence of specified events, the passage of time, or specified times prior to the delivery date(s). The basis for payment must be objectively determinable. The clause written by the contracting officer shall specify, to the extent access is necessary, the information and/or facilities to which the Government shall have access for the purpose of verifying the contractor’s entitlement to payment of contract financing.\n\n(2) If the contract is awarded using the offeror-proposed procedure at 32.205, the clause constructed by the contracting officer under paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall contain the following:\n\n(i) A statement that the offeror’s proposed listing of earliest times and greatest amounts of projected financing payments submitted in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of the provision at 52.232-31, invitation to Propose Financing Terms, is incorporated into the contract, and\n\n(ii) A statement that financing payments shall be made in the lesser amount and on the later of the date due in accordance with the financing terms of the contract, or in the amount and on the date projected in the listing of earliest times and greatest amounts incorporated in the contract.\n\n(3) If the security accepted by the contracting officer is the contractor’s financial condition, the contracting officer shall incorporate in the clause constructed under paragraph (b)(1) of this section the following-\n\n(i) A statement that the contractor’s financial condition has been accepted as adequate security for commercial financing payments; and\n\n(ii) A statement that the contracting officer may exercise the Government’s rights to require other security under paragraph (c), Security for Government Financing, of the clause at 52.232-29, Terms for Financing of Purchases of Commercial Products and Commercial Services, in the event the contractor’s financial condition changes and is found not to be adequate security.\n\n(d) Instructions for multiple appropriations. If contract financing is to be computed for the contract as a whole, and if there is more than one appropriation account (or subaccount) funding payments under the contract, the contracting officer shall include, in the contract, instructions for distribution of financing payments to the respective funds accounts. Distribution instructions and contract liquidation instructions must be mutually consistent.\n\n(e) Liquidation. Liquidation of contract financing payments shall be on the same basis as the computation of contract financing payments; that is, financing payments computed on a whole contract basis shall be liquidated on a whole contract basis; and a payment computed on a line item basis shall be liquidated against that line item. If liquidation is on a whole contract basis, the contracting officer shall use a uniform liquidation percentage as the liquidation method, unless the contracting officer obtains the concurrence of the cognizant payment office that the proposed liquidation provisions can be executed by that office, or unless agency regulations provide alternative liquidation methods.\n\n(f) Prompt payment for commercial purchase payments. The provisions of subpart 32.9, Prompt Payment, apply to contract financing and invoice payments for commercial purchases in the same manner they apply to other than commercial purchases. The contracting officer is responsible for including in the contract all the information necessary to implement prompt payment. In particular, contracting officers must be careful to clearly differentiate in the contract between contract financing and invoice payments and between items having different prompt payment times.\n\n(g) Installment payment financing for commercial products and commercial services. Contracting officers may insert the clause at 52.232-30, Installment Payments for Commercial Products and Commercial Services, in solicitations and contracts in lieu of constructing a specific clause in accordance with paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section, if the contract action qualifies under the criteria at 32.202-1(b) and installment payments for the item are either customary or are authorized in accordance with agency procedures.\n\n(1) Description. Installment payment financing is payment by the Government to a contractor of a fixed number of equal interim financing payments prior to delivery and acceptance of a contract item. The installment payment arrangement is designed to reduce administrative costs. However, if a contract will have a large number of deliveries, the administrative costs may increase to the point where installment payments are not in the best interests of the Government.\n\n(2) Authorized types of installment payment financing and rates. Installment payments may be made using the clause at 52.232-30, Installment Payments for Commercial Products and Commercial Services, either at the 70 percent financing rate cited in the clause or at a lower rate in accordance with agency procedures.\n\n(3) Calculating the amount of installment financing payments. The contracting officer shall identify in the contract schedule those items for which installment payment financing is authorized. Monthly installment payment amounts are to be calculated by the contractor pursuant to the instructions in the contract clause only for items authorized to receive installment payment financing.\n\n(4) Liquidating installment payments. If installment payments have been made for an item, the amount paid to the contractor upon acceptance of the item by the Government shall be reduced by the amount of installment payments made for the item. The contractor’s request for final payment for each item is required to show this calculation.\n\n(a) Each determination concerning advance payments shall be supported by written findings (see 32.402(c)(1)(iii)).\n\n(b) The following is an example of the format and text of findings, determination, and authorization with alternative words, phrases, and paragraphs to be selected to conform to the circumstances involved:\n\nFindings, Determination, and Authorization for Advance Payments\n\nFindings\n\n(a) The undersigned hereby finds that:\n\n(1) The ________________ [Insert the name of the contracting activity] and ________________ [Insert the name of the contractor] (have entered) (propose to enter) into (negotiated) (sealed bid) Contract No.____________, dated __________. [Summarize the specific facts and significant circumstances concerning the contract and the contractor, that, together with the other findings, will clearly support the determination below.]\n\n(2) Advance payments (in an amount not to exceed $______________ at any time outstanding) (in an aggregate amount not exceeding $________, less the aggregate amounts repaid, or withdrawn by the Government) are required by the Contractor to perform under the contract. The amount does not exceed the unpaid contract price or the estimated interim cash needs arising during the reimbursement cycle.\n\n(3) The advance payments are necessary for prompt, efficient contract performance that will benefit the Government.\n\n(4) The proposed advance payment clause provides for security for the protection of the Government. The clause requires that all payments will be deposited in a special account at the Contractor’s financial institution and that the Government will have a paramount lien on (i) the credit balance in the special account, (ii) any supplies contracted for, and (iii)any material or other property acquired for performance of the contract. [Insert the following, if applicable: (The Contractor’s financial management system provides for effective control over and accountability for all Federal funds under governing regulations of the Treasury Department.)(An advance payment bond is required.)] This security is considered adequate.\n\n(5) Advance payments are the only adequate means of financing available to the Contractor, and the amount designated in (2) of this section is based, to the extent possible, on the use of the Contractor’s own working capital in performing the contract. [Insert paragraph(6), (7), or (8), as applicable.]\n\n(6) The Contractor is a nonprofit (educational) (and) (research) institution, and the contract is for (experimental) (,) (research and development) work.\n\n(7) The contract is solely for the management and operation of a Government-owned plant.\n\n(8) The following unusual facts and circumstances favor making advance payments to the Contractor without interest: [List the pertinent facts and circumstances.]\n\nDetermination\n\n(b) Based on the findings in paragraph (a) of this section, the undersigned determined that the making of the proposed advance payments, (with interest at the rate of ______ [Insert the interest rate computed in accordance with 32.407 ] percent on the daily unliquidated balance of the advance payments,) (without interest, except as provided by the proposed advance payment clause,) (is in the public interest) (will facilitate the national defense).\n\nAuthorization\n\n(c) The advance payments, of which (the amount at any time outstanding) (the aggregate amount, less the aggregate amounts repaid, or withdrawn by the Government), shall not exceed $_____________, are hereby authorized under ( 41 U.S.C. chapter 45, Contract Financing) (10 U.S.C. chapter 277) (the Extraordinary Contracting Authority of Government Agencies in Connection with National Defense Functions ( 50 U.S.C.1431-1435) and Executive Order No.10789 of November 14,1958 (3 CFR 1958 Supp. pp. 72-74)) [or, if other, cite appropriate authority] on (terms substantially as contained in the proposed advance payment clause, a copy (an outline) of which is annexed to this authorization) (the following terms:) [Insert the appropriate terms.] (All prior authorizations for advance payments under Contract No. _________ are superseded.)\n\n__________________________________________________ [Signature]\n\n__________________________________________________ [Name Typed]\n\n__________________________________________________ [Titleof Authorized Official]\n\n[Each Findings, Determination, and Authorization shall be individually prepared to fit the particular circumstances at hand.Paragraphs(a)(1), (2), (3) and (4) and paragraphs (b) and (c) shall be used in each case. If the contract is (a) for experimental, developmental or research work and with a nonprofit educational or research institution, or (b) only for management and operation of a Government-owned plant, paragraph (a)(5) should not be included.If the advance payment is to be made without interest to the contractor, include paragraph (a)(6), (7), or (8). If any advance payments have previously been authorized for the contract, include the final sentence of paragraph (c). The alternate parenthetical wording or other modifications may be used as appropriate.The paragraphs actually used shall be renumbered sequentially.]\n\nThe contracting officer must use substantially the following form of agreement for a special account for advance payments:\n\nAgreement for Special Account\n\nThis agreement is entered into this _____ day of _____, 20___, between the United States of America (the Government), represented by the Contracting Officer executing this agreement, _____ [Insert the name of the Contractor], a _____ [Insert the name of the State of incorporation] corporation (the Contractor), and _____, a financial institution operating under the laws of _____, located at ____________ (the financial institution).\n\nRecitals\n\n(a) Under date of _____, 20__, the Government and the Contractor entered into Contract No. _____, or a related supplemental agreement, providing for advance payments to the Contractor. A copy of the advance payment terms was furnished to the financial institution.\n\n(b) The contract or supplemental agreement requires that amounts advanced to the Contractor be deposited separate from the Contractor’s general or other funds, in a Special Account at a member bank of the Federal Reserve System, any \"insured\" bank within the meaning of the Act creating the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( 12 U.S.C.1811), or a credit union insured by the National Credit Union Administration. The parties agree to deposit the amounts with the financial institution, which meets the requirement.\n\n(c) This Special Account is designated \"________ [Insert the Contractor’s name], _____________ [Insert the name of the Government agency] Special Account.\"\n\nCovenants\n\nIn consideration of the foregoing, and for other good and valuable considerations, the parties agree to the following conditions:\n\n(a) The Government shall have a lien on the credit balance in the account to secure the repayment of all advance payments made to the Contractor. The lien is paramount to any lien or claim of the financial institution regarding the account.\n\n(b) The financial institution is bound by the terms of the contract relating to the deposit and withdrawal of funds in the Special Account, but is not responsible for the application of funds withdrawn from the account. The financial institution shall act on written directions from the Contracting Officer, the administering office, or a duly authorized representative of either. The financial institution is not liable to any party to this agreement for any action that complies with the written directions. Any written directions received by the financial institution through the Contracting Officer on _____ [Insert the name of the agency] stationery and purporting to be signed by, or by the direction of _____ or duly authorized representative, shall be, as far as the rights, duties, and liabilities of the financial institution are concerned, considered as being properly issued and filed with the financial institution by the _____ [Insert the name of the agency].\n\n(c) The Government, or its authorized representatives, shall have access to the books and records maintained by the financial institution regarding the Special Account at all reasonable times and for all reasonable purposes, including (but not limited to), the inspection or copying of the books and records and any and all pertinent memoranda, checks, correspondence, or documents. The financial institution shall preserve the books and records for a period of 6 years after the closing of this Special Account.\n\n(d) In the event of the service of any writ of attachment, levy of execution, or commencement of garnishment proceedings regarding the Special Account, the financial institution will promptly notify ______ [Insert the name of the administering office].\n\n(e) While this Special Account exists, the financial institution shall inform the Government each month of the financial institution’s published prime interest rate and changes to the rate during the month. The financial institution shall give this information to the Contracting Officer on the last business day of the month. [This covenant will not be included in the Special Account Agreements covering interest-free advance payments.]\n\nEach of the parties to this agreement has executed the agreement on _________________, 20____.\n\n__________________________________________________ __________________________________________________\n\n[Signatures and Official Titles]\n\n(a) Subcontracts may include either performance-based payments, provided they meet the criteria in 32.1003, or progress payments, provided they meet the criteria in subpart 32.5 for customary progress payments, but not both. Subcontracts for commercial purchases may include commercial product or commercial service purchase financing terms, provided they meet the criteria in 32.202-1.\n\n(b) The contractor’s requests for progress payments may include the full amount of commercial product or commercial service purchase financing payments, performance-based payments, or progress payments to a subcontractor, whether paid or unpaid, provided that unpaid amounts are limited to amounts determined due and that the contractor will pay-\n\n(1) In accordance with the terms and conditions of a subcontract or invoice; and\n\n(2) Ordinarily within 30 days of the submission of the contractor’s progress payment request to the Government.\n\n(c) If the contractor is considering making unusual progress payments to a subcontractor, the parties will be guided by the policies in 32.501-2. If the Government approves unusual progress payments for the subcontract, the contracting officer must issue a contract modification to specify the new rate in paragraph (j)(6) of the clause at 52.232-16, Progress Payments, in the prime contract. This will allow the contractor to include the progress payments to the subcontractor in the cost basis for progress payments by the Government. This modification is not a deviation and does not require the clearance prescribed in 32.502-2(b).\n\n(d) The contractor has a duty to ensure that financing payments to subcontractors conform to the standards and principles prescribed in paragraph (j) of the Progress Payments clause in the prime contract. Although the contracting officer should, to the extent appropriate, review the subcontract as part of the overall administration of progress payments in the prime contract, there is no special requirement for contracting officer review or consent merely because the subcontract includes financing payments, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section. However, the contracting officer must ensure that the contractor has installed the necessary management control systems, including internal audit procedures.\n\n(e) When financing payments are in the form of progress payments, the Progress Payments clause at 52.232-16 requires that the subcontract include the substance of the Progress Payments clause in the prime contract, modified to indicate that the contractor, not the Government, awards the subcontract and administers the progress payments. The following exceptions apply to wording modifications:\n\n(1) The subcontract terms on title to property under progress payments shall provide for vesting of title in the Government, not the contractor, as in paragraph (d) of the Progress Payments clause in the prime contract. A reference to the contractor may, however, be substituted for \"Government\" in paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of the clause.\n\n(2) In the subcontract terms on reports and access to records, the contractor shall not delete the references to \"Contracting Officer\" and \"Government\" in adapting paragraph (g) of the Progress Payments clause in the contract, but may expand the terms as follows:\n\n(i) The term \"Contracting Officer\" may be changed to \"Contracting Officer or Prime Contractor.\"\n\n(ii) The term \"the Government\" may be changed to \"the Government or Prime Contractor.\"\n\n(3) The subcontract special terms regarding default shall include paragraph (h) of the Progress Payments clause in the contract through its subdivision (i). The rest of paragraph (h) is optional.\n\n(f) When financing payments are in the form of performance-based payments, the Performance-Based Payments clause at 52.232-32 requires that the subcontract terms include the substance of the Performance-Based Payments clause, modified to indicate that the contractor, not the Government, awards the subcontract and administers the performance-based payments, and include appropriately worded modifications similar to those noted in paragraph (e) of this section.\n\n(g) When financing payments are in the form of commercial product or commercial service purchase financing, the subcontract must include a contract financing clause structured in accordance with 32.206.\n\n(a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the contracting officer shall take the following actions:\n\n(1) Issue the demand for payment as soon as the contracting officer has determined that an actual debt is due the Government and the amount.\n\n(2) Issue the demand for payment even if-\n\n(i) The debt is or will be the subject of a bilateral modification;\n\n(ii) The contractor is otherwise obligated to pay the money under the existing contract terms; or\n\n(iii) The contractor has agreed to repay the debt.\n\n(3) Issue the demand for payment as a part of the final decision, if a final decision is required by 32.605(a).\n\n(b) The demand for payment shall include the following:\n\n(1) A description of the debt, including the debt amount.\n\n(2) A distribution of the principal amount of the debt by line(s) of accounting subject to the following:\n\n(i) If the debt affects multiple lines of accounting, the contracting officer shall, to the maximum extent practicable, identify all affected lines of accounting. If it is not practicable to identify all affected lines of accounting, the contracting officer may select representative lines of accounting in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.\n\n(ii) In selecting representative lines of accounting, the contracting officer shall-\n\n(A) Consider the affected departments or agencies, years of appropriations, and the predominant types of appropriations; and\n\n(B) Not distribute to any line of accounting an amount of the principal in excess of the total obligation for the line of accounting; and\n\n(iii) Include the lines of accounting even if the associated funds are expired or cancelled. While cancelled funds will be deposited in a miscellaneous receipt account of the Treasury if collected, the funds are tracked under the closed year appropriation(s) to comply with the Anti-Deficiency Act.\n\n(iv) If the debt affects multiple contracts and the lines of accounting are not readily available, the contracting officer shall-\n\n(A) Issue the demand for payment without the distribution of the principal amount to the affected lines of accounting;\n\n(B) Include a statement in the demand for payment advising when the distribution will be provided; and\n\n(C) Provide the distribution by the date identified in the demand for payment.\n\n(3) The basis for and amount of any accrued interest or penalty.\n\n(4)\n\n(i) For debts resulting from specific contract terms (e.g., debts resulting from incentive clause provisions, Quarterly Limitation on Payments Statement, Cost Accounting Standards, price reduction for defective pricing), a notification stating that payment should be made promptly, and that interest is due in accordance with the terms of the contract. Interest shall be computed from the date specified in the applicable contract clause until repayment by the contractor. The interest rate shall be the rate specified in the applicable contract clause. In the case of a debt arising from a price reduction for defective pricing, or as specifically set forth in a Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) clause in the contract, interest is computed from the date of overpayment by the Government until repayment by the contractor at the underpayment rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury, for the periods affected, under 26 U.S.C . 6621(a)(2).\n\n(ii) For all other contract debts, a notification stating that any amounts not paid within 30 days from the date of the demand for payment will bear interest. Interest shall be computed from the date of the demand for payment until repayment by the contractor. The interest rate shall be the interest rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury, as provided in 41 U.S.C. 7109, which is applicable to the period in which the amount becomes due, and then at the rate applicable for each six-month period as established by the Secretary until the amount is paid.\n\n(5) A statement advising the contractor-\n\n(i) To contact the contracting officer if the contractor believes the debt is invalid or the amount is incorrect; and\n\n(ii) If the contractor agrees, to remit a check payable to the agency’s payment office annotated with the contract number along with a copy of the demand for payment to the payment office identified in the contract or as otherwise specified in the demand letter in accordance with agency procedures.\n\n(6) Notification that the payment office may initiate procedures, in accordance with the applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, to offset the debt against any payments otherwise due the contractor.\n\n(7) Notification that the debt may be subject to administrative charges in accordance with the requirements of 31U.S. C. 3717(e) and the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996.\n\n(8) Notification that the contractor may submit a request for installment payments or deferment of collection if immediate payment is not practicable or if the amount is disputed.\n\n(c) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the contracting officer should not issue a demand for payment if the contracting officer only becomes aware of the debt when the contractor-\n\n(1) Provides a lump sum payment or submits a credit invoice. (A credit invoice is a contractor’s request to liquidate the debt against existing unpaid bills due the contractor); or\n\n(2) Notifies the contracting officer that the payment office overpaid on an invoice payment. When the contractor provides the notification, the contracting officer shall notify the payment office of the overpayment.\n\n(d) If a demand for payment was not issued as provided for in paragraph (c) of this section, the contracting officer shall issue a demand for payment no sooner than 30 days after the contracting officer becomes aware of the debt unless-\n\n(1) The contractor has liquidated the debt;\n\n(2) The contractor has requested an installment payment agreement; or\n\n(3) The payment office has issued a demand for payment.\n\n(e) The contracting officer shall-\n\n(1) Furnish a copy of the demand for payment to the contractor by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by any other method that provides evidence of receipt; and\n\n(2) Forward a copy of the demand to the payment office.\n\n(a) Assignments.\n\n(1) Assignments by corporations shall be-\n\n(i) Executed by an authorized representative;\n\n(ii) Attested by the secretary or the assistant secretary of the corporation; and\n\n(iii) Impressed with the corporate seal or accompanied by a true copy of the resolution of the corporation’s board of directors authorizing the signing representative to execute the assignment.\n\n(2) Assignments by a partnership may be signed by one partner, if the assignment is accompanied by adequate evidence that the signer is a general partner of the partnership and is authorized to execute assignments on behalf of the partner-ship.\n\n(3) Assignments by an individual shall be signed by that individual and the signature acknowledged before a notary public or other person authorized to administer oaths.\n\n(b) Filing. The assignee shall forward to each party specified in 32.802(e) an original and three copies of the notice of assignment, together with one true copy of the instrument of assignment. The true copy shall be a certified duplicate or photostat copy of the original assignment.\n\n(c) Format for notice of assignment. The following is a suggested format for use by an assignee in providing the notice of assignment required by 32.802(e).\n\nNotice of Assignment\n\nTo: ___________ [Address to one of the parties specified in 32.802(e)].\n\nThis has reference to Contract No. __________ dated ______, entered into between ______ [Contractor’s name and address] and ______ [Government agency, name of office, and address], for ________ [Describe nature of the contract].\n\nMoneys due or to become due under the contract described above have been assigned to the undersigned under the provisions of the Assignment of Claims Act of1940, as amended, ( 31 U.S.C.3727, 41 U.S.C.6305).\n\nA true copy of the instrument of assignment executed by the Contractor on ___________ [Date], is attached to the original notice.\n\nPayments due or to become due under this contract should be made to the undersigned assignee.\n\nPlease return to the undersigned the three enclosed copies of this notice with appropriate notations showing the date and hour of receipt, and signed by the person acknowledging receipt on behalf of the addressee.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n__________________________________________________ [Name of Assignee]\n\nBy _______________________________________________ [Signature of Signing Officer]\n\n__________________________________________________ [Titleof Signing Officer]\n\n__________________________________________________ [Address of Assignee]\n\nAcknowledgement\n\nReceipt is acknowledged of the above notice and of a copy of the instrument of assignment. They were received ____(a.m.) (p.m.) on ______, 20___.\n\n__________________________________________________ [Signature]\n\n__________________________________________________ [Title]\n\n__________________________________________________ On behalf of\n\n__________________________________________________ [Name of Addressee of this Notice]\n\n(d) Examination by the Government. In examining and processing notices of assignment and before acknowledging their receipt, contracting officers should assure that the following conditions and any additional conditions specified in agency regulations, have been met:\n\n(1) The contract has been properly approved and executed.\n\n(2) The contract is one under which claims may be assigned.\n\n(3) The assignment covers only money due or to become due under the contract.\n\n(4) The assignee is registered separately in the System for Award Management unless one of the exceptions in 4.1102 applies.\n\n(e) Release of assignment.\n\n(1) A release of an assignment is required whenever-\n\n(i) There has been a further assignment or reassignment under the Act; or\n\n(ii) The contractor wishes to reestablish its right to receive further payments after the contractor’s obligations to the assignee have been satisfied and a balance remains due under the contract.\n\n(2) The assignee, under a further assignment or reassignment, in order to establish a right to receive payment from the Government, must file with the addressees listed in 32.802(e) a-\n\n(i) Written notice of release of the contractor by the assigning financing institution;\n\n(ii) Copy of the release instrument;\n\n(iii) Written notice of the further assignment or reassignment; and\n\n(iv) Copy of the further assignment or reassignment instrument.\n\n(3) If the assignee releases the contractor from an assignment of claims under a contract, the contractor, in order to establish a right to receive payment of the balance due under the contract, must file a written notice of release together with a true copy of the release of assignment instrument with the addressees noted in 32.802(e).\n\n(4) The addressee of a notice of release of assignment or the official acting on behalf of that addressee shall acknowledge receipt of the notice.\n\n(a) General. Agency procedures must ensure that, when specifying due dates, contracting officers give full consideration to the time reasonably required by Government officials to fulfill their administrative responsibilities under the contract.\n\n(b) Payment due dates. Except as prescribed in paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section, or as authorized in 32.908(a)(2) or (c)(2), the due date for making an invoice payment is as follows:\n\n(1) The later of the following two events:\n\n(i) The 30 thday after the designated billing office receives a proper invoice from the contractor (except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section).\n\n(ii) The 30 thday after Government acceptance of supplies delivered or services performed.\n\n(A) For a final invoice, when the payment amount is subject to contract settlement actions, acceptance is deemed to occur on the effective date of the contract settlement.\n\n(B) For the sole purpose of computing an interest penalty that might be due the contractor-\n\n(1) Government acceptance is deemed to occur constructively on the 7 thday after the contractor delivers supplies or performs services in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract, unless there is a disagreement over quantity, quality, or contractor compliance with a contract requirement;\n\n(2) If actual acceptance occurs within the constructive acceptance period, the Government must base the determination of an interest penalty on the actual date of acceptance;\n\n(3) The constructive acceptance requirement does not compel Government officials to accept supplies or services, perform contract administration functions, or make payment prior to fulfilling their responsibilities; and\n\n(4) Except for a contract for the purchase of a commercial product or commercial service, including a brand-name commercial product for authorized resale (e.g.,commissary items), the contracting officer may specify a longer period for constructive acceptance in the solicitation and resulting contract, if required to afford the Government a reasonable opportunity to inspect and test the supplies furnished or to evaluate the services performed. The contracting officer must document in the contract file the justification for extending the constructive acceptance period beyond 7 days. Extended acceptance periods must not be a routine agency practice and must be used only when necessary to permit proper Government inspection and testing of the supplies delivered or services performed.\n\n(2) If the contract does not require submission of an invoice for payment (e.g.,periodic lease payments), the contracting officer must specify the due date in the contract.\n\n(3) If the designated billing office fails to annotate the invoice with the actual date of receipt at the time of receipt, the invoice payment due date is the 30 thday after the date of the contractor's invoice, provided the designated billing office receives a proper invoice and there is no disagreement over quantity, quality, or contractor compliance with contract requirements.\n\n(c) Architect-engineer contracts.\n\n(1) The due date for making payments on contracts that contain the clause at 52.232-10, Payments Under Fixed-Price Architect-Engineer Contracts, is as follows:\n\n(i) The due date for work or services completed by the contractor is the later of the following two events:\n\n(A) The 30 thday after the designated billing office receives a proper invoice from the contractor.\n\n(B) The 30 thday after Government acceptance of the work or services completed by the contractor.\n\n(1) For a final invoice, when the payment amount is subject to contract settlement actions (e.g., release of claims), acceptance is deemed to occur on the effective date of the settlement.\n\n(2) For the sole purpose of computing an interest penalty that might be due the contractor, Government acceptance is deemed to occur constructively on the 7 thday after the contractor completes the work or services in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract (see also paragraph (c)(2) of this section). If actual acceptance occurs within the constructive acceptance period, the Government must base the determination of an interest penalty on the actual date of acceptance.\n\n(ii) The due date for progress payments is the 30 thday after Government approval of contractor estimates of work or services accomplished. For the sole purpose of computing an interest penalty that might be due the contractor-\n\n(A) Government approval is deemed to occur constructively on the 7 thday after the designated billing office receives the contractor estimates (see also paragraph (c)(2) of this section).\n\n(B) If actual approval occurs within the constructive approval period, the Government must base the determination of an interest penalty on the actual date of approval.\n\n(iii) If the designated billing office fails to annotate the invoice or payment request with the actual date of receipt at the time of receipt, the payment due date is the 30 thday after the date of the contractor’s invoice or payment request, provided the designated billing office receives a proper invoice or payment request and there is no disagreement over quantity, quality, or contractor compliance with contract requirements.\n\n(2) The constructive acceptance and constructive approval requirements described in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section are conditioned upon receipt of a proper payment request and no disagreement over quantity, quality, contractor compliance with contract requirements, or the requested progress payment amount. These requirements do not compel Government officials to accept work or services, approve contractor estimates, perform contract administration functions, or make payment prior to fulfilling their responsibilities. The contracting officer may specify a longer period for constructive acceptance or constructive approval, if required to afford the Government a reasonable opportunity to inspect and test the supplies furnished or to evaluate the services performed. The contracting officer must document in the contract file the justification for extending the constructive acceptance or approval period beyond 7 days.\n\n(d) Construction contracts.\n\n(1) The due date for making payments on construction contracts is as follows:\n\n(i) The due date for making progress payments based on contracting officer approval of the estimated amount and value of work or services performed, including payments for reaching milestones in any project, is 14 days after the designated billing office receives a proper payment request.\n\n(A) If the designated billing office fails to annotate the payment request with the actual date of receipt at the time of receipt, the payment due date is the 14 thday after the date of the contractor’s payment request, provided the designated billing office receives a proper payment request and there is no disagreement over quantity, quality, or contractor compliance with contract requirements.\n\n(B) The contracting officer may specify a longer period in the solicitation and resulting contract if required to afford the Government a reasonable opportunity to adequately inspect the work and to determine the adequacy of the contractor’s performance under the contract. The contracting officer must document in the contract file the justification for extending the due date beyond 14 days.\n\n(C) The contracting officer must not approve progress payment requests unless the certification and substantiation of amounts requested are provided as required by the clause at 52.232-5, Payments Under Fixed-Price Construction Contracts.\n\n(ii) The due date for payment of any amounts retained by the contracting officer in accordance with the clause at 52.232-5, Payments Under Fixed-Price Construction Contracts, will be as specified in the contract or, if not specified, 30 days after approval by the contracting officer for release to the contractor. The contracting officer must base the release of retained amounts on the contracting officer’s determination that satisfactory progress has been made.\n\n(iii) The due date for final payments based on completion and acceptance of all work (including any retained amounts), and payments for partial deliveries that have been accepted by the Government (e.g., each separate building, public work, or other division of the contract for which the price is stated separately in the contract) is as follows:\n\n(A) The later of the following two events:\n\n(1) The 30 thday after the designated billing office receives a proper invoice from the contractor.\n\n(2) The 30 thday after Government acceptance of the work or services completed by the contractor. For a final invoice, when the payment amount is subject to contract settlement actions (e.g., release of contractor claims), acceptance is deemed to occur on the effective date of the contract settlement.\n\n(B) If the designated billing office fails to annotate the invoice with the actual date of receipt at the time of receipt, the invoice payment due date is the 30 thday after the date of the contractor’s invoice, provided the designated billing office receives a proper invoice and there is no disagreement over quantity, quality, or contractor compliance with contract requirements.\n\n(2) For the sole purpose of computing an interest penalty that might be due the contractor for payments described in paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section-\n\n(i) Government acceptance or approval is deemed to occur constructively on the 7 thday after the contractor completes the work or services in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract, unless there is a disagreement over quantity, quality, contractor compliance with a contract requirement, or the requested amount;\n\n(ii) If actual acceptance occurs within the constructive acceptance period, the Government must base the determination of an interest penalty on the actual date of acceptance;\n\n(iii) The constructive acceptance requirement does not compel Government officials to accept work or services, approve contractor estimates, perform contract administration functions, or make payment prior to fulfilling their responsibilities; and\n\n(iv) The contracting officer may specify a longer period for constructive acceptance or constructive approval in the solicitation and resulting contract, if required to afford the Government a reasonable opportunity to adequately inspect the work and to determine the adequacy of the contractor’s performance under the contract. The contracting officer must document in the contract file the justification for extending the constructive acceptance or approval beyond 7 days.\n\n(3) Construction contracts contain special provisions concerning contractor payments to subcontractors, along with special contractor certification requirements. The Office of Management and Budget has determined that these certifications must not be construed as final acceptance of the subcontractor’s performance. The certification in 52.232-5(c) implements this determination; however, certificates are still acceptable if the contractor deletes paragraph (c)(4) of 52.232-5 from the certificate.\n\n(4)\n\n(i) Paragraph (d) of the clause at 52.232-5, Payments under Fixed-Price Construction Contracts, and paragraph (e)(6) of the clause at 52.232-27, Prompt Payment for Construction Contracts, provide for the contractor to pay interest on unearned amounts in certain circumstances. The Government must recover this interest from subsequent payments to the contractor. Therefore, contracting officers normally must make no demand for payment. Contracting officers must-\n\n(A) Compute the amount in accordance with the clause;\n\n(B) Provide the contractor with a final decision; and\n\n(C) Notify the payment office of the amount to be withheld.\n\n(ii) The payment office is responsible for making the deduction of interest. Amounts collected in accordance with these provisions revert to the United States Treasury.\n\n(e) Cost-reimbursement contracts for services. For purposes of computing late payment interest penalties that may apply, the due date for making interim payments on cost-reimbursement contracts for services is 30 days after the date of receipt of a proper invoice.\n\n(f) Food and specified items.\n\nIf the items delivered are: Payment must be made as close as possible to, but not later than:\n\n(1) Meat or meat food products. As defined in section 2(a)(3) of the Packers and Stockyard Act of 1921 ( 7 U.S.C.182(3)), and as further defined in Public Law98-181, including any edible fresh or frozen poultry meat, any perishable poultry meat food product, fresh eggs, and any perishable egg product.\n\n7th day after product delivery.\n\n(2) Fresh or frozen fish. As defined in section 204(3) of the Fish and Seafood Promotion Act of 1986 ( 16 U.S.C.4003(3)).\n\n7th day after product delivery.\n\n(3) Perishable agricultural commodities. As defined in section 1(4) of the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act of 1930 ( 7 U.S.C.499a(4)).\n\n10th day after product delivery, unless another date is specified in the contract.\n\n(4) Dairy products. As defined in section 111(e) of the Dairy Production Stabilization Act of 1983 ( 7 U.S.C.4502(e)), edible fats or oils, and food products prepared from edible fats or oils. Liquid milk, cheese, certain processed cheese products, butter, yogurt, ice cream, mayonnaise, salad dressings, and other similar products fall within this classification. Nothing in the Act limits this classification to refrigerated products. If questions arise regarding the proper classification of a specific product, the contracting officer must follow prevailing industry practices in specifying a contract payment due date. The burden of proof that a classification of a specific product is, in fact, prevailing industry practice is upon the contractor making the representation.\n\n10th day after a proper invoice has been received.\n\n(g) Multiple payment due dates. Contracting officers may encourage, but not require, contractors to submit separate invoices for products with different payment due dates under the same contract or order. When an invoice contains items with different payment due dates (i.e.,a mixed invoice), the payment office will, subject to agency policy-\n\n(1) Pay the entire invoice on the earliest due date; or\n\n(2) Split invoice payments, making payments by the applicable due dates.\n\n(a) General. Payment will be based on receipt of a proper invoice and satisfactory contract performance.\n\n(b) Content of invoices.\n\n(1) A proper invoice must include the following items (except for interim payments on cost reimbursement contracts for services):\n\n(i) Name and address of the contractor.\n\n(ii) Invoice date and invoice number. (Contractors should date invoices as close as possible to the date of mailing or transmission.)\n\n(iii) Contract number or other authorization for supplies delivered or services performed (including order number and line item number).\n\n(iv) Description, quantity, unit of measure, unit price, and extended price of supplies delivered or services performed.\n\n(v) Shipping and payment terms (e.g., shipment number and date of shipment, discount for prompt payment terms). Bill of lading number and weight of shipment will be shown for shipments on Government bills of lading.\n\n(vi) Name and address of contractor official to whom payment is to be sent (must be the same as that in the contract or in a proper notice of assignment).\n\n(vii) Name (where practicable), title, phone number, and mailing address of person to notify in the event of a defective invoice.\n\n(viii) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN). The contractor must include its TIN on the invoice only if required by agency procedures. (See 4.9 TIN requirements.)\n\n(ix) Electronic funds transfer (EFT) banking information.\n\n(A) The contractor must include EFT banking information on the invoice only if required by agency procedures.\n\n(B) If EFT banking information is not required to be on the invoice, in order for the invoice to be a proper invoice, the contractor must have submitted correct EFT banking information in accordance with the applicable solicitation provision (e.g., 52.232-38, Submission of Electronic Funds Transfer Information with Offer), contract clause (e.g., 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer-System for Award Management, or 52.232-34, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer-Other Than System for Award Management), or applicable agency procedures.\n\n(C) EFT banking information is not required if the Government waived the requirement to pay by EFT.\n\n(x) Any other information or documentation required by the contract (e.g., evidence of shipment).\n\n(2) An interim payment request under a cost-reimbursement contract for services constitutes a proper invoice for purposes of this subsection if it includes all of the information required by the contract.\n\n(3) If the invoice does not comply with these requirements, the designated billing office must return it within 7 days after receipt (3 days on contracts for meat, meat food products, or fish; 5 days on contracts for perishable agricultural commodities, dairy products, edible fats or oils, and food products prepared from edible fats or oils), with the reasons why it is not a proper invoice. If such notice is not timely, then the designated billing office must adjust the due date for the purpose of determining an interest penalty, if any.\n\n(c) Authorization to pay. All invoice payments, with the exception of interim payments on cost-reimbursement contracts for services, must be supported by a receiving report or other Government documentation authorizing payment (e.g., Government certified voucher). The agency receiving official should forward the receiving report or other Government documentation to the designated payment office by the 5th working day after Government acceptance or approval, unless other arrangements have been made. This period of time does not extend the due dates prescribed in this section. Acceptance should be completed as expeditiously as possible. The receiving report or other Government documentation authorizing payment must, as a minimum, include the following:\n\n(1) Contract number or other authorization for supplies delivered or services performed.\n\n(2) Description of supplies delivered or services performed.\n\n(3) Quantities of supplies received and accepted or services performed, if applicable.\n\n(4) Date supplies delivered or services performed.\n\n(5) Date that the designated Government official-\n\n(i) Accepted the supplies or services; or\n\n(ii) Approved the progress payment request, if the request is being made under the clause at 52.232-5, Payments Under Fixed-Price Construction Contracts, or the clause at 52.232-10, Payments Under Fixed-Price Architect-Engineer Contracts.\n\n(6) Signature, printed name, title, mailing address, and telephone number of the designated Government official responsible for acceptance or approval functions.\n\n(d) Billing office. The designated billing office must immediately annotate each invoice with the actual date it receives the invoice.\n\n(e) Payment office. The designated payment office will annotate each invoice and receiving report with the actual date it receives the invoice.\n\n(a) Late payment. The designated payment office will pay an interest penalty automatically, without request from the contractor, when all of the following conditions, if applicable, have been met:\n\n(1) The designated billing office received a proper invoice.\n\n(2) The Government processed a receiving report or other Government documentation authorizing payment, and there was no disagreement over quantity, quality, or contractor compliance with any contract requirement.\n\n(3) In the case of a final invoice, the payment amount is not subject to further contract settlement actions between the Government and the contractor.\n\n(4) The designated payment office paid the contractor after the due date.\n\n(5) In the case of interim payments on cost-reimbursement contracts for services, when payment is made more than 30 days after the designated billing office receives a proper invoice.\n\n(b) Improperly taken discount. The designated payment office will pay an interest penalty automatically, without request from the contractor, if the Government takes a discount for prompt payment improperly. The interest penalty is calculated on the amount of discount taken for the period beginning with the firstday after the end of the discount period through the date when the contractor is paid.\n\n(c) Failure to pay interest.\n\n(1) The designated payment office will pay a penalty amount, in addition to the interest penalty amount, only if-\n\n(i) The Government owes an interest penalty of $1 or more;\n\n(ii) The designated payment office does not pay the interest penalty within 10 days after the date the invoice amount is paid; and\n\n(iii) The contractor makes a written demand to the designated payment office for additional penalty payment in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section, postmarked not later than 40 days after the date the invoice amount is paid.\n\n(2)\n\n(i) Contractors must support written demands for additional penalty payments with the following data. The Government must not request additional data. Contractors must-\n\n(A) Specifically assert that late payment interest is due under a specific invoice, and request payment of all overdue late payment interest penalty and such additional penalty as may be required;\n\n(B) Attach a copy of the invoice on which the unpaid late payment interest is due; and\n\n(C) State that payment of the principal has been received, including the date of receipt.\n\n(3) If there is no postmark or the postmark is illegible-\n\n(i) The designated payment office that receives the demand will annotate it with the date of receipt, provided the demand is received on or before the 40 thday after payment was made; or\n\n(ii) If the designated payment office fails to make the required annotation, the Government will determine the demand’s validity based on the date the contractor has placed on the demand; provided such date is no later than the 40 thday after payment was made.\n\n(d) Disagreements.\n\n(1) The payment office will not pay interest penalties if payment delays are due to disagreement between the Government and contractor concerning-\n\n(i) The payment amount;\n\n(ii) Contract compliance; or\n\n(iii) Amounts temporarily withheld or retained in accordance with the terms of the contract.\n\n(2) The Government and the contractor must resolve claims involving disputes, and any interest that may be payable in accordance with the Disputes clause.\n\n(e) Computation of interest penalties. The Government will compute interest penalties in accordance with OMB prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR Part 1315. These regulations are available via the Internet at http://www.fms.treas.gov/prompt/.\n\n(f) Unavailability of funds. The temporary unavailability of funds to make a timely payment does not relieve an agency from the obligation to pay interest penalties.\n\nPerformance-based payments may be made either on a whole contract or on a deliverable item basis, unless otherwise prescribed by agency regulations. Financing payments to be made on a whole contract basis are applicable to the entire contract, and not to specific deliverable items. Financing payments to be made on a deliverable item basis are applicable to a specific individual deliverable item. (A deliverable item for these purposes is a separate item with a distinct unit price. Thus, a line item for 10 airplanes, with a unit price of $1,000,000 each, has 10 deliverable items-the separate planes. A line item for 1 lot of 10 airplanes, with a lot price of $10,000,000, has only one deliverable item-the lot.)\n\n(a) Establishing performance bases.\n\n(1) The basis for performance-based payments may be either specifically described events (e.g., milestones) or some measurable criterion of performance. Each event or performance criterion that will trigger a finance payment shall be an integral and necessary part of contract performance and shall be identified in the contract, along with a description of what constitutes successful performance of the event or attainment of the performance criterion. The signing of contracts or modifications, the exercise of options, the passage of time, or other such occurrences do not represent meaningful efforts or actions and shall not be identified as events or criteria for performance-based payments. An event need not be a critical event in order to trigger a payment, but the Government must be able to readily verify successful performance of each such event or performance criterion.\n\n(2) Events or criteria may be either severable or cumulative. The successful completion of a severable event or criterion is independent of the accomplishment of any other event or criterion. Conversely, the successful accomplishment of a cumulative event or criterion is dependent upon the previous accomplishment of another event. A contract may provide for more than one series of severable and/or cumulative performance events or criteria performed in parallel. The contracting officer shall include the following in the contract:\n\n(i) The contract shall not permit payment for a cumulative event or criterion until the dependent event or criterion has been successfully completed.\n\n(ii) The contract shall specifically identify severable events or criteria.\n\n(iii) The contract shall specifically identify cumulative events or criteria and identify which events or criteria are preconditions for the successful achievement of each event or criterion.\n\n(iv) Because performance-based payments are contract financing, events or criteria shall not serve as a vehicle to reward the contractor for completion of performance levels over and above what is required for successful completion of the contract.\n\n(v) If payment of performance-based finance amounts is on a deliverable item basis, each event or performance criterion shall be part of the performance necessary for that deliverable item and shall be identified to a specific line item or subline item.\n\n(b) Establishing performance-based finance payment amounts.\n\n(1) The contracting officer shall establish a complete, fully defined schedule of events or performance criteria and payment amounts when negotiating contract terms. If a contract action significantly affects the price, or event or performance criterion, the contracting officer responsible for pricing the contract modification shall adjust the performance-based payment schedule appropriately.\n\n(2) Total performance-based payments shall-\n\n(i) Reflect prudent contract financing provided only to the extent needed for contract performance (see 32.104(a)); and\n\n(ii) Not exceed 90 percent of the contract price if on a whole contract basis, or 90 percent of the delivery item price if on a delivery item basis.\n\n(3) The contract shall specifically state the amount of each performance-based payment either as a dollar amount or as a percentage of a specifically identified price (e.g., contract price or unit price of the deliverable item). The payment of contract financing has a cost to the Government in terms of interest paid by the Treasury to borrow funds to make the payment. Because the contracting officer has wide discretion as to the timing and amount of the performance-based payments, the contracting officer shall ensure that-\n\n(i) The total contract price is fair and reasonable, all factors considered; and\n\n(ii) Performance-based payment amounts are commensurate with the value of the performance event or performance criterion and are not expected to result in an unreasonably low or negative level of contractor investment in the contract. To confirm sufficient investment, the contracting officer may request expenditure profile information from offerors, but only if other information in the proposal, or information otherwise available to the contracting officer, is expected to be insufficient.\n\n(4) Unless agency procedures prescribe the bases for establishing performance-based payment amounts, contracting officers may establish them on any rational basis, including (but not limited to)-\n\n(i) Engineering estimates of stages of completion;\n\n(ii) Engineering estimates of hours or other measures of effort to be expended in performance of an event or achievement of a performance criterion; or\n\n(iii) The estimated projected cost of performance of particular events.\n\n(5) When subsequent contract modifications are issued, the contracting officer shall adjust the performance-based payment schedule as necessary to reflect the actions required by those contract modifications.\n\n(c) Instructions for multiple appropriations. If there is more than one appropriation account (or subaccount) funding payments on the contract, the contracting officer shall provide instructions to the Government payment office for distribution of financing payments to the respective funds accounts. Distribution instructions shall be consistent with the contract’s liquidation provisions.\n\n(d) Liquidating performance-based finance payments. Performance-based amounts shall be liquidated by deducting a percentage or a designated dollar amount from the delivery payments. The contracting officer shall specify the liquidation rate or designated dollar amount in the contract. The method of liquidation shall ensure complete liquidation no later than final payment.\n\n(1) If the contracting officer establishes the performance-based payments on a delivery item basis, the liquidation amount for each line item is the percent of that delivery item price that was previously paid under performance-based finance payments or the designated dollar amount.\n\n(2) If the performance-based finance payments are on a whole contract basis, liquidation is by predesignated liquidation amounts or liquidation percentages.\n\n(e) Competitive negotiated solicitations.\n\n(1) If a solicitation requests offerors to propose performance-based payments, the solicitation shall specify-\n\n(i) What, if any, terms shall be included in all offers; and\n\n(ii) The extent to which and how offeror-proposed performance-based payment terms will be evaluated. Unless agencies prescribe other evaluation procedures, if the contracting officer anticipates that the cost of providing performance-based payments would have a significant impact on determining the best value offer, the solicitation should state that the evaluation of the offeror’s proposed prices will include an adjustment to reflect the estimated cost to the Government of providing each offeror’s proposed performance-based payments (see Alternate I to the provision at 52.232-28).\n\n(2) The contracting officer shall-\n\n(i) Review the proposed terms to ensure they comply with this section; and\n\n(ii) Use the adjustment method at 32.205(c) if the price is to be adjusted for evaluation purposes in accordance with paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section.\n\nA Governmentwide commercial purchase card charge authorizes the third party (e.g., financial institution) that issued the purchase card to make immediate payment to the contractor. The Government reimburses the third party at a later date for the third party’s payment to the contractor.\n\n(a) The clause at 52.232-36, Payment by Third Party, governs when a contractor submits a charge against the purchase card for contract payment. The clause provides that the contractor shall make such payment requests by a charge to a Government account with the third party at the time the payment clause(s) of the contract authorizes the contractor to submit a request for payment, and for the amount due in accordance with the terms of the contract. To the extent that such a payment would otherwise be approved, the charge against the purchase card should not be disputed when the charge is reported to the Government by the third party. To the extent that such payment would otherwise not have been approved, an authorized individual (see 1.603-3) shall take action to remove the charge, such as by disputing the charge with the third party or by requesting that the contractor credit the charge back to the Government under the contract.\n\n(b)\n\n(1) Written contracts to be paid by purchase card should include the clause at 52.232-36, Payment by Third Party, as prescribed by 32.1110(d). However, payment by a purchase card also may be made under a contract that does not contain the clause to the extent the contractor agrees to accept that method of payment.\n\n(2)\n\n(i) When it is contemplated that the Governmentwide commercial purchase card will be used as the method of payment, and the contract or order is above the micro-purchase threshold, contracting officers are required to verify by looking in the System for Award Management (SAM) whether the contractor has any delinquent debt subject to collection under the Treasury Offset Program (TOP) at contract award and order placement. Information on TOP is available at http://fms.treas.gov/debt/index.html.\n\n(ii) The contracting officer shall not authorize the Governmentwide commercial purchase card as a method of payment during any period the SAM indicates that the contractor has delinquent debt subject to collection under the TOP. In such cases, payments under the contract shall be made in accordance with the clause at 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer-System for Award Management, or 52.232-34, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer-Other Than System for Award Management, as appropriate (see FAR 32.1110(d)).\n\n(iii) Contracting officers shall not use the presence of the SAM debt flag indicator to exclude a contractor from receipt of the contract award or issuance or placement of an order.\n\n(iv) The contracting officer may take steps to authorize payment by Governmentwide commercial purchase card when a contractor alerts the contracting officer that the SAM debt flag indicator has been changed to no longer show a delinquent debt.\n\n(c) The clause at 52.232-36, Payment by Third Party, requires that the contract-\n\n(1) Identify the third party and the particular purchase card to be used; and\n\n(2) Not include the purchase card account number. The purchase card account number should be provided separately to the contractor.\n\n(a) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at-\n\n(1) 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer-System for Award Management, in solicitations and contracts that include the provision at 52.204-7 System for Award Management, or an agency clause that requires a contractor to be registered in SAM and maintain registration until final payment, unless–\n\n(i) Payment will be made through a third party arrangement (see 13.301 and paragraph (d) of this section); or\n\n(ii) An exception listed in 32.1103(a) through (i) applies.\n\n(2)\n\n(i) 52.232-34, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer-Other than System for Award Management, in solicitations and contracts that require EFT as the method for payment but do not include the provision at 52.204-7, System for Award Management, or a similar agency clause that requires the contractor to be registered in the SAM.\n\n(ii)\n\n(A) If permitted by agency procedures, the contracting officer may insert in paragraph (b)(1) of the clause, a particular time after award, such as a fixed number of days, or event such as the submission of the first request for payment.\n\n(B) If no agency procedures are prescribed, the time period inserted in paragraph (b)(1) of the clause shall be \"no later than 15 days prior to submission of the first request for payment.\"\n\n(b) If the head of the agency has authorized, in accordance with 32.1106, to use a nondomestic EFT mechanism, the contracting officer shall insert in solicitations and contracts a clause substantially the same as 52.232-33 or 52.232-34 that clearly addresses the nondomestic EFT mechanism.\n\n(c) If EFT information is to be submitted to other than the payment office in accordance with agency procedures, the contracting officer shall insert in solicitations and contracts the clause at 52.232-35, Designation of Office for Government Receipt of Electronic Funds Transfer Information, or a clause substantially the same as 52.232-35 that clearly informs the contractor where to send the EFT information.\n\n(d) If payment under a written contract will be made by a charge to a Government account with a third party such as a Governmentwide commercial purchase card, then the contracting officer shall insert the clause at 52.232-36, Payment by Third Party, in solicitations and contracts. Payment by a purchase card may also be made under a contract that does not contain the clause at 52.232-36, to the extent the contractor agrees to accept that method of payment. When the clause at 52.232-36 is included in a solicitation or contract, the contracting officer shall also insert the clause at 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer-System for Award Management, or 52.232-34, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer-Other Than System for Award Management, as appropriate.\n\n(e) If the contract or agreement provides for the use of delivery orders, and provides that the ordering office designate the method of payment for individual orders, the contracting officer shall insert, in the solicitation and contract or agreement, the clause at 52.232-37, Multiple Payment Arrangements, and, to the extent they are applicable, the clauses at-\n\n(1) 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer-System for Award Management;\n\n(2) 52.232-34, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer-Other than System for Award Management; and\n\n(3) 52.232-36, Payment by Third Party.\n\n(f) If more than one disbursing office will make payment under a contract or agreement, the contracting officer, or ordering office (if the contract provides for choices between EFT clauses on individual orders or classes of orders), shall include or identify the EFT clause appropriate for each office and shall identify the applicability by disbursing office and line item.\n\n(g) If the solicitation contains the clause at 52.232-34, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer-Other than System for Award Management, and an offeror is required to submit EFT information prior to award-\n\n(1) The contracting officer shall insert in the solicitation the provision at 52.232-38, Submission of Electronic Funds Transfer Information with Offer, or a provision substantially the same; and\n\n(2) For sealed bid solicitations, the contracting officer shall amend 52.232-38 to ensure that a bidder’s EFT information-\n\n(i) Is not a part of the bid to be opened at the public opening; and\n\n(ii) May not be released to members of the general public who request a copy of the bid."
