You can reach their Customer Contact Center by calling 850-487-1395, emailing DHR.Info@myfloridalicense.com or file a complaint about a restaurant or another type of DBPR food facility online at: DBPR Online Complaints.\n\nThe Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS) generally regulates whole-sale food operations, convenience stores, grocery stores, food processing operations, food storage/warehouse operations and non-alcoholic beverage operations (such as juice or smoothie bars and coffee houses). You can reach FDACS by calling 850-245-5520, emailing FoodSafety@FDACS.gov, or file a complaint about a DACS facility or food product online at: FDACS Online Complaint Form.\n\nDEPARTMENT OF HEALTH FOOD SAFETY AND SANITATION PROGRAM\n\nThe Department of Health works with food service establishments as defined by Section 381.0072, Florida Statutes to help ensure their products are not a source of foodborne illness. Generally this includes food service operations located in institutional settings (such as schools, assisted living facilities, hospice, detention facilities, adult day cares, in-patient drug, alcohol and mental health facilities etc.), civic and fraternal organizations, bars and lounges that don't prepare time temperature control (potentially hazardous) non-beverage foods, and theaters that limit their food service to items customarily served at theaters (such as beverages, popcorn, hot dogs and nachos). The codes and standards for food service establishments are found in Chapter 64E-11, Florida Administrative Code.\n\nThe Department of Health's (DOH) Food Hygiene Inspection Program is risk-based. This means that those facilities that pose a greater risk to the public becoming sick from consuming their product are inspected more often than those that pose a lesser risk. The amount of risk is determined by risk factors. These risk factors include the types of food served, the amount of preparation that is required, the population that is served, and the quantity of food that is prepared. Considering these types of factors are consistent with recommendation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. In fact, Annex 5 of the 2013 version of the FDA Model Food Code is devoted to conducting risk-based inspections. High risk facilities are inspected quarterly, which means 4 times per year (or 3 times for schools that close for summer vacation). Moderate risk facilities are inspected semiannually, which means 2 times per year. Low risk facilities are inspected once per year.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nTypes of Facilities and Food PreparationsNumber of Inspections per yearA school that prepares their own food4A school that prepares their own food, but is opened for 9 months or less3A school that receives catered meals and does not keep leftovers2A detention facility that receives catered meals, does not keep any food items overnight, nor does any dishwashing1\n\nCounty Contacts for Food Safety and Sanitation\n\nThe Department maintains inspection data for the above listed establishments.\n\nLINKS FOR OPENING A FOOD SERVICE BUSINESS:\n\nInstitution Such As A School, Assisted Living Facilities, or Jail.\n\nBars not preparing food.
