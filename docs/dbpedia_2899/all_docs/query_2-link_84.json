Jane Philpott was the first medical doctor to hold the post.[17]\n\nList of ministers\n\n[edit]\n\nKey:\n\nNo. Portrait Name Term of office Political party Ministry 1 David Dingwall July 12, 1996 June 10, 1997 Liberal 26 (Chrétien) 2 Allan Rock June 11, 1997 January 14, 2002 Liberal 3 Anne McLellan January 15, 2002 December 11, 2003 Liberal 4 Pierre Pettigrew December 12, 2003 July 19, 2004 Liberal 27 (Martin) 5 Ujjal Dosanjh July 20, 2004 February 5, 2006 Liberal 6 Tony Clement February 6, 2006 October 29, 2008 Conservative 28 (Harper) 7 Leona Aglukkaq October 30, 2008 July 15, 2013 Conservative 8 Rona Ambrose July 15, 2013 November 4, 2015 Conservative 9 Jane Philpott November 4, 2015 August 28, 2017 Liberal 29 (J.
