The Office of ITSC oversees the implementation of the Department’s IT Risk Management Framework (RMF) and the Information Risk Management Strategy.\n\nb. The Department manages information security risk at three levels:\n\n(1) Information System Level – The Department deploys information systems to satisfy mission needs at both the enterprise and bureau levels. In accordance with National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS) requirements, system owners must design, develop, acquire, and document systems with mandatory security controls to effectively manage information that systems process, store, and transmit;\n\n(2) Mission Level – As the mission owner, the Deputy Assistant Secretary (DAS) considers the potential impact of an information system on their mission and communicates this degree of tolerance to system owners. The DAS makes risk decisions on the basis of system security control assessments. The DAS documents and provides the provisional acceptance to the risk executive (Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)) for review; and\n\n(3) Organizational Level – To maintain the desired level of risk throughout the Department, the risk executive (CISO) reviews all provisional authorization decisions. This review assures the decision is within the scope of the authorizing official and aligns with the Department’s overall risk tolerance.\n\nc. To ensure this risk management process is consistent with applicable laws, regulation, and Department-wide requirements, the Chief Information Officer (CIO) may direct bureau authorizing officials to make changes to their systems. If the CIO does not seek changes, the provisional authorization becomes a full authorization.\n\nd. In addition to acting as the Department’s designated information security risk management, ITSC represents DT and the Department on interagency and intra-agency boards, working groups, and councils with charters related to information security and critical infrastructure protection for non-SCI systems.\n\ne. The DT/IA/ITSC work is accomplished within the two Divisions supported by the Office (see 1 FAM 273.3).\n\n5 FAM 1066.1 Assessment and Authorization (A&A) Division\n\n(CT:IM-190; 03-21-2017)\n\nThe A&A Division is responsible for:\n\n(1) Developing guidance and providing oversight to system owners ensuring the Department’s systems are compliant with FISMA 2014 and OMB A-130; and\n\n(2) Overseeing DOS Bureaus’ compliance with FISMA 2014 including the implementation of the A&A process (to include processing cloud security authorization as described in the CCGB Portal, department-wide common control management, contingency plan testing, review and verification and secure systems development as required for FISMA and NIST compliance.\n\n5 FAM 1066.1-1 Assessment\n\n(CT:IM-324; 06-28-2024)\n\n(CT:IM-324; 06-28-2024)5 FAM 1066.1-1(A) Information System and Security Controls Assessment\n\n(CT:IM-324; 06-28-2024)\n\na. Designated assessment personnel must perform security control assessments of all FISMA reportable Department systems except those systems designated as sensitive compartmented information (SCI) (see 1 FAM 271.1 (4)).\n\nb. The Security Control Assessor (SCA) must provide the Security Assessment Report (SAR) to the DT/IA Bureau Coordinator within two weeks of completing the System Security Assessment.\n\nc. The system owner must perform an annual security control self-assessment using the automated Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) reporting tool.\n\nd. Security control assessment must be performed in accordance with NIST guidance. System Owners and/or designated ISSO can contact the DT/IA Bureau Coordinators for current Department guidelines.\n\ne. Unclassified and Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) Systems with low impact/high cost, moderate impact, or high impact security categorization levels must be independently assessed. (See NIST SP 800-53 rev 4.)\n\nf. Classified non-National Security System (NSS) must be independently assessed. (See 40 U.S.C. 11103 for definition of NSS.)\n\n5 FAM 1066.1-1(B) General Security Assessment Requirements\n\n(CT:IM-190; 03-21-2017)\n\na. An independent security control assessor must perform the independent assessment, as defined in this subchapter (see 5 FAM 1066.1-1(D)).\n\nb. Bureaus requiring independent assessment of their systems may use independent assessment resources available from independently contracted qualified vendors, or from internal bureau-independent assessors.\n\nc. Vendors selected to perform independent assessment must be fully qualified in accordance with Department policy and any specific requirements defined in the contract (e.g., Form DD-254, Contract Security Classification Specification, or contract modification).\n\nd. The A&A Division must ensure that independent assessment resources are compliant with 5 FAM 1065.1-2 prior to the start of a system’s Assessment and Authorization (A&A) process.\n\ne. The A&A Division must provide oversight of the independent audit function by performing selected random quality assurance evaluations of independent assessment reports to ensure full compliance with Department requirements.\n\n5 FAM 1066.1-1(C) Assessment Requirements For Low Impact Systems\n\n(CT:IM-324; 06-28-2024)\n\na. A system owner is authorized to perform self-assessments of their low- impact/low-cost systems.\n\nb. All assessment results of low-impact/low-cost systems must be forwarded to the Bureau Coordinators in the A&A Division for validation within 10 business days of the completion of assessment.\n\nc. Failure to provide DT/IA with the assessment results of low-impact/low-cost systems may invalidate the system’s Authorization to Operate (ATO).\n\n5 FAM 1066.1-1(D) Criteria for Independent Assessment\n\n(CT:IM-243; 11-14-2018)\n\na. Assessor independence implies that the security control assessor (or security assessment team), whether obtained from within the organization or external to the organization, is not involved with the information system’s development, implementation, or operation. (See NIST SP 800-53 rev 4.)\n\nb. A U.S. Government-affiliated internal assessment organization can be presumed to be free from organizational impairments to independence when reporting internally to management only if the head of the audit organization meets all of the following criteria:\n\n(1) Accountable to the head or deputy head of the U.S. Government entity;\n\n(2) Required to report the results of the assessment organization’s work to the head or deputy head of the U.S. Government entity; and\n\n(3) Located organizationally outside the staff or line management function of the system owner. (Reference, Government Auditing Standards, 2011 Revision, GAO-12-331G, January 2012.)\n\n5 FAM 1066.1-1(E) Penetration Testing Results\n\n(CT:IM-324; 06-28-2024)\n\na. The Bureau of Diplomatic Security’s Cyber Threat Analysis Division (DS/CS/CTA) executes penetration testing of the Department’s networks. The CISO provides oversight to this internal and external penetration testing of selected general support systems (GSSs) and designated critical applications in support of the systems authorization program and, as general information, security performance program (e.g., financial applications, medical applications). In addition, the CISO:\n\n(1) Coordinates the schedule for systems to be tested with the new Cyber and Technology Security directorate (DS/CTS); and\n\n(2) Coordinates with Office of the Senior Coordinator for Security Infrastructure (DS/SI), the GSSs, and designated applications selected for penetration testing, and established schedule for the penetration tests.\n\nb. DS/SI must provide the results of all penetration testing of selected GSSs and designated applications to DT/IA and the system owner within two weeks of test report completion.\n\n5 FAM 1066.1-1(F) Unclassified Non-Department-Owned Systems Processing Federal Information\n\n(CT:IM-324; 06-28-2024)\n\na. The Executive Director (or equivalent level) for a bureau-sponsored non-Department entities must ensure that the annual security control self-assessment required by FISMA 2014 for non-Department-owned systems that process federal information on behalf of the Department is completed, and the results are forwarded to DT/IA/ITSC/A&A.\n\nb. Unclassified Non-Department-Owned Systems must achieve at least an Interim Authority to Operate (IATO) with the goal of achieving full ATO prior to operation.\n\nc. The annual self-assessment must be performed in accordance with the Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) Process Guide. (See the DT/IA Web site for the current guide.)\n\nd. The executive director (or equivalent level) for bureau-sponsored non-Department entities must ensure the inclusion of the results of the annual security control self-assessment in the bureau’s POA&Ms.\n\n5 FAM 1066.1-2 Risk Analysis\n\n(CT:IM-324; 06-28-2024)\n\na. A&A personnel:\n\n(1) Balance the tangible and intangible cost to the Department of applying security safeguards against the value of information and the associated information system;\n\n(2) Follow a defined methodology recommended by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Special Publication 800-30; and\n\n(3) Perform risk analysis of Department and non-Department systems, which process federal information on behalf of the Department, in support of the Systems Authorization process and FISMA reporting requirements.\n\n(4) Coordinate risk assessments, estimates, and recommendations for decisions on exceptions to policy, deviations from standards (baseline), and changes that affect the operational risk profile of the Department; and\n\n(5) Coordinate risk estimates when insufficient vulnerability data exists to support a full assessment.\n\nb. For detailed information on special assessments, contact the DT/IA/ITSC A&A Bureau Coordinators.\n\n5 FAM 1066.1-3 Systems Authorization\n\n(CT:IM-324; 06-28-2024)\n\na. To be compliant with OMB Circular A-130 Managing Information as a Strategic Resource, federal agencies must:\n\n(1) Plan for security;\n\n(2) Ensure appropriate officials are assigned security responsibility; and\n\n(3) Authorize system processing prior to operations and periodically thereafter.\n\nb. Systems authorization of all FISMA reportable Department systems must be performed following the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF).\n\nc. All FISMA reportable information systems within the Department must complete the Department’s System Authorization Process and be authorized by the Authorizing Official (AO) before being permitted to operate. (See 1 FAM 273.3).\n\nd. As part of the Systems Authorization Process, Department system owners responsible for Department information systems, including those responsible for non-Department entities (e.g., contractors, vendors), must perform security categorization of the federal information they process on behalf of the Department. DT/IA Analysts and Bureau Coordinators review and concur/not concur with the categorization. See the Department of State Acquisition Regulation (DOSAR) for further guidance on non-Department entities.\n\ne. For unclassified systems, system owners, and executive directors (or equivalent level) for bureau-sponsored non-Department entities must accomplish the categorization of the information and information system, as defined in Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 199, during the iMatrix registration process. Executive directors (or equivalent level) for bureau-sponsored non-Department entities are responsible for registering non-Department systems in iMatrix. The only information categories evaluated for non-Department entities are those that process Federal information on behalf of the Department.\n\nf. The Department system owner in coordination with iMatrix team must determine a classified system’s impact level during the iMatrix registration process. Executive directors (or equivalent level) for bureau-sponsored non-Department entities are responsible for registering non-Department systems in the iMatrix.\n\ng. The potential impact to the Department in terms of loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information on an unclassified information system is defined in FIPS 199 and is tailored to Department needs and agreed to by the System Owner and the AO:\n\n(1) LOW - if the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability could be expected to have a limited adverse effect on Department operations, Department assets, or individuals;\n\n(2) MODERATE - if the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability could be expected to have a serious adverse effect on Department operations, Department assets, or individuals; and\n\n(3) HIGH - if the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability could be expected to have a severe or catastrophic adverse effect on Department operations, Department assets, or individuals.\n\nh. System owners must establish the baseline security control configuration for information systems under their control. The baseline security control configuration is based on the potential impact level determined by the security categorization completed during the iMatrix registration process. The baseline configuration consists of the minimum information system security controls required under FISMA for information systems. (See DOS Security Configuration Standards).\n\ni. Using the SSP system owners must document the information system security controls identified in the system baseline and verify each as planned, implemented, partially implemented, or not applicable. (See DT/IA Web site for the most current template.)\n\nj. Baselined security controls must be implemented without exception.\n\nk. System owners may enhance mandatory security controls without waiver or deviation (without changing the non-major application designation if the application has been identified as a non-major application). The SSP must document the enhancements, and these enhancements must be reported in the system’s POA&M master database, if these enhancements affect a material weakness or system vulnerability.\n\nl. To strengthen its security posture without a waiver, exception, or deviation, system owners in coordination with DT/IA Bureau Coordinators may add information security controls that are not mandatory for the selected security control baseline. These additional controls will not change a non-major application designation if the application has been identified as a non-major application. This process is known as control tailoring process.\n\nm. System owners must update, and report to the DT/IA POA&M team of the status of implementation and/or remediation of identified deficiencies of the information system security controls in the system’s POA&M.\n\n5 FAM 1066.1-3(A) Department Information Systems\n\n(CT:IM-324; 06-28-2024)\n\na. DT/IA must ensure systems authorization is performed on all Department information systems. (See 1 FAM 262.7-1 for SCI systems.)\n\nb. DT/IA must ensure system authorization is performed in accordance with the approved Department System Authorization Process Guide available on the DT/IA Web site.\n\nc. The Bureau of Diplomatic Security’s Evaluation and Verification Program, in compliance with the FISMA reporting requirements, must evaluate and validate system security controls in a yearly basis at minimum. Location-specific system security controls must be verified yearly as well as part of the systems authorization process. Results of these evaluations are reported to DT/IA Bureau Coordinators and must be included in the system’s POA&M. (See 1 FAM 273.3.)\n\nd. Security control baselines for Department systems must be established in accordance with Department guidelines using the impact level established during the iMatrix registration process and documented in the system’s SSP prior to commencement of the A&A process. (Contact DT/IA/ITSC A&A Bureau Coordinators for the most current security control guidelines.)\n\ne. Systems owners are responsible for all funding required to perform A&A of their systems.\n\n5 FAM 1066.1-3(B) Unclassified Non-Department-Owned Systems Processing Federal Information\n\n(CT:IM-324; 06-28-2024)\n\na. The executive director (or equivalent level) for bureau-sponsored non-Department entities processing federal information on behalf of the Department must register these systems in the Department’s iMatrix.\n\nb. Security control baselines for non-Department systems must be established in accordance with Department guidelines, using the impact level established during the iMatrix registration process, the requisite contract security requirements, and documented in the system’s SSP prior to commencement of A&A process. The non-Department entities must document the baseline in the system’s SSP, using the SSP template from NIST Special Publication 800-18. (Contact DT/IA Bureau Coordinators for the most current security control guidelines.)\n\nc. Contingency plans are required for non-Department-owned systems that process federal information on behalf of the Department. The non-Department entities must develop the contingency plans in accordance with NIST Special Publication 800-34, and ensure they are fully tested, at least annually. The executive director (or equivalent level) for bureau-sponsored non-Department entities must ensure that the contingency plans have been tested and the results reported to DT/IA/PLT.\n\nd. The Department’s Systems Authorization Process requires that a risk analysis be performed on non-Department-owned systems processing federal information on behalf of the Department.\n\ne. The executive director (or equivalent level) for a bureau-sponsored non-Department entity responsible for the federal information being processed by the non-Department entity on behalf of the Department must report in the POA&M the status of remediation of identified deficiencies of information system security controls contained in the baseline, as documented in the SSP.\n\nf. System Authorization of unclassified non-Department-owned systems must be performed in accordance with the Department’s System Authorization Process. The Department’s System Authorization Process can be found in the A&A Tool Kit.\n\ng. The executive director (or equivalent level) for bureaus sponsoring the non-Department entity processing or storing federal information on behalf of the Department must ensure the yearly self-assessments required for FISMA reporting are completed and the results provided to DT/IA. See the A&A Tool kit for the POA&M Process Guide.\n\n5 FAM 1066.1-3(C) Classified Non-Department-Owned Systems Processing Federal Information\n\n(CT:IM-324; 06-28-2024)\n\na. On behalf of the Department, the Cognizant Security Agency (CSA), in coordination with the Bureau of Diplomatic Security’s Industrial Security Division (DS/IS/IND), performs A&A of classified non-Department-owned systems operated by commercial firms and consultants under contractual agreement with the Department. (See National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) and 12 FAM 570.)\n\nb. Upon completion of A&A, DS/IS/IND must provide DS for sensitive compartmented information (SCI) systems and DT/IA for all other systems with a copy of the accreditation package, as approved by the Department’s AO. (See 1 FAM 271.2 paragraph e(7).)\n\nc. DS/IS/IND must conduct the yearly assessments required for FISMA reporting for those commercial firms and consultants under contractual agreement processing classified information on behalf of the Department. DS/IS/IND must provide the results of these assessments to DT/IA and the executive director (or equivalent level) for bureau-sponsoring non-Department entities for inclusion into the sponsoring bureau’s POA&M.\n\nd. The sponsoring bureau must ensure the yearly self-assessments required for FISMA reporting for non-Department entities processing information on behalf of the Department without a contractual agreement with the Department (i.e., State, local government agencies, etc.) are conducted. The sponsoring bureau must provide the results of these self-assessments to DT/IA and the executive director (or equivalent level) for bureau-sponsoring non-Department entities for inclusion into the sponsoring bureau’s POA&M.\n\n5 FAM 1066.1-4 Vulnerability Scanning\n\n(CT:IM-290; 09-15-2022)\n\na. Using appropriate techniques and IT CCB-approved vulnerability scanning tools, DS/CTS, the Evaluation and Verification Program personnel, must scan for vulnerabilities in the information system periodically, as well as when significant new vulnerabilities affecting the system are identified and reported.\n\nb. Vulnerability scanning tools should include the capability to readily update the list of vulnerabilities scanned.\n\nc. DS/CTS, the Evaluation and Verification Program personnel, must update the list of information system vulnerabilities when discovered.\n\nd. Vulnerability scanning procedures must include steps to ensure adequate scan coverage and include both vulnerabilities checked and information system components scanned.\n\ne.
