        "text": "Overview\n\nFinancial Risks from Climate Change\n\nWe live in a complex world in which crises proliferate and magnify risks to our financial system. Climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, resulting in property damage, business disruption, and the devaluation of investments and other assets. To continue to thrive in the face of global competition, it is essential that New York financial institutions integrate consideration of the financial risks from climate change into their governance frameworks, risk management processes, and business strategies and start developing their approach to climate-related financial disclosure.\n\nBecause of the importance of this issue, DFS has joined the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), a group of central bankers and supervisors committed to managing financial risks from climate change globally, and the Sustainable Insurance Forum (SIF), an international network of insurance supervisors dedicated to helping the global insurance industry meet the challenges posed by climate change. DFS intends to continue engaging with all stakeholders to develop expert guidance in this critical area.\n\nBanking Guidance\n\nOn December 21, 2023, DFS issued Guidance for New York State Regulated Banking and Mortgage Institutions Relating to Management of Material Financial and Operational Risks from Climate Change. The Guidance covers New York State-regulated banking organizations, New York State-licensed branches and agencies of foreign banking organizations, and New York State-regulated mortgage bankers and mortgage servicers.\n\nPrior to issuance of this guidance, DFS carefully considered all feedback received from regulated entities and other key stakeholders on the proposed Guidance published in December 2022. In response to feedback, the Department has published resources to assist organizations as they work to adopt measures that address their climate-related risk.\n\nOn January 11, 2024, DFS hosted a webinar which provided an overview of the Guidance and key changes made after consideration of public feedback on the proposed guidance issued in December 2022. Resources from that webinar can be found in the Webinars & Events section below.\n\nBanking Industry Letters\n\nOn October 29, 2020, DFS issued an Industry Letter outlining its expectations related to addressing the financial risks from climate change to all New York-regulated banking organizations, branches and agencies of foreign banking organizations, mortgage bankers and servicers, and limited purpose trust companies, as well as New York-regulated non-depositories (other than New York-regulated mortgage bankers, mortgage servicers, and limited purpose trust companies), including New York regulated money transmitters, licensed lenders, sales finance companies, premium finance agencies, and virtual currency companies.\n\nIndustry Letter - October 29th, 2020 - Climate Change and Financial Risks\n\nOn February 9, 2021, DFS issued an industry letter alerting banking institutions subject to the New York Community Reinvestment Act that they may receive credit for financing activities that support the climate resiliency of low- and moderate-income, and underserved communities.\n\nIndustry Letter - February 9th, 2021 - CRA Consideration for Activities that Contribute to Climate Mitigation and Adaptation\n\nInsurance Guidance\n\nOn November 15, 2021, DFS issued final Guidance for New York Domestic Insurers on Managing the Financial Risks from Climate Change, detailing the Department's expectations related to insurers' management of the financial risks from climate change. After issuing proposed guidance in March, DFS received comments from a broad range of stakeholders, including insurers, trade groups, consumer advocates, climate experts, rating agencies and other financial regulators. The final guidance reflects the Department's careful consideration of all comments received.\n\nThe guidance was informed by an ongoing dialogue with the insurance industry and international regulators and is based on New York Insurance Law, National Association of Insurance Commissioners manuals, and the work of international regulators and networks. Building on an earlier Insurance Circular Letter on Climate Change and Financial Risks sent to to all New York-regulated domestic and foreign insurance companies outlining its expectations related to addressing the financial risks from climate change, the guidance sets out the Department's expectations that all New York insurers start integrating the consideration of the financial risks from climate change into their governance frameworks, business strategies, risk management processes and scenario analysis, and developing their approach to climate-related financial disclosure.\n\nRead the final November 15, 2021 Guidance for New York Domestic Insurers on Managing the Financial Risks from Climate Change (PDF)\n\nInsurance Circular Letters\n\nOn September 22, 2020, DFS issued Circular Letter No. 15 (2020) to all New York-regulated domestic and foreign insurance companies outlining its expectations related to addressing the financial risks from climate change.\n\nRead Insurance Circular Letter No. 15 - September 22nd, 2020: Climate Change and Financial Risks\n\nProposed Guidance\n\nRead the Proposed Guidance for New York Domestic Insurers on Managing the Financial Risks from Climate Change (PDF)\n\nReview the comments received on the proposed guidance: Comments on the proposed guidance\n\nReview a blacklined version of the final guidance reflecting changes from the proposed guidance: Blacklined final guidance\n\nInsurance FAQs\n\nTo which insurers does Insurance Circular Letter No. 15 (2020) (the “Circular Letter”) apply?\n\n+\n\nThe Circular Letter is addressed to all New York domestic and authorized foreign insurers. DFS believes that addressing the financial risks from climate change is critical to the solvency and liquidity of the insurance industry. DFS oversight over domestic and authorized foreign insurers, however, is not identical.\n\nDoes DFS plan to issue new regulations pertaining to its climate-related supervisory activities?\n\n+\n\nNo. DFS does not currently plan to issue regulations pertaining to its climate-related supervisory activities, with the exception of Insurance Regulation 203, which we are proposing to amend to include climate change as one of the reasonably foreseeable and relevant material risks to be addressed by insurers’ enterprise risk management function.\n\nWhat is DFS’s timeline with respect to the expectations set forth in the Circular Letter?\n\n+\n\nAs stated in the Circular Letter, questions pertaining to an insurer’s approach and activities related to the financial risks from climate change have been integrated into DFS’s examination process. Insurers will receive information requests related to climate in their First Day Letters to prepare for these exams. DFS issued final Guidance for New York Domestic Insurers on Managing the Financial Risks from Climate Change on November 15, 2021.\n\nDoes the reference to “insurers’ assets” in DFS’s guidance for insurers on managing the financial risks from climate change apply to third party funds managed by insurers?\n\n+\n\nNo. The reference to “insurers’ assets” in DFS’s guidance does not apply to third party funds managed by insurers.\n\nMay the designation of a board member or board committee as accountable for the insurer’s assessment and management of the financial risks from climate change be done at the holding company level (and satisfy the requirements for the group as a whole) or must it be done at the insurer level?\n\n+\n\nIt may be done at either the holding company level or the insurer level.\n\nWhat are DFS’s plans with respect to scenario analysis and stress testing?\n\n+\n\nRefer to the Guidance for New York Domestic Insurers on Managing the Financial Risks from Climate Change for more information on DFS expectations regarding scenario analysis and stress testing.\n\nAre insurers expected to include climate considerations into their Own Risk and Solvency Assessments (ORSAs) in 2021?\n\n+\n\nDFS encourages insurers to consider the financial risks from climate change as they perform their ORSAs but understands that it will take time for companies to include climate considerations in their ORSAs where appropriate. Refer to the Guidance for New York Domestic Insurers on Managing the Financial Risks from Climate Change for more information on expectations regarding ORSAs.\n\nWill DFS require Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD)-type disclosures or only encourage insurers to engage with TCFD on a voluntary basis?\n\n+\n\nThe TCFD has become a globally adopted framework by regulators and industry alike. Since 2019, insurers may submit TCFD reports in lieu of responding to the NAIC Climate Risk Disclosure Survey, which some insurers have done. DFS understands that the four major components of TCFD (governance, strategy, risks, and metrics and targets) require different levels of sophistication and resources to complete. As such, DFS will continue to engage with industry participants on implementation of the various TCFD components. Refer to the Guidance for New York Domestic Insurers on Managing the Financial Risks from Climate Change for more information on DFS expectations regarding public disclosure.\n\nHow can I access the information covered in the DFS Climate Change Seminar Series?\n\n+\n\nIn order to ensure open discussion during the seminars, recordings of the seminars have not been made public. However, most of the content covered during the seminars can be found in publicly available disclosure by several companies, including those represented by panelists in the DFS Climate Change Seminar Series. In particular, companies’ public sustainability or TCFD (Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures) reports, CDP disclosures (a free account needs to be set up to access the CDP responses), and NAIC Climate Risk Disclosure Survey responses are good sources of information.\n\nCan you explain some of the climate-related acronyms frequently used in the seminars?\n\n+\n\nCDP – Carbon Disclosure Project nonprofit\n\nEIOPA – European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority\n\nESG – Environmental, social, and governance\n\nEU – European Union\n\nEV – Electric vehicles\n\nIPCC - Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\n\nPCAF – The Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials\n\nPACTA - Paris Agreement Capital Transition Assessment\n\nRCP - Representative Concentration Pathway\n\nSDS – Sustainable Development Scenario (pdf)\n\nUN PRI – United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment\n\nTCFD – Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures\n\nReports\n\nUpdate on New York Domestic Insurers' Management of the Financial Risks from Climate Change - An Analysis of NAIC Climate Risk Disclosure Survey Reponses and Other Reporting\n\nAs part of ongoing efforts of DFS to evaluate insurers’ management of climate-related financial risks and provide resources that will accelerate the industry’s progress, DFS has issued the Update on New York Domestic Insurers' Management of the Financial Risks from Climate Change - An Analysis of NAIC Climate Risk Disclosure Survey Reponses and Other Reporting. This latest report contains the results of the Department's review and analysis of insurers' responses to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners’ (NAIC) Climate Risk Disclosure Survey for reporting year 2021. The report covers 83 insurance groups and 13 unaffiliated insurers with countrywide premiums ranging from $100 million to almost $200 billion.\n\nIssuance of the update follows the NAIC’s revision of the Survey questions to align with the widely adopted Task Force for Climate-Related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) standards. This report focuses on the following TCFD pillars covered in the survey: governance, risk management, strategy, and metrics and targets, reviewing progress across the industry and by line of business.\n\nOver three reporting years, DFS has rated insurers’ responses according to their level of progress in implementing the Guidance for New York Domestic Insurers on Managing the Financial Risks from Climate Change issued in November 2021, detailing supervisory expectations for New York domestic insurers’ management and disclosure of their climate risks. Insurers’ responses were rated in one of four categories: “Yet to Start,” “Early Stage,” “Making Progress,” or “Good Progress.”\n\nThe Department's previous reports New York Domestic Insurers’ Understanding and Management of the Financial Risks from Climate Change - An Analysis of NAIC Climate Risk Disclosure Survey Responses and Other Reporting for reporting year 2019, and Update on New York Domestic Insurers' Management of the Financial Risks from Climate Change - An Analysis of NAIC Climate Risk Disclosure Survey Reponses and Other Reporting for reporting year 2020, also contain examples of good practices described in responses.\n\nThis update provides a comparison of rating levels achieved for each TCFD pillar over the reporting years 2019-2021 and shows that the most improvement occurred in ratings of governance-related disclosures. A key factor in that development was that the Department had set an August 15, 2022 implementation timeline for guidance expectations relating to governance.\n\nAs the Department has done since issuing the guidance, DFS will continue to leverage the results of the annual Climate Risk Disclosure Survey to:\n\nAssess insurers’ overall progress in identifying, assessing, and managing climate risks in keeping with guidance expectations, and, as appropriate, develop additional direction on implementation;\n\nIdentify additional good practices that can be shared with the industry; and\n\nSupport risk-based supervision by identifying insurers that appear to lag, generally or in a specific area, compared to their peers, and by engaging in bilateral discussions to understand their challenges and highlight areas for improvement.\n\nInsurers’ ratings will be used only for DFS supervisory purposes and will not be publicly disclosed.\n\nWebinars & Events\n\n2024 Webinar on Banking Guidance\n\nDFS hosted a webinar on January 11, 2024 to provide an overview of the Guidance for New York State Regulated Banking and Mortgage Institutions Relating to Management of Material Financial and Operational Risks from Climate Change issued by DFS.
