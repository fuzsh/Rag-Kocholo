        "text": "Covered Entities may not have to comply with some or all of the Cybersecurity Regulation’s requirements if they qualify for an exemption. There are two types of exemptions: full and limited, both of which are in section 500.19. This section first explains what qualifies a Covered Entity for an exemption, then describes the cybersecurity requirements a Covered Entity must comply with if it qualifies for an exemption, and finally provides directions on how to submit notifications to the Department regarding a Covered Entity’s exempt status.\n\nQualifications for Full Exemptions\n\nThree subsections of 500.19 provide for full exemptions: 500.19(b), 500.19(e), and 500.19(g).\n\nTo qualify for a 500.19(b) exemption, a Covered Entity must be an employee, agent, wholly owned subsidiary, representative, or designee of another DFS-regulated business and all aspects of the Covered Entity’s business must be fully covered by the Cybersecurity Program of the other DFS-regulated business.\n\nTo qualify for a 500.19(e) exemption, a Covered Entity must be an inactive individual insurance broker (subject to Insurance Law section 2104) who (1) does not maintain, control or use, even indirectly, any Information Systems and does not have any Nonpublic Information; (2) has not, for anything of value, acted or aided in any manner in soliciting, negotiating, or selling any policy or contract or in placing risks or taking out insurance on behalf of another person for at least one year; and (3) does not otherwise qualify as a Covered Entity (for example, does not hold another type of license). For exact language, see 500.19(e).\n\nTo qualify for a 500.19(g) exemption, a Covered Entity must not otherwise qualify as a Covered Entity by virtue of another license and must be (1) a charitable annuity society, (2) a risk retention group not chartered in NY, (3) an individual insurance agent placed in inactive status under Insurance Law §2103, (4) an individual mortgage loan originator placed in inactive status under Banking Law §599-i, or (5) an accredited reinsurer, certified reinsurer, or recognized reciprocal jurisdiction reinsurer pursuant to 11 NYCRR Part 125. For exact language, see 500.19(g).\n\nQualifications for Limited Exemptions\n\nThree subsections of section 500.19 provide for limited exemptions: 500.19(a), 500.19(c), and 500.19(d).\n\nThere are three ways a Covered Entity may qualify for a 500.19(a) limited exemption:\n\nA Covered Entity and its Affiliates combined must have fewer than 20 employees and independent contractors (500.19(a)(1));\n\nA Covered Entity must have less than $7,500,000 in gross annual revenue in each of the last 3 fiscal years from all of its business operations combined with its Affiliates’ business operations in New York State (500.19(a)(2)); or\n\nA Covered Entity must have less than $15,000,000 in year-end total assets, including assets of all Affiliates.\n\nAffiliate, for purposes of the Cybersecurity Regulation and determining whether a Covered Entity qualifies for any of the 500.19(a) exemptions, is defined very broadly as “any person that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with another person.” Control here “means the possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person, whether through the ownership of stock of such person or otherwise.” (500.1(a))\n\nTo qualify for a 500.19(c) limited exemption, a Covered Entity must not directly or indirectly operate, maintain, utilize, or control any Information Systems, and must not be required to, directly or indirectly control, own, access, generate, receive, or possess Nonpublic Information.\n\nTo qualify for a 500.19(d) limited exemption, a Covered Entity must be a captive insurance company that does not and is not required to directly or indirectly control, own, access, generate, receive, or possess Nonpublic Information other than information relating to its corporate parent company or affiliates.\n\nCybersecurity Requirements for Exempt Covered Entities\n\nIf a Covered Entity qualifies for a full exemption, it must submit a Notice of Exemption to DFS. As long as it remains qualified for a full exemption, it does not have to comply with any other section of the Cybersecurity Regulation.\n\nIf a Covered Entity qualifies for a Section 500.19(a), (c), or (d) limited exemption, it must submit a Notice of Exemption, comply with some sections of the Cybersecurity Regulation (which sections depend on the type of limited exemption and are listed in the table below), and submit annually a notice regarding the Covered Entity’s compliance with Part 500.\n\nThe below table outlines what sections of the regulation a Covered Entity is exempt from and must comply with if it qualifies for a Section 500.19(a) exemption.\n\nExemptions:Compliance Requirements:500.4\n\nCybersecurity governance500.2\n\nCybersecurity program500.5\n\nVulnerability management500.3\n\nCybersecurity policy500.6\n\nAudit trail500.7\n\nAccess privileges and management500.8\n\nApplication security500.9\n\nRisk assessment500.10\n\nCybersecurity personnel and intelligence500.11\n\nThird-party service provider security policy500.14(a)(1)\n\nMonitor user activity500.12\n\nMulti-factor authentication\n\n(as of November 1, 2024)500.14(a)(2)\n\nImplement risk-based controls to protect against malicious code500.13\n\nData retention requirements\n\n(as of November 1, 2025, this will also include asset management requirements)500.14(b)\n\nMonitoring and training – for Class A companies500.14(a)(3)\n\nProvide cybersecurity awareness training (as of November 1, 2024)500.15\n\nEncryption of nonpublic information500.17\n\nNotices to superintendent500.16\n\nIncident response and business continuity management\n\nThe below table outlines what sections of the regulation a Covered Entity is exempt from and must comply with if it qualifies for a Section 500.19(c) or (d) exemption.\n\nExemptions:Compliance Requirements:500.2\n\nCybersecurity program500.9\n\nRisk assessment500.3\n\nCybersecurity policy500.11\n\nThird-party service provider security policy500.4\n\nCybersecurity governance500.13\n\nAccess management and data retention requirements\n\n(as of November 1, 2025, this will also include asset management requirements)500.5\n\nVulnerability management500.17\n\nNotices to superintendent500.6\n\nAudit trail500.7\n\nAccess privileges and management500.8\n\nApplication security500.10\n\nCybersecurity personnel and intelligence500.12\n\nMulti-factor authentication500.14\n\nMonitoring and training500.15\n\nEncryption of nonpublic information500.16\n\nIncident response and business continuity management\n\nSubmitting Notice of Exemption Regarding Exempt Status\n\nCovered Entities that have determined they qualify for an exemption should submit a Notice of Exemption within 30 days of making that determination. 500.19(f). Some Covered Entities qualify for more than one exemption, and they can indicate that on their Notice of Exemption.\n\nCovered Entities must submit their Notices of Exemption through the DFS Portal. Detailed instructions for making this submission can be found in the Instructions on How to File a Notice of Exemption (PDF).\n\nAmending a Filed Exemption\n\nIf a Covered Entity no longer qualifies for an exemption, it should amend or terminate its Notice of Exemption within 30 days. A Covered Entity should amend its Notice of Exemption when its qualifications for an exemption change, but it still qualifies for at least one exemption. Covered Entities must amend their Notices of Exemption through the DFS Portal. Detailed instructions for amending exemption status can be found in the Instructions on How to Amend Previously Filed Notices of Exemptions (PDF).\n\nTerminating a Filed Exemption\n\nA Covered Entity that no longer qualifies for any exemption must terminate their exemption as soon as reasonably possible after they no longer qualify. No matter when the termination is submitted, however, the Covered Entity has 180 days from the date they are no longer qualified to become fully compliant with the Cybersecurity Regulation. Covered Entities must terminate their Notices of Exemption through the DFS Portal. Detailed instructions for notifying DFS that a Covered Entity no longer qualifies for an exemption can be found in the Instructions on How to Terminate Previously Filed Notices of Exemption (PDF).\n\nBulk Exemption Submissions\n\nCovered Entities that employ 50 or more individual Covered Entities that qualify for the same exemption may file exemptions on behalf of those employees through the bulk submission process.\n\nCovered Entities that qualify and would like access to use the bulk submission process should email the Department at [email protected] from the email address associated with their DFS Portal account, and the Department will send further instructions. The submitter will need to provide their name, DFS identification number, type of license, and email address for every Covered Entity on whose behalf they are submitting. The Covered Entity using the bulk submission process will be able to add and terminate exemptions as their employees’ employment and exemption status changes.\n\nCovered Entities that have their Notice of Exemption filed as part of a bulk filing will receive an email from DFS confirming the filing. The email will include a receipt number and list the exemption(s) filed. Covered Entities must retain a copy of this receipt number for future reference as it will be the only receipt you will get from DFS regarding the submission.\n\nPlease note that Covered Entities are ultimately responsible for ensuring their compliance with Part 500. Therefore, a Covered Entity must ensure that either their employer or they notify the Department of any changes in status.\n\nSubmission Confirmation\n\nAfter each submission is complete, the submitter will receive an email that includes a receipt number. The email receipt is the only confirmation of the submission that the submitter will receive. The receipt number is an important piece of information that should be kept by the Covered Entity. Covered Entities may need their receipt numbers to renew their licenses.\n\nCybersecurity Compliance Submission Notice: If you are experiencing password login issues when trying to submit your annual cybersecurity filing, visit the Lost Passwords and Locked Accounts Portal page and follow the instructions. You will need a DFS Portal account to submit a cybersecurity filing via the DFS Portal – your LINX username and password will not work to access DFS Portal. The system is currently experiencing a high volume of submissions, which may result in system time outs. It this occurs while logging in or submitting your filing, please try again.\n\nThis part of the Cybersecurity Resource Center has been developed specifically for DFS-regulated individuals and small businesses. It is intended to provide clear, step-by-step instructions for complying with the Cybersecurity Regulation.\n\nStep 1. Determine whether you need to comply with the Cybersecurity Regulation.\n\nIf you have a license issued by DFS or are otherwise regulated by DFS, you must comply with the Cybersecurity Regulation. That is because the Cybersecurity Regulation applies to all individuals and small businesses that are “operating under or required to operate under a license, registration, charter, certificate, permit, accreditation or similar authorization” under the Banking, Insurance or Financial Services Laws. Section 500.1(e).\n\nStep 2. Determine whether you qualify for any of the exemptions listed in the Cybersecurity Regulation.\n\nMany individual brokers, agents, and adjusters, as well as some small businesses, qualify for an exemption. The exemptions are listed in Section 500.19 and fall into two categories: full and limited.\n\nExemptions available to DFS-regulated individuals and small businesses\n\nFull Exemptions\n\nThree subsections of 500.19 provide for full exemptions: 500.19(b), 500.19(e), and 500.19(g).\n\nTo qualify for a 500.19(b) exemption, a Covered Entity must be an employee, agent, wholly owned subsidiary, representative or designee of another DFS-regulated business and all aspects of the Covered Entity’s business must be fully covered by the Cybersecurity Program of the other DFS-regulated business (referred to as the Covering Entity). Individuals who only work for one company and do not work on any other outside matters typically qualify for this exemption.\n\nTo qualify for a 500.19(e) exemption, a Covered Entity must be an inactive individual insurance broker (subject to Insurance Law section 2104) who (1) does not maintain, control or use, even indirectly, any Information Systems and does not have any Nonpublic Information; (2) has not, for anything of value, acted or aided in any manner in soliciting, negotiating or selling any policy or contract or in placing risks or taking out insurance on behalf of another person for at least one year; and (3) does not otherwise qualify as a Covered Entity (for example, does not hold another type of license). For exact language, see 500.19(e).\n\nTo qualify for a 500.19(g) exemption, a Covered Entity must not otherwise qualify as a Covered Entity by virtue of another license and must be (1) a charitable annuity society, (2) a risk retention group not chartered in NY, (3) an individual insurance agent placed in inactive status under Insurance Law §2103, (4) an individual mortgage loan originator placed in inactive status under Banking Law §599-i, or (5) an accredited reinsurer, certified reinsurer, or recognized reciprocal jurisdiction reinsurer pursuant to 11 NYCRR Part 125. For exact language, see 500.19(g).\n\nWhether you qualify for one of these exemptions depends on your specific circumstances. DFS cannot make that determination for you.\n\nLimited Exemptions\n\nIf you don’t qualify for any of the full exemptions, you may qualify for a limited exemption, which means that, if you qualify, you must submit a Notice of Exemption through the DFS Portal, comply with certain sections of the Cybersecurity Regulation (which we will discuss in Step 4), and submit an annual Certification of Material Compliance or Acknowledgment of Noncompliance.\n\nThe following are the most common exemptions for small businesses and individuals: Sections 500.19(a)(1), 500.19(a)(2), and 500.19(a)(3).\n\nTo qualify under Section 500.19(a)(1), a business, along with any Affiliates, must have fewer than 20 employees and independent contractors.\n\nTo qualify under Section 500.19(a)(2), an individual or business must have less than $7,500,000 in gross annual revenue in each of the last 3 fiscal years from all of its business operations combined with its Affiliates’ business operations in New York State.\n\nTo qualify under Section 500.19(a)(3), an individual or business must have less than $15,000,000 in year-end total assets, including assets of all Affiliates.\n\nAffiliate, for purposes of the Cybersecurity Regulation and determining whether any of the 500.19(a) exemptions apply, is defined very broadly as “any person that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with another person.” Control here “means the possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person, whether through the ownership of stock of such person or otherwise.”\n\nIndividuals and small businesses may also qualify for the limited exemption set forth in Section 500.19(c) if they (1) do not operate, maintain, use, or control a computer or other device that holds electronic data, including phones; and (2) do not, and are not required to, control, own, access, generate, receive, or possess confidential customer and other sensitive business and private information.\n\nYou may qualify for more than one of the limited exemptions listed above. If you do, you should indicate that when you submit your Notice of Exemption.\n\nWhether you qualify for an exemption depends on your specific circumstances. DFS cannot make that determination for you.\n\nIf you do NOT qualify for an exemption, you must comply with all sections of the Cybersecurity Regulation and can skip Steps 3 and 4.\n\nStep 3. If you qualify for one or more limited exemptions or the 500.19(b) or 500.19(e) full exemptions, submit a Notice of Exemption.\n\nTo receive the benefits of qualifying for an exemption, you must submit a Notice of Exemption through the DFS Portal (see instructions on setting up a DFS Portal account.)\n\nNote that if you qualify for a full exemption pursuant to Section 500.19(b), you will need to provide the name of the Covering Entity (the DFS-regulated entity whose cybersecurity program covers all aspects of your work) when submitting your Notice of Exemption. If your business qualifies for the Section 19(b) exemption because it is a wholly owned subsidiary of another DFS-regulated entity, you will need to provide the name of your DFS-regulated parent company whose cybersecurity program covers all aspects of your business’s work. You or your business cannot claim yourself or itself as the Covering Entity or parent company.\n\nNotices of Exemption are good until they are terminated which means you do not need to submit a Notice each year; however, if you qualify for a full exemption pursuant to Sections 500.19(b), (e), or (g), you should review your status every year to determine whether you still qualify for the exemption. If you qualify for a limited exemption pursuant to Sections 500.19(a), (c), or (d), you will be asked whether you still qualify for an exemption when you submit your annual Certification of Material Compliance or Acknowledgment of Noncompliance.\n\nIf your qualifications for an exemption have changed (for example, when you stop working for the DFS-regulated company or stop using their cybersecurity program), you are responsible for making sure your exemption is amended or terminated. If your company submitted a Notice of Exemption on your behalf, the company may terminate your exemption, but it is your responsibility to make sure that is done.\n\nInstructions on How to File a Notice of Exemption (PDF)\n\nInstructions on How to Amend Previously Filed Notices of Exemptions (PDF)\n\nInstructions on How to Terminate Previously Filed Notices of Exemption (PDF)\n\nIf you qualify for a full exemption and have submitted your Notice of Exemption, you do not need to proceed past this step. However, if you only qualify for one or more limited exemptions pursuant to Section 500.19(a), (c) or (d), you must submit a Notice of Exemption AND proceed to Step 4.\n\nStep 4. If you qualify for one of the limited exemptions, determine which sections of the Cybersecurity Regulation you must comply with.\n\nIf you qualify for a Section 500.19(a)(1), (2), or (3) exemption, you are still required to: maintain a cybersecurity program as required in Section 500.2 and cybersecurity policies as required in Section 500.3; limit access privileges as required in Section 500.7; conduct a Risk Assessment as required by Section 500.9; implement a Third-Party Service Provider policy as required by Section 500.11; limit data retention as required in Section 500.13; and provide notices to DFS as required by Section 500.17, which includes submitting cybersecurity incident and extortion payment notifications and annual notifications regarding its compliance.\n\nAdditionally, starting in November 2024, you will also be required to comply with the MFA requirements in Section 500.12 and provide cybersecurity awareness training pursuant to Section 500.14(a)(3).\n\nIf you qualify for a Section 500.19(c) or (d) exemption, you are still required to: conduct a Risk Assessment as required by Section 500.9; implement a Third-Party Service Provider policy as required by Section 500.11; limit data retention as required in Section 500.13; and provide notices to the Superintendent as required by Section 500.17, which includes submitting cybersecurity incident and extortion payment notifications and annual notifications regarding its compliance.\n\nImportantly, if you qualify for a limited exemption, you still must submit a Certification of Material Compliance or an Acknowledgment of Noncompliance by April 15 every year pursuant to Section 500.17. However, you only need to certify that you are materially complying with the sections of the Cybersecurity Regulation that are applicable to you or acknowledge your noncompliance with those sections.\n\nStep 5. Take action to comply with the sections of the Cybersecurity Regulation applicable to you.\n\nOnce you determine which sections of the Cybersecurity Regulation apply to you (see Step 4), take action to comply. You can use the short descriptions below to prepare a list of the sections that apply to you along with any needed actions.\n\nSection 500.2 – Maintain a cybersecurity program. This section requires you to have a cybersecurity program that enables you or your company to identify and assess cybersecurity risks; protect nonpublic information (such as confidential customer information or sensitive business information) and the computers, phones, and other electronic devices storing such information from unauthorized access and other malicious acts; detect, respond, and recover from cybersecurity events; and comply with applicable regulatory reporting obligations.\n\nSection 500.3 – Maintain cybersecurity policies. This section requires you to establish and maintain written cybersecurity policies that essentially comprise the framework for your cybersecurity program. These policies should be created after an assessment of your cybersecurity risks. Those risks include how much data you hold, the types of data you hold, the number of people who can access that data, and other similar factors. DFS partnered with the Global Cyber Alliance (GCA) to develop a set of cybersecurity policy templates which can provide a helpful starting point for individuals and small businesses.\n\nYou only need to establish and maintain policies that are relevant to your business, but you must consider whether you need policies that cover the following topics and controls, all of which are listed in Section 500.3:\n\nInformation security\n\nData governance and classification\n\nAsset inventory and device management\n\nAccess controls and identity management\n\nBusiness continuity and disaster recovery planning and resources\n\nSystems operations and availability concerns\n\nSystems and network security\n\nSystems and network monitoring\n\nSystems and application development and quality assurance\n\nPhysical security and environmental controls\n\nCustomer data privacy\n\nVendor and third-party provider management\n\nRisk assessment\n\nIncident response\n\nAs of April 29, 2024, you will also be required to consider whether you need policies that cover the following areas:\n\nData retention\n\nEnd of life management\n\nRemote access\n\nSecurity awareness and training\n\nApplication security\n\nIncident notification\n\nVulnerability management\n\nYour policies need to be approved by your senior leadership, such as a senior officer or manager or an appropriate committee of your board (if one exists).\n\nSection 500.7 – Control who can access your computer system and nonpublic information. This section requires you to know who has access to the confidential customer and business information held by your business AND to limit that access to people who need it for their job. This section also requires you to periodically review who has and needs such access.\n\nAs of May 1, 2025, you must also impose limits with respect to privileged accounts, only allow secure connections where devices can be remotely controlled, promptly terminate access when employees leave, and have a written password policy that meets industry standards, among other things.\n\nSection 500.9 – Conduct risk assessments. You must base your cybersecurity program on the identification, evaluation, and prioritization of cybersecurity risks to your business operations, including but not limited to risks to your Information Systems, the Nonpublic Information maintained on those systems, and your customers. You must conduct periodic risk assessments in accordance with written policies and procedures which have to include: the criteria you will use to evaluate and categorize identified cybersecurity risks and threats; the criteria you will use to assess the confidentiality, integrity, security, and availability of your Information Systems and the Nonpublic Information maintained on them; and requirements that describe how identified risks will be controlled, minimized, or accepted and how your cybersecurity program will address those risks. These assessments must be reviewed and updated at least annually and when any changes to your business or technology materially impacts your cyber risk.\n\nSection 500.11 – Maintain a policy regarding the use of third-party service providers. You must have written policies and procedures designed to ensure the security of the confidential customer and sensitive business information that is accessible to, or held by, third parties. A third party, for purposes of the Cybersecurity Regulation, is an individual or organization that provides services to you, has access to your confidential customer and other sensitive business information, and is not affiliated with you or your company. Law firms, internet hosting companies, and electronic storage providers are examples of third-party service providers.\n\nSection 500.13 – Limit the data you keep. You must not keep confidential customer and sensitive business information any longer than it is needed for business purposes. A legitimate business purpose includes anything you are required to retain by law or regulation.\n\nAs of November 1, 2025, you will also need to have policies in place to implement and maintain an up-to-date asset inventory covering your information systems.\n\nSection 500.17 – The following are required notifications to DFS:\n\nAnnual Compliance Submissions – Submit either a Certification of Material Compliance or an Acknowledgment of Noncompliance each year by April 15th regarding your compliance during the previous calendar year.\n\nIf you were materially compliant with all sections of the Cybersecurity Regulation that applied to you during the previous calendar year, submit a Certification of Material Compliance.\n\nIf you cannot certify that you were in material compliance with the sections of the Cybersecurity Regulation that were applicable to you during the prior calendar year, you must submit an Acknowledgment of Noncompliance which (1) acknowledges that you did not materially comply with all the requirements applicable to you; (2) identifies all sections of the Cybersecurity Regulation that you have not materially complied with; (3) describes the nature and extent of the noncompliance; and (4) provides a remediation timeline or confirmation that remediation has been completed.\n\nCybersecurity Incident Notifications – Notify DFS within 72 hours after you determine that you experienced a Cybersecurity Incident, which includes acts or attempts to gain unauthorized access to, disrupt, or misuse your Information Systems or the Nonpublic Information stored on those Information Systems that:\n\nimpacted you and required you to notify another government body, self-regulatory agency or any other supervisory body;\n\nhas a reasonable likelihood of materially harming any material part of your normal operations; or\n\nresulted in the deployment of ransomware within a material part of your Information Systems.\n\nExtortion Payment Notifications – If you make an extortion payment in connection with a Cybersecurity Event that occurred on your Information Systems, you must notify DFS within 24 hours of payment. Within 30 days of payment, you must provide the reasons payment was necessary, alternatives to payment that were considered and the diligence, or research, you conducted to find these alternatives. You must also describe the diligence you performed to ensure compliance with all applicable rules and regulations including those of the Office of Foreign Assets Control.\n\nIf you qualify for a Section 500.19(a) limited exemption, as of November 1, 2024, you will also need to comply with two other Sections of the Cybersecurity Regulation: Section 500.12 and Section 500.14(a)(3).\n\nSection 500.12 – Use multi-factor authentication (“MFA”) for any remote access you allow into your information systems, or to third-party applications where Nonpublic Information is accessible (including any cloud applications), or to privileged accounts. If – and only if – you have a CISO, you may be able to use reasonably equivalent or more secure compensating controls as long as the CISO approves and reviews the controls to ensure their reasonable equivalence at least annually.\n\nSection 500.14(a)(3) – Provide cybersecurity awareness training that includes social engineering for all personnel at least annually.\n\nIf you do not qualify for any exemption, then you must comply with all sections of the Cybersecurity Regulation. The above list does NOT include a discussion of all of the sections that are applicable to you if you don’t qualify for an exemption.\n\nStep 6. If you are complying with all of the sections of the Cybersecurity Regulation applicable to you, submit a Certification of Material Compliance annually by April 15. If not, submit an Acknowledgment of Noncompliance by April 15.\n\nIf you qualify for an exemption and are in material compliance with the sections of the Cybersecurity Regulation that are applicable to you, submit a Certification of Material Compliance by April 15 of each year through the DFS Portal.\n\nIf you cannot certify that you were in material compliance with the Cybersecurity Regulation for the prior calendar year, you must submit a written Acknowledgment of Noncompliance which (1) acknowledges that you did not materially comply with all the requirements applicable to you; (2) identifies all sections of Part 500 that you have not materially complied with; (3) describes the nature and extent of such noncompliance; and (4) provides a remediation timeline or confirmation that remediation has been completed. See Section 500.17(b).\n\nIf you do not qualify for an exemption, submit a Certification of Material Compliance or an Acknowledgment of Noncompliance by April 15 of each year through the DFS Portal.\n\nAnswers to Questions Frequently Asked by Individuals and Small Businesses\n\nQuestions regarding DFS Portal submissions (Section 500.17)\n\n1. What should I do if I am having trouble logging in to the DFS Portal or resetting my password?\n\n+\n\nNote: You will need to create a DFS Portal account, your LINX username and password will not work for DFS Portal. If you have a Portal account and have reset your password, and are still not able to log in, email [email protected] with “Trouble Logging into the Portal” or “Password Reset” in the subject line. If you haven’t received a response within 10 business days from the date you sent your message, DFS may not have received it. In this event, please resend your email.\n\n2. How can I confirm DFS received my submissions?\n\n+\n\nIf you did not receive an email from DFS after making a submission, you may email [email protected] with “Confirm My Submission” in the subject line. We will need your name or your company’s name (as it appears on the DFS license) and one of the following for you or your company: NYS License number, NAIC number, NMLS Identification number, or Institution number.\n\nQuestions regarding filing annual notifications regarding compliance (Certifications of Material Compliance and Acknowledgements of Noncompliance) (Section 500.17(b))\n\n3. If I am a non-resident Covered Entity, am I required to submit an annual notification regarding my compliance?\n\n+\n\nAll Covered Entities, including non-residents, are required to submit notifications of their compliance unless they qualify for a full exemption pursuant to Section 500.19(b), (e), or (f) and have filed a Notice of Exemption.\n\n4. If I am licensed by DFS but not currently working in the field, do I need to submit an annual notification regarding my compliance?\n\n+\n\nThe following inactive licensees who do not otherwise qualify as a Covered Entity (for example, who do not hold another type of license) are exempt from the annual requirement to notify DFS regarding their compliance:\n\ninactive individual insurance brokers (subject to Insurance Law section 2104) who (a) do not maintain, control or use, even indirectly, any Information Systems and do not have any Nonpublic Information, and (b) have not, for anything of value, acted or aided in any manner in soliciting, negotiating or selling any policy or contract or in placing risks or taking out insurance on behalf of another person for at least one year;\n\nindividual insurance agents placed in inactive status under Insurance Law §2103; and\n\nindividual mortgage loan originators placed in inactive status under Banking Law §599-i.\n\nIf none of the above apply to your situation, then as long as you are licensed by DFS, you need to comply with the Cybersecurity Regulation. However, you may qualify for the limited exemption pursuant to Section 500.19(c) which applies to any regulated entity or licensed Person that does not maintain any Information Systems and does not possess any Nonpublic Information, including information concerning former or potential customers. Even if you do qualify, Section 500.19(c) is a limited exemption that still requires compliance with certain provisions of the regulation (see table below), including the requirement to submit an annual Certification of Material Compliance or an Acknowledgment of Noncompliance.\n\n5. If I am an individual with no Board of Directors, who should sign my annual notification of compliance?\n\n+\n\nThe annual notification of compliance that is required by Section 500.17(b) must be signed by the Covered Entity’s highest-ranking executive and its Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”) or, if the Covered Entity does not have a CISO, the Senior Officer responsible for the cybersecurity program of the Covered Entity. If you are an individual, you should sign as the highest-ranking executive and if you don’t have a CISO – even a virtual one or one at a managed service provider – you should sign as the senior officer responsible for your cybersecurity program.\n\n6. Should I send supporting documentation with my annual submission regarding compliance?\n\n+\n\nYou do not need to send supporting documentation if you are submitting a Certification of Material Compliance. If you are submitting an Acknowledgment of Noncompliance, you must identify all sections of the Cybersecurity Regulation you did not materially comply with, describe the nature and extent of such noncompliance, and provide a remediation timeline or confirmation that remediation has been completed. No additional explanatory or other materials are required as part of these submissions.\n\nThe Cybersecurity Regulation does require, however, that Covered Entities maintain records, schedules, and data that support their annual notification – whether a certification or an acknowledgment -- for 5 years and provide such information to the Department upon request. The information you must keep includes, but is not limited to, the identification of all areas, systems, and processes that require or required material improvement, updating or redesign, remedial efforts undertaken to address such areas, systems and processes, and remediation plans and timelines for their implementation.\n\nQuestions About Limited Exemptions (500.19(a), (c), and (d))\n\n7. If I filed a Notice of Exemption from the Cybersecurity Regulation, do I need to file an annual notification of compliance?\n\n+\n\nIt depends on the exemption for which you qualify. If you qualify for a full exemption pursuant to Section 500.19(b), (e), or (g), and submitted a Notice of Exemption, you do not need to submit an annual notification regarding your compliance. If, however, you qualify for a limited exemption and filed a Notice of Exemption pursuant to Sections 500.19(a), (c) or (d), you do need to submit an annual notification regarding your compliance with the sections of the Cybersecurity Regulation applicable to you based on the exemption for which you qualify. For example, if you qualify for a Section 500.19(a) exemption, you must file an annual notification regarding your compliance only with Sections 500.2, 500.3, 500.7, 500.9, 500.11, and 500.17.\n\n8. When does the limited exemption in Section 500.19(a)(1) for Covered Entities with “fewer than 20 employees and independent contractors” of the Covered Entity and its Affiliates apply?\n\n+\n\nUnder Section 500.19(a)(1), which is also referred to as the Small Business Exemption, smaller Covered Entities are exempted from certain requirements of Part 500 when a Covered Entity and all of its Affiliates combined have a total of fewer than 20 employees and independent contractors. When determining whether a Covered Entity and its Affiliates have fewer than 20 employees and independent contractors, all of the Covered Entity’s employees and independent contractors and all of the Covered Entity’s Affiliates’ employees and independent contractors must be counted regardless of where any of the employees and independent contractors are located.\n\nNote that Affiliate is defined very broadly in Section 500.1 as any individual or entity, including but not limited to any partnership, corporation, branch, agency or association, that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with any other individual or entity, including but not limited to any partnership, corporation, branch, agency or association. For purposes of this definition, control means the possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person, whether through the ownership of stock of such person or otherwise.\n\nQuestions about full exemptions (Section 500.19(b))\n\n9. Am I qualified for an exemption under Section 500.19(b) if I am an employee, agent, representative or designee of more than one other Covered Entity?\n\n+\n\nYou are entitled to a Section 500.19(b) exemption in this case only if you are an employee, agent, representative, or designee that is fully covered by the cybersecurity program of one of the Covered Entities for which you are an employee, agent, representative or designee. In other words, if you are an employee, agent, representative or designee of more than one other Covered Entity, you will only qualify for a Section 500.19(b) exemption if the cybersecurity program of at least one of those Covered Entities fully covers all aspects of your business.\n\nWhen submitting the notice for a Section 19(b) exemption, you must provide the name of the Covered Entity whose cybersecurity program your business is covered by, along with the name of an individual at that Covered Entity who can verify the coverage.\n\n10. If my employer submitted an exemption for me through the bulk filing process, what do I need to do when I stop working for the company?\n\n+\n\nIf you work for a company that has 50 or more employees who qualify for an exemption, and your company has submitted a Notice of Exemption on your behalf through the bulk filing process, you must ask your employer to terminate your exemption when you stop working for that company. If you cannot confirm that they have done so, you may terminate your exemption. See the Instructions on How to Terminate Previously Filed Notices of Exemption to learn how to do so.\n\n11. Do I need to amend my Notice of Exemption if I changed my name or if my qualifications for an exemption have changed?\n\n+\n\nYes. If there are any changes, you should amend your Notice of Exemption by going to the DFS Portal where there is an option to choose “amend exemption.”\n\nDISCLAIMER: This part is explanatory and provided for informational purposes only. In the event of an inconsistency between this part and the Cybersecurity Regulation, the Cybersecurity Regulation will prevail.\n\nTools for Small Businesses\n\nAs doing business online becomes indispensable, it is essential that small businesses protect themselves and their customers from cybercrime. However, cybersecurity can be especially challenging for small businesses.\n\nThe Department is committed to supporting small businesses in this regard. To help improve their cybersecurity, DFS has partnered with the Global Cyber Alliance (GCA) to highlight the availability of free cybersecurity resources. GCA has created a Cybersecurity Toolkit for Small Business that contains a set of free tools, guidance, resources, and training for small businesses. It is targeted to small businesses that do not have a dedicated cybersecurity staff.\n\nBecause governance is critical to effective cybersecurity, DFS also partnered with GCA to develop sample cybersecurity policies. These policies are designed to help small businesses install the governance and procedures necessary for effective cybersecurity. The sample policies provide a helpful starting point for all small businesses.\n\nThe sample policies include:\n\nCybersecurity Policy\n\nAccess Control Policy\n\nAsset Inventory & Device Management Policy\n\nData Classification Policy\n\nPhysical & Environmental Security Policy\n\nRisk Assessment Policy\n\nSystem & Network Security Policy\n\nThird Party Service Provider Policy\n\nAll cybersecurity policies created by a business should be tailored to the business’s specific needs, risks, resources, and structure. Some businesses may require additional actions beyond those suggested in the sample policies; likewise, not every action suggested will be required for every business. Policies based only on the samples therefore may not constitute full compliance with state and federal laws and regulations, including the Cybersecurity Regulation. Best practices can also change over time.\n\nBusinesses should review their policies for accuracy, completeness, and applicability, and update them as needed based on their risk assessments.\n\nMore guidance for small businesses can be found in our Information for Small Businesses section.\n\nOther small business resources\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA)\n\nSmall Business Administration (SBA)\n\nCyber Readiness Institute\n\nCybercrime Support Network"
