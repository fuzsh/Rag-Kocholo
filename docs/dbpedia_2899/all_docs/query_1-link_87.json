Child welfare service principles; purpose.\n\n(A) Any intervention by the State into family life on behalf of children must be guided by law, by strong philosophical underpinnings, and by sound professional standards for practice. Child welfare services must be based on these principles:\n\n(1) Parents have the primary responsibility for and are the primary resource for their children.\n\n(2) Children should have the opportunity to grow up in a family unit if at all possible.\n\n(3) State and community agencies have a responsibility to implement prevention programs aimed at identifying high risk families and to provide supportive intervention to reduce occurrence of maltreatment.\n\n(4) Services for families should be accessible and designed to encourage and enable families to adequately deal with their problems within their own family system.\n\n(5) Child welfare intervention into a family's life should be structured so as to avoid a child's entry into the protective service and foster care systems if at all possible.\n\n(6) The state's child welfare system must be designed to be child-centered, family-focused, community-based, and culturally competent in its prevention and protection efforts.\n\n(7) Neighborhoods and communities are the primary source of opportunities and supports for families and have a primary responsibility in assuring the safety and vitality of their members.\n\n(8) The Department of Social Services shall collaborate with the community to identify, support, and treat families in a nonthreatening manner, in both investigative and family assessment situations.\n\n(9) A family assessment approach, stressing the safety of the child, building on the strengths of the family, and identifying and treating the family's needs is the appropriate approach for cases not requiring law enforcement involvement or the removal of the child.\n\n(10) Only a comparatively small percentage of current child abuse and neglect reports are criminal in nature or will result in the removal of the child or alleged perpetrator.\n\n(11) Should removal of a child become necessary, the state's foster care system must be prepared to provide timely and appropriate placements for children with relatives or in licensed foster care settings and to establish a plan which reflects a commitment by the State to achieving permanency for the child within reasonable timelines.\n\n(12) The Department of Social Services staff who investigates serious child abuse and neglect reports with law enforcement must be competent in law enforcement procedures, fact finding, evidence gathering, and effective social intervention and assessment.\n\n(13) Services should be identified quickly and should build on the strengths and resources of families and communities.\n\n(B) It is the purpose of this chapter to:\n\n(1) acknowledge the different intervention needs of families;\n\n(2) establish an effective system of services throughout the State to safeguard the well-being and development of endangered children and to preserve and stabilize family life, whenever appropriate;\n\n(3) ensure permanency on a timely basis for children when removal from their homes is necessary;\n\n(4) establish fair and equitable procedures, compatible with due process of law to intervene in family life with due regard to the safety and welfare of all family members; and\n\n(5) establish an effective system of protection of children from injury and harm while living in public and private residential agencies and institutions meant to serve them.\n\n(C) All child welfare intervention by the State has as its primary goal the welfare and safety of the child.\n\n(D) Beginning September 1, 2023, the department must provide to the General Assembly an annual report that enumerates each case accepted for investigation in which the department failed to comply with the time frames established in this chapter, the amount of time beyond the time frames established that the department required to complete the proceeding, and the good cause for the department's inability or failure to comply.\n\nHISTORY: 2008 Act No. 361, Section 2; 2023 Act No. 33 (S.612), Section 1, eff May 16, 2023.\n\nEffect of Amendment\n\n2023 Act No. 33, Section 1, redesignated (A)(5) as (C); in (A), redesignated former (6) to (14) as (5) to (13), respectively; and added (D).\n\nSECTION 63-7-20. Definitions.\n\nWhen used in this chapter or Chapter 9 or 11 and unless the specific context indicates otherwise:\n\n(1) \"Abandonment of a child\" means a parent or guardian wilfully deserts a child or wilfully surrenders physical possession of a child without making adequate arrangements for the child's needs or the continuing care of the child.\n\n(2) \"Affirmative determination\" means a finding by a preponderance of evidence that the child was abused or neglected by the person who is alleged or determined to have abused or neglected the child and who is mentioned by name in a report or finding. This finding may be made only by:\n\n(a) the court;\n\n(b) the Department of Social Services upon a final agency decision in its appeals process; or\n\n(c) waiver by the subject of the report of his right to appeal. If an affirmative determination is made by the court after an affirmative determination is made by the Department of Social Services, the court's finding must be the affirmative determination.\n\n(3) \"Age or developmentally appropriate\" means:\n\n(a) activities or items that are generally accepted as suitable for children of the same chronological age or level of maturity or that are determined to be developmentally appropriate for a child, based on the development of cognitive, emotional, physical, and behavioral capacities that are typical for an age or age group;\n\n(b) in the case of a specific child, activities or items that are suitable for the child based on the developmental stages attained by the child with respect to the cognitive, emotional, physical, and behavioral capacities of the child; and\n\n(c) activities that include, but are not be limited to, the following:\n\n(i) sports;\n\n(ii) field trips;\n\n(iii) extracurricular activities;\n\n(iv) social activities;\n\n(v) after school programs or functions;\n\n(vi) vacations with caregiver lasting up to two weeks;\n\n(vii) overnight activities away from caregiver lasting up to one week;\n\n(viii) employment opportunities; and\n\n(ix) in-state or out-of-state travel, excluding overseas travel;\n\n(d) activities that do not conflict with any pending matters before the court, an existing court order, or the child's scheduled appointments for evaluations or treatment.\n\n(4) \"Caregiver\" means a foster parent, kinship foster parent, or employee of a group home who is designated to make decisions regarding age or developmentally appropriate activities or experiences on behalf of a child in the custody of the department.\n\n(5) \"Child\" means a person under the age of eighteen.\n\n(6) \"Child abuse or neglect\" or \"harm\" occurs when:\n\n(a) the parent, guardian, or other person responsible for the child's welfare:\n\n(i) inflicts or allows to be inflicted upon the child physical or mental injury or engages in acts or omissions which present a substantial risk of physical or mental injury to the child, including injuries sustained as a result of excessive corporal punishment, but excluding corporal punishment or physical discipline which:\n\n(A) is administered by a parent or person in loco parentis;\n\n(B) is perpetrated for the sole purpose of restraining or correcting the child;\n\n(C) is reasonable in manner and moderate in degree;\n\n(D) has not brought about permanent or lasting damage to the child; and\n\n(E) is not reckless or grossly negligent behavior by the parents;\n\n(ii) commits or allows to be committed against the child a sexual offense as defined by the laws of this State or engages in acts or omissions that present a substantial risk that a sexual offense as defined in the laws of this State would be committed against the child;\n\n(iii) fails to supply the child with adequate food, clothing, shelter, or education as required under Article 1 of Chapter 65 of Title 59, supervision appropriate to the child's age and development, or health care though financially able to do so or offered financial or other reasonable means to do so and the failure to do so has caused or presents a substantial risk of causing physical or mental injury. However, a child's absences from school may not be considered abuse or neglect unless the school has made efforts to bring about the child's attendance, and those efforts were unsuccessful because of the parents' refusal to cooperate. For the purpose of this chapter \"adequate health care\" includes any medical or nonmedical remedial health care permitted or authorized under state law;\n\n(iv) abandons the child;\n\n(v) encourages, condones, or approves the commission of delinquent acts by the child including, but not limited to, sexual trafficking or exploitation, and the commission of the acts are shown to be the result of the encouragement, condonation, or approval;\n\n(vi) commits or allows to be committed against the child female genital mutilation as defined in Section 16-3-2210 or engages in acts or omissions that present a substantial risk that the crime of female genital mutilation would be committed against the child; or\n\n(vii) has committed abuse or neglect as described in subsubitems (i) through (vi) such that a child who subsequently becomes part of the person's household is at substantial risk of one of those forms of abuse or neglect; or\n\n(b) a child is a victim of trafficking in persons as defined in Section 16-3-2010, including sex trafficking, regardless of whether the perpetrator is a parent, guardian, or other person responsible for the child's welfare. Identifying a child as a victim of trafficking in persons does not create a presumption that the parent, guardian, or other individual responsible for the child's welfare abused, neglected, or harmed the child.\n\n(7) \"Childcare institution\" means a private childcare institution, or a public childcare institution which accommodates no more than twenty-five children, that is licensed by the department. \"Childcare institution\" does not include wilderness camps or training schools, nor does it include any facility that exists primarily for the detention or correction of children.\n\n(8) \"Child protective investigation\" means an inquiry conducted by the department in response to a report of child abuse or neglect made pursuant to this chapter.\n\n(9) \"Child protective services\" means assistance provided by the department as a result of indicated reports or affirmative determinations of child abuse or neglect, including assistance ordered by the family court or consented to by the family. The objectives of child protective services are to:\n\n(a) protect the child's safety and welfare; and\n\n(b) maintain the child within the family unless the safety of the child requires placement outside the home.\n\n(10) \"Court\" means the family court.\n\n(11) \"Department\" means the Department of Social Services.\n\n(12)(a) \"Emergency protective custody\" means the right to physical custody of a child for a temporary period of no more than twenty-four hours to protect the child from imminent danger.\n\n(b) Emergency protective custody may be taken only by a law enforcement officer pursuant to this chapter.\n\n(13) \"Legal Guardianship\" means:\n\n(a) a judicially established relationship between a child and caretaker that is intended to be permanent and self-sustaining and transfers to the caretaker the following parental rights and responsibilities with respect to the child:\n\n(i) the duty to provide protection, support, food, clothing, shelter, supervision, education, and care;\n\n(ii) physical custody of the child;\n\n(iii) legal custody when family court has not awarded legal custody to another person, agency, or institution;\n\n(iv) the right to consent to marriage, enlistment in the armed forces, and medical and surgical treatment;\n\n(v) the duty and authority to represent the child in legal actions and to make decisions of substantial legal significance affecting the child;\n\n(vi) the right to determine the nature and extent of the child's contact with other persons; and\n\n(vii) the right to manage the child's income and assets.\n\n(b) Unless the court so orders, legal guardianship does not terminate the parent-child relationship, including the right of the child to inherit from his parent, the parent's right to consent to the child's adoption, and the parent's obligation to provide financial, medical, or other support for the child as the court may order.\n\n(14) \"Indicated report\" means a report of child abuse or neglect supported by facts which warrant a finding by a preponderance of evidence that abuse or neglect is more likely than not to have occurred.\n\n(15) \"Institutional child abuse and neglect\" means situations of known or suspected child abuse or neglect where the person responsible for the child's welfare is the employee of a public or private residential home, institution, or agency.\n\n(16) \"Legal custody\" means the right to the physical custody, care, and control of a child; the right to determine where the child shall live; the right and duty to provide protection, food, clothing, shelter, ordinary medical care, education, supervision, and discipline for a child and in an emergency to authorize surgery or other extraordinary care. The court may in its order place other rights and duties with the legal custodian. Unless otherwise provided by court order, the parent or guardian retains the right to make decisions of substantial legal significance affecting the child, including consent to a marriage, enlistment in the armed forces, and major nonemergency medical and surgical treatment, the obligation to provide financial support or other funds for the care of the child, and other residual rights or obligations as may be provided by order of the court.\n\n(17) \"Mental injury\" means an injury to the intellectual, emotional, or psychological capacity or functioning of a child as evidenced by a discernible and substantial impairment of the child's ability to function when the existence of that impairment is supported by the opinion of a mental health professional or medical professional.\n\n(18) \"Party in interest\" includes the child, the child's attorney and guardian ad litem, the natural parent, an individual with physical or legal custody of the child, the foster parent, and the local foster care review board.\n\n(19) \"Person responsible for a child's welfare\" includes the child's parent, guardian, foster parent, an operator, employee, or caregiver, as defined by Section 63-13-20, of a public or private residential home, institution, agency, or childcare facility or an adult who has assumed the role or responsibility of a parent or guardian for the child, but who does not necessarily have legal custody of the child. A person whose only role is as a caregiver and whose contact is only incidental with a child, such as a babysitter or a person who has only incidental contact but may not be a caretaker, has not assumed the role or responsibility of a parent or guardian. An investigation pursuant to Section 63-7-920 must be initiated when the information contained in a report otherwise sufficient under this section does not establish whether the person has assumed the role or responsibility of a parent or guardian for the child.\n\n(20) \"Physical custody\" means the lawful, actual possession and control of a child.\n\n(21) \"Physical injury\" means death or permanent or temporary disfigurement or impairment of any bodily organ or function.\n\n(22) \"Preponderance of evidence\" means evidence which, when fairly considered, is more convincing as to its truth than the evidence in opposition.\n\n(23) \"Probable cause\" means facts and circumstances based upon accurate and reliable information, including hearsay, that would justify a reasonable person to believe that a child subject to a report under this chapter is abused or neglected.\n\n(24) \"Protective services unit\" means the unit established within the Department of Social Services which has prime responsibility for state efforts to strengthen and improve the prevention, identification, and treatment of child abuse and neglect.\n\n(25) \"Qualified individual\" means a trained professional or licensed clinician.

For the purposes of this chapter, it is presumed that all reports are unfounded unless the department determines otherwise.\n\n(31) \"Near fatality\" means an act of abuse or neglect that, as certified by a physician, places a child in serious or critical condition.\n\n(32) \"Legal Guardian\" means a person appointed by the court through the judicial establishment of a legal guardianship to become the caretaker of a child.\n\nHISTORY: 2008 Act No. 361, Section 2; 2016 Act No. 238 (H.4546), Section 1, eff June 5, 2016; 2018 Act No. 146 (H.3701), Section 7, eff April 4, 2018; 2019 Act No. 71 (H.3973), Section 2, eff May 16, 2019; 2021 Act No. 24 (H.3567), Section 1, eff April 26, 2021; 2022 Act No. 224 (S.243), Section 3, eff June 17, 2022; 2023 Act No. 25 (S.380), Section 1, eff May 16, 2023; 2023 Act No. 25 (S.380), Section 2, eff May 16, 2023.\n\nEffect of Amendment\n\n2016 Act No. 238, Section 1, added (3), (4), and (24), definitions for \"age or developmentally appropriate\", \"caregiver\", and \"reasonable and prudent parent standard\"; redesignated the paragraph designators accordingly; and in (6)(e), inserted \"including, but not limited to, sexual trafficking or exploitation,\".\n\n2018 Act No. 146, Section 7, in (6), inserted a semicolon and the (a) designator following \"occurs when\" in the introductory paragraph, redesignated (a) to (f) as (i) to (vi) and (i) to (v) as (A) to (E), added (b), and made nonsubstantive changes.\n\n2019 Act No. 71, Section 2, in (6)(a), in (v), made a nonsubstantive change, inserted (vi), adding female genital mutilation of a minor to the definition of \"Child abuse or neglect\" or \"harm\"; and redesignated former (vi) as (vii).\n\n2021 Act No. 24, Section 1, inserted (7), relating to the definition of \"childcare institution\" and redesignated former (7) to (23) as (8) to (24); and inserted (25) and (26), relating to the definitions of \"qualified individual\" and \"qualified residential treatment program\", respectively, and redesignated former (24) to (27) as (27) to (30).\n\n2022 Act No. 224, Section 3, added (31), relating to the definition of \"near fatality\".\n\n2023 Act No. 25, Section 1, in (12), inserted the (a) and (b) designators; and rewrote (13).\n\n2023 Act No. 25, Section 2, added (32), relating to the definition of \"Legal Guardian\".\n\nSECTION 63-7-25.

Safe haven for abandoned babies.\n\n(A) A safe haven in this State must, without a court order, take temporary physical custody of an infant who is voluntarily left with the safe haven by a person who does not express an intent to return for the infant and the circumstances give rise to a reasonable belief that the person does not intend to return for the infant. If the safe haven is a hospital or hospital outpatient facility, the hospital or hospital facility shall perform any act necessary to protect the physical health or safety of the infant; any other safe haven shall, as soon as possible, but no later than six hours after receiving an infant, transport the infant to a hospital or hospital outpatient facility. The person leaving the infant is not required to disclose his or her identity; however, the person must leave the infant in the physical custody of a staff member or employee of the safe haven.\n\n(B)(1) A facility, agency, or other location designated as a safe haven pursuant to subsection (J)(2) must post a notice prepared by the department on its premises that is prominently displayed for view by the public, stating that the facility, agency, or other location is a safe haven at which a person may leave an infant.\n\n(2) The safe haven must offer the person leaving the infant information concerning the legal effect of leaving the infant with the safe haven.\n\n(3) The safe haven must ask the person leaving the infant to identify any parent of the infant other than the person leaving the infant with the safe haven. The safe haven also must attempt to obtain from the person information concerning the infant's background and medical history as specified on a form provided by the department. This information must include, but is not limited to, information concerning the use of a controlled substance by the infant's mother, provided that information regarding the use of a controlled substance by the infant's mother is not admissible as evidence of the unlawful use of a controlled substance in any court proceeding. The safe haven must give the person a copy of the form and a prepaid envelope for mailing the form to the department if the person does not wish to provide the information to the safe haven. The department must provide these materials to safe havens.\n\n(4) Identifying information disclosed by the person leaving the infant must be kept confidential by the safe haven and disclosed to no one other than the department. However, if a court determines that the immunity provisions of subsection (H) do not apply, the safe haven may disclose the information as permitted by confidentiality protections applicable to records of the safe haven, if the safe haven has such confidentiality protections for records. The department must maintain confidentiality of this information in accordance with Section 63-7-1990.\n\n(C) Not later than the close of the first business day after the date on which a hospital or hospital outpatient facility takes possession of an infant pursuant to subsection (A), the hospital or hospital outpatient facility shall notify the department that it has taken temporary physical custody of the infant. The department has legal custody of the infant immediately upon receipt of the notice. The department shall assume physical control of the infant as soon as practicable upon receipt of the notice, but no later than twenty-four hours after receiving notice that the infant is ready for discharge from the hospital or hospital outpatient facility. Assumption of custody by the department pursuant to this subsection does not constitute emergency protective custody, and the provisions of Subarticle 3 of Article 3 do not apply. The department is not required to initiate a child protective services investigation solely because an infant comes into its custody under this subsection.\n\n(D) Immediately after receiving notice from a hospital or hospital outpatient facility pursuant to subsection (C), the department shall contact the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division for assistance in assuring that the infant is not a missing infant. The South Carolina Law Enforcement Division shall treat the request as ongoing for a period of thirty days and shall contact the department if a missing infant report is received that might relate to the infant.\n\n(E)(1) Within forty-eight hours after taking legal custody of the infant, the department shall publish notice, in a newspaper of general circulation in the area where the safe haven that initially took the infant is located, and send a news release to broadcast and print media in the area. The notice and the news release must state the circumstances under which the infant was left at the safe haven, a description of the infant, and the date, time, and place of the permanency planning and termination of parental rights hearing provided for in subsection (E)(2). The notice and the news release must also state that any person wishing to assert parental rights in regard to the infant must do so at the hearing. If the person leaving the infant identified anyone as being a parent of the infant, the notice must be sent by certified mail to the last known address of the person identified as a parent at least two weeks prior to the hearing.\n\n(2) Within forty-eight hours after obtaining legal custody of the infant, the department shall file a petition for permanency planning alleging that the infant has been abandoned, that the court should dispense with reasonable efforts to preserve or reunify the family, that continuation of keeping the infant in the home of the parent or parents would be contrary to the welfare of the infant, and that termination of parental rights is in the best interest of the infant. The department shall file concurrently with the petition for permanency planning a petition for termination of parental rights pursuant to Section 63-7-2570 based on abandonment and any other applicable grounds. A hearing on both petitions must be held no earlier than thirty and no later than sixty days after the department takes legal custody of the infant. Unless a person wishing to assert parental rights does so at the hearing, this hearing shall serve as the permanency planning hearing and the termination of parental rights hearing for the infant. If the court approves the permanent plan of termination of parental rights and issues an order terminating parental rights to the infant, the order must also provide that the department shall, within thirty days of the close of the hearing, submit a plan to the court and to the infant's guardian ad litem for permanent placement of the infant and otherwise comply with the requirements of Section 63-7-2580(A). If a person asserts parental rights to the infant at the hearing, and the court approves a permanent plan of termination of parental rights and adoption, the court shall schedule a hearing on the petition to terminate parental rights no later than thirty days after the close of the permanency planning hearing.\n\n(F) In any judicial proceeding in which the abuse or neglect of an infant is an issue, the act of voluntarily leaving an infant with a safe haven pursuant to this section is conclusive evidence that the infant has been abused or neglected for purposes of Department of Social Services' jurisdiction and for evidentiary purposes. The act of voluntarily leaving an infant with a safe haven pursuant to this section is also conclusive evidence that the requirements for termination of parental rights have been satisfied as to any parent who left the infant or acted in concert with the person leaving the infant.\n\n(G) A person who leaves an infant at a safe haven or directs another person to do so must not be prosecuted for any criminal offense on account of such action if:\n\n(1) the person is a parent of the infant or is acting at the direction of a parent;\n\n(2) the person leaves the infant in the physical custody of a staff member or an employee of the safe haven; and\n\n(3) the infant is not more than sixty days old or the infant is reasonably determined by the hospital or hospital outpatient facility to be not more than sixty days old.\n\nThis subsection does not apply to prosecution for the infliction of any harm upon the infant other than the harm inherent in abandonment.\n\n(H) A safe haven and its agents, and any health care professionals practicing within a hospital or hospital outpatient facility, are immune from civil or criminal liability for any action authorized by this section, so long as the safe haven, or health care professional, complies with all provisions of this section.\n\n(I) The department, either alone or in collaboration with any other public entity, shall take appropriate measures to achieve public awareness of the provisions of this section.\n\n(J) For purposes of this section:\n\n(1) \"infant\" means a person not more than sixty days old; and\n\n(2) \"safe haven\" means a hospital or hospital outpatient facility, a law enforcement agency, a fire station, an emergency medical services station, or any staffed house of worship during hours when the facility is staffed.\n\n(K) Annually the department shall submit a report to the General Assembly containing data on infants who come into the custody of the department pursuant to this section. The data must include, but are not limited to, the date, time, and place where the infant was left, the hospital to which the infant was taken, the health of the infant at the time of being admitted to the hospital, disposition and placement of the infant, and, if available, circumstances surrounding the infant being left at the safe haven.

Emergency protective custody.\n\n(A) A law enforcement officer may take emergency protective custody of a child without the consent of the child's parents, guardians, or others exercising temporary or permanent control over the child if:\n\n(1) the officer has probable cause to believe that by reason of abuse or neglect the child's life, health, or physical safety is in substantial and imminent danger if the child is not taken into emergency protective custody, and there is not time to apply for a court order pursuant to Section 63-7-1660. When a child is taken into emergency protective custody following an incident of excessive corporal punishment, and the only injury to the child is external lesions or minor bruises, other children in the home shall not be taken into emergency protective custody solely on account of the injury of one child through excessive corporal punishment. However, the officer may take emergency protective custody of other children in the home if a threat of harm to them is further indicated by factors including, but not limited to, a prior history of domestic violence or other abuse in the home, alcohol or drug abuse if known or evident at the time of the initial contact, or other circumstances indicative of danger to the children;\n\n(2) the child's parent, parents, or guardian has been arrested or the child has become lost accidentally and as a result the child's welfare is threatened due to loss of adult protection and supervision; and\n\n(a) in the circumstances of arrest, the parent, parents, or guardian does not consent in writing to another person assuming physical custody of the child;\n\n(b) in the circumstances of a lost child, a search by law enforcement has not located the parent, parents, or guardian.\n\n(B)(1) If the child is in need of emergency medical care at the time the child is taken into emergency protective custody, the officer shall transport the child to an appropriate health care facility. Emergency medical care may be provided to the child without consent, as provided in Section 63-5-350. The parent or guardian is responsible for the cost of emergency medical care that is provided to the child. However, the parent or guardian is not responsible for the cost of medical examinations performed at the request of law enforcement or the department solely for the purpose of assessing whether the child has been abused or neglected unless it is determined that the child has been harmed as defined in this chapter.\n\n(2) If the child is not in need of emergency medical care, the officer or the department shall transport the child to a place agreed upon by the department and law enforcement, and the department within two hours shall assume physical control of the child and shall place the child in a licensed foster home or shelter within a reasonable period of time. In no case may the child be placed in a jail or other secure facility or a facility for the detention of criminal or juvenile offenders. While the child is in its custody, the department shall provide for the needs of the child and assure that a child of school age who is physically able to do so continues attending school.\n\nHISTORY: 2008 Act No. 361, Section 2.\n\nSECTION 63-7-630.

The department shall notify the parent, guardian, or other person exercising temporary or permanent control over the child as early as reasonably possible of the location of the child unless there are compelling reasons for believing that disclosure of this information would be contrary to the best interests of the child.\n\nHISTORY: 2008 Act No. 361, Section 2.\n\nSECTION 63-7-640. Preliminary investigation.\n\nThe department shall conduct within twenty-four hours after the child is taken into emergency protective custody by law enforcement or pursuant to ex parte order a preliminary investigation to determine whether grounds for assuming legal custody of the child exist and whether reasonable means exist for avoiding removal of the child from the home of the parent or guardian or for placement of the child with a relative and means for minimizing the emotional impact on the child of separation from the child's home and family. During this time the department, if possible, shall convene, a meeting with the child's parents or guardian, extended family, and other relevant persons to discuss the family's problems that led to intervention and possible corrective actions, including placement of the child.\n\nHISTORY: 2008 Act No. 361, Section 2.\n\nSECTION 63-7-650. Risk assessment before placement; opportunity to be licensed as kinship foster parent.\n\n(A) Before agreeing to or acquiescing in a corrective action that involves placement of the child with a relative or other person or making an interim placement with a relative while retaining custody of the child or as soon as possible after agreeing to or acquiescing in a corrective action, the department shall secure from the relative or other person and other adults in the home an affidavit attesting to information necessary to determine whether a criminal history or history of child abuse or neglect exists and whether this history indicates there is a significant risk that the child would be threatened with abuse or neglect in the home of the relative or other person. As soon as possible, the department shall confirm the information supplied in the affidavit by checking the Central Registry of Child Abuse and Neglect, other relevant department records, county sex offender registries, and records for the preceding five years of law enforcement agencies in the jurisdiction in which the relative or other person resides and, to the extent reasonably possible, jurisdictions in which the relative or other person has resided during that period. The department must not agree to or acquiesce in a placement if the affidavit or these records reveal information indicating there is a significant risk that the child would be threatened with abuse or neglect in the home of the relative or other person. The relative or other person must consent to a check of the above records by the department.\n\n(B) Before making an interim placement of a child with a relative pursuant to this section, the department shall inform the relative about the opportunity to become licensed as a foster parent if the department later determines it is not safe for the child to be returned to the home and the department initiates a removal action pursuant to Section 63-7-1660. The department shall provide the relative general information about the kinship foster parent licensing process and the benefits of licensure, including eligibility for financial assistance and supportive services, and the risk that the relative may be ineligible for that assistance and services if the relative is not licensed as a foster parent.\n\nHISTORY: 2008 Act No. 361, Section 2; 2018 Act No. 146 (H.3701), Section 2, eff April 4, 2018.\n\nEffect of Amendment\n\n2018 Act No. 146, Section 2, inserted the (A) designator, and added (B), requiring the department to explain to a relative about the opportunity to become licensed as a kinship foster parent before making an interim placement of a child.\n\nSECTION 63-7-660. Assumption of legal custody.\n\nIf the department determines after the preliminary investigation that there is probable cause to believe that by reason of abuse or neglect the child's life, health, or physical safety is in imminent and substantial danger, the department may assume legal custody of the child without the consent of the child's parent, guardian, or custodian. The department shall make every reasonable effort to notify the child's parent, guardian, or custodian of the location of the child and shall make arrangements for temporary visitation unless there are compelling reasons why visitation or notice of the location of the child would be contrary to the best interests of the child. The notification must be in writing and shall include notice of the right to a hearing and right to counsel pursuant to this article. Nothing in this section authorizes the department to physically remove a child from the care of the child's parent or guardian without an order of the court. The department may exercise the authority to assume legal custody only after a law enforcement officer has taken emergency protective custody of the child or the family court has granted emergency protective custody by ex parte order, and the department has conducted a preliminary investigation pursuant to Section 63-7-640.\n\nHISTORY: 2008 Act No. 361, Section 2.\n\nSECTION 63-7-670. Returning child to parents; alternative procedures.\n\nIf emergency protective custody of the child was taken by a law enforcement officer pursuant to this subarticle, and the department concludes after the preliminary investigation that the child should be returned to the child's parent, guardian, or custodian, the department shall consult with the law enforcement officer who took emergency protective custody unless the department and the law enforcement agency have agreed to an alternative procedure. If the officer objects to the return of the child, the department must assume legal custody of the child until a probable cause hearing can be held. The alternative procedure agreed to by the department and the law enforcement agency may provide that the child must be retained in custody if the officer cannot be contacted, conditions under which the child may be returned home if the officer cannot be contacted, other persons within the law enforcement agency who are to be consulted instead of the officer, or other procedures. If no alternative procedure has been agreed to and the department is unable to contact the law enforcement officer after reasonable efforts to do so, the department shall consult with the officer's designee or the officer's agency.\n\nHISTORY: 2008 Act No. 361, Section 2.\n\nSECTION 63-7-680. Emergency protective custody extension.\n\nThe period of emergency protective custody may be extended for up to twenty-four additional hours if:\n\n(1) the department concludes that the child is to be placed with a relative or other person instead of taking legal custody of the child;\n\n(2) the department requests the appropriate law enforcement agency to check for records concerning the relative or other person, or any adults in that person's home; and\n\n(3) the law enforcement agency notifies the department that the extension is needed to enable the law enforcement agency to complete its record check before the department's decision on whether to take legal custody of the child.\n\nHISTORY: 2008 Act No. 361, Section 2.\n\nSECTION 63-7-690. Relative placement.\n\n(A) If within the twenty-four hours following removal of the child:\n\n(1) the department has identified a specified relative or other person with whom it has determined that the child is to be placed instead of the department's taking legal custody of the child; and\n\n(2) both the relative or other person with whom the child is to be placed and the child's parent or guardian have agreed to the placement, the department may retain physical custody of the child for no more than five additional days if necessary to enable the relative or other person to make travel or other arrangements incident to the placement.\n\n(B) A probable cause hearing pursuant to Section 63-7-710 shall not be held unless the placement fails to occur as planned within the five-day period or the child's parent or guardian makes a written request for a hearing to the department. The department must give the child's parent or guardian written notice of the right to request a probable cause hearing to obtain a judicial determination of whether removal of the child from the home was and remains necessary. Upon receipt of a written request for a hearing from the child's parent or guardian, the department shall schedule a hearing for the next date on which the family court is scheduled to hear probable cause hearings.\n\n(C) If the placement does not occur as planned within the five-day period, the department immediately must determine whether to assume legal custody of the child and file a petition as provided in Section 63-7-700(B). The department shall assure that the child is given age-appropriate information about the plans for placement and any subsequent changes in those plans at the earliest feasible time.\n\nHISTORY: 2008 Act No. 361, Section 2.\n\nSECTION 63-7-700. Emergency protective custody proceedings.\n\n(A) If a law enforcement officer clearly states to the department at the time the officer delivers physical control of the child to the department that the child is not to be returned to the home or placed with a relative before a probable cause hearing regardless of the outcome of a preliminary investigation, the department immediately must take legal custody of the child. In this case, at a minimum, the department shall conduct a preliminary investigation as provided in Section 63-7-640 within seventy-two hours after the child was taken into emergency protective custody and shall make recommendations concerning return of the child to the home or placement with a relative or other person to the family court at the probable cause hearing or take other appropriate action as provided in this chapter.\n\n(B)(1) The department, upon assuming legal custody of the child, shall begin a child protective investigation, including immediate attention to the protection of other children in the home, or other setting where the child was found. The department shall initiate a removal proceeding in the appropriate family court pursuant to Section 63-7-1660 on or before the next working day after initiating the investigation. If a noncustodial parent is not named as a party, the department shall exercise every reasonable effort to promptly notify the noncustodial parent that a removal proceeding has been initiated and of the date and time of any hearings scheduled pursuant to this subarticle.\n\n(2) Upon a determination by the department before the probable cause hearing that there is not a preponderance of evidence that child abuse or neglect occurred, the department may place physical custody of the child with the parent, parents, guardian, immediate family member, or relative, with the department retaining legal custody pending the probable cause hearing.\n\n(3) When the facts and circumstances of the report clearly indicate that no abuse or neglect occurred, the report promptly must be determined to be unfounded, and the department shall exercise reasonable efforts to expedite the placement of the child with the parent, parents, guardian, immediate family member, or relative.\n\n(C) If the child is returned to the child's parent, guardian, or custodian following the preliminary investigation, a probable cause hearing must be held if requested by the child's parent, guardian, or custodian or the department or the law enforcement agency that took emergency protective custody of the child. The request must be made in writing to the court within ten days after the child is returned. A probable cause hearing pursuant to Section 63-7-710 must be scheduled within seven days of the request to determine whether there was probable cause to take emergency physical custody of the child.\n\nHISTORY: 2008 Act No. 361, Section 2.\n\nSECTION 63-7-710. Probable cause hearing.\n\n(A) The family court shall schedule a probable cause hearing to be held within seventy-two hours of the time the child was taken into emergency protective custody. If the third day falls upon a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday, the probable cause hearing must be held no later than the next working day. If there is no term of court in the county when the probable cause hearing must be held, the hearing must be held in another county in the circuit. If there is no term of family court in another county in the circuit, the probable cause hearing may be heard in another court in an adjoining circuit.\n\n(B) The probable cause hearing may be conducted by video conference at the discretion of the judge.\n\n(C) At the probable cause hearing, the family court shall undertake to fulfill the requirements of Section 63-7-1620 and shall determine whether there was probable cause for taking emergency protective custody and for the department to assume legal custody of the child and shall determine whether probable cause to retain legal custody of the child remains at the time of the hearing.\n\n(D) At the probable cause hearing, the respondents may submit affidavits as to facts which are alleged to form the basis of the removal and to cross-examine the department's witnesses as to whether there existed probable cause to effect emergency removal.\n\n(E) The hearing on the merits to determine whether removal of custody is needed, pursuant to Section 63-7-1660, must be held within thirty-five days of the date of receipt of the removal petition. At the probable cause hearing, the court shall set the time and date for the hearing on the merits. A party may request a continuance that would result in the hearing being held more than thirty-five days after the petition was filed, and the court may grant the request for continuance only if exceptional circumstances exist. If a continuance is granted, the hearing on the merits must be completed within sixty-five days following receipt of the removal petition. The court may continue the hearing on the merits beyond sixty-five days without returning the child to the home only if the court issues a written order with findings of fact supporting a determination that the following conditions are satisfied, regardless of whether the parties have agreed to a continuance:\n\n(1) the court finds that the child should remain in the custody of the department because there is probable cause to believe that returning the child to the home would seriously endanger the child's physical safety or emotional well-being;\n\n(2) the court schedules the case for trial on a date and time certain which is not more than thirty days after the date the hearing was scheduled to be held; and\n\n(3) the court finds that exceptional circumstances support the continuance or the parties and the guardian ad litem agree to a continuance.\n\n(F) The court may continue the case past the date and time certain set forth in subsection (E) only if the court issues a new order as required in subsection (E).\n\n(G) The court may continue the case because a witness is unavailable only if the court enters a finding of fact that the court cannot decide the case without the testimony of the witness. The court shall consider and rule on whether the hearing can begin and then recess to have the witness' testimony taken at a later date or by deposition. The court shall rule on whether the party offering the witness has exercised due diligence to secure the presence of the witness or to preserve the witness' testimony.\n\n(H) This section does not prevent the court from conducting a pendente lite hearing on motion of any party and issuing an order granting other appropriate relief pending a hearing on the merits.\n\n(I) If the child is returned to the home pending the merits hearing, the court may impose such terms and conditions as it determines appropriate to protect the child from harm, including measures to protect the child as a witness.\n\n(J) When a continuance is granted pursuant to this section, the family court shall ensure that the hearing is rescheduled within the time limits provided in this section and give the hearing priority over other matters pending before the court except a probable cause hearing held pursuant to this section, a detention hearing held pursuant to Section 63-19-830, or a hearing held pursuant to Section 63-19-1030 or 63-19-1210 concerning a child who is in state custody pursuant to Chapter 19. An exception also may be made for child custody hearings if the court, in its discretion, makes a written finding stating compelling reasons, relating to the welfare of the child, for giving priority to the custody hearing.\n\nHISTORY: 2008 Act No. 361, Section 2.\n\nSECTION 63-7-720. Reasonable efforts to prevent removal.\n\n(A) An order issued as a result of the probable cause hearing held pursuant to Section 63-7-710 concerning a child of whom the department has assumed legal custody shall contain a finding by the court of whether reasonable efforts were made by the department to prevent removal of the child and a finding of whether continuation of the child in the home would be contrary to the welfare of the child. The order shall state:\n\n(1) the services made available to the family before the department assumed legal custody of the child and how they related to the needs of the family;\n\n(2) the efforts of the department to provide services to the family before assuming legal custody of the child;\n\n(3) why the efforts to provide services did not eliminate the need for the department to assume legal custody;\n\n(4) whether a meeting was convened as provided in Section 63-7-640, the persons present, and the outcome of the meeting or, if no meeting was held, the reason for not holding a meeting;\n\n(5) what efforts were made to place the child with a relative known to the child or in another familiar environment;\n\n(6) whether the efforts to eliminate the need for the department to assume legal custody were reasonable including, but not limited to, whether services were reasonably available and timely, reasonably adequate to address the needs of the family, reasonably adequate to protect the child and realistic under the circumstances, and whether efforts to place the child in a familiar environment were reasonable.\n\n(B) Reasonable efforts required pursuant to subsection (A) to prevent removal of the child from a parent or legal guardian who has a disability must include efforts that are individualized and based upon a parent's or legal guardian's specific disability, including referrals for access to adaptive parenting equipment, referrals for instruction on adaptive parenting techniques, and reasonable accommodations with regard to accessing services that are otherwise made available to a parent or legal guardian who does not have a disability.\n\n(C) If the court finds that reasonable services would not have allowed the child to remain safely in the home, the court shall find that removal of the child without services or without further services was reasonable.\n\nHISTORY: 2008 Act No. 361, Section 2; 2017 Act No. 36 (H.3538), Section 3, eff May 10, 2017.\n\nEffect of Amendment\n\n2017 Act No. 36, Section 3, inserted (B), relating to reasonable efforts requirements for probable cause hearings and requiring certain efforts if a parent or legal guardian has a disability, and redesignated accordingly.\n\nSECTION 63-7-730. Expedited placement of child with relative.\n\n(A) If the court finds at the probable cause hearing that the department made reasonable efforts to prevent removal of the child and that continuation of the child in the home would be contrary to the welfare of the child, the court may order expedited placement of the child with a grandparent or other relative of the first or second degree. In making this expedited placement decision, the court shall consider the totality of the circumstances including, but not limited to, the individual's suitability, fitness, and willingness to serve as a placement for the child. A parent who complies with these requirements must be the first relative considered by the court for expedited placement. The court shall require the department to check the names of all adults in the home against the Central Registry of Child Abuse and Neglect, other relevant records of the department, county sex abuse registers, and records for the preceding five years of law enforcement agencies in the jurisdiction in which the person resides and, to the extent reasonably possible, jurisdictions in which the person has resided during that period. The court may hold open the record of the probable cause hearing for up to twenty-four hours to receive these reports. Nothing in this section precludes the department from requesting or the court from ordering pursuant to the department's request either a full study of the individual's home before placement or the licensing or approval of the individual's home before placement.\n\n(B) If the court orders expedited placement of the child with a grandparent or other relative of the first or second degree, the individual may be added as a party to the action for the duration of the case or until further order of the court.\n\nHISTORY: 2008 Act No. 361, Section 2; 2013 Act No. 58, Section 1, eff June 12, 2013.\n\nEffect of Amendment\n\nThe 2013 amendment rewrote the section.\n\nSECTION 63-7-735. Right to become a licensed kinship foster parent.\n\n(A) Before the department places a child with a relative who is not licensed as a foster parent, the department shall inform the relative of the procedures for licensure as a foster parent, the benefits of licensure as a foster parent, including eligibility for financial assistance and supportive services, and the risk that the relative may be ineligible for that assistance and services if the relative is not licensed as a foster parent.\n\n(B) An order issued as a result of a hearing in which the court approves placement of a child with a relative who is not licensed as a foster parent must contain a finding by the court whether the department informed the relative of the right to become licensed as a foster parent, the procedures for obtaining licensure, and the benefits of being licensed as a foster parent, including eligibility for financial assistance and supportive services.\n\n(C) If the court finds that the department complied with the requirements of this section and Sections 63-7-2320(C) and (E) and 63-7-2330, and the relative indicates to the court that the relative does not wish to pursue licensure as a foster parent, the court may approve the placement pursuant to this section.\n\nHISTORY: 2018 Act No. 146 (H.3701), Section 1, eff April 4, 2018.\n\nSECTION 63-7-740. Ex parte emergency protective custody.\n\n(A) The family court may order ex parte that a child be taken into emergency protective custody without the consent of parents, guardians, or others exercising temporary or permanent control over the child if:\n\n(1) the family court judge determines there is probable cause to believe that by reason of abuse or neglect there exists an imminent and substantial danger to the child's life, health, or physical safety; and\n\n(2) parents, guardians, or others exercising temporary or permanent control over the child are unavailable or do not consent to the child's removal from their custody.\n\n(B) If the court issues such an order, the department shall conduct a preliminary investigation and otherwise proceed as provided in this subarticle.\n\nHISTORY: 2008 Act No. 361, Section 2.\n\nSECTION 63-7-750. Doctor or hospital may detain child; civil immunity.\n\n(A) A physician or hospital to which a child has been brought for treatment may detain the child for up to twenty-four hours without the consent of the person responsible for the child's welfare if the physician or hospital:\n\n(1) has reason to believe that the child has been abused or neglected;\n\n(2) has made a report to a law enforcement agency and the department pursuant to Section 63-7-310, stating the time the physician notified the agency or department that the child was being detained until a law enforcement officer could arrive to determine whether the officer should take emergency physical custody of the child pursuant to Subarticle 3; and\n\n(3) has reason to believe that release of the child to the child's parent, guardian, custodian, or caretaker presents an imminent danger to the child's life, health, or physical safety. A hospital must designate a qualified person or persons within the hospital who shall have sole authority to detain a child on behalf of the hospital.\n\n(B) A physician or hospital that detains a child in good faith as provided in this section is immune from civil or criminal liability for detaining the child.\n\nHISTORY: 2008 Act No. 361, Section 2.\n\nSECTION 63-7-760. Protocols.\n\nThe department and local law enforcement agencies shall develop written protocols to address issues related to emergency protective custody.

The information that must be disclosed to the relative pursuant to this section includes, but is not limited to, medical and mental health conditions and history of the child, the nature of abuse or neglect to which the child has been subjected, behavioral strengths and challenges, and matters related to the child's educational needs. If the department does not have this information at the time of making the placement, a member of the child's casework team or the child's caseworker shall contact the relative and provide the information known to the casework team or reasonably accessible during the first working day following the placement. The child's caseworker shall research the child's record and shall supplement the information provided to the relative no later than the end of the first week of placement if additional information is found. When the child's caseworker acquires new information which is likely to affect either the ability of the relative to provide adequate care and supervision for the child or is likely to place the health and safety of the child or the relative's family at risk, the department shall disclose that information to the relative. The obligation to provide this information continues until the placement ends.\n\nHISTORY: 2018 Act No. 165 (H.3699), Section 1, eff May 3, 2018.\n\nSECTION 63-7-770.

Immediately upon transmitting the report the department shall destroy the contents of the suspected report. Upon receipt of a call involving other problems of a nature which may affect the stability of family life, the department shall refer the call to the appropriate county department office or other service agency where appropriate.\n\n(B) The department shall have within it a separate organizational unit administered within the department with qualified staff and resources sufficient to fulfill the purposes and functions assigned to it by this article.\n\n(C) The department's responsibilities shall include, but are not limited to:\n\n(1) assigning and monitoring initial child protection responsibility through periodic review of services offered throughout the State;\n\n(2) assisting in the diagnosis of child abuse and neglect;\n\n(3) coordinating referrals of known or suspected child abuse and neglect;\n\n(4) measuring the effectiveness of existing child protection programs and facilitating research, planning, and program development; and\n\n(5) establishing and monitoring a statewide Central Registry for Child Abuse and Neglect.\n\n(D) The department may contract for the delivery of protective services, family preservation services, foster care services, family reunification services, adoptions services, and other related services or programs.

Investigations and case determination.\n\n(A)(1) Within twenty-four hours of the receipt of a report of suspected child abuse or neglect, the department must begin an appropriate and thorough investigation to decide whether the report should be \"indicated\" or \"unfounded\" when the department concludes the report alleges that:\n\n(a) a child is at imminent and substantial risk of physical or mental injury due to abuse, neglect, or harm;\n\n(b) the family may flee or the child may be unavailable for purposes of conducting a child protective services investigation; or\n\n(c) the department has assumed legal custody of a child pursuant to Section 63-7-660 or 63-7-670 or the department has been notified that a child has been taken into emergency protective custody.\n\n(2) The department must begin an appropriate and thorough investigation of all reports of suspected child abuse or neglect that do not meet criteria established in subsection (A)(1) within two business days of receiving the report to determine whether the report should be \"indicated\" or \"unfounded\".\n\n(3) The finding must be made no later than forty-five days from the receipt of the report. A single extension of no more than fifteen days may be granted by the director of the department, or the director's designee, for good cause shown, pursuant to guidelines adopted by the department.\n\n(4) If the investigation cannot be completed because the department is unable to locate the child or family or for other compelling reasons, the report may be classified as unfounded Category III and the investigation may be reopened at a later date if the child or family is located or the compelling reason for failure to complete the investigation is removed. The department must make a finding within forty-five days after the investigation is reopened.\n\n(B) The department may file with the family court an affidavit and a petition to support issuance of a warrant at any time after receipt of a report. The family court must issue the warrant if the affidavit and petition establish probable cause to believe the child is an abused or neglected child and that the investigation cannot be completed without issuance of the warrant. The warrant may authorize the department to interview the child, to inspect the condition of the child, to inspect the premises where the child may be located or may reside, and to obtain copies of medical, school, or other records concerning the child.\n\n(C) The department or law enforcement, or both, may interview the child alleged to have been abused or neglected and any other child in the household during the investigation. The interviews may be conducted on school premises, at childcare facilities, at the child's home or at other suitable locations and in the discretion of the department or law enforcement, or both, may be conducted outside the presence of the parents. To the extent reasonably possible, the needs and interests of the child must be accommodated in making arrangements for interviews, including time, place, method of obtaining the child's presence, and conduct of the interview. The department or law enforcement, or both, shall provide notification of the interview to the parents as soon as reasonably possible during the investigation if notice will not jeopardize the safety of the child or the course of the investigation. All state, law enforcement, and community agencies providing child welfare intervention into a child's life should coordinate their services to minimize the number of interviews of the child to reduce potential emotional trauma to the child.\n\n(D) The department must furnish to parents or guardians on a standardized form the following information as soon as reasonably possible after commencing the investigation:\n\n(1) the names of the investigators;\n\n(2) the allegations being investigated;\n\n(3) whether the person's name has been recorded by the department as a suspected perpetrator of abuse or neglect;\n\n(4) the right to inspect department records concerning the investigation;\n\n(5) statutory and family court remedies available to complete the investigation and to protect the child if the parent or guardian or subject of the report indicates a refusal to cooperate;\n\n(6) how information provided by the parent or guardian may be used;\n\n(7) the possible outcomes of the investigation; and\n\n(8) the telephone number and name of a department employee available to answer questions.\n\n(E) This subarticle does not require the department to investigate reports of child abuse or neglect which resulted in the death of the child unless there are other children residing in the home, or a resident of the home is pregnant, or the subject of the report is the parent, guardian, or person responsible for the welfare of another child regardless of whether that child resides in the home.\n\n(F) The department or law enforcement, or both, may collect information concerning the military affiliation of the person having custody or control of the child subject to an investigation and may share this information with the appropriate military authorities pursuant to Section 63-11-80.\n\nHISTORY: 2008 Act No. 361, Section 2; 2015 Act No. 62 (H.3548), Section 2, eff June 4, 2015; 2023 Act No. 33 (S.612), Section 2, eff May 16, 2023.\n\nEffect of Amendment\n\n2015 Act No. 62, Section 2, added (F).\n\n2023 Act No. 33, Section 2, rewrote (A).\n\nSECTION 63-7-930. Classification categories.\n\n(A) Reports of child abuse and neglect must be classified in the department's data system and records in one of three categories: Suspected, Unfounded, or Indicated. If the report is categorized as unfounded, the entry must further state the classification of unfounded reports as set forth in subsection (C). All initial reports must be considered suspected. Reports must be maintained in the category of suspected for no more than sixty days after the report was received by the department. By the end of the sixty-day time period, suspected reports must be classified as either unfounded or indicated pursuant to the agency's investigation.\n\n(B)(1) Indicated findings must be based upon a finding of the facts available to the department that there is a preponderance of evidence that the child is an abused or neglected child. Indicated findings must include a description of the services being provided the child and those responsible for the child's welfare and all relevant dispositional information.\n\n(2) If the family court makes a determination or the process described in Subarticle 9 results in a determination that the indicated finding is not supported by a preponderance of evidence that there was any act of child abuse or neglect, the case classification must be converted to unfounded and Section 63-7-940 applies.\n\n(3) If the family court makes a specific determination, or the process described in Subarticle 9 results in a determination that there is not a preponderance of evidence that the person who was the subject of the report committed an act of child abuse or neglect, but that the child was abused or neglected by an unknown person, the department must maintain the case as an indicated case and access to records of the case may be granted as provided in Section 63-7-1990.
