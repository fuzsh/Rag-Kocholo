        "text": "Michigan Child Protection Law requires certain professionals to report their suspicions of child abuse or neglect to Centralized Intake (CI) at the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS). These people are mandated reporters and have established relationships with children based on their profession.\n\nThe following MDHHS employees also have a legal mandate to report suspected child abuse or neglect:\n\nEligibility specialists.\n\nFamily independence manager or specialists. -\n\nSocial services specialists.\n\nSocial work specialists.\n\nSocial work specialist managers.\n\nWelfare services specialists.\n\nMaking a Report of Suspected Child Abuse/Neglect\n\nMandated reporters shall make an immediate report to CI by telephone or through the online reporting system, of suspected child abuse or child neglect. Within 72 hours after making an oral report by telephone, the reporting person shall file a written report (DHS-3200). If the immediate report has been made using the online reporting system, no additional written report is required.\n\nReporting the suspected allegations of child abuse and/or neglect to the head of the organization does not fulfill the requirement to report directly to DHHS.\n\nThe verbal report can be completed by calling 855-444-3911 . or via ISD_PartnershipLanding (michigan.gov).\n\nThe individual who had contact with the child must make the report and provide as much detail as possible about the following information:\n\nThe child's primary caretaker, including name and address.\n\nNames and birth dates for all members of the household.\n\nName and birth date of the alleged perpetrator(s).\n\nWhether the alleged perpetrator lives with the child.\n\nAddress where the alleged abuse or neglect occurred.\n\nWhat makes the mandated reporter suspect the child is being abused or neglected.\n\nThe Child Protection Law requires that the written report include the following information:\n\nName of child.\n\nDescription of abuse or neglect.\n\nNames and addresses of child's parents/guardians.\n\nThe persons with whom the child resides.\n\nChild's age.\n\nOther information available to the reporting person that might establish the cause of the abuse or neglect, and the manner in which the abuse or neglect occurred.\n\nMDHHS encourages the use of the Report of Actual or Suspected Child Abuse or Neglect (DHS-3200) form when filing the written report, which includes all the information required under the law. If more than one mandated reporter suspects child abuse or neglect based upon the same incident, they may submit just one DHS-3200 form.\n\nConfidentiality of a Mandated Reporters' Identity\n\nThe identity of a reporting person is confidential under the Child Protection Law. The identity of a reporting person is subject to disclosure only with the consent of that person, by judicial process or to those listed under Section 5 of the Child Protection Law (MCL 722.625).\n\nCivil and Criminal Liability\n\nMandated reporters, who fail to file a report of suspected child abuse or neglect, will be subject to both civil and criminal liability. In a civil action, the mandated reporter may be held liable for all damages that any person suffers due to the mandated reporters' failure to file a report. In a criminal action, the mandated reporter may be found guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for up to 93 days and a fine of $500.\n\nA person making a good faith report is protected from civil and criminal prosecution and cannot be penalized for making the report or cooperating with a CPS investigation.\n\nMandated Reporter Hotline\n\nIf a mandated reporter is dissatisfied with the response by MDHHS, the mandated reporter may contact the Mandated Reporter Hotline at 877-277-2585 . Prior to doing so, the mandated reporter must first attempt to talk with our local MDHHS office director about his or her concerns."
