        "text": "Agriculture is one of the most hazardous industries in the United States. According to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), deaths to workers in the agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting industry occurred at a rate of 18.6 per 100,000 workers in 2022. Transportation incidents (including from tractors and ATVs) were the leading cause of death, but many other hazards exist on the farm. There were over 21,000 non-fatal injuries that led to days away from work between 2021 and 2022. However, NIOSH and others have noted that agricultural injuries and fatalities are often underreported.\n\nAgriculture is different from many industries in that it can present hazards to people not actively working in the industry such as family members living on the farm and visitors. Additionally, hazards may exist for emergency medical services personnel and other healthcare professionals as they provide assistance and care to victims of farm incidents. Hazards off the farm are also a concern, particularly for the public sharing roads with equipment such as tractors.\n\nThis topic guide focuses specifically on the health and safety issues inherent in the agricultural industry. This includes issues impacting migrant workers hired to work on farms who are included in data relating to agricultural health and safety. However, if you are interested specifically in the health and healthcare of migrant or seasonal workers, see our Migrant and Seasonal Farmworker Health topic guide.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat chronic and acute health risks are farmers and farmworkers exposed to?\n\nWhat are some mental health concerns for farmers and ranchers and their families?\n\nHow many children are involved in agricultural injuries? What resources are available related to preventing farm incidents among children and youth?\n\nWhich local agencies can help support the development of an agricultural health and safety program?\n\nWhat federal agencies focus on agricultural health and safety?\n\nAre there funding sources available for nonprofits to support agricultural health and safety programs?\n\nWhat programs or resources are available that can assist agricultural employers to develop safety measures to protect their employees?\n\nAre resources available that provide special training to healthcare personnel when treating farm injuries and chemical exposures?\n\nWhat chronic and acute health risks are farmers and farmworkers exposed to?\n\nHealth risks for farmers and farmworkers include:\n\nExposure to farm chemicals, such as fuel, pesticides and fertilizers, and toxic gases which may be produced from common farm practices like manure decomposition and silo crop storage\n\nExposure to high levels of dust, which can contain mold, bacteria, and livestock fecal materials, among other things\n\nFalls from ladders, farm equipment, grain bins, or other heights\n\nExposure to ultraviolet rays from the sun, which can result in skin cancers\n\nAcute and repetitive joint and ligament injuries, which can result in arthritic conditions affecting mobility\n\nExposure to loud noises and sounds from machinery and equipment which can result in hearing loss and tinnitus\n\nStress from environmental factors, such as droughts, floods, wildfires, pests, and diseases affecting crops and livestock, as well as from working long hours, financial concerns, and feelings of isolation and frustration\n\nRisk of suffocation in a grain bin if a person is engulfed by the grain\n\nRisk of heatstroke, frostbite, or hypothermia from working outside in extreme weather conditions\n\nRisk of injury from farm equipment and motorized vehicles\n\nRisk of injury and illness from working with livestock, including needlestick injuries and zoonotic diseases\n\nRisk of electrocution, including to persons operating large equipment that can contact overhead power lines\n\nIn addition to the general hazards associated with farm work, farmers may be at increased risk for injury due to their age or health condition. The 2022 Census of Agriculture reports the average age of producers is 58.1. This is an increase over the 2017 Census of Agriculture and continues a trend of aging farmers. Common changes that occur with aging such as reduced vision, reaction time, cognition, and mobility increase the risk of injury for already hazardous tasks. Additionally, farmers and farmworkers often work alone in remote areas with limited cellular service which may delay access to emergency care.\n\nFor more information on the hazards associated with agricultural work, see the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Hazards & Controls resource. Also see the 2023 Rural Monitor article “This is Not My Grandmother's Summer”: Rural Populations Are Uniquely Vulnerable to the Health Impacts of Extreme Heat to learn more about the impact of heat on farmworker health.\n\nWhat are some mental health concerns for farmers and ranchers and their families?\n\nIn addition to physical injuries, farmers are also at risk of behavioral and mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, substance use, and death by suicide. Due to environmental, financial, and social factors, there are a number of stressors inherent in farming, ranching, and agricultural business ownership.\n\nFor information on farmer mental health in rural America, see the Rural Response to Farmer Mental Health and Suicide Prevention topic guide.\n\nHow many children are involved in agricultural injuries? What resources are available related to preventing farm incidents among children and youth?\n\nAccording to a 2022 report from the National Children's Center for Rural and Agricultural Health and Safety, every day about 33 children are injured in agriculture-related incidents. Injuries to children that occur while living, working, or visiting agricultural work environments (primarily farms and ranches) are often considered agricultural injuries, whether or not the child was actively engaged in work at the time. However, this slightly varies between datasets and agencies' definitions. Farm hazards for children include livestock, machinery and equipment, grain bins, heights, ponds/water, chemicals/gases, all-terrain vehicles (ATVs), and many others. The 2022 study Nonfatal Agricultural Injuries Treated in Emergency Departments: 2015-2019 found that youth make up 30% of emergency department visits for agricultural injuries.\n\nChild fatalities also occur as a result of farm incidents. According to a 2017 report from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), from 1994-2013 there were a total of 389 agricultural fatalities for youth under 18 years of age. The 2022 Fact Sheet: Childhood Agricultural Injuries in the U.S. lists machinery, transportation (including from tractors and ATVs), and violent contact with livestock and other humans as common causes of death.\n\nThe following resources provide tips, information, and assistance related to the safety of youth working in agriculture, as well as those that live on or visit farms:\n\nChildhood Agricultural Safety Network (CASN) – An international community of organizations focused on child agricultural safety. The organization hosts multiple online and in-person events each year.\n\nNational Children's Center for Rural and Agricultural Health and Safety – Provides technical assistance and resources regarding children and adolescents living in rural areas and working in agriculture and is funded by NIOSH. NCCRAHS also produces Cultivate Safety, which provides information, guidelines, and resources about children's farm safety for parents and other responsible adults.\n\nAgricultural Employment – U.S. Department of Labor information on federal and state labor laws pertaining to the employment of youth in agriculture.\n\nInvest in Your Health – AgriSafe online or onsite course with training materials available to ag educators. Provides lessons and activities on seven key areas of ag health and safety.\n\nThink F.A.S.T – A Farm Bureau program offering free training materials on farm safety for 14-17 year olds.\n\nProgressive Agriculture Safety Day Program – Offers education, training, and resources as the largest rural children's safety and health education program in North America.\n\nWhich local agencies can help support the development of an agricultural health and safety program?\n\nLocal and county Cooperative Extension Offices and public health offices often can provide resources to develop an agricultural health and safety program. Use this directory of local health departments to find the local public health office in your area. State health departments and departments of labor may also have resources including consultation programs. State resources that support research and education on agricultural health and safety can be found in the Resources section of the Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) website.\n\nAlso, local service clubs and faith-based organizations may provide some assistance with the development of an agricultural health and safety program.\n\nWhat federal agencies focus on agricultural health and safety?\n\nSeveral federal agencies concentrate on agricultural health and safety issues.\n\nThe USDA's National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) Farm Safety program supports Cooperative Extension System programs that promote safety by training workers in appropriate field practices, safe use of equipment, and proper maintenance of equipment.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's NIOSH Centers for Agricultural Safety and Health promote the health and safety of agricultural workers and their families. NIOSH's Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishing Program works to identify long-term safety and health research for production agriculture.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) supports safe and healthful working conditions by setting and enforcing standards and by providing training, outreach, and education.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency's Occupational Pesticide Safety and Health program focuses on worker safety in industries that use pesticides and sets requirements for safe pesticide handling, such as the Agricultural Worker Protection Standard (WPS).\n\nThe Health Resources & Services Administration's Federal Office of Rural Health Policy offers funding opportunities and resources to support rural health projects.\n\nAre there funding sources available for nonprofits to support agricultural health and safety programs?\n\nThe NIOSH Centers for Agricultural Safety and Health may offer funding opportunities for activities such as pilot projects and emerging issues project grants, research initiatives, and education and outreach grant funding.\n\nThe CHS Seeds for Stewardship Grants provide matching grants to cooperatives for projects designed to develop the next generation of agricultural leaders, improve agricultural safety, and enhance rural vitality.\n\nAs part of Grain Bin Safety Week, the Grain Bin Rescue Equipment and Training Contest offers awards of grain bin rescue tubes and hands-on rescue training to selected rural first responders.\n\nA current list of federal, state and foundation grants and programs supporting the development of agricultural health and safety projects is available by visiting the Funding & Opportunities section of this guide.\n\nWhat programs or resources are available that can assist agricultural employers to develop safety measures to protect their employees?\n\nThe U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) Agricultural Operations provides a variety of standards, resources, and statistics on the hazards of working in agriculture.\n\nThe USDA NIFA's Cooperative Extension System is an educational network providing practical, research-based information to agricultural producers, small business owners, youth, consumers, and rural communities nationwide.\n\nThe CDC's NIOSH Centers for Agricultural Safety and Health conduct research, education, and prevention projects that support the health and safety of agricultural workers. NIOSH offers the Health Hazard Evaluation program, a free evaluation of potential health hazards in the workplace. NIOSH also offers apps for tracking heat, measuring sound levels, and ensuring safe ladder use.\n\nThe Healthier Workforce Center of the Midwest offers the free, evidence-based Protecting Young Workers in Agriculture: A Training for Supervisors, Parents, and Teachers in both English and Spanish.\n\nThe National Center for Farmworker Health is a private, not-for-profit organization providing information, training, and technical assistance on agricultural safety and health.\n\nThe National Education Center for Agricultural Safety provides education and training focused on promoting safety, and preventing illnesses, injuries, and deaths among farmers and ranchers, agricultural and horticultural workers, their families, and their employees.\n\nThe National Tractor Safety Coalition is a multi-sector working group with the mission of preventing tractor related deaths in the U.S. agricultural industry.\n\nAre resources available that provide special training to healthcare personnel when treating farm injuries and chemical exposures?\n\nIn rural areas where agriculture is common, first responders and healthcare personnel must be prepared to recognize and treat agricultural injuries. In addition to providing proper care to the patient, personnel must be able to identify when hazards exist for themselves. For instance, if EMS personnel respond to a grain bin engulfment, they must be careful to avoid becoming engulfed. Likewise, if a farmworker presents at the emergency room due to chemical exposure, proper protocols should be used to ensure that healthcare workers aren't also exposed.\n\nSeveral national organizations provide training on agricultural medicine to healthcare personnel, including:"
