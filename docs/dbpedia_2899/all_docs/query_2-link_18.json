The workers may suffer no disadvantages as a result thereof. The provisions referred to in subsection (1), sentences 2 and 3, and the provisions set out in the Whistleblower Protection Act, the Military Law Complaints Code (Wehrbeschwerdeordnung, WBO) and in the Act on the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Armed Forces (Gesetz über den Wehrbeauftragten des Deutschen Bundestages, WBeauftrG) shall remain unaffected.\n\ntable of contents\n\nPart 4\n\nAuthorisations to issue statutory instruments\n\ntable of contents\n\nSection 18\n\nAuthorisations to issue statutory instruments\n\n(1) The Federal Government is authorised to stipulate by way of a statutory instrument requiring the consent of the Bundesrat which measures the employer and other responsible persons must take and how workers must act in order to fulfil their respective obligations resulting from this Act. These statutory instruments may also determine that certain provisions of this Act shall apply to the protection of persons other than those referred to in section 2 (2).\n\n(2) In particular, it may be determined by way of statutory instruments in accordance with subsection (1)\n\n1. that and how the duration or place of employment or the number of workers must be restricted to avert certain risks,\n\n2. that the use of certain work equipment or methods associated with special risks to workers is prohibited or is notified to the competent authority or must be permitted by that authority or that persons at particular risk may not be employed in that use,\n\n3. that certain particularly dangerous operating equipment, including work and production methods, must be checked by an expert before being taken into operation, at regular intervals or by order of an authority,\n\n3a. that adequate accommodation has to be provided for certain workers if this is necessary for reasons of safety, for the protection of health or for reasons to ensure decent working conditions and which requirements have to be met in that regard,\n\n4. that workers must be given a preventive medical check-up before they take up or continue or after they have completed certain dangerous activities and which specific duties the physician has in that regard,\n\n5. that committees are to be established and assigned the task of advising the Federal Government or the competent federal ministry in respect of the application of the statutory instruments, to determine regulations corresponding to the state of the art, occupational medicine and hygiene and other established findings of ergonomics and to determine regulations in regard to how the requirements set out in the statutory instruments can be met. The Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs may officially publish the regulations and findings.\n\n(3) In epidemic situations of national significance in accordance with section 5 (1) of the Protection Against Infection Act, the Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs may issue special statutory instruments in accordance with subsection (1) for a limited period not requiring the consent of the Bundesrat. For a limited period of time that expires by 7 April 2023 at the latest, the Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs may determine by a statutory instrument not requiring the consent of the Bundesrat that\n\n1. specific statutory instruments under sentence 1 continue to apply after suspension of the epidemic situation of national significance according to section 5 (1) of the Protection Against Infection Act and it may amend them and it may also\n\n2. enact specific statutory instruments under subsection (1).\n\ntable of contents\n\nSection 19\n\nLegal acts of the European Communities and inter-governmental agreements\n\nStatutory instruments in accordance with section 18 may also be issued insofar as this is necessary to implement legal acts of the Council or the Commission of the European Communities or the decisions of international organisations or inter-governmental agreements which affect matters addressed in this Act, in particular occupational safety and health obligations on persons other than those referred to in section 2 (3).\n\ntable of contents\n\nSection 20\n\nRegulations applicable to the public service\n\n(1) Land legislation shall regulate whether and to what extent the statutory instruments issued in accordance with section 18 apply to civil servants of the Länder, municipalities and other corporations, institutions and foundations under public law.\n\n(2) The Federal Chancellery, the Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community, the Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure, the Federal Ministry of Defence or the Federal Ministry of Finance may, insofar as they are competent in a respective case, determine in regard to specific activities in the federal public service, in particular in the Federal Armed Forces, the police, the civil protection and disaster management services, the customs or the intelligence services, by way of statutory instrument not requiring the consent of the Bundesrat that the provisions set down in this Act shall not apply in full or in part insofar as there is a compelling public interest, particularly in regard to the maintenance or restoration of public security. Statutory instruments within the meaning of sentence 1 shall be issued in consultation with the Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and, where the Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community is itself not authorised, in consultation with that ministry. At the same time, the statutory instruments shall determine how safety and health protection at work are guaranteed by other means giving consideration to the objectives of this Act. Regulations corresponding to sentences 1 and 3 may be determined by Land law in respect of activities in the public service of the Länder, municipalities and other corporations, institutions and foundations under public law which are directly accountable to the Land government.\n\ntable of contents\n\nPart 5\n\nJoint German Occupational Safety and Health Strategy\n\ntable of contents\n\nSection 20a\n\nJoint German Occupational Safety and Health Strategy\n\n(1) In accordance with the regulations laid down in this Part and in the interests of effective occupational safety and health provision, the Federal Government, the Länder and accident insurance providers shall develop a Joint German Occupational Safety and Health Strategy and shall guarantee its implementation and updating.

The competent authorities shall monitor compliance with this Act and with the statutory instruments issued on the basis of this Act and shall advise employers when it comes to meeting their obligations. When selecting establishments for monitoring purposes, the competent authorities shall take into account the nature and extent of the operational risk potential.\n\n(1a) In the process of monitoring in accordance with subsection (1), the competent Land authorities shall ensure that a minimum number of establishments are inspected in the course of a calendar year. Starting in the calendar year 2026, at least five per cent of the establishments in a Land shall be inspected in the course of a calender year (minimum inspection rate). Land law may not allow deviation from the minimum inspection rate. Where a Land authority does not reach the minimum inspection rate, it shall be required to gradually increase the number of establishments inspected at least to the extent that the minimum inspection rate is reached in the calendar year 2026. The number of establishments in a Land shall be determined on the basis of the official statistics of the Federal Employment Agency of the preceding year.\n\n(2) Unless provided otherwise, the tasks and powers of the statutory accident insurance providers shall be determined by the provisions of the Social Code. Insofar as the statutory accident insurance providers also take on tasks to guarantee the safety and health protection of workers in accordance with the Social Code within the framework of their preventive remit, they shall perform their activities exclusively within the framework of their independent powers.\n\n(3) The competent Land authorities and the accident insurance providers shall cooperate closely on the basis of a Joint Advisory and Supervisory Strategy in accordance with section 20a (2) no. 4 and shall ensure the exchange of experience. This Strategy shall comprise the coordination of general principles regarding the methodological modus operandi in regard to\n\n1. advising and supervising establishments,\n\n2. determining the content of the main topics of consultation and supervision, coordinated or joint main actions and work programmes, and\n\n3. promoting the sharing of data and other information, in particular regarding inspections of establishments and their key results.\n\nIn accordance with section 20 (2), sentence 3, of the Seventh Book of the Social Code, the competent Land authorities shall agree measures with the accident insurance providers which are necessary in the implementation of the joint work programmes in accordance with section 20a (2) no. 2 and the Joint Advisory and Supervisory Strategy; they shall evaluate target achievement on the basis of the indicators determined by the National Occupational Safety and Health Conference in accordance with section 20a (2) no. 3.\n\n(3a) In relation to inspections carried out after 1 January 2023 and their results, the Land authorities competent in regard to occupational safety and health shall transmit the following information by way of electronic data transfer to the accident insurance provider competent in regard to the business premises inspected:\n\n1. name and address of the establishment,\n\n2. address of the business premises inspected if it is not identical with no. 1,\n\n3. identification number,\n\n4. economic sector to which the establishment belongs,\n\n5. date of inspection,\n\n6. number of workers at time of inspection,\n\n7. existence of workers’ representation,\n\n8. type of support provided by safety specialists,\n\n9. type of occupational health services provided,\n\n10. evaluation of the organisation of occupational safety and health including\n\na) instruction,\n\nb) preventive occupational health care and\n\nc) First Aid and other emergency measures,\n\n11. evaluation of the risk assessment including\n\na) the identification of risks and definition of measures,\n\nb) review of the implementation of measures and their effectiveness,\n\nc) the documentation of risks and measures,\n\n12. administrative action taken in the form of statements, orders or fines.\n\nThe accident insurance providers may process the data transferred only for the purpose of fulfilling the tasks for which they are competent in accordance with section 17 (1) of the Seventh Book of the Social Code.\n\n(4) The highest Land authority competent in regard to occupational safety and health may reach agreement with statutory accident insurance providers that they shall monitor compliance with this Act, certain provisions of this Act or the statutory instruments issued on the basis of this Act in areas of activity to be determined in more detail. The agreement shall set out the nature and extent of the supervision, as well as cooperation with the public safety and health authorities.\n\n(5) Unless provided otherwise in the following, the authority competent in regard to implementation of this Act and of statutory instruments issued on the basis of this Act in establishments and administrations of the Federation shall be the Central Office for Occupational Safety and Health in the Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community. Unless provided otherwise, the Accident Insurance Fund for the Federation and the Railways, which is subject to the supervision of the Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community in this regard, shall act on behalf of the Central Office for Occupational Safety and Health; expenses shall not be reimbursed. Insofar as the Railway Accident Insurance Fund was the accident insurance provider until 31 December 2014, the Accident Insurance Fund for the Federation and the Railways shall implement this Act in the public service within the area of responsibility of the Federal Ministry for Transport and Digital Infrastructure. As regards establishments and administrations within the areas of responsibility of the Federal Ministry of Defence and of the Federal Foreign Office as regards its foreign representations, the respective federal ministry, insofar as it is competent in a respective case, or the agency determined by it, shall implement this Act. Within the area of responsibility of the Federal Ministry of Finance, the Transport, Posts and Telecommunications Accident Insurance Fund shall implement this Act, insofar as the area of responsibility of the former Federal Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications is affected. Sentences 1 to 4 shall also apply to establishments and administrations belonging to the federal administration but for which an occupational accident insurance fund is the accident insurance provider. The competent federal ministries may agree with the occupational accident insurance funds in regard to these establishments and administrations that the Act will be implemented by the occupational accident insurance funds; expenses shall not be reimbursed.\n\ntable of contents\n\nSection 22\n\nPowers of the competent authorities\n\n(1) The competent authority may require that the employer or the responsible persons provide the information necessary for it to perform its supervisory task and to hand over relevant documents. Where workers of several employers are working at one place of work, the competent authority may require that the employers or the responsible persons submit the result of the coordination of the measures to be taken in accordance with section 8 (1) in writing. The person obliged to provide the information may refuse to supply any information in response to those questions or to hand over those documents if answering the questions or handing over the documents would expose them or one of their relatives referred to in section 383 (1) nos 1 to 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung, ZPO) to the risk of prosecution of a criminal offence or of a regulatory offence. The person obliged to provide the information shall be informed of this fact.\n\n(2) The persons commissioned with the supervision shall be authorised to enter, inspect and examine business premises, offices and working areas during business and working hours and to inspect the business documents of the person obliged to provide information insofar as this is necessary for the performance of their tasks.

The employer or the person responsible must support the person tasked with the supervision in exercising their powers in accordance with sentences 1 and 2. Outside of the hours referred to in sentence 1, the persons authorised to carry out the supervisory activity may take the measures referred to in sentences 1 and 2 without the consent of the employer only to prevent imminent dangers to public safety or order. If the workplace is in a person’s home, the persons authorised to carry out the supervisory activity may take the measures referred to in sentences 1 and 2 without the consent of the occupants or the persons entitled to use that home only to prevent imminent dangers to public safety or order.
