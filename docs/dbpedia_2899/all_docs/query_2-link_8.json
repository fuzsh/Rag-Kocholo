        "meta_description": "In recent decades, natural events have been wreaking significantly more destruction than ever before. Disaster Risk Management is a strategy used in development policy to lessen the devastating impact of such events. The idea is to do everything that can possibly be done to stop natural events turning into disasters. Disaster Risk Management saves lives and helps to secure the progress developing countries have already made.",

        "text": "When industrialised countries experience disaster, the damage inflicted on health and physical assets is largely covered by insurance and social protection systems. Developing countries, however, generally do not have the means required to tackle acute crises on their own. If homes, roads, schools, hospitals, factories, farmland, water pipes and electricity lines are destroyed, people lose their livelihoods and struggle to survive.\n\nExtreme natural events often result, in the first instance, in a tragic loss of human life. Then, the knock-on effects emerge: poverty, inequality, undernutrition, homelessness, disease, forced displacement, migration, armed conflict. These all further erode the resilience of particularly vulnerable groups, which diminishes their chances of leading a better life with more equal opportunities.\n\nThe concept of Disaster Risk Management has been developed In German development cooperation to tackle disasters and their negative impact. The aim is to stop extreme events endangering human lives, causing economic and environmental damage and repeatedly destroying all the development gains that have been achieved in the partner countries.\n\nDisaster risk management is a cross-cutting issue relevant to many areas of German development cooperation. The Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) takes a holistic approach to managing disaster risk management, drawing together a multitude of strategies and instruments from a range of areas: policymaking, business and economics, poverty reduction, social protection, urban development, the environment, climate change adaptation, education and health.\n\nPartner country governments are supported in adapting their national policies on disaster, climate, urban planning and development so as to take greater account of risks like climate change, population growth and pandemics. The aim is to make people more resilient, empowering them to overcome crises using their own resources and to safeguard existing development gains.\n\nOne special focus of German development cooperation in this context is highly vulnerable people and groups: women, children, the elderly, the LGBTIQ+ community, indigenous people, people with disabilities and those living in extreme poverty. All of them must be actively involved in disaster risk management processes and their specific needs and abilities must be reflected.\n\nAt international level, the BMZ is a strong advocate of greater coherence between international agreements such as the 2030 Agenda, the Paris Agreement and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (External link). In order to reduce the burden that implementing all these agreements places on partners, it is important to clearly define responsibilities, share data, coordinate reporting systems and align financing instruments.\n\nThe BMZâ€™s main partners in the field of disaster risk management include the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) and the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR)."
