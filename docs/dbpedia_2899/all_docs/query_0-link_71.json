        "text": "Haiti is the poorest country in the Latin America and the Caribbean region and among the poorest in the world. Hunger is tightening its grip as insecurity, violence and deepening economic woes combine with climate-related shocks and other disasters.\n\nHaiti has one of the highest levels of food insecurity in the world. The number of food-insecure people has tripled since 2016. A total 4.35 million Haitians - nearly half the population - do not have enough to eat and 1.4 million are facing emergency levels of food insecurity.\n\nIn the Cite Soleil neighbourhood of Port-au-Prince, catastrophic levels of hunger have reduced thanks to emergency response by WFP and partners. However, any disruption to humanitarian support could result in deepening hunger. Global acute malnutrition affects 7.2 percent of children aged under 5, while 66 percent of under 5s suffer from anaemia.\n\nPoor performance of agriculture and heavy dependence on imports also drive food insecurity. This makes the country vulnerable to inflation and price volatility in international markets. Consumer prices for major food products are 30 to 77 percent higher than in the Latin America and Caribbean region.\n\nThese issues have been exacerbated by a series of disasters over the past two decades, including storms, flooding, landslides, drought and earthquakes. On the 2021 Climate Risk Index, Haiti is third among the countries most affected by extreme weather events from 2000 to 2019."
