Changes that would otherwise be effective on a weekend day or holiday will be effective on the next business day. Information contained in the directories is based on attestations that the PSOs provide. To update PSO contact information, please use the Change of Listing Information form which can be accessed by the Authorized Official in the My PSO Account section; to update profile information, please go to the PSO PPC Web site.\n\nLISTED PSOs LOGO\n\nThe \"Listed PSO\" logo is available for use by PSOs that are currently listed by the HHS Secretary. Healthcare providers considering working with a PSO are advised to review this directory to ensure that the entity's PSO certifications have been accepted in accordance with Section 3.104(a) of the Patient Safety Rule."
